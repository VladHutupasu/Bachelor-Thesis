My advice: Don't long until new low is made.

Poll time! Curious to see how long term bullish this sub is. Lots of people who short / are hedged but are long term bullish. How many?

"Will BTC hit a new ATH ever again?" 

https://www.strawpoll.me/16062920

1. Positive it will

2. Fairly sure it will

3. Neutral/idk

4. Fairly sure it won't

5. Positive it won't

If any of you answered that it won't but think crypto market cap or a specific alt will hit ATH again then comment here and let us know, I'd be curious to see that too.. Shouldve added an option for that 
Wouldn't be surprised to see the same price when I wake up tomorrow.
Need to do a proper retrospective on VRSI, especially on the weekly. We set a new low with the dump though at 35, just 5 points from oversold. But we're still above 6k.

I'm slowly coming round to the belief that this is mirroring 2014-2015, [but only in regards to the bubble pop cycle of price movement.](https://i.imgur.com/kwJlSE0.jpg) EDIT: Absolutely fucked the labeling. Fixed now.

But it remains that the market landscape is so fundamentally different.

I'm not the first to suggest the idea of "the same but quicker" but I'm becoming a stronger advocate for it as time goes on. Especially because the drying up of volume, the VRSI drop and the bottoms/grind down looking eerily similar.

I'm considering reducing my holdings for now, but have developed a sense of morbid curiosity about what will happen in the next month or so.
have you seen [wex.nz](https://wex.nz) (ex [btc-e.com](https://btc-e.com))? it's about to go belly up i think, and it's one of the oldest exchanges, however, having a shady history as of half year ago. 
there's a bull whale on gdax right now
From today's report. 

BTC Macro: Same scenario on the weekly candles as previously reported.  StochRSI oversold very heavily & looking at a cross over of the MACD.  This last weekly candle is showing more of a cool off than necessarily downward pressure,  watching for a low of 5800 & a high of 7k on the coming week. 

BTC Local: So there's been all this talk about an inverted head and shoulders, which I don't chart very often.  However I decided to go ahead and give it a try today.  
Interestingly enough we do have a strong neckline formed (horizontal line with a blue indicator) 
We have dips resembling a left shoulder and head, we can see form the volume that during this section we're having some confirmation that 'something is genuine' whether it's head and shoulders or lower support however is unclear atm.  
Then we have the ole StochRSI in an oversold position, along with MACD reaching an area that would indicate it's at least primed for a turn around, but tbh the MACD could also continue for several more red bars so I'm not seriously considering it as a confluence factor atm.  

Looks like the next 2 days will show us whether it's a genuine inverted HS pattern or not, it looks like there is enough supporting evidence though atm that we can at least take it into consideration.

If you feel so inclined I've got charts for these commentaries in my daily report.

# KBA: All Exchanges Meet Requirements

Alt is dropping hard again. Not sure if BTC will continue to hold here after that mini bounce.
[removed]
Anyone holding out for yet another potential 'crypto is ded' panic catalyst providing the 2018 crypto slaughter crescendo?
Is there anything that would make you think the price isn't going to do [exactly the same thing](https://imgur.com/a/vf1dXXt) (dump to $5,800) it did on June 23 after a very similar pattern?

If it repeats, we are just waiting for the RSI to get above 50 before the dump.
BitMex perpetual open value at 99,977 BTC:   
   
  Can... we... **GET THERE**?!?!   
   
Edit:  We did, we did get there ô¿ô
Ascending triangle setup: https://imgur.com/a/4cFVJcH

Assuming we tap into ~6380 again, bearish trigger on break below 6330. Bullish trigger if we pull back from 6380 into ~6350 again and then break above 6400. 

ETA: BTW my upside target on such a pattern would be ~6530 which I think is a good short entry, down side target probably like 6200 but I think if it goes down there it's gonna find it's way back to sub 6k.


!short XBTUSD 6355 2x 100%

We had just too many chances to bounce.

Stops above 6.4.
Why when googling bitcoin and clicking news do I see two headlines saying bitcoin will reach 50 and 60k by the end of 2018? What are these guys smoking and are they looking at the same charts I am? We're lucky to move 200-300 bucks up or down and any big move has almost always been down this year. We can't even break 7k without getting rejected! Volume is low and we barely get bounces in between massive dumps. I think bulls are scared to even bother trying to pump it since it will just get dumped on majorly. But yeah, according to two sources today, we're going to hit anywhere from 50-60k by end of 2018. 

I'd be shocked if we broke past 20k this year. Nevermind 50k. If Btc were to even touch 40k by end of 2018, I'll dice my balls off first, penis second, and eat it. 
Short from around $6,360. 

RSI has had a chance to cool off since the decline yesterday and is safely above oversold conditions across the board. 

Regretting my premature exit of my $6,620 short last week, but no sense dwelling on the past. 
5 days ago I wrote:

> 3D PSAR flipped to the downside. That's usually a strong indication we're just getting started here.

> However, in the next 3-4 days I expect us to go down to around ~6.2k (accumulation zone).

Since then I was away from the internet. What happened? Sentiment in this board went to hell, despite the obvious exhaustion and reset of indicators a few days ago.

Most of you are looking out for that 100% sure capitulation wick that gives you a *feeling* of certainty. In reality it's just another form of (more subtle) greed. 

Markets don't care about the fiat you have on the sidelines for such an event. That's not how it works.

We don't know if we have seen the bottom, yet. There are always events that can disturb the look of the charts. But this looks exactly like *I* would expect a bottoming process to look like under current market forces!

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8w7k00/daily_discussion_thursday_july_05_2018/e1ub5se/
Welp, I’m done with crypto for the week. Not gonna bother with sideways action. Btw there’s a Red 9 on the weekly for bitmex using the TD sequential indicator. 
I just don't think this 5k scenario is going to happen.  There are some serious sharks down there.  They had all last summer to gobble up the Bitcoin but they didn't and instead fought against it.  Now they say they will buy below 5k?  Somethings not adding up to me.  And its almost like they feel entitled to cheaper Bitcoin but they weren't smart enough to buy last summer
/u/Manuelhruby mentioned the TD 9 Setup occurring this week. It happens if we close this week below 6.45k. If we close below 6k, it will be a *"perfect"* buy setup. If you didn't know, a TD sequential setup is when 9 consecutive bars close below the close of the bar 4 bars before. If the 8th or 9th closes below the low of any other bar in the countdown, it's called "perfect."

So, I went and backtested off the assumption that a TD9 buy setup on the *weekly* is a very rare thing for bitcoin. Well, I was right. It has occurred only one time before, in 2014 (see yellow): [https://imgur.com/a/z5ibON2](https://imgur.com/a/z5ibON2)

If you notice, the setup only wasn't a very good buy signal in that one case. So we're 0/1.

However, there's the TD countdown as well that tends to provide a more reliable (or perhaps safer) buy signal. You first wait for the setup, then start with the countdown: 13 candles that close below the *low* two candles before (two candles instead of four, and low instead of close).  Unlike the setup, these candles don't have to be sequential. If you go ahead and do that after the perfect setup in 2014, you get to buy at around $230. That's a pretty damn good entry - there was a few more weeks of sideways/bear and slightly better entries available as low as $200 if you caught the absolute bottom, but I'd personally be hella happy with that considering the bull run that happened afterwards.

Just something to think about. You best believe **if** we get a setup (preferably a perfect setup) this week I'll absolutely be keeping track of the countdown. Maybe the resulting entry on it won't be as good and it's obviously not the only thing to consider when looking for a long term entry, but it's something that'll be on my checklist before declaring a true bull run (provided the setup materializes - if we close this week above 6.45k this is all moot).
Chew, you take any new positions after closing that short hedge you took I think last week around 6500? If I recall correctly, I think you were saying you were going to short under $6,400
What is this right now? It's not a bear flag, that would have an upward trend.

It's not a triangle. It's not a wedge.

It's indecisiveness. Or something else...?
These giant ass buy walls on coinbase pro are giving me nostalgia...
how does the general chat work with this subreddit?
So I’ve been a dirty scalper the past couple of days with the increased volatility induced by the recent dump, and I figured it wasn’t worth updates on positionbot for positions I was only planning to keep open for a couple of hours. I recently closed a super heavy short on perps from 6368 to 6313 (Like, all-in, 10x. Not normal for me at all, and probably a bad idea even though I came out big in the green). Since the price has been wicking quickly to the $6250-$6300 range lately, I wanted to take my profits early. However, it looks like this most recent dump has already had some follow-through.

If I were still short, I wouldn’t mind keeping it open here until I saw some confirmation of a bounce. However, the price action is still strange here, with ETH’s price increasing and GDAX whales apparently accumulating all day. I still expect the medium-term position to be down, but I’m not comfortable opening a short right here on support as the this dip could still turn out to be a fakeout with a small pump to $6480-ish (the high on basically the only bounce on the way down from $6800).

This could just be the start of another dump, especially with the bearish pennant forming on the 1hr. If that’s the case, I’ll just do what I do best and catch the wick on the bottom and redistribute on the bounce ;). Either way, this is your daily reminder not to short on support.

So basically I mean I will be shorting anything around $6400 and longing around $6100; very similar to CatPizzas analysis actually.

(Edit: aaand we bounced back on that dump yet again)
Bitfinex dumps and then whale(s) buys price back up and puts up 500-800 BTC in new buy support. Again and again and again. Yet people continue to dump into the guys with the biggest bags of fiat. 
As a trader, you need to have more faith in the TA you make (and the conclusions you draw from it), than in anyone else's. If you find yourself reading comments and flipping your trades to the other side, you're allowing yourself to be susceptible to opposing viewpoints. Worst case, minimize your position or go flat if you now have doubt. If you flip your trade and it ends up going the way you originally thought it would, demoralization ensues. A trader affected by a demoralized sense of judgement is worthless. Our sense of judgement also immediately becomes impaired as soon as we enter a trade because we are now biased. The only way to regain clarity, if need be, is to go flat. It's easier to get back in the market than get out of it.
Looking at the daily, this actually doesnt look too bad. If you zoom out a bit, this just seems to be a higher low. Not that this means anything positive but the daily candles really cancel out a lot of the noise and all the barts. Its our first real drop since roughly 2 weeks and its precisely as large as the BGD that started the mini rally. Does this mean anything? I dont know, but it feels good and gets you a little bit calm in comparison to looking at the 30 min and trying to take every 3 contactpoint resistance or support as a sign for one thing or another.
Closed my $1mm short @ $6294. Opened at $6420 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8uq6eg/z/e1j7lcd), total profit of 2% or $20k USD.

The market is not acting as I expected within the timeframe allotted. Happy to exit at this price and re evaluate. 
[longs keep opening and shorts keep closing \(scale 24H\)](https://i.imgur.com/YwGEz64.png) many of these logs are under water, but what is more interesting is if you zoom out and change the scale to start the 1st of May it is then when you [understand the scale of this](https://i.imgur.com/eKxD5qy.png), so many Longs underwater!

1- they need a miracle if they are still looking for breakeven or a profit.

2- they will need to close and suck up the losses now.

3- An epic long squeeze is coming and it will induce a domino effect.

TA wise, even though the 1h, 2h, 4h RSI seems to be oversold, Ichimoku cloud strongly suggest that we will continue dumping on these intervals. On the 12h, 1d, 3d, 1w we still have plenty room to continue dumping.


This has been a brutal 7 months.  I really thought we would have recovered much more quickly than we have.  Even though I think that Coinbase provides a great new way to buy btc., the way they make it tough to verify id probably has discouraged a lot of people.

I would like to see a company open in person KYC and AML offices that allow people to come in and verify their ID and then that information is shared with whatever site needs it.  Live ID you could call it.

But beyond that I think this market is really fucked.  We cannot get proper statistics on demand.  I don't like how the trading is so focused on futures and short selling.  Every market strangles itself from greed eventually.  It's going to take a lot for this to recover.  We need more information to find out how much demand is really out there so we can have confidence in the future.  It's frustrating that the people involved in the industry don't understand how to foster confidence.  

I don't like that certain alts that have big market caps give millions of dollars of coins away. (xrp).  The mix of companies just isn't right.  
Things not really moving, exiting my 6300 long with a 2% profit here.

Probably the price will go up now, so you are all welcome
this tradewar crap should be pretty bullish, no? I can feel we're kind of reaching the point where I can't be bothered to time the bottom anymore and id rather just hodl. gonna close my shorts and just scale in this week   
!short xbtu18 close 6360
Going short here at $6380... stops all the way at $6850... and take profit at $6150.  I'll likely bail however if we get a strong move above $6600. 

Might not be the best position, as this may work its way to $6550 and [hit resistance on previous support line](https://www.tradingview.com/x/gqryz5jR/), but I think we're going to have one more leg down in the next 24-48 and want to be in position.
My small long got stopped out while asleep. Not that I didn't expect this to happen... Still on a hedge. Waiting this out for a while. Probably gonna short if this doesn't manage to get above 6.4 soon.

!long XBTZ18 close 6340
Shorts positioning around 6390, longs around 6350. Shorts have momentum, longs have support. Whos gonna win this round? 
This guy...

Any idea the reason behind it?
Looks like there is a big short wall on finex here at 6350?
How about this for a 2 month outlook https://i.imgur.com/5YMMsKv.png see low $4000's then a pump.

Pretty bad effort by bulls to reclaim some ground yesterday. I’m thinking 6200 support will break in the coming days, and a test of 5800 is imminent.

On the flip side, if 6200 support holds, bulls will be well set for an inverse heads and shoulders - could take us up into high 8Ks in the coming weeks.
Went 100% fiat at $6,300 for the first time since August 2017. Told myself if we broke down below $6,300 again I'd exit. Best of luck to everyone.


EDIT: Should be noted I finished ~+450%, and will be using these funds to fund a startup I have been working on the for the last 5 months. Reality hit, and I have to lock in that future. Let it be known at one point I was +>2,000%. Learn from my mistakes. Take profits boys. 
Community poll time! Where do you think Bitcoin will be in 2 months?

https://www.strawpoll.me/16062159
And just like that, with /u/moon_airspace's departure, we went to 25k.
In a long from 6313. I think if we get a 4 hr close over 6380 it would be a sign that we're gonna bounce. Might happen on this candle or the next.

https://imgur.com/a/LN0vbty
I have my current daily buy at around 6200 which I think will be our low for the day. Then we'll probably hang out around there for another day before moving back up. We have now been in the 6k range for a month and volume in this range has been pretty consistent. We may have a few large volume spikes up or down but I think both sides are exhausted and we'll continue to go sideways in this range. 

I think I'm fully bought into the fact that since we have low volume *and* low volatility that almost everyone, including traders, are gone from the scene, which makes me think that the majority of the buys are people buying for the long term. Of course this can still go lower. As I've said many times before, the same two people can push the price down buy selling the same coin to each other at lower and lower prices, even if the vast majority of the coins being bought are going to long term hodlers. 

I sold at 6030 anticipating a break of 6k. 6k was *the* support to hold since that would have confirmed a huge descending triangle. Then 6k did break and we plummeted another 5%. But now it's been 3 weeks and nothing has come from it. Even now I'm still cautiously buying back in and I bet the majority of people on here are in fiat and/or hedged. So what happens when all that fiat that's sitting on exchanges start coming back in? Obviously the bottom will already be in when that happens.


tl;dr I'm (cautiously) bullish
Has Bitmex ever hit 100,000 XBT open value on swap? Getting close https://i.imgur.com/I8xKhOx.png

Lot of something will get rekt soon.
We have bounced off [this line](https://imgur.com/a/SFzP2p2) four times yesterday & today. Interesting to see if it will hold.  (edit: grammar ++)
Is there a way to correct the positions you entered in the position bot? 
I messed up and said I shorted EOS at 1.00$
OKEX quarterly futures just reached a premium for the first time in a while just now. Will be interesting to see how this develops..

Edit: Back at a _tiny_ discount, or equal.
Closed out my long in this dump
4hr bearish ichimoku tk cross on the next candle on all exchanges and rsi is reset which would point to more down...but we all know that the whales will decide
Are all the stillborn barts the last couple days because underlying downtrend is more powerful or because the "microstructure regime" has changed in some significant way? Would-be rallies are getting bitch slapped. Perhaps someone, or some group, has a counter-bart strat?
I must say the depth looks momentarily bearish. Short is a good position at this moment in the short term which is why I'm not adding to my underwater 6.55K long just yet. 6.1 looks pretty solid. If I were the shorting type, I'd short here and close at 6.1. But I'm not. So I'll keep my powder dry until 6.1 then average down.
This looks like the most obvious bear flag in the making. I think we're fucked
I'm very bullish short term, bearish intermediate term. Descending triangle suggests a bounce off $8000 following the local low at $5700+-. 

The continued failure to fall below 6300 and before, below $5700, suggests $5700 was the local bottom. 

Elliott's wave looks like beginning of a wave 4 (top at $7850) before wave 5 takes us to around $3000- $4000 and an overall bottom before the next long bull cycle.

 If we get well above $8000, then the bear cycle has been aborted early. But I don't think that happens. 

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/L5nF9mxh-BTC-to-the-Bottom/
so as I [predicted yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8xlbz1/daily_discussion_tuesday_july_10_2018/e242lkc/) and [the day before](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8wyyub/daily_discussion_sunday_july_08_2018/e1ztfrj/) it the market will not rebounce, the price movement will cool down for few hours then it will continue dumping.

I think by tomorrow we will test new lower lows, probably rebounce a bit then continue dumping, there is so much room for dumps on the 12h, 1d, 3d and 1w.

BTW: the number of longs vs shorts is still [dangerous](https://i.imgur.com/18Ar7DV.png), we are still not in the epic squeeze area, [watch out for that](https://datamish.com/d/000000004/btcusd?refresh=20s&orgId=1&from=now-24h&to=now).


[ETHBTC looking to make a move](https://www.tradingview.com/x/f7shTISd/). 4 Hour MACD cross.  Things could get interesting if it migrates up into the positive.

Might be worth keeping an eye on. But on the other hand, may well just be a big bag of shit.

EDIT: Link formatting

EDIT 2: Relevant to this sub because when ETHBTC pumps, BTCUSD usually pumps. So as i said might be worth keeping an eye on this setup.
Pretty impressive accumulation so far at these levels on Coinbase Pro...easily 300-500 BTC over the past hour, likely by one entity. The walls are real (not spoofed), are getting sold into, and refilled...so far, at least.
The retracement to ~6,300 was predicted by many and occurred. Alts took a hard hit. I believe that as long as we hold the 6,200 support we are still on track for a short-term bull movement. Breaking below it would be a bearish sign. I do believe that ALTs will have a hard time recovering in this market as we see Bitcoin dominance climb. Only time will tell.  
Time to go up
About 1k btc on the ask side of bfx has been pulled and LTC&ETH are starting to break up. Guess we'll get that 6400 test quite soon.
I was 100% fiat for a while. Got out at the worst possible time. Now I bought back some coins with about a third of my budget, only to hedge against a sudden rise. 

I have to admit, I don't really believe in it. But better safe than sorry.
went 20% fiat for the first time since 2013, cashed out some money to renovate my house. im not a trader and the fact i didn't sold at ath piss me off. hope i learned from my mistakes. 

still this is a 6000% profit so i can't complain too much. 

i will keep my other 80% stack in cold wallet and never touch it again until we get another bull run someday or i need money for emergencies (having a good job and good salary to cover tho). 

I don't think in the future i will put more money in btc. if btc will performs (as im think it will) very good in the long run (2-5-10 years), with my other 80% stack i will pretty much fine for the rest of my life.

have a nice day folks.
Longing september futures from 6300 , usually the lowest priced(or rolling 24h% down) corrects a bit up when price flattens out. Would not be surprised with a new 6400 test today.

I still think BTC Is som mid term mega formation, both pumps and dumps getting weaker or faster bought/sold into
Whales tryna get as many longs aboard as possible. It will be good fuel for a quick ride down. They are really dragging it at $6.4k. I think we bounce at $5.8k and everyone calls a triple bottom. But, we will probably continue to go down again after the crappy bounce.  
Brexit! England out..so, go full in bitcoin!
Volume is dropping again. It should pick up when the sell off resumes , just like the last 2 months.
Hmmmmmm its resting on the daily double tenkan and on the 3d normal tenkan, plus we got a 9 on the td weekly. Longing the support test of the daily double tenkan has given me mad profits in the past, but that was when there was still hope in the market.  Longing is also almost free now on bitfinex with a shitton of funding.   
Very tempted to go long here, but i am going to wait and see if we can break and hold 6400 (daily middle bollinger).
~~I just did a full text search looking for anyone talking about the tether spike today. 7% discount on all CC via tether.~~
~~The only other time this has happened was on January 12th. We should be watching this closely.~~
https://coinlib.io/coin/USDT/Tether

Edit: false alarm. Need a better data source for moonmath alt markets. damnit.
As I said yesterday,i think that he bulls know that if we break down from here then the previous lows will most likely not hold, and to me that would mean that 5000ish is all but assured. Thus the strong defense here.
For that reason I have resisted shorting even though I have been bearish since 10k.
One more failed attempt to break down and I would not be surprised at another run up to 6800 and then possibly 7800. 
Still on the sidelines

good luck
I wonder if there is any valuable data to be had in the historical upvotes/downvotesd percentages of this daily thread?

Of course... if there were... that would be irrelevant in the future.

I like to think.
I wonder how much of the price action and so on if affected by the "Not real money" that are in the markets. With that I mean, people who made like 20-50x returns on something, so for them let's say 500k pure  profits I just a number. They can let it go to 150k or 700k, so they can handle wide swings in any direction. 

Any tool that it can be possible to see how much "real" money actually entered the market and it's not just different profits and ratios thrown around ? 
Just saying that this is looking like the standard dumping pattern we usually see. Rolling over near resistance with one or two small red candles, a big red candle the next day, small green candle near the bottom, usually followed by one or two more red candles the days after. (All on the daily timeframe). 
The hell that support is strong. Let's see how long it will last.
I don't understand, I am not bullish or anything but why do people keep dumping even though 6300 has been tested like 6 times? Is r/r even worth it at this price?
I guess we find out the fate of the inverted H&S right now....doesn’t look good but I’m rooting for the bulls.
Gonna be watching London open closely today. gave us a nice treat yesterday... wouldnt be surprised if we get a nice little judas swing.

I'm starting to really consider taking a bit of a break when i close my positions. I've realised that i understand small aspects of multiple trading systems/styles but i dont actually understand any of them in depth. think an education break would be in order, need to go through all the ICT and Sam Seiden stuff. plus non crypto education, need to do some personal development/life improvement shit and really need drill in keynsian and austrian schools for september...
Couldn't even go to 6400 now. This looks grim.
Ok so both the 2hour and 4hour Ichimoku Clouds have bottom of the cloud support at give or take - 6300.

This interjects with a relatively weak looking support line taken from the lows of 29th June, which we bounced off on 10th July, then tested again on the 11th... it ain't a strong support line at all. Only really 2 points of contact. 

Should we break under say 6275 then it seems relatively likely we'll be heading further down. Considering there really is piss all support between 6300 and the lows of 5750 (Binance)... then I can only really see another drop into this area. 

Saving of course a random Bart fucker for no apparent reason


Is the halving priced in yet?
If it keeps knocking at 6400 you think at some point it’s gotta break through. What is this, the 5th or 6th time already?
Staying up late as to not miss anything. Now watch 4 more hours of sideways now...
Hmm I wonder if the ascending channel broke down. Valid or not?
why is it that i cant see the volume on my tradingview ? it is just n/a?
with that quick failed wick up expecting to test 6.2k at least. setting my short stop lower at 6375 and going to fuckin sleep
OKEX quarterly futures discount has been reducing in the past day, and is almost reaching level with spot now. Are we breaking up from here?
Let's go boys, break that long awaited 6300!

Edit: Why? what doesn't go up must come down right? it stuck here forever...
I FOMO shorted the absolute bottom on the drop on Mex yesterday at 50x, liquidated minutes later. Reminded myself that I don't miss the chaos of degenerate gambling.

Luckily it was a tiny portion of my stack, Im still long from 6.5k on sept futures with the rest. I have no stops because every sensible place to put stops also looks like a potential price for a bounce. The original plan was to add more fiat to get my average entry lower if we dip into the 5k range, but now I'm not so sure. Looking back, I didn't really have much of a plan B for this trade. I seriously regret not taking some profits at 6.7k now.

it might be my bullish bias, but this looks like it really wants to break out

So here is a fun thing to think about.

This Friday is Friday the 13th. To most people its an unlucky day, so people will expect BTC to dump. So there might be an opportunity for a short squeeze.

That said, the last BGD we got also happened on Friday the 13th(April 13th). So we'll see if history repeats itself, or if it decides to use that date to go to goblin town 
Currently I am waiting to see if the bulls can break with volume and hold $6380 which is the daily middle bollinger band, but let's say $6400 for a nice psychological number to open a long position. if $6200 breaks it will be a very good opportunity to short for 5k target where the next major support is. ($5700 will be tetsed one too many times imo to hold). Daily RSI currently sitting at 44.

Probably there are many ppl watching how this channel plays out.

RSI on 2/4H suggest there is some room above this support.

A couple more 4h candles above this support and it will look like we are bouncing off.

EDIT: wedge->channel

What if i told you we are going to print another 12hr inside bar?
https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-regarding-establishment-task-force-market-integrity-consumer-fraud/

> securities and commodities fraud, as well as other corporate fraud, with particular attention to fraud affecting the general public; digital currency fraud; money laundering, including the recovery of proceeds; health care fraud; tax fraud; and other financial crimes;

Seeing as how crypto is built on a foundation of fraud, this doesn't sound like good news.
This was the "bounce?" Short this thing. We got alot of room to go down.
I remember back in the good old days on the BitcoinTalk boards, every so often some dufus would brag about how he had more money than anybody and would short Bitcoin to zero. He always got rekt, obviously. 

Big Shorty never changes. He's like that fighter that gets in the ring with the champ, thinking he's the one that's gonna take the belt. Sometime in the first five rounds he gets knocked to the mat, gets up on the eight count, and starts flailing wildly. The champ dances around him like, "Do I really have to hit this punch drunk fool again?" 

Then Big Shorty punches himself out, and the champ puts him out of his misery. This latest Big Shorty has made it six rounds. Better than the dude last September (who dumped us from 5K to 3K in a month) but nowhere near the 15-round slugfest the Gox guys gave us. Looks to me like he's going down in the seventh or eighth round.

Trade accordingly. 
The stage was set by the very best of the very best and still Short Bus couldn't dump it more than ten bucks. I was only trying to help the retail short suckers who listened to the sockpuppet a-holes on this sub to exit gracefully and perhaps not look like dingus morons in the eyes of their heirs. 

My motivation here is selfless. I want to help the workin' man and woman. Nothing you do or say affects me at this point. I'm set. I'm just sayin, don't be a sucker. Your "sure thing" is to buy $12 worth of Bitcoin if that's all you can comfortably afford and forget about it for a couple years.

I'm gone from this sub and will probably delete all my comments pretty soon. Bye y'all. Fuck the Man. He's an a-hole.
What do you Guys think of Palmbeachconfedential? Are they a trusted source? They are claiming a Bitcoin ETF gets approved in the near future.

While you guys are fantasizing on goblins, this sideways movement is in perfect play with the iH&S
sell off will continue with a few spikes up to get people to buy, but the powers that be will continue to short IMO. The low we set earlier at 6280'ish will be broken to test 5800 lows...........eventually  my guess is 3000$ area, of 300$ area who knows ? One thing is sure, we wont be seeing 20K or 10K$ anytime soon.
[removed]
I'm expecting exactly the same. Nice to see it in chart form ; D
You entered a long yet Pizza? Or waiting for a lower low?
I love your TA is always. Think we’ll still be range-bound for a while, or are you just looking to scalp a buy in the sub-$6100 range?
This chart is loaded with assumptions though, "you are are" is where I got turned off. 
I went with #2 -- the forces that caused massive retail investor fomo at the tail end of 2017 should coalesce again at some point, and I think it could be even bigger the next go round as various tools and portals become easier to use and more accessible.  No idea when it will be, but anecdotally I still get asked by  'normies' (I don't like the term but it gets the point across) questions like "Is bitcoin getting hot again?"
Interesting results. I wonder if you took this poll in mid-2015, how the results would be. I remember getting downvoted for being a bull around August that year, most were sure we were headed down, some to 0.
One single vote for "Positive it won't" ...One infiltrated Butter detected... Your last chance to come out and you will be pardoned.
I was more long-term bullish until I recently started reading this sub again. Its not the discussion per se, it's how much it's changed from during the bull run. Also the low trading volume and volatility are bothering me. 
I voted I’m fairly sure it will (in a couple years). But the results of this poll clearly show people are not torn apart yet so the bear run definitely has more to go. Once 70-80 percent vote that they are fairly sure it won’t, then we can maybe talk about the end of the bear market. 
I'm somewhere between fairly sure it won't and neutral.

I'm very confident the crypto market cap will hit ATH.
Inflation adjusted ATH is what matters.  If BTC is $22K in 10 years and you can't buy a pack of gum with it, then doesn't count.
Where is the 'i don't care' option?
For those who are "positive" or "fairly sure", why aren't you all in and taking out loans to put more in?
For the long term? I'm fairly sure it'll be bullish. Short to mid term? Keep your crypto in cold storage and IGNORE these stupid Barts. It's all just noise in the short term and I'm fairly certain it'll be bearish short to mid term.
Depends where you live 
Wouldn't be surprised to not wake up tomorrow to see the same price.
Maybe. But this ridiculous price action (wash trading) is very likely to create a bigger than expected panic sell off when it breaks down. If the wash trades stopped and the market was allowed to take its quick dip, the sideline money could enter and a new rally would be underway. The longer we stay here the less trust there will be that any breakout is sustainable.
I think the current price level is similar to either 2 or maybe 3 based on your labeling, but I dont think the pattern is repeating pump for pump. 3 and 4 saw a volatility expansion back in 2014, our volatility is still contracting.
hit 9k today... I want to live in this reality
8.5k.... lol... They must have problems with money transfers so people withdraw crypto. This may push the price a bit down if real.

Looks like it's been trading on premium for a while now.
Any idea what's going on? 

Didn't see anything about them via cursory Googling news, but am I reading correctly that they're showing $8+k USD/BTC? 

Reminds me when Gox had wildly divergent prices before disappearing (although prices were artificially low, if I recall correctly). 
Good catch.
> a shady history as of half year ago

More like 4 years.  Lost so much shit with them.
so no more bans and police raiding exchanges? sounds good to me.

!Remindme in few days or when btcusd is @resistance
"The vote of confidence from the KBA"

"The Korea Block Chain Association announced the results of the first self-regulation review"

Um, the KBA was put together by the exchanges themselves. The government's had fuck all to do with this revelation. 
The only reason BTC is holding where it is, is because of the constant selling of alts to BTC. Once that stops, BTC will tumble again just like earlier today. Take a look at EOS for example

So it will either go up or down?

edit: I don't see an ascending triangle. Here's the part without any helper lines. The bottom border I could see. But on the top you'd need *a lot* of fantasy to see it... It's all over the place.


https://i.imgur.com/86Hbs67.png
one of us will make it
This actually might end up being a winning trade. I think we may go down a bit. Hoping so because I want to add to my long.
Ok anti-McAffee
They expect many institutional desks to open this year. They also expect regulatory clarity for an eventual ETF.
Them declaring it as possible is just as silly, or not silly, as yourself declaring it impossible. 

Why are there so few $600 predictions? That's silly/not silly too. 
google search algo uses your previous searches and visited web pages... your own hopium is presented back to you.
I think it’s a well established fact that btc will be smashing new ATHs by the end of the year.
Ha ha. You may be castrato by end of the year.

At some point, we're going to double in a 30-day period, and all kinds of things can happen after that. 

Also seems like somebody has a lot of coins to buy back. Could get very interesting in the next three months.
You promise?
Chewy you are a gentleman and a scholar and human like the rest of us, I'm sure you'll make even better trades in the future

Edit: not hating on the last trade at all because I was almost in the same boat 
There you go it's a fine entry.

I think it would be a mistake to overtrade the upcoming price action. I am short and I am going to let it ride down as I monitor the (paltry) volume during retraces.
I wouldn't sweat the early exit, a lot of people got tricked with that ~6850 double top
Weekly TD is on a 9, don't you think we could have some more upward? I know we printed a local lower low but I am a bit sceptical now..
If it heads down, profit taking at 6k? Orrrr holding it because you think we’re likely to go into the 5s again
What is a red 9?
>  And its almost like they feel entitled to cheaper Bitcoin but they weren't smart enough to buy last summer

☝️
I mean...you can buy and sell more than once...
Haha. Last summer? 

All that matters is that they're smart enough to buy (not sell) now. Big Shorty just burned a lot of coins and moved the price... precisely nowhere. We are in a reversal, and all the TA disciples are about to learn to zoom out and see the bull pennant.

I think I just saw Big Shorty's knees buckle.
It's not going to happen in the next five minutes or not going to happen in the next five years?

Anyway, whether the price goes to $5K in the next few months has very little  importance in trading decisions today.
Like one guy said he buy below 5k. Who knows maybe he did buy last summer and also sold the top and sub 5k is where he will reload or maybe he is buying right now in secret? The trend is down and that is the next support level after 5800.
Also great in roulette. If you see 4 blacks in a row, bet on red.
He had a short at 6600 that he closed and I think has since then been out of position.

Edit: this was a short prior to the BGD to 6800
I think you should use /u/_chewtoy_

He said he probably will, but we dropped hard and stopped here, I'd say he thinks this isn't a good place or time to short, there's a possibility it'll break up.

Edit: lol, can't summon him cause underscores do italic :-D
It's a fetal Bart gestating.

Looks like a pretty standard bear pennant to me?
Looks somewhat like an ascending triangle in the 4hr (Binance). Probably just what I want to see though. 
Whale says "up."
People point to shapes on graphs to justify their current position.  
The price keeps going down, and everyone wins 
It had to happen at some price point. Why not this one?
I agree with this to a certain extent, but I think it has to be the wrong message to the majority of traders. What about those who are stubbornly holding underwater positions and ignoring better advice?

In the distribution of trading ability, only the few at the top will be reliably making money no matter the direction of the market. Shouldn't the rest of traders be listening to what those at the top say?

A trader who is able to recognize superior market hypothesies to their own and change their position accordingly should do better than those who aren't.

Of course, there are other factors to keep in mind. If you find yourself flip-flopping a lot, you'll probably lose money. And closing out a winning position because you're unsure is different than closing a losing position out of fear.
Yup 100% this, you start realizing that anyone can post charts and draw lines, but it doesn't mean they actually have a clue of what's going on. Personally, I think too many people here are emotional traders and often favor bias opinions  that fit a narrative while at the same time bury their heads in the sand when presented with evidence that counters their view.

Edit: Think like a scientist and keep your mind open to new ideas, question everything and everyone, and separate facts from opinions 
Impaired? Biased? Those are calm words for when I buy ..I an immediate schizophrenia come on 
Agreed. I was pretty pessimistic the other day, but now I'm not so sure. Regardless, it's a good lesson in patience and perspective. The nature of Reddit and 24/7 chatroom-esque atmosphere is not conducive to measured, objective, longterm mindstates. 
I thought the consecutive green weeklys would assure us some more upwards movement. If we somehow sustain these levels, then an inverse H&S is still in play. I just really doubt we hold this support. 
You guys are what the newer traders should aspire to be. $20k in one trade? Lawd Hammercy. My goal is to one day be an accredited investor but first, I have to clear this debt and create a good foundation to build off of. 
Good shot Mike.

Step back and see what's going on... sounds good
What kind of leverage do you use? 
4H cloud is acting nicely as support 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/oIwSaePa/

A long here with stops below purple line/ bottom of cloud is a great R/R. If we break below that i expect a fall to the $6k-6100 range 
> longs keep opening and shorts keep closing

sounds to me like there is alot of buying pressure.


I agree with your post, however keep in mind those long stats can be manipulated (which I'm suspecting is happening).
Is this data for mex, finex or both?
pain = underwater?
mana = profit?

I dont really understand the long short health here, there is more short mana than shorts outstanding
Many of those longs can be from people closing and relonging lower or DCA The only thing that metric shows is concurrent longs but we can't know how underwater they are. It's dynamic, people are closing and others opening longs constantly it's not the same longs locked in place since may 1st. 
Those old longs held all the way down to 5800, so we'd need to get news lows to squeeze them out. Lots of longs started closing at 6700-6800 and they kept closing all the way down to 6300. Now some have opened again. We also have some shorts entering positions down here. Both sides taking positions again before a move and either side could get squeezed.

What about the bullish rsi divergences?
Tokenized securities is what I'm holding out for, don't care if it takes a few years 
There are plenty of good indicators and signals, sounds like you just don't like their message. Good luck resisting the fomo later on. 
> It's frustrating that the people involved in the industry don't understand how to foster confidence. 

Only the alts have sales people, and they are all 100% scam. Bitcoin doesn't need it as it's your own loss if you don't understand the market.
So... you sold all and move away from crypto market?
A tradewar could lead to serious economic downfall. If we look at anything close to a recession it will be very bad for crypto. People will have to pull out to protect their assets. 

First of all institutions and investors will not look to invest in riskier assets during economic uncertainty and secondly people allready invested with a plan to hold until the next upturn in the market will need their funds and have to sell to access it. People holding on at 80% losses will need the remaining 20% and be forced to cash out at a loss. 
In all honesty a tradewar is most likely not great for the crypto asset space in general given traditional investment guidelines. It is limiting to the free flow of goods and services which in itself is contractionary. Contractionary variables tend to hurt corporate profits (see: comparative advantages) thus everybody essentially loses. Contractionary times tend to push investors to be more risk-averse (i.e.: they don't want to take on as much risk as they would in a 100% free-market). 


But it's bitcoin and unprecedented, so IDK flip a coin.

Bitcoin is a great safe haven from a trade war because it's global and not tied to any nation state. I will be moving more of my fiat into Bitcoin also.
Considering it's hard to predict the consequences and developments of the trade war, and that Bitcoin doesn't really have any historical exposure to global financial downturns, I don't think we can make very informed predictions.

My gut feeling is Bitcoin benefits from economic /political uncertainty, but there's also the argument that speculative assets like Bitcoin are the first to go when the economy goes south.

Basically, both Trump and Bitcoin are way too disruptive and unpredictable to have any clue what's coming. 
> this tradewar crap should be pretty bullish, no?

Why? This is rolled out fairly regularly with no particular reasons. 
Tradewar crap doesnt matter to bitcoin imo. This ETF news is also meh, but probably more relevant. An economic downturn or sustained legacy bear market would drag bitcoin down with it IMO, unless bitcoin had *really* bottomed already.
Is that a take profit for 100% of your position. If so, your r/r doesn't look great on paper.

Edit: missed the part about possibly bailing at 6.6k.
I'd go with stops above 6425 and reshort higher.
Yeah, this is pretty much exactly where I'm at.

$6600 seems too low a stop due to erratic wicking, but if it believably pumps up there, I'd probably bail as well. But I'd be very surprised if we don't have further down to go. Maybe not today, but I'm expecting to wait a week or so for it. 
Tuff short... Good luck.

Heard it was GDAX either stress testing or faking volume.
Thanks for posting this. These macro views put so much into perspective. While looking at the market at this level, it’s so easy to be short+mid-term bearish (I agree with your ~$4k prediction) but *incredibly* bullish long-term.

I know it's just one guy and anecdotal blah blah blah but this is what I mean. No price is too low to sell when real money that people want/need is on the line

I’ll submit but it feels wrong as this used to be /u/SloppySynapses ‘s thing

Edit: also lack of 7k -8k region has me sad 😞
I'm putting down 5-6k region.

I don't think the bottom has been found yet.  But this market has also proven that it is going to go down slowly in fits and starts, not quickly.

!RemindMe 2 Months "Was I right?  Current price 6.37k, est 5-6k"
What a crap. This poll has no value 
Lol too soon man fuck
That's a very binary echo type comment... Literally.
Looks like a bear pennant 
I’m not sure why you’re getting downvoted. I mostly agree, though I wouldn’t be surprised if we continue our slow decline for a few months to sub-$5k prices to allow big players to accumulate. However, it looks like most of the volatility is leaving the market at the moment. This is a bullish sign to me, as I agree with jarederaj that periods of low volatility generally lead to new bullish cycles. Good luck to you. I wouldn’t enter any high leverage longs, but it’s not a bad idea to start DCA’ing into bitcoin if you’re looking for a long-term hold imo.
Lmao I’m sorry man, you’re so wrong. Either way stay above 6260 or it’s going to test 6k or possibly lower. 6.26 has been tested like 5 times and it’s held each one at that exact point. Under it is no mans land. I am leaning towards a breakout upwards but I’m shorting on margin if that support falls through. 
is this the value of shorts + longs combined? how do we check for the value of each otherwise?
It keep bounce off 6300 lol. I thought we already break it. Is someone trying to prevent the inevitable?
Every time we bounce it will get weaker.
Nice Lows... So next Low is 6800$?
use 'update' command
Same, Tethered at 6290. I’m a bit underwater but it’s only part of my stack and I still think we go lower short term.


Edit: Ok it might have been a bad choice. Just to be safe I’m gonna buy back some of my BTC as a hedge.
On the contrary, 6H cloud made a bullish twist just a couple candles ago... Mixed signals for sure.
I suspect change in strategy and counterbart initiatives. 
Would be rallies? Are you kidding? There hasn't been a pump. Would be dumps are getting bitch slapped. You'll know it when we rally because Big Shorty will be out of coins and unable to defend. You'll see a big volume spike and a studly green candle. There hasn't been a volume spike since last night's LRD got engulfed.

Yeah.. if only BTC followed those
I remember reading this post. You were one of the few whose line of thought aligned with mine when many were bullish, and I remember feeling better about my then-underwater short position thanks to your post.
Yes, *this*, 100%!!!

-every person with a short position right now
People are trying so hard to sell the narrative that BTC follows ETH.  It is a possible BTC attack vector I won't believe without mathematical analysis.  
It has been a looong time since I have seen that many green walls on gdax/coinbase pro. 
I was watching that...  but who knows really, buddy could be doing some weird washing.  There was some monster market sells into those buy walls, not a bunch of small organic sells.
I dunno...these walls don't look real to me.  They are always conveniently placed a few dollars away from the actual price, so when you zoom in on the aggregator, you find theres actually no true contact buying pressure, but the sells stack up in the 100's just nearby
I think we will grind in this range for a few days. The only support that matters is 5700. If that fails, i think it will get ugly. 
Time to go ^up^up^up^up^up^up^up^up^up^up


Should post this in one of those humble brag subs. 
does this have any Insight for traders or is it just to speak out your own justification for Selling? 
This is the second post I've seen from hodlers like you cashing out. The one from yesterday was a dude who bought in early 2017 IIRC. Interesting.  
Great Kraster!!
Were there no other options for that 20%, like a low interest rate loan?  This is a really bad place to cash that out forever.  That 6,000% profit will easily be 12,000% with even weak market action.

Isn't this connected somehow to BTC-e insane premium?
cmc has it at 1.01, i guess it depends on how you calculate it

Wex.nz has some fiat or solvency problems, they increased USD withdrawals to 20% fee. BTC trading for $8-9k and USDT/USD for $1.3-$1.6.

edit: apparently [France filed a extradition request too](https://www.ethnews.com/france-joins-us-and-russia-in-seeking-extradition-of-vinnik-for-btc-e-fraud) for Alexander Vinnik:

> French authorities allege that while Vinnik has been held in a Greek jail pending a final decision on a possible extradition, he remained in charge of the BTC-e platform, which has defrauded thousands of people, including French citizens.

They were in [court today](https://www.cnn.gr/news/kosmos/story/138299/tin-paraskeyi-i-apofasi-gia-ton-mr-bitcoin-eisaggeleas-eisigeitai-tin-ekdosi-toy-sti-gallia) and on Friday there will be a decision.

Perhaps this is related to their USD withdrawal methods being blocked again or something like that.

edit2: and they just added BTC/USDT 9h ago and tomorrow there is a 2h maintenance.
Your finding too much signal in this low volume noise. 
Historically, we upvote bullish posts!

Not an expert in finance/economics in the slightest, but isn't every $ of the Bitcoin price reflecting a "real" amount of fiat that has entered the market?

I agree about the sense of unreality on the part of longterm holders, but all of their/our "unreal" gains have been generated via "real" money that someone somewhere contributed, right? 
It wasn't that long ago that we'd see something like this and meme out a BTFD.

Is it that hard to believe that we've been riding the bottom of our current trend:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/ULq5EijJ/

RSI is low, BBand width is lowish. There aren't a lot of similar market conditions to compare this to. Smells like we're near a bottom, even if we haven't seen it yet.

I think a short has bad R/R here.
Why keep buying if price keeps getting rejected at $6400
We got rejected like 6 times at 6400 and tested 6300 only 3 times.
They are pussy's
We've also tested 5800 recently. So a lot of the people selling at 6300 are selling assuming we will retest below 6k. 
When talking about IHS, is it Bart's head or some random homosapien sapiens dude?
Something isn't right. Keep bouncing off 6300 Jesus. Some huge whale is lurking down there.
Aw, gee... how sweet. Bulls DGAF much like Honeybadger. But thanks for rooting for us! It's kinda like being a Yankees fan, I guess -- super safe but not nearly as painfully sweet as being a Mets fan. 
Just focus on the Austrian and you’ll be fine ;)
[removed]
half of it is priced in.
I was expecting another 10 months before this.
yes and no.
Continuous rejections usually lead to more downside.
Is that true? Or could you also say eventually people have to give up testing 6400 and let it drop? (Not saying that will just happen - just don't see your logic) 
And about 3 or 4 for 6300.

It's loading the spring.  I don't think it's worth trying predict which way it'll go by examining those boundaries.  But the range of the boundaries can help you do your RR for stops and entries and take-profits.
> Now watch 4 more ~~hours~~ months of sideways now...
I have played this game many times--set loose stops and tight alarms and go the fuck to bed
We're headed down to test 6150 support once the alt selloff is done.
maybe you clicked the eye icon on volume indicator, top left corner of the chart?
Sweet dreams :)
FWIW Bitmex Sept discount has grown.

Not reading into it, just taking advantage of it.
It cant even go back to 6400 lol the longer we stay in this range the more likely the direction for a while is down.
The logical place to take profit on the long will be resistance at $6800. So your profit would be $300. Therefore, if you want a 1:1 risk:reward, the stop should be at $6200?
>it might be my bullish bias

Bingo
People will expect BTC to dump because Friday the 13th is UNLUCKY?!?
What kind of idiot people are you talking about? 
Everyone is cashing out for Friday the 13th
Wait till after ~~CNY~~ Friday the 13th... so much money is gonna roll in.
The BGD was on the 11th...
Now that you've noticed the last BGD happened was on a Friday the 13th it's sure to do the exact opposite
FWIW, Friday the 13th (April 13th) was a Tuesday.


Lol bull anything

Not sure I am understanding you...isn't that an ascending channel/bear flag? 
That is literally not a formation 
this is no wedge more like a channel which its not either. need more than 2 points of contact M8
Perhaps this will encourage more people to flee to BTC for safety. I dunno how people are okay with leaving tens of millions of dollars in fiat and crypto on exchanges.

But perhaps whales got like 20% of their stack on exchanges and no big deal if they lose access to the funds.
Doesn't sound like anything that is going to move the needle -- it's wrapped up with all that other blah blah blah, and sounds like it's mostly aimed at the outright scams.

Buy SALT up to $20 with no stop loss - Palm Beach Report

Up to now they still recommend buying up to $20 and apparently they never gave a sell-order on SALT.
They are not a scam although they tend to hype things a bit. They have a good team with more inside information that the average cryptogroup. They are usually right about the direction of prices for particular coins in a Bull market, not so much in a bear market.
They've been banging on about an ETF "any month now" for at least a year. When it didn't happen, Teeky (think that's the name of PBC's main guy) changed tack and started comparing BTC to the nasdaq's performance in the nineties and using that as their new overarching thesis as to why BTC and alts were all "must buys!!". When that meme fails, they'll find something else. Basically they're permabulls and use crypto enthusiasm to hawk their paid newsletter (which is essentially a glorified pump and dump group)
Might be time to up the quality of your posts, mate!
Sorry dude, your posts have stopped being amusing. Welcome to the Block Club.

Ideally I'll ride the position right back up to 6800 and I'll unload again there and hedge short with stop outside of the range. Something has to give soon enough but for now I think the daily block is good for a bouncy bouncy. Many struggle with trading a range because they are accustomed to trend following but trading a range gets you some excellent R/R plays. Even if I'm completely wrong my losses are minimal and it's on to the next setup that the market presents. 
Where does the chart/post say "you are are"

Also, my "assumptions" seem to be working out pretty great considering I caught the top/bottom of a nearly 18% move within 15$ 

*sips tea*
Mine is the opposite.  I usually get made fun of with “your bitcoin thing took a shit again, huh?”...but inside I count it as a positive because it means they’re still watching.
that poll is from traders, traders are a bit less liberal in handing out "this will never go up"

go ask the normies on the street, and you'll get your 70-80%
If $22k won't buy a pack of gum in ten years, we're looking at a Mad Max dystopian situation but BTC will be doing very well.
Haha you know that's not the point :P 
They are invested already.. they're probably buying the dips too. and they have to stay solvent...can't just blow everything in the next year if they think it'll take 3 years 
Because I dont know how much it will go down before going up so right now *might* not be a good time to buy. Nobody knows tho
Fucking short sellers with the relentless "it has to go down before it can go up narrative".  Like damage is somehow happening now because they can't get the lower price that they want.  The reality is that the price might go down but trying to brainwash people to sell off is fucked up.  
I bet you can transfer your BTC there and sell for this price ;-)
same old story, fiat withdrawals are non-existent there. 
things might go boom soon-ish. 
well, i don't know exact details, but they surely seem screwed up now.

Yea, noticed it too. After the Alt sell off yesterday, BTC immediately tank a few hours later. Might be a similar case here. I was gonna close my short from 6800 when that bounce happened, but then again I get reminded of that dreadful volume and lack of buyer. I will let this ride for a while. Since the drop from 8k7 to here, when the major volume picks up, it's the sell one. Something is really fishy about this market.
yeah my thoughts exactly yesterday

but now alts are recovering and btc is stable - not sure what to make of that

From May 5 to June 28, the past was a pretty good indicator of the future as it just stair-stepped down over and over.
Also consider it could pass through a wormhole and/or one of the numerous dimensions implied by string theory!

Any consolidation pattern can break in either direction that's why you wait for confirmation, I gave specific parameter for the setup to play out. The triangle top is easier see on the 30 min XBT: https://imgur.com/a/PRmDLbK

Lol, yup.

Remember I'm hedged from above 6.5, if this breaks 6.4 I'll still exit at be.

This one isn't closed yet.

I've learned my lesson from closing my 5800 long too early at 6300's. Grow a pair and hodl my position with SL instead of overtrading, especially when I'm in the money. (I'm short currently)
ya, it was more annoying than anything else. 

The move up that kicked me out was quite sudden and violent, and I was a bit surprised to see it stop so abruptly. 

C'est la vie.
While true, we need to close the weekly below 6.4k to confirm that so a short isn't an awful idea here. At least, the TD count isn't quite a reason to *not* short yet.
Holding it indefinitely more likely than not. 

If the market dips below $5,500, it should be quite some time before we see $6,000+ again.

I’ve found the indicator works best on higher time frames and when a 9 closes you tend to get a bleeding effect. In this case, if it were to close on Sunday as is we will see lower lows progress through July passing 5700. https://www.tradingview.com/x/zzs2FQgw/
means we've been going down for a while so it could possibly go up lol 
Tell that to my dec futures.
the suspense is killing me
Difference is that previous price action certainly does influence future price action - just not in easily predictable ways. The more a market goes up, the more likely it is to turn around and vice versa. TD9 is one way to filter and measure that.

In roulette, each spin is completely independent. Obviously.
That's a bit of a false equivalence. Roulette is memoryless. Markets are not, and indeed, are reflexive.

You're probably right . I'm just holding out a little hope because the top trend line is pretty straight in my chart. 
I mean technically he's not wrong lol
Lol this is Great.
I meant the three little dots above at the top of the screen on the home bitcoinmarkets page. or are people still using slack?
Completely true, people act like you can’t tell the difference reading a professional analysis by a experienced trader who is breaking down all of the hows and whys and someone saying BITCOIN $7500 TOMORROW and drawing a line. I do not trade much bitcoin, but I’m very involved in altcoin markets and obviously I use BTC to cash out and am often holding a stack of it for alt trading. So you guys’ analysis is very interesting to sift through and their are people who are consistently posting HQ, accurate predictions in these threads you just need to know what to look for. 
Following the moves of another trader is no way to ensure long term success. The best traders in the world could publish their strategies in the newspaper and most still wouldn’t succeed. A trader’s faculties are more responsible for his success than his strategy. My post touched on the psychological aspect of trading, with the assumption the reader has some knowledge of trading already. The most basic being: use a stop loss to minimize your losses.
Yeah, the scientific mindset is seriously lacking in this sub.

I am way too new to this space to know what methods/indicators are valid and to what extent, but the longer I hang around the more I recognize TA groupthink with virtually no justification provided beyond "This famous trader said it works" or "It's worked for me lately". Maybe they have a lot of study and backtesting and serious statistical calculations built into their posts, but I rarely see any EVIDENCE of it.

Not knocking TA outright - but I know humans have a tendency to get hypnotized by the illusion of Serious Scientific wisdom when they see numbers and charts and complicated words. There is wisdom out there, but none gained easily.

Again, I know almost nothing about trading beyond my (surprisingly successful) instincts, but I am familiar with mathematical rigor and healthy skepticism. This comment is directed towards the other noobs who might be intimidated by self-styled experts into following unsupported herd folk wisdom. 
I consciously tell myself that I'm more capable than anyone else here when it comes to reading the market. Of course, there's plenty of people here much smarter than me, but it keeps my mind on track to give no one's TA and thoughts more importance than my own.

I didn't sell off my coin.  I'm not short selling either.  But I am frustrated by the market.  It trades sideways for a week and then bgd and then trades sideways and then breaks down and does it again.  For months and months.  
Well, that's only one part of the equation, the other part is that economic downturns leads to people withdrawing  their money invested in traditional financial instruments. Options then are cash and crypto. In some countries the local fiat currency is declining rapidly during a global downturn. In these countries it would pay to park savings in crypto. Crypto is also easier to move around if need be.
That is valid only if you broke the first rule of crypto - don't invest more than what you can afford to lose.
It may be (as is my hunch), or it may not be. If a majority of investors get spooked and price tanks, it's not safe. Since we've never experienced "Bitcoin + trade war", claiming to definitely know the other end of that equation is invalid. 
Because they are good and easy to win. 
The argument, I believe, would be that much of Bitcoin's value comes from belief in its being a good, secure store of wealth (ala gold), so the more worried people are about the health of macro economies, the more attractive Bitcoin becomes. (and, of course, the belief that trade warring will harm - or at least damper - economic growth) 

Not sure if I completely buy the argument, but I think that's how it goes. 
Not good r:r numerically... but I have a high level of confidence that we see lower $6's before higher $6's and willing to wait it out (don't like being tied to the screen).

Like I said, I'll probably exit if we get a strong move above $6600 (which seems unlikely right now).
Thing is... I could see this spiking to $6450 only to double back over... I prefer to trade slower waves so I'm not tied to the screen... hence the liberal stops.  
I think there's likely [another leg down here](https://www.tradingview.com/x/h9Q73f3S/) before buyers step back in
That's a weak resistance compared to the support level, but that doesn't mean shorts cant win.
Same...he did a while just now around the 6365 mark and again now lower. Perhaps a signal of some sort? Considering the trades are going in seconds after each other, if he wanted to just take the book he could have done with that trade volume.
Correct.
A lot of people who bought in at 1k (or even less) still have sizeable long term HODL stacks that they will hold until the end. This is because they have already taken profit and taken profit etc and their HODL stacks are pure profit. They believe in the future value of BTC and its use cases. 
no worries man
[deleted]
Totally fair and excellent example of what you’ve been talking about. If there are a lot more people like Moon, then I totally get your point brotha. Is there were a way to track the coins that were bought at those levels that haven’t moved since they were bought?  
moon's a wise man, but I don't think his price entry points in the future will help anyone much.

If we shot to $7k tomorrow... he'd probably buy in...

If we slowly bled to $4k over the next year and seemed like a solid low around that price... he'd probably buy in...

Not trying to speak for him... just saying future price entry points should be irrelevant to good traders.
Reality hit that I entered when BTC was only 1-2k, and that it might actually get down another few grand. I'd seriously consider entering around 3-4k, but the reality is that less than 1 year ago it was well below the price it is today, so I have to take chips off the table. This hurts, because I could have walked away with much more, but then again I could have walked away with much less. 
$20K.
Its unusual to see someone quote Occams razor without then defining it after in the same sentence.
Yes I'm surprised by that as well. One thing that always consistently impresses me about crypto is just how bullish the sentiment can be even in the face of a brutal 7 month downtrend with no end in sight.
Whoops, I forgot to add it :(
So do you think it's only going to go as far down at 5-6k? Or will it go below that range and then return to the 5-6k region?
No one ever said it did?
Lol. I'm just having fun. I hope he doesn't take the wrong way, good on him!
What makes you think I'm wrong? My post if filled with evidence that suggests we are nearing a bottom. If you have counter points, by all means, bring them up. That's the whole reason I post here. To have my analysis critiqued so I can make better decisions. But, yeah, another few weeks of sideways and this will pretty much be confirmed as a bottom. Regardless, I am hedging against myself, by DCA'ing. If it does fall through then it will be doing it soon, so I'm hoping to have fiat for buys further down. I would like to have as low of a CA as possible. And if we make a new low I probably will take out a hedge short for my current coins on Mex through future contracts.
It is both. Every contract consist of one seller and one buyer.
$5750 is $100b market cap. it's too round for me to think someone isn't trying to protect it 🧐

Could be total coincidence though 
Bears are not finished yet.
Well... OK to stay above the 6300. But let's wait 24Hours. When then OK. We can get a pop up.
You could say that about the dumps over the past month -- progressively weaker. And that next engulfing BGD is always just around the corner.
Opened your profile just to see how much karma you have left for shitposting :D
Any tutorial on how to use this command?
I got out at 6300 on perps. Looks like we sold the bottom wick of that 15 min candle. lol
I don't know. It's looking droopy as hell, but 6300 is being defended pretty well all things considering. This is starting to feel like the flag we painted in the 7k region. Could be a while before it fully plays out. 
> counterbart initiatives

I like that, gives it kind of a military vibe. Picturing something like the Great Escape but our heroes are crypto traders. 
Dude? You said few weeks ago it is reversal and bull run started! I took loan and put 10x at 6500 :(((
never 4get diydude opened a short at $9.9k (not joking)
lol, I think he forgot to switch his accounts.
But, in reality I am keeping my powder dry, and I think now is as good a chance as you're going to get to go short if that's your thing. Not even lyin. Not tryna incite a short squeeze or any nefarious shit like that.
Yes, except sentiment was completely opposite and CME wasn't there to fuck us.
Don't you get tired of looking for excuses to support your cognitive bias? Wouldn't you rather not have a bias? Don't care if it goes up or down short term, I mean.
Where would you set your buys at if I may ask?
To be fair, bear flags tilting up looks a lot more bullish than a flat one lol. This just looks like a consolidation before continuing the trend.

what's it like reading my posts. I probably have inspired the soggiest of underwater shorters to hold their breath just a little longer smh
The key is looking into if it's true regardless of the desires of those market participants. 

Of course we all want the price to go our way
Sorry but its true, and im not shorting
I wasn't suggesting ETH was leading BTC.  Just that if you look at the ETHBTC chart next to the BTCUSD chart.  The pumps coincide, ie ETH often pumps a bit harder.

So i like to look for setups on ETHBTC as an additional indicator that a BTCUSD pump might be coming.  That's all!

EDIT: Am now aware that I did a rubbish job of conveying that in the original post
Seriously. Just seeing triple-digit walls (with 2.50 aggregation) is a big change. Not much price movement though.

thanks bucky, keep your soul bullish as always and i will keep mine. still convinced we will get another ath in the future. btc is here to stay. 
i really like your long term strategy and i think it will work pretty well in the long run.
Maybe you are right but I don't feel good  taking a 100k loan at the age of 30. I've got a good job honestly but I don't trust the banking system so I prefer not to take any debts.

Ive tried to pay directly with btc but the architect that follow the renovation doesn't accept it. Shame on him xD. 
Yeah and it could also turn into 3000% profit with weak market action

He said, offering no factual evidence (eg, longs piling up) or abstract/logical/mathematical reasoning whatsoever. 
Lol like your "dumper almost out of ammo" argument holds anymore merit
I’m just giving an educated guess based on trends in the past couple months and our support areas. We have reached two local highs (from relief rallies) in the past 2 months. Once at $8.6k in May and then $7.6k in June. Both local highs then had a 20-21 percent dump before a nice relief rally. If this follows the same trend, we hit our local high at $6.8k and a 20 percent dump leads to a price of $5.4k to go long at. 
Probably!
But you are ignorant and uneducated for sure!
😧

I’ll assume you’re not European, African, or South American.
~~There should be a systemic shockwave from this. Alt markets could collapse if the price of tether keeps going up.~~

~~8% discount on all CC now.~~

~~This could be that "bank run" I've been warning about.~~
Hrm... I should have checked them. Looks like there's just disruption across some exchanges. I'm not sure I trust CMC's ability to report this accurately, though. I stopped using them because I didn't trust how they were aggregating market cap.
So how much volume is necessary for the signal to noise ratio to improve?
> but isn't every $ of the Bitcoin price reflecting a "real" amount of fiat that has entered the market?

No, it reflects the direction an orderbook went when the spread filled up after orders were executed.

Imagine if someone bought the next $100 of asks, and someone else sold into the next $100 of bids, and no new orders were placed in that range.  Now there is a $200 gap to fill.  It could fill 100% on one side, and the price could be now be $100 more or $100 less than before, yet an equal amount of money could have been spent on the previous round of buy/sell, for a potential net 0 increase of "real" money in the market.

Now imagine that on a micro scale.

It's about a price people will pay, not about a sumation of value.
Well that's the question, I might be totally wrong in my assumption. 

But just because you bought 100 BTC for 100$ some years ago, the market value if only one is sold for 1000$ is now changed. Then you could trade those for some alt coins, then back to BTC and so on. Since a lot of trading goes on on the exchanges , people do not put much real capital in.

Compared to stocks you always "exit" in dollars, there is no or very small market for AMZN-FB for example
I'd rather take a hit on my short to see reversal than close it just to see the bottom is nowhere near.
I don't think it's going below 5700 right now, probably not even below 6k. But it's likely going to be a long equilibrium in this range for a couple of weeks. I wouldn't short here no, but I did short 6800 and I'm not closing it yet and I'll add around 6450 if we get there. 

Daily stochastic still has some way to go too. https://www.coinigy.com/s/i/5b4680c0b58d5/

But I don't think this is the real bottom. And I sure as hell know this isn't the bottom if I look at Bitcoin from a macro economic perspective and I encourage people to look at it that way. Global markets and economies are slowing with EM, China and Europe leading the pack and the USA following late Q3 and Q4 in 2018. Why wouldn't Bitcoin suffer the same fate as other commodities/currencies/stocks? It's behaving exactly like them, topping around January and being in a downtrend ever since. A strong dollar = weak Bitcoin and the real dollar rally is only getting started. The joke is that there's plenty of stocks to find that have crashed harder than Bitcoin. People should start shorting financials (especially European) instead of Bitcoin, that's the moral thing to do :D 
Ask someone who is buying.
Because....price will be 10k in November. 

Because it's your last chance to take advantage of bargain-basement prices. In a year it will be, *why the FUCK did I not buy Bitcoin when it was only 6k!* 
only correct answer thus far
I’ve seen a whale with repeated 300-400 BTC orders trying to keep the price up on the Finex order books (because that’s what I watch all the time). If that whale hasn’t driven the price up by now, then we should be in for a dump but we will see. 
And all that being said, I think a quick short scalp is a good bet at this point in time. Just don't be greedy.
What is this? A pump for ants? A pump needs to be at least ...three times bigger then this.
On point.
Not in Bitcoin. The sellers run out of coins eventually. Buyers are obviously still buying.

It really depends on how many coins this dumper has left and when he has to cover. But we're not going under 6k. Many billions are waiting to buy at that level at this point, quite obviously. 
He's just rationalizing his desires ;)
Idk man we are on a red 9 on the 4h chart. But then again 3 hours before candle closes. There is a possibility we pierce through ichimoku cloud and test 0.618 which is the 6150 area you mentioned 
Nope. Idontkmow why ill just figure it out
Problem is, 6200 is probably going to get hit before 6800. It's a matter of how much OP is willing to commit to defending his position...
I think I fooled myself into thinking that 7k+ is almost guaranteed before the end of September when opening this position. This was supposed to be a long term trade so I don't spend all day watching graphs and order books.
the dumps are happening on lower and lower volume and any move below $6,300 gets instantly recovered 

of course could be wrong...only time will tell
Wonder what would happen to comments like this if/when it dumps to sub-5K?
um I'm guessing you are new, and weren't here when 7777 and 8888 Yuan were counted as major resistance/support points because those numbers are lucky for the chinese

Yeah, ascending channel. Sorry for naming it wrong.  Well, the main idea is that probably we are starting to climb from this point. Either channel support or horizontal support, no matter how I name it. I will probably close my short.

yeah, actually channel. of course 2 points is not enough,

I don't recall this at all. I think this is the first time Teeka's been 100% certain about a ETF.
http://www.letmegooglethat.com/?q=Bitcoin+inverse+head+and+shoulders+history
what's their to explain ? Basic TA from bearish point of view. Which in case you haven't realized we have been bearish for the last 7 months now.
Chill out dude 5555 It's anybody's guess, TA as you know is not a given ! so it can go either way, but I'm still bearish as I have been for many months.
I'd prefer BTC to go up but unlike so many others I'm not attached to it, it is a tradeable instrument, nothing more, nothing less, so have no issues shorting it which is btw what traders do in a bear market.
Bring back kush!
I've been browsing buttcoin for at least 4 years and let me tell you it's almost no better than OP.  It's been invaded by a bunch of rabid leftists who unironically share the same views as OP.
I'm somewhere in that neck of the gender woods. Gender diversity ftw. 
i read this somewhere else already, where is this from ?
They should make a movie just to use this monologue in it :)
I mostly trade ranges too, so I can’t fault you for that. I think the problem is that most people generally assume if the price goes down, it will continue to go down, and vice versa. I’ve lost out on plenty of profits not riding trends, but I also haven’t lost money on a trade in a few months, so I’d rather take the security over maximizing profits since confidence is big in trading.

I hate to make predictions, but my guess was a bounce from $6300-$6480ish, then a bounce from $6100-?, then probably bleed to $5300 for another monthly bullish cycle. I guess we’ll see what the market presents though. Happy trading!
“We are here”, I stand corrected.

Anyway, that was a bit cocky - sure you want to tempt fate? Anyway, chart on. 
Fair enough, but there still has not been enough despair imo. Let’s see how people feel when Bitcoin halves in 2020 and we are still stuck in the $2-4k range. Then you will get the 70-80 percent numbers. 

Edit: The next big bull run will occur when the mainstream public has comepletley forgotten this shit. Then there will be a new herd of idiots to take us beyond upwards just like in December when we went from $10-20k.
Yes, it will be $22K and buying a pack of gum is not doing that well.
Not what I’m doing at all. I certainly wouldn’t buy at these prices. I would definitely trade at the prices. But If the price did fall, let’s say to 4900 or even low 5k most would be jumping in with their spare fiat and as holders of a substantial amount, vested in the increase. Right now, even though my HODL stack is actually down in value overall, I’m still not interested in buying. I have plenty of fiat and couldn’t care less even if the price jumped to 10k, I wouldn’t fomo in. If the price did fall, that sidelined stack of fiat would go straight into coins because the R/R of buying would be highly attractive.
Not sure if joking but don't do that, that is probably their plan, pump the price so people deposit there to arb then disappear

Well, you have only 2 points which define the top. It's a bit slim...
I will kill myself if we don’t hit 20k minimum before year ends
You didn't go with perps did you?
Do you think it can really go below $5500? There seems to be too much buy pressure at this price range, no?
Yea if that plays out we may see a green 27 
ok thanks
It's not a put option. It is futures.   You can close that position any time...or add to it.
Yeah, I know, I know, it's just a joke. I'm sure there's a lot of statistical research behind it which shows that this particular bar sequence is more likely than not to result in trend reversal based on historical data.   
   
I just prefer indicators which add some heuristic value to the chart by trying to quantify the behaviour of actual people participating in the market, rather than just pure statistical analysis. Also I think it probably has better applicability to more range-bound markets than Bitcoin.
Why
No, that's usually reserved for the position being justified. 
>virtually no justification provided beyond "This famous trader said it works" or "It's worked for me lately". Maybe they have a lot of study and backtesting and serious statistical calculations built into their posts, but I rarely see any EVIDENCE of it.

Of course not, back-testing would show that the indicators talked about in here have no predictive value, and if some combination of factors was suggested to be profitable, the trader would be a fool to post it here and have their edge crowded-out by others.

Much easier to justify directional bets with tradecraft jargon until you eventually lose and disappear from the sub--only to be replaced by the next generation of gamblers who are encouraged by the survivorship bias coming from those still spinning the wheel.
Yeah - TA can be useful, but only as one input of many, into a very complicated decision. We all use emotion to an extent, which is not *always* a bad thing. A properly informed trader has gathered LOTS of varied data over weeks and years. Just like a pro athlete channels thousands of hours of practice into intuitive split second decisions, you have to use multiple channels of understanding into a mature decision.

Of course this isn't a recommendation to rely on intuition. It's a powerful but dangerous tool - if you don't have a lot of earned confidence and historical success with your intuition, it's a hindrance. 
That's the way to do it, no matter what is said on this sub or the number of upvotes/downvotes a post has, at the end of the day, it's you who makes the trade and not other people.

I've been downvoted for being right in the past and quit frankly I don't give a shit because I made money regardless and no amount of downvotes will change that lol
That's bullshit. As your wealth increases, these 2% trades become increasingly difficult due to the natural inclination to go into profit preservation mode. Making a $100 trade is nothing like making a $1mm trade.
Seems pretty sensible to me. I lost a decent amount at first because I'd open 100x leverage positions because I'm mental. 
wash trading. Once you start assuming wash trading literally any form of analysis becomes meaningless, though. 
You can simply buy bitcoin with fiat in your margin wallet (1x leverage, so you're not taking any swaps, but it does show as USDLONG).
1d and 12hr
Yep lots of noise 
What do you want it to do?
Thats actually a very valid point which I never considered. Still not sure how many would pick crypto over usd/eur in countries with unstable currencies but its definitly a possiblity. 
Just because you can *afford* to lose it doesn't mean you're fine with losing it. Plenty of people will pull out if they feel they need to pivot towards more reliable / "safe" investments.

And obviously, plenty of people fail to follow all sorts of responsibility "rules" :p
Which we know a bunch of people did. Also what people can afford to lose in a thriving economy vs a recession is very different. 
If investors get spooked and the price tanks further it will be an even better time to buy In my "invalid" opinion. 
Yeah I'm long but expecting 24~48 hours minimum for 6600 if it comes. (not counting a momentary spike with a 50% retrace, I mean actually hovering around there for a little while or totally passing it)
If it goes up there it should go higher. It can wick above 6.4 like it did already but don't think it can wick to 6450.


Of course; I'm just pointing out that no price is too low to sell for people who have been in the scene for such a long time. I've seen arguments that these people often are the least likely to sell but i think that's a very flawed perception of their mindsets
yup although I disagree it's weak hands! It's not his fault there isn't enough demand to sustain these prices

But yes I totally agree
No idea, I wish there were. would be super interesting to see 
Have you heard of bitcoin days destroyed?  And if so, is that what you’re talking about?  As I understand it, ya basically a measurement of hoarding.  Recently heard a podcast about it.  Will try and find.
At the end of the day you won man, I know it feels like you lost when you could of sold much higher but you are in a much better position than a lot of people.
They are not bullish, they are just hoping. If most people were bullish we wouldn't be crashing.
> So do you think it's only going to go as far down at 5-6k?

I find it likely that we will drop below 5k at some point, but I don't know when, how, for how long, or exactly how far.  I kind of view it as a "continuum of probabilities" where <5k is likely, <4k is somewhat likely, <3k is somewhat unlikely, <2k is very unlikely, and <1k is extremely unlikely.

After that I don't have any real guesses as to what the bounce will look like.  Some bubbles bounce back quickly, so that might put us back into the 5-6k range within a month of the bottom.  Other bubbles have a round-flat bottom.  Since my estimations are based on looking at various historical bubbles (Bitcoin and other assets), I can't really guess as to the shape of this one - or the timing, which also varies heavily.  The only thing common among the bubbles I looked at is that it takes a long time to find the real bottom, which is why I think we're most likely to have a slow bleed with a few scary cliffs (and hope-inspiring plateaus) along the way.

I do think we'll be back above 5-6k by this time next year though.
I said
I told you. Critical support at 6260. Just study the chart from the last week. It's quite obvious. So I'm saying if that breaks, buying at 6200 would be foolish. So either move your buys up to ~6300, or put them much lower. I'm trying to do you a favor by telling you not to long a breakdown of a critical support. I'm not saying any other part of your post is wrong or right, it's irrelevant. I should have communicated I what I was referring to more specifically.
I read somewhere that $100b market cap is a regulatory limit for some institutions. I would not at all be surprised if it's being protected.
I do not care and I don't care what you say...

Are you the Shitposting Regulator!!???

You ... 6 Months here and you do not know Shixxx
!long [instrument] update [new ca] [new multiplier] [new stack %]

But that is better if an error has accumulated, or did multiple adds since the last update, like from scalping.

In your case I think you are looking for the *delete* command.
Like opening position

! long xbtusd update 6500 1x 10%

It will replace all params in database.
Then short the bounce :) It won't break 6400 anytime soon. That wall is huge.
Ah damn. I barely have any time to make trades so I might not have a chance today to make up for it.
I keep looking at the 15 minute candle and then this comment. I don’t know why I find this so fucking funny.
Well, I wouldn't have told you to go with that much leverage. This is a reversal. I'm long from 6550 with 3x leverage. I'll double down at t 6100 if it goes there which is looking less and less likely. 

If I were you, I'd close 2/3 of your position at 6400 and add somewhere lower if it goes there. But I'm thinking the next BD will be very B and very G.
lol I never knew he was a filthy shorter
which 9.9k? 
What are you talking about? Review my TA posts. I generally post both sides and am willing to swap long or short based on market conditions. 

I’m not biased at all. Here, I’m just showing that this isn’t a bear flag and we have seen similar patterns play out that have broken up. I’m also not in position, and won’t be for most likely a week. So I’m not rooting for either side, i could frankly care less if it goes up or down. Of course I would love to see it go up. 
Low
what other commodities are constantly barting? enlighten me
CynicalSynapses. You're very cynical, but that's what it takes to make money in this corrupt market :D
> Of course we all want the price to go our way

Indeed we do my Internet cohort!
No need to be sorry, mate!

We can both be smiling for different reasons ;)
well when lack of volatility was suspected as being the precursor to volatility, Azop? made the stability charts. Where are your charts? "Usually pumps" is the relationship btcmarkets should demand you explore with numbers instead of verbose claims. I'm interested in analysis not spam

Edit: I'm salty!
No, I have no idea what to do. A big move is probably coming but no idea which way. 
I thought it was insightful for you since I was the one that almost one month ago was asking why everybody was saying that we need to shake weak hands. I thought I wouldnt cash out when I felt that prices are too low like now. But this month part of the roof of my house started collapsing so I need to have some money to cover this. Sorry for bad English
Gypsy got to you, hm?
Thanks. Don't worry. I was into BTC's about same time you were.
And I'm always positive 😀👍👍
I would have at least waited until the end of the year to see what happens.  You may have just thrown 100k of gains away or more.  But it is your money and no one can tell you what to do with it!
mimimi :)
I am from Europe :) Just prefer doing sports myself rather than drinking beer, screaming on the streets and watching football. 
It's only due to one exchange - BTC-e. They have fiat withdrawal issues and the withdrawal fee is crazy. BTC/USD is above 8k there right now.
Would you have a link to your "bank run" post? I feel out of the loop. 
I would rely on binance prices I think as the most reliable tether market. It seems btc is a little bit cheaper there, but not too much. It's about $8 cheaper than gdax.
>15k on gdax is worth paying attention to 
You've got cold storage though, don't you? For you that's more like a hedge? I agree that a hedge is practical here.
> Why wouldn't Bitcoin suffer the same fate as other commodities/currencies/stocks?

Capital flight is a friend to Bitcoin.

Also, regulatory clarity will change the landscape in a yet to be realized way.

Edit: Looking at that on the 3-day for more resolution. Also illustrating what I think the impact of regulatory clarity will be. https://www.tradingview.com/x/pMYxgsC7/
> I don't think it's going below 5700 right now, probably not even below 6k. But it's likely going to be a long equilibrium in this range for a couple of weeks.

Hey man, why do you think we will be range-bound rather than dropping straight through? Support at 6300 and resistance at 6450?
Double that and you're getting warmer.
Is there any follow-through or are they just spoofs? I know Mex has just had $6mil+ walls set up on either side for wash trading, so it’s hard to tell there.
Honestly I wouldn’t go short for a quick scalp right now. We are at a pretty crucial area, I would wait til we blast through $6.5 or dump to $6k before making a big margin move: 
Miners don’t run out of Bitcoin. They are constantly pumping new coins into the market.
> we're not going under 6k

Bitcoin: "Lol watch this"
Bases on this logic, the price hasn't been steadily declining the last several months, right?

(of course, if you arbitrarily decide which point counts as "eventually", anything is possible) 
>The sellers run out of coins eventually. Buyers are obviously still buying.

This phrase will be written in the history of trading.
Why do you belive that. I am interested.
We are oversold but there are no buyers right now to take advantage. Volume is low and we're having trouble pushing past 6400
But there are several different TA people I follow that say we're making a stop to 6450 first 
Press / then select Volume from the list. / is the forward slash key on keyboard.
Told myself "gonna hold this one awhile" so many times.  Yet I think I've only had a couple trades that were held over a week, longest one was like 3 or 4 weeks.
I'm so sick of seeing comments like this, when we rise to 6800 on the smallest volume people here say "volume isn't important" or "the volume will come after", but now that it's a dump "volume matters". It's crazy the amount of bias that this sub has. And for the record, the dump from 6800 had 3x the volume we had during the price rise. 
we couldnt breach 6400 for like 6 times already
I got screenshots of GDAX $8888 and $9999. Daily volume on $9999, 42,585 at the time (11/30). 

it^is^a^joke
look at horizontal supports/resistances. not much more logic atm
Prove it's a scam.
It's support on the bigger time frames like the daily. But yes, on the 4 hour we are knocking on the resistance. It's actually not a bad short with a tight stop, you'll know if you're wrong without losing too much.
Thanks? Not sure how that applies to his 15 round comment, but ok thanks
It doesn't have to be TA. Just given SOME reasoning, other than "I think the price will go down, because I'm bearish" (which is redundant). Explain what your thought process is
His account was suspended by admins... For good reasons.
Joey - “How youuu doin?”
It's not their plan. It's just what it is. From checking their troll box, their withdrawal fees are either ridiculously high (20&#37; or more) or it's just plan impossible to withdraw USD due to exchange issues. As such, everyone with USD on the exchange is buying BTC so they can withdraw, pumping the price. This is coupled with the difficulty of withdrawing USD and risk of what could be going on is causing the arbitrage there to be essentially nonexistent as well.

For instance, for a 20&#37; withdrawal fee, if you withdrew 8.2k USD (1 BTC there) you'd only get  6.55k out of it that you could transfer to another fiat exchange. The premium you'd gain then (\~$200/BTC) is the reward for the crazy risk associated with the action (likely wouldn't be able to withdraw the USD at all, at least in a timely manner).
I was obviously joking.

Don't think it's a scam. They reopened after this whole FBI thing. I think they may have fiat withdrawal problems but I don't know the case.

5 points to define the triangle is my minimum.
!remind me 6 months
Tbh same at this point, I want this bear market to be done
Dude.. 
Looks like you'll live another year.
No, I'm on the September futures these days.

I generally stay away from perps. I don't really have the energy or patience to be constantly hopping in and out of position to avoid paying funding fees.
It absolutely can go below $5,500 and I'm honestly surprised it hasn't yet. 

Breaking out of the [3d consolidation triangle](https://imgur.com/a/WLxnPId) to the downside was a solid bearish signal and I'd expect the market to revisit at least the $3,000 to $4,000 area within the next few months and possibly drop as low as $1,300 in that same timeframe. 
>It's not a put option. It is futures.   You can close that position any time...or add to it.

You can also close a put option at any time... European settlement is very rare these days. 
Haha fair enough, decent points. I kind of liken it to RSI in so much as oversold vs overbought (price has been in a heavy trend for a while, it's likely to reverse soon). And there's many more complex layers and analytics you can do on TD but I don't use it enough to understand them so just stick to the basic setup/countdown.

Just noticed the only other time the setup has occurred and ran with it; tried to be clear I'm not advocating taking action using it all by itself. It's only something that could be valuable to keep in the back of your mind, if only as a peripheral factor.

Sorry for not giving the benefit of the doubt initially - there's plenty of trolls/idiots around these days that would say that seriously.
TA as a statistical tool is pretty cool until observer effect comes into play.  There's your heuristic for the day.
Well, when a mommy and a daddy love each other very much...

Edit: never mind the rest, go ask your mother
Again, got to give you credit for the cleverness 
Shots fired.
I believe a trader's intuition is the result of their subconscious processing a lot of data for them, data that has proven bullish or bearish in the past, and giving them that "gut feeling". 
Yup! I admit I can't talk about stochastic MACD bull div descending wedges, but I'm up about 1000% from initial investment and increased my trading stack approx 8% in the last couple months. That works for me.

[EDIT: Bragging rights, being "right", and winning internet points helps nobody. Sharing knowledge, having substantive debates, and building a strong community is good for everybody. Wish people had a better sense of that here, but I guess expecting sociability and community in a trading sub is unrealistic :P] 
It’s all relative dude. A poor man investing his only $100 has more courage than the man with $100mm who invests $1mm.
I don't see any bullish divergences, can you provide a chart?
stop being so scared and "manipulated" by big dildos
Sorry, I'm not saying your opinion is invalid, just that your definitiveness was unjustified. Sometimes I focus too much on the accuracy of my word choices vs the likely interpretation of them. 
Thanks bud. Yes I've heard/seen that before and I think that's pretty close to what I'm after. Ideally there'd be some way of seeing an estimate of how much BTC was bought from a specific price level that hasn't moved, not sure how that'd be possible though.
This would be pretty interesting. I’ll look into this...
Because you know you're not staring at just a candle. You're staring at ThudnerChunky and Potatoking21 and it's all the more hilarious.
rekt
Dude it was a joke...
lol I was looking at old dailies and saw it and was like Holy shit 
the last one! Check the daily when futures hit $10k in May or whenever it was.. dude opened a short at $9.9k 

he closed it extraordinarily early. But I still maintain that he's not as much of a dummy as he seems. He's still managed to close most of his longs in profit. 
Oil , aluminum, copper, gold 
Hahaha i guess so 
[Does this work for you buddy?](https://www.tradingview.com/x/3Q13lFMJ/)  Current ETHBTC setup looking similar to the previous 3

Lol'd at edit!
I think a move down is more likely in the short term. I'm currently 70-30 fiat to crypto at the moment and I've set buy stops in the 6500 range just in case. RSI has reset for the most part, and with the talk of ETFs just around the corner, large holders may be accumulating as much as they can before the announcement. Even if it's rejected, it's gotten enough news that we should see a lot of movement in the weeks leading up to the announcement. 

Edit: If it does flush downward, I'll be targeting a buy in the 5200 range.
Yes, exactly :) sometimes people don't need a good reason to cash out in  terms of the market...just real life :P
lol! I mean I'm just saying some people like to "roleplay" here. I think moon_airspace is legit 


damn you're right. he honestly did make me way more paranoid. 

But I mean it's not all baseless, I really think people do try to manipulate this sub...maybe I should just go back to believing everyone though lol 
This is called Bulltard
Thanks for your concern, I appreciate it. 
Haha okay! 🙂 

Not al of us are degenerates though! National team competitions are when hooliganism doesn’t come out, thankfully 😀

I'm 3x short, which means I'm net 2x short. Still doesn't really matter. Rules apply. Either way this is going I'm gonna take advantage of it, even if it means I'm gonna lose a bit of my BTC stack.
Nah man, that's just dreaming at this point. I mean, capital flight in quasi failed states with hyperinflation towards Bitcoin is already happening, and it's a sensible thing to do. Parking money in an asset in a pretty nasty downtrend as a safe haven because of a recession is just not that smart from a money management perspective. The Dollar is the safe haven, and Trump is pretty much slapping the world around at this point and telling them that the USA is still the boss. (Don't like the guy, but you have to give credit where credit is due). Gold isn't performing great either. 

Regulations are necessary but that's not going to change a single thing if Bitcoin is like this because it all relies on money entering the market. It's like all the hype about an ETF, I hope they won't launch it soon because it's going to be a huge letdown if the interest is minimal. After seeing your chart with the regulations we might see a short term pop but it's not going to be long lived. Macro economics > News/hype. 
I feel like for bitcoin to benefit, we would need to hit a sweet spot of only *modest* devastation to traditional markets.  If it is perceived that there will be a long slump grinding its way downward of foreign equities and currencies, BTC could be an attractive place for investors to look toward for gains.  But if there is market pandemonium and big crunches worldwide like 2008, people will freak and panic sell everything for USD.  
These levels are too important and it needs some serious bear momentum to fall right through. A long range bound pattern can give it the necessary momentum, it could also give it the necessary momentum to break 6800. We also had a long downtrend before this and I did expect a stronger bounce in early July when we bottomed. Support probably at 6000-6150, short term resistance 6450 but the real resistance is higher at 6600 & 6800 but that's probably for after we dump. 
They are just spoofs so it’s hard to tell of their intentions. I just remember a similar bot making similar size orders, that were were not spoofs as we went upwards back in December. They would literally force the price up because no one had enough BTC to sell into their wall.
He's a perma bull

Believe what? That we're not going under 6k? Because we've given it three mighty tests already this year, including one with very intense, high-volume sell pressure in February when there were still some weak hands to shake out. You guys can downvote me and mock me all you want. Mama always told me, "They only bully you because they're jealous, Joey." She was right. This is why I do not bully people even when they're assholes and idiots. What do I care? I'm fucking rich.
i dont know what is wrong but i think it is on bitmex? i added bitfinex btc/usd and it worked fine. 

im going long on this btc/usd. high volume on support and low volume on support. that is whati learned from the book that i read 
so you yourself just said you didn't trust a low volume move and it was confirmed by a high volume move. 

but now a low volume move down is suddenly king? 

the fact that its trying to go back up each time is a bullish indicator 
Bitfinex refused to go through an audit to prove they have 3 billion dollars because they claim to have 3 billion Tether. The only proof we have that they have 3 billion dollars in a bank somewhere is because 2 famous Chinese people claim to have seen it. 
https://247cryptonews.com/bitfinex-usd-tether-proof-of-liquidity-comes-from-china/

Stops above 6.4 should do the trick.

We dropped from 6.8 without any bounce, just stopped for a moment here and there, not exactly bullish.
Because you were only partially right, boxing doesn't have to be what you specified.  Moreso boxing title fights were 15 rounds for most of history and only changed in the 80s.

I’m already suicidal, don’t worry.
Doesn't that get reflected in the price though? Maybe from hours before the funding time

For example, I would expect price to suddenly rise an hour before the funding time then drop back after. Maybe hopping out 3 hours before the funding time is pretty safe
Yeah, but if you're short, you generally receive funding, right?   
Holy fuck...$1300? Thats bearish as fuck. 
That's a 93% loss. I mean I can see 3k... I'm unsure about less than that. Maybe if the news was horrible but I think the CBOE attempt means there will probably be BTC ETFs approved when that finally goes through.

Edit: I see your reasoning now of ATH to previous ATH as new low. I fucking hope not. That's all I'll say.
Yes mom
Precisely. The amount of data that must be juggled in order to make an informed decision is much greater than a graph charting a handful of variables over a single period of time.

Intellectual analysis is great, but only after churned into the cauldron of subconscious musings and fermented into antifragile actionable sense.

[EDIT: Sorry for excessive verbosity / flowery language. Undergoing a period of mild hypomania the last few days. It's my neurotransmitters' fault!] 
Something to also keep in mind is that these "traders" all come from different walks of life and backgrounds. I'm a geologist with a master's in geochemistry and have a very analytical mindset when it comes to everything in life. Emotions don't have a huge role in my decision making which is why I think I've found success in being a trader. Unfortunately, I think for many here it is the other way around where emotions tend to get in the way of rational decision making which leads to tribalism/herd mentality.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/IRbY8NGz/

i did a job for op with bonus fun lines.
Yeah.  What I think they can see is that bitcoin days destroyed is increasing, meaning hodl’ing on the whole is increasing.  
Wouldn't that mean that is being regulated if it's above 100b? So for no regulations it should go below that? I'm clearly missing something here, someone enlighten me please...

E: So you're implying people want it to be regulated?

E2: ETF would bring in institutional money so from a traders perspective the answer would be yes

He's just being lucky. His decisions are irrational.

Yeah, seems like a decent plan. I have alerts set at $6500, but no orders placed. Gun shy after getting chopped up recently. 
I think people just need to be more objective in their thinking here and question everything that is said regardless of who they are. Educating oneself as much as possible is the first step and will help people tease through the bullshit (this goes for everything in life).

As a wise man once sung, "as your bodies grow larger, your minds will flower, so it's great to learn, BECAUSE KNOWLEDGE IS POWER!"
Dude same thought process going on here. Not sure what to believe lol, good lesson to be skeptical and think for yourself. 
Whatever you call / name it. LoL
Hahah, fair enough! It was just a little trolling comment from me. Just wanted to check who is watching football right now instead of lovely bitcoin price action :D
Thank you sir!
All the best.
Availability in quasi failed states is very low. I expect that to continue; it doesn't compose a substantial percentage of volume, anyway.

We see substantial bitcoin volume from speculators in developed countries. That market is nowhere near tapped.

The dollar is on a completely different playing field. I'm not going to start a conversation where Bitcoin is being seriously compared vs gold or the dollar. Those markets are distinct by orders of magnitude. That position isn't going to change until well after established ETFs are dealing with Bitcoin in volume that's at least in the same order of magnitude.

IMO, Bitcoin can go sideways or down for the rest of the year. If it's going sideways then we need regulatory clarity that's at least not negative.

Enjoying this conversation. Thanks for responding :)
People don't typically sell for dollars in those scenarios. You see capital flight to Japan and Switzerland. Americans don't save and they rapidly devalue their currency by comparison.
I mean, it’s still a spoof if they had no intention to buy at those prices. They were likely just driving fomo in order to sell at the top. But I hear ya, lots of sketchy games at play today.
Hm.. The bitcoin graphs from 2010-2018 certainly gives a valid argument for permabullism.
I'm a long-term bull, not a permabull. I've been in this market too long to not think it can go down. But longer term, it goes up. Way up.
And what are you?
Wrong. I won six out of my last seven trades, and I'm going to win on this one. I also told you guys not to short just before the BGD of the 29th. Honestly, I think I'm probably the most successful trader on this sub.
Dude I'm not even going to argue with you because you really don't have a clue with what volume is doing. 

Prove me wrong and go long here 

Edit: and before you say anything, yes I'm short
And the fact that it try to go down as well is bullish too
[removed]
phew.  you had me worried for a second.
Pff. Get help if serious. 
depends on the market. i stopped shorting btc/usd on mex because of funding, and moved to alts

funding got quite high for shorts before the last big pump, meaning everyone and their brother were shorting (and most got rekt in the huge pump i guess)
It wouldn't be particularly pleasant for most market participants, but it's not completely unprecedented. 

The last bubble pop in 2014-2015 dropped the market from $1,160 to $160. 

While a drop from $20,000 to $1,300 would be more substantial, it would follow a similar pattern of:

1. Break out above previous ATH
2. Skyrocket to new ATH
3. Retrace to previous ATH
I'm not much of a news guy, personally. 


I really enjoyed reading that tbh
Ah, I've wondered where the "Geo" part came from :) Now it all makes sense! 
Hahahahahahahaha 

also sorry I never answered your question lol of course with didn't close my shorts 😅😅

I will update the position bot and post here as soon as I do since it'll be a momentous day 😂
lol honestly you're probably right. It's funny how it's difficult to distinguish between a decent trader and one that's lucky through sheer force of will sometimes
No worries! Though I’m not sure if I’d classify the current price action on bitcoin as “lovely” 😉 personally I’d say the game was more interesting than this sideways action 😬 haha
I'm planning to do some larger posts at some point about Bitcoin and it's relation to global macro but the relation so far isn't very clear, besides going super parabolic in December, topping in December/January and underperforming ever since. The same pattern is found in several stock indices at the same point in time. Too much of a coincidence to think that it doesn't matter. If the dollar goes up, BTC goes down. It's an equation. There's absolutely arbitrage happening on the swings between exchange rates in different currencies and Bitcoin because the BTC/EUR looks different when EUR/USD is trending hard. BTC/EUR didn't even break it's February lows yet. Most trading is done in dollar so it has the most influence on the price of BTC. It's going to be interesting to see how Bitcoin behaves the coming year. I do think it CAN become a hedge for economic and especially political uncertainty, but it takes time. 

Still have a lot to learn about global markets but I do find it fascinating how the market seems to know all and humans are just running behind chasing returns and the capital flows. 


Very excited. When the whales are out, that means we will see volatility. I would rather go up but I’ll react just as fine if we go down. Either way, fun trading. 
I'm not knocking the guy. The general trend of markets over time is up. So being bullish is more logical than being bearish imo. Just saying you should take what he says with a grain of salt. 
Some people call me the space cowboy.

Some call me the gangster of love.

Some people call me Maurice. 

Cause I speak of the pampataus of love.
Then let’s not argue and wait to see if we go up or down from here 
The fact that moves down are getting weaker and weaker, yes
I thought previous ATH is 5k or 3k. We've actually retested 3k after hitting 5k.
Haha yeah, the name definitely stands out in a crypto sub lol
Good for you man, glad you are making some bank.

It is hard to stay with a position that long, but you will likely reap the benefits. What are you going to do about August 10? Close in case of a run up or hold it all and pray for all ETF hopes and dreams to be crushed?
We are all playing with matches and gasoline here. The difference is that some like kaktus and diy are jumping bare foot into the fire thinking they're Mother of Dragons and won't get burnt, and some are just suiting up, taking extinguisher and trying to control the damn thing.
*GeoDude uses nod*
I'm referring to the previous ATH of $1,160 that preceded the drop back to $160.

$1,300 is merely the technical target for the aforementioned triangle breakdown. If it were to mirror the 2014-2015 bubble burst, we'd actually see $1,160. 
no profits until I close :P

will re w evaluate at the time 

probably pull an all nighter or something and watch for news.lol 
thats why i just am trying to sit back and let the market come to me rather than trying to chase it like a panicked wet cat. 
There is a possibility we will mirror it by touching last ATH before the run, which would take us to 3 or 5.
with dailies from the last ETF up, to be sure!
I understood that I actually like chasing it. My short term vision is way better than long term approach. You know that every single time I tried to set myself on a long term trade I got rekt? Every single time. All my wins are short-term (up to couple of days) scalps. That's because I can't take movement against me after being on big profits.
That makes sense. I could probably trade short term pretty decently as well I just am not in that mindset
