Line is openning an exchange in Singapore, and from that article this caught my eye:

 "Line is expanding into financial services to reduce reliance on advertising revenue and offer a way to gain subscribers in countries dominated by Facebook Inc.’s Messenger and WhatsApp."

To me, Facebook buying coinbase to stay ahead of rivals seems to be a little more than rumor now. Line also entered into a strategic partnership with ICON to power its blockchain network. Maybe these giants competing over crypto market will fuel the next bullrun? What is your opinion?

Trading over the last year has been fun and all, but when it gets to tax time does anyone else regret doing all the silly little skim trades? Pain in the ass to work out. Wish i'd have just bought at the bottom, sold at the top, and then bought back at the bottom. Why the hell didn't I think of that at the time?

Seems likely we head to the 6.3-6.5 zone. Just not seeing the selling enthusiasm to continue downwards without going higher first.

Filled. Lets see what happens. 
jesus christ. Please throw me a bone how can this recover
Suspense is killing me
I will be scaling into a 5x long every $100 drop from here on down. No stops. I will add more to keep driving down my liquidation price if I need to. We either see a reversal before reaching about 4.5k or I am going down with the ship.

On the bright side if I get liquidated I will have a few years to re-accumulate!
Was on vacation for a few weeks, didn't look at prices once. But holy fuck. Came back to see a nice $ figure loss. Still mid-long term bullish, but the bulls on the sidelines are playing this very well. Anyone still in fiat is getting a great discount. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't jealous as fuck. Props to anyone who made some great returns from the rejection of 10k. 



In other news, I'm on day 1 of only eating brown rice, baked chicken, avocado, broccoli, and whey chocolate protein powder to hit a big lean bulk this summer. Not going to break it for 30 days. Allowed 5 drinks / week of course! 


Stay safe everyone, remember to live. This market isn't going anywhere, but your time is!

Everyone: We've been at 6102 for an hour! HUGE MOVE COMING!  
Bitcoin: [*bloop* 6108](http://nelson-haha.api-meal.eu/)
None of the top authors on tradingview are crypto people anymore. Looks like a lot of people have left. I don't know about you guys but Magicpoopcannon not being relevant anymore is bullish to me. I am really grasping at straws at this point lol.
Just remember the most famous visit to the Goblin Town ended up in the guy in charge killed and hordes of his minions slaughtered. The visitors survived and actually got their mountain of gold back sometime later. Just sayin'. 

(Sorry, trying to loosen up the atmosphere a bit)
Falling wedge reversal in the making on the daily? Combined with several bullish divergences on RSI and OBV, it feels like the likelihood of a reversal is increasing.

Sorry if this has been discussed at length in the last few days already, was busy with other stuff...
[My take on what's happening](https://i.imgur.com/XpGStsg.png)
People are speculating what will happen if we breach $5.8k.


How about if we fail? I can't help but imagine how positive it would be to maintain this level after so many attempts over such a long period.


In the end, we are mostly all bulls. The question is, will the savvy/greedy bulls (shorters) hit their price targets to go long? I wonder what % will miss their target and have to fomo back in. My guess is, the majority.
just for fun: https://imgur.com/a/r8TSSzN
Is the falling short/long ratio bullish or bearish?
**Position Bot Update**


I've prepared an [Excel template](http://anotherbot.info/template.xls) for people to fill if they want to load their trading backlog into the bot database.

After filling it send it to me by PM so i can validate the values before inserting them.

Back log positions are identified in the history page of each user.


Any suggestions or bug reports are welcome as usual.
It can't stay in this range much longer. Massive move is incoming in the next 4 hrs. 

Those BBands are toight like a tiger.
This is Bitfinex data for past 12 hours or so: https://i.imgur.com/kfuHBtv.png (scale 1.0, transactions x > 5)

Note that the situation is much more balanced that it may seem. Some are making the argument there aren't many buys (-> exhaustion), but clearly that's not the case. Also note that buys/sells data (columns buys & sells), as the label states, dynamically "gets resetted when the price returns".
Im not sure if talk about traditional markets impacting BTC's price is well received around here but anyone else think  that the whales are spooked with whats happening in traditional markets so they are going risk-off with their BTC and alts?

I mean asian whales should be starting to feel some of the heat with whats happening in asian markets. Can someone here with a more experienced background give some insights?
another day, another grind in this range

still sticking to my theory that this is probably the bottom before a technical bounce/relief rally to about $8,500-9,000 before another move down to $5,000-5,500
Philosophical question: If down, do all alts go to the same Goblin town or Does every alt have its small Goblin village?
Volatility dropped again and everyone is quiet.

Seems like some are waiting for monthly candle to close, others are waiting for June futures on mex and some others are waiting for CME futures.

I have three major positions open atm and im using this time to figure out what to do with them if we go up and what to do if we go down cos at this point, I honestly have no clue which way itll all go

bull in me wants to believe this is accumulation and we'll go up after 8 (!) week downtrend, at least temporarily. RSI is low on daily, there's bull divs 

bear in me thinks there's not been enough pain. Shorts are relatively low. Why not dump to build them up (and fuck up open longs) and once we have enough shorts and therefore plenty of sells to buy into, fuck up the shorts by squeezing them.

whenever we drop below 6k, it gets bought back up which is fantastic but we can't even break 6350 which is honestly pathetic by the bulls. We're rejecting EMAs (12, 26, 50) on every time frame from 1H to 12H, not tested yet on the daily and I don’t think well get the chance to before the next big move.

I think we're too tight to have a drawn-out equilibrium consolidation and something is gonna pop hard before monthly closes. Next 12-36hours are definitely to be watched carefully and planned in advance.

Bonus: saw this chart on twitter and felt physically sick for a little bit. Now that would be max fucking pain boys, specially for those who joined in 2017 like me. That being said, I still don’t think id sell everything, crypto is deffo here to stay. Just a question of how much are we all gonna get wrecked before it comes back

https://twitter.com/HsakaTrades/status/1012325340792938496

edit: might be less than 12-36... https://www.tradingview.com/x/hLPXS5U4/
Whale Oil Beef Hooked
Some people fomo shorted because we keep repeating "we will see a huge move soon". But 48h sideways don't necessarily mean that a big move is due... My opinion for what it's worth. 

I just got bored and made a pro/con list to naked short here.

Pro: 
-RSI nicely reseted in contrast to the last time we were at 6.1k
-low risk of a short squeeze, ratio on finex is heavily long favored (in contrast to ~ 1:1 before our last 500 USD candle)
-general downtrend

Con:
- this might be accumulation with the 5.7k drop being the spring?
- afraid of shorting the bottom
-i'm bored and i do stupid decisions when i'm bored...
I said I will take a break. But hey, this is crypto, the most addictive drug. Who the fuck was I kidding..

I think whales are accumulating. The OBV in 1 minute time frame was very visibly in an upward trend (before the dump). It could make another leg down to max 5500 but until then I'm holding my position.

Since everyone is sharing their view of what may happen shortly, I'm thinking: an Altair Leap of Faith down to 2k. Bounces to 6k. goes sideways for 17 minutes. Then rallies to 20k by tonight.

edit: \*eagle sound plays on every exchange\*
Does anybody remember the charts that were knocking around over a year ago showing the long term periodicity in bitcoin price movement? I seem to remember a period being ~ 1.5 years but I am not sure.

my [latest ta](http://prntscr.com/k0ish8)
I don't understand why people keep thinking that *veteran whales are selling.

Has anyone ever considered that all of the noobs who bought in after 1.3k are scared shitless with their first bear market?

I remember back in 2013 or so, and I think I bought around the top at around $240 or something, and price going down was brutal for me; I ended up selling most of my stack on the way down.
Looking for thoughts here.

It's a big IF, but IF someone wanted to accumulate here, wouldn't this be close to the ideal set of circumstances? 

What do people who are accumulating large quantities of BTC want? First, they need consistent sell pressure from the rest of the market to reduce slippage. Ideally, there wouldn't be too many shorts open because every short will have to cover at some point, and that is buy pressure which an accumulator wouldn't want right away. 

Next, as the accumulator in question keeps buying, the price should stay around the same level but eventually gradually go up. It could actually help the accumulator for there to be longs open since a certain percentage of longs will close (sell) on the next rise and provide extra sell pressure for the next round of accumulation. 

Shorts who have been waiting for a better entry will start opening which is exactly what an accumulator would want since this is even more sell pressure liquidity for their buys. It also sets up a nice squeeze and pump scenario when they are ready to mark the price up for distribution. Once sufficient shorts have built up, pump it- squeeze it - pay it - watch it - turn it - leave it - stop - format it. 

I don't claim to be an authority on any of this, just trying to figure it out like the rest of you.

edit: format

edit2: Anyone have thoughts here?

This is Bitcoin. Everything is possible. 
Will not close until liquidation (~5600)
Volume barely increased on that drop.

I think we will need to see a significant volume increase  before making lower lows. 

All that suspense we get this? Definitely not a lot of panic selling going on right now. Longs are also still increasing 
Big move incoming volume is going down things aren’t moving much so be ready. 50% of us are going to lose 50% will win. Which side will you choose?
[deleted]
Push down, push up, push up but then push down. Rinse and Repeat.
Starting to see a bit of volume finally 
This is the longest fight for 6K that we've seen over the last few attempts for sure. No immediate decisive bounce out like the rest over the last week or so. 
Had a bit too much skin in the game and closed my entire  short position at break even like 2 hours ago, just before the break down.

Gentle reminder to me that position size is important. 
What's up with these weird no-name exchanges like BigOne with massive BTC/USDT volume?
Testing resistance of the channel's support breakdown  https://www.tradingview.com/x/si3E21dm/
Currently short from 6100, I'm holding to either break even or we test the VAL (blue line), around 5500. https://www.tradingview.com/x/YUfJ17Ib/

If we bounce from there could be a good R/R for a long. But if it breaks down, that's a huge low volume node until 4800. Before that though there's the ATH down trend.

BBands tightening, pennant forming in our descending channel/wedge, RSI reset across up to 4H, volume dropping, open interest dropping, futures settling tomorrow. Feels like a prime setup for a BxD to me.

Ironically, this intense sideways is so boring that it's actually exciting.


I have no idea which way this is going to break. I've never been this unsure before. There are good points for both sides. I can't wait to see what happens. I'm currently 50% Bitcoin and 50% Tether. 
In my mind bitcoin under 6000 is like when you push ball full of air under water. It will pop up back to surface as soon as you get tired pushing it. :)
Just for fun, the day before our last Feb bottom... we managed to fall a pretty impressive 26% in pretty much just over 1 day.

Now a potential bottom move like that, happening soon would send us to 4,500. 

I don't think that'll be happening soon by the way, it's just for info and comparison. It's a very good example though of how things can go to shit in handbasket incredibly quick should the arse fall out of Bitcoin at this level.


Seems like without shorts building up and then closing, it has a hard time moving above a previous local high.  Feels like a balloon slowly deflating.

Needs new money is what I am inferring.  We're just playing a shell game with an existing pool of money that grows smaller and smaller (as more money is accumulating on sidelines or being taken by whales).  Active small fry traders are tapped out.
Sneezed on the dip and the dip got dipper
Nomally order books are never a good trading advice, but I just observed that the downside of the order books got weaker. 
Is it just me or is the Pink Panther theme song playing while watching the price in anticipation? 
"50 Guy" just got his bluff called again on GDAX: BUY 51.00080000 at $6,067.91. Let's see if he can make it back....

cc: /u/SloppySynapses

Edit:

And, as if on cue, there is now an extremely aggressive 50+ BTC bid chasing price up. I'm sure he'll have no problem getting it filled in profit on such a liquid exchange....

(This is what I mean: play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Don't rig your bot to bet $300K on $2 moves.)
Just a matter of time 
We're now about 300$ lower than this morning and the long vs short ratio is still at 2:1
This is confusing.
The same people who didn't realize that we were on the moon at $14k also won't realize that this IS Goblin Town.    It's just not South Central Goblin Town where only the most hardened goblin rektlords steal your hard-earned bankroll by force.
slowly slowly, bulls are giving up? from 10 to 6k without a real bounce. every attempt fails...
6000 support strong
Somebody moved 45K BTC yesterday. If they were moving it to an exchange for dumping, this could be a good time to short. 
[removed]
fakout or sub 6k incoming.
Anyone care to share their DCA plans? I do believe it's about that time to dip the feet in before taking the full plunge. We are about 70% from ATH, and probably, at least in my mind, won't go past 85%, so I see this as the final  window of opportunity for the little retail buyer like myself to get a solid stash going before the big bull awakens and puts 20k to shame.

I'm fully aware this bear may reign for years, but I don't think it'll take that long. 
This really starting to look like accumulation. Also with futures closing soon in 2 days. I expect some major action happening in the next few days. This is heavily manipulated.
/r/bitcoinmarkets be like "love this trading sideways and resistance" and btc continues to lose another hundred bucks. 

Your money is literally better stuffed in your mattress.
It feels like it's time.
THE NEXT FEW DAYS ARE CRITICAL 
If this ends up as a V shaped reversal I'll be impressed. As well as relieved.
doesnt seem like anything is going to happen before futures settlement >_>
Haven’t checked Kraken since early yesterday and I guess 2 of my short orders got filled on another Crazy Kraken Wick. They got executed @: 

$6201 / $6232 , both 10% of stack each. 

I thought I was out of position until now lol. 

I have 5 more shorts stacked from $6256-$6378 but I may remove them and just set B/E stops on my current 2 and if we pop up wait to short around the $6400 range ( Red line ) 

Currently looking at: https://www.tradingview.com/x/zFEOFAiN/


[deleted]
So this is what it feels like to trade stocks...
still holding. like I posted yesterday, this can go down to $5500 or even $4950 but using stop losses/selling here to try and catch the bottom is just a good way to get left behind since the move up will be pretty damn violent. 
I can't wait for some of these overly-aggressive HFT algos to get rekt and face massive drawdowns once some volatility returns. They've been around since December, and I'm tired of seeing them...they distort information gleaned from the order book with their jittery over-exuberance.

Case in point: the one bot that slaps 50 BTC on the best ask on GDAX on every almost imperceptible price drift happening on other exchanges. Really? Wagering $300K+ on a transient $1.50 difference? It got its bluff called once around 12 hours ago, and I hope it gets cleaned out a few more times before some surprise $400 pump upwards. Hopefully something like that will teach the bot owner about the importance of position sizing....
I don't know shit about TA and have been trying to "time the market" for an entry point since April. Would you guys say *today* is a decent day to start dollar cost averaging, or should I just wait until an overall market reversal? I can accept that I'm not going to time the bottom well at all, given that I'm not versed on indicators or market analysis. 

Relevant:

Edit: 

* https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-defends-6k-as-traders-go-long/

TL;DR Undecided.
Let's **assume** price manipulation is going on and some big players are really trying to keep the current price between the $6000-6250 range until next future settlements.

Why would this benefit them? Why not push it further down already to accumulate more BTC for a lower/better price?

this thing will not turn till the 3D gets oversold...
Longs vastly outnumber shorts right now, not too sure what to make of that...
Is it safe to say that ALL longs are underwater?
That's it, we found the actual price of bitcoin! (Just trying to summon any volatility, last time i said something like that we had a ~1k movement) 
I would *LOVE* to see ~2 months of solid sideways here.  
Lol @ people using stop losses right now regardless of whether you are a bear or a bull. Its like you havent learned anything the past few days.
The last time we had this many longs in play we crashed from 7200 to 6700 earlier this month.

So in the past 4 hours, June futures discount has flipped to a slight premium, September futures discount has dropped from $40 to $15, longs:shorts have not moved at all, and our pennant is reaching decision point. 

Today's action (if you can call it that) has been completely bizarre. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/FIfiUMqf/  

I'm still short from above, but my ~$60 cushion on Sept Futs is now a $25 cushion.
I placed some ridiculously high short orders to see if I can snatch one on Kraken **IF** we get a BGD.

( $6531 ) ($6511) ($6472) ($6430) 

We have our new 10K resistance line right above us around $6420 ish ( Red ), which should supply some decent resistance if we get up there. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/9b9rzjiw/

Otherwise, short from low $6200’s with stops at $6203 for B/E and if my super high shorts don’t execute I’ll most likely Short the fuck out of wherever a BGD gets us to. 

Good luck ladies and gents. Some serious suspense going on right now

Volume low, Price is low, welcome to Goblin Town. Can't wait to see what things are like 6 months from now.

Volatility is likely to be low: [https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/books/USD](https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/books/USD)

Seems safe to accumulate here for a while. Hope we get a few weeks of this to restore confidence in the market.

Edit: downvote away, but this isn't as scary as people made it out to be.

[Hidden Bull div](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/p1m0Uqh8-BTC-Daily-RSI-Equilibrium/) looks nice as well. Of course the weekly is still shit but because of the bullish divergence on the 1d, the decreasing volatility, and decreasing volume I hazard to guess things are looking good for the next few weeks. Can't rule out any chaos on the weekly though, but if we hold near this price and things look like this I'm optimistic.

Longs keep piling up. This is very similar to when BTC was arond 1k-1.3k before going parabolic, but at that time shorters were in frenzy mode.

Same. Old story: smart money buys and hodls, dumb money sells and trades. It's a beautiful thing when you think about it.
[removed]
If Bitcoin survives the next 2-3 years (which I'm almost certain it will) price will probably be conservatively >= 5x today's price by simply considering demand growth and supply tightening. 

Lower prices today mean new opportunities for old and new players to accumulate more of this truly scarce asset, so it's ok if you want to make money day trading but if you think like I do, don't forget the final financial goal is to accumulate more of this revolutionary "digital gold" that will probably dominate the next few years/decades. (This means: don't be too greedy trying to catch the rock bottom when accumulating because if you blink you may lose your chance)
Well, it's June 28th 2018. We're near the end of an inflection point. Many of us will make a big decision in the coming week.

As for up or down, I dont know ... but there will be blood, lots and lots of blood.

[Waiting for this line to break decisively to the downside](https://www.tradingview.com/x/o2G2N4jM)

Buyers are nowhere to be found, sellers seem patient for the time being, but eventually they'll start clearing out the buy side of the book, I think. 
Classic beartrap.
Market seems exhausted...
Whoever is buying here got some major balls. Prob very well bankrolled too. Could they be buying to dump later?
[Here's](https://www.tradingview.com/x/jVb0Fhez/) what I'm thinking might happen.

Breakdown to 5K, bounce off the original log downtrend line, rally to 6Kish (possibly up to the old symmetrical triangle line around 7K). Breakdown back to 5K, followed by a brief "Adam and Eve" FOMO rally before being rejected off the *new* log downtrend, before breaking into the old log channel. Touch off the bottom of the channel a few times before heading into another bull market.

The grey arrows show an alternate possibility of breaking through the channel and heading substantially lower. The big neon green line is the previous ATH at $1200.  

Apologies for the cluttered chart.
I'm seeing this right yea, 2 hour chart, bear pennant reaching the end of its lifespan. Target somewhere around the 5400 region or greater??
price rises 500 and no body blinks an eye, price drops 20 bucks and everyone loses their mind
My feeling is that the price of BTC finally stabilized. The price discovery phase is over. Bitcoin's value is 6107 and some change.

Our efforts should now be to invite all the small local businesses that did not want to accept BTC due to its volatility. 

Its time to start buying coffee with BTC again!
I realized this morning how much shit the likes of Dimon, Buffet and Gates got for saying BTC was in a bubble and there was a risk of it falling back to 2k. They said they would short it if they could.

Now the pleb is bashing people who are saying we are not in a bubble, they are forecasting a 2k bottom and they are actively shorting the shit out of BTC.

The times they are a changin....

Something weird is going on. Bitcoins volume is up but everything else isn’t moving or very little 
Thoughts on Tone vays ? (Please dont downvote me to oblivion if you don't like him 🙈)

Edit: should have mentioned "as a trader"
I've been hearing all this stuff about "goblin town" and "bag holders" for six months, but here I am standing on the moon with bags full of Bitcoin worth $6000 apiece that feel very light here in the lunar gravity. Big bears had better make a move soon or folks might start to think they're all hat, no cowboy.
Retail already bogged. Yet there are too many coins in the hands of traders (5m by some estimates). For this reason I would not be surprised to see a flash crash this summer. The monthly macd cross seems very likely and it could lead to a big reaction. After the whales make sure that speculators are also bogged, we can find a bottom. Having said that, a reaction upwards now would also not surprise me: there is 0.618 and the broken trendline on the weekly (also MA50 on weekly) that can be tested as resistance. And there is RSI 50 to be defended on the monthly, which has also printed 2 reds in a row.   
TLDR I would reckon a possible upward reaction and then eventually down to 0.786 with possible range below it during summer, possibly late summer.
Sideways is sexy. I hope this goes for weeks actually. Lets build solid support.
If we recover/bounce from here, what’s the highest you think we will go? 

I’m guessing $6050-$6100 If we get a nice green candle 
Anyone have any perspective on the following crazy thought I have? It's been in the back of my mind for a while, and with the price action currently... might finally be appropriate to inquire.

Is it possible whales collude with each other to specifically affect certain popular technical indicators? Example "Hey Doug, the MACD is crossing to bullish territory too soon on the 1 hr, lets make sure this does not happen by dumping 100K coins bleh bleh..." I wonder if the collusion gets that granular, specific and egregious.  There isn't any laws forbidding it anyways why would they not want to collude? I definitely would if i was a whale.
How is the liquidity on GDAX for "limit sells" with 1-5 BTC? I would like to be able to set a limit sell, but not incur the market fee. Will it skip right past my order these days if I don't enable market fees?

you can start to panic if we go below 5.9k
Why the pump. Smh we already dropped to 5800 let it go to the right price 🤦🏽‍♂️
Why not sell at 6k now when you can buy back at 4k in a couple of weeks?

Ugh people need to stop buying alts whenever BTC goes up. If they want another alt season BTC needs to hit a new ATH
Lol glad i sold like 70&#37; of my stack that i bought at around $2000 at July 2017 when it dumped from $3000ish because everyone was scared about the first BTC fork way above the current price. Seriously considering selling the remaining 30&#37;. But the pros of selling the remaining 30&#37; seems a little bleak at the current price.

Lol at the downvotes, i dont really care if you're salty. Should have abandoned the DCA strategy completely when it comes to selling and sold in lump sum.
There we go, I hope 5k holds
Order book is stacking up in a very bearish way atm...

Many more sells than buys in a +/- $500 range right now.

I don't think $5755 bottom was a true hammer- I do think we'll need to find one before going on a real bounce/rally though.
I'm planning a bear party if this breaks down. It'll get it's own thread. We'll quote permabulls who called 8k (and 7k and 6k) as the bottom and called for 50k by the summer, and we'll post masturbatory bear charts suggesting sub 1k.
This market psychology is nearly identical to the bull and bust in the metals market in 2012. Silver went parabolic and every bonehead was calling for ridiculous price targets. On the way down, every bounce would be called 'the bottom'. Silver FINALLY settled down around $12-14 all the way from $50. To this day, silver and gold have done nothing. I think the same will happen to BTC. 
Anyone who thinks bitcoin will go back up one day is either delusional or has so much sunk cost fallacy it's sad.

There would be nothing more bullish than one of the four horsemen entering the crypto space 

If Facebook were a country it would be the biggest in the world by population by a long shot: nearly 2 billion people 

I also think it’s a logical move in their part. What platform could better benefit from a border less payment system and currency
I think it’s a race to figure out P2P microtransactions on social media. For example, this could fundamentally change how journalists are compensated. There  are a lot of implications when you empower social media users to pay each other and contributors directly. 
If social media becomes fiat onramps, that would be very bullish in general.    It would be like opening the flood gates for participation.  First people could own coins with less overhead, and then a wave of use cases for the coins would get built on that.
The proposal was passed.

Do you have to report every single trade?
Depending on the number of transactions you traded you should use a tax company. I gave them my downloaded data from all the exchanges I used and they did the rest. Had over 3000 transactions spread over 5 exchanges and it cost me $1600 for them to do it all. So if your profit is a lot higher than 1600, just use that. The taxes I had to pay were also a third of what I thought I'd have to pay. Well worth it.

First bubble cycle, eh? This'll be my second. I've seen this show before. It will eventually recover
Hey The smart money who sold at the top & in between will be buying back in. Lot’s of worthless Fiat & Teather sitting on the sidelines waiting to re-enter. They feel a dark emptiness deep inside to the depths of their soul being no-coiners...
With time.  That simple.  Go look at the 2014 downtrend and 2015 stalled market and compare versus now.  The 2014 decrease is mirroring this one astonishingly well.  Which means our 2022 target is north of $80k, assuming btc dominance doesn't continue getting worse.
Same way it always has. This is just one of Bitcoin's many corrections. I entered Bitcoin during the 2013 hype cycle, bought all the way to the top. Then held and DCA'd in weekly till early 2016 when I hit my coin goal and finally stopped. Then just stopped watching it at all till last year's run. The bad news is if we correct as far as 2013 we could go all the way to 3k. You either believe and you hold, or you learn to trade (it's tough), or you bail and get back in during the next hype cycle.  I admit it's a much different environment now with all the competing coins and blockstream and BCH. It's not as easy to be a long-term holder now as it was then IMO but I believe it will recover, just like it has after every major correction.
I have a feeling that this is the cycle where bitcoin breaks every protocol.  All those 'well after last bubble it did this..' no longer apply.  There was more fomo at 20K than there is now at <6K.  Imagine a bitcoin V2 clone came out now that solved all it's problems.  How much would it be worth? All the money is going towards layer2 development environment coins like ETH, EOS, TRX and these aren't perfect either.  EOS swallowed 4 billion.  The next better version of EOS (that actually works) will also swallow up even more. Lightning Network looks like a bad attempt at what the Ripple protocol already achieves.  Those 50K, 100K, 1M price predictions are only given by people that bought 3 years ago, none of them have recently bought BTC.  They're not going to buy this dip either.  They will put their money into the next Ethereum.
Recover to what price level?   It may be able to recover to $4000 after it bottoms out, but doubtful will recover to $20k.
Don't blink!

Every time I have ever traded with this mindset, it has ended badly. Hope it goes better for you.
Adding to my long from 130 at 5895. Now a third of my trading stack. Good luck.

The best thing would probably have been to stay away from the market until the direction was clearer. 
Following the workout angle, I'd say you're still missing some easy to absorb animal protein in there. Add cottage cheese and some higher quality meet, low fat beef maybe.

Take the people of pompeii, a pyroclastic flow, which is basically a dense gaseous cloud of volcanic rock that travels ~450 mph (that's ~730 kh/h for my European friends here), caused by a volcanic eruption wiped them out almost instaneously.

Imagine the guy taking a shit while that happened, literally breathing air in close to 1800-2000 degrees fareinheit  (~1000 degrees Celsius) and being vaporized while also being entombed in molten rock. THEN ON TOP OF THAT, being found fossilized in said shitting position only to be seen by tourists from all over the world.

Now THAT is a bad dump.

It will get better though dude. 
Sorry bud. Hang in there. Not that it makes it better, you are not alone. 
It happens to the best of us. Best to move on and seek out new opportunities than dwell on this too much. Best of luck.
I know things look grim. I've been waiting for this to happen.

Chin up soldier.  Look at 2014 and 2015.  Yes, we're probably going down, and it may take awhile to recover.  Yes, you can sell now and probably buy back in later to have more bitcoins.

But eventually this will pass.  It will recover and it will begin to rise again.  Maybe not this year.  Maybe not next year.  But you can't stop crypto.

Look at the history and play the game.  Don't get mad over what you've lost, plan for how you're going to do in the next 5 years.  5 years is nothing.
I know the feeling all too well from other poor investments in the past.  I learned the hard way to never go all in or invest more than I could afford to lose (now I count that as 10% of my assets in any one investment)

Not so sure of this, for a falling wedge reversal you need higher volume on the rallies, then high volume on the breakout.  At this stage it seems we have higher volume on the sell-offs.  Volume profile doesn't fit your TA.
Have you drawn the bottom of your wedge touching a grand total of 2 points?

We'll be in $5.7k territory
we broke 5.8k on june 24th, where was this speculation then?
Stopping at 5.8 will paint nice descending triangle, not a reason to long...

Remember that a lot of people are shorting to hedge or use BTC as collateral. They don't need to FOMO, they're already in. And maybe that's the problem... Everyone already bought :-)
We are bulls and as such we hold. But I wonder how many of us are actually buying right now. It seems to me sometimes that the market was built by those of us who are now holders up until, say, 3.5k... then fomo kicked in. Now FUD has kicked in, so the fomo money is withdrawing... and all that is left is us, the ones willing to spend up to 3500 for a coin.

Hope I am wrong.
I'm thankful you didn't project any further...
Not another month of sideways, gah.
Depends, either shorters lost faith that the price will go down short term so we go up, or they make room for another push down...

Yeah I've been looking at the trade history on gdax for eth and there are several decent sized buys going (80-120) while the sell side has orders between 5-20.

I have a feeling the sellers know something that the buyers don't 
Good to see you're not giving up, dawg. I read your comment a few days back about cashing out. Since I also remember your yet another comment about a nice short you opened up in the mid 7ks and closed way lower, I thought for a moment it's a shame you're taking this this hard.

I am not your stalker, btw. ;)

Not log scale, rubbish ;)
it's both, guys...it's both. 
Yeah noobs are selling, especially 8200 noobs, but vets are selling too. 
Because the only sales that are actually driving the price down are large amounts of BTC. (Talking 50+ BTC) And yeah, people with such large amounts are considered whales. 
My only concern is that we haven't seen the DCB that I was expecting when we dropped below 6k the first time a couple of weeks ago. I'm still holding on to my position that averaged at around 6200. At this point, I will just buy more with fresh fiat if it continues to fall and reaches the $4,000 range.
I would think they participate in wash selling large amounts. Not actually legit abandoning positions, but to paint a certain outcome and sentiment on the chart with thousands and thousands of BTC.  I think this is easier to do now that volume is lower compared to earlier in the year.  They would not need nearly as much to paint an indicator a certain way.  

If they are early adopters, I am sure some of them read this subreddit.  After all, they are no different than us except they have a lot of coin.

Right there with you. Im short I believe you’re long correct?
This.
Yes, everything is possible.  That is the scary thing when you look at a 1w chart.
See you in an hour, lol
volume doesn't need to increase until the breakout. 

$9.9k in December was very slow and measured. $10k  break wasn't even that big once the wall broke, all things considered. stood still for a bit and then 12 hours later we were at $11.5k.

Market is in disbelief rn imo. lots of people saying "I'm not convinced" 

but 15m rsi is at like...9 lol 
Perfect set up for weekend dip 
I'm buying.
That was the largest volume 1h candle on Bitfinex in about a week.

Selling is selling...whether you think it is from "panic" or not, it still has the same effect on the price.  The chart says what it says, and I see $5918 on it right now.
I predict a huge move up and down so all stop losses hit, followed by another 18 hours of a big sideways dildo

The direction the market goes. Now would be an awful time to enter a position.

So we're going to loop the loop at 6110 before going up? ;)
we start with a looping
I mean, how many times can you limit buy at 6998 and sell at 7002? I count a half dozen times in the past couple hours alone.
I once did that and it gave me a nosebleed.
Can't post a chart right now, but it seems like we have a similar scenario forming on the 15m 
Weren't you saying the same thing about 7k a month ago?
>In my mind bitcoin under ~~15000~~ ~~13000~~ ~~11000~~ ~~1000~~ ~~7000~~ 6000 is like when you push ball full of air under water. It will pop up back to surface as soon as you get tired pushing it. :)
there is a leak.. water level going down
That would be such a good day. I could finish accumulating, close the charts and forget about bitcoin for a year.

So what is this guy's end goal? 
if we go down then he's Gucci

Warren got liquidated on the run up to $10k :/ 
Yup, it crashed from 20k till now all because people knew coinbase pro was on it's way.  
Market is confused
Longs still hoping and praying.
After 14k we went to 20k.
So you say that after 6k we go to 4.2k.
The coil is definitely compressing, no doubt. Up or down, not sure yet.
Hulk smart.
This post aged as well as Madeleine McCann 
not really
The bears are back in town
HOLD UP, did u/diydude just post something that WASN'T bullish!?
Why would they have waited until now? Makes no sense
Throwing a thought out there:  


Bitcoin Suisse launched a crypto vault a couple of days ago, aimed at the whale market. Maybe these 45k are going there?
indeed, up or down 😋
Actually starting to look like a descending triangle on 1h. 
I really don't get it... ETH going up (or trying to) while BTC wants to go down... 

Until 2 days ago ETH was almost free falling only holding when BTC went up...
I don't have a lot of fiat designated for BTC outside what I trade. I sold it at 7000, and I have 20x 5% buys every $60 from $6000 to $4800. It would give me a CA at $5400, which should be a good entry long term. If we get below $4800, I may actually devote additional fiat to BTC. Depends how well I'm doing shorting it. 
I reach a monthly DCA figure by taking 10% of my cash and divide it over 24 months (that's the timeframe that i have in mind for DCAing into Bitcoin). That figure is also something I can afford to lose 50% or more of, assuming Bitcoin continues to lose value over the next 2 years.
My plan is to watch the volatility.  I'm looking for starkly low volatility on multiple timelines(30d, 45d, 60d, 90d).  That was the good time to buy during past cycles, and that's when me (and friends waiting for my word) will move to buy.

Based on the history I'd say there's a very high chance of a 75% bottom (5k or lower), a good chance of a 4k bottom(80%), and a moderate chance of a 3k bottom (85%).  Low and very very low for 90% and 95%.  At that point I'll be buying huge if it happened.
Have to be honest: I am DCA-ing here on a monthly basis. I am doing that because (a) we have lost 70% of value since ath, (b) I have no idea where the bottom is (although i have potential targets for that), (c) I believe in Bitcoin for the future, and (d) I would like to limit my losses in case Bitcoin drops to as low as <2k. DCA-ing thus allows me to be invested in an asset that I believe to be valuable, even though I believe the current downtrend will continue for at least until the end of this year. 

I have said previously that I think large-scale accumulation at 6k or anything above that is very unlikely to be happening. Potential upside continues to be very limited, while the downside risks are huge. The technology isn't mature enough for large scale use, spot markets are unregulated, and the market continues to ascribe value to thousands of useless coins.

So people here need to wake up and smell the roses. BTCUSD's breakdown from the 18-week symmetrical triangle is significant. The fact that we are dawdling just above 6k despite the lack of any significant selling pressure is bad for the bulls and good for the bears. GBTC shares are being sold heavily because main street investors are paring back risks associated to Bitcoin-related investments in what is currently an uncertain environment for global investors: these guys aren't selling GBTC to buy actual bitcoins. 

That doesn't mean that people shouldn't buy Bitcoin or other crypto projects that they believe in. Rather, they should tailor their buying strategy with the expectation that this downtrend may continue for a while and they should expect losses (or in the scenario this space is legally suppressed by governments, that they may never see that money again). Going long all-in here or with any significant portion of your assets is a recipe for disaster. 
"This is heavily manipulated."

The excuse used to explain all BTCs negative price action 

Surprisingly never used to explain positive price action

I mean it's impossible that people just wanted to sell right? It has to be some devious and mysterious group of crypto whales suppressing the price.
This is just the beginning of the pain. It’s going to get a lot worse very soon.
I disagree. You don't know what I do to my mattress.
Damn the fact that this is getting upvoted means people must be hurting 
r/BitcoinMarkets be like "This looks like accumulation to me"

>Your money is literally better stuffed in your mattress.

Long term? Definitely not. Bitcoin is sound money, fiat is inflationary and centrally issued.
> Your money is literally better stuffed in your mattress.


Are you literally retarded? This is the best opportunity you've had since last year to get rich. It might take a couple years, but this will not go to zero, and when it comes back, it will bankrupt the mighty.

Let me rephrase that last bit: it will bankrupt the haughty. They are not so mighty in the face of Bitcoin's awesome power.
It's business time
It’s hammer time 

*Cant touch this*
For what?
I told you you'd be able to buy lower. 
Not gonna happen
That's what, <\~1 day? Absolute eternity.
What usually happens when futures close/open?
WTF is with those Kraken wicks? Is it low liquidity on there? It seems like they are the only exchange to have outlier wicks.
its not a conspiracy, jesus. drop the uk out of the URL and all the data returns. 
You are looking at the UK version. It's all still there. e.g. https://www.tradingview.com/u/MagicPoopCannon/
maybe they got caught for doing shady stuff. Kind of like when your runescape stats would be reset after you got caught for botting.
It’s hard to lose a lot with stocks 
\>still holding

\>selling here to try and catch the bottom is just a good way to get left behind since the move up will be pretty damn violent

You should start browsing some of the altcoin subreddits tbh to check your biases. Its bagholding 101 to prevent people from selling lol. BTC can indeed go up from here but remember holding is what got you up to this point.

Literally every altcoin subreddit im lurking with the exception of r/SaltTrader is giving pep talks about holding and getting others not to sell.

On the plus side, its been so many weeks without a relief rally.
>move up will be

Guys, should we tell him?
not saying it won't go lower eventually, but before it does, we are due for a rally to reset the market 
I'm with you on that one, don't listen to ppl married to shorting low
Lmao, what if 50 BTC is like 0.1% of his coins and he is doing low risk position sizing?
Probably gets a fee rebate or something if that order gets filled and it also probably hedges on other exchanges and shit.

Of course it could go lower, but this is a logical spot to make a dca entry imo.
My thinking is most of the damage is already done dropping from $20.000 to $6000. Maybe this is not absolute bottom, but I don't think it can go down much further. I'm buying.
Wait. You want to see higher highs and higher lows over a timespan of like two or three weeks... It might take a while before we see a reversal.
Dont know how you can time a bottom without knowing at least sime TA that can give you good entry and exit prices. Whether you think it works or not it does give you ways to enter and exit a market in a decent manner
I wouldn't start now...would wait until either a clear reversal or maybe when price is down to $2500 or so.  Although even then, it could drop 50%.  So no perfect answer, but TA says "don't start now".
Sluymer is the guy who told people to buy the top in May, he makes generally bad calls every few weeks and isn't he also the one authoring the mining-cost-price-floor-crap at Fundstrat?
>Why not push it further down already to accumulate more BTC for a lower/better price?

Well, in this hypothetical, it might be cost prohibitive to push it down much more from here, and they might risk crowding the trade with people buying the dip and closing shorts. (We've seen pretty high buy pressure under $6,000 recently. IF their goal is to accumulate, then they don't want too many other people to start buying) Additionally if the intent is to raise the price at some point in the near future, they may not want to drop it down too low because this could turn people away, and they still need retail money to FOMO when they pump it back up
\>Why not push it further down already to accumulate more BTC for a lower/better price?

Because they run the risk of some other whale buying the dip incredibly hard. See the dump to $5,700. Its entirely possible that a whale tried to push BTC down by market selling all the way down and some other whale bought the dip.
> Why not push it further down already to accumulate more BTC for a lower/better price?

Because that's the goal of bag holders.  The goal of whales is to dump their bags on people willing to buy hyped up internet tokens with zero use cases.
My alts barely budged, just a small breeze. Waiting those 140 MPh hurricanes gusts. 
Xmr up against the tide 
Well they vastly outnumbered shorts when we first dipped to 6k in Feb as well. Unfortunately we aint bouncing fuck
I wouldn't say a 1.33:1 ratio is vast outnumbering. The ratio has been as much as 3:1 in recent memory. 
I'm long from $2937... *in my heart*
No, we were lower just a couple hours ago, albeit briefly, wicking down to 5822. Surely some longs *could* have opened there. So it isn't totally safe to say that ALL longs are underwater.
We hit 5755 a couple days ago, so no. Plus I'm sure plenty of people are still long from 2017
Far from it
a long from 12 months ago is nowhere near underwater, so no. 
Lol come on
just like in early 2015 when everyone said it was "dead" and "boring" and I picked up coins for 150-200 bucks (arh good times).
Same I want more time to accumulate
do the opposite of stop losses and make money 8)
And the time before that (April 11th 2018) we jumped $1,000 by the next day.

Shorts were considerably stacked at the same time however... which they are not currently.
I admittedly only glanced over it, but I don't see anything about crypto?
ummmm has 0 relevance to crytpo currency. Thanks for cluttering the thread with your idiocy.
I was told it was a double bottom and we were out of the woods are the last time we went over 10k!
I'm confused, the links there lead to a "send btc/eth to this address, and we send you btc/eth back", which is the classic scam.  But the first twitter page is a verified account.  WTF is going on.

edit: Ok, figured it out, scam link is int he same twitter feed, replying to @cz\_binance, but the scam link is sent from @czm\_binance
Context? is binance down or something?
That market movements did not follow your predictions do not necessarily make them bizarre.
I’ve noticed the disappearance of the Sept discount as well, since I generally trade the U markets. Is it possibly because June and Sept futs generally move together, and June futures are about to close? I can’t see any other reason why Sept discount would be smaller than it was on the squeeze up to $6350.
"ridiculously high" 

5% up...:P

your dildos are small m8 really need a bigger imagination
That could go well or terribly. Good luck
If it gets a dildo like that, the margin of error is big. 6400? 6600? Who knows? And why would it go right back down again? There might be a short term downwards bounce, but other than that, it's gonna be half this sub and their momma gonna call this the next moon and jump on the buy train.

So quite risky play, is what I'd say. Went the opposite way myself, keeping a relatively big short open, but with a flip buy just 1.5% higher. Should at least get me on the train any which way this decides to spike. 
This too is my play as of a few hours ago. Here's to hoping!
Suspense is the right word! Some shit about to go down.
crazy how accurately a global market hits lines like that- mind fucks me
>Bounced perfectly off ascending support,

The answer is right in front of you.
But where's the boots with the fur?
$6K isn't goblin town. We've been here 3 times this year. This is nothing new. Goblin town is generally thought of as revisiting July-September 2017 levels. 
What is this? Goblin town for ants?

I've always been under the impression  that hidden divs are for continuation, regular divs for reversal. As we have clearly been in a downtrend lately, I wouldn't be looking out for hidden bull divs. 
Bitcoin is on a slow grind to 0. It's not scary or anything else, just the way it is.

Good for Bitcoin. Whales like to share and make everyone rich.
Makes flag breakdowns more likely as there are fewer shorts closing out.
I'm an idiot, sorry for the shitty comment
10x 100% here? Damn...
Not sure why you’re being down-voted.

Not best reason to open a short, but not the worst.  
How do you see volume on your Bitmex chart in tradingview? The normal volume indicator doesn't show anything for swaps I guess?
Well this is working out rather well for you.
Smart money in my mind means good risk management and loss mitigation. It's something I've been trying to learn since losing massive profits in the bubble pop. 

I honestly thought we had reached critical mass in the last bull run and we were going to straight shoot to 50k at least. 40% drop later and I was still holding, thinking it was just yet another BTFD scenario. After a full 60% drop I knew things were different, and then I realized I had no game plan past moon. 

I'll hopefully be smarter next time. Please just give me a better bull run to prove it ;)



Been repeating the same damn thing since the downtrend lol. Most of the people who sold could literally buy more BTC right now than the HODLERs. Dont fight the trend.
It's a beautiful thing to watch you continually post about how things are looking bullish...whilst the price drops consistently
How do you know smart isn't waiting for 3k to buy? Maybe holding and buying now is just between being smart and dumb. 
Really dude. And 8 upvotes? This confirms we’re not even close to capitulation. 
Most probably the dumbest statement i have ever heard of.  lol

I agree with almost everything except that last part. You can blink. You can blink many times. The price is not just going to skyrocket from here. It will take time for this to recover so imo everyone should be doing the opposite of what you just said. Take your time and wait for this to bottom out. You can blink, it's okay.

I don’t think there is, but there are no withdraw or other fees. 
How do you feel about Binance?  Because Gemini trading fees are currently exorbitant.  I speak as a fellow person that has been banned from Coinbase.  I only use Gemini as a fiat onramp.
Try Kraken.  Their fees are reasonable especially for larger volume
Been watching this bear trap since 20k. Any idea where it ends? I'm tired of making money on my short...
current selloff because Germany out the World Cup. They cashed out BTC to buy handkerchief 
classic no buyers in sight more down to go. Lower lows inbound.

You don't need balls to buy here if you are a long term holder.
It doesn't take balls to buy here.  Just put a 1% stop and you are fine.
I would lie saying I'm comfortable holding my long from 130, but If I was a bear I would be pretty stressed as well. The possibilities of getting bullied by a big green candle is high.
some people are just closing their shorts in big profit

Seems plausible for sure. I'm expecting a solid 1-3 months of basically sideways and boring as all hell somewhere between now and the next bull though, similar to the $250 range and the $450 range last cycle. 
Bart-approved downvote.
I'm not super into the pennant as it is formed currently, but I would measure the downside target at 5510 and the upside target at 6477. Interestingly, the upside target would define a rising wedge while also breaking the downtrend resistance line from 7700.

Price has dropped 14000. 
Well what do you think it means when the market collectively doesn't believe in the bounces but panics on small moves down? 

Where would that mean the path of least resistance is? 🤔
Taken out of the context of an almost 75% consistent drop from ATH months ago... 
That's what we said when BTC was around 7k too lol. We don't know what BTC price is. It is what it is. 
we're in yet another bear flag, we've been bear flagging and dumping for 2 months.
I've read that the worldwide average for the marginal cost of mining is right around $6,000.  I'm sure those companies can operate at a marginal loss for a while.  It'll be interesting to see how long the price can exist at and under this level.  At some point you'd think the mining whales would have to boost the price, right?
You just had to open your mouth didn't you... :/
There's a bit of difference between, "Bitcoin is in a bubble, and a correction will likely come soon" and "Bitcoin is ratpoison squared and I would short it all the way down to zero where it belongs if I had an instrument to do so."
I don't think any of them gave price targets. Dimon bashed bitcoin before the 5k-20k run and Gates after the bubble popped. Their opinions are useless for trading, anyone here could tell you the 2017 Bitcoin run was a speculative bubble.
Yeah I'm seeing the same thing on the 1 min, pretty much gives us the full story of what's going to happen in the next 2 years

It's based on your trading volume of the last month or so. So if you trade less than before, the fee goes back up.
There is a time window. After some time some volume does not count.
Are you from the us? If not, i would switch to bitmex for sure, that sounds horrible...
Fees don't change tiers permanently. They're calculated dynamically based on your trading volume from the last x days (30, I think). 
You’re right about the last part at least. After I lost money on a successful short on a $100 move a few months ago, I decided Kraken wasn’t worth messing with.
Even if you have traded a decent amount, it still wouldn't make much sense to just give you a great rate in perpetuity, would it?
Lol that's just because btc value is dropping so much

$1 million USD @ $8k BTC = 125 BTC volume

$1 million USD @ $7k BTC = 143 BTC volume

btc volume naturally rises with loss in fiat value, despite the same amount of fiat trading.
Hail to the king.
Worth watching him sometimes but dont listen to him blindly
I usually watch the price analysis portion of his morning briefs and like his sequential indicator. He's been right a lot more than he's been given credit for recently, and just won his bet that we'd drop below 6k this year. But he's not the most knowledgeable guy and his TA isn't very useful for day trading. Goes without saying nobody should listen to him blindly, but that's the same for any analyst. 
Weird hair, silly accent.

You're right this is the moon. Many people can sell here at life changing profit. In fact, many people are. Even 1200 is the moon to some people. All those people that bought at 8k...well they are the bag holders, and there are many of them too.

Weren’t we just at 6-6.3 for a few weeks?
This is gonna be heavy resistance when we bounce from 3k.
It would make sense to confirm 6100 support as resistance, assuming we didn't last through 
LOL we were there just this afternoon... I wouldn't be that pessimistic... yet.

Yes this probably happens. Unregulated market.
It was probably more common in the past than now.  Entropy and coin dispersion and whatnot -- fewer whales now.  And those whales that *do* exist are probably a lot more fearful nowadays of an even bigger fish lurking around the corner.  Like, Goldman sachs type fish.

But what do I know.
You can bet on it. But there exist whales on both sides. Right now, the whales on the long side are winning, believe it or not. It's costing many millions to drive the price down 3% for a very short.period of time. Wasn't that long ago that a $1 million sell would plunge the price 10% and keep it there. 

Things are lookin' great for buyers and hodlers right now, maybe not so great for traders, but what else is new.
It won't skip.

I’ve been panicking since 20k 
5.4 is ATH line, going below will be where you should panic.
and we there
Won't be long.
Why panicky the lower lows are assured 
I recommend researching more about market mechanics, specifically RSI. Pair that knowledge with understanding that bots and traders will look for cues to execute. Also consider that to close a short is to buy.

Technical bounces are to be expected. 
Because nobody knows the price 2 hours from now, let alone 2 weeks.
The only thing that keeps some people from panic selling is doing nothing at all - I call it panic holding 😅
Why sell at 6k when you could have sold at 16k and can dca back in without a care about this bottom splashing?
The only reason not to is fear of the BGD. Otherwise it seems clear-cut that we're going way down.
makes sense to me.
There is - it is another those rumor 'software codes'

That’s basically the daily thread 
the demagoguery is strong with this one
How low until we pop the champagne?
yea but silver and gold had already been fully adopted by society for thousands of years, where as Bitcoin just 9 years and not adopted at all.  At a market cap of 100billion or even its ATH of 330 billion, how many people actually own it?  Less than 1%?  how do you get around that argument?  If we get another set of buyers, whether it be a retail surge, or the infamous institutional buyers, or the ETF and people can easily buy with their retirement, wouldn't that make the price go crazy?
Had you put $10k in vanilla in 2012 it’d be worth $100k right now (not a joke)

But what does it have to do with crypto? Comparing commodities, metals, real estate and so on to crypto just can’t be right 
They have done a lot better than cash.
I think the difference is the halvenings that are programmed and known finite amount of BTC.
Clearly identical, gold and silver had as much development as Bitcoin during that same timeframe.

Yeah this looks very droppy. Like almost too droppy.
This is inevitable.  They will continue to crack down and limit the use of crypto in the name of stopping terrorism, kiddie porn, and human trafficking.  And plenty of dumb people will believe their motives are pure and go along with it all...not that anyone cares that much about crypto anyway, but if they do care, they will be more against it.

Nice thanks for posting, here's the relevant portion:

"A proposal that would permit certain exchange-traded funds to operate without first obtaining a fund-specific exemptive order from the Commission, which is a process that has not changed since the first ETF was approved in 1992." 
This shouldn't have any short-term impact on Bitcoin. Long-term, maybe these changes will some impact on the proposed rule changes. Someone with more knowledge about that should chime in.
> Custom basket policies and procedures.  An ETF relying on proposed rule 6c-11 would be permitted to use baskets that do not reflect a pro-rata representation of the fund’s portfolio or that differ from other baskets used in transactions on the same business day (“custom baskets”) if the ETF adopts written policies and procedures setting forth detailed parameters for the construction and acceptance of custom baskets that are in the best interests of the ETF and its shareholders.  The proposed rule also would require an ETF to comply with certain recordkeeping requirements.
I'm using CoinTracking.info I think it does make things easier, but sometimes the numbers don't balance out and you have to go in and tweak things. 
In the USA, yes, as of currently. It's one of the things that I think we need to seriously fix. The shittiest thing about US tax laws is that we even have to pay capital gains taxes if we use Bitcoin for transactions such as if you buy a cup of coffee you would have to pay capital gains tax. It seriously needs to be fixed.
Problem is alot of the exchanges will only hold on to the last 3 months of your trading history.

Well said.  Fyi, i recommend diversifying somewhat like an index fund would.  As far as I can tell, there's nothing that could prevent crypto from going though further similar cycles, but that doesn't mean bitcoin will perform on par with everything else.

The long is really just a hedge for having most of my stack in fiat right now. This way if we get the BGD to 8k when I go take a shit I can be a part of that move. If we drop to 5k I will be able to buy more coins at spot with the fiat on gdax. 

The 5x long is still a very significant amount of money for me though. I just feel confident it will bounce before hitting 4.5kish.

Sorry mods, give me this one, I'm trying to stay sane:

I have been lifting / intense dieting for a few years now, but have aways wanted to try this diet. I'm taking intra-workout amino acids to reduce turnaround time and aid in protein absorption and utilization. I've read up on L-carnitine and might supplement with it. Also supplementing with bronkaid as an appetite suppressant as well as CLA for healthy fats. I'll essentially recomp (lose fat while gaining a bit of muscle) this month, then lead into a multi month lean bulk! 
There is literally no such thing as "animal protein".

Any and all protein ever consumed by anything came from a plant first.

it's like looking directly into God's anus...wondrous
Eh, I look at the 1W chart while squinting. If you look too closely you can miss the forest for the trees.
just think of all the debt taken out to finance large mining ops in the second half of last year, all the debt created to finance speculation... i can definitely see it being an albatross on price for awhile.
Clenched anus 
Yup, but I prefer TC. It kinda 'on the fly' short term analyses/sums up everything. Easier to look at.
I think this comes from drawing a descending wedge on 1d chart and looking for three bounces from top or bottom, this curent price being the beginning of bounce 2 and bounce 3 is in the 5000-5500 range. however a dump here would obviously break this pattern.
you don't need a reason. 

we are oversold on the daily, we crashed down from $9,980 without any relief rallies along the way(long term rally that shows a significant move up, none of this $100-200 bs), and just went down for 2 months straight. nothing goes down forever, sooner or later, sellers get exhausted and bulls get a chance to push back up for a month or two

Now if this turns into a bull market, we'll get above $10,000 this time and the bear market will be officially over. 

If this is still a bear market and this move is just a dead cat bounce, then the push back up will run out of steam below $9,980 and will head back down to find a lower low. I'm betting on $8,600 because thats around the 38.2% fib retracement target and is also a pretty big resistance point. 

Ofcourse it can also go to the 50% fib retracement, which would put the target at $9,150. 

Bitcoin proponents are holding a holographic Charizard and think they're better than a partly ripped Pikachu.

l was just banging my head on the wall for moving up my SL 10 minutes before the wipeout wick lol

I appreciate it man
I should have clarified. Those are not EWs. Its just a bitch to draw 10 separate trendlines on Tradingview. :)
 Yeah, well, you know, *that's just*, *like*, *your opinion*, *man*.
Nice one, thanks!
Imagine if there were three, or more, factors at play. Now that would really be a mindfuck!
no, its one whale doing it. That guy hates us. Fuck him for making us poor.
TIL im a whale. 

Whales start at 10k coins+.

1k coins maybe a small whale. 

Anything less is a fish.
That seems likely, but what about legit rich people who got in recently?
We had the DCB - 5755 to 6341 which is more than 10%. What do you mean there was no DCB?

Yes averaged long at 6060... If liquidated I will stop trading for some time. I needed to lose 30% of my stack to remember how much I value my Bitcoins and how much I hate losing them. 
They're worth more than gold for me.

We will ALL win long term. So just try not to f..k things up doing greedy trades.

Good luck !
Exactly this. Longs piling up, shorts closing and we're still going down. Who's selling if everyone think this is the bottom?
I'm not convinced.
You’re memory is phenomenal. 

Wouldn’t this be consider the breakdown though? Binance has only gone up about 25 mil since dump 
I'm with you on this one sloppy

Edit: you think we can get the 15 min rsi below 5? I honestly just want to see happen just because lol
yeah, but you're u/obliviousdipshit 
When people start seriously panic selling, I think that’s when we will see the **TRUE** bottom. People still holding onto their butts rn. 
Not if you choose the right direction but you’re gambling

Boring
I'm in agreement. 
That's too much data for my eyes to take in, my friend. Haha
Interestingly, BTCUSDSHORTS are behaving inversely compared to that 3 day range.
It's definitely hard. If I didn't have a short entry on September equivalent to about 6145, I'd be a bit more stressed. I seesawed this position several times yesterday to get my CA up to 6113. 
Same here. Typed in the order 5 times and did not press sell yet. 100% hedged on june futs tho.
Lol, market isn't good at longs right now ;)

Great question. On the face of it, "pick up pennies in front of the steamroller and then get rekt for a five-figure loss," it seems like.
provide liquidity and market make 
True, except it's not a static bid. The problem with these bots is, they only buy when nobody's selling, and sell when nobody's buying. It's only putting the 50 BTC bid up when the other exchanges drift up, just like he did with the ask with exchanges drifting down.
That is what I am currently implying, yes
The rubberbands are very tight 
Hulk smash.
ayyyy
Dude...
I deal with reality. The other side of the above is that if they were moving coins off exchange, it could force a big covering event. 

If it does dive, I'll just try to calculate a probable bottom based on volume and add to my long from 6300 there so not entirely bearish even if it does dump.
Maybe their investment is in trying to kill Bitcoin by pushing the price down. If I were a banker, I'd certainly be willing to lose $100 million to eliminate this threat. It won't work, but for some people it might be worth a try.

It also could have been a whale moving coins off exchange, in which case, it would be a bullish sign. I guess we'll see.
Nice idea but its too much BTC for that.
as always :D
chart?
There was a rumor that EOS was dumping eth and was almost out of eth to dump a few days ago. Whether you want to put stock into an old wives tale is up to you 
EOS ran out of ethers to sell? 
I'm working on something similar but I'm waiting for December futures which should open any day now and start a DCA there. Might start here or 5500, depends how the next few days develop.
Love this strategy haserfauld and I think those are the perfect layers and bottom target. I think this is the best DCA plan specially for people who took profits higher and is basically what I am doing.

For new entrants or those who are inclined to FOMO they could also try a time based DCA. That's what I did in the 2014 bear. After I got half of what I wanted to put in I just set a weekly buy on Coinbase and let it run for 2 years and ignored the price. This prevented me from FOMO and allowed me to get buys on some of the lowest prices.

With all that said I don't think this bear lasts as long as that one so I would favor the price based DCA over the next 4-5 months.
I have a tingly feeling we might bottom somewhere above 5k leaving everyone in the dust. Too many people, myself included, are waiting for the 3-5k range eagerly. IDK, just spidey senses. Charts still look rekt we probably will go that low
Not in that sense. I am talking about manipulated price action. The way it moves.
RemindMe! very soon
Says the guy who is down 100k and hates the world now 
agreed.  Memory foam doesn't forget.
Nah, it really means the people who come here to comment and read when the price is dropping are not all the same people who come here to comment and read when the price is increasing.
It is not accumulation, it is diffusion. 
I am quite sure this level of arrogance and certainty was similarly displayed by those who bought into railway stocks while that bubble was deflating. 

You definitely seem over and emotionally invested to me.

yes
increase in volatility
GDAX has them sometimes, and MEX has them on futures--especially the 6-month futures. 

Yes it's a function of low liquidity and people using market orders/stops.
They’re amazing for getting awesome entires 

But absolutely terrible for placing stops in realistic places. 

Low liquidity 
Take a look at the GoPro chart, or better yet, HTC.
If you're trading individual stocks it's damned easy to lose a lot. People are so used to index funds they sometimes forget how brutally volatile lower market cap stocks can be. 
Jesus salt got destroyed 
yes, except if you look at RSI on the daily, any time we've been oversold this much, a bounce soon followed 
Nah he won't believe it anyways. Just remind him in a year
I'm watching and waiting...
Did it just bounce up from $5800 a few days ago? How many resets does it need before it's allowed to go down?
they definitely have way more. market making bots would be useless if they only had 60 btc in store 

one big sell/buy would wipe em out 
It's not about being relative to his total stack, it's about being relative a) to the size of the movement and to a lesser extent b) to what the market will bear.

RE: the first point:

* Betting 50 BTC that the market will go to $5K or $7K = makes sense
* Betting 50 BTC based on a couple of dollars difference between exchanges that lasts for a few seconds = crazy

RE: the second point:

If he gets taken out at an inopportune time, getting 50 BTC back on a market that's doing around 5K 24-hour BTC volume with embarrassingly low liquidity is...an uphill battle, to say the least.
The fee is $0 for limit orders, but that doesn't explain how he gets his 50 BTC back if someone snaps up his ask and the price pumps.

Interesting theory about the hedge, but seems unworkable at first glance...very complicated. Instant 50 BTC hedge would be extremely difficult without slippage, and then again, where is the profit here?
This is a common market fallacy. One that traps many more people into buying. Lose that thinking quick unless you want to lose more money. 
> they may not want to drop it down too low because this could turn people away, and they still need retail money to FOMO when they pump it back up

Thanks! Yeah, that would make sense indeed.
smaller whale got rekt by a bigger whale.
The goal of bag holders is to drive the price down further? 

I'm doing this all wrong.

> The ratio has been as much as 3:1 in recent memory.

...in a raging bull market. Given the current conditions of the market even the ratio of 4:3 is worrisome, IMHO. Looks like denial to me.
I’m long from $550 but sold at $2250... that was some crazy volatility between $2000 and $2900 and I panicked. Little did I know, but Profit is profit. Of course, I bought much higher and learned my lesson too well & still holding down from ATH. What a dumbass...seems almost to late to get out now.
I'm not sure about that. You do have to pay fees to keep a position open. Even if they are long from 1k their liquidation point should slowly be inching up. I'm sure you can do the math and figure it out but I feel like at least 85% of the longs open right now are underwater.
long $200 area so no but still selling.
Given that it was only sub-$200 for...a couple days? And $200-$300 for many months, you probably picked up your coins for $200-$300 if you accumulated at the bottom of 2015.

The proposed rule also would require an ETF to comply with certain recordkeeping requirements.

Twitter really ought to clean this up and cancel fake accounts. I'm sure some newbies are falling for this shit and loosing their ETH, otherwise scammers wouldn't keep on trying.
Funny how BNB price jumped immediately even though nobody knows what it is. Someone said margin trading, which makes sense, given they just recetly added TradingView charts to cater to more advanced traders. Would be sweet to be able to short all the shitcoins.
No, read in the comments. They are just launching another ETH giveaway.. these guys... 

Edit: While that was obvious sarcasm, it seems like they are just hosting another wash trading event sponsored by Tron. 
No context
Nothing to do with my predictions. Anyone that has watched futures premiums/discounts adjust based on price action and market sentiment for the past 6 months would call this bizarre. Discounts do not flip to premiums on stale prices. Hell, we were still at a premium at 8400 after falling from 10K.
Maybe people are moving from June to Sept so buying pressure is higher there, but I don't know why June is rising then. 

It feels like MEX futures traders know something I don't know. 
$6500 from here seems ridiculously high lol 

I could place them at $7200 but it would take days/Weeks/months to fill.

Short term, $6500 is ridiculously high considering the amount of resistance we have hit in the $6350 range/ the blue line/red line 


Tad bit of a gamble. Realistically if my $6500+ short gets filled, I dont see us going any higher than that for the time being. A $500+ dildo with the lack of shorts open is an absolute stretch so the r/r isn’t terrible. The chances of pushing above $6600 in an instant are pretty slim. 

If we get a Dildo and her stopped out at 10k line, I’ll just pull my high orders and short the resistance. 



My orders are only high due to the lack of liquidity on Kraken. On yesterday’s spike, Kraken went $90 over Finex price. So if our resistance is $6420-$6440, 90$ over the price would be $6530. Hoping to get lucky.

Like every BGD, you usually see the initial BGD fomo that over extends on price and goes a lot higher, then to settle sometimes $30-75$ less than the top of the Dildo price.

Back in my day goblin town was down 94%.  You kids these days.  We had to walk uphill both ways to get our bitcoins.
Someone add it to urban dictionary, I've seen it described both ways, but the consensus was low volume, empty houses, a few inhabited by goblins, thus goblin town.

Edit: for what it's worth, we're below July-September volume wise.
What does goblin town mean 
Hidden bear divs are all over the nasdaq but it keeps going up. In a bull market, the hidden bull divs can be taken as a higher probability of prevailing.

He's saying people are jumping the gun and getting long expecting this to go up from here. The same way the shorters kept adding up to 3K that where ultimately rocket fuel. I think you just misread his comment (maybe you didn't and there's something else I missed)
I actually meant 50%. 10x 50%, i.e. 5x. I'm always confused as which way to write it, so I just leave it 100% usually and write it out of the total, 5x.

I'll close this out quickly if it turns around.
What are you looking for for an entry? Close below 6K? Break of 5.8K?
Works by default for me. Maybe you have it switched off or the settings are wrong?

Why your shutdown?
Not only do the bears have a voice now, but they're cocky too ;)


Bottom is not far away methinks.
Left right left right B A B A select start.


Why is it stupid to say I think this *might* happen? 

Longer term trends are *just starting* to turn bearish. What I drew is a reasonable scenario if we are indeed only half way through a bear market. Unless you think the true bottom is near, why is what I drew so hard to believe?

Obviously this model is subject to constant change and refinement.

He has also been sending me unsolicited harassing PMs me at least once a week and following me into unrelated non-bitcoin subs raving about "Bcash." Completely unbalanced.

Now watch as he responds here and tries to flip the script by accusing me of harassment for posting the above information, even though I have not responded to any of his hysterical PMs.

I know I'm repeating myself here, but the guy needs some serious help. 



As a recent target of his personal crusade, I thank you for sharing this.... 
You're confused as to the nature of the situation. People already knew I was mmcakes, hence why everyone was hurr durr. I only went into that thread after I was banned to get the last word in against that *actual* sockpuppet user, knowing full well that mods would ban that account to once they saw it.

Don't confuse yourself about what happened.

Why would I continually post charts under this name if I were hiding something?
It was my previous account. Not exactly an an active "alt". I don't use both concurrently or that one much at all anymore.

But yes, if you're asking if I log into that account to talk to myself and upvote my own content, the answer is emphatically yes.
Yeah it could certainly make a wide rounded bottom but if it capitulates to the bottom sharply, then my guess is a V-bottom before reaching a substantially higher plateau. I don't think it'll bottom out in the 1Ks or 2Ks for long, if it even gets there. I'm more inclined to believe a rounded bottom would occur somewhere higher, perhaps at 3K or 4K.

yea it's a tad off to me, not your drawing, just my interpretation of the pennant. Be interesting to see what happens in the next 6 hours or so though. 
im sorry you got in so late :/
im sorry you got in so late :/
Every "bear flag" on the daily has broken up these past few weeks 

Edit: let me rephrase this, everyone here seems to think that when we are at the lowest part of the flag that we are going to drop, when in fact, we typically make an attempt at the 12 day EMA before heading back down and fully breaking support hence why all those flags are pointing up
Yeah everyone can say it after a 70% crash. Hindsight 20/20 on this one.

Slimy.
Perfect, they encourage you to overtrade for less fees and when you want to be smart and trade less, they come back and raise the fees 
How did that happen 
You cannot come in here and just start throwing numbers around like that. 
You are right but I doubt its relevant, alts not reacting to this crash is interesting.
My thoughts too
Bagholder here...
6.3... 5.6.... 6.1... ehh its all the same from 1000 ft up. 9k to 6k is a 33% drop. Now we are fluctuating in a 5% range. For me, anything above 5.3k roughly is sideways. Talking about major trends, totally not applicable when you zoom in, that's a different story for sure :)
There is no free money and that strategy works until it doesn't.
There is more consolidation of coins in the richest wallets addresses than ever before.  Is it crazy to think these large holders have been working together to devour the small fish?  I feel like if they were smart they would do so, there's no legal repercussions after all and it's easier than ever to communicate with others secretively and covertly.
Thanks, I don't want it to slide right past my sell and only partially fill or something and get left hanging. 

So 1-5 BTC limit sell without market fees and slippage features and I shouldn't worry even with the low volume, that is good. 
I have been picknicking since then... 
you can start to panic if we go below 5.8k
It's probably harder to predict the price 2 hours from now than 2 weeks from now. 
Good traders and speculators don't need to know the future with certainty to calculate probabilities and profit from them.
Yup. How do you get the emoji into your comment?
Why sell at 16k when in a few years it will be 100k? We are traders here dude. 
Not clear-cut but extremely likely. 
Yup. that short squeeze was an anomaly and people have probably restrained from selling hoping for another BGD when it was clear we are going down. This will cause them to actually panic sell the bottom at 3-4k
it's fake.
image appears doctored, unfortunately. 
There’s high probability it won’t happen, but it wouldn’t shock me if we moved sideways here for a while.

You open another short? 
Lol. Forgot about that. I'm just so mind numbingly bored right now.

Of course it can. Investors tend to make the same mistakes over and over and it's highly visible in all markets.
If you think development moves price, good luck to you!
That's the biggest load of BS. The whole pump was orchestrated due to that garbage people were spreading. If you actually believe that, seek help.

Well of course they are going to go after anonymous cryptos.

It's true to an extent that they are used for illicit activities, so why not take the easy route and ban them, it's not like you can ban USD.

There is no way governments around the world, beyond the US, would allow the proliferation of anonymous cryptos.

This is the real world we live in, not some kind of idealistic fantasy.

"ever" is a long time, but what are the odds in the next three years is a better question.   I would say it's probably greater than 50% probability, but not by much.  

There is just too much money to be made by pumping BTC, so unless the regulators really crack down on that, another manipulated pump is likely at some point.
I don't feel like I can judge anyone friend, but read yourself: "going down with the ship". "a very significant amount of money for me". "be a part of that move". "I just feel confident".

Seems like gambling to me.

EDIT: Wish you the best of luck and the greatest of success.
This is a troll thread now, but I'll respond anyway. It's not about the actual protein content. It's about the overall quality of the meat. Most chicken you get in the supermarkets are birds basically manufactured in factories, force-fed, stuffed with antibiotics and steroids, quickly grown, quickly slaughtered. As I wrote very clearly, ~comparatively~, quality pork or quality beef are much better and healthier sources of protein, i.e. better quality meat. But hey man, you can eat any shit you want.

Idk...a bunch of rich people bought 2500 coins at $17250 on GDAX. Ever since I saw that I've been convinced that being a whale doesn't make you any smarter than the average person with $500. 



e: wow one of yall really got a downvote bot on me huh

What the fuck is your definition of a whale o_o
Legit rich people have investment horizons of years, not months. If they dipped their toes in at 10+k because they believed in the space, then you better believe they are buying more on the way down, lowering their average entry. 
DCB was a poor descriptor. Relief rally would have been a better description. I saw the oversold RSI on multiple time frames and though we would see a V-shaped bounce that would take us into the low-mid 7000s. Could still happen, though it's looking less likely. However, I'm sticking to my plan.
Buy it, sell it, short it, lose it,

long it, lose it, then rebuy it
Volume low, barts left and right, people's bags getting heavy

Not to mention...

Mom's Spaghetti 
I want this to be a thing. Someone make this a thing.

If you get lucky and it tests 6k get out.
A 30% loss? Why didn’t you stop at 1 or 2%?
Futures settle on Friday, i.e tomorrow. Just sayin'.
there are a lot in this sub selling who don't say it because people ridicule them for selling the bottom n shit. 

There's tons of people selling just people don't say it- it's considered shameful 

buying is a badge of honor- it's moral, good, and righteous 
It's the beginning of it but not the actual breakdown. $13k did something similar several times. The market can hover at support several times before breaking down. Hell we could go up to $6.1-6.2k again and still break down. 

it resets really quick that's the thing. from 7.4 to 24 from like $30 lol 
Wow man that was really witty good job dude

"Relevant username!!1!"
Slow drop, slow rise. We won't see the bottom until it's all over.
What math should I learn and how should I learn it? I only did calc in college (not multivar) and I've already discarded most of that knowledge along with the rest of college. Is there a book or course you'd recommend?
Hahah I feel you, here I cleaned it up [https://www.tradingview.com/x/MsxW2U2f/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/MsxW2U2f/)  


Not a believer in fractals but it's funny how eerily similar it is. 
Dancingpizzas’s chart made me not want to short/ put some crazy high short orders.

Still have all mine stacked from the $6200-6400 range.  I just don’t see a 500$ movement with the current amount of shorts open 
Curious why you're not on Sept at this point?
You posted a triangle :P

2-point wedge support and bottom is about 5.6 now. Don't believe in this wedge yet.
Unofficial reconstruction: https://www.tradingview.com/x/fQTwAsSs/
yep.  Will probably be closing out soonish.
True MMs provide liquidity on both sides of the book; these are shameless opportunists by comparison.
4.2K is still the moon for most of the older and bigger wallets, not that we're going anywhere near there.
Hulk kill bear.
Well did they move 45k btc from an exchange wallet or to an exchange wallet? It's usually pretty easy to tell.
[deleted]
we're forgetting about the legendary sideways dildo, forged in the fires of 2018 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/kxmi5nMC/

It's weak to say the least. A bounce with consolidation around 6060 would fit it. 
That explains why it was falling faster than BTC, so now it should be in sync with BTC. With all that selling i don't see any reasons for buyers to start forcing here when BTC is falling. 

Support should be around 420 not here.
Personally I would DCA with actual BTC and not futures. This thing could go to 3k. Futures can get liquidated, BTC in cold storage is yours.
Also I'm starting to layer buys on alts here that I think will eventually recover. The trough is where the money is made. 
You're not wrong, which is why my trading stack is only ~7% of my crypto investment.  The safe thing to do is to balance the FOMO until you sleep comfortably at night without looking at the charts. :D
The other possibility is slow death via numerous big DCBs

- $150k. (On my HODL) But the TA is to $5.7k to match Nov 11 and if that fails, we’re heading to 3.6k in this descending channel.
Yeah this is very true. Lots of new names here today 
Damn I'm in between then, where do I belong...

Where^do^any^of^us^belong
Bitcoin has had 4 "bubbles" now.  So obviously it makes sense to compare it to collapsing bubbles, right?

Definitely don't call it "cycles of growing pains".  Definitely not
Railway stocks...nigguh...lol. 😂😂😂

May the power of Satoshi compell you, I hope you see the light. See ya at 250k.
lol, yes please.  But the opposite of ELI5; let's hear some details!
Upvoted for being a prat 
Fuck me and my GoPro stock.
holy shit, almost mirrors the bitcoin chart
Agreed. Put some money in a stock Monday. Woke up Wednesday morning with 30% less than I started with. Some bad news REKT me. 
$17 to $0.96 absolutely rekt. Thats why the bagholders dont even have the will to give pep talks anymore.
yeah a relief rally is possible. its been so many weeks without one. but the dumps lately seem to just be waiting for the RSI to cooldown and dump again. not really a good trader tbh. i just dca my buying and selling. 
!Remindme 1 year
5777\*
thats a dead cat bounce, but not a reset bounce.

a reset bounce is a fibbonaci retracement of at least 38% that happens over a month long or longer period. Its the type of retracement that gets people bullish, expecting a new ATH.


See my other comment above; they could have 10K BTC and it still wouldn't make sense.

Another example: there used to be "64 Guy" on GDAX, a bot that automatically slapped 64 BTC on the ask during downtrends. Bullied the heck out of the market. He was around for a while...but has been gone for half a year now. It's possible he got insanely rich and is sipping drinks on his private island...or...people wised up to the bot and used it to get very nice entries at local bottoms by completely cleaning it out every time it chased price too far down (myself included).

Basically, there's a reason the true market makers use 0.01 or 0.001 orders or similar...it's not because they're poor and can't afford more; it's because they are sizing the bids/asks to what is likely to get filled by the market (both ways). 50 BTC is just nuts.
He may have a special liquidity provider deal with coinbase. It may actually be part of his terms that he offer so much liquidity within a given spread and those flashing walls are part of that. You can get 50 BTC on bitmex without slippage.
There’s always a bigger fish....
He’s saying bag holders are the ones still trying to accumulate. A whale has no interest in accumulation, only exiting at this point, apparently. 
Yes, it suggests a substantial short squeeze is unlikely. It's worrying to see shorts closing against longs and for the price not to go up at the same time, which is what's been happening over the past few days. 

You do NOT have to pay fees on a long on a spot exchange if you are not using leverage. You do not have a liquidation price either (other than 0). 
That depends entirely on what margin source you're using. There are a number of sources of relatively credit, if you can stomach the risk of trading with money that you have to pay back (to an exchange or otherwise).
I picked them up (in person) on a single day (and bought some here and there via Circle).
lol wow no kidding. What happened?
They do it to pretty much every major public figure in the crypto space as well. You’d really think Twitter would have done something about this by now. 
Shorting low liquidity markets is a recipe for disaster. I'd like to think Binance would be a more respectable choice architect than that. Margin on any non-top 20 coin would be nuts, perhaps even non-top 10.
\> They are just launching another ETH giveaway.. these guys...

No, that's the scam reply to the real parent post.
Why wouldn't discounts flip on stale prices? Month-long dump -> futures trade lower. Price stabilizes, possibly indicating dump is at an end -> premium.
Yeah, a $10 premium seems a bit odd considering it’s closing soon and BTC looks bearish still. I don’t know who’s looking to buy a futures contract that’s about to settle, so maybe its just shorts looking to close early before any shenanigans start?

Still doesn’t explain Sept futs though.
I would wager  that the majority  of bitmex traders don't no shit let alone what the market will do.
Define "short term." Yeah, we're probably not going to see a 5-minute, 15-minute or even 60-minute candle that big, but a daily or weekly? Easy.
very true!
[deleted]
400k btc didn't get stolen and an exchange that does 90% of trade volume didn't declare bankruptcy so this doesn't compare
In the snow... barefoot. But yeah, this market is is pretty good. Great chance for newbs to get in the game. I was actually dreading going higher than $20K because it would have meant only big money could afford to play.
What defines Goblin Town is the lyrics from The Hobbit. 'Down, down to Goblin Town'. Down and more down is the important part. 
> Edit: for what it's worth, we're below July-September volume wise.

In BTC, but not in fiat. 

edit: well, depends on the currency. Your point is taken, though
It's a term used to describe a price range that elicits despair. Generally lower than most people think it would actually go. The majority of folks expecting us to drop more are calling for $4800ish as an expected bottom. Goblin town would be more like $2K-$3K. 

It's subjective.
That's distribution, not accumulation
yikes, totally misread.  ty.
I have CA 6140 and still think I have shitty entry...
Not really sure.

I’m short from the $6200’s so not sure if I want to fuck up my CA and add here. 

I would be a bit hesitant to short the breakdown of 6k because it could just be a fakeout, similar to what happened yesterday. A large time frame candle close under 6k would be way more bearish. 
Yeah, looks like it is about to drop again now. 

I was not watching today, but looks like a good day to be a bear.
No he's me
LOL. Nice one 
Trust me, I’ve tried man and that shit is confusing to me lol. 

I remember our local top at 10k and people calling for accumulation, giving an analysis, and posting charts saying why it is. 

It just seems like a coin toss to me. You’re wrong until you’re right type of thing. 
tea leaves ^2

The point is you chart it as it occurs, then enter at points during the phases that are buying zones 

Wyckoff is rather different to head and shoulders and basics like that
Lol yeah my thoughts exactly. It seems a bit early to call either distribution or accumulation. 

If I remember correctly, Wycoff cycles are generally longer trends with lots of small peaks/valleys and technicalities. (Not even gonna pretend like I fully understand it lol)
Come on, was long at 7.5 and 6.1, it didn't work out.
I don't like it, but I agree with it. Another five months of this? SMH. I might just have to revert to four positions a month.
> I'm not sure why anyone continues to engage him when he has been caught socking multiple times

LOL! What are you talking about? When? Where?

You're upset because I said mean things about BCash. Don't start making up shit about me using sock puppets. That's complete horseshit.

Sorry your shitcoin is crashing. Go cry about it in your censored sub, r/btc.

Kinda weird, but okay. Makes me think you have some sort of narrative to push rather than an honest insight.

Especially with this comment:

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/86qr6h/z/dw8djnj
Agreed with those numbers completely.  Matches other historical bear markets
I also agree, based on 3k being the number from which the craziness started last September. Before that, the price increase felt more organic. Once the BCH fork and Segwit 2x resolved, that’s when the madness started.
😉
I think your chart is upside down
http://prntscr.com/k0ienz

Are we even in the same market?
Looks straight horizontal to me...
Yeah Bill Gates also said it after the crash. We all knew it was a bubble, the hard part was selling near the top and buying near the bottom afterwards.
Dude everyone knew it was a bubble.  The question, as ever, was "where's the top?".

I'm not sure I know of a single person who actually called it correctly, either.
But it felt so good 😊 
The 2 years story tell us about the next 15 years
/r/woosh
Yeah...no. H&S is a reversal pattern. You can't have a H&S confirm as continuation. 
It only looks similar due to how close the structure is to the zero line. It's only really a bearish thing because the break of the wedge would continue it down below zero.
It looks hours of sideways more to me
Volume discounts based on a rolling time period aren't anything new, for Kraken or for contracts in general. You find them in every industry, from shipping to SaaS.
I don't think it's that bad. If you trade professionally the volume stacks up and you get good fees. For example even with not so much capital you can easily surpass 5 million in 30 days and the fees are good.
Who knows. It was when BTC was around $12k, so it wasn’t a particularly big move, and it was the only trade I attempted since I was just testing out the platform. My guess was the Kraken fees swallowed up all my profits.
Àlts are @ Bargain Basement prices right now, me thinks the folks are shopping...
I don't use the term with judgement. It's just the state of the market that there are lots of people holding at a loss rightnow. Guys like diydude riding around in lambos with the profit they took dumping on you though, now they come here and tell you this is the bottom for the fourth time... To me, THAT's the insult.
r/bitcoinmarkets...where 10% up and down in price is "sideways".  

And no, 5.3 to 6.3 is not "5%".

Got to love this place.
[deleted]
Common sentiment is that those addresses belong to exchanges and such, so they represent many many people.  I imagine true whales with mega BTC would be paranoid enough to spread that stuff around.  Who knows, though.
I mean, to clarify, you'll need enough buyers to buy past your sell level, that doesn't always necessarily happen. You can get partial fills. But if you set your sell at 6100 and the price goes up to 6100.01, your entire order will have been filled.
i prefer to sell at that bottom
That's not the point of my comment.
https://www.emojione.com/apps/emoji-keyboard-extension

😉
I'm on my phone a lot
So if this is tradertalk for short term moves, what coins are you selling here sub 6k? The ones you bought earlier at 6300? Okay, have fun with that.
> that short squeeze was an anomaly

It was probably 100% manipulated.  But it just delayed the inevitable and allowed RSI to recharge for further drops.
Lol 10/10 for effort though 
The fucking image says "of course it is not real."
I never closed it. I actually just added at ~5900
Hahahaha this. Hilarious 
It's because people buy BTC to buy Alts (I don't like it either but a lot of that behavior seems to stem from that)
This is a trader/r that's the point. You came to tell everyone you sold like 6 months ago.
Are you one of those people who says 'lol' *out loud*?
So why look at 1 exchange when there's an aggregator? Clearly you're getting the wrong numbers.
Those numbers are shocking to me, if true.  Both of them seem suspiciously high.
Tip: if you mention the word downvotes, you get downvoted... just take this comment for example 
The same could have been said about encrypting mobile phones. I don't think we will see ever a US ban of anonymous cryptos. Privacy is a right.

The manipuwhales are Apu. After we all get rekt: "Thank you, come again"
A lot moved over to Mary Jane sector, me thinks 
just look at any of the shit coins that developers abandoned that still have spikes up every now and then 
I think OBV is too easy to manipulate on higher time frames. Unless the whales are wash trading and manipulating every 1 minute candle, I think it's a good indicator!

The recent price movements are fishy too. Just expecting some nice DCB is all.. :) Thanks Sloppy!! <3
😤😤😤
He's not taking profits. He's digging himself a deeper grave. 

Do people really think 5800 = Bitcoin ded? Lmfao
Bang on, whales sold at 6.4k before the BGD too. And another whale bought there. You can’t just “follow” whales lol, this is a market
I'm just trying to say that they can be whales, and still be noobs.
The "bag holder" thing is getting ridiculous. You guys need to come up with some new material. Also, be careful with the insults and accusations you make because they may just apply to you more than the accused. What kind of a bag would a short needing to cover a large number of coins be holding? One that makes hodlers richer.
Would be god damn nice to hear :D
I got caught in the gambling mania and added to my long instead of cutting losses. If liquidated It will serve me as a lesson. 
Given the uncertainty it would have been smarter not doing anything at all...
And?
Yeah, not going down with the ship is betrayal...
I am proud to admit that I sold. Half my stack at 6100 and the other half at 6000. Best trade I have made in weeks. It's nice to win one.
[deleted]
That is alarmingly similar. That was a 7%ish pop upwards before settling about 5% up and then dumping. At these levels, we'd see a wick to 6550ish and then settling around 6425.

There's a part of me that wants to set break-even stops, but that's only about $40 up from here. Too tight for the liquidity on September. 
Nice. I would suggest another way of seeing it is [this way](https://imgur.com/a/OOWLDbj). I.e. the 6/18 upbart as an aberration within the previous wedge.
Yeah honestly if this pops up it might be a lot tamer without those shorts to stop hunt. Giving a better short entry.  But then again this is bitcoin. 
Oh, sorry. That was a typo. I am hedged on sept futs. 
Oh, that. Fair enough haha
Now this was the chart I've been looking for!
Got a target in mind?
so does he just disappear when his 60 btc runs out? He looks like the only bot on GDAX. and I always thought Gdax hired a desk to provide liquidity but idk
Prob not, there is gonna be a lot of bull blood spilling in bitmexico 
no one would drop 45k BTC in a bear market. That would be a dumb way to liquidate their BTC, taking a huge loss.
the BRGSD
lots of big buys, price doesn't go up. Looks like someone is walking this down man

Want to add w stops above $6100 like a true degen


I don’t have disposable income, that’s why I trade. 
This sounds like a bad omen.
Its not going to stay in this descending channel until 3.6k..that's ridiculous.
So ELI10?
With all the people who got a GoPro but don't actually have a use for it, it's just like a shitcoin!
Making money in crypto is harder then stocks right now so why waste your time.When and if the trend changes then jump back into crypto.
What's the unbiased story there? Scam? I lurked the sub and looks like the salt team is mia? 
the dumps have been getting weaker and weaker and we are getting into support territory where there are hidden buy walls accumulating 
Um, any bounce that isn't a reversal is a DCB/technical bounce/reset/cooloff/whatever you want to call it. And we've had a half dozen of them since $10K.
But why do you think that's due to happen *now*? 
I agree to an extent- if the volume and volatility are high enough then it'd be worth it.

guy who gets 0.1 btc buy/sell filled at $6080 and $6120 is making way less than the guy with 1 BTC getting filled on both sides

idk how it's calculated but I imagine it's a function of volume or something

/u/the_ops_mommy I'm sure you'd know, how is this determined? is it potentially ruinous to run a bot like the one on GDAX
Why the everloving fuck would you open a 1x spot long position and hold for 6 months +, when you can instead just buy the same amount of BTC, not on margin, and transfer it to your own wallet to hold indefinitely?
I don't get the difference between:
1. Having a long position with no leverage
2. Buying Bitcoin

Am I stupid? I must be stupid.
See my post above 
Yes I tried to use sarcasm over the ol' interwebs. My fault. Thought it was obvious :(
Potentially. I just wouldn't expect the discount to flip premium until the market demonstrates bullish behavior, not just "hey we're not in free fall at the moment" behavior 
I assume he meant the traditional 1Hish BGD.

A weekly to 6800 wouldn't surprise me at all. 
Doug Polk. 
I recently posted on an ICX daily talking about how it’s about to break long term support and it could see lower lows. 

I had a guy comment @ me telling me to fuck myself, he’s gonna fuck my mom + I probably learned about crypto through Charlie Sheen and my TA is useless and to not come around here acting like you know stuff you little prick.

And guess what... it broke down through long term support and has showed new lows. 
Exactly, I was making fun of this guy who probly got in 6 months ago and has been staring at the 2014 chart for the past 3 months.
If only bitcoins were divisible in some way... 
Haha, made me laugh with the very accurate reference. 
Sure, but distribution involves increases in volume around key moments considerably higher than that of which we've had.

If we follow your source material our current situation seems an awful lot more like distribution.
No probs, easily done. I know what it's like to reply only to reread after a refresh...
Why?
It's already closed several 1d candles at the very bottom of the intra-day Feb 1 low. You don't think that looks prepared to break down? A 1d close below 6K on Bitfinex would look even worse, but it already looks bad.
The Black Bear can be found with black, brown, gray, silvery-blue and cream fur coats!
No he's me
Yep, best gotta make the best available educated guess using all of the information available
it doesn't really make much sense using the time frame you gave...there isn't even a third test of the high- the first one was just a bounce from on the way down. don't wyckoffian accumulation ranges have to be...ranges? it's not a range if we've touched the top once...

the better range would be $6-13k, but even then, the range has been *tightening* into a nearly perfect triangle, which it broke down from
yea, I guess if it fit every aspect of the wyckoff shit perfectly then it would make sense to be like "we've done the first 10 things, now the last one is a big move up" but hit doesnt even seem to match most of the accumulation levels.

if anything the consolidation range since $13k with $6k the first time would be the most realistic accumulation pattern 
Capitulation yet! Touch me in my pantalons I am hard now.
this is serious gaslighting. you trying to tell people /r/btc is "censored". you are mental.
No wayyyyy!  Where were you guys 2 weeks ago with this info?!
/u/gypsytoy is also me.
Yeah, that was the day I was banned and needed to get the last word in against arsonbunny. Now he's permabanned and I'm back. 

Guess I was right even all those months ago!

:)
See edit
Cool, sell here then 
Oh you knew.
Actually the 2 years story tells us wants going on with the 30 min chart
r/woosh 
I’m just speaking about the way it looks, nothing to do with TA or it playing out. Just pointing out the chart looks like one 
yeah I'm a little retarded for not picking up that sarcasm. hours sideways would also be on the cards.
Kraken is a much better exchange now, they have totally overhauled the platform, but yes, it used to be awful a few months ago. 
Alts are at good buy prices, but if BTC dips to low $5K, then alts might really suffer. Possible -25% dip at least from current point, which is huge. This is based on current ALT performance with just sideway movements.  
Cool. You are going to be rich then I guess, good for you, if you have time post screenshots of your shorts, are you using 100x leverage?
Ok so it won’t go past but won’t necessarily completely fill, got it. I had heard reports of fast price movements and limit sellers getting blown past? Not sure where I got that from, specifically with GDAX.

I guess why use the market fee method then? 
Thanks 😃😍👻👾🤙👌🧟‍♂️🐢
I'm short on futures. I won't be selling any physical coins until 100k
Guess I was somewhat right about moving sideways here. 

Added small short at @5889. Thinking about closing all positions and re shorting around $5950-6100
No I think it’s because a new ATH for btc makes brings crypto a lot of attention, and people take profits fro btc going up and flood the alt market with them which brings even more new money into the market
\>You came to tell everyone you sold like 6 months ago.

Read my post instead of basking in jealousy retard. I've been DCAing my selling since 14k. Which means i also sold at $7,700, $6,700, and $6,200 and have 30&#37; of my stack remaining. In fact if you check my post history i havent been in reddit since July 2017 excluding this month.

What is this sub exclusively for margin traders now? You can view it as shorting without margin if it makes you feel better.
Not really, does that answer your question? "lol"?
Your numbers include the bitmex order books which I am not counting as physical BTC buys- I'm just looking at the biggest exchange.
Yeah I was skeptical too. But that's what the poll said o_O

This is just insane knife catching. Like this is the lowest it will ever get.
That's awesome, better than rookie of the year, not close
Haha I wish, but I will go on and say for the record that the south park creators did a good job in picking the type of geologist randy was.

A fluvial geomorphalogoist studies how river/stream systems shape the landscape and how it affects rock formations/distributions and he lives near the Colorado River (plus mountain streams from snowmelt)
No, nor do I wish to be Tone Vays.

Chill. You sound like someone on https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoinobituaries/
Again these are moments to start layering buys in... I know I am an internet stranger but man and up do the right thing.
These are exactly the people that will buy the top at those figures. You are apparently included in that. I am saving your comment and going to PM you at 20k and 100k just to rub it in. 
lmao that's fucking great, both markets are open 24/7/365 too ;)
Chinese meme stocks, if r/wallstreetbets is any indication.

But yeah, I noticed the same thing too.  I don't look at any of the ideas or whatever on the front page, but in the past day or so I've noticed non-crypto at the top for the first time in forever.
Yeah, bitconnect and enron disagree.

It's not just 1 guy, it's a Lotta guys. And gals maybe

if he's selling on spot there's no grave, he's just getting dat sweet cash. 

never even implied it was dead
not a bad place to sell if you're expecting to buy in at 3k
I've been in the same position you are in right now multiple times. I urge you to close at a loss and avoid getting liquidated. You will regret not doing so later. If you value your coins and you know you're in a losing trade, close. Get over that psychological barrier, I know its extremely hard but please try.
Adding when close to liquidation is about the worst thing you can do. My September contracts nearly got liquidated on the 6/13 dip to 6100 (within $10). When we bounced to 6500 I started shorting Perps and continued until I was slightly net short. Then I layered cover orders all the way down to just above my liquidation point. I'm trading off the TD Sequential support and resistance lines on the 4h chart and when it hits resistance and gets toppy I go net short and when it looks like we might bounce I go even or net long, always leaving some short as protection. Using this method I've gotten my Sept liquidation down to 4852. I'll be nervous and continue this pattern till I get that down to around 4k or we really turn around in a big way. The trend is down and 4-5k is on the table. I believe we're much higher end of the year but I can't deny the current trend. If you really want to get the liquidation down quicker take off what you just added on the next bounce (if you make it). Once you have some breathing room trading around both positions brings the liquidation down even faster. I'm often scalping layered $50-100 moves back and forth. 
Nuttin' <_<
Yup -_-'
Cool, thanks. I ordered it. Looking forward to checking it out!
We had 6.8 resistance there. Look on the chart, after the drop we wicked up to 6.8, then dropped, formed a triangle, did one more push to 6.8 to confirm resistance and got rejected.

Now we didn't have any resistance after the drop. I'm surprised that we are in 5.8-6.2 range. There is nothing above us up to 6.8 resistance and down we have only ATH support at 5.4 now.

We're getting rejected from 6250, had a push above 6.3 but dropped instantly..
I’m debating whether to set stops around 6200 since I’m short from 6100. Wait it out and re short from the possible top of the range at 6400. But there’s a huge difference and that is the number of shorts back there was way higher compared to now, on mobile so can’t say exactly. So a pop up won’t have as much fuel here if it decides to go that way. 

I’m honestly baffled right now by the short to long ratio. 
Yeah, that was a short squeeze that propelled it up. Without those shorts we might just drop hard again.
I removed some short orders in mid 6200’s and low 6300’s. Pretty confused on where to put them.

If we get a BGD not sure how much fuel it will have. I’m going to stack some crazy high ones between 6500-6600 because Kraken is known for that.
I don't like the way those dips are bought up...
Depending on a few factors, should be around 4.5k-5k.  Then planning on scaling into buys between 4.5k-goblin town.
Wowthatscoolman
how would they take a loss if they bought it way cheaper
What does a good omen sound like?
There’s still way too much enthusiasm and hopium flowing for this to reverse yet. Once the coming attack war / stress test begins on BCH rumor has it there will be large retaliation dumps.
lol if someone hasn't been able to rake in $ over the last 6 months trading bitcoin they're just retarded.
Well apparently people were buying in expectation of the $25 arbitrage. They believe the market price of SALT will go near to the $25 price of SALT tokens in the official platform. Palm Beach Report which was extremely hot at that time said buy up to $20 i think with no stop loss and it reached $17.

Palm Beach report is like Weiss Rating on steroids i remember 30&#37; gains in an hour just because they said buy something. They got their reputation for calling on Antshares aka NEO early which is total bullshit since everybody on 4chan was shilling it at a low price of $2 to $7 regardless of whether palm beach shilled it.

Presale price of SALT was $0.25 according to the sub; the presale was exclusive to whales. What could go wrong lol? So yeah even at the current price of $0.96 i doubt whales who got it for $0.25 will have any remorse dumping.
I'm not liking the ratios on alts though. I checked my blockfolio and alts are way up compared to their previous slump in march i think? For example ETH hit 0.05 in the ratio back then. EOS way lower.

alts->btc->tether

People continuing to cash out on alts will drag BTC as well... i think lol
it has to be a bounce on longer time frames
I never said this would happen now. 

I said that this point is a good entry for that bounce. It can still go down to $4950 but I find that unlikely 
Absolutely agree. But to build on that, guy who gets 50 BTC ask filled by a whale's buy, and then has to scrap to get 0.00353294 fills (possibly even at higher prices) all day to make the 50 BTC back is making...-$10K?
Simply buying bitcoin **IS** going long, regardless if you keep it on an exchange or a wallet a not so trivial amount of people didn't even bother with a wallet and left it at Coinbase, bitstamp or whatever.
There's no difference which is exactly my point.
Was my fail, I should have given any poster here more credit than that.
If only the noobs thought this way though. They don't. They'd rather throw their $100 into LGBTQ coin that's .06 cents and hope it doubles, than buy an "expensive" bitcoin. It's the same in the stock market as well. Dumb money feels more important if they have 1,000 shares of cheap stock instead of having 5 shares of more expensive, higher quality stock.
Because we should be already below 6k. Look at this dip buying, every time we break below 6.1 we get dragged above. I don't like the action here.
good bot...

But can they climb trees?
I am spartacus
No he's me
Just ignore him. You'd have more success convincing the late Elwood P. Dowd he isn't friends with a 6 ft tall rabbit that you will trying to have an intelligent conversation with that one. He is very lost and very toxic.

He also seems to have no job except posting to Reddit and will just keep wasting your time while trying to get in the last word. Downvoting and moving on is the best solution, sadly.

Edit: If you're interested in an example of how talking to /u/gypsytoy is an exercise in futility, check this out: https://i.imgur.com/if6eZbN.png

I gave him lots of time and attention, but it was completely fruitless. This was before I was aware of his mental problems. The whole thing is really sad, but I guess there are all kinds of people in this world. I hope he finds some kind of peace eventually.
/r/btc is censored. I and many other BCash dissenters have been banned. Not to mention the downvote brigades, karma bots and open hostility to anything that doesn't align with the narrative that BCash is the greatest thing ever.

Not surprised that a /r/btc subscriber is denying this though.

Have fun with your bags when it goes back below 0.1

LOL!
Cool
If it’s breaks, I’ll sell on the next leg down if we don’t get a bounce, cool?
[Yep.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6td3pf/daily_discussion_sunday_august_13_2017/dljvyje) Everyone who was not an idiot knew.
Yep, when BTC is in a upward trend and going sideways is when Alts take off, yer right...
are you talking about Stop Limit orders, or just a regular old Limit orders? afaik, GDAX fills all Stop orders via market orders, down to the limit price you've specified. in general if you're not using a market order, there's **always** a risk of your order not filling at all. 
Stopped reading after you called me your pet name. 
Mods. deleted is he deleted it himself 
I'm holding my hedge short from 6115 on September and I have June orders from 6075-5900. I'll cut them after that. lol
And they're going positive later! You guys are really holding the wall on my karma, I don't deserve you guys 😭 I feel bad I pissed someone off that much

BitMEX shall now be known as Kwik-E-Mart.
The weedstocks sub is really ethtrader, ok not that bad, but its very too the moon like. Not as quality as this sub, but a different audience, maybe age? So older versions of too the moon? 

However, I must admit I rode that train the last week or so, forgot how much more pleasant it is in a sub with a bull market....
outright scams don't count
You're on the downvote train today brah. :/
We have the new 10k resistance line above us

https://www.tradingview.com/x/1LaqZGZn/
For the record, it's 32772:22885 right now (long:short). That's pretty wide. 
Volume is so low right now. That movement from 6130-6064-6110 all within a 15m candle was about 700 BTC on BFX. That's more volume than we had in the last like 2 hours lol.
sure is
it could be a short position initiated at 6000, but another whale bought BTC to make the price go up to 6100.
"You will be rich and never be able to spend all your money, because it will keep getting resupplied. Muhahahaha" sounds like a pretty good omen to me.
why should the market care about Rogers Coin? 
I don't think this is going to reverse now.


But I also don't think there's been too much enthusiasm. Its been really bad. A LOT of people are pessmistic, including me. I can't even imagine a bullish scenario in my mind anymore. A lot of people around me and including me are starting to think this is really over. The sentiment in /r/cryptocurrency has been extremely bad as well.

and yes there's always exceptions, but like mentioned here many times, even at the worst days of 2014, 2/3 people were still bullish and hopeful. Even at 160 dollars, 2/3rd of everyone were hopeful. Go and read those dailies. I think honestly, right now, the sentiment might be lower than what it was at the bottom of the 2014 crash which tells me we still have some ways to go before everyone who's bearish has either sold or bought back in and the only people left are the true hodlers/bulls. 

So while I agree with you that we have some ways down, I think you're mistaken in terms of the sentiment.

Also we've been dumping for basically 8 weeks straight, which is pretty bad for even bitcoin, even when taking into account the worst periods of 2014...these past 2 months are up there.
Care to explain more?
Qualifier was "right now", and i agree its pretty hard and i haven't been trading it that much. 
Thanks! So mainstreet got completely heckled. Ouch 
What, the weekly? We've had 4 or 5 bounces clearly visible on the daily since $10K. A "bounce" by definition is supposed to stall and drop, otherwise it's a reversal. 
RemindMe! 2 weeks "did it go down to 5K?"
I know, so why would someone open an actual 1x position on Finex instead of just buying BTC and then sending it to their wallet of choice, or hell, just keeping the coins on finex? Why would they actively be tied up in a long position that is 1x when they can buy coin (same as going 1x long) and then do whatever?
Longs are still slowly increasing..I wonder when they will stop dip buying.
But volume is lackluster and eventually buyers will dry up entirely. The past 8 weeks have been mostly down and sideways. It's not surprising that it's taking a little break in this region. 

Volume declining over the past week. Dip buyers should be following through on high volume. Instead, it just looks like the whole market is taking a breather before another leg down. RSI is mostly reset and the log downtrend line from 20K is now around 5K, so it's very possible to leg down and still stay above that line, which is what happened in 2014. 

Where would you plan to open if you weren't already in a position?

Thanks! You can ask me for more facts any time. Beep boop.
Are you not entertained?
Raises hand
Yes I am so "lost"... lost without my access to /r/btc. 

Are you denying that I was banned? That others were banned?

Come on, bro, don't fool yourself. Your precious sub is just as bad as /r/bitcoin if not much worse.

I'm sorry that nobody (still... after all this time...) wants to buy or use your 0-conf garbage. Roger and Craig have failed your cult and no new members can be found. 

What are you going to do? Dump your bags and trade up for real Bitcoin or sink with the rest of the clueless idiots who can't figure out that BCash isn't Bitcoin.

:/
LOL! You posted the conversation that makes *you* look terrible. Good job, dude. Even people in your own sub were cringing at your behavior.

By the way, the answer to the ASICs red herring is that chain length is itself a measure of decentralization against an energy constant. Artificially (and temporarily) stifling ASICs production only weakens the chain. Specialized and highly efficient hardware is good, so long as the supply and distribution isn't centralized like it currently is with Jihan controlling most of the market. This is changing though.

I wouldn't expect you to understand any of that, but I thought I'd graciously provide you with that tidbit, given that you've willingly embarrassed yourself by re-hashing that screenshot.

:)
Share the message that got you banned. They surely delete shitposters and trolls but there is no censorship of dissent. 
Do whatever you want lol
BTC was not even 3k.

So you have not bought any coins since last july?
Well there, that is what I want to avoid. Just a sell limit order to avoid the fees. But paying $60 for each buy and sell makes me feel like I am over trading and crippled with fee fear. 
Its alright, being this salty and hostile wont really change your ~~losses~~ current situation
I'm like... I don't even know, wanted to scalp a bit, didn't close, I think it's 3x net short at the moment split between spot and Sept...
Upvote walls are actually bearish. Provides nice downvote liquidity
Well, this sub is known as bi polar....

This goes down much more you'll be drowning in btc and downvotes. 
Well props for the strong 4 year hodl lol. We will see
What the heck! Someone has a downvote bot on me. That or I'm annoying people. :x

But I'm getting 2 to 3 in about 30 seconds on every single comment so I think it's a downvote bot lol 
Ok, somehow don't have it on my chart. Thanks.
right, but how many of those longs are with no leverage?
I know. It's the action itself. Every time we try to get lower it's being bought back up. It's like all the scalpers are now happy about 1% scalp :-\
They shouldn’t care. But the BCH people do still collectively hold a lot of BTC which they are threatening to dump. Bringing much greater downside before any climb.
The sentiment in r/cc has always been bad if you ask me. I always avoid that sub like the plague. Its hardly anything to go by.
fair points. I see what your saying, my take would be to remember in 2014, it was still a fringe community, people were optimistic about the tech moreso than the price. What we see now is a bunch of people who got into bitcoin for the price, who dont really understand the tech. I'd say 100&#37; of people who got in since the start of the last bull run are pessimistic about the price.
daily

compare those bounces to the bounce on 02/06 and 04/12


Can you not earn fees when you take a leveraged position, even if it’s just 1x? Read on here that during the bull run up, somebody opened a big 1x short merely to earn the fees from longers as the price sky rocketed. Being 1x meant their coin was not impacted, but they earned a decent chunk in fees.
Yup... And shorts aren't adding.
I don't usually like to speculate on large scale manipulation, but I wonder if this action is whales setting up for a long squeeze.
I know all of that. But I know that BTC likes to go 'hold my beer'. Your entry was risky, it was before confirmation.
After a move from 10k to 6k, it is the buyers that are drying and not the sellers?
> But volume is lackluster and eventually buyers will dry up entirely.

The only thing that can dry up entirely in a deflationary crypto asset is the sellers.

There is literally a new ~~sucker~~ buyer born every second on this planet... and there will only ever be so many Bitcoin in existence.
Haven't bought any coins with fresh fiat since March 2017. Multiplied my stack by trading though (mostly shitcoins).
If you're at your computer and can babysit it, definitely just buy/sell via Limit orders - that's what almost everyone worth their salt does and they will likely fill after a few minutes. Using market orders are a surefire way of getting what you want, but as you know they come at a cost. Market orders are most advisably used by panicking traders (ie, market is tanking) and by Stop Limit orders. Setting a Stop Limit order (with a sufficiently wide berth to avoid getting stopped out by big wicks) can be advisable so that you can automatically get out if the market tanks $1000 while you're AFK
Homie,  you're the one being hostile. I was being passive aggressive. Good luck with selling the last of your "stack".
I just went up to a 1.5x short at 6070. Now 6105 average. Where'd your entries?
Yep it's gotta be a bot, we're several layers deep and you went to -2 in less than 30 seconds.  Image: https://imgur.com/pSRdwxM

I'd suggest PMing the admins about it

Also -5 at the 2 minute mark: https://imgur.com/pMFIjUq
Probably many. Even at 3.3x, they're not looking at margin calls for a long time. 
They probably are. Start pushing that leverage slider further and getting complacent until someone decides to add an extra 0 to their market order. 
Weird shit happening with the price action for sure. I just saw:

BFX = 6102  
Swaps = 6092  
June = 6104  
Sept = 6088  

June is trading at a tiny premium now and September's discount just got cut in half. 
Yawn, what a silly little theory.
Yeah they will totally just throw away their money to hurt bitcoin and by doing that, crash their own coin because it is tied to BTC. Because fuck money, they are only in it for the tech. Yeah, no.
That will be their loss in the longer term, so to say. I couldn't care less about what they are threatening to do. Let them dump their $20 worth of BTC and move on with their BCH.

Funny thing is that their BCH will also drop in value when BTC goes lower.
it's a shitshow.
Those were reversals. 
On Bitmex. On finex you pay fees whether you long or short. And that dude got fucked unless he managed to close at break even during a dump because even if you are 1x short you lose margin on your position when the price goes against you, and there's no way he made more on fees than what he lost on the position.
Yeah that's bearish. Price should be going up as this happens, not stagnating/going down.
True, but sometimes when you're thirsty, you drink the dirty water. There won't necessarily be a better entry point and 5K is within sight. I'm not impressed by the dip buying. It just looks like intermission.


By the looks of it, yes. Sellers cool off during things like bear flags. They let up and buyers take back a bit of control, but once they're well rested, they drive the price down again on high volume. 

I agree that 10K to 6K is steep but that doesn't mean that 6K is the bottom.
That doesn't mean that the price steadily goes up. Bitcoin is still undergoing inflation *and* the markets fluctuate. 

At equilibrium (and societal acceptance) the buyers and sellers are equally liquid and the price wouldn't undergo such exacerbated bear and bull markets. That seems like a long way off though. Much turbulence in the meantime. 
Good luck trying to convince everyone to keep going long like you've been trying the past several months lol no wonder you hate me.
1x swaps at 6125 and 3x Sept at 6120
Yea it's -5 on every one now. lol I'm laughing wtf 

I'll message the Admins
It’s me. When trading gets boring I max out my gpu to downvote sloppy. Jk
June settles tomorrow so lack of discount doesn't surprise me, don't like how Sept behaves.

And I thought 7k is a minefield... This here is just 'wake me up in a month when this will be over'.
He's right that there will be a 2-4 week reversal and the sub will be 50/50 on bullish/bearish again. 

I think it'll happen at $4.5k personally

Basically we'll have a real "correction" upwards where the daily rsi hits overbought and then dumps back down again 
reversals that painted a lower high than the last one 


There was someone off here who made plenty shorting 1x during the run up. May have been a different guy to to one you are referring to. Bitmex makes 1x an option during parabolic runs/crashes if the market piles on in one direction. I only use Bitmex so dunno about other exchanges.
Remember that if shorts aren't piling up that would mean that sellers think this might be the bottom.

I just like more clear moments. When I was opening it was more clear than now.
I'm not saying you're wrong here, I agree, but that doesn't change that going here now with 5x isn't risky. Bear market is about shorting the bounces, not trading breaks.
Do they gain BTC by resting? Is that a thing?
> Bitcoin is still undergoing inflation and the markets fluctuate. 

Agreed, however the exact number of Bitcoin that will ever exist at any certain date and time is already public knowledge... so it must be mostly priced in imho.
Haha, not one true word in this sentence. I must have really touched a hot button with you. You must be really insecure.
Solid entries. I sort of just want to close it all right now in the green. The dip buying is no joke. But we have been bleeding downwards (SO SLOWLY) 
Yes. They continued for an extended period of time, long beyond a relief rally or an indicator reset. I think this is what differentiates them from a bounce. 

I think bounces are a near given when dropping. Reversals like that are not
Which comment and which part? Sorry if I'm dense but I've seen several people mention this 1x long thing on finex now and I haven't gotten an answer as to why this is a thing.
Shorters just have more patience. I doubt there's a lot of confidence that this is the bottom. The ratio is just cooling off. It will start going up again very quickly, once support breaks decisively, but those shorters will have positions at 5800 / 5900, instead of 6080. 
Like I said, I will close at least part of it quickly if it does break cleanly from here. I may try to close a good portion on a bounce off of 6K too. 

Still, I can't imagine that Monday and July roll around and Bitcoin doesn't start Q3 with a bang. Even longer time frame MA's and Ichimoku have turned decidedly bearish. Particularly the kumo flip and TK cross on the weekly and we'll be on the under side of the cloud once the week closes (unless we go up $3000 before then).

Doesn't look good to me at all, regardless of whether or not the entry was good. 
Huh... Everyone was downvoting me and giving me shit. 

Looks like it was a pretty good entry after all, for once in my life. LOL

Yes. They mine extra Bitcoin in their sleep.


Agreed, to some extent. The inflation is also dropping to pretty low levels over the next few years. 

Doesn't really change the fact sellers are outweighing buyers though. That's just the nature of price discovery. At equilibrium, these forces would be in balance, but that's definitely not the case as it currently stands.

There's a difference between being lucky and good entry. I told you, I agreed but still think the r/r was shitty at the moment. Still is. We're like 3rd time breaking 6k and still can't hold below. You went for big risk with big reward. I don't do that.
It's pretty spectacular imho that the recent bull run of 2017 barely put the stability factor 50% of it's highest ever...

Yeah that's true. I opened a 1/4th size long on futures (I actually opened the short or perp, messed up my bot entry), but I happened to catch the very bottom of that wick and I will probably close out the short at break even if volume brings it back up to that range.

Waiting to see how the day closes too. A close below 6K is good night nurse, imo.
Yeah well going from $32 to $2 and from $30 to $250 were a lot more dramatic than 2017's relatively slow-paced rise and fall. 
I had 6170 on Sept but added at 6070 :-\
I had 6284 on Sept opened on Monday. Kicking myself for closing that.

I've closed swaps at 5930 before going to sleep in case this bounces, but looks like could've leave it open ;-)

Still on 2x net on Sept.
I can't decide whether to close futures before bed or let it ride. Got a decent 6% total stack increase at the moment, which is not to be sneezed at. 
I closed that swaps just to get some profits. Just sticking to the plan, it was a scalp so didn't want to ride it for too long.

You can always set very tight stop on that or trailing stop.
