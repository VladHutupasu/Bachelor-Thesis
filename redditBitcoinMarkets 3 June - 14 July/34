Here is a very great reminder for what can happen when strong hands short: https://tradingview.com/x/4j3iZrZZ

Shorts went from 8000 to 26000. a 3x increase over the course of $10950 to $12100. This was a week before we hit $6k the first time.

This means almost every single bitcoin bought in the $10200-12100 range the week before the dump was a buy into a very strong handed short.

While the potential for a short squeeze becomes more real as shorts increase basically parabolically, I'd be wary to expect another short squeeze again. 

In general when the majority of people think they've figured this market out, it does the opposite. 

the possibility to dump or pump is equally likely based on what happens when shorts pile on. 

Overall this fight for $6k is pretty fun to watch, albeit a bit frustrating at times. It's interesting to see the market struggle to figure out where it's going to go
This is becomming ugly at this point.  I'm not pannicking yet, but I think i will if we go sub 6.4k.

Down quite a bit on my hodlings (\~20&#37;) and I'm really contemplating just taking the loss and quit this shit for the time being.

Then again, I don't really need this money so  I might aswell keep playing the long term game. But i'm much less optimistic about 2018's closing price. I'd expect 10k\+ but if this drops keeps going we might not even make it back to 8k by the end of this year.

Wait for 2019 , 2020 is a possibility, but then this crash could provide me a much better buyin oppertunity then what I have now (avg 8k) so taking this loss to get in much cheaper could still provide much better results in the long term then this.

Can't make up my mind about this
I love how news articles always come out explaining with a singular reason why bitcoin goes up or down at any given time.  Bitch, this is bitcoin, it doesn't need a reason.
I’m a delusional permabull but i still believe max pain is in the horizon. I really just want it to over as quickly as possible so we can get back to moon memes and down voting bears
There is a saying about bottoms that after the boy jumps over the creek he takes two steps back and dips his toe in. This may have just happened. Someone once posted [this](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54fed56be4b0b8a1d3d33918/t/558090a1e4b01a827bd89c51/1434488993915/Wyckoff+Schematics-+Visual+Templates+For+Market+Timing+Decisions.pdf) about how to spot tops and bottoms and it's helped me identify them. Passing it on.
Just take a breath and look at the facts. On Bitfinex: 

Feb low: $6000  Feb high: $11,788

March low: $6425   April high: $9990

Jun low (so far): $6618

We're forming higher lows and lower highs in an equilibrium pattern.  As long as we stay above our last low of $6425, the pattern continues.  

I'm a buyer at these levels and will load up the truck if it drops to $6500 with a stop loss at $6400.
Really confused at the market direction right now. I really thought that after breaking 6.8K and 7K support levels and the multi month triangle we would have gone into free fall until about 6 - 6.4k.  But right now were still hovering under 6.8k support turned resistance. Its very weird to me. 
Yesterday caught a lot of folks with their hands in the cookie jar. It didn't help it happened on a weekend. A lot of the signs were there, with the biggest being the absolutely abysmal volume. If the bounce off 7050 had been a legitimate reversal, it should have signaled a retest of the pennant top over 9K. If all the signs were pointing to >9K, buying at 7xxx should have been easy. The fact that it stalled out under 7800 was extremely unnerving, and it was the motivating factor behind hedging my position there. BTC had wrecked me before on unexpected pumps, and I wasn't willing to go heavy short, but I added the breakdown of 7400 as planned. I was evaluating an additional add at the breakdown of 7150, but it all happened too quickly, and we were under 6900 within minutes.

The biggest question is where we go next. I posted yesterday that I'm expecting more downward movement following the daily pennant breakdown. I still hold that view, but I'm a little surprised by the length of sideways we've had. We're in a bear flag (sort of--pretty flat), but volume profile fits. We've chopped here sideways long enough to reset RSI on the small-medium time frames. Still oversold on 2H-1D, but room to drop on the shorter frames and the weekly. That said, I do expect we'll be retesting 6900-7000 at some point. We moved through it without a second glance. Doesn't mean we will--we very well could leg down again and test 6700 as support-turned-resistance. 

All eyes should be on 6400-6500. This is a relatively HVN for this range, historical support, and our last low. Breaking below that would be very, very bearish. I'm holding my shorts (5x 40% from 7505 on June and 2x 50% from 6810 on swaps) until 7K breaks with confidence.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/vrdV7Wu8/

The LONGS:SHORTS ratio has narrowed, but I still don't think we're in substantial danger of a short squeeze. Further, I'm failing to see any particular reason for a reversal. I've been blowing that horn since we got rejected off 11.7K, but I just don't see it yet. I think it will come, but I don't think it's going to be this summer. As always, I try to evaluate what the market is doing through the lens of the current environment, sentiment, and fundamentals. I see no compelling argument for BTC being worth what it's worth that doesn't begin with "It will be worth so much more later." I'm optimistic that the environmental changes necessary to facilitate adoption will occur and that BTC *will* be worth so much more later, but I'm a trader, and I can substantially increase the number of coins I hold for that eventuality without committing additional fiat. Why would I not? Also note the use of optimistic rather than confident--I am not confident of that outcome, and I advise anyone who wholly believes that BTC *will* succeed to take a step back and evaluate the possible outcomes. 

Good luck all. 
all aboard the global casino?

How long can we just dick around at 6750 before we bart?
Taking loss for my long from 7200 and my long from 6700 at 6784
Really would like to hear /u/_chewtoy_ here with his wide insight.

I know, we broke down.

But you said we're due to move up before we fall down. Personally don't think we can manage breaking above 7k, wondering if ATH line can actually hold the drop.

On the other hand 7k bounce was so close to that line that maybe it was close enough to stop the drop right there?

I remember that /u/sloppysynapses noticed that one time after we broke the down trend line market in fact went more down for a long time before it managed to break up.

bought .666 btc at 6666.66

#Hail Satan 
I'm sure it's been done already, but could someone point me to a comparison of the 2013/14 market with this one? I recall the drop from $1200 down to $2xx, then an apparent recovery in the spring/early summer to around $600 before another drop. This feels very similar so far.
Things should get pretty interesting when we get to where the green arrow is

https://www.tradingview.com/x/TK36qO64/
You could say people don't mind buying bitcoin at 6.7k, but at the same time there is not exactly any visible "scramble" for it. We're seemingly beginning to go sideways just like it happened in the 7k range. There is some demand, but at the same time there is no serious demand at 6.7k

Basically waiting for whales' next move
Ouch, this hurts. Thank god for stop loss I guess? This breakdown really destroyed any hope I had left for bullish movement in 2018. Will wait the bounce to short, but I'm really not motivated anymore.

!long XBTUSD close 7399
It's been a while since I quite trading but I was itching to trade or rather gamble. So, went YOLO 100x Long at 6750 entry on MEX with 1% of my crypto-net worth for short term. 

I might regret it though.  

EDIT: REKT
We are at the whims of the MM's (whales) at this point. Either they put a (likely temporary) bottom to this downtrend and squeeze the overleveraged shorts or they create panic by dumping a few thousand coins.
If you are a holder (not trader) who haven't sold yet, would you sell if it goes below 6k? Would you capitulate?
Took a peek at ETH and LTC charts and it doesn't look good. LTC is on a massive 3D descending triangle and is pretty most testing support now.
ETH could also be in a 1D descending triangle and is also very close to support right now...

BTC is holding steady around 6750 but not far from the latest bottom @6400.

If ETH drops below 500 or LTC drops below 100, BTC can be dragged down and it will be messy. Both ETH and LTC have a lot of air below support and can drop pretty hard.

I'm out of position now after shorting ETH from 600 to 535 and then from 530 to 510 (with some bad trades in between). 

Although the risk of a drop here is high in my opinion i'll sit on my hands for a while since this can just go up on low volume and i don't want to be underwater for long (ETH for example is a lose cannon right now, it can bounce 3% each way pretty fast while BTC is bound to 1% changes).
Triple bottom, anyone? I'm seeing three evenly spaced lows, each drop with less volume than the previous.
Is it bullish that even I stopped getting excited by these small bounces?
Only buying on GDAX atm is a 100$ buy bot on loop - could have easily accumulated 100,000$ in past 15-20 minutes..
Is this the triple bottom(Orange Line) being referred to? Wicks bottom 10-25, 2-6, plus yesterday and today. Horizontally lines up with consolidation in Nov, Feb and April . . https://www.tradingview.com/x/rxKGGX3a/
Felt the need to point out - that price floor $BTC broke yesterday has acted as support all the way back to October 2017.  That's ~9 months of support we're just now breaking down through.  I don't see us quickly bouncing back and over-coming this sort of break.  Also, the selloff yesterday broke the volume consolidation we've seen for the past ~2 months.  It's a big deal, based on several factors..

Coinbase with the major news. 

ETC being listed. What trash. FOMO’ed in made 8% 
I haven't done a breakdown of how my Volume RSI post from before the weekend [https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8p79tb/daily\_discussion\_thursday\_june\_07\_2018/e09hw6b](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8p79tb/daily_discussion_thursday_june_07_2018/e09hw6b)

Suffice to say it clearly didn't work out. Maybe VRSI doesn't work on a shorter scale.

I still buy into the idea of the larger timescale VRSI (weekly/monthly) being so incredibly oversold/low (respectively) being an indicator of an imminent reversal. However, ignoring sentiment and what any further breakdown below 6.4k means (lower low potential etc) I think the VRSI might have to go into oversold on the monthly.

Sentiment to me is sounding like 'capitulation' after this last failure of a run. 'Despair' takes us to 5k, maybe below. That'd take us into historically unheard of VRSI levels on the weekly and monthly. 

In Europe it's sunny, and if you're in this for the long haul I'd suggest not checking the price for a while if you're not interested in shorting. I don't think I'm capable of timing the bottom, so that's my intent for now. Catch you all on the flip(hah)side.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/oBAb2jJZ/

From a pure TA perspective, this would be a re-test of the black channel, but of course, we know whales like to fuck us with totally unexpected moves, so I think there might be a short squeeze up.

And I'm saying this when I'm short ATM.

Edit: spider senses tingling. closing this at 6690
up or down
Updated Bubble Aftermath chart: https://imgur.com/VNLcy9n

This will probably be the last update unless something really interesting happens. I was expecting a move back towards $10,000 but it looks like we might do something new from here on out. Maybe this means we can find a bottom sooner and it won't be as low as 2014. I'm looking for $5,500 as a potential candidate.

I was long September futures but opened a 50x short on perpetual at $7,650 in case $7,800 didn't break. Luckily I was at my computer when the symmetrical triangle broke down so I cut the long and added to my short which I have now closed. I ended up making a moderate profit off the trade. Now I'm hodling my cold storage but out of a trading position for now. 
Aren’t there a ton of underwater longs. Praying to close 6900-7200 and a ton of people looking to short that range also? How does 7200 get pierced through theoretically? I’d think a short squeeze is unlikely before 7300 a lot of them have pretty safe entry points. I want to be long on longer timeframe here but struggle to see how we could bart back up in the next few days so I see more risk short term.
Bitcoin Please go up. I need to buy a 4K TV so that I can watch Mcafee eating his dick live. 
I'm a long term hodler. I started in this space in June 2017 and I'm currently up about 18x. I took some profit here and there and diversified here and there. Never day traded. I got VERY lucky and blessed to be in the right things at the right time. I ended up quitting my job (it wasn't a career, trust me) and have been living off Crypto for about 8 months now comfortably. Regardless though, I am in complete despair. I couldn't sleep last night. Even though if the market drops another 50%, I can still live off crypto for another 1-2 years...the amount of money lost this past 6 months is absolutely retarded...though the gains were even more retarded. I'm no moon boy. I got into this market as a long term investment and at the time I had no idea how my life was going to change over the next few months. I contemplated last night pulling out entirely and just forgetting about it and moving on with my life but then I remembered why I invested into this space. I've been burnt so many times shorting, that it's hard to make any move now. I lack the discipline and planning to make trades properly. Just a quick rant I guess. I have nothing else to say. I know a lot of people here are in the red, which makes me feel even worse about being a complete mess right now.  
So when does my flair turn bearish then?
If we assume we triple bottom around $6,500, we would just paint ourselves into a massive descending triangle. 

Since it is a definitive bearish continuation pattern, it should imply we break down and continue our downtrend from ATH.

The channel to 6k, the last hopium, and the descending triangle:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/xKIkaYYX/
Man, I'm sitting here with this short, waiting to take a pretty solid profit, and I just can't bring myself to do it.  Every time it knocks on a bit under 6.7 k I think "this is the one", then it isn't, then I tell myself next time it gets here I'm closing, then I don't.

How many times does BTC have to knock before we let it in?
Starting to look like a descending triangle. Bearing continuation pattern. We'll see if 6800 holds as resistance. A break would invalidate it. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/5kEdXvHS/
I didnt listen to my spider senses and just held my short :(

Anyways, if I were to imagine the maximum possible pain, BTC would go to like 7200 shaking out shorts, move sideways, then drop back down. it is a nightmare for both long and short
We aren't going back up anytime soon, everytime we drop the sell orders just above build up so quick and we don't have the buyers.

Confidence has gone and if some shitty exchange with shit security got their shitcoins hacked and caused the start of this dump then we ain't going back up soon. 

We have have had "good" news coming in for some of the big cryptos but hasn't had any positive affect on the market at all but if some FUD can kick start the dump then it just shows that the whole market is being played like a fiddle.

The rich get richer as always and there are some big players who are going to suck every dollar out of everyone that they can.

I'm holding my long until 6500, hope the kraken whale can appear again and give us a small bump back up over 7k. 
The 2014 in me keeps saying that this can draw on for a long time.... slow bleed to numbers none of us like.... truly breaking our spirits one day at a time....


The 2018 in me says that this is an evolved sector and while it is capable of its typical long dips and sharp rises, I truly believe the economic inertia and size of the crypto sector now has some bearing on what the coming months will entail. The attention and understanding of crypto in the modern world may retain investors. People know that this market is extreme and intense... I can't imagine large institutional investors will forget the potential that is constantly waiting/building in bitcoin.... If we capitulate really low and bounce hard, im talking 3-4k levels and have some swift movement back up towards these 7k levels...... Well, I imagine a lot of folks out there would consider it over.... I think its the final lance needed to restore buying pressure.... 

So in typical bitcoin prediction nonsense, a dip down reeeeeallll low, may actually be good for bitcoin.... We all know its possible, that 100k per bitcoin isn't out of the range of possibility, just need to complete the cycles before another one can begin anew....  soooo that being said, everyone maintain a level head in the coming weeks!!! 

Closed my 5x long from 7.7K. That's it, I'm done with trading this shitty market.
Okay Monday let’s get it together better than yesterday. 
nice pump here. had to test 7k again at some point, right?
RSI Bullish Divergence on the 1 day chart https://www.tradingview.com/x/eSXyTXvu/

Above I have labeled the bull div in thick pink, circled the 3 legs down for this bear run in red circles, and targets are purple (volume profile node) and light blue (62% local fib).  Orange lines represent lower lows, which could be used to play break down or to risk longs off of.

Breaking the orange lines would be very bad for long term outlook on BTC.  Risk:reward is on the Bulls side right now.

Cheat sheet on Divergence: https://i.imgur.com/Rfd1et0.png
Okay so I'm finally using BitMEX to make trades (previously it was all on Binance) so now I can use leverage. Getting ready to make my first trade if I see a good opportunity. 


I'm looking at the 30m chart and I have to say, it kinda looks like a bear pennant. The volume is decreasing, it's preceded by a sharp downtrend, it all fits.


My only issue is that I think there are too many shorts in good positions. On the previous daily thread, someone made a comment showing that every single short was in profit and most longs were underwater. And I don't know how to feel about this. Maybe the whole "maximum pain" is just a meme, but it seems to have held true for quite a while.


Thoughts?

Edit: Also I sent some Bitcoin to BitMEX about 5 blocks ago and it says it will arrive after 1 block confirmation but it hasn't arrived yet. I don't know if anyone here can tell me anything about that but if you can I would like that.
Ok Bitmex funding is negative now, so a good time to cover more of my hedge short and add to my long.
Out of 7500 short at 6800. Will wait for break of coinbase 4h low 6666.66 before shorting again. Above 7800 long. This is a potential bottom but  probably fake.. lets see...
Thank goodness we have the exchanges propping up BTC when needed.
I'm very tempted to cover some of my short here if only to re-add back at 6.9-7k. But the volume profile does not match other bottoms--namely, there was a lot of volume on the dump, but none for this pause right here. Sticking with my plan of keeping my short open and adding more if it reaches 6.9-7k.
Welp, good news is I managed to average my June Futures entry down to $7600. Bad news is that I'm not sure that the price will rise above that by the time the June Futures get settled... Oh, well :) 
Gdax chewed through 4 different 100 BTC sell walls in the past 2 hours and still have a couple more to go. The price has stayed the same more or less throughout.  It seems like the bears on gdax aren't worried about having to sell and instead patiently waiting for their walls to get eaten. Not sure if this is bullish or bearish.
The R/R of a long here is too good of a position to not be in. The overall sentiment here is beyond bearish so a reversal wouldn’t surprise me. 

Added more to my 6700 long at 6710 with stop loss at 6590. If 6600 falls I expect this to crash hard.
bought in 4k worth at 15k. Held through 20. Now I'm at 2500 loss IF I sell. Holding on long. I planned on holding a minimum of a year regardless so I have 6 months or so min.

The [BTC NVT Indicator](http://charts.woobull.com/bitcoin-nvt-ratio/) is very bearish.
Everyone seems super bearish and fearfull is this not the time to be greedy?

I am not saying it is, just interested in peoples opinions.
My next critical support line is way down currently @ around 3k. https://www.tradingview.com/x/C0YjP9AG/ . Do you have any others earlier than that? I don't think we will drop that far right away, but at eoy that line will be around 5k, which I believe is very much possible. I pulled out half my stack into fiat @ above 8k and hedge shorted the rest. Will consider closing my hedge short if the blue downtrend line is convincingly broken. 
edit: spelling
Just emptied out my Vanguard account by buying GBTC (its all the liquidity I have left at this point). Yeah, I'm a degenerate and I know it.
So does that move just now invalidate our descending triangle?
u/haserfauld
?
The only good thing I can say right now is that the trip down to sideways APPEARS to have happened much quicker than in 2013. That's assuming we have reached true sideways at this point. If we are still sliding then everything I say here is garbage anyway. But assuming a time-to-sideways (TTS™) of six months from the bubble peak, we may see ourselves moving back up slowly by 2019. Keep hope alive
The market is too mature for a new MtGox. But if the US regulators get their hands on the trading records they ask, and \*if\* these exchanges do any trading at all on their own platforms, their practices will be scrutinised. And it's not impossible that the regulators find more than what they were looking for, beyond futures related shenanigans.

Maybe someone here knows if they do in fact trade on their platforms?
Bearish pennant playing out on the Bitcoin 15m chart, a bearish continuation pattern. Stops set above the resistance, as break up would obviously invalidate it. have stops set just above resistance. If we break up, will wait for retest of support and it it holds will go long for 6900 target. When we breakdown(like my thinking?) my first target is 6500.

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/hfDKeX7x/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/hfDKeX7x/)
Closed out 70% of my short from CA 7400 at 6855. Happy with the big gains I made and thinking we are about to bounce up a few hundred before heading back down. The Wyckoff chart below was convincing to me that it's not gonna break another big leg down just yet. Will be adding back to my short at some rough combo of Fib levels and horizontal resistance underneath the possible support-turned-resistance of the big triangle in increments from 6975 to 7175, or reshorting below 6.5.
Question for you guys. If the Mt. GOX trustee isn’t allowed to sell until Sept, aren’t things going to get a lot worse until then and sometime after all the uncertainty?
Call me crazy... after burning myself with a 10&#37; loss on my long yesterday, I added $30K long @6758 unleveraged for the long term. I cant help believing this is a bargain right now.
I believed the 7k price point, now I'm dead inside ama.


Model price based on tx rate: 7-day average: $4765, 28-day average: $4526.

 Model price = 10^-0.638 \* (tx per day)^2.181 / # total coins.

Explanation is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2hyl9c/daily_discussion_wednesday_october_01_2014/ckxhy9y) with [historical graphs of price vs. model](https://i.imgur.com/HnZQ9rv.png) (last updated 2018-04-09) and [graphs of other correlations](http://imgur.com/a/7koaG) (last updated 2017-01-30). The code is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2oyrfq/code_for_tx_model/) if you want to improve on it.


**Accuracy of model and recent bearishness**

 Note, that this model has been doing relatively well if it is within *the same order of magnitude* of the price. That is to say, it is not a very accurate predictor of price, and to be within a factor of two of the market price (as recently) is effectively no strong signal. However, the prediction did dip just before the recent pop.

**Batching, UTXO count and so on.**

I have seen no convincing evidence that batching is currently a major effect to reduce the daily tx rate, and a cursory examination shows a similar dip in the UTXO network measure.
I am interested, long term, in alternatives to tx rate (given lightning etc) but I do not think UTXO count is a convincing alternative over, for example, unique addresses.
Parsing the blockchain directly for outputs per block is one possible alternative to deal with batching, payment channels notwithstanding.
Isn't this a reverse cup & handle pattern? [https://www.tradingview.com/x/VxZxFVYT/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/VxZxFVYT/) You can see it way better on ALTS
Looking at the 6h and 4h RSI a rebounce must come soon, but looking at the chart and the market tells me another drop must come first. We had two leg downs, first one from 7.65k to 7.25k, second one from 7.25k to 6.7k, I expect we might get a further drop in the dimension of the first drop (down to around 6.4k) and then some bounce and sideways to recharge the RSIs. Will go long with part of my stack if we have one more leg down, as RSIs are so oversold then that r/R is very good  to go long. 
I've heard a bit of talk of a triple bottom. Obviously absolute prices aren't identical (5900, 6400, 6600) but on a weekly chart they pretty much line up. Does anyone know if this qualifies? The only remaining midterm bullish scenario I can think of is such a triple bottom.

Sir, would you pass the [overbought shorts liquidity](https://snag.gy/TDn2FS.jpg), thank you. 
The alt market is disintegrating 

Edit: btc rejecting the dump. Alts not looking too good. If we can hold these levels we can pump.
On a side note:

I’m looking to pick up reading as new hobby when I have some spare time. Definitely want to expand my vocabulary and become more articulate+ educate myself.

**Can anyone recommend any books?**

Looking for books about economics, finance, business as a whole, trading or anything else that’s interesting and can catch a readers eye.


So... with BTC being an absolute basket case.

Anyone got any good investments they’d like to talk about?

Cannabis stock certificates/trackers seem like good options for a long-term HODL.

The Euro looks like it may be going down with the USD. CHF has been an absolute trooper lately.

Anybody looking at some good index funds?
As long as we're above $200, the bull market since 2009 is intact! Bullish stuff.
I'm bullish. downvotes to the left
its hard to imagine how this is not going to at least 6k
Was there ever an explanation for the buy pressure post short squeeze back in late April? 
Sorry if this doesn't belong here. I live in the US and opened a bitmex account using a VPN. Should I use a VPN everytime I access the exchange or is it only necessary on sign-up? I'm just worried about my account being closed and losing my bitcoin. Thanks in advance! 
In the last hour, global BTC volume went up from 5.77 to 5.90 bln usd/24h according to Coinmarketcap. 5.90 is a new local high.
Although I am familiar with TA, I think I may have missed the whole Bart/Marge thing. Would someone please explain these trading terms beyond the obvious cartoon characters?
Shorts have been going up hard, longs are in a slow decline and the price is holding steady...

Real possibility of a short squeeze to trigger a retest of $7k.  I don't think the bottom is in but I would not be surprised if we see a move to the upside in the short term.

Just closed out my short position on ETH at 510.15, just in case.
Possible sign of a reversal: Looking at the Bollinger bands (20MA, 1-D), we are way below lower (-2) band - indicating a buy signal. A rule of thumb says BBands can not be used as indicators to trade against trend, but are we really in a trend? Since June 1, we have been in "no man's land" (between LBB -1 and LBB -2) and thus neutral trendwise. Looking back on the past few months, so far in 2018 we have been this far below the lower (-2) band January 16-17, February 5-6, March 9 and March 23-24, -- and now. Feb 5, March 23 were followed by a trend reversal within about a week, but Jan 16 and March 9 were not. (Edited for clarity.)
If I were manipulating this market I would do something within the next hour or so.  Let the US market get to work, start looking at their cryptos, let the FOMO/FUD set in, then make a move.

Undeniable things not looking good for BTC https://www.tradingview.com/x/V0j29h5e/  BUT good R:R for a long. Buying after trendline breaks but before lower low or lower high is made has been especially profitable in the last 6 months.  Other good piece to this that bull div on the 2 hour RSI still not invalidated:  https://www.tradingview.com/x/JtCQcTa7/
I’m interested to know how many people here (the small guys in comparison to the whales) who have made a significant profit since January. I see so many posts about people who’ve lost a lot of money and are hoping to trade their losses back but ..sometimes I get the feeling companies / maybe corporates who have mass amounts of money wait for the little guys to buy up till a certain $ then they rock the boat just enough which causes “another” downward trend in which they end up buying lower only to rock the boat again ultimately sucking up all our funds as the little guy.

Edit: Typos
Heavy rejection. This is bad
that EMA 12 is flapping its big D around since 16 hours now and baby Bitcoin is unable to avoid being effed..

Timeframe: On the 1H
The market is waiting for a capitulation dip to 5k and possibly 3k IMO, will load there
I'd not inverted the chart for a while. Whew.  How easy it is to let one's own bias take control.

Look at the 1/daily. Would you buy that?

Bears can get as over-exuberant as bulls.
ThecaptialR. I'm here because I enjoy seeing the sentiment of others involved in crypto. As for your comment telling me to enjoy holding my bags. Well, a majority of my portfolio started in April-May 2017. Ya know, when Btc was in 1000 range, Eth was 120, and Ltc was 45. I enjoy holding my bags so much that I added more weight to them multiple times this year. Good luck with whatever your strategy is. I'd recommend you sell since your bagholding comment sounds like projection. I'm sorry if your underwater. I don't like seeing anyone loose money.
I'm a simple man with [simple TA](https://imgur.com/a/9QrjtQh) but I'm very excited for this. This last move was a bull trap, RSI hit 30, price went up & everyone thought this was the new bottom. I made some good money off it on the ride up & down, so I'm not complaining. I think were looking at the real bottom now & the start of the next play. Smart move is a hedged long, and if we break like 6.5k short with all you got.
Looks like a total fakeout to me. I'm going to do something I seldom do and place a small short with a fairly tight stop.  Short at 6870 5x, stop at 6930 in case things go badly.
woooooohooooooo, good weekend to buy back some bags. i was bearish after the bubble but think we are at a floor, no one wants to sell the bottom, and old hands are starting to nibble at the supply again.
BTC is acting like a true shitcoin, who would have thought
Let's see if the mythical Monday pump comes, bought at 6734 a small position 
We seem to be painting a mini bear trap on the smaller timeframes. No one longing this, whales have scarred everyone. 

FWIW, I longed thinking 7.2 would hold and went to sleep without stops. Holding some heavy bags and plan to take a moderate loss on support turned resistance test between 6.9-7k. 
Last 15 mins was a great chance to make it a bart but it failed. Guess we're going down now. https://www.tradingview.com/x/aWaKhkY9/
Are you giving up yet?

No hope, picking up new hobbies.. what? I haven't even uninstalled my price widget yet.
Patiently waiting for Tethers pump
Really nothing for me has changed in weeks and weeks...still my targets are (roughly) 5k,3k,1.3k
In the short term the most bullish case I can see would be a short-term bounce to perhaps 7200 at most. Otherwise more consolidation before heading lower to 5k-ish
Have increased my trading stack by over 6x in the past month by going 10x short over and over again
Good trading and peace to all
Can I edit a closed position on the position bot. Just got stopped out at 6846 but closed my position on the bot at at 7846. 
Is there any significance to the green candle 4 hrs ago just so as to close the daily in the green? Does it really matter if yesterday ended green or red?
Attention everyone: we are aware that there are 24-25k shorts open, but until it gets close to 38k, nobody cares! 

Edit: just keep seeing people post the same thing over and over again. We get it, you went long and are underwater and are looking at what might save you.
[deleted]
Trading is risky here. But as an investor, I'm quite happy to continue buying here. Hope it comes down more so I can buy even more. So long as it does that go-up thing again. Which I believe it will.

Beware the third leg
Added to a full hedge here. CA for xbtu is 6.8. Position bot updated manually.

I just don't see a reason for this to bounce. If it will I'll be probably adding 1x at 7k and another 1x at 7.2, Stops at 7.3.
Keeping my fingers crossed for this to be an epic triple bottom (Feb - Apr - Jun) in the making.
So again these are called BEAR FLAGS (30m) and they signal continuation downward
From some comments I see that people are selling now that it's oversold. This sub is always late to the party :) Do you think this is going down on a straight line? Relax ;)
I'd say with 65&#37; confidence this dump is over and there is no third leg.

[https://imgur.com/a/Hhhs71q](https://imgur.com/a/Hhhs71q)

1. Start of the dump.

2. Another "coins dump" but failed to attract traction and bring the price lower.

3. Another failed attempted with much lower volume.

No panicking deposits: [https://blockchain.info/address/3D2oetdNuZUqQHPJmcMDDHYoqkyNVsFk9r](https://blockchain.info/address/3D2oetdNuZUqQHPJmcMDDHYoqkyNVsFk9r) I'd say we'll be up shortly. Greener numbers by tomorrow at least for BTC
the friday close for cme was around 7600 i think, really good chance we head there this week

there has not been one gap that hasn't been filled, will this time be different?
Lurking here and it is easy to see that the capitulation phase has not even started. People talk daily about opening longs.

Will it go up or down from here? No idea.

But the downtrend is probably far from over. People are way to optimist about buying the fucking dip
Added to my short up to 50% hedge, gonna ride this for a while and see how this plays out. For now 6.8 is resistance. It may still go up and test 7.2 as support turned resistance (where I'll be shorting hard) but honestly I think we'll test 6.8 couple more times before next leg down.

ATH line is at 6050 now, there is thin air between here and there. 6.5 may play as support for a while as it was last local bottom.

!short xbtu18 add 6700 1x 40%
these days when SEPA is underway and the price is rising meanwhile -.-
There hasn't been any significant FUD for a while, but BTC hasn't even reached 10k yet. The last significant FUD I remember was about the "hacking" of Binance. That was about 2 months ago. I know the road to another ATH is slow and perilous, but this bloodbath is getting too ridiculous IMO. 
IDGAF what happens short to medium term. All's I wanna do is praise whoever dropped the prices to allow me some 10 % discounted crypto! Long term, talking YEARS, I'm super bullish. Ain't nothing going to take that away from me.

Everything we see happens in cycles. Imagine a tree for instance. It grows to its peak and begins the process of decay. Eventually that tree dies. This same cycle happens for humans, plants, and animals. 

Knowing everything moves in cycles, consider this. Everything that has happened is merely a passing by parade. Be grateful and cherish those memories as you were lucky enough to have caught that parade at the moment you did. Why I like crypto is because we have watched it grow, peak, and "die" many many times. Every time it has been called dead, it began a new cycle of birth/death. 

Some of you sound as though you need to step back and take a break. Throw what you got in cold storage and relax. Have a great day folks.
With that small green dildo I'm thinking it may have just been an over correction and we will be 7k again soon
Any possibility we reach 10k by December? 75% chance?
I'm sold on RSI for shorts being an indicator to go long on bitcoin. When the shorts are way overbought, it's a good time to buy.
Another "manipulation".

This little dump started around 9:50 and ended at around 9:58. Then at 10:00 the 4h candle closed and we recovered back to where we started, but the 4h RSI recovered with this move more than 10 points. This is the way how the oversold RSIs will be reset here.... (by the Bears, not by the Bulls).

The same happened on 23rd and 24th May.
Hmm judging by people's positive demeanor, I'd say we haven't quite felt maximum pain yet
I don't think the local bottom is in, but here's a pattern for the bulls: https://imgur.com/a/3bTczJQ

The closer to 6k you can get an entry, the better.
Shorts now 25k, just saying Mr BartWhale..
Do you agree the longer it takes to recover the more likely to deep lower ? This break lasts for 24h now
Don't see any point shorting until it breaks 6666.66 coinbase 4h low. Could be fake but might as well try long here 6860 stop 6630 as potential risk/reward ratio so nice...
Shorts are becoming overbought on almost every time frame on finix.  Incoming squeeze, is this an epic bear trap?
This might end up with a short squeeze again if price doesn't fall below 6K anytime soon and panic selling start. 

https://tr.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSDSHORTS/
Guess it's time to go long, hoping for a bounce, who knows... I don't. But I'm still going long.
Has anyone assessed how mining profitability will be affected if BTC goes below 3k or 2k? 
[deleted]
Not seeing the tripple bottom that the bulls are talking about, atleast not yet. Currently seeing a [bearflag](https://www.tradingview.com/x/WgqDcyJE) that just needs consolidation before a breakdown. It could bart up but ultimatly i think its going down to kill the remaining hype before a new bullrun can start. The number to look for is 6.45K ish for a tripple bottom or a prolonged stay in goblin town. So let see how this goes.
So was that a false breakout earlier? New to this just been doing alot of research.
Is it considered bullish if we move side-way through a diagonal downtrend line?  The price action is so bearish but technically it is about to break out of the downtrend line from the last couple of days from 7.6k.  (Unless it dumps of course)
So I had someone tell me recently that horizontal support lines are stronger than diagonal support lines.

They were referring to the price breaking down out of our recent big symmetrical triangle and saying that they expect the price to bounce off the horizontal support line/area we have in the high 5000's/low 6000's.

Is there any truth to that historically? I haven't heard of that before.
OK, I like what I'm seeing. I will go long 2X from 6750, add at 6500 and set a hodl stack buy at 6500.
Burnt a sizeable amount of my trading stack yesterday.

I do not see Bitcoin making new highs anymore. It has lost it's magic for me at least, the interest is fading away, I am not buying more. I do not see the price going back up by a good margin unless we see another $6,000 like event, that too doesn't guarantee it. It is just a matter of time it all comes down crashing hard..

While I think of the above, I also reflect on my performance, behavior and attitude for better trading for myself in future. 
Shorts are going up,  we might see a little bounce here.
This buying pressure was quite intense. Expecting a little DCB till 7k, our possible support turned into ressitance, which we should reject heavily. 
[deleted]
I sure hope that was a double bottom.
People are getting desperate, hopeless and rekt. This is hopium for me. We need more pain. I’m not shorting this because of fear of getting squeezed but I’m glad we’re getting some action finally. A month of sideways totally mind fucked me and it’s way worse than goblin town IMO
60% fiat, will begin re-entry upon another 5-10% dip. Prepared to wait.
When you look at the weekend breakdown out of the symmetrical triangle it looks so insignificant

https://imgur.com/I2a4YSj
Any potential flash crash catalysts on the horizon?
Would the 'highly probable' fed rate hike announcement on Wed have any effect on BTC? Just looking for opinions.
BTC seems less organized, but the [ETH ~~Falling~~ wedge](https://imgur.com/a/xDeiG1a) is pretty clear.  (BTC is background in yellow)

A.  Does the tail wag the dog?  If we see ETH breakout one way or the other will it bring BTC along?

B. Is a wedge off a downtrend always a reversal?  70/30?  50/50?

Edit: Brain fart, yes, not a falling wedge.  Was thinking about the BTC chart where the initial low and second dip are downward sloping.
Any hopium left for the bulls? 
[deleted]
Well Well... Crazy weekend... let's see what brings this week.
Permabears are just as stupid as permabulls. Well on a longer term they are more stupid but the last few months as traders they are smarter. But they are both stupid. Patience wins. The market doesn’t move one way. 

You short when the price has gone up. And you close when it crashes a lot. You don’t add near what could be a bottom. Just because Bitcoin probably will be 4k sometime within the next year doesn’t mean you should short at 6.6k with margin lol. 

[deleted]
RSI says we're way overshorted. Is this really just an overshorted dip or are we really going to $2?
Looking at the fundamentals, BTC doesn't look very good. Won't work as a currency and still too unstable as a value holder. Looking at the price development over months, it looks like AOL. First in, first out. Sorry guys, downvote me if you must but it is what it is and this is it.
Technicals say we go to 1.2k now, broke down from triangle on high volume. But that just seems too unlikely, but i will be worried for bulls if it goes below 6k.


Inverted Bart coming soon.

We need to hit 7200 tonight 😫 unlikely but likely it would be nice 
Ain't nobody knows wtf goin on but one things for sure, whales are directing this and they wait for volume to drop before trying anything. 
[deleted]
What if -- I mean, just suppose for a moment --- this whole "bear market" has really just been a leisurely bull walk? What happens when the run starts?
 
Oh, and by the way, I'm up nicely on my long from 6750 earlier today. Not closing though I may place a break-even (or above) stop later for the sake of sound sleep.
So... I did not check all but was this Dump because of the Hack in S. Korea? - Coinrail?

Or And And... technical and this Hack News?

Shorting from $15k has been the easiest trade strategy I've ever engaged in. It's so simple and effective. All I have to do is check every day if lightning network has become viable. And every day it's not, I keep shorting. The devs make it so easy and I really do give them all the credit for making me so wealthy. I hope they don't start making progress or I'm going to start having to think about the market and changing it up. What a terrible day that will be. 
Lol I closed my long at 6929. I set that limit order last night. I really do have a fucking knack for getting those perfect exits. I guess watching Bitmex pumps/dumps for all those hours did gain me some kind of skill 
it's dead jim. everyone and their mother knows this shit is a ponzi! Just look at how much the volume dried up, the liquidity keeps on dying as it shrinks more desperate whales are going to market dump and order books are gonna get thinner. I know crypto billionaires who are panic selling, who normally would not care or sell anything, ever

My buy orders are set at $800 BTC and $55 ETH.

However I'm bullish on BTC super long term, i think as we're moving towards more of a digital world, a digital currency will be important and nothing is better than BTC. BTC could be super useful in a vr world.
**we are aware of a billion+ $BTC sale that is in process. Tier 1 bank executing in layers. Sell side pressure will continue. Act accordingly.

Friendly discussion.
Thoughts on TA : 

-it works, note : I have my own definition of what it is meant to do, hence I believe it works relative to this use.

-many people misinformed on its use and how to use

-indicators are all mathematical representations of the same thing

-besides those using different variables i.e. ticks, volume, price



Kim will admit to Trump that NK have been using BTC and involved in some hacks. Trump will come down hard on BTC. Source insider. Watch 12th carefully and Trumps tweets.
Reversal?
I mean... we *have* to call it Mt. Gox, right?
Dude that's awesome. Can you do Dec 2017 to now?

And for the moonmen (and honestly me too, it'd be cool to see) do 2011 to now? O_O
That is great.
Dude you need to make this a website lol
log scale? for context, that makes 2011/2013 a speed bump.
> In general when the majority of people think they've figured this market out, it does the opposite.

Clearly not true. You're supposed to buy/sell every other 5th of the month, and I bought 6/5 and....wait...shit.
It's a pretty flawed comparison. Piling on shorts while price goes from 10k to 12k is very different from piling on shorts when the price goes from 7.5k to 6.5k. 
What are we looking at here? Increase in shorts as the price hits a local high?
Thanks for this. Good points. The fact that those who want the price to go up are counting on a short squeeze to do so shows we're deeply entrenched in a bear market
[deleted]
> the possibility to dump or pump is equally likely based on what happens when shorts pile on. 

Whilst me being just meh, went into another long. lol.
Shhhhhhh they will stop adding longs if they think the squeeze won't happen....
> I'm not pannicking yet, but I think i will if we go sub 7.4k. 

We're already sub 7.4k. Panicking yet? ;)
I was down like 40 percent this morning, tethered and buying back in lower - hopefully
I really don't get why anyone would want to hold here if you think the price is likely to go much lower before it eventually (maybe) recovers.  
we are almost certainly going below 6.4k so pepper your angus.
> Down quite a bit on my hodlings (~20%)

20% is nothing. If you expect to be up by 300% in the next 3 years, you need to be able to stomach being down by the same amount
You could say that for every single asset out there lol.
i packed bags of soylent, dm me for OTC deal.
I agree. I think we will go down to bottom out finally at 5000. That price seems likely as the bottom because that's the price that miners will stop selling. 5000 is the tipping point where they would be selling at a loss.
A great share. Many thanks! More good resources on Wyckoff: http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:market_analysis
You're referring to distribution, yes?

Because wouldn't accumulation have the creek on the upside, not the downside of the range..? 
> I'm a buyer at these levels and will load up the truck if it drops to $6500 with a stop loss at $6400.

That is a smart way to play it. I'm short from above, but will probably scale into a long between 6750-6450 and bail on breakdown. 

We broke our support line as everyone knows, but horizontal/historical numbers matter too. A lower low is the remaining missing piece, which comes with a 6400 breakdown as you noted.
I've always been bullish on BTC and i still believe that we will test 20k again in the future but sold at 9.9k and decided to take a long break. When i look at the chart for me it just seems like a massive descending triangle and i wouldn't be surprised if the market makers decide to push through the bottom soon, so that they can pick up some cheap coins at ~3-4k. 
sure but we broke the triangle to the downside. that's the problem.
So what's the bullish narrative if $6400 breaks?
It feels like we are waiting for some whale to push the price on either direction.
Didn't get a very good 3rd impulse up on the triangle, so there wasn't that much bear fuel to follow up the break, we have fallen all the way from 10k without a strong rally. The lower timeframe RSIs got to historic lows. I think we will continue to grind down lower, but it will take some time. The pattern could morph to a flat bottom triangle and we could rally off the low 6ks. I'm eagerly waiting to buy in the low 6ks under favorable conditions, even though I think eventually we will go lower.

We've hit a key horizontal support level and flagging on it.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/qKxqKkDv/

* purple shadowy bit is the diagonal support (we broke it)

* Orange line is the horizontal
Common for when formations are broken for there to be a retest of if the old support turned resistance, which we haven't done yet. If the support has turned resistance, another free fall is likely
I'm not a TA trader but saw a weird trend over the past few days. We stalled around $7600 and though I only hold alts, even though BTC was staying the same, my alts were slowing dropping over 1-2 days, where it would normally rise as BTC stabilizes. I thought it was quite strange that my alts slowly dropped. Sure enough shortly after that BTC takes a big dump.
[deleted]
what I don't get is why the SEC is investigating but they're ignoring bogdanov.  I saw a video showing clear evidence he's a market manipulator and is responsible for this big move down. 

Just a quick Q: did you re-draw the channel to make it fit the prices? I still have mine as it was when it first formed.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/CvM6kAJN/

Mine looks like it's being resisted at the bottom of the channel whereas yours look like it's inside the channel.
Should we re-draw parallel channels/ trendlines?
I believe the old log trendline (currently sitting around 6100) could bring us support too since 2014/15 we broke it to the upside and then went down along with it 
The party will resume soon. Usually around noon EST.
I hope shorter than around 7.5 :P
[deleted]
Bart up or Bart down?
I’m 100% confident we are barting up 

Watch it bitches 
you think Sunday is bad? prepare for Monday!
The line looks like a good buy right now to me (lines up with the major 5850-6000 support).
Yes, something concerning for me is the fact that we dropped 900 points in a day, and that’s our bounce? 
Why don't you just PM him and not put so much pressure on him publicly. 
The first chart doesn't have enough resolution or sensitivity.

The second chart is a good idea but I don't really understand how to read it.

I'm still curious if someone can put together something that has a gradient in the body of the candle and thickness on the wicks to show individual tensor volume within each candle. If someone makes this, be sure to name it gypsy candles and provide me with the code. 
Should have bought 6666.66 BTC there!
Yep experienced

Looks like a Bart waiting to happen.
We are touching the line there now.
If the decision is made to take it higher those buyers will do what they always do and show up out of nowhere.  Everyone is just holding out for the lowest possible price but in this range the interest is likely here because most people would be looking for a run at least to 8K.  It's a buyers market though no doubt.

at 100X the margin requirement is 50%, or margin call at 6716.25. You will be giving up 50% of your margin to liquidation fund (the fund is getting huge recently with massive amounts of liquidations). 

Its way better to allocate more funding and set a market order stop loss of 1% or at 6682, doubling your stop loss.

Edit: sorry for your loss.
50x probably would have been better, but glhf

I think it's crazy how little coins relative to the total supply it takes to manipulate the market.

With that being said, I think that the big miners (who have shit tons of coins) are never going to let it get too low without a major fight.  Probably they will let it get low enough to shake out less profitable miners, but not lower, then eventually moon.
Discovered bitcoin in November 2013 and bought my first full coin for $260. Watched it spike to $1100 and dip all the way back down to the low 200s the following years. I kept buying then and I’m still buying now when I have extra money. Sure I could’ve tried to time the market and sold high and bought back lower, but I’m more confident in bitcoin long term (5-10+ years) than I am in my ability to time the market. 


I came to my own conclusion in 2013 that bitcoin is binary. I believe it will either be “the one world currency” and change the world as we know it, or it’ll be worth nothing. People on the internet were calling me an idiot bag holder in 2014-2015, and they’re calling me an idiot bag holder now. I don’t care. It’s worth more than it was 5 years ago, so I’m more confident in it now than I was in 2013. 


I’ll sell enough to pay rent if I have to, but other than that, I’m not selling. To me, it’s always been binary. I’m on this ride to 0 or early retirement. Call me an idiot all you want, but it’s worked out for me so far. I’m still relatively young with no wife or children, so I can afford the risk. When/if I have other people depending on me, I’ll buy a house and diversify into more stable assets (if bitcoin is still this volatile), but until then I’ll take my chances. 

TLDR: I’m never selling unless I need the money for bills, but I keep a decent safety net in fiat for emergencies. 
Long term holder. This price is still well above what I bought for. So is 4K. I'll get nervous at around 2.5K if we see it. 
No chance of me selling anytime soon.
Didn't sell in 2014. When it all looked hopeless. Or in early 2013 at $50. Why would become a weak hand now? If anything I will start buying to watch that BTC number go up to make myself feel better. Or I'm thinking of just doing a stop limit order and keep moving it down
I'm at that point where I could forget all about the money I have in Crypto without any real impact. I don't have a nuclear option but if I did get to the point I would need to use it I'd have a very strong feeling it wouldn't fall further enough to warrant said action.

I sold at 6800 on Feb 6th and it went right back up soon after and that haunts me more than the loss at the time.

Edit \- I know people believe in triangles but I don't other than them being a self fulfilling prophecy of traders trading what they see. I can certainly see higher lows and lower highs right now but as we've fallen through the bottom of a triangle it means we can go straight up 2k as well. Especially if miners want the price higher.
long time holder here (2013). No point for me to sell. i will reconsider this if we get under 1k, problably at 500$ im out with still 250% profit back.
Actually I am holding back with purchases. Please give me a chance to pick up another dozen or two for a really big discount.

Remember, halving is coming.
I guess it just depends on whether people have put in more money than they can afford to lose. It will be easier to hold if you just added a bit of btc to your stack every month instead of someone that put in all his life savings.
I will probably only ever sell sub 1k... cuz then BTC will be pretty fucked for a while.
nah. I sold like 5% of my stack at 16k, 5% at 10k just to take profits. If it keeps going down I'll re enter with those funds.
No I'm either holding until Bitcoin is a currency I can use to get by in every day life, or until what I've accumulated can be sold for enough to retire with, and I dont have to worry about money ever again. 

I never put in more than I can afford to lose if we see it drop to $0.00, so I don't care what it does in the mean time. If it goes up great. If it goes down, oh well, i believed in the wrong thing.
No. For me capitulation means just forgetting about it for a while. This summer is going to be 2017 in reverse, most likely.
Below 5k, that’s when I will truly consider the option. Even then, don’t think I could bring myself to sell everything. 
[deleted]
No, I would not sell. I would buy. It's not like I haven't seen these dips before.
I already sold at 8K.  Planning to rebuy with the same amount sometime below 5K or whenever it feels right.

No. Just taking this time to build up a further btc stack just like 14,15,16,17. Doing the same since late 2013 with a longer term view (8-10 years) pretty much framed by halvings. Only thing I sell is forks (any I can find trading on exchanges).
I’ve been holding since early 2014. Long term, we are only going up. This market is still very small and immature, with a lot of room left to grow (along with a variety of other reasons that will imo drive growth). 

Of course, I could just be *completely* delusional, but I don’t think so. Bitcoin is the ultimate honey badger, and every time you think it’s “dead” it comes back even stronger than before. Regulatory clarity and institutional investment will drive the next bull run imho (I know we’ve heard that a lot lately)- but that could take a few years to happen. 
nope, I took what I needed to live off of for 3 years and just hodling the rest until at least the next halvening (maybe longer if adoption is clearly picking up/attitudes shifting towards crypto)

but I am also a trader and will increase my stack if we move down further
ETH's ratio jumps have been wild since yesterday and as a result, BTC isn't really getting affected by it at the moment. However, shorts outnumber longs again on ETHUSD (not by much, though) and I'm not confident about shorting it (or BTC, by proxy).
Do you think ETH could still be leading the market? It’s movements over the last day look more “natural” than Bitcoin if you know what I’m saying.
it's a possibility, it would get confirmed around 9000 with a target of 12000
People were calling for **double bottom** reversal early April. The 'reversal' turned into a huge inverted sort-of cup&handle, exactly like the preceding Feb-March 'reversal', only weaker this time. Amazingly, weekly higher lows were maintained.

I will go on the record here and call triple bottom a meme, although it does match the TA description thus far. If you picked up this idea from TheMoon YouTube, do yourself a favor and /unsubscribe. Hope I'm not coming off like a prick here, wish you the best of trades to come:)
Wishful thinking... clearly a descending triangle on the verge of breaking down
[deleted]
I would say it's very bullish. It's like the moment you threw your wallet in a safe and said "Eff this. Dead money." it's usually right at that moment that things start to look up.
It's horizontal, cutting the Feb 6th wick
Feb 6. Early April. Now. You can cut wicks on TBs cuz the announces don't have to be exactly the same.
The people who don't know what a triple bottom is, but use then term anyway, are referring to the feb 6, april 1, and may 27 (now changed to june 10) lows.
^ orange line is my "last hope" line, which we're consolidating around.
Posted to hint about this a month ago and bought a position. https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8cdj98/etc_is_now_listed_as_an_option_under_toolstax . I sold soon after luckily.
Careful with this one boys, listing may take months and the last few coins that were listed on Binance did a full retracement (some even went lower) of their listing pump. If this were December I'd be all in with whatever exchanges funds I had but when there are no buyers finding a greater fool to unload bags on is risky business. 

I'll be looking to buy the actual listing personally.
Restart the Ripple/Coinbase rumors.
Seems like a weird choice, but it is #18 on market cap list and not that dangerous or controversial.  They can't list DASH or XMR or ZEC, because the US gov't will fuck with them too hard.


Having used both a fair amount:

ETC >>> BCH. 

These two competing could be interesting. BCH has $Billions to lose.

Guess which has far more tx per day? ETC

It'll also reap rewards from Ethereum's bewildering lead in protocol development.
[removed]
So basic, so vanilla.. 
not exactly the sign you want to see when yr grappling with the notion that exchanges such as coinbase manipulated the bubble market. this has me more bearish than the price frankly 
Good timing imo. Appreciate your charts and insight :) 
hey man, any chance by your thoughts that this fall isnt a bear trap and bounces back to 7200 and leave the whole world speechless? Thanks for sharing!
Sideways? 
One large whale order would be enough to move this several hundred dollars in any direction.
Wouldn't you want 480p at best for that?
Well, you can't have it both ways. It's either a 4K TV or McAfee eating his dick. 
Still trying to figure out if he is going to blow himself or cut it off and eat it with a fork and knife.  And maybe some barbecue sauce.
As someone who has been here since 2013 and has lost way more $$ value than you on this bear market.... I have nothing to tell you.

But I'm not selling. 
"long term hodler" "started in June 2017". Dude.


If it makes you feel better, I know someone who's currently down over 2 million.  They aren't whales either so this is probably around 50% of their total net worth.
You are not a full on long term holder until any move whatsoever still leaves you dead inside.
You should still be working, you could be investing massive amounts of money right now instead of sitting on your bottom at what may be the bottom.  Investing isn't a one time thing, you keep doing it.  If you can live off of your crypto for only 1-2 years more, you aren't even close to being able to retire on crypto.  You are just going to blow through what should be kept in crypto and making gains.
[deleted]
Live by the hodler sword, die by the hodler sword.  If you are a blind holder, your fate is completely at the whims of the market.  Everyone else has control over your life, not you.

And not to sound callous, because I feel your pan and I tried holding back in 2014 and lost half of that amount in a couple of months.  I bailed and of course, if I would have held, I would be up 120x on that money, but I still did the right thing at the time.

Anyway, sounds like you need to take some profits on most or all of  your position. It would have been better to do it at $12K, but better now than at $3K.
Wait, you bought in at $2500 and you have enough to live off of for years, even if it drops another 50%? For the love of god, how much did you put in???

I don't honestly expect you to answer, just thinking out loud. But yes, to what others have said, do stay busy for sanity's sake and do read up on the sunk cost fallacy. 

Best of luck, you don't want to end up like the lottery winner phenomenon. 
You either have insanely good luck or buying skill if you started June 2017 and are still 18x. You've done better than 99% newbies entering at that time.
Take like 1% of your initial investment and play with it on Mex. Low lev, nothing more than 2x. If you lose it all just stop.

Playing with small money lets you learn trading and you can trade without emotions. If you do good you may trade with bigger amounts and make more money.
2013 here. I feel you.

I'm DCA accumulating w/ increasing volume as this dips. Hoping for new 2018 lows.

Frankly, I'm very grateful for this prolonged low <$300B aggregate crypto market cap. For a while, I wasn't sure we'd ever see this level again. Doubtful it'll last long. 

Too many builders, too much openness & permissionless competition, too many brilliant engineers.
You have to change it yourself.
Wait til like 3k
I'm curious. Looking at your pattern, if it went up from here is it not possible it would form an inverse head and shoulders, or was the first "shoulder" too low?
Or it could be other way too - test 1, test 2, test 3, test holds, up and way..

Or it could be the next one, as these bounces are getting smaller.
This thing surely looks desperate to drop, but bulltards are agressively buying the dip every single time. I think this have a lot to do with the thousands of longs from the 7200 level and higher. They're striving for survival. If this drops again, it will mean liquidation for them. Or is it simply the lack of people willing to open shorts in the sub 6700 territory ?
Wait for a pull back. Its consolidating in a tiny range right now. Dont know what targets you set nor your position size.

But if I were to trade right now, id short from 6.8ish target 6.6ish.

EDIT: misread your post. you were asking if you should close your short hahaha.
dont know where you got in. Id mark the main 3 fib levels incase of a retracement from the drop 7700 to 6700 and probably just put a take profit, behind one of them, depending on risk tolerance. 


There's been a few nobbles at 6800 now that have been slapped back down.

Currently out of position, but will likely short another rejection with a small position.
Pretty much my take.
With absolutely no technical reasoning to back it up, I assume the last weeks have been incredibly profitable for some people. I see no reason why they would not simply play the same game again until it gets boring (not profitable). I expect another cycle to start. It’s what I would do.

Full disclosure, I got caught with my hand in the cookie jar yesterday playing with alts. 
Time to go long.
> https://www.tradingview.com/x/eSXyTXvu/

Would it be invalidated if it has another leg down and RSI makes a lower low? Or that's strong enough that it'll most likely play out?
I would highly suggest avoiding any sort of wall street/hodler aphorisms/memes as a basis for your trading strategy.

I mentioned this earlier, but you could've literally longed 2.5x at any point from Jan 2017 to November 2017 and you would've only ever gotten close to being liquidated if you longed *the very top* before a 40% correction. Literally any point, pick a point, long 2.5x there. Not liquidated. You would've made a profit every single time until December. That's not maximum pain, that's free money

Maximum pain is yet another meme to justify underwater positions and essentially throwing your hands up and saying "no one knows where it's gonna go!" which is partially true, but sometimes it becomes a little more clear what the trend is.

Same as with "blood in the streets" and "they're stealing your coins" etc. They're all nebulous phrases that can be and frequently are used to justify underwater and nonsensical entries. 

Look at the charts, TA, the fundamentals, sentiment, whatever you use to trade, and base your trades off of that. Do not use a vague saying that can justify both long/short positions. Ask yourself, "could I justify any position with this rule"? if you can, it's a terrible "strategy" to use when trading

If you used that "longs are too comfortable" rule to justify a short in 2017 you would've gotten liquidated about 20 times before giving up entirely. 

For me, I'm not longing until those 32k longs (a large portion of which are significantly underwater) capitulate and begin to close. There is nothing barring shorts from making money here. The vast majority of them are not underwater. I mean really, maybe like 1000/24000 of them are underwater. Longs? It's looking like 1/4 to 1/3 of them are underwater, possibly way more than that. The chances of a long squeeze are becoming more likely the lower we go with longs staying stagnant at 32k.

Add to that the continual bear flags, the amount of denial that we could go lower here (hence the high amount of underwater longs), being rejected from significant price points several times, being under the weekly 50ma, failing to bounce hard off 1d rsi being oversold, lack of adoption, alts barely dropping as hard as btc (not a good sign, signals either delayed, impending doom or investors beginning to decouple alts from btc)- it all adds up to serious weakness in the market. The downwards trend is likely intact now. 

I mean, I could totally be wrong. But there is not a whole lot suggesting a reversal here, in my opinion. 
Time to short this potential local bottom 100x and brag about it in the trollbox 
I have the same position. But be very careful with Bitmex. 
"This is a **potential** bottom but **probably** fake"

Is that a double-potentially-possible expression ?
Damn dude, at what price did you open?
Is 700k Usd a wall nowadays? Oh the old old 20k/btc days...

♩ *Remember when you were young....you shone like the sun...Shine on you crazy asset* ♩
Don't really have any TA to back this up just kind of gut feeling and RSI's being so low, we might have a short term bounce up to 7kish before heading back down deeper towards 6k.
You don’t think a retest of 6500 is more probable? The breakdown of that triangle has really made me lose confidence in any upward momentum. I just don’t see any reason as to why we’d go up here and basing it off this subs sentiment just isn’t enough for me.
Reward is like a $300 move to the upside to test the triangle support as resistance, while the risk is $1,000+ to the downside. Terrible r/r
Yes please open more longs, we need more liquidity to push this lower!
make it two years, bitcoin prices usually soar after the halving event, 2 years from now.
I bought 4.5 K worth at an average price of 13K.  I sold at around 8K for an approximately 1.5K loss.  IMHO, I think this is going to go down more so the plan is to use the capital I preserved by selling at 8K to buy later and thus increase my holdings.

Just hold on. You'll be fine. 
Nice, I've bookmarked that for the future
Not sure I'm as fearful as I am just annoyed with this market right now.
I'm just making sure it's not time to get stupid because i've made some poor choices as of late
I'd say it's still 50/50, I'm honestly suprised at how optimistic people are, talking as if we are now closer to breaking 7800 then we were at 7700.

I just don't understand what you guys think will happen, it's not like longs are going to push this up to higher levels as we've seen multiple times in the past. We need fresh fiat coming it, not a bunch of degenerate gamblers 
The lower it gets, the greedier I get.
[deleted]
people like you brought bitcoin back from the dead after the 2014 crash, lol
Ditto, I've exhausted all my available fiat. Before I'll move on to adding using my available credit lines if we fall lower
Is it feasible to open a self directed IRA and trade it on the exchanges?
Yes.
We broke up out of a descending wedge.

Coinbase ToS states that they can trade their funds on their own platform. 
US regulators can't do shit about exchanges outside the US, but this will make the price drop.

You think why US citizens are blocked on biggest exchanges?
ShitMEX have admitted that their own employees do insider trading. 

Not stated it directly but if you read in between the lines of their statement its pretty obvious.

So I wouldn't be surprised if others are doing it, I'm sure they can see liquidation points on open trades.
That accumulation thing doesn't really make sense. The step back and toe dip isn't supposed to be high volume. 

We just saw the selling climax, which happens at the beginning of accumulation. Doesn't make much sense imo 
Good call. I wish I could have closed at 6600's yesterday.

I agree that we might bounce up a few hundred. I can't seem to close my position based on a guess though :(
He is allowed to sell right now if he can convince the court to do so.  And it's unlikely much will change in Sept.  If civil rehabilitation is approved, it will likely be several more months or a year or two before a distribution.

And if most of the distribution is in BTC, then possibly zero more coins need to be sold.

But yes the uncertainty and confusion by those who know little to nothing about the Gox bankruptcy will probably add some selling pressure.


Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the crypto part of the internet. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen, and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into a short position, and methodically dumping the price—then, I account it high time to get in a margin long as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the exchange. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards crypto with me.
You are crazy
Need that liquidity in order to go lower!
We will continue to go deeper until nobody in this thread is buying dip, because they are all sitting there throwing up all the dip they ate while the price tanked.
Whether or not you're crazy depends entirely upon how much $30K is to you.  
Under 25%? You're not crazy  
Over 75%? You're crazy. 
Going Dutch!!!
> I cant help believing this is a bargain right now.

So zoom out more?
how is the monkey doing?
Seems like it's finally bottomed out? It's been sitting around $4.5k for a few weeks - months now, yea?
Very interesting. In one of your previous post back in 2014 you noticed that ["we are at a historical period of undervaluation"](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2339mt/datamining_the_blockchain_for_price_information/), but I've found it was in April 2014 (date of the graphs upload) 8 months before BTC bottomed to $160 in January 2015. What I don't understand is what was telling you we were at a historical period of undervaluation ? because if I read the [chart](https://i.imgur.com/dUGDuER.png) correctly the black line (price) was above the blue and the red lines which supposed an overvaluated market. Am'I missing something ?
If it is then its already formed and broken down right? More down to go?
With the 6k-12k range, I think the bottoms are close enough. Also the overall volume did decline. But AFAIK it confirms on the highest resistance point, so at 12k, which is a long way to go. I liked the A&E setup a lot more, but unfortunately we couldn't go past 10k.

So overall I do agree this is the bull scenario, but I am not sure if it will happen.
I’m seeing it as well, though I think we have a chance of seeing a lower low this run down. Usual rule I follow is 3 days of blood before the bounce play.
Question, how many attempts do we get at a triple bottom before we can ignore it? Seems like when one things gets invalidated, something new pops up.
How quick can i learn shorting? Haha
https://www.tradingview.com/chart/9elNDepZ/ - Rounded bottom on shorts on the daily, think shorts have a lot higher to go from here.
Not concerned, shorts have much higher to go

Read this, it is not very old but the thing that strikes you when reading it is how drastically things have changed already, and not necessarily for the better.
Blue Ocean Strategy. It’s one of my favorite business books, eye-opening in a way. Helps to understand + gives you a step by step guide on how to create new markets for your business instead of competing with others. Highly recommend.

Made to stick. The book tells about the power of stories, loved it. Will be useful if you ever want to pitch anything, in marketing etc.

Market Wizards. The only book that I’ve read on trading, it’s a collection of interviews with the top traders back in the 80s (or 70s?). Enjoyed it a lot.

The four hour work week. I still can’t believe that it’s been more than 10 years since Tim Ferris published this book. It’s becoming one of the most influential book on entrepreneurs in the digital age. Loved it.

The art of learning. Pretty short book, but had a lot of valuable info. Would read again.

Bonus tip: Tools of Titans. Another book by Tim Ferris. He has a podcast show where he had interviewed hundreds of top performers/millionaires/billionaires/icons in different fields, and the book consist of short transcripts of these interviews. It’s a long book, 600 pages or so.

I could recommend many more, but I hope that’s enough for now! 
You are a young dude that can play scratch golf.  Go work on your game a bit and try to join the tour :-P
You know we're in a bear market when people here start looking into index funds, lol.
Climate impacted real estate, look at where rising sea levels are most impacting coastal areas and buy some property inland from there

Edit: also look at where rising temperatures will make climate more moderate/less cold farther from the equator.
Biotech centering on crisper stocks. Check out EDIT and CRSPR. It’s just as much the future as crypto is the future. 
almost everything is bubbled tbh, personally I'm dca-ing in some vanguard funds.
NASDAQ is making a killing. ATH now. 
My two best stock picks are PACB and IVOB. Both are in biotech. You can't buy IVOB on Robinhood, however.
As this is a trading sub, it should not matter which direction the price is going. There is always money to be made. If you're only here to go long or to hodl then maybe visit other forums. 
Buy the dip and hold. It'll be good.
Check the cobalt lithium space. The horse became the ICE, the ICE is becoming the electric car.
US equities. Developed market equity to a lesser extent. BTC. Residential real estate. XBT.
SoftBank

Buy the dip and hold. It'll be good.
Weed stocks, imo. Canada is just the starting point. Hundreds of billions of dollars will pour into the market after the US eventually legalizes (at least CBD), and it starts becoming a common prescription medication for many things. Pain, anti\-anxiety, depression, inflammation, the list is really endless. The sector is having a bit of the "sell the news" going on right now with the C\-45 bill. I'm looking at this sector as a 5\-10 year investment.
As long as we are > 0 there’s hope!
ATH support may hold.
that 6k bounce area can hold, it has done so twice already 
That's exactly why it won't. 
FOMO, "this time it's different" and the fact we overcame the log resistence from ATH.
I'd use it every time. I don't think they ban for having a US IP address but better safe than sorry :\^)
You don't need a vpn every time you log in. Just sign up and maybe first deposit. After that you’re good. And make sure you backup your 2fa key.

Also, don't get rekt.
The best advice I've seen here is to play around on the testnet first. It turns out that losing bitcoin is ALOT easier than these guys make it sound. :)
Prices don’t move continuously, they are a discontinuous process.

that is, if the price is 6750 now, a single actor can move the price to 7500 in one fell swoop via the market buy button. No other actor will be able to purchase or sell coins anywhere in that price range unless they were already on the order book ahead of time.

This is basically what barting is. The price just jumps from where it is now to where it is in the next instant. Sometimes it is due to multiple actors buying/selling, e.g. stop losses cascading in one direction, but I would wager that more often than not it’s some old shool bitcoiner who just wants to watch the world burn.

Hence the phrase: Eat my shorts

Inverse Bart is when it does the bart upside down.
A guy on Twitter posted a chart with Bart overlayed. It took off and became a meme.

https://twitter.com/TheCryptoDog/status/978466360912154624?s=20
It's literally a reference to charts looking like Bart's head.

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DZdSHW7XkAAzhln.jpg
Someone made a TA that was sideways movement, but zoomed in looked like the top of Bart's head, so it's an inside joke that has no TA value. 

Same w/ Marge, but probably with a large red candle followed by large green candle or vice versa.
Christ, guys, if you think we'll go to ATH just by short squeeze then there's something wrong with you.

We had a huge short squeeze up to 8k and guess what, we're back where we were just before that.

This market will be going down until buyers start buying. Stop blaming shorters like they're the only reason the price drops.
You did the right thing!!!
>I’m interested to know how many people here (the small guys in comparison to the whales) who have made a significant profit since January.

Nearly doubled my crypto trading stack this year in fiat terms, more than tripled it in Bitcoin (coins and cold storage were hedged). Went a bit heavier with trades during the first quarter, risked much more. 
I'm up since January. Tripled my entire account on this massive drop yesterday. You just have to picky on your trades.

Don't fall for the whale games, think like one... You'll quickly realize that there is no such thing as whale games, it's just how the market goes. If this were really manipulated, I would have expected a fakeout a couple days ago to +7800 setting a higher high and than instant bart down. Didn't happen because those whales don't know what's going to happen either. There's always a bigger whale that might have other plans. Imagine dumping several 1000 btc and nothing happens and you have to buy them all again? It's waaay to risky to do such thing. Some whales might try, and those whales eventually stop being whales, unless they are very good at. Like that bart algorithm lol. Game theory explains these situations very well. 


Doubled trading stack mainly through shorting. Sent back what i started with to cold storage and now just playing around/hedging with house $
You're going to get replies from people who say they've made profits but there are a large amount of people who have made losses who won't say anything about it. No one wants to advertise that they lost money.

Also, I genuinely sometimes wonder if people here keep a spreadsheet of initial $$ vs current $$ in terms of current btc prices. 

That is...I think a lot of people don't hedge by default and they could have lost significantly more money than they realize because they see their btc amount is the same but btc, ya know, tanked in price. 
Im up significantly both in btc and usd
I think it's possible within the exchange you have to move into tether though and that's just against my crypto principle.
Your username suggests Craig Spencer but your writing style implies Marius Landman, tee hee!
If your short.
Maybe, maybe not. How long were we in the mid to high $6K just a couple months ago while people were waiting for the double bottom at $5900 and shorts got rekt big time? Also everybody expecting a reversal last week on the 6th? Don't be so certain of anything.
During the bull market they would say "buy some now some later either way its going up"
Well, it looks like it's starting to [break out](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Hpx4XRSL/). Although the volume isn't very convincing and there are multiple resistances overhead. Cautiously bullish and ready to reverse position if it starts dumping again.
I wouldn't take it personally, while we were barting the Bulls called the bears idiots and now the bears are getting pay pack with a couple "I told you so's".

It's the nature of the sub
6.5k support will be hard to break. I personally think we go up from here, making a lower high and back to test it again. But yes things are not looking good.
Blink twice if you've been kidnapped and are under duress.
Welcome to the dark side.
Are we in an alternate timeline?
Bullish!
A fakeout of what exactly? We are oversold and bouncing after a $1k dump. The market hasn’t really shown its hand in either direction yet since then.
You're probably not the only one who longed above 7k thinking the same thing 
I started refurbishing my apartment to get my mind off the > 10% of potential loss yesterday (if I close now). Went and bought building materials today. At least something good will come out of this "experience".
in yoda voice:
you will be, you will.

Risky gambit
What exchange do you use to short and what capital requirements do they require? I am a small fish <$5k in crypto but would love to trade the drops. in the US btw. Thanks!!!
Just message /u/justanotherlogin. 
Yes there is significance to it or they wouldn't have painted the tape to make it happen like that.

It is all manipulated...every day...day after day.  And has been like that for a couple of years, at least.
Now that we all know what happens after a short squeeze, I have a feeling it's much less likely. Anyone shorting here knows the risks and is prepared for another pump/squeeze 

Shorts were completely blindsided last time...now I don't think they're going to be squeezed as easily. 

It would be hilarious and really stupid if the same thing happened twice. I doubt it will play out like that though 
And someone still posted it less than an hour after this post...
That's difficult to imagine. Why would you think it would go there? It didn't go there in January with much heavier dumping, ditto April. Why would it go there now after this Hail Mary desperation dump?
I'm not sure if time is on the side of bulls or bears if we go sideways. That's something I'm trying to wrap my head around right now. There are valid arguements for both cases.
What’s bgd I keep seeing it here
How are you so sure?
you made it leg down!
> triple bottom 

[THIS is a triple bottom](http://tutorials.topstockresearch.com/ChartPatterns/TripleBottom/TripleBottomSampleImage.png)
Already confirmed to be not a triple bottom or a bottom of any kind... 
Can't imagine much dumping to 6k with 4 H RSI so low, then again, it's not bouncing either.
sometimes they bart up.
No, it may do sideways until next drop. Or may bounce a bit up. I'd rather close my hedge with a loss above 7.2 than let it drop further without hedging.
Methamatically IMPOSSIBLE to drop below $7500
Can you post the chart? I'm fairly sure 30-40% of the gaps were not filled. 
Don't CBOE futures close on the 13th too, on the way? That could help too, if there's any validity to futures and their influence on actual Bitcoin.
Longing oversold time periods for short term trades is a way many in here have increased their btc or fiat stacks. I doubt many in here think the market is in a 'good spot' right now, but markets rarely go straight down, right mate?
well here its kind of a "wrong" place. here are the hardline gamblers if you move to other subs like CC or ethtrader you'll see more despair.
I think we're somewhere between denial and panic
you must be new... i hate talking about past ramps and declines as past does not dictate future in markets but.... people bought 
900->165 literally all the down. also Long are always high. you can search this sub to see it. There wasn't nearly as much capitulation as you would expect vs things like forex or equities. It usually one or two really loud guys that people take note of.
Doubt it even makes it to $7200. You and everyone else will be looking to short and dump their bags there. 
/u/justanotherlogin position bot down?
Yeah, after we convincingly broke down from our big triangle I think there will be a point in time where we would move closer to ATH line. So I stacked a few shorts with an average of 6715. 

This time I shorted bigger chunk than usual, but I think I can cope with it since I am unleveraged.

!short xbtusd 6715 1X 70%

you will thank this Sepa waiting Time later down the Week. 
It proves that bear market is a result of technical not news.
Hmmm, i read some fud about a hack in Korea just before the dump, losing BILLIONS of USD on CNNMoney, some fud about regulations and subpoenas... Mainstream media is feasting on crypto fud and having malicious pleasure for some reason... even if the news is misleading.
Ok. Why are you on this message board if you are trading on a yearly time frame. Clearly you care about short term price action otherwise you wouldn't be here. Keep holding your bags bud
See these posts a lot when people took a big hit with there longs
Lol okay bud 
I'm with you there. All this price action now is just noise, it won't matter in the long run. That being said I'm an investor not a trader. The traders here would probably disagree with our approach.
So you're thinking we may have just "accidentally slipped" down into the 6700's?
It isn’t that simple unfortunately. We broke a massive 16 week [symmetrical triangle](https://www.tradingview.com/x/XEtxDdbf/) to the downside which is extremely bearish. This likely set precedent for the next major market cycle. Months more of bear market unfortunately.

This little pump is just a minor correction before heading down further.
We were already expecting a quick bump to retest at about 6.9k, maybe 7k. So this doesn't change the outlook, unfortunately
Ask McAfee
IMO the only catalyst on the horizon for that would include a perfect storm of tether getting sorted out one way or another, regulatory clarity, and a rush to tokenize securities (10\-40 trillion dollar market that would actually benefit from blockchain). The growth phase of this market where the value of everything is speculative without a use case is fizzling out. Furthermore, the lower it goes the more people will realize that the speculative value of all the utility tokens probably vastly outweigh any real world value (how valuable is it to track the authenticity of a luxury purse, how much money is going to be allocated to track manufacturing components \- not much more than currently, there is a bottom line to meet).

The only currency that makes sense is BTC because it is secured by the nethash and built on miles of code, but that won't come to fruition until LN is real. What you are left with are BTC with second layer solutions, some measly utility token projects, and token generating machines which will end up broken up into POS, DPOS, and POW which will probably lead to a split between decentralized mining economy and centralized corporate block producers.

No one is rushing in to buy this stuff, its like 2am and someone turned on the lights at the bar and everyone has to admit what is really going on here.
I am confident it will happen this year.
So you aren't sure if the probability is 0% or 75%?   You really are confused about the odds.

I would put it at 35% probability, and that is perhaps being generous.
I'm guessing 85% chance of 10k, 60% chance of 20k, and 40% chance of 50k.  A bitcoin ETF will likely arrive this year, and this may provide the catalyst for bitcoin to break out of its wedge.
No. The speculative era of crypto is over. The market cap will bleed out until *legitimate and profitable use cases* emerge, and the whole thing will ramp up again. Assets like Ethereum, VeChain, Iota and their partnerships will lead the way into the next era. 
Would've completely rekt you here:

Looking at the Weekly BTCUSDSHORTS, I think shorts can still pile up significantly before we see a squeeze. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/EwXJTPFR/

I should add that the ratio of longs/short is still over 1, meaning more coins are long than short for the moment.
Yes just a manipulated bear trap.  All kinds of games are played and this is the one area where regulation would actually be good.
Whilst I agree this will go further, this is nonsense logic

There will always be positive people here, even if it drops to $1k, coupled with the fact that the sample size of this sub is a joke 
Everyone and their grandma is prolly short right now. Max pain is not down if you ask me.

Edit: To add more substance, shorts are at 24k. One month high. 
It is good that everyone can remain cheerful in the face of adversity. 
Probably also worth noting that alts are still selling pretty heavily, and I'd imagine it's not much of a stretch to assume most of the sells go into fiat, while buyers are probably less likely to be buying Bitcoin for their buys right here and now. At some point (likely soon) supply there will dry up, which will reduce the selling pressure.
agreed around $6,400 is as low as it can go before people panic.
Shorts were like 38k before the 'BGD' , I think we are a long long way off any potential Squeeze
They were over 40k when we had our short squeeze... and longs still outpace shorts so...
Seems to me like the longer bull/bear flags draw out without continuation, the more likely it is to "Bart" in the opposite direction.  

EDIT: But with the RSI so low across the board, it seems plausible this break is just allowing it to reset some before another leg down
Take a look at the precedent drop from the 8k levels, it took about 5 days from 8230 to 7100. Are these two situation similar ?
Last time we had 40k shorts at $6750 and we did have a short squeeze of 16k shorts, causing the price to go to $8000 in 1 day with 24k shorts left. However, right now we "only" have 24k shorts, presumably some at a decent (higher) price as well. So while there could be a bounce, I wouldn't bet on a short squeeze.
I could bet that at least 80% of shorts have SL above 7.2. That would need a lot of buying pressure.
Scroll down and see why we are basically beating a dead horse.
800 point drop yesterday and you think bears are in a position where they are anxious to close?  Dust hasnt even settled yet to think about a bull case beyond the meme of buy the dip.
Short squeeze to where? 7k? Sure. Consider that shorting is extremely cheap right now and consider that longing is expensive and most are underwater coupled with decreasing spot buy interest. Continued dump is much more likely.
It dropped almost $1000 in 2 days and still no rebound. A lot of longs are still opened. I'm guessing if it stuck at 6k7 for the next 8 hours, then we will see another hard drop.
IMO Bitmain (&Co) farms can keep running till a very low price. It might make it harder for their (new / smaller) competition though, which would only make their monopoly position stronger. So overall I believe bitcoin will be fine, but it might be bad for the decentralization of mining as only the bigger players will continue.

Personally I am too lazy to do math (based on difficulty, S9/other hashrate/power, estimated electricity prices, etc) - because I don't think it matters. For me the proof is the halving, mining continued just fine even though the reward got halved overnight (and in theory a lower price happens more gradually with a lagging but lower difficulty too.)
under 5k even industrial mining in non Crisis Countrys like Venezuela will be not profitable any more.

Different timescales, they're talking about on the daily scale going back to February's drop. Requires cutting some wicks but it's a logical place for it to pause to see if bulls are going to make a stand here.
We did not go under 6k in January when all the newbs were legit panicking. We did not go there in April despite all the gloating from bears at that time (go back and read some of the dailies). Somebody dumps a bunch of coins on a Sunday during the lowest volume of the week, obviously not trying to get the best price, just trying to dump it down. What makes you think we'll go sub-6K now? I don't know, maybe that guy has a whole bunch more coins to sell, but it's obvious manipulation of the type that's been tried many, many times on our march from zero to thousands of dollars. 

Sheesh. Do these guys really think we haven't seen this before? Do they really think there are that many weak hands who will freak out and sell? If so, they're wrong.
I think at this point it's either a triple bottom or a bear flag. Time will tell. Odds are likely it's a bear flag. 
Which one?
Short term down trends are rarely significant IMO. Watching them the past several weeks/months, they get violated and re-entered all the time. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/iRFarXU4/
when the trend is down sideways is bad
I forget the math, but yes - horizontals are commonly recognized as being much stronger than diagonal support/resistance lines.  Fib line retracements are a really good indication of this on macro scales.
literally supply and demand.  

its a level where there is a lot of liquidity, market on the graph being the Y axis, i.e. 6k has been a price where market sentiment thought btc was cheap relative to that time.

I have alot in my brain about diagonals vs horizontal but cant seem to get it out rn. But yes. Horizontals are more significant because they actually represent a price. 


When you see only what you want to see, it makes sense that you'll like it.
Then why don't you sell all of your bags and short the fuck out of it?
Do u mean higher highs? 
I’m confused wouldn’t that mean we will likely go down 
[deleted]
I think that there have been plenty of thoughtful shorting posts the last few months.

But yes, there are plenty of crap posts both bull and bear. But hey, its the internet. 
What are you talking about? Plenty of people have been talking about going short. We longs have our reasons for going long, and we're entitled to our informed opinions. I am 4/5 on my last five trades, all long, and I'm up on my current long. Maybe you might do well to listen to longs' logic instead of staring at your chart hoping some dummy will dump a bunch of coins. Because that's what this is - some dummy selling a fuckton of Bitcoin. It's not a panic. Investors are still buying. Some of us have buys set at lower levels which we would be happy to see filled.

Historically, shorting Bitcoin is a great way to lose money and not a very good way to make money. Just sayin'.
I am hurting bad.. so I am not saying this to be a smart ass but I doubt it.
> A month of sideways

It was only 2.5 weeks.  But that's like 4 months in crypto time. 
Insignificantly a lot of people lost a lot of money on that break down.
They’re allowing time for hope. Hope of a triple bottom. 

Nothing causes more pain than seeing your last hope crushed before your very eyes. 

That triple bottom is the last hope bulls have left. They’re hovering here for a reason. 

We may even have a fake back up with a bart, before resuming the doom. 
Looks pretty significant with a lot of potential more downside to me? I am a TA noob though, so let me know if I am missing something.
Always... exchange hacks or more restrictive gov't regulations.  
the parabolic rise.  A lot of whales with 1000+ BTC.  They will take 10 million instead of 0 in a true panic.  




If Trump and Kim-Jong end up hugging and pop the champagne and white doves fly around. Geopolitical stability is anathema for Bitcoin 
I highly doubt that, as none of the legacy economy news/reports had an effect on BTC in the past (GDP, unemployment, house sales, PMI... you name it). 
that is not a falling wedge.
That's not a wedge?
A falling wedge should have the bottom trendline sloping down also.
Yes, the bull run will start with Father’s Day. 
Lots a dads getting BTC this year and it will put consensus, Chinese New Year and Wall Street bonuses to shame
hasnt really been any for a while, doesn't stop people from clinging to bullish hope though
This last drop could've been a huge bear trap before the bull run. I mean, there's a chance right?
triple bottom hopium is still on the table.
Maybe we'll see an inverted Bart soon.
You don't need hopium when you're a bull, just time. I'm looking to buy at 6500, but if I weren't already Bitcoin rich, I'd be buying now just to make sure I didn't miss this tasty dip.
Mood is still pretty positive in the sub
This has been a problem for some time now. Buyers are buying the dip like crazy and then just let it go thinking the price will go up by itself.
Aren't you supposed to be the guy who's always uber bullish whatever happens? 
> Just because bitcoin will probably be 4k sometime within the next year doesn't mean you should short at 6.6k 

But...that means one of these times it will be profitable. Considering we have been here 3 times now it's probably as good a time as any to short if you believe it's going to 4k this year. 

> Patience wins

Yea, but you can't be patient forever. You have to act eventually. Shorting now would mean you waited three times over 4 months to short sub $7k. At this point being patient is very possibly a great way to miss out. 

I mean, that's if it goes lower of course. But if anyone believes it's going lower, there's not much of a better  time to short
If we do a 6k style bottom it could be 4k within a week or so. So yes, I would say short this breakdown of the trianlge like a mofo. Personally, I increased leverage to bring liquidation to like 7600 and added 500k

Plan is still to close some at 6200 and 5400 and let a hedge ride as low as we go
Yeah, that was like a refreshing walk in the park with a cooling autumn breeze yesterday. Healthy./s
Cool be sure to post your 100% long then man
[deleted]
fundamentals have never been better then they are now, if you were in btc before then your statement doesnt make any sense
Another signal to buy? 
Capitulation!
Yo! 15 downvotes already. The reason why you're losing money. Only open to what you like to hear. Moon! Lambo! lmao. At this point in tech, 5000 is a rasable price for BTC, 200 for ETH and much, much more for one or two alts that are useable. Now downvote and go on with your circle jerk.
What do you suggest?
Don't get the downvotes. Technically you're right, but those targets don't always play out. If this triangle broke at 11k then going down to 5k wouldn't be a problem, but now getting to 3k seems a bit unlikely.
or another [step down](https://www.tradingview.com/x/C042Zftz) the stairs 
We don't need to do anything 
Are you speculating or are you suggesting you have insider info? 
username checks out 
name checks out. 
what a wonderful news for bitcoin. current bear cycle started exactly same day when cme/cboe launched
I kind of hope you are right.
So in your opinion, would the price plummet if/when that news breaks or would the price shoot up?
Any idea what the total open interest of BTC on CME/CBOE fututres is?  Just 8&#37; of all leveraged positions, so fake and insignificant news. Have fun, keep trolling!

Open Interest is 5,618 positions          

LONG: 1,455      

SHORT: 3,915 
Not sure whether you are a delusional permabull or just paid by whales to spread reverse FUD
Lol yeah okay dude, how's those other underwater longs doing?

Even if you did you'll probably close at a loss like your other trades and remain silent like you always do.
Good luck to you and your delusions!  :))
You dont always need a event that triggers something. More people sell then buy, more people think this will go lower then higher. 
Done, 1.000$ drop.

When the price went to 20k, the fees and confirmation times were insanely high. The price still went up because too many people threw in their life savings trying to become millionaires. In hindsight, the growth was obviously unsustainable. If LN were to trigger another huge bull run, it would've already happened. 
lol is there a reason to post this every day
You keep posting this shit every day but yet you fail to provide any proof you are actually short since 15k. Makes you wonder... 
Why are there so many glory hunters on this sub? When they make a prediction and it goes right they immediately want praise for making the call. When it goes wrong it's total silence.
TBH shorting since 12k-20k has been easy for me as well. But not because of fundamentals but simply because every average Joe with no clue about crypto was buying it to get rich quick. That is not sustainable and that is why a bear market was inevitable. Price went up 10x in a few months, obviously it will go down - has nothing to do with any bitcoin development progress. Predicting the exact top and bottom is difficult though.
lol... You realize lightning base protocol is done.

They’re just building features at this point and fixing bugs as they come up.

You are misinformed my friend
Releasing Lightning on main net bears some similarity to the "Mission Accomplished" announcement of Pres. Bush back in May 1, 2003.
LOLOLOL
What's your next entry at
> it's dead jim. everyone and their mother knows this shit is a ponzi!

>However I'm bullish on BTC super long term, i think as we're moving towards more of a digital world

lol wat
Funny, I have you labeled as a bcash shill. Do you actually think retarded posts like this help your cause?

Lmfao. Anyone who thinks it's a ponzi scheme doesn't understand crypto. Go do some research 
The downvotes represent the denial of the bulls here. :D 
Why would they disclose such info except for manipulation?
I hear this more often lately and in some cases it has been confirmed scam attempts (see [this news article](https://news.bitcoin.com/how-an-otc-bitcoin-scammer-almost-stole-600-million/).) So TBH I don't believe those stories anymore.
RemindMe! 30 hours
> I know this is a meme now but the institutional money is coming. There is a lot of work going on now to make it possible. Custody problem is being worked on and the SEC have said it's not a security. Another ETF been filed. Honestly believe the second half of 2018 will be different to the first. We will then be 18 months away from the halving which is a bullish time looking back. Selling now honestly does feel like giving into fear.

This time it's different !!!!
based on 500 BTC volume? bulls need to spend a bit more to reverse this
Too early to say.
Right, gotta see the lifespan of bitcoin represented as a 3D mountain range...... Put this shit in a video game! or something neat!!!!  WHY AM I SO EXCITED OVER A MOUNTAIN REPRESENTATION OF A GRAPH!!!!???? 
One day I want a 3D printed (or metal somehow) thing that basically is a really thin sheet of material going around in a spiral up and down representing the history of bitcoin price. I bet it would look cool as some kind of centerpiece or something 
Somebody screw up the months, hit sell instead of buy and price dropped...
If you look at the chart, the first spike (8K to 19K) was when the price moved up. The second spike (19K to 26K) was when the price moved down. *Then* it went off the cliff. 
Why's that? It's prudent to remember that the charts were not filled out at that time..
The low at that point was what, $9k? 

So shorts started adding at $10900 down to $10200 and up to $12k. $10200 was 13% above the lowest low, $6700 is 13% above the lowest low ($5900).

Considering shorts started adding 10% up from here, it's really not too different so far. 

$12k is 33% above $9k, guess what's 33% above $5.9k?

:p $7850

My point isn't that it will happen again but that there's no precedent for shorts always being squeezed. It's a 50/50 thing now 
Yes, top chart is shorts. They went from 8000 btc worth of shorts to 26000 worth of shorts from $10950 to $12100. keep in mind 26000 shorts at $12100 is nearly 50000 shorts at this price level in terms of equivalent nominal value. 

what I'm pointing out is that shorts piled the fuck on...300% increase in 6 days. And...no short squeeze.. In fact, the price literally cut in half over the next few days. 

50% from $12000 to $6000. 

to people who don't really understand margin trading:

What you're looking at is an example of where someone or a lot of people bet a LOT of money on the price going down...and oh boy did it go down. 50% decrease in 8 days. 

The most recent time people bet a lot of money on price going down they were very wrong and got stopped out of their positions. 

What I'm pointing out is that success rate for shorts when they increase parabolically is basically 50/50.. So don't be too sure of anything 
but now bears short local lows and get cocky!
Are you saying the world can run out of idiots?
yeah typo, obviously meant 6.4 (our previous bottom basicly)
Because certainly for people who don't trade regularly, the gains made from selling now and buying at say 5 or 6k later do not balance out the stress of missing a potential bullrun and FOMOing in at 10k. Basically, to an inexperienced trader, the potential pain is not worth the potential gain.
Taxes are a good reason.
Not really, other assets aren't basically 100% speculative

A company's stock could easily tank or pump depending on a singular piece of news
Yeah, but I can see a lot of times it's true.  i.e. GE released 3rd quarter earnings, much less than expected.

On any given Sunday some ico launches, some exchange is hacked, etc etc, but when you look at the charts you can see a move was coming far before that one thing happened.
Can we stop perpetuating the mining cost price floor myth? Miners won't "stop selling" at any price, they will stop mining. Under no circumstance will a miner keep mining at a loss to hoard coins that could be *bought cheaper than mined*. It doesn't make sense. [More here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8pyf8i/daily_discussion_sunday_june_10_2018/e0ggxbn/)
We need to go deeper to induce FOMO.. 5k is the we’re fucked number, lower than that is the OMG we must buy numbers

Edit: If we go back to 8k than it’s a new game but I’m obviously delusional because we are not at the bottom
Lol what? You have no idea what you’re talking about. There is no special price that all the miners will sell at. 
I was thinking that this is accumulation. Yesterday's candle looks like a toe after a selloff. I've seen this same visual before the market rallies. Maybe it won't this time, but there is also a bollinger squeeze and chances are good for a rally IMHO. 
Or we can just redraw this triangle on every new low, and if we get lower low it'll be descending wedge.
That's a big potential dynamic here, IMHO. A lot of big whales new to the space are patient, understand this market is illiquid and emotional, and really, really would hate to miss the chance to load up on BTC when it's sub-6K.
as long as we're above our last low, we're just forming a new higher low.
As long as the price doesn't go too far below $1200 and stay there, there will likely be another order of magnitude\+ increase in bitcoin's value before end of 2022.
If it goes down to 3K and stabilizes, it's still up almost 5x what it was at the beginning of 2017.  That's the bull narrative.


Just wait until these guys have to buy back the coins they borrowed from Mr. Kobayashi over the weekend. The candle up will be twice as big as the one down.
Agreed. I think a rally starting from 6k to 6.3k is likely. Could hit 6.7k or even 7k before goblin town. 
When sentiment is poor (or lots of uncertainty) for the big dogs (BTC/ETH mostly), alts tend to bleed no matter which direction they go.

For example, when BTC was slowly rising to 7800 - alts bled.  When the bottom dropped out, they also bled.  When the recovery begins, they will continue to bleed for a while until sentiment changes.

Then, when sentiment does change, alts explode.

At least, that's what I've observed.

It's understandable, really.  Not much buying pressure for most alts when the entire sphere is contracting.  However, still plenty (if not huge, at least consistent) of sell pressure as people go alt -> btc/eth -> fiat.

Edit:  That being said, I've been slowly picking up small amounts of promising alts.  When they move, they move very quickly.

BTC is the king of crypto, but keeping an eye on other coins can often give clues when movements are stalling or picking up steam. 
The was sort of the canary in the mine for me as well as I was looking for entering some alts on Binance but I ignored and then as OP said, everything happened so quickly when I didn't have access to trading so here I am. I'm looking at mid March lows on alts and might pick some up
Yeah, at $4K-$5K. We had a massive bull run that re-demonstrated the asset's ability to go parabolic. Now buyers can purchase over 60% below the top, and there's no interest. I think we should return to 2016-2017 channel, which should now put us somewhere between $4K-$5K.
I haven't moved that downward channel in quite a while, as you can see. I'm not a huge fan of redrawing channels once they break just to make them fit. If we break out of a channel and form a new one in a new direction, I'll draw that one. Or if a channel turns to a wedge or vice versa. My downward channel has been invalidated, but I left it on the chart. Yours has too, IMO. Right now we don't really have a lot worth charting on the smaller time frames. A 10% 4-hour move invalidates a lot of patterns.
A definite possibility, and one I mentioned in my post yesterday. We could slide down it for the rest of June/July before hitting the long-term channel top as support, reversing around 4800. We'll see. 
From trading yes. Im not trading anymore.

I think I had only one trade that I closed in profit since we broke the ATH log downtrend line at 8500

That would he my queue to stop trading. Lost 1 BTC all-in-all
Place your bet
I think so too, but that probably means it’s going down
I guess we'll know soon.  It's butting up against the 7.6k downtrend line ceiling now, plus it's quite oversold even up to the 1D time frame.  I'm just going to stay out and keep scaling out my trading stacks though unless we go on quite a clear uptrend again.
Target of that triangle was 5k drop. I'm surprised we dropped only 500 after break down.
Don't think he'll take this as putting pressure on him.

Asking publicly as he has a lot of experience in previous drops and couple of others here would like to hear him out.

Dude learn how to encourage others to learn..
I’m not charting on ~~stamp~~ Finex Another hour candle or 2 and we should we touching it 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/doCXNsNf/
A run from here to 8k would be more than peculiar after breaking out of our large triangle.
I think a lot of people just don't know about that.

It's always better to set stops just above liq price than let it get liquidated.
I do agree , especially with bitmain releasing their new miner in a couple of months 
You are no idiot.   You are just aces in my book.    

I wish I bought when I first started watching bitcoin when it was 200$.
Same here man. I’m going down with the ship if that’s where we’re going, but I’ll take my chances and bet that Bitcoin will be worth a lot more the coming decades than it is now.
Yeah, I'm not sure what all this talk of "capitulation" and "bag holding" is about. Historically, bears are the ones who capitulate, and those bags feel pretty good. I don't see anything to indicate that this time is any different, except that $6000 is considered cheap. This feels a lot like mid-2015 to me, and we all know what happened after that months-long bottom.
How does it feel to be an electronical millionaire ?
Fuck.
wow you are already talking about the next halving, it isn't till 2020 and the last one was in 2017

If 500 breaks on ETH i'll probably short it again, with tight stops and moving stops down with the price because when it bounces it should bounce hard as shorts start closing. Until then the most i'll do is small scalp trades with very tight stops.
Not leading, but it can make the difference when it comes to deciding moments in BTC. 
If ETH drops 10% i'm not seeing BTC staying stable or rising. It might just drop 2 or 3% but that drop could be enough to make BTC break support and make the difference
Daily, going back to February.
Right, I see it . . https://www.tradingview.com/x/mi5FvoAh/
Also cutting the April wicks?
Black line . . . https://www.tradingview.com/x/mi5FvoAh/
That's a no-go on Bitstamp but if you include wicks your model is GOOD 4 dates with Nov 15, Feb 5, April 7 and today. That's Bitstamp.
There is another, a diagonal one. And I do see the horizontal if you see my other chart, thank you.
about to fall.
Orange line makes this a descending triangle with a very high likelihood of breaking down further. Not really much of a hopium line.
Good job on that! Interesting that it's pumped up to around the same price it was when you discovered this. I thought about trying to snoop around their site to discover these clues, but I guess this proves that you won't necessarily make big money that way even if you do discover the next listing. Might as well just buy when the news becomes public.

That said, got any tips on the next listing after ETC? haha
Good job dude.  That's the way to do it.   
Binance isn't coinbase.  13$ ETC gonna look real good to the noobs who thought LTC was cheap.
But see Gemini's recent addition of ZEC

As real as Caitlyn Jenner’s Vagina 
Yes
I am not sure BTC will allow me this closure :( Thanks for the kind words
You mean the chance this fall *is* a bear trap (and we're gonna go up)?

I honestly think that the quick accumulation at 6k's, dump at 9k's, low volume rally at 7k's, distribution at 7.5k, then a huge dump breaking the meme triangle just tell us one coherent story.. Even if we rally to 7300, I would bet that is a bear trap.

We need a long consolidation in a very low price range, just as in 2014 for a new bull run to start, IMO
But if you have to watch McAfee eat his dick on something less than 4k, is it even worth it?

#\#dickeatingmasterrace
You've put entirely too much thought into this.
and he's still up 18x after all of this. Christ...
Well I mean...I started late...
That could mean he intends to hold long term. 
user name checks out
I'm in that boat, except bigger. I don't consider myself down since my BTC balance hasn't dropped.
I'm going to be finding a job soon. Partly because I've run out of hobbies and things to do and I'm getting bored out of my mind. not working and doing whatever I want is not at all like what I expected. Working is actually good for mental health.
ahhahahaha
Why would you sell at 3k? That's silly. Also being a holder means not allowing crypto to control your life. Trading is full time high stress that degrades your quality of life. When you're on your death bed you won't be wishing you spent more time glued to a screen watching charts.
I did quite well, I had a relatively large following as well. 
I suppose it could, anything is possible.

For now, the volume profile doesnt really fit an inverse H&S though. There should be higher volume at the shoulders and lower volume at the head.

It looks like what we're seeing here is contracting volume for the most part, which matched up with the symmetrical triangle we were in and would also match up with a descending triangle if we were to even get there.
Yeah, you could make a strong argument both ways and I would agree 100%.  I'm afraid to keep my short open due to FUD but also FOMO keeps it open.  Maybe I'll close half...
We'll likely get another with the funding pump in the next 40 minutes.
EDIT; sorry read that too fast, thought ya were coming at me hott for not providing technicals....

.

Here is a chart then.... read into it as ya will....https://imgur.com/a/Uf1HkGs

It is clear we broke through a local trendline, not exactly good.... Would have liked to close out within that triangle and bounced off 7.1k range...  actually closed a short there expecting we would...


So now we are looking to see if we break down past lower lows.

You can see the bots all chipping away doing the typical psychological fuck you fake outs over and over again, just set alarms and dont watch the orderbook folks.

If we create a new low for the year, then yes, its totally on the table for an ultra breakdown to real real lows none of us want.  But again, its a pay attention kinda week.... might drag on too, if we start too gain momentum up then we are repeating history so to speak, making a nice big ole W....

This is sorta what happened last time we made a big ole nice W.... refer to my chart here... https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/mgXWO870-Itchy-Craphole-s-chart/
We don't have to worry about people who opened in the last 8 months get shaken out. We have to worry about folks who bought before that getting shaken out. 
Just curious if you did not set a stop?  The breakdown from 7.5k is pretty significant from the sideway slightly upward trend starting almost 2 weeks ago.  Sorry to hear about your loss and I hope you can recover at some point.

edit: oops meant to reply to the OP (/u/xygo)
A close lower than the open of that green would invalidate it.
When you say longs are stagnant how do you know it isn't people closing and relonging lower? It doesn't need to be stubborn longs severely underwater, after every red candle you have the BTFD crowd coming out of the woodwork. I think we can experience max pain and yet have the number of longs pretty stable.
Bro, how long have you been trading, if you don't mind me asking? Your depth is on another level
Alright, thanks for taking the time to reply! As long as the Bitcoin I sent ends up arriving in my BitMEX account I'll definitely try and be more rational with my trades. You make good points, too, I guess it was more of a fallacy than anything to assume that.
Where can I check the longs/shorts ratio please?
> Literally any point, pick a point, long 2.5x there. Not liquidated. 

The problem is people don't hold those positions as they approach getting liquidated. If this is someone's entire BTC stack or even just their trading stack at risk here, they will most likely get shaken out of their positions by those dips regardless of liquidation.
Stellar
At about... $8300. It's not that big a position, so I don't mind so long as we stay above $6600 until July 1st. 
RSI being low doesn't necessarily mean we should see a bounce, sometimes we just need to move sideways for awhile to reset things. Also keep in mind, rsi is currently very sensitive due to the sideways action we went through for the past few weeks 
I'm starting to think that so many people expect this to happen that it might just drop down from here.
Why would we head down? Seems like only one guy is selling based on that quick dump yesterday with no follow-through.
Honestly, I think this is more probable to break down than up. But, I strongly believe that the R/R is worth it here. I’m willing to take a 1.5% loss or so since I’ve been trading fairly decently as of late. Plus I have a Short opened up around 7200 so it makes some sense to hedge myself imo
Yeah he even admits the probability is more likely to break down. Not sure he understands r/r or if he miscommunicated or something 
Thanks for the advice
Right on. It's ironic really. I put 300 in amd  stock and it's up 25%. I put 4k in bitcoin and it's down...a bit. 
The business side of me says buy more and reinforce my position. The personal side says don't throw more money in. Ah the life of the casual investor.
[Relevant](https://i.imgur.com/c4jt321.png)
Oh hey its the "ehhh fuck it, going long here " guy when we were at 7600! You were my strong sell signal thank you!

[Reason you should be cautious following this guy's advise](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ontzj/comment/e06nbn5)
There is also the [BTC NVT Signal](http://charts.woobull.com/bitcoin-nvt-signal/) which is more or less the same thing. 
I don't know where you're lurking because I have not seen anybody mention 7800. I think 6800 is the goal for now.

I 100% with you on the latter point. 
What should that chart be screaming at me?
Too early to say.
Debatable. Our 4H candle just closed above resistance.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/VbEInEfP/
Bitmex too, and BFX.
You would be surprised about how long the US banking and regulation arm can reach. I doubt they would do anything about exchanges outside the US but one thing they could do is make it hard on the banks that back these exchanges if they do any business with US banks or US dollars, which they probably do. 
But how about the subpoenaed exchanges? Mex is just an offshore casino.
Regardless seeing that bear pennant break up makes me think there is a little bit of juice in this bounce left.  Very well could be wrong but given that I wouldn't short (or long) here I'm gonna take the 30% boost to my trading stack that I waited underwater for 2 weeks to get.
> We just saw the selling climax, which happens at the beginning of accumulation

Doesn't selling climax occur at THE bottom? I personally think we have a long way to go. The change of hands hasn't really occurred from holders / underwater longs to the whales
I was with you and thought about it a lot in the mid 6700's. That higher low after third attempt at 6.6 bounced was the time to close. Also went ahead and just closed out the rest of my short here, basically because I wouldn't reopen a short here.
[deleted]
beautiful
Thanks for the confirmation :D
LMAO, you are so funny, really! Upvoted for the effort
vomiting camel confirmed
Well, sold one of my cars today and got fiat cash. I was thinking... what the hell do I do with fiat, that is normally used in crime scenes, money laundering and to deal drugs. Also the risk of counterfeit bills made me worried. I quickly converted USD to BTC :D
shit, shrimpy was a mistake of a scale I didn't think was possible, and my limit sell didn't trigger
Definitely seems like it. I wouldn't be surprised if we do bottom around 6k. I think that's currently break even for many miners which I think is where BTC usually bottoms out around. We may range around 6k and go as low as 5k but I think around there is a good place to buy long term.
Looks like a good base is forming.
Target should be 4.5k. 
> Seems like when one things gets invalidated, something new pops up.

always another line to draw
That's how TA works. Every day is a new day. After BGD people would kill for 7.5 entry. Today that 7.5 entry got rekt.
Press sell with the intention of buying more later = you are now shorting dude :)
I'm of the opinion that we'll get a squeeze off our February low around 5800 up to test our April low as resistance around 6400. Longs will pile on to the Feb 6 repeat only to get hulk smashed downwards for maximum pain. We'll see. 
>Ripple effects

I see what you did there
I know. I’ve put my fair share of trading posts here the past few months and I’ve seen some book recommendations tossed around here and there so i figured I would ask. 

To add, there is a fairly large number of smart/educated individuals in here that read avidly so getting their 2 cents wouldn’t be the worst idea.

I’ll check out that book, thank you! 
Actually tore something in my shoulder doing a golf drill on Friday. Pretty fucking salty about it considering the weather here is going to be nice the next week.

Now, i just sit inside with my cock in my hand not knowing what to do 
smart
Better to look at what areas are going to be least negatively affected by climate change. Parts of the north east US are probably only going to get wetter, which isn't such a bad thing (upstate NY, Vermont, Mass). Scandinavia is another good bet. 
I'm a scientist and as cool as CRISPR is it isn't going to lead to new treatments any time soon.  It is a lab tool for genetic investigation. Don't buy the hype.
thanks 🙏 
That’s the opposite of a buy signal...
Time to short?
Hey remember your bet on the VXX? hAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHSHAHAHAHAHAGAVAGAGAGAGAGAGAGGAGAHAHAHAHAHA. You really screwed the pooch on that one. 
I mean, I’m HODLing all my coins, but I’ve got some fiat that I wanna invest into something.

Been looking for long-term HODLs in vintage and rare watches, but it’s hard to find something worth while.

Was thinking of buying an old car maybe... maybe some land
You mean the old log resistence ( 20k->17k->11.7k)? 
5k would be the first time i would consider putting in more fiat since 10 months... but we shall see
Oh yeah, rings a bell now, thanks. I wonder if things would have panned out differently if we hit 10,000 instead of 9,999. 
What log resistance?
It is in their TOS that they can ban you and take your assets
Literally wrote 7k haha
To be fair, that's not what he said.  I don't even disagree with what he said, I wouldnt be surprised at an attempt to squeeze the shorts. 

It's getting very annoying though because like you said, we're right back where we started. if it happens again i cant see *anyone* being happy. All that means is some big player made a bunch of money off the rest of us. 

Short squeezes with no follow through are literally just a waste of time and money for most people

I can totally see us going above $7k and wasting more time there because this market is so stubborn. It would be incredibly annoying and frustrating though 
I'm just tired of seeing short squeeze today. Seems like less people reading the thread to see if their .02 is just the same two pennies
Well done to you
Well said 
Not sure what you’re talking about my wigger
I live in US. I can't short. Maybe bitmex?, but risky
Google parabolic retrace
Made my night. 

don't forget diydude opened a short at $9800 😜


My guess is a test of 7k-7.25k
Yeah but most of them would’ve prudently been stopped out or closed sooner for better risk management
Longing 7.2-7.3 was great R/R as the support was right below it. Going without stops on this one was a bit stupid.
Most in the US use Bitmex with a VPN for registration
Thank you. You just gave me a buy pre-signal.
> in the US btw

You are limited to CME or CBOE then I think.
So what significance?
Yup for the same reasons whales can't induce fomo or why barts stopped working as well, you can only fool people so many times until they catch on.
Yep the sensible play here is to reduce leverage and stake as we go lower, adding a tight stop loss as there's less room to fall.

The time to bang your big short in was $10k.

Likewise, the lower we go, the better the r:r is for a big long, obviously.
I know right!?
Why wouldn’t it go there?  Think about it the sentiment is getting incredibly negative as time goes on, people are becoming very impatient. It’s been months now since any sign of true growth. I think if we don’t go up immediately soon then we could see a huge sell off. I broke even and sold everything at 9.8k and I’ve been sitting in usdt since. I’m very wary to invest in anything crypto related right now to be completely honest. 
Because confidence that it will return to ATH anytime soon continues to drop with each of those bounces as we have not seen a strong bullish sign for 6 months
The large, historical 1h candle that propelled us from $6800 to $8000

It means big green dildo, for the uncanny resemblance a large green candle on candle charts has to a big green dildo. 
Cuz we just broke down. Market isnt bouncing. Bear flag. Momentum will accelerate.
Bart up for what?
Fair enough. 
Of course. 
Well we reach the bottom when speculators lose interest. This place is still full of speculators
Some of us are long-term investors who trade a little for fun. That's why we're not despairing and most probably just looking for the optimal spot to buy.
Speak for yourself.
>7.2

7.2k was not the res line, more like 7040 or so
Isn't that what I said? ;)

Will be surprised if this touches 7k.
Seems to be working
Yeah Possible, but it's an great chance of averaging your buys even if it goes a few hundred down again. (i'am thinking in Monthly buys right now until next bubble)
Lots of jealous haters out there who think they missed the boat.  It is what it is.
Yes, I have been calling 7k the long term price point and 300 moves are well within my idea of the random movement 
I for one would not trade on lines that are built on 2 wicks

Especially not one that is 2k in length 
Why would companies put their stock at the mercy of Bitcoin and its manipulators in form of security tokens?
60% for $20k is way too high...I would put it at maybe 5%.  They year is half over.

$50K this year has to be maybe 1% odds.
I slightly agree with your projections, I’m a little more conservative, but I feel that bottom is soon and we have nowhere to go but up. 
You're only getting downvoted because of the recent price action lmaoooo
What probability is that?   Not 100%.

And BTC % of the market is about 39% and not really dropping lately during these selloffs.  So the other coins are not taking market share away BTC, but of course that is eventually inevitable, just like Google and Microsoft will not reign supreme forever.  They will fade just like AT&T and GE did.
You forgot /s
RSI my dude. Overbought and oversold are RSI terms. Not raw volume.
32k longs. Not everyone is short right now...
32k longs > 24k shorts

Max pain  <----------
The volume also was different at that time. With anemic volume, Barting up can yield stops easy.
They were fake shorts, just a bunch of wash traded shorts 
Yep thats fair... shorts outnumbered longs that time and was about 38K in total. If current short\-sell trend continues, we will have same situation around July 10th 
Look at the RSI on the daily well over 70.  This is only the 3rd time since futures started. The first time the shorts were only 500 more than they are now. 
Fair enough, I am just judging from the RSI on the charts and the sentiment in every forum I am in that everyone is predicting the end and the money they have made and will continue to make on shorts.  So it's all conjecture by me and not a ton of TA to back it up.
The shorts before that big pump were all wash trade shorts fyi, like what we saw before August 1st, the squeeze was fake.
You're probably right but the volume is really low right now and it would take a concerted push but multiple people but it wouldn't be the first time multiple people have conspired in a stop hunting expedition and we know how people panic in either direction.  It only takes a small flame to start the wick.
Still getting upvoted, feels like I'm taking crazy pills'd
Bitmex future premiums turned negative, Bitfinex margin shorts and btc interest rates are in parabolic rise. I think this makes this last fall very artificial (not enough real sellers but shorters). If not enough real sellers come, this will end up with short squeeze. I am not sure on what price it will happen. Maybe after slow rise to 7.5K.

That's incorrect. It costs less than $1k to mine a bitcoin in Venezuela so even below 5k those miners would have a huge profit margin. On the other hand it costs above $20k to mine a bitcoin in South Korea and people are still mining there.   
   
Source: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2018/02/15/the-cheapest-and-most-expensive-countries-to-mine-bitcoin.html
>under 5k even industrial mining in non Crisis Countrys like Venezuela will be not profitable any more.

Yeah this. For me in the UK sub 6k and mine get turned off. Even though in China for example it's 5k I imagine the infrastructure and maintenance involved makes it more like 6\-7k.

It's why I have a hard time believing we'll be sub 7k for long as the miners are essential for bitcoin. They stop, bitcoin stops.

Sure, difficulty can step down but there's a lag in doing so.
Agreed 100 percent.  Too many cannot separate investment from trading, they cannot view the charts objectively.  They look for things in the charts to confirm their view instead of trying to understand what the chart is telling them.  But really most people are just not cut out for trading because of this point blank, they are actually the dumb money though it's 'mean' for experienced traders to say so, the gentlemanly thing to do is take their money away by letting their hubris lead to self implosion, it's how the successful traders eventually learn anyways.  Usually the hubris from easy money liquidates these so called traders before they get a chance to learn.
Mods have been trying to walk a tightrope of keeping quality up but not being totalitarian about it. For a while they were too heavy-handed for the subs' liking and now maybe it's just calibration back.
God thank you for this, took the words right out of my mouth!
[deleted]
So what's your next trading move?  It seems to me right now that it's equally likely to go down as it is to go up.
Really well said! I only just discovered this sub and, it's been refreshing to see some bears. People like you are what makes this sub amazing :)
tbh its needs more consolidation before it can start to look like a tripple bottom. The daily just broke down and is currently below the lower bollinger band giving us some support atm and the RSI is 30 ish but the bands are signaling a clear breakdown from resistance as is the MACD which just turned negative. The daily could also look like a descending wedge ish.
delete
You’re exactly who they’re targeting to break with this next phase of the bear market. 
You think 6K is a magical number or something? You don't believe in extended DCB's and descending triangles? You think volume looks healthy right now?

Sounds like bulls are still high on hopium. I'd say chances are we're going to $3K at least before making new ATH's. 

I don't know how to attach photos but on the 5min chart at 8oclock about $6660

New to actually posting on Reddit. Kinda just read.
Let's keep this PG-13
It makes sense, too. Diagonal lines are mostly used by people who use TA, while horizontal supports are used by everybody, including traders.
Slowly starting to agree with /u/sloppysynapses

I'd like to see when do people realize that this just might go sub $1k and never go back up.
I don't really have any bags to sell lol. Yeah I will stop fooling myself and will be shorting it in future.. 
shorting right now is risky af 
I think yes. Last weeks high of $7,777 corresponded to the larger triangle pattern many refer to over here. I think the pattern is breaking and is no more valid.
In theory a small bump up could scare them out (stops or whatever), which forces them to buy back, which can turn it into a medium bump up.  Ain't no squeeze gonna happen though.

But yeah OP is rationalizing his desire.
He’s referring to an Itty Bitty short squeeze 
It just means there is a chance of a short squeeze where shorters will have to buy btc to cover their shorts. 
This used to be basically like that but I think some didn't like draconian modding that would leave us with like 30% deleted posts and removal of some shit that was fine. But yeah it's getting spammier
> I am 4/5 on my last five trades, all long

What? I clearly remember you taking several losses and saying "oh well" like 8 times. 

Do your thing and be a moonboi but why lie about trades? 

In your comment history, ctrl+f "close"

> Closed my long just above break even. Will open another at 7300 and add to my hodl stack there

> I fully expect to wake up tomorrow wirh my 8.5 long glowing bright green but won't care much if it's not. 

May 16th, after that price never went above ~$8550

> I'm holding a long from 8.65 and not worried about it at all. 

May 12th, price never went above $8900 after that. 

> 9250 close, 9275 open

Then you shorted $9860 and closed it at a loss and said:

> This is why I don't trade much.

None of your longs could've been closed at more than a 3% gain. And that's if you closed at the very top. 

Your short was the best entry but you closed at a loss.

be bullish all you want but don't lie. You just look silly. 

>historically, shorting bitcoin is a great way to lose money and not a very good way to make money

Interestingly, your best entry was a short and you closed it at a loss. 

---

Sorry to creep through your post history but I think lying about or exaggerating the success of your trades is silly, especially since it's literally all right there
Dude post your trades or it didn't happen because you are so full of shit. Look at his post history, screams permabull
That felt like eternity 
If it is indeed a breakdown, it will likely lead to some weeks of follow through. I found what Josh Olszewicz had to say about 3 weeks ago relevant -  https://bravenewcoin.com/news/bitcoin-price-analysis-consolidation-continues-2/
Lower price/media attention/euphoria = no urgency for regulatory involvement [while value creators continue to build]. 

Particularly in the 200B's total, it's an insignificant blip on their radar, for now.
lol

The true Bitcoin brand alone is worth >$100B
But data shows the btc hasn’t really moved much in the big wallets.  Wouldn’t they have flinched before now?
Thanks
I know, edited, thanks.
Yeah, oops.

Still though, how much should we look at this, it seems to be a cleaner formation than BTC right now.
That's some strong hopium, can I have some?
quadruple incoming next month?
With the size of that drop, it would have to be more like an inverted Marge.
[deleted]
Yes.. Why?
I agree, bears should have shorted above 9k and held that shit man. But I meant patient in short term. Like don't short 6,6k when its hyper obvious well atleast go to 6,8/9k.
No offence but that’s dumb, wait till a lower low is made. Without that there is simply not enough conf. Like close at 6.6 and resort under 6.4. If it goes to 4K quickly a few hundred won’t matter nah mean
Virgin bottom shorter? Subs full of em
[deleted]
Shorts overbought on the daily.  Bitcoin oversold on the 4hr really bad
they were good 2 years ago. Then, the 2.0 guys stepped in...
Now tell me why you think that. Baghodlr. You don't give any arguments why the fundamentals of BTC are good. Please inform me. 
Your buy signal said buy at $7300 and $7200. We're now down 6-7% from there. Your buy signal may be broken 
We’re up 100 bucks on the hour. At this rate we’ll hit 100k by Christmas. 
[deleted]
From my experience, I wouldn't put too much weight on an unbacked claim from a random person online
Pretty much a self fullfilling prophecy, once we dumped to the 7300s earlier a lot of people were afraid of a big dump through the ~7050 support line, causing them to sell, which actually caused the big dump.
Yes, the fact that so many people suffer from blockstream core devs' broken promises and false hopes is the fuel for the long term shorting strategy. If people start getting anything close to what they thought they were buying then I might have to go long or something.
Must hurt to be long for the last 6 months...
Well then my strategy should have been failing spectacularly this whole time! You better convince the market to tell me I'm wrong.
thanks for finding some enjoyment in my post. Keep it positive brother. I think there are a lot of people who lost money in the last 48h so they are salty about my relative success and downvoting me lol
I've got a hedge short order at 6969. Less confident this one will hit. Based on some meme lines I drew + a little bitmex oracle meme insight.
Guy is high as a kite
yes exactly...  if everyone knew that someone wants to sell a shitload of coins then everyone just wait it out for lowball orders and he will make way less on the sale

Who is this and what have you done with Sloppy the bear?
Oh wait, that was me. Sorry.
That was what, like 2-3 weeks since the last frenzy of buying? With half the alts still sitting at ATH or near-ATH levels ratio wise, lots of margin longs open on every margin-available Bitfinex coin, Korean premium still at ridiculous levels, the cheerleaders still singing songs of hodling strong. Completely different market conditions, not to mention the previous price action was entirely different as well. 

We've had months of weak, boring market for anyone and everyone to get out / hedge / ragequit / bury their ledgers. There's not nearly as much supply now as there was then; and the price is already well on the way down. It's like comparing going long when we had that dip the first time we went past 10k (on the way up) and going long around somewhere around $10k-$11k on our last 2 double tops. Yes, it's possible to make a profit -- but risk / reward here based on market conditions is very different. 

Not even saying that the price isn't going to go lower here or anything, but expecting a 50% drop straight down from here based on what happened last time shorts were opening is really pushing it. 
Looks like I'm too tired. You're trying to say that we started some kind of fractal?
Whales will ensure there is no free money in this market. If you get cocky leveraged either way in a questionable entry, rolling the dice.
What was the ratio to longs at the time?

Suspect it was smaller than the ratio at the BGD.
> What I'm pointing out is that success rate for shorts when they increase parabolically is basically 50/50.. So don't be too sure of anything

I think this is a good point. I think on top of these 50% shorts, most of the remainder 50% active money is sitting just on the sides if I am not wrong..
Thanks, good point.
How do you know it's a local low?

What evidence do you have?
100X long on idiots
Yeah I don't get why people always ask this question in disbelief. Some people don't want to trade, would rather get the tax benefits of hodling *and* aren't certain of anything and would rather endure more bear than potentially miss out on upside. 

Is that really so shocking to people?
I hear this said often - can someone explain to a simpleton how HODLing is better from a tax perspective (assuming you will eventually sell at some point in the future)?
TBH I kind of like this about btc more than stocks.  I know it sounds stupid considering how manipulated BTC is, but I've never been a fan of the fact that hords of insiders always know information that will affect the market well before the average investor.

I feel like BTC being nearly 100% speculative (there are some real world use cases which could be use to place a value on it, but we're far above that value) makes it somehow more pure, all psychological.  Even the function of the whales is "above board" in the way that everybody knows there are whales with huge stacks which affect the market.

With that being said, exchanges trading within themselves is fucked up, especially if they use their power to cause liquidation events.
One word: catalyst! 
Yeah guess so. Its very simple in stocks though, to link an event to a reaction in price. Few but very defined variables at play.

They just attribute it to the change in price I guess. Specifically this weekend your probably talking about the exchange that got hacked, news of this does spread on outlets etc. BTC was already dropping they just adding the fact that an exchange also got hacked and it added to the drop? LOL




Yea, I mean it's an investment/operation like anything else. 

There was absolutely 0 guarantee they were going to make money on it. I don't get why people think that it's some sort of law that all bitcoin miners will make money. 
Interesting thanks, I didn't know which side the toe dip was on 


Obviously I wouldn't take it that far, but the r/r for at least a scalp long in the 6500 range is pretty good. I'm scaling into one on sept that would only be 50% of my short position. 1/5 fills, current CA @ 6672. Using my typical 5-fill weighted percentage scale (10/15/20/25/30) 
the rate of change downwards is faster now since it broke down. It will be a higher low until it's not.

I get what you're saying but this is literally what diagonal lines are useful for...
Pretty much it. Halving + more players = higher price. Something must breakt this narrative, and I do not see it.
Why is goblin town called goblin town?
Buyers got burned bad, buyers don't see it bottomed out.

The ones that took us to 20k will be the ones that will take us from 30 to 50 but we need to go to 30 on our own, and that's what's failing.
I'm willing to bet 4800 is the absolute lowest we will go. Fully certain on that.
Thanks for the reply!
How come? You've got some nice entries there.

Well, shit.

> Lmao this isn’t the theory of relativity; there’s no metric tensor, so “tensor volume” can’t possibly be a thing. Do you just mean regular ol’ cumulative volume of buys/sells?

Sorry, I was actually talking about volume profile. I want to see the individual volume profile for each candle. I think this would be incredibly interesting and useful to look at. 

>Best I’ve found in that department is MarketDelta charts.
I use them all the time. You should check those out if you haven’t seen them.

Yeah that's not exactly what I had in mind but those look useful. You pay $199/mo for that?
wut?
Where are you charting? Your chart says "BITSTAMP:BTCUSD". 
So we past that line, nothing happend
Could be a massive bear trap although the volume on this break would suggest otherwise. Then again....this is bitcoin so who knows
That'd turn the large symmetric triangle into a large descending triangle, seems within the realm of possibility.
Apparently you're new to this market. It would not be at all unusual. It would almost be normal. Everyone will tell you to zoom out, but I would say it's more useful to zoom back. Take a look at any 3-6 month period starting in 2011. Bitcoin goes down, and Bitcoin goes up. Generally, it goes up over time due to the small supply. Demand can come out of nowhere, and it really doesn't take much to jam the price up 10 percent or more in a day.
It might be in the cards if this is viewed as a triple bottom.
similar situation, ride or die
Capitulation is often the term associated with the steep drop after a bubble phase. Just prior to despair.

Obviously the actual word could be used for bears or bulls. Bears capitulate and buy in when they realise the price is going up, or FOMO. But capitulation is being said a lot now because people are genuinely worried where we're heading if we go under 6.4k.
Yeah. THAT is waht it means to be a HODLER.
maybe, I doubt it though.

ETH and BCH are not great options imo. The value of those coins are 100% linked to the well-being of their BDFLs... If Vitalik were to get hit by a bus, Ethereum would take a heavy hit.
Yes it has independently led big dumps at pivotal moments, can't remember which one but I found one where it definitively started dumping 15-20 minutes before BTC did, leading to a 10%+ BTC drop.
Gotcha, yes it could be a triple bottom or it could also be a descending triangle.
For the record I'm not advocating for this but that's what people are kinda going for, an imprecise 6.5/6.6 triple bottom
Coinbase gave out guidelines for their alts listings that will happen this year. Basically it has to be 'proven and established'. So the oldest cryptos  are probably going to be in added in order of when they came to be. So like Etc-> xrp-> then the next is a guess but I bet Stellar. (It's actually really old)         
Edit: I'm just guessing.  ETC was kind of obvious though, especially with the website hints. 
yay, a coin with zero developers and no community and no use is being listed on coinbase! I actually did some digging a few months ago and the remaining developer who left around that time was quite sure that the original thief is behind a lot of the remaining minimal promotion and "development" of the chain. It's utter fucking trash and confusing to newcomers.
Yeah, so that's why I'll be looking to buy the actual listing and not now, while everyone who just bought isn't planning to hold most likely.
Not sure how they got away with that, although it apparently doesn't have privacy baked in like XMR.  A US exchange will not add Monero.
Lol, it's true...
Why are you suddenly in despair when we've been here 2 times before?

Also have you considered cashing out? At what point do you plan on it? Do you have a plan? 
When I'm on my death bed, it will be on a bed in a nice house and not in the gutter. Because I sold and took my profits.

Being a holder does mean that crypto is controlling your life if you have as much of your net worth invested as the person that I replied to.
Remember no one ever went broke taking profits.
What funding pump do you speak of?
Those who bought 3-5k weren't really tested. And they already seen huge gains vanquish.
A lot were sick of getting wicked.  And also over confident about bouncing.  Couple that with the shit dropping over sat night / sun morning with people asleep at the wheel.  At least that's basically how I got rekt.
No, I normally do, but I never expected this much of a dump so quick. I was planning on letting it ride for a day and then setting stops appropriately. To make things worse, my phone battery died and I was unable to check the price during the day

That's a good point and I've considered it before. As long as you have enough churn, technically longs can stay at 32k forever, although a downwards trend means those 32k longs are constantly underwater. 

The longs capitulating would imply a bottom since there's no longs to capitulate/provide resistance back on the way up- it's a potential indicator signaling that the market has bottomed out. or will bottom out soon. As long as knife catchers keep stop lossing into the next knife catchers' hands, the 32k longs will continue to provide momentum downwards/resistance on the way up. 

If you look at recent price action for longs, there hasn't been enough churn (volatility in longs) to say that 32k longs have swapped positions with each either.

For example, if we went from 32 to 30 to 32 to 30 and repeated this until the 2000 long difference added up to 32k longs, then yes, you could say it's possible that *Every single* underwater long closed and all longs are now fresh (although this is a big stretch- this is the opposite side of the spectrum of my prediction). 

But since even just $7.5k+ I don't know if there's been enough churn to say that there are no more underwater longs.


Ha, I don't know about that. I appreciate that though. I've been "trading" since December when I first panic sold. In terms of actually having a plan and making trades that made sense, somewhere in February-March of this year.

I'm not nearly as knowledgeable as I may sound- the authority with which I write comes from an aggregation of advice and knowledge I've read elsewhere from people with much more experience, as well as observations of how they trade and react to the market. People who post their trades and rationale/reasoning for their trades as well as when they closed has significantly helped me learn quicker. The nice thing about trading is you can kind of learn from other people's mistakes and successes.
Yes, I would have assumed he is trading for years, but sounds like he is just very smart and works hard at trading.  

He is one of the best posters here and not just saying that because I agree with him 95% of the time.
If we ever do another "Best of BitcoinMarkets" competition, I nominate /u/SloppySynapses for Rookie of the Year. He's earned it.
if you're really going to start trading just realize very quickly that people are going to try to scare you out of very good positions. Even really smart people/good traders are wrong sometimes. And keep in mind, two people taking opposite positions can both end up in profit! A good trader trading against you may have a different plan than you or plan on holding for a shorter/longer period of time. 

come up with a strategy/set of rules for your trades and follow them. Adapt/change them as you see what works and what doesn't- but don't let someone's random one-off emotional-appeal-meme throw you off your game. 

Do what you think is going to happen based on your strategy

Always factor in what kind of trade it is. Long term? Short term? Plan on adding later? Reducing at a certain point? The most important part of opening a trade is having a plan for when you will close it at a loss. If you start off trading that way you're off to a great start. 

Most people open a trade assuming they will be in profit- you should really do the opposite- prepare to be underwater at some point and have a plan for exactly how you will deal with it. The rest is just learning when to profit-take vs sit back and let it ride (which is, admittedly, incredibly difficult, but choosing how much money you want to make sounds like a first world problem to me!)

Right I'm just showing how ridiculous the up trend was and how hard it shafted anyone who tried to call the top prematurely and how much it rewarded anyone with any modicum of patience when longing/buying
My wife said the same thing last night.
I think the only people that expect this to happen are mostly traders though. Most non trading types (*permabulls*) can't see anything but the price going up. Are you implying that we can influence the market this much? It's taken this long for BTC to reach high 6k again, I think resistance will stall though the drop is most likely over time. Just a long, painful bleeding with a few bumps on the way...
Definitely a possibility.  
Or could fly out and do a 500$ candle to 7270.. isn't that the least expected.. where my permabulls at?
This.
if you think it's more likely to break down then the r/r can't be that great...:p

personally I have 0 faith this will go higher than it already has; in fact it'll just make a lower high, so the reward is not particularly rewarding. Look at it like a descending triangle and that's generally my feeling on the market lately 
If you have that short then it's good rr, personally I'm afraid 6.8 may be too much of a resistance.
This post of mine sums up my outlook and position:  https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8pgw6v/daily_discussion_friday_june_08_2018/e0btw6p/?context=0

IMHO, there's no reason to believe this is going to go up short term.  I'm definitely buying more at some point in the future but only if I'm 100% convinced it has stopped going down (or at least until I can buy 1 btc with the leftovers of what I originally put in).  

My 2 cents is to not throw money in and wait it out until you can get the best possible price.
Basically my life 2018 :)
I was exaggerating a bit haha, more referring to the mood rather than literal price action. But that's the thing, I don't understand the mindset of someone who is bullish at a lower price point.

Maybe it's just people trying to time the bounces to make some extra money, but I swear people in here are acting like we are right at the launch pad with the rockets revving.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/t3bfCEbj/
Pumper was absolutely trying to paint the tape on multiple time frames, up to the daily.
That's too steep of a line with only two previous contacts. Resistance here is horizontal and it failed to get above 6900. Also volume was anemic. https://www.tradingview.com/x/1T44780V/

There's still time though.

That's more less what I had in mind. Exchanges will move, even having problems with fiat they can still operate, look at bitmex. US can try to take them down, look at BTC-e. Price will dump but until it isn't illegal it'll be working.
They could be, I don't see why they wouldn't do insider trading in an "unregulated" market as it is basically free money. 

The thing is there will only be a few in the know, and they would keep it very quiet.

Why ruin a good thing, I guess we will find out soon enough. 
Fair enough mate, that was two weeks of torture so I don't blame you for wanting to be flat 
testing to see if I get downvoted here due to downvote bots
DUDE LOL look at this im getting 5 upvotes here in 3 minutes in a completely dead thread. This bot is trying to outsmart me.
Well there doesn't even necessarily have to be accumulation any time soon. 

But yea, the selling climax occurs at the bottom. Seeing as we haven't gone sideways here for long and that was the highest volume we've seen in 40 days, doesn't make sense to start,calling for accumulation yet. 
Of course all of the coins will be sold someday.  That is true of the BTC that everyone on here is holding as well.

We were talking about if the coins will be sold by the Mt Gox bankruptcy trustee, not if they are sold later on, after they distributed to people.   It is doubtful that all of those will be sold on the first day they are received, nor will most of them.  They will all be sold in the next 100 years though.  So talking about if they will be sold or not, means nothing unless you put a non vague time frame on it.
It's too sharp.

Target of the triangle we broke down is somewhere around 1k, I wouldn't count on going hard down now. Too much support on the way down.
Whenever one door closes, another short opens
5.8 was a big drop followed by big pump. Next attempt was slow and steady bleed to 6.5 that got bought up when we hovered there for a while. Another attempt on 7k was so slow that we saw what happened - bled to support at 7.2 and faith lost.

We're bleeding back down. If ATH resistance won't turn into support and we won't test it before it drops below that 5.8 low then we might see how it is to fall off a cliff when longs lose hope after 5.8 breaks.
lol, just mind the grip pressure I guess.
That's why I added the part about more moderate climates. I think the NE will have a positive growth to their economy as a result and the south will suffer somewhat
It’s still a good long term investment and that’s what he was asking about. Geron which is a joint venture with Crispr and Vertex from my understanding is trialing a sickle cell drug in Europe as we speak.  They also have a immunity-oncology drug that has filed for a phase one trial.   
One more NTLA I forgot those are the big 3 though in crispr action. 
Seriously considering relocating my investment from crypto to short one of those techs
Oh...did I? You should read my post for the day AFTER I made the trade. You'll find it QUITE interesting. Well...maybe not interesting...but you'll certainly be irritated.

Don't know where you are in the world, and as fucked up as it is, if you live in the US buy guns that the media deems "assault rifles" wait when tensions over gun rights are high like after a mass shooting (again super fucked up). Then sell said guns to rednecks who think the "guberment" are coming to take their guns away. 

Basically gun sales increase/people are willing to buy guns at a higher price when they think they won't be able to buy in the future

It’s not that hard to find watches that hold/increase value over time.  I follow a bunch of watch Instagram accounts and could share if you’re interested.  I’ve been eyeing 60’s Hamilton Sport Divers for a while...the last generation that had US movements.  But honestly, you could buy a Rolex Submariner new and get a nice ROI in 25 years if you keep the packaging and receipt.  
Yes, it wasn't still tested, it may bounce this before bigger leg down..
futures were trading at 10400
Not me you're responding to but I don't really see a move that only goes to 7k qualifying as a short squeeze. To me a short squeeze is assessed after the fact that a move upwards was caused by a lot of shorts closing. I don't see many shorts closing at a move to 7k at all, I just see more getting added to in such a scenario as people who missed the last move look for a good entry. A move to 7.1 might trigger shorts closing, though, to push it up higher, and *then* be seen as a short squeeze. If people want BGD 2.0 though they're gonna be bummed out
Yup, going from 6.8 to 7k isn't a squeeze, it's a bounce. 2% bounce where longs are closing and shorts opening.
Well... Yeah... The squeeze word is used too often lately. I just don't see how pushing price up couple bucks can be seen as squeeze. Squeeze is when price is being pushed through big resistance lines which starts cascading effect.

Completely agree with rest of your post.
Just a quick one. Are your positions on the position bot still running and accurate? 
Fair enough, maybe my terminology is wrong but whenever I see shorts piling up after a big drop I just think these are the people that are too late and trying to FOMO into a move.

The contrarian in me figures a lot of these are weak handed shorts that would rush to close at any sign of strength and could trigger a bounce (not a squeeze*).

I’m not sure it’s all that frustrating though?  A down trend is characterized by both lower highs and lower lows, setting a lower high at some point makes sense, could be here.
I'm tired of seeing this since BGD happened. When we were going up from 5 to 20 there was a long squeeze every couple of days, it was irritating as the price moved like 20% on those. Now every couple of shorts open people think it'll go to the moon by squeezing them.

No. It won't. The only thing that squeeze does now is letting scalpers close their longs in profit. It won't change until we find the bottom. And looks like we're far from it.
>I live in US. I can't short. 

Americans are allowed to short via CME and CBOE exchanges. 
I don't need to, I know what that is. My point was that nothing is certain
Idk who that is lol. Anyways by the way thanks for those tips you gave me on trading yesterday, I've saved that message and I'll be looking back on it. You really seem to know what you're talking about. Also I thought my funds were lost last night but it was a false alarm, withdrawals were simply taking a long time for some reason.
Yeah man, I had a stop and removed it for the fear of fakeout wick pushing me out of position :( The right thing would’ve been to have wider stop. 
What capital requirements do they have?
LOL
Kraken
It is significant, because it helps the Manipulators take more of your money.   
Maybe for newbs. Not for most of us. 

Were any of you guys around a few years ago or do you think Bitcoin was invented six months ago? These things take a little time. The period from February until now will look like another six-month flat period with little bumps and dips when the top of the chart is at $50K sometime next year at latest. Would not surprise me at all if it happened this year.
Because people are getting sick of being dumped on and not as eager to buy back so fast..
Ahh ok thanks I actually suspected that’s what it meant haham
Boom.
Should add: yup, you're right, going high lev short now may be risky, but it looks like 6.8 became resistance, so not so bad r/r. If you can take a loss up to 7.2 then going here won't be such a bad idea. I expect 6.8, 7k and 7.2 as key resistances if it decides to go up.
Yeah, you’ll find the “speculators” over in ETHtrader and CC...I’m sure they’re posting suicide lines.  “Traders” want action; the direction of said action is meaningless.  
still not the average joe who throws 600$ and expect 3000% return in 24h. So this sub still is not the average "investor" of btc.
Stamp had it ~7.2, for me it was good line, a lot of people draw it differently.

Doesn't really matter, hard to believe we break 6.8 resistance to test if it was 7.2 or 7050 anytime soon.
It's strange how sometimes the market just has no bounce in it. When the RSI is oversold on many mid-short timescales but the price just hangs there between dropping further. 

We're down ~15% in less than 2 days and yet I agree with you guys that this thing looks really weak.
Oh sorry man. Yeah agreed. 
Didn't read my update, did it manually via PM.
Ok, I went xbtu instead xbtm, so maybe he got confused? But I didn't get any info that I was wrong...
"Monthly buys right now until next bubble" 

  smart!
You can see it whenever any cryptocurrency related article hits /all.

People come out of the woodwork to shit on it.
I'd agree with it just being more random noise if we hadn't broken down through a major support to get here, that makes me think that support will be tough resistance now and buyers haven't shown much resolve lately
Best of luck to you if you’re currently long.
Does [this broken line](https://www.tradingview.com/x/DrFGopmA/) look more convincing?
There are a lot of great reasons for this, but I will start by addressing your concern by saying that the USD price of BTC would be irrelevant to tokens that would be secured on the underlying BTC chain; it is the immense nethash and immutability of the BTC network that would be appealing there. 

Right now we do this essentially with databases and a trusted third party, BTCC/Cede & Co. and they process trillions in transactions. 

A middle man worth trillions...
Do you have evidence that a BTC ETF is likely to be approved this year? I am genuinely curious- from what I've seen there's nothing on the horizon suggesting one would be approved any time soon. The latest filing was a joke
What is Bitcoin *going*? It’s not really making headway or progress in the world. And  think investors are tiring of the lack of adoption and the lack of anything beyond the mysterious speculation over what might be one day. 
No. No I didn’t.

Really guys, you don't know who's shorting. Keep in mind that was before the tether FUD dump shit. 

not all shorts are equal. Trade the charts, fundamentals, etc. 

You don't know if you're betting against the best, richest trader in the world with 20,000 btc or 20,000 dumbasses with 1 BTC, so perhaps don't trade based on anonymous margin positions.
30k Longs haven't raised an eyebrow on this drop. They probably have extremely low liquidation.
Is this counting positions open or volume.
Buyers had multiple opportunities to push this up. Sellers had enough so many times, that they basically left the doors open, there was no will to push it. Was bullish close to 10k, then was bullish when we bounced from support of triangle, now I lost faith. 
Parabolic rise? The number of shorts basically has not changed much for the past few hours
That Article that you mention is from 17 Feb 2018 so difficulty has not changed since then ? :P  
And for Venezuela yes it's cheap there but you have to buy Mining Hardware and bring it to the Country which is very risky right now they can easily be stolen on the way to you.  
And lets not forget it's illegal to mine there ...
Each miner has a different mining cost. So not all miners stop at the same time. Just as now, mining hardware is constantly being added and hashrate increases, when price drops, mining hardware will be shut down in steps. So instead of 10 minutes average block time you will maybe have 12-15 minutes, but bitcoin won't stop. Bitcoin can go to 1$ and still have miners to generate blocks.
That makes sense. The *miners* put a lot of buy pressure on the market to keep the prices afloat /s. What they can do is reduce the available supply by holding and not selling but then how do they pay their operation costs?

I'm surprised this miner debate is still a thing honestly. The less efficient miners will shut down and go out of business or continue mining at a loss. Its a competitive world out there.

People keep talking about low volume forgetting that a big part of the volume is currently on OTC market. Volume is in no way an reliable indicator.
Break out from what?

We're trading in 6650-6850 range since we dropped down, basically we're at 6750 with couple of wicks up and down. Market waiting for next step.
Hah, if it goes to $1K from here without breaking back over 7500, I'll have 25x'd my bitcoin or something. It'd be hard to get rid of it then! 
For this to happen you need a black swan. What's an antonym of 'euphoria' ? :) Depression. Relax.This is just typical bitcoin, spreading and leaving behind pain.And right now it's oversold.  


EDIT: If it was so easy everyone would buy and become filthy rich. The market has to provoke fear, this is what makes people sell the bottom and others afraid to buy it. 
> I'd like to see when do people realize that this just might go sub $1k and never go back up.

Chances of that happening are slim to none, and Slim left town a while ago. 

I can't wait until the next run up, by which I mean big run up to a new ATH. It will happen, or at least it's far more likely than your scenario. Get your favorite crow sauce ready. I think you'll need it by the end of summer.
> But yeah OP is rationalizing his desire.

Aren't we all?
My desire is real volume. Unless we see some real volume, I won't buy in, no matter how high it goes. Personally, I see a possibility of bouncing to 7k, if anything, I would only short bounce.

Allstar contributor. Allstar stalker. You win this sub
Very creative narrative. You should write children's books.  They are gullible and believe everything.
so was the enron brand.. and kmart brand.. the roseanne barr brand and a million other brands. 

Til they weren't.

a lot of those big wallets accumulated under this price point.  They've never really been put to the test. They will behave just like every other human does in a panic - sell.


Watch 500, if eth breaks down it should drop a good amount 
Could just be a Bear Flag honestly. Definitely worth keeping an eye on those lines though. Especially the lower line if we break that support more downside should be expected.
Yess, seems you missed the 6th of June so get high on the Father’s Day run
Possibly. Looking a lot like 2015 to me. Very flat, then a big run up

This has no idea what he is talking about, just look at his post history
You got owned this weekend 
It's not necessarily dumb, it's just risky. if it works he'll have a wonderful entry.

If you wait for a lower low you miss out on 10-20% of movement and then you *really* risk shorting the bottom. 

$300 hundred at $6k is almost 5%...
Dude, I don't need to see a lower low. We just broke a **5 month trianlge** to the downside. This shit is going deep...
You realize that we broke a **5 month triangle** to the downside right? That support turned resistance at 7K is essentially a price ceiling until this shit capitulates. I am not shorting the bottom, I am shorting prior to the capitulation that will take us to anywhere from 4k to 5.4k

I will be closing my short when *you* are panic selling
Cool can you post and add it to the position bot then?
well there has been actual progress in scaling, it has helped many people in certain countries with corrupt gov's, regulations are starting to become more clear in US (for good or bad this will give institutions more confidence to put their money in).

If you're using btc as a store of value these kind of movements shouldnt even matter to you as you should be looking over 1+yr timeframe

the only thing that is slightly worse is merchant adoption (but this will probably change as well once LN is more widespread)
Math much?
Cause of circuit breakers..? or are you talking about something else 
Hah im not stupid, I know. 

I found a comment once that predicted BCH hitting $3k and listed the date it was going to be added on Coinbase in a desolate subreddit once.

This space is rife with insider info and front running so you never know. Just curious. 
Which means the dump was premature, a panic. 
With the exception of people misled by Roger Ver, virtually everyone got exactly what they thought they were buying: Bitcoin. Anyone who can use Google knows damn well that bitcoin is a speculative asset. If they didn't do their own research, that falls on them. It has nothing to do with developers. 
You realize that u/Buckyboycoin has been around since like 2k
Yep. Not me
I dont care about your gains. You said lightning isn’t making progress and you’re wrong.
I would be more humble with this market. Watching pumps and dumps and charts all day unfortunately doesnt give us magical prediction power
Seems solid
Nice.
lol I'm just pointing out his inconsistency 
I can't write a long reply yet but my point wasn't that we will drop 50% from here in 4 days, it was that shorts piling on isn't indicative of an impending short squeeze. Some people seem to think shorts piling on is incredibly bullish but it's not. This is true for longs as well. They're both very weak contrary indicators 
All he's saying is that the BGD is not the only possible outcome of parabolic short growth, and providing an example.
My main point is that this doesn't look too different from the short period before either the short squeeze OR the dump to $6k. 
Good point, not sure. I'd venture to say it was about equal. Just guessing though.  Can't view charts for a few minutes 
excellent idea, even if you made the wrong choice, the world will end up liquidated of idiots.
Long term capital gains are more favorable for Americans 


Some countries, sell within a year and get taxed 50% of profit. Better to hold and hope.
Me too. I actually realized the past few days that I will genuinely be kind of sad of btc tanks and sags for a while. Thought I'd be more excited to make money but damn. 

This whole thing, the raw psychology, it's really fun and interesting 
Well if you want the market to survive they need to. 

If the miners shut down there is no more market. Even with emergency difficulty adjustments to the downside with the amount of mining equipment out there. If the price goes too low you're just going to be seeing a boatload of 51% attacks. When the miners shut down network hashpower decreases and guess where a lot of that old mining equipment may wind up
Long from 6.5 might be nice for a scalp, but tbh the more down we go the more out of idea I am. Buyers are failing every step. This market now is more for scalping shorts than longs.
We just gotta play the waiting game now...  if it breaks down we know more definitively.   Until then, high hopes...  wait what am I saying, I’m playing a Short here, let it dump!!!!!
Because it used to be a fun town and now it’s filled with scary clowns
goblins live underground
4800 feels like a pretty decent low. 75% off ATH. 20% below our current YTD low. 

I'd try to purge "absolute" and "certain" from your vocabulary regarding a speculative asset with significant barriers to adoption, though.
lol, na

I had some pretty bad trades. Some profit, but basically lost 0.7 BTC along the way and ~0.5 BTC yesterday. Managed to save some of the position and made 0.2

Meant to say Finex.

But we are currently battling for the line.

Flirting with it on stamp right now 
Definitely could be, but it's really on whales to make it happen. New money + sidelines money still not overly interested in 6.7k, which doesn't make this deal all that sweet for whales
Not a fan of redrawing lines to fit new narratives. IMO that'd just invalidate it.
Love it when newbies accuse other people of being new. Conveniently ignored long term TA and babbled a bunch of obvious shit.

Yeah sure, if turning 4 figs into 7 figs counts as being new, then I'm new.

Anything can happen. Learn to work with odds. Odds are vastly against bulls at the moment.
LOL dude you just keep getting funnier. Everyone this is the guys saying you were an idiot if you didn't long at 7600.

Just look at his post history and you'll see its best to just ignore what he says 
[deleted]
Never though lt of it like that. If BTC's "BDFLs" were to get hit by a bus it would probably increase in value. 
It then creates a cascading effect on other coins and amplifies the movements. With 3 main coins testing support at the same time, all it takes is one to drop and the others will follow.

But if one pumps hard, it can also drag the other to a safer position. It's better to trade the breakouts for now instead of trying to guess the right direction.


I find equally interesting is yesterday's close/today's open lines up with the giant BGD low wick.
xrp and stellar look like ICO securities though.  Since the tokens are created out of thin air and sold to help fund the foundation/corp.
I bet it's zrx
IOHK helps develop ETC. So certainly not zero developers.
That might make sense trading USD/ETC, but with the ratio I think sooner is better.
I'm not sure. I did not feel despair the other two times...I've cashed out a lot, I mean I live off it. I could never go into red because several multiples of my initial investment has been taken out.
As someone who took significant profits a year ago, I am broke relative to where I would have been sitting on my hands for a year >.<


it was at 4pm. this was the daily candle pump lol
That is incredibly nice of you, thanks, I appreciate that a lot. You've made my day :)
Planning a trade preparing to be underwater is fantastic beginner advice. Wish I had known this when I started...
ty man, you are the best
Haha this made laugh
What, we don't have eyes? We've seen it go down. Now it will go up. That's kind of how it goes.
I don't expect that, but it wouldn't surprise me at all. What I do expect is a series of $1000 daily candles at some point this summer. Mr. Kobayashi will need his coins back by September. 
Easy to decide on a stop loss price for a long from here. Not as easy to pick a stop loss on a short from here, and I feel like I'd have to pick one further away from the current price to avoid getting stopped out pointlessly.
Is that the free fall wedge from 7600 ? Well I guess a 1000$ BRD had to stop somewhere. I think this doesn't have much signification at this point.
Hahaha wtf
Maybe I'm not understanding you correctly. Are you saying that you think this might be the (lowest) bottom? Or that since we witnessed such a high volume, we might see further drop?
>If it is then its already formed and broken down right? More down to go?

It took 2 months to form this pattern so breakdown should take days or weeks as well I suppose.
I should have been a bit more specific.  There are some practical applications in the areas of immune therapy and the hematopoietic system.  That is only because those cells can literally be removed from a patient, grown in the lab and genetically modified and then returned to the patient.  Some people have the impression it is possible to just inject yourself with CRISPR-targeted sgRNAs and undo all sorts of genetic conditions.  This is completely impractical at the moment and that is what I was referring to. So there are potential in vivo applications but they are very limited at the moment. Yes, companies pursuing those narrow applications will do well in that niche but the market is also limited.
Your statement was that it would go to 30, which it never did over two years. It got so low that they needed to do a couple reverse splits. You weren’t lucky but you’re still annoying as fuck. 
smart!
good investment? What’s your return rate?
I dont think buying a new rolex submariner will provide any returns even in 25 years. They producr millions of them by now every year

The new GMT II maybe

I have a bunch of old watches, so I also wanna get something I dont have yet ;)
It is ~6085 right now for me. Right? And it would be as low as lowest wick down under 6K in Feb.

As much as I wish they weren't, shorts are incredibly skittish still. The market is still overwhelmingly bullish and longs are much more difficult to squeeze. Even a 2-3k short squeeze can pump us a few % up 

I get why you're a bit irritated though, it's becoming a bit of a meme fairly quickly 
yes, they're all still open and valid, even eth and ltc. 
The XBTU18 (Sept futures) short is slightly inaccurate on the entry. I shorted 1/6 of that position at $8600 on spot (it wicked to like $8950 on a pump when I had a limit sell and I got very lucky lol), another 1/6 at $8300 and the other 2/3 was at $7600. 

So the average entry is $8000
I don't see anything in the OP about "ATH" or "going to the moon".
It's just my opinion
Haha he's the other permabull that sounds just like this guy! 


And thanks!! I try, man. Just learn from other people and observe and am introspective a lot

Oh okay that's good. Did you put some btc on bitmex or what? 
You can use any amount. Even just a dollar. 
None
[deleted]
this exactly. the manipulators certainly work off meme charts so the close of every day, every week, probably even every 4th hour matters.
If we can agree that new capital is required to have a solid risk/return to go back up to the ATH, can you at least explain where this new capital will come from later this year?

Sure the run up in 2017 was % lower than the last market cycle, but the total market cap of crypto went up 3.5X in a little over 30 days in Nov-Dec. 30x annualized. 30x, all on speculation. Not saying it won't pan out, but it was literally all FOMO speculation.

For new capital to enter, you need a new round of investors (the question I asked) or profits that excited to  re-enter in a downtrend. And likely to get that, a catalyst is needed (new use case, further utility, banned countries eager to participate un-banned).

I am only 15 months in on crypto, been seen market cycles before. Speculation gets ahead of utility, nothing new. 
To be fair, the “newbs” were the reason we got to our ATH in the first place. 

We’d need the same newbs back plus more than twice as much capital to hit 50k from even more newbs. 
You were asking why it would go to $5k. To me it's insane to think that's not a plausible landing spot.
BadaBoom,third leg reversed.
RSI is representation of what the market is doing. I was saying this for a long time, when this triangle breaks we may see a lot of panic dropping as this is basically confirmation of failed reversal attempt.
Your command was an add to xbtu and your position is xbtm. Didn't you get a PM saying you had no open position?
Was there major support? I've been feeling beaten for quite a while now and the volume was 6k which is consistent with random dildos both green and red form that last few months
I'm not a margin trader
Far better, however if you ignored the wick at february and stuck with a horizontal line at the bottom of april we would just be touching it.

The dotted line at 6.8 seems more important to me
Yes that's all true and doesn't mean there is a 100% probability of what you said being the case.
Then you're an idiot :)))
It's more about stop losses than liquidation in my opinion. For both sides.

I can have plenty room before liquidation but if i believe it will continue going against me i'll bail. 
Don't think they will until we make new low.
Yes, you're right the buyers have had many opportunities that haven't been capitalized on.  We just haven't made a lower low yet since February so until that happens, I'm not sold on it.  That isn't to say that, that can't happen, I am rather indifferent right now but I want to explore all options.  I would say I am more bearish than bullish but this is still in the back of my head.
between 2014/15  was long times on the sweet spot between profit and non profit and  with the halfening the miners had the choice to hodl or shutdown at the end was it the kick off for the last bubble.
[deleted]
I made the mistake of holding on longer than I should have because I kept thinking this would be the bottom.  It's only luck that I'm currently still in the green, thanks to barely avoiding getting run over by both the BGD in april and the BRD yesterday, but I lost a huge amount of unrealized gains.
Wrong, volume was the huge indicator that we weren't going to break 7800
Where can we see OTC volume? 
> a big part of the volume is currently on OTC market. 

Source? Or do you just mean localbitcoins?

>Volume is in no way an reliable indicator.

It's not irrelevant.
It's hard when you have hope it'll go back up. Don't think you'll see it going up when it goes down there ;-)
It's just some people won't realize their mistakes until they lose it all. Kinda sad.
Replied to your another post.

You know, I don't really care what the price is. I trade it both ways and make money both ways. For me we can trade in 1k-2k range as well as 100k-200k.
Oi, tell me about.  Largest challenge of trading.
> I would only short bounce.

This is the rub preventing a big bounce IMO....I expect some massive resistance at 7k from longs bailing and new shorts opening at the support-turned-possible-resistance
You've had your real volume. And it came with a red candle.
Definitely getting a bit noisy in here. Worst part is that it feels like it's the same dude with 5 alt accounts.
Honestly I feel like i lost this one considering I spent my time looking through his post history and compiling a list of his trades. It's pretty petty, but I get annoyed when people lie about their trading successes. 

add to that that I'm genuinely still unsure if he's just LARPing as a bitcoin cultist 
That's so delusional.
 don't get that guy man 
Is economic attention uncorrelated to regulatory expediency?
*rosanne barr brand 100b*

maybe 100b lbs but come on 
Yes, the 1st successful digital money household name brand is comparable to enron & kmart... lol

I've yet to see an Enron tatoo on someones face.
505-508 is an S1 fibonnacci pivot point, Def a place to be keeping an eye on.

Aka I agree
No idea what you mean?
Yeah, fair, but for me its way too risky. I don't take risks like that anymore after I got tramatized doing it once lol. Plus IMO if you were bearish you should have shorted 9.8k and just been holding that the whole time. Which you did I think? I shorted that at 9.4k and held that shit it was so fucking painful
Lol, when we broke out of the log resistance line bulls were 100% sure the bull run is on. That was also a 4 month resistance line, and look where we are now. We never made a higher high despite breaking out of that. Now its the same situation, we broke down but failed to make a higher low yet, so there is simply not enough conf.
I’m not necessarily bullish here, but people were saying bitcoin was going to moon when it broke out of the descending resistance from ATH on the run up to re-test $10k.

TA only works until the pattern is broken, as no pattern can last forever. I’m not sure I’m comfortable shorting here, considering everyone expects it to go straight to goblin town from here. If it goes back up, people are just going to redraw the triangle and wait for the new one to get invalidated. I think we’re kind of at a wait-and-see approach here, considering the poor r/r on a short and the potentially huge downside on a long.
I don’t panic sell, and I can’t because I’m on the sidelines right now, waiting for you panic sellers and bottom shorters to relinquish your coins. I’ll be waiting for you at $4k my friend.
We broke out a 4month logarithmic resistance line, but failed to make a higher high. Look where we are now. People with the same level of bias that you have but bullish bias were sure we were going ona  new bull run because of that. 

But no higher high...
[deleted]
I'm curious too but at the same time I wouldn't hold my breath :( ..
Lots of people were told that it was a store of value. Those people lost most of their value. Try again. 
You got it!!! ( and even lower - 600$ ).
Thx
Yeah, I agree that the mere fact that shorts are opening doesn't have to mean they'll get squeezed soon. Just don't think the example you picked is very relevant, that's all. The market situation is completely different here.
I think there was more shorts than longs then.
Ah got you, thanks. In the UK, the first £11.7k of net gains are untaxed, and I don't think there's any distinction between long- and short-term gains. In which case (disregarding expectations about future value) cashing out some short-term gains can be beneficial. It's also possible to declare net losses to offset against gains in future years.
This. You (and by you, I mean me) can make a profit trading and then taxes come along and suddenly you've lost money overall and all your hard work and sweat was for nothing and it would have been better if you'd just sat on your hands all year.
My hope is that the market keeps doing it's thing for long enough where real world uses start to get used.  I could absolutely see a future where bitcoin (or some other enterprising privacy coin) are used ubiquitously.  Really we need to put an end to most altcoins though, as it messes with the value proposition of a limited supply cryptocurrency.  People need to just ignore them, which will hopefully happen after enough cycles where they get wiped out.

Assuming shitcoins are mostly left for dead you can fairly easily start to calculate the necessary BTC price to allow for functional use.  $100k, $1M even isn't out of the question eventually.  The key is for there to be a limited supply, so as long as we stick with BTC and a few other altcoins that have a unique purpose we should be good to go.  
Miners wouldn't all shut down at the same moment due to high variance in production cost. If it even comes to it the process will take many months with plenty of retargetings in between. Very unlikely to become a problem. I don't see Bitcoin ever needing an EDA.
I would argue that this market is now more for holding shorts and scalping longs, but it depends how actively you trade haha. I'm thrilled to be 2x short from over 7500. I'm only sad it's on June, so I can only hold it for 3 weeks max. My swaps short isn't a realistic long-term hold if we're heading down, because funding will kill me. I'm already going to have to close it before the next funding if we don't leg down just to keep it green. Still feels like a retest of 7K/pennant bottom as resistance is due, which makes me want to go ahead and close the swaps short while it's green. I can probably get a better entry. 
Haha fair enough. I'll substitute with, "I've convinced myself 4800 is the lowest we will see and I'm taking a position near there."
That yesterday's drop was a pain. I saw this breaking but didn't see it, if you know what I mean.

But earlier I could swear that you had entered that were in profit for some time.
It seems like most of the sub got rekted yesterday (me included). We were all so sure that it will bounce from the bottom of the triangle.  Glad to hear that you made some recovery though.
>  That one’s a necessary evil though..

Because you're trading more than just Bitcoin?
Things should get pretty interesting? What does that even mean

Everyone talks out of their ass on this sub
So why didn’t the whales pump when were at 11.8k and then 10k?  Would have brought in a ton of fomo money
Yeah, the symmetric triangle would be fully invalidated, that's the point.  If you redraw a similar symmetric triangle, that'd be counter productive and is what you are talking about.

Refusing to see a new state is being stuck on an old narrative.
It's not fitting a new narrative though--it'd be redrawing a line *to reflect what actually happened*, resulting in a pretty clear/obvious pattern
agreed
I lol’d
Bitcoin doesn't have BDFL's, that's the whole point. 

Remember *consensus*? Apparently most BCashers don't.
That's why Coinbase probably applied for a license to sell crypto-securities, whatever they are.
So you would be fine losing everything you have left in crypto? or, say, even just another 50%? 

Hope you're okay though. Highly suggest you formulate an exit plan...
I'd say almost all of my losses at the start were simply from not being prepared to be underwater. Most people (or at least from what I see) have a decent intuition for where the market is going to go, but get stopped out or liquidated on the way there. 
no problem :)
What my eyes are telling me right now is we've gone flatline, a little bit of sideways and we've lost volatility. If we're bound to go up, why haven't we gone up **yet**? 
Not really. This could go to $6k before bouncing miraculously. 

You could short this with tight, loose, or even incredibly forgiving stops and the downside is $6.4k, $6k, and possibly even $5k or below that. 

Longing, you're gonna see $6830 or so before strong resistance all the way up to $7200. 

Short stops could be $6850, $7050, $7200-7300 or $7800. Longing has about the same amount of options. But since the trend is down the r/r is not worth it imo
Can’t draw a wedge from it ( just yet). It could form a descending wedge over time, but as of now there’s really no formation to draw that includes $7600 drop. 
I mean it's been a day since a high volume dump. It remains to be seen if we are going lower or if we are going to go sideways/up from here.

The accumulation case would mean this was the selling climax, in which case we would establish $6.6-$7.8 as the accumulation range. If we go sideways for weeks in that range, I would begin to think it's accumulation. 

Until then, there's no reason to think it won't go lower. Otherwise you could just assume every high volume dump is the beginning of accumulation, which seems silly to me. 
Yes, the sharp drop from 20k was followed by a sharp bounce. This time we go slowly, bleeding day by day. It will take a lot of time to find true bottom.
Fair enough but these things always start small and grow into something else. It’s how we see progress, you should invest in companies with a clear growth plan and the three I mention have very exciting pipelines. 

Can you imagine being able to cure or effectively manage something like sickle cell? 300,000 people a year are born with it worldwide. Sure it’s a “niche” but I’m guessing most of those folks would gladly pay for an effective therapy. 
I sold nearly 70% of my VXX the VERY next day, and wrote about it. I am still holding the remaining 30% and I still believe I will be profitable on this remaining 30%.

I was, in fact, lucky. As for being annoying...I don't know...maybe. Does it bother you that much? I made a lot in bitcoin. Is that also annoying? Yeah...it probably is.

Look up IVOB. It's one of my long-shots but I think it's going to $2 in the next year. Try to remind me in about a year. Also, you seem like you're a dick. Jealous people are the worst. Hopefully you're nice to your family, at least.
I'm a start-up so still hard to tell :-D
Depends on where you live, but property or land is (still) a good investment in many places.

That is what I've put most of my crypto profits into.
Right, wasn't following those lines lately, thought it's higher.

So yes, we can wick down to 6k and still hold the ATH line.
It's as much irritating as DCA from 20 to now. Or holding is best strategy.

I really know what can happen now, but we can't say it can do anything until this bursts back into that triangle. And I don't think we can see shorts being squeezed just after the drop. If we stay here for longer time then maybe yes, but right now it's all over again, price being pushed down, bought up like crazy to nearest resistance and buying just stops...
Ok. Good work man keep it up.
Yes, a small amount but it won't get there until tomorrow. That's okay, I don't think I can figure out what the market is doing right now anyways so I probably wouldn't trade yet.
Thanks :)
Thanks!
That was finex and I think they took that down.
how can I invest in those memes?
When BTC is easily bought from licensed exchanges with debit cards, and without obtuse KYC, more newbs will enter the space.

My parents as one example are only just about comfortable making amazon purchases. KYC kills off that portion of the market before it can throw its dumb money in
Still a lower high... crazy movement!
Noticed that. That's why I thought it doesn't work as I didn't get it.
I just don’t think it’ll hit $10k this year for those reasons. 
Because I think that a speculative asset has a limit and at some time it needs to prove its use case, and that time is now?
We didn't make a lower low, but we managed to make higher lows since then and just broke that trend, this isn't bullish. The only thing that may hold this up is downtrend ATH line which wasn't tested since we broke it.
You'll be right eventually, good luck getting the timing though
The thing is there’s no way to do so. So, I’m prepared to the downvote, I can’t post sources, proof. Only what I know. But even though you doubt about what I say, and it’s fair, I think it gives another perspective : tradingview doesn’t tell everything.
I've seen it go down much more dramatically than it has this year and for a longer period of time. It always recovers. Next big "crash" will be from $50K to $20K and the bears on here will still be screaming about bag holding and capitulation and whatnot. They don't realize how ridiculous and delusional they look to someone like me.
Trading is natural selection at its finest. Don't feel bad. After all, for any good trade you make there are others on the losing side. No amount of reddit support you provide can redeem you. 
I'm not talking about momentary (sell) volume.
LARP? 
the problem is brands are subject to the same FOMO/FUD psychology that stock prices are.  One day you're hot, the next you're rat poison.


Yea, but I'm only holding still because I would still short here (although I might scale in or leverage lower at first).

There's not much of a difference between holding a short open here and opening one here. You're putting your money on the line in the same way 
You realize shorters don't have coins right? We sold our coins, and then some. All I can do now is buy, and I am also waiting for 4k so see you there I guess...
?!

You realize you're waiting for the same price target he is? 🤯

You're calling people bottom shorters but...waiting for $4k..??? 

What 
That was part of the plan, check out this chart someone posted on whalepool: [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/tlo0V1AE-BTC-Capitulation-still-ahead-potential-reversal-soon/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/tlo0V1AE-BTC-Capitulation-still-ahead-potential-reversal-soon/)

We are in a fractal from July, same shit happened there we broke downtrend line, got rejected and then capitulated. The fact that we didn't make a higher high makes this breakdown all the more bearish. I'm expecting at least 5.4k
Basically it tracks when people open and close long/short positions.

It's holds people accountable for their positions so people can't back track when they are wrong or only share their successful trades. That and ithe gives an idea of the subs market sentiment 

Edit:I'm basically asking you to put your money where your mouth is
Honestly I wouldn't even be particularly excited. Anything that compromises the integrity of exchanges makes me want to sell and completely get out - not hold a short on bitmex. 

My worst fear is making insane amounts of btc on a short and having the btc be worthless 😂
Alright, here goes.

It doesn't matter what they were told. They should've done their own research and made an informed decision. Tell me what this has to do with developers. Good luck. 
yeaaahhh buddy!!
Possibly, I'm just guessing because longs have generally sat around 20-30k for months now. so 26k was probably somewhere in the vicinity of the number of longs. But you're probably right 
Well, in germany unless you do commercial grade trading (i.e. like offering bitcoin purchases for others) - hold over one year and it hits an exception that means profits are TAX FREE. Similar exceptions apply to selling real estate you own long enough.

That is a very interesting advantage.
Agree on shutting down but there is so much hashing power out there if a lot of it starts going offline and especially goes up for sale. Well couple that with the reduced Network hashrate and you start setting up for 51% attacks on a variety of coins. Bitcoin cash is one that comes to mind. I'm fairly sure bitmain would defend that and immediately switch over but even if an attack happened for like 15 minutes it would really reduce confidence in the market. 

Like I totally get the psychology at work here. We have been in a downtrending market for 6 months. A lot of shorts are basically reverse mooning. Everytime they short something they make money etc
Yeah, I'm being a bit salty playing around with 10% gambling entries instead of using normal entries.

I said 2 days ago that 10x with 50% in both ways should do the trick. I'd be right with effective 5x short from 7.1 :P But tbh big moves on weekend are killing me, don'thave time for them.

I'm hedged from 6.8 on jun. I think this should be enough and will reevaluate later, plan to double at 7k and 7.2 if we get there. I don't have enough time right now to babysit $100 scalps. At least that short hedged my long and left me with higher CA than I would have shorting it here.
Sounds reasonable to me!
sometimes. I tried to trade back some losses and managed but then lost them again.

I need to develop a better strategy.

My gut has not been on point lately
Only the newer posters that have overrun the sub spamming out low-effort bullish posts were all so sure of that bounce. Unfortunately they've added a lot of noise to sort through. 
thanks bro! Hope you come out on top as well, homie
Can confirm, also got rekt af yesterday. Well, we all pretty much wanted to go for the same play (long from 7.1k~area for the meme traingle)...the r/r was too good to not try it. Would do it again anytime.
[deleted]
I’m far from talking out of my ass. Thank you very much.

You have our newly formed descending resistance line clashing with our currently support line. The market would be forced to make a move, which it did and it was up. 
Unfortunately, shorting is a thing that generates profits just as well as longing bitcoin. In that case, much easier and faster since many considered that point to be the absolute top and reversal point.
No new state to talk about from medium-long term pov except old support lines
We'd be going from neutral to bearish pattern. We're going to have to agree to disagree. Your thinking is why laymen think that TA is worthless, only used to shift a bunch of lines around to anyone's liking.
You're right, they're MDFLs.

And yeah, I remember consensus, that thing you think is established by a centralised political council in direct contradiction to the original design.

No, but I don't think that's very realistic. If I lose my 18x (which does not include the money cashed out), at this point...its probably the end of crypto. I mean I've cashed out more money than I need, this isnt a 0 sum game.
Those are the times when you could open any position, wait it out and still be in profit. On the bull run a lot of shorts that waited out needed to be closed at a loss or waited months to see green.

Prepared to be underwater, yes, but having decent SL is a lot more important.

Chevy pointed this out one time. You shouldn't be angry that your position went underwater, you should cut the loses quick, reevaluate and switch sides if market reversed.
Wow. What a coincidence just came out today:

zerohedge.com/news/2018-06-11/crispr-crashes-after-study-highlights-potential-cancer-risk-gene-editing#comment-11819317

I suspected this.  Clinical trials will be frozen now.
Here’s your comment: 

Just kidding. It'll hit $30 way before 24 months. Or...I'll still keep holding til it does...if it doesn't, then you laugh at me. And you laugh HARD.

Now you’ve got your panties in a bunch that I’m laughing at you? I don’t care when you sold VXX, your idea was shit and your stated goal wasn’t met. Enjoy life on your incel desert oasis. 
Thanks mate. Just saw you got stopped out. If you're going to short near a local low be prepared for a bounce. Market likes to shake shorts out of good positions a lot. 

My solution is to scale into a position rather than all in at once personally

Good luck 
Yeah, maybe it was the PM that didn't go through. 
Again, there is not a 0% probability that it will hit $10K this year.

Are you saying there is a 50.0001% chance it will not hit $10K?  

Or are you saying nothing?
So the ones you cited aren't the same?
I keep seeing that we broke the triangle but that really is about how you draw it which is really subjective.  If you draw it from before this move with no wicks but then yes, you're right.  If you draw it after this move and you cut two wicks on the daily one from Feb and one from April then we haven't violated anything.  People cut wicks all of time.

Also I am not trying to argue with you, I am habitual lurker and completely respect your opinion.  I just try to be contrarian in my thinking with trading and it's nice to articulate it.  I appreciate the conversation.
The point is I don't say it won't, I'm saying it might not. I accept both scenarios. Some people don't. They think that 'it always recovered, it will this time', no, it may not recover this time. Amount of money pushed into market to move it from 1k to 2k is much smaller than to move it from 20 to 40.

If you were in 10 car crashes and go out without a scratch it didn't mean you're a God and won't get killed in 11th crash. It means you were a bad driver and got lucky. Of course, you can go another 10 without a scratch, but the possibility of being killed in car crash gets higher every time.
I know that. I know that a lot of people loses are my wins. But I also know that some people just won't accept reasoning.

I don't mind when lunatics and fanatics lose their money on their beliefs, doesn't mean I can't try to persuade those who want to listen.
live action role play.

As in, I'm not sure if he's pretending to be a bitcoin cultist as a really extensive, intricate ironic performance intended to make fun of them, or if he really is being genuine 
I was just teasing him. I honestly have no idea where we’re going to go, but I’ll be watching the price action closely as of late. I’m leaning towards a triple bottom, but time will tell.
Oh yeah, I'm expect 5.4k, atleast, as well. It's just not a 1 way street down and people acting like scalp longing 6.6k was the dumbest thing you could do and leverage shorting BTC at 6.6k was the smart enlightened pro trader move. That's the only reason I posted my rant. Sometimes bears remind me of dumb ass permabulls and its annoying. I guess I should just learn not to be affected by noise on online forums lol
What did the original comment say?
Devs and the censored forums were only pushing and allowing the narrative that Bitcoin was a store of value and that lightning network would solve all of the scaling and use case problems. How can a lay person know any better then what they're allowed to hear?
:-(

Better to lose 1 BTC at 7k than at 20k ;-)

My strategy wasn't too good also, been hovering over break even in BTC stack, so basically lost some value.
I disagree, there's a lot of people here who went long from around 7.2-7.3k, even the experienced guys.  I noticed that even some guys who made a lot of money shorting even flipped to bull (probably due to the extended side way actions).  You should never get too comfortable in this market.  Sloppy even mentioned that a big move was going to happen soon due to increased margin activity and relative lack of change in price.
> (e.g. some days I do almost 1% of the global daily volume on BCash)

Are you on MEX or OKEX?
Aright calm down
I don't think your logic follows. The old formation was drawn as it was based on what had actually happened. We now have new data. This *necessitates* updating our TA. 

Fitting your narrative into it would be ignoring the recent price movement to say, "Well, the big pattern we just exited was neutral, and redrawing to match the current data wouldn't be neutral", when the data points to a new bearish scenario.
> You're right, they're MDFLs.

Lol!

Such as who? Bitcoin is the ungovernable, 'member? That's the whole point of PoW.

>And yeah, I remember consensus, that thing you think is established by a centralised political council in direct contradiction to the original design.

Lmao! What are you talking about? You really think BCash, with total full time developers you can count on one hand and terrible hashing power / security, is more decentralized than Bitcoin? 

How can someone become so deluded and in denial? 
So you're okay with losing all of it..? 

It doesn't have to be a zero sum game...the price can still go down. 

I just highly suggest you formulate a plan on when to exit. You're risking your livelihood on an extremely volatile asset you found out about a year ago. 

If anything can make you drastically richer in a year I don't know why you wouldn't consider it could do the exact opposite in another year. 

Just be safe. If someone took out ALL your crypto money RIGHT NOW and handed it to you in cash. Would you take it all to the bank and invest it all right back in?

If you wouldn't, you're overinvested 
FDA put a hold on the US trails but supposedly going through in the EU. If it does stay with a hold it sucks but they still have 2 more drugs coming up for trails with another dozen in the pipe. I am super bullish on the sector as a whole.   I am waiting for the dust to settle and will buy more. 
I don't care if you laugh. I just thought it was funny that I made $200k in 24 hours...and I posted the entire trade...AND you've been obsessing on this for two years.

I just made a call and, in that post from two years ago, I wanted to discuss how comical it was that I can borrow $1 million from Chase (at nearly zero percent) to bet against printing money. I had to look up what "incel" meant. Yikes. I SINCERELY hope you're not like that. Don't be scared or mad of wonen. Just talk to them. Even the weirdest and ugliest guys can still get laid. No reason to adopt such a self-destructive lifestyle.

And I am enjoying my life...just not in a desert oasis. I am enjoying it in San Diego. Just...try to talk to women. I can guarantee that your "incel" lifestyle is detrimental to you.

Take care.
It's ok it was just about break even and was more a short term scalp so no worries on that one. Did close my main short to early  buy can't complain as it was still in very good profit.  I have faild to take profit and got out at break even to many times the last few months.  Feels good to bank a pretty good profit  even  if it could of been bigger. Edit a word
Nvm, updated my pos, good it's working.
Sure. I dunno 25% it’ll hit $10k maybe I guess?
As I said, the entire market cap will decrease until legitimate, profitable use cases emerge. This applies to any cryptocurrency including bitcoin and fuck token, and those specific use cases will lead the way to a new era. 
I'm not arguing :)

The triangle broke down. If we draw a new one after this move then we're talking about different triangle. Cutting wicks also has it's rules.

The point is: we broke down. Period. Now we're in a new zone and a new story starts.
To be honest he does sound like he does not want to listen.

Plus, the market can be unpredictable, maybe he gets lucky *this time*.
Ahhh, deep state action. The Colbert Report of bitcoin maxism. 
For scalping yeah its fine. But im not shorting 6.6 im shorting 6.8 and the way I see it upside is max $200 here so for my long term position its a good add on, regardless that we just fell $1000
Said CME would suspend btc futures due to a lack of cooperation from exchanges 
Lmfao. *Okayyy*
Yeah, I thankfully also only lost profits... But kind of a bummer either way. It’s more about the grind for me... I just want to be good at it. The money doesnt really matter
Most that longed <7300 the first time down were operating off an expectation of a bounce off the pennant. Longing there *again* after stalling at 7800 and breaking under 7400 was extremely unwise. There were several of us urging folks to cut longs under 7400. 

I'm truly not trying to be arrogant or condescending. I've made plenty of poor trades and lost precious coin doing it. But the bullish case has been extremely marginalized since the rejection of 7800. 
As I said, reentering old pattern we convincingly broke out of is invalidating the whole thing. At least IMO, after all TA is not exactly science.
> Such as who? Bitcoin is the ungovernable, 'member? That's the whole point of PoW.

What goes in and out of the ungovernable product is decided by fiat by a council of six people. That's actually pretty governable. I know many traditional political governments that would like that level of power and unaccountability. 

> Lmao! What are you talking about? You really think BCash, with total full time developers you can count on one hand and terrible hashing power / security, is more decentralized than Bitcoin?

Developers don't govern BCH, hashpower does. BTC and BCH use the exact same rivalries pool of hashing power, so if it's terrible on your most hated it's also terrible on your favourite.

> How can someone become so deluded and in denial?

I'm at a loss but somehow you manage time after time. I guess because you're a paid shill you just push away the cognitive dissonance and think of the paycheck. 
I think I'd invest right back in. All of it. These prices are too good even though it might go lower. 

I need to find a job because being "retired" at this age is not at all what I expected it to be. See my other response. My livelihood doesn't have to depend on Crypto, that's a choice I've made and its easily reversible. 

I am long term bullish. I was long term bullish in June. I am long term bullish now. Nothing has changed fundamentally. Actually its way better than it used to be when I got in in june.
10% is actually a 50% gain from where we are now.  Of course that isn't always a lot for crypto, but it's still 50%.
So basically everything you wrote in the original comment regarding multiple flippenings is utter bullshit
I agree we definitely had a step down but that is different from a breakdown. Once we have lower lows I will concede that it was a breakdown. I personally never thought we tested support a third time in the “previous” triangle but this would be a real test of support which as of right now seems to be holding.  Like I said I am still more bearish and would not be even a little surprised if we set a lower low. I’m off to work now have a good day. 
That's the point. It's like playing Russian roulette. You can't expect it won't fire every time you pull the trigger.
Are you talking about me? I won on 4 out of my last 5 trades, and I'm up thousands of percent over the years.
You're too bad at gut shots, I think it's because you're still too bullish and don't use enough TA. And you were good at it at bull run, this have you confidence which is bad cause we were basically going straight up.
But it simultaneously creates a new pattern, one that would create a short-term bull scenario to retest the resistance, but still be a medium/long term bearish scenario. Ignoring that new pattern is just as fallacious as saying the old symmetrical triangle would still be intact
> What goes in and out of the ungovernable product is decided by fiat by a council of six people.

This is retardedly wrong. Core is not Bitcoin. You don't even understand the very basics.

>Developers don't govern BCH, hashpower does. BTC and BCH use the exact same rivalries pool of hashing power, so if it's terrible on your most hated it's also terrible on your favourite.

Right but the hashing power is 7x lower on BCash. Therefore it's less secure. Beyond that, there are less users, less devs, less everything, meaning that it's controlled by a smaller group of people and is more prone to takeover. It's already readily clear that Amaury Sechet is the dictator of BCash hard forks. 

So that's great, you have one person deciding HF's.

>I'm at a loss but somehow you manage time after time. I guess because you're a paid shill you just push away the cognitive dissonance and think of the paycheck.

Yeah *I'm* the dumb one here.

Then why are you in despair? 
> These prices are too good even though it might go lower.

These prices aren't good at all.  They are absurdly high, based on fundamentals, which gotten much worse in the last 12 months.  Google/FB/Twitter has essentially banned Bitcoin and all crypto, at least with advertising.

> I need to find a job because being "retired" at this age is not at all what I expected it to be.

Find a hobby that you enjoy and if you can make some money with it as a part time "job", that's even better.  It's going to be tough to work a crappy wageslave job if you don't really have to.  You will probably quit quickly, because you won't be stuck into tolerating a lot of bullshit.


I think you’re a little over sensitive to the idea that other crypto assets might one day surpass bitcoin. I didn’t mention bitcoin in my original post and perhaps I should have. I have no idea if it, or other coins will emerge as the leader of the “practical” era of crypto, though bitcoin certainly dominates the speculative era. 
On another note, let's ignore for a minute the picture on the lower timeframes, which is not good. In the pair i'm charting, on the daily, we are way out of the bbands. It's not so unreasonable to assume it might go back in soon, even for a bit. Do you agree? The weekly and monthly, ok... yet another picture.
Ok wait are you a teen or something? I'm a dad, and I'm starting to feel bad picking on you.   


Look, good luck, really.
If you are offended I can edit the comment. Wait.  


EDIT: Here, is that better?
yeah, agreed
yeah, agreed
All it means is that your previous pattern is worthless and you're using parts of it to create lines that conveniently fit new narrative. I see what you're saying, but we all use parts and pieces of TA that work for us individually. I have been using the magical phrase "IMO" to non-contentiously convey that the new data points is all you get to work with now. A few hours worth of data. This is what works for me consistently. 

I can understand if maintaining the large pattern that already failed once and banking on it to make a big move on the 2nd try is something you're betting on.
> This is retardedly wrong. Core is not Bitcoin. You don't even understand the very basics.

"Is not". You'll excuse me if I find this unconvincing in light of all the evidence it actually is. 

> Right but the hashing power is 7x lower on BCash. Therefore it's less secure

Other way around actually, the majority of that hashpower has expressed the desire to mine bch and is mining btc only for short term profit. They have no long term interest in btc and do not see a future for it. Because there isn't one. 

> So that's great, you have one person deciding HF's.

Wrong, nothing anyone decides matters until it is mined. And it being mined means the market and users and all economic actors have settled on genuine consensus, rather than consensus by astroturfing social media campaigns and centralised political councils. 

> Yeah I'm the dumb one here.

I am glad you admit your faults. 
Probably regret. I don't know. I guess its a combination of issues outside of Crypto too.
Because he just lost a huge chunk of his net worth.  That will fuck with your head.  I have been through that multiple times, thanks to crypto and the stock market.  
Well, to each their own. I don't think Google banning crypto ads is even relevant to Crypto fundamentals. Its a decision by a company and its not like we had a large boost in prices because of shitcoin ICO ads anyways. I rarely ever saw Crypto ads regardless. 
You certainly seemed very sure in the original post... Also skipping the subject of the phrase but hinting clearly to it doesn't mean you were not talking about it
Pure TA, this can go up to 7.2 to test support turned resistance. Or we can go sideways taking 6.8 as resistance until this cools off before another leg down.
Or just use better stops. 7.3 entry with 6.7 stop?  You should cut it off at 7.1 or 7k.
The only time I saw you use IMO was in a ninja-edit after my reply, but regardless, I'm not interested in being contentious either. Let's keep in mind that we're discussing a hypothetical formation that hasn't even played out yet. I still think the most likely scenario is a bounce back up to retest the support turned possible resistsance at around 7kish and then continue down hard.

>I can understand if maintaining the large pattern that already failed once and banking on it to make a big move on the 2nd try is something you're betting on.

Brother/sister, I just see what would be a pretty obvious descending* triangle with the implications that we would bounce off of it up to 7.5-7.8 depending on how long it took, and then back down swiftly past our current level.
Lol! So for BCash, miners are in control, not developers, and for Bitcoin miners are *not* in control, developers are in control...

Okay, that's totally not a double standard, right? :p

Which one is it? Do developers control a PoW blockchain or do miners?
Hope you're okay. 

Getting a job or finding  a hobby will help, you're bored and depressed probably. Life isn't meant to be so easy ;)
Yeah, definitely. If he believes in it long term and is very bullish then I'd think he shouldn't be too worried. Although I guess there's always a logical part in the back of our minds that knows we could be wrong, so I get it. 

But yea...can imagine the stress. 
> Its a decision by a company

Yes Google is a company.  Not sure what your point is there.  It's also a decision by a company in the USA, that is also on the Earth.  Just trying to keep up with you with those types of insights in my argument.

And or course advertising helped awareness of ICOs and led to higher prices.
lol, I added at 7k and then it was 6400 a second later
Then perhaps you need to see the whole chain of comments because I'm tired of using that stupid 3 letters. 

Brother/sister, whatever works for you. Hope you make profit.


Miners control a pow blockchain. BTC is not a pow blockchain. It is a centralised politically managed charade masquerading as a pow blockchain to fool naive people into believing it is decentralised because distributed proof of work, but all decisions are actually made by a political council of six people and miners have no real say or input into direction going forward, which is why they are divesting themselves from the asset, having been relegated effectively to janitors.

It remains to be seen how btc will deal without miners. The obvious method is simply getting those six political council members to sign the blocks, no miners involved, because effectively that is all that's happening right now anyway., but this is politically untenable as removing the decentralisation theatre would clue the dumb money into the scam. 

So, let's see what they do.

And if course BCH on the other hand is a simple actually legitimate proof of work blockchain, meaning miners are in control, and must make decisions they believe to be in the interests of the network, which by definition is also their interests as they are paid to propagate and maintain the network. 
It really isn't.  
Believing in it long term means very little.  Even if the odds are 80% that Bitcoin will grow in the future, that is 20% chance that he could lose all or most of his money.   Those aren't odds that I would be comfortable with, long-term.  

And no way the odds are much higher than 80% at this point.  Personally, I would calculate odds are well over 50% that BTC will not see $20K again for the next few years.   The next halving should help, but the price will very possibly be back around $1000 by then.
Why did you add in the middle of breakdown of the biggest triangle we saw in months? That was a text book triangle, everything matched including volume profile. I can't say 7.3 entry was bad, it was almost perfect rr, but adding at 7?
I also hope you make a profit and also get sick of posting IMO, I did miss it in your parent comment.
Lmao this is absurd. How do 6 people determine what is profitable to mine. Please explain that ridiculous idea to me.

Also, hint: **it's not miners or devs who control Bitcoin's value and corresponding hash rate, it's hodlers.** Dumb-dumb! :) I've explained this to you already, several times. I don't get why you're incapable of taking in new information. 
> How do 6 people determine what is profitable to mine. Please explain that ridiculous idea to me.

They organise large astroturfing campaigns to dupe credulous idiots into thinking their product is useful, while it is actually a transparent sabotage ploy. Exchanges en masse have chosen to follow their definition of what the chain is, despite the fact that it is diametrically opposed to both the original vision and the architecture of the product, and consequently hashrate follows profitability by mining the chain the exchanges insist is BTC, and the duped fools buy up, not realising they're buying something fundamentally worthless.

> Also, hint: it's not miners or devs who control Bitcoin's value and corresponding hash rate, it's hodlers. Dumb-dumb! :) I've explained this to you already, several times. I don't get why you're incapable of taking in new information.

Because you're a fool, and you're wrong, so why would I listen to anything you have to say? That would be idiotic.

Oh... so your best working theory is a conspiracy theory... Ok...

>Because you're a fool, and you're wrong, so why would I listen to anything you have to say? That would be idiotic.

Do you honestly not understand supply and demand? Come on, dude. That's like the most basic Econ 101 concept ever. The limited supply is what gives Bitcoin its value. People who don't offer their coin up for sale are the ones who drive up the price. You are completely dense if you don't understand this basic fact about markets.
> Oh... so your best working theory is a conspiracy theory... Ok...

No, it's proven, do I need to cite it again and make it even more apparent to the audience you're a liar by showing the last time I did?

> The limited supply is what gives Bitcoin its value.

Your shit is limited supply, too. Try selling it at 20k USD per unit.



> No, it's proven

Lmao! So says every single conspiracy theorist ever. It hasn't been proven, you're just deceiving yourself into thinking as much.

>Your shit is limited supply, too. 

wut?

>Try selling it at 20k USD per unit. 

You're an idiot, bro. This meltdown is sad to watch.

> It hasn't been proven

[You are a liar] (https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8ok8vj/monero_can_now_be_stored_on_the_ledger_hardware/e066fng/)

You think it's a meltdown to simply state the facts. That's really all there is to say about your position. You keep pretending amusement and keep implying I am angry, while actually for all the value emotion has, I feel nothing and you are desperately trying to convince yourself you're right.




Lmao, you haven't proved anything, you just think you have. It's fascinating to witness your cognitive dissonance. Please continue. 
I don't care what you think. You effectively don't think at all, you're just paid to shill.

[Here is the last time I pointed this out to you] (https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8ohc0w/nano_the_best_odds_at_adoption/e05yw4f/)

Despite citations proving everything I said, all you had to come back with was "this is alex jones level conspiracy". You are transparently bad at deflecting, and it's really quite funny to watch.

Blockstream should hire a better class of shill, you just bore me.

What if I told you I was?
I would be as unsurprised as at anything else you've told me.

I would be more surprised if you *weren't* a shill. Normal people, no matter how stupid they are, generally don't keep raising the same debunked points that have been directly refuted with extensive evidence before, that's the kind of desperation tactic that really bad shills are more prone to.
You haven't debunked anything, that's the whole point. Your claims are beyond absurd at this point. They're borderline paranoia. You think there's some big conspiracy to convince miners and users to use Bitcoin instead of BCash. There's zero evidence to support this claim but you act like it's 100% proven. 

If you honestly believe any of that then you have issues and should go see a doctor.
[You keep denying, I'll keep posting proof. Together we can wake up many people who will be utterly confused by your steadfast denial of reality directly in the face of proof you're wrong] (https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8ohc0w/nano_the_best_odds_at_adoption/e05yw4f/) 
Once again, *that* is not proof of anything. You need to raise the bar here and find some actual proof that supports your claims that Bitcoin is a conspiracy controlled by 6 people. 

Where's the proof? 
Yeah. Conclusive proof that said political council defines what is bitcoin as far as the entire market volume is concerned due to exchange decisions is not proof of anything.

Sure. 

You really are funny. The way you wriggle around trying to figure out how you can spin this. 
Spin *what*? You haven't demonstrated anything, you moron. 

Learn how to reason and argue better.
You poor idiot. 
Great argument!
The evidence and argument has been cited multiple times now. It is not in question. The only question is why you continue to deny it despite the clear evidence. And the only reasonable conclusion is that you are a shill.

Congrats on outing yourself. 
Why do you refuse to look at people's evidence? Really man?

This guy did so like two messages up.
Where is the evidence? 

And yes, I am a Blockstream astroturfer. So what? I will send you a screenshot of my pay stub if you don't believe me. I'm currently working at the secret, underground Bilderberg HQ. 
I did look at it. Really man? How is *that* evidence? You are both raging BCash conspiracy theorists, who think that Bitcoin is being controlled by a select group of people.

Open your eyes already. Bitcoin is a market. People are free to exchange their Bitcoin for BCash if they'd like. Greg, AXA, Adam, Blockstrea, Bilderberg, etc. cannot stop people from buying BCash and driving up the price.

It's not happening because BCash is a shitcoin, front-run by scammers like Faketoshi and Roger. It has nothing to do with the conspiracy theory that you idiots want to push. 

Show me some **actual proof**. If you want to be believed. 

And don't assume I haven't already read that idiots sources. He posts the same retarded shit in every single thread that he infiltrates to shill that shitcoin. I want actual proof, not conspiracy nonsense. If you can't provide that, then maybe you should consider re-thinking whether your little conspiracy theory has any validity.

"The incumbent implementation (based on the existing Bitcoin consensus protocol) will continue to trade as BTC even if the B2X chain has more hashing power."

You want to keep going shill? Give me more opportunities to rub your nose in it? 
Bru, you need to calm down.. 
What is *that* proof of? 
Bru, you need to stop pushing conspiracy theories and learn to decipher what does and doesn't constitute *proof*. 

Go shill your shitcoin to someone who actually cares.

Imagine you run a business for nine years. You're a wild success, you get regular salary raises and the product you're building sells better than almost anything in the history of products, you establish vendor relationships with chains all throughout the world, and proceed from strength to strength.

But one day, one of your vendors gets uppity, and decides actually your product is shit, and you don't matter at all. They make a cheap knockoff of it, and they sell it as if it were the original copy, just outright, no "Amazon Essentials" or "No Frills" or anything like that. Just completely lie to everyone that your product was theirs all along, and exert political pressure on all of your other vendors so that they too take up selling the rip off product under your banner. 

Because [they control the channels to the buyers] (https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8ok8vj/monero_can_now_be_stored_on_the_ledger_hardware/e066fng/), their strategy is largely successful, and you have very limited access to the market after their sabotage. You establish relationships with new vendor channels, and this time you even set up your own points of sale so that nothing like that can ever happen again. But you've structured your business for production levels that were tailored for demand at nine times higher than your present output in your new stores. 

The traitors demand that you still furnish them with your raw product, and you know that if you don't do it for now, you're going to go out of business. So you grit your teeth and work for the treasonous assholes, using the proceeds to invest in your new business, and longing for the day you can watch them burn when you pull your product as your network grows to encompass the same trade volume as the previous one.

That's what happened. Deal with it shit for brains.

Read the links above, and from our previous exchanges. 
It's not what happened. You're just a highly paranoid dude. 
I already have, like I said. There is nothing constituting proof for any of your claims. 

Do you actually deny that Bitcoin and BCash are subject to market forces? You really think the vast majority of the market has the wool pulled over their eyes?

You sure that you don't maybe just have a paranoia thought disorder?

Note that this idiot above thinks I'm working for an astro-turfing company. Also, Chris Pacia and BitcoinXio have leveled the same accusation. Lol! BCash is totally not a conspiracy theorist cult though, right? Right?
At this stage you're standing in the sun claiming it's midnight and anyone who says otherwise is a conspiracy theorist. You're just hilariously deluded. Go right ahead with the denial, it just makes you look worse. 
As we've been over, time and time again, short term price doesn't reflect long-term value.

As an example, did Apple stock prices in 1999 constitute what it would be in the future. Well, no. 

Zoom out, also try not close yourself off from all the other links you've been given by me, and it appears many others. 

What would you like to complain about now? Try relax man. 
Yeah I'm totally deluded because I'm the one who thinks that there's a global conspiracy to force people to buy Bitcoin instead of BCash. Right? Oh wait, that's *you* who thinks that. Lol!
evidence is evidence, deny it as much as you like, you just look a fool.

It's not evidence, it's conspiracy theories. Learn to distinguish between the two and you might be able to free yourself from the paranoia and live a healthier life.

I'm here for you if you need to talk.
News articles and press releases from the companies directly stating that they intend to follow whatever the core devs say is BTC regardless of the original definition of most accumulated proof of work is not a conspiracy theory, it's evidence, and you ignoring it just makes you obviously a shill.

I'm not here for you if you need to talk. I don't care about you at all.

No. The articles you linked only indicate that 2X was a highly contentious fork towards the end and is the reason it was ultimately canceled. The exchanges were just preempting the inevitable. 

Why would exchanges be motivated to kill Bitcoin, their main source of revenue? Your conspiracy makes absolutely no sense.

>I'm not here for you if you need to talk. I don't care about you at all.

That hurts, but I understand. You're hurting right now and lashing out because your coin is performing so poorly. It's okay, dude. We're all in this together! :)
They literally say in the exact language I just gave that they are going to follow core and they don't care about the hashrate. You are a complete idiot to continue to deny this, you should instead go with "Well yes they did do that, but it was a totally good and legitimate choice, so what if it fucked the miners and forced them to mine a chain they didn't approve of, they're just janitors anyway of zero consequence, it's that neat core dev political council that really makes this entire thing work."

To which I will respond "Like I've been saying all along, centralised shitcoin. Glad you like the boat you're in, just don't call it something it's not."

> Why would exchanges be motivated to kill Bitcoin,

What makes you think they don't think they're doing the right thing just like you think you're doing the right thing? Giving you far more of the benefit of the doubt than you deserve and assuming you're not a paid shill. So they think the core political council ought to be able to define what BTC is and they make a ruling in line with that thinking, they don't think that's "killing bitcoin". 


> They literally say in the exact language I just gave that they are going to follow core and they don't care about the hashrate. 

Because that's what users wanted. Users didn't want to follow centralized NYA shit, they wanted their good ol' decentralized Bitcoin, not some knockoff. 

>so what if it fucked the miners and forced them to mine a chain they didn't approve of, they're just janitors anyway of zero consequence, it's that neat core dev political council that really makes this entire thing work."

Miners don't call the shots. I don't know how man times I have to explain this to you. Are you retarded? Users (i.e. Hodlers) determine the float supply and mining profitability. Are you really too stupid to understand this?

>To which I will response "Like I've been saying all along, centralised shitcoin. Glad you like the boat you're in, just don't call it something it's not."

Lol, you haven't shown how it's centralized. You're just screaming Core at the top of your lungs for no apparent reason. Where's the proof?

>What makes you think they don't think they're doing the right thing just like you think you're doing the right thing? Giving you far more of the benefit of the doubt than you deserve and assuming you're not a paid shill.

Core doesn't control Bitcoin.

Bitcoin Core is a software implementation that runs on top of Bitcoin. It's fully open source and has *way* more developers than Bitcoin Unlimited and ABC do, combined. Anyone can fork it or spin up another client if they so desire.

But they don't desire because Core has the best developers and are *leaders* in the space. Not dictators, *leaders*. 

Try to wrap your head around the facts, dude! :)

Sorry your coin is once again falling. Don't sweat the ratio though, everything will be fine, I'm sure! :p
> Because that's what users wanted

Finally you acknowledge it is a fact that this actually happened.

As for your rationale, I don't believe you and won't until some sybil proof mechanism for indicating that's the truth becomes available. Until then this is all astroturfing bullshit as far as I'm concerned, but regardless of "what the users want" the way decentralised pow blockchains work period is that the hashrate decides, period. That didn't happen. A central political council decided, therefore no matter what bullshit you spin, it's been hijacked, end of story.

And bitcoin cash is simply following the original plan. And I have no interest in your hijacked centralised shitcoin that very soon won't exist at all. So I really don't care what you think about the day to day movements of prices, or anything about you at all. 
> Finally you acknowledge it is a fact that this actually happened.

Acknowledge *what*? What I'm saying was that 2X lost support and was ultimately canceled because users revolted.

>the way decentralised pow blockchains work period is that the hashrate decides, period. That didn't happen. A central political council decided, therefore no matter what bullshit you spin, it's been hijacked, end of story.

Wrong. Users control Bitcoin, not these supposed "political councils" that your paranoid mind has a propensity for dreaming up.

>And bitcoin cash is simply following the original plan. 

Wrong. Minority chains and EDA's were never the original plan. You're a liar. BCash isn't anything along the lines of "the original plan".

>So I really don't care what you think about the day to day movements of prices, or anything about you at all.

WTF? I thought we were friends. You're just going to ditch me now? Wow, BCashers make terrible friends!

I'm still here for you if you need someone to talk to or if you need a ride to the doctor's office to pick up your anti-psychotics.
> Acknowledge what? What I'm saying was that 2X lost support and was ultimately canceled because users revolted.

Wrong. You're acknowledging that exchanges changed the definition of btc to favor core over the actual definition. You're rationalizing it by saying that's what users wanted, but there's zero proof of that. You state it, I deny it. There's no sybil proof signalling channel to get a final answer so there's no way to know who is right. 

But the original definition didn't care what the users wanted except in so far as the players with so in the game mining and voting with their hash rate viewed out as a good idea. And they simply didn't this time. They were forced onto a chain they wanted nothing to do with. That's a fact and you can deny it until you're blue in the face and it won't change.

> Wrong. Users control Bitcoin, not these supposed "political councils" that your paranoid mind has a propensity for dreaming up.

Yet another assertion for which you offer zero evidence. The fact is according to the actual exchange rules, the core dev council controls it. End of story.

> Wrong. Minority chains and EDA's were never the original plan. 

Nor was hijacking the definition of bitcoin and turning it into a centralised shitcoin. But we play the hand we're dealt.

> You're a liar. BCash isn't anything along the lines of "the original plan".

Says the idiot who lied so poorly he flatly denied evidence directly contradicting his abject bullshit a dozen times in a row before acknowledging it and saying it's totally fine all along. But what would I expect fron a paid shill on a political campaign to subvert bitcoin. 

> WTF? I thought we were friends

Just because you're a useful idiot doesn't make us friends. It just makes you ah easy rhetorical punching bag I am certain will never be able to argue their way out of a paper bag and will invariably resort to the same easily proven false talking points making their side look bad. You're like a self erecting strawman. Even I could argue your side a hundred times better than you. You're just easy mode. 
> Even I could argue your side a hundred times better than you.

Ok, let's hear it. I'd love to see what you're like when you take off the conspiratard hat.
Could. Not would. I'd just hand wave and rely on people being technically ignorant about the specifics and assure them that there is just no way its possible to do global transaction volume on a blockchain. Don't mention just how far below global transaction volume I've artificially limited it, don't mention that limit is part of my business plan, yadda yadda yadda. Pretty much everything you would do if you had a clue about technology rather than just vaccuously hand waving at market sentiment and charts and all this other shit that has nothing to do with what is actually the better product. 
> Could. Not would.

i.e. you can't. Lol! Caught lying again? How many times is that for you? Soon you'll set a world record, I'm sure.


Keep up with those conspiracy theories instead though. I'm sure that's a great use of **all of your time**. It's unreal that you spend 16 hours per day everyday shilling the same nonsense over and over. Doesn't it bother you that nobody cares or listens to you?

Get a new hobby, man. I'm starting to feel really bad for you. BCash is not worth wasting your entire life. :(

I've actually gotten thank you private messages for waking people up. It's worth it for sure. Especially watching malevolent idiots like you trip over themselves with halfwit rationalizations. It really makes my day. You are a spectacular punching bag. Just the right blend of stupid and evil that it is both easy and eminently satisfying without the slightest hint of guilt to destroy you.

So by all means, keep it up. You really do entertain you sad pathetic little creature. 
Thank you messages for *what*? I'm still confused as to your central thesis. You say that PoW works on consensus but also that Bitcoin is centrally controlled by 6 people. 

It can't be both. Which is it?

Also, I consider you a close friend. I don't know why you wouldn't consider me the same. We're besties, right?

Can I see some of these thank you messages you got?

Do you want to do some scrap-booking next weekend?
> It can't be both. Which is it?

It can be both. Just btc is not based on consensus, and definitely not pow consensus. 
What distinguishes one blockchain from the other? Both are sha-256 PoW, right?
In one the pow makes the decisions as the original Bitcoin design specifies. In the other it just rubber stamps the political decisions of the six core dev political council and has no indication of acceptance or denial of the changes under consideration. 
Okay, so, in other words, it works exactly the same.

In the sense that if in one situation, you're my slave and I dictate to you what we do, and in another situation we're partners and must agree on what we do, yeah exactly the same. 

Which is to say not at all the same. 
>In the sense that if in one situation, you're my slave and I dictate to you what we do, and in another situation we're partners and must agree on what we do, yeah exactly the same.

None of this has anything to do with PoW and profitability. Miners chase profit, not ideological battles between Faketoshi/Roger and the rest of the world.
Wrong. When the definition of the asset you mined for the past nine years changes out from underneath you because of a political campaign, that influences both your control and the profitability of your mining. Whether you approve or not you must continue to mine that chain in order to get a return on your investment.

According to the actual design of proof of work blockchain as specified in the bitcoin white paper however, whatever has majority hash power *is* bitcoin. And if that rule were followed, core would have been fired and we'd all be on segwit2x by now. 

Instead we have a split

1) btc. A political chain controlled solely by the six core devs. 

2) bch. A proof of work blockchain controlled by majority hashpower via nakamoto consensus. 

Now you can bitch and moan and whine that one is better than two all you like. You can make up whatever ridiculous justifications allow you to be happy that your chain is a centralised shitcoin by definition, but there's no arguing that the definitions are what they are. 
So, in other words, PoW works exactly the same between the two, right? 

something something mining incentives something something 
Wrong, and if you're still too stupid to see it I'm not interested in wasting my time on you. Anybody with any intelligence at all can understand the difference between action by choice and action by coercion. If you can't I suggest you spend a night in a cell with Bubba, he'll make it clear to you. 
What am I wrong about? Do you not agree that miners follow profit? Sure, there may be some initial ideological struggle and Jihan is welcome to direct his miners to whatever, but if you can't pay for the overhead how does that operation continue long term?
If the exchanges followed the definition of btc as the chain with the most accumulated proof of work, mining segwit2x would have been the most profitable course of action. But instead they substituted that original definition with "whatever the core devs say it is" and therefore mining the chain they say is btc was the most profitable.

This has been explained to you dozens of times now. You have acknowledged it is a fact that exchanges did this, if you are too fucking stupid to follow the chain of causality to the necessary conclusion, there is no helping you. 

It doesn't matter at any rate. BTC is shit and going to its proper value, the original vision will proceed on the path it has for nine years providing actual value, and btc will die completely just as it deserves, with its stupid political council ruling over precisely nothing. 
> If the exchanges followed the definition of btc as the chain with the most accumulated proof of work, mining segwit2x would have been the most profitable course of action. 

That doesn't make any sense. How can one be more profitable before it even exists?

>But instead they substituted that original definition with "whatever the core devs say it is" and therefore mining the chain they say is btc was the most profitable.

Beyond the fact that you're completely off base. What does a fucking ticker symbol even matter? Are you seriously arguing over three ordered letters at this point?

>This has been explained to you dozens of times now. You gave acknowledged it is a fact that exchanges did this, if you are too fucking stupid to follow the chain of causality to the necessary conclusion, there is no helping you.

I don't acknowledge this at all but even if I were to. How does that help your argument? Who gives a shit about the name or the ticker symbol. I'm talking about tech and adoption, which there's no comparison, even Dogecoin is crushing BCash in terms of actual use.

>It doesn't matter at any rate. BTC is shit and going to its proper value, the original vision will proceed on the path it has for nine years providing actual value, and btc will die completely just as it deserves, with its stupid political council ruling over precisely nothing.

ROFL!
