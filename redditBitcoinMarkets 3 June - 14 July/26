**FUN STATISTICS**



____



The current bear market has lasted for **184** days, from *December 17, 2017* to present, so far.



As of right now, this is the second longest bear market. The first longest was the *Mt. Gox crisis of 2014*, which lasted **411** days from *November 30, 2013 to January 14, 2015*.


____



The current bear market has seen a crash *from $19,891.00 to $6,680.10* (as of currently) making that a **66.42%** retracement. If you want to use absolute lows so far, that will make it from *$19,891.00 to $6,000.00*, a total retracement of **69.84%**.


The worst ever recorded crash was *from  $31.91 to $1.99 from June 8, 2011 to November 17, 2011*, making that a **94.76%** retracement. This crash is currently the fifth worst.

I'm not sure if you guys really care about these statistics at all, as they don't add anything very important, but since I love statistics I felt I might as well share this here. I made one of these posts back in March ([LINK](https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/84aitw/daily_discussion_wednesday_march_14_2018/dvpj2lu/?context=3&st=jilavz7s&sh=fa37ffb4)) and it was pretty well received by the way, so you can see how things now compare to the situation then. 


I'm tired, I need a break.

Been here, trading, for a year now. One long year. 24/7 trading this. Been here through rough times. Not BTC rough. Personal rough. Going through even worse personal time now and still trading this. Had a very good strategy lately, it basically got back all of my loses from ATH downtrend. But now I'm feeling played. I'm feeling like I'm gambling. Not because of the price action. Because completely not sticking to my strategy. Not entering on my entry points and not exiting on target points. Need to recover some peace of mind and some discipline.

Cashed out all of my gains lately, left initial 100% in BTC, so I hope it won't collapse :-P

Safe trades, keep calm, see you in some time.
PnF Update

So instead of continuing to fall the to sub $6,000 figure I wrote about the other day, it popped up instead.  Don’t get me wrong, I am thrilled to see a positive break out.  In fact it not only provided a double top break out, it has almost hit the first target level.

The target levels are based on two different calculations.  The first is to count the width of the formation (in this case 4 columns.)  Add that number to the break out point (in this case $6,700).  Four boxes on top of that brings us to $6,850.  We came within $11 of that this afternoon.

The thinking behind this is that the width of the formation indicates the “battle” between longs and shorts.  The wider the formation the more the pressure for a break out or break down.  Its like the coils of a spring.  The wider the formation, the tighter the spring.  The tighter the spring, the more significant the movement when one side or the other moves.

The direction of the move is the key part here.  Since we are in a negative trend the "assumption" is that its going to go in the trend direction.  Right now the trend reversal point is at $9,000.  So, I am going to hope we meander around here for a while instead of dropping.  $9,000 is a couple of months away.  At best.

Over the past couple of years the average formation is about 6-9 columns wide.  Breaking out after only four columns is rare, and it probably will fall back down before it gets up much further.  My thinking is this formation is not “complete” yet, so it if runs back down the column with a fall, as long as we do not “break down” the next movement upwards should have a little more “umph” to it.

The second targeted price for a break out is to go back to the last break out, and simply overlay that on this column.   The last breakout, back at the end of May was fourteen boxes high.  Overlay that on this break out and the top target price to $7,050.  

The thinking here is that the past predicts the future.  A lot less scientific.  But, it seems to work.

I don’t make the rules, I just try to explain them.

These targets are not set in stone and they are not set for THIS formation.  In the stock world the targets are 30-45 day targets.  So it is more a prediction of direction.

So, for today, the direction is good.

I'm a bit sad tbh. I miss the days of last October and November. Breaking 5k for the first time. The S2X fork getting cancelled and the sick pump to 7800 followed by the Bcash fud and huge crash to 5400. The bounce, hitting 8k and just sitting there...starting to realize that 10k is no longer a meme and we will actually break it. Breaking 10k and shooting up to 11...then 12...then 20. 

It didn't even feel real, those last few days of the run. It was euphoria and exhaustion and just so crazy...

I look forward to doing it all again, with an extra zero this time
Extremely tame response to the hack so far.
My prediction is that it's going to confuse everyone forever and never do anything people think it will.
$30M is chump change for exchanges now
The only thing you get pickin' bottoms is a stinky finger.

Not really, but I just wanted to say that. I actually think we're within 10-20% of bottom, so for a simple guy like me, close enough.


What ya'll got to realize is, this aint 2013. The only exchange in existence didn't get hacked. Everybody didn't get burned. We got a bunch more people involved in crypto, and we are literally mainstream now. Everybody has heard of crypto. They have heard Bitcoin. Big banks are all involved. Futures. Clarity on securities and ICOs. ETF filings. McAffee (don't underestimate him).

I still think there's plenty of "trading" to be done. However from an investment perspective, I feel like we are in a relatively low-risk price range. Everybody is waiting for irresistible prices, but those are usually only irresistible in hindsight.

I hope you guys all get to buy in at the prices you are hoping for.
Despite the short term bullish movements in the past day there's been a fair amount of long positions closing. My interpretation of this is that those are positions closing at break-even (positions from the triangle breakdown to 6.7-6.9k). There hasn't been a huge number of new shorts opening yet (in fact, in the past 4 hours shorts are decreasing).

For the momentum to continue, bulls need to defend the area around 6.6k and 10k trend line. Here's the micro view that I'm looking at: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/kIQDWioq/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/kIQDWioq/)

Here's the macro view showing how we broke up through the 10k trend line again: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/Upkyps4M/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Upkyps4M/)

I'm 100&#37; in fiat at the moment. I'll enter on spot if we defend the 6.6k area with confidence, or if the 4H cloud confirm bullish signals (TK cross, cloud twist etc.). I'll only take a leveraged position on bullish 6H cloud signals.
16 June:"We are transferring all of asset to the cold wallet to build up the security system and upgrade DB."

1hr ago: " Due to the increasing safety issues, we are changing our wallet system. Please do not deposit until we notify."

*translation: yo fam, that Shit we did the other day, we need to double down on that. Once again...we got you.*

30 mins ago: " We checked that some of cryptocurrencies valued about $30,000,000 was stolen. Those stolen cryptocurrencies will be covered from Bithumb and all of assets are being transferring to cold wallet."

*translation: yo fam, that Shit we did failed, no worries we will transfer the stole...covered crypto into cold storage. Like always we got you coin...covered.* 
Decided to start scaling into a long here. 25% of planned position added at $6,740ish. I think it's entirely possible that we dip down from here, and I'll add down to around $6,600. From there, if bulls can't defend $6,500, I'm out.

edit: I won't clutter up the daily with where I make adds, if you're interested come back to this comment and I'll try and keep it current.

edit: Since my range where I'm adding is so tight (between $6,740's and $6,600), I just added 5% at $6,710ish)
        Added 10% at around $6,670

Closed most of my short here. Was underwater most of today and when that happens i get antsy to close it at breakeven. This time i managed to get some profit so its great.
Dump has stalled for now and i don't believe the hack news are causing this dump.

Might re short tomorrow morning depending on how the price is behaving.

Going back to sleep now,

Good luck all.

I'm reposting this because I just submitted it before the last daily ended but I think this conversation is important to have:

Not saying that this isn't the bottom, because it could be... But, realistically, we're still making lower highs and lower lows on the daily charts. Still looks like a descending triangle that could very well break down further. This was only a small push back after massive drops, don't get crazy yet. Be conservative, and realize that we are still overall on a downward trend, and have been for many months now. Chart below.

Trying to figure out if this is just part of the chop that we've been having or a legit move upwards. Brilliant job of landing the price in another uncertain position.
Couple of good podcasts have been released lately and in the current trading environment, maybe some of you are looking for content to keep busy. I have no affiliation with any of these.

If you are looking for a podcast to recommend to a friend to explain bitcoin to a five year old (effectively) both technologically and more importantly economically, here is a good one [here](https://soundcloud.com/factor29/23-crypto-voices)

Also, Invest Like the Best is pretty mainstream so this is interesting to hear from a no-coiner perspective [here](https://play.google.com/music/m/Dohajbm7vz7x6gr4q5bvtuiwksa?t=New_Angles_on_Crypto_-_Kyle_Samani_and_Tushar_Jain_-_Invest_Like_the_Best_EP92-Invest_Like_the_Best)

For all the bears out there:

- We have a bearish divergence on the 2h timeframe

- If we don't rally in the next hour, 2hr MACD will cross bearish

- 4h Stochastoic RSI is turning bearish and is currently sitting in the overbougth zone.
shooting star on the 2h. if we go down here, suporrr would be now 6.5k, having buy orders there (this time a bit higher :)
Noticed that we're seeing divergence from weekly RSI that's historically rare

https://www.tradingview.com/x/0pm5cg1Q/

Shorts are steadily increasing and about to cross longs. Even in this bear market that has been a bullish signal.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/XcOuTiMo/

The rate of change on shorts and longs is low. We seem to be slowly setting up bullish conditions. Probably another 2 - 6 weeks for confirmation on this forecast. I don't think we're moving much any time soon.
Never forget to zoom out. We are living crucial times here, this is how I see things playing out.  


[https://i.imgur.com/vejn0rH.png](https://i.imgur.com/vejn0rH.png)
Reasons why I think we have a way yet to go before we turn out of this bear market.

If you look at the history / length / span of the macro impulse vs retracement i.e. every major correction since the inception of bitcoin (c. 2010 listing) you see the following:

Impulse 1 (346 days) / Retracement (164 days) = 47.4&#37;

Impulse 2 (744 days) / Retracement to Jan FY15 (410 days) = 55.1&#37;

Impulse 3 Jan FY15 to ATH Dec FY17 (1070 days) / Retracement YTD (189 days) = 17.7&#37;

Of course that’s not to say we can’t turn around sooner – the market of course has changed / evolved – but if you look at all markets in general – corrections typically last quite a bit longer than 17.7&#37; of impulse.

When you zoom out and look at the gains made over the last 3 years since Jan FY15 – it becomes reasonably evident that the current retracement is set to continue for the time being before reaching for new ATH’s.

In the meantime of course, we range within the overall downtrend channel, responsibly keeping our eyes peeled for opportunities, whilst keeping the above macro perspective in mind.

Happy trading all.

Ps. My current plays are:

Short Entry @ 7,300

TP @ 4,660

underwater (slightly) short calling in.

bulls seem to be defending this dump which is making me a bit uneasy...
Fuck, I had a sell order at 6850 and we went to 6848.2.

(We stopped exactly at the wedge I draw below, if we dont go higher, we have then 3 points of contact).
You can't make this up  https://www.programme-tv.net/news/societe/209269-les-freres-bogdnaoff-en-garde-a-vue/ :D I love meme drama 
Layering some short orders around the level that the first wick got to. I will quickly close them off if we keep pumping past them, but i don't think we will just yet.

I don't think the chop is over, even if the new short-term trend is up. Looking to close on any little profit if we bart back down and will consider a long from there if it looks okay.
F it 30x long its now or never. (Only with gambeling stack) Entry: 6735$
“Oh shit, we have $30m missing from our accounts where we helped ourselves and/or didn’t care during the bull run”.

“Well, let’s announce we’re upgrading our security, then afterwards say we noticed during this upgrade that $30m had been stolen. Use the word “security” as much as possible”

Seriously, [fuck this meme](https://imgur.com/a/NOhPvyE). It's almost as if there really is somebody trolling all of us....
Much of the advice and perspective on here seems to be given by people around when BTC was 2-3 digits with tons of house money to play with, things are much different when you aren’t up hundreds of percent.

To understand the recent market movements I think you have to look to the past as well as look at the people who came here towards the end of last year in the 4000+ range. These people are in a very different situation. 

To those who came late to the party this price is no longer that appetizing without the buzz of a brigade of greater fools for backup, and now what you are seeing may represent people taking a step back until there is some clear mechanism for new dollars...and it isn’t here yet. 

My view is that until you have full regulatory clarity, bitcoin ETFs approved, tether tidied up, and a reason to invest we won’t have the fuel needed to flirt with meaningful increase.
By far one of the weirdest move up’s I’ve seen in quite some time

Almost looks like it could potentially form some type of cup and handle over the next few hours

What happens when the playbook is correct but the player fails to perform. This was the call just a few days ago https://www.tradingview.com/x/JFLu6CtZ/

But I failed to wait for the good entry. I'm expecting 6850 to break and will take my loss there. A test of the bottom of the sym triangle would be next and we might see 7300. If we retrace here I'm expecting support around 6600-6500 and will take the smaller loss there and reassess. But that might be a good R/R for a long.

EDIT: LVN between 6800 and 7100 https://www.tradingview.com/x/VwJlHlPY/
I know its a bit of a taboo talking about Eth here.. but the action is pretty interesting.  Joint broke up, got rejected off the recent downtrend line, and is now testing support.  If it holds up and bounce, it could indicate some real strength in the market.

[chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/W13c5eZ8/)

edit: broke down correlated with Bithumb hacked news... Eth dropped from 538-521 pretty instantly.
Ok, so yesterday the flair in this sub was to go down. We experienced a $300 upward tick and closed about 2,900 shorts. I assume the same audience from yesterday is convinced we will go down again. Why aren' t the short positions piling up by now, as this would be an excellent entry right?

Okay, I'm not sure if I'm going crazy or not, but some of you are absurdly bullish.  It's like the past month and a half didn't even happen.  Sure the last couple of days has been good, but we still have at least 2-3 key resistance levels to call it a recovery (e.g. 1. downtrend line from 10k, 2. previous long term log support, and 3. previous meme triangle resistance).  

A lot of the experienced traders in this sub are calling 7k bounce or are looking for a good short entry.  Even /u/jarederaj is calling range bound action for awhile.  IMO, that seems a lot more reasonable than calling the moon just because we broke up a few percent moves.  

Anyway, I'm not super bearish or anything, but the bull brigades are definitely turning me off.  I'm just waiting on the side as many others are and maybe I'll be willing to buy in if you just kinda let it happen, you know?  Yeesh.

[chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/gx5oID7H/)
Ok so my humble state of play TA wise 

- We are currently smacking the underneath of the 4hour Ichimoku Cloud, seems to be playing a strong resistance role at the moment.

- Top of the 4 hour cloud currently sits at 6950 (binance) so expect resistance there should we break up again

- Forming a bull pennant at the moment on 1hour and 4hour looks the same, love to see it break up but i'm not holding my breath on that one

- The hourly 144WMA trending upwards for the first time since 6th June, 4 hourly still firmly trending down..last uptrend of it was 9th May

- Daily MACD looking like it's crossing to the positive but could of course just mean sideways action 

- Daily Wavetrend has crossed to the positive, last cross to positive was 30th May even though that only resulted in sideways movement mainly until the break down

All in all I still don't see anything major changing, I think in the short term, so the next week, that we could actually go up a bit. Perhaps a retest of 7k.

I see nothing at all to suggest bottom or close to it yet. Still expecting the move up this week followed by another slow bleed drop and then a huge drop again to retest our lows. 


Yeah... Looks like [we’re definitely bear flagging](https://www.tradingview.com/x/DHlmDHz8/) on the daily chart.  📉
I don't know guys, the volume spiked really nicely, but there was almost no follow up. It's really just short/long stop hunting at this point. [Could this be a likely scenario?](https://www.tradingview.com/x/UgSM3hPA/) 
https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSDT/tncAC52Z-Dump-it/

Trade entered. Stop at the top of daily block. 1:6 R/R.
I expected at least 6950 but BTC is crumbling after that double top at $6850ish.. And I thought 6930 was a safe target.. lolol

Couldn't take any profits at the 6800s, so just holding :(
I noticed that the last few days many price jumps start exactly at 12:00 PM (UTC-04:00 / New York). See [this](https://i.imgur.com/ewEYcwK.png) picture: every blue arrow is at 12:00. Looks like some big player gambling around with the market. Doesn't seem coincidence?
It's amazing how biased my views become upon taking a long / short position (although I admit it and don't post BS chart based on it)

If I were holding a short position right now, I would have said to myself, "Everyone is thinking about selling at 6.9 ~ 7.1k. It's simply not going to go up" Now I'm thinking that big green candle a few days ago was meant for more than just a $200 bounce
Alright, seems like we've set the higher high and the higher low. I think that's a good sign.
Short squeeze was over and we closed the daily as a doji under daily and weekly resistance levels. Overall this bounce from 6100 looks like it is running out of steam. My guess is this may play out like june 4th through june 7th. https://imgur.com/MRm55FZ

if I was trading this I think I'd expect the price to find the 12 EMA again

'Feels' (for all thats worth) that we will break up to test 7k soon based on sentiment change im seeing.
Morning Europe.
Next step. 6868
This may end up biting me in the ass but I'm adding to my long here, averaging down, the volume on this dump is small (so far) if I'm seeing things correctly. If the dump starts to pick up with higher volume, I'll bail around $6,400 I think. So far I'm mostly following the plan

edit: Well, "the plan" didn't expect an exchange getting hacked but I am prepared, will exit if there is much more down and chalk it up to something beyond my control.

edit: ended up closing around $6,600 for a <1% loss. 
Even has a bear, I find the timing of this news pretty concerning.
[deleted]
I feel like I'm being played. Took a hit that wiped out my recent gains but closed by shorts. Gonna stay out for a while and see what's going on.

Planned to close it at 6.8 but oh well...
Bart down or break up through 6800? What’s the consensus ol chaps? 
hi friends. im not a total newb to crypto but i do want to consider day trading. im not concerned about the bear market and im pretty confident in my ability to read charts. i just want to know, in your opinion for trading, what percentage increases do you guys look for? i've heard anywhere from 1-5% daily. what do you guys think is realistic?
Look how all these fake buy orders get removed when we go lower on Bitfinex. Dont trust the order book!
ETH is having a breakout right now. Usually drags BTC along with it 30 mins later.

Opportunity for a short-term long scalp.
We are going nowhere with this shitty volume. I dont think a short squeeze is in the making, as we just closed too many shorts and I dont see many new shorts added. A long squeeze is also disputable, as we have seen margin longs kept stable when price dropped to 6200.

Hey guys, 

what are the best trading books you have read? I recently read two Cryptocurrency trading books and a summary of the book "Trading in the Zone". It would be great if the books are available vie Amazon Unlimited. 

Thanks for input!
Just to elaborate on the potential **cup and handle** I posted about before. This is what I’m looking at 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/QdZY39w7/

To include fomo wicks or not ( Red line ), or let the top of the cup be the ( blue ) line.

On top of it looking pretty perfect, the volume profile tends to fit as well.

Low volume consolidation at the bottom of the cup formed by a rising volume to reach the higher high, followed by a volume increase on the handle for a potential breakout.

The handle can also represent a bull flag, which is bullish as well. 

If the handle plays out, I’ll be opening up a long around $6700-$6725

If anyone is educated on C&H’s, feel free to chime in. 

Edit: Too add, this formation rarely plays out and it’s also on a smaller timeframe which gives it less credibility and could be considered chop. 
South Korea slowly but surely pushing regulations -> South Korean exchange suffers a massive stolen 

Something to think about 
Sort of a left field question but do you guys think a potential extended tradewar between China and the US would be bullish for Bitcoin? 
Unpopular opinion: 6000 is the bottom. 
Yawn. This market still has many more hopes and dreams to crush. People need to get it into their heads that bitcoin isn’t a get rich quick scheme. I’m expecting continued sideways action for another week. 
Why is it always Asian exchange hacks?  Are they ever going to get their security shit together over there or is it cover for serial fraud?
I will trade on this one: [https://ibb.co/dw4Khy](https://ibb.co/dw4Khy)

Ascending wedge on the 12h, only two points of contact of the resistane line so far, but the same line was our support when we first brok down in the 6ks, so there is some relevance of this pattern. 
https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/ODD9jFR9-Bitcoin-Analysis-The-Wall-of-Westeros-Wyckoff-Events/

This guy thinks the massive walls are by miners trying to protect 6k. Any thoughts?
apparently we're bouncing back now, it just baffles me
Did anyone watch the 1k sell live?

Not sure if it was wash trading / sell absorbed by hidden buy wall / destroying 100x long
Cooking up some hopium: this price action is extremely reminiscent of beginning of April and if you like fractals you will like this. Marked in yellow: similar trend changes at the top with MACD crossing bear after the second top. Bulltrap marked in red with a MACD bullcross fakeout, daily candles closing above EMA12 with no followthrough. RSI making a clear downtrend line. Marked in green: second bull MACD cross, upwards break of RSI trendline,  backtest of RSI trendline, all of this with Bart Simpson action. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/xSZCLTao/

Bart with horns forming.
So did we actually had a triple bottom ?
How are you guys so sure it will not bart back down like the last 2 dozen times? I set my stops at 6900 and I am pretty confident it will go down again within a day.
RSI levels are cooling off nicely while the price stays relatively stable.  RSI lower at certain price points now than it was 12 hours ago.  Making room for another leg up?
Another bart coming? What a lovely market

And like clockwork, here comes the dump 
Real sexy cup and handle on shorts

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/qz8QHeCK/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/qz8QHeCK/)
https://www.tradingview.com/chart/XBTUSD/VVMbbMxi-Wave-4-of-Primary-wave-C/

I posted a chart yesterday stating that we were about to complete wave 3 of primary C.  Wave 3 hit perfectly to 1.618.  I firmly believe wave 4 of C will make another touch to the green line support and we will have 1 more shot at 6800 before falling off a cliff of death.  Wave 4 targets set in the #goldenzone .618-.65 region
Is anyone still hopeful that we could see that giant triple bottom confirm ( the one starting with our bounce in February )? Or is that pattern pretty much confirmed dead?
BTC and ETH both reached the bottom of the meme triangle earlier and bounced right off (ETH even wicked in).  On mobile, how was the volume on the dump off of it?  
Expecting a Bart down leg soon. Still shorting.
On my phone and on the move. Can some tell me whats happening with that massive (3500+) buy wall from yesterday?
I guess that if there is a silver lining in all this, once you discount the Korean exchange premium, the amount stolen should end up coming in lower.
Finally got the news that'll give BTC a reason to tank. Sorry longers. Bithumb blew it. 

Exiting my alts now.
Strong support forming at 6679, hopefully we can aim higher bcos atm we are just consolidating sideways
Bart Simpson strikes again ...
I've taken my first long position in over a month. 50/50 between BTC and ETH. It looks like this could be the time of maximum opportunity.
Double top
Underwater long from 6680. Any decent supports for a stop loss? Thinking 6480, but there's been a surprising amount of buy pressure despite the news.
Normally exchange hacks means the thief will dump (x) currency on the market. In this case, since bithumb is re-buying all of the assets, that 30 million dollars will be injected into the market? 
Say goodbye to Bart.  Attempted Bart failed miserably. #BartFail

These guys aren't so tough when they're not dumping into low volume on a Sunday afternoon.
Now that we seemingly have past the third bottom post ATH and are on a temporary uptrend (I know not everybody agrees with this but let's assume), the question I have is: Do I perform better by trading than by just HODLing? I've read that a lot of people performed same or only slightly better last year during the run-up to 19k. I'm not a pro trader myself but have learnt some tricks of the trade by following this sub. Yesterday, I missed the green candle and actually lost money chasing after it.
Nice return after that Red leg. 
I've been 100% fiat (HODL stack included) since we went below 7k. It's nice having a break from staring at order books and graphs all day, but it's turning me into a permabear, to the point that my exchange accounts are now all emptied back to my bank account.

BTC is simply not actually used for anything, until that changes, I think we keep going down. It's becoming more difficult to convert between fiat and BTC, not easier, and adoption by vendors seems to have stagnated or even moved backwards.

I cannot think of any reason for Joe-public to start throwing money in to fuel another bull run, or even slow and steady growth. 

I think we need something like idiot-proof wallets, large vendors accepting BTC (with incentives to use it),  BTC becoming the native/default currency in a popular video game etc before we see confidence come back. Right now it's just traders battling against each other. I wonder if there is even enough new money entering the market to cover the fees charged by the exchanges?

I may forever kick myself for this, but I'm waiting for much lower prices to start DCA'ing back in. I fully expect us to see sub-$5k again, and for us to spend quite a while down there.


When Bitfinex got hacked for $72 million, the price dropped something like 25% (not sure exactly but it was a lot).

 I can't think that this Bitthumb $30 million hack will only cause 2% drop.
if arsonbunnies alt count is under 100k by 2020 will gypsytoy eat his ‘dick’ flair?  
Apparently stock market isn't doing so great due to fear of a trade war with China. All these economic uncertainty should help Btc I'd imagine.
wick city
Bitcoin showing signs of strength as predicted yesterday. It will not go lower than 100b market cap.

5% pump. Double/triple bottom confirmed. We moon now. Lambo when?

Stupid bulls.
Shorting is the only way to make money in crypto now: [https://i.imgur.com/htqeNvH.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/htqeNvH.jpg)
My forecast for this week:

- BTC is going up to 7100, then go back  to 6650, trader feel betrayed and short BTC to hell.
- Then BTC close the weekly candle at 7700.
**Where's Jah?!**
Looks like we will moon today! 
Lol, my last comment get downvoted. It seems there are many angry shorter here, bullish signal for me

“ My forecast for this week:

Yo, where my shorties at! Looks like Goblin Town for you guys. The elevation of Goblin Town is just a bit higher than you thought. Turns out Goblins like mountains, not swamps. Lol. You know what they say: careful what you wish for!

Feeling quite good about my long from 6600, especially having already collected the short tax.  No stops. This makes me a winner on 6 of my last 7 trades, by the way.

Remember, folks, losing money trading Bitcoin is all part of the process. Just don't make the same mistakes next time. Listen to the winners on this board, no matter how much they're downvoted by the jealous losers.

Well done old chap
Good bot
I like em, nice work mate. 
this is nice because it puts everything in context for those who don't understand TA at a deep level.
I remember the $32 crash, that was my first boom and bust cycle.  Those were good times.  I miss those days.
Even if stats hurt, theyre still interesting. Keep it up
I would like some stats about year-to-year gains and 3 years to 3 years gains to put things in context, a retarded full FOMO ATH not being a very good reference, as in : what matters is the amount of ppl likely to cash out because they're still up 1000%, not what happened under euphoriax.
These stats weren't fun at all...
Happy half-birthday, bear market!
Well received here anyway, comparing to past crashes gives some often needed perspective
Good post. It's important to remember what happened after those dips.  Does anyone think this one will be any different?
Ya'll got anymore of them 1.99 bitcoins? 
This response is criticism of the apparent fact which is that we are in a bear market. I am not trying to say anything about the future direction of prices, I want to get people to think about whether or not it is appropriate to say that we are in a bear market.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/mu6EaCdE/
The Mt. Gox crisis is a false narrative. It crashed for the same reasons it is crashing now.
Enjoy the time away man. Always here if you wanna talk, hope everything's all right 
Get some rest man, hopefully there'll be a better trend to trade when you come back. Take care!
Crypto aint going nowhere man.  This market is dead anyway.  Good luck and hope to see you back soon!
>I'm tired, I need a break.

Reminds me of myself two minutes into a bang sesh. 

Really though, it sounds like you made a good call and I'm looking forward to seeing you in the future, all rested and refreshed with a new perspective. 

/u/v4mpyre shall rise from his coffin anew
Hang in there, keep moving forward. 
Peace of mind over anything brother. Wishing you all the best in passing this time. Cheers!
Whatever it is you're dealing with, I genuinely hope you find peace & happiness. Wish you the best. Good luck dude.
Have a great break, man!
Hope you get the time and space to recover! Thanks being such a great contributor here.
Nice seeing your name in here again! Good write-up thanks for the update!
Cool to see a TA I'm not used to seeing, thanks for posting!
Thanks
Tldr: the price went up and that is good

I am not at all sad for the idiotic Bcash pump of 09-16 November 2017, I aged about five years in the span of one week
Seems they're covering all 30MM in funds.  So, at worst, it should be a wash.  At best, the exchange has to make 30MM in purchases while the attacker tries to figure out how to launder the funds.
There is some hack every other day, nobody gives a shit anymore. The last months are driven purely by traders who don't give a fuck about such non-news as this
Was just thinking that. Even Bitgrail which was a piece of shit exchange was a hack for $170m and Coincheck was over $500m worth of crypto. $30m is just what they needed to cover their tax bill. 
[deleted]
I like McAffee, he reminds me the 90’s internet
Exactly right.  This is a great time to buy.  Downside risk is as low as it ever gets in Bitcoin, and the upside potential is bigger than ever.

Making money on a short is pure luck at this point and just playing with fire.
> What ya'll got to realize is, this aint 2013. The only exchange in existence didn't get hacked. Everybody didn't get burned. We got a bunch more people involved in crypto, and we are literally mainstream now. Everybody has heard of crypto. They have heard Bitcoin. Big banks are all involved. Futures. Clarity on securities and ICOs. ETF filings. McAffee (don't underestimate him).   
   
This is just hype that doesn't really mean anything. And no we're not getting an ETF anymore we would get one last year...SEC is looking to protect their citizen, so they're not going to allow an ETF of an extremely manipulated asset with no government oversight.   
Big banks don't give two shits about bitcoin until it can actually do something in real life, they're not going to invest in it until it is a success with real application(aka it can save/make them money)..   
Bitcoin was 'literally' mainstream in 2013 too, was all over the news.    
I agree with you this is a good buy though, but I'd say we could go down 50% further, still if you want to hold for a few years this is a good price.


^ Almost a perfect example of totally incorrect thinking on every point, the confidence is just the cherry on top.
 Don't you think this channel has a better validity?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/6lemPlzO/
These fking exchanges always get hacked conveniently in the important times.. I'm starting to wonder if Bithumb deliberately delayed the announcement (or whether they got hacked at all, even)
I might consider spreading out those buys down to 6500 and bailing if 6400 falls: https://www.tradingview.com/x/UlUPdayb/

But whatever you're most comfortable with. 6400 is a long way down from here if you're using leverage.
You can add it to the bot and just send PMs when you add that way you don't have to edit the comment.
Good trade.  You're going to do just fine with it.
Is bithumb hacked? 

Edit: ok holy shet, their twitter said $30 million was stolen
not BTC though, since they aren't being specific I bet it was something like EOS or whatever 
Load the exact same Korea FUD
I'm not sure if this is just something lost in translation but when they say, these assets will be "covered", does that mean they're going to reimburse the lost funds from customers?
Still underwater from CA 6450 and waiting for more (didn't set stops for the BGD though I did close out 1/3 of my position around 6650)
Good for you!
This is why I shouldn't do limit orders
I love this, thanks for sharing.  This is how people don't even beat buy and hold.  It's really hard to do if you are out of the market on those important days!
This is the most amazing thing I've read here in a while. Thanks man.
To be fair; it's not the bottom until it is. 

Nice chart; simple and efficient.
How To Find The Bottom, by isosio:

is the price trading in a stable range?

Were attempts to go lower stopped in huge volume candles?

Have 100,000s of coins turned over in the natural process of a deflation?
If you look at this like that, it would be a "falling wedge"... which is actually bullish.

http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:chart_patterns:falling_wedge_reversal
Who do you think pushes back?   You don't honestly believe demand moved price 5% in minutes do you?  So if demand didn't what is??
Is it ever certain?
Second link no worky for me signor. 
that's not gonna be good for business 
That's crazy, have they been hacked before?
https://www.tradingview.com/x/N7hLqyqD/ 

Bearish cross on the 4 hour with a sell on the TD and it just wicked into the (bearish cloud). Longer TFs don't look great.

EDIT 4 HR RSI at resistance level and we hit the R1 pivot.
Yes, please, open more shorts dear bears
The candle should be red for a "shooting star", but it's green. And the next candle (which hasn't closed yet) should also close in the red.

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shootingstar.asp

Edit: On the 1h it might qualify, though. 
Why is shirts increasing bullish? Trading noob here. Thanks! It just seems like it should be the opposite 
I don’t think the divergence is valid because you used the wick to 6k as one of the contact points. 
I think I saw Peter Brandt post something similar /s
Mastery of TA, a true masterpiece.
Is... is that person with the dick in their butt smiling?
Bravo, sir. Excellent analysis. I just might trade that.
The response in this sub was so much better then at crypto currency. This sub has become my home recently because of it. Anyways- those plays are looking solid, I’m doing something quite similar. Best of luck to you man.
I have a pretty heavily leveraged short from 7500 and a long term short at bfx in the low 9s and my targets are 5K, 4650-4700 and maybe 4.4K (if we get a little extra panic) but I think we'll see a medium term bounce there on a weekly time frame at very least, may even turn ot to be a full recovery.
How far underwater? I expect 6500 again even if we are heading up, which I don't think we are.
Even bulls have to see this spot as kind of overheated in the short term.

Lots of LONGS are closing on Bitfinex.

I'm not saying we go straigth down, but I think you will have the opportunity to at least break even on your short in the next days.
If we aren't under 6400 by days end I would cut losses

Never pick round numbers
Translation for non baguette speakers?
"*ARE THE FUNDS SAFEUH?????*"
100x would be more advisable.
Man, be careful. Entering a trade saying "F it" isn't good.
RemindMe! 4 hours
Too much leverage.  You're just gambling.  But good luck!
And?
If the world was against crypto it would be banned, there would be no ICOs, no exchanges, no mining, no jobs for blockchain.  Yet, here we are flourishing.  Sorry to burst your perfect dreamy world of BTC world domination but sometimes bad things can really happen along the way.

[Edit] and it's ok to think crypto isn't perfect. How else would things get better.
The resemblance is actually astounding. That quite literally looks like a drawing of Bart. 

Is this really only a thing in btc? Not in stocks or forex? 
Did you expect it to break *up* when the exchange hack news broke?
Being up 50% in 8 months feels pretty god damn great, IMO. Imagine being down 50% and buying anyway. That's what 2014 was like. I don't think you understand how, simultaneously, familiar and trivial our current circumstances are in comparison to what things were like 2014 - 2015.
I'm the exact person you're describing (came in originally around $4K), and the current price is appetizing to me and I'm in a leveraged long. I reinvest most profits back into BTC. Just one person's opinion, though and I wouldn't be surprised if I'm the exception to the rule.
The reddit conversation is wildly tilted by the number of people that got in very recently, like above 10k.  I think they dominate the discussion because they have the most to lose and post and talk about crypto a lot because they hope to make the price go up asap.  The people that got in much earlier ($100 range) don't even post or talk about it other than occasional forays into the threads for an amused look as they don't care if BTC is 10 or 20k.  It isn't much different to them and they assume it will always just keep going up because they've seen this before, and let's be honest they are usually very rich.  Of course there are always exceptions like some of the degenerates here that got in early and still stare at charts all day (said in the nicest way).
That's what I was taking about earlier, there's the "down 70% from ath" crowd who take 20k as a reference and the "still up 1000%" one.
K but also like.... people were saying much the same thing around this time last year and well we know what happened.
> My view is -

All you need is enough people smelling dollars again. Effectively nothing changed between $1000 and $20,000 in terms of infrastructure or clarity. 

Alts are easily still proving no one knows or cares about anything beyond the desire to sell it for more than you paid for it. 


Lol, you gonna trade this, CG? looks like some choppy ass water.
I say bart down, but what the fuck do I know.
People are always calling for a CaH but the charts always look like crap. This legitimately looks like the pattern to the T. Interested to see how this plays out in the next hour or so. 
If you look at the eth chart, then it makes sense. btc is just following eth, because there's no real volume in btc at the moment.
Go on?
> A test of the bottom of the sym triangle would be next and we might see 7300.

That would be a break, not a test. We shouldn't see 7200 if it holds as resistance. 
ETH/USD on GDAX there was a 452 coin buy and then 5 minutes later another 452 coin buy. 
It's a fair question and I can't speak for anyone else but I did pretty much what you said. Original entry 6700 3x short, closed half at 6400 then stopped out of the rest at 6550. Now I'm back in 3x short from 6750. 

My guess is there were a lot of bottom shorters that got burned - look how many new shorts opened 6500 and under - and they are not as eager to jump back into a short.
People are waiting to see if this has legs.
Speaking for myself i hate trading this kind of chop and Id rather have a break from trading until the next move is obvious
[deleted]
It is , police arrested them 
how do yall know the news so fast?
I wonder when the funds were taken though?

Bithumb recently changed their wallet setup which I guess is when they *noticed* the funds gone, but could have happened anytime prior.
I get called a permabull because I built MoonMath. It's not like I was saying we were going to keep going up when we hit 20k. At the time I was more likely to say "this is a terrible time to open a position. I'm telling friends and family to stay out." I was saying that the whole last half of 2017. The retrace was deeper and longer than I expected. I certainly wouldn't say that I've been bullish. I've been saying we may be at the same price at the end of 2018 for months now. The Noob DCA runs through the end of the year for a reason: I think it will take that long to average out with an okay entry in this market.
Can you give some examples other than the usual suspects? 

Also, if you want to have some fun: some of you are absurdly bearish. It's like the past two years didn't even happen. Sure the last couple of months has been good...

edit: I should mention that I block people occasionally (bulls and bears), so I don't see everything 
There are 2 users you can put on your ignore list to make this place substantially more balanced. 
> Okay, I'm not sure if I'm going crazy or not, but some of you are absurdly bullish.

That always happens when the price doesn't plummet for a few days.  There haven't been many occasions when that has been true this year.
Thanks that you are willing to buy.
If you guys want to hand your money over to smarter people by shorting this, be my guest.  I'm a bull.  I have valid reasons for being a bull, not least of which is the great returns I've gotten being a bull.  I don't care if this "turns you off." It would turn me off too if I were losing money listening to the people who think Bitcoin was invented in December.
I'm just not sure there's any point trying to apply TA to "Bart" dominate low volume markets?
Not a bad call.
Nessie only has four humps afaik.
Yeah, was thinking the same thing... what would happen if the closed shorts from yesterday would open again today (about 2900)... probably something like in your graph haha.
I always though the stability we've seen over the past several hours is the effect futures would have after the price finally settled.  Maybe I'm overly optimistic though.
I don't think so. There are 2 major difference here:

- The volume is much higher than the last 4 mini pump.
- BTC broke the triangle resistance with high volume.
Smart, EMA12 on the daily has been like the great wall of China for like a month.
> top of daily block

6873 on that chart?
Double top won't confirm unless it breaks 6600. ETH was looking double top yesterday...clearly that is not the case today.
I dunno, when it does a bit of a shakeout dip like this, it makes me think it's gonna moon.
Just be patient.  Channel resistance is 6.9-7.  At the current rate you are looking at ~3 days before reaching the down channel.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/Kjq4Rklj/
Non-conspiracy possible explanation: it's a function of the slope of the upward channel and when the price starts to meander around the support.  The more consistent the sideways/bleeding action is, the more consistent the timing of jumps up to continue the short term trend.

If the price is *65-6600ish in 24 hours, it could iterate again.  A larger jump down instead of bleed will throw it out of sync with your pattern.

Just thinking out loud, not forecasting anything.
Yup, I noticed that too.
It also might be the time when most of the US wakes up and decides what to trade after seeing the past nights trades
I always figured it had something to do with the 1D close that happens a few hours before.
I experience it the other way around after going into position, I somehow develop confirmation bias to reject my original thesis. I contracted this kneejerk reaction from work (science) and it's not exactly helping me trade with conviction.
I'm short but I also think that bullish breakout was a pivot for more upwards action. Daily RSI and horizontal support gives credence to that belief.

At the same token, we broke through the macro symmetrical triangle and also made a lower low from April. I think this rise will be a backtest of the triangle break, at best. Most bulls I see have a price target thats in the low 7ks or so. The bears will return upon weakness and I'd expect most bulls will want to protect their profits too. 
Looks like a nice ol bear flag
Yeah I think we all need to get together and figure out if we really want to actually do something about the alts/vote manipulation issues here, or just keep complaining and joking about them (which in an option too). Mods will only act if we collectively want them to. Thoughts?

edit: To be clear, I'm not accusing anyone specific of anything, but if you think alts and vote manipulation doesn't exist here, then I have a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you...
[deleted]
I just wanted to say thanks for doing this, we need more posts like this in this sub.

Right now its filled with really dumb shilling, where people just promote whatever crypto they hold as the greatest thing of all time and claim the vastly overvalued expectations for its market size or use case, without doing in-depth memes like this.
Can anyone interpret these lyrics for me?  I suck at song meanings and shit.
>High leveraged shorts must be at least a little bit nervous..

I suspect that high leverage traders are always at least a little bit nervous. 
Can confirm.  
But I would be even more nervous if I was high leveraged long. 
I took a small position at 6720 this morning and was feeling pretty good about it following ETH upwards, but after the small pump to 6750, we've floated back down to my entry point. 

Sitting pat for the moment, but if ETH starts to stall I'll likely exit at break even.
It's not even entertaining really. Just meh. No FOMO, bull trap that i don't think caught many folks.
I know this is getting downvoted, but it does look like the opposite of what we were doing all the way down:

Down: https://www.tradingview.com/x/b7vblIVq/

edit to add: specifically the cup-shaped "flag" and wicks testing liquidity in the direction of the eventual move.
Don't know if you saw but $30mm/4500 btc worth has been stolen from bithumb. Cause of recent drop. 

Exchange hacks have been notorious as catalysts for the beginning of large dumps

Do your thing and don't mean to scare you as it could certainly be profitable but just in case u didn't see, I know you like to trade the news as well 
Don't long exchange hack news after a 2% drop. ..dangerous game there.
F good luck to you, sir.  Ballsy AF as always.
This is probably the time to buy, although I can't make that decision myself..

Good luck man!
Pretty damn planned.. like the time we hit the log resistance (Was that Binance hack FUD?)
I'm pretty sure they didn't get hacked.
What news?
New found volume from where? No one but we care about BTC now. No new money here. 
Same boat but I only closed half of my short and will try to see how 6800 responds. If that happens I'm going to be barely above breakeven for June.
You shorted the bottom and this pump was telegraphed by ETH an hour ago.
!short xbtu18 close 6700
!short xbtm18 close 6700
I say up.

Ideally I'd like to see a touch at 6950, then a drop to 6800 and a push through to 7200 with a kindly YOLO market buy with a view to hit 8k at which point people call a triple bottom prematurely and we sail off for another failed attempt at breaking 10k.

Someone used a great analogy of a ball bouncing down some stairs and agree that's how I think the market is right now.
You should target -2% to 2% most days, expecting to mostly wash, with occasional 10%-30% days.

1% daily every day is a lie traders tell.
1-5% daily is extremly good if you can keep it up. Short term dont worry about % jusy worry about being profitable long term in a sustainable way. As you get more experienced you can refine it more
If you manage 1-5% daily, you are a god tier trader.
You should probably not fix yourself some $ gain oriented goal at the start, as you may well be extremely disapointed.


This is how the last big dump started, ETH tried to breakout, BTC didn't follow.
We do not need the shorts to go up.

Steady up ... fine with me.

I read somewhere that C&H pattterns are more relevant for larger time scales. 
This gonna be hilarious if this plays out.
Jesus, it really doesn’t get more picture perfect for the formation lol if it’s made invalid I think I’ll give up on the C&H for a while, it’s been too disappointing haha To be fair though, it is on a extremely short time frame.

*puts tinfoil hat on*

It is a bit sketchy
Yeah maybe they have an unaccountable hole in their finances. (Small hacks/missing funds/theft etc) Now due to regulations decided to announce “BTW we noticed $30m missing. Soz”.

The way it’s worded on Twitter was impressively casual lol


Possibly, eventually but only if things get really really bad.  If the US were to enter multiple trade wars and see the economy sink hard and the dollar inflate there might be an opening to move away from the dollar as the de facto currency of international trade which might create an opening for Bitcoin or another currency to step in. 
I think that will depend largely on whether China devalues their currency or if people anticipate that China will devalue their currency. Obviously if you have a bunch of Chinese fiat, and you think the value will go down, you'd be incentivized to explore capital flight vehicles. Bitcoin (and other methods) have been used for the purpose for years.
Nope. Maybe in 10 years but no one in his sensible mind managing millions or billions of dollars is thinking right now that he should buy BTC when it has lost over 60% of his value in a couple of months. Money flows out the US when everything is going good, money flows back when it's turning bad. That's why the dollar is so strong. A strong dollar = weak Bitcoin. 
Yes, mainly because traditional instruments will go in the shitter and money will seek greener pastures.
Apparently an actually unpopular opinion. 

If we do go down I suppose it may not be until the majority agrees with you lol -_-

Maybe another time for a straw poll 
I wish I agreed, but 6000 is likely not the bottom.  There is just no reason to think it will be at this point.
Bitcoin not being a get rich quick scheme is a hard sell when it goes through periods of extremely rapid appreciation.

Trading bitcoin, or anything for that matter, is a skill.  Most people suck at it.  Just buying and holding bitcoin has proved profitable for most that have done so.
So many people have gotten rich during this crash.
It's definitely not a get rich quick scheme. It took three years to make me rich.
Guys I stand corrected. Bitcoin IS a get rich quick scheme. To the moon! 
Buy ..... wait 1 year  and you are rich
Koreans aren't very good at computer science.
Elaborate?
Well when no one's buying in 3 months at $7k+ because they faked demand they're going  to be holding some heavy ass bags
(hypothesising)

I thought about it too yesterday. That resistance in lower 6ks could have been engineered to resist the downtrend. This could not necessarily be miners. This could be the whole industry. If Bitcoin truly tanked, everybody involved would be immediately negatively affected: other cryptos, miners, exchanges, institutions, institutional adoptions, futures etc. Since those guys makes easy millions a day (if Coinbase makes [at least 2 mil/day](https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-making-2-7-million-day/) likely Bitfinex makes much more), it would make sense for them to spend several mil to artificially stop the downtrend and try to induce the uptrend. Basically, for the sake of the whole ecosystem. There's been a lot of weird anomalous stuff going on.
Could make sense, i don't know,,, but White Walkers (bankers & wall street backers) will try to break this impenetrable wall?  Seriously?
Are we waiting for a delayed reaction or this is just a non issue for people?

Edit:  that was a legit question.  Someone smart please answer lol

Double edit:  bitthumb getting hacked doesn’t really scare me at all.  Now if it was binance or gdax I’m liquidating everything immediately.
I thought it would be a much worse drop as well.  It's very bullish if the market recovers to $6700 in the next few hours after this.
The exchange promised no one is losing their money so there's no reason to panic 
It's not a bounce back to the upside, it'll form a mini-bear flag and push down to $6.5. 
1. $30mm is chump change
2. it wasn't $30mm of BTC that was stolen. It was just 30mm of different currencies. Bitthumb has like 40 currencies that they support. So even if some BTC got stolen, it was maybe a couple mil tops
3. things are a lot more connected now, all exchanges talk to each other, so all those stolen coins they won't actually be able to sell on exchanges. 
Somebody closed big long into that wall.
Dayum that some high quality hopium. I like it and will be considering it. I do think that more shorts is a prerequisite for the dildo that saves the day, tho not necessarily as high as last time, but still higher than where it was the past 48 hrs. 
it’s called a batman
Such a horny Bart...

Sorry, it had to be done...
The usual answer is not confirmed until we hit 11.7k

I think we're going to be in a limited range for a while. I'm not making trades that I expect to mess with in the next 4 months.
....The price doesn't follow the moving average, the moving average follows the price, because that's literally what the moving average is.

Correlation =/= Causation
What's your time length on that MA?

Beautiful chart! 
The price seems to want to go back to the moving average until it doesnt. It may look good in hindsight but not very helpful in predicting the price movements
Cup and handle is an uptrend continuation, not a reversal pattern. Since there is a large dip before, it is not a cup and handle correct? 
What news?
Where's the Bitthumb hack chart?
On my chart, the meme triangle is sitting at ~7150 🤔 when charted via finex..
Good job ^/s
Be sure you have $$ to cover
It's still there. Waiting to be tested.
With every incident like this people are getting less and less phased as it is a drop in the ocean in the big scheme of things. 

I don't personally think well see much of a drop from this..
[deleted]
Good for you.
Keep it for next 12 months and then look
6480 is basically last stand for the bulls but then you have thick support just below that. 

Just cut your losses on any kind of bounce and reevaluate imo. 

There is potential for a capitulation bottom here that sweeps the lows into 5ks.

I have support around here and 6460-80s
https://www.tradingview.com/x/BAg9AT62/

Edit: And by here I meant 6600
Bad luck with this exchange hack news.  Any long position is always at risk of bad news.  Many people here will tell you that all bad news is "FUD" and has no effect on the price, but they are obviously delusional and not worth paying attention to.


From what I've seen with these news, the beginning is generally very hesitant and it accelerates into a sell off as the market "realizes" what's about to happen. Remember the news just broke 20m ago, people are still learning that there was a cause for the drop after buying/longing (yourself included I assume) 

The beginning is generally sort of slow and measured

$6430-50 sounds like a decent place as any. 

If it holds up after $30mm was hacked I'd be pretty surprised but who knows.

Keep that hopium flowing brotha
[looks around]...the downward Bart did stop earlier than it has during the past few months.

Still 3.5% gain from 24 hours ago and large wick. My reckoning is back to 6.8 shortly.


From the way you are talking, I would guess you'll do better in the long term just hodling. Once you're in the green a nice way, start to dca out.
Over time you'll almost certainly perform better hodling, and it's a lot easier on the nerves.  
If you think the time is right and you know the tricks, my advise would be to go for what you think is better.
Yes your premise is likely incorrect.

But if you are a good trader, then trade and if you are a bad trader (but still want to bet on an uptrend), then hold.
For me it is not about performing better, it’s about protecting myself from downside risk. I’ll happily miss a few points of gains to know that I won’t be looking at mega losses if we go to goblin town (especially when I am sleeping!)
I think large institutions will lead the next wave. Right now it’s too difficult for them to invest but a bitcoin would change all that. That’s the only hole I see though in the medium term; short term there just isn’t anything of major substance going on that will change market sentiment from this long term bear trend we’re in to bullish. 

One last though though, with ethereum officially not a security it seems like futures will becoming sooner rather than later for eth. The announcement of bitcoin futures obviously had a large impact on BTC price in the short term. I’m wondering if an official futures announcement might move the price of eth so much that it could spark just enough momentum back in the market to finally go from bear to bull. I understand that bitcoin is big papa but it isn’t unheard of for eth to lead the market direction at times, it is after all the 2nd biggest market cap in the space. 
When you sell and have no skin in the game, you’re able to see things a lot more objectively.
Good luck to you, I'll be buying back in right along with you if we drop that far. However, I'll be trading on the way down.
Maybe they should check their coat pockets
Convert to BTC, Einstein.
Wait for it, the news just got out. Will see more sell off soon.
> Apparently stock market isn't doing so great

You suck at maths.  USA stock market is near record highs and was down less than 1% today.
what makes you think BTC needs help?
Yep, someone is keeping the price right where they want it for the moment. It's pretty bad when Litecoin is outperforming us.

Wow, that’s a lot of salt. Got too caught up in the hivemind. Think for yourself instead of just shorting because everyone says so.

Looks like it's shit post of the day 
I'm bullish but I downvoted you because you included zero evidence of explanation for your forecast.
We might flirt with 7700 today.  We're overdue for a $1000 green daily candle.  If the big bears can't Bart this down pretty soon, it will get away from them in a hurry.
Gloating is super lame. You’re not a trading guru 
You are the kind of person who would buy at 20k hold it for a few years and after it climbed back up to $20,100 come on here and be like "man I have the best trade advice out here, that makes 7/8 trades a success!"

No it doesn't it just means you pick terrible entries and exits and are willing to be underwater for as long as it takes so that you can say you had a "successful" trade to save face

Edit: I think the best idiom to describe you is "even a broken clock is right twice a day"
Real winners don’t boast
If we had a vote each day for "worst comment of the day", this would clearly be the winner today.
Emotional af 
You realize there is a finite amount of Bitcoin, right?

It's literally impossible to keep selling forever... in the longest of long runs with deflationary currencies... Bulls always win.

Whether or not it remains a currency for the longest of long times is yet to be seen... but the price will rise in the long run... as it has done for the past 9 years straight.
Good human
You might miss these levels more one day :(

If you think the sentiment towards crypto/bitcoin is the same now as it was after mt. Gox you brain is very small
Thanks. This has nothing to do with trend. Been doing pretty good trading this chop. I just feel that I'm close to mess this up again by not sticking to my plans. Did this mistake before, not gonna do this again.
Why the downvotes.  I think its funny!
Lmao shit was exhilarating. I don't blame anyone here for wanting that feeling again. $10k was still the best day imo, but mainly cause I was asleep for $13k-$19k. After that it was just ridiculous.. Then the dump day to $10.8k after bch was launched on GDAX was fantastically exhausting
Even a feckless quant could make good money back then.
30MM may not be hard to do over a long time in a dodgy country.

I don't think the coins from the BFX hack will ever be moved. There are too many.
You're talking to the biggest bulltard on this subreddit since yolotrades left us.
Big banks do give two shits about bitcoin, and not because they want to, but because they have to. And part of their approach to gaining control over it is buying up a lot of it. It will drive up the price.

Most people didn't know about cryptos in 2013. Most people have at least heard of it now. Vast majority are still not invested.


There is an ETF proposal where each unit consists of 25 BTC. This prevents consumers but allows big money to buy. I wonder who that would be? (Big banks)


Their business model is at risk, namely their monopoly over money, and the only way to maintain it is to buy it all up and let us play with the crumbs (see: gold).

That's my working theory. Let's see how it pans out.
AXA bought a stake in Blockstream so you might say they are directly evolved.
TA is not reliably predictive.

I'm merely saying we have already retraced a significant percentage, and that the fundamentals are solid. From an investment perspective, that is what I look for.

You guys, the same people that ridicule holders for buying at these prices, you guys wore your spectacles and lecture pointers with graphs and formulas recommended buying at 19k on the way up. Your TA is at most marginally good on very short time scales.

I don't bother with that. I'm not saying I'm right either. I just think I am.
Yes, I think that's stronger and more valid. It's just that the old 10k trend line has proven quite significant many times: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/HSdUffUM/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/HSdUffUM/)

(It depends a little bit on what exchanges you look at, this one is the Bitmex index)
They shorted an amount/leverage that  will make them $30mm profit.
Why was this time important?
Remove your tin foil hat

You seem to forget the gold news which is released during important times also, ie bittrex usd markets 
great advice, thank you. I'll consider that depending on if/how we drop. 
Good stuff, man thanks.  
Haha nooooo the Stokinator kiss of death! Just teasing man, hope it does and was fully prepared for this dip. We'll see if it's legit or not, worst case I bail if $6,500 isn't defended well. 
It’s strange...but my brain and calculator app processed that as only 4500 BTC which is like...nothing.  That’s only a 4 hour dump on Binance.
thought this was fud. nope, its true 
I don't see it....
30 million bitcoin? Holy shit
I think it means no haircut. I.e. it's their loss, not customers'.
That's what it sounds like. 
I agree. This sounds like "oh we lost 30M. It's on us, though". How will the market react to that? No specifics that actual Bitcoin was lost were given.
Pretty similar, my CA is 6500ish. Exited 1/2 around 6700s so that hurt but at least not all. I was waiting on 6850 to break to exit.

I'm not sure if this news is actually something though.
This was just half a Bart, maybe there will be some sideways for a bit before the rest of the retrace to 6400.

Eth seems to have hit the downtrend before coming down so i wouldn't count on any upward pressure from there.

I still believe this is Chop City and will take some time to go above 7k or below 6k.
Thanks for the kind words! Glad you found it useful!
Absolutely, this could be a turning point, but overall I just want to advise caution.  The atmosphere here seems to get very optimistic very quickly.  We can dump $2000 in a couple weeks, then we pump $300 and people think we're headed straight to the moon and get themselves rekt.

As I mentioned in the last thread, this is still a great spot to DCA into a position.  Just don't go ham yet until we can confirm breaking this overall downward trend.  I do think we could still pop up to $7200~ before we start to head back down, so it's not all doom and gloom.

Also, thank you.  Nice use of semi-colons. :)
Nah man we're all out of coins :P all of those millions of coins coins bought at $100-3000 are on the shelves *forever* 
If you ignore the wicks on the daily, then I'd agree it looks more like a falling wedge than a descending triangle.  However, I find it hard to imagine that we're going to have a breakout anytime soon on this steadily declining volume, so I'm more inclined to view it as a descending triangle.  I could be wrong though, but it's hard to push price on the current volume levels.
I'm not sure what the point that you're trying to make here is.  Yes demand can push the price 5%, if the demand is on the side of some whales or a group of bots that are automated to make purchases based on certain criteria all triggering at the same time.
Yes.

bch was not worth .5 btc no matter how much the flippening propaganda tried to sell.
Odd, works for me? Try this:

You don't seem to be my target demographic here.
You are basically counting on whales to rekt the shorts and give you free money, because obviously retail can't do shit about the situation since 20k, that's not very wise. 
Indeed. I like being paid to long.
okay, than shooting star on the 6h, better?
The negative impact of a short is felt on the market immediately. However, shorts are selling Bitcoins that have to be bought back later. When a short closes position, taking either profit or loss, they are always buying bitcoin from the market to do that. If enough shorts close their position fast enough then you end up in what's called a "short squeeze." We had one of those on April 11th.

The market doesn't look volatile enough at this time for a "short squeeze" to be a practical concern. It's more that bears are running out of head room to short the market. At some point those short positions become imbalanced and the market corrects. The speed and volatility of that change is anyone's guess.

Cheers mate - yea BM for the win. Clever insightful people around these parts keen to support each other. Same to you! 
Sound! My long term short entry was 8328 (x10) - think ill hold a bit longer
6655 avg so not the end of the world
thats kinda what im thinking, downtrend on 1W, 3D and sideways ish on 1D, pressure is on the bulls to prove themselves but dont wanna be the bear that gets too cocky.
Longs are closing and shorts are relatively even.  When the ratio are close like this, we seem to pump due to short squeezes.  Atm it's like a 1.1 ratio longs:shorts on finex.
I don't think we're going down anymore. 6.9k-7.2k tonight or in the next 2-3 days. This was weak push back by the bears and I'm unimpressed.. I was expecting a bart with a statement but 6.6k-6.7k is well defended by the bulls. 
ive got a stop at 6876 that i think im gonna stick with but 6400 would be nice spot to take some profit lol
jesus... the fact that people actually go 100x makes me feel a lot more sane lol
the order book had no wall there. so I thought is does not matter. (lol below I wrote never trust the order book, stupid me)

Of course not, mate. I literally saw the tweet as soon as I clicked 'submit' on my comment. :(
> Being up 50% in 8 months feels pretty god damn great, IMO.

Getting tired of the kind of people that is disappointed in Bitcoin because it doesn't make consistent 10% gains on a daily basis.
I don't know if the market will move with you, but your trading skill is pretty solid judging from your recent trades.  You know when to take position, know your targets and stops.  So even if the market move against you, you will probably not take too much damage anyway.  I think the OP is probably talking about the buy and hold crowd or people who are not as active a trader.
I got in at $2700, so pretty close to you. I'm still am mostly out. Its not the price of BTC that worries me most, its the total crypto market cap.

When btc was $7500 last year, the total market cap was 33% lower than now. Still some purging required of scams, is my fear.

The world is not as binary as this seems to suggest.
so if I copy and paste a comment from last year it means we're going to $50k+ then 

Well why didn't you tell me this before. 
> Effectively nothing changed between $1000 and $20,000 in terms of infrastructure or clarity.

I think you have not been putting enough attention.
Yeah, I think we are saying the same thing in a different way.
Probs not. Missed my long opportunity yesterday and I really enjoy the stress free no trade life.

I can have my life back. 
Aren't we barting back up to 7500? :)
Nothing. You stupid^Fuck^Burger
Not much, apparently.
It definitely has some potential. You rarely ever see this pattern.

On the alt ICX 1D chart, it painted a near perfect cup and handle but it failed and never played out. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/ksOAR0zJ/

Not exactly sure how reliable they are 
0.5% price difference
look, the buying trend is stronger
Of course, we test it and if it breaks 7300 is possible. If it fails it could come down hard.
And now there is a 1k sell wall.
Maybe i'm just seeing things . . 
It's really amazing how little of the market seems to know what's going on. The only time we've ever seen a massive amount of positions open up and be right was when those 15k shorts opened before the dump to $6k. And those dudes all closed by $8k.

It really makes you wonder if someone's manipulating this or if its way too big to manipulate on a large scale. 

The stop at $10k was so damn natural and flat lined so hard near the top that it *had* to be natural. There were no attempts to stop it or manipulate it downwards. 

in fact, OKex even had that 3k buy wall from the liquidated short at $10130 on futures and we still didn't go up. 
Where do you see the shorts?
Hehe, and the day after we are all confused - what the hell happened.
Twitter  generally. We all check the news/sub when the price moves 0.5-1% though lol 
twatter. 
Thanks. TBH I was always a bit skeptical about MoonMath, but the longer I spend in the market, the more I've come to see how reasonable the approach is.  I may even start to buy in incrementally with each dip.  I've been following /u/sloppysynapses assessment lately, so my buy in targets are probably closer to his. 

Anyway, thanks for moderating the sub and sharing your experiences. Cheers.
And I really hope so. I would love to add to my holdings ;)
I guess I'm just getting to know the usual suspects, lol.  Anyway, I try to be as neutral as possible and always cheer on people going long.  Sorry, just a few responses got to me when all I'm saying that we don't know where we are going yet this year.
One of them is pretty aggressive and emotional in his response which makes him quite unbullable.
What would happen?  Same thing that happened yesterday: they'd get rekt hard.
Yes 
Zoom out, ETH bounced off its downward channel resistance.  So I expect it to do a little bit of sidewaysish to go back and hug that line, and that it will likely not be dragging BTC up further.
Looking at that chart 7250 seems like the ideal target for the top of this bull trap.
1D closes 16 hours before the candles in question.

Mods of both subs are currently discussing all of this. Meanwhile, admins may or may not have suspended arson for a period of time. Nobody seems to know, though arson has disappeared for periods of time in the past after being called out for bullshit, only to resurface a short time later. 

All I want is some custom flair so that when my senses are tingling in the future, I don't have to defend my credibility at every turn. I caught Dushman and, more importantly, I caught arsonbunny. I want a badge that says "vigilante detective".
I find it very useful, when all bullish or at least "careful shorting here" comments are heavily downvoted, it's time to go long. When "this doesn't look sustainable and volume is drying up" are downvoted, short.
Hey, I'm not gypsy and I don't know the guy. I've never even met him actually. But yeah, I thought I'd chime in.

lol your tactic is pretty questionable, but your execution is flawless. can't deny that you seem to be right all along in your crusade.
no sock puppets or trolls on this sub confirmed
Might consider reading all the comments on this to get a sense of what's actually going on here.
In some positions more than others.
Leverage is irrelevant (not something to worry about) if people know what position sizing is.
Can't speak for all longs, but I use low leverage (3 is the magic number). Was underwater on this trade for a day or so. Did not make me nervous at all.  

You might get lucky.  This might Bart down.  But if it doesn't -- and the top of Bart's potential head is starting to look like a rounded bottom, not so much a Bart -- you'll wish you were on the right side of history (long).  I hope the lesson won't be too expensive for you.
ETH seems to have the downtrend line from 840 around 550 (on Kraken and BitStamp at least). That should be an important area to watch for if ETH keeps leading.

So for BTC isn't to keen on being dragged up but that can be due to people shorting BTC more than they are shorting ETH.

I have a small short @530 and will keep it for now, maybe scalling out if 540 is broken
No FOMO in either direction for a while now.  BTC becoming a one pump/dump chump.
Someone keeps hitting 'Undo'
BTW, if you look at 4-6h chart this might look a bit like ihs almost completed.
More useful to compare it to $7750 and $8600 and $9990 etc

yeah thanks man, I just saw that, good chance I'll bail if there is much continued follow through 
Thanks bruv. Yeah, you could be right. I'm going to watch for a bit longer and see what happens, fucking bitthumb l33t hax0rs screwed my long 
Your point about their tax situation coming into light not long before this suggests this indeed may be a... you know... coincidence /s. If they report criminal loss of 30M and they are insured (and likely they are), this may help them cover those millions of taxes they owe. Just a thought.
30 million $ Bithumb hack
They will care when it rises back tho. Look at the volume of the climb last year. I think until 11k not much changed compared to the volume in this bear market if I remember correctly.

I think thats also why a lot of people here want that 11.7k BTC mark. Before that its just the same people playing.
My mistake was not setting stops above the triangle. Would exit at BE then. Hard to trade here because all the fake outs.

Well. Shit happens. Wiped some profits but not the end of the world.
You can't be right all the time.

Since the Feb bottom it's actually a ball bouncing on a straight floor (and loosing steam at each bounce).
A healthy steady growth with some retracement before more continued gaines as opposed to one massive BGD that corrects weeks later?! Madness lol
that's helpful, thank you!
this is helpful, thanks.
so what do you think is good?
well i guess i'm asking to know where to put your limit orders and such. you go in wanting to make an increase, correct?
True, but the April bottom was kick started by ETH.
Sure, and without the shorts, we need new volume inflow. Don't see that yet with the FUD lately, but I know how fast the sentiment can change with BTC.
Isn't every pattern more relevant on larger time frames?

Yet on micro levels, a lot of them often play out well, too...
probably in the investopedia article that first comes up if you google "cup and handle pattern"

What's the law out there, can they at least in theory write off a loss like that off their taxes?
Yeah everyone with sensible mind better sell at 60% down and buy again when it’s back up smh

In all seriousness in turbulent times money flows out of speculative assets (i.e. Bitcoin) and into liquid safe havens (i.e. Cash and treasuries)
Bro once I voted 5999 and the other time 10001, we haven't made it to any of them yet haha. 
Well it's been the bottom twice, if this bounce turns out to be significant that will be three times. That's a reason to think it's the bottom. Time will tell, but it's not a crazy idea at this point.
Yeah there really isn’t much hope to hold on to. The chart is a slowly dropping down and to the right. 
And if we want to look at longer time-frames, there is literally no one currently who has held bitcoin for more than a year who has anything less than 2x gains. 
I am not so sure that buying and holding would've worked out well for anyone this year since we are close to the lowest levels that's only been reached 3 times or so this year.  Your statement would be pretty spot on for people who've bought in pre-November last year though.
Buying and holding a depreciating asset is a surefire way to lose your money. It was a solid strategy during the last bull run but it's terrible advice now.
Yeah, the ones who bought it up. The ones who caused it... not so much.

In a year, this will be clear even to the dumbest bears in this discussion.
Upvoted because that was funny and I assume it was a joke 
what should I elaborte? Having buy orders at the support line and sell orders at the resistance line...
they are already as big of a bagholder as anyone could be
Well, first Mr. Bear Whale has to go OTC for like $1 billion in BTC.  This might take about 5 or 6 hours.  Then he has to contact his media friends and tell them to cue the Korea FUD (TM) and Bitcoin is ded FUD.  Then we will be ready to have a proper and timely "panic" dump.
[deleted]
All of that sounds like a bunch of speculation. How do you know it was more than one type of coin? What makes you think that the thief won't mix the coins? What makes you think exchanges will blacklist the coins?


A 1000 btc long opened up the other day at 6.5k if anyone remembers. 
No doubt, the april BGD was very much influenced by shorts and this component is missing now
It looks like the sentiment in this sub changed within 24h from year long bear market with $4xxx as goal to full bull run $40k
FLANDERSTAB: financial leverage and nominal debts encourage radical technical analysis of Barts.
often it is just a slow bleeding down
His point is that there is a pattern with the price tending to magnetize back to the moving average and it doesn't necessarily reflect anything meaningful long term. 

In other words, it seems the moving average has to "catch up" with the price when it moves too quickly. 

I don't think he was suggesting any cause/effect. It's not a particularly controversial statement either way really
It’s leaky in here 
Dude I'd be pretty fukn stoked with break-even right now
Depends on how you look at it I think. If you look at since Feb of this year, the trend has been up and April was just a large dip: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/GyBnKra3/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/GyBnKra3/)
The hack was just FUD.  It doesn't matter or even exist.  Twitter is not real...it is FUD.
Hack or no hack, seems to be on par with my TA. 

I don’t think it’s really really that big of a deal. The pattern though is on the daily.
Sorry, on mobile.

Yeah, I have it at the same place for BTC.  ETH wicked a little higher % this morning.  
It has however just decreased now, looks like a big long closed into it (?)
Thanks!
Is there some kind of an indicator that shows buy/sell walls? For example, if that buy wall is on bitfinex and I don't have the account there to see it, nor can zoom out that far on the tradingviews order book, what are my options?
I totally agree. It seems that whenever there was news like this earlier in the year there was a huge drop as people panic sold, followed by a huge pump of smarter money buying up cheap coins.  Now, those who are still holding are much less likely to panic sell because they're not new anymore and have seen this so many times before.
If I waited until I was sure about everything, I would never have made any money. It's called risk for a reason.
The thing is $30 million dollars is chump change given the whole market but people still run around with their hair on fire.
And an exchange will not fake a hack as some people here believe.  It's like a pastor wanting to cancel one service by telling everyone he molests children.
>Frankly, nobody has ever proven factually that hackers "dump" their stolen coins on the open exchanges.

There's Vinnik and BTC-e, which is the most significant exchange hack of all time.
> Frankly, nobody has ever proven factually that hackers "dump" their stolen coins on the open exchanges. In fact if I had to wager, some of them might have been savvy HODL'ers throughout the years and cashed-out at the peak in Q4'17.

Well, they could dump them and short the market, then buy them back cheaper along with insane profits.. $30m is enough to move the market a few hundred or thousand dollars.
Aren't you the underwater short expecting 6500 above? Because I'm up on my long from 6530.  So who's smoking hopium, and who's making bank in reality? 
Homer finally chokes Bart out. He's been pushing his luck for months now.

*Why you little-*
:thumbs up: Yeah, I'm treading lightly these days. I got badly burnt (13% down) on the BRD (6/10). 
user name does not check out.  That being said, I'm in 100&#37; agreement.  Any backtest that I've run on a strategy for BTCUSD ends up underperforming hodling during the bull run of 2017 (unless of course I apply a look-ahead bias to have it give the results I want, which would be pointless), but catches back up when it doesn't sit through a 60&#37; drop.
Disagree. You just have the opposite set of biases. You're no more objective when you're holding dollars. 
This is such a true statement. 
Doesn't matter...$30 million.
They didn't say BTC needs help
LTC was above 100 when BTC was fighting 6500 and ETH fighting 500.

BTC is now 6740, ETH 535 and LTC still below 100 (that was a strong support now turned into strong resistance).

I don't see how this is outperforming BTC
>Bitcoin showing signs of strength as predicted yesterday. It will not go lower than 100b market cap.

Yeah, they are fucking annoying.
Note: i am usually right 

besides i said tomorrow it looks sunny 
Nevermind i didn't look properly.
Been short for months now
False.
His post history reads like a crude attempt to fool sentiment bots.
Nice photoshop :P
Whoa... noice. 
Lel, there is no evidence need dude. 7100 is the first resistance, 6650 is the nearest support, 7700 is the gap filling expectation. Easy to understand.
He did give a reason: Angry shorters arbitrarily downvoting him.  I agree with him that it's a bullish signal.  Bears are losing it.  They have nothing in their arsenal but sock puppets at this point.  Nobody with half a brain is selling, lots of people are buying. They're freaking out.  This is bullish, and it is every bit as valid as any line somebody drew on a chart from one random point to another.

So go ahead and downvote me.  I'm still up nicely on my long and expecting a big gain.
Wondering if you left out the /s. You cant be serious, the last true BGD was due to a short squeeze of epic proportions. I dont see the dominoes in place for *another* legendary event. 
You are right on both counts. I'm categorically  opposed to gurus; if you can't figure it out on your own, it's not worth knowing. Gloating is lame, and I didn't mean to gloat. Believe it or not, I'm trying to help people who have been misled by the PR talking point sockpuppets on this sub with their "goblin town," "delusional," "bag holder" prepped talking points. They're costing people a lot of money, and it pisses me off.
There is absolutely no guarantee that the price will rise in the long run, nor that bulls win.

You'd classify it as a 'win' if we dropped to $50 and bottomed out before going to $55 and staying there? Nope. 
Meh Im dead inside now... :)  Nothing like the thrill of your first giant gain and the super sadness of the first pop.
So how are you gonna spend your mad gains? Cocaine? Hookers? Go to Mexico for hookers and coke? Gotta share your exploit with the sub and let us in on some good feel :-P
Yeah what the freak
I joined at 17k. It was pretty awesome for about 4 days :)

Banks are interested in anything that can make money. They see Binance (not even the market leader or largest exchange) make as much money as Deutsche Bank and they can't resist that kind of cha-ching. 
They dont, they only care about blockchain. Bitcoin is useless for their purposes atm. If we had 10000tps and mainstream retail vendor adoption then it would be a different story...but we dont
admittedly not as important as the last time we were below downtrend line but we were still in a bull flag (despite the double top) and it barted down
that way, if anyone follows you they can get notifications on the pushbullet app every time you alter your position
I know, but the korea FUD is very effective during this low volume market. A catalyst to dump since we're going sideways.
Saw a high number of unconfirmed transactions, knew something was up before this drop, fk should have short it.

yeah, no
I thought we were bound to go down regardless of news, was just what pushed it over
The sentiment seems to be that these pumps are good times to short, no one is really bullish, and right fully so. It is simple, the trend is down, the sentiment will be bearish until trend reverses. This is on the larger time scales. On the lower time scales we maybe somewhat bullish.
It’s 2,5x the volume as this time last year and there didn’t seem to be an issue pushing price then with less volume so why would there be now? Not that we are going to break up I just don’t think that volume is the best indicator. Volume lags price, it piles onto moves and magnifies. 
Or it's just stop hunting all the way down.   There's no ticker in the world looks as broken as bart-heavy BTC.
Same, says podcast episode not available. Might be a location thing. 
And you are basically counting on whales to drop the price and give you free money since retail has obviously done selling at this point. 
But.. but... *Institutional money* is coming soon, right?  Right?

You can't chop wicks when measuring divergence though, because rsi is calculated on candle closes. On the weekly the close is extraordinarily lower than that first wick, it's clear that rsi will be lower because of it 
I was not aware of that. In that case, good eye.
but isn't rsi calculated with closing price rather than intra-period movement? why is it different for the weekly timeframe?


Very different view if you use a line chart though. https://www.coinigy.com/s/i/5b292bfaeaec7/

Not implying that invalidates your argument but it's something I try to keep in mind. Every time we dropped down the weekly close was lower than the last time. 
Apparently. 
Oh, yeah, I wouldn't be too concerned about at least being able to walk away at b/e. 
There you go, man. Breakeven stops if you don't want to go underwater again. 
Close now and go long.  Thank me later.
Of course. But I don't think being a permabull at the moment is the best way to capitalize on the market.

I think a lot of bulls will sell at key points and let the market drop to see where they can buy back.
There could be hidden orders or people may throw orders in last minute (especially emotional traders). I always go $2-$4 off the number in whichever direction I'm coming from. If you want the entry/exit enough to submit the order, chances are $5 off of it shouldn't matter.
exactly. I am french and they are heard for scam
nope not yet at least
So much this.
I appreciate the kind words, brotha. I know what you mean about "passive" investors. I will say though that literally every single person I know who bought around that time has not sold, but they also haven't bought recently (that I know of) which is illustrative of OP's point about new money.
The “HODL waves” analysis would suggest it is closer to binary than a gradient and it revolves around high volume purchase nodes.
to be fair, he's just stating facts and basing his opinion on historical precedent...
I'm not trying to tell you anything, your post is just a long way of saying "it's different now" but it really isn't that different. Bitcoin has had long term down trends and will again in the future- facts are if anything saturation has gone from .1% to 1% (yea I'm making the numbers up) which is still nothing in the grand scheme of things but your post asserts that we should all pack our bags up and go home

to which I say, don't let the door hit you on the way out
That would be good :D
Haha it’s funny you mention that because that’s my largest holding. I was eyeing that like a hawk but unfortunately it failed to break. 
> it painted a near perfect cup and handle

It's largely due to euro dropping vs usd again.

If we test it and it breaks, I don't see why we don't retest 9K. The Hopium/FOMO would flow strong.
Someone wants to short at 550.?
I'm not great at looking at the order book.  I might look at it just to see where I can place my bids.  But, you may get some a bit of a lead time on immediate moves if you are good at reading it.  With that said, it looks like it's [holding](https://www.tradingview.com/x/WRYM83kh/) up pretty good, and we will probably see some action real soon.
This is exactly what I often wonder. While It would probably be naive to think that there is zero price manipulation going on in this market, it is questionable how much impact such manipulation really has. Are those who use those tactics able the sway the medium or long term trend in their favor, or just produce a spike here and there? This question also connects to the whole "tether pumping up the prices during 2017" theory. Did the indisputable mania that took place in that time have no effect on prices? Exchanges being shut down for registrations due to too many new users, CNBC pumping crypto, everybody and their mother buying in... It was natural for prices the pump the way they did. As it is expected for them to deflate now, after the parabola.  
Bitfinex posts them to tradingview.com under the symbol btcusdshorts
I've been telling people since last summer to watch how wided the rainbow is. It's fucking huge. Azop made it, and it's brilliant, but it paints a medium-term future that's pretty easy to realize. The range on it easily encompases every possible price of bitcoin for at least the next two years. Bitcoin just needs to go to 20k before the end of 2019 for the projections to work out. So, in a sense, rainbow charts say nothing. The moon math projections are there for people to reflect on the implications of past performance. Right now, our performance since January 2017 is basically identical to our performance since January 2012... which is mind bending to reflect on.

If you didn't already, install RES and use tags and note how many up/down votes you've given.
Oh no need to apologize, man. You're just pointing out what you're seeing and that's good for everyone imo.
Do you have a chart? My downtrend on ETH is @555

I've seen some people claiming the line had already been broken, so there must be differences between exchanges or my lines are drunk
1hr chart for ETH looks like a rising wedge, I have a feeling it's going to attempt/wick up to the 26 EMA on the day chart. That would put it somewhere around 555-560
lol, this kinda sets you up for flair that says "Dick." I'd put a badge on it. Could also be a big green dildo.
While it's true that the mods are currently discussing this, I think it's important for people who want something to be done to be vocal to the mods. There is only so much they will do without more feedback from the community. On the other hand, if the community collectively doesn't care, then neither will/should the mods. 
I've never understood why arson keeps posting on his account, pretty much all of crypto reddit knows about him now, I don't see the "pros" to using it, it doesn't carry any weight as an analyst, it actually goes against any hope that what he says should be taken seriously or listened to.  He obviously has no aversion to using or starting other accounts lol, why not start a new one with a clean slate?
I like you gypsy, you're a little abrassive, but you aren't an asshole. I have a science background so I have a lot of respect for  people who can back their shit up with facts. It's hard to tell everyone the world is round when everyone else says it's flat so good on you man.

This pattern is both unreliable and difficult to prove the reliability of. It's just something that seems to resonate with the general sentiment of this sub. I'm not even sure what you're arguing for, here.
right but if you have one person with seven alts downvoting/upvoting then the data is useless, no?

Are you saying we should turn a blind eye to alt accounts and vote manipulation because the good derived from those "indicators" you mentioned outweighs the bad (comments getting buried, nonsense responses with ad-hom attacks, etc)?
Fuck me, the vechain got me.  Well Fucking done, lol
LOLOLOL
This whole sub is just gypsytoy talking to himself on various accounts
lolol
It's basically [word for word](https://www.removeddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7osoap/_/dsc4rtf/).
Gypsytoy was permabanned in the process. He almost got permabanned a second time. He really stuck his neck out over this.

On the other hand, this seems to be clear evidence that people do manipulate sentiment in CC subs, even (especially?) this one. Showing that an account is doing that is difficult. It can't just be GypsyToy who watches for this. Mods don't have any special tools to sniff this stuff out. It's very likely that there are many other accounts who are up to the same funny business but they're much better at it. It's likely that the suspended account has only learned how to do this without getting caught in the same way.

Report and communicate with mods when you see suspicious activity. If your issue is above our pay grade (in this case it was), please collaborate with us so we can understand what behavior clearly and concisely document the pattern you're observing in a way that lets us pass information on to admins to process and administrate.

Let's work together to keep this kind of stuff out of the daily.
It doesn't look like anything to me.
lol, i'm just trying to not miss out on the hidden meanings :-P
I agree, and I'm prepared to face the consequences if we go above 6900. I might even exit if ETH doesn't pull back soon. I'm in the green now, but tummy says stay put.
On the day chart, the EMA 26 puts ETH at ~560 (also close to where you are calling the downtrend line), I don't expect us to break it, but the very least we wick that high before heading back down/move sideways for a few days (like when btc was at 7750)

Although crypto has made me look like an ass in the past so let's see if it actually happens! I have several sells starting in the high 540s up to 560.
This all seems a tad bit dramatic for a $50 dip. I saw these comments and got scared I missed something serious...
That one I drew last week? Definitely a bit wonky if so, but the end result is about the same.
Hey Sloppy- I know your interim target for bottom to exit your short(s) is between $4-$5K. But I have not seen you discuss if you would deploy additional capital there on a long (leveraged or not) or just to exit your current position. Assuming the latter? 
Man, we need a MVP flair for /u/sloppysynapses 
Conspiracy everywhere.
Agreed, that was the smart exit. I think that’s where Haserfauld got out. I kept thinking that 6800 was a possibility and accepted that risk but it’s funny when you actually are underwater. That’s why I scaled out. 

At least I had the instinct to cancel my staggered sell orders when I saw the L:S parity and thought this could be violent. 
Yeah, healthy steady growth from all the outside dollars coming in to the space /s. 
Truly the best approach to trading is to use TA/charts to determine the best entries in terms of risk/reward, take your entry (don't chase or force it), and cut losers and weak winners quickly. When you get a good entry, you'll know it, and then you can just hold. Most traders (myself included sometimes) get married to their positions and hold them even when the market tells you not to. 
Never mind. 
>well i guess i'm asking to know where to put your limit orders and such

> im pretty confident in my ability to read charts.

Yeahhh...definitely don't start with leveraged trading.
..? hmm...eth closed 15,000 btc shorts on Bitfinex...

I don't think it was eth that caused the literal highest 1h volume candle in btcs existence 
Correct
... and a lot of them don't.
We have a lot of textbook formations lately...
Mine won’t come off now lol
So many people upvoting you... Shows how much people here know about economics or global macro trends lmao
[removed]
I'd normally agree but this speculating is effectively on being a reserve asset. I'd be surprised if BTC took a bit hit from trade war news. In fact I agree it would be bullish and that people will look to crypto for a sovereign resistant currency (particularly bitcoin with its immutability). 
Has Bitcoin ever obeyed the rules?  People will see Bitcoin holding steady or going up while watching their IRAs and 401Ks tank.  

EDIT TO SAY THIS TOO:

Bitcoin was invented as a response to the 2008 crisis (see genesis block).  We won't even know if it works as intended until everything else tanks.
LOL so you're one of the guys that make this sub look crazy 😋
It's been the bottom more than twice.  It is probably the bottom, 100 times a day, depending on your time frame.
That is clearly the larger trend and BTC fundamentals are crumbling as well, so just not a great recipe for a price increase.
Correct. Time is money.  The more time, the more money.  Best thing to do is buy some, send it to a cold wallet, and forget about it for a couple years.
Buying and holding is not a short term strategy. If you want to cherry pick a short term period of time then yes, people may have gotten crushed.

If you want to check back on those people in 5-7 years and they still lost money, I think it's then fair to say their buy and hold strategy did not work.
If a person bought BTC anytime except in the last 7 or so months, they'd be doin alright.
People were saying the same exact thing 1 year ago when we came down from 3k.
Buying and holding will work out splendidly for those that actually hold.  In fact, this manufactured, manipulated dip will be seen as one of the greatest opportunities since the land rush of the late 19th century in which great fortunes were made by the intrepid.
I don't think you understand what that word means
Depreciating?  Since when? Oh, yeah, you probably only heard about it in December. It's been around longer.  It's fallen further.  It does not depreciate. 
There is as much money to be made in a bear market as there is to be made in a bull market.

You just need to trade accordingly.


Who caused it other than collective greed? 
I was being serious.
Thanks!

Before you ninja edit there was only "I'll trade this one" ;P
[deleted]
because if it was just one, they would have mentioned that it was that specific coin that got stolen

if the thief mixes the coin, he'll be swapping them out for monero or some other untraceable coin. So all those alts will dip while that one coin would go up
nothing goes down forever 

noone is saying this will go to $12K now just because. But a dead cat bounce to $8.5K is quite possible. 

Thats because we haven't been back there since we broke down and started crashing hard. And $8.6K should be where the main resistance is because thats where a bunch of people opened their longs 
That is usually quite a bearish event. Remember at 7,600 when everyone was claiming "higher lows", "bears are running" etc.
I'm not saying this is the bottom, but by definition the bottom is the precise moment when a bear market turns into a bull market. 
I don't get people repeating this. I've been lurking this daily discussions for the entire year (they're super entertaining) and I've been watching the crying and gnashing of teeth as every permabull now turned permabear starts shitting on bitcoin and crypto.

It seems you just read one hopeful comment and go:

wow, look at all these bulltards here!
[deleted]
Lol I'm taking a guess you are under water long?
I'm saying the dump right before your cup and handle makes it not a cup and handle.  The whole ideology of a cup and handle is a bullish breakthrough at a resistance level.  Therefore, a cup and handle is directly preceded by an uptrend. The fact this "cup and handle" is preceded by a dump basically invalidates everything that a cup and handle is suppose to be. 
Actually this "hack" doesn't even rank as FUD because it instills no fear, nor increases uncertainty or raise any doubts.  You know why?  Because at best it is $30 million in probably assorted currencies which is nothing, nothing at all.
Either way TA/charts can't predict violent events in a volatile market. Sometimes we see what we want to see in technical analysis charts, like trying to predict the weather.
Erm the hack is very real, there is a big difference between "FUD" and verifiable events happening in the real world. 
Your TA. Thank you for the good laughs.
Yup, saw that. At least we know it won't be pulled ;P
https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/books/USD
Yeah totally, plus as more and more exchanges open there is less emphasis on certain ones having security issues. 

In the Mt. Gox era (the only exchange at the time) news like this was devastating. Now its just bad press for the exchange in question and rightly so. 

It shouldn't affect price, its like a bank getting robbed and the dollar dropping 


Nice analogy. Bravo.
Ummmm... what?
I'm not underwater short. 
Yup. Bart was fun while he lasted though.  RIP Bart.
I am sure you can look back and find times where you will be like *'Oh if I would have done that, I would be in profit right now.'* Understand the reason and logic behind those calls and try to implement them moving forward my friend. :) We all lose some and make some.
Yeah, buuut if your end goal is to buy back in, you’ll naturally have a bearish bias as you *want* the price to go down. There are plenty of people who have sold (with the intention of buying lower), never bought back in and regret it.  

If your goal is to exit crypto completely, then I’d say you’d be able to view much more objectively. 
Consider attending courses, maybe.
Who are they?
I was only referring to the shorter time frames this morning. Not as a whole. Add a dash of sarcasm to any post that I make comparing other coins to BTC. 
Oh, Argentinian pesos, thanks.
Note: no you aren't. You tend to try to spread fear based on essentially nothing. That's called concern trolling, bro.
For months? So you somehow kept your short all the way up till 9900 in early May without getting liquidated? Why do I find this hard to believe?
it's just from testnet lol
it's testnet lmao. give me a hedge fund boys i got this 
You should have put that in your post then right?
Thought 7200 was resistance?
I meant he didn't include an explanation in his original, downvoted post. It was just a naked forecast.
so i take it you don't believe that we will break 6k and that the bear market is over?
You don't provide any kind of analysis and basically say "longing here, you're a dumbass if you dont". 

Wouldn't really call that helping people
This money had a purpose before I even started. Still only at 20% of the target.
Lol me at 19k ..I saw a profit for about half an hour before about 5 days of pure denial
Wait, I can't call even myself a bulltard?

Interesting example: [Deutsche Bank hasn't made a profit in 3 years](http://money.cnn.com/2018/02/02/investing/deutsche-bank-loss-us-tax/)

Binance BFX et al no doubt make lots of money, because they are outside regulatory reach. Banks would not be so fortunate, and if BTC ever becomes relevant to global commerce, exchanges will have to fall in line as well.
>they only care about blockchain.

Why do they care about an inefficient linked list when they can run private databases much faster and cheaper, with the mutability essential to banking?
We were in an ascending triangle.  Probably was going to break down anyhow.

You are just imagining stuff up.
oh damn that's cool af, thanks dude
Agreed, I just don't know if that was after a visit to 7100 or right now.
> no one is really bullish

not true
must be, just google invest like the best and its the most current episode.
You haven't sold yet 😋
I would prefer a bull run, it's waaaay easier to trade :)
This. Wish I could upvote more than once.
You're right though, you use candle close on divergences 
Yes, it's incorrect to use divergences this way. 
Not exactly. It looks at sum of gains and sum of losses over the last 14 periods. So, weekly RSI is looking back pretty far.

http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:relative_strength_index_rsi




Still seems to illustrate a divergence. The indicator is moving down and the averages are all moving up.
Or not.
agreed, if i was a bull, id be cautious af, taking profit at any significant bounce with hopes of a better avg entry
i would never have guessed
lol just joking about F meme. Good luck on your trade.
In my case, I got into crypto through mining when Eth was about 300 last summer and I'm probably about up 50% through trading.  I sold my entire stack on the drop around 9k and then again at 6.9k (losing about 2-3% overall from the drop).  Though I'm flat, I'm hoping for an uptrend to develop discounting for all the noises and chops.  If it keeps going down, then I'll just wait until a reversal as I'm sure a lot of people here are.  I would love to be able to buy in and keep a good hold stack like some of the Bitcoin old timers here though. 
I'd like to see where those people are getting their data. It's not like you can sell a Bitcoin that's in cold storage. The vast majority of Bitcoin has been in the wild for a lot longer than a couple months. Supply of bitcoin is bought up as it's created. OTC surges can't change the supply.
it's a very weak correlation considering the difference in market environments. I know people here don't really think anythings different but the boom bust cycle has very clear shifts in market environments

one guy commenting something  someone else did last year isn't indicative of an impending bull run. All it means is one guy commenting didn't have any effect on the price, which we already knew
my post doesn't actually say anything, it just points out the humor in your comment taken to an extreme


Can you point to me where you have ever seen a cup and handle on BTC almost as perfect as this?

Thanks bud :) 
Yeah, the top of the triangle is around 8.8. Seems pretty far away right now. But a long from 7150 with stops around 7K might be a good spot. 
OK, thanks for the tips.
I've missed RES ever since I started using this damned Brave browser...

Note, I don't chart eth closely.  Just enough to track trends and potential turning points.  These lines are loose.

Edit: I have basically the same 555, but todays high is 548.  That's close enough to say we kissed it.  I do see this going a bit sideways and maybe mini pumps to hug that line again as said.  If fireworks happen at that line, perhaps BTC will be affected.
No I have it in the same spot as well (look at my above comment)
Yeah I could see it testing that, but at this point that is just noise to me.  Especially considering how little effect today's rise had on BTC.

If fireworks happen when it gets back in contact with its trendline, I could see BTC being affected.
I'll take whatever, including a "Dick" flair. I'll wear whatever I can get with pride and a sense of privileged and accomplishment.

Adorn me.


Gypsytoy was permabanned in the process. He almost got permabanned a second time. He really stuck his neck out over this.

On the other hand, this seems to be clear evidence that people do manipulate sentiment in CC subs, even (especially?) this one. Showing that an account is doing that is difficult. It can't just be GypsyToy who watches for this. Mods don't have any special tools to sniff this stuff out. It's very likely that there are many other accounts who are up to the same funny business but they're much better at it. It's likely that the owner of the suspended account has only learned how to do this without getting caught in the same way.

Report and communicate with mods when you see suspicious activity. If your issue is above our pay grade (in this case it was), please collaborate with us so we can understand what behavior clearly and concisely document the pattern you're observing in a way that lets us pass information on to admins to process and administrate.

Let's work together to keep this kind of stuff (the drama AND the sentiment manipulation) out of the daily.
Yeah, for sure. I make up 95% of the noise about this, at the moment.

The issue is that it's hard to gauge the sentiment of the community when some substantial portion of said community is this very phenomenon of manipulation. This is why it was so ironic when people were saying that the downvotes I was getting were *proof* that nobody on the sub gave a shit about what I was saying. Anyone with a decent code of conduct and an understanding of the importance of accurate information and honesty knows that this behavior is deplorable. Only seriously misguided individuals and other manipulators think that this is a non-issue. I know that traders are probably a more self-serving group than most, but still... have people here really lost their moral compass or are my detractors mostly just other alts and sock puppets?

One wonders.
I think you're overestimating the number of people who know he's a con. Most people, including mods on both subs, seemed fundamentally unaware of the extent of his actions until very recently. 

*Now*, however, I wouldn't be surprised he disappeared and popped up under a new account at some point. Too bad though. He loved to gloat about that 133K karma and how he was the "top poster in /r/CryptoCurrency". 

Guess it was all for nothing in the end. :/

Watch the price of Vechain plummet now that he's been fully exposed. lol

 
Thanks, I don't think I'm an asshole either but I can certainly behave like a sarcastic asshole given the right situation. Usually it's deserved though and even when it's not (when I'm just short tempered with people), my overall disposition is not that of an asshole. I'm actually a pretty nice guy when it comes down to it, I just have very little patience for certain things. I mean no disrespect to those who don't deserve it, but I'm not one to dilly dally around the point and if the point is you're a shill, liar, manipulator or otherwise an asshole, I'm going to act in kind. 
Was just trying to show not everyone is taking this as the end of the world, an unfair, immoral abomination without decency nor code of conduct that should be passible of death sentence.
Yes, I mean watyougonado? Welcome to the internet, for the best and the worse.
Right on, I said the same thing to Sloppy the other day. What if you found out one day that you had literally been arguing with Arson or Gypsy (maybe the same person?) as the entire sub for the last year of your life. 

Talking about triangles, pennants, flags, moons and goblintown. Black Mirror episode right there. 
~~Yeah, you guise really got me.~~

edit: above poster ninja-edited his comment.
Yeah, I got it, but thanks for the spoon :)
Tummy is often a better indicator than any TA to be fair so listen to it!
It is, but technically the swing was from 6840 to 6660. We're very nearly where we were this morning. 
I mean 6.1 is a head and we're close to break the neckline. But yeah, a lot wonky.
I would probably just unhedged long. Maybe leverage at $4.5k. 

At that point I'd have enough btc I wouldn't feel the need to use much leverage to be honest lol 
Haha not even, just basic decency :P 
Insurance fraud happens every day on massive scale.
i feel like i can do this but googling day trading, it felt like day traders have a set goal daily. what you just explained, i feel like i can and have done. so now i feel like an idiot lol. but thank you so much. i completely appreciate your responses.
i'm not.
I know ;( that’s why it’s better to trade support and resistance but it’s not as fun 

Trading a successful cup and handle would be pretty legendary on a 30min time frame considering the style of trading the last few months 
I have an undergrad degree in Econ and an advanced degree in another field related to "global macro trends," and I upvoted him.  I'm downvoting you, however, because you're using an ad hominem attack. 

Economics says money flows where it gets the best return.  Basic principle.  Bitcoin is up 5% since this time yesterday.  How's your stock portfolio looking today?
It’s called common sense
many a truth is said in meme ;)
[removed]
Weren't you arguing yesterday that most people buy btc cause it's going up and its fundamentals,didn't have much to do with it? o_O 

And now suddenly you think people are going to invest during complex global economic uncertainty? Haha 
Yeah this sub is like my gf. :p
Put it this way: Even the people who bought at 20K will end up way ahead if they are willing to ride this out.  The only thing that changes in the Bitcoin market is the size of the bear rugs. It's super duper simple math.  Float gets smaller, demand only grows.  Maybe five percent of middle class people even own any Bitcoin.  Just wait until it's 10-20 percent.
Lol, sure let's buy at 19.5k, 17k, 13k, and 11k and take out a mortgage too while we are at it.  We'll be fucking rich in 5-7 years (or maybe live under a bridge), but hey YOLO.

Listen, I get what you guys are saying about the upside for Bitcoin and crypto, but let's not base it absolutely on blind faith.  At least allow for the possibility that we may be going back a few steps before we go forward to a new ATH again or something.
Which word do you mean? Seems on point to me.

Did you think he meant deflationary?
Got it, you mean buying and holding forever, never selling. 'Cause you don't lose money as long as you don't sell, right?

I understand BTC could reverse and end up being more valuable than now. But it's extremely risky to choose this time to buy and hold. In this market, you short to make money. Why would you buy and hold when the trend is obviously down? Only a fool high on hopium would choose to do that over shorting right now.
Bitcoin has been in a harsh downtrend for 6 months now. Buying and holding has been a terrible advice, while shorting is making people rich. Don't like it? Too bad, these are facts.

And if you really want to know, I've been investing in Bitcoin since 2016, knew about it much earlier obviously.
Stok has an extremely hard time grasping that, it seems. Further, shorters are at least selling with the 100% guarantee of buying later. Additionally, *most* people shorting are simply doing so to get more BTC. We're just choosing to risk BTC to do it instead of fiat (a la buying).
we also been bullish before 10k got denied hard.
They could also just be hostile to bad analysis. Price following moving average is exactly backwards. Being in a downtrend appears to be what he's trying to say, so he should say that, not some dumb reverse causation shit.
Haha kinda. I'm a noob who got in in January at 13k
Mmm, yes I agree. However I'm also not totally convinced the cup and handle pattern as described is valid/relevant on shorts/longs charts. These charts can be so volatile because of liquidations making it difficult to draw patterns/lines. IMO in this case it's interesting because of how perfectly round that cup is and how perfectly it seemed to stop just in time to form a handle. Might be totally wrong, but it's pretty.
Yeah, that's why the price dropped 2% on the news.  Because it was absolutely nothing.
Of course TA can predict "violently" strong moves up and down.   You have absolutely no idea what TA even is.
Yes that was my point.
Hmmmm, not sure. If someone market closed his long into that wall, there was no chance for the other person to pull it beforehand, right?
Thanks!
Someone suggested bithumb is doing this for tax purposes. But he's saying that would be like bringing down the entire church permanently just so the priest could skip one sermon.. 

Weird analogy 
[deleted]
Thanks. I believe I have learnt some techniques that work. "Buying the dip" etc. I especially like what might be called "green candle fishing" -- i.e., to try to be long as much as possible during those times when there might be a green candle, which means managing entry and exit with minimum loss according to price turbulence, but stay long for as much as possible when there's a possibility of a BGD to occur.
But if you have no HODL stack and *only* trade with leverage, you get the best of both worlds
Some people sell cause they think the price is going down. They don't hope it will but just think it will. It really is easier to see things clearly for most people when they're flat. A good trader will see it clearly either way but it's not easy by any means 
show me something i said that wasnt true
I don’t use leverage
I thought you are the crazy rich guy here :D
You got me :) I have no clue how much coin people on this sub might have, I've seen a few posting multi million dollar positions...
You can always look at the chart to find out why I gave that specific number dude. Not everything need fully explained and I posted the forecast for fun and sharing my view, not for profit or business opportunity dude. Of course I could, but some1 may ask me to post the chart, draw the line too, so... 😅
Spot on. Nail on the head. Ill keep him a spare goblin mask for when the time comes. 
FOMO is a powerful force lol. It strangely feels better to be reminded that I'm not the only one who bought at the top though.
lol... okay, I read that out of context and missed your self deprecation. Generally, the term "bulltard" is problematic. I wouldn't mind it if I never saw that in the sub again.
Sounds like someone has no grasp of the technology.

Mutability essential? Yeah, I totally want my balance to be mutable.  Heck, while you're at it, jigger around with my mortgage.  Modern banking is nothing but ledger keeping.  A reliable, cryptographically secured/verified ledger is the best thing that ever happened to banking.  Of course, they'll need to use a public, decentralized blockchain.  The biggest one is Bitcoin so that's probably the one they'll end up using.

Oh, and just as we do not (generally) send packets directly over UDP on the Internet, most blockchain action will happen in other layers over new protocols.  The blockchain will just be the place where everything settles.
Makes accounting easier/cheaper, microtransactions faster, cheaper, general transactions faster and cheaper. If you want to know more just google it 
Aright everybody, time to 100x long. We're clearly never seeing 6655 again. A 0.75% drop is now not possible.
Or so.
I've done that before and watched it run up 20 percent in a week.  Don't recommend it.
Makes me wonder how much retail money there is on the sidelines right now, watching, waiting. it has to be a lot...
Wasn’t it in the article?
oh I totally agree that comments don't have an effect on price, that's totally fair. and you're right that the conditions here are very different from any of the past years
Here's two pal :)

https://www.tradingview.com/x/ykSww0Rz/
I wouldn't call it noise as much as just a short term trend, although volume has picked up somewhat (doubling from when we were at 490) it's still a little less than half the volume we experience from our drop from the 600s which is why I still think we will stall out around 555-560.

From there I imagine we go through the same thing we did when btc was at 7750 where we hugged the resistance line on decreasing volume till we eventually drop down 

Edit: someone is currently letting a buy wall get eaten, I imagine they are loading up to short at a higher price point
I find it fucking fascinating. Oh, what flawed beings are we.
>He loved to gloat about that 133K karma and how he was the "top poster in /r/CryptoCurrency".

Sounds like he needs a break from the internet.
Says the arch shill and [transparent sockpuppet failure] (http://archive.is/AyKwU).

I am morally outraged at your moral outrage about moral outrage. /s

This isn't a big deal. There's no "death sentence" or even real consequences. An account on the internet was suspended. They'll just make another one.
>watyougonado?

Making the sub private for a period of time is one option. 
I've had the exact same thought, total mind fuck
I caught on to the farce almost immediately after posting it.
More-so just making sure /u/arsonbunny doesn't accuse me of plagiarism. Credit where credit due.
This one :P

https://www.tradingview.com/x/eSXi1WXQ/
Fair enough, I could not recall if you had a non-trading stack or if you ditched it. 

Good podcast this week on Invest Like The Best on [crypto](https://play.google.com/music/m/Dohajbm7vz7x6gr4q5bvtuiwksa?t=New_Angles_on_Crypto_-_Kyle_Samani_and_Tushar_Jain_-_Invest_Like_the_Best_EP92-Invest_Like_the_Best)

Lol, starting to sweat a bit, Sloppy? Sure is getting kinda warmer now :-P
True, but it works because insurance companies would not investigate many/most cases. Bithumb hack is obviously different. 
It does look good on the 1hr but yeah I don't see it playing out. If this was the 4hr then I'd be all about it but who knows. 10am PST and 1pm PST tends to be the peak pump/dump times here. 
You are wrong like every single time though.

And what's the return the previous half year for Bitcoin? Down over 60%. The return is negative. Big money doesn't care about a 5% bounce that's probably going to get slapped down any day, they have a longer time frame and the longer time frame is a downtrend. Are you really going to combat economic uncertainty by speculating on a reversal in an asset that hardly has historic data and it's value is largely speculative? Looking for more uncertainty in times of uncertainty? Can you give me ONE fundamental economic argument that says that Bitcoin is going to give positive returns in the near future?


Don't own any stocks right now but will buy consumer staples , my currency shorts against the dollar are doing extremely good though, probably a lot better than all your failed trades I read here (and I follow them ever since you annoyed me). Not even all stocks are performing bad, their returns shift in accordance to how far we are in the economic cycle and depend mainly on inflation and growth. It's all connected. Bitcoin is also connected and will continue to perform bad for the time being. Every big fund manager realizes this and that's why the crypto market is so anemic. Hardly any volume and action. Big money has left and placed their money elsewhere. 
First rule to not blow your account: Don't buy assets in a downtrend.
This qualifies as a rule 1 violation and there is some hate speech mixed in. Take a day to cool off and rethink how you want to handle these situations in the future.
Ahhhhhh.... yeah that's a fair criticism haha. These boom and bust cycles really have a mind of their own. But they might be *triggered* by things, like an ETF approval or a global trade war. Weak argument tho.
Bipolar? 
>Yeah this sub is like my gf. :p

I'm so sorry. 
Two years from now the drop from 20K to 6K will look like noise. 
> Got it, you mean buying and holding forever, never selling. 'Cause you don't lose money as long as you don't sell, right?

I don't plan on ever selling, but I do spend.  It's actually easier than cash (don't have to go to an ATM) and quite a dang bit better than credit cards.  It will catch on.  In just a few short years, one will be able to go anywhere in the world and buy just about anything with Bitcoin.  We're actually almost there already.  Plane tickets and accommodations can be had just about anywhere, and restaurants and shopping won't be far behind.

But hey, be a jealous no-coiner. Cling to those depreciating, soon-to-be obsolete dollars.  Your loss.
The point is, if the price moves in either direction you can make money. Get in. Get out. Profit. It doesn't matter if something later gets denied so long as you're on the correct side of the trade. Positions aren't for life. 
You are responding to him. 

Also, really "the price will always want to go back to the MA"

sounds a lot to me like "there is a pattern of the price returning to the MA"

No analysis on cause or effect. Just the pattern. 
7k i think you would've been okay, maybe even 8k... 13k might take awhile but at least its not 20k :-p
I thought all the orders will be pulled when it takes a hit. Looks like it won't.
Of course. I'm short from above. Roughly 6750. 
See learning is the key. There is no universal method of making money in trading, everyone has to learn their way and come up with their own methods / strategies (like the one you mentioned above).

It's a good idea to always perform a *SWOT* analysis before you enter any trade. It helps you identify your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities (which in the above case is catching a BGC), and, threats (which in the above case could be the failure to catch a BGC and taking a hit instead). 

 
Agree 100%. You just have be prepared mentally to forfeit potential gains on a big pump. For me that can be difficult. 
I already have many times. How about you go make something of yourself instead? Instead of being a concern troll you could be an astronaut or a firefighter or anything you so desire. 

Just put your mind to it, dude.
Quite possibly you are correct, I don't really get the nuts and bolts of bank record keeping. Please help me:

If I send a payment to the wrong account number, or if my CC gets phished, the bank can reverse my payment, and everyone is happy. I assumed this required some 'mutability' quality, but I guess they just append the ledger with a new balance.

In the above case, if the bank can overwrite my balance to help me out, as I want them to be able to do, how is this different from mutability? 

If BTC becomes the global reserve currency, does it mean that any slight errors are permanent SFYL events? Or does it mean that things will work exactly the same as they do now, just with BTC instead of fiat?

In the latter case, what is the additional benefit of 'immutability'?
> A reliable, cryptographically secured/verified ledger is the best thing that ever happened to banking.

Is this something that is currently in use or is this what BTC will ostensibly provide? If BTC is the best thing that has ever happened to banking, why do no banks use it? BTC has been around what, 10 years? If it was going to help banks in some way would we not see that in practice? 

Will BTC be coming out with a competitive product any time soon? What if a different CrYpToCoIn beats them to the punch, offering actual utility to the finance industry? Don't you think it will be like every other behind the scenes tech advancement, where transactions get slightly faster or cheaper as banks compete with each other, and consumers just live their lives as conveniently as possible, unaware that on the internet, *The Stokinator* is the only one who knows the truth?

>Of course, they'll need to use a public, decentralized blockchain.

Would the world prefer a large percentage of its electricity use be dedicated to number lotteries verifying the integrity of a spreadsheet, or would they concede that trust is part of living in a society, and that all that energy would be better spent improving transparency in finance and government.

Or would that throw a spanner in your plans to be a somebody in your technoutopian future, where all your maximalist evangelising on gambling subreddits pays off, and the gubmint cant put their grubby mitts on your ~~hoarded internet tokens~~ hard-earned fortune.

I couldnt find anything about it being cheaper or faster than a shared database. Mostly stuff about the consensus mechanism being superior, I'll have to do more reading cheers
.00001% chance that turns out to be true, but saving this comment *juuust* in case lol :P


tbh, if you took PROFITS then id be happy.

im always happy with any profits, even if its like 1% profit in terms of trading stack which is only about 20% of my whole stack. meaning that in the grand scheme its nothing. end of the day, profit is profit
One mistake I keep making is underestimating the capital in crypto.  Most recently when we saw the move to 10k for example.  Even at the 6k range, it feels like it can easily go back to 9k at the very least.  Better keep a close watch on the volume or positive news to bait everyone back in.  
I was mainly just being dumb lol 
Yes that forecast feels the most natural.  Agree about the stall out points.  There was an incredible amount of sell pressure above 550 today (but not below), and it didn't seem to be a single player.
Lmao, *whoosh*!

You are, once again, way out of your element here, bro.
:)
...
Fuck am I even my own person!? What if my entire existence is based off of being an Alternative account for someone!?
Oh, right, exactly :)
:P I told you I ain't even breakin a sweat til $6850+

Note the plus :D 

I see 6849.7  on finex ;)

They announced it in a very casual way, though. Which is at best unusual. 

I don't mean to patronise you. I work IT high security as my day job. I would say actual hacks are (very) rare. Usually it's fraud or internal theft. A system like an exchange of this magnitude with this much funds on it doesn't have just 3 random 2nd grade system engineers working on their code. They have 1-3 main development team(s), another 1-2 teams doing debug only, and at least one dedicated security team yet again reviewing everything. Modern Unix is generally secure and most modern languages are well evolved, matured and secure (if used right).

Also in case of an external investigation, if they intentionally decided to fake the hack, the 3rd party won't find anything. It's their system and they can very well 'prep it' for an audit like that. Also a common corporate strategy in such situation is hiding behind "proprietary information", i.e. "you cannot see our system in full 'cuz business secrets".
First rule of what? I’ll explain it to you like i would to my 10 years old nephew: you buy when it’s low and sell when it’s high. It’s not that complicated.

Edit: Welcome to Bitcoin where rules are made up and your biased TA doesn’t matter 
It's probably a strawman since you are free to make multiple arguments lol
No, full of dicks.
What?? No... :D
lol mate, my gf is sub and I kinda like it. ;)
Don't confuse that what you want with that which is likely to happen.
It won't even look like noise. It will look like a little tiny divot just like the drop from 1000 to 250 looks now.
That pattern is tautological, long run, because of how MA is constructed.
Ah, makes sense.
no you haven't.
Liquidated :P
Oh, I took big "profits," but then I watched them get smaller a week later, even smaller a month later.  That, "I'll sell some now and buy back cheaper" thing can make you feel pretty dumb when you buy back in at double the price a few months later.
You must be new here.  Yes. It can go back to 9K extremely fast, and it will at some point... and well beyond.
*takes a bong rip*

we're all just, like, God's alt accounts anyway, man
But it could also be an insider stealing/hacking. Which can perfectly explain their strange way to announce.

Besides, they could own cryptos (collected as fees for example) and wanted to sell before the announcement.
I'm not saying you can't trade BTC and buy low, sell high. But the post was about hedging against a trade war. That's not the same at all. You aren't looking to actively trade something if you want to hedge risks. Hedging is to reduce risks, not to increase it. 

Haha.
Do the math. He's right. You're wrong.
K
Not at all. it means it's prudent to watch if it goes above the MA or below it. It stayed above the MA he showed almost all of last year. It was a strong pattern. 

If you mean long run like..years. Okay sure. Kind of useless to us though  
Okay, you keep thinking that. 

:)
Positive Tether news and you're nowhere to be found.


Hmmmm....
hahaha well played Sir Haserfauld, well played. I just baked a whole sheet of strawberry hand pies and I'm going to stress-eat all of them right now. good trading to you man
Its a problem that could be solved with blockchain identity I guess. Sorry I did not know any of this drama with arsonbunny. Is there an eili5?
Oh sure. If this isn't an actual hack, then most likely it's internal. If it's internal, depends who's on it. If the guy in charge who will later claim insurance, that's still fraud. 
> no one in his sensible mind managing millions or billions of dollars is thinking right now that he should buy BTC when it has lost over 60% of his value in a couple of months.

I beg you differ. 
that was the sunny news I was talking about.

I did say sunny and its not going to rain every day didnt i?

though the report is worthless its still seen as good news. 
Dude save some for stok...he's definitely going to need some comfort food 

:) good luck to you to man. 6500 may hold here if we don't let down hard. I'm not optimistic personally (except that I'm short).
>Its a problem that could be solved with blockchain identity I guess

that's amazing, you're absolutely right. 

>Is there an eili5?

I'd send the mods a PM as I don't want to clutter the daily more than it already is with this, though something tells my gypsy will be responding here momentarily lol
Yeah you must be clairvoyant... /s

How is the report "worthless"? Just because it's not an auditing firm? Good grief, move the goal posts more. Nothing is ever good enough, everything positive is always "worthless". 

*sigh* 
Not gypsy here and I don't have a horse in this race but...I figured I'd add my random two cents. I overheard the mods talking to gypsy and it sounds like they're going to make a statement or thread about this at some point, hopefully all the details can be found there.

/u/zigsquig, I think if you're curious enough and dig through /u/gypsytoy's history over the past 96 hours or so you'll see some of the context. You could also glance at /u/arsonbunny's too. 

Gypsy is a force for good and the top poster on BM. He deserves everyone's undivided attention and full respect. I hope he posts a donation address soon. He is the man. 
if you hire a lawyer to represent you in court and you're guilty as sin, the lawyer is going to still try to make you look innocent. thats how lawyers work.

an auditing firm is different.

they are there to find the truth because if they lie, they go to jail. if it turns out they were wrong... they are liable.

if tether turns out to be faking everything, nothing bad happens to these lawyers that made this report. 

guess whats missing from the report: liabilities.

are tethers liabilities? that question isn't asked. 

So which account did you think you were logged in as here, shill?
> Not gypsy here

kek
*whoosh*
What are you an /u/etherael brigading right now?

Both of you show up at the same time to completely miss the joke and upvote each other?
> someone made a joke about how heavily I shill and sockpuppet because it's blatantly obvious to everyone
> I play into it in a way that makes it unclear if I'm trying to be ironic or actually am indeed just fucking up my sockpuppet management.

Well played sadsack, well played.

You mentioned the word 'joke'. Here is one about Chuck Norris: 

 >Jack Bauer tried to use his detailed knowledge of torture techniques, but to no avail: Chuck Norris thrives on pain. Chuck Norris then ripped off Jack Bauer's arm and beat him to death with it. Game, set, match.
Swing and a miss. Strike two. 

Try going back and reading and figuring out what actually happened. You're completely obvious as to the context of this post because, as usual, you don't have a clue what's going on around you. Your only purpose is to shill BTrash, especially as the price is crashing.
