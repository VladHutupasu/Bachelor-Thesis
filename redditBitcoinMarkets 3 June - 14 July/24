/u/Coingurrruu asked about past periods of stability, so I made this chart for him.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/5I1RBJmx/

The flags are interesting to me because they're based on the closing price of the period and the bottom BBand. It makes dramatic periods in Bitcoin's history really pop out. It's interesting when that's combined with low volatility, too.

Projections are from the circled periods and related by their color.

If you zoom in to look at the projected stability, this is what you get:

Here are the other two periods:

All this riffs on the idea of projecting from stability:

Now the dumps don't work

They just make you worse

But I know I'll see your face again
This is what I’m watching right now when it comes to similarities between the 6k and 7k range 

Zoomed out: https://www.tradingview.com/x/7BO0idWw/

Zoomed in: https://www.tradingview.com/x/PAuynW8L/

A break below $6550-$6600 would be bearish and a break below $6400 would be extremely bearish.

There are a handful of longs opening in this range as longs are increasing. If $6600 is broken I expect longs from this range/ the $6500 range to close causing a domino affect and some large red candles. If $6400 is broken, longs from the $6100-$6300 range should start to close and most likely our lows should be tested again. 

This is feeling way too similar to the 7k range, and too add our Ascending wedge/Triangle is nearly identical  slop wise to the 7k range as /u/Haserfauld pointed out to me just before. 

Adding rest of 50% of short here. People are pretty bullish right now as we were in the 7k range. But nothing has changed. Volume still low, short squeeze is out of picture for now, continuously failing to break the $6800 resistance mark with conviction and forming bearing patterns all over. Not to mention the ascending wedge/ bear pennant on daily. 

Sweet trades all good luck 
The usual low frequency comment. You know what's next :)
Can we get a strawpoll of whether this is accumulation at the bottom or further distribution?

I have no clue and looking to get out of my long before the big move. All I know is if this is distribution, they're doing a great job of hiding it.
Bitcoin appears to be stuck... does it need to be switched off then back on? Has anyone got the controls?  

Some of the best trading advice I was given was to ask myself "What Would Brian Boitano Do?"

He'd make a plan and follow through that's what Brian Boitano do
The similarities here are very surprising, even for BTC. I'm a major skeptic of fractals, but I do believe there's substantial value in analyzing market conditions prior to big movements and watching for those to reappear.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/WnUez0ws/  

I had charted the ascending wedge we're in, but I actually cut and pasted the resistance and support and moved them up to the 7400 range *without changing length or slope*. I was surprised how nearly it fit. 

We're seeing shorts drop and longs increase while price remains relatively flat. Volume is tapering off. RSI is reset across all short/mid timeframes, and even the daily is back over 40. 

I think there's a relatively strong case to be made for a movement down in the near future. 
Ok so time for an update to some of my earlier morning TA drivel... in my humble opinion 

- We are currently sitting in the 4 hour Ichimoku cloud, with lower support at 6680 (Binance). The 1 hour cloud Kijun line is at 6695 so as stated earlier, i'm hoping these can keep us afloat for a bit. 
***It may have helped us earlier at 2PM UCT when we bounced straight off the bottom of the 4hour cloud...
http://imgur.com/aG7s0mc

- The last time we were in the 4hour cloud and fell out under it was 10th June, this was my 'we are fucked estimate' at the time, turned out pretty accurate. So I hope to God we don't fall under the 4hour again, remember that level is only 6680...it's damn close

- The top of the 2 hour cloud is at 6900, would be my first real good target to aim for, break that and i'll certainly take note.

- The 1 hour, 2 hour RSI is now solidly trending down from the 18th June

- The 2hour and 4hour Wavetrends have now crossed to the negative indicating we could see some downside now for the rest of the day perhaps

- The 4hour MACD is very close to a negative cross.

- My 144 WMA on the 4hour chart appears to be rejecting a cross from under to over. As a guide, we haven't crossed from under to over with conviction since 12th April. That cross took us from 7100 to 10K. So if we cross, that would be very decent indeed. To cross above we need to break 6900

- OK the daily RSI, our last high was April 24th...the RSI trend line drawn from there to present day shows us smacking into the underside of this trend line. 
Should we break through it to the upside in the next few days that could signal a positive shift in trend back upwards, i'll be watching that with interest.
http://imgur.com/CbBy8xX


$$$Putting everything together with some TA lines not mentioned...and summing up in basic figures,

- We are the fuckee (without consent) under - 6430ish
- We are the fucker (fully into it) above - 7250

Prediction for the next 2 to 6 hours, downside 

[Rising wedge or bear flag](https://www.tradingview.com/x/rYZglDGp/) with convergence at the down trend line as well as the moving average. Pick your bearish pattern. If I shorted Bitcoin, I would strongly consider doing it soon.

Edit: OR this is the *perfect* spot for whales to fuck with us and bart upwards.
Can someone explain why many traders think that the low volume means it is likely not the bottom? From my understanding, round bottoms of previous crashes are characterized by low volume -- that means sell volume has dried up and people are quietly accumulating.
8hr BTC with some levels I am watching. I think breakdown below 6560 would be quite bearish. I might even add to my 6800 short if that happens, but i am hoping lower time frames will give better entry signals. For example we might see a wind up and breakdown with a sell signal around 6700. Lots of longs from 6700-6750 so there is a potential for a squeeze.

https://imgur.com/a/be8zapR
Ok so time for my daily morning TA bullshit...

- We are currently sitting in the 4 hour Ichimoku cloud, with lower support at 6673. The 1 hour cloud Kijun line is at 6695 so i'm hopeful both these markers will hold us up for a little bit at least

- The top of the 2 hour cloud is at 6900, would be a nice interim moment to break through that 

- On the weekly chart, if we close this week out above 6919 it would be the 1st weekly candle close closing above the previous candle high since the week of 30th April

- The 1 hour and 2 hour charts could possible be showing a bearish divergence on the RSI, Stoch and the MACD. Not sure about it though to be fair

- From our low on the 13th June we are running up a channel with higher lows, this support line currently sits around 6495. Should that break I get the feeling it's a retest of the 13th June low

- Our original trend line, which when we broke it kicked off this recent dump (started on 10th June), will likely prove tough resistance currently at the 7200 range.

- The 4 hour MACD is just hinting at swinging down for a cross to the negative, this could be likely seeing as the 2hour MACD has just crossed to the negative

$$$ Positive Outlook for the end --- If we can break above the 4hour Ichimoku Cloud, which sits at 6964 (Binance), it would be our first time above it since 8th May. 
The last time we broke up through it from the underneath was 13th April, this move kick started our mini bull run up to 10k.

That's what i'm watching and hoping for.
Anyone know the longest period of time we have moved sideways for before some volatility? 

We are going on like 28 hours now 
I have a good feeling, this is the day we go hard sideways at least till 2021
Hm, I'm feeling bullish. The last 5 times, it was a sell signal - since I'm one of the bigger bears here, me feeling a bit bullish means that bullish exuberance reaches it's peak.I still think we could see 7k-7.2k as our top, though it's a bit hard to justify the r/r here.

If we were to go back into the symmetrical triangle, I just freaking give up. I just can't see that happening, since a throwback to the bottom of that triangle again would be such a beautiful short entry with stops above the line.
Well,

This volatility will look intense with how flat the chart has been.

Good luck trying to buy any dips without getting smashed.
Hey guys. Virtually the same charts and analysis as \[yesterday\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8sfbjm/daily\_discussion\_wednesday\_june\_20\_2018/e10lg0e](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8sfbjm/daily_discussion_wednesday_june_20_2018/e10lg0e)), however, the targets for a short and a breakout are coming down a bit as we walk sideways into this trendline (that I mentioned I personally think is meaningful at this point):

Finex: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/jSreRAfG/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/jSreRAfG/)

Stamp: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/zZmWFGjR/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/zZmWFGjR/)

NormieBase: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/sbVv0yZN/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/sbVv0yZN/)

Here's a finex chart on a shorter timeframe, which I have been watching:

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/FL0Cxt3t/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/FL0Cxt3t/)

I think the triangle forming there is meaningful too. So to recap, here are my targets:

* \*\*Short\*\*  $6820-$6850, stop above $7,000
* \*\*Long\*\* breakout of $7,000. Depending on how it's looking, ya might get antsy and be OK at 6950-ish. Stop on a breakdown into the channel again.
* \*\*Long\*\* 6500-6550, or wherever the price converges on my green trendline in the short term chart (the last one I posted). Stop on a \~$100 breakdown of that green line.
* \*\*Short\*\* breakdown of that short term trendline, with a target near the bottom of the channel.

Setting my alarms. This could move relatively sideways for another day or two.

As I am typing, a move downward. I wont get caught chop trading anything but the 4 scenarios above, and neither should you (IMO).

I know this is a trading sub but the quality of discussion here is much higher than most crypto subs and I wanted to see if anyone could answer a technical question regarding the Lightning Network:

What are the things that need to be done involving the development and implementation of the Lightning Network for you guys to think it would begin to have a real impact on bitcoins price going up?
500+ BTC sold in just about ten minutes yet buyers are looking very keen to buy the coins and not backing up really. I took the risk lol.

Sorry to double post but here's my contribution for tonight... 

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSDT/mvWaO7wq-Jump-it/

Trade safe, catch ya later
I am officially all back in. whatevs after getting in with an average price of $440 and selling (and trading for gold) at an avg of 13.5, I don't know who would sell down here. the dca is back on an I want my sweet sweet sweet sweet btc back. 
Investing question, I hope it is allowed to ask. I'm planning to invest some money in ETH besides BTC. Would you say 50/50 in BTC/ETH is wise or something like 70/30 ?

Note: I'm not trying to shill ETH in this sub. :-)
Oct-Dec the smallest news sky rocketed BTC. I cashed out everything at $10k waiting for it to correct and luckily panic bought back in at $11.5.  Now in bear market we continue to receive big news on a regular basis and the price doesn't budge. I foolishly predicted we'd jump back over $10k with all the news coming out. What is is going to take to go over $10k again? And does anyone here think there's a chance it won't go over $10k? 

I only hold alts at the moment but all these alts are priced ridiculously high. You think with a drastic drop we saw that some shitcoins wouldn't have come back, similar to the dotcom bubble. Yet people rush to put their money back in hoping for big returns on shitty coins. Does that mean we'll see bitcoin go well below $6k to finally start the recovery? Is there a chance $10k is the peak? We go down to $5000, $4000, and the highest we ever see again is $10k? $7k?
Random long train-of-thought post about bubbles followed by completely arbitrary price speculation:

So I was trying to find some good charts comparing all the previous BTC bubbles and also other financial bubbles and it's actually kind of hard with just a google search. But I was able to find one. And lo and behold it's a [post from this subreddit from two years ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/4mqw2m/3_bitcoin_bubbles_comparison_chart/) I particularly like one comment and how spot on their prediction was about a bubble to 5k and then to 40k (almost got there). Reading these past comments makes me feel like this time it really *isn't* different. We will be in a bear market for the foreseeable future, and then we'll have another bubble. I was of the mind that this market may have matured to the point where a recovery would be faster, say <1 year, but now I'm thinking this could drag out for quite awhile longer. One thing for sure, though, is that after looking at the previous bubbles, BTC will always bottom out in a long round bottom. Meaning that, when we do bottom, we'll be in a certain range with low volatility for months. jarederaj has noted this already and I think the DCA strategy is great advice right now. However, I don't think we are bottoming out quite yet. That high volume break down of the symmetrical triangle we were in was significant, imo. It showed that the bulls just are not in control right now to let such a significant pattern to break down. Sure, we still haven't made a new low but only for technical reasons. 6k is/was good support and we were way outside the daily BB's so buying on our latest drop was very low risk. But just as the bulls have let that triangle break, I think 6k support will break, too. Furthermore, if this is actually the bottom then we will probably still be in the 6k range for another 2 months so I'm in no hurry to buy in, atm. The BGD that so many of you seem to be wishing for just doesn't happen when BTC bottoms out. 


Now on to the random price speculation. BTC has always (so far) bottomed out around 80%-85% of the peak, so that is 3-4k for this bubble. It then stays around that bottom from anywhere between 6 months to a year. Considering the 2014 bubble pop had a legitimate fundamental concern (Gox) it needed that year to prove there was still demand. This bubble pop was strictly technical reasons, we went up too far too fast, so I expect we'll be in the 3-4k range on the shorter time frame of 6 months, probably the 4th quarter of 2018 and the 1st quarter of 2019. Then a fight of breaking the 6k support turned resistance in the 2nd quarter of 2019. I think we'll see our next bubble at the end of 2019 to 2020 as everyone talks about how the halving is going to make the supply collapse, will get into another mania situation and probably have another bubble pop. My only hope is that *that* time will be different, as LN will hopefully be working and people will actually find use cases as a currency and not just a store of wealth. That bubble pop I'm hoping will take <1 year to recover from and actually be the start of people using BTC as a world currency and not just a speculative asset.


tl;dr - After looking at previous bubbles I expect us to be in the 3-4k range by the end of the year and stay there for months before starting a new bull run in mid 2019. It appears that this time it really *isn't* different.
Would you rather have 10 $10,000 Bitcoin or 100 $1000 Bitcoin at the end of 2018?

Edit: sorry fixed a digit.

Most of you guys won't give a shit but until this point I've been essentially gambling. I've spent a long time educating myself and even though i still have an incredibly long way to go, if all goes well, by next week i will officially call myself a trader and not gambler. Setting up a journal and system, working out some TA bits and bobs but i think im finally gonna be ready.

Started reading "An Altcoin Trader's Handbook" today. That’s what inspired this post, im only 30 pages in and the intro is just the authors "diary" but seeing his emotions and being able to link those to specific trades where I felt exactly the same makes me realise that we're all in the same boat doing more or less the same thing.

The book also made me realise another thing. We're so fucking insanely lucky. Internet has lowered the barriers to entry so much, its an endless well of information and you get the bucket for free. As long as youre willing to put the work in, YOU CAN LITERALLY BE ANYTHING YOU WANT. I'm a fucking unicorn, and fuck anybody who say I'm not.

In terms of price, nothing too technical from me today but its clear that bulls are struggling to push through 6800 but they're defending dips very well too. I wouldn’t be surprised if we see some major volatility soon
I’m creating a new term.

Am I the only one that hates being short? It just feels wrong letting go of my sweet coins , I guess it’s for the greater good of getting more coins :)
15mintes left to defend that 4H MACD bearish cross.
That not excellent comment I just spent 10 minutes writing a response and now it's gone. I understand why, if the mods done it, if not the guy is just projecting. Remember guys if you see people come in here and bitch about people selling or buying is sometimes a good signal (in this case it just seems a little bit of missed the boat or shorted the bottom so far so everyone else is a retard logic) and usually that person is just projecting.

We all do it sometimes but at least do it in a constructive way. This daily is getting worse even though there's less posts (not the mods faults you guys do a great job imo) at the moment. I think at this point in time it feels a little risky to be all in BTC but if your going to be fucked if it doesn't work out the onus is on you. Thats the beauty of the bitcoin. Some people just can't be trusted when they make too much money to quickly or are too blinded to greed to sell a portion of their stack cus its gonna go up anothjer 100X anway

Anyway I thought I'd give a quick shoutout to the mods for keeping this place semi-decent: /u/chancrescolex /u/skywalk819 /u/jenninsea /u/deb0rk /u/slowmoon /u/zanetackett /u/Polycephal_Lee /u/joyrider5 (AKA /u/automox) /u/Plaski. Thanks guys!

Touching ascending support that extends to the low of the first dump for the 3rd time

If we break below $6600 with volume expansion I'd guess it's going to play out almost exactly the same. Hopefully we know in the next 4h

Really, it's pretty silly how similar this looks to $7k
I can't remember where I found this, but [one of the best analysis I've seen](https://coinlive.io/analysis/market-cycle) of the current situation - nearing the time of maximum opportunity.
Alright, almost 20h since the last big market buys happened. So i guess we just wait another few hours until the whales decide our next BXD with some big market sales or buys on finex? :-D.
1000BTC buy wall @6737

Price hovering at upside to bear flag for some time, trying to break upward, but sell volume @6800 is yet too strong

Could this be a sign for an uptick out of the bear pennant towards 6800-7000 range shortly...

I feel mad bullish. Don't know what it is. Have I just been this starved for a bullish pattern? 

No...this is my skill, not my hope. 
All of this redditt. Fraud is irrelevant. Bitrot and censorship will render all your bot downvotess impotent in the eyes of history because the future settles on the immutable, indisputable blockchain. So go ahead and short this. You don't deserve to be wealthy. 

To any normal person reading before the downvote bots blast me into oblivion: buy Bitcoin a little bit at a time. Don't listen to those with an agenda. The future is already written in digital stone (digital gold, to be exact). They will undoubtedly censor this comment, but they cannot censor your Bitcoin. Peace and fuck banksters up the pooper with multiple BGDs.
We're crossing the uptrend line, but it's not dumping. Strange situation...

Is there a way to tell whether or not a BXD is caused by one large order (a whale) or many small orders (everyone else)?
This popped up in my CryptoPanic feed today, positive news on the ETF front even if we have no SEC approval yet:

>The United States Patent and Trademark Office awarded a patent to a firm called Winklevoss IP LLP for exchange-traded-products (ETP) on June 19. The patent document details it as a method “for providing an exchange-traded-product holding digital math-based assets.”

>Investopedia defines ETP as “a type of security that is derivatively priced and traded intra-day on a national securities exchange.” ETPs include various investment instrument including ETFs, exchange-traded vehicles (ETVs), exchange-traded notes (ETNs) and certificates.

>Although the patent was awarded to the Winklevoss-backed company, its inventors are the brothers themselves, along with Evan Louis Greebel, Kathleen Hill Moriarty, and Gregory Elias Xethalis.

>The Winklevoss twins are likely to list the instrument at Gemini, an exchange backed by them. Earlier this year, Gemini introduced a block trading facility to cater to the increasing number of institutional traders trying to trade in large amounts – especially hedge funds.

>The Winklevoss brothers are actively working on crypto trading instruments, and according to publically available data, they have acquired seven crypto-related patents since last December.

>However, despite the advancements, it is not clear when these instruments will hit the market, given the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) harsh requirements. Earlier in March 2017, the Winklevoss brothers already tried to list Bitcoin ETFs on exchanges, but the SEC rejected their proposal. Later in December, with the introduction of Bitcoin futures on two exchanges in the US, the crypto community was hoping to see ETFs as well, but due to the strict listing rules imposed by the SEC, that did not happen yet.

https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/winklevoss-brothers-acquire-crypto-etf-patent/

Even if this is only listed on Gemini, showing demand and proper operation using some sort of price index could move SEC towards approval.
Feels like bullish posts are all getting up-voted and bearish sentiment is not being digested well. CC is also gone full bulltard. That's my subjective indicator. From a technical point of view - I'm sticking to my guns (should mention I'm short). Indicators on 1H - 4H are all reassuring me. For chop-city - 1H has worked well in respects to the Bart formations. If we go up - I'm adding to my short on the way up to 7.3k which, on my humble chart, is the the support turn resistance from the consolidation period (last week of May / 1st Week of June). Its also where we had the big bounce on 18 March 2018 before heading back up to 9.1k.

This is my play - DOYR.

Minor pause here and a slow climb up to around $6700 ish before resuming down trend for absolute maximum pain.

Wrote this quickly on the shitter at work only had 3 minutes sorry for lack of quality of charts 
Now is nobody considering the possibility that long term "sideways" (It actually isn't, more accurate would be: floating within a smaller bandwidth edit: with a tendency to go lower) would be good for BTC as a value holder? Considering the cap on mining, it would mean price would very gently go up. Less volatility would mean it being taken more seriously as a store of value. Price would go up gently. Over some years. Just no fun for short term traders. But that would be the only way BTC could do what it seems to be made for. A liquid currency? Never. Platform coin? No way. This development might be very good, just not for short term traders. If you're into long-term: buy now and hodl. Or try to catch the falling knife. Short term: forget it. Bandwith is smaller and smaller but the occasional surprises will rek you.
What is the reason for market behaviour like this? Seems like theres just one entity stabilizing it?
Any books or resources on actual trading strategies?
General wisdom: Go long the strongest, go short the weakest. Crypto markets are highly correlated. When you want to go long, pick the one coin that is the strongest, and enter just that one. Having multiple long positions for different coins isn't spreading risk, because they all move together. Never bet your whole stack on 1 idea.

Currently sitting in an ETH long (BTC entries didn't hit) but trading [this previously posted BTC Chart] (https://www.tradingview.com/x/4PI9lacX/).

Since $9990, each period of consolidation has been pushed down by the 21 Day EMA.  Before closing and entering back into short positions, I'm waiting to see what price does with it this time.  'Weekly Resistance 1' is keeping a lid on this for now... 

Will look for a good entry on some BTC longs above the 21 Day EMA if that's the way this goes.

EDIT: Grammar
Is there any possibility to (safely) import my GDAX api keys to professional trading software -- something like tradingview, which unfurtanetely doesn't have real-time orderbook updates. Software must be better than the native gdax books which has glitches/delays -- the data needs to be fetched as quickly as those bots get the data. I don't mind paying for this software; it just has to be from a company with a good reputation.

I am frustrated July 1 they will force the new platform on their users. GDAX was a mediocre product (you couldn't do any TA on the chart), but "Coinbase Pro" is just bad. Pretty much everything sucks except the 0% limit order fees.

Confirmed. We're going up bigtime sometime in the next few months.
Rising wedge looking like it could top at 7k. Expecting a break downwards due to low buying volume. Need another retest of 6k and a sharp bounce for me to ditch my bearish views. Otherwise, expecting to ride this all the way down to 3 to 4k.
Ive been in this space about a year now and have seen tons of YouTuber's talk about Tether., Articles written about it, and post's saying nobody trusts it.  However, I've never seen an interview with somebody that actually uses it, or somebody on here that admits to using it.  If anybody here uses it would appreciate your opinion.

The battle of Greater Fools continues.  So much opportunity here on both the sell and buy side.
I put a stop loss at $6700 like an idiot before going to bed last night. Figured if it drops again it probably wont come back to that level. 

And naturally... my stops hit on short term dip + full recovery. Now the price seems to be holding strong and I’m feeling bullish. I should stop trading and go back to holding.

Failure to Bart -- looks like Big Shorty doesn't have much left in the tank after the Sunday sucker punch dump. Bullish. Will add to my long in the unlikely event that we drop back down to 6500. I expect some big short covering tomorrow. We will see a 10 percent green daily candle at some point fairly soon.
Ok guys, another Triangle, I know we all love Triangle

so the tether report yesterday didnt tell us much new... but it seems it was discovered that one of the partners of tethers law firm, and advisers to their bank bank is affiliated or was affiliated with a casino that was raided by the us government.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-14/saipan-casino-operator-is-said-to-be-raided-by-u-s-agents

interesting read.
When can we just have a day of green...
I am extremely baffled how a ton of people here that still don't understand 6k is not the bottom. People are still saying triple bottom, rounded bottom, accumulation vs distribution, etc. 

Let me just give a small public service announcement:

6K WAS NOT THE BOTTOM. PLEASE WRAP UR MIND AROUND THIS. THANK YOU

P.S. - Just because 6k is not the bottom, doesn't mean we are going to goblin town at 2-4k. Breaking 6k and making new lows does not automatically mean it is the apocalypse. We can EASILY make a slightly lower low in the 5s and THAT can very well be the bottom. It all depends on price action once we get there. But that 6k is not the bottom is a certainty.

Anyone used/redeemed TUSD? After this latest tether news my confidence is pretty shaken and am thinking of converting most of my tether holdings.

Bears forever shorting. Hope the next bull run will last 7 months. Enough of this crap.
Thanks for writing this out got wrapped up at work and didn’t have time to respond.

During periods of low volatility it looks like it gradually climbs up, where June is the starting point of the climb. 

September *should* be interesting 
Thanks for posting that. You're a voice of reason in this chaos of bias (hyped either way). Truly appreciated.

Edit: What's the reason for not including 2017 in the projecting from stability chart?
Fundus are safu 
Probably the most hacked exchange on the planet with the worst security.  Damage is lower than reported.  As if there's a bright side to this.  They should be shut down.

Ya know, CG.  you are kinda like the sportier version of Chewy.  Kinda louder and but still similar styles. :-P  Good luck on your trade, bro.

[Here you go](https://strawpoll.com/p6yb73r5)
The fact that alts are looking absolute shit makes me think this is distribution
So you want to get out of your long before the big move......

And what is your question?

What do you make of the uptick in volatility this morning?  Seems like someone is protecting the 6.7k level pretty hard (but not a lot of follow through).
I've been pretty much of the same opinion that this ascending wedge/channel we're in petty much mirrors 7K. That's why I'm still holding my underwater short. But for the sake of counter argument, the 6K range has been pretty much the bottom since ATH. Defending this range is much more important. I think it was Sloppy but I might be wrong, that argued that if we see 5.9 we'll pretty much see 5.5. That's why I think one more push to 7K has a very decent chance of happening. Letting this range fall is too much psychologically.
Hey man I noticed the exact same pattern, I think Sloppy also pointed it out and many others would also see the ere similarities to the range we were in before 7.6k fell. 

However, I am thinking that in 7k range, we still had the room to fall, whereas over here *(I do not say that there is no more room to fall)* but, we have bottomed in this range before at 6k, then returned here another time before starting a small rally to 10k. Now we are here again.

One thing I find different from from 7k range is that here we have a strongly rejected 6.1, other than that it is all similar from the looks of it. And the way 6.1 was rejected, it changed my views short term and I took out sub 5k out of the equation. Not sure if that short term period has ended but this is crazy. haha.
Or bear pennant

Moral of story: El-Fuck’oed 
It could be, but that would be them attempting to incite FOMO with their own money (not a short squeeze).  I think that's a bit of an unlikely scenario, but who knows man...
Rounded bottoms yes...we are not making a rounded bottom right now. 
what if it's Soros quietly distributing? lol.

edit: sorry for the shit post.  In all seriousness, we need a Wyckoff guy to answer that (a la Sloppy).  If you remember a few days ago, there was an accumulation meme.  Maybe it will play out that way, but it's notoriously hard to differentiate between accumulation and distribution from my limited understanding of Wyckoff analysis.
Look at the volume around the top>bottom of the last volume on a weekly timscale. You have rapid sell off then it tapers over weeks/months and then it picks up again just after enough big players have filled their bags. people who dont adapt and high leverage end up prolonging the pain because of overshooting in both directions.

Volume kind of makes sense to use against price instead of time so you can see how much btc was purchase at those levels therefor how many people may panic once the price hits below that level. Like when we fell through 8.2 which is the price point with the highest volume we dropped pretty damn quickly. here's a quick chart to show you what i mean. it also makes 8.2 some strong resistance.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/xkqVdXEN/
This guy does some fantastic analysis using volume like OBV & CMF. I can't find them quite right now but on his TV page he has tutorials on using obv and cmf both of which would have been really helpful on the 1d 7 4-12 hour charts, bearish vol div and a tight doji are perfect short setup especially if TD or ichimoku systems. I found OBV to be very useful in the bear market especially on a 12 hour TF (but I have been playing longer position, I have 2 trades about a month old and a high level short from around here from days.

Define sideways? We've been effectively inside a $40 range today, but wicks are about $100 wide. That's 0.6%-1.5%, and you'd have to use percentages for the range. It traded mostly inside a $20 range for months back in the $400s, I believe. 

edit: this is the closest recent (identical scale)

then: https://www.tradingview.com/x/sFBh8LJ6/

Depends on how you define sideways:

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/EwsyTSJs-Projecting-From-Stability/

27 weeks is the absolute longest I can identify. Extreme periods of stability seem to be around two months most of the time.
Come on guys that was funny.
Yeah just gut feel- I'm getting close to closing or at least expecting upwards movement. It would break our pattern of drop 20% bounce 10% 
> If we were to go back into the symmetrical triangle, I just freaking give up. I just can't see that happening, since a throwback to the bottom of that triangle again would be such a beautiful short entry with stops above the line.

That is what I am concerned about. Getting back into this huge triangle. I feel like whales/extraterrestrials/collective mind will lure/push us there...   Just because it is f. incredible!
If we get there and stay for a while, In this case I will probably close my short. But I am not sure this plan is correct. 
Are there any comparable examples in past? When bitcoin convincingly left old formation just to get back later in like as if this had never happened. Sorry if this sounds stupid. I have asked about this a day ago but got downvoted . Total noob here :)
I thought I was having a stroke for a moment, that is hilarious
wtf is this..
that bot is clearing out the liquidity 0.001 btc at a time lmao 
imagine the fees
Some or most of [these concepts](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/future-bitcoin-what-lightning-could-look/) implemented, another year of increasing adoption, some payment processor and a little POS acceptance. Maybe late next year or 2020.
POS acceptance as others have said. Also wallet support and the wallet experience. There's two sides to every transaction.
It needs to be stable enough for us to trust it with real world money as opposed to "oops I just lost a few grand due to a coding error". Once it's ready for mission critical deployments then it can start to have an impact. Wait until the RCs start rolling out.
Clients without needing to run a node.
To team up and be used by square POS systems. 
Cross coin swapping being cheap and effective would likely lead to another bull run of a level of insanity we can only dream if.

Effectively zero fees, and no oversight makes for an orgy
All of the below, plus exchanges implementing it, so their clients can buy bitcoin and then immediately load it into a channel. After that, transferring coins to and from the exchange can be done instantly via lightning.
Solving the routing problems to the point it's noob friendly and widespread wallet support. Many popular wallets don't even support segwit yet, so...
Good luck! I'm thinking along the same lines as you here. 
Both, until the other pattern plays out. Though I’m leaning towards a rising wedge as ascending triangles don’t really appear right after a strong down move.
It's amazing how that looks almost exactly the same as $7ks. Down to people mistaking it for an ascending triangle (it's not - least according to Mr Grumps aka p Brandt) 

It's just a regular old bear pennant/flag
Just because you are all-in long and hoping that the price will go up, doesn't mean that others won't be willing to sell here.

The bigger question that I have asked myself recently is this: why would people build a major long position here knowing that at 7k and above you are likely to have a whole bunch of sellers coming in (consisting of short sellers and underwater longs looking to get out). The risk/reward is terrible for a long here.
How did you trade for gold? Are you talking about literal gold? Why? 
I would take a look at the historical ratios of ETH/BTC and then decide. Right now, it seems to be a little over the mean of the two recent extremes (0.12 and 0.025, IIRC). That means i personally would go something like 60:40 or 70:30 (BTC:ETH) as you proposed yourself. You could then rebalance depending how the ratio develops. 
That all depends on which one you think is a better investment, longer term.   I wouldn't buy either one right now for long-term investment, but ETH still may have farther to correct than BTC, because it was up so astronomically last year.  

I would wait until the market shows a more convincing bottom before buying.   Of course you may lose out on some upside, but better than losing 50% in a few months if you buy now.   It's all risk and reward and you must calculate it, based on all the variables as you see them.
There are as many answers as people in this sub. The top options are: 1) based on your gut confidence in the two; 2) more in the one you think is more undervalued; 3) 50/50; 4) ratio based on the ratio of their market caps. 
There are much better altcoins than ETH. Dash and Litecoin have both been around the block, and there are others. I wouldn't have more than 10 percent of my crypto in ETH, personally. 
At current levels, no one really know, but technicals suggest more downside.  Long term, I think everyone in this sub believes in Bitcoin's upside though, else why would we be wasting our time here?

Edit: also, instead of relying on news, why not learn some TA and join the fun? :-P
tim draper said we will be @ $250k by 2022.. so thats that. lets get pamping .
2014 had a string of incredible news. However most of the time good news is some distant development that might come good some day. 

Bad news is instant. Good news rarely is. When things are bullish there's no need for a reason. It just is. 
> And does anyone here think there's a chance it won't go over $10k?

Yes, of course.

I realize that people hate probabilities in this sub and everything is 100% or 0% to them, but of course the odds of BTC going over $10K someday is over 0.0%.


Gheee.. if someone know all your questions he will be a hero.


We had these questions before when we were around 600$ and 2k.  And nobody could answer them also.. at that time.
At this moment I just blaming the shorting and market manipulation and futures.
Only one out of seven past bubbles demonstrates the performance you're projecting.

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/EwsyTSJs-Projecting-From-Stability/

Also, Bitcoin retraced ~60 - 90% from peak in past bubbles.


A rounded bottom to 3-4k takes us out of the rainbow for the first time since 2011.

https://www.moonmath.win

For it to be a rounded bottom we'd stay out of the rainbow for multiple months or years... Which shows your projection implies that the halving will have no impact on the price of Bitcoin until after the event.

10 10k bitcoin, $1000 would mean we are in for a long bear market and where is the fun in that.
This is actually a pretty interesting thought exercise.

I would be a lot more likely to hold the 10 $10K coins than the 100 $1K coins. 
100k $ is 100k $... doesnt matter
>100 $1000 Bitcoin

Obviously this. A lot easier to 10x from 1k than from 10k.
Easily 100 1k coins. 

Solely for the reason I missed the entire run up from 1k and It would be interesting to watch.

I’m also young and in no rush with crypto 
For people in FIAT...probably a 100 at $1,000

But assuming you don’t just have $100k in cash, you won’t have your 100 $1000 BTC unless you sold your 10 BTC at $10,000.
The 10k coins of course. Crypto would almost be considered a fad at some point by many. 
100 $1,000 Bitcoin because fuck these decimals.
Good question, sir!
Depends on how many coins you're starting with really. You can make some good trades to end up with the 10, or some bad ones to cut your stack down to 100 (and if you started with more than 100 getting knocked all the way down to 10 even at $10k would be depressing)
100 $10,000 Bitcoin
Both
Are you saying we are gonna get another DCB? :-p
You cut a lot of wicks. I'd focus my attention more on waiting for the downtrend line from each local top to break. You'll get in even earlier as well.
You are right that we are all very lucky. 

Even getting a proper real-time trading platform for stocks  (i.e. without a middle man setting "prices") is impossible in my country without spending a fortune. Yet in crypto can trade anything around the world in seconds.

Pretty sure in 10 years we'll look back fondly on these early times.

This market is ridiculous right now. 
A sideways dildo is always ribbed with bumps tho
I hope it won’t go flaccid 
there are plenty of vocal bulls here, but the sub as a whole clearly skews bearish right now. Given the price action of the last month, this does not surprise me, and recently bears have been right more often than not.
kinda rare to see this place more split than 60/40.  Unless someone is trolling the poll, it seems pretty skewed.
the greater good
Yes it’s wrong. You should be ashamed of yourself.  UNTRU FAN ALERT!!!

You're not letting them go unless the price  goes up 😜
Here comes the push for it.

edit: well, that was underwhelming
There is nothing wrong with making a lot of money shorting then using it to go long bitcoin when the price is in the low 4 digits.
Volume  is on the lower side with this drop, maybe this thing has one or two more barts before the floor falls out
People downvoting without actually reading. FYI not actually a terrible read.
Thought that was an excellent read. Thanks 
This could as well be the point of maximum financial ruin
Good read. This is definitely the outlook and time scale that carries the most weight for me. If that curve stays true, hodlers are in for a lot more gainz.
Good read, looking good to see psychology being correlated with the charts for the first time. 
Except this rally started sub 1k, this is not even close to depression it barely just made first lower low this year
Was the rest of that 1k buy wall (500 BTC) just pulled or eaten? 500 of it were eaten 2 hours ago. 

EDIT: looks like it was eaten by the spikes of shorts and longs.

not sure if I'm old or have ADD (or both), but I can't read your chart at all.  I'll just take your word and hedge it. 👍
I did not hedge my long. But I will add to it in a big way at 6500.
Yeah it did feel pretty good when we went up a lot :)

You're my hero.
That should tell you something about your line.
That's a small time frame, short trendline that carries little relevance.

That means that line was not important. Time to redraw and re-evaluate.
I'm out of position for now, only risk a short around 6800 and very tight stops (or maybe long 6200 if we bounce there again) 
Your line isn't important to the market. This one will be. Watch for 6600. The reason my line will carry more significance is because it begins from our most recent low of 6107 (Bitfinex)

Oh just wait 
Yea, you can do it with https://tensorcharts.com somehow I think. 

With bitcoinity you can also turn off transactions less than 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 5 btc. It makes it a lot easier to see what's going on without the noise.

CryptoPanic feed? What is this you speak of?
You're trying way too hard to break the fourth wall. Using the sentiment on a exclusively crypto related board to analyse crypto market sentiment seems silly.

99% of people still browsing are enthusiasts so more than likely bullish. Especially after a few days of no real volatility.
I think it's just more that intelligence is upvoted and ignorance is downvoted. At least I hope that's the case. I haven't been to another crypto sub in months because they're just a bunch of dumpster fires, but it's relatively balanced here. If someone provides a well-analyzed case for either side here, it's generally received well. It's just the "go leveraged long now and thank me later" folks that rightfully get kicked to the curb. 
i have the total different View, well reasoned bearish View gets upvoted way more. anyway, voting by a few People in reddit is still no Sentiment:)
Actually you saying that you want to be right.
But the 1D MACD has crossed bullish.
The weekly MACD is now below 0 and ready to curl up.
The weekly Stochastic RSI is crossing bullish in the oversold territory.

Furthermore the 4h MACD bearish cross has been protected the last couple of days with intense buys. 

Its all about timeframe and indicators can pretty much say anything
The demand is just too high at this level
Failure to Bart. Bullish AF.
I can't trust this shitty TA..
I wouldn't count the top of this wedge out just yet. 
Could play out with a windup sort of like this: https://imgur.com/a/StRm0ZC

less volatility is good for the asset, good for long term investors, bad for traders.  Good because lenders hate volatility which causes defaults, and that's where all the money comes from.  Bad because no short term profit opportunities for traders.



Very good analysis, but I would add that Bitcoin has seen flat periods before. What usually happens is a gentle upward slope followed by an explosive move up. This period (the past four months or so) will look flat as a pancake relative to a much higher ATH, just like periods in 2014-2016 look now, though they felt volatile at the time.
Volatility signal 

e: just saying every time this has been posted we made a big move in the next 3 days 
I suspect we'll get some of that after the final bottom is in. It's what happened in 2012 and 2015. About 1 year of low volatility uptrend before the bull cycles got heated.
FGS I don't give a shit about downvotes (edit: or upvotes for that matter). But please show you're not brain-dead and give arguments why you down or upvote. To keep a discussion alive.
Looks like a  lot of people are coming back in. Not just one fella.

Unpopular opinion but all these big wicks shooting straight up look like accumulation to me. Like a race to buy as much cheap coins before everyone catch on to what's going on.
If you look at the Eth [chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/0920Huqg/), it's more telling.  Someone is really defending the support line.  Here it is zoomed [in](https://www.tradingview.com/x/oj2gSeJr/)

Strategies are your own.  Come up with a handful of ideas that you think might give an edge.  Back test them.  Trash the bad ones.  Refine the decent ones.  Retest.

Pick a model or a few models and trade them.  You have done the backtesting that gives you expected outcomes over time.  That only works if you stick to the plan of the model.

You were saying?
Down to 3 - 4k..

It is getting crazy here. 
I've been here for ages, and I've always wondered who uses it too. Everyone I know (not that many people) wouldnt touch it even with someone elses barge pole.
I never used it until very recently, mostly because I wasn't really trading anything that didn't have fiat pairs. I had a small side project going on Binance though, and moved to tether on the daily pennant breakdown. It's under 5% of total holdings, though, so I'm not really concerned. 
Most people who use it probably aren't aware of what the issues are. They see it on their exchange, think 'cool' and park for a while until they go in to their next coin. 

I can't imagine any more than an infinitesimal number of people actually try to extract real USD via attempting to redeem USDT through Tether themselves. Now Bitfinex do real USD again I doubt anyone at all does or needs to. 
I've used it on bittrex plenty of times. However, the only fiat to tether on ramps I've seen (much more important IMO) is on the whale pool via YouTube. 
I trade on Bittrex and I trust them so I use it all the time. I trade most of their USDT pairs. I only trade BTC pairs when I am certain we are in a bull market because it's like having a leveraged position in bitcoin and if I am doing BTC pairs in a bear market I'll lose more. 
Thanks for the responses i take it as good news that Tether is used on a bunch of exchanges
What many people do now at least on Binance is when they're finished with a day's trade they store it as [TrueUSD](https://www.trusttoken.com/trueusd/) (TUSD), which is redeemable for actual USD 1-for-1, and unlike Tether it's also audited. 
I use it. Scared everytime I use it, will be the time some report comes out that their insolvent. 
So... you are a fool?

Its more [like this](https://prnt.sc/jxk0n1) And its a bear pennant and the likelihood of it breaking down is higher than up. Even if it breaks up, it'll stop dead in its tracks if it touches the bottom of the other triangle.

Well I guess that’s a rhetorical question and we all know the answer. They did initially go to a legit accountancy firm. But it didn’t work out too well for them.
Erm. 6/17 - 6/19.
Can I ask how you are so certain? As of right now it seems more like you're just shouting for no other reason than to be heard, kind of like the crazy guy on the bus.

tether will be audited only after USD is audited.
Don't see how this was FUD. An independent organisation monitored the flow and saw no discrepancy. Was it a full audit? No. Were their accounts empty as some seem to imply? No. Looks like Tether is solvent. It would be pointless and reckless of them to have a small discrepancy.  If it was a scam or in danger of collapse the accounts would not be at or even close to the tether in circulation. The only FUD I see is people assuming there is a problem where there is no evidence of one.
So you happily use Tether when the only proof of funds was from nearly 1 year ago (when Tether had a much smaller circulation). Yet now they show they have funds to cover alll Tether you are concerned?

I think you have that the wrong way round!
Ummm did you even read the article? It still isn't an audit, but I don't see how this has you "shaken"
Sell it for btc then sell your btc to USD.   SIMPLE.   No need to make an issue out of nothing.
Where can I look up the audit of TUSD? Or any other exchange for that matter. Getting tired of the Tether fud.
Daily reminder that gold is in a downtrend
Get out of here with your safe investments. I want to make Yolo trades on extremely speculative assets. 
Stop blaming the price decline on shorters and bears, they are just trying to do what's most profitable in the current market and are not that cause of this 6 month decline 

Enough of this crap
This is misplaced rage, man. This is not shorters. Shorts are decreasing here and longs are increasing.

This is hodlers becoming hedlers. 
aren't you the guy that wanted a petition started to investigate CME/CBOE for manipulation because the price hasn't kept going up since December?
Alternatively, no new developments all summer and we just cruise sideways, just above the cost to mine, until something throws a wrench in the stability. Honestly, a stretch of 3-4 months without much change would probably iron a lot of wrinkles out.
There aren't any substantially stable periods in 2017

Thanks Pan’s. Chew definitely has more Street Cred than me as I’ve only been trading for 118 days now. 

We should know relatively soon if my trade was good or bad. 
Yep and Chewy went short at around 6500.. and is screwed 
thanks. Most have no idea but definite bias for this is distribution 
So, if you believe in distribution, who is distributing and at which price levels did the buy? Are people thinking that these sophisticated Market Making Distributors bought last year around 3-4K (or lower), passed up the chance to distribute at triple or more on the way up to the ATH, and are now distributing at $6.7K? 
have you considered that perhaps the reason alts are looking like shit and BTC is remaining relatively stable/moving up slightly is because people are selling their alts to buy BTC?
When demand for alts goes down people tend to hold Bitcoins. The flow of value is from tether to alts and bitcoin to alts. THey basically don't flow back unless there's some kind of squeeze. Their price is set based on the flow of other assets. You can't run out and buy $100 USD worth of NEO from coinbase or gemini. That's not a thing. People aren't cashing out tether for USD, either. That whole market is based on an influx of money that will fatigue at some point. WHen it's stressed it will move into tether or BTC...

What happens when the flow of value reverses from alts to BTC?

I would think it's the opposite

Lol but maybe not yet. Looks like it's gonna be foreplay for some time. With lots of erectile dysfunction.
Rabbits go flat sometimes as well (arms and legs stretched out, lying flat on the floor) usually a few moments after they've been running and/or jumping around hyperactively. So there goes that theory.

We've added a number of longs since we popped up to 6700. I think folks are looking to defend those positions. I'm sure I'm not the only one seeing the similarities to 7500. The more money they throw at their problem without breaking resistance and simply defending support will just make the drop that much worse, if it comes. 
The rejection off 6100 really wasn't all that different from the rejection off 7050. 

7050: https://www.tradingview.com/x/I8jAZ6oI/  
6100: https://www.tradingview.com/x/HZJL1Zfc/  

It was a little bit stronger, though, you're right. I do think we're less likely to break down from 6700 than we were at 7700. Every move down gets harder as liquidity gets thicker. I'm rolling with the trend, but risk/reward at this stage is getting iffy on shorts. If I didn't have a prime short entry decently above where we are, I'd be wary to open here. I'd rather wait for a breakdown of 6400. 
Oh shit I didn’t even notice the pennant. Yeah... 
Because Soros had 7+ months of (much) better prices with (much) better buy volumes to distribute? 

Edit to your edit: you don't usually have distribution periods following a markdown, at a price level that's basically lowest of the cycle. We haven't spent nearly enough time lower than this for any serious accumulation to happen, so unless you believe big players are somehow still exiting positions from before last summer, distribution here makes no sense.
How do you show those bars?
Just recently, we've been doing the same thing for about 11 days in the 7.1K-7.7K range. The current sideways movement (6.1K-6.8K) has been going for 8 days now. Any day now, those BBands are gonna get too tight...

https://www.tradingview.com/x/VpBpYzvY/

 
To rephrase, what’s the longest we have moved sideways before a bart.

The $6700-$6750 range I would consider sideways with the occasional wick to $6680 or $6775. The “ Top of the Barts Head” is really what I’m referring to. 


Was waiting for you to jump in with this chart. It’s a great reference. 

If this is only the beginning of our prolonged bear market and 27 weeks was the longest time period in the past for low Volatility... we are looking at some seriously boring BTC in the future 
Here's what that looks like when it's cleaned up

Can't believe I missed this chart when it was published. Great work...I remember watching the stability numbers back in the day before the run up to $250
Fine, I change to upvote... Thought he was trolling rather than being funny :-P
WTF? Up is down, left is right? 
Sloppy thats a buy signal right there haha. 
I'm expecting an upmove in the short-term, too. But I'll just short it at this point.

I think we've been falling a lot faster than in 2014, which does open the door to see more counter-trend rallies compared to 2014. But its getting to the point where...how many people will keep falling for it?
Sloppy turning bullish!?!? ;D
I don't know, man. Sure it could bottom out here, but we're doing the same bear flagging that took place in the 7K-7.7K range (log chart):

https://www.tradingview.com/x/vttJvzly/

The pink lines are actually completely parallel. 

I guess short term it would get interesting in the 7k-7.2K range. In that tight range we have the bottom of the symmetrical triangle we fell down from (blue line), and the downtrend line form 10K (green). I guess it's a buy if it breaks those levels, but around 7K could also be a good short entry with stops at 7.3K or so.
hilarious, but it also kind of worked slowing down that lovely red dildo- so im sad for now
like really, when there is finally some great action
RIP
Thanks this is super helpful
[deleted]
Cheers mate! Just be careful with your entry and stops in that case. I do not have any stops yet as I am monitoring the charts myself. Good luck to you too.
Because it's formed after a down move, yeah?

If it'd formed after an up move, it'd be an ascending triangle, likely to break up, right?
i put away money every month into crypto, gold, stocks, bonds, and houses. i dont expect any will appreciate but they do eventually. i dont usually cash anything out but recognize the bubble cycles of btc, and trade tbe ratios (rebalance the portfolio). i think longing the stock markets here is more dangerous than crypto here
>How did you trade for gold? Are you talking about literal gold? Why? 

There are numerous OTC brokers who will exchange your crypto for gold bars, including one of my old companies in Vancouver. Crypto used to be primarily used and promoted by those who don't trust banks or fiat. These people prefer gold bars to bank drafts or piles of cash.

Thanks! Yeah I guess I'll start with 70:30 (BTC:ETH) and maybe next year going for 50:50, depending on ETH adoption. The plan is to first keep it until 2020 and then re-evaluate it again for the next 3 or 5 years.
Thanks for the advice. Well, i'm already in BTC since the beginning of this year (buying the dips ;-)). Just thought about spreading some of my BTC to ETH or invest some new money in ETH as well.

In my opinion, LTC doesn't do anything new compared to BTC. DASH I can't say much about, didn't read into it yet.
I was actually surprised at how many of the frequent contributors here don't believe in bitcoin long term (not that they should, it's their opinion, which is fine). I'm not going to call people out, but I've heard from several people that the reason they are trading this market has nothing to do with believing in the long term potential, but rather because they believe it's the biggest collection of dumb money ever assembled, and they feel they have an advantage. If returns here dry up, they will move on to something else and that's fine too.
Damn sounds like someone got burned REALLY bad
As much as I love this chart, those projections are starting from stability. I'm measuring it from the peak, which, of course, could be wrong. But also, all of those projections have us staying at this bottom for the next month or two before starting a new bull run. If we continue to stay in this range for that long, I will definitely reconsider my position. So I'll wait for us to break 6k sometime before the end of July or mid August. If we stay above 6k for that long I'll buy back in.
I saw that, too. I hope he kept his bitcoin!

I actually think the majority of people believed it to be a scam or a get rich quick scheme. There was large scale mania but I don't think even 10% of the U.S. bought BTC in December. As for a use case, it already has one, a store of wealth. What percentage of people own gold? And yet it has a massive market cap, solely because of what it is and that "institutional money" pay a lot for it. BTC can have the same market cap as gold if it can mature to that point. 

I think we're saying the same thing though, which is that BTC needs to keep maturing as an asset to see further growth. 
[removed]
I agree here, $1000 BTC and the future of crypto as a whole would be pretty bleak.
It does if you want to make more $$$ :-P
Good, now you are a millionaire.
lol...
You know what's funny? I killed a cat today with my car by accident. It didn't bounce. It was dead. I feel bad about it even though it wasn't my fault and there was nothing I could do to prevent it.

The Bitcoin cat is very much alive. Dead cats go to zero. Trust me on this. I held Nortel to zero.
I think you're missing the forest I was pointing at.
Amen, the poorer you are, the higher the barrier to entry to the traditional financial market. With crypto all you need to get started is a decent smartphone and an internet connection. I understand that its still a lot for some but comapred to traditional finance, its nothing
>Pretty sure in 10 years we'll look back fondly on these early times.

Could not agree with this more. The early days of the internet (early-mid 1990s), felt very similar to me and I think we'll look back at these days as the wild west. "Can you believe back in 2017 you were able to buy a random ass alt that went through no vetting process on margin WITH leverage?!" We shall see

Every single post in here the last fucking week has been people claiming to predict what’s going to happen. Nothing has happened in weeks. I get that it’s a trading sub and prediction is the whole point. It’s just getting laughable at this point.
Bitcoin will never go under 5000 
I know, I'm short and have only taken on long scals since the 12k rejection. I was referring to the comment that was a single paragraph rant about traders in general in a trading sub saying we need to get a life etc. Like why hang out in a trading sub if your just going to troll everyone and I'm sure he think the market naturally went to 20K and is being suppressed by greedy billionaires or something ever since. Somehow people still find it hard to comprehend that bitcoin tends to bubble and it generally hasn't got FA to do with fundamentals once it gets going(although fundamentals usually kick start a run)
It's interesting how ETH and LTC (and other alts I assume) are not recovering. 

LTC ratio is at a 5 month low and won't stop dropping...Wish I would've added more! 

But yea. Sadly just a lil dump 
I think that was 20k tbh
Not unless you subcribe to "buy high, sell low"
Yes, scooped up entirely... 
So in a bull market the price goes up, in a bear market it goes down

Thanks fam
Thanks for sharing .. wow it really looks like a massive bear flag
Yes thanks for sharing, I know the bear pennant breaks out lower, but it is not a certainty. One order of 600 BTC pushes price to ~~7300~~ 6820 and the buy wall is still there.

I suspect that the bulltard posters are all the same person.  Since someone suggested RES to me (was it you?), I've been ignoring them all and the daily has gotten substantially better.   The only exception I give is to /u/Crypto_Chad69 since he's actually funny.
yea absolutely -  certainly is another factor to consider - especially on this sub which, as you said, has a more matured perspective - which is why I sometime dip into CC just to see what the kids are up to.
 Agreed small sample - but perhaps i should clarify - CHANGE in sentiment over the last day or two. Anyways - subjective as I said. Its all about bearish vs bullish sentiment at the end of the day - so ill take any measurable indicator I can see and at least factor it into my considerations. No? 
Yes please - I would very much like to be right! 
Indicators crossing into oversold isn't bullish. in a relatively longer term bull market it's a good place to buy the dip on shorter time frames, but there is nothing inherently bullish about indicators being oversold
Think we looking at different 1H time frames. Its 2012 right?
What if I told you... demand hasn't even begun.

[deleted]
His suspicion isn't necessarily completely of out place if you think about it. A lot of anomalous shit happened during last few days. A sudden volume spikes at the same time every 2 days, 3 times in a row. A sudden huge buy wall appearing minutes after the last spike like that which basically been keeping 6700 in place for days now. A huge hidden wall on Friday on Bitfinex which ate hundreds of coins for a few hours. A very tame reaction to Bitthumb news, with the panic sell off likely stopped by the buy walls. At the same time stopping Bitcoin's downtrend would only be in the whole ecosystem's favour (miners, exchanges, futures people, etc). Hard to say if this is an actual "conspiracy". Maybe several entities came to the same conclusion and acted in coincidental sync, but clearly bigger buyers methodically appeared and still seem to reinforce 6700.

And sure, many people returning as well as many started to realise that maybe the tragic pessimism about a possible catastrophic decline was premature. And that would be a direct consequence of the "stopping" of the downtrend.
Exactly the line I'm watching.. Let's see
...or spoofing to bait bulls and facilitate distribution as we've seen now for 6 weeks. The Bitfinex buy wall is now a bear flag meme, until it's not. Perfect bullish higher-low wedges have been sculpted and they all eventually broke down with a vengeance. This time could ofc be different;) Stay safe and stop loss longs
goes both ways, and it's not just now. its constantly like this for 2-3 months now whenever we are going sideways
All your eggs = all your trading capital.


One basket = all long (or short) ideas in  correlated markets.
Yes. I want tether alternatives (see: "I'm thinking of converting my tether"). Hence why I'm asking about TUSD. 

EDIT: Edited my original post.
Everyhing is bit more clumsy, the orders/fill section is too small (for many orders), the other parts feel just too large, navigating between different markets takes more time, the color scheme/fonts are more ugly -- and just like GDAX the orderbook/chart/volume has glitches and doesn't always update accurately
Alts are not recovering as fast as BTC. in fact they're not really recovering. It looks like most are down 3-6% today with btc only down -1.5% 

I wonder what's gonna happen 
This volatile asset will be volatile in the next several months. Guaranteed. 
lol -_-
Wait until you see 1k 
only exchange that accepts it is Bitfinex right?
is it really worth the risk for you to use it?  and do you have a wallet that stores it or you keep it on the exchange?  I believe bitfinex is the only exchange you can use it with?
Everybody plays the fool...sometimes.
Long term doesn’t mean short term 
Sure, say that to my BTC balance
No leverage, just wanted to sell a couple at 6700 before it dipped again
not when it is coming from someone who is *always* bullish.  I'm sure he feels better about himself by picturing the market as one solitary evil guy who makes it his goal to keep diydude from making a profit too.
I'm starting to wonder how strong a resistance the bottom of that other triangle will prove to be if we go up there. Because it offered no support whatsoever on the way down on June 10th. We went straight through it, and hard.

According to them they can't find an accounting firm that will take them up on the offer.
I work for a big 4 firm and I can tell you now audit firms will not touch this right now - the point is to give reasonable assurance that those numbers are free of material misstatement. The tech is too new and the audit and accounting standards issued by the regulatory bodies just hasnt caught up yet.  Sure PWC, EY and the rest are looking into the blockchain (and even investing in it - look at vehain etc.) - but auditing something like tether is a whole different story. 
Auditor isn't dumb enough to fall for what they are doing, fraud probably 
No
There is no reason to be certain about it. Yelling about it is kind of silly...although I think he genuinely is trying to "help" people
If you look at the current daily chart and the thought that 6k is the bottom even enters your mind you are a bad trader. Sorry, the truth hurts.

I’m certain Bitcoin going in 1 of 3 directions - upwards, downwards or you guessed it ..sideways
I will say, with 100% certainty, BTC price will go up, down or stay the same in 24 hours. 
sadly his post history indicates that is a likely possibility :( 

I have a feeling most inordinately angry buttcoiners with no understanding of the tech sold/got liquidated at the bottom 
nice, thanks for totally ignoring my question.
It wasn't independent. The guy is on the board of tether's bank.
I "happily" used tether when it was the only choice. At that point in time, I also felt they had legitimate reasons for not providing a real audit, but I no longer feel that is the case. Can you people actually answer the question?
Right, it provides no legitimate evidence and is from someone who is on the board of the bank tether uses. Meaning massive conflict of interest
There is no tether audit, only a lawyer's report [here](https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/FSS1JUN18-Account-Snapshot-Statement-final-15JUN18.pdf).

Apparently [this](https://www.bitstamp.net/s/documents/Firestartr_DD_Letter_for_Bitstamp.pdf) is the latest audit report of Bitstamp.

Please let me know if you can find audit reports for any other exchanges.
No shit, that's exactly why I'm asking about it. At the very least you can actually redeem TUSD... at least they claim.
Huh?

If gold is in a downtrend then certainly so is BTC.
Short it to x100 if you so confident.
Ignore list is growing.  No more room left on this guy's tag to add another negative note.
I’m generally ok with it. Seems like it’s healthy for the market and gives me time to accumulate more and DCA my way in to get my cost average down across the board. 

Recently I’ve been pondering about a possible scenario. Say we wiggle down to the $2000-$4000 range and settle there for the coming months, and we start to see volume come back while a rise in price. Our next “ Bull “ Market kicks in. Everyone thinks that BTC will hit 100k. But what if the next “ Bull Market “ is just another run from $2000- $15-$20000 and the cycle resets?


Well you see japanese does this thing with vowels when speaking english words, it is theorized that they have trouble with small words as they have thin eyes blurring their vision so they pad it on; the more you know.
I've been following trades in this sub and no one gets it right much more than half the time (even the experienced ones).  What I admire more is the ability to plan and execute, maximizing gains, and not have those runaway losses.  It takes certain level of intelligence and guts to pull that off IMO.

Anyway, we are all here to make money, so it's more fun to do it in good company.  Cheers.
> relatively soon

Heh, within 32 hours max.  (at least that's how long it is until eth has no more room in the symmetric triangle forming by the collision of it's smaller ascending wedge with it's larger descending channel)

edit:

> I’ve only been trading for 118 days now.

I think you are free of a lot of experience-based bias or habits that older traders have gotten used to.
He’s short from $6640 actually. He’s far from screwed. We have a ton of resistance ahead, I wouldn’t say he’s screwed until $7100-$7200 breaks. 

Otherwise. You’re talking out of your ass 
I have and my conclusion is: why would you start selling alts near the bottom if you think BTC is going to reverse trend? It should be the other way around, Bitcoin being stable and alts seeing re accumulation. 
You make good points. It just doesn't look healthy to me. The crypto market is automatically highly leveraged. When BTC goes up, alts go up too (in USD value) if the BTC ratio stays equal which for several months seems to be the case, I don't see many alts selling off when BTC makes an upward move. The opposite is also true, when Bitcoin drops and the ratio stays equal, alts automatically lose USD value. There's probably some arbitrage going on where there are USD/USDT pairs available to keep the ratio's in check. So there you have a mechanism that leads to highly inflated asset prices, especially if the velocity of the money supply is high, in November and December that was very much happening. Illiquid coins getting inflated, profits being redistributed and inflating other coins etc. Traders jumping from one coin to the next. Not much actual money was needed to bring valuations up by millions. Believe me, I had my fun 'pumping' shitcoins by absurdly higher values in marketcap than the money I actually used. It's pretty crazy to see this mechanism in action.  


In a way this phase in the market is like a deleveraging/deflation as happens during recessions and financial crises. Assets lose value that was never really there to begin with, it's inflated. When alts really start selling with BTC staying stable that means money is leaving the market/going to the sidelines and the overall effect on the total marketcap value is higher than it actually is. The velocity of money looks like it's still decreasing, unfortunately I don't have any number but the amount of volume and lack of action is a good indicator.

And yes, BTC should always be your main holding, it's my only one for the moment but I wouldn't even be holding it if it wasn't to trade with on Bitmex. I've even been taking profits out of the market to trade other stuff and what drove the market up so high was not only the average normie being sucked in and driving up the price, it was also big money from hedge funds or even banks doing the big trade volume. I mean the 1200 BTC wall getting taken down in minutes at 17000 with large market buys is not your average guy buying Bitcoin. People very much underestimate this. Money seeking returns and that is mobile (shifting through asset classes) has kind of left or is patiently waiting.  
Also, look at how alts have performed overall over the last 30 days:

https://coinlib.io/coins (see the list of period options in  the dropdown list in the top right of the table)

Things are not looking up for alts. There's no reasonable way to stay invested in this space long-term that doesn't put the majority your long-term holdings in BTC. If you aren't in BTC then you should absolutely be out of the market.
 $545,971,611 market cap is not definition of death in my opinion.  
This is more what is expected in death scenario: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitconnect/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitconnect/)
NEO, XRP, XLM, ADA, OMG, XMR, LSK... To name a few, don't pay attention to every single one, but the small cap shitcoins are the worst lol. BNB, VEN and BAT look pretty decent though
Why? People expecting a massive green dildo like in early april seem to be forgetting that alts had been moving before BTC and had pretty nice bottoms and breakouts a day or two in advance. That's why I'm paying so much attention to them this time. 
>but which color?

Doesn't matter, either can be traded. Without a liquid options broker, flat markets are incredibly boring, and not profitable, for traders. 
10x long on rabbits
They're pretty flat when strung up by the feet 
LOL
Fuck that was such a good a movie. Still remember seeing it in the theaters. 
Oh OK......
If enough people see the pattern, that makes it less likely to play out, no?

EDIT: But then if people realise everyone sees the pattern, does that invalidate the original invalidation? This could go fractal.
Longs are trending down, as are shorts. Longs went up slightly today. The rate of change is historically low. This is either distribution or accumulation.
Yeah 7050 looked like a bit more controlled whereas 6100 looked like sheer panic. Whilst I am rolling with day to day trends, I think it won't take long for me to turn sides to get into a profitable trade lol or better yet stay out of position for sometime, not really looking to get my nose stuck again like 7.7 haha.
Stop making sense!

edit: I will say that I'm not Sloppy, but something he said sounded plausible to me. It's possible that we're seeing distribution on lower time frames (people who bought at $6,200 selling now for a ~10% gain) and accumulation on longer time-frames (buying now with intention of marking up and distributing above). 


It's under volume profile main menu (theres a category for it not just the single indicator.
So the weekend dump is on track. :P
There's a 40 hour period or so starting around june 1 on the 4 hour chart.

Down from here seems too obvious 😜 But sometimes obvious is the hardest yet most sensible position to hold. 

Like $9990 being the top 
Need to think more- I'm just talking short term movements. 

The move will probably happen by the time I'm done thinking 😂

this is a tough spot. Shorting here is super obvious to the point where it's too obvious 
hahahaha not yet. We shall see 🤔 
Really, most of the TA says we're going down. It's super obvious, but we were hovering near the top of the range and it was making me uncomfortable. Every single time so far that has been a sell signal (just like /u/NostrilBob said)

I haven't really been *that* close to closing, but sitting near the top of our range for so long gets me antsy. 
Meh, I think you will get what you are looking for. Unless it was some whale DCA'ing a satoshi per/second.
[deleted]
Yes, sort of. In his words:

An ascending triangle reversal needs 3 lower touch points, whereas a continuation  only needs 2.

We broke down on our 3rd touch in $7ks, and right here we are basically touching our 3rd time right now. 

I could be misinterpreting this, but if we revisit $6800-6850 again I think it would be a valid ascending triangle. Not that it would break through, but that it would be formed.

2 things for me:

1. bear pennant is the larger formation and I'd defer to that
2. asc triangle is only $400 target (~$7200)

If you draw the trend lines a bit differently we basically just made our 3rd touch/are about to make our 3rd touch though. Like after this very recent drop. line is at $6630 for me 
Just seems like a silly thing to invest in. It’s hard to liquidate, in a true market crash it would be worthless, you’d be better off holding multiple fiat currencies with multiple financial institutions than playing federal reserve in your basement hoarding gold bars. Atleast the fiat is 100% secure, your only risk is if the world economy literally collapses to the point where we have no society. 
Then you might as well keep your money in the bank, that defeats the purpose. 
It is a lot of dumb money. What they don't realize is that they're the dummies. Selling Bitcoin for $7K will soon enough be seen as an extremely stupid financial decision.

I would like to thank them for giving away so much of their money over the past six months.
Trading is a hobby. Money is a hobby. Show me how to make 10&#37; a month trading pokemon cards from my couch and i'll glady do that instead. This is still the easiest money out there and untill volume is halved from here likely will be for a long time for something else to be better.
Lmao sounds like time for a poll?

ok. Here is 1 imaginary BTC sent to you courtesy of you hypothetical question. I now have 99 only.
Come on bro, you know that was a joke :-p
> I held Nortel to zero

This explains a bit about your investing/trading strategies
Santa's Enchanted Forest, maybe.
And then bloody sunday happens while you're sleeping when you're long and you didn't set stops and can't get to a computer while it's still happening when you wake up and you lose 90% of your trading stack, even after people warned not to get comfortable.
Same. I’ve woken up several times with the price being within a couple bucks. Crazy. 
lol I passed out watching charts and just woke up after a sweet long nap of 5 hours. Though I am a little confused, happy that my stops didn't triggered.
That is an excellent question, also for people in shorts who expect it to go to 5.5, do they plan to close around there or later?
Underwater short since $1k here...haven't taken an official loss yet
anyone who's tried to predict what's going to happen between $6300-6800 is being kinda silly imo. it's all chop 
A bit of friendly advice (I'm pretty sure your a better trader than me). Don't be so sure dude. I'm pretty sure I heard you share my story(it may have been someone else's but they were similar) and you have it saved in your favourites to remind you how not to get wrecked(I actually tried PMing you but I think I PMd the wrong person and my WP TS isnt setup on my PC to warn you at the time you said you where all in long). I actually wrecked the biggest position on a long during the correction down to 1800 and then trading basically flip flopping positions instead of trying to get every single move. That ruin was down to a fucking sticky keyboard as well as cross leverage basically instantly costing me around 100K in seconds but the rest was emotional/revenge trading and being too sure of myself. In my defense though I was going through benzo WD which took a full year to even begin to feel normal so trading wasnt a great idea. I'm building my stack back up slowly but just play the trend until you see the best possible trade. Your only preference should be the trend really. I seriously doubt once we find a bottom we're going straight to bull mode again we'd probably consolidate in a range between 3-5k for a few months and once we break 5K we'll probably do something very similar to 2015-17.

Take it easy pal because I know a big reason why I got wrecked was a fear of losing 90% in a bubble like I have a few times since 2011 and I was surrounded by people whop are telling me without a doubt every single person needs bitcoin and the experiment is an outstanding success which it isn't, yet(well it is but not really mass adoption ready - UI/UX definitely need some work for your average joe).

I think your either in a winning trade or took profit so congrats but remember to never say that bitcoin will 100% will or wont do because it does tend to do the unexpected, did anyone actually call for a 20K BTC before we hit 10K? We exceeded everyones expectations on the way up and I think we will on the way down too..
You don't know that mate
Yeah sure buying the top is always the biggest disaster, but a drop below 6k is the breaking point for the entire market. I think it will come as a surprise how much dumping will actually happen if we break down here, it's not going to be as slow and on relatively low volume as the previous weeks. That's why for now BTC is not seeing lots of bear volume and the dips are quickly bought. It's a last stand and it won't go down that easy. It's not like market makers or whales have that much interest in dumping at 6700, it's going to roll over slowly the coming days - if it's going to happen.

Are you saying it's high now? It is for me because I bought most of mine for $250 apiece. For a no-coiner, this is the best chance they're going to get to dump their bags of depreciating Monopoly bank fiat for as much real money as they can get.
Hey, you get it!
I assume you meant 6000 BTC?
OK, I'll edit.
What I don't get is they seem to have popped up about 2 months ago. Why, lol 
She is. I didn't say I liked her.
Yep. Keep watching it.
Rule 1
Just admit already that you're actually in this for my deep, insightful analysis and you go long with high leverage every time I make a new bullish comment.
You invalidated your indicator by explicitly mentioning it and then asking for downvotes. If you'd actually wanted to test it, you'd just post a well-reasoned bearish case without mention of sentiment/votes.
What? I'm talking about 1D timeframe
lol people probably downvoted cause it's not exactly spurring discussion. Just letting my fellow traders know what's up. We get one of these comments every few weeks and then price makes a spectacular move shortly after
Lol i thought you said you're trying to start a discussion, but it seems like you're just trolling.
Yeah I don't touch boats, what with the fact that they get wet and with the risk of plane crashes. 

Just not worth it is it?
? It has nothing to do with you. It's just every few weeks we get a "Is it good for BTC if it goes sideways" and then it dumps or something 

sorry for kinda shit posting on your comment. didn't downvote you 
So... actually you say ... nothing!!?
If you look at the daily and monthly charts, then we are clearly going down, not sideways.
For me all the eggs means all sources of income.

One basket refers to a single place where you invest income from all those sources, which isn't nice lol. heeh
OK, so you want to convert your tether to TrueUSD, sorry, misunderstood. Um no, I have not. But I tend to trust Bittrex since its US based more than off-seas exchnages and so if Bittrex is using it, I guess I would be fine with it.

But since trading like-kind tokens is a taxable event where I live, I guess I would typically only go to tether during brief periods and would traditionally go to fiat if I wanted "out."
It really begs the question why they just didn't rename gdax coinbase pro and call it a day
Whatever you say... if I look at your name. 😀
No, USDT is also used on Binance and Bittrex
Binance and Bittrex also use USDT. Though trex is now offering USD trading in some US states.
It seemed a drop was coming at the time (it did) so instead of riding my losses down or transferring back to GDax, I tethered up. No wallet, used on Binance. Mostly to give me a chance to buy back in without having to transfer to and from a USD exchange. Not saying its smart but it is what it is for now...
You can use/store it on most exchanges and on exchanges like Kraken you can trade it directly for USD. 
Well, 1 year ago we were at $2500. We're less than 3x that, and even I've bested that. But if long term > 1Y, you're absolutely right. 
*Turns to u/YRuafraid 's BTC Balance* 

Paper profits don't mean anything till you cash out
[Bulls tried to prevent it for like 10 hours](https://prnt.sc/jxkeuu). And thats after a very weak bounce off of it a few weeks prior, as bulls failed to push it passed 7.8k. It served as strong support spanning many months and it'll turn into resistance.
There was a twitter storm about it.
Probably can't afford them due to lack of fiat ;)
To do a full audit? Maybe I believe them. 

But to do what the law firm did, make a phone call to the bank and ask ‘hey, how much money you holding?’ I don’t think that’s believable.
They had auditor,  they were fired
But those were days of green...
Honestly, this level of certainty about the market is a buy signal for me. I've been arguing that we're going to go sideways/down, but you seem to be working hard to convince me to be a bull.

Not only that, the majority of this sub is bearish. So, your characterization of sentiment seems wrong, too.

If I see a couple "I sold everything and I've been holding for 8 years" stories then I'll probably take out a second mortgage.
When I look at the current daily charts, the thought that 6k is the bottom often enters my mind.  The thought that I'm a good trader enters my mind often as well.  It's too bad we can't compare our trades and PnL.  I guess time will tell who the truth hurts more.
This kind of certainty over the future is a great way to get rekt mate 
I mean I guess it's just getting borderline conspiracy theorist at this point though
That's the point I was trying to make, none of the exchanges have audits. except an audit of 2014 for bitstamp.
This user sounds like he's one more liquidation away from ragecrying in the bathtub. 

Learn the mechanics of leveraged trading.
How do you know he isn’t? Honestly I keep seeing “lol short it then buddy” or “lol long it then buddy” as if they aren’t doing that already. 
Long it to x100 if you so confident 
I think Bitcoin will find a way to thread the needle and disappoint everyone to the point of hair pulling frustration before it plays out a predictable scenario.

Whatever it hasn't done it will do, but not in a way that makes sense until after the fact.
A few more months of data in the position bot should help to analyze those strategies better
Posted this Yesterday:

Here we are on hour 23.. 

Although I’m a new trader ( Kinda?) I’ve learned a handful. I’m not Perma Bear or Perma bull, I’ll change mindsets with the way the market moves. Being Perma anything can hurt you if your not willing to dabble into both sides. 
> I wouldn’t say he’s screwed until $7100-$7200 breaks. 

He basically said the same thing about his RR, about looking to bail around 7k.
Thank you.
It will
If I saw the price of alts dropping, and thought an alt culling was imminent, I would take whatever I could get from my alt holdings and convert it to BTC.
That’s a lot of hyperbole in one comment.

Backtests don’t back up your assertions.

Https://shrimpy.io/backtests

You can see that adding btc or even eth to nearly any portfolio you can create just reduces the gains last year.  You can say the future will be different, but people have been saying that for a long time and it never is.  I’d rather rely on what the data and backtests say.
Agree.
Got only a few k in ETH & LTC.
Just to see how they do.... but in general they follow the master... BTC
XMR is extremely unlikely to die.  


XRP deserves to, but I suspect it too will not die. XLM may actually carve itself out a niche and find long term use cases too.  


I don't know about the others.
Well, I think that because so much trash has been flushed down the toilet, there's not much more room for a lot of alts to fall. To me I think this is a bullish sign that the market has been pruned and corrected is now ready to continue higher. 
Ya know I kinda wondered if I would ever just cash out and leave and I thought of all the reasons I would.

I never really thought simply being really bored would be one of them...but maybe that's exactly what the bottom will look/feel like? 🤔

I'm sure some LTHs wouldn't mind people like me getting bored and leaving 😅
Man, it's so hard not to get sucked into the double-thinking and triple-thinking!  Wish I could just put it out of mind completely.
> If enough people see the pattern, that makes it less likely to play out, no?

I'd say the exact opposite. If more people see the pattern, it's *more* likely to play out. Isn't that one of the primary reasons TA actually works?
tagged you both as my favorite bulls or just fav (occasional) bulls :-P
Thank you!
Looks like the Sunday Funday is on track for Sunday Blood Day
That top was so easy this time. We held for so long around 9990...
Is it really that obvious if you think it's too obvious and if you think it's going up while the rational conclusion is that it's going down? I'm in the same situation 
Well just enter a small position to validate your strategy then and scale in if things go your way 
Lol bro, better think fast heeh. I am looking forward to getting into a position 100% with tight stops in the next hour or so. 

Looking forward to the big shorts closing for real action, not expecting many new to be opening here as you said due to aforementioned reasons. 

Will be reading the sub more closely this morning, though won't be writing. Cheers bro.

And btw a fun fact: April's big green candle took place on a Thursday. lol.

A store of wealth above all, needs to be reliable. Now surely, the volatility of BTC doesn't make it into a reliable store of wealth? So where is the use-case? There's a reason for /r/goldtrader not existing ;)
I disagree that it has to be backed up by utility as a transactional system. Store of value/digital use case will prove itself over time in my opinion, it's still very early.

It was a tiny part of my portfolio. Only stock I held through the crash, in fact, trollboy. I will not be hiring you after your current boss bankrupts himself giving his money and power to me and my brethren. So good luck. You obviously need it.
friendly reminder to ASS. ALWAYS. SET. STOPS.
Remember the first drop the $5800 where we had like 5 Bloody Sunday’s in a row? 

Sell on Saturday after Friday pump, buy back Monday afternoon. Instant profit 
Close some at 5.5 and reevaluate things once we are there
I'll be closing some at 5.5 and more later. unless it just looks spectacularly disastrous 
HODL HODL HODL
Explains why some people want it to go to 1k ;)
It’s been really frustrating. All of the signs and even all of the traders keep talking about a “violent move” coming any second, which has put me in a state of anxiety for almost two weeks now. Nothing ever happens anymore other than a $100 candle up or back down to the same damn area. 

So frustrating. 
Wouldn't simply predicting ~$200 bart in the opposite direction of wherever it barted last time work out most of the time in the past few months?
Yeah dude good post gotta stay vigilant. I always get overconfident after a few winning trades.
User name checks out
> but a drop below 6k is the breaking point for the entire market.

Zoom out on the weekly chart and try saying that with a straight face.  We have to drop 50% before things get moderately scary.
Looking at the Bitfinex orderbook, 600BTC results in 1&#37; price increase
So much for your line.

True - this post wont be much use in terms of measuring sentiment via votes - and perhaps not at all in this sub. 
Oh right.  Not paying too much attention to the 1D in the short term - market feels pretty indecisive. Also can you pls confirm the date dammit - my watch broke.
Yes, sorry if I wasn't clear about that in my original post. I may have been able to word it better.

Specifically I want to maintain some fiat holdings on Binance as well as in an offline wallet (TUSD is ERC20 so I feel like it's easier than dealing with the omni wallet). I just want to make sure it is legit.
420 bottom 
Bro, can you explain what his name means.. Nobody is telling me :(
and polo
There is also something called TUSD, which is listed on Binance, as a supposedly safer alternative to USDT.
He's been around sub $1K, cannot recall his average entry, but he is alright.

I begged him to take profits in Nov/Dec, he is a stubborn SOB, but his posts are always fun. Always welcome back u/YRuafraid !
Long term holder is definitely more than 1 year
Long-term, in my view, is 5 years minimum.  That's about the length of time where you should expect to capture the overall market movement without worrying a bit about the major bull and bear markets.
Our charts are different. This is where I have it (log):

https://www.tradingview.com/x/z5yhkT6B/

Zoomed in on June 10th:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/q4d2DhQu/

When the price went trough it, the bottom of the triangle was at 7K on my chart ($7020). That red dildo cut straight trough it.

It was reasonable then to expect it to act as strong support, but it didn't. 

It is reasonable now to pay attention to it on the way up (everybody does, it seems), but the fact that it failed to act as a support more recently than it did, puts in to question the strength of the resistance it might provide. Anyway, I'm looking at that level just the same. 



Well if it's so simple why don't you make the call.
Sideways action*
Certainty is not a bad thing when something is confirmed. People here are ignoring the breakdown of a 5 month formation. It's like they were hoping it wouldn't happen, and when it did they just forget about it and try to come up with new bullish scenarios. 
It's also a great way to make 500%+ when you are right and all in on leverage
Is it really? Why can't they just produce a fucking audit? How is asking for a legitimate audit a conspiracy? Why do they claim to be routinely audited on their site when they aren't?
That's exactly my point, too.
I am in fact short, just not on insane leverage like x100
I bet you 1 contract that if you opened long @ short 100x right here, the long would get liquidated first lol
Sure, you can cherry pick that way. In a bear market I'm going to stick with BTC or fiat every time. Current performance doesn't agree with past performance.
The big alts are still above November levels so they absolutely have much room to fall further. 
lots of alts can and will literally go to 0.1% ATH. 

People will say "this time it's different" but go look at the list of top alts in 2014. there is 2-3 of the top 50 still around  

there will be a culling ☠️ 

new alts will show up in their place in time 
>Ya know I kinda wondered if I would ever just cash out and leave and I thought of all the reasons I would.
>
>I never really thought simply being really bored would be one of them...but maybe that's exactly what the bottom will look/feel like? 🤔

This is what stability, the end of price discovery, could look like. Recently, my blue chip and meme stocks have been seeing far more volatility than Bitcoin. 
You can do what i do... when you feel that way just cash out a tiny bit for some coke and hookers.
This is some inception shit right here.
I don't know what to think!

'They' say that TA works because everyone is using it.

Then 'they' say that the market is smarter than we are.

Perhaps nobody knows nothing!
haha thanks bud gl to you
It was so nerve wracking but it gave everyone so much time to sell/short 😂
Lol exactly. It's extremely difficult to actually *do* because shorting when it looks like there's no sellers is really nervewracking. But lately that's been the *best* time to do it.

Anyway, I haven't closed anything, would really probably only close some at $7k+. It would just suck, since I would've had several chances to close in the $6ks. 

I'm sure most people are aware I rather not touch my position and just wait things out as I believe in the *long* term my targets will be hit- it's just uncomfortable waiting sometimes because obviously I'm never 100% sure.
I'm still holding my full position open- don't really like to mess with it. last add was at ~$7600.

I considered adding at ~$6760 but really that's just being pretty greedy. Which...idk maybe I should have. would rather just wait it out 
If you lived in a country that was experiencing hyperinflation, and you had the opportunity to convert part of your wheelbarrow full of rapidly depreciating fiat into BTC right now, would you?

😂 love your posts man. All in good fun, thanks for the laughs
brb, setting stop on short.
When we first got to 7K range i opened a short around 7650 and was in the act of setting stops for above $7850. Fell asleep in the act of setting stops and Kraken had a wick to like $7925.

Woke up and price was at $7200 and made some insane gains.

Never set a stop and got lucky lol
I don't remember the specifics.

I only remember being nauseated and tethering up at 8k, which is the moment that brought me back to trading after a year off.
just trying to breakeven 😓
:( i think most of us figured it'd chop here for a week or two again. This is probably what the market will be like for a while; 15-20% moves then a 10% range for days/weeks

But honestly now is probably the time you should be lookin out for a move :P we've got 2-3 days before we've gone sideways as long as we did in $7-8k
What I see on the weekly chart is an important level that if broken means much more downside. 
Still dont get it :-D did not have my morning coffee yet. You mean that a 600 btc buy would be enough to trigger a cascade up to 7.3k? 
Good one. I'm glad you got to watch the market bounce off it, then plummet straight through it with me.
That's not a reasonable interpretation. It's not up for debate. Please don't call people names.
I guess I would not be qualified to chime in then. But I am pretty risk adverse and don't keep any significant money on overseas exchanges, crypto or otherwise. But that is just me.
No wayyy. I think 3k has a good chance but 420??!
thanks i think thats a good thing.  I thought it was just Bitfinex, so if there is several exchanges that adds to its legitimacy IMO
I’ll sell at $100K, you should too
If you bought in 2013 and didn't sell along the way, you're certainly doing alright. 
Yeah, I was shocked we went through it with a single monster 1hr candle.  I’ve been considering a long for the last week thinking we may jump back into it just to fuck with people’s heads.  ETH has been skimming the bottom of it for 3 1D candles now.  I feel like a run straight to the top of it would be dumbest thing possible so...why not?  
Your chart looks correct. Mine was drawn on a few days ago, I probably just quickly did it.

Point still stands -it "was" strong support. It has 4 touches spanning half a year. we had bounced off of it at 7050 for a few weeks but that only turned into a bigger bear flag looking thing. We approached the trendline with high velocity that it wasn't just going to hold
What a brilliant reply
So what, TA is now a guarantee of things, and any time some meme line is crossed everyone should 100x yolo it? Yeah, that's some great advice from someone who is clearly a very experienced trader!
TA isn't a crystal ball, and there are larger formations that still need to be tested.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/dp3STHB5/
Sorry if it's a stupid question, but which formation sre you referring to? 
>when you are right

I think that has more to do with it than the certainty :P 

Idk how long you've been trading but I can't imagine a mindset like that will last long. I know 0 traders who've been trading for more than a few months who are ever 100% sure about anything

it is a really great way to get liquidated 
I have a feeling they will, but you should get out of crypto by how deep you feel about this. Clearly you know that they are lying and this is going to come crashing down so you should cash everything out now while you can.

If you don't trust it, don't invest, and if you do, stop complaining because no one is forcing you to buy btc
TUSD is not Tether (USDT), maybe that caused the confusion.
It wouldn't be much of a bet since we both agree on the long getting liquidated first lol
ETH has outperformed BTC handily since the beginning of the "bear market", and I expect it to continue to do so.  


But then there's alts, and there's alts.
The big alts are here to stay. Imo bitcoin will eventually end up with 25% of the total market cap. 
At which point BTC resumes market dominance. 
Nah you do that on the way up. On the way down you swap roles... You become the hooker
I might. Or I'd buy dollars. Or if I would be a bit stupid USDT. Lots of alternatives.

True it has been stuck here for the appropriate amount of time to indicate that a huge move is due in addition to other indicators. That said, I don’t see it happening until the weekend. 

MM always uses the weekend to make their big moves. Too many people are at their desks ready to trade during the week. Drives me nuts actually because I want to enjoy my weekends, but I have to be somewhat glued to bitcoin. 
It is not exact science... but I use [http://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/books/USD](http://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/books/USD) to check the orderbook and potential impact of large orders. I know there might be hidden sell-orders and walls can be taken away.
Lol. It didn't "bounce" off it. It barely paused there for a second and crashed right through it. Obviously it wasn't an ascending triangle like you drew it. 

The only reason I bring it up is because your arrogance is toxic. You bashed someone for their line, and then immediately came up with a worse one
Hey mate since you mentioned Bittrex, I have a question. Have they recently enabled USD trading, deposits and wire transfer? 

I am asking this because I have received an email this week saying that my account is amongst the first few to get access to this their new USD feature. They have like three options to begin with, 1. USD trading only; 2. USD trading + Deposits and Withdrawals; and; 3.above two + another bank. It is followed by a kind of survey where they are asking questions regarding commitment to use USD, expected USD activity, and, the frequency of using USD. 

Your thoughts on the above, if you know anything about it? Cheers.
you didn't get the joke
69 bottom
You got it man! Post more often. 
Yup, let's just redraw the triangle when the old one breaks. Lmfao. Are you going to draw a downward slanting triangle when 6k breaks?
The symmetrical triangle. Our tightening range from the beginning of February basically. we broke down and made a lower low in terms of relative downwards movement
The large symetrical triangle on the daily chart. Top line from 11.7 to 9.9 bottom line 6k to 6.4
Way to put words in my mouth. I don't "feel deeply" about this. I wasn't even interested in having a discussion about tether but every single damn response I got was about how I was spreading tether FUD, or that USD should be audited before tether gets audited. And I'm sure I've been in crypto longer than you and have absolutely no intention of leaving now.

I'm just irritated that nobody can answer a single question I ask.
Right, now it makes even more sense.
Dude I'm not saying they aren't here to stay. I'm saying that there is much more room to fall. Stellar Lumen and Cardano were 3 cent in November. Litecoin was 50. Monero around 80. 
Here I thought I found a den full of true degenerates like me :-p
Well the fact that you might shows me that you get it. There are alternatives, but BTC affords so many other benefits (like being able to take it with you wherever you go without physically concealing dollars.) As you know many countries with hyperinflation have mechanisms in place to strongly discourage or prevent people from buying dollars and especially taking them out of the country. If you go black market, you pay a very hefty premium and incur extra risk of course.
[removed]
Yes, a 600 btc buy would push us up by 1%, i see that. That's 6820~ then. But you said 7300 in your comment before, which i am still confused about 😅. 
The only thing toxic here is your ego. I made OP better. I explained why his line was disregarded by the market and why this line would prove more significant. Also, it has always been a symmetrical triangle (on my chart). Obviously, it played out as a bear flag. Regardless, the real importance here is the trendline.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/Er2WMkqV/ (bounce, and fall through)
No problem. I did not receive that email, but quickly logging in I can see that I have the pairing trading available, but I cannot deposit USD and I cannot withdraw (stating that I have no linked account). 

So what it would appear to me is that I am not enabled to link a bank account for fiat on-ramp, but could trade between BTC/USD if I deposited crypto on there, based on looking for 10 min. You may be one of the first few! I tend to trust them, based on location in the states, personally. 
Is Palmerston some kind of troll figure? :(

I don't get it
If there's a DCB nearby, yeah.
Okay great, then  accept that tether could be the black Swan event that crashes the crypto market and you lose your money and stop complaining 

Edit: no one has an answer for you, like you said, until they audit them we won't know for sure. So at this point we are all just taking a gamble whether it's legitimate or not
Fair enough. 
That’s a lot to be drained, little too much with the support going on now 
>Not turning tricks for DCA cash

Amateur.
OK you might be right and I didn't think about it among those lines. The question remains if what you're sketching will generate enough volume and stability. Most people who would benefit from this probably need more liquidity and do not have much to invest nor access to internet/devices to buy it.
[removed]
Haha, I think I need that coffee!! Thanks
MY EGO?? lol. You're the one who was toxic towards someone else with your terrible line with only 2 contact points. And Bro. That's not a bounce. That's a pause. 

Here's a tip, I will " make you better" - you can't trust lines that only have 2 contact points. You generally need a minimum of 3. 
Thanks bro, I wanted to make sure everything is fine.
It's PalmerSTONED, Palmerston was already taken lol
This is peak delusion
I don't care if tether crashes the market. I have had a percentage of my holdings in fiat for a few months now, and I want to maintain what I have, but am interested in tether alternatives to hedge the possibility that tether is not legit. All I'm asking about is if someone has used TUSD. I don't really care about other people's opinions on tether.
All good, I'm guessing you are from a first world country where you don't really have to worry about your currency being stable so that's not surprising. I am too and it took a while for it to click. 80% of the world is either unbanked or underbanked and you can literally buy bitcoin with a Nokia brick cellphone. You can also buy bitcoin without access to the internet. (Someone sells me their private keys which are on a piece of paper and I give them fiat, this requires trust and there are other issues with fraud like anything else, but it's easier than most people realize to purchase bitcoin)
Ahh, cheers mate! 
2 points makes a line. 3 points makes a trend. Notice how my line was regarded as important by the market. Everyone had their stop losses just beneath it. That's how intuition and experience works in trading. You can continue to attack me, or you can learn from what I did there.
>delusion

I don't like it when people throw that word around, but here it actually makes sense. Being certain about anything with respect to bitcoin prices exemplifies delusion. Not sure if this post is meant to be ironic/nonsensical, but if so, good job
It's at least a possibility... You're saying that there's no possibility of a DCB after 6k breaks, and I'm saying that's not certain. It's not even certain that we test 6k again. What if hoizontal support lines are more substantial than you're estimating? That you're not considering other possibilities is the thing that makes me question the position more than anything. I'm not being critical of the thing you think I'm being critical of.

Check yourself before you ...
Oh well you should change your approach how you ask it (I saw your other post which sounds a lot less fuddy) 
Thank you wit shifting my view. Indeed I'm from a first world country (Netherlands). I agree it would be a good thing to decentralize-bank the 80% of the world. I'm just not sure if BTC is the most suitable agent for that. We are in a very early stage. I'm not saying BTC is NOT right. But to un-bank the unbankable, something else is needed. I'm very interested in the concept of e.g. trustles micro-credits. I don't see anything suitable to do that yet. So I agree with you on many points, just not sure if BTC would be the thing to settle this problem.
I do think there can be a DCB after 6k breaks, in fact I think it might not even be a DCB, I think the absolute bottom of the bear market will be between 5400-5500. But what is the purpose of redrawing the triangle lower every time? It's already broken, you trade it, and move on
Absolutely, my pleasure. At times, I do fear that the idea is a bit Utopian. The concept of empowering the global population to secure and transmit their own store of value independently of the geopolitical context in which they find themselves is pretty damn revolutionary. As you said, I think we are much earlier than most people realize. This is potentially the next step from barter, to sea shells, to precious metals, to paper, to plastic... It will take time. And in this time, I hope that the issues you cite are solved by second layer solutions that are built on top of the blockchain by much smarter people than myself. Then again, this all could end up as just a footnote in a economics textbook about bubble dynamics or human greed and trading psychology. Either way, it's going to be very interesting.

Sure, trade it and move on. That's what shorts did when they closed their position on the last bounce. They saw horizontal support and took the sure money.

My comments are only pointed at the certainty that you're communicating. There are no guarantees for any position.
Tech helps. When African farmers got phones, they became more aware of market prices. They earn more now without  NGO's. Let's hope that nlockchain tech will help too!
In case you haven't seen my chart that I've been spamming for 3 weeks: [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/tlo0V1AE-BTC-Capitulation-still-ahead-potential-reversal-soon/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/tlo0V1AE-BTC-Capitulation-still-ahead-potential-reversal-soon/)

I've traded this exactly including closing half my short at 6200 and re-shorting 6800.
Nice calls!
