Will the pain ever stop?

I’m honestly just annoyed at this point 

Edit: My Longs got stopped out in my sleep. Check below 
Looks like emotions are high today. That seems strange to me. A change in price of 7% isn't that drastic. Bitcoin does this pretty regularly.

The falling wedge is still valid.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/XZE1sP3A/

Elliot waves show this is a good place to retrace back and set up more reasonable short-term medium-term expectations.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/r3Gjabja/

Elliot waves could show a strong case for bears too.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/WPjYI2qL/

The pattern bears have set up isn't strong, though. It looks more like a [descending broadening wedge](http://thepatternsite.com/dbw.html) (inside a much larger falling wedge).

https://www.tradingview.com/x/SKSm1EWJ/ 

Bears can make the case a little better when you zoom in to the 4 hour chart. It's possible there's a much larger correction that's needed. Maybe we need to confirm the double bottom we made on the 12 hour chart?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/CKEd3nXO/

If we don't at least do that then we're destined for an iH&S on the 12H

https://www.tradingview.com/x/V75ZT2DN/

Pair that with the divergence we're seeing from the OBV and you're back to a strong bull case again.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/Axf1v5iX/

Risk reward on a long entry here isn't great. I keep mistaking accumulation for distribution. The fan boy in me has a hard time understanding why the world wont push forward with Bitcoin adoption faster, but the trader in me needs to remain skeptical. 

Is the bottom in? Are we in an unstoppable bear market? I can't answer that, but I don't think we're in a terribly different place than we were yesterday.
Look at the daily,  it is high volatility churn, red day greens day chop. These rallies and drops ranges are about the daily volatility ranges.Until we break out these ranges at 6800 for an inverse head and shoulder or below 6400, not much has changed from a TA perspective. Scalping works, the wind changes fast day to day.

Edit: straight down, looks like we are going into bear terriatory below 6400.
Please update us on what is happening with your position. /u/kaktusface and it is real unfortunate that it pulled back this far, a breakout like the ones we have seen two days ago would usually take off.
Bitcoin Future Market Dominance is rocketing while spot volume is plummeting

Well, I just capitulated after three weeks long. $7500 by tomorrow. You're welcome :/

Edit: immediately goes up two seconds after I sell.
Well if previous drops patterns play out, I am looking for another leg down to 6300 with a bounce and oversold 4hr RSI, then one more down to ~6000 with RSI divergence on the 4hr and a period of consolidation...

good luck out there

edit : should have added that I would look for a good bounce at 6300 before going lower
So that Stochastic signal on 1D appears to maintain its reliability: https://www.tradingview.com/x/cOo5mf7E/   
   
Judging by past behaviour it has some more way to go down. The RSI crossing 50 and going back under also doesn't look good for the bulls and we're back under 21 EMA resistance.
Hmmm strange to see the panicked comments in here... Maybe this really is the phase before capitulation.

If you can't be patient then just save yourself the stress and sell. 
It's wondrous how the longs continue to open up in this uncertain price area (i.e. between 5750 and 6850), as though it's guaranteed free money by going long here. While my price target for a short from 6700 is approx 6300, i will be closing only half of that position at 6300, while setting a trailing stop loss on the remaining half. Not happy about closing entirely a good short position until a moderate portion of these leveraged longs are disintegrated. 

For the short-term outlook, if price revisits the 5750 area and breaks through it, we will have completed a double-top formation on the 4-6hr charts. My price target for a short of that break-down is approx 1k, or at 4755. 

In addition, I am really not comfortable building a sizeable long-term position in bitcoin until the price is nearer to this particular trend line that I am looking at on the Weekly chart for BTCUSD: https://i.imgur.com/hP7y5Qi.png

Happy trading everyone. 
I got stopped out of most of my long for much smaller gains than I had hoped for. No idea what to do now. Seems pretty fucking bearish. I'm out for a while.
Not really convinced by the bounce. 1m candle(yes) not really showing more buy volume than sell volume:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/6cGbs0rO/

but still planning to close short if BTC goes above the red line ~6480ish:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/3JmH82pr/


There are just too many differences between the landscape now, and the landscape of 2014. I don't subscribe to the idea that "it will be the same" or "it will be the same but accelerated" because all of the variables you input to come up with the speculative price are different, and now we are starting to bridge through a market shake up to make our way to a mature market space. Now are are on the edge of BTC and a handful of projects being able to provide real world value, and larger infrastructure is being established to facilitate integration of crypto into the real world. 

Things aren't just an idea now, now they are plans, and some of those plans are getting implemented. It will be interesting to see what happens, but with the tokenization of securities right around the corner (blockchain's killer app) we are closer to primetime than we ever have been before. 

Let's hope for a higher low and a gradual rebuilding of our base in this range. Traders, trade on! 
so, let's see if this small sell off gets bought or not. Since saturday, I was waiting for a test of the levels before the big move up. 6550 area is what to watch imo, if this stays quite stable there is no need to worry.


This is what happens, when all the market participants who are left are trigger happy traders and miners.

It will take some time and visible progress in the utility of Bitcoin to build real confidence in the market again.
Typical quick movement followed by boring sideways till the next quick movement. 

Judging by more long than short I would think down but still $600 from new lows.
That's a good place to take any position. Basically stops on a break 6.4 or 6350.

I'd say up, ascending triangle with 6.4 as resistance. But... I'm not gonna trade this. Mainly because I think it will break down and not gonna open just before going to bed.
I've been toying around with the OBV (On Balance Volume) indicator recently. And I just noticed something very interesting that made me doubt [my bearish bias and the hedge I'm considering to enter soon](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8xlbz1/daily_discussion_tuesday_july_10_2018/e24ex2a/).

Some futures markets are showing strong bullish and/or hidden bullish OBV divergences on the 12H chart: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/0P4wmkfa/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/0P4wmkfa/)

That's OKEX quarterly, but XBTU18 is showing hidden bull divs as well.

First of all, is it even valid to chart on a futures market which includes the premium swings? Or perhaps it's even more valid since the chart "includes" some sentiment??

Any thoughts on this?
Have been on the golf course all day playing in a tournament. 

Had a long order filled @ $6342.

!long XBTUSD 6342 5x 70%

Tight stops under $6300.

Pretty good R/R since $6300 has shown strong support since our mini relief rally. I’ll be looking to close 50% around 6500 and once that breaks I’ll set stops around $6450 for the rest. 

Opening a short here isn’t the best idea. Wait for a pump or short the breakdown.

Personally, I think we will break up soon. 
Regarding the stacked books on Finex, here's a nice visualization with historical data. There's certainly a [big spike for the 5% range](http://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/bidask_sum/7d/USD/bitfinex?bp=5&bu=c&r=hour&t=m) and a little less pronounced one for the [10% range](http://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/bidask_sum/7d/USD/bitfinex?bp=10&bu=c&r=hour&t=m) today. They are not unprecedented though, more of a weekly occurrence. On the [1m timeframe](http://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/bidask_sum/24h/USD/bitfinex?bp=10&bu=c&r=minute&t=m) you can see what I assume is a market maker whose orders periodically disappear for a short time. This is also visible on the [live order book](http://bitcoinity.org/markets/bitfinex/USD) if you happen to observe it at the right moment.

Just went long from 6369 ...Stop at 6100

Each time we've hit a local low, we've gone back up to hit a descending triangle (11.7k and 10k respectively). That would put the new target at 7850-8000. 
inverse H&S..... 100K confirmed

----

edit- so it's not a shitpost


iH&S or whatever doesn't matter, to me, the short term right now is too random to bother trading with. In the medium term I keep it simple, if it tests 5.8-6K support again no way in hell it's holding for the fourth time. That's a sign of weakness and uncertainty. If it does hold that's some fucked up shit, but this is bitcoin. Considering we're in a downtrend, the forces are leaning heavily that way, and we're too close to that critical support for me to be confident. Of course something random like bitcoin ETF can change all of this in a heartbeat. To be frank the ETF approval could be the single most bullish thing to happen to bitcoin price mainly because of the fomo it will create, and the sheer size of the crypto crowd that are ready to pull the trigger. But right now I'm not convinced the price won't go lower. For the long term though, I'm obviously bullish. Some people call me a permabull, but I'm only bull cuz there's good reason to be bullish. It's really up to you to explain why I shouldn't be bullish. Anyway, jk its still a shitpost
!long XBTUSD add 6636 5x 20% 

I was going to close my longs before after rejection of $6800 at $6745 but I was in the processes of peeling shrimp and couldn’t get my hands clean in time to close ( lol ).

On that note, I’ll just lower my CA a tad and bail on my longs just under $6600 

We are all probably watching this line ( Blue )

https://www.tradingview.com/x/uqpJnoI6/

I have profits set up for 50% of my trade stacked 25% @ $6785 and $6815 and will let rest ride from there. 

Good luck bro’s. Hitting the hay 




As part of my portfolio, I always try to keep 20-30&#37; fiat on the side lines should a nice opportunity present itself. Normally, a "small" 7&#37; move like this wouldn't trigger me, but the risk/reward for accumulating some spot here feels good. So I'm buying for 1/3 of my fiat stash at 6370 and transferring to cold storage.

Good luck to you all out there!
I've made posts before when I was in a daze after huge losses and gotten lots of encouragement and good advice from everyone here. I absolutely and completely disregarded and ignored every comment and continued on my degenerate ways. I don't think you can change someone's nature.

I started trading in 2016 just before the start of the great bull run with 3 bitcoin worth less than $2,000. Right now I have 2.3 bitcoin left in my bitmex account returned to me after my liquidation. This is worth $14,650. Does this make me a winning trader? If I could turn 3 BTC into what I did...what's stopping me from turning the 2.3 BTC into hundreds? These are the thoughts running through my head right now. I know I am retarded. Nothing can be done about it. 

The funny thing about all of this, is I never once took profit, I didn't buy anything with BTC (aside from some christmas gifts for family and friends) and my lifestyle did not change for the better after I made my money. It was all just numbers in cyberspace, in my head. I am actually in a worse spot now than before, not because I lost so much, but because trading and bitcoin took over my life for the past two years and my actual real life life is in shambles. 

My outlook on price is once again bearish as hell, I believe that the 6800 breakout was our only hope for the bear market to be over, now everything looks like shit again and we are probably actually going to go back to like 2.5-4k over the next several months to year. 


Do not reply with sympathy and advice - this is a trading sub not therapy session or life support group. Plus, I will ignore advice and do what I wanna do like a fool. Keep it to trading. Yes - I will run this 2.3 btc back to the fucking moon and no one can stop me.
Welp.  Thought I had stop losses set before I went to bed, but I didn't.  Pretty much erased the small amount of profits I had gained over the past week.  

I guess I just have to wait and see if the 50% retrace of this most recent runup holds and starts to form a larger channel.  Will put a stop sell just below 6300 (and verify this time).

https://imgur.com/a/G3lB3RM
Long $6359 3x 5000 contracts.

I will add to this position as we drop, bailing fully once below $6k.

RSI is very low on the hourly, we've already dropped over 5&#37; in the space of several hours, and two down wicks pushed back up at $6300 in the past couple of hours.

I decided not to short last night and wait to see the next move. This is either going to be the higher low from 5800 to progress upwards, or the fallout to goblin town...
Trying to strip back all the fancy TA and keep it simple on a longer timeframe, looking at the Coinbase price chart over the past month. Noticing a price difference of just under $400 from the start of the past month. That’s about a 6% price difference over the month at the current price.

https://i.imgur.com/LsgCQBJ.png

Interested to see the last time the price varied only 6% over a period of a month. My strategy was to start buying back with fiat when we hit a variance of only several hundred dollars over a 2-3 month period. I wonder whether we are starting to create that period now.
I think this is the thickest I've ever seen the order book on bitfinex 
I see a lot of people asking me to step up rule enforcement. So, I'm going to try that out today. Open to any feedback or discussion about bans and such, but I'm working against a big backlog today. Could take a while. Please use mod mail and report instead of cluttering the daily.
Fucking wow.

My stops on Kraken were at @ 6276.7...... 

**Guess what the low for the day is?**

#$6276.7 

!long XBTUSD close 6276.7

How is that even possible? Talk about fucking terrible luck.

Well I’m headed on a week long vacation tomorrow so I’ll most likely step away from trading for a week. 

I feel like the market violated me in all the wrong ways. Stay safe gentleman 
People asked but there's not much to update. My entire plan for the long was that this support level of 6550-6600 (4h ma's) would hold on a retest. I didn't even really think we would get back this low. My entry is 6775 my liquidation is between 6400-6500 if this level fails it's over. Not much I can do at this point. I can panic close now for a 50-60% loss on my account but we are at the exact support I thought would hold...I don't think that would be a good decision.
[We've finally got our bullish cross](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/8x8U06YW/#) but market dumped. 
Bears seems to be back in control again. [As I commented on yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8x7y3o/daily_discussion_monday_july_09_2018/), going below 6400 is bad news indeed. My line in the sand sits at 6H Kijun support which has been respected a couple of times: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/CJuAS0aV/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/CJuAS0aV/)

Should we close at least a 1H candle below 6300 I will probably look to hedge on some sort of bounce.

But if by some miracle, 6300 would hold as support, there's also the chance for the inverted head and shoulders forming on higher time frames.
Bought in back at around 6360 as i was planning yesterday, RSI is oversold on pretty much all of the timeframes, 0.5 fib level was reached;

i still believe that we are in the uptrend now but i don't exclude the possibility of another leg down that will bring btc to 6k; it probably would have been smarter to wait until a clear direction appears, so that's somewhat of a pretty risky trade 
While I sit out of position, think I'll play some [buzzword bingo](https://imgur.com/iRTjYmD) with this thread.

Edit: that FOMO square is gonna be hard to check off ;)

Inspired from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8xlbz1/daily_discussion_tuesday_july_10_2018/e24e7yr/) clever chain.
I have a 50x short I opened yesterday at 6723 with a liquidation price of 6829.  according to the [chart](https://www.bitmex.com/chartEmbed?symbol=XBTUSD) on bitmex it jumped up to 6840 before it dropped so I should have been liquidated but it didn't happen.  I think the reason is because when I look up XBT on trading view the prices are slightly different and it only wicked at 6789.  So now I'm wondering why bitmex would use a chart thats not showing the correct price.   
Long 3BTC @ 6460, S/L @ 6300. RSI cooled off on all lower TFs (somewhat). RSI Hitting 45 on 1D which has been a good indicator for resistance on earlier pumps, now we've gone above it and its acting as support in some sense. A much needed retrace after after 11 days of running up and down, slightly upwards. I dont think we're heading back to sub 6k yet but anything could happen. RSI 41 on 1W chart, again a point at which fun things have happened in past, during the good ol' bear market as well. 6430ish shows great support so far. Volume rising, not at all a positive sign with the drop going on, though. Might exit trade sooner if things start looking uglier than they already do. No sweat no tears, by making a plan and sticking to it, you eliminate your fears, yo. Also, Im not a big believer in H&S formations, but we're looking at a potential iH&S on 1D chart right about now, if we turn upwards within some days. That would certainly be fun if it worked out. Or no, thats a double headed iH&S. I dont believe in mutants, Ive only seen them in movies. Perhaps that deformed little cunt wont work out afterall. Remains to be seen, I do remember something from all the deformed/mutant movies, those guys have super strength. Maybe this retarded iH&S, if formed (deformed) could have some super retard strengths too?  


Im out, literally, its great weather in here. Ill definitely be checking the price though, you know I will. Cant enjoy a day without a little bit of pressure, I still to this day live for this shit, until I dont.
Time to bring out those hidden bull divs boys 
God I feel like such an idiot looking at the past year.

Why didn't I sell when my limits at 20-25k didn't trigger? Why didn't I trust my quick and dirty math that the crash would be 65% just because the altcoin bubble didn't pop like I thought would be the cause? Why did I ever emotionally trade?

My current theory was that the bubble started on the mar 24 to july 7 run last year; returning to that mean will be heart breaking.
I always chuckle when the price drops 5-8% and THEN shorts start piling up :-p It's almost reliable to see when the local bottom is when number of shorts is reaching a local high.
This is starting to remind me too much like 9.4k and all the other «ascending triangles» on the way down. Dont like how long this is taking to break out. Put a stop at 6600ish on my long, flips it into a short. 
In the interest if keeping my bearish perspective in check, there are a couple key levels for me as a buyer. Currently, we are in the $6100-$6300 support range for a potential IH&S. If that holds, we might not have to worry about the more bearish perspective below.

If that breaks, we may continue to fall hard, as I wouldn’t see much upside in the short/medium term. However, we have key support level around $5300, with ascending support leading back to 2015 crossing descending resistance-turned-support from ATH around September between $3800-$4200. If $6100 breaks, I will likely re-short expecting a slow bleed to around $5300, where there is likely to be a big bounce if it reaches that point. If $5300 eventually breaks, I will likely DCA into long-term futures at sub-$5300 prices, as I don’t see much r/r for a short at that point. If $3800 breaks, I would honestly probably capitulate because that would be super bearish, as we’re probably headed to retest previous ATH around $1200.

Sorry for the poor image quality, but I’m on mobile: https://imgur.com/a/qvHYcoi

(Scaled out version: https://imgur.com/a/fp8nYQm)
This really could be an inverse head and shoulders.  The Manipulators could paint a big spike sometime soon and would be close to textbook...not perfectly symmetrical but close enough.


I would still look for a lower low on the 4hr with bullish divergence before looking for a substantial bounce...this has been a pretty good signal of late

edit : Looked at more charts and the last dip may be "close enough is good enough" to 6300...so in my scenario we would get a bear flag here for a day or two then more down with 4hr divergence at a lower low

good luck

peace 
Gonna try to scale into a small counter trend long here in the 6250-6350 range. Target 6500-6600, stops under 6200. If I don't filled get I don't really mind. The idea is to long a possible stop run before the bounce. Current structure looks kinda bear flaggy.

5800-5950 is the next range down that I would be interested in longing.

ETA: it dumped 1 min after i posted this, 4/5 bids filled average entry 6313. I'd like to see daily close over 6300 and a bounce could come soon after.
Great stuff, stopped out at 6290 from my 6330 long lol. Luckily I use very low leverage on these kinds of trades. But for real, I should have thrown my stop under 6250 though, since we wicked off 6260 a few times last week without breaking under it. Fuc me
https://imgur.com/a/v1FRU9T

This is a Bart in a pump-driven uptrend. We found a very similar channel right below the previous one, right now we're battling for the 20-day ma. Ascending triangle painted on the 15 min looks like it wants to break up, perfect setup for a mean bear flag if this fails to get above 6420's convincingly. 


Lol, if BTC end up forming the IHS, I must say this is the most beautiful and balance one. 

- Left shoulder closed at 6295.1, Right shoulder closed at 6301.8

- Neckline formed at 6760.4 on the left and 6761.8 on the right.

- Textbook volume, highest volume when forming the Left shoulder, lesser volume when forming the head, and the least volume when forming the Right shoulder.

The question is, can it go up from here and break the neckline?

I want to talk about the ih&s with neckline at $6800! 

here's a list of btc h&s and ih&s failures to show how poorly they perform, to the point where that you can countertrade them successfully (and I will probably do so if we reach $6800 again):

Biggest h&s thus far- buying support was incredibly profitable despite an extremely convincing volume profile as well (massive volume on left shoulder). however, I will note that if the noise between the $20k top and the $17.2k top was removed, this would actually have been a textbook h&s because the breakdown had a target of $6k ($7k from $13k to $20k, broke down at $13k)

https://www.tradingview.com/x/PnGpctwa/

massive ih&s with target of ~$18000

https://www.tradingview.com/x/sGaa7AAz/

h&s with target of $5500:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/4RfVSs95/

for me, I am genuinely going to consider counter trading https://www.tradingview.com/x/ScdocuJq/ if it approaches the neckline again because of btc's history with h&s formations
Sticking to my plan, no long term buy till the 3D RSI becomes oversold....
I want to see this weekly level hold. if not this might get ugly again. HTF directional bias is still bearish, buyers must prove eagerness by holding this higher low on the daily. https://www.tradingview.com/x/zZ5deRRQ/

I was getting bullish again but the sell volume on this dump is noticeable.

If this level doesn’t hold ill be leaning more bearish (closing longs and adding a little bit to the short)

If it does hold, next important level will be the hourly breaker imo, my actions will depend on volume. https://www.tradingview.com/x/r6i7neE9/
Right now im shorting it. Gamble. 6200 and im outx im gonna wait for the next great signal 
[removed]
Need to hold above the green lines for this not to look like bearish continuation. Breakout above 6800 probably takes us to ~7800, breakout below 5800 probably takes us to ~4800: https://imgur.com/a/mhVHvQY

ETA: Adjusted one of the lines. Daily close over 6350 could be a good entry for a long scalp. Resistance is somewhere in the 6500-6600 area.
pretty gloomy in here today. Here are some lines I made while drinking two monster absolutely zero and listening to bonecrushingly hard dubstep.

[One hour chart](https://imgur.com/a/ZRaLamR)

Broken downwards out of the small ascending channel. Putting in some whatever buys at 6000ish for potential support. They are whatever buys because i'll just hold and they are small like 1-2% stack increasing.

[4 hour chart](https://imgur.com/a/hbDOVYs)

I still think that first breakout of 5k has not been tested yet and am placing most of my buys laddered to average out at 5000ish. These are more than whatever buys and i'm hoping for a big bounce there back to around 7500 to stay in the triangle, before dipping again

[One day chart](https://imgur.com/a/KF293S4)

Ignore any red lines. This green line is whats important for now. This is the original bullish line from the low of last bear market to breaking the high of the previous bull market back in 2013. That mania phase after breaking all time high has never been tested since breaking previous ATH at 1180.

This triangle converges at 5k on November 24th. I do have some laddered buys between 3500 and 4250 to test long term bullish support. These will be updated every two weeks to follow that line. In the case this green line breaks down it'll be some heavy shit.

In the case I get any of those fills i'll wait and see to sell. I'll be looking forward to end of the year around november-december for this triangle to close.

Good luck everyone. I mostly trade an active hodling strategy, and am currently holding about 30% of the coin I would like to have for the long game.
Another fallen soldier, taken from us by these senseless dips. A moments silence for these brave pioneers of high leverage crypto trading.
Most of this sub was short term bullish at 6800. Most of it is now bearish at 6350. 

In both cases, I'm doing the opposite. 
I find it somewhat limiting that more or less the only analysis provided in this sub is TA. Any large, successful trading house or analytical firm employs a variety of tools, such as news and sentiment analysis as well (and more esoteric ones such as astronomy and astrology, etc.). TA is not necessarily even among the most important tools used.

Besides, anyone that are even remotely honest will admit that you can produce any kind of result you want with TA and that the predictions made in this sub is largely wrong (not because people here are not skilled, but because of the inherent limitations of technical analysis).
I see 65xx, I add some money to my position.

!long XBTUSD add 6599 5x
[removed]
I'll try to see the bull case here. While the 3d looks ugly right now, bulls still have 28 hours to push price back above 6,550 and turn the candle into a wick-to-support. It wouldn't look too bad then and conform to the inverted HnS that quite a few people expect, especially after MACD flipped. Breaking below 6,300 doesn't strictly invalidate that yet, but I'm afraid bearish momentum could take over if we broke the last weekly low at 6,275. Until that happens a continued counter-trend rally against the overextended move from 10k is still plausible. The EOD pump/dump in a few hours will be *critical*.

Edit: On the shorter timeframes, 4h to 1h are oversold and within the flag shorts are ramping up. Stops will be tight, wouldn't count on it breaking down.
Seems too good to be true, not sure what to believe

12 hr RSI bouncing off support: https://www.tradingview.com/x/riez0qJI/
Hey guys, long time. I took a break from trading because I lost my interest and faith in a bull rally the day we dropped below $6,000. I came last weekend, I didn't really wanted to spoil the party as I noticed high bullish sentiment in the sub in the past couple of days.

Anyhow, the dump isn't surprising to me, considering the following. 

Bitcoin fell from $9,980 to $8,000. 
From $8,000, it went up to $8,500 and fell again to $7,000. 
From $7,000, it went up to $7,700 and fell again to $6,100. 
From $6,100, it went up to $6,700 and fell again to $5,800. 

Now being the latest one in the series, we went up from $5,800 to $6,700. You be the judge and decide what will happen next..

My views are that the interest is lost and it won't be coming back until we make extreme lows, that too won't just come back in 2 weeks or so, it will take some time. Once the interest is back, only then can we expect another bull rally.. Best of luck to you all. 
Very ironic that the people buying every fraudulent pump and dump like the one over the last couple weeks are likely the ones who want the bear market to end the most.  Yet they are the ones sustaining and prolonging it by propping up a market which obviously wants to fall.
Once again kicking myself for not taking any profits before my position went underwater.

Oh well, I guess this is the downside to making long-term trades / plans.
We're currently at the 0.618 range on this rally, which coincides with some pretty good support.
We seem to have gone through 3h cloud support will add to the short if we get a rebound to now cloud resistance

Edit: 6h cloud support not broken yet

Why use Bitmex or Kraken or Bitfinex? 

Real question for those who have used all 3: which one has the least "stop hunting" behavior? 
Oversold on 1h,2h,4H but I don't expect a bounce but rather a cool down for few hours than a continuous dump, looking at 1D there is still so much room to go down...note, there is still 34K longs against just 22K shorts, we still didn't get to the painful area IMO.



But but muh wyckoff accumulation!
Volume is still low.. we Will go lower
LTC foundation just announced they bought 10% of a known German bank. Although it is not directly BTC, they are very connected. This is institutional money and a very nice news in this cloudy day
Somebody slap me silly...

We just touched on $6,800 a few hours ago which is amazing stuff and I'm sweating about being aroudn $6,650 for some reason lol...

God damnit Bitcoin, let me rest!
Where do I go to short this?
yesterday i long btc from 6711 set a profit stop at 6777 and went to sleep.. when i woke up it got filled~ 25x leverage 

this is my next move for today:
long btc from 6367 set stop profit at 6450 10x leverage
stop loss at 6250...

don't ask me why~ i don't read any ta

Serious question... where did the term "goblin town" originate?

Is that a crypto term or a wall street term?
Bitmex is a little more bullish than gdax or bitfinex. Seems odd
7/4 bull flag broke down. 7/8 bull flag broke down. Beware the bull flags in this neck of the woods. 
[removed]
As soon as we broke 6800 a second time and didn’t break that 6828 previous high I knew we were going down. I sold the stack I’ve been accumulating since we were at 5800 and sold at 6750. I think we will retest below 6000 again now. 
Yep, [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8x7y3o/daily_discussion_monday_july_09_2018/e22jnhw/) happened..

https://www.tradingview.com/x/5aokoFSE/
This rally started  with a Bollinger W reversal as seen on Bitstamp 1day charts.  Now we are seeing a Bollinger M top forming on the Bitstamp 12hr charts. The M top is weaker, being oriented towards the center of the top bands and showing less definition and  on a 12hr vs 1d timeframe. It will confirm as M top and likely to go down more at \~$6450, with target of \~$6100. ~~The second half of the M top is also yet another bull flag from our most recent pump.~~ We are in a Bullish catapult pnf formation a la [this very popular post a few days ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8wqhds/daily_discussion_saturday_july_07_2018/e1ydqe9) I am betting on more consolidation until testing the ATH resistance (and top 1day Bband), but sleeping with my price alarms ready to give me an opportunity to bail if the M top confirms.

edit: added strikethru, bullflag too ugly now
Yep, still in a bear trend, and it's still "short the pump". Good to be making money on the same fall twice, but we are already so low that it does not feel as safe to short as it did before at 7xxx and 8xxx.
Taken from today's report.   


 **BTC Macro:** On the 3 day we can clearly see that we're falling out of the small ascending channel we were trading in, I've also redrawn the overall triangle line to show a wedge which will likely get resolved in August.    
There is still a fair amount of resistance showing at the 5800 to 6400 range as we just reentered the top of said range.  If we were to fall downward out of this wedge/triangle then we'd be starting to watch the top of the channel we broke out of in April 2017 which is resting around the 4500 mark, however there is still a lot of resistance all the way down to (and including) the 5k line, to watch for.    


 **BTC Local:**  A peek in at the local this is what I'm going to be watching now to see if we form and confirm another ascending channel below the one we just fell out of.    
It's possible, however we could also just be headed down to retest the 5800 area again.    
*On speculation alone I wouldn't at all be surprised if this wasn't precipitating a coming upswing to break through the 6800 range, however I don't have anything confrontational to back that up.*

Order book thick af on Bitfinex

Bitmex open interest at 95k (according to dushman, it was 95k last night before the dump, too, /u/cryptosecrecy is your tool working? can we verify?)

95k open interest on bitmex *always* led to a large move recently.. Expecting a large move here soon 

For anyone unfamiliar with this, open interest indicates amount of btc floating around in open positions 
Whenever you see this: [https://imgur.com/a/jxDJ0y7](https://imgur.com/a/jxDJ0y7)

Short. Easiest way to make money in this bear market.

(works well on 1hr timeframe too).
BTC dominance 43.4 &#37;, highest value since early April. If we gain 2 more &#37; (45.5&#37;), we would have a confirmed double bottom on the dominance chart...
Failed to break and remain above the 6800 resistance, broke the 6600 support confidently with good volume and the fact that we did remain here for a long time and these BGDs were "probably" all "orchestrated" (just my conspiracy) means that we will dump really hard and probably we will barely correct between dumps just because the number of open longs compared to shorts is so high and this could mean that the squeeze will be also intensive.

One indicator I always follow ir Moving 55 Exponential Average on 4hr. [https://www.tradingview.com/x/yJCXSNEy/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/yJCXSNEy/)

We've stayed above it for almost 11 days now. If we breakdown it with volume it could mean quite a downfall.  Originally I thought this would mean going back to just bit under 6k.
Back below the 200 period simple moving average (4hr). On the daily we have never broken above the SMA 200 which is still around 9195 today. 200 period SMA is a good proxy for market regime, for example Larry Connors likes to refer to it.
Is counting the number of candlesticks and checking the time and RSI before previous dumps at the same price level and checking how similar they are to the current dump a valid strategy lol?

God i suck at TA but so far its working. Also is ETH bear flagging? Thats a bear flag right?
noob question here:

1. Whats the minimum time frame on which an RSI divergence becomes a valid signal? I've seen it used on 1D and 4H charts -- could it be used on a 1H chart?


Doesn’t look like there are many buyers out there.
the sell wall is up to 4,300 BTC

I think a whale is confirming the market sentiment right now. 
Big move coming up in an hour or so lads. People will be buying the dip or dumping once they are done watching this banger of a match. 

If we fall under that diagonal support around 6.3k things might get bloody but I’m expecting a bounce and the pride to test 6.6k in all scenarios except an ultra bearish one. We will see. 
more doom could come as volume keeps it's descent. people are somewhat losing interest to crypto. 
The $6150 support looks so weak. I would be shocked if we bounce off there. I’m scalping for a crappy bounce at $5800. After that we could retest $6800 high but one would assume we continue going down. Volume is crap all day and then there are random pumps with large volume that temporarily move us upwards, thus getting everyone hopeful for another bull run. Market makers are obviously taking us on a ride downwards and making sure they keep trader’s hopes up along the way. 
I'm continuing the story that this trade war is very important for bitcoin's price. The instant trump announced these new $200B tarrifs, bitcoin pumped.

It also adds to the narrative that people see bitcoin as a hedge versus traditional markets.

Edit:https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2018-07-10/analysis-of-latest-developments-in-u-s-china-trade-war
Im kinda happy, still on target.

Luckily i dont trade this stellar TA :D
Are we experiencing a IH&S on the 12hr with a left leg at 6800, bottom at 5750, and right leg at 6800 ?

If i am seeing correctly, the bottom right leg should be at \~6300.
Taxation. Probably the most boring topic, and to be fair I usually skip everything tax related myself as I *used* to live in a lax jurisdiction tax wise. I didn't move, but the crypto tax laws changed dramatically over the summer. 

So is the situation as bad as it is currently here anywhere else as bad?

* any trade of a cryptocurrency that is in the profit is a taxable event (at around 35%)
* losses are *NOT* deductable

I mean, don't these two things in combination make profitable trading impossible in practice?
Its looking like a repeat of the previous dumps prior the 6300 to 6400 range.
zig-zag indicator,
https://imgur.com/e5r7YwY
couldn't resist...10x short 6330 we'll see what happens
Only once in BTC have I seen an iHS confirm and that was at the Feb bottom. 
We made a lower low, trend is broken. More bloodbath inc.
What a lovely day. So tempt to close my short from 6800, how far do you guys think this will go?
All I know is, if we go up to test 6800 again, I'm all in. That'd be bullish as heck!
People looking for bottoms...wait for the capitulation plunge which will happen before year end IMO. Sort of like the spike to 20k where everyone just clicks the buy button..you'll see the opposite heading down..there will be no liquidity to absorb the selling leading to the mother of all red candles..everyone will finally declare bitcoin dead..the doom and gloom will be insane..and there...there is where the bottom will be..there is where you buy..
And so it continues
While I am mid-term bearish still, to me it looks like if 6300 fails then we go back to 6000 which will finally break and then it's 5k.

So I would not be surprised if we pump it back up to test 6800 again and try for 7800. If that happens then I will be balls deep short from 7800.

As others here have said I am out of all trading positions.

Good luck to all


u/diydude How are you doing? ;)
Obviously a bearish move, but inverse head and shoulders is still in play.  This could very well be a manipulated move to cool off RSI and make room for an even pump higher.

Sadly, I think most of us knows how this story almost certainly ends eventually, but still room for short-term pumps higher.
The hope that this would be like April is all but extinguished. We did not see a lower low back then until after hitting 9700. 

This is undeniably bearish and the only sensible strategy now is to look for an optimal short entry. 
Hmm, another 50-buck red candle. Ten more of those (assuming no retraces) and we'll be back at 5800 (for a few seconds). :)

Bitcoin breaking down. Guess that makes this rally just a .236 correction?
I am new to trading view. I made this chart over the weekend. How do I get it to update to the current price to see how well it is following the yellow dotted line? 

Also I think the end of the pattern needs to be updated with two more bounces off the descending line and a completion around January 2019, not November 2018. How do I make changes? 

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/L5nF9mxh-BTC-to-the-Bottom/
Increasingly convinced that everything about RSI, VRSI, Volume and price movements shows a sideways market for a completely unknown amount of time.

It'd at least help me deal with the bull vs bear argument in this thread every single day. The fact no one apparently knows what exactly our short term market sentiment is, [sideways seems as good answer as any.](https://imgur.com/a/z7uXzbY)

No Bear army has ever breached the 6450 deeping wall or set foot down into the Hornburg 5750 wick.

Bears will break upon this fortress like water on rock.

Is this it? Is this all you can conjure, Bogdanoff....

Chin up bulls! The party is just getting started!

I think one more attempt at 6800 within the next 24 hours.
Nursing and underwater long from ~$7,100 still and still not too worried.

The Stoch RSI and RSI are both way oversold on the 4Hr charts.

Should expect a nice BGC any ^day ^^now
the bitcoin log scale just broke and we are now below the trend line on it. 
Where’s u/diydude at??? 
Well holding 4 day horizontal support quite well at least
So the last couple of weeks were the denial stage on the Cheat Sheet ™? If that so, panic on the next leg down makes sense
[removed]
Ouch. Glad I shorted at 6640 last night, but not happy to have been right. 
looking at the 1 week bands, the volume thing on the bottom of the graph is been red for more weeks than green, following most TA would say it's overdue for a reversal, probably 30k-50k

!long XBTUSD 6293 50x 90%
Market's bleeding out today=Buy some crypto for me. Again, red means buy, green means sell.

EDIT: I'm not stupid, I know I'm likely catching a knife in the short term! lulz...
 Not sure why so many think this was a short term play I was making. I'm buying and holding 1-4 years. I likely upvoted many of you who have downvoted me. I only upvote comments i like or find interesting and ignore other comments. Appreciate the downvotes because it is a good contrarian indicator that my play was certainly against the grain. My strategy is simple. Blood in the streets equals screaming buy, BGD equals good time to sell. Except to avoid asinine US capital gains tax laws, I gotta hold 1-2 at LEAST. I don't make the rules, just playing by em. We'll see in 2 years how well my strategy worked. Keep up the emotional upvote/downvote stuff Reddit! Those tears serve to strengthen my resolve.
[removed]
Maybe it's just me, but the sideways movements don't look that sideway'y at all for the last week or so?
On the 12H chart, 30 MA and 50 MA appear to be finally touching and looking to make a golden cross in the next few hours.. these levels need to hold.. doesn't surprise me that we are at such price levels. If it can bounce with solid volume from +- 100 here, possibility of inverse H&S as well..
I'm actually glad this is dropping now. I'm 3 days in to my 21 day DCA so I'm only about 15% in. As stated before if this makes a new low I'll stop DCA'ing and wait for the actual bottom and just hodl everything I've already bought. But I'm happy because if we do make a new low it will probably happen soon which will spare me a lot of fiat, otherwise all this drop does is bring my CA down. I just hope it doesn't bounce back up before my next buy tomorrow! Although, if it does bounce here that would be pretty bullish so I guess it will show that my current buys are not in vain. Good luck to everyone trading this. Volatility is still low, as even this drop is only 3% in 12 hours. 
When we popped up above the line on my chart I must confess I was fooled to go long - https://imgur.com/bjycKcV - now we must wait and see if we bounce here or go down further and trade accordingly. 
Is this an inverted head and shoulders? 

Edit.  1 day time. Looking at the volume the greens are still too weak compared to the reds. I just finished reading technical book so its just a noobs technical

Praying this drop was our final bear trap
Lot's off shorts here.... or willing...

Makes me thinking to Add.. For sure at these levels.
Gdax, Stamp and Finex price all staying close together. Wonder if the biggest whale is very active on all 3 keeping them in sync. 

I think Bitmex swap is near record open interest. Been in this $5800-$6800 range for a month now. Something will give soon. Which way will the price explode.
should bounce off 6300, if it winds up and then breaks down, probably a good short. Should get a bounce off 5800 too.
In 1 mile turn left. Your destination is on the right. You've reached your destination. Welcome to goblin town?
This is 2014, more or less. There will be a lot of muddling before we head up again, maybe not another year, but definitely 5-7 months.

Low volume.. down last hour...

This might be hard on bulls (and I know because my position just went underwater) but that's what you have to go through to make money in this market.

We are being supported by this line: https://imgur.com/a/KluB3Rc

Don't have much to do now other than wait for how this thing will bounce or if it'll dive again.

I got back into crypto early 2017 when Btc was in 1000 area. With was 80-120. Ltc was 50-60 bucks. Goblin town apparently is different for me than it is for many if people call 4 or 5 k goblin town. lulz

just reading the masses going long, means I'm short. Great contrarian indicator, follow the masses and do the opposite.

Any good news? why did it do that?

I'm annoyed for like 2 months already, so nothing changed ;)
No no, we are supposed to be at depression, not anger. This is a bad sign.
why, you can make money by shorting too. Still have my short opened at 6829. Will see how deep the dip is. 
Bullish or bearish, an oasis in a sea of garbage. Thanks for continuing to post. 
Quality. All angles reviewed = perspective. Thanks. 
> me has a hard time understanding why the world wont push forward with Bitcoin adoption

Really? Because what does Bitcoin do for anyone? Not a whole hell of a lot. It can add *some* anonymity, but not absolute anonymity, and for everything else it's just a pain to use compared to other payment methods. A couple third world countries undergoing hyperinflation and kids buying drugs on the internet isn't anywhere near enough to support these valuations.
7% retrace in a few hours after failing spectacularly to get past a resistance point located 70% below the ATH might just be considered by a few loonytunes to be quite the drastic price action.

But you know best, sir. 
Some inconsistencies in your analysis?:

"Elliot waves could show a strong case for bears too.

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/WPjYI2qL/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/WPjYI2qL/)

The pattern bears have set up isn't strong, though. It looks more like a [descending broadening wedge](http://thepatternsite.com/dbw.html) (inside a much larger falling wedge).

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/SKSm1EWJ/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/SKSm1EWJ/)"
Breaking 6400 is indeed bad news as you say. But the inverted head and shoulder still has a potential to form with the right shoulder sitting at 6300 (or even 6100). What's your thoughts on that?
You not only make great calls, but also is very flexible with them, as I can see from your edit. I find the latter really fucking hard to do.

I always wondered, What does "1/IBB" in front of "Indicator" mean though?? 
He bought at 6k7, 15x margin, so the liquid price should be around 6300 for his position size. He is still safe for now.
He is probably cleaning his lambo. With all seriousness I think this is a lesson to everyone here not to play with high leverage with no stops. There is no such thing as 100% sure that price will move in certain direction.
I think Satoshi would despise futures, trading contracts of bitcoin without having to hold the coin is just nonsense and leads to all the financial world manipulations that bitcoin was created to try and get away from.
Have been sayin all along that Future Market kinda killed BTC...

Not solely and it could be a nice stability but i cant See anything positive in this case,
Especially if big Players can pretty much Play both markets at the Same time
That bit about futures having a stabilizing effect is what I'm focused on. A stabilized price for Bitcoin might stay in the green region of the moonmath chart, which eventually makes that L curve everyone likes.

Thank you for your service 
maybe you will be glad you sold in a few dayz. dont feel so bad. it would have been bad risk management to just hold hoping for a bounce
I seriously wonder if big traders have bots scraping forums / telegram / slack for key words like "capitulated"
Bottomz McGillicutty
Way to take one for the team there champ
Did you have a plan laid out for yourself? Did you follow that plan?

More often than not you'll have another chance to participate successfully in the market (whatever that means for you). Just make sure that you take a step back and assess your situation before you enter again.
there it is! 
> a good bounce at 6300

Appears to be another anemic $50 bounce.
I don't think it's panic as much as resignation (at least in my case).

I enjoyed the bullish fantasies, but ever since $2k this has all felt like a surreal dream.

I'm not panicked - somewhat relieved to feel like sanity is returning. Of course for the new people this is terrifying, but they should have realized as soon as the 2017 excitement built (for little to no apparent reason), that it couldn't last.

Of course this is 100% my gut feelings, and not even a prediction. Maybe I'm stuck in my 2015 PTSD past, and we'll be mooning by next month. Who knows... 
ah yes! this time! This is the time of the great capitulation.
Depends... what is Long? 1 week, 1 month, 6 months or 1 year+.

As stated before... slowly adding since 6200$. 

And now again at 6300$+.. 

( sometimes I'm OK when it goes down with Red legs... makes me happy to add ), Not nice to watch off course but I take advantage.

Not a 1 hour - 4 hour day trader.... longer term...

Same I did when we were at 600$ and 1200$.

All good.
I'm also super conflicted. Got stopped out of my scalp this morning at BE. Personally I'm expecting BTC to make another leg down after it's done painting the bearflag (if it even is one), but the parabolic growth in longs/short ratio in eth has got me thinking there might be a short squeeze in that market, which would drag BTC along with it. 


6455 too low you think?
What are some of those implementations you refer to? In terms of real-world utility, solving existing problems or providing new value? (Not saying they aren't, genuinely asking as I'm not too familiar with specific  projects)

The way I see it, primetime is still quite a ways in the future. The ideas are great, but it seems we're still in crypto 1.0 (maybe even beta). We're beginning implementation, but it remains to see how it will play out, imo. Patience isn't fun, and I guess is counter to most people's motivations on this sub, but I think people would ultimately do well to try to think bigger picture every now and then. 
2018 has so far delivered 6 months of downward movement. I don't see many arguments which dispute that this activity establishes 2018 as a bear market. 

Unless we see a huge reversal over the next three months, it would be increasingly accurate to say that 2018 has been/will be a bear year. This bear year of 2018 will either be:

1) The same as 2014

2) Different than 2014

If it is the same, then at this point it makes sense to exit any long position and come back in a years time. If it is different to 2014 then it will either be:

1) More severe than 2014

2) Less severe that 2014

If it is more severe then dump bags now. If it is less severe then dump bags now. 

So now that we've acknowledged that what happened in 2014 is completely irrelevant to what is happening now, we can all get back to enjoying the show :)
Yeah the 4h ichimoku tells the same story. Antsy to see where we go from here.

When toying around with a new indicator the first thing to do is backtesting. Ignore whether your usage is "valid" according to some 70 year old rulebook, see if you get good signals in the past.
I don't quite get the idea behind "hidden" divs.   
   
Looking at the second example on your chart it shows that the average volume on drops has been higher than the average volume on rallies. The way I interpret this is that the buying pressure is decreasing and bulls are running out of steam to push the price higher, hence obv diverges down from the price. Also, looking at the highs, rather than lows, it seems to be a not-at-all-hidden bearish div with price making higher highs and obv making lower highs.   
   
How's any of that supposed to be bullish? Isn't the price supposed to be following obv?
what does U18 mean? I saw some funky numbers like that on a video of BitMex but I can't figure it out 
I wish i had your optimism.
Since you are using bitmex, a quick question for you. Do you use VPN every single time to log in and make trades or did you only use it to make your account? Also have you tried to withdraw any btc without VPN? Sorry for these random questions. Thanks!
Nice! I'm about to hit the sack but put some laddered orders on eth down 2.5% from current price, hoping for a squeeze in the next couple of days. 

I agree with your statement that 6300 is holding well, and I'll be looking tomorrow morning if it's still up there for another try for a long position. (don't want to enter a position overnight)

Good luck on your trade! (sweet entry btw.)
Didn’t you get liquidated today for going long last night?
fingers crossed, lets see if it holds around this level.

4900, 5500, or even 5800 would be a more attractive accumulation pricing. Those prices would quickly flip bears to bulls and would be a worthwhile R/R buy. I think I’ll wait until the next futures close on the Blood Moon eclipse to see what the price does before touching the sideline fiat.
I like your style, never a bad thing to keep some dry powder around.
Sorry to hear about your misfortune. Some things are more important. I hope you'll find happiness in the future.
Too bad, giving advice feeds my ego.

> My outlook on price is once again bearish as hell, I believe that the 6800 breakout was our only hope for the bear market to be over, now everything looks like shit again and we are probably actually going to go back to like 2.5-4k over the next several months to year.

Why is that your outlook? What is your rationale?
I have been following your posts lately. You have a good understatement of the market and how it works but got liquidated nonetheless. No signs of a retrace, RSI between 20 and 30 on the 1-4hr charts that's soon gonna reset and we're back to shorting this, just like the past 7 months. Shoutout to u/ibankbtc and every advice he has written to you and not only about trading sentiment in general, been following closely and want to thank you for your blog and posts. Soon gonna publish a short.
You should have re-read that completely deluded comment you made when you opened your long and then immediately closed it. 

Anyone that experiences that level of euphoria for the price action we saw in the past 72hours should just take a step back and focus on other things in life besides trading. 

Goodluck.
I'm sorry to hear about your losses.  All we can do is try to learn from our mistakes and change our future behavior.

EDIT: Sorry I replied with sympathy and advice against your wishes.
What was your peak in terms of BTC and USD value? I just wanna put the 2.3 BTC in context.

How did you get anything returned after liquidation on mex? Especially as much as 2.3 BTC. Did you have a stop market at your liq point?
> Do not reply with sympathy and advice - this is a trading sub not therapy session or life support group.

Jesus fuck, the advice you were given was *trading advice* by *traders* in a *trading sub*. It's not just about charts; risk management and trading psychology are equally important. Being healthy, rested and not overcome by emotions isn't some life improvement bullshit, it's a prerequisite for successful trading. It looks like you still haven't learned that lesson.
How did you not take profits as a trader at $19k? Shit happens, you know better now, as do I because I've made similar mistakes.
so your the typical trader cliche. Don't worry your in good company with 99% of everyone else that thinks they can "beat the market"
Sorry to point this out, but you probably did take profit in that you bought and sold if you were trading... so you probably owe some gnarly taxes and are most likely in debt.
How is turning $2,000 into $14,650 is not winning? You've made profit and it is very big profit. You can reward yourself with a nice trip and still have some USD left to buy bitcoin or any other crypto at the ultimate bottom (1-2 years from now) and start increasing your $$$ further as real natural growth happens. (Provided that you sell your btc before that ultimate bottom is reached). 

Remember that many people really lost a lot of real money this year. In fact, I think most people on the market ended up losing money, not their profits, but actual initial investment made sometime in 2017. You must be very well in the top 10% who got out of this bubble without any dollar losses, so consider yourself a winner, no matter if it was just pure luck. I personally earned a lot less than you (only 2x my initial investment) before I got out into fiat again and I consider it a successful adventure. Because why the hell not? Any USD win is a win in my book.
At this point, I think you are at this point either you make it back to where you were rich or you lose it all. You will be in this game and unable to withdraw. And I speak like that because I did that when I first started. No matter what, your life is ahead of you, your real life can be picked up again, life will move on and friends can be remade. Treasure that, again that is how I felt after the fact.
Seems like you're just trolling dude.  Truly hard to believe someone could be this delusional.  

Also haven't you claimed to be fully rekt several times before? Where do you keep getting $$$$ to re-load and trade such large sizes?


Thanks for the honest prose.  You have a cool story - you made a mil and you lost it.  

There is this pernicious delusion in the get-rich-quick world of crypto (and others) that money will fix things... and well, it doesn’t.   You made a mint and bought a lambo?  Cool. Guess what - you still suck as a human being. You’re a shitty human being with a stupid shinny lambo. 

‘Money doesn’t buy happiness’ isn’t some happy aphorism for the unders, and there is no way to convince those dead set on fortune that this is the case.  But from my observations, both personal and external, once you get a taste of money it becomes clear that it’s nothing more than the salve for surface level survival.  To this end, once the shine wears off, an excess of money often makes many people’s lives demonstrably worse.  What emerges for many is the rank existential sense of ‘now what?’  

In your case you didn’t even cash out ... it was a game, and you rode the whole ride.  Good on you bud. 
>Do not reply with sympathy and advice

Okidoki! 

>Yes - I will run this 2.3 btc back to the fucking moon and no one can stop me

Hell yeah, I can't wait for the market to decide on a direction and get those good ol' green day streaks back! To the moon! (Hopefully sooner then later ;) )
If you want to trade, go to regulated markets, this is the wild west only that you don't have a gun. Try to liquidate those coins into actual money and get a broker account.
wow you are right 3000 BTC sells.

either someone wants to accumulate or someone is getting ready to paint a break out on high volum

of course that person might have a short open and isn't a fan of how bullish people have gotten 
I was just saying that- I haven't seen the ask side this thick...ever. Maybe months ago

is it spooky? (spoofy for sell side) or underwater longs?? 
Good luck, Sisyphus ;)
thanks!
Thank you for the work.  I know fighting against a backlog can suck. :/
lol @ the timing. market takes a downturn and bulls demand a permanent safe space from the mods. surely just a coincidence with pricing action.
Can you step down rule enforcement 
I had the exact same thing happen to me a while back, only in the other direction (stop loss bought the exact top). Yeah, it sucks.

Super happy (for now) that I put mine ~$30 lower that I was going to because of the random wicks that we've seen recently. Mine would have been right around there as well.

Condolences. But at least now you can enjoy the vacation and not worry about babysitting a position.
Oh man, that's rough. Sorry to hear it.

I only use stops (for losses, I mean. sometimes I'll lock in a gain with a stop if it goes my way right away) on the rare occasions that I go short, and that's only because I use more leverage on the short side. On the long side, just keep your leverage low and be prepared to add if it goes south.

I'm long from 6550 right now with 3x. If it goes to 6100, I'll double down. Not the least bit worried. 
Why wasn't your stop on a whole number? 
Fuck man.

Enjoy your vacation!

You might not wanna hear but I ended opening a position too on September, since you did, and still have it. (though earlier I did like a $20 scalp before that but didn't have confidence and dropped it)  Pulled my 6277 stop when it was getting wicked through down to 6206 but bfx looking like finding support on the new potential channel line (and thanks to the mark price trigger it didn't get triggered).  Then I more than doubled down and took the ca to 6320 on sept (ca was originally like 6360). 

So you can live vicariously through this position since it's essentially yours.  I promise I won't fuckup the ca and add to it higher ;)

(edit, I already closed some to cover fees and derisk it)
Rest in peace my friend. One of his recent comments was:

"kaktusface • 4 points • submitted 16 hours ago
Lmao! Didn't see that. The reason is that I don't think we are going lower than the previous consolidation of 6500--6600 so a liquidation a bit under 6500 feels safe"

It went more than a bit under 6500. 

Let this be a lesson to never. ever. gamble. 

Good luck man! Hope this will play out well for you.
The first mistake you did is you didn't recognize you're playing a game with no rules in a rigged casino. Rest in peace.


You can't stop trading now, you just paid 6 figures for your education. Come back on teamspeak. 
Doing my part, stay strong soldier.
I’m sorry, man. I just saw some huge liquidations on bitmex, and I assume one of them is yours. I would take a few days off to pause and reflect, as I can only imagine how painful such a huge loss is. If you still decide to return, I wish the best of luck to you and hope you’re able to use these experience to continue to improve as a trader.  I lost half my bitcoin stack a few months ago from overleveraging, so I know these kinds of losses can hurt. However, I managed to make back my losses after a few months with slow, steady gains. Just realize there are important things outside of crypto/money.

Best of luck to you.

I'll pray for you. Good luck.

in the name of all thats good, stop trading, you have no idea what you are doing. I can only hope you quit this pattern. 
What is exact liquidation price sir?
SFYL. I saw you were 52 XBT up at one point. As long as you took profit on that one and didn't go all in here, you'll still be right as rain.

Damn, feel for you brother, at least you have 10,000 BTC though, a lot here have lost everything on margin :/
I have felt for a long time now that alogs are waiting for such situations to dump into the emerging liquidity.
What is this indicator?
lagging indicators are not of a big importance when predicting a market direction. 
6.6K is holding strong. At the moment. 
Throughout most of the bullish grind of 2016, following that indicator would make you buy back in higher than your selling price almost every time. Sell at 440 and buy back in at 530? Ouch, there goes a large portion of your stack. No reason to assume that this  lagging indicator wont make you do the same type of thing in a grinding bear market.
It's almost like there are longer trends that are more important the the 50/200 4hr. Look at something slower and you'll see the trend is just starting to get bearish. 
> Bears seems to be back in control again. 

They were never out of control, the bulls delusion just seems to have subsided.
Close what?
Still, there's something to be said for sticking to a plan.
No Inverted head and shoulders :(

Pass
[deleted]
The liquidations are based on the index price + some fair value calculation that they do. The actual price often wicks up higher than the index.
Maybe you chose "index" for liq price rather than "last price" (on bitmex)
Very close to stopping out, will let it play naturally. 
Ah damn, I should have included bull/bear div on my bingo card...
Uhm, Maybe I'm drawing it wrong, but I have us way below that support trend (march/July lows 2017)

Where do you have that line currently?
you can still sell and buy back in lower. think long term. buying back in lower gives you more coins for the next bubble.
22000 to 23000, yeah they are just going parabolic lol
This whole move has looked entirely corrective. *Slightly* higher highs and then the move is swiftly dumped back down. Its not  sustainable market structure, and this move has added a lot of longs, lowered a  fair amount of shorts and has reset indicators. It's mostly just the bullish divergence on the 1D playing out and in no way looks like a trend changing bottom on a macro scale.

Even most bulls have long targets in the low to mid 7ks, which is pretty telling. I've seen a few bulls here talk about $8k but I think that ship has definitely sailed..we'll see.

I see no reason to close my short (still very much green) but was hoping to add in the 7ks.

What...no...wait...no....just no...it can't be....peacehere...no...what.

Are inverse h&s more likely to play out than h&s? Cause this feels hopiumy to me
Why didn't I trade [this?](https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8wqhds/daily_discussion_saturday_july_07_2018/e1z82ma/?context=3) Legit, I thought of that 3 days ago and now I see everyone is talking about a IH&S. I'm quite proud I spotted a trend before anyone else
I don't know shit about divergence really, but I was just looking at the 4 hour and noticed what I thought could be possible bull div (comparing this last candle to the one on 6/28 when the RSI was at 28 (currently at 26).  Or is that not how it works (i.e., do you have use immediately successive highs/lows?)
That's my target for a Long after I close this short. Shooting for a close around $5.9k but we shall see what happens. It's going to get interesting and bears have a lot of work cut out, imo, after that $1k move though who knows. We are back to $6.2k.
Can't believe I missed that channel. Good find. I'll be looking for how the market react to this support
Historically, Barts where the down leg ends higher than the up leg have almost always been bullish indicators. The uptrend is full of this behaviour, repeatedly, while the downtrend was the opposite. If the downbart can't make a lower low, then it is likely to upbart higher later. 
I've been watching the 20 day ma as well. It's been a resistance area for the downtrend since 10k. I'm short from 6.7, but I moved my stop to ~6.45 in case we do bounce and continue up. My target is 6k ish, which would make this a similar drop to others in this downtrend.
Ahhh, the infamous Abby and Brittany Hensel IHS pattern. 
This formation has 2 very distinct 'heads'. 
Wrong, IHS is supposed to show the MOST volume on the right shoulder, particularly when breaking up towards the neckline.  Whether or not that happens remains to be seen.
I hope/expect that it doesn't even retest the neckline. It was a pretty obvious double/triple top where whales filled their shorts and removed their bull masks and put on bear paws in front of everyone
[deleted]
The huge falling wedge is probably more relevant in this situation.
When you're looking at it on a 'massive' scale, logically it makes more sense that the market dynamics are completely different to the much smaller timeframes. I would assume that purists will say it doesn't matter, but that just doesn't make sense to me. Also, the utility of all charting patterns is based on the premise that past performance reflects a likelihood of future performance. Sometimes the likelihood is very low. A pure classical chartist like Peter Brandt only has a historical win rate of around 40%
At what level? 
Friendly reminder that we're right above the support.

*Pandemic! Got that Pandemic!*
I think there are probably much better indicators to use than these comments.
Meh, I think bitcoin is stuck between 5800 and 6800 and might continue for a decent while longer. Buy low sell high friends. 
it's the daily, not this sub. the sub is actually very critical of TA outside of the daily discussion.

I personally would love more discussion of fundamentals- usage, adoption, sentiment - not just "omg bulls/bears are too happy, time to go the other way!" either, the viability of bitcoin/cryptocurrencies - which to be fair does appear here quite often during downtrends, and news

Unfortunately some people attempt to match fundamentals to 5 minute price movements despite a completely disparate time frame: e.g. earlier today, someone said we jumped $100 because trump announced the $200b tariffs on china. o_O 

I've seen people correlate completely random news with btc (mostly bullish people) and it's just dead wrong less than a week later.

I also believe the problem here is that lately, lots of fundamental analysis of bitcoin can lead to a rather bleak outlook and it's much easier to twist TA to conform to preconceived beliefs than it is to do that with FA: "this is good for bitcoin!"

The extent of most news/FA with bitcoin lately seems to be "this exchange was hacked" and "here's a new exchange" with the occasional SEC update. but even that is hard to discuss because discussion of alts is discouraged despite it being pretty important to the future of bitcoin/crypto (imo)
Everyone here reads the news and has a feel for general sentiment. The only actually new thing you suggest is astrology, which is utter bullshit.
Most people here are not skilled. You get a lot of bad TA here mixed in with the few professional traders.
Large successful trading houses use astronomy and astrology to help them place their bets?

Are you being serious?

Can you link to any sources?
Very truthful message, someone had to say it.

The bull case is that ~6k is the bottom. I don't care if we have to bounce off it again to prove it. We didn't fall through it in February, April or ten days ago. We won't fall through it (by much or for long, anyway) tomorrow. 

This little dip is nothing. It's funny how excited you guys get. Must be tough.
You got it wrong, it's not really an inverse h&s. The double bottom makes it an inverse b&s. [FTFY](https://i.imgur.com/4iR0JUg.png)
When half the posts in this thread are talking about the ih&s I'd be blown away if it played out still.
There is no inverse H&S, not even close, no clue why people keep talking about it. Why talk about something that does not exist? What i see in those charts is a major rejection at 6700s-6800. 

90% odds that the 6300s support will be lost in the next hours or few days. What you see in the previous hours is a bear flag so i personally don't believe it will take long for the support to be lost. 
too good if true.
We've talked with /u/haserfauld some time ago that those drops look like fractals and all are very similar. I thought this one is different, but it looks like it's just bigger than others.
Following your own pattern it should fall to $6100 then rise to $7700?!
$20k to $5800 wasn't enough of a drop for you?
So you are short?
So everyone should stop buying and let the price drop to zero? Why don't you stop selling instead?
Without people trying to catch the falling knife, the price would just crash to zero on the next dump.
Once in couple of trades I try to position myself for a bigger move. Every time I get rekt by this. Looks like it's still not the time to set up for the reversal.
The April low has held through July so there may be a bounce now?
Where are you looking at to add to your short?
How on earth do people trade using ichimoku when every timeframe shows support/resistance at different levels? It seems to me that you just have to analyse movements after-the-fact with different settings/timeframes until you find one which coincides with the price action.


I use  what some call the "crypto settings" of 20,60,120,30...which has the 4hr cloud support right at 6300
The liquidity is not great on Kraken, so the wicks tend to be bigger (i.e. more stops are run). I use Kraken as my fiat exchange to buy spot, or buy for cold storage. I typically market buy this and don't need to worry too much about liquidity (just some spread/slippage which is annoying but ok).

Fees and volume requirements aren't great on Bitfinex. So I don't trade there.

Then I use Bitmex for my swing trading, which has better liquidity. Just read up on the difference between mark, last and index price and how that works!
I was wondering why ppl like BitMex so much? The leveraged trades?
Take off your stop loss and you won't have to worry about it. It happens everywhere, on every exchange. I use Kraken because Bitfinex wanted the world upfront, and when I sent it to them they "lost" it (ID, POR, Social) 
Finex
Look at the 12 hour charts. Every time we dropped this much in a 12 hour candle, it is followed by further drops, sometimes bigger..

People throwing their hands up, at the mercy of the rich folks picking which direction the bart goes. 
eventually yes, much lower, but it's gonna take a while to grind through this 5800-6800 range.
LTC is dead
They didn't buy 10% of a German bank. 

They've partnered with TokenPay, who already owned 10% of the bank, today bought another 10% and will buy the rest once it gets the green light from the German authorities.

Very good news anyways, people seem to fail to understand what it really means. To me it's a gateway between the fiat and crypto world's, seamlessly integrated now.

It's the same thing coinbase wants to achieve by applying for a banking license in the US.

A lot of bearish hopium right there.
Tbh the chart tells me it's bearish. I honestly don't get why people are bullish and would like to know why.
Connors RSI is a combination of three things: RSI, ROC, and a calculation of the number of consecutive days that price has closed up or down.  Sounds very similar to me to the kind of TA that you do, and it might be worth reading up on if you've never heard of it.
Above 1H, less than that is too much noise. Just know the rules for trading them.
Its even useful on the 5min charts in certain market conditions.
No need to market buy like a madman when people are willing to market dump thousands of BTC if you wait long enough.
Where's the wall?
From where 
Starting to look like a higher low and a scared bearwhale flashing his last 4300 coins to me.
Don't worry, if people weren't confident about the next bullrun at 6800 then they will be even MORE confident now that we are at 6350. 
Am I really not safe from World Cup spoilers in bitcoin markets? Sheesh

Good, its the only way we'll see ath again.
> Volume is crap all day and then there are random pumps with large volume that temporarily move us upwards, thus getting everyone hopeful for another bull run.

This is going to keep happening.
Fantasy narratives won't save you.
According to your chart we should have walked to 7.5k. Why are we still on target?
Considering that the price hasn't moved much, its safe to say everyone is still on target.
I hope so
> losses are NOT deductable   

move

>* any trade of a cryptocurrency that is in the profit is a taxable event (at around 35%)
>* losses are *NOT* deductable

>I mean, doesn't these two things in combination make profitable trading impossible in practice?

Sounds more like it makes profitable trading 35% less profitable than in a no-tax jurisdiction?
I lost money so far so they probably could care less whether I reported it or not lol.  

What bothers me is not paying taxes but that that hard earned money is used so inefficiently and they take such a massive chunk.  I dont know what the percentage would be here in Canada but I assume it just gets added onto you income.  We dont tax gambling in Canada though so maybe people here could make an argument bitcoin is gambling 😋
Um, what?

Are you sure you're not just taxed on net profits for the year, with net losses not deductible against other income sources?




They'll try to tax the lossy trades too if they can.

Reminds me of the Beatles song.
Where are you getting 35%. US Federal short term captain gains tax is based on income and ranges from 10-39.6%. Please stop spreading bullshit and actually look up the relevant tax code.

This also doesn’t include income tax that may be required by your state.

And losses CAN be deducted. Whatever CPA your using, please don’t use them ever again.

The following is only relevant for US. Since OP didn’t post where they are located, I’m assuming US.
If that's accurate then that is crazily immoral.

Why are governments such \*\*\*\*s. They are meant to exist to aid people's lives, whereas nowadays its more common to take people's money to "aid" those who don't do anything. (and waste half of it on the way).
where are you based?
You and everyone left in the market who is basically just traders
July 2017 bottom at 1800.  Complete with the nasty neckline retest 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/CIefwGoY/
Here's another thing. Remember when the triple bottom was supposed to save us and give us a bull in June? When EVERYONE sees the pattern, it almost never happens.
I'm generally very bearish, however there's bullish divergence forming on the 1 hr RSI (bitfinex) - RSI didn't make a lower low on the last dip to  6260 usd. I think a total bloodbath (where we go much lower than 5.7k usd) is still uncertain at this point.
I'm not so sure about that. This area has pretty strong support. If bulls are wanting to paint an iH&S this is exactly where it will hold. If it stop and reverses anywhere between here and 6150 it'll look really good for the bulls. Only if 6150 breaks would I think it will start looking bad, but even then, we made a new low only a few weeks ago and absolutely nothing came of it. 
Not really. Not looking good, but 6300 is still hanging in there.
It is looking like an evening star with those wicks. (Bearish)
Take some profit, don’t get greedy. 
Think it's too early to say with confidence. Bitcoin is being Bitcoin.
You have some good profits, I say realize them. Or at least part of them. 
I live. I die. I live again

Edit: I thought we were quoting Mad-Max and you were blatantly edit the comment 🤷🏻‍♂️

Edit2: Close it
Similar position. Set a stop loss (I set mine to 6550) and let it ride.

Lost profits is lost money too. Hindsight is going to be 20/20, and you may hate me for giving you the wrong advice or love me for giving you the right advice.

But taking profits too early is painful just as well, according to my experience.

MAN UPPP

Having said that, 6300 is a really strong support. BUT if we break it, imagine the upside(or should I say downside)
I am in a similar position to you (short from 6750) And I just reset my stop at 6411 (to avoid stop hunters). 
OK.... lets first start ...What do you think??
Some people may not get the joke without /s.
So 5% higher price is more attractive to you?
Dunno man. The markets current state feels pretty dead to me. Average joe that bought some BTC for the lulz in Dec has since long left and probably already forgot BTC even exists anymore. This show is run by Bart Simpson Whale & Co and other than that there's not a single ounce of retailer interest. 
I don't get where everyone got this idea that a correction has to resemble a biblical apocalypse.

with what?
I think he might be ok with this small little dip...
He's working on his latest incoherent song to whip out the next time there's a $100 pump. 
You'd make more betting against a h&s with crypto. It almost never pans out.
Where is the lower low? This is setting up a textbook inversed head and shoulders of we go sideways ish for a week
A 7% adjustment in price... It doesn't even register compared to alt markets. The price of Bitcoin fluctuates. I wouldn't read too much into this.

Relax.
I don't have the april feeling myself.

But it did have a final fakeoutish drop of about $450 on the 9th before the BGD.  So if one wanted, they could still draw parallels.
[removed]
[removed]
Too early to say, I'm still seeing higher lows.
Not calling this a breakdown till we break 6500. That's where my stop loss is at as well as I assume a lot of others.
depends on which swing high you are using
At this point yes, but I wouldn't be surprised if we get another wave to 0.382 before going down again.
Press play. Doesn't work on mobile though.
It would be nice if the price would plummet to the 4000 range with a V-shaped bounce and continuation, but like you I am projecting a lot of sideways action with a slow bleed that will perpetuate the bear market into next year. Sucks, but there's just no enthusiasm in the market right now. 

As I've said before, big news from national regulators or another financial crisis could reinvigorate the market, but most consumers are fine with the status quo. 
I mean in little under a day we were able to retrace that entire BGD (and then some) sooooo yeeeeaaahhh.....
So much 'dips'. What can men do against such reckless 'dipping'?
 
Yes chin up.

Yes. Chin, the only thing up.

What do you mean by the bitcoin log scale?
We are definitely still above the bitcoin log scale crypto chart trend line.
Depends on which trend you are following on the log scale.
I was wondering the same, he originally closed his long from 6300 at 6450 only to reopen it at 6500. Wonder if he closed it or not.

The struggle of getting too much gains
why?
That's not TA, that's the Gambler's Fallacy. Just because we've had x number of red weeks in a row doesn't mean this one needs to be green.

Edit: Although, with your price target maybe you are just being sarcastic. I'm one of those people that really need that /s at the end of the statement.
The price difference in the past week according to the gospel of Coinbase, is $89 dollars if you look now. That’s just over 1% price difference if you’d held a position over the past seven days.

Relative to recent volatility, that feels pretty sideways to me.
Wouldn’t an inverse head and shoulders needed to have gone up and broken out when the shoulder was up at 6800?
wait, now you are happy about drops, and upset if it bounces back up? wtf? crypto has some of you guys completely blinded. and dca is a scam to keep fools buying dying assets, so there's that.
From $6818 at 6pm to $6318 at 7:30am, that's about 7%. This may not be the most volatile Bitcoin's ever been, but that's a low bar. Regardless, I really don't think "low volatility" is accurate. 
Could still just be a higher low forming on the daily. That was a $1000 green move up, after all. 

But yeah, got stopped out of my hopeful long last night as well. No clear trend change yet. 
Could be, eventually.  Could run right back up to the neckline and get rejected.  Have to wait and see. These things are not very reliable to gamble on, IMO.
Could you show it on a chart or give the timeframe please ?
only if it goes sideways for a some days and goes back to 6800$.
Inverted, double headed, mutant of a head and shoulders creature appearing on the 1 Day chart, it might just be the devil.
no, it's a huge bear flag.
God isn’t long here, my friend. 
>Praying this drop was our final bear trap

See you at 7k
Bears too used to making insane profits off of shorts, so they immediately open them as soon as a large green candle appears.  This is about the point bears start getting wrecked and losing about 80 percent of their last 3 months of profit through overconfidence.  Ask me how I know.  Actually don’t, the memories burn.
The bear fud is strong. Lot's of irrational fear mongering. I'm waiting a while longer, but the smell of opportunity is there.
Nah whale with 3 different screens/ UI / APIs!
Or it could just drop a further 7-10% in the next day and go to 5600/5700 ignoring all that stuff.
And what is Goblin Town for You???

100  -300$ down?
No. This is 2018, not more or less. Welcome
Yeah, having been around since 2013, the last few months have felt very similar to 2014 (depressed atmosphere, but still with glimmers of hope). Then came 2015, and basically everyone stopped even thinking about a rebound. 

The timescale is faster this time, but of course this is crypto - past performance means next to nothing in any reliable fashion. But my gut tells me the bottom won't be seen until all the pumping and dumping dies down and speculation becomes a waste of time. Crypto is so nascent as a technology, so is infrastructure and adoption - it's impossible to accurately judge its $ value at this point. Can anyone really make an objectively convincing argument that $4k is a more reasonable price than $800? I'm bullish in terms of a 5-10 year scale, but anything much smaller is educated gambling. Which is fine as a source of semi-profitable entertainment.

Personally, I think how people trade changes like tides. It seems there's a lot of people flipping between buy and sell on $200 turns. 6800 - 6600 - 6800 - 6600. This could one of the many reasons why the price is floating where it is.
Weak hand already sold, or will keep selling until a bottom is reached.

Any run produce enough fomo for people to hold.  smart investors will however probably cash out a &#37;age just in case
to be fair btc price was 5900$ 12 days ago lol

Either one is dumb. You can't gauge market sentiment by reading comments on reddit.
I agree with Johninthai about doing opposite of what many others seem to be doing. I get down voted  for mentioning contrarian trading and don't understand why. It's a legitimate trading method that's worked for me more times than not.

Was there bad news for the dump? It doesn't need news for it to do anything.

If you look at the volume candles on the 1 min, it took a lot less volume to push it up that high than down, meaning whales can push it in a direction easier than the other leading to a harder cascade of stops/liquidations.

Edit: Also, it was a new daily.
Over sold
Exchange hacked or something 
It may be time to set buys in the 4K range and walk away for a little 
Of course the dude is angry lol he went 5x long 5 hours ago
easier said than done genius
Glad you liked it. Was aiming for a balanced view. I think I ended up leaning bullish overall with the analysis...

Really, I think we're just in a position that has slightly higher risk than we observed yesterday.
I don't agree that anonymity is a use case. I don't think we agree on the landscape of the market, either. We probably disagree about this on a fundamental level and I don't want to have that discussion right now.

Thanks for commenting. Good luck!
Welcome to Bitcoin.

The drop you're talking about was 4.5%.

Yes, that is common.

Here's how common that is:

Some people have said trading against him is profitable, as in trading the inverse of his positions. Ibankbitcoin = ibb. 1/ibb = inverse of him 

He probably uses it as a joke because he's obviously profitable and taunting the haters 
True, I think he cleared maybe 2mil on bitmex when he shorted, the margin requirement alone pushes his liquid price much higher.
I don’t see a problem with gambling(unless you have a gambling problem lol) 
As long as you aware that this is what you do, and use a stack that is dedicated to it, it’s just like playing online Poker or going to the casino
They certainly screw up the incentives for (dis)honest behavior, although the recent 51% attacks on same alts and their responses to it have been interesting (and less drastic of a response) than I expected. I'm waiting for someone to pull off a nuclear 51% attack and kill a chain completely.

Yes, I always follow the plan. Been in since 2012. $6300 was my hard stop. 
We may just be consolidating before another small drop to 6300 before a good bounce...we'll see
All good until you lose and your one yearly trade goes to waste. If you're talking about years down the line, that's not really trading.
Maybe so. My trades recently have been looking a lot like scalps in hindsight. I really don't want to get into that because I don't have the time nor expertise. I'd like to start DCA'ing in when it either truly feels like a bottom and/or capitulation or outrageous sell off, or when we start consistently knocking down resistance levels with volume. 

That's not happening yet.
there may be a wick above it. I just think  of the 0.5% as insurance. Are you in good hands?
The primary implementation I see developing is all the big players trying to position themselves in front of the security token market. The big one that comes to mind is tzero, they partnered with BOX (which montreal exchange is a major hidden piece no one talks about) and they purchased speedroute. Utilizing blockchain (specific to BTC they will utilize Liquid) they will be quite literally replacing BTCC/Cede & Co as a trillion dollar middle man with a decentralized immutable ledger. Speedroute will allow users of Tzero to basically access the best prices on any exchange utilizing digital locate receipts, and you already have coinbase and gemini trying to get in on this so the shared liquidity will be outrageous. 

The value production there will be in the trillions, and it will take because it will give brokers volume and liquidity improvements, it will add in direct custody, and it will allow users to fractionalize their holdings as well. Once atomic swaps are factored in you are looking at a complete shift in the concept of what an account can do, a 401k can act more like a checking and savings account as such.

Anyway, that is launching probably late Q3/4 and they will start trading right away. We already know the SEC gave a free pass to  BTC and ETH, both of which have tokenization mechanisms. So, you get fund managers putting in 1&#37; of their 401k money into that new market space and you are at a trillion dollars right off the bat. It basically allows BTC to act as a currency for the settlement of the transactions, and it utilizes the underlying network strength of bitcoin to provide the ledger that is needed to remove the expense of the middle man. That is happening RIGHT NOW but no one talks about it because it isn't sexy or easy to digest, but it is where a LOT of money is "wasted" and it is a true application of blockchain tech.
Try sending money overseas with Bitcoin vs any other method. It's faster and cheaper. 

Also, it has become a great vehicle for saving money for a lot of people. Buy the dips and all that.

RSK smart contracts. 

Being able to exchange money for goods/services without having your data pimped out. And on and on.

I'm convinced that these dips are manufactured and that someone is losing a lot of money on them.
You skipped the important option where this is different than 2014 in that it is a correction from a bubble but without market forces previously in play that would sustain a multi-year bear market. 

The underlying mechanisms are different, it makes more sense to talk about what the forces were that caused a multi year bear market then vs what mechanisms are driving price now. 
Fingers crossed. I'm in the capitulation phase since a few weeks already. Would love to see some green at some point.
Pls.  Just, finish the iH&S the same day they announce an ETF 
I remember the last time we were all drawing a giant triangle. That was back up around $13k-15k.
Here's how I look at it (on OKEX quarterly prices)

1. There was a bear divergence on the way up to 6900, with a target at local low 6333. This was a signal to sell: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/DSXilf6I/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/DSXilf6I/)
2. The target of 6333 for the bear div was reached and is now out of play: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/yK8OkPwH/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/yK8OkPwH/)
3. During the sell-off there was more sell-volume than buy-volume on the way up - OBV made a lower low. But price made a higher low. This indicates accumulation (someone's buying up all that sell volume). This is bullish and signals strength on the buy side and continuation of the uptrend: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/JGOZUiTL/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/JGOZUiTL/)
It's the name of Bitmex's inverse futures contract with September expiration: https://www.bitmex.com/app/contract/XBTU18
Longing support with stops right under.

Shorted all the way down from 10k. Figured i would play the other side for now 
Drink more and play more golf. Might help 😋
I never actually switched to Mex. 

Just gonna rock Kraken for now 
Use VPN to sign up, after that it doesn't matter.

I've sent btc from mex to someone without VPNm went fine
I’m hoping some shorts stack up and price remains stable. I’m actually surprised with the little amount of shorts that have opened. I guess people really think 5700 was the bottom. 

If we get rejected heavily at 6.5-6.6k I’ll close 100% and swap short 
You mean losing 1.24% on my stack? 
+1, All i can do now is pray
If it doesn't hold, there is always an A&E double bottom at 5.8 :-p this time the upside target would be much higher at around 7.8k ;-))
Like when it was oversold for 2 weeks?
TA is for {.............}
MA on bigger than 1h does work quite OK for daytrading though
Yeah will build a long below 6135... how long I hold that position will depend on what kind of reaction we get off that daily block
Thanks, all trades over last month or so have been public. Anyone can make these gainz with me. I just ask that you use my ref link on twitter and throw me some btc pennies :p
WAIT. I see value in his post! 
I agree, [I closed my hedge at 5900](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8uq6eg/daily_discussion_friday_june_29_2018/) and picked up some spot there as well.

I don't intend to spend the rest of my fiat stash until lower levels. Probably somewhere around 5000 should we make it there.
I was always of the opinion that we need a high volume capitulation and sharp V bounce for an actual bottom. Only reason I went long was I was hoping this fractal plays out and everyone gets fooled and left in the dust while bitcoin shoots back up: [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/tlo0V1AE-BTC-Capitulation-still-ahead-potential-reversal-soon/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/tlo0V1AE-BTC-Capitulation-still-ahead-potential-reversal-soon/)

Now, that was just a pipe dream. Charts are all rekt again, 2 weeks worth of difficult grinding wiped out in nearly a day, it's super weak again. 5700 won't hold and next support is really in the 4k's 
If some of your liquidation is sold at a price better than the bankruptcy price some of your maintenance margin gets returned. My margin was nearly 100 coins so 2.3 is not much to get returned. I don't wanna say my exact peak but it was in the millions in fiat and hundreds in BTC
How many people took profits? I mean, how many people that invested in BTC with success actually cashed out those profits to their Bank accounts? Lot of them are moving to fiat to buy in later, getting rekt eventually.
already taken care of, I did consultations and my taxes for 2017 are paid. Didn't take profit to use in real life though.
I mean, this is what I am telling myself to feel better. It doesn't erase the fact that just recently I had more than 100x that amount of BTC and could have been set for life if I played my cards right. It also doesn't erase the pain of 7 months of straight losses. A vacation isn't gonna cut it..
From [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8xlbz1/daily_discussion_tuesday_july_10_2018/e24v630/) post it sounds like he may have lost some real money as well:

> First I was rekt for my whole trading account. Then I moved half my cold storage to trading and got rekt. Then I moved the other half and got rekt. Then I took a small loan and got rekt. Sold some IRL assets to pay this off and buy more BTC at @8k, I then shorted from 7500 using that and tripled up, which is what allowed me to enter such a large long now...and I got rekt 
> How is turning $2,000 into $14,650 is not winning?

Because he could have spent the last 1.5 years flipping burgers at McDonalds, and made more money than that.
Look at the good news.  All of Bit-Mex founders are now billionaires, and you helped contribute to their wellbeing!  So you can take some comfort in that.
You are in like 1% who actually cashed out their profits. A lot of people don't do that.

Money doesn't buy happiness, but it's always better to cry in a lambo ;-)
I still wish to have the "problem" described above one day though. Life has been "now what?" for me every day, as I wonder about the purpose of our whole existence every day. I go to work, work a month, get money, pay bills, repeat... and then what?

It would be nice however to have a few less worries and just be able to pay the bills and work less. I will still be wondering about the purpose of all of it (that's just a given), but at least life will be more comfortable and easier.
Your bullish bias is showing.

This is your comment from 7 days ago:

'silly daytraders don't realize that the whales are ready to go back up, hence the 4000 BTC wall between $6400 and $6500 thats slowly being moved up(just look at the chart)'

How is it that you interpret a buy wall as a signal that whales want to push the price up, but interpret large sell orders as a sign that someone either wants to accumulate, wants to paint a high volume breakout or suppress bullish momentum?
Definitely, some battle lines being drawn.

I'm not sure if it's due to underwater longs though, they've held through lower prices, so not sure why they'd capitulate here. 

Then again, the market goes anyway it want's too. But I'm definitely keeping an eye on things because it might get violent quickly. Especially eth has been building a decent long/short ratio spring today, and it's still adding tension.

Edit: To add, I'm always a bit on the fence about massive public ask orders as normally for distribution it'd be in your best interest to place hidden orders, but that just my personal view.  
I’ve seen the bid and ask side this thick before individually during large moves one way, but never both sides so thick while the price was flat 
Now it's time to toss a coin...

I just hope my hedge stop won't be filled while I sleep just to dump again.
I've got a winch and a chock
If I had to guess, I take down about 5x more bull posts in bull markets. Shitposts from bears stay up longer and aren't reported as often. Posts like this are something we mods chuckle about. Total fantasy.
That may have been the top 10 “stop hunts” of 2k18. 

Never underestimate the Kraken wicks. They are notorious for stopping you out of great positions.

Blah.
Sometimes I like to place orders/stops to the cent because people like whole numbers and sometimes I can get lucky and prevent getting stopped  out ( not in this case) 
I’ll still keep tabs on Reddit when I’m in Florida so when you close for a fat profit at $6700 in 2 days PM me so I can get some sort of inner satisfaction that my fellow Broski made a successful trade. 

$6320 is a great CA. I’m pretty confused considering I thought when we would break through $6300 it would plummet, but RSI is low across the board so that could definitely be a reason why for the lack of dump. 

Good luck on your trade 
> So you can live vicariously through this position since it's essentially yours. I promise I won't fuckup the ca and add to it higher ;)

Why not split the winnings?

Seriously though, a month of gold will surely make this gentleman's vacation better.
I disagree. All degenerate gamblers know that the second best thing in the world to a winning gamble is a losing one.

Plus crypto is the biggest gamble of all time.
> Let this be a lesson to never. ever. gamble.

Are we pretending buying bitcoin is anything other than gambling that the price will go up in the future?
You guys realize these fuckers stop hunting are going to liquidate 2x longs at some point here.  Forget ideas of "support".  It's about how low does volume need to be to move market or take profit for the very few market movers left.  TA is crypto phrenology.  Just stop encouraging gambling.
I think it is only fair he mentions a range of liquidation, it is not a target prediction, its stop loss.
Bitcoin isn‘t always on time
He became absolute euphoric at the top and opened like a 15x long at like 6770. In reality, all he's doing is helping propel us down if/when he's liquidated.

I'm guessing 50 and 200 MA cross
all indicators are lagging by definition.
Its been kind of a reliable indicator. 

Not sure why the sub was so bullish two days ago. Almost feel like 7+ was guaranteed.
Fair enough :)
Clarified my original comment ;)
Yep, although a flexible plan. The craziness of crypto kind of requires a paradoxical mindstate where you can't get too obsessed with the daily (or even weekly) fluctuations, but you also can't make any predictions longer than a month or so. OR, you ignore the monthly fluctuations and focus on the yearly gains. Must achieve a zen balance. 
I should have at least put (inverted) in parenthesis to make this more complete.
When it jumped to 25 squares it was getting difficult to read!

and where is the US tax returns and Chinese new year? and whales are accumulating :(


Go back a few highs; nov 2015, jun 2016, dec, mar 2017

If it started jun 7th I'm ignoring that high
I am in toilet paper 
Lol, dude... bro... man...
The price does not go straight down/up. We rode the resistance-turned-support line all the way down to $5800. People started accumulating at those prices and drove it back up to $6800 and started distributing. If distribution continues here, I see these prices as more of a pit stop on the way down, as $6100 was never really long-term support. So maybe we could see a double bottom at $5800? I guess that’s possible as well, but it seems strange that we would retrace for the second bounce so quickly if it was truly the long-term bottom.
I am short term bullish quite often, but many people refuse to see it, because it suits their fantasies better if I am a "permabear".  

I am certainly bearish in terms of $5700 is likely nowhere near the 2018 bottom, but that doesn't mean the price can't be pumped higher from time to time and one can profit from it.
AFAIK they have the exact same likelihood(offcourse this is more of a subjective answer, also the patterns are only *proven* valid once they've completed...off-course thats where all the money is made, on the gamble of winning.  IH&S are only valid in bear markets. H&S only valid in bull markets. 

These are the rules

You look for a lower low with a higher RSI...but you have to wait for the candles to close

edit: if you google "bullish rsi divergence I am sure you will find many images
great minds think alike
The bottom line of that channel is just a random meaningless line so don't feel too bad about missing it.
it did make a lower low. Look at the charts...

also, you're basically saying "if the price goes higher than it goes lower, the price goes up"

The "Bart" meme is just "candle". 

So you're saying "if it goes up more than it goes down, it's bullish" 

o_O 

$6415 was the last low, we're now under that. This is a lower low
"historically", haha

I could see that happening on a break above the 6420 area. Don't think we have enough information from the past about moves of this size to give it much meaning though. 
The Mary Kate and Ashley double flat bottom?
Yeah, but the psychology remains the same. Going from lower highs and lower lows to higher lows and higher highs. 

I personally think the exact formations are maybe a bit overreacted too and the psychology of the trend change (short term as it may be) is more valuable to analyze. 

However, does anyone have any great example of IHS in bitcoin actually playing out? I was scrolling through some timeframes and am having trouble finding one that was perfected and came to fruition? Honest question, I am sure one exists, I just did not see one.....
Dude, forming the Right shoulder and breaking the neckline are 2 different phases.

Here is the "textbook" I refer too, all stated that the Left shoulder should be the most heavy volume.

It could well hit $7.8-8k at some point to hit the descending trend line before it goes lower than 5700. 
True, and TA and News and sentiment are sometimes (but not always) correlated, simply because that's the way the world works.
I agree that it is, that's why I called it esoteric.
OK, but reading news and having a general feel for the sentiment is not the same as analyzing these datapoints analytically and that's what I say is missing here. Look I'm not trying to offend, just making suggestions for how the sub and you alls trading could potentially be improved.

Well, if you don't care about $600 movements, why are you even posting here daily?
I wouldn't say 6k but 5800 yes.  I fully expect it to visit there again.  What is it about 5800 that is so resistant I wonder?  Why not other numbers?  If you look at the 1D chart though it is quite apparent that it seems that has been the absolute bottom since it was the absolute top in 10/2017.

My best guess currently is we make a double bottom at 5800 and then maybe the recovery will be taken seriously.
I hope this becomes a thing
thats why I am saying it seems too good to be true
You're bearish, we get it. *Why* is there no iH&S, which rules of the pattern are violated?
Sadly this is correct imo.
I can definitely consider it bigger than the others. Given the fact we have already hit the lowest point in price since our ATH, most supports have failed, more so, this last case seemed like a desperate attempt to turn the price around and away from sub $6,000, which is not unfolding well now..
This is not my own pattern, just see longer time frame charts (I am looking at 3H chart), zoom out so you can see for yourself what I am talking about. 

If the above is valid, the price can go lower than $5,800..
It is still a very high price..
No, it isn't enough, considering the fundamentals of Bitcoin and crypto right now.
Yes they should, for their economic self interest.  Unless you are a shrewd, quick trader, most buying leads to losses in this market.
People seem to get very attached to certain indicators, forgetting that they're only supposed to be a single point of information used as part of a holistic analysis.

Why is LTC dead?
Yes. People underestimate the importance of liquidity. if it was any other shitcoin i would never mention it here but since they are so tide together when it comes to development teams i do think it’s significant to BTC as well
Using TA doesn't make any of this less of a gamble. It's just an illusion to give people excuses for making certain decisions and I really don't think that traditional trading technicals apply to a market as irrational and volatile as this one. It's really just around to make people think they're not gambling when  in reality they are.

Premium/discount is just the price deviation from spot 
Huh? I see 13.8k for Sept open value 
Or down.

Yeah those Dush comments are unforgivable, really unfortunate stuff. (Unless he's literally a 14 year old kid, then I get it)
No, divergence (see the yellow lines). This example was particularly beautiful as it came with very nice entry and exit targets. Short at $6.7K (with stops just above 200EMA) and take all (or 50&#37;) profit at \~$6.3K (body of first bull flag that started this mini up swing from $5.7K).

I took 50&#37; at $6320 and am hoping to take the rest at close to $6K (...or below if bulls don't put up a fight). My stop for the remainder of this trade is currently just above the 4hr 100EMA (\~$6.5K).
2 more %, imo would mean new lows for alts.
Hopium for bulls, 

LSD for bears
"hopium"? I am not one of these perma-bulls/bears shitposers that spam BS here, the above statement is just a product of my long observation of this market.  
"hopium" == what to say when you disagree but don't have a competing argument to offer?
There is a big whale that likes to quickly pump BTC. 4 large random pumps since June 29th. That could mean close to $7000 and maybe higher if no whales start dumping and the bull whale comes back for a 5th time.
And that's why there's divergence in OBV.
BFX

* 6400 - 24
* 6500 - 1806
* 6600 - 1530
* 6700 - 1032
* 6800 - 94

that 94 is a very important number for me, means that if the sell wall is just spoofy then the real resistance is non-existent, which means a $1,000+ BGD move can happen at any time
poor fucker down to his last 4300 bitcoins
Flashing his last $27M?  lol...
That's not how it works. A lot of profit taking at 6.8 pushed the price down, but higher low says that bears are out of ammo and that builds confidence. That's how ascending triangles work.
What are you suggesting?
You're right, you should only be bullish when the price is high and bearish when the price is low...
People keep saying this thinking they are the exception to the rule: "I'm different, I will always think it's going to reach a new ATH and I will never surrender". The sad truth though, is that most likely you won't buy the bottom and hold until new ATH, or you might just leave and come back in a few years.
The barts will continue until liquidity improves.
I do not mind it happening one bit. Allows traders to profit from temporary longs on the way down. The random pumps usually end at past support levels so they are not impossible to trade.  
i need to find another TA i dont trade on to answer that... 



edit: i should have said /s, i thought my smileys are enough
Think of it as an exchange taking 35% fees.
Imagine a year where you end up a million dollars net positive. But you have made that million from hundreds of trades of which $11million worth are positive and 10million worth are negative. You have to pay 35% of the $11million in taxes ($3.85million). So after taxes your year is -$2.85million.
There are some truly retarded crypto tax rules out there. Depends where you live (obviously)
The new law states that each trade is considered as a separate "taxable" event and in the case of a loss it's not "counted" towards anything. You can't deduct the loss even towards a profitable cryptocurrency trade.
Eventhough USA is the best country in the world their laws don't apply universally ;)

And once the traders lose interest, then the bottom will be found. Imo. 
Let’s hope it’s an omen how July 2018 will play out. 
What is your target if the previous low breaks? 5k? 
$6415 was the last low- sub $6400 is a lower low and now all comparisons to April rally are off. The market is surprisingly bearish. I really expected more of a relief rally but people are incredibly anxious to sell at any sign of a recovery/bounce that any demand due to people simply not wanting to sell low is completely dwarfed by supply. 

This is beginning to look extraordinarily bearish and I really do believe my targets will finally get hit. Finally...-_-

I still firmly believe people will be surprised by the strength of the downwards trend. The end of a trend tends to be the strongest, especially with bitcoin

My interpretation of this price movement is people don't want to sell low unless they are basically forced to. Everyone expects to be able to sell on a bounce rather than the bottom- so they wait. Well, people get impatient and sell some early. the more people that intend on selling on a bounce, the smaller the bounce will be. 

This eventually turns the market from "sell the bounce" to "panic sell asap because this is going down"

Just like the market went from "buy the dip" in 2017 to "panic buy at any chance you get" near the end of the trend

Volatility and price are both down while market participation seems up, at a glance, at least: the daily discussion thread on $5.8k to $6.3k had more comments than the April BGD daily

To me, volatility down, price down, and market participants coming back to view charts/prices = people are preparing for a large move. Most probably preparing for down 

edit: all of this will be invalidated by a recovery above $6800 here which is entirely possible. 
Hmm, doesn't look like a huge dump, more coming or nah?
I think it's beginning to sink in for a lot of people that we may go down low and we may not recover that fast. We may get back to the level we're at now in a few weeks but if we break below 5K and continue down we could be stuck under there as a lot of people decide they want to get out at breakeven when it hits their price(both up and down). I don't see where all the bullishness has come from we're not even making higher highs on a higher timeframe of 1week+. 

I said this exact thing around 6800 last night and people didn't take to kindly to it but that may have been because I basically said it's possible we go down to 1.4K and if anyone has sunk more than they can afford to ensure that they cover their asses or at least hedge but it was without any TA. I'm hoping it is because if people aren't prepared for that we could go lower if real panic sets in.
> Bitcoin is being Bitcoin. 

Agreed

> Think it's too early to say with confidence.

You can never say anything with confidence with bitcoin unless you happen to be a whale holding enough coins to manipulate the market. 
 If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die historic on the Fury Road! 
My target is 6150-6200, but if we stay strong above 6300, then I will close 70% of the my position.
It would be bullish. It would affirm that the current path of least resistance is upwards.
Yes. I prefer purchasing at higher prices. That means the trend is up.
yes.
Have you experienced bear markets in any other assets? I have and they usually do. 
You know..... "accumulation" lol.
The lower low was <6400
> a textbook inversed head and shoulders

How many of those have completed in the last 6 months? How many have failed and dropped further?
Why are you bringing alts into this? I never mentioned them. I simply pointed out that such a thing did not occur with BTC on its last relief rally in April until just about the top. 

Maybe we bounce even higher than 6.8 and set some bear divs on the 12hr and daily where we can short confidently but that is just the best case scenario. More likely is that once again confidence has been sapped, we get a technical reset to the 6.5-6.6 range and then the bear machine keeps churning. 
There is always one tough guy telling everyone this is normal and not to panic.  
Maybe this was similar to the initial fakeout to 7500 that then retraced to 6500 before the real bgd. In any case all of this is not good for Bitcoin.

Fair.
Disagree with that being nice, a well formed iH&S combined eith some news about an ETF being approved /launched to put BTC back in the 10k range would be my version of nice.
Ahh, I remember my first rodeo...

I mean, I've been bullish overall, but opened a short just to satisfy my nagging feeling that things weren't looking so great. Made some money, but not happy with the way the market is looking overall.

EDIT: I'm a hypernoob, so what I'm saying might make absolutely no sense at all.

EDITEDIT: I mean, I've increased my BTC stack about 10% over the last few months, with only a few bad trades (none majorly so), so either I'm very lucky or have a good sense of things. But I should probably do a lot more lurking before trying to comment since the words I say are probably 99% garbage 
He's joking
Yes but... is it the gamblers fallacy? That's only for a non-markov system. I don't think markets are non-markovian - the system has memory. Honestly longing after like 6 daily reds is a good idea and the reverse. We all know that.
You do you then. "crypto has some of you guys completely blinded." Obviously you don't believe in crypto so there's not much for me to say to you. I'm only putting in what I can afford to lose, and I have no debt or anything so for me this is a great opportunity. So, yeah, I do want it to stay down here so I can accumulate 5% more. The lower the better. Have fun shorting this if you want.
Hard to miss it on the 12H.

I'd wait to make sure we aren't going to see a lower low.
Here's a look at the daily...

https://imgur.com/a/jexsJoK
Shorting during a bullrun seems pretty different to be honest. Like u/SloppySynapses said, it took a long time for margin longers to feel pain. You could have longed BTC for months during the bullrun at 2x or something and not get liquidated.
> This is about the point bears start getting wrecked and losing about 80 percent of their last 3 months of profit through overconfidence.

You are bad at maths.  10% bounce after 70% drop is not 80%.  It is 10/70, which is 14.2%.
There may be some "FUD" out there, but more important are the technicals and fundamentals of Bitcoin, and crypto, in general.  They do not point to higher prices over the next few months. 
Lots of irrational hope also 
There is a bullish div on the 12hr and 1d, but it's still an insanely manipulated market so who knows
It could. Depends on how many coins this guy has to dump and at what price they get bought up. I'll be adding to my long at 6.1K if it goes there.
Very unlikely, but anything is possible.
A fall of 630 Billion in Cryptomarketcap from 860 to 230 Billion could qualify.
I think the alt market is lined up for a 2014-2015 bear market... Bitcoin seems to be breaking away from that.

I honestly think that if we break down 5k then 4k won't be good buy.
I’m not angry at all. Had tight stops and barely took a hit to my stack. 

I’m more annoyed every relief rally is just a giant dick tease and bulls can’t break through major resistance points. BTC likes to get your hopes up only to let you down 
I mean there was a lot of sell signal. Alt dumping and BTC already pumped more than 10% , crazy low volume and that fake out to 6k8. Dude, what more do you want? also noticed there were continuous high amount of unconfirmed transactions since yesterday, not a reliable sign, but it's usually resulted in a massive sell off in a bear market.
Short almost any day this year and you'd be making profit....easy said **and** done.
Trading is easier said than done. Wrong place to be if pain is scary and you want guaranteed gains. 
[removed]
No it's not. That 7% move down broke 3 support lines on the way down after bouncing off crucial resistance.

6.4 today isn't the same 6.4 as a week ago. 7% down here isn't the same as other 7% down.
*Elliot waves* could <insert opinion here>.
How is he so fucking good.. :(
The fact that he told that he is sweating when price moving in the opposite direction I would say he is not aware of what he is doing.
I had to come here to find an explanation for that green candle. I thought to myself "I bet thelopoco sold finally!" and my friends all agreed. I'm sure this is all we'll be hearing about in the news for the next few weeks, but it's a big deal. Bitcoin's bull run will now begin.
So if I capitulated the capitulation, does it screw with the bots? :P

Seriously though, I can't quite imagine turning that metric into useful data... but maybe someone's done it.
Can you, uh, sell a little more?
Then you should take a lot of pride in following your plan! Good on you! It's something more people need to do, more often.
that's why I do not trade . day or weekly.
I am now
But this has all been true for many years now, since the price was $300, and much of the mainstream has been aware - these aren't new plans, not new implementations. 

I agree as more people learn and adopt, prices should go up (although adoption itself has not been a completely smooth process, and there are still many roadblocks), but the insane explosion of price has not seemed to match the fundamentals for a long time. 

I mean, I could believe crazy prices in the long term, don't get me wrong, I think Bitcoin is a big deal - I just think the speculative cart is being put before the fundamentals horse. Or at least, I think there's a strong case to be made for that view. 

Of course I'd love to be wrong about this, as I'm a longterm hodler. We'll see.
Please tell me you closed your long

Edit: the dips manufactured???? Some how a BGD on absimal volume is "natural" but a drop with a large expansion of volume is "manufactured". Your logic is flipped dude 
idk the author has been using the same model for a couple months now and so far it’s played out pretty perfectly
I see, thanks.
How would one trade a 6 month contract? Or is this too much for a ELi5? given I've never traded futures, or have any knowledge of them (other than everyone is gambling on the price being above or below a certain price in 5 months?)
Since we just got rejected from 6400 again, im thinking 5k isnt far off.
Oh nvm then. Been lurking for awhile and thought you made the switch to Mex. Was really curious cuz I'm really contemplating switching over to Mex as well. 
Thank you! If you don't mind me asking, what's a good free VPN that you recommend?
Curious- why use a VPN to sign up? - because you potentially live in the US? 
Praise the Lord Vitalik and his creation!
do not know when you refer to ?
Cool... I’m still on the sidelines. Trading 4 hour and waiting for another set of bull divs which is plausible around $6200-$6100 range in a week or so if we find buyer support. 

If this range breaks down I’ll go short ... we haven’t seen any swift capitulation events since the first visit to $5900...
Oh, goodie. Give me a reason to leave it up. Would love to do that.
If you thought 6800 breakout was the only hope why wouldn't you have bought the breakout then?  Why would you YOLO buy literally right at your own resistance level?

None of your bullshit makes any sense whatsoever even following your own horrible TA and retarded logic.
You  thought X, and you think Y. The question is why? What evidence do you have and why is it valid? Why do you believe these numbers hold significance?


The market is not super weak again. change starts on lower time-frames and via price progression moves to larger time-frames. It's an additive process. The bulls made their biggest retracement in this swing and held it for significant time through the prevailing downtrend. Does the break down make that meaningless? 

Think critically over your ideas&beliefs, why do you have faith that TA works in the first place?
I thought it all just went to the insurance fund.... TIL

And damn @ the hundreds of BTC. I've done similar in other markets, your post resonates with me. If you want to remain a degen then do so, just dont become a flat-broke degen, because you tend to stay broke at that point.
Wow, millions of dollars and 100s of BTC... That's a little more brutal than I thought. I visit this sub occasionally and didn't follow your story, but yeah, having so much of a profit just evaporate must be devastating. You are right, there is no advice or kind word that can really change anything in this case :( Damn, freaking millions of dollars...

Now, if you analyze your state of mind and everything retrospectively, why didn't you take partial profit and put it away for life expenses? How did it all happen? If you want to share, of course. Some PA (psychological analysis) can be as useful as TA from time to time.

On the way to 20K literally every trader here and every non-trader in the outside world totally realized and that it was a bubble that had to pop eventually. Everyone in this situation thinks "I will be one of those who will recognize it and gtfo in time", but not everybody makes it. Why? Is it a gambling problem? If yes, maybe this is unwise to try to make it back until the gambling problem is fixed. Was it probably the lack of some kind of outside perspective? You know, when you get so buried in TA, charts and all this trading state of mind, that it becomes difficult to step back and look at the fundamentals. In this case, in the future it may be helpful to have someone by your side who is not involved in crypto or trading, but who is deeply involved in you, whom you trust and with whom you can discuss sensitive financial things. In my case, this outside perspective is what helped me to get out and preserve some of my profits. 
You didn't lose everything like many before they opened their eyes. I know you don't want advice. But just look at this again, think what you did wrong and come back stronger. You still have something to trade with.

I've been through this but I managed to take lessons after 3 months of loses that killed 50% of my stack. Made it back, you can do it also.
Being set for life isn't all that great, you'd just find new problems and get all flabby, keep the personal challenge flowing, whatever you decide it is, laugh in the face of loss, because no pain no gain! Money is no gain when compared to increased mental fortitude.
If it makes you feel any better, there's literally no way you were ever going to be able to exchange all your fake internet money into real money. So really, you had nothing all along, and you're right where you've always been.
I'm rooting you man. I made a little money off some of those bottoms you called on whale pool. I think you are a good trader to have ran up such a roll, at minimum, your natural tendencies perform extremely well in a bull market. If you can master your emotions maybe you can own this bear market too, if not, hopefully you hang on to enough to survive until the next bull.
Fuck, just fuck. Gtfk out and don't look back. It happened. No one died. No one got rich. It's over. Focus on the rest of your life. Keep the 2.3 btc. It's all the gambling you need. Close all accounts that allow leverage.
If that's really true why would you keep trading?  You obviously have no fucking clue what you're doing... 

Idk man, seems hard to believe. Do you have your parents supporting you still or something?  How do your pay rent?

Smells like pure troll bullshit to me.
Big lev is nice but tricky. It is what made you a lot of money in bull run but it is also what got you rekt when it ended.

Try using smaller lev and you'll be fine.
:( I know you're not looking for sympathy, but FWIW, I'm sorry man. :/  Markets are rough.  Very harsh lessons it teaches.
Seek help, you have a serious gambling problem.
You never learn.

You either get help for your mental illness, or you end up homeless. 
Nice comment, bud. Why must there be a purpose to our existence? I've accepted the fact that I won the birth lottery by being born in today's age. Just think about all the horrible times and places you could have been spit out. I know it sounds corny, but it's the truth dude. Be grateful for what you have - Your life is what you want it to be - have fun, don't take shit too seriously, and try and help people occasionally. We all share the same destination - death, but it's not about the destination, it's about the journey. That's where you are now, on a journey. Peace homie.
1. after 7 days, we "dumped" back down to $6,400 that was being defended when I posted that. I'd say that's bullish considering usually we'd be at $5,400 by now. 
2. buy walls that absorb sells are bullish, hidden buy walls are bullish, buy walls that disappear aren't. Similar with the sell wall, you don't put up a road black like that if you actually want those sells to fill. You put up a roadblock like that to make the weak hands sell,  to have bears open shorts("no way its getting through that!)
3. Yes I'm bullish, at this point of time. 



Where is your stop if I may ask?
Goddamn right - thanks brotha. 
Thought you moved to mex, bro?
Lucky number 7 :/

Sorry, dude. Doesn't seem worse than manually panic buying the top or panic selling the bottom though, which we've all done, I'm sure.
I'll think of something!
Yea, and crypto and this new gambling game has truly surpassed anything else crypto was going to become and effectively stopped or slowed any other progress towards those other new things. That's why the bear market isn't going to let up for quite a while imho.

Ah right, I misunderstood how you meant it. 

I wouldn't be surprised to fall back to that line assuming we follow the same bubble pattern of 2014. Would be shitty though to have to wait multiple years for another ath... time will tell. 
Haha I see what you did there, that deserves an up vote!
Do you think its possible for BTC to be $1M? 
Im still waiting for this to go back in the 7000 range hopefully but I definitely don't believe 5755 was the bottom but I am not a megabear either who thinks this is going to 2k
Damn it! Pinky promise I didn't see your post ;) 

Edit - I see our Ideas were very similar w/ breakout above $6850 :) 
This is what I'm looking at...

EDIT: I guess that would mean hidden bull div (Higher low price, lower low for RSI).  I just wasn't sure if what I'm doing is valid.
From my experience, these channels are far from meaningless.
This one in April, maybe?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/GwmzpVG0/

The 2 shoulders are almost equal, however the neckline and head look not really nice. But the price target was pretty correct  (8273 -6610) + 8273 = 9936
July 2017 was one I’ll never forget

https://www.tradingview.com/x/CIefwGoY/


I don't think so. The psychology is different because the singular head is supposed to signify a push. Retesting that area twice over a significant time period is not the same thing, imo. 
[https://www.tradingview.com/x/9BsheTVm/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/9BsheTVm/)
that's odd- I've seen elsewhere that volume should be highest in right shoulder too. 

I think TPS is the only site that says the opposite.

Remember h&s has highest volume in left shoulder on the advance (the very, very left)...guess where *inverse* should have it? the inverse...:P  as in, the very, very right. The expanse of the right  shoulder.

Peter Brandt has said this before too 

Keep in mind head & shoulders are awful with btc and you can actually counter trade them incredibly successfully. 

Massive ih&s from $12k to $6k with shoulders at $9k completely failed and now we're here. That is, you could've traded on it wirh an inverse downwards target and been right on the money.

h&s on April bottom and then explosive move upwards.

Now we have ih&s...guess where it goes? lol 
this guy gets it, it should show the bears at their strongest on the first push down, then weaker with each push, im still not sure what to call each shoulder since they are inversed, but selling volume should be decreasing on each dip
Doesn't change the fact that there isn't a head on the chart. There are two touches at 5800, separated by a bounce up to 6300. Not sure how you can call that a head. 
I have a natural scepticism of non-objective chart patterns. Some people see a H & S everywhere, but my personal criteria are different and I hardly see them. Analysis/backtesting of them is then (to be charitable) difficult or (to be truthful) impossible. Furthermore, if the sample size is very low (or one!) then whatever can be inferred may simply be conincidental.
Not esoteric. Bullshit.
It's not that I dislike the idea. If you posted some of the material you describe, people would be happy to read it. However, I think there are three main points to consider:

* Feasibility: How can you do a quant analysis of sentiment? You'd need to access and structure a lot of data, most of which is in foreign languages that aren't easy to learn (japanese, korean). You need to build a model that outputs more than just a [sentiment score](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/). How would you conduct this type of analysis and what does the result look like?

* Usability: Imagine you get a perfect livestream of worldwide sentiment in high resolution. How do you act on it? It doesn't give you clear trade signals, quite the opposite, it will be as noisy as the price feed. Then you apply filters and it's still ambivalent. Next you resort to stuff like moving averages to get high-level binary signals from the noise. And then you've invented TA 2.0.

* Primacy of the price: Any news event or sentiment shift that happens anywhere will be reflected in the charts. Price action is an all-encompassing indicator of everything that makes people put money at stake. When there's a big news event, the charts will tell you about it before the first article is published. Why even put in the effort to build a model for astrology influences on korean traders (or whatever) while it's all in the charts anyways.
> You didn't know that?

No I did not.

And I had heard about the FBI using psychics... but that idea has been completely debunked as worthless: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychic_detective#Scientific_studies

Betting on human's interpretation of the stars and what they think that they mean however... I could see there being real merit to that as an investment tool.
Not OP, but I do think it's funny how *any* mention of a conventional H&S is instant downvoted in here--during a bear market, no less--but the prayers to Satoshi for an inverse H&S are upvoted. Even though I definitely agree H&S are overidentified/memed to death

It is lacking a shoulder
No, what I meant was all those drops from 10k had a low-to-high range within 10%, this had almost 20%.
Sounds spooky.
Seems like people end up there as they get into more advanced trading practices. I mostly hodl and use binance but maybe I’ll check it out for fun.
BitMEX haven't lost tens of millions in customer funds like Bitfinex, and also they do not require DNA sample to trade with KYC bullshit.  They are about the only realistic alternative at this point.
\*capitulation
TA. Many possible reasons.
creator bailed on them, not much hope for the community, and frankly other alts like IOTA or Nano can do what LTC can do, much better.
Can you name something that they've been working on in the last 6 months that they are doing better than anyone else? 

In the top 20 coins, they are contributing the least in terms of new ideas/leadership. 
LTC is very important for BTC even if maximalist won't admit it.

Hadn't LTC activated Sewgit first, who knows what the state of BTC would be today.

The same will happen with Schorr signatures, confidential tx and MAST. LTC will adopt them first and act as a test field.

BTC also needs atomic swaps with LTC over the LN to survive. Time will prove this
25x leverage and went to sleep is what got me. 
It doesn't make it *not* a gamble, but I do think it makes it *less* of a gamble. Even using things as simple as RSI overbought/oversold measures are extremely useful for picking possible entry/exit points.
hah that's awwesome 
A grown man without a hooker budget?
You've been totally humble and open about your underwater position for the last week, the criticism is unwarranted.

Btw, grats on adding to it at the top and saving it and it all working out.
See, i'm always right.
So On September Open Value is in BTC which is currently 13.8K, Open Interest is $ since it's amount of contracts, and it's currently 88,114,976. I think that's where we got confused.

So Open Value of perps is indeed 95K and open interest 610,423,254. 

We're just mixing up our contracts/BTC. 
I feel up, think down. I'm not trading this.

Damn, i got a new argument closer from now on. I'll be adding this to the end of my comments whenever someone tries to argue with me. 

You can literally add this to any comment in this sub and make it sound more intellectual.
My competing argument: nothing is certain, saying something like, "bla bla bla, this means we will dump really hard and barely correct between dumps", isn't much of a valid argument. Sure it might dump the way he predicted it but the way he described it made it sound like it is now bound to happen.

Edit: nothing personal to him btw.
it's not one whale doing it and they arent random
That's what I'm keeping in mind. Seems illogical to put up such a bearish sell wall publically, as this would only make unloading that much more difficult. I'm thinking shenanigans. 
How is this sell wall spoofy?
He's probably signing in on the computers at his public library, even.. Dude is basically homeless with only $27mm to his name 
Well volume speaks volumes, on coinbasepro 24hr volume went from 2.7k to 3.7k with that last "rally" where with this drop we are close to 8.5k now (and climbing).

Anybody with enough coins can paint a graph, but they can't fake volume

Edit: look volume confirms trends people, the same people questioning this are the same people who ignored it when we were hovering around 6700

Edit2: [some very basic info about volume and trends](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volume-analysis.asp)

Edit3:downvotes don't make it any less wrong 😎
You'd make way more money than most people here do 
A $200 pump on low volume is bullish, but a $450 dump in little under a day after being rejected at resistance on increasing volume is EXTRA bullish 
My plan is to work hard and save some more money, dump it into bitcoin this year at a lower price (I'm pretty sure it will come), and then barely trade until the market stops looking like shit. Maybe around 2020, after interest has died down (even more), hopefully some ETF advancements, LN adoption, and halving. 

I don't think I'm the exception to whatever "rule" you're talking about, I just know that this is now a longer-term game, as opposed to how i felt when i first got into crypto halfway through 2017. My goals haven't changed, the timeframe has though.
Done this twice...
This is a good one 
Yes, 35% fee on every profitable trade. 
Wow. That really sucks, I can't imagine anyone would be able to consistently turn a post-tax profit with those taxes.

Depending on where you live, maybe you could incorporate a company in a low or zero tax jurisdiction to make your trades, and take your net profits as dividends. Obviously you would need professional advice first.
Wait, seriously? That sounds insane. 

So if you make $1mil and then lose it all, you have to pay approx $350k in taxes? That can't be true. 
Saying 35% tax without saying the relevant country is disingenuous.
Come to Lithuania and save yourself, we have good vodka, good women, many saunas
Not a bad theory.
Traders lose interest (gamblers kick their addiction), any minute now...tick tock. 
I was expecting 4k ever since we went to 5.7k. That's the price target for the huge descending triangle. I'm not so sure anymore. Sellers seem to have a hard time getting it down further. We could still see 4k but, to me, it is looking less likely. I've lost money trading this so I'm just DCA'ing atm.
If this gets turned around again here though, I'd imagine the sentiment might give the uptrend yet more confidence. 

Not that that's terribly likely. But we're sitting at the bottom of the 12 hr BBands (wicked it) and outside the 6 hr ones. If the next daily kicks off with a bounce we'll have a bull div on the hourly while simultaneously having invalidated the bear flag on low time frames (would have to wait for more 6 hour+ candles to form a larger one). We'll also have held horizontal support in this range in the face of a decent size bear flag trying to break down.

This is all certainly an exercise in searching for hopium, but I don't think the bulls in this trend are dead quite yet. Think Leo in The Revenant style haha.
^ This guy gets it...
Can I ask you what are your targets again? I'm short and bearish too btw, although waiting for this support to break more convincingly to not worry too much of a bounce back.
Not super sure of a dump personally at this moment..! Even though I'm hoping for one since I'm short. 6300 is a strong support line and in my opinion we need to break it with conviction and have some confirmation. Also like you said it looks like this dump already needs a cool down, RSI is pretty oversold right now, so even though to me it does look like it's going down I'm still watching closely for signs of sudden recover.
Agreed. The sudden bullish sentiment seemed to be getting ahead of what what actually happening with price (and more importantly, volume). People focusing on the indicators that made them feel hopeful and ignoring the ones that didn't.

Imo in the grand scheme of things 6xxx still seems like a crazy high price - have the Bitcoin fundamentals *really* changed in the last two years to justify a 1000% rise? I think people who only got into Bitcoin last year lack a lot of perspective. I remember when $100 was an insane price, and honestly the technology has not changed dramatically since then - if anything increased adoption has highlighted the challenges ahead. I'm bullish long-term (5+ years), but people need to realize 1k is in no way an unreasonably low price. 
I think 3K is definitely possible, but 1.4K.. Oh man, that's gonna take some FUD so big that it's almost imaginary
Definitely true. 

Although confidence is a spectrum - sometimes I feel at least SOME confidence where things are heading (and it pans out more often than not). Now is pretty much a 0-1% confidence level. 
Valhalla awaits!
Come on, move 20% to 5800, let this winner run... this is what you're asking us for permission to do, isn't it?
[deleted]
It would be buying the resistance. Similar to buying at 11.7k in March or 10k in May, or selling at 5.9k. It would make more sense to buy now, or at 6.55k or after we cross 6800.
/facepalm

Trends are only there in hindsight.
Very subjective, relative, personal impression unfortunately. One man's 5800 is another man's 10,000.
Which assets are you referring to?
Zoom out.
On what the 1m charts?
One lead to a nice rally, but yeah then it kept dropping.  
...Or it doesn't. Anything can happen.

All things change.
Hey bro I'd only like to end up with more BTC than you.

I'll buy them at a discount in a few - several months. I feel you may discount the type of discount I will get, though it bears no effect on mine profits.
Is that what the charts have been telling you?
The 10th grade english in me is wondering if you mean A. there's an escrow service that accepts wagering testicles or B. they have an escrow service they're willing to make a ballsy wager on. 

I'm conflicted.
Augur prediction market just went live, you guys should use that
I think he’s asking for a chart that shows the trendline you were talking about.
Breaks at $4300

... and if you start plotting the lows from June 2015 (which I prefer), it will even be lower.
Until it isn't.
I hope you guys are right and i am wrong
Got it.. Thx
The market is so funny, looks like it would have almost doubled his stack if actually did it.
You're right in that the system has memory (us, the market participants), so I guess we should treat it more like a pseudo-gamblers fallacy. The market moves in a pseudo-random direction, if it didn't we'd all be billionaires. You can factor in previous movements to try to calculate the odds of it moving in a certain direction, but they are still probabilities, not certainties. Furthermore, even if you calculate an 80% probability of it moving a certain way, that would assume your model is perfect, and I guarantee it is not, so your 80% is more likely a range between 70-90%. 

Edit: There's a reason why most TA patterns have a success rate close to 50%.
Thank you !
Thanks, I appreciate it
Not sure why your being downvoted he's right. And a lot of money that came in seemed to have come in at the top. I didn't think we'd get past 10K and I think the way we started moving upwards it was just bound to happen. I think what people are trying to figure out now is the fundamentals of bitcoin/blockchains as I think a lot of people who got involved actually know very little about the tech and it takes a long time of different areas of study to get a grasp on how bitcoin can change the world. A big problem is that speculation has outgrown the people who know the tech and a lot of people in BTC may be technically sound but they may not understand some potential issues with disrupting a larger economic model and think it's an easy bet when in reality it's a really hard problem to resolve. It's not that a lot of people are not trying to fix it, it's that no one really knows what to do because historically the gold standard has not worked and neither has inflation (but it definitely has a use case). 

I think one of the problem at the moment is we may be suffering with the grass is greener on the deflation side of things but the motives behind this logic may just be for a lot of people I want to get rich so I'll only look for the positives. Not saying people are intentionally doing it but it's certainly easier to believe an idea if it has the possibility of making you rich. A lot of people in this space seem to think they are economic geniuses but most of the LTHs were mostly lucky(I know I was even though I had a good understanding of the tech) and despite what people still say Silk Road was one of the best things to happen to BTC and is really the sort of thing that bitcoin was designed for, at least at the core protocol level. Not necessarily to buy drugs but to avoid regulation and censorship at a base level as we move into a digital age for money/value transfer.
Sideways sounds about right to me. I can't claim to know if the bottom is in or not. This is a great time to DCA into a position with cash.
Yeah, not confident about any position right now. I can't think of a better scenario to start building a position, though. Uncertainty eventually leads to excellent prices.
How could you possibly say that BTC is breaking away from a bear market? Do you have any evidence for this?

My evidence for a bear market is the price continues to go down, and does not hold levels in the face of any heavy selling.
What way do you see it breaking away?
Except there is no Mtgox/China scenario. 
Come on bro, that's just being biased or a "it's different this time" attitude. You were here in 2014, you've been through this before. History isn't repeating exactly, but it *is* rhyming. It's a bubble popping and unwinding.
Rule 3 applies.

You've got one hella reach if you know what the majority of traders are doing. Good luck, though. You might just be right. I am on the opposite side, so either one of us is going to lose. Lets see how it goes!
Imo it's misleading / simplistic to state "if people are long, short is good" and imply it's possible to truly accurately measure sentiment. It may work for you, but without more information about the methods used, it amounts to just boasting of your prowess. Imo. 
You can't gauge market sentiment by reading comments, articles, tweets, etc. on the internet. You can only trick yourself into thinking you can. 
Annoyance is just low key anger, bro.
Tbh i expected the relief rally to reach at least $7500 and possibly $8500. I thought i got rekt by taking some profits from $6190-$6200ish at $6500+ a few days before the pump to $6800. 

Sold most at $6,600 a few hours ago and again at $6,580. Then my final sell was at $6546. I thought i got rekt because the last 2 digits was 70 after i refreshed the page lol then i double checked that it was $6470 instead of $6570.

My reason for selling is a bit noobish though. I cant really do TA so all I do is check the previous dump's time and the similarity by counting the candle sticks lol. Price lasted 10ish candlesticks in the 1 day chart in the 6700 then dumped at the same time the current dump was starting which is the same number of candlesticks today. So i thought, hey this whale might be pulling the same shit again.

Sold 64.5% of the BTC i bought at $6200 so far. I might follow this method since im shit at TA.

> Had tight stops and barely took a hit to my stack. 

Looks like your order is still open on the bot btw.
Ah that sucks to hear. My orders just got filled on some slippage, but I also put a tight b/e stop on it because eth is really rolling over, and I expect BTC to follow suit. 

:( troubling times in the crypto kingdom. 

!long BTCEUR 5456 add 1x 15%
It doesn't dramatically change our position, though. The reaction we're seeing in sentiment is overblown.

The price went up too fast and the market corrected. We should have been going sideways or down and we went up quickly instead. So, we correct .

From bullish to neutral. No big deal.

Yes, that's exactly the point I was making.
Oh, I’m not aware to the story. If that is the case it is indeed a gambling ~~problem~~ strategy that I admire 

Edit: I now know the story and as an hardcore gambler myself i know that to make it big you need to take the risks. 
they both appear manufactured to me. 
You trade it like any other contract. Expiration only means that you cannot hold the contract past its settlement date. Before that, you can buy/sell them as often as you like. You don't need to hold them for a certain amount of time or anything like that.
I too, rock Kraken no plans to switch to mex. Your username is great - what's the story?
I don't use a free one. I use private internet access. it's like $6/month 

Honestly if you can't afford it then you shouldn't be trading on mex 😋 

But yeah there are free VPNs out there. if you trust me enough you can have me sign up for you and hand the account over to you if you want. Could change password and everything after. But I'm sure thats  feel weird.

He's hooked on gambling. The "TA" just allows him to justify it.
Not sure what you mean, how would I not have been able to exchange it?
really not hard to believe for me...if I had made a few huge wins when I started I could easily be walking around with way more btc and have terrible trading/gambling habits 
Thanks dude. Yes, in the end the result will be the same; we will all end up in the same coffin, whether poor or rich. It is indeed about the journey and we are lucky to be alive now, just like all of us here. The fact our worst worry is whether bitcoin goes up or down is a blessing in itself. Good luck to you as well!
Somewhere above 6.4, but it's a hedge only from above 6.5.
:)

Seems like just posting this did a lot of the work.

Keep an eye on the place for me.
I was going to but I’ll just stick with Kraken for now.

Don’t really have the time to learn an entirely new U.I, and I generally trade from mobile only and Kraken is pretty easy to navigate through. 5X leverage is plenty for me now, since I’ve increased my BTC stack to a comfortable spot where i dont really need anything higher than 5x
I panic sold my entire holdings at $5800 in February and took a $3500ish dollar hit. *hashtag* never forget. 

Getting screwed on this stop could easily trigger a revenge trade. But I’m going to stay level headed and humble and retire my trading account for a week. 
Guys like these are just asking for another bart.
yeh... from their own definition of leading indicator, i don't think they understand what RSI is

"A leading indicator is a **measurable economic factor** that changes before the economy starts to follow a particular pattern or trend. Leading indicators are used to predict changes in the economy, but they are not always accurate. **Bond yields** are a good leading indicator of the market, because investors can use them to anticipate and speculate on trends in the economy."

RSI is not an economic indicator that will affect the price of bitcoin fundamentally, it measure "momentum" over past price action. It is not a leading indicator just because it has predictive power over price - all indicators have this property.

EDIT - [their definition of leading indicator](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leadingindicator.asp)
Just hope that you don't get it in a corner on your randomly-arranged card!
Yes of course it's possible.  It is not 0% probability...close to that, but not 0%, which is the definition of impossible.
that is indeed a hidden bullish divergence
Maybe, I would be interested if there is a study on patterns that are 'close enough.'

But, you got any examples in btc? 
Not bad. Right shoulder looks like a c&h a bit to add to the bullish formations! 
Declining volume across a pattern biases the pattern towards a breakdown, not a break out. A traditional H&S benefits from this bias, an inverted one would be hindered to some degree by the same declining volume.
Actually there is a patten called "Complex IHS" which contain 2 heads, but I think if we only count Closed price, the head is right at 5848.1, others are just wicked.
What's a non-objective chart pattern to you?
Maybe most mentions get downvoted because the pattern is on the 5m, volume doesn't check out, or it isn't recognizable at all. As you say, it *is* the top overidentified pattern.
I see, yes that is correct +18% and explains why it looked different this time.

Um. The "creator who bailed on them"  is one of the guys who works for the LTC foundation and he's one of the people who made this announcement.
Yeah this is factually incorrect. The creator sold the ultimate pump to disassociate his financial incentive for litecoin to succeed from his pursuit of litecoin's success and growth. It backfired to an extent as a lot of disinformation is out there about how it went down. Charlie Lee has been and continues to be one of the most transparent founders out there and he has a lot of insight into the market place. Had all of us done what Charlie did and sold during that pump (that occurred not only for litecoin but most of crypto), then most of us would be a lot better positioned now than we are. He specifically warned LTC holders that the chances of the coin falling back in value drastically, was very realistic. Some people took that as FUD, I'd say it was a good founder trying to express the realistic constraints of price movement and warn others not to FOMO in and consider the risks of doing so. 
Wrong. The creator sold his entire stack so there won’t be a conflict of interest and to keep it decentralized and unscammy like the shitcoins you mentioned, he’s working harder than ever on LTC and BTC as well
- creator bailed, no, creator just cut this deal

- IOTA = ROFLCOPTER




I thought that a lot of the litecoin developers work alongside the bitcoin developers in hopes to progress the entirety of crypto. Is that incorrect info? 
Once Charlie cuts and pastes some more btc features into it like he did with segwit he’ll get on that tweeter of his and try and pump it. Basically all that thing is good for. 
Bitcoin Core added the SegWit cancer first, Litecoin followed
That's what everyone says about their favorite indicator
We seem to be at a point where a lot of people reading this forum again just expecting hopium all the time and beat on TA because bitcoin fundamentals are so strong it seems?

Bitcoins fundamentals are strong but I don't think they are quite strong enough to over-ride fear and greed. Using TA just makes it more analogous to playing poker as opposed to flipping a coin. All TA is just stats to gain an edge and risk management to make you profitable over time, and not over any one call or analysis. I don't understand why people who come here beat on TA so much, no ones claiming it's going to predict what's going to happen it just gives you a better guess. Sure FA is great but that's more for long term speculation.

Thank you sir! I smoked a good cig and drank a good beer after that pump to 67xx that day lolol. I think my avg entry was around 65xx at that time

Anyways thanks!!

Im talking about perpetual swaps, there's 95k btc in open interest rn. A few weeks ago it was as low as like 75k. a 20+% increase in open interest is huge for essentially going sideways! That's how we made the April BGD

Why did you say "that's not right" though? the open interest *is* 95k o_O 
I agree that it's totally unpredictable at this point.

You bring a good point here, saying "its product of my long observation of this market" is somehow misleading since it can apply to anyone about anything, I think I poorly worded this comment, but in my first comment I am confident that I stated exactly why I think this would happen.

anyways, we vote by taking a position, I took my position a few days ago, so it doesn't really matter what is going to be said here.
my entire comment is an argument about why that might happen.
Did somebody say shenanigans? 
A barking dog never bites
He isn’t saying it’s spoofy, he’s saying IF it is, there’s no resistance. But that’s unlikely. 
Really? Isn't volume just buying and selling. If you sell to yourself volume goes up. Risky but possible. 
Volume always goes up on breaks.
Saying  "Good, its the only way we'll see ath again." as a response to that comment implies you won't lose interest in crypto, and while 99&#37; of the population will think Bitcoins is dead you will be that 1&#37; or you will think the same and even like that you will still fight for your goals despite your beliefs. 

The previous most likely won't happen, specially considering you came after the price began to increase (I'm talking about odds here, nothing personal). And I can relate to this, because I thought I was an exception during the bear market of 2014 too, turned out that I wasn't. I learned from my mistakes though :)
question is, are you ready to go for 2k levels.  many people will throw in towel if we bleed our way there. 
Don't forget.  Gov't regulation is "Good for Bitcoin". 

They are killing it and f*cking the traders investors deep up the a$$ and many still deny it.
And ignoring the judicious use of margin is equally as bad. With the various lending sources available today, getting STCG on your stack is just foolish.
I don't think it's dead yet- it's just if it continues to go down here I will be surprised at the strength of the move down. 

I'm like...30% expecting a recovery to $6800. 40% to $6600 

I am actually really just surprised at how quickly we moved down.. was not expecting $62xx yet 
I could be totally off - my targets for lower lows have been delayed by months now lol. So maybe it does rally after this.

But this does look bearish to me- more bearish than most people here seem to think. A relief/disbelief really does not begin with lower lows- it looks like April where it just goes straight up while people refuse to sell "low". 

Targets are $4.5k-5.5k.

I'm primarily looking for a capitulation wick though. Then we will see a month long relief rally with anywhere from 20-50% gains. 
Well, I might need to reconsider. At the moment, my gut says this will dump straight to 5k, but need to verify with the folks over here.
Haha, brilliant.  Downvoters be damned, this man is right.
I'd be convinced of an iH&S if we go up from here to retest 6800. I'd long a breakout from that neckline.
Enjoy your bliss.
We are literally under 6400 at this moment. As I am typing this comment. 

???
On the everything charts lol lower low isn't time specific 
Yeah, but that could be said in response to literally any post in this sub. Not very productive. 
The condescending arrogance, I love it. Keep it coming.
You won't buy them at much of a discount under the current price. 6K was the bottom.

Lots of time to find out.

I think the CC market as a whole is lined up for what you are seeing. Less sure about Bitcoin doing the same. I think we're waiting on a major decoupling before moving up.
His evidence is probably BTC dominance being up a couple of percent over the past few months. Whilst leaving out that it was 90% not that long ago.
Regulation, securities, and the fact that the market is pumped full of worthless projects that are way overvalued. It's primed for a sort of bank run. Alts down vs bitcoin by 20 - 30% month over month doesn't inspire that market with hope.
you can long perpetual contract and hedge it by shorting the sept or dec contract. Each has its way of doing things, stick to what works.

Haha thanks! Wish I had a cool story to tell you. Just went with reddit recommended username cuz I thought it was cool and different. How do you like Kraken? I heard it has very high fees and UI is kinda bad, which is why I kinda stayed away from it.
Haha good point! It's not cuz of $6/month lol. It's just that if VPN is only needed for initial signup, I would rather not pay if I don't have to. and thanks for the offer!

Definitely not trigger buys.

Your comment got linked on /r/buttcoin, and calling bitcoin imaginary fake money is their own coping mechanism.
Thanks brotha - be well and enjoy the ride.
But BTC only hit $5900 back then, no?
Yeah revenge trading is almost always foolish. Patience is key. Trading is a marathon and there's little reason to jump the gun.
I don't see this quote above! not sure we are reading the same page.

Cool, thanks.  Now to figure out what to do with that.
No, I'm just going by the description on Bulkowski's website. I don't have an anecdote either way and I'm not sure that one or two examples would be all that exculpatory either way. Still, I don't think that looks at all like or signifies the same thing as a head. It's also nowhere near the neckline, so I don't know why people are losing their shit over this. 
Here is just about a textbook example on NEO/BTC this winter but a h&s top, highest buying volume on the first shoulder as bulls are in control, then lower volume on the head and even lower on the right shoulder, then breakdown

https://www.tradingview.com/x/xnFzbMQi/

inverse would be the opposite of this
They're not wicks on anything less than 1d candles. Plus it was more rounded the second time around. Definitely doesn't look like a head to me, but to each their own.
Anything that can't be quantified and backtested. For example a moving average cross can be quantified - it is objective. H & S is subject to the discretion of the trader
For reals. I don’t think I’m cut out for day trading and especially not margin trading but it would be fun to see what you’re all on about 😀
He works for them but has sold all his LTC, I don't consider that a comforting factor.
why would selling all of his LTC be a good thing? do you even know what a conflict of interest is (for example a CEO owning shares of the company he runs is not a "conflict of interest" it is an "alignment of interest").

do you guys just parrot all the dumb shit these conmen say to you? 
uhhhh what? you do realize that Nano is decentralized right? And faster / cheaper than LTC 

It's more or less used as a testnet when things like Lightning were rolled out. Hardly a reason that I would put any $$ into Litecoin myself. 

I'm not really sure on the reason that someone would put $$ into Litecoin over Bitcoin aside from the ability to own more whole coins. 

I might be missing something, but I checkin on the Litecoin project once a month or so and that's my understanding so far. 
What incentive does he have to pump it? My understanding is that he sold all of his holdings right at the peak. 
Oh pal, you came to the wrong neighborhood with your “Bitcoin core” nonsense 

And if we are talking about cancer: Roger Ver and all of you dick sucking cultists are the very definition of cancer 
Litecoin activated segwit on May 2017, BTC on late August.

I don't understand why you post on a BTC sub or trade BTC when there's already a thriving BCH community waiting for you.
Sure. If it increases your odds of placing a more favorable entry, it is technically speaking less of a gamble.
You’re *like* 23?
You are right on all counts, I just got confused because you said Open Interest which is measured in $ and Open Value in BTC. It's like we're talking Celsius and Fahrenheit.

Woah there, I didnt mean to offend. The above statement is just a product of my long observation of this market.
I understand I'm not saying your predictions are baseless but the way it was worded sounded ultra bearish and that it was 100&#37; certain to happen.
Hey ROD! What's that place with the goofy $hit all over the walls?
:D
Ha! That made me laugh cause I’m sure that’s not true :)
Wait... wut?
That's called wash trading 
Fair point i guess i don't really know how i'm going to react to a multi-year long bleed. I'm more saying that we'd have to have some pretty dooming developments to convince me that bitcoin is gone for good. I might forget and lose interest, but i still am as certain as possible that we haven't seen the end, and i can wait a few years to see it :)
Man the thought of bitcoin at 2k is giving me a semi. Unless something really bad happens that would signify the end of bitcoin which is very unlikely imo, I would be spending as much money as such a low price.
Bollinger bands on the monthly looks like we could potentially bounce off the middle band at 5500 while still maintaining a long term uptrend. That's where I'm buying, after that, I'm going on vacation lol
Ah, fair enough. Pretty much agree.

Part of me thinks we're at least going to flag on the 12 hr/daily here for a bit. Before continuing to break down. Part of me thinks the bulls will gain enough confidence by a lower low here to make a higher high.
Thanks! Haha I know you've been considered some kind of permabear here for a while but I pretty much agree with you (for what it's worth, I'm far from an expert), it's way more reasonable to me than most of the attempts to predict The Reversal. Time will tell!
Enjoy your losses.
After being at 5800
How could it not be?
It can be said in response to any comment that has no substance. I'm responding to someone who thinks that the price will continue to go down because the price has gone down.

Imagining random scenarios does nothing to support the validity of the fear mongering.
I'll buy at half this price $6382 on GDAX.
Thug Lyfe 
I’m not saying there is hope because there is none but what I’m saying is 2014 was 2014, it’s not gonna repeat, we’re making a new history as we speak
Indeed.
Lol please explain to me how you're modeling sentiment by reading comments from random accounts on reddit. You realize a bunch of accounts here and elsewhere are fake, right?

Don't fool yourself.
Works fine because of Fundamentals. Not sentiment 
I was all closed up by stops at the same 6580 overnight.  The losses from the newest position washed the final closing profits from the older position.  

But then I reopened foolishly before leaving to work this morning, thinking maybe it had run out of steam.  Underwater now, gonna have to watch this horizontal support closely, looking like it'll break.

I got stopped out already at BE.

Not looking to add just yet as some others, primarily eth, are taking a hit.

I think this swing low will continue a bit more. If we stay above 6300 for 8-12 hours I might take another position. Right now it's a bit too risky for me. 
I don't know why it's more likely going down from what you wrote. It doesn't automatically follow for me that breaking down some support means that we're going to break down through all remaining horizontal support levels. It just looks to me like R/R changed in favor of bears a little and that bullish patterns are still valid.
well he should be liquidated now 
I don't like trigger buys.

But it's not when he entered, it's when he exited. He could enter at over 6.8 but he should cut loses at most at 6550 break down.
again try open a position on bitmex, what /u/v4mpyre said

You're right that we're upset, but it's not because we "missed out" on Bitcoin, far from it. We're upset because we see people being swindled out of their life savings by getting into this scam. We're upset because we see valuable resources being diverted from productive ventures into the slow, inefficient, and wasteful blockchain. We're upset because all the bitcoin shills on these subreddits are willfully misleading themselves and others.
If it was real money, then how come he doesn't have any of it?

BTW the only thing I'm "coping" with is not being a gambling idiot who just lost "millions" ;)
Why are we coping? We aren't the ones losing our life savings on stupid internet tokens.

Yes quantum computers can f*ck everything up really quickly.  Hopefully we have a few more years, but they could already have one for all we know.
Please anyone correct me if I am (partly) wrong or add to it.

Hidden divergence is a continuation pattern, so a hidden bullish divergence counts in a bullish trend. A regular bullish divergence can be the start of a trend reversal.

Plus what confuses me is that your indicator probably uses close as a source while on the green candle you take the open price and a the left at the right it is the closing price.
Because hopium dude. 
That doesn't change the fact (or fact according to Bulkowski) that declining volume biases towards a break down rather than a break up. This, imo, changes the equation or probabilities for iH&S versus a normal H&S. 
I don't do bitmex because I have enough anxiety from the risk of doing 5x on kraken. I see their limits as a feature not a bug.
So you're saying that the valuation of a coin and how much someone holds determines how much:  


1) they care about the project  
2) they're involved in it  


I can see where the idea of "he sold all his coins so he's ditching them" comes from, but maybe a different perspective could be: "he maxed out the $ he could get out of his coins but he's still very much involved in the project"
He sold his LTC, because he's not a total moron.
exactly. LTC that foundation holds is not Charlie's personal portfolio 

Hilarious that people think that a founder holding coins/tokens is a conflict of interest. It was just Charlie's lame excuse for wisely dumping his clone coin near its ATH. 
I don’t care about Nano, i just answered your retarded claim that Charlie bailed LTC. 
My reasoning behind trading in and out of LTC;

Known coin that has been established within the top 10 for quite a while and has maintained its spot consistently. 

I believe in the founder of LTC and respect a lot of what he says about crypto overall and think that he will be one of the few within the crypto community who will be a long term presence trying to boost the community as a whole and grow LTC.

As far as a speculative currency, there is the appeal of owning more than a partial coin obviously. I would also consider LTC a "stable" speculative currency. It more or less moves with BTC but on the downside and upside, it tends to outpace in % gains or % loss from a day to day stand point. So to an extent, higher risk/reward without totally exposing myself to the nasty falls that occur on a fairly regular basis for the smaller alt coins. 

Valuation seems reasonable to me whereas a lot of alts at this point are glaringly expensive and have no foundation for their valuation or market cap. 

Liquidity is also key for me. The volume in crypto has significantly declined and I want to participate in trading where funds are readily able to be liquidated without delay. 
buy back lower before pumping it back up?
Absolutely not: the Bitcoin Core implementation added the SegWit cancer, causing the split of the chain. SegWit breaks the chain of cryptographic signatures which defines Bitcoin as per the 2008 whitepaper
Why implement such a significant change to a currency which was valued in the billions? Because it was necessary for Blockstream's Lightning Network to function, a centralized bullshit payment system which goes against anything the original Bitcoin stands for. Read the first sentence of the Bitcoin whitepaper:

*A  purely  peer-to-peer  version  of  electronic  cash  would  allow  online payments  to  be  sent  directly  from  one  party  to  another  without  going  through  a financial  institution.*
My birthday is near. Wont you greet me advanced happy birthday?
u/hotsoccerman is right, you are correct to an extent in your points, but the tone is off and I think that is the downvote brigade. Just like Sloppy may be better than some of the company he keeps, so are you in your phrasing. 

No need to have everyone fuck out of here, I just think some couples counseling is in order. I can help with that, I must be better with that than trading. 

edit: two words.
Be honest with yourself - you do care to a certain extent, and that's OK! I care too and I'm not even involved. You're a justice warrior, fam and if you continue on that path, you have to accept that most people are going to disagree with you, and some will even go out of their way to fuck with you. I'm a principled individual myself, but it took many years for those principles to develop and I still don't stick to them 100%. Also, try and remember that many of the people here are legit kids who have neither fully formed brains nor as much life experience as you or me.
[removed]
no offense taken, The above statement is just a product of my long observation of this market :D
"...and probably we will barely correct..."
Do you see the irony of that statement...you'd like to buy $2k Bitcoin...but believe that would signify the end of Bitcoin...in which case why would you be buying it at $2k?
$5500 was my old target but it's so close to $5750 that idk if it's going to be a great target anymore 
Could definitely still do that- my comment is kind of invalidated now tbh I was mainly surprised we moved down so quickly to $62xx. I should've waited to see if we'd stay down there. If anything a move to $62xx should've been perceived as over exuberant. $62xx within the next day would mean I'm expecting the big move soon- otherwise, yeah, I expect some more drifting upwards again 
I don't mind them. They're part of the game. No such thing as a 100% win rate in the markets.
So after the 6k wick in february we were never in a downtrend until going sub 6k? What on earth are you talking about? We just set a lower low for the first time since the 5750 bounce. Please dont respond to me with nonsense, i see through the jabberwocky.
because it doesn't matter if it hit $6350 in a year or in a day, it's a lower low when you consider the uptrend. 

the uptrend isn't time specific, it's related to how far the price retraces while moving upwards. April never retraced as much as we have now after the breakout
Fair enough. 
For sure.

I think I disagree with the interpretation you gave to OP. I read his comment as a simile, not as a perfect metaphor. They are similar, but they are not the same. I think it goes without saying that they are not the same. But saying that they're similar, and then defining the ways that they similar, that's more interesting.
Not reddit. Overall market sentiment, example; long/short future contracts ratio  and more.......
combination of both I'd say, but sure fundamentals are the main driver
You’re just a position maniac. It seems like you always have an amazing entry then mess it up by raising you’re CA at prices that are way to high or low. 

Any particular reason you continuously just kept adding to your long when the price went higher? 
!long BTCEUR 5456 close 1x 15%
I'm not saying it will, I'm saying is more likely. For me bullish pattern isn't valid. We broke every up trend line from 5.7 low. I'd say it will go lower before any attempt on going higher. 6.4 has turned resistance.

But. Right now I'm only hedged from above 6.5. right now it's wait and see what happens next. If this comes back above 6.4 and hold I'll change my mind.
I'm starting to think he is a troll. Hes been warned countless times both here and on whalepool not to degen like this, doesn't listen, always end up the same.
OK fine don't use trigger buys then, either way buying into a 100% position at your exact resistance makes 0 sense whatsoever and seems so retarded it has to be a troll.
I trade primarily on Bitmex and I trade as my only source of income; I am fully aware of how broken the platform is.

With that said, you have a few solutions: 

* If you want to buy breakouts on Mex, you have to use stop-trigger buys 

* If you don't want to use stop-trigger buys to buy breakouts, then you need to use another platform because Bitmex doesn't work.

* If you don't want to use stop-trigger buys and you refuse to use another platform, you simply cannot be a breakout trader and need to instead buy support, bottom of ranges, ect.

The entire point of being a breakout trader is buying breakouts.  It's not buying exactly at major resistance and hoping it breaks out.  That is literally the opposite of being a breakout trader.  It's actually just the exact opposite of what you should do regardless of your trading style.   

You guys making excuses for this guy (if he's not trolling) is only hurting him, not helping.  What he's doing is fucking retarded.
Keep telling yourself that.
But do you have millions to gamble with and lose?
How? I've literally never heard of a solution. 
Honestly, I think Blockchain needs to take a leaf out of IOTA if it wants to survive the apocalypse. Off-course, "quantum-resistance" will only be proven in the face of the adversary.
Regarding the last sentence, that is a question I had (if you always use closing price since RSI is probably based on candle close)

But in this case, I was looking at the close of the red candles and comparing the corresponding RSI values 
Ah I actually have kraken but never use it. I’ll look at that first.
And was honest enough to shamelessly Tweet it. Also he actually donated most of the $$ to the LTC foundation 

Edit: which is a NON PROFIT organization 
probably his tax free haven. Lee is a scamming pajeet
he sold all his personal LTC holdings. If that's not bailing on LTC, I don't know what is. 

Vitalik didn't sell all his ETH holdings on a flimsy "conflict of interest" excuse. If you are the creator of your own coin, ofc people expect you to be biased toward promoting your coin, how is that a bad thing? 
lol you respect Charlie Lee? 

he is a shilling pajeet who has contributed nothing. he copy pasted BTC to create his shitcoin and came up with the silver meme so it would catch on. 

He is no better than someone like Verge's Sunerok
Maybe you guys can all live together and have a separate economy, you can call it Rogertown and socially drink kool-aid in the evenings
Segwit is reverse compatible, Bcash is not. Bcash is the fork, go fork yourself.

I don't understand why BCH supporters are still so tight about it. You already have your coin, stop bitching about BTC already, get over it.

Focus on making BCH a truly global payment system capable of processing 500k tx/s and then everybody will use it.

Do you think 99% of BTC supporters do it because of maximalism? No! People prefer BTC over BCH cause it's the dominant coin and it's the most known cryptocurrency. Make BCH the dominant coin and everybody will flock to it and forget about BTC, me included.

I don't get paid by Blockstream or anyone to support BTC, I do it out of personal profit and selfish reasons, just like 99% of the population use Google instead of Bing, it's just the better option.

Until then stop taking shit about BTC, get over it.
🎂 
Mods are way too slow and lenient with this shit. I'm tired of picking up the slack and taking undue heat as a result. 

If the entirety of this situation didn't rest on my exhaustive efforts, I wouldn't be so jaded. Instead, now people are accusing *me* of using socks, which, while hilarious I guess, just goes to show how far up their own asses some people here are. 


I'm principled but I don't take reddit drama on an anonymous account "personally" per se. I just (rightfully so) think this is a problem, and apparently an ongoing one. Sure, I could play nicer, but why? I just don't give af anymore. Too much of this sub is lost about what is and isn't problematic, and a user like Sloppy it just **repeatedly** on the wrong side of things and refuses to acknowledge his role as part of the problem (and apologizing for driving OPM out of the sub).

I like a lot of you and stick around for that reason, but overall this sub is just devolving into shit.
Please report and ignore.
I didn't say 2k would signify the end of bitcoin? I said if the price was 2k and there's no other reason to believe bitcoin is dead/dying, then i would literally go all in with as much money as possible.
You think we won't dip thar far? If anything I could see us wick down just from the low moral from being rejected at 6800. Could be a good spot to trap bottom shorters too
Well you will go bankrupt sooner or later because you are just a degenerate gambler who is trying to justify his obsessions by reading tea leaves.
I'm on a streak of lack of patience and greed. 

The CA on the good position was still relatively fine at 6400ish.  The mistake was opening a 3x larger position in parallel on a dip, that should have not been bought, with a ca hundreds higher.
Btw just closed at 6440 the dumb position I had opened in the morning at 6580.  Yeesh, that was overly impulsive to open.
Sounds like we're basically seeing the same thing. Your description seems consistent with my assertion that this position looks neutral. I might be overestimating horizontal support, but I'm not seeing the volume I'd expect for a push past a double bottom.
think he's posted his positions in chat before. I believe dushman knows him in bitmex chat as griffin36 or smth 
It makes some sense. Isn't the best way but I can understand that. What I can't understand is no stop.

I do enter at resistance sometimes when I think it may break but I take a hit on a bounce and close with a loss. Waiting here down to 6.4 break was stupid, using 15x lev at 6.8 was stupid.
I can't believe people are justifying him buying resistance. When he commented that he longed the top I immediately asked why. I knew he was gonna get rekt. 

There was literally 0 reason to buy above $6700 when people could've waited for $6900+ 
nah, stop-trigger buys on a wick doesn't work because it could be a fake out wick. Stop trigger doesn't work when you are almost 3% of open interest.
He donated his LTC holdings to the LTC foundation which is a non profit organization. If your definition of supporting your coin is holding it than go back EOS or some other scammy centralized coin. He is developing and working for LTC more than he ever was and the last thing you can say is that he bailed the project. Grow up or at least do some google before you claim such a stupid claims

Edit: Satishi also “bailed” BTC
While older clients that won't upgrade can still process Segwit, Segwit itself can never be removed from the code base unfortunately.

Segwit as an upgrade comes with so many caveats that I wonder why it was so imperative an inclusion in the first place. Surely devs as talented as what Core has could have come up with something cleaner without all of the technical debt and TX data footprint bloat.
Well, up to you. But if this is causing you to be jaded to a point where it is affecting your trading or personal well-being, maybe put forth a reasonable amount of effort and not exhaustive. You'll probably be happier, IMO. 

I don't disagree with calling out people and their BS, but it can be a range of efforts, not an either chase down all BS/or ignore all BS.
I like you too. I think you may want to ask yourself if you are serious about tackling the problem - if you really want to solve it. If so, then it is in your best interest to gain as much support from the sub as possible. That would involve being less antagonistic, and phrasing posts in a way that asks questions and seeks to *understand* a different point of view. If you're asking yourself, "well where's the fun in that?", then I would say your primary motivation might not be change, but rather to elicit reactions. Any of that make sense?
I think we will probably get a bounce there but I don't think it would really be an intermediate/long term bottom. Just a short term one. I was thinking it'd be an intermediate bottom before, but now that we've visited $6800 my targets are lower

my old targets were $4.5, $5, and $5.5. now I'm not really targeting $5.5k 
"Man fears the unknown, despises the uncomprehended." -Dickson G. Watts
Take a step back. I’m not looking to open a position for a little. 

If $6300 holds I’ll be looking to go long, if it breaks I’ll be looking to short 
Almost. I'm playing neutral out of being safe. My TA says it's more likely to go down. We dropped 7% without any bounce, this just needs to cool off.

If I didn't make stupid gamble yesterday I would be still heavy short and didn't even think about closing here but needed to secure some profits.
then its just sad
Of course.  I am also shocked by the people trying to justify this.
Right... **Then don't try to trade breakouts on a broken platform with massive leverage**, don't be 3% of open interest when it's all overleveraged margin that you can't afford to lose.

It's really that simple.  

Saying "buy resistance" is acceptable because Bitmex sucks is just plain stupid and I'm honestly surprised to hear you justify that behavior /u/ibankbtc.

"damn guys bitmex locks up during breakouts so I'm just gunna buy the absolute top on margin and hope this multi-week resistance magically breaks" - Pure gambling.
Satoshi still holds his btcs
It's not affecting me personally, though it is sapping some amount of *time*, but less and less so (because I just hardly care at this point). 

I'm just calling it as I see it. I'm not trying to stir up needless drama, I'm just pointing out the facts of the matter. Unfortunately this offends a lot of accounts (most of the time the same exact ones.. I wonder why...) and leads to *me* being attacked. I can understand being annoyed with me or upset at my *approach*, but I'm not wrong. Plain and simple. I've been pretty much completely right about most of this stuff. Yet, *still* people say that *I'm* using socks (lmao, as if) and now they're accusing OPM of being me (which is flattering to me, really, but a completely baseless claim). 

Leave it to this sub to completely miss the actual problem and instead start a witch hunt against the whistleblower. 


It's not *fun* either way. I'm just dejected at this point. I shouldn't need to phrase anything in a particular way. Several people in here are **bad actors** and they pretend to not be (not meaning Sloppy, that guy is just confused as all hell). These people show up en masse to attack me and defend X, Y and Z account. 

I'm tired of even trying at this point. I'd rather just take my soma and get these memories scrubbed from my brain and live a life of quiet desperation.
Yes, thx for saying so to me just in case :) not going to chase this one.  Thankfully I had no (immediate) desire to revenge trade that previous close. Not bouncing off of 6420 was critical for me.


buying on resistance and shorting on support is viewed in hindsight. It did hit 10 day high and had bullish sentiment. BTC broke every resistance on the way up previously and broke every support on the way down. In the previous post, I was simply explaining that it is not easy to manage a large position and requires careful maneuvering.
Yeah, no worries at my end. Your approach is all I was commenting on. Up to you on whether that changes or not. I can filter out the noise if needed. 
You wanna tackle this shit? Because we can tackle this right now. Let's work backwards. What do you want to happen here, what is your goal? 

edit: (If you want to table this for now, and tackle it another day just say the word homie)
Come on man, it wasn't hindsight.  Everyone was watching that horizontal level.  

OP even stated he viewed it as major resistance (in foresight) and felt a breakout *above that level* would be bullish.

Then you guys tried to justify buying what he (in foresight) viewed as major resistance with his entire account balance on 15x margin because Bitmex locks up during breakouts?

I'm sorry, I just don't think you're helping this guy at all by normalizing that as if it's a trading strategy.  It's not.  It's gambling.  And OP's results have proven that.
Yeah, like I said. I'm pretty *meh* to the whole thing at this point. It's ironic that people are accusing me of using socks because I think it's pretty clear I don't give a fuck about my own reputation or anything like that. I would think that my personality and writing would make it quite clear that I would never engage in such stupid or unethical behavior (though I suppose that's exactly what a sock-master would say).

I'm also actually much more inclined to keep things light and meme-y, as is also demonstrated. I'm only inclined to make a scene when it's warranted and I certainly don't derive pleasure from doing so.

This stuff just pisses me off though and the *worst part* of it all is that someone like Sloppy can be so utterly confused about right and wrong. He's a well-meaning guy but his compass is clearly pointing the wrong direction and he's repeatedly been on the wrong end of things, defending the worst of the worst and attacking me for the wrong reasons and with baseless accusations. When a seemingly-ethical-and-nice person like him ends up on the wrong side, *that* pisses me off. I don't really see a better option than to call it out for what it is, which is complete *bullshit*. 

Sorry that *some people* take such issue with it, I can't please everyone :/




I gotta run in a few minutes so I won't be able to respond for a little while, but happy to hash this out in these comments, via PM or somewhere else entirely. Whatever works best.

My goal is to point out nefarious behavior and/or wrongheaded analysis/advice/etc. **and** to build a coalition of intelligent and honest users to help self police the sub better and not fucking attack and downvote me, when I point out the most obvious bullshit. 

But, like I said, I'm so disillusioned with the state of the sub at this point. What is even the point? More socks will show up, more stupid comments will be made, more slander will be leveled against *me*, more folks like OPM will disappear and so on. You think mods are Sisyphus? At least mods have tools and ban power. I'm pushing this rock without any hands and I'm being needlessly pelted by additional rocks. 

I just want a healthy sub, like this place used to be like 5-6 years ago. If I were a mod, I'm confident I could easily make this happen, but I'm not and mods are too *slow* and ineffectual (no offense, mod team). 

Open to suggestions, but if your only suggestion is that I sugar-coat my comments, I doubt that will have much of a desired effect.
I disagree, but that is what makes it a traders market, nothing everything is so certain, but probabilistic.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, you're not a one-man wolfpack, our wolfpack is at least two strong, so that's a start.

I was just joking with Jared about Sisyphus as Mods have a never-ending and mostly thankless responsibility, but I know what you mean.

To be fair, I think there is a difference between sugar coating, and phrasing something in a non-confrontational way. It's really just a tactic in that you don't give socks easy ammo to downvote/attack you. Rather than focus on the substance of your post, they will focus on the tone, which is the opposite of what you want. Don't give them that weapon.

Your approach so far isn't working as well as you had hoped, are you open to trying something new? 
Well at a minimum OP said he saw the level he YOLO margin long'ed as resistance so....

Not a good idea.
> Well, if it makes you feel any better, you're not a one-man wolfpack, our wolfpack is at least two strong, so that's a start.

Lol, thanks man. I *do* greatly appreciate the positive efforts of others, yourself included. 

>I was just joking with Jared about Sisyphus as Mods have a never-ending and mostly thankless responsibility, but I know what you mean.

Yeah, it *is* that way for mods and even more-so for me. I'm sure there are easier ways to handle this rock, but it's also a rock that I'm pushing largely for the benefit of the sub. I could just as easily keep track of all of this privately, tag accounts appropriately and never make a peep about it. Instead though, I put myself on the line and made this bullshit known loudly and proudly. Because people *should* know and the sub *would* be healthier if this was tamped down. 

>To be fair, I think there is a difference between sugar coating, and phrasing something in a non-confrontational way. It's really just a tactic in that you don't give socks easy ammo to downvote/attack you. Rather than focus on the substance of your post, they will focus on the tone, which is the opposite of what you want. Don't give them that weapon.

Fair enough, though it seems rather hopeless in either case, especially at this point. Haters gonna hate, reasonable folks gonna read between the phrasing and get to the content and mods are going to sit on their hands for far too long. 

>Your approach so far isn't working as well as you had hoped, are you open to trying something new?

Yes, but I'm also a rather outspoken and scathing, both elsewhere on reddit and in real life. I think there is value is being a bit obscenely disobedient and disorderly when it comes to matters like these. 

I'm skeptical that re-phrasing my comments would have any sway with my detractors. Most of these people despise me for *what* I'm saying, not *how* I'm saying it. Furthermore, I've certainly played nicer at times, particularly at the beginning of all this drama. It's not like I came out of the gate like this. In fact, if you go back to the very beginning when Arson was posting fake MEX screenshots, my initial comments were *very* tame and cordial. It wasn't until he, DK and Sloppy spun up the hate and defamation against me that I brought out the harsh language. I certainly believe that the best way to deal with trolls and bad actors directly is to mock and ridicule them. Playing nice never works. 
As someone totally oblivious to the matter you're discussing, may I request a TLDR?
For the record, even though I have been annoyed with your approach before, I do believe you have valid points to be made and should be listened to.

You don't HAVE to change your tone, but seeing this reasonable back and forth has made me less likely to dismiss future posts of yours. I want to root for you. Sorry if I was overly critical or antagonistic with our exchange last week.

This is a **highly-abbreviated** TL;DR

It would take ages to detail everything that went down, but this fellow is a master manipulator and has been caught using numerous socks, alts and tons of vote manipulation across a number of subs, including over just the past few days. That's why I would implore people to tag good and bad users here. There is so much manipulation, brigading, shilling and other bullshit that pervades crypto reddit that you can be reasonably sure that 50% of what your reading is complete sock puppetry bullshit.

Anyway, there's a ton of drama around this whole ordeal and a cohort of people are attacking *me* for bringing awareness to it. 

The account that Sloppy referenced above is one of arsonbunny's socks and the DushmanKush fellow he referenced is a complete asshole who was permabanned here and then perma-suspended from reddit (and also used many socks). Arson and DK were friends / collaborators and yet Sloppy sees no issue with being friends with both.


I have approached this differently in the past and didn't see better results. It's easier (and more satisfying) to be blunt and outspoken. People can like or dislike me for it or complain to the mods or even level ridiculous accusations at me (like *I'm* using socks). I don't care. I'll say my piece and speak truth to power when needed, regardless of how it's received by various accounts in this sub. 

I've had plenty of cordial discussions with Sloppy and yet he still always ends up on the wrong side of things. I don't need to be anything but curt with him at this point. 
So, this arsonbunny has a lot of time to waste and creates multiple accounts, but why? Are they trying to manipulate traders' sentiment in the BTC markets? Shill altcoins? Attack you personally? What's the purpose of it?
All of the above. 

He only started attacking me once I (and many others) called him out for posting fake screenshots of BitMEX positions (this was 3-4 months ago). Not sure exactly what his end goal is but yeah he's been caught shilling various shit coins and lying about his credibility (and his analysis is just idiotic hand waving anyhow). 

Shitcoin posts are reported and removed. Stupid analysis gets posted all day anyways. If some of those posts are fake-upvoted that may be annoying but maybe it's not such a big issue after all? As long as Reddit doesn't act against multiple accounts, there's not much we can do anyways. And there will always be the next person posting a fake screenshot. Stuff like that just happens. Call them out and move on, I'd say.
Yeah that's what I do. I should probably stop getting in back-and-forths with other posters though. I spend far too much time unnecessarily defending myself and getting into it with sketchy accounts or people who want to defend arsonbunny for whatever reason. I don't owe anyone an apology.
