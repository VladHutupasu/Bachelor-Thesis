[Daily Discussion] Tuesday, July 03, 2018 -- TITLE
#New post: [\[Daily Discussion\] Wednesday, July 04, 2018 →](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8vynby/daily_discussion_wednesday_july_04_2018/)
Well, I've just been for lunch with a bunch of friends and they all started chatting about crypto (hey it's one of *those stories*). They know I'm in (but not when or how much) but I decided to purposefully only respond to questions because I couldn't ask for a better field test on current newbie sentiment if I tried.

None, nil, zero, talk about the technology. I got asked what the difference between ETH & BTC was and that was it. I know this isn't *strictly* trading but I guess I'm bemused by the sort of issues/thought processes that 'dumb money' (and I don't mean that derogatorily to my friends) has when it comes to crypto trading.

Main quotes from them:

* "You just download a wallet thing and buy it on there" (they meant coinbase, which I pointed them towards after to avoid any potential faff, then the rest followed unprompted)
* "Eth looks more profitable" (Didn't say anything)
* "Bitcoin Cash sounds weird. Is it knock off BTC?" (I explained the concept of a fork very briefly, didn't explain any differences, still trying to be unbias)
* "Can't I buy through Paypal, verifying seems like a pain." (Welcome to crypto exchanges)
* "Why is this so hard to do on a phone, isn't it mean to be done on phones?" (Uhhhh)
* "Can you imagine buying it when it was like $0.10!" (cue some napkin calculations of gains from them all)
* "I'm going to buy $50, who cares about market conditions." (great trading friend)
* "I'm going to get ETH coin instead." (?)
* "It kinda looks pretty flat right now... Do you think it's going up [DaddyLittlePrincess8](https://www.reddit.com/user/DaddyLittlePrincess8)?" (I responded with the ultra conservative summary of approximately "There have been bubbles, historically the gains are high but right now it's a bear market. We could go down further, we could go up, we could go sideways. I can't tell you because I don't know. Your choice to take the risk."
* "I'm going to just buy and HODL!" (I think he wanted a prize for knowing the term?)
* " I'll put in the 50 quid then put a reminder in my Google calendar for 5 years time." (I bet he checks the price every few days then every hour in a bull run, he's defo the guy with the weakest hands for this sort of shit)
* "Can I just mine it at home." (Basic explanation of ASIC market dominance & electricity costs)

In the end they bought a mixture of BTC & ETH. Just a small amount mind you. Anyone else experienced any newbies recently? What I found fascinating was the distinct lack of conversation surrounding the ATH and potential losses if they had bought then. They seemed to consider the idea of buying then silly, that they would have never done it, and thus it wasn't worth considering. 
This is why I'm medium-term bullish:

Volume was declining on the last legs down and price moved up with good volume. If it keeps expanding as price goes up that is a clear sign. If it retraces with low volume that is also a good sign for more upside. https://www.tradingview.com/x/JAnrgi3K/

Right now those bullish divs are probably in play, most oscillators look good in the medium term. But there is a bearish div in the 12H OBV https://www.tradingview.com/x/ufDEsTmt/

Short term the rising wedge some have posted does not fit the volume profile so far. Some oscillators are showing bear divs in the shorter time frames so we might have a slight pullback though https://www.tradingview.com/x/0jpNZpTL/

Looking at 6400 for support, resistance is still at 6750. Any of those break and we will have a clearer picture. I'm currently long with CA 6K if 6400 holds I will add to my long. But I also opened a hedge short on my profits from 6620. 

Just to be clear, I don't think this is bottom or end of bear market. Just a short-medium term upside. 

I'm currently sitting in my hedge short at 6636 on September futures. Given our sideways movement inside the rising wedge, my entry is now less appealing. The top of our wedge now sits around 6750, which is also our resistance line from our last trip up here about two weeks ago. 6800-6900 should be the most significant resistance anywhere in this range. If we fail to break down from our rising wedge here, I may exit my position on a break of 6600. Climbing back over 6600 should give us a legitimate chance to test the top of our wedge, where I'll be looking to re-short (anywhere over 6700 and under 6850). 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/75qqcqoz/
Interestingly....BTCUSDLONGS are approaching a 3-month high. BTCUSDSHORTS are holding near their 3-month average.

Just something to watch. I'm not a big believer in the "long squeeze" idea, especially using BFX data. 3.3x leverage max is very hard to squeeze, and they're harder to squeeze than shorts, especially on BTC. 
No need to panic guys, apparently FUNDS ARE SAFU.

OBV and divergences are a common theme in the last few days. So here is a nugget to think about: 

- https://www.tradingview.com/x/1H5PYlWZ/

This is a bullish OBV divergence on the 1Week chart. I think this is pretty big. 

I only observed this another time, which was during the 2015 bear market: 

- https://www.tradingview.com/x/45ouLbG4/
Every non-BGD action is sideways or down.
Binance not updating trades anymore.

Edit : tested trading with a small amount, system maintenance message..probably related to the p&ds!
First TA Heavy Post in awhile incoming: 



-I view hanging >6600 currently as extremely bullish. Sell volume has been relatively weak since breaching 6600. But it is important to note that, 6800 has not yet been tested.


-Retracement from ~20k down to 5800 represented a 71% decline. As I have previously mentioned, historically bear markets are characterized by retracements of anywhere in the 75-80% range, yet BTC is unprecedented. Given the global nature of of BTC (read: global value) I believe this retracement could be complete, or at least not-insignificant.



-One ***often overlooked*** TA indicator: the slopes of these drops (from high point to low point, often called vertex points) are getting substantially flatter. Essentially the drops are taking more time to occur, and are getting less volatile. ***On a strict Price/Time graph, any way you look at it this is true.*** This is also apparent on the reverse (positive sloping sections of the graph). This signals a period of stability and accumulation in my book. 
 

-The bottom might actually have been found. The longterm support at ~5800 (established Nov, 13, 2017) held, and was relatively close to the long term ascending support established on March 23, 2017 (many don't use this line but I do) (~5300-5400). 





In conclusion: Yep I'm ***bullish***. Yep I'm in position to ride this bull. And I might be completely wrong and this is not investment advice. But I don't think I am.



Have a great day and live your best life. Good luck out there dudes and chicks. 


Edit: Grammar. 
OK so haven't posted any 'talking out of my arse' TA for a while....so here we go

ICHIMOKU CLOUD http://imgur.com/p1hXN0P
- We are now currently sitting above the 1 and 2 hour clouds, good news for a change. We are pretty damn close to the top of the 4 hour cloud, with the top line now sitting at roughly 6720 (Binance)

- Good news is...for the first time since 20th April, we now have a 4hour Kumo twist to a green cloud. Last time we had that we went on our run to 10k, before rejection. Make of that what you will. I'm not convinced just just yet.

- In terms of the daily cloud, we still have some ways to go before we reach the Kijun resistance line..currently sitting at 7890ish. The bottom of the daily cloud is then just above at 8050.

- Now the daily Kijun line and the base of the daily cloud are close to the ATH trend line, which is roughly sitting at 7620. So there is clearly a region between 7600 and 8000 which is going to a bastard to crack.

- The bad news. 
http://imgur.com/IfspJtM
We are now confirmed as under the weekly cloud. This is the first time this has happened since August 2014. I can't see anyway to sugarcoat it. Wish there was...
In order to now break up above the weekly cloud we'll have to get above 11,000. 

That will take some almighty effort.  

RSI/ATH Trend Line http://imgur.com/pCEIsiN
- Now we have broken through the price trend line from the 10k high... coupled with this we have also broken through the RSI resistance line from the same 10k rise. This is good news, but the big one is still the ATH trend line, you can see it circled on the chart... 

if we can break through all three of those resistance points that i've circled, i'll be a very happy boy. Does that mean end of bear market? Nope. Would it be good news, absolutely

WAVETREND http://imgur.com/NT1FRqf
- We are currently sitting at a tough resistance point on the Wavetrend indicator. You can see in the image that in recent weeks/months we tend to start a recovery, then we hit the -18/-19 point on the Wavetrend and we reverse. 

The only time this year we broke through it was in April, you've guessed it...when we made that run to 10k. So yep, if we break through it alongside breaking through the RSI and ATH trend lines, then you really could start to get the feeling we're on the move in the medium term.


$$$My optimistic end of bear market price points, as of today's date

- 9300 first big big number. This is above the daily Ichimoku Cloud and all key TA resistance lines
- 11500 second confirmation. Above the weekly Ichimoku Cloud


Babysitting a 6640 long from the fucking morning(Europe time), finally some movement, gonna close it asap hopefully in a small profit and get back to living
If the rising wedge is legit, we just broke down from it. 
Oh shet, Binance went down
Closed my position cause I'm about to make a 6 hour drive and don't want to crash watching the order books.
Funds are safe
https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1014347305783255040
That was some epic stop hunting that got me too

Reshorted swaps at 6625

edit: And I always half my position size when getting stopped out with a loss, this is highly recommended to lower risk and avoid overtrading
Just like my ex wife, looks like Bitcoin is going down again soon and loads of guys out there are gonna love it... whilst I ponder in anger and denial.

damn you Jennif....Bitcoin. 


I'm starting to re-consider the hedge I'm in from $6630. The more I look at it, the more "bullish" (or at least neutral, or not bearish) things look. This \_linear\_ drawing is becoming a meme on Twitter: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZebTCoIZ/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZebTCoIZ/)

That ATH trend line through 10k has been broken, which is arguably very bullish when combined with:

* Double bottom at around ~~\~$5900~~ \~$5800
* 2H cloud setup confirmed and played out perfectly
* 4H cloud is turning bullish: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/Cn0gSZzh/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Cn0gSZzh/)
* Many alts are bouncing/confirming support

The 4H cloud chart above tells us that resistance is sitting at $6765 (where the lagging price probably would break out). But the meme resistance at $6800 is likely to be the "real" point of resistance.

In my opinion, the risk/return continues to be in favour of shorting anything below $6800-6900 purely based on the general/weekly trend which is still down. But should we break $6800, I could see massive FOMO in the markets.

Edit: Going to continue holding the hedge for now. After all, we're still in a bear market, and capital preservation is key (for me that means preserving the cash value of my stack).
Closed my longs from $5800’s/$6100s/$6200’s for a total of about a 36% gain @ $6586

I really had a difficult time closing these as the entires were pretty spectacular, but wanted to lock in profits. 

Disclaimer: I know well enough by now it’s too premature to call H&S patterns/ Invs head shoulders, but it’s just something to keep an eye on in the future:

Pretty damn big rising wedge on the 4H, which could break down hard. We should know the outcome within the next 12 hours.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/8f8yeG2U/

Possible head and shoulders pattern on 4H. Very pre mature but it’s something you should keep an eye out on. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/TEPGCqmy/

Take a step over to the 1D chart, and it looks like a possible Invs Head and shoulder in the making

https://www.tradingview.com/x/2RbXrzgS/

No matter what, all of these patterns would need a *move down* to help validate them

This could very well still move up and goes as high as $6730 before invalidating the wedge. I have some short orders stacked up there
Not long ago, when bitcoin was trading at 9K, traders and holders were so bullish, funding rates were sky high. Dip buying were being praised religiously. I am afraid we are seeing the opposite at this juncture, short term at least. Funding rates are very low. Shorts are stacked despite evidence of a short term bullish move.

Since yesterday technical indicators are beginning to tilt in favor of bulls, again short term. I'll list them

Above 20 day moving average with slope upward
Above 10 day high
Two trendline breaks https://www.tradingview.com/x/765d1KEy/
Slightly above previous low, although not confirmed yet
A confirmed double bottom with target slightly higher than current price

I am leaning bullish since lower levels and not because I have a position, but because I am betting what these indicators are telling me.
I closed my $5880 long here... [we've got some small bear divs on the hourly.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ig4MMHG2/)  I might be too early at $6650, but I think, at best, this has another $150-200 potential upside before a small retrace and I feel more comfortable taking profits now - I suspect there will be another opportunity to buy at $6600.

Longer time frames are beginning to show some compelling bullish indicators.  [In particular the 3D MACD is flirting with a crossover.  3D Stotch already in transition.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/drn1MrVs/).  This may have the momentum to move price back in the high $7's - low $8's over the next couple months. 
Zooming out to a long term view this feels very much to me like a "return to mean" moment over the next 1-2 weeks

Don't know how far this move down will take us, but I'm cooking up a mean red wine jus to eat my words.

Shame on me for questioning Chewy ey.
Trading aside, we’ve got some pretty cool developments in the upcoming future

lightning mainnet, still no major bugs. The new release of lnd is pretty great and a lot of good things on the way, e.g. watchtowers and amps

ECDSA threshold signature schemes possibly on the way

Schnorr sigs on the way

Grin is moving along quite well. Two testnets so far, looking like it might go on a tear

Hearing a lot of noise about sidechains. Think we should hear more about these in 2019

Possibly some new OP codes on this he horizon in 2018 soft forks

I’m not at all worried

Edit: Where’s Casper? Anyone know? Havent heard much since the launch of hybrid PoS on testnet
Hopium fueled forecast:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/YEXIUwCU/

Variations on a theme of C&H breakouts pushing through resistance.

Likelihood of any forecast coming true is slim to none, but if Bitcoin is reversing the trend here, I think it's going to be a slow recovery. This forecast looks pretty hopeful and it has us moving through 10k in November.
So a break down has been rejected but will it break up? Would be very bullish and to me the beginning of reversal.
Battle for the 1h Ichi cloud support @ $6470
Short closed at 6465. It's probably a bit premature, and I definitely could have done a partial close. However, 6400 should serve as pretty good support. This was also a bigger position than normal for me and I'm liking my profits so far. I may re-short if this bounces, but I want out of position to allow myself time to re-assess.

(Also, I'm loving my 12 for 12 stretch the past two months, and I honestly just want to keep it running as long as possible.)

!short xbtu18 close 6465
Is it me or everyone is suddenly bullish since yesterday ?
TIL: in bitmex, if you mouseover the orderbook where you have an order, you can cancel it there.
To me this place is becoming toxic to traders. Where is the brotherly love? The exchange of ideas? and  educated discussion of TA?... is this turning into a typical YouTube comment section? 
From what I understand, someone got some users' api key on binance ( how ? ) and used it to buy SYS at an absurd price. Of course he was the one selling those SYS and has withdrawn 7000 btc ( around 45M at the current price ) from binance. Everything is down for maintenance according to binance.

Damn, not a single boring day in this space.
Let's see if I can do some bottom fishing here. To add.
I was heading out for the afternoon, and I had mentioned earlier I'd close at breakeven on a break of 6600. Not wanting to get slipped into a loss, I moved it to 6599, which sold into a wall at 6600. Seems like it would have been fine to hold so far, but I'm away from charts for the next several hours, so I'll stay out for now.

!short xbtu18 close 6600

Watch it plummet now. 

Edit to add: I still think we're going down. I would not exit here yet if I hadn't been stopped. I don't want to re-enter and then step away from charts for 5 hours.
The 1 Hour charts look coiled to the tits...
https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/hyperbitcoinization/

How do people still feel about this?  Still on the table?  I find the idea fascinating.  I really do think the world will have one electronic currency quite sooner than we think.  It just makes total sense to me and seems inevitable that we replace the Rube Goldberg-esque world of separate currencies for each country, exchange rates that vary constantly between them, changing the money from one form into another, etc.  The internet has no borders, so why does our money?
I'm just opening another hedge on my balance here, which I may add to at 6800 if it reaches that. Alts are bleeding here, compared to pumping on the flag at $6300 which concerns me a bit, and we are forming a bearish wedge (which everyone here seems to be tracking). I figure if this breaks down, it will likely bounce on support below around $6300. However, there is always the possibility it could break through support, which is why I am opening this hedge. I still think it's a bit early for that if we're gonna form a lower low from here, but who knows. Longs still greatly outnumber shorts (34k vs 23k), so this could still have some room to move down.

!short xbtu18 6570 10x 10&#37;

More news, thanks for the great feedback from this channel. 
Longs are still on the rise. I'm baffled.
Hedged a short. 

Not liking what’s going on with Binance. BTC over reacts to the littlest bit of FUD. 

I’m also going to start using the position bot, so I Can keep track of trades better/ people can easily see my positions.

Edit: As i finished writing this it looks like Binance froze their systems. Nothing is refreshing 
All deposits and withdrawals are suspended on Binance, not looking good

Since I was questioning the rising wedge pointed out by /u/haserfauld yesterday - and got downvoted - I would like to share what I am looking at:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/9o5DtcTG/
- sorry for cutting off wicks etc, it is just how things work for me...

Looking to enter a long in the 6200 to 6400 range, will probably go short at 6800 if we reach there first..

Something extremely fishy is going on with Binance right now...

Major pump and dumps.

First KEY, SYS, then MANA, and now APPC. 

I’m not sure if it’s an API hack, but I just moved coins off exchange. 

Edit: Now GAS...

Edit2: Now CHAT, VIB, MCO, TNB,
Been away from the markets for 2 weeks, and when I come back, nothing has changed. Meh... Time to golf.
Even more bullish after failed bart.
It almost feels like whales have deployed an army of the reversal squad. Suddenly seeing an increasing number of bullish comments that are not really backed by TA
Apparently Roger or someone [bought ads](https://imgur.com/a/CZ0KhAE) on /r/HailCorporate or just bought the sub itself.

I've seen my share of irony, but this might take the cake.
As i mentioned earlier i believe that btc is in the uptrend now which will last for quite a while:

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8tx0m2/daily_discussion_tuesday_june_26_2018/e1b6sw9/

Bearish divergence on the shorter timeframes made me close all my long positions at 6640 (alts), and will wait a little to see if it's going to play out and if btc will have a slight correction. Don't expect anything significant, but a 2 or 3 hundred drop. Will reconsider if it goes above 6750 or so.

Good luck to all.
Is anyone trading the eth/btc ratio now that the EOS eth wallet is empty? 

PS. Sorry if off topic


We dont know anything outside of what FUD has been passed around, no reason to jump to conclusions just yet because some bear is hungry
1h Bbands tight as hell! This will bart soonish 
So I spent an hour last night putting together a nicely formatted TA based post and wake up thinking we might actually break 6800, and am all excited and then this hack comes along. Fuck that's crypto for you. 


#MyCryptoLife 
Got distracted while reading this thread then thought I was reading /r/CryptoCurrency 
What is this? Correction for ants?
What if I would tell you that this was a correction of the correction and we're back in the correction?
I’ve lost count of how many times this has affected my trades. I have a target sell price in mind, but whenever I enter a trade, I set the stop loss in case it goes against me. Normal risk management stuff. Then I go to sleep, just to wake up a realize it hit my target sell price and came back down. Frustrating to say the least. Anyone use a bot to switch from a stop loss order to a limit sell depending on the price reaching a certain proximity of either?
To anyobdy who uses coinigy...

Are you experiencing the same issue where particular saved charts cause tabs in chrome to become unresponsive and fail to load. I spent all day making charts and I have 1 to show for it 
Stand off at the crypto corral.... your move partner 
Smallish? buy wall on Binance https://imgur.com/a/5u32Tu2 wonder if it will disappear in a puff of sells....
https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/07/03/syscoin-cryptocurrency-blockchain-hacked/

Some info.

>Syscoin’s blockchain explorer shows that more than one billion of its coins were mined in a single block. This is peculiar because the cryptocurrency’s total possible supply is 888 million — significantly less than the mined amount in the block number 87670.

https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/syscoin/

Not much of a jump in price though (that I can see, maybe it was very brief) compared to the VIA hack, which went up 10,000%.

EDIT: https://www.binance.com/tradeDetail.html?symbol=SYS_BTC  nevermind I see it lol.

I'm able to log in to Binance and indeed all my funds are safu.
Meanwhile in [/r/cryptocurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8vvkr1/eos_caused_the_bear_market)..
So somehow 11 Syscoin sold for close to 700m, full order books cleared and now 7000 BTC is getting dumped on Binance. 

If this is all correct, gotta be why be just took that hard drop, eh?

7000BTC moved out of @binance hot wallet after the syscoin api pump. binance has not issued any withdrawals since.

TLDR (both btc and alts): looking to enter long as we should start looking for a daily higher low. Stops at break of the higher low or previous lower low (worst case exit). Taking profits on longs as BTC hits resistances, most likely to hedge short and take biggest profits around 76xx-78xx.

Disclaimer: still learning and I redraw my lines more often than I change me socks so bear that in mind.

My charts: https://www.tradingview.com/x/Ubr5dImV/

And current plan:

Took some profits from my long around 66xx and entered a small, low lvg short at 6610. Willing to add to my short between 6740 and 6820. Stops on the short and long entry would occour if we get a daily close above 6870.

Closing short and adding to long between 64xx and 62xx with stops on a daily close below 6150. Shorting below 6k to 5k, possibly flip long 49xx-48xx.

Will be watching 73xx-74xx and be ready to take profit if trouble in the area.

Definitely take profit in 76xx-78xx zone (less if took profit earlier but close longs on clear rejection). Possibly short with a stop above 79xx.

Kinda feel like im trying to plan too far but I guess it gives me time to amend those plans as we move around.

Looking for at least a brief, breather rally. Couple of weeks of green before more downside wouldnt surprise me. Imo, for a sustained move up we need a catalyst. Main ones i can think of is BTC ETF or ETH futures. Equally, negative news regarding the catalysts are likelly to bring downside
I was totally expecting that to inverse bart.
Jesus. Crypto never boring. 
Time to lock in profits from my 6625 short. Never ever underestimate the bear market and profit taking that occurs. I mean just read at the subs, people are looking to unload at any small move upwards, creating all this selling at resistance points.  

If 6500 holds now it would be sort of bullish at least
Anyone not considering this as highly likely a reversal is being delusional imo. Also I wanna point out I made the first 'that was the bottom' post on the 25th June - not so humble brag - and no, I'm not one of those people that were calling the bottom on the way down every other day.

I figure we will hit 67XX-68XX in the next 36 hours, come back down to 6500-6600 then onwards and upwards to somewhere in-excess of 9XXX+ in the coming weeks based entirely on my own intuition from making my living doing this for 5 years. That and the 3D StochRSI, my sweet sweet child.

ps going back below 6300 makes this theory entirely null & void. SL set @ 6374.5 on my 10X long currently sitting @ 44&#37; ROE < 3

pps I'm still in Bali for another week or three if anyone's about, lets grab a drink.
Greetings all, Been lurking and posting occasionally here since 2013. 

As others have mentioned, I see a short term bull opportunity for use to reach \*\*around\*\* 8000 before heading back down to this area again.  I'm adding to my long position all the way to the low 7000's. From there it's make it or break it. If we breach 8000-9000, I'll feel more bullish in the medium term, but for now it's best to play the market for what seems like guarenteed short term run up.  

And of course, as my flair indicates, I'm long term bullish. 
I have short orders stacked at the following:

15% @ $6682.5

15% @ $6706.7

15% @ $6723.3

15% @ $6763.5

40% @ $6794.5

Falling wedge inside an rising wedge on 1H. It tired to break up/ is doing so now. 
The wedge broke down, and is looks like $6500 isn't going to hold either. Despite this, a bullish narrative is slowly growing on me, which will guide my decisions in the near term.

**Bullish narrative**

I've had a few successful trades recently, so I don't wanna be too greedy on my current hedge from 6630. My target is to close around 6350 due to a confluence of different factors at this price point:

* 10K decending trend line support
* High-volume profile node
* Support from EMA 200 on 1H chart
* A cluster of support at 6300 (e.g. 6H kijun)
* 6350 would also paint a bullish higher low

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/xFMgSm3N/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/xFMgSm3N/)

Should we bounce before my target at ($6350) I'll close the hedge at a small loss above $6800-6900 depending on how things look.

**Bearish narrative**

The main things that speak against a bullish narrative are:

* The general/weekly down trend
* Relatively deep liquidity for shorts (provided by the growing number of longs)
* Hidden bear divs forming on the 12H-1D charts

Should 6300 break down I will find a new entry for a hedge.
A small tidbit I'd like to share with you guys about the Indian scene.

Post RBI regulations and possible ban of banks participating in cryptocurrency transactions, Koinex, one of the biggest exchanges in India is launching a product called Koinex Loop. Loop is envisioned as a P2P escrow based service (similar to Localbitcoins) which will be built into the exchange platform itself.

I think this is a great step forward towards both adoption and a validation of how cryptocurrency was meant to be transacted. Just wanted to share.

Disclaimer: I'm in no way associated with Koinex other than being a customer.

Where does it look like this will go? The whole Binance thing seems to be really serious 
Reporting in again, closed my long from 6,338.3 to 6,608.8. Taking those profits.

Reopening a bigger long position. We are headed to 7000. 

**!long XBTUSD 6614 3.33X**
I made a commitment to myself to try and be more balanced (bull vs bear) with tracking macro geopolitical news events, so here's one potentially for the bearish case. 

Officials from China are (very publicly) saying that they will not use devaluing of the Yuan as a tactic during a trade war. If you believe them, and you hold a substantial amount of Yuan, then you probably wouldn't be as inclined to demand capital flight vehicles like Bitcoin. If you don't believe them, however, then you might be inclined to demand more bitcoin. 
What the actual fuck. I tethered up the BTC i bought at $6200 at $6600 when i saw a 250 BTC buy wall (which always leads to dumps) then got scared of the binance hack and bought back half (not exactly half but you get my point) of my trading stash at $6510 and tried to withdraw.

Now half of my trading stack is stuck at "withdrawal processing". I should have stayed 100% tether even if its in binance. Fuck this seriously im going to a massage parlor to blow off some steam.
I haven't done one of these in a while as I've been waiting for the relief bounce to happen. 

My current position was filled in the 6300 range a couple of weeks ago. I'm targeting a limit sell at my projected top in the 8200 range. This will bring us to the .382 fib retracement line for the drop from 10k. The previous drop from 12k also recovered to the .382 fib line, so I'll be scaling in limit sells starting at 8000. 

I had previously been targeting 7450 for my limit sells, but with Coinbase announcing their Custody platform and rumors of the SEC approving crypto ETFs in the wind, I think we will see a higher bounce than expected. I'll be protecting my position with stops along the way until we approach my target range. 

When/if we dump from the 8000 range, I will scale in buys in the mid-5000 range with a bounce target of 4800. 

Here's my macro chart:

1D Chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/zOGcSTGD/

It seems Bull want to push 1 more leg up before market attempt a slight correction. I am surprised that we are still trading above $6600.  In the past few weeks, we seldom stay near the top of the pump. Last time it pump to 6545 then trading around 6350. When 250M Tether pump it peaked to 6350 and trading around 6200 before going down.
Anyone else seeing the hidden bear div on the 1d? Invalidated with a daily close over 6760~ i think.
Think it's time to start buying the dips and stop shorting the bounces 👍

Bear run

ban already in place, this just confirms it pretty much as good law? 
Am I right in thinking the Ichikomu 1 hour cloud is suggesting resistance at $4670?
I call 6k in three days. 
The situation is not looking good for the Bulls. Its has been clear the was just a bounce to ease up on the oscilators as we dropped quite fast the last weeks.

We have made it to the Falling wedge target we broke out of. However, a new ascending wedge had us running out of steam and the bounce is rolling over to a drop anytime towards 6200 as a first target. STCH RSI and MACD confirming weakness.

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/nLfOrtnt/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/nLfOrtnt/)
I honestly don't see a bull run kicking off anytime soon and I'm really tempted to transfer a few Ltc's to Btc for a short. Whomever reads this, could you do me a solid and give me some feedback. 

Upvote if your thinking trend is your friend short here is easy money. Trend is your friend. I hate that saying and feel gross saying it. But, we've been in a bear market basically all of 2018. 

Downvote if your somehow bullish and think going long here would be profitable as you think this recent 2 day bounce has legs and we're going to take off.

Edit: seeing a few people voted I should go long, I'm forced to take that advice seriously and it gave me the confidence needed to pull the trigger.

More hacks to come less people to join bitcoin. 
Network hashrate has dropped ~5-10%. Perhaps the flood in China since most miners were still profitable enough to keep running sub $6000 so it’s more likely an external event than just economics. No idea if this is temporary or not, but worth paying attention.
Closed 6560 short at 6476.  Had 20% of trading stack on the line. Goal is to make crypto and don't feel good about this ride/dump. Might regret closing so early, but I'm walking away with a small amount more than I started with. Was expecting about 5% correction after last few days of gains. A scalp is better than nothing. Always tomorrow.
This little rise cant be sustainable can it? Looking for a pullback which should happen soon. 1day ta still bearish imo
Looks like 6450 might be a good target to open some low leverage longs. Rising wedge on larger time frames with hidden bearish div. on smaller timeframes. 

Chart here: https://twitter.com/TrainCrypto/status/1014097155936710656
Looks like a dead cat bounce. Alts are struggling to maintain gains on the 2nd day, being harshly rejected. Bitcoin is consolidating already. 200ma and 50ma on daily all pointing down sharply. 200ma about to not count the 20k high, it’s going to turn even sharper downwards. I think this has room to go down a lot more. 
silly daytraders don't realize that the whales are ready to go back up, hence the 4000 BTC wall between $6400 and $6500 thats slowly being moved up(just look at the chart)

Wow the bulls are strong...
I have posted before that makes sense to stay short most of the time, because there is always more bad crypto news right around the corner.  It's usually either regulatory/bans or an exchange hack.  This is a reminder that it's still the best strategy.
OK so do I low leverage long this in anticipation of an attempt at 6800, or sit on my hands and wait for <6400?

Señor Bart Strikes Again
I’m not saying the price is absolutely moving any direction, especially without some bull and bear testing, but some of you highly underestimate the impact of Mt. Gox! Not to mention the first major nation “banning” Bitcoin. I have just got back in with 50% of what I sold and the other half I’m saving for a year from now, unless we’re already at ~$100k.

Why do people invest in ICOs? Which factors matter most? We (Trier University, GER and Erasmus University, NL) are currently conducting a survey to answer these questions (and more) in an empirical fashion. If you have ever invested in an ICO, please help us by answering the following survey: https://www.unipark.de/uc/ICOs/ Your help is greatly appreciated.

The results of the study and all related publications will be published Open Access and freely available. Also, if we reach 500 participants or more, we will hold an Ethereum raffle in which we will distribute 0.5 ETH to a randomly chosen person.
the pumps look so inorganic to me, each time the price dump just a little bit, a massive pump follow up and more interestingly is that Bitfinex is leading these actions. 

I wonder for how long that fresh printed Tether is going to last.

Edit: Will add to the conspiracy, I wouldn't be surprised if Bitfinex turned to be a second Mtgox.
How much do you guys think this hack will affect the market once binance is up?

I talked to my friends once, and they brought up ripple and how it could be the next btc... we don't talk about crypto much anymore.
I dont have any friends :( 
some of my friends wanted to buy really badly when the price was around 15-18k, like, right at the top; one of them did manage to buy it actually, one or two days just before the price went down 

other ones decided to wait and see; they are not interested in buying it now at all, but i have no doubts they will be when the price reaches ATH again, that's how markets work, no?
My normie friend ended up putting 10k on Bitcoin Diamond when it got listed on Binance. He now have $700
Surprised they didn't ask you about any shitcoins to invest in (I'd consider that a good thing looking back at 2017), actually they did mention bitcoin cash, but at least they didn't say they were buying it 
Good analysis, furthermore we are still trading above the 21D EMA which was a strong resistance during the last bearish leg.

Stoch RSI on the weekly has also turned bullish which was a significant indicator in the last two mid-term bullish runs.

I think indicators on longer timeframe are far more indicative than indicators on lower timeframe (4hr ot lower). 

These are the resistance I'm looking at: https://www.tradingview.com/x/CxMkEJIX/

Max bullish scenario would be a 10k double-top
The volume profile you describe is pretty typical with these bart formations. We tend to see a few of these lower volume drops followed by slight retraces on increasing volume, but not as  high as our initial rise (think back to after the SEC came out with the securities news). Then we usually hug resistance till volume drops really low followed by a high volume move down 
Well said....  But I upvoted you because of your username ;)
Doubling my position right here. Will exit at break-even. 

!short XBTU18 add 6590 25%
shorts and longs get squeezed every time they hit 40k.

If you think of $5.8k to $6.6k as the inverse of $7.4k in April (when we came back down to $6.7k) then it's quite similar- longs decreased and shorts increased to 40k then got squeezed. 

Now we're still within this range with longs piling on when we've made a new low and longs get squeezed when we hit 40k generally (there's been 2 or 3 times in the past few months)


Squeeze is a meme.

But jokes aside, a lot of people refer to squeeze as liquidations, in fact those are SL, and SLs for shorts are usually tighter than longs, that's why it's easier to squeeze shorts than longs.
Check out the difference between [ETHUSDSHORTS](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSDSHORTS/) vs [ETHUSDLONGS](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSDLONGS/) also
They are impossible to squeeze at the bottom. It's like a short squeeze at 10k, not gonna happen.
BTCUSDLONGS seem to have a strong support.

Worth noting that MFI (money flow index) and accum/dist, two other volume based indicators that also take into account price, confirm the divergence.

Indicators that ignore volume (like RSI) do not confirm it.
The scale of the divergence in 2015 is substantially larger. I can't find any other criticism of this observation. Pretty good sleuthing.
This is a very important point imo. Any upwards growth is just sudden spikes; not gradual steady growth over many days. Until that starts to happen again I remain pretty bearish.
every corner is a goal, every corner is a goal
Exacty, I don't understand how people can call this a reversal, still noone is excited about buying bitcoin.


Lol the second I sent this a green dildo started the form, but it doesn't even excite me anymore. I want slow gradual increase.
What is BGD ?
Maybe an algo [correctly?] predicts that there will be slow upward growth to X, and just acts before the market does.  That leaves any money on the sidelines to either buy in at the new higher price, or take no action.  Once the sideline money stops buying, the algo barts the price back down to previous levels after taking some profits.
you r assuming up=BGD. pure bias.
Agreed - long term perhaps. Lots of smart (& dumb) money out there looking for a home. Lets talk more in 2 or 3 years when fundamentals & adoption becomes more crystallized. For now we are completely at the mercy of the whales during these low volume periods. TA during low volume periods feels (to me at least) like a game of cat & mouse. The whales are the puppet masters & unless you have honed your skills (in terms of risk management more than anything else) your are essentially just gambling (been said on here many times). In any case be that as it may, vertex points or not, I still think we are some ways off from turning this ship around. More accumulation over the next few months seems very plausible (to me).  When we go above 12k I'll start reassessing my sentiment (in the medium term) - but it will take a lot to shake me out of my medium-term bearish sentiment. For now I keep looking for good short entries.
>  Sell volume has been relatively weak since breaching 6600. 

Sell volume is generally always weak now.  Also, buy volume is always weak.  The only exceptions are the 5 or 10 min per week where the price spikes upwards or dumps hard.
> As I have previously mentioned, historically bear markets are characterized by retracements of anywhere in the 75-90% range

Such as what? Do you have a source on those figures?


Edit: Spelling of grammar ;)

Your slope drop is piss easy to see on the Coinbase yearly chart, and is what I have been noticing too. Drops would decrease by nature the further down you go, but we’re starting to look pretty flat on the longer timeframe charts.

Still waiting with cash on the side to buy back in, but my finger is getting itchy.

One thing we still can’t discount is the reaction to the release of the next batch of Gox coins in September. I suspect there will be some big selling then as people choose to cash in on the released coins.
Thanks for your insights. Appreciate your efforts mate.
that's a solid analysis. thank you. 
Lol @ your 20k trendline that only touches 2 points. You could draw a better trendline but it would be already violated last month.
Living is overrated
I see at least three rising wedges visible on the 4 hour chart and we've now broken down from each one. 
Thats good risk management on a couple of levels
Good choice, don't feel bad for missing sth and no FOMO! 

There will be plenty other opportunity
From what I read, funds are not safe and 7000 BTC was stolen.  However, Binance may reimburse those who lost funds, so money will not disappear out of their accounts.
Just barts being barts, nothing new here
Shorts still haven't learned your lesson, eh? 
Any particular reason why?

I've seen nothing buy healthy consolidation since the move up yesterday. I'll turn bearish if we dip below the current support level (6535 on GDAX), but until then I expect another leg up in the next day or two.
I laughed and cried inside at this comment. *pats Richy's back*

Ha!!
i hope not
username checks out.
I'm in a similar spot. I'm holding for now, though. 
What exchange had a double bottom at $5900?   On Both Bitstamp and Bitfinex it in the $5700d.
Volume profile doesn't fit the rising wedge http://thepatternsite.com/risewedge.html

Volume: "Trends downward at least 74% of the time until the breakout."
Basically it all depends on this drop we are experiencing now. If it bounce back up above 6.6 then I don't think we will see more down short term.
Thanks for being excellent with us
Nice trades, nothing wrong with taking profit.
Good calls lately man, nice work. 
Isn't a head & shoulders a reversal pattern? Unless your counting this pump up to 67 a reversal from the downtrend (which i dont agree with). Plus that H&S isn't even close to completing...at all
You were one of the posters I highly respected back in 2014, so I definitely take your posts with some weight. Youve mentioned getting above $8k - what makes you think we can possibly get back into the symmetrical triangle? I feel like every dump will convert more people to bears than vice versa and that most bulls would want to preserve or at least hedge at the sym triangle while bears short it.

Most people who keep saying "everything is different from 2014" probably weren't around for 2014 like us. Even though Bitcoin has more liquidity and matured a bit more, I disagree that a bubble pop will behave too much different. What do you think?

I've been saying the same thing since Jan - I have no idea how people are comfortable holding longs. Of course, I've missed out on some good gains because of it. Just never know when it'll top out..not worth it.
Profit is profit, congrats. But if we break 6800 this thing could really run. That is the break that led to the first BGD. People will be buying, quickly imo. 
You mean like 7.5 k or something?
We dropped like $50, nothing to worry about yet.

Chewy goes with a hedge when he's shorting, so he basically just misses the move up, not losing USD value.
It might be too early to tell but good character on your part to acknowledge. I have respect for traders/people like you! :)
Fava beans and a nice _chew_anti!

Did he actually open a short though? If I recall he was kind of vague about the short term market
As he said "Is it really that hard to fathom?" why he would short there
Casper is currently being formally verified (Cornell-based research team). 

Formal verification began in March-April I believe, and the deadline for F.V. contract is end of July. 
They delayed Casper. Again. It's being rolled into an early form of sharding so ETH will switch to both PoS and sharding in (I think) 2019 as one update.
I’m hopeful. I’d say the deeper your number (2) drop is the MORE likely the outcome as you’ve depicted. If number (2) is not as deep then I think it will flatten the end result substantially.

Isn't c&h at the end of a strong uptrend?
wrong my dude.

It's a subreddit of traders, AKA people trying to take each other's money....
To be fair, we had plenty of great TA posted here after the flag breakout yesterday, and since then not much price movement has happened besides the 1%-1.5% move this morning. I can understand why people aren't posting revised TA charts every hour when the price hasn't even moved outside of a $40 range for hours.

EDIT: I'm not excusing the low-effort comments. I'm just saying that there's not much meaningful discussion to be had at this moment since we already discussed all our predictions yesterday.
many newcomers, not accustomed to this sub standards, specially if they llanded from other crypto subs. 
Agree. Too many toxic posters here lately, cba posting/reading here as much anymore.   Think the downtrend is taking its toll...
I’m looking for a possible $6315 to $6360 close for July 4th. I’m not trading until after the 5th and the removal of the December ATH from the 200 day MA. I’m thinking some high leverage longs will get liquidated. Watching for a retrace to the low before a legitimate bullish uptrend last week of July.
you'd think these exchanges would have fraud prevention algos in place to prevent something like this

withdrawing more than 5x your usual amount? manual approval time

account profited more than 5x in 24 hours? manual approval time 

etc etc

Was thinking about moving my stops from 6.8 to be, for now I'm glad I didn't. Gonna ride it a bit longer, probably regret in the morning ;-)
Is that a TA term?
Nice Big Short reference there.
This is low probability in any economy. There are a handful of economies where something like this may happen, but areas that are most susceptible also have issues with hardware and network infrastructure to support it. 

Lightning development and adoption are critical to support an event like this.

It could happen. I think there's a 50% chance that we'll see a national economy change this way in the next 12 years. After one economy goes through an event like this a second will quickly follow.
Delusional. Look at europe. Euro. Stable (german idea) vs. unstable with inflation (Spain, Italy).

Different countries have AND NEED different policies - at least medium term.

One world currency would not solve that.

Exchange rates varying is the oil that smoothes out problems betwen country competitivenesses.
As long as there are countries and governments there'll be tax and they'll charge tax and pay out in currencies they control. They're not going to give that up. 

It would take a change that goes far deeper than just money.

[This guy](https://twitter.com/DanielKrawisz) is a fucking moron and full-on BCash shill now. He just trolls Twitter with the most incomplete, low effort nonsense and debunked propaganda. 

I can't even be bothered to read a short article by him. Dude is insufferable and comes across as highly **un**intelligent on Twitter.

Actually, scratch that,. This is looking pretty bearish, so I may try to make some extra profits if it dumps. Added to it at the same entry point.

(Edit: I'm so bad at using this bot, I just updated my position via PM.)
it dumped $150 so far after going up $800

this can go down to $6350 and still be bullish 


when they hit 40k im expecting the opposite of April bgd. sentiment, price action, etc, it's all the same in reverse 
They protect the support of the bullflag

Just protecting profits, entering hedge short. Will cut it quick but expecting some short term down until this gets further resolved, taking my chances after a good profit. Honestly only targeting a 1-2% movement.

Still expecting 6.8-7.3 in the next few weeks.
Pump and dump groups just ruined everything, ffs.
According to Binance tweet a minute ago, it's "system maintenance" [https://twitter.com/binance?lang=en](https://twitter.com/binance?lang=en)
Am I the only one not that nervous based on how they handled the last hack attempt a couple months ago?

Edit: Sorry I can't remember the specific event but I know they handled it really well and reimbursed any account that was affected
Good news I expect panic selling coming soon.
Almost have to short this news
What is the outcome?
fundsu are safu
LOAD ZE DUMP!
You didn't draw a rising wedge.

The wedge he was pointing out has the support line touching $5,800 and $6,300.

Wooo! Thanks for the subscriptions.
I'm trying to decide whether I should rehedge. I'm thinking yes 
And MCO
Yes exactly, I've been watching pumps and dumps over the last 2 days and it's insane. Should I be concerned with this?
Are they different than normal pumps we were used to back in the bull market days?  I haven’t checked their charts yet, I’m on mobile.
They’re all low market cap, low liquidity...ripe for pump and dump.  I’d imagine someone is feeling frisky and wants to play with the holiday low volume.  

Edit: never mind...2,000,000% is a little much.  For fucks sake, this is my nicest entry is months.  This is why we can’t have nice things.  
Gotta just be more idiots that got their login phished -- the phishers add API access during the window their phished session is active and then just wait to pull the trigger on the whole scam.  Even if Binance stops the withdrawal, I assume they put in massive 100x shorts on BitMEX right before they  fire off the attack so they can profit even if they can't get the loot withdrawn.
It's just humans being humans, not an elaborate scheme.

edit: you guys really don't have a brain ...
Nothing may have changed, but plenty happened.
I don't consider this as a Bart, yesterday there were some 100$ movements up and down also. The volume was also low, a Bart normally has high volume (higher than the normal for the time frame).

This can still go sideways and drop like a rock (i might hedge my long if this goes to test 6650 again just in case)
That is one mighty fine looking bull flag on the hourly.
TA was useless when we went from 1200$ to 6K and More

It seems to me that a lot of bottom shorters having a mental breakdown and as a result come here and shitpost. 
There will always be bullish comments in this sub on any reasonable DCB.   Of course they don't reference TA, because TA says something they don't want to acknowledge.
Why should TA back every sentiment change?
While there has been censorship on r/bitcoin and it deserves proper criticism this is just tasteless. Their whole motive is basically tricking people and spreading misinformation :(
[deleted]
If iam not mistaken discussing the ETH/BTC ratio is accepted here and the rest of the ratios are not but could be discussed in the altcoin thread
I believe it will take at least 3 or 4 hours. It usually creates a "tunnel" before moving again. This can just go sideways all day to cool rsi a bit if the next move is up. If this barts down, any time is good in terms of rsi. 
A random guess or is there any useful indicator of a Bart? Thanks!
Crypto World Problems...
🤷🏻‍♂️ 🦋 Is this a correction?

A lot of it is generated using Ant-miners, so could be! :)
Correction?? 50 - 100$$??
I figure the correction has got to be at least TWO TIMES that size.
Pure gold 
:) you are overloading my brain capacity
A correcception.
I’m confused why you’re not setting a limit order at your target price?
OCO orders sir, that is your solution. One cancels the other. A stop and a limit
The solution is to set both a stop loss and a take profit order once you have entered the trade. Most exchanges support either one-cancels-the-other (OCO) orders or have "reduce only" functionality that prevents your orders from opening positions.
I have heard people talking about this before but never seen it happen... sellers piled in looking for liquidity. Buy wall was removed. Price tanked a little bit.

Edit : ok tanked a fair amount lol
I shared the same info, and deleted my comment after I started getting a ton of downvotes. Something fishy was def going on with SYS after someone managed to flash pump it from $0.20 to $635,000 (a \~300 million percent increase). I doubt this led to a 7000 btc dump, but someone definitely made a big profit from clearing out the order book like that.

You 'called the bottom'...after unsuccessfully 'calling the bottom' at numerous points on the way down over the past weeks/months... 

Your comment history doesn't lie.

Another user of this sub who has a remarkable ability to predict things after they have happened also. 

Lol.
This market has never bottomed with a rounded bottom, so it's highly unlikely that was the bottom. 

I do say if it's going to bottom in such way, it would need to spend weeks around the same price moving sideways, otherwise I'm not buying the bags of people who bought above 8k wanting to be rich quick. 
Posting your positions after the fact isn't cool man ;)

Fool of a Took! This is a serious journey, not a hobbit walking-party. Throw yourself in next time, and then you will be no further nuisance.
Somehow one must suspect that you have a "unique" definition of a reversal.
Shhhh... don't tap on the glass... at least not *that loudly*...
I mean at this point the next bull market is probably as close to release as the last season of Game of Thrones. Might as well just wait around.
Yup, the ol' reach around.
I prefer a 7 to a 3 (or 8 to a 2) in the ones digit on orders above that I want to encourage to fill. Thinking that the tens are small barriers.  Inverse for a stop.
Honestly seems to not be dropping at all, maybe everyone is scared it will just go right back up if they sell like I am.

7000 BTC withdrawn.
Hacks are a good thing for Bitcoin. The fact that people will steal it proves Bitcoin really has value. Banks get robbed all the time and you don't see people running around crying that the sky is falling because of it.
the guy can't exactly sell that BTC at exchanges, so my guess is he'll have to find someone on the black market to take the risk or will trade it for monero or some other untraceable coin 
It ain't shit compared to Gox which turns out to have just been a wonderful opportunity to get the money of the future at a discount. 
My gox=$450 million lost.  Binance hack just now is 7,000BTC or $45 million lost.  This doesn't look good friends.  
.... and exactly why are we headed to 7K?
What's the point of closing a long and then immediately reopening one?
It is for this very reason why the Chinese policy makers were so vigilant last year in cracking down on BTC; capital flight. 

And to your point, the local currency - Renminbi - has fallen rather steeply over the past month as highlighted in the link below.

Hmm, a sex machine at a massage parlor...

Okay dude let's not go too crazy here 
Can I ask why you decided to buy when you heard of the hack? I would've stayed in tether like you said later on.....Usually hacks lower prices since rumors and fear and also the hackers selling it for fiat or monero (still dumping either way). 
You have bigger balls than me on this one. I don't think the Coinbase news is going to move the price much if any. Still 8k would be nice but Im closing my shorts a little lower.
From the micro perspective, I expect a slow correction into the low 6500 range to cool RSI on the lower time frames prior to the next leg up. 

With the Independence Day holiday coming up this week in the U.S., I expect the next move sometime in the next 48-72 hours. 
If there are a lot of suckers to fuel this rally beyond 6800 (?) I could see this playing out as you described. 
>with Coinbase announcing their Custody platform and rumors of the SEC approving crypto ETFs in the wind

What are these "rumours of the SEC approving crypto ETFs" that you speak of?

Have any sources?
Yes, I'm keeping an eye on that as well. But there's also a bull div on the daily that's currently in play over a slightly longer timeframe.
Right, a gigantic, half-a-year-long symmetrical triangle broke down, is still below the breakdown range *and* is forming an additional descending triangle-looking-thing. But yeah, things are 120% bullish at this point in time.

How progressive...
You think we will drop to 4670? I was thinking 6350 at most 
Firstly, what settings are you using?
You sold your house , wife and kids and went short?
I call 6600 in 2 hours
there we goo. breking down from the fcking wedge
I would do nothing here. 6580 has to be the worst possible entry in our current range/formations. If you're going to long, target 6500ish and cut if 6400 falls. If you're going to short, wait for 6650-6700 and cut if 6800 falls.

This is dead center no man's land. 
EDIT: Sorry, totally violating rule 1.

I don't think your 'poll' will help you much. You haven't presented the options fairly and without bias, and judging by the tone of your writing I think you're a tad too emotionally driven in making it.
Shorting is usually a bad idea, but it's an awful idea here with attempted Bart after attempted Bart getting rejected.

You have 2 posts with 2 different sets of opening and closing numbers 
what does *bitcoin* have to do with hacks?
The average public just sees “hack” and it becomes part of a cloud in their mind of BTC which is like a nebulous collection of ideas that contain a lot of bad red flag warning signs for the non-speculative investor (I.e. most people)
agreed.  When I first started investing (in general) about 18 months ago, I passed over crypto because all I really knew about Bitcoin was Mt. Gox, and was under the impression that you could lose your Bitcoin at any time, regardless of care.
> Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former.
The first bull flag was textbook legit and sexy with downward slope fighting the trend. The current one not appealing at all. Better risk/reward to buy the inevitable retracement down from first attempt to break 6.7-6.8k imo. 
I agree. This could be a good short-term short scalp to the low 6500s to cool RSI. I don't expect it to go lower than that in the short term, however, so protect yourself. 
Little? This past week has seen the largest rise that we have seen out of any other week in the past few months imho.
Yes of course it can be sustainable.  A pullback is likely at some point, but reasonable chance it gets pumped higher first.  CME Whales could have long positions this time.
Yes it can sustained. 
When it will be 24h or more in the 6600+ range.
We waited two weeks for a bounce, could be two weeks for a dip. 'not sustainable' had too much weight put on it.
6450 is a break*down* of the rising wedge. Rising wedges are inherently bearish to begin with, and I'm not sure why you'd long there. Honestly targeting 6500ish for a long and planning to bail under 6450 makes a lot more sense in case it breaks up, but shorting the top (6700-6730) and cutting early on a breakup is the best way to play that.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/C7wlxS2i/
They’re not dropping tho from earlier, it seems like a minor correction more than a drop. I think if we hold this we are in for a gain 
Alts gained like crazy the past few days, I'm honestly surprised they are keeping the gains right now.

Loom still up 33% for the week, SNT up 29%, ZRX up 32% etc.
I agree. But I also think we will get more down before we start to go up on the long term lines
Sounds like you feel uncomfortable in your long position, and you try to induce fomo. Why do you care so much what other traders are doing with ***their*** own money? We get it, there hasnt been any relief rallies in like nearly 2 months, but still it could also just mean that they are luring you to buy into their shorts. Or simply those walls can get easily pulled, just as they have been pulled a lot of times already, from our first bounce at 6100 back to 6800, such buy walls were also present, and we still got below 6k levels.    
I personally appreciate your insight, but you are getting more and more agressive proving your point to everyone here.
Hmmm...when has this happened before?
Or maybe it's attracting sellers with delicious liquidity, just to pull the rug out? Though I generally see that behavior for narrow range walls.  What you are pointing at just feels like a well populated order book to me.  (I really don't know what to make out of order books, it bites me in the ass almost every time, except for alt coins on lower volume exchanges when it's clearer how many players there are working a spread)
What exchange?
What chart?
Could be someone using bitcoin to purchase something internationally (grain, property, merchandise). Happens all the time. Doesn’t mean that a 4000 Buy is a whale accumulating in hopes of a price increase.
[removed]
Yes the price dropping always indicates strong "bulls".
Fake News. Don't listen to the above. Long from 6300 for weeks + big-azz long-term hodl stack = lovin' life. Shorting Bitcoin is not a good way to make money. In fact, it's a great way to lose money, and the more you short, the more you lose, as the Great Bitcoin Bear Rug of Early 2018 is about to learn the hard way.
x100 long please
For most of 2018, X5XX has been a risky place to enter anything. 
I sat on my hands waiting for the first bart to come back down.  Then missed the second.  I saw btrash start pumping last night again and said fk it and went long....  I feel like I’m playing roulette right now.  
Sure
Yes
That's what I did
Oh gypsy, you disappoint.
The market is toxic, I was thinking earlier that people have become their positions, as a sort of identity, particularly if that person is in a lot of profit or underwater.

Starting to look more like a proper bull flag than a Bart flag.

I'm not impressed
Seems like it was really not all that effective. We will see what happens though. 
Is this 2014? 
> first major nation “banning” Bitcoin

Which one?
Bull bear testing? Nation banning Bitcoin? .......Ahh fuck it.
Can you elaborate how a major nation bans 12-word seed words from circulation?
What would be exciting is to see all your giant  shorts get completely rekt for good so we can move up again. 
So you are looking for "buddies" to join?

Well I'm long and awaiting to see if we can be more then 24H above the 6600+. Then I will ADD. ( park it in my cold - ledger ) 

But OK, I hope you find others to short....... And indeed it will be exciting to see.

Depends if 6513 will hold https://imgur.com/a/GmU3b2N
Because they want those sweet, sweet tendies.  Plain and simple.

Is this just a survey or is structured like a research paper where conclusions are being drawn? 

I only ask because the study is "open access" and as someone who has published scientific research before, I have been advised to steer clear from using research that was published via open access.

Anybody can publish using open access and can present research that hasn't been  peer reviewed (people of the same competency as you in terms of academics review your research).

A lot of times open access is viewed as cash grabs because they will accept any research as long as you pay their fee (people with bad research usually take this route due to non acceptance from academic publishers)

Not saying this is the case, just something to keep in mind for everyone
Because they enjoy watching their value plummet when the coins hit market?
scammers - researchers dont do raffles - dont click

edit: Never heard of a researcher doing a raffle (you need board approval for payment and that would freak them out). However it could be a unique case. I once caught a virus that stole some of my hotwallet stuff after clicking on a link here, so be careful with weird links
Because people don't understand what they're investing in and don't do their due diligence. They buy in hopes to sell higher. They don't build a case from first principles because if they did that they would realize that it makes zero sense to use a blockchain for X. People are just trying to become rich on unwarranted hype. Plain and simple. 
Are you saying they aren't carbon-based?
We bounced off our ascending support line. Over a 100$ bounce.

Seems pretty normal to me

https://www.tradingview.com/x/MDSsJ8o6/
Am I misunderstanding the situation? This is not a SYS coin issue, right? Its just that the Binance hacker chose to sell the stolen BTC to his SYS sell wall
It's tough to say... but SYS wasn't really a very popular coin to begin with...

I imagine SYS will be blacklisted/removed/killed essentially from every single exchange in existence.

I imagine that the crypto market overall will take a hit... probably down to ~$6,200.

And then I imagine this will all blow over while I finish my next pint in my favorite pub and we'll be shooting for $7k sometime early next week.
a lot
\-12 downvotes, and i was right. typical daily discussion lol
I wouldn't consider it bullish, but yeah, the market's response (at least so far) hasn't been nearly as bad as I would have expected.
Isn’t the place on lockdown currently? 
Long?
My eyes bleed from stupidity every time I see something like this. And if we go bellow 1k you will just move back the date another year and say HEY LOOK WE ARE IN A BULL MARKET.
It looks so nice without Btrash and EOS 😔
Same guy predicting everything was going to 3k and 6300 was massive resistance about an hour before the BGD. Also has a bullish flair?

I can be your friend.

You have a lot of BTC, right?
There has to be *some people* that get in at/near the bottom however. I would suggest that in a typical bubble build up more and more people jump on the wagon per the saying, and it definitely peaks near the ATH.

I'm the sort of guy that scrolls past these dressed up 'hey guys I'm bullish because my friend/uncle/grandma/dog wants to buy' stories, but obviously when it happens to you, you gotta wonder if it's some sort of signal. 

FYI they're all currently meme-ing about who has the most ETH in our group chat.
That was awesome. I increased my BTC stack by 15% by selling BCD that weekend.
The distinct lack of conversation around it suggests to me they weren't hugely aware of the existence of said shitcoins.

I agree, I'm trying to play longer time frames right now. That's why I want to hold this long until I can tell this was just a DCB or medium term trend reversal. But yeah, my best case scenario would be 8-9K and open a big short from there a la /u/sloppysynapses 
> Max bullish scenario would be a 10k double-top

Did something just happen to make your position more appealing? ;)
I'm willing to bet that there will in fact be a significant short squeeze at a break of 10K. 

The extremity of ranges is precisely where squeezes are the most significant. 
it's happened before several times...go check. $7.2 to $6.4-6.8 was a long squeeze @ 40k longs at the beginning of April. 

the long squeeze is what brought us down to $6k
I don't think you can really chart the number of coins in leveraged positions.

Thanks for the additional info. 
Very good point.
Tell that tho switzerland..
Big. Green. Dildo.
Very true, in the short term, on these low vol plays no one truly has a grasp on the movements. 


You seem both knowledgeable and rational. Following your account. 
True, but I believe sell volume being weak is more bullish than buy volume being weak is bearish. This is yet another signal that all weak hands have already sold out and we might be in a period of accumulation before a true bull run. Money will flow back, but it takes time. 


Edit: Essentially it might signal a return to the long-term bull trend of BTC.
I actually highballed it. The highest well-accepted Fibonacci retracement level of 78.6%. I will edit my post now. The high end should have been 80, not 90. Thanks for the question.

The slope thus far is suggesting a massive cup and handle, similar to the previous bear market. If so, we should have months of very low volatility in the 5,000s followed by another bubble. 
thanks, appreciated!

'lol' all you want sunshine, I have had multiple trend lines, not on that chart otherwise it would be too cluttered.

Nah m8, a good party for escapism reasons is always nice
Let's see how legit this is. 

The technical target should be around $5,800-$5,900.
This motherfudder
I hope not, or that’s $45.5 million worth of bitcoin waiting get be dumped on the market...
but this was a double upwards Bart, this doesn't follow my predicted way!
they only been right for 7 months so :) 
mostly it was just to get that stupid joke out... I'm the same, I'm watching for the 6520 region 
I agree. I think we'll see 68xx before going down further.
Do you still expect 4k long term?
ETH USD just had a double bottom on 15 min GDAX
For now this doesn't really want to drop below 6.6. don't know what to think about that.
Wicks don't count imho... too little time/volume traded to say that the market really had a chance to scoop anything up around $5,700.
I also think so, volume and the width of the wedge seem so wide.
I would still be short term bullish to a drop around 6450 and rebound from there. But what I would really like to see is an attempt at 6750 and 6600 holding as support.
Are you in position 
I know it’s not even close to completing

Hence me mentioned it 3 times and making a disclaimer. 

Yes it’s a reversal pattern, we are in an uptrend as of now and a completion of this would reverse the trend, aka a break under $6300
There is a lot of resistance in the $6800-$6900 range... if we're able to break and stay above, it'll be a buy signal.  My guess is we'll get kicked off at least once before moving through... and I'll try to play those bounces.
6750 - 6800 is going to be tough to break, but if we manage it then we'll start to see signs of a proper reversal
You beat me to it
he opened a short to hedge against his cold storage, essentially he's protecting the cash value of his BTC stack at the point he opened his short, so he's forfeiting gains from a move up, but he's making money on the way down which makes up for lost value in BTC due to price dropping. He'll gain BTC if we move down, but BTC will be worth less. He'll lose BTC if we move up, but BTC will be worth more.
sauce?
basically no chance of a PoS switch.
LOL! ETH shills assured me several times that Casper was arriving first half of 2018. Now it's the second half and you're telling me 2019?

No.

I have been seeing this "c&h forms during an uptrend" for like two months now. No it doesn't, why would you think that?

I keep switching from seeing droopy / perky BTC here, seems to be in the hands of the rich guys now if they want to poke at resistance, but the little guy doesn't seem to be making a bullish case.

At the moment it looks very dumpy. (edit: maybe not?)
I agree, those are good implementations. Also, any withdrawal above 500 BTC should be manually approved within 24 hours or less. Not a lot of people have 500 BTC.
I'm shocked that they don't have that...  


Same with those flash crashes that liquidated people before. (The Krakening and $0.10 ETH on Gdax)
Yeah it is really unimaginable to me why those exchanges making hundreds of millions haven't implement the basic securities that a layman could think of.
Not that much... but we are getting there
Lolol
T&A
I don't think its low probability that central banks, governments and institutions will start holding Bitcoin reserves, just like they hold gold. If Bitcoin is a better SoV and is frictionless, boarderless, censorship resistant, cheap to store, cheap to transact, backup-able, etc. etc. etc. then its only natural that central banks would more-or-less be forced by the market to back their fiat with at least a fractional reserve of Bitcoin.

Otherwise people will dump their fiat from Bitcoin and the fiat would undergo hyperinflation. Bitcoin is like a hedge against central banks and central banks will be forced to re-work their strategies to prevent people from jumping ship.
The problem there was not having a single currency, rather having a single interest rate. The southern European countries were suddenly able to borrow at much lower interest rates than they were used to, and they abused this position by overborrowing.
It's not delusional to speculate on the impacts of a very low-friction, decentralized digital currency serving to hedge against manipulative central banking policies. In fact, central banks other than the Fed would probably appreciate something like Bitcoin because right now USD is the world's reserve currency, which creates an obvious power imbalance. 

Bitcoin is a global, low-fee, censorship resistant tool for citizens to arbitrage the effects of one central bank versus another. It's kind of unavoidable and inevitable if you ask me. 
[deleted]
If people have a censorship resistant and low-cost way hedge against manipulative monetary policies, then they will work to do so. This creates a hyper-inflationary problem for manipulated fiat currencies. People will want to hold Bitcoin instead if Bitcoin is a better store of value. If nobody is holding fiat, then central banks are severely undermined, which in the view of many AnCaps and Libertarians (I am neither) is a great thing.

I made roughly 41%  on my VEN stack buying SYS Earlier. If I held on another 20 minutes I would have made nearly 300%+ but It’s risky business. 
That’s some uber bullshit 
Pump inc? LOL
It was the VIA hack and they reversed all the trades and the hackers actually lost coins on the hack somehow lol so it didn't even work.
They did handle it very well.

C. Zhao was tweeting during the whole fiasco, updating everyone on every step and possible solution.

I was impressed. 
They've professionally handled the worst possible situations quite well I'd say

It was requested by someone. 

Your winning streak is catching people's attention, so you have all the credits for having your own channel.
*Puts on tinfoil hat and takes a seat*

People could be pumping a dumping these alts then potentially dumping the BTC. Possibility the SYS pump and dump had something to do with all the BTC dumped on binance.

Also, if this really is an API issue and Binance is getting “ Hacked “ , I expect some panic/panic selling when Binance comes out with a statement 
If you have a wallet or ledger Xfer off.

Better safe than sorry broski 
About 3-6 months ago Binance experienced an API hack and it pumped the coin VIA. 

Looks very similar to SYS, But Binance has yet to come out with a statement 
Would the 2FA protect you from that by the way? I'm not worried about getting phished because I have Binance login bookmarked and also I always check the URL, but in the 0.01% chance that I got phished, would 2FA protect me from that?
You're trying to tell me pumping SYS to 96BTC per coin wasn't a scheme?
There was definitely some volume.
Volume profile doesn’t fit.

It’s also more bart flag looking. No slope and it’s just ugly 
the ridiculous bear divs @17 and 19k were useful. 
Comparing this bear market to a time period where it consecutively made higher lows and higher highs for months?

I don't see how people think your comment is valid
It was useless to you, but not to those who used it to profit.
you mean underwater longs? I mostly see bull bias
Counts for Bearish also... so you think Bears only use TA?
The "censorship", as far as I can tell, is mostly just normal sub moderation. /r/bitcoin is under constant attack from alt shills, including and especially BCash shills. 

Everytime someone says "I was censored from /r/bitcoin" and then I see what they were banned for, it's *obviously* because they were trolling, spreading misinformation, shilling, completely off-topic, etc. 

The narrative that its censored and because of this people are tricked into thinking big blocks are problematic is just ridiculous. It's just another tool BCashers use to make themselves seem relevant instead of like a dying minority chain alt. 
Yeah I just realized that this happened at least a month ago. 

Unbelievable really. A minority chain that's being fraudulently marketed by Bitcoin.com, CNBC and a variety of other corporations and the sub owner wants to claim that the consensus chain is compromised.

Good lord! You can't make this shit up/
And here I thought I was just going to spend this afternoon chilling with my buddy watching GOT. Shame on me for thinking some space-altering stuff wasn't going to happen. 



Anyway, congrats bears, looks like you all might have gotten a nice surprise today. Sucks for anyone who lost funds. 
This is a pretty great meme dude :))
Because if I set a limit order, I can't set a stop loss order.
Thanks. At least now I know it exists. Except on the exchange I use.
It was 11 coins each at 635k, plus a thousand or so at 1 BTC and ya the rest of the order book. Wow.

How do you mean by rounded bottom? You could argue this looks awfully similar to the 6500 bottom from April.   


Also I'd be wary of making decisions based on historical events, whilst I like using them as a guide using them as an absolute seems like a bad idea to me personally. 
Of course it's highly unlikely that was the bottom for the next year or two.   It is still greater than 50% probability that price will be below $5700 this year.
I get myself involved in so many positions posting them all would be a pain in the ass. Like the most recent range (past 36 hours) I got in and out of a good 8... Probably going to sit on this one for awhile.

Also I'm just going by the same system I've been posting in here since 2013 so fuck ya'll new folk and your fancy ways. Maybe I should come around into the fold though. 
>Throw yourself in next time, and then you will be no further nuisance.

If they had 7k BTC “ Stolen “ from them... 

That would cause some massive panic 
Very bullish. BTC not on exchange = BTC that can't be lent/stolen/sold/shorted by clueless a-holes.
You also don't see banks telling customers to get bent after it happens. There is a significant difference in a bank and crypto loss.
Therefore bank robberies are good for USD?

[EDIT: Not sure why the down vote - if crypto hacks are good for Bitcoin because they prove BTC has value, how does it not follow that bank heists are good for USD by demonstrating that fiat has value? If I'm missing something please let me know.]
It's funny because just today I was reading about how btc isn't a fungible currency because newly minted and "clean" coins are actually worth more.
Why can’t he trade it at exchanges though? It’s already off of Binance afaik. 
Yeah I talked to someone earlier about cryptocurrency and they said exactly what just happened that’s why people are to scared to get into it and I was telling him how much better things are getting but this isn’t looking for bitcoin. 
So, 1/10 the loss when the market is 100x bigger. Doesn't seem that serious to me. Didn't another exchange lose like $30m last week just before the pump?
That's a 2014 bear market parallel we could do without right now.
You have a short pos..got it.
Thanks for your concern buddy.
if bitcoin goes 10x to $66,000, i would be gladly inclined to compare binance hack to mt'gox.
Another way to put it... Mt Gox lost ~700k BTC and Binance lost ~7k BTC... it's 100x better in some respects.
Because whether we are still in a bear market or beginnings of a bull run, we are due for a small run up to the 7500-8000 range.
New to leverage, I know the can just be combined - it's more symbolic. Never closed a position before!
He said it was basically trigger finger, but an ordinary reason could be if the other one was closed before the little drop sensing weakness, and the recent bump back up gave him confidence that he won't get a lower chance to reenter. 

And I should add - quite importantly - that what this actually means for BTC is far from certain. 
Purchasing foreign businesses and land is a much bigger problem for China.

China will continue to make promises and then not keep them. That's how government works.
>Can I ask why you decided to buy when you heard of the hack?

I wanted to get out of binance ASAP since it was sketchy and the exploit might use my funds to buy shitcoisn too. Luckily it didnt affect me but the BTC stuck in withdrawal processing is losing some of my profits. 

I usually withdraw 10% then wait for confirmation then withdraw 10% again to avoid sending to the wrong address. But i panicked and tried to GTFO binance right away with 50%.

I might just try to view it as closing my non-margin short (selling) in order to cope while staring at naked chick. Pretty sure my dick wont get hard though since i wont stop thinking about the binance fiasco but still i want to look at a naked body.

Thus the stops along the way up. The wrong FUD could change everything, but you can’t plan for those things. Right now I have stops at break-even just in case. 
Suckers?

I think it might be better to put a stop loss for long below 6,360. At least this is where I have 10k downtrend line right now. What do you think?
I tried to present my question of "would you bet long or short at this point" pretty fairly. I'm simply asking if you came to a fork in the road, which route would you go? Long/short. 

It's simply a question to gauge people's opinions. I just want to know what others would do if they were a degenerate gambler and couldn't help but trade today.
Shorting has actually *usually* been a good idea for the majority of 2018. I disagree that we're seeing "bart attempts" (wtf is this anyway?), but I do agree that shorting 6560 is not a good risk/reward scenario. 
what does *money* have to do with banks?
What does that mean? The hacks are of exchanges, not Bitcoin itself. Obviously, Bitcoin security procedures are a work in progress and not great at the moment (if these exchanges are actually being hacked, many could easily be inside jobs). That doesn't mean that people are stupid to want to acquire Bitcoin. Exchanges just need to get regulated and security protocols need to be standardized, tested and implemented with great care and expertise.
Or to short 6.7-6.8k :)
The wedge would just need to be re-drawn to take into account the move down. It also could just be a long squeeze before pushing on up. 

Rising wedges are bearish, but we need to complete 5 touches on support and resistance before we validate it as a pattern. 
Yeah, the stops on my long from 5900 are set at 6440.  The wicks on this leg up aren’t forming a nice flag,  like last the last one, and if we hit those wicks from the last leg I’m out for now.  Forming an ugly rising wedge.  Who knows, I could see this range for another day and bart up on low volume over the holiday.  Gut feeling says we’re wanting to test the 7000 range but, I’m not willing to lose profits on this nonsense.  
Didn't you sell all your BTC for a major loss assuming it would never recover?
maybe, maybe not, the moment of truth will be $8500.
Ever hear the one about the pot and the kettle?
everyone here knows I jump from one position to the next and  I don't get married to positions. 

And yes I now believe this will be going up, at least in the short term. Will this be the big reversal that takes us back to ATH? Only time will tell
ETH


the same exact scenario happened when it started going from $300 to $1400 

first you had massive hidden buy walls absorbing thousands of sales. 

then you had massive visible buy walls just sitting there absorbing sells

then you had these buy walls start getting moved up. Like 5000 BTC buy order appearing 10% above current price. 

and then the bull market caught its legs and people started placing their buy orders above the buy walls. And before long you had a bull run
thats the thing, those walls aren't being sold into. So that means the sellers aren't really there

Not sure if you're trolling. Shorting crypto this year has allowed users to nearly triple their trading stacks. It's the most consistently profitable way to make money during a bear market.

Yes, our intention is to write a research paper and draw conclusions.

Thanks for asking, I was a bit unclear: Of coure we intend to publish these papers in peer-reviewed studies in the field of entrepreneurial finance. However, we will also pay the "open access" fee afterwards, so that the study is freely available.

We do not intend to publish this in one of the open access journals you refer to.
Open access simply mean they are available without a paywall not necessarily that they are of lower quality and not peer-reviewed( Ex: Nature Comm. is entirely open access). Unfortunately this is a really damaging misconception because we should really be pushing for open access to be the standard so the public can access the research freely instead of cash grab paywalls that require you to buy a subscription just to read one article. 

???? Doing a donation or a raffle is what is used to incentivize participants. Usually Amazon coupons are distributed.
Ofc this is our own money that is used, not university money
How else are blockchain developers supposed to earn money?  The blockchain is supposed to remove the middleman but if you are becoming the blockchain middle man and skimming off the top.  As an example, replacing WU with a blockchain but still charge the same rates as WU.  That would be pointless right?  Or replace ebay with the blockchain but still take 15% of the sale price. So how are these organizations supposed to be rewarded?  If anyone has a better business model please share.
I'm not saying whether this is valid or not, but you should know that university researchers regularly compensate subjects whether it be cash, gift cards or raffles, it's just used as incentive not some nefarious way to steal your private key. They literally give you an official uiversity email you can easily verify with...

Didn’t that happen with BTC at one point? Like in 2010 or something. The blockchain had to be rolled back a few blocks and then it was forked afaik.
Non-sense, millions of people are realizing the life changing power of the tech at the exact same time.  Frankly it's a miracle on some level.
Surely they have insurance to cover them in this case. They just took a 45million dollar hit.
Adding to my point. They are just supplementing buying pressure to minimize the different whey they go back live. So less people are irate. 
Okay I get it... You are short and the price does not go down as fast as you wish. If you can, you need to add much more shorts to move the price down faster /s. I don't believe the conspiracy of exchanges artificially keeping the price up. 
Often they vanish suddenly, followed by a big drop.
Yes ..just look at all those buys right now
I still remember him arguing with me when I was panic calling him, screaming for him to sell at ~$3 per xrp.  What finally sunk in was when I told him to work out the market cap.... until then, nothing registered.

I'm talking short-medium term man. Why are you always so maximalist.
This is not confirmed on longer timeframe

https://www.tradingview.com/x/qkaoyXEM/
I dont have the exact date (I'll post it here later when I have the chance), but I was referring to the week after we saw those BGDs from that news

Edit: June 6th
What's going on now with the Bart retrace is exactly what I was talking about in my post. Pay attention to the volume and how it behaves
No, not at all. If your entry is an arbitrary but small amount above resistance and you intend you close at break-even, there is substantial incentive to increase your position as that resistance approaches.

If I'm short 5 BTC at 6636 and I plan to close at a break of 6610, I stand to "make" $130, less fees. Negligible return by percentage. If I double that to 10 BTC at 6590 and make my new average 6613, I can still exit at 6610 and give up that negligible return, but if 6600 holds and we drop here, I've now doubled returns. 

I very often set adds 0.25%ish below my stops assuming it makes sense contextually with resistance lines. 
Yeah I don't understand people doing TA on this stuff
[removed]
> I believe sell volume being weak is more bullish than buy volume being weak is bearish. 

Sounds like another bullish fantasy narrative, but whatever gets you through the day.
But the 71% you quoted is over the entire span of BTC price. i.e. the 100% retracement would be $0.

I don't think historical bear markets of other commodities routinely crashed 80% or 90% of their total value. I mean it does happen sometimes but it's not exactly ordinary as far as I know. 


lol
It's trackable via the Blockchain. All it needs to do is be blacklisted. 
Judging from the history, nobody ever dumps the hacked money. The hodl it.
It would probably be converted to XMR or similar, so no paper trail on it.  But yes the BTC would be sold to another coin or fiat, eventually.
I think the bear market will continue until we bounce off the 4800 range. Beyond that, I can't say.
Right, it's been a while since a support line was respected this decisively without any fake-downs (yet at least). The average volume is also creeping up on the 6-12H timeframes...
Btc seems to be on a flag while eth is gaining on the ratio. Eth scares me more because it looks like a Bart setup and not a regular flag.
Hoping for a test at 6750 so eth can test the trend line from 830 (and i can bail on my long and re-evaluate ) 


Ok, you can call it a double bottom at whatever price you want... $8000 if you choose.  But the price dropped to the $5700s a couple of times.
That's why I'm saying it all depends where we stop dropping. There are couple of scenarios that could play out from here.
0.3x net short from above 6.6. basically hedged.
No argument from me here. That very well could happen. Best of luck. 
Vitalik mentioned it in an interview or devcall meeting a couple months ago. Don't recall the source, but I keenly noted it.

I mean to be fair, is anything in crypto up and running 100% with zero issues to resolve?
I thought I read that somewhere. I'll try to find the source but happy to stand corrected.

EDIT: Just googled and you're right. Can precede reversal in downtrend and continuation in uptrend.
IIRC (it has been many months since I've had any coins on Binance), the standard unverified limit is 2 BTC per day, verified is 200, and higher than 200 requires manual verification.
:( sucks having discipline huh lol. My Discipline caused me to close a short from $10060 at $10075 :)
German and Italian bond rates were different.
> The southern European countries

And Ireland
I.e. why Russia is so after it. Good thing, imo.
What proportion of people depend on government money? Either through public sector jobs or welfare or tax breaks or private jobs funded by government spending? 

In many a place it's beyond 50%. They'll never get the chance to dabble in crypto no matter how much they want to. Government issued currency has a giant captive audience.  
think you responded to the wrong comment :P
Yeah, it’s still extremely immoral and to be honest, I think Binance took the right approach suspending trading. The question is: how long? 


And also will they close accounts of people who participated? I didn’t join a pump group but I did manage to catch the MANA pump earlier, I got lucky.
Love it. Thanks man
DO IT!!! Sell the bottom! Give your moneez to smarter people who deserve it more than you do! Lolol
Bear run coming?
The lows are being ignored here though. 

Am I missing something? lol
Thanks again, I appreciate you setting it up for me, and whoever for requesting it.

By the way, is there any chance a pushbullet channel could be set up for u/mandy7 as well? I think it’s only fair.  I was surprised to see there wasn’t one set up when I started following certain traders. I assume I’m not the only one interested in tracking it, right?
That's my thought too. At least worth hedging.
Sucks, I have a few coins on Binance that I'm waiting for a mainnet swap, and I also have a trading stack there. But I think you're probably right, I should move them off.
Yes the VIA hack was extreme though.  10,000% increase.  I’m not seeing that in the coins you listed yet.
Nope :(  This hack was so devious the first time because it gets around 2FA protection.  The phishing page not only captures the login, but also the 2FA one time password so the attackers can get in for a limited window and enable API access.   
   
   Also, checking the URL isn't enough unless you are really careful -- the last time this hack happened it was with a URL using non-english characters that are almost identical to the ones in the name 'binance'  and they even had a dubiously obtained SSL cert to make it look legit.
No, if they setup API access them 2fa is only needed for withdrawal. 2fa auth on every trade would completely defeat the purpose of trading via API.

Edit: if you mean 2fa on login from phished session, then yes, probably should save you.
It really depends on the attack. If you were on a phishing site and you logged on + gave your 2fa key at the time, what's to stop them from using the key with your credentials? They wouldn't be able to withdraw your funds but they'd definitely be able to use them to fulfil their sell orders via API access
If someone paid that much for 1 obscure SYS, it s not a scheme, it is irrational greedzeburance.
It's in no way tied to why the others are pumping. You're conflating issues with a tinfoil hat.
Yeah I agree, we've seen a couple of double barts before (intially starts with a bullflag, then on the second flag pole, price starts to sag and retrace roughly 40-50% of the pole. Still too early to say for sure, but def feels similar 
Yep. fine with me. 

Sold at 16K.... 

No TA needed. Just logic investment knowledge for few years in Crypto ( News/ trends / daily check markets etc. )
People who margin trade and short generally have better TA skills than those who just hold and go long.

(And no, this doesn't mean that 100% of the people who are long have never used TA in their entire life. I have to qualify that for the easily confused).

Don't stare at these fuckin charts all day wondering if/when/will Binance make their next announcement?!

Absolutely... but I doubt that many were heavily invested in SYS... I think the largest loser is going to be Binance's hot wallet which they will most likely eat up with their profits and just carry on as usual.

P.S. How the hell are you not caught up with GOT yet?!?! The last season ended before the bull run even took off last year!
Are...are you trading your entire account at once?
What exchange is this? My only helpful suggestion at the moment is to only trade half your balance. 
Some people who posted extremely high sells just got rich as fuck. 
Thanks! You can ask me for more facts any time. Beep boop.

Do note that it obviously does.

lotr quote

it's when they're in the mines of moria and Pippin accidentally knocks over a helmet into a big hole in the ground and it makes a shit ton of noise, which alerts all the goblinz so Gandalf scolds him

also are there any other predictions you've made? 
You’re the most confusing person ever 
We all know what the risk are with using centralized exchanges. 
yes they allow central banks to do their favorite thing :print the robbed money in the form of insurance FDIC.
It's obvious that Bitcoin has to prove it's worth one's salt. I can't help but think your ignorance is deliberate and motivated by your desire to get more Bitcoin for cheap. 
Exchanges would blacklist his address, so he will have to be creative. 
because the exchanges talk to each other, and bitcoin has a public ledger, so if they get a deposit from a blacklisted address, they'll just keep it

thats why the guy will have to be real careful about unloading it...just like the Mt Gox hacker had to be. And everything is a lot more sophisticated these days, so he'll get caught even sooner. 

so he'll have to find a buyer who won't know the coins are stolen, so that means OTC markets. But most likely he'll just sell it on the black market at 10 cents on a dollar(if that)...and then the black market dealer with deal with the hassle of actually selling it 
Ya Bithumb lost $30M and nobody cared. Eventually they recovered ~50%, so total of $15M lost, which they refunded. They were going to refund $30M anyways. 
***throws up hands***
Ah ok...yeah they froze it so maybe you just barely missed it when they froze it...Sorry to hear and hope it's not worse than we think. 
I would call it a sucker’s rally to break against resistance, continuing the pattern, because nothing fundamental has changed. Every time we get here we have had the same discussions, then it fizzles, and for a narrow window of time people start actually talking about what needs to change to drive adoption.

If BTC were to suddenly teleport-bull up to 20k again we would get slammed with delays and fees and everyone would again realize that without LN it isn’t ready for the uses everyone imagines it to be.

We don’t even have the regulatory roadblocks sorted out yet, so until those technical issues are figured out, or roadblocks out of the way, it feels like a sucker’s rally because it is purely speculative and the underlying fundamentals are unchanged. 
Again

The definition of sucker being the people playing musical chairs hoping they aren’t the greater fool left without a chair, digital hot potato. 
Yes, it's called an "article" or something called a "blog".  You can find those on the "Internet" and they often report and reference rumors.
Uh no. I think this could go up further but I also think there is little reason to think that the bottom is in. A so-called ~~relief~~ suckers rally.

If it goes from here back to ATHs, that'd be surprising but not unwelcome. 

Nobody gets harder erections for Bitcoin than me. I would love to see Paul Krugman eat his words as much as anyone else. Though I'd also like to see John McAfee eat his dick. So I guess I'm torn.

As I know CBOE closes 2 days before the 3rd Friday of a month (weird schedule btw), so it is not today, it is 07/18/2018.
Seems simplistic but un-install then re-install it, surprising how many problems that solves.

If that doesn't work then give brave a go
Where would that put us tho?
...
Most people are using the so-called "double crypto settings", which are 20, 60, 120, 30. These are designed to account for 24/7 trading and are doubled to smooth everything out and cause less false signals.
That's really a trader-specific decision. That's a reasonable approach to take, but it's just a different strategy on risk/reward. For someone who is long from under $6K, they have to decide how much paper profit they're willing to surrender in exchange for not getting stopped out prematurely. With 6700 as our top so far, holding all the way back under 6360 could sting. Getting stopped out at 6450 only to have it continue up to 7K could also sting. Each trader has to find a balance of how much unrealized gain they're willing to sacrifice in hopes of greater gains. Finding those key stop levels are important. Just under $6450 makes sense, as it's a clear breakdown of our ascending wedge. Under $6350 makes sense as well, with the downtrend line right there. I don't think either is necessarily better than the other fundamentally, but I also look at the big picture. 2018 trend is down. As such, I would generally be more aggressive with stops on longs. 
You responded kinder than I was going to. Don't know how anyone this year can say shorting is usually a bad idea with a straight face
More bank robberies to come less people to use money.


What it means is that there will always be people that handle their login credentials crypto assets carelessly. In most cases the weakest link is not the service provider, but (a) user(s). 
It doesn't matter that the hacks are not of Bitcoin. It matters what people's perception is of bitcoin as a result (in the short-medium term).
I think a break of 6750 would be incredibly bullish. I'd be surprised to see us test the 7000 range and not break it: https://www.tradingview.com/x/mkWotPoL/  

You've got a sweet entry and intelligent stops. I like it.
7750 might be a bit of a bump in the road before that ;)
I believe one was calling the other black if I remember correctly?
I'm just not blindly ignoring the other possible outcome, which may result in a downside.   
And I'm also in a long position at this very moment. Cheers.
It also happened on BTC repeatedly on each leg down from $10K, albeit not quite this large. There was one of these protecting 7K, though. That didn't go well.
> sellers aren't really there 

Hmm.  Our potential "ascending wedge" that doesn't fit the volume profile (increasing volume), tells me the same too.

there was a wick up to 6800 last night 22:30 (UK time) on Poloniex. Just FYI - do with that what you will. 
Haven't they don't that like 10x now over the past 5 years?
I down vote myself too.
Oh okay so you guys are going to go through a peer review publisher first and then make it available via open access.

I've seen this done before for the reason that you mentioned of making it more widely accessible 
I'm aware of that, I wanted clarification on whether they were going through peer-review first for the reasons I mentioned above. 

Open access has both peer-reviewed and non peer reviewed research, which is why people need to be cautious. 

I know but I've never heard of a raffle that's why I was wary and I edited my post to say it could be true 
Thanks, that's our aim. Is raffle maybe the wrong word? Not a native speaker. 
Thanks!
yeah...when I made my post, I wasn't aware that Binance trading hadn't resumed yet.  That could set off some panic.

No. That's not accurate or relevant.
OK I see you're joking now, but it was a poorly timed one and a bad one at that imho.
That is wild speculation on your part.  Why are the other markets not dropping?

All that statement means is that it could be inferred as an accumulation period, assuming you believe BTC will be worth more than it is during that period in the future. I honestly don't care at all what you believe, I'm simply voicing my perspective here.
Depends on the comparable you are looking at. High-risk tech stocks? Hell yeah. Gold? No. 


Like I said, BTC is completely unprecedented, so all of these comparables have to be taken with that in mind. 
I'm sure the hackers would not sit around, waiting for this to happen.  They would start dumping it quickly and converting it to other coins.   But that could limit the damage.
Is that true (i.e. documented)? Hard to believe... Why go through the trouble of robbing a bank only to never use the proceeds? 
Yup, that flag isn't any textbook continuation pattern, so I'd be careful here.
You're absolutely right.

We hit $5,780 briefly on june 29th and $5,755 on june 24th for about 2 hours... which is why I cut those outliers out of my equation.
Your'e right, it's more like \~$5800 (or $5770-5780 to be more precise). I edited my top-level comment to correct that.
you might want to check that because last time i checked they announced the joint casper+shading v2 plan, which means all the work on the casper contract was wasted. the casper logic will now be implemented in a totally separate "beacon chain". honestly we probably wont see ethereum scaling in our lifetimes
bitconnect, before collapse.
My gripe with Ether is that it's not economically sound. It makes no sense that people are pouring their money into something that is 1. centralized 2. inferior to existing smart contract services and 3. only has one use case: to launch ICO's, which themselves are just shell products, just like Ethereum. 

Even if Ethereum was actually used for real world valuable use cases, the value of its network would be arbitraged by forks and competitors and its token value would necessarily approach its network value (which even in best case scenario is tiny). There is no way in hell that a "utility blockchain" can maintain a monopoly. Beyond that, almost 100% of the proposed utility tokens and use cases are not viable. It doesn't make sense to use a blockchain for a vast majority of these cases and yet coin shills act like they are solving some real world problem. The whole concept is a big sham except for maybe a small handful of legitimate implementations. 

The fact that these gimmicky and destabilizing upgrades are touted as "the future" is just the shit cherry on top. People need to wake up and re-examine all of this from first principles. There is a massive informational asymmetry when it comes to the 1000+ alts and ICO's. People invest and ~~promote~~ shill these projects only to sell at a higher value. They'll say things like "blockchains are the future of ____ " and " ____ is the next Bitcoin" without even *attempting* to build a case. Furthermore they say things like "Bitcoin is only valuable because it was the first. First movers never come out on top, look at Yahoo." or "Bitcoin is blockchain 1.0 tech and is obsolete. EOS is next generation crypto ~~4.0~~ v5.0"

The whole thing is a big sham and will come crashing down just like the dot com bubble. Not everything is best implemented with a blockchain and "upgrades" like Casper or sharding just distract people from the fundamental flaws. 


Bitcoin?
by verification we don't mean checking the person's ID

we mean someone should manually have to approve the withdrawal 
Yeah, pretty shitty. Oh well, can't win them all. At least I closed it in the green lol
That doesn't matter if Bitcoin serves as a better of store of value. 

People will prefer to hold the better store of value and will trade their fiat currencies for a superior SoV asset, especially if that SoV comes with many other benefits, which Bitcoin does. 

This will, in turn, cause central banks to re-work their policies to make their currencies competitive and this ultimately means that central banks will hold Bitcoin reserves to partially back their fiat. 
Meh, I believe we're going to 5k before 100k...

Only thing preventing me from entering a small hedge short is the lack of dump. Honestly it was a pretty weak dump from the giant ascending wedge. 

Im pretty torn on what to do 
SYS briefly increased by over 2,000,000% (I'm estimating).
Look at SYS. 11 coins sold for $634K a piece. 
Google 2fa lasts for ~15 sec...that fast?
That makes sense, thanks. 
I think you cannot make that statement with anymore certainty than you could the inverse. I recognize correlation is not causation, but this is not business as usual. 
There’s no proof, but that’s beyond false. 

MANA was just up 200% as well 
Then, you used TA when you sold at 16K.  The fact that you don't recognize this s hhow ow utterly clueless you are what TA even is.
Isn't it more appropriate to ask BCashers where *Bitcoin* touched *them*? They're the ones throwing fits like they're suffering from abuse and PTSD. 
Same old misinformation. Crazy that you guys are still keeping this up. It must get tiresome to constantly fight the cognitive dissonance.
Haha oh shit man the afternoon already passed. I have seen every season at least twice. I still watched with him, just was also on my laptop. As a guy who does hold some Syscoin, it directly affected me so I had to be on the ball. 



Haha don't even remind me of the bullrun last year! Lol but in all seriousness, we all should make sure to enjoy our lives! Best of luck my dude.
How is that relevant?
why is everyone assuming I'm trading my full balance? lol. I'm only trading 20%. I'm trading on GDAX.
> Some people

Almost certainly the hackers who phished these poor sod's logins and enabled API access.  
I realize not everyone has any idea how to calculate probabilities.  Instead you will say something is definitely happening or definitely not happening.  You don't even know that greater than 50% means "likely".  Sorry but you aren't smart enough to talk to and putting you on block.
Am from New Zealand, have read all the books and watched the trilogy multiple times, hell I jumped off the spot where Aragon gets thrown off the mountain fighting Saurons mounted riders. I just don't get how the reference was relevant?

\> also are there any other predictions you've made?

Yeah, I called the top at like 10K on the last massive rally (before we hit 17k+,) that still makes me cry internally. I'm pretty useless at calling the top, am highly adept at calling the bottom though which is where I make my money catching knives.
7 years of constant price increase from cents to thousands, ever increasing adoption, technological innovation, etc etc and its value still needs to be proven?

Just like USD doesn't need to prove itself via bank robberies, BTC doesn't need to prove itself via exchange hacks. Its value is well established. Hacks are meaningless in the long term, and their short term effect (apart from users of the hacked entity) is only to make Bitcoin seem "unsafe" to the average non-adopter. 
Oh that makes sense. He could send it to another address though right?

Your number seems fabricated. In my experience, otc traders don't much care about blacklisting of coins and will purchase at a 3-5% discount. 
What do you think of the bband w reversal on the 1 day charts which confirmed at $6300? Higher rsi and bullish engulfing candle on the second low to strengthen the signal too. Also we're working on a large triple bottom formed over the past six months. Looking for feedback from a bear

Thanks for your answer. I agree with you. I think I got burned with my stops recently a lot on "barty bitcoin". That is why trying to play a bit more safe. I think in this situation 6,450 stop makes sense. I am not in long though and looking to short if we do another jump to 6,650+ or will stay aside. Don't really want to play against the trend.
he didn't say this year
No, bank robberies are the banks problem. Exchange hacks are the users problems. Which is why my money stays in the bank. Money in bitcoin is considered lost until it’s in my bank. 
If there were constant bank robberies in the States and none in Europe, which direction would capital flow?
It's both.
Yeah, I was being a little vague.  If we get another leg up off his pole, I think we’re heading for the mid 7’s (where our local highs are) like you said.  I’d LOVE to hold this position for a week or two (month preferably) but, I’ve gotten chopped up a lot the last two months and I’m not willing to live with MoonBoy loses.  We haven’t really had any runaways since April so, I’d love to keep a nice entry on one.  
I guess I'm just saying that we don't need to criticise people for having a position and announcing it. Launching into a discussion about risk management is kind of a non sequitur in this case.
Those were on much narrower price ranges in general, and on the steep stairs down from 10k they were at very specific singular price points doing the rug-pulling thing.  This feels less like a wall and more like a broad saturation.  (I'm out of my league here though to discuss order book stuff, even after watching them for years)
Well, I'm sure about that.

I am specifically looking for a source on "international grain, property, etc" transactions that "happen all the time" as OP mentioned.

Basically arsonbunny made a reputation for himself by "analyzing" and posting detailed "analysis" of various things in crypto markets, particularly altcoins and occasionally BTC market movements.

All good so far.  But Gypsytoy has been accusing him of using alt accounts to shill for altcoins, to promote his own writing, and to get into arguments with detractors for months.

Well, /u/gypsytoy was fucking right, he's been using multiple accounts (at least 4 that we know of for certain) to attack people who disagree and promote his own posts/comments.

Why should we care?  I dunno, maybe we shouldn't.  How is it a massive ongoing problem?  Fuck if I know dude.  I'm still rather shocked that gypsytoy fucking called it and it was proven *correct*.

The 12 hr OBV got caught in an interesting situation there by closing at 4 red dojis (or at least 3 dojis) on medium-low volume (relative to the green candles). Because of that, the entirety of the volume on those candles took OBV down quite a lot; if even one had been a green doji instead the div wouldn't be there.

I'd be inclined to file away as just peripheral evidence/analysis *for now* as the divergence isn't confirmed on other time frames and other indicators. Three candles closed $8, $13, and $8 apart, making me attribute it to mostly noise. On the daily, the peak I'd be looking at for divergence is the 6.8k one which would have a hidden bear div *if* price turns around.

Well... He's right. Small selling and buying actually means traders don't want to commit any direction and are waiting for a move. Those who bought lower will want to take profits if this starts to go down, small buying pressure means that nobody want to buy at those prices. It all means that if this goes down it may get extra strength because of lack of buying power.
Yes your perspective is very clear above and not rational at all.
Like I said, you can assign any number to the bottom, but it is nonsense if the price went lower than that.  Btw, I'm sure you know that the top of the bull market was $17,800, don't you.

Because there's no other reason you shouldn't be able to set a stop loss and a limit sell/buy at the same time
I would have called you out for even saying likely, for the same reason.
Because your name has took in it and he saw Took instead of the verb took :P

Ahh okay. Well thanks for being honest haha. Maybe we could combine skills because I can get the top but suck ass at bottoms 
Well put.
You can easily create a script that blocks that address and any address they send it to (they send their money to another address and exchanges automatically block that one too). They might be able to launder some of it through shapeshift or just wait it out. Whoever committed this attack (we aren't sure they did, but lets assume so) probably knows what he'll be doing next. 
yeah but when an address gets black listed, they blacklist all the other transactions originating from that address. 
Yeah and it's easier to buy other crypto to "wash" it or private buyers.
>All exchanges?

No, only the handful of exchanges which participate in the voluntary soft tainting/blacklisting of coins. 
I dunno. Obviously a case could be made either way but bulls should be cautious about fake-outs. Things overall in the space don't look all that great and the behavior of alts does not instill confidence in smart investors. More burn-off is needed, imo, and overall the charts look bad (medium term).
As a short-medium term bear, I am not seeing a triple bottom.  It could possibly be argued as a double bottom from Feb but we still hit lower low than there.  Also, seeing a hidden bear div on the daily with the RSI from both 6/21 and even 6/6.
Brave is a browser.  I’m guessing he meant re-install chrome.  It’s worth a try.  
Brave is a relatively new browser, UI is very similar to Chrome but you get paid in Basic Attention Token if you watch ads.
The crypto settings are 10, 30, 60, 30 - based on the fact that Bitcoin trades all the time versus traditional markets, which don't. The double settings just help smooth out the signals. The first 3 settings are doubled. The last number is not. You can switch between the different settings to see the effect it has. 
Entering anything between 6550-6650 is dicey. I'm currently short from 6636, and I wish I'd been a little more patient, as I could have got 6675 20 minutes after my entry.

It's a bit harder at this stage, now that we've shifted down slightly. Recapturing >6650 would worry me slightly. I'm playing really low leverage here, though, so I can be patient. 
Have you heard of "Not your private keys, not your bitcoin"?

Waw, I will ask you nicely to do some research why bitcoin was invented in the first place. Or just reconsider why you are here.
bitcoin. 
Certainly could be. I'm not seeing much reason for us to break up here, but I'm also very ready to step out of my short if we do.
Search on google “large purchases with bitcoin” lots of properties, airplanes and yachts with multimillion dollar tags come up. Some historical info on previous big ticket purchases too. CME even published in their senate hearings about a $60 million grain purchase in Q4 ‘17. These purchases are usually quick buys and sells. Bitcoin being used as the medium of exchange. Bought by the item purchaser then sent and sold immediately by the seller for national fiat.

This looks more like a H&S rather than a bart, no? I dont see the bull flag, drop, slowly retrace up, low volume stagnation. It has more waves ups and downs.

Hopefully the up wicks are short shakeouts. Everyone is fucking bullish
I do the same if i'm long and reaching a support but in this case it suits perfectly :)
[removed]
Did you overleverage your fucking short so hard? In comparison to the guy above you, you dont even take into consideration that we might have found the bottom. So much for rationality.
Not Bitcoin. It’s just signed transactions that we pass around

Also, protocol is done, coded, tested (as much as can be) and live
That's a separate problem though. *Someone* has to hold the fiat (otherwise hyperinflation). Bitcoin would arbitrage, even if only among a subset of the population. 

The fact that lots of people don't have savings is beside the point.
"Maybe"...oh wait, that was the magic 8 ball
My finger is hovering over the button.

Ide like an entry a little over $6500. There are some weird sell wicks happening RN on binance 
I have a feeling this is going to dump.

Yeah, just woke up.  Didn’t think that one all the way through.

You don't know what TA is if you don't think you used it when you sold at 16K.
Lol that's actually pretty good.
BCash isn't Bitcoin though. That's plainly obvious. 

Go read the white paper and don't skip over the section about consensus and longest chain.

Get real, shill. Or, rather, get out.
80% in cash. 20% in position. I want my position to have a stop loss set if the market goes against me. But (at least on my exchange) I can't set a stop loss order and a limit sell order at the same time.
I got the pun, just not the reference ;D   


I'm overly logical and literal though so I'm probably just being pedantically annoying when it was just a bit of fun. 
> They might be able to launder some of it through shapeshift or just wait it out. Whoever committed this attack (we aren't sure they did, but lets assume so) probably knows what he'll be doing next. 

You don't pull off Ocean's 11 level crypto heist without knowing what to do next.

The guy probably already planned what he's going to eat for lunch on September 25th of next year...
Ok that’s pretty good then. It means we don’t have to worry about that 7000 BTC for now.
I'd argue that breaking below 6k was a fake-out, which followed by breaking 21 EMA is the most bullish thing we've seen since 10k.   
   
I wouldn't take the meme triangle too seriously (and neither the "triple bottom").
I have no idea what is going on but Tradingview just crashed and when I re-opened it was back to normal !

>I highly doubt a raffle in crypto would get past the IRB for any university. 

And you base this on what exactly? Experience? Doocumentation? 
Because here's an excerpt from my university policy:

>If participants are compensated through a draw, provide the details of the draw in the informed consent statement/information letter: for example, who is eligible, the odds of winning, the method for determining the winner(s), the prize(s) to be won, when and how the winner(s) will be notified.  
You can do a draw if the participants are under 18 if they have the ability to understand and agree to participate in the research.

Once again, do not call a grad student doing honest work a scammer simply because you don't understand how things are conducted outside of your bubble. You can raise concerns in a meaningful manner but you're potentially damaging the impact of his thesis just because you couldn't be dicked to do some decent research

I use just regular, non-pro tradingview and it works fine for basic charting. I like parts of cryptowatch but the scrolling on the chart is all funky, so I just use tradingview pretty much exclusively.
