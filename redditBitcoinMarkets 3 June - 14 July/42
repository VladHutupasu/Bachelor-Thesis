[Daily Discussion] Sunday, June 03, 2018 -- TITLE
#New post: [\[Daily Discussion\] Monday, June 04, 2018 →](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8oeff3/daily_discussion_monday_june_04_2018/)
I found u/throwawayfraza comment about BTC not having more than 4 daily greens in a row (today if green will be 4) since the bullrun very interesting. Last time was first week of January. Does this really mean anything. The candles look pretty flat this time around.
Just as a caution, before going full retard mode on your long buying, BTC is still in an ascending wedge coming off the downtrend.  I want this to be a reversal, but be careful...
Congrats to the bulls.  You got my stop upon exit of [this bear channel](https://www.tradingview.com/x/tYsIViIw/).

My narrative that there wasn't enough confidence in the bottom to break through was incorrect.  Out of position for a negligible loss.

We are over the 14 DMA which is what I use to indicate a potential change in short term trend and see next week also closing in the green.  Will look to long if we get a good healthy pull back. 

Otherwise I'm looking to the June monthly pivot of $8160 which coincides with a .382% retrace of the previous down swing (bottom of yellow highlighted area on chart) as a potential top for this. There is also the trend line connecting ATH and 9990 for us to tangle with too. ([Chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/LOYEyfEV/))

Good luck with your trades people!
Japan is now on par with the other exchanges, slowly working on getting its premium back. The past few hours has seen a breakdown that was quickly bought up, followed by a breakout that was quickly sold into, so it's been a pretty interesting few hours. I still think that momentum has shifted to the bulls so long as 7600 holds as resistance turned support, which so far appears to be the case. We could still have a few drops before moving back up but it seems buyers are eager to take it when it does drop. Japan also looks like it wants to push higher, and it might lead the others exchanges up, too.

Edit: And it appears Japan is trying to break out and the other exchange are indeed following.

Edit 2: I also like how many longs are closing here. Since our move up to 7700 1k longs have closed and about 200 shorts have opened and the price is holding steady. I think we'll see 7800 or more on this daily.
Things could get relatively volatile soon. I'm not going to try to predict the direction here, but the 1 hr BBands haven't been this tight as a percentage of price since... idk... I looked on trading view back to late September 2017 and didn't find anything. We're also right at the current downtrend resistance [https://imgur.com/a/3ifJd5X](https://imgur.com/a/3ifJd5X) so breaking through and holding would be nice.
Closed my long from $7,370. Expecting a small pullback and more side ways where I will open a new long. Wouldn’t surprise me if we blew past $8,000 and I would be looking to add a short somewhere there. 
My outlook on short and intermediate term of BTC and altcoins got buried in a response. [Here is the reddit perm link](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8o63z0/daily_discussion_sunday_june_03_2018/e01nh8v/)

This is low volume noise reminder to not over commit. 
Can someone explain to me the concept of "stop hunting"? Who is doing the hunting, and why is it profitable? From what I understand, it's the crypto exchanges that would profit from this, as they trigger lots of extra trades, thus more fees.
ETH and BCH are shortsqueezing right now, should spill out to BTC as well.
gdax is fucked up right now. Partial System Outage

Investigating - GDAX is currently unavailable via the web interface and API. Our team is investigating the issue to restore full service as soon as possible. 
Could experienced bitmex users explain this to me ? Sorry for the off topic, will delete later

We've just broken through the downtrend resistance line (log chart).

Things are looking up now.

broke down from ascending wedge but buyers be like IDGAF

Wicked down to test the 10K resistance, which is nice. 

Fractal from april: https://www.tradingview.com/x/4wbA3ojZ/

I've got no position now but i'm in btc and eth. I'd like to either short 7.8-8k or long 7.2-7.5k
It's always interesting to me to watch ETH and BTC side by side.  This time ETH seems to be seeing more robust of a move than BTC.

Looking at the 3 day chart on both of them it looks to me like it is time for a move upward.  Both look like damping sine waves for the past few months.  I don't see BTC in particular suddenly losing favor so I don't see the next large move as being downward as we reach the end of this damping cycle. 
we are currently exactly at our 23.5&#37; fib retrace from the fall from 10k to 7k. if we fall here we can se we got rejected at the first fib level. 
What are some of the best books you've found that have helped your trading?
I'd say we have confirmed our iH&S now and the measured move for that puts us at 8150-ish, but I won't be selling there as I'm thinking the momentum has confidently moved to the bulls for now and we'll head back up to the top of our symmetrical triangle within the next few weeks sitting at 9k. I won't be selling there either, as a break of that would be pretty significant and I'd rather have these coins if we were to start another bull run. I'm not confident in us starting another bull run so soon, though, so I plan to cut loose if we reject 9k at somewhere about 8600-8700.

Edit: Also, Japan is still lagging behind but not as hard, only about a $10 discount now. What would make me, like, 99% confident of us going to 9k would be if they get back their $50 premium they had until just a day ago. Still not sure of what triggered them to lose their premium and we'll probably never know. 
TA noob here, is this actually an ascending wedge?  I don't trust it.
I really envy those who got in at 7300 and below. Even though there's signs that it's gonna go up from here, it's very difficult to enter at this price point. 
Im wanting to learn more about predicting the market so where is somewhere I can learn about charts. 
Question to the TA gods: What is the more broadly used confirmation for triple bottoms \- highest interim peak \(in our case $11.8k, horizontal red dotted line in my chart\) or trendline of interim peaks \(in our case right now around $9.2k and descending, bold orange dashed line\)? I found both "in the books" so I am wondering whether there is common agreement on a correct solution to look at it...

It's amazing how much bearish bias there is on this sub. Just a few days ago everyone was clamoring about there not being enough buy pressure to break through $7,600 resistance. We've now broken through and have even managed to slowly climb to $7,700 on low weekend volume, yet everyone is still waiting for a trip down to goblin town. To me it looks like we could be heading to the top of the huge triangle on the 1D chart, which would put us back in the mid $8,000 range

https://www.tradingview.com/x/9CiJ4Lib/
Head and shoulders play. Imma go long here. Whether your long or short have a plan and dont be emotional. This looks very positive and im going for 8k here. 
At the precise moment we all think BTC will turn bullish, the whales will dump. Stay in fiat until we [break up or down out of this triangle](https://www.tradingview.com/x/XC6m6jgb/) otherwise you’re just gambling. At this point in the consolidation, the upside isn’t worth the risk. Just wait until we break.

What do you think? rising wedge continuation?

* The predominant trend must be bearish
* The wedge forms in a correction leg against the trend


The best indicator ever high time frame moving average cross is about to form on 12h https://www.tradingview.com/x/w66Gj3jb , if it forms on 1D  https://www.tradingview.com/x/TPqJcuUI

Also the previous downtrend line seems like a bounced of support for now, buying a bigger spot position in this area, maybe with layered buys from 7300 to 7600 seems like a good accumulation range

Still having my 7628 long, see no need in closing it soon on both up- or downswings
Not a lot going on right now but we might see some action before or right after the daily closing I hope. A few scenarios I can see playing out

https://www.tradingview.com/x/PIPaFHYX/

We could have a bit more sideways with a break above the channel we are in, anything above the 0.61 fib 7780 and top of the kumo around 7850s would be bullish. Since I'm holding a small short that's were I'd be bailing on it. But volume keeps decreasing and the bull flag that was forming after the pump from 7650 to 7750s seems to be breaking down if it hasn't already. Also a lot of longs have started closing.



The bear cases are pretty much the same, we are either in a rising wedge or still in the ascending channel. Breaking down it could find support were the kijun(blue) meets the bottom of the wedge, 7550. That holding would be a very good case for the bulls. Another scenario would be dropping to the bottom of the channel $100 lower.

I'm currently short but I think there are good opportunities for a long if this breaks down and buyers hold up support.
2h bbands tightest since 24th April, expect something!
Another stab to the top of the channel but bounced back inside. Rejection was close to the 0.6 fib line as well. I was waiting for a better short entry and this seems like a decent one with stops above 7850s. First target would be the bottom of the channel 7450s, if it stays in there might switch to a long.

!short xbtusd 7715 10X 50%



Ugh I really feel like longing at 7730 right now 
Glad I hedged long, but closed it. Think I can re-enter lower and I'm cautious about this being a very short scale blow off top
If we hold above 7720 I'm adding to my long positions 
just curious, but do anyone have a good historic chart of when the first bart pattern appeared, that went both up and down? Last year I did not see them at all
[deleted]
https://imgur.com/a/8nLUUGU

Next few days will be critical^tm    But we'll probably going to bart around then head to 8k.
I'm in a reasonably large short from 7670, holding since entering ~24 hours ago. Going to keep it open with stops 820 850, 880. I'm medium term bullish given this weeks PA but am expecting a pullback here to the 400/500 area, at which time i'd like to scale into a long. I may slightly reduce short at breakeven or at slight profit. 
bitmex swaps are extremely hesitant to move...sitting at $35 under price right now with an extremely thick order book right up ahead

if it's any indication...bitmex funding rates were positive for longs above $9k before the big reversal. so if bitmex really is as stupid as we may think, it's possible that it's *bullish* that swaps refuse to move up -_-

ETH is skyrocketing right now, bout 5% in the past few hours 
My S/L on a little fomo long was at XBTUSD 7652. I hate this game. 
I know this isn't a trading related comment, but the mempool seems to be spiking today. Any clue as to what's happening?

[https://blockchain.info/charts/mempool\-size?timespan=1week](https://blockchain.info/charts/mempool-size?timespan=1week)
LTC and ETH pumping. BTC gonna go. Hold on to your asses. 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/EZgHw2X1/

We broke the 10k down trend which is nice, but are at the top of the channel. 
But with the buying pressure we could go to 8k before testing the bottom. Who knows. 

A lot of people (me included) where waiting for a second try of 7k before going up (just like in april) but in retrospects it makes sense that it doesn't happen twice. The channel we're in right now makes me think of the multi-lane channel we where in after the BGD. Bulls think this is the reversal and the road to 9k, I'll go along for the ride. 

I will be in long the dip mode.

Still holding my short (1x). I've been traveling since Thursday, but it seems like the sub's been taken over by high-volume/low-quality hopium.

There is a legitimate bullish case to be made, as we broke the downtrend line and pushed through the 7500-7700 range and we're holding it. It definitely feels like we're closer to breaking into the $8000s than seeing $6xxx anytime soon, but sometimes that's the best time to be short (a la $9900).

Haven't updated charts in a few days though, so I'm going to revisit when I get home tonight. I'm not flipping to actively short, just hedge short, and stops are still over 7800.

Good luck all.

Bands getting tight, which way will she go.

What do you guys think is about to happen. Like actual experts opinions
Hard to believe this is a valid inverse H&S given the volume on the right shoulder:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/9VEhJGYk/

Volume-wise speaking, this better fits an ascending wedge.

I'm still massively confused because there seemed to be some good consolidation in the low 7k area and btc broke the downtrend line. Your guess is as good as mine..
[deleted]
BTC dominance bleeding hard, ETH/BCH going through a short-squeeze. alts are pumping. market sentiment is changing fast, investors are getting more and more risk-tolerant if alts are rising. this will 100% spill onto BTC in the near short-term. think this is definitely a turning point on short time-frames. we've also broken through log/linear resistance on BTC. looking pretty good right now.

edit: lol im literally stating cold hard facts and giving a reasonable prediction and yet im getting downvoted hard. 
Not touching this right now but id be tempted to short. 

Potential 4hr bear div on OBV OSC plus its another dead volume weekend pump. Getting rejected at daily 18 EMA but on 4hr EMAs are looking pretty nice.

Rather wait for it to come down and fish for longs

If this was the reversal and keeps going up, fair enough, we still got way to go to 20k, might as well just wait for it to test some support to show strength, then i might long


Still not closing below the red line here :D https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/YRZvdurN-The-target-of-current-bubble-lays-between-40k-and-110k/ 

this is my long term goal to see that, and yes it's half jokingly I look at this chart but it has been around so long
Might want to consider a long position after the recent trends. We had the bridgey shaped shapes several times, and after bridge comes the ladder. Might see a roof then, definitely not a bridge. After a ladder we never see a bridge, maybe a slide but not a bridge. Hold tight guys.
This has to be an ascending wedge bearish formation visible on the 2 hour, right? 
Salty bears incoming. Keep shorting you guys, 2k next week lmao
Volume's less than pitiful. As long as there is no new money, I don't care which trend lines are broken. Can't get bullish on the same dozen guys getting bored and buying some coins with their recycled dollars.
So I think most reasonable thinking traders consider this rise from $7000 to be just another bear market DCB.  So the question is where is this like to peter out and start to head sharply downwards again?

I heard $7800 thrown around a good bit, but thinking it will probably be higher than that.  So far we had $11.6K, and $10K, so maybe $8500 this time.

And of course it could start to head downwards long before that, but $6K before $10K is still more likely.
I am getting bored after 24 hours of sitting out of position. I will try to keep it simple. Long from $7,693.9.

*And its down at $7,680.*


[deleted]
I'm looking at the daily candle, and I notice how the volume was significantly higher on the drops from 9.8k than the past 6 up days. It's not a very convincing reversal

**Position Bot update**

Restarted the PMs bot.

Added another command **!status** to retrieve all the open positions and the current PnL as requested by /u/csasker. 

Any suggestions, bugs or bots possible offline just pm me.
Ah, I love waking up to find my long from 7240  looking good. Will probably move my stop up today, but I expect to be chasing this thing up for at least a couple weeks. Will close at $11K should a couple of BGDs take us there in the next week. That's unlikely but not out of the realm of possibility. 
[removed]
can someone please explain what or how these BGD barts are being created? 

I'm checking charts of BCH and ETH and they are not present there, only in BTC.
Symmetrical triangles are continuation patterns so that's why a lot of people think we're just going to resume going down in the near future.

Now is this just hopium speaking...or is it possible that we could just see us return to the uptrend that we saw for much of 2017?
7700 right now. Looks like a good spot for a long till 78 or 7900. 
Trending upwards for almost a week, but within a larger downtrend. Might be a bottom for a longer time frame but I'm really not confident in it yet. Opened a decent long but not closing my short yet so it's basically hedging. Short is actually a sliver in the green.

Next big movement will probably decide how I bet.
Anyone think BTC 24hr volume on gdax will make it down to the 3000s today? 
Tempted to try another short here.  It's rare price exits [these](https://www.tradingview.com/x/gF78pOWq/) easily, esepecialy when they've been so well respected.

Am starting to think we're going to get a couple of days of red. Where does everyone else stand atm?
[deleted]
if the trend continues we'll see a sharp drop to ~7200 within the next day or two.
Has someone read this analysis?
Someone recommended this channel as a great source,
HOWEVER, my knowledge is lacking so I was wondering if anyone has read it.

[removed]
The way to trade this market right now is to short the tops, trying not to get in too early and cause yourself tough decisions down the road.

So we have to ask ourselves, where might the top, or some good short entry be.

Looking back at historical volume and short term tops and bottoms it looks like $8,000, $8,700, and $9,000 are good places to enter a position with solid r/r.

But I am just hodling a short from way earlier on and in a lot of profit. Not looking to close unless it goes above $10,000 or below $4,500.

Maybe we make 8k maybe we don't. Please try to remember what's happened many many times before though.

The grind down shows zero signs of changing in the medium term. At best we may have short term bullishness, but that's it. It's all short term.

Long term of course still looks good but don't be under any illusions at the moment that we are going anywhere in the medium term but slowly down.

Love to be wrong but we simply haven't got any signs yet that the bear market is anywhere done with us. 

So just keep that in mind in case we do break above 8k and we get another ridiculous level of hopium as people start talking new ATHs again.

Level heads win the day 
anyone else hears a long beep looking at the chart?
Does gdax open up to allow changes to the orders before live?

[deleted]
Eight out of the last 10 daily candles are green.  Is anyone seriously thinking the May fire sale is still on?
Before going retard sell mode due to a small dropping below the ascending wedge,  keep in mind that market sentiment all around is turning bullish and your little indicators and meme lines are most probabely obsolete until sentiment returns to neutral again
[deleted]
On linear scale and a large timescale it looks so meaningless this small rise: [https://imgur.com/a/N9Zz9cQ](https://imgur.com/a/N9Zz9cQ)

Every day we dont get significantly above 8k is a good day for bears in the longer run. 
A lot of noise and bad quality posts in this sub lately (I may be responsible also). I remember when I joined one month ago, this place was much better.

*gets out tea leaves* I say at 00:00 there is  50/50 chance there is a pump or dump. The tea leaves have spoken!
I've been short since $15k and I'm very grateful that the project is not going to work as originally intended. Otherwise I'd have to change strategy or something. I imagine that in 18 months the situation will be the same or worse, which means more gains for me. Hope you guys see the writing on the wall. I'm saying down to 6500 by the end of the week.
How can one buy or sell with this pitiful all time low volume?

Bitcoin has retested the neckline \(7800\) of the giant H&S like formation that formed in April/May. It also retraced 50&#37; the previous major dump on shit volume. This is again looking like a potential H&S formation. Every coin has the same pattern \(H&S, retest of neckline \+ a potential smaller H&S\).

Make of it what you will but it's not looking good.

Generally, the 'three white soldiers' pattern on the daily is taken to be a reliable trend reversal in the equities world IME. 

Of course, the body on the second day here is probably not as thick as one might have liked, and also there is the question if day over day comparisons are really the right time scale to compare to patterns in traditional markets.

But either way, yes, generally a short cool off in indicators is expected after/if the three guys line up.
You cracked the code. /s but still, pretty solid info here
~~What graph are people using? Gdax had 4 green candles starting from April the 19th.~~

Edit: Oops, ignore this lol
A breakdown off the ascending wedge that you're seeing is potentially consistent with the structure of a much larger triangle whose structure could give us the actual trend reversal.
We are in a very tight spot though and it looks more bullish than bearish.

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/zw2C4M2c/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/zw2C4M2c/)
Some alts are breaking though.
isnt it a ascending triangle? ;\)
Which exchange?
Why are you paying  so much attention to bit flyer? They're like less than 10th in overall volume, nah? I mean it's fine to take notice but I don't think a premium/discount really means anything 
Up it is!
And here we go. :\)

Stop hunting is a myth.
where can I see how many ETH and BCH shorts are open?
I was going to say. There are less than 4 BTC separating 7740 and 7670. 
Trading with ~28k $ on ~10x leverage on a plateform you are not familiar with. What could go wrong? /s

Your realized PnL comes probably from the fact that you used a MARKET order to get into your position, costing you 0.075%. If you hold your position for a longer time, you will also pay funding costs if there are more longs than shorts open.

You get your juicy 0.3XBT unrealized PnL as soon as you close your order. Just open a limit sell for the same amount of contracts (280k) at some price you want to sell it for, or press the market close button in the bottom right corner (this will cost you 0.075% again, however).
Realized pnl is btc you make from positive fees in your favor or from getting a limit order filled. It has nothing to do with the price moving in your favor.

Unrealized pnl is btc you make when you close a position in profit (or at a loss, if the unrealized pnl is negative)
Those +$100 profit will be added to your account when you close your position, that's when you 'realise' your unrealised PnL. Your realised PnL shows in red atm is funding fee(if perpetual)+maker/taker fee. Say if you close your position now, 0.354 - 0.027 = 0.327 BTC will be added to your account.
also Dentacoin is up 30%, things are looking great 
On some graphs line broken yesterday
> but buyers be like IDGAF

Maybe buyers are just looking at other indicators. I am. 

Peace.
there are several different ways how you draw your wedge...

that the 1h RSI touched at least 5 times the 70 value, but no time the 30 value tells me that we are quite overbought and we will test the downside sooner rather than later. 
To me ETH looks like a rising wedge, which will break down soon.

24 hours ago, I though it could be an ascending triangle, but it keeps pushing the highs a little higher, without breaking out...

Awesome, you made me laugh out loud.
Lol.  Good luck. 
Babypips is a very good place to learn about patterns and basics too 
Check out The Chart Guys on youtube. They also offer a course for crypto trading that includes reading charts and access to their chat group.
Yeah Massey University study, you'll learn how TA gives results comparable to random chance. 
Zoom out if you want to predict the market.  Short-term, nobody knows because all it takes is a billion to move it a couple hundred bucks in either direction, and there are a lot of chumps with a billion bucks to burn in this world.
$12k is the point where most bears would give up and say okay i guess we recovered. Thats the target ive had for 4 months now before we ever even recovered after $6k

its also 60% of ATH which is the lowest % any correction in 2017 went before bouncing miraculously, so breaking through that would be exceedingly bullish. 

don't put too much faith in diagonals, they are less reliable. in longer trends they can have a +/- 5% accuracy so they're not great to count on unless you have pretty generous stops/low leverage
Im not a TA God. But I'm looking for multiple weekly candle closes over 12k.  Without much bear volume.

Everyone's definition will be different though.  Some will count it as confirmed once we breach 10k.

Edit: But yes, you are right.  They are both 'textbook' answers.  Volume will be key in instilling confidence (and follow through in the pattern) IMO. 
More related to the horizontal. with a triple, the alternative to reversal might be a flag so it can help to think about what would invalidate your flag. This is not a triple bottom btw. on the log chart it would take up half the range from the ath. you can't really say it formed in a down trend.
We've moved 29% down in 22 days with 1 pullback of ~10%. We've now locally bottomed and had 5.5 days take us 8% up. Whether or not there is or isn't bearish bias right now (noting each day there seems to be cries of bearish or bullish bias) it's foolish not to consider a bearish view, as for a bullish one. There's a bigger narrative going on than the past 6 days, irrespective of how bullish it looks. 
If you're a bull, the bearish bias is a good thing. The more bearishness, the more likely the market will turn bullish soon. The last bear market which ended in the fall of 2015, bullish posts were getting downvoted and "common wisdom" was that we were headed under $100 and possibly to 0. Then the rocket launched.
I understood recently that trading based on our own personal future forecast leads to insatisfaction. The truth we must accept is that we don't know. We can only trade based on r/r and that will put consistency in our income. As such there's no need to feel bad anymore when it doesn't go our way, nor do we need to persist being wrong.

Trading as strange as it sounds isn't about being right or wrong.
We've had a few polls asking what people believe, up/down or short/long, and the results I've seen were pretty evenly split. Other factors, like who is most active commenting, and when, is likely the reason there's an apparent bias in one direction or another, with the twists and turns of the market, imo.
people whinging about supposed bias, not new.

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8o824j/whats_with_the_huge_bull_bias_on_this_sub/


Honestly it seems like there's 5 bullish posts and 10 neutral posts to every bearish post. I was actually thinking this is starting to look like euphoria
Even the most bearish of us see have seen that as a possible scenario. I've seen several vocal bears take positions in the low $7ks for that trade.

Plenty of overhead resistance though. 7.8k, 8k psychological, 8.2k. Its hard for me to open a counter-trend play.
I’m in, eth as well. June will be an exciting month
What are you seeing positive? To me we have low volume still, lower levels of positive momentum on macd, RSI is high but has to be exhausting soon. Just curious of other perspectives. Cheers.
Not sure I can a agree with all of this. Surely if we break up out the triangle  that is when everyone will be bullish and by your logic that is also when the whales will dump on us. I don't know what is going to happen but you seem to contradict  yourself. Not having a go just making an observation. 
It would be gambling if not for stoplosses. Its the most key part of proper risk management. Its pretty tricky to place them so they give you good r/r while also not being a easy target for a stophunt though. 
Well, I'm always bullish. The guy next to me thinks BTC turned bullish today, another guy wants to wait until we break $7.8k, while yet another guy rather waits for $8.1k to break.

So when exactly is that *"precise moment"*?
[https://www.tradingview.com/x/GjuI6FZp/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/GjuI6FZp/) my current expectations.

I forgot to add 1 line to that picture though, from that low to above my drawing.
on the eye of the beholder, but to me looks like its bouncing from horizontal support to resistance. If it does not break it will at the very least revisit 7100, with potential to go much lower. If it breaks we may have gained a strong support point, and possibly break 10k this time. 
> rising wedge continuation

So you think this wedge breaks down and the bear trend continues? Or this wedge breaks up with the slightly bullish trend we have at the moment?
What makes that such a great indicator? 
When do they confirm? 
Have you looked at this on the 4h and 6h too? Just wondering if they are less reliable, then how much so. Seems like you would be making more trades and have more losers, but potentially more winners and a bigger over all return. Thanks for sharing, very interesting 

Edit: grammar
All time frames below that are on the verge of closing into a neck or are already there.  1D isn't far behind.
That looks like a potentially bad idea, ascending wedge, volume dropping, unless I'm missing something
A Bart is just a bull flag breaking down. Of course that happened sometime.
First bar appeared in 2010 most likely.
I just took almost this exact same position. This thing is about to jump soon
What time period are you considering for this position?

Edit: Who downvotes a question?
I am leaning towards you getting liquidated. Best of luck though.

place your longs/shorts where you would place your stops
layered stop losses with 5$ spread an 20% of your position on each is the way to go
Surely 7649 would be a much better place. Only $3 differnt  but a  greater  chance  that you can keep your position as it tends to bounce from round numbers.  Edit a word
I would set S/L below rounded numbers next time.
lol and now it's even higher than before where it dropped. market has no idea what it wants to do
And my short missed a target when I was away from the computer by just a couple dollars.  (I heard the price action because the fans started whirring)  I barely managed to then close it for a 0.38% loss on the bounce back up.  Fucking annoying shit.

(and just like you, my previous trade which was a long got stopped out just in the same fashion a couple days ago, but at least that time I had managed to take one small chunk of profit before hand to cover fees and stop loss)
Looks normal.

Zoom out to 3 or 6 months.

Probably just a series of longer than usual block confirmations.

Looks like spam. The spike is almost entirely very low fee transactions. 

Also, this *is* trading related.

Id be wary of shorting here in wake of eos and eth pumps, maybe look for shorts over 8k imo. 

I'm personally more in the camp that shorting 9200 would be the best entry when we make it up there as we push through 7650 and it's confirmed. Maybe in a week and a half will be there. I don't really trade daily movements as it's just too volatile anyway.
ETH could break out of its down trend but maybe not. Also it could drag BTC upwards but maybe not. Those two things are not a giving right now. Also, ETH dropped a lot harder so it has more room to recover, I'd be more inclined to believe it if the ratio was closer to .085, where it was a week ago, but right now it has room to go.

take it to the altcoin discussion thread please.

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8o6406/altcoin_discussion_sunday_june_03_2018/
Sideways. Someone will complain about a "half Bart" that's less than a 5% move. Nobody will make a substantial profit. Several traders will give up out of frustration. Someone will flip a coin and make a small profit on an improbable scalp.
Either up, or down
Pretty much everybody is about to get rekt...  Both longs and shorts.  It is going to move sharp one way, stops will be triggered, FOMO will set in, then it will go harder the other way for even more stops and more pain.
There are several buy signals on the daily which look quite convincing, so one could gamble on a reversal, but my general outlook is still bearish so I wouldn't be surprised if we just see a good ol' bull trap.
Lakers win the superbowl
More noise until 10k breach or new lower low. 
I think we are at the trough of the first half of a wave. The next half should be up.

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/Pe0BcHme-BTC-Wave/
on lower timeframe, indeed a confirmed inverse H&S. On larger timeframe, looks like a bearflag on low volume and tight channel.
Volume drops in both patterns. The larger pattern is more relevant.
Thanks for this chart. BTCUSD continues to float around in the ascending wedge for my chart as well. 

Volume for this rally (on the 12hr) continues to be troubling for someone who just wants to buy and sit on a long position. Our volume here is on average half (or less than half) of the build up at 6.5k before the short squeeze in April. Volume for alt coins isn't promising as well. 
Lol bubble. If anything the past 6 months has been a consolidation period with both bears and bulls evenly matched. Higher lows, lower highs, bull runs of 50-80% and subsequent dumps. All in the last 6 months. If there is going to be a bear market, it hasn't begun yet. I'm bullish however. Look at a real bubble like the dotcom bubble where it just dumped and dumped and dumped with very small bull runs along the way. 
[https://www.tradingview.com/x/vQteMyoc/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/vQteMyoc/)

We have resistance that is now support just below where we are now.   I always tend to look a bit longer term for longer trades.  My next target is 8600 if we stay above the bottom of this latest BGD. Looking at ETH and LTC it looks likely at the moment.
RemindMe! 2 weeks
lol you probably gonna be here crying manipulation tmr
BTC volume is about the same as it was before the late 2017 mania.
Some volume from Bitstamp, Bitfinex, Bittrex, Kraken, .. migrated to BitMex.
$ volume is still reasonably high. Looking at localbitcoins we have levels of Nov 2017 (https://coin.dance/volume/localbitcoins/ALL)
Although they introduced KYC recently. (Including Paxful we are probably higher than Nov 2017 (https://coin.dance/volume/paxful/ALL))

I would not call it pitiful
Dentacoin is up 30% so color me skeptical on a btc reversal. Seems like each push is a singular person buying 1500 btc to go pump alts 
Because why again?
> most reasonable thinking traders consider this rise from $7000 to be just another bear market DCB

false

It was very clear that we would not go to 6k directly from 10k. This feels as the perfect setup to really make a new low. RSIs have recovered enough it seems, only the daily is still slightly oversold, but with a 43.5 not very much anymore.

12h RSI = 52

6h RSI = 60

4h RSI = 62

2h RSI = 63
You're asking all the difficult questions that nobody has the answers to.
HaHaHAAAA!!! "DCB!!!!" That old chestnut cracks me up!  Because the cat is clearly dead, right?

You guys really need to come up with some new material. We're going to smash through $10K with such power that it will make your little heads explode. It's going to be like setting off a whole brick of Black Cats in this sub when it happens.

Next time throw in a "delusional" and "bag holder" to complete the trifecta of hackneyed talking points.
Same! Now we’re in! Bch also making moves, we’ll see 1200 soon
What is your stop on eth? I'm also short around 622 and thinking of setting it at breakeven. Bounced from 612 after strugling a lot to get there. I think another leg up is coming
It's getting more and more thrilling as time goes by I think.. Good short mate!


Yea, this is a sucker's rally.
Yeah, to me it signals distribution. But I could be wrong. 

Why would big players sell their coins at $9k but not accumulate with higher volume down low? 
Well....
Lucky or educated - the call was correct. 
Well I guess it was 50/50
well done
Right side of Bart’s head tho
It would be cool to periodically post info about the median trader performance as visible to the bot
Nice, could you also consider adding an ETH address as donation ? 
Is Pushed app disabled? I can’t get Pushbullet to notify in iOS. 
Can i get link sir?
Agreed
A mixture of stop losses and leverage that neither of those have.  In other words Bitmex.
What did traders call a bart before... Bart?
I think it is likely it happens in BTC due to the huge volume in the BTC/USD futures pair on bitmex. Many of the traders are likely very short term traders that tend to use big leverage and tight stops. I believe a natural effect of this is when the price starts to move in one direction you can get a positive feedback effect in which the stops getting hit trigger sudden moves to a new stable level.
I am fairly sure it's whales buying btc to convert to alts and/or whales ensuring their their positions get filled on bitmex
Symmetric triangles break the direction of the trend ~60% of the time, I forget the exact number. So there's certainly a good chance it's a reversal, but if you're betting on probabilities and *only* using the triangle as your sole point of analysis (dumb, not recommended) you'd be bearish.

Obviously there's other factors at play too, though.

Worth keeping in mind how bullish everyone was about a *potential* A&E double bottom forming for no reason when A&E double bottoms turn around and fail about 60% of the time before confirmation as well. Which it did. Short term bullishness/reliefs clearly don't necessarily bring about intermediate/long term rallies, no matter what sentiment here thinks. It likely will eventually, maybe even this time, but don't take it for granted.
On twitter where everybody is right, some were using ETH breaking out of the wedge as a precursor to what will happen with BTC. I don't know enough about their relationship to see if there is any historical precedence of it playing out this way. I just think ETH was oversold due to EOS FUD.
Bears  are angry lol 
how to short volume? we need a crypto VIX lol
You really think will fall that hard 
What do the different shades represent? Beautiful chart by the way.
[deleted]
Based on?
Hmmm, I dont see the logic. The trend is UP, so if this continues we will end up around 8K this week. Do you have a chart to back your prediction?
Explain your reasoning
I don't think we Bart here. We can easily see a $300ish up move from here. Bulls need to hold the resistance-turned-support at 7600

7200 is too low and confidence in any sustained bull move will dissipate. Our last major low was around 7350. The bulls would have to hope for a daily equilibrium that breaks up, at that point. 

Waiting to see how the price reacts closer to the $8k mark to see if this bounce will have any juice left
Idk. Bitcoin only drops suddenly after its gone up suddenly. Zooming out the daily and weekly look like we are due for a multi week bull run.
He completely lost me right out the gate, because the very first thing he does is manipulate and start micromanaging the reaction of the reader.
It's junk. That's not how emerging, trillion dollar markets move. Buy and HODL (18-24 months).
I follow botje11 a lot on TV. He has been right consecutively many times until a week ago. I think whales may be onto him :(

Read it a few days ago. Could be possible, however I’m out of a position and only holding fiat at the moment.
This isn’t blood on the street to me, but more mass manipulation. 
A few weeks a go we had a similar pattern that we were pumping during the weekend to fall very hard during the beginning of the week.
If the situation persist I will stay out of a position for a long time and I think many bulls agree with me.

The comments approving/requesting downvotes are getting lame
Say something that doesnt contribute at all to the discussion + predict to be downvoted because of "dilusional" bulls/bears who disagree is getting way to common. 

You are getting downvoted because your post adds nothing to the discussion about the market and pricemovements. If you want upvotes start contributing actual content and not just jabs at the people countertrading you. 
Could you elaborate on 'it's fine' mode?  Genuinely interested. (Not down voting)
Traders are buying cautiously since we retested the lows of the triangle with a target at the top end of the triangle. If this is a true bear market, we probably never reach the top end of the triangle and retest the lows at a minimum (failure to retest well drawn support/resistances is a sign of weakness). This could also be that thin volume rise like the climb of worry type scenario before breaking out into the bullish side. However, before we say anything bullish, lets break the 200day MA first before confirming intermediate/longer term bullish trends.

On short timeframe, we have a confirmed inverse head and shoulders with a target of ~8.0K range. Intermediate time frame, it surely looks like a bear flag in the printing; evidence of this are low volume, consolidation in a channel with unpredictable ups and downs, previous down trend. So my take is that we may grind higher and retest higher levels, but intermediate term is down. For me to change my mind, price action needs to be firm such as stronger volume, buying or selling without pullbacks like that big green daily bar on the 6.5K retest. In addition, the start of a bull market in crypto history is often lead by price appreciation in market leaders like BTC and ETH. However, in our current rally, we are seeing altcoins performing better than leadership coins.
What exchange/chart are you watching? On bitfinex and everywhere I checked there are 4 red daily candles of the last 10.
At tradingview its only 6 for BTCUSD at Bitfinex and 4 red..
Wait, because you see some green candles you think the selling is finally over?! 
Lol, I was just about to warn not to over commit on a long here...

If I were a whale looking to bart us down, I would probably do it about now.  I noticed that many downward barts tend to look like a break-up at first, which I'm guessing is the whale filling some shorts before dropping it.

I'm currently in fiat, waiting to see what happens (been doing some quick scalps during the day), I also have an underwater ETH short from before the bart that I'm going to hold a bit longer until I'm sure we're not breaking down out of the rising wedge.
This current climb could go up another $1000. And we aren't nearly overbought on the 1D. We're in no man's land now.

I base this on the diverging triangles... after 9150, I see us dropping down again to around 8k and then up again. Bears be downvoting this - I actually dont give a shit - but truth is, we are looking at a bullmarket before eoy

What if I told you, I'm one of the authors, and you're going to see it my way? You don't have a choice in the matter ...
as a serious question, where is this understanding that volume is at all time low coming from?  


As others have mentioned, its orders of magnitude over what it was last year.
Errm daily volume is around x3 what it was this time last year (in USD). How is that an all time low?
Step 1. Log into an exchange. Step 2. Enter an order. Step 3. Place the order. 

Optional step. Stop pretending the volume is at 'all time lows.'
Volume. Doesn’t. Matter.
Lmao good luck get this answered, 99% of the people here don't even look at volume or think it's relevant. Well, only relevant when it fits their narrative

low quality bullish posts reek of desperation and euphoria. "If we break 7800 then the bull scenario is 99% confirmed." really isn't correct.

RSI is much lower on this 4th day also compared with others. Like you said just one indicator but I never really zoomed out and looked at 1 day candles so I found this to be interesting bc if its green today and tomorrow which is probably what it will take to get to 8k, it would be something hasn't happened in a very long time. If it goes green after for 6, interesting enough that would be the first since exactly this time last year when it went green 7 straight days. Went from $2200 to $2800 but then gave it all back in the days proceeding it. 
why is it dumb? It's a simple signal showing that the market has mid term confidence in a trend and that people want to buy more than sell att current prices

edit: now i read the rest of your comment, seems we  think the same :)
haha I don't know how to chart or do TA so I do my best to contribute since even as a no-coiner right now I enjoy this sub
Don't chart on gdax. It has anemic volume and has been fading fast as far as significance to the overall BTC market. Chart on Bitfinex; a lot of people also use bitstamp as it's slightly less wicky, or do some price averaging across exchanges.

Also not sure if gdax starts the daily candles at UTC 00:00 like you should be using.
Haven't seen you in a while! What's up man where you been?

I tend to watch bitflyer.
Well, they have led the market in the past. And as I wrote in my edit, as they were trying to pump the other markets followed, so it can help with trading. Japan and Korea are important markets to follow. Their volume may be low but if they make a move I feel it is important to take note of it.
Thanks. So the answer to "what's in it for the stop hunters?" is that they try to trigger a sudden price drop, and then stand prepared to buy this artificial dip? If this is regular traders, it seems to me a very risky procedure for them. 
Just a heads up. From GDAX's Trading Rules, current as of April 9, 2018.

2.12 "GDAX does not use artificial market integrity measures such as ‘circuit breakers’ or trading halts."
GDAX just got rid of margin trading, no additional changes afaik
Last year bitmex futures when s2x got cancelled, traded at 7k, triggered all stop loses until 8k, order book was bought up up to 50k.

Ok. But... if you look about recent threads in Bitmex reddit, there's many people who were in profit and got a loss after closing.

Why is that ?

Lol I just don’t understand how shit like Dentacoin and Verge and other coins are doing what they’re doing.  Makes me feel like understanding and taking advantage of this market is factoring in a significant amount of irrationality.   

Edit: fixed typos
Yes, on the linear chart it broke yesterday.
What indicators are you looking at? Genuinely curious. While I can't say this is bearish short term, I can't exactly say I'm convinced by an incredibly low volume rise off of support at the bottom. At least at $6.5k it was very clear the market didn't want to be there when it BGD'd up. This rise so far has just been...meh
The month of may shows this is not a reliable indicator. 4 hour/daily rsi are much better, even 4 hour is sketchy at this point.
btc looks more of a rising wedge than eth...eth is just straight up trend 
It has been. It's been ranging a percentage or two for the past month but that premium has been there for about a month. I haven't been checking it everyday so I guess it could have gone away sometimes but in general there has been a premium. And then yesterday, after our break of 7600, it went from +50 to -50, so while the usd/jpy could be a factor I think someone else was just dumping at the time and it just hasn't recovered yet. 
|**Year**|**Total number of billionaires**  | **Combined wealth of known billionaires**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2018|2,754|$9.2 trillion|

And you have to figure that at least half of those billionaires are billionaires by the skin of their teeth, so not really having an extra billion to burn. So maybe 1000 chumps?
Thanks, Sloppy, this is very helpful!
That would obviously be the most conservative way of looking at it and makes sense if you wanna be 100&#37; sure we are out of the woods :\-\) You just risk being pretty late to the party in this case IF suddenly Average Joe's money starts pouring back in and the FOMO train starts rolling like crazy...
There's also a bigger narrative than that weak little artificial dump in May. We're hitting a big, fat rounded bottom on the big dump from $20K. To me it's looking very much like mid-2015 which was a fantastic time to buy. I've informally polled my circle, and nobody is selling. Everyone is buying. That tells me that the dumps are manufactured and probably costing the perps a ton of money. 

Eventually, those people will realize the error of their ways and begin buying in earnest. 20K will look like 1K does now within a couple years.
If you believe in TA, then you realize that a confirmation of a high,volume breakout from a massive 4 months long triangle is a significantly stronger buy signal than a weak bounce off of support at the bottom. 
You can avoid getting stopped out by babysitting the trade and be ready to place a stop when there is a real price change. I assume there exists software that can add some inertia to the decision whether a stop should be triggered. If not, then someone should write that code. 

Edit: I would say it should be up to the exchanges to add code in their exchange interface that asks for confirmation if someone places a wildly low or high order, in order to avoid "fat finger" trades, that presumably is the reason for some of the wicks. 

Edit2: One of the ways to use stop-loss is (if you are long) to place a stop just below the low point of the price range, the point being that you can do other things and not have to sit and manage the trade minute by minute. But these wicks (fat finger?) trigger such stops too often. You end up repeatedly selling at the "escape" price, adding the "calculated risk" each time. Normally a trader can't take more than one such unforeseen event, so either you take the ball and go home, or you "up the ante" and continue trading. Both bad options.
Long the pull back (buy support) or wait to short the top (sell resistance). This is no mans land right now.  A good entry is everything, mate!
former
crypto is momentum drive and not fundamental driven, people panic sell/FOMO in, leading to snowball effect. Combined with looking at increasing volume, news mentions and so on it can indicate when a reversal is coming. Just count the crossed on the chart and see if it would have been good or bad for a 1 week or more long/short position on them
well when the cross are there, so possible each 12 or 24h close
In general the higher time frame, the more probable the trend. I use for BTC at least 4h for crossings
7620 now. What do you think of a long here and a stop loss at below 7600?
of course, but not as often since let's say 3 months. Correlates also quite heavy with Bitmex increased volume and system overloaded messages
What? I've got stops in place that cap risk at 2.5%, its a 1x short and its partially funded with btc..
yeh maybe i can look at longing some futures as a hedge and calling it quits at 8.2... kinda erring to the side of closing sooner and looking for future trades
yeh ill keep an eye on it and look for opportunity to sell off a chunk at breakeven depending on PA given idea has been partially invalidated after clear break above 77. Not too concerned at this point, move above 850 soon will push us above 8k before pullback imo, hence stops.
Yeah...lesson...learned.
But why would someone spam?
Agreed.
Sure. Because shorting Bitcoin and sweating out a 5% gain is sooo much better than simply buying now and selling at $9200 for a 15 percent gain.
Good points and tbh BTC still looks like its in a bear flag. So short away! 

Just waiting for all the alts to stop pumping until I enter short again.  Im happy to miss the top few % if that's what it takes.
Sorry mate, does the edit clarify why I put it in here?  If that's not good enough then i'll delete.  Let me know
Welcome to crypto forex!
What about hodlers
Which also means, if you want to sell, you'll have a chance to sell higher soon, and if you want to buy, you'll have a chance to buy lower soon.

All good news.
Sorry to be blunt, but lol wtf kind of TA is that...

Drawing curved trend lines on an already log chart is just schenanigans, especially when the bottom two start at random AF places and hardly touch any major points.
what!
best chart ever
I hope lol 
That's great!
By bear flag, you mean [this in red?](https://www.tradingview.com/x/glmxDh1K/)

Also, how did you get that awesome trophy, bro
Yeah it's very fakey and non-organic.. Missed out on some sweet gains though :(
> Look at a real bubble

have you yourself looked at btc in 2014? You realize right now in terms of days after ATH they were trading at around the equivalent ATH % of $11000? and then it hit the equivalent of $3-4k like a year later
>Lol bubble. If anything the past 6 months has been a consolidation period with both bears and bulls evenly matched.

You know full well which exchange is the go to for new money and how it's doing in terms of vol

Japan is still carrying the torch onwards. This might eventually spark something.
>Dentacoin

Jesus Christ...
the moon kids buy up every shitcoin because they think it is the real reversal now. if we do not reverse they will get burned hard. pumping shitcoins does not require as much money as pumping bitcoin...
because this would be probably the weakest beginning to a recovery btc has ever seen

go look at every other time the 1d RSI just bounced off of oversold and recovered and see what happened afterwards. Very high volume bounce that's a very clear reversal- this isn't that. 
because a trend change should have volume to back it up
Because: chart...and throw in some fundamentals in there too.
I'm expecting a small pullback, but nothing major. In fact, the pattern the last few days has been a slow and methodic increase in price. This is great since it gives the RSI to cool off a bit each retracement, without causing major panic. If anything, I'm expecting a pullback to 7600-7650, and then another try at 7800.

I really should watch RSI.  I try to keep my TA simple, but people seem to swear by RSI and the wisdom of crowds is sometimes correct.
How about if this reaches 7K before 10K you never post your bullshit again. If you don't have TA to back up anything you say or present a bearish and a bullish case, then you don't post at all. You GTFO. How about that? Same for your alt accounts.
> We're going to smash through $10K with such power that it will make your little heads explode. 

That is an incredibly delusional thing to say.  But there aren't that many BTC bag holders yet, because the price has only been higher than this for less than a year.
I’m really interested to know why your so certain about BTC “blasting through 10k”? Please explain how this will happen on short to midterm
Me too!
Edit: I flipped to short, thinking a correction might take place here.

Failed bull/bear flags 
good question
Even if we break upwards it will probably fall back down to the upper triangle trendline.  This has been the habit lately whenever it breaks a downward sloping trendline especially if it approaches the line sideways and let the line eventually come into it's path.  Probably due to lower volume.  BTC needs a layer 2 in order to reach another ATH in my opinion.  Too many alternative coins that can do what BTC does.  Imagine if all the dapps utilized BTC rather than an ERC20 token along with LIghtning, then you might have a case for a new ATH.

[Edit] There are actually better Bitcoins than BTC right now.
They can be angry all they want. We're still taking their money.

Thankyou.  Im a creative at heart, so have to find a ways to balance out all the technicals and numbers.

The different shades are just 50% and 75%. Its the 'Pitchfork' tool if you want to try it.  If you get the pivot points right, it's weird how well they are respected.

You think bitcoin is gonna stay within $1000 range for 2 months? No way.

Odds are it's not even gonna make it another week in this range
Thanks for your insight.  Yes, I'm anticipating a higher low than $7040.  

Happy to try a long if we can find support.

Because charts have proven to be so accurate here haven't they, I can also draw random lines on a chart and then make the price action fit my narrative afterwards, the MO of most here 

The trend is up...for a few days... Now zoom out
we've seen it quite a few times in the past 10 days. spike to 76-77, stable for a day or two, drop to 71-74, stable for a day or two, repeat. i dont think one can count on it forever but i also dont think we are done yet.
Pretty much this. No one worth their salt is going to take this tone.

RemindMe! One Week
this sub has become much more like ethtrader lately, I don't know why. I'm personally inclined to believe it's because we have one capitulation event left until the last wave of hodlers are broken but what do I know 

I remember hodlers/moonbois being much smarter/more articulate a few months ago...
True, but it's a mini version of the big H&S pattern that did confirm and we are now testing the neckline and so far failing. The inverse head & shoulders pattern seems to be having minimal follow through, was expecting us to blast through 7800 because I really did think this was a reversal. Now that I've looked at the overall market and see the same pattern everywhere and volume dropping where it's most needed \(reminds me of the second attempt at 11.7k and 10k\), I'm becoming a bit worried that this is a major lower high and the triangle formation is about to break down. Alts are also starting to see momentum dropping off at the same spot relative to BTC.   


And don't forget your late BCH pump as usual.

Hey man, just been lurking on and off. Still on my break from the charts since we went under $9k months ago. Focusing on other things at the moment, it's to easy for me to get consumed in this space. Hope you're doing well! 
I don's see that on tradingview, how do you watch it?
They already have their buy orders stacked in way lower before they shunt the order book! These things flash crash.  Up and down in minutes. Generally not a dip more of an insane wick
That is the idea. They could be shorting coins as part of their "stop hunting" with the hope of being able to cover after many stops are executed. 
let's say we both own 1000 BTC each. I then go to poloniex and start buying ETH, this means the ETH index on bitmex get's affected. Then, when I feel the buying pressure is gone, you  and me open a nice 20x leverage short ETHBTC on Bitmex.

I do a market sell, you place buy orders really low. We both benefit from our short position, and you have gained a lot more ETH or BTC than you could buy initially
While I don't have official confirmation/source, I'm almost certain circuit breakers have been added as well. Obviously they won't publicize the exact criteria, but I think they're there. It's done in a pretty slick way, it looks almost like trading engine lag/hiccup for a minute or so if the price takes a huge dump (but the site doesn't go down, market orders are just paused for a second but post-only orders still go through). Could just be a coincidence, but I've seen it a few times since the ETH $0.10 dump.
Sounds like a bug? I don't know then.

You hovered over the profit and it showed positive pnl and then was negative when you closed?
Yeah, if that shit tanked and never came back I think I'd start getting bullish 
I generally read others' TA and try to take a broader look at the combination of moving averages, volume and "momentum" (partly discerned through RSI), also higher/lower highs/lows, and price swings (wave patterns).
I mostly just look at RSI these days. I used to use the following on TradingView; Godmode3.1, SQZMOM\_LB \(similar to TTM Squeeze, look it up\), Phoenix 1.118. Its always fun to take a look at all these, but I only use them with 4h being the shortest timeframe and 1w being the longest. So between 4h and 1w. Now I just look at volume, candles and the casual drawing stuff along with RSI.  


Honestly, for me it never worked out all too well staring at all the indicators.  

No problem, that's not to say breaking the resistance line on the top of the triangle wouldn't be bullish...it's just that there won't be many skeptical people left at $12k+. That is the official "we have confirmed a double/triple bottom" point
I don't know if I'm on my own here.  
But r/r of buying in at $21k is way better than buying in at $12k.

$21k = guaranteed steam train FOMO.  $12k = not so much.

Would be interested in the more experienced traders opinions on this?
conjecture, opinion, informal polls within your "circle", "artificial", "manufactured". Please..do go on.
> That tells me that the dumps are manufactured and probably costing the perps a ton of money.

I was interested in what you were saying until you said this. The chances that this is costing the whales that are manipulating the market lots of money seems very doubtful. These dumps make them money... Tons of money....

Yeah this is what I should have added to my comment: a high volume breakout as confirmation...
I dont disagree with that at all. I was just pointing out his contradiction.
Awesome thanks 
bulls getting euphoric over 7% move. It's a relief rally primarily following eth, sure it could continue to go up but if it tanks these guys will be quiet and leave for weeks
Oh don't get me wrong friend. I am long and have been since 7140. I was discussing short entries.
Yeah, it is a smart play to be cautious when alts are pumping though, you’re not wrong at all. Just don’t expect BTC to necessarily follow. 
I agree, this is an altcoin post, even with the edit.
Hodlers really only have three possible options:

1) sell too early  
2) sell the top  
3) sell too late


It's not all about charts ya know. The majority of the market is psychologically and financially rektd trying to make sense of it all. Perfect ...
Hey I'm no expert. Just a dude looking at half a  wave and drawing the other half. Drawing straight lines on graph made up of waves doesn't make sense to me.
You don't recognize the iron eagle formation? Bears be f'd. Ka-boom. 
Yes that red channel.
A while ago, 2014
2014 is irrelevant.
Sure, from the ridiculous 20k all time high. I don't really consider that a fair comparison.For sure i think since Feb however it has been evenly matched.
That's my point. New money flows in via localbitcoins, paxful and numerous other OTC sites which are not tracked (to my knowledge). Here the volume is certainly not as high as in Dec but also not small by any means.
We also have exchanges like Kraken, Bithumb, ... as gateways for new money. Here the people just buy coins and go mostly to BitMEX (reduced counter party risk, better taxation in most countries, very low fees). Hence even if new money flows in you would probably see a decline in volume on these specific exchanges.
I'm not sure about the current status of new users but a couple months ago they had to wait incredibly long (3+ months) for verification which also indicates that new money can not flow in as fast as it would like. Some exchanges do not even accept new customers.

> because this would be probably the weakest beginning to a recovery btc has ever seen

Totally, provably incorrect.  Look at Sept 23-Oct 1 last year.  Then look what happened after that.  

Look at mid-August 2016 and what happened after.  Hell, I can probably give you one example per year.

This is probably the STRONGEST beginning to a recovery Bitcoin has ever seen.  Volume is ~~4x~~ 64x [edit 16B vs generously, 250M] what it was in the second example above.
Yeah the bartish movements really suck for short term trading for managing stops & RR.  But holding this range and with a gradual formation for the last week increases my confidence in bitcoin in general.
yes, but when we fell to 7040 they were, and now they are not anymore, they recovered, so it could happen that we fall further, roger?
RSI is one of the most important indicators to trade this market imho

It's coming because of what Bitmex offers, but not because of trades made on Bitmex. Whales can take large leveraged positions on Mex and then drop market orders on BFX, then close the position on Mex. Then they scale into a new position and do it again. 

Obviously conjecture, but it makes no sense *not* to do that given the options available if you're sitting on 4 figures of bitcoin. 
Bitcoin never had this extent of erratic behavior (there has always been the volatility) before Bitmex came with all of this leverage.  There has also always been stop hunting but this has magnified the result with these bear flags that break wildly up and bull flags that break wildly down.  
I've learned to ignore big-time upvoted comments (they're all, "Dudes, my line shows we're going to Goblin Town any minute!") and recover the downvoted ones.  I've found some real gems in the "comment score below threshold" comments on this sub, real moneymakers.

Yeah, you stink of denial. 
Ay vay! 
No fair.

Man I'd put you on ignore but you also have interesting conversations.
Back in the days, we held yearly award to those who contributes to this subreddit by votes. [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2r4gmt/rbitcoinmarkets_best_of_2014_awards_winners/) I was voted for technical analyst for publishing trades dated back consecutively for about 2 years. I have been less active, lurking nowadays.
Two ways of measuring volume during the peak, 
1. Bitcoin was more expensive back then and trading volume denominated in BTC is higher than today.
2. The USD value traded was higher than today.

If today's volume is equal to the peak, we should have doubled in BTC trading volume, since price is more than halved. However, we are trading at maybe half the BTC volume and 1/4 the USD volume. 

Edit: Guys, don't thinking too hard. Volume lower is lower, its relative by default. There isn't a rule of thumb on this.

If you know how to block users so I don't see their comments then I definitely want to know.
I agree with you 100%. I just found this to be very interesting. Rules change all the time in crypto which I find to be fascinating and keeps moonbois in check. If there is one thing that continues to concerns me is the declining volume. I have a hard time accepting all the theories I've read so far (less coins to sell, calm before FOMO storm, etc) which to me can be refuted by one simple explanation that no new money is coming into market. I can see BTC reaching the 8Ks but without massive manipulation I don't see how it can go higher. We literally flatline for almost a day then pump up/down while volume decreases/stays flat. That is not encouraging in a single bit and I would like some hopium.
Good on you for taking a break, this shit is truly too time consuming! you too mate 
What don't you see? That they are trying to break out? They just made a local high when you posted that so they are indeed trying to breakout. Although, like the other exchanges, they were rejected.
They’re like cockroaches—if (god forbid) bitcoin and other major cryptos crash, I’m confident dentacoin and the like will somehow outlive many
Your argument is absolutely valid, though at that point I think absolute values come into play as well. The required influx of capital (assuming mined coins are still sold constantly) would be substantial at that level for price sustenance. Therefore, though from a TA standpoint a breakout from a previous ATH is not a bad entry position, there will be an element of diminishing returns the higher we go.  
> Please..do go on.

OK, I will.

Without doxxing myself, let me just say that I run with a crowd of educated professionals. We are geographically and ethnically diverse, making our homes on different continents. I think we're a very representative sample of the market. A couple of us might even be considered whales. 

Some of us have been in this for a while and have enjoyed tremendous gains that put any short to shame. More of us have gotten in within the past year, including a couple who FOMOed in late last year. Nobody in this group is selling. So who is? Why? 

Among my crowd, the consensus is that the only reason to sell is if you are over-invested and in need of fiat. 

Personally, I would very much like to know who has been dumping because I would like to send them a thank-you note. They've done more good than they know in transferring their wealth to smarter people.
Yeh there is definitely not a set narrative taking place and it is way too early to flick the switch to full bull. I'm tempted to think the market won't let us continue to rise here as easily as we have from recent bottom 7050. It also isn't a stretch to suggest price to continue up here, collect a few more longs and tumble down quickly. Lots are itching for this market to turn bullish in the near term, doesn't mean it will.
4. don't sell
you forgot 4) never sell
I think I sold too late because it’s going down 
The other day I was looking at some trade history, saw the amount of ETH I was trading earlier this year, and got really pissed....  Like, damn, the HODLers were right...

But then I came to my senses.

My belief is that on average you have a lot more opportunity for gain with trading if you can do it well and be consistent.  If you went all in right now, lets suppose at best we hit 20k again by Next December.  So, at most lets say 200% gain.

If you can pull off 1% per day you are well beyond that.

But, I'm relatively new to this, so do any experienced traders agree?
I mean I completely agree as far as psychology driving a speculative market. But if you're going to be using charts to inform your trading, as he did, you should at least make them make sense.

I can draw a Mona Lisa (or anything) on a chart but that doesn't make it useful for trading.
That's what charts are...they are a result of the psychology and actions of market participants.
What you're trying to do is create a parabolic advance chart, which can be somewhat valuable as far as looking at long term trends but you need to go longer term with your chart to do so. Look at the parabola from 2013 and how 2014 acted when that parabolic advance was violated - look how it forms a second parabolic advance into 2018 that was, once again, violated.

History doesn't necessarily define future price action, but if you're trying to draw that parabola you're likely drawing it with far too large of a second derivative.

I'll edit this post with a chart.
How is it irrelevant? It's something Bitcoin has experienced before. It makes a shitload more sense to compare to Bitcoin 2014 than to compare to any other asset class's chart.

We can easily just derp around for the rest of the summer like 2014  before our next leg lower.
go look at any bubble chart 

"This time is different"

If you ever wonder how millions of people throughout history fall for the same thing over and over again, look no further. Just think about why you're so convinced this time is different 
okay dude if you just ignore parts of the charts then yes, it looks great. But you can't do that anymore than I can cut off $0-6000 and say we're only up 25% 
> You know full well which exchange is the go to for new money and how it's doing in terms of vol

But his post was a subjective opinion of his next moves?? There never was any fucking prediction, you unicorn fart. I agreed, because thats what Im going to do. You should learn to read, but then also comprehend young child. All the best
I agree with this, charts never looked like this (and I have gone back and checked charts to make sure), it was more organic steps up and down which encouraged people to think they knew what it would do next.  I think the overall impact on the new people (or even the old people or maybe it is even right) to crypto is they see the BTC price as massively manipulated and they are shellshocked and don't know what to do and don't really want to play the game when big red or green dildos can randomly appear out of nowhere.

Very similar to this-
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness
>Most of the Group 3 dogs – which had previously learned that nothing they did had any effect on shocks – simply lay down passively and whined when they were shocked.
thanks
Ah yes. I understand what the moving average is saying and i expect the price to leave to the upside. 

But when price respects the 0 line as well as it has in this example it is rare for it to leave so easily.  Normally a rejection at the boundary, pull back, but not far enough to touch the 0 line and then exit on the 2nd try.

If you look up how to trade with a pitchfork that's called a price failure.
You can draw all the shapes you want. Bitcoin is very volatile, there is no way it stays in that triangle that long. Can you find a single period in the last two years where bitcoin has been that flat? 

I think our current uptrend will continue and we will test 9k in about  a week, and 10k by early July. I do not see us going below 7000.

Edit: I think this could happen even faster but I'm being conservative
Exactly!

> If today's volume is equal to the peak, we should have doubled in BTC trading volume, since price is more than halved. However, we are trading at maybe half the BTC volume and 1/4 the USD volume.

Does that really make sense though? Volume is relative to the market, which is proportional to the market cap to some degree. I think the volume relative to the float and circulating supply (and market cap) is more relevant than overall USD volume.

so you asked a couple of your internet friends around the world and extrapolated the results to give a globally accurate picture?

I think I've heard it all now
If you notice, btc buys come in huge spurts because a whale is transferring the btc to alts to pump them. 

Alts will get dumped on yet again and imo we'll continue downwards after whales drop their bags yet again. Who knows how long it'll be though. could be here, $8.2k, or $9k.

The reason we're seeing lower highs is because whales can only pump so much, they rely on retail to buy the rest. Retail has been leaving/uninterested/already bought in so each run up is weaker and weaker. 

Higher highs because euphoria is ever present and BTFD mentality still there. This will coil/reverse after retail realizes their bags are extremely heavy

Bro if you're getting getting a 1&#37; profit per day in a long term capacity then you're one of the best traders on the planet.
I think 1% a day is a little ambitious, although you'll have days that eclipse it. That said, I'm over 200% in the last 90 days, but 90% of that came in a single 8-day trade. If you're talking the major coins, yes, you can often do better than holding if you don't go crazy with leverage or trade emotionally. There are some alts out there with the potential to 10x even from here, but alts aren't really my thing currently. I'd love to diversify into them once I get to the BTC level I want to be. 

Edit: I'm not that experienced compared to many in this sub. 
1% per day makes 10k into $377,834 in one year.  I would say no one can daytrade anything remotely like that.

Here's u/Ibankbtc's [performance](http://ibankbitcoins.com/bitcoin-trade-performance) over three years and I would say he is very good.  He was up 175%.
My chart makes sense. The lines aren't meant to precisely fit, just tease out the overall shape of the wave. The bottom line admittedly doesn't fit quite right. But overall you have to admit that the downward trend seems to be flattening out.
It does make sense, from a triple bottom perspective. It's textbook.

OP is new so you at least gotta give them some credit for seeing the waves!
There's nothing we can compare to. Bitcoin's price is not in a vacuum any longer. There's a shit ton of alts that influence its price, that's in addition to the fundamentals and multiple exchanges across the globe compared to just one or two or however many it was in 2014. Its a completely different market compared to 2014. I don't think 2014 is relevant at all.
im not saying its different. I am personally bullish but the point of my post was that there hasnt been confirmation of a bubble pop...its been a consolidation for the past 6 months. If BTC does break down below 6900 and stay there it could be a prolonged bear market. 
Even if you accepted my ignoring the final leg up to 20k which occurred in just a few days...It still doesn't look "great". It looks indecisive. We could have a leg down to 4000 range still at this point. I don't know. I am bullish based on fundamentals but only time will tell.
Well maybe you can enlighten me then rather than giving vague passive aggressive comments. Please tell me how you quantify less than pitiful, pitiful, low, medium, high volume.
Look at the volume, Jethro, and stop hitting Granny's hooch.  You guys were discussing volume.  This volume is incredibly high compared to those periods.

Also, you can bet on one of those VVBGDs any day now. 
I don't know I just went on Tradeview and saw that first week of Jan had 5.
He's being sarcastic 
I logged out and back and just got the test notification on pushbullet. Might be working now. 
just upvote it and move on, redditors in general don't like "this" type comments 
Maybe just upvote next time. 
I don't think that on longer time frames it is pushing the price action any place other than where it would get eventually anyways just in a more abrupt way.  The big change for me is I no longer trade with stops.  I set alarms now and don't really trade crypto on lower time frames.  All of my day trades and shorter time frames are trading stock or commodities.

Cool, I will have a chat with you next week on this topic to see how well we fair. 
Everyone has differing time frames. Hence why I said bullish short term, bearish medium term and bullish long term. 
Nope, that's an actual meme.

The lowest point of 2018 happened 4 months ago and price has only made higher lows since. It's literally 25% above that ATL right now.
Rule 1
I kind of get the desperation- if we were at like $11.7k and I *REALLY* wanted this to tank I'd be more convinced than ever that that was the top. If it tanks here these guys are shit out of luck and are going to start panicking because there's absolutely 0 way you can spin it as bullish. So this is essentially the last stand before they have to capitulate and admit they're holding insanely heavy bags
Just as apocalyptic as I’d imagined your secrets would be
Jolly cuss it was right after new years haha. 2014 were dark times. Obituaries were frequent, there were few exchanges and all had major bugs/issues. Most of my trades were shorts as BTC price fell from 600 to lower prices. My old blog still had the [trade record](http://ibankbitcoins.com/bitcoin-trade-performance)

look at the usernames, do you recognize any of them? I know zane is still around.
For trading, jesse livermore and mark Douglas, reminenciences of a stock operator, and trading in the zone.
And the weekly candle ends at wednesday/thursday midnight, wtf is that?  (so many misguided posts in here referencing the weekly and its implications assume that it closes on a sunday)

at least chad is fun to read.
Yeah, I know what you mean. Its an unfortunate vocal minority. I hope that people like you keep posting.

Some of the OG, like Merlin, stopped posting some time ago and I agree with you that quality has dropped. Still the best in reddit, but not as good. 
I definitely ironically upvote Chad. 
# #BringBackDushmanKush
How do I report to Reddit? Pm one of the mods? Tia
Thanks!
Thanks. I remember that period distinctly because I bought the China FUD BTC and that was the first time putting money into the market in almost 4 years prior. I just never paid attention to volume since I was making money not knowing WTF I was doing and just being lucky, but thinking I knew what I was doing. Good times. Looking forward to those days again but I don't think we ever see Dec 2017 type of btc/alt run ever again.
I am indeed. So are you. The difference is that I know it, and you don't. 
In other words, you don't have any response. I was hoping you would at least come at me with some nonsense about how all your co-workers at Taco Bell are freaking out and putting their money back in the bank.
Hope so too... and even better, I hope by that time we don't need to convert to fiat anymore, and just spend crypto.
This is probably the one opportunity we have to create intergenerational wealth and who wants to mess that up? I'll be honest. I have been parting with some. But only what I need to keep food in the fridge, the lights on, the bill collectors at bay etc. It's any ones guess how Bitcoin is going to behave in the short term and you guys can trade to your hearts content, that's not for me. I'm in this for the long haul. There is a saying "wanting is better than having". Once you can actually buy the Lambo it's kind of empowering not to.
Haven’t sold yet so 😉
I don't think I'm that good, but thanks!
Congrats on that trade man; good job!
So, part of that is that you wouldn't trade 10k the same as 300k, right?  The risk tolerance would go down as the balance increases. 
 And you need to eat once in a while, so I think more common would be to keep your trading stack relatively constant and extract your gains when appropriate.
Wow someone quoted my record, I want to add that the gainloss were counted trade by trade, so the gains are non compounding, but they are.

It's far too early in the parabola to do any real projections with it. Your chart shows one of the more bullish scenarios for it to play out, but looking at the 2014 bear market, there are clearly many more ways it could go following the violation of a parabolic advance and the only true example we have would be one of the more bearish scenarios. This could just be a brief sideways symmetrical triangle period on a slow and gradual descent.

No two bubbles are alike, so I'm not saying I think 2014 is doomed to repeat itself. Just saying it's too early to be making the conclusions you're jumping to.

When you're making that type of chart, you need to zoom way out; zooming in as much as you are results in capturing too much noise.
Yeah, the space has changed for the better - that's why the price is much higher than in the past. I don't care if Bitcoin is one of the most promising assets, you gotta be able to call a bubble when you see one. And looking back at Bitcoins passed parabolic rises can give you an idea. The good thing about Bitcoin is that it's not going to fall lower from where it came. I don't give a crap where we bottom - 2k, 3k, 4k, 5k - we're still on track for a bullish long-term.

Yes. Myand my point is 2014 went to $11.5k from here  and then down to $3k later. Bubble pops are not obvious in the middle. They do not sell off to 20% ATH in a few months
look at the volume on the $3k bounce. The volume on what you're talking about is very low compared to the $3k bounce.

BTC had already "recovered" by then.

Comparing this massive ranging to those 5 days is an entirely different scenario

I don't care about the volume from last year. I care about the volume now. Right now the volume is pitiful in relation to even a few weeks ago when we were dumping off of $10k. 

The volume now is higher than it was when btc was $10. No one cares. The volume relative to even just a few weeks ago is very low. This does not indicate a strong recovery. We need expanding volume on a breakout- not a decreasing volume crawl upwards
I had a small add to my short hit at 7748 earlier tonight. I'm now no longer just hedged, but about 1.5x short.

!short XBTM18 add 7748 10%
Let me know if it keeps working or if it stops notifying again so i can warn other users about it.

Let's wait and see. You cannot deny we are in a bear market. There are also precious if any bullish signs at this point for the medium term.
It is still far more likely we will retest our previous lows and should we do so, it is more than likely we'll break under them 
You underestimate how delusional I am, my dear Sloppy
The thing is, it's not desperation. When you know, you know ... ya know!?
>look at the usernames, do you recognize any of them?

I just always assume some became filthy rich and live on an island somewhere and the rest gambled away all their BTC daytrading and can't look at any crypto news or BTC price quotes ever again.

An interesting side note is that u/qwsazxcde1, the creator of the famous quote "1D EMA JUST CROSSED OVER. THIS IS GENTLEMEN." just got himself his first new car so he at least has some money.  It's a Subaru not a Lambo though, maybe he's just a smart shopper.

When you say obituaries, do you mean traders were actually killing themselves at that time?
Thank you! I listened to reminisces years back but I’ll have to listen again!

I don't mind Chad lol its the ones who take themselves too seriously that make it like ethtrader lol 
Well merlin did post recently, and he said we're potentially on the cusp of a truly bearish trend. People gave him shit for it I think lol it annoyed me that they didn't realize who he was 
Hit the 3 dots under the post (if on mobile) and hit report. On desktop I think there's just a report button under each post? 
🤦🏼‍♀️
I'm blown away by how good of a troll this is/how much of a twat you are. You just keep on keeping on, great laugh this has given me before bed. Gona sleep good.
Yeah... don't.  Voice of experience here.
I can't tell if you're kidding or not but seriously, I know you're new at this so please do not expect to get those kind of returns.

Yes, you will have some good days. No, those good days & bad days combined will not average a 1&#37; gain per day over a period of years.
That was my mega short from 8310 to 7340 haha. More than made up for a half dozen 1%-3% losses leading up to it haha 
>Unless he is setting his returns aside the gain on each trade is with respect to the new principal, I calculate he has made 19.55X return on investment! 

I see this in the comments there, do you think that is pretty accurate?
- The 2014 bubble did not have a support line that had been true and tested for a year

- The 2014 bubble did not bounce off this support line 3 times

- The 2014 bubble did not make higher lows...several consecutive times in a row on a strong and well tested trend line. In fact it made lower lows until we got to "This point" (according to you) before the big run up and the eventual slow bleed to 160 dollars.

I'm not claiming that I know anything, you could be right. I could be right. Anything could happen.

I will become bearish when we break down this support that is currently hovering at 7000. That's reasonable isn't it?

would be crazy to see us hit 5 green days for the first time in a long time. 

Let's hope that mempool backup is people getting ready to dump! Lol

the fact that we've been climbing with decreasing volume says "short this" to me. But who knows, it's hard not to doubt yourself in these situations
Thanks man!

I understand completely. I just find it unbelievable that people think we are almost out of the bear market 
It's only a bear market if the price actually makes a lower low, it's consolidating as far as anyone here knows.

It's funny, really. For the ~1.5 months of actual "bear market" we had, a lot of people (myself included) were in a somewhat state of denial. Then for the last 4 months we had endless streams of FUD and a lot of people displaying strong conviction that we're in a bear market, yet not a single lower low was produced in this time.
lol well I don't think you're overleveraged or holding that heavy of bags. Some of the guys here have blown their load between $6-9k and if we drop below it those bags are gonna hurt 
Checking in 🤙 I still got my trophy or no?
there was a website called isbitcoindead.com, people quit crypto, gave up on it, lost their savings, on borrowed money when price tumbled.
Getting syntax error on line 1
because i dont spend 200 dollars on dinner? lmfao, unless you literally have enough money to wipe your ass with 100 bills then its pretty irresponsible to spend that kinda money on dinner.
Yeah, i saw, bummed me out. He should come back, but I don't blame him. 
Ah, ok. Seemed mighty manual. Thanks man.
So far most days I actually try come in at 2-3%.  Passive days where it is in the background while I'm doing my day-job are hit and miss, sometimes 1%, sometimes -4%...

The biggest issue I have is figuring out how to unplug without losing a position.  I set stops and get fucked by wicks, I don't set stops and get fucked by barts.  I sit in fiat and get depressed when I come back to a major pump...
yeah that's pretty reasonable. That's about as logical as you can get with bullishness here. I just thought you were saying there hasn't really been a downtrend. There definitively was one. 

Due to the nature of blow off tops you can't really ignore them; they provide significant technical and psychological resistance for years. Look how hard it was to pass $1150 in 2016/2017 
let’s hope? why would we want that? I understand expecting it but hoping? ain’t down with the corn no more?
I just personally think if we break down from the wedge it's probably goijng below $7k. I'd be very annoyed if we spent 3-4 weeks here
LOL yea. I agreed with you though! Just thought your time frames were confusing :P
Yea, the last time I used leverage was in July last year. The market's irrationality almost rekt me when it went down to $1800, I ended up holding through and closing in good profit when the segwit drama was resolved successfully, but I haven't leveraged since, that shit was intense.
Yup! It looks awesome
Trophy intact!

Miss ya buddy, don't be a stranger! You still in the game?
hey ibankbtc, LTNS! 

looks like that website is dead. irony eh?
Spoken like a true poor.
And that's exactly why 1% a day forever is unlikely
Unless we see a bitcoin ETF this year, I don't expect to see new highs for Bitcoin in 2018...but we could potentially approach 15k or so once again by December unless we break down below 7000 and all hodlers like myself get fucked in the ass sideways.

I did like Datadash's view on a 50k BTC by Dec 2019...though I think 50k is hard to believe in just 6 months.
I want a clearer sense of direction. I don't think this will recover for a while and I'd rather have it be obvious than break upwards out of the triangle just yo see it meander around and bleed for 6 months 

I mainly just want to make money :p

only poor people brag about having wealth on the internet
Yeah, I think the answer is to just stay in fiat when not active or maybe part fiat part crypto.  My biggest obstacle is my emotions.  I know I didn't lose anything, but waking up to a 10% pump I wasn't a part of is a fear that keeps me in positions longer than I should be.

Anyway, for now I'm happy plugging away, trying to hit my daily numbers.  I do think that setting a modest daily goal is good, instead of pushing your luck to get home runs, which feels more like gambling.
Heard that. Get yr money bub! Good luck 
Glad to hear you're still in it, and congrats on the gains! Enjoy the Subie, looks like it's a blast!
