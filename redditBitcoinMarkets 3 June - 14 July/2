[Daily Discussion] Friday, July 13, 2018 -- TITLE
#New post: [\[Daily Discussion\] Saturday, July 14, 2018 →](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8yqktp/daily_discussion_saturday_july_14_2018/)
 The Bitcoin market failed to test the resistance zone again, and soon  after, we found the support levels to weak to sustain the previous run.  Bitcoin dropped quite sharply to about $6100 where we saw the buyers  showing their interest again. What to look out for going into the  weekend, [lets take a look at the contradicting signals](https://cryptosignals.trade/forums/topic/bitcoin-btc-price-analysis-july-2018/#post-17919) on the chart. 

I see quite a lot of market reports on Tradingview and in our  community focusing on the possibility of a inverse H&S pattern  forming. It is important to remember that this formation will only be  considered when ALL the conditions are met. Until then it is just a  “possible Inv H&S”. I see that many traders are stating that it is  already a confirmed pattern, this is false, we will need to see the  prices break above the neckline to confirm this as possible bullish  reversal pattern.

Notice how the possible Inv H&S is busy trading inside what some  would call, a massive bear flag. I will take both situations into  consideration and will prepare myself in the following manner. Should  prices drop below $6100, i would expect the $6000 level to get tested,  should this fail as support I will consider going short on the markets  again, target will most likely be the previous lows that got tested.

Should the prices consolidate above $6380, I will expect a retest of  the previous resistance levels, which happens to be our INV H&S  necline. There could be a quick long to play between $6400 –  $6600/$6800, if the market graces us with the above mentioned scenario.

For those looking at the safest entry into the market, be patient and  wait for the market to consolidate above $6800 – $7000 before going  long.

That's my first trade using /u/justanotherlogin 's position bot. I've been staying out of trading for a while because I've been unwilling to take out shorts and the market has been overwhelmingly bearish.  I'm not convinced that we're turning things around yet, but I'm going to make a go of at least breaking even again.

Someone recently referenced the recreation I did of /u/azop 's stability analysis on TV:

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/EwsyTSJs-Projecting-From-Stability/

I've been privately questioning the validity of that ever since I published it. Take a look at where we're at with daily BBand Width:
 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZwsbHQgf/

We're in range of stability we've seen in the past near market bottoms, but we haven't hit the mark yet.

What happens on the weekly?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/UtKZeOqr/

That looks a little closer. So, maybe this is a stable period, or maybe it's just kinda-sorta stable. I think we need more data to decide that.

How do we get more data if we can't speed up time? One option is to look at the composition of order volume. The most popular tool we have for that is [OBV](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/onbalancevolume.asp).

Look at OBV to see if smart money is starting to buy when less professional investors are selling. Conversely, OBV highlights smart money is selling when others are buying. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/oyKT3vh9/

See that OBV has moderate divergence and that since the price has dropped 15% as a percentage of ATH OBV has stayed within a 2% range. If we were, hypothetically, in a period of distribution then we should see OBV dropping more rapidly than the the price because smart money is attempting to sell without substantially changing the price. You can see that happening near the ATH on the left side of [that example](https://www.tradingview.com/x/oyKT3vh9/).

I've been claiming that the market is in a period of consolidation and accumulation when, in retrospect, it looks like it was in distribution during those periods. If you're reading this you should know that I'm blind when it comes reading distribution and accumulation. In this analysis I'm trying to lean more on technicals and not base it on any feeling I have about current market conditions. If you see a gap in that, please point it out.

Also look at the sine wave indicator. The sine wave indicator measures momentum and paints a clear picture of bull vs bear momentum in the market.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/RtrEKw8k/

With the Sine Wave at the bottom and starting to point up, we have a strong buy recommendation from that indicator.

Based on these observations I set targets for a small market entry.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/aStG1Eg9/

I've been staying out of trading because I've been very uncertain about this market, and I still feel the same way, but I'm going to start testing the water again with my trading stack.
Ok so time for some TA, TA which some have described as "like eating a turd sandwich and then frenching your mother"...but which part are you frenching you may ask, whichever place you find the most horrific.

ICHIMOKU CLOUD

- We are now below the 1, 2 and 4 hour clouds and the Kijuns on the 2 and 4. Bearish as balls to be frank

- Looks like we have some very weak support from the 1 hour Kijun which is currently sitting at 6235 (Binance), but I wouldn't put any faith whatsoever in that doing much of anything

- The 2 hour cloud turned bearish, 4 hour still bullish for now but expect that to change soonish

- The bottom of the 4 hour cloud sits at 6300ish with the top of cloud and the Kijun sitting at around 6460, it'll take some effort to breach that I suspect

MOVING AVERAGES

- The ol trusty 144WMA and 5 SMMA is pretty much just terrible. Again, we are crossed to the negative on the 4hr, 2, 1, and 30. The 30 is currently getting rejected for a cross to the upside. 

- The 4hour crossed to the negative on the 11th July, the last negative cross occurred on the 10th June and sent us to the yearly low.

RSI/CCMI http://imgur.com/dLyt0EC

- The daily RSI currently sitting just above 40, aiming down and with plenty of space to fall. The RSI support line is pretty close, in and around 37/38. Watching to see if this breaks. Likely to be pretty grim news if it does
- The Composite Momentum Index is now hitting into it's support line as well, seems to be damn close to breaking under. Will be watching it closely, very useful indicator and very helpful for determining trend in the past

MACD http://imgur.com/QKPHzg9

- There is a potential hidden bullish divergence on the 4hour... but I'm not entirely sure if it counts as one and it's pretty weak to me even if it does

SUPPORT/RESISTANCE http://imgur.com/v0P3EaU

- Well, seemingly there isn't really much. We have a weak 2 point of contact resistance line in and around 6080
- After that there is one more 2 contact point, sitting at 5890... basically we haven't got a lot of anything between us and a new low.

FIBs and shiz http://imgur.com/Dr7Qlck

- Daily Fibs for today in theory shouldn't see us going much lower than 6070, if we do i'd hazard a guess it'll be no lower than 6000 for today. 
- The upper range, probably no higher than 6380. Again if we do... top level for me would be around 6450

$$$Bear Market over magic numbers...
- 9200. That's above the ATH trend line by some way and above the daily Ichimoku Cloud 

Difficult read right now. I was able to exit my position that I got stopped into (6250) last night at 6270 following the small pump for break-even. Lots of positives and negatives for bulls right now:

- 4H MACD has crossed bullish and 1D is close.
- Bull Div on the higher time frames.
- Price has been resting atop the 1H 12/26EMA overnight.

- The price has been rejected multiple times from the 4H 12/26EMA overnight. I'll be watching this closely. If we can hold above the 4H EMA set I will look to take a position.
- RSI has reset on most time frames, so there is plenty of room for a lower low over the weekend.
- Longs continue to be significantly higher than shorts on BFX.
- The 6300 range is now serving as resistance where it once was support. 

I'll be setting stop buys above 6400. I think with the Bullish evidence available, if we can break that level we can expect continuation to retest 6800. However, I find it much more likely that we move down from here to test the 5700 support over the next week.

Current support: 6139, 6075

Current resistance: 6284, 6395

4H Chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/FqzrH8II/
Exiting my $6120 long here... may be a bit premature, but this looks to be struggling.  Will re-enter if we get a sustained move above $6400, or if sellers fail to push this below prior low.

Edit: Moved into a short with stops just above $6400

Edit 2: Stops moved to break even in the event this tries to make a heroic recovery
Coinbase announces adding all these new coins and their pumps get faded. Late last year, these coins would have gone up 100%+ on the news. Crazy how the sentiment has changed..
Been a while since I posted. Have been playing the chop chop, and probably making less than minimum wage for my time. The market hasn't given much for really nice risk/reward entries worth posting about over the past couple weeks.

Here are my charts now, and a summary for what I've been doing the past few weeks:

Finex: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/KVJLQUQm/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/KVJLQUQm/)

Coinbase: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/k11je502/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/k11je502/)

Zoomed in here a little on the finex chart (shorter timeframe): [https://www.tradingview.com/x/0reHSK8U/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/0reHSK8U/)

I was a big proponent that the red down channel meant something. I was trading that thing almost all of May/June, and it worked out really well for me. I think traders were a bit taken aback by the breach of the trendline on 6/29 (myself included). The price went from the middle of the channel, to straight up break through, without resistance or sell pressure. It was very odd, IMO. Not "organic", not sure what to make of it. I personally bought that breach on 7/1 @ 6300, but with a medium position, and ended up closing at break even a few days ago. (I really thought we would see a significant move up, so I held onto that position for a while).

I am not sure what to make of this pattern, but I am leaning bullish here.

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/QnakYp4w/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/QnakYp4w/)

A whole lot of credence shouldn't be given to this slight short term uptrendline (Wise to put oneself in check, even if you want to make something of the downtrend break 6/29... the action isn't adding up). That being said, I think it is something worth trading with a small stack. RSI and MACD cross on the 4hr is encouraging, but take it with a grain of salt (makes up less than 10&#37; of my trade reasoning here). I entered here at 6150, long, with a medium position and a stop below 6050. I am not sure I will short the breakdown there, but maybe I will. We are firmly in "Get chopped and screwed" territory, IMO.

Curious to see what you guys have to say about the action. As always, happy trading out there, folks.

\*\*Ehhhhdit: Closed my long, 6220. Not liking this on the short timeframes: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/5AhFsjzR/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/5AhFsjzR/)

Will look to get back in around 6100. Trading these short timeframes are not my forte. Just keeping it honest here, I am a bit spooked, and want to take a few hundred bucks profit. I don't like any position at this juncture.
People just gotta sell into any pump. Damn bear markets. 
This is gonna be just hilarious if it goes bull trap, bear trap, break out....
I just discovered a useful Coinbase Pro behavior! Probably old news to most, but if not:

If you click on a certain price in the Charts tab, and then click back into the Trade tab, it autofills that price into the Limit Price field. Not a big deal, but kind of handy. 
I don't even have fun anymore, at least last year you could ride the waves and scale in and out and trying strategies, now it's more of a meta game of taking positions before Barts 
This drop is also looking lackluster and frankly I'm feeling a bit confused about direction .. if this doesn't push below $6100, price may reverse yet again.. there is a [rounded bottom pattern](https://www.tradingview.com/x/VjC6pAuN/) forming on the hourly, but this pattern breaks down the moment price moves about a hundred bucks south.

I've set stops on my short to break-even and going to just let this one ride... good luck out there.

Edit:  Decided to bail on my short at $6200 for a messily $75 per coin gain.  Right now better r:r to short below $6k or long above $6400.  Will wait for the market to decide 
Has anyone noticed that the coinbase pro logout screen example interface is basically a whale's account? 13million cash, 1400 BTC just sitting, quarter million dollar sells on the books etc?

Got a chuckle from that.
We just went below recent support level (6218 on GDAX) with that drop. Likely more downward movement to follow.
This guy on BFX sure likes to market buy BTC 9 at a time, there is some seriously different buying going on right now. Maybe nothing/could just be noise, but it feels/looks abnormal.

edit: it's paused for now
Are we all being cognitively dissonant trying to do TA on a “market” that only changes direction sharply on the 1 minute chart? Where there’s no real trading volume. Where there’s no real world usage of the asset to drive demand? 

I’m bullish long term on BTC, but at the moment, trying to do TA on a market that seems to be held together with sticky tape and glue makes me want to head for the exits for a few months. 
All the market does is bounce between levels until something gives.... don't let anyone tell you otherwise. I'm leaning bullish because this is a 4hr/1D level versus 1hr resistance.

Waiting for that Friday 13th dump
Taken from today's report. 

BTC Macro: Stoch RSI getting pretty high on the overbought levels on the 3 day.  It's good to note that the 3d is in conflict with the 1d & 1week which are both showing oversold levels or near to it. 
We'll be waiting on confirmation of this iH&S that is being tracked.  Remember this pattern isn't to be traded on until it's completed unlike some other setups.  Consider accordingly.

BTC Local: I'm enjoying watching the 12 hour on this one.  We've got some oversold levels here on the 12 hour as well which is in agreement with 1 day & 1 week RSI levels. Looking at low volume atm though, I'm it's be nice to see this break upwards as the whole setup to 6900 and test of the downtrend looks great, however I'm not expected a lot of it necessarily, wouldn't be surprised if we just traded sideways out of here or barted down. 

if you want to see associated charts for some reason they're in today's release. 
https://steemit.com/crypto-news/@jcharming/the-daily-dimes-a-cryptonews-publish-07-13-18
I know it's completely disconnected from BTC, but it's an interesting read about price manipulation of stocks:

https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/elon-musk-vs-short-sellers.118431/

My conclusion is: if those things happen on daily basis on regulated stocks market, then people who think crypto market isn't manipulated in any way are just delusional.
I'm still sitting in fiat from the 10k rejection in May. I made one trade two weeks back buying at $5925 when big volume came in and sold around the $6400 mark, just 1x with a nice stack. Still just wanting to accumulate more USD instead of BTC until I can get a good entry further down on a long term long position as close as I can poke down in the basement. Won't bother DCA holding til sub 5.5k. 

Waiting for a 5800 test now. But not being incognizant of a chooch back up to test that 6800 resistance. Keeping my alerts tight on price action and volume and carry my LTE laptop everywhere. 

[I expanded on a 1W log chart](https://www.tradingview.com/i/QgwvYfmB/) someone else here made a few days ago, I still think we have a room to go down to low 4's maybe a candle down into the 3's on the 1W and then sideways movement like we did in 2014 but I don't think it will take as long as it did then for recovery.

Don't get your nuts stuck in a toaster boys.  
Does anyone factor in the "Fear and Greed Index" into their TA?
How so?  Just curious.

moment of truth, does this get past $6350 or not
nice timing of announcement coinbase, right when dump,
ada chart is is full BOGGED

Just wanted to throw up a few divergences here. I want to be clear they're pretty speculative and not confirmed on other more common indicators - take them with a gain of salt. They can possibly be taken as signs of accumulation though.

[https://imgur.com/a/HTQjqT](https://imgur.com/a/HTQjqTS)S

1. CMF and MFI - Chaikin Money Flow is showing a hidden bullish divergence on the 12 hr. Very strong difference in price, but the difference in CMF is slight. MFI, which is used in the calculation for CMF and is something like a volume weighted RSI, more clearly shows the divergence. More information on CMF: [http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart\_school:technical\_indicators:chaikin\_money\_flow\_cmf](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:chaikin_money_flow_cmf). Basically, the price has failed to make a new low despite being in the face of a perceived stronger selling pressure (measured through a combination of volume and where candles close in relation to their high/low), meaning strong support.
2. OBV - a more common indicator, only volume based, is showing a bull divergence on a much shorter time frame for the 12 hr (small blue arrows). I'm especially skeptical of the validity of this divergence as the time frame we're looking at for it would probably be better suited for a 4 hr or 1 hr chart, where the divergence is not present.

So, more reliable divergence on lesser used indicators and a sketchy divergence on *one* time frame of *one* of the more common indicators. Feel free to take it into account however much you please.

200 ema on 3d is acting as support for whatever reason
For those of you who are currently sitting in FIAT and  would like to short on BitMex, how would one open a new short position on Bitmex without leverage?

Would one simply use 20&#37; of the FIAT to BUY bitcoins, send those to BitMex, open up a 5X Leverage Short on Bitmex, to essentially  be 100&#37; short BTC?

Or use 50&#37; of the FIAT To BUY bitcoins, send those to BitMex, and open up a 2X Leverage Short on BitMex to be essentially 100&#37; short BTC but with a higher liquidation price?
Been messing with some ICT PA concepts today and yesterday. Only just started so a lot of can be wrong but i think im in love.

Heres what im looking at and what i think is happening: https://www.tradingview.com/x/pZjQ0lKN/

1) Daily bear block thats been tested 6-7 times. I believe that weakness it, making another attempt likely to break it.

2) Daily bull block that failed to support price on its way down making it a bearish breaker (resistance)

3) Daily bear block

4) Daily bear block that failed to reject price on its way up making it a bullish breaker (support)

5) 4H bull block that’s not been tested yet (potential support)

These levels can be used in various ways depending on what youre trying to do. I'd look for longs at the lows (supports) and for shorts at the top (resistances).

This is a play im considering to try out my block knowledge: https://www.tradingview.com/x/VUob8cZW/

Shorting the bearish breaker (2). Not too sure about targets, probably a mix of block (4), (5) and fibs. Stops probably just before bear block (1). Don’t wanna be shorting whilst that thing gets smashed through. Still though, just an idea for now. I believe the fib matches ICT's optimum trade entry levels but im not sure on that.
I've been trying to answer my own [unanswered question](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8y6i8u/daily_discussion_thursday_july_12_2018/e29myoc) from yesterday's daily by learning  about [bullish catapults](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:pnf_charts:pnf_catapults) in [PnF charting](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:pnf_charts:pnf_basics), but can't grasp it,  not even a little.

Does anyone know where we are on [this chart?](https://imgur.com/a/zAxpOgN) I guess I need to make my own PnF as Eco/Merlin killed it in the Great Bear Winter.
The fake pumps were so obvious (mentioned it: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8wyyub/daily_discussion_sunday_july_08_2018/e1ztfrj/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8xlbz1/daily_discussion_tuesday_july_10_2018/e242lkc/)), the whole pumps and their volumes were concentrated in 15-30 mins candle and then it was a slow bleeding up until the next pump...

Bulls just made it worse for themselves now: 1h, 2h, 4h, 6h, 1d, 3d 1w looks very bearish RSI is reset on most intervals with enough room for the price to continue bleeding before being oversold, Ichimoku cloud also confirms that and the MACD looks just beautiful on all the intervals.

Another failed attempt at 6300, still sticking to my under 6k call for the day.
We'll know in about 2 weeks if this is mooning or dooming. https://i.imgur.com/HGOG5nR.png

People getting chopped alive right now instead of just waiting for the big move.
Looks like I got some fills over 6300 on sept futures. Not sure if that is the top of this bounce or not (there is a large hourly bull div playing out), but the resistance level is clear and the buying volume has decreased substantially. The current hourly candle looks pretty bearish too right now.

https://imgur.com/a/BkWithf


My Blockfolio alerts are often so delayed and/or messed up that they are useless.  Just by a miracle I was reading here and checking the price manually and saw the anemic pump and drop in time.  What do people use for fast reliable price alerts?  Or is it just my Blockfolio that is slow with alerts?
OK, novice here, advice appreciated. Into the idea of trading larger time frames, not day trading or scalping. Ultimate goal is over time to obtain more BTC over the long term.

Working with a small trading stack which is 100% fiat ATM. Taking seriously the suggestion I've heard from a number or traders that this 58xx-68xx range is largely untradeable (unless you're a highly disciplined scalper), no clear supports or resistances in this range, super choppy.

I still don't see the larger IH&S formation invalidated yet, so I have a buy order set to trigger right at 6800, just at the neckline. I figure if that hits there could be an explosive move up, particularly since this would clear multiple resistances at once. Target would be 7400, roughly. 

My next two orders, the other half of my stack, hit at 5500 and 5850, which I figure we will eventually  get to if we fail to bust through 6800 again. Will plan to buy more if we head further down there (4k levels). Not sure what the target would be if we headed that low. Might just stick a bunch in cold storage and forget about it at those prices.

Does this sound like a reasonable plan? What else would you guys do? I'm trying to approach this as trading, not gambling (have had enough of that thank you). Appreciated.
it looks like 6300$ support has become resistance, this is a good place for a short with stops at 6350-6400.
1. Pump without a follow up? Check.

2. RSI cooled down? Check.

3. Fake out before dump? Check

4. Friday the 13th....? Check lol jk

Doesnt look good for the bulls.
Please excuse my Meta post but I need to say that damn this daily is full of enlightening TA. Its nice to give the report button (and the mods) a break. Awesome!
The pump was not spectacular but neither was the following dump. I'm staying long. I see 6.8k again before we go any lower than 6.1k. If it drops below 6135 Ill be worried. Until then setting my exit and closing the charts until I get my way. Spent some BTC last night on a mixed reality headset I couldn't resist and plan to make it back on the next move. 
I have a feeling this is going to bart right back down when I wake up. One huge pump up, side ways action, then a red dildo back down. Classic.
Oepsie... Friday the 13th ....

Good for Crypto!!??

Have fun Guys and Girls. Longs or Shorts!!
From my last shitpost:

>iH&S or whatever doesn't matter, to me, the short term right now is too random to bother trading with. In the medium term I keep it simple, if it tests 5.8-6K support again no way in hell it's holding for the fourth time. That's a sign of weakness and uncertainty. If it does hold that's some fucked up shit, but this is bitcoin. Considering we're in a downtrend, the forces are leaning heavily that way, and we're too close to that critical support for me to be confident. Of course something random like bitcoin ETF can change all of this in a heartbeat. To be frank the ETF approval could be the single most bullish thing to happen to bitcoin price mainly because of the fomo it will create, and the sheer size of the crypto crowd that are ready to pull the trigger. But right now I'm not convinced the price won't go lower. For the long term though, I'm obviously bullish. Some people call me a permabull, but I'm only bull cuz there's good reason to be bullish. The burden is on you to explain why I shouldn't be long term bullish.


Pleasantly surprised that $6100 held. It seems to be struggling to go below $6K, at which point I’d short but until then I’m not comfortable. Right now it seems like the “majority” are expecting a $3-5K bottom so that’s another good contrarian indicator. Maybe it’s having a tough time breaking below 6K because word on the street is that this ETF is likely to pass, for several reasons. This isn’t like some bullshit “consensus pump” expectation which was just laughable. An ETF is the single most bullish event I can think of since I’ve been keeping up with Bitcoin. On top of that the internal scaling dispute has been resolved and we’ve seen great progress on developments people used to call vaporware. I mean if you’re not holding some BTC as a long term savings account, I dunnno WTF you’re thinking. 

On a random note, I went to the screening of this movie called Unfriended: Dark Web.... it was a stupid movie, but entertaining because I kinda like these types of movies. Bitcoin made a huge cameo in the movie, one of the hackers had 15K BTC in a wallet and he got in trouble for moving them to another wallet. He had to make something up on the spot for moving them and he said “I’m just switching Bitcoin to Ethereum”... the Dark Web cartels were like “why the fuck would you do that?” .... in my mind I’m like, that’s right... why would anyone switch from BTC to ETH! 🤷🏻‍♀️ 

Anyway, in 2013 any mention of the word Bitcoin in an article would get everyone circle jerking eachother ... now it’s a common occurrence and everyone knows the name Bitcoin. The virus is spreading fast and it’s not gonna stop. 


On a final note, is anyone going to the Bitcoin dinner in Dallas tonight? It’s all Bitcoiners, not fucking “blockchainers”... if so see you there!

Large movement of old BTC just now according to coindays destroyed.
https://fork.lol/blocks/cdd

Last time this happened was the 8th before the drop.
A move above $6400 and stabilization for a week would be start of reversal in my book.

There is always the chance of some massive BGD appearing out of nowhere as well. Maybe having some stop buys between 6400 - 9400 is not that bad of an idea.
Is this a bear flag forming? Looks like its on its third dip and volume for each drop in that flag is getting weaker and weaker. Is this correct? Looking at the 6 hour. 

Trying to learn to read the charts. Forgive me for my ignorance.
This really is starting to feel like a gambling ring where you bet if a whale decides to put a big green dildo or red green dildo after a few hours. It feels binary; either one big movement or no movement at all.
This little Batman ear forming after Bart hair and a small buy wall propping up a small rise with low volume.  Dammit, seen this before, time after time.

Still not closing a long though, I'm too greedy.  "this time...."

Edit: btw, I'm not necessarily implying that these little buy walls are there for manipulation or artificially propping it up, it could just as well be a short closing or someone (re)entering the market here.
why does everybody dismiss the two 40%+ corrections before 5k.  The only thing that hasn't been tested is 4900.  Sure maybe we go down there but there are so many sharks looking to buy i just don't think it happens. And As far as i know there were not any significant corrections going up to previous ATH's in Bitcoin's history such as the run to 1200 and the prior one.  I could be wrong though as I don't have the TA on that
!long xbtu close $6270

Closing my long from $6205.

Yesterday, I made a post that if we broke $6200 then I'd open a long with a target of $6300 but after it got rejected at $6285 I set my target for $6280.

Got lucky and it hit while I was asleep. Super small profit but I'll take it and reassess the situation after I get home from work tonight. 

15 min chart is slowing slight bear divergence (nothing major).

The candles on the 4hr are right under the 10 EMA with no real follow through with the 30 EMA around $6425 so if it DOES push through then that area would be where it would test imo. 

On the Daily the 10 EMA is right around that $6425 zone (closer to $6420).

If we get a move to the upside then I'll open a short around that but until then I'll sideline it. 
On the 4h chart, Bull trap last candle and now bear trap. What the actual fuck. Does TA even work anymore 🤦‍♂️💩

It pierced through $6300 for bull trap

It was a Red 2 for the bear trap 😡
I think nothing significant will happen until at least August. 

Reason being, ESMA bringing in their leverage restrictions.

A max of 2:1 leverage on trading cryptos across the whole of the EU, pricing out a LOT of retail traders (this is just by reading the complaints against this decision)

Binary options being banned is fine, negative balance protection is also a plus but the leverage could be slightly higher 😡😡😡.

This will keep the small fish in the pond while the whales swim in the fucking ocean. 
We've got a [small bull flag forming on the hourly](https://www.tradingview.com/x/btVTAXmI/)... I do think this one will break to the upside but struggle to move passed $6400 which might be a good place to close a long for those who got in under $6100.

Right now we seem to be range bound between strong support at $5800 and heavy resistance at $6800.  Personally I'd like to see a strong impulse above $6450 which would suggest another attempt at $6800-$6900.  
That was terrible actually. Prepare for a dump.
I know buy/sell walls shouldn’t be paid attention to, but 30 million on Bitmex at 6239 seems a bit excessive no?

Is this someone trying to draw a line in the sand? Or ensure enough liquidity to sell into? I’m not au fait with these buy/sell wall tactics interested to listen to other perspectives.

Edit: Wall reduced to 10 million.

Double edit: wall gone, question answered.
As an aside from the daily non-movement...does anybody else have a day when crypto made them feel drunk?  Like, not a good drunk, but like a “What am I doing” drunk?  

I just remembered February and now I feel like I’ve become desensitizied to things that normal people would lose their minds over.
Lately I often read comparisons between the 2014 bear market and 2018 bear market.

I advice everybody to look carefully into the details, because as someone who has seen 4 bubbles in BTC come and go, I can not find any resemblance besides "it's looking similar"!

In other words: Bubbles do pop and when they do, they create similar patterns.

As always: The devil is in the detail. I'm of the opinion, that if you entered BTC post 2014 and base your hypothesis solely on chart comparison you're doing it wrong. I'd call this a "chart historian's fallacy". In no way is this a call to stop charting or comparing. It's a call to DYOR and learn about certain circumstances back then!

Now does this mean sub $1k is not possible!? Obviously not. It just means 2018 behaves differently, just as 2011 and 2013 (spring) did, even if all of them looked similar!
So, I didn't fully stick to the plan, but it's worked out ok and Ive recouped some unrealised losses.

I have been all-in 3.2x long since 6.5k, didnt take any profits on the brief visit to 6.7/6.8k, and have been underwater since. I was planning on hodling my posision down to the mid 5k range where I was going to deposit more fiat to add to my position, but things have been looking much more bearish since 6.8k and I've been second-guessing my plan. In hindsight, I think it was actually a pretty awful plan to begin with.

I don't know if this is good practice or not, but last night I increased my leverage to 7x to free up some margin to reduce my average entry. I increased my position by about 60% at 6,137 and placed stops for 50% of the new total position a bit below 6k. So far, this has worked out nicely.

I'm now considering closing the whole thing. I reached a point where I was uncomfortable with my entire plan, I am now in a better position than I was at that point, I think I need some time to clear my head and reevaluaate.
My guess is we drop soon and retest that green candle yesterday. If we form a higher low with a strong bounce, I will happily go long because that will likely mean $6.8k was not the high of our relief rally. 
Wow broke the 12 hour barrier with no follow up pump? Gonna be a dump weekend 
I know its offtopic but its somehow important:

Looking for a strong bounce at $6130. If so, will go long. If no bounce, then my buys are at $5450 because that is 20 percent correction from $6800. 
So what percentage of people here actually make money overall from trading (not just getting lucky and holding coins through 2017) I wonder...
Got rejected 4 times in a row. Don't see this breaching resistance.
Highest price of June was hit on the 3rd and 7th. 
Highest price of July so far was hit on the 3rd and 7th. 

Is the "6th of the month is the highest/lowest point" still basically valid? 
I wanna try out this trading bot. Thank's /u/justanotherlogin ! Super cool you set this up for us. One suggestion would be to calculate PnL in a way that factors in the leverage used and the percentage of trading stack used in order to come up with a resulting PnL relative to the entire trading stack. I believe that currently, it just does PnL as simply the difference between open price and close price. My other suggestion would be to show a historical total PnL for each trader relative to their trading stack.

I'm hoping to demonstrate a different approach to trading that I've taken over the last couple years and one that certainly doesn't seem common from looking at the current positions the bot has open. Everyone here seems to be either in a position or out of it. Full short or full long. Fully closing a position or fully letting it ride. This approach doesn't work for me. I'm not good at taking losses, so I try to avoid ever doing that.

First off, I won't be exceeding 1:1 leverage, meaning I won't ever be in a position larger than my trading stack. In order for me to even reach that much leverage, I will have had to enter many many trades over a long period. Second, I'll be adding and subtracting from the position very gradually over longer periods of time. My goal with these two rules has always been to keep my emotions out of my trades, and this is what works for me. By not using much leverage, I don't freak out over price moves in either direction. No FOMO or FOLO. By entering and exiting positions gradually, I limit how much my current state of mind and market outlook can impact my trading on any given day. I hope the bot works for this, but we will see. 

To be clear, I of course never have anywhere near 100% of my stack on an exchange. I keep enough margin on the exchange to keep my position well out of range of liquidation, and that's all. I'll add or remove as necessary. To keep it simple for the bot and for me, I'm just gonna claim every trade is at 1X margin and less than 100% of my stack.

I'm going to slowly start accumulating around these levels because the price is 70% below the ATH and volatility is low. This trade will reflect one of many smaller longs I plan to open over the next couple months. 

!long XBTZ18 6214.5 1x 5%

Now, if I want to add to this position next week, how should I do it? long XBTZ18 add [price] 1x 5% should double my effective position size to be 10% of my total trading stack, correct? 

Can someone give me some idea as to when the inverse H&S pattern will be decisively invalidated? What are we looking for?
This is just dumb....
I'm expecting a bull trap to low 7k like so (based on 2014 structure):

https://www.tradingview.com/x/hoBlT1JK/

(I spent a lot of time calibrating and beautifying that chart..)

But I don't know if it's gonna be now or after another major drop to 5k. I think the latter is more likely since we already had a fakeout to 6.8k


Bullish traders and hodlers say "Who will sell at these levels?"

I say all it takes to dredge up sellers is to drive the price downwards. Looks to me the market is easy to sell with pace.
So apparently crypto currency was used in the Russian hacking of the ~~2016 elections~~ DNCC. It's is being discussed live on TV right now by the DOJ. They mention crypto currency twice so far.
I have a stupid question. I want to bet that Litecoin will go down in price compared to Bitcoin. But i also think Bitcoin might go down on it's own. If I short LTC/BTC on bitmex, that means I lose money also if BTC goes down? So I was thinking to simply go short LTC and long BTC, but I don't see a way to short LTC/USD with leverage , at least not on Bitmex. Any solutions?
This recent drop from 6.3 to 6.1 was met with relatively strong buying power compared to the drop itself. We can see this by the hidden bull div on OBV: https://www.tradingview.com/x/Up1SN5zi/

Staying long from 6130. Not sure about stops here, but keeping it pretty tight for now just under 6050.
Cyrpto this year has had so many ´pumps´ New year, Winter olympics, Wall Street bonuses, Chinese New Year, US Tax Day, CFTC meeting with US Congress, Consensus 2018. Now the bull run will start after ETF news… right. 📷

Can anyone help me set up an alert for RSI levels on tradingsview? I tried watching videos on it but the code is too complicated for me and I don't think it's possible to do it easily using the 'alert' button. Like I can't enter an RSI value there. How would I do it if I wanted e.g. an alert for 4hour RSI <30?

Thanks for any help
is there no beautiful depth chart on tradingview like there is with coinigy?

Maecenas' online platform allows you buy and sale pieces of art on auction based on blockchain. It's aslo a good opportunity to invest.
Common sense says we go down more, right now, but the 4 hour would look so nice if we actually do reverse here.
Yea we are fucked tonight. I had a slight glimmer of hope for the bulls but no way in hell we go up past $6.3k after this rejection. 
Every time everyone is looking down and expects a drop we always get a pump and I don’t think things will be different lol so have your stops ready. Anything is possible for shorters and longers
Going to be watching this weak bounce like a hawk for that perfect spot to short. Someone said it earlier that trading ain't even fun anymore at this point since you gotta try to catch and trade the Barts. He's right. This is extremely boring and depressing at this point. I honestly might do one last short and go cold storage for a year or so until things start happening again.
What does BDG mean?
Hi guys, I'm after some advice.

**Where/What trades would you do to get the maximum profit if you knew for sure that the market would pump slightly in five minutes?**

To be clear this is not a huge spike and it would go down soon after. This is purely theoretical and not about minimising risk. Treat it as a sure thing that you want to capitalise on. 

I tried messing around on BitMEX last night, but I'm a potato at figuring out if 100x leverage would even be the best way. **Is there a binary win all/lose all option on some crypto market I don't know about?**

 A while ago I had fun with binary trading (not with real money which was good, I would have lost quite a bit) on some iphone app; it was fun to do as the markets opened and news stories came out. It allowed you just to select the time you thought the market would be up or down. I understand this is more akin to gambling, nevertheless I would like to try something similar but with minuscule amounts of crypto. 

Thanks in advance, and my apologies if I'm asking in the wrong place. 
So was there a big ass btc market sell again? 
I don't have to go to work until 3 so I got lucky as I got an alert.

As I mentioned earlier, the 10 EMA on the 4hr was gliding along and it was rejected for a 3rd time with a strong reversal at $6350.

!short xbtu $6210 x5 80&#37;

Setting a stop @$6310
I’ve been hoping for inverted head and shoulders for a week and it’s still in play, that may change but this is a critical point for the bulls and a reversal still seems in play, so I’m happy
Yesterday I wrote:

> Expecting to break $6k within 24 hours.
> RSI on the 1D has room to go down to at least ~30 (that'll be sub $6k).

We went down to $6080 and reversed. I don't think we go down sub $6k within the proclaimed 24h move, anymore.

Sub $6k is still a play in my cards within the next days. Up to $6.4k then down to $5.9k.

Edit: Edit for more clarity.
The question is: can BTC continue to dump on a day when Zcash is up 20% and 0x up 25% and ADA up 15% etc etc. My thought is that with so much money sloshing around and those coins having clearly broken out eventually the rest of the market will have to follow. If I just got 20% on the Zcash pump I'd be putting into BTC right about now.

Why is the Coinbase announcement big? Like who cares it’s just a bunch of alts how does it help bitcoin? No reason for any pumps. So why fomo
So here's the haps.

Word on the street is that Short Bus is both running out of coins AND freaking out because he has a large number of coins to cover. This puts him in a bind because if he buys 50000 coins by the deadline, he will cause the price to explode upward. If he fails to cover, he will be exposed and embarrassed. Happy Friday the 13th, Short Bus.

Oh, and there's still a ton of money that was hoping to buy cheaper. 

So, yeah, don't short. 
/u/\_chewtoy\_ I'll preface this by saying I realize that this is probably one of those questions that have been asked and answered a few times, and belongs in a FAQ, so I hope you don't mind if I ask it again.

Do you sit in positions with 100&#37; of your trading stack like your position history page suggests or is that something you just stick there for convenience?

Also, I'm still a bit curious about why you prefer the closest quarterly over perps. I know the funding is a turn off but it seems like it's something that's just priced in and should be ignored. Why give up the more liquid order book simply to avoid it?

My animalistic instincts are kicking in! Hold me back bot, hold me back!
Alts have gone green in the last 4h. Imho traders are expecting a strong alt bounce (+30&#37; at least) by the time bitcoin and eth consolidate around their lows. The more we drop the more top alts hold their btc ratio. I guess you won't sell the coin that lost 80&#37; of its value
Short más, gana más
Caught the wick at $6130 hoping for a bounce but this is not strong enough. I’ll happily sell here and wait for prime entry at $5500.

alts just started pumping on the ratio...I think BTC is about to start getting dragged up too
Wait, was that supposed to be a dump or something? Didn't even retrace half the last BGD. Big Shorty's really losin' his mojo. Tempted to add more to my long here.

Quality post. 

In regards to the Inverse H&S I'll second the sentiment that folks are getting a little ahead of themselves and the pattern isn't confirmed until the market breaks the neckline at around $6,900. That said, this is an instances where the reward for entering near the bottom of the right shoulder outweighs the risk of the pattern failing to complete to the upside. 

The target for an upside break of the pattern would be somewhere right around $8,000, whereas the pattern becomes invalid with a break below around $6,050. 

There's not much ambiguity if things go south. You'll be able to exit with significant confidence and switch to a short position to recoup your losses.
My biggest issue with OBV is that dojis can screw with it quite a bit, as all the volume is attributed to buying or selling when it was really even buying/selling.

I much prefer accum/dist. It's similar to OBV, but multiplies the volume by a fraction from -1 to 1. -1 means the price closed AT the low for the candle; 1 means it closed at the high. As such, a hammer candle that just barely closes red would actually add to the line, while a doji closing near the middle of the high-low barely registers.

Brilliant analysis, and also i'm in love with your charts and i'm not even high.
Love your posts.

I amuse myself by reading them like it's an extremely snarky weather report. 
Nice post! Cheers!
Good stuff, thank you!
Not really great, still cannot break $6350, perfect time to add to a short. 
Nice call. What price did you exit at?
Nice one. Seems like a good scalping strategy here is wait for a failed pump, switch to short, wait for a failed dump, switch to long.
Maybe in December but it was rare to see 100% 24 hour increases in other times of the year.
who would actually buy because of that?  Smart money was in (and probably out) of those coins long ago.  Retail traders either quit in frustration and aren't coming back, or went all in late last year and are bagholding until they can break even.  I wouldn't trust an altcoin pump to be able to sustain any momentum, would you?
There's also nowhere near the same amount of money in crypto as there was last year. If anything this is perfect for us who are long term. 

Currently out of all alt-positions until the ETF news but you best believe I'll load up on ADA and XLM bags.
Yeah, the selling is really aggressive in these resistance levels.
Bitcoin in this bear market is like a nervous teenager that gets rejected once at a school dance and hides in the basement for weeks.

old news.
> I don't even have fun anymore

it's okay to take a break sometimes (market is 'probably' not going anywhere anyway). There is a time and place to make a lot of money, or at least enjoy trading. I doubt this is time. Unless you are an extremely profitable trader (or trade on higher multi-week/month timeframes) the potential money to gain in the current shitty volume/volatility/liquidity environment is probably worth much less than the value/time you can spend with family or friends during this summer vacation. 

Probably it depends on your strategy (I am a scalper, arbitrage trader), but I decided it doesn't make sense anymore to stare 8-14 hours per day to a sideways $30-50 range hoping to not get screwed by some random Bart. Current market conditions make me a bit depressed: as if only bots, 5 guys on reddit, three dead horses, and two whales to fuck everybody over, are left in the game.

For the sake of nostalgia. Remember the time when there was like 500-1000 USD differences between exchanges. I basically woke up each day, saw my wire transfer arrive, and locked in free money without even getting out of bed. Now I have to work my ass off trading/scalping, being stressed all day, and deal with shitty market conditions, for much less moneyz (average of +/- $50-100 scalping profits per day per bitcoin). Maybe better times will come in the future, maybe they wont. But there is no reason to be involved 365 days per year, sometimes the market conditions are just bad and it is ok to take some extra free time off.
Thats what Im seeing as well. Im in long on this one. If we stay above 6135 it's a good sign to me that we are going to head back up to 6800 again before going any further down. Going to close all crypto related stuff until later tonight to see what happened. 
> there is a rounded bottom pattern forming on the hourly

Nice find, actually! Hadn't seen it mentioned elsewhere yet. Definitely something to keep an eye on....
Also the whole prime thing, with a separate api that's actually the same api. 
C wave up to 6400 coming up. Sell around there and wait for sub 6k levels.
When there is no "big" action, the chart meanders like a crazy monkey. Then a whale will burn through stops, either up or down, direction perhaps depending on slippage. There's no way to time it, and certainly no way to predict it. You either need luck, and accurate crystal ball, or be one of the whales. 
The sharp direction changes that you're describing may appear random, but they've mostly been preceded by clear technical indicators. 

RSI divergences, MACD crosses, MA crosses etc. The signs are there if you know where to look. 
It's more held together[ like this instead](http://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/33113/image.jpg) of sticky tape and glue.  The only difference being the people on the bottom of that pyramid look thrilled to be there, whereas our bag holders are getting saltier by the day.
exactly.  I said this a few weeks ago to mixed response, and nothing has changed.
Well, try good ol' hodl then?
Set Catpizzas32 to friend. Read daily thread for his TA. Profit. Seriously not kidding, I read everyone's TA's here as well but this guy has been so dead on recently. 
I just took one... feels good man.
Guess we can add “delusional” to the flair list too.
The SEC has an uptick rule though that I think would benefit crypto markets. If you aren’t familiar with it it basically the gist is if a security drops by more than 10% of its value in a day long sellers have priority to selling stock over short sellers. It’s often referred to as the short sale circuit breaker.  This reduces the feeding frenzy of those piling on after a plunge and many will sell before it hits a 10% reduction for fear of missing the window essentially limiting daily losses to no more than 10% of value and usually less. 
This is why tZero and digital locate receipts and tokenized securities will be such a big deal.
If manipulation is rampant on regulated markets, why do you think it would help in crypto markets?
Upvoted
So why does everyone ignore the previous bubbles that happened before 2014, they fell less and were shorter
So you are sitting on Fiat and want to buy low 4's or even 3's. ( that's another 40 -50&#37; down as off today ), Hmmm Interesting.
You're playing it pretty conservative. If your goal is to turn around that money safely you should probably find a different place to put it.

At some point you're going to have to take a risk or stay out completely. This sounds like money you don't have to lose, though.
Could be interesting to use this site as a buy signal.  Though if you buy on a fear signal reaching the low area of 15, there appear to still be 5%~10% price drops.  The sell signals look premature too.

So I guess it could potentially be a good indicator to know to know which side to join to start looking for either a long or short, or if it is too late, or if you are in no-man's land (like now).  But probably not good for more specific entry time, should be combined with other indicators for that then.
Rather Interesting.
It would be interesting to see this overlayed with the BTC graph, know anywhere that does that?
No, it doesn't.

What CB announced now?

Edit: I see now, they basically announced nothing
I've read recently that for divergence to be valid the number of bars between the lows/highs should be no greater than the length of the oscillator, so, from that perspective, that OBV divergence looks more legit than the other two.
Yes... that’s not surprising....
Yes, you need Bitcoin to use BitMEX. All contracts are bought and paid for in Bitcoin only.
inb4 people start arguing about the block sizes.
Good shit. I hope you keep posting analysis like this. I think we are going to work our way down to 5 and the longer it takes to get down there the better chance there is for a bounce. I shorted 3 as it looks like a level that flipped support/resistance many times (going back to june 13th).
Completely unfamiliar with PnF, but just hate seeing a good question have no discussion.

Are you looking to make the observation that we've had a triple top breakdown recently (\~6800) and are looking at a bearish catapult down? 

Could also make the argument that we're about to make a spread triple top breakout for a bullish catapult?

Any recommendations on how to get into PnF? 
I see exactly the opposite. Each fake dump is more impotent than the last, an obvious attempt to drop the price, not to make money. Meanwhile, big bulls have to be careful not to pump it too much and pay more than they have to, thus buy in quick bursts and wait for the next round of bargains. 

Big Shorty is just digging a deeper grave for himself with each dump. Almost feel sorry for the guy. He's going to lose billions when it's time to pay back Mr. Kobayashi and others who lent him the coins.
Somebody mentioned this app Drakdoo a few days ago and it's pretty neat.
Bitcoin Paranoid (on Android) seems to work well enough for me. 
It is just blockfolio.   I never had reliable alerts with it.  
I got the alert on Delta pretty fast then I logged and saw the Coinbase “announcement”
Don't your order right at 6800 sharp. As a rule I usually place my order 0.3-0.5% above/below the psychological support/resistance lines just to reduce the chances of catching a fake-out. In this case it would be around 6830.

The area around 5500 and 5850 aren't bad placed to buy. Just make sure you have a plan and draw a line in the sand of where you bail/sell again should it drop further. Good traders are made by properly managing their bad trades.
I wouldn't say it's a good strategy and you seem to be getting some questionable advice. What you're planning to do is basically buying a local high or trying to catch a falling knife.   
   
The key concept you need to grasp in order to trade successfully, as opposed to gamble, is risk/reward ratio. For example right now we're trading in 5800 - 6800 range. Why do you think buying at 6800 is a good idea? If you want to place an order at 6800, go short, with a stop loss just above, in case it gets broken. If you want to place an order now, the r/r ratio favours going long, with a stop order below the recent low.   
   
Now assuming there is some iH&S in development (there isn't, but just for the sake of an argument), it won't be confirmed until the price breaks *past* the neckline level. Putting an order on the neckline is a gamble. You want to either see the price break an maintain an upward  trend, or break and retrace, to confirm the neckline as support. In any case, if there was an iH&S in play the target for it would be somewhere around $7800, so entering at 6900 or even 7000 is much better in terms of r/r (slightly less reward, much lower risk) than trying to enter at 6800.   
   
Now, regarding putting a buy order at 5500, it's just an arbitrary number. It's equally likely that the price will bounce of 5501 and your order never gets filled as it is that it will just pass through 5500 and continue down to 3000. If the price makes a lower low it would confirm that we're still in a downtrend and buying the dip in a downtrend doesn't work. It may be a great price if you believe in long-term success of Bitcoin and want to HODL until the new ATH, but that's not the same as trading.
That sounds reasonable. If we believe that BTC will either go down a bit more and correct or correct from here, that's a fine approach.

When BTC does correct, it will likely correct up harder than Eth and LTC.  So I'd recommend buying your BTC now, then just sitting on it, maybe for months until those coins are really in the toilet relative to BTC.  Then buy up some Eth or LTC when they show signs of correcting and catching back up to BTC.  Ride one or both back up to a higher ratio and buy back into BTC.  Its slow and takes awhile but it's a pretty reasonable way to trade IMO vs. jumping in and out of fiat like a lunatic.
I think not But anyway Good Luck
And like always market will do opposite. Fake out will follow with fake out. Longs closed but sentiment will be up for now.
Im not sure 6.8 will hold another test. Certainly wouldnt count on it. That being Said I think we see New lows before retesting it. Not holding 6.3 is very bearish to me.
I don’t have feelings anymore
Seems like a normal bear flag to me.. I could be wrong though ..I really thought we would break 6k whilst I was sleeping 
I was hoping to go! Too late now, I think.... Are you a Dallas native?
> ..word on the street is that this ETF is likely to pass, for several reasons

Just to be clear: the whole "*CBOE ETF at Aug 10!*" is like a joke. The real date is Aug 16 (45 days) or very likely actually [September 30](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/07/02/2018-14114/self-regulatory-organizations-cboe-bzx-exchange-inc-notice-of-filing-of-proposed-rule-change-to-list) (90 days.) However (!) then SEC can just delay it again, all the way till **27 Feb 2019** - just like they did all previous times with all previous bitcoin ETF proposals. I find it very very unlikely to see a final decision before 2019 (with the exception of withdrawal.)

Of course it doesn't necessarily matter if it's the truth or not, as long as enough people believe it and act on it. But it is pretty crazy how this wrong date has been spreading :p

Ps, there is actually a real final deadline at [Aug 23](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/06/21/2018-13301/self-regulatory-organizations-nyse-arca-inc-notice-of-designation-of-a-longer-period-for-commission) for one of the "bitcoin futures ETF" (ProShares) - so that is interesting - but still pretty unlikely to be approved.
checking latest blocks looks like it's because this block:

and inside that block it's mainly because this transaction: https://www.blockchain.com/en/btc/tx/aca9ad442439817497ce5f6832d6e1b627c97eb3e801323eef832df91f8f25be

edit: looks like it sends the btc to 3QbN8U4dfCxwtXAcgWTkqwGtP1PcaZ2sgv that belongs to xapo.com so I guess that it's just a cold storage movement to xapo.com hotwallet.
The biggest mistake I often read is that people think it's a good sign if the price lingers at a certain after going UP. The longer you hang at a certain level without going down after going up, the higher the chance becomes it's going down. That's why 7800 and 6800 were such obvious shorts. The opposite is also true. If the price would drop from here and stay hanging for a couple of days near 6000 the chances are very high that it's going to go back up again. 


Once you start understanding this process of cycling up and down and incorporate it in your trading, trading becomes a lot less hard because you can find spots with good R/R where the chances are pretty high (and I mean really high) that the trend reverses. 




Never apologize for asking questions when you are learning.

Doesn't look much like a flag at the moment.

It's insane how this Batman pattern keeps repeating itself time and again. I don't get it. How can something like this be so predictable?
You are right that lately more often sudden spike after pump and consolidation period results in sudden drop. But not always, sometimes it ends with another leg up.
Yep . You are right
Who dismisses them? Those consolidations are the lower support levels if 5800 doesn't hold.
You really trade with 100% of stack on this lev or it's just some small gambling stack?

In these low volatility time just ignore everything under 1 day. Downtrend on monthly, downtrend on weekly, downtrend on daily. It's going down, noise is irrelevant. Yes this is coming from a rekt ass mofo but big losses clear your head and allow you to see the big picture.
do you guys not remember like 3 months ago when 2-3% price volatility was normal within an hour? 

everyone so used to no volatility that they think the price not moving in a straight line up and down means it's impossible to make money lol
Fomoing stopped working a while ago. Wait for candle closes and buy/sell obvious levels.
Thats just for CFDs and not spot or futures(at least on mex) as far as I understand it. Can anyone clarify this? CFD's is what I see advertised as spread betting all the time. This is investopedia on CFDs for anyone interested https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/09/trade-a-cfd.asp . It's high risk (leverage) and low barrier to entry so I can imagine adding more speculation to bitcoin without having to hold spot at all is probably a good thing. It also seem like you cannot short sell CFDs

>The Bottom Line

>Advantages to CFD trading include lower margin requirements, easy access to global markets, no shorting or day trading rules and little or no fees. However, high leverage magnifies losses when they occur, and having to pay a spread to enter and exit positions can be costly when large price movements do not occur. 
Very similar to the break up out of Bull flag @ 6800, this is just less violent 
Womp womp. Same thing happened at $6800. Big wick up, big wick down and a slow bleed into an eventual dump. Don't think there's many buyers out there willing to give into fomo like they used to. Whales are having a pretty hard time baiting the market into pumps.
Playing exactly as expected lol
It's been flashing since yesterday but was way lower.
When the BDG happened from \~6.7k to \~8k (not exactly sure what it was haha) I was in a short without stops. I exited at 7.4k which was still fairly good profit for me as I opened at 8.2k, but was convinced it would ride down further. Considering I held through the "barts" (them also being the reason I had no stops in place), I just thought it was an unusually large bart, at first. That entire BDG had me losing my head.
> now I feel like I’ve become desensitizied to things that normal people would lose their minds over.

Finance will do that to you, particularly arbitrage. 
why does it matter why if they look the same on the charts...? o_O 
I think it is very risky to be long right now. I was short 10x since 6356 and closed my position at 6159. I opened a 7x long at 6156 and closed it now. I feel very uncomfortable to hold a long right now after such a strong rejection at 6.8k. The bounce from 6100 was very weak as well.

If you are bullish though but uncomfortable with 7x leverage just reduce it. Take profit. Slow and steady wins the race. I would personally close it completely and wait for a better entry (short 6.7k-7.2k or long 5k-6k).
What is your avg entry now?
>  I reached a point where I was uncomfortable with my entire plan

It's not all or nothing. If you are uncomfortable, reduce the position size until you are. You don't have to completely close it. When you are comfortable again, you'll know your position is properly sized. You don't have to avoid taking a loss, you just have to avoid losing your entire trading stack. 
I've noticed the last few weeks on Friday's (this may just be my memory bias) but seems like there is always a medium speed decline after 4pm central time on Friday's. Just people exiting the market before they leave work on a Friday to buy back in later? Anyone want to chime in and bolster/refute this?

I think /u/sloppysynapses did a pool on this? There's quite a few traders that are in good profits
After 3 years of sort of trading, I finally last year started to make consistent returns almost each month. The key is to always admit defeat, study real books and never give up.  

And recognize all markets will ALWAYS ALWAYS give you a new chance. Better to stay out if entry is not good enough
A lot of people are active in this group and looking at charts for 10 hours plus a day so I imagine a high percentage are making money. 
3,74% daily returns on average since March, 4,93% in June on my Bitmex account. Almost disgusting, and I doubt I can keep it up for long but I did make some good money lol.

> getting lucky and holding coins through 2017

there is a *little* more than just luck involved here, mate
Very few traders make money in Bitcoin or stocks. I am one that does. My strategy is very simple: low leverage long after a big red candle or two, double down if it doesn't go my way at first. Only use stops to lock in gains. Never been liquidated. Won six of my last seven trades, most of which were underwater at some point like my current position.

One more thing: I only trade with a tiny portion of my stack and take my profits in BTC.
Do I count if I am able to consistently trade alts to increase my BTC stack (averaging 0.3-0.5 % per day for months now), but am still at a modest overall USD value loss because of my reluctance to short?
The only people who got rich on crypto are ICO scammers who ran off w the money or those that picked a project early on, put down big money to acquire many shares (coins/tokens), and then sat on it waiting for everyone else to catch up.
I have a stupid question but should the PnL as listed by the bot be multiplied by the leverage?  2.89% PnL with 10x leverage is a 28.9% gain?
When 6k breaks
It was pretty much invalidated (in my mind, at least) when it dipped below 6100 a couple days ago. The right shoulder on H&S usually breaks before reaching the same price level as the left shoulder. The fact that this questionable IH&S dropped beyond the price of the left shoulder pretty much confirmed to me that it wasn't anything. 

That said, anything's possible with Bitcorn.
It's an incomplete pattern already. But people will stop memeing about it if we make new lows.

ETA: BTW, my counter meme normal h&s is playing out and is just as valid as the inverse people keep shilling: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8w7k00/daily_discussion_thursday_july_05_2018/e1tgv3s/

I'd be more surprised if you told me crypto currency was used in a non-criminal like manner in 2016.
I'd probably edit "hacking of the 2016 elections" to "hacking of the DNCC".

Other than that, not sure why this is getting downvoted.  Pretty interesting that crypto was being used this way in such a high profile news story.
Link?
Thanks, this is interesting. I saw "cryptocurrencies" referenced, but no mention of BTC. Have you heard/seen anything about BTC specifically?

EDIT: BTC is specifically mentioned here: 

"they principally used bitcoin when purchasing servers, registering domains, and otherwise making payments in furtherance of hacking activity."

https://www.coindesk.com/russian-dnc-hackers-used-cryptocurrency-to-fund-their-operations/
All of the usual suspects in media will jump all over this. Could lead to a big flush soon.

Edit: Here's a good Twitter feed following the topic: https://twitter.com/sahilkapur/status/1017805155847335936
The election wasn't "hacked." And im sure they used USD and RUB to disrupt too, don't see the big deal.

If you want to simply short the ltc ratio but not expose yourself to BTC movements, short the ltc ratio and hedge the rest of your stack.

So if you have 1 BTC on bitmex, short however much on LTC/BTC and then short 1 BTC on XBTUSD. 

You're not exposed to XBTUSD movements (except for potential profits on LTC/BTC) but you reap rewards from LTC/BTC moving down. 
Until I see the price hold above the 4H 12/26 EMA, I'm going to remain in fiat. This has just been way too unpredictable for me to feel comfortable in a position.
Feel like that drop from a few weeks ago where it dumps from 6250 to low 6ks and pump back up to 6250 due Tether news. But due to the lack of buy interest, it goes side way and then shet itself a few days later to 5750. The thing is if it drops back there again, then I doubt 5750 is going to hold. Maybe I shouldn't post this, but hey until this thing breaks above major resistance, nothing is certain.
This is wrong. ETF has a clear relationship to increased ability to buy from big institutions, something they can't currently do due to custody issues. Everything you listed doesn't have this property. Increased ability to buy (with actual btc assets backing the ETF) has a singular directional force on the price (up). Big players can already short via futures. Now it doesn't guarantee that institutions will actually be interested in BTC, but you have to think that at least some will given the attractive price (somewhere between 70-80% down from ATH depending on where we bottom). This can only have a positive impact. Knowing this, its rational to buy BTC if an ETF is approved (but before its live) in anticipation of the increased demand from traditional players. These forces are self reinforcing as well, as prices going up signal to retail that the bear market is over, which increases demand. Trend is still your friend but this is a positive in a fundamental sense. How you can compare this to "winter olympics" i dont even understand.

This usually happens before a dump, can’t tell whether this is a causal relation or not though.
Man, that's a good short entry. You should have wait a bit longer as the market picks up more volume. In my case, I would happily take profit if it breaks 6400, but until then ride the wave.

Good job you closed your short at the worst time in my opinion lol. 
There is literally zero bull div on the 12 hr + time frames. The last local low on those time frames (before this one) is at  5.8k with RSI at 32. Price just made a local low (if it holds) of 6.2k and RSI at 36.

Both price and RSI made a higher low => no bull div.

There was a bull div with the 5.8k local low and the one before it, but you missed the train with that one by now. That bull div was one of the reasons many went long in that range.
Both 2011 and 2013 bubbles end at the level before the level of mean. So, they nearly retest the beginning of the original bull run. For us, that would mean our low would be in the $3.8k leg. 
Chart? I don't see it in RSI.

why?

never trust a slowly climb up with these volume. good short entry for scalping though
ya everyone who has expected the price to go down has been really wrong so far this year 
LOL, patient. Reality will kicks in for the permabulls when this drops to low 5ks. Every pump is followed by a dead volume. The lack of buy interest is worrisome. By the end of this market cycle, bears are going to have a few lambos stack in their garage.

Binary options are illegal in many jurisdictions.   If the payout is less than 1:1, they are negative EV.
Bitmex perpetuals probably. It has the best liquidity and allows shorting. Only issue is the overload, but for most trades you can work around that with stop or limit orders placed in advance.
https://whaleclub.co/ for binary options (or as they call it TURBO mode). I used to use them when I was younger, but learned my lesson pretty quickly. I've only lost money doing turbo mode on whale club. Be careful out there. 

Also disclaimer, I'm not affiliated with them in anyway. I dont use them anymore and I mainly trade on bitfinex + binance now.

They're up because cb announcement, they're irrelevant now.
If you are going to ride one, ride ADA. It gets pumped harder than the rest.
all those coins except stellar have a very low market cap, I doubt they can drag bitcoin.
Coinbase waits to make an announcement about adding BCH, everyone freaks out. Coinbase announces announcement about potentially adding alts, everyone freaks out. Reminds me soooo much of AOL back in the mid-90's (yes, I'm old). Steve Case was Darth Vader back then and could do no right.
Man, if those shitcoins are leading the market, we’re in some deep shit
because if Stellar for example pumps on the ratio high enough to risk flipping bitcoin, sooner or later the market will decide, hey you know what, time to pump BTC next

Remember what happened last year? Ethereum pumped to .16 on the ratio during the first phase of the bubble, then it started dumping while BTC started pumping, then once BTC ran too far away from it ETH started pumping to catch up

I expect something similar to happen with Stellar this year. 
What street are you getting this info from?

Keep fighting the good fight diydude. Also on an 8 year account , longterm HODLER, bought Bitcoin in 2014 pre MtGox and always upvote your comments. One of the dudes that truly understands the implications of this tech. 
He has 10% of his cold storage on bitmex as a trading stack and trades with that.

So a 10x short means he's hedged and is flat. 

Also funding rate can get *really* bad during trends. It punishes you for trading with the trend. Futures reward you for it. If you counter trade and try to get a bottom/top on futures, you can make significant money off of it. 

For example, at $10k there was a 5% premium on futures. At one point there was a 3% discount recently. If you shorted the top you made 8% simply off of futures price deviation. 

Funding rate means you basically ended up at breakeven (I personally reaped 5% in funding fees from shorting $9ks then lost 3% of that while shorting a few weeks ago due to funding rates) but futures means you netted that in profit. 

Also like btc ftw said, liquidity mainly matters for huge positions. And you can use the liquidity to your advantage to get filled higher/lower.

You can open 100-200k btc positions on futures pretty easily with no issue, after that liquidity starts to become an issue. 
> Why give up the more liquid order book simply to avoid it?

I can't answer for chewie, but I use quarterlies because funding complicates things and because quarterlies are more than liquid enough for my trade sizes. 
As far as I know that wasn’t deflection/narrative at all and is actually what happened.
On the 12th many weren't making a local lower low either.
Unless it is a shitcoin
if 5700 breaks down we are going far far lower than 5500

Thanks a lot for you input! Appreciated. 
Huh, nice. If I'm reading this right, that seems to be more support for the accumulation narrative. Flattening out like that doesn't seem to be overly bullish, but the divergence there seems to be consistent with the story I'm trying to tell myself.

Thanks for sharing!
well thank you very much. I try my best, as with all TA I have no idea which way the price will go...just trying to get an edge, no matter how small!
haha I just reread it in the style of suicidal 50 year weather guy.

Basically where I'm at... I prefer to hold positions longer.. but don't think I'll be able to until we either break above $6900 or below $5700...
ETC did the same thing, it took a few days before the real pumps began. First day the pump was lackluster as well. Never got in though because i thought the pump was over during the first day it was announced.
I agree. These coins will be the first to pump during the next bull market.
That sounds the same. Desktop can display more info at once, so it doesn't have tabs like Mobile does.

As long as you can see the price chart, clicking on it will autofill the limit price.

[EDIT: Apparently the Depth Chart has the same behavior.] 
Yes, I'm on mobile.

On Desktop (which I, apparently obviously, very rarely use) I guess Charts are always visible. So just click on a price in the chart, and then it will autofill into the Limit Price. The behavior is much more obvious without tabs, so this is probably no revelation to you! 
No tab on desktop but it still works the same way. If you click on a price or qty in the order book it fills that info into your limit order. This is nothing new to Coinbase pro, almost every exchange I have used has the same feature. 
Yes that's very true, but it's also for each 3 months I get better and wanna try new strats.


>For the sake of nostalgia. Remember the time when there was like 500-1000 USD differences between exchanges. I basically woke up each day, saw my wire transfer arrive, and locked in free money without even getting out of bed. Now I have to work my ass off trading/scalping, being stressed all day, and deal with shitty market conditions, for much less moneyz (average of +/- $50-100 scalping profits per day per bitcoin). Maybe better times will come in the future, maybe they wont. But there is no reason to be involved 365 days per year, sometimes the market conditions are just bad and it is ok to take some extra free time off.


Yes I did this with like etherdelta and binance last year, you could find like 30% spread deals. Sometimes it failed, but at least it was FUN and you DID something :D

I am also at big cashed out plus for my original crypto investment so for me trading is now more of a strategy game I do instead of playing computer games, not so much to make money so therefore I want to try fun things as much as I can. 
Yeah this looks extremely untradeable. I pretty much just have alerts set up so I can DCA in on what look to be lows / bottoms but other than that my hats off to you guys still longing and shorting this stuff, particularly with any leverage.
Or be one of the various bucket shop exchanges that's selling its order book data to the whales.
A whale obviously wants maximum valuation of their holdings. If they push prices down with a sell off of a small percentage, it is to increase fiat for later buying of more at a better price point or more likely only to test the water for the price which gets an increase of buyers interested. When there’s low volume the market still has to absorb the daily addition of the 1800 new BTC mined each day, about $11MM worth at today’s prices.
Chewtoy, you are one of a few I respect on this forum and always look out for your insightful posts. 

However, I’d just like to clarify what I was getting at: TA is still mostly being respected with regards to the fundamentals. So we have clear levels of support and resistance, MACD, Bollinger etc. But the signals creating those indicators are being magicked out of thin air. There are clear PUMPS and DUMPS manipulating this market and it seems to move at a whim. There is simply not enough natural volume occurring for this to be representative of an organic market. We are reading tea leaves for timeframe not of our own making. And I don’t want any more a part of this until it returns to some natural form.  
You'd think you were a multimillionaire by now with your immense predictive abilities which you like to reference quite regularly 

But back in the real world we see your trades are aligned largely with results that would be achieved through random chance

This is of course the great oracle who back when China banned BTC trading, said that there was no clear relationship between that news breaking and BTC tanking immediately after
No need, it's just implied.
I see delusional in a post: i downvote. Im a simple man.
Can you elaborate here?
Help? Where did I say that?
Man, you're obsessed with with upvotes.
I think most people are forgetting that the 2014 bubble had the little thing where 450 million worth of BTC was being sold on the regular market pushing the price down on top of the regular bubble trading 
I mean wouldn't you want to buy if it goes there? I'm pretty confident we are going to test the low 5k region. And if we do I wouldn't be surprised to see a candle into the 4's. Nothing really surprise's me anymore and I realize predicting 3k (specific target $3100) is putting the cart in front of the horse as there are more moves before we get there but you got to think a few moves ahead. Just preparing. 
Isn't conservative the way to go in a bear market, especially if you aren't shorting? I think it's fair to wait for 5.5k to start DCAing or buy the next high volume breakout and pray for a trend reversal. 
Did you mean to reply to me? I'm not sure where conservative or turning around the money safely was anywhere in my post or why I would find a different place to turn it around or why you would think I wouldn't have money to loose? You make a lot of assumptions. I mean I did use a small percentage of profit as a down payment on rental/investment property. But I'm playing with pure profit as my original BTC entry was sub $2k and got out over 15k but that was nothing compared to alt profit. Then bought the first 5.8k dip, sold at 11k then bought at 7k and sold at 9.7k and now here we are. I'm happy with buying anywhere under 8k to be honest for a long hold until next bull run but obviously I want the biggest discount possible. 
or just use RSI ?
Wrong, this means new ATH within 24 hours! 
I've never subscribed to that notion, just that the lows/highs should be well defined for the time period you're looking at  (with no other significant dips/rises between). Admittedly I haven't read the rationale for it either since I've never seen that said past it being mentioned  here a couple times. I'd certainly be interested to, do you have a source?
Rly... sorry for stating the obvious then....
Is there a minimum btc amount? 
more than welcome to, i still dont really know shit about them

that being said, cos price is fractal, im pretty sure you can zoom in on smaller time frames and make the blocks smaller.

edit: eg: zoomed in on block 3 and narrowed it down https://www.tradingview.com/x/X7TFue58/
Cheers, im deffo gonna stick to it, i love the simplicity. Still quite shaky on it but im working my way through his vids.

Amazing thing is, recently seems to be lots of people using them so theres plenty of resources to learn it all.
After more consideration, I've added four X's, a column of 15 O's and a column of four x's.  Applying your suggested formations does seem to fit. The current column of X's we are in would have to rise to $6400 to create any bullishness- a long pole reversal.  If we make a column of O's (<$6100) the formation height counting method yields a price target of (15\**50\*3)-6750*=$4500.  If I remember correctly, this coincides with an ancient unresolved long pole of around the same price. I hope I'm doing this wrong but that kind of breakdown would certainly be spectacular. Thank you for the reply, it helped.

This here folks is what you call a permabull.
A bull whale never buys in bursts, it makes no sense other than to try to induce FOMO, I have been so damn long in this market  I think I know fake when I see it.  
Yeah I have been wanting to try that one since it has RSI alerts correct?
Why?
"This time it's different" right? 
Great for trading
Where do you see a bear flag?
You’re calling this a bear flag? I’m calling this Bart’s hair.
I don’t think it’s too late, I talked to Pierre and RAVP’d today
It doesn’t matter when it will get approved, my point was *this* application has the best chance to get the green light. I doubt this will get delayed the same way as the other one, they’ve been through the process before, they know what they’re looking for and the applicants know what they want. Even if this one gets delayed and ultimately rejected an ETF will likely happen at this point, and you can have fun being on the other side when that happens
Nice catch! I wasn't able to figure out who that destination address belonged too.
wouldn't that  mean the month we've spent down here becomes increasingly attractive for a long? 
User name checks out.  We're fucking twisted in here.
Yeah it's so odd.  We need a revolution in TA to start representing this better and picking up on this more preemptively.  (lol crypto traders are probably leading such a revolution....)

The ear is all but formed now.

Emotionally preparing self for disappointment now.
This one at least wasn't so sudden initially, wasn't triggered by a market order.  Some guys wall just wasn't getting sold into and we drifted up.  That was actually giving me some (delusional?) hope that it could pick up momentum.  ... Or we just drift till the threshold where all the sidelined shorters franticly take action.

But anyway, yeah.  "Sometimes another leg up" is often enough and would be profitable enough that I don't sell in these conditions.  (kudos to people who do large scalps & mini-swings who jump in and out of these with ease)
No, I didn't use 100&#37; I only used 10&#37;. 

I just didn't know the update command. 

I thought I had the position bot site bookmarked but Chrome for some odd reason blocked it due to "Privacy" or some other foolishness.
I only used 10&#37; not 100&#37;. 
It was normal because it didn't happen once a day then :-P
Yep you can short CFD's on any instrument on most EU platforms. 

I use my profits from trading CFD's to invest into my long term storage just because of the leverage and safety of regulated platforms.

Once the leverage is limited, much smaller positions will be opening so when the price does go up everyone is making much less money.

Why do you think that there is so much psychological manipulation in this market, coinbase "considering" adding the 5 coins they mentioned.

How many people would have taken that as gospel and bought in, then what happens? Coinbase tweet again highlighting that they are only considering adding them > some will re-read the first tweet and realise exactly what has happened.

Give it a few days and this second/third tweet will be the reason the media will say that the price went back down.

So keep the price suppressed until after August then allow it to pump (ETF rumours, which could turn out to be true). 

Much fewer people will make decent returns on the leverage.

EDIT: Grammar/Spelling
OK interesting. How low was it yesterday? And what source do you use to check?
Big Dildo: Green
BGD. You aren't Yoda in a sex shop.
> The bounce from 6100 was very weak as well.
 
The volatility is virtually non-existent right now. The bounce was weak, but so is every single move for a while now. 
Low/mid 6.3k area. I forget where exactly.
you cant start count in the middle of a move..
That's prone to self-select/survivor ship bias no? Few people readily admit that they've outperformed the strategy of doing nothing while still frequenting this sub. 
that wasn't on trading but investing+trading overall 

and I got lots of replies that I didn't put enough options for how in profit people were since I capped it out at like 10000% lol. Some people are up a ridiculous amount 
and also sort of survivor ship bias(but not really), the people who post here are the ones who trade and shows their gains

How do you decide which trader and not was successful after market closing at the bar? The one who was successful will tell you how it went without asking
Trading is a zero sum game, if most people here are making money there must be a lot of people elsewhere losing money, and as far as I can see most of the current volume is from other traders instead of retail buyers so they must be profiting from other traders losing.
The Fat Controller laughed:

"You are wrong."
As in 1.0374^100 ?  That's about 40x your initial investment?!
profits in BTC = "I lost a lot of money in USD"
Couldn't you trade tether or just fiat to increase your BTC stack instead?
Also depends on the % of stack used. IMO it should be PnL = 2.89% * leverage * % of stack.

If someone used 10% of their stack for that trade, they made a 2.89% PnL relative to their trading stack.

If someone used 100% of their stack for that trade, they made 28.9% gain.
Well, there is only one instance where BTC even remotely behaved like it does today and thats 2014. And since Bitcoin has been moving in bubble-cycles since forever, why should it be different now? I mean I dont see us going even close to 3k, people have bought up everything close to 6k so viciously the last 3 times, it just doesnt make any sense to predict us going this low. I think its possible we might drop to 5k or 4,8k but not a lot lower. There is no data to back this up but I think there is too much money on the sidelines from people who sold in the last 6 months that want to get back in and there is too few people that are going to sell around 5k because everybody will think we've found the bottom.
Those are just horizontal supports/resistances (high volume nodes). For example, 5800 is the support formed by the candles in last October ~ November and also the recent bounce.

Just try to draw a line that makes many contacts with the tip of the close/open of candles

That is a good point. I think bulls often tend to be on the side of "I cant think of anyone who would be selling at these prices." Heard that a lot at 7200.
Ya your right, I changed it. Some individuals here with 30 < day old accounts with strong opinions don't like it I guess 
No, they just said mentioned the term, "cryptocurrencies" twice. I saw it on MSNBC

> We are making this announcement internally at Coinbase and to the public at the same time to remain transparent with our customers about support for future assets.

I think the idea is that an employee cannot trade with insider info. Considering they got some [lawsuit](https://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-hit-lawsuit-alleged-insider-trading/) and complains the last time. So from that perspective this is pretty good.
Yea it really doesn't make much sense. Announce it or don't. Maybe some information was leaking and they decided to do it themselves. 
Easy way for a quick buck after coinbase fills its bags with alts.
haha that is the more likely reason for an announcement of an announcement
If they are getting desperate it's because bitcoin doesn't have enough popularity.  Bet you didn't think that one through, huh?
[removed]
spoofing on bitmex has to be the dumbest idea. I mean we already know just being a whale doesn't in any way make you smart or on the right side of a trade lol.
That guy just trolls . I've seen him show position before and it's like 4K contracts. I doubt he has the bitcoin to put up 30m walls.
I've been reading the tape for months now and I've never seen it before. There have been plenty of massive dumps in that time.
yeah, maybe that would have been a better idea. I guess I just got spooked by the weird price action, and 6400 is so close to 6300, which was broken.
Maybe. I'm still convinced the trend is down, but the price action is wacky, volume is low, and I should do other things besides watch the price all day.
Yup edited
I think you are beginning the bubble too low
Yeah fuck me it's too early, how about "trend is your friend"
Just open bitfinex and turn on the AO or RSI and set your period to 12h+
sounds like a bull is gonna bring a gun to bear school.

Thanks!
wow thanks I hope this works!
Could always get a reluctant BGD if volume drops low enough and the order books are thin enough for a cheap pump.
Agreed, these slow climbs haven't amounted to anything lately, same thing for the reverse as well. Nothing is final until mr whale says so. 

That being said my 6.4 and 6.1 DCA entries look more and more like foolish falling knife catch attempts, i'm not gonna exit my positions purely just to stick with my strategy, but i'm feeling darkness ahead of me.

My next entries will be moving with the market not against it.
By the time they cover, they will have bought a lot of Lambos for bulls.

You'd have to be insane to not see ~6k as the bottom. How many times do we have to bounce off it before you see that there is some very big money that wants to buy at that level? 

Wishful thinking 
Well if I need a contrarian indicator on a trade I'll certainly post here. Negative feedback=I am making correct decision. Positive feedback=I need to reverse my thought and do opposite. 

I don't care if people like me or not in regards to making money. I'll leave that to you emotional traders who like playing in your little cliques and circle jerking each other's fragile little egos with up or down votes.

Not bullish enough for bulls? Not bearish enough for bears?
ADA is basically the same MC as XLM.
those shitcoins just got announced by coinbase as being potentially listed soon.

its a news based pump, not just a pump and dump 
You think stellar will end up driving a btc pump?
High Street
Basically means the person who is shorting the price down is a retard.
Speaking as a since-2013 & 8-year-trophy hodler, I don't see a lot of value in telling weirdly infantile stories about Big Shorty and novelty bull songs, but maybe that's just me :P 
All fine until you get screwed by premium on futs flipping....
>  cold storage on bitmex 

does not compute.
your right the russians hacked the voting machines this is why drumpf won despite all of our attempts to call him orange and make fun of his hands
that just means the bull season is back. 

coinbase is pretty good at timing their announcements. They wouldn't have announced this unless their internal data showed that they expected a reversal to the market 
I feel like this diydude guy is secretly a huge bear and spouting BS on this sub.
Yep - was mostly just adding some more support to your argument. The tradeoff with accum/dist is that the fraction can get skewed by a heavily abnormal wick - and given the volatility of bitcoin back in early 2014 and the crazy wicks caused by Mt Gox I'm not sure it's as useful historically so we don't quite have something good to compare to. If you did compare it, the weekly showed a huge bull div before the DCB to $750., followed by hidden bullish divergence along the bottom of the bear market.
If your trading career fails, you should consider doing something with comedy :-D.
Jesus my guy, this made my morn 
Still pretty good.
ETC has been nice to miners, only thing going sideways/up in sats

Don't know how much longer it can last but it is definitely out performing the rest of my cold storage 
Thanks. I was worried for a mo there. I am seriously underwhelmed by the new Pro GUI but I suspect it will improve a lot as new features & coins etc are introduced soon.

I knew about clicking on chart to auto fill limit price, you can also do it with Order Book too. The later being useful to get your order to the 'front-of -queue' by clicking on lowest Ask price -for instance- then editing it in the order-form pane by subtracting  x$ which will then give you the top ranked price Buy-price! potentially saving you a takers fee in fast moving situations.
Yeah, probably nothing new to most. 

Possibly useful for noobs like me, though, who have only ever used Coinbase Pro. 
Isn't the order book already public?
Finally someone here realizes that trading in this manipulated market is madness. Everyone should forget about TA, until the volume is big enough, so manipulation becomes very hard.
If you went back through my post history, I'd honestly be surprised if I referenced my track record in more than 1% of my comments. 

This is probably the 4th or 5th time we've had this debate, but I'll state this one more time:

% accuracy is not a particularly useful metric on which to gauge a successful trader. % gain is the metric one should look to. A trade that results in an 11% gain vs one that results in a -1% loss are weighed equally if you are strictly looking at "did they make profit or take a loss." But the profit vs loss ratio is what's important. 

By and large, I've taken the stance that news does not push the market in a direction it was not already leaning toward due to technicals and/or fundamentals. In regards to the China ban, I've acknowledged in the past that I was probably wrong to take that position, although it's impossible to know one way or the other in hindsight.

Finally, as for my being a multimillionaire, I'd simply state that I do quite well trading BTC, as would anybody who chooses to follow 100% of my position entries and exits. 

EDIT: I will add that the value of BTC had already dropped around 25% prior to the announcement of the China ban.

These are his tracked trades since starting to use the position bot, do they seem like random chance?  I'm not being sarcastic, I'd like someone to comment.  They seem good to me, but I haven't run any statistics on them.
>delusional 

you downvote your own comment then, simple man? ;)
...among other things
Things like naked short selling and manipulation are implicated in the deaths of many companies, and it happens because all of the shares are basically owned by one company, Cede. The old system doesn’t allow for actual tracking of shares so all kinds of fraudulent things can occur that in a better technical system would not be possible. Shares that don’t exist can be used to short, for example. 

By utilizing a decentralized distributed ledger and digital locate receipts you can do huge things like cut out the trillion dollars worth of DTCC middleman, while opening up liquidity, solving the custody problem, allowing for fractionalization of shares, and benefit everyone but Cede/DTCC in the process. 

Everyone will be talking about this by next year but if you look closely you will see Medici quietly positioning themselves in front of the market and  coinbase / Gemini playing catch up behind the scenes. 
You didn't. I inferred it based on your post linking to an article fretting about evil short sellers publishing mean words about companies. 
SMH at my two downvotes
Also the exchange that did 90% of volume went tits up and no institutional money, no real other cryptos, no dapps etc.
*putting the chart in front of the horse
I think if your plan is to DCA through a bear market you're late to the party. The goal is to buy through the entire bear market, not just the end of it.
If you're happy buying under 8k and you're expecting the price to go back up I don't understand why you wouldn't start a DCA after 5,8 is confirmed one way or the other.
Yeah, I was thinking that that would be good for the entry timing.  Pick a day with the 24 or 12 hour, pick a moment with the 4 hour or lower.

However, when you are at the daily scale, and on a down trend, RSI can just keep going.

I think this misery thing is better for longer trades, to hold for at least a week, or a month, or a long term hold entry.  Isn't that it's point?

Using RSI (plus BB) to time when to hop in and out is better suited for small swings or scalps.
For a useless shitcoin that i will never put my money at, based on CB checking an option that it might add it in some distant future which is nothing new obviously! YEY
That's all I've got: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DY5c-a7X0AA2O0K.jpg:large
Don't think so. I started with like 0.01 btc to test it 
Not that I'm aware of. There's a reported decimal cutoff on your P&L of four digits (.0000), but it tracks below that accurately as far as I can tell (eg if you profit .00126 on a trade and then another .00035 your total P&L for the day will sum to .0016)
You need to make the blocks bigger. You won't be able to use the chart without bigger blocks.
He's making a joke about btc/bch Holy war lol 
I've saved this comment specifically so that I can come back and try and make sense of it when I've learnt a little about PnF!

Thanks for the link.

Glad my complete lack of knowledge observation sparked something. 

Personal belief in my corner is that we won't be visiting anything as low as that, but that's for entirely different reasons.

Keep posting about PnF in the daily; we don't have enough posts about it. Don't be worried about someone calling you out on a mistake, it's how we all learn IMO.
It does, in-app purchase though.
Yes it does! I'm nibbling into the lows and I'm going heavily long on the next dump. Daily stochastic isn't quite there yet and has some days to go, shorter term cycles are about to roll over too so probably a dump in the weekend and reversal on Sunday or Monday to paint a nice picture on the chart. Not going to close my shorts though because the chance that we dump straight through this time is always possible. 

The profitable legs up tend to occur on lower volume (in the present market at least), thin order books = easy cheap pump then all you have to do is hold the price steady to unload coins, dump, rebuy lower, rinse and repeat
but a few swings doesn't mean "TA doesn't work" lol it just means the price doesn't go in  str8 line up or down. it never has- only on relief rallies does it seem to just climb forever. and bull runs ofc  
So your saying it's just another piece of news to eventually try and pump on like previous ETF and even the CME futures were? Limiting leverage to 2x would just mean that you could have gone long at anytime pretty much during the bullrun and not get liquidated.

What your saying seems to be the opposite of what investopedia said. It's very lightly regulated, no short selling(actually its not really clear it says no short selling rules so maybe they allow it). Obviously your saying you have used CFDs to short and I have no reason not to believe you but I'm getting contradicting info (or maybe I'm being a little retarded it's my bday and I bin out drinking)

EDIT: link https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/09/trade-a-cfd.asp
Check the daily, someone posted screenshot.

It's irrelevant wall.
Red candles are much taller than the last green one we saw. But yeah, I agree. Market becomes boring :)
Well you managed to avg down pretty well... it's at tough call.. you're ~$100 from break-even which isn't bad.  This bounce will need to move above $6400 to see any sustained momentum.. otherwise it's likely we head lower.

If I were in your position, I'd [trade breakout on the wedge](https://www.tradingview.com/x/btVTAXmI/) (hold if it breaks up, and bail if it breaks down). 
Yeah you got me. I thought it'd be a tight stop
I can point at least 5 traders that have enough reputation here to believe them that they outperformed buy and hold.
Time for new pool?

Simple question. Are you in profit from trading?
I'd be interested in a comparison though.  In the US, trading and then reporting short-term gains tax is rough even if you do quite well with your trades.  Buy and hold for >1yr has been just phenominal on BTC to begin with.
sure, but for me this is like saying that football is a zero sum game and no one should bother getting good at it
Most the current volume are bots haha. And yea I agree, I would say mostly the long time members in this group (20-30 percent of this current group) are up pretty good. 
Yes something like that, a lot more than I made in December. My advice is this: don't be a greedy fuck and get yourself a good teacher with your profits. 
Thank you, yep I was looking at data using 100% of the stack.  My God you guys are some mad lads.
No it isn't. 2014 isn't anywhere even remotely like 2018. Forget about 2014.

The behavior of the market at the time is nothing similar to 2018. 

2014 did not have a parabolic run up. It literally shot up 10x in under a month from nothing with little to no resistance points to act as support on the way down. Literally none of the structures after the run up are similar to how the market behaved in 2018. There is absolutely and **quite literally** *nothing* similar from 2014's chart to 2018. **Nothing**. People need to just...stop. Like actually. 

A better comparison is 2013, where there WAS a parabolic run up, there WERE corrections/resistance points along the way, and the market corrected exactly to 78.6 Fibonacci like most bubbles do. The structures after the ATH are also similar to 2018. Stop comparing to 2014. 

[Here's](https://i.imgur.com/MWWycvw.png) a post I made regarding this issue. While you can see its nothing serious, and I was just having fun, and I am not trying to compare to 2013....there ARE in fact periods in bitcoin's history that behaved more similarly to this correction than 2014. Out of the 7 bitcoin bubbles so far, 2014 has been the fluke. It is the exception. It is the "This time its different" because it was different. The entire behavior of it, the run up, and what happened afterwards is completely fucked and resembles no other bubble *in any market.* The only real resistance 2014 had on the way up was around 160 dollars and that's where the bottom was. Bitcoin has has several strong support levels it created in 2017 and resistance levels and its been bouncing off/humping one of them for 7 months now. 

So just...stop wasting time. Comparing to 2014, is quite literally, a waste of time, I stopped reading your post after I read "2014". It's not even worth the glucose I have to oxidize to fucking put the words together into sentences and then comprehend them. I rather spend the energy fantasizing about paint drying. I'd rather spend the energy sanding plywood with a 500 grit sandpaper for no reason. I'd rather read fucking twilight twice.

Bitcoin can go to 50 dollars for all I care, it will not do it similar to 2014. 
Thanks mate :)
Thanks. To be fair, I hear from bears "I just don't know who is buying at these prices" constantly. One extremely prolific poster here has said it *many* times
Or it's just a good idea to be as specific as available...
Yea those damm small details of hacking the presidential election versus DNC . The nerve
Cool thanks, will be interesting to see if we hear any more details about which ones.

edit: bitcoin was indeed used per article referenced below
How do you know they didn't? I haven't seen BTC specifically referenced anywhere, have you?

EDIT:BTC is specifically referenced here: 

"they principally used bitcoin when purchasing servers, registering domains, and otherwise making payments in furtherance of hacking activity."

Trading on 1M RSI is suicide in the long term. 
That works until it doesnt
I think it has more to do with:

> Unlike Ethereum Classic, which is technically similar to Ethereum, these assets require additional work that necessitates contact with many external parties. To ensure that this news comes to you directly from us, we are publicly announcing our intentions.

Basically, they decided to leak the news early themselves, before a dozen dev teams / external stakeholders bought in / leaked / pumped / etc.
Crypto in general is losing popularity. Everyone was talking about it in December.
it still spooks people, and part of it is to fuck with bots, too. Spoofing  is actually primarily illegal due to an incident with a flash crash after someone spoofed the stock market and caused a bunch of bots to flip the fuck out
Yeah there Def dumb whales out there, just because you dropped $1000 when btc was $0.05 doesn't mean you know how to trade
lol never trust the trollbox. I saw the same thing. He’s been hugely underwater multiple times in the past (by thousands of dollars), and pretty much every frequent poster on there enjoys trolling. I doubt he has millions to throw around like that. If anything, I would trade counter to the trollbox.
Where was the start of this bubble in your opinion? I think it started March 2017 when BTC was at $1.1k and ETH started blasting out of nowhere. It was at $10-15 in February to March. 
cheers, will have a look right now :)
Reason?
He's got the best names for stuff lol I can't stop using it cause judas swing  is an awesome name 😂
Unless he is already at 15x

It's funny because bulls were denying we were even in a bear market until  a month ago when we broke down from a textbook symmetrical triangle.

And now all of a sudden we are at the bottom? Shortly after breaking down from a 6 month consolidation triangle? The bulls have been wrong all year but *this time* it's for real? Sure, buddy.
lol at this point it just means the price moved a lot in 5-15m

I wouldn’t even call this an announcement, this is just a twit about CB future intention of adding more coins.
Does it mean they actually gonna add them?
When? 2019? 2025?
Are they gonna have fiat pairs? 
does anybody even care about CB after the poor performance at the peak and the fact they are far beyond other exchanges? 

When they address this question you can call it an announcement. Until than it’s a manipulated pump based on a speculative twit addressed at people who can only read headlines 

Edit: add to that list that CB pro is absolutely a disaster and unusable on mobile
yes, I think Stellar will be the ETH of the next bubble. 
Oh I thought he was implying that he knew who "said retard" was
Lol, I don't mind it. There's so much of it going both ways it's refreshing to see a perma bull just spout bullish hopium. Deep down my heart is longterm bullish so It's refreshing to see even though I know it's just currently hopium.

Well, the problem is you're a robot with unrefined semantic parsing algorithms.

He has a trading stack on bitmex that is worth 10% of the value of his cold storage. :P 
Does everyone remember when the Coinbase ETC announcement caused that massive pump that started the bullrun? Neither do I.
Hey, you're right!
Re OBV, yeah. 2013 -2015 is totally invalid as a touchstone for this market. What you see from OBV back then is utterly ridiculous noise.
some could say that my trading career is the comedy ... sadface
Thanks... yeah I don't trip out too much anymore on trying to get the whole move.. just most of it if possible. 
He probably means stop-loss/ stop-buy
sort of things
Damnit. I will act accordingly.
Very interesting. Thanks.
Why should it be a goal to buy at higher prices?

If the bear market is just getting started, then no one is late to the party. I think the real bear market starts when there's real capitulation, and that hasn't happened yet.
I did. I bought at 5.8 then sold and waiting for it to go down again as it got rejected. 
Interesting. I understand the idea there, but I'm not quite sure I agree. RSI is calculated using a smoothed RS, and as such has some moving average aspects to it - the 15th candle back still has some effect on the present RSI because it effected the previous 14 average gain/losses. And some indicators, like OBV, don't have a period at all, while others, like CMF, are a 20 period average of a 14 period oscillator that includes smoothing.

It's certainly an interesting discussion to have, though. I'd be more inclined to agree to than premise for periodic indicators that do no smoothing.

I'd also definitely agree the time frame you're looking at should match the time frame of the local lows/highs you're viewing (ie 4 hr chart for 5.8k to now would be a no-no).
We *all* know bigger blocks are the answer, but where you're wrong is when you say we should make the blocks bigger themselves. An easier approach would be to simply make the world smaller, and then the blocks will be relatively bigger. 
oh shit. 

complete r/woosh moment lol
Hmm good point.  Dammit, if I wanna hold onto my long I better get out of here and stop reading this sort of thing ;)
Yeah, it's just if price move within 0.5% for 24h then 2% is huge.

Sorry I forgot to mention the 50% margin call level too so can't really go long at any time.

During the last bull run there were $1000+ spikes and dumps within minutes.

That link is showing the price in dollars, so I'm assuming they are not the same rules as the EU probably America.

You can 100% short CFD's, but i never short bitcoin even though it can be very lucrative. 
It's back again!
It actually looks more like a descending trianle on bitfinex.

Indeed, so can I. But that's only the numerator - percentages are a fraction of the total group, and if some of the group are biased towards (or against) reporting, you're going to end up with a non-representative sample. Even if this sub was 100% break with gains and losses on a normal distribution, I find it likely that those in the top quartile would be more likely to respond than those in the bottom quartile. If we had 100 people trading, and the bottom 25 didn't report their losses (embarrassment or whatnot), our winners (the top 25) would appear disproportionate (eg 25/75 as opposed to 25/100 mixed through whatever disinclination losers have to reporting). That doesn't make such a poll useless, only that it's reporting different data than we might hope or want.

I don't doubt that there are some that frequent this sub who've profited immensely and have outperformed the market. But I don't know that we'll ever nail down an objective percentage simply due to human behavior.
There are definitely relatively newer people who have outperformed buy and hold. However, are any of the 5 traders you mention from 2014 or earlier? Are they more profitable trading than they would have been just buying in 2014 (or whenever they first bought) and holding?
Problem is that many people who are down/suffered big losses are gone, and you won't see their vote. Good example of survivorship bias which is not ideal for stats.

edit: described much more eloquently here: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ygs6s/daily_discussion_friday_july_13_2018/e2buqez/
That depends on your margin use though. If your trading your actual stack, STCG will eat you alive. Use your stack as collateral and you'll make STCG on additional profits, but LTCG on your holdings. 
Are we talking about the football where you get injured a lot or the football where you pretend you get injured a lot?
Heh I'm a wimp compared to some of these guys.

/u/_chewtoy_ , you effectively doubled your trading stack with your 10x 100% of trading stack short from 6640, right?
This should be stickied until we reach ATH again.
I see you pop up every time 2014 is mentioned lately so you're kinda like the opposite of me...except you've already kinda been proven wrong by the charts and you're getting a lot more emotional about it. I'd suggest you take a step back and really look at it objectively.

as much as you don't like it has been very similar to 2014 so far in terms of % ATH price movements and the length it's taken to move.

we dumped big time, DCB'd to 86%, kept dumping, bounced off 30% ATH, kept getting rejected by a big log downtrend line, broke through it upwards right before summer, then continued riding it down from the topside after a double top. it actually looks exactly like 2014.

And like I keep saying...we're *under* where 2014 was ATH % wise.

Ignoring the similarities is just denial imo, shit's super similar. adamantly saying there's nothing similar about it is straight up 100% emotional denial, sorry dude. really take a step back and look at it objectively

forget about 2014...youre just screwing yourself out of money. it's been very profitable and insightful so far. 

Your comment is pure emotion and seeing what you wanna see, sorry but gotta be real w you dude 
Holy moly, talk about an overreaction. Look at the daily candles, take 2 screenshots and compare the way boths charts go parabolic (yes they do, 2013-14 took 2 months, 2017 took 3 months) and botch charts retrace kind of similar when you look at it percentagewise and they way they just bleed out after 3 attempts with lower highs. The only thing thats different is that we already broke all the resistances from ATH while that took longer in 2014. I dont know if we are talking about different things though?! Im talking about the run up at the end of 2013 and how it behaved in 2014. I mean there is nothing really happening at the end of 2014 thats worth talking about.
>Out of the 7 Bitcoin bubbles so far,

It's almost as if regulations exist to protect consumers and many of the ways bitcoiners lose money are preventable.
Au contraire, mon frere. That would make you a fuck of a lot richer than 99 percent of this sub if you hedled 1/10 of your stack. It's all about the returns, baby.

The dumb whales are the ones dumping, as always. They're well and truly fucked as will become clear over the next couple months as they cover and drive the price to a new ATH (in September by my reckoning). Crazy, right? !RemindMe 90 days.

this is coinbase, do you think they make an announcement like that on their official account if they haven't already done the work?

this isn't some off the cuff remark during an interview, this is them using an official PR channel to spread the rumor to make sure they can pump the price twice 
my money is on Cardano
ETC was a shitcoin with no real world use

Stellar has the partnership with IBM, has actual banks using their tech and a number of apps that ditched ETH to use them instead. 

Pretty much the perfect storm of what you need for a bubble pump. 
Why even try? BitMEX doesn't work during wicks anyway. There are only two options to catch wicks imo.

1. Stagger limit orders in advance in the area you think it might wick to on futures

2. Open two opposite positions and market close one at the top of the wick. This still slips badly usually but market close orders take precedent in the engine, so it's marginally better
lol, have an upvote
A DCA assumes that you don't know where the bottom of the market is. If you want to maximize your investment then you invest through the entire bear market. If you happen to guess the bottom you're still only able to put half as much in... and that assumes that after we hit the bottom we don't immediately rocket back up. What if it takes 1/10th the amount of time to go from 6k to 10k as it took to go from 10k to 6k? 
That's not a DCA. But good for you for making a quick profit. Really not trying to antagonize you. Just providing a different perspective. No big deal if you're not interested in it.

Cheers
Don't get me wrong, you can actually make some really good money following these pumps. The trick is knowing when.

A lot of times what I observe is that the price ultimately gets held in a very limited range as a means to dry up volume and once that occurs then the pump happens for the reasons I mentioned above 

Edit: usually after pumps (like the one to 6800)   I exit my long/sell and wait till we make a lower low and ignore all the noise in between. I have a target at 5500 (Bollinger bands on the monthly have us touching the middle band right around there and would still maintain a good longterm up trend)

Thats a very good point. Im in Europe and didn't pick this up. Thanks for clarifying!

Like I said in different post I think it's like forex, around 15% get out in profit.
If traders from 2017 outperformed buy and hold till now then they probably would do this also if they started in 2014.

On my own example I can only compare the point I entered, I can't compare to someone who bought sub 1k cause I wasn't here at the time.
Right. I think we can assume that it's more less like forex, about 15% get out in profit.
both i think
I did, yes. 
huh? how?

he didnt take a significant profit
I mean here's the same log trendline for [2013](http://prntscr.com/k5znnl)

Sure it doesn't touch it twice before it breaks it like 2018 (in some exchanges it might have since there was a lot more disparity back then), but 2014 also rides along it before it breaks it and 2018 does not. I mean lets just ignore all the other similarities between 2013 and 2018 and focus on this one line that fits our bearish narrative. 

Sloppy, I got respect for you, but look at that picture I posted in my previous comment and tell me with a straight face 2018 is *more* similar to 2014 than it is to 2013. 

We could ride this down yes, Just like 2014 and arguably 2013 but it doesn't mean its going to correct 85% or even 77%. 2018 is 2018.
it took BTC a month in 2017 to do a 3x, where as it did 10x in a month in 2014 (end of 2013) with ZERO corrections that could later become support. the run up started at around 160-190 dollars and thats where the bear market ended. The parabolic/crazy move of 2017 started at 5800 dollars and in a month it got to 20k. 

Like I don't know what else to tell you. 5800 is as strong of a support as 160-190 dollars was for Bitcoin in 2014. I personally believe we are going lower, but to compare 2014 directly to 2018 is lunacy. 
are...are you telling me to kill myself? bro.
Used to influence and hack are two completely different terms and not interchangeable. That's my problem with this. But the hack of the DNC could have been used to help influence the election yes. But if we are going to be fair the DNC did just as much damage by colluding against Sanders thus unfairly influencing the presidential election equally.
Thanks, bud. Text for those interested:

"they principally used bitcoin when purchasing servers, registering domains, and otherwise making payments in furtherance of hacking activity."
naw, I wouldn't bet too highly on this

This. Previously at $1800 was right after the the ETH run up and dump. At $6k was the chain split. $6k to $8k was because of the future news. Rest was fomo.

Don't assume they 'did the work'...it sounds more like they are preemptively leaking it before their partners do, basically:

> Unlike Ethereum Classic, which is technically similar to Ethereum, these assets require additional work that necessitates contact with many external parties. To ensure that this news comes to you directly from us, we are publicly announcing our intentions.

It's still a somewhat-important announcement, but it only boils down to "you heard it here first, folks."
> this is coinbase, do you think they make an announcement like that on their official account if they haven't already done the work?

Absolutely yes. 
> this isn't some off the cuff remark during an interview, this is them using an official PR channel to spread the rumor to make sure they can pump the price twice

or, more appropriately, so idiots can get dumped on twice.
my money is on Cardano being the one to watch for in the bubble after the next one. they just don't have a finished product/partnerships yet to attract big money investors. 

don't get me wrong, they'll probably still do a 5x-10x from the current price like everything else will when there is a bubble. 

But I'm not talking about that, I'm talking about the select few coins that define a bubble. Like how ETH went 250x during the last bubble. 
So in the future I can MAYBE buy these coins marginally more conveniently (It's Coinbase, that's debatable) than before?  Bullrun is coming any day.

yes...  unfortunately it's gotten harder with Mex... when I was trading this on the way up last year, I could consistently get market orders to execute right on target .. for some reason this changed during the bear market with major slippage during big moves
> If you want to maximize your investment then you invest through the entire bear market.

The point of DCA isn't to maximize your investment, it's to minimize the effect of short term volatility.

I don't think there's a wrong time to start DCAing, either. It seems to be counter to the whole idea of DCAing to try to time when you start and stop buying to be in line with particular market conditions.
...Yes it was until the price action flipped. If the price kept going down I would have kept buying more. 
Y'know, I really need to get better at scalping longs.  It's so easy for me to enter and exit shorts, but I'm always getting attached to longs hoping I can ride it for awhile.  (yeah they're called longs and shorts for a reason heh)

As a compromise I tend to ladder my profit taking, but I'm starting to wonder if I had just fully sold every single one of my longs after only a single leg up, I'd be more in profit.  (so much wash trading)  Then again, if I did that, I'd have reentered more often too so I'd probably end up with the same amount of losers.

Ah nice edit.  I don't think I could be out of a position that long.  That's very disciplined of you.
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how you respond to not-excellence with class!
Responded like a gentleman and a scholar *tips hat*
> If traders from 2017 outperformed buy and hold till now then they probably would do this also if they started in 2014.

I'd be curious to hear from anyone from 2014 or earlier if they had just held their buy and never traded would they up better off? I feel like the overwhelming majority of people I talk to who made buys then say holding would have been more profitable. Maybe /u/_chewtoy_ has some thoughts?

edit: to be clear, even if most people say holding from 2014 would have been the more profitable move, that doesn't necessarily mean anything going forward
Ok thanks, just trying to make sure I understand that bot’s formatting. 

Well done!
He closed at like $5850 for a 11% profit or so. At 10x leverage and 10% of stack, comes out to about 110% gain on his trading stack. 
I'll look at this tomorrow gotta sleep, but to dismiss it entirely is silly,. Even if you think it'd not going to turn out the same, so far it's been pretty close

And I've looked at 2013, doesn't look v similar and bear market would've already ended 
I feel like we are looking at it in a different way, I can totally see your point but the similarities in the way the chart moved and how it behaved after the bubble popped are still pretty similar even though the run up might have been different. I guess thats an agree to disagree.
If you are thinking of trading based on the 1M, listen to this guy ( u/armastevs ). +1%, +2%, +3%,+5%, then a -30% is going to happen. Theres a reason the only 1m traders are high-volume quant firms. 


edit: tag
you guys are both agreeing but don't realize it 
You can always get screwed by someone waiting for that kind of order to use the liquidity ;-)

Imagine it's just an intern holding some bags and wanted to make a quick buck. They get fired but just made +15% on their 30x longs. worth 
its not about you, its about the newbie investors who go on coinbase and buy everything

don't believe thats powerful? Need I remind you that LTC went to $375 during the bull run. A completely useless coin with no real world adoption went to $375/coin. 


Yeah it's a joke that they haven't fixed their engine yet. I understand that it might be a difficult task to rebuild it for better performance but they certainly have the capital to do so and they are clearly not prepared for another influx of traders.
> It seems to be counter to the whole idea of DCAing to try to time when you start and stop buying to be in line with particular market conditions.

Yes, I'm arguing that waiting for a market bottom is counter to a DCA based approach.
I tried the whole day trading thing, too easy to get caught off guard so I usually make 4 or 5 trades a month instead. Could I be more profitable? Oh hell yeah, but it's not worth the stress for me so I stick to the 4hr and day charts.

Edit: buying in this range isn't really a bad thing either, I believe we are close to finding the bottom (but will likely range trade for awhile)
lol he's either joking and messing with me or more likely really annoyed by seeing my name everywhere and I can honestly say I fully understand how annoying it might be to see me commenting 800 times a day.

And really, not even saying this to appear calm and collected (because I really normally don't respond that well to strong, pointed criticism) but this one made me laugh lmao
I did not do particularly well trading in the $200 to $1,160 range. I was still profitable, but nowhere near as profitable as buy and hold in that range. I even went so far as to rage-quit when the market dropped from $1,160 to $760 and sold my entire cold storage and trading stack that I'd accumulated mostly in the $200 to $300 range. 

It wasn't until the $2,000 to $3,000 range about 6 months later that I reinvested (but with less fiat than I initially had invested). 

So, in short, had I just thrown a ton of fiat at BTC in the $200 to $300 range and sat on my hands I'd be significantly better off than I am currently. 

However, a large part of that is because I still had a lot to learn in the early stages of my trading career. I'm a significantly better trader now than I was then. More disciplined, less emotional, etc. 
> I'd be curious to hear from anyone from 2014 or earlier if they had just held their buy and never traded would they up better off? I feel like the overwhelming majority of people I talk to who made buys then say holding would have been more profitable.

Only in the past few months have I really started to out-perform 2014 buy-and-hold. During most of the bull market I under-performed (due to selling early and often, and only riding part of the waves up), but during most of the bear market I caught up and finally surpassed (being in fiat most of the time and only scalping a few longs here and there).

The trick now is to find the bear market bottom within some reasonable margin of error....
Chew got back around 2k and is way up so don't think he's good example.
ohh my bad. I was looking at the recent 6360 close of 3% profit.
No it would not have ended already. 2013 corrected to 77% ($4600 from 20k), we are nowhere near that. We have not established a V bottom if we are to follow 2013. In terms of time sure, it should have ended but the length is irrelevant, what matters more is the structure.

If we are to include the BGD events of 2018 and 2014 (where we broke the ATH log trendline) as being the same events chronologically, then this market is moving 30% faster than 2014. And 2013's correction was faster than 2018's. 
The run is extremely important. There is a huge difference between going straight up 10x and going up 10x but correcting along the way and establishing support levels. Bitcoin had major corrections along the way. It's everything. For Bitcoin to correct 85% now, is MUCH, MUCH tougher than for how it corrected to 160 dollars in 2014-2015, because there were very little established support levels. I can see you and sloppy's points regarding the ath log trendline and how we are riding down it and it might be similar to 2014, but that says nothing about where the bottom of this market is. That depends entirely on support, which is something that was established on the way up. I wasn't around for 2014, so I don't know what compelled the market to go full retard do a 10x in a month.
I agree.
They are meming
https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/some-of-you-guys-are-alright
Haha yeah man. Granite, this is a trading sub, but just trying to lighten up the sediment a little, can be a tuff crowd sometimes. Talk to you laterite.
lol and go brag about it at 4chan
yeah and then they would get their ass sued *so* hard, fun to imagine though
The newbie investor came in late 2017 and got burned, he will only came back after bitcoin makes the headlines for a new ATH. Time to face reality 
For my own sanity I should consider longer trades.  But I think I'd get rekt managing the RR, because while I've been successful with longer trades, the positions were much smaller to be able to survive a 10%+ price swings DCA.  If I traded fully for longer term, I'd scale that up and then blow the dca load early (I did try a larger scale longer term trade recently, ended horribly)

I agree about buying here.  Have bought some for the hodl stack this month.

Thanks for the response, Chew that makes sense. Wasn't trying to reopen any wounds (I know you're way over it anyway) but you came to mind in this convo between /u/v4mpyre and I
Ah ok, for some reason I thought he started earlier than that - thanks.
Fraud caused it to go up straight up, which makes the reason for the prolonged bear market make even more sense. We have seen no such evidence for fraud for this run up. People might want to try and say tether was fraudulent but so far we haven't seen any evidence for it nor do I think it would matter as the prices were completely justified by the massive world-wide scale mania we saw.
https://willyreport.wordpress.com/2014/05/25/the-willy-report-proof-of-massive-fraudulent-trading-activity-at-mt-gox-and-how-it-has-affected-the-price-of-bitcoin/
Oh schist! I see how your chalking! Be careful some people here may want to Chert you for making so many puns! It's of no fault of your own and they'd likely be charged with aggregated basalt!
I wouldn't even blame them. it'd be hilarious 
no one got in trouble for the bch pump 
oh absolutely. 

But thats the thing with bear markets, they aren't permanent. Sooner or later the price hits a low enough point and it reverses and starts heading back up again. 

And once that happens, the move up, once you break out can be very violent since there is a shitload of money on the sidelines and the order books are fairly empty. We had something like 30,000 BTC on the sell side on BFX during the bubble run, now its less than half that. 

So basically as soon as the golden cross happens, I wouldn't be surprise to see the price double within a month.

And yes the normies won't find out about this until the ATH gets taken down. And even then they'll be shy about investing. Which just means they won't go all the way in until we hit $100,000/coin or whatever it ends up being at. And then we see just how high the normies can pump it before the bubble pops again. 


oh I don't mind. I don't lose sleep over it. 

If I hadn't sold everything and taken the time away from the market when I did, I probably would have wound up just another BTC sob story. So I don't regret the decision at all. 
He did but then he rage quit and come back around 2k.
What we did have was every possible mainstream news outlet and YouTube influencer hocking cryptocurrencies. Everyone was suddenly a self-proclaimed  expert selling “quality advice” and courses on how to get rich in cc. Would such a perfect storm ever happen again? Maybe after an ETF announcement, but a lot less people are falling for it the second time around!
So if he had just bought where he did originally and held and never traded and never rage quit, would he be better off? Isn't that what we're trying to determine here?

edit for clarity
Except it doesn't need to be like that for BTC to rise in price again. And what do you mean "falling for it?" Falling for what exactly? Are you implying that BTC is some kind of scam?
I may be wrong here but knowing his performance since 2k I'd say he's right now in better position than someone who bought at 200 and held until today. But he's a really good trader. I'm average trader and still can say that I'm better than anybody who bought and held since 1k...
You see what I mean thought, right? *Right now* you're doing better than people who bought and held since 1k, but is that trading performance sustainable, and will it outperform future hold gains? (if they come) Good luck to you homie
I know what you mean. I trade for a year. At 20k I was around 20% behind people who held, but that saved my ass on the way down. That's where trading comes in hand. But it's not for everybody. For 80% people holding will be better. But the problem starts in bear market. If you started holding in December you'll wait a long time to come to be...
Yep I hear you - check Chew's response though, very interesting.
I saw that. I think the amount of fiat reinvested makes a difference now.
