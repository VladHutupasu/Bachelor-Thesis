Just a heads up for people that care, there's been another spike in coin days destroyed in the past few hours.

Admittedly this doesn't mean anything price related, though be aware that some "long stored" coins have made a move. Last time this was accompanied by a market price drop, though it could be an OTC transaction.

I'm also slightly too inebriated to contribute here but felt I should communicate this. 

Interesting macro development. SEC inviting public comments related to proposed Bitcoin ETF rule change: [https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/cboebzx/2018/34-83520.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/cboebzx/2018/34-83520.pdf) SEC will start moving on this within 45 days ('yes', 'no,' need more time, etc.).
Gosh damn it, I’m regretting my decision last night.... fucking Bitcoin, 5 yrs in and I’m still a total noob. This is why I don’t trade. If 5.8-6k holds again for the third time... bounces hard... and THEN plummets right though it on the fourth visit that’s just dirty... and that’s something you can expect from Bitcoin 
This year has been brutal. Still focused on finding work and offering value for ethereum. Let’s hope it pays off in the long run. Bears, you win this past 6 months but it won’t last forever. 
[Still trying to build that bullish case](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8tx0m2/comment/e1cwya2) and seeing one other narrative that I didn’t see before, namely a _potential_ ascending ‘inverted head & shoulder’: https://www.tradingview.com/x/pUV4udam/

This would be quite different from the IHS around 6600, that everyone was raving about. This IHS would be sloping up (more bullish) and the candle bodies are arguably more bullish (1) hammer candle at the head and (2) a single doji candle at the right shoulder: https://www.tradingview.com/x/1A8IC0Gu/

If this formation confirms (close above 6400), and that’s a big _if_, that would also confirm the bullish divergences.

And even if the above confirms, to me it’s a signal to close a short and _not_ necessarily to open a leveraged long.
Buying some BTC in binance right now makes me feel like I'm dealing with some low volume shitcoin on some shit exchange. Voulume feels so low.
No more Barts. We now have the EKG pattern [Electrocardiogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography)
Allow me to interject here and take on the role of the Devil’s advocate.  


To start, I think that we can all agree that over the past several days there’s been a rather clear rise in the numbers of calls for sub 5K, 4K and 3K. And in a demonstration of the value of this thread, the majority of those calls have been supported by some rather robust TA analysis. 


In addition, we now have more individuals openly discussing the expectation of a final capitulation event on the near-term time horizon. Here again, by the sheer definition of the term capitulation, it can be effectively argued that such an event hasn’t actually occurred as of yet and – tying the two above points into a nice bow – the latter here could result in the former.  


There is undeniable logic supporting a continuation of the present decline in crypto asset values. At the same time, however, what I find moderately concerning is a lack of any form of discussion over the impact of a sharp/sudden reversal in that trend. I suspect most here will say that such an event may be possible, but is not at all probable. True, and I would even agree. Nevertheless, what I am stating is that a “fat tail” risk does exists and one that I would advocate crypto traders do take into consideration.  


Now, to be clear I am not speaking of another $1,000 BGD. There were factors which led to that April event and key variables that don’t exist at present (namely the ratio of shorts to longs). So too did that move prove to be fruitless in the end. No, what I am raising for the collective consideration is the potential for a week to ten day fundamental resetting of price at a much higher level. A move that counters, at 180 degrees, the current conditioning of the community as to what is to be “expected”. 


The trend reversal is even an outcome that might not actually require a specific catalyst, rather a communal (and cognitive) decision that takes into account both the process of price discovery along with the supply/demand of BTC concluding in the end that the price of BTC should be far higher. Again, the likelihood of such an event, today, seems as though it should remain in the land of rainbows and butterflies. And perhaps it should. All that I would like to suggest is that it is a scenario that shouldn’t be dismissed out of hand.  


Be well my friends. 


TL:DR – Be vigilant and do not discount the (fat tail risk) probability of an aggressive and sudden reversal in price.  
A textbook stophunt, beautiful stuff
The daily has been high on text/sentiment/emotion and low on charts recently, so I'll add a little of both. 

Like many folks here, I'm scratching my head a little at the longs piling up on a dropping price and volume. While I'm not a big believer in conspiracy/manipulation theories, I do believe the market does move in the path of least resistance. On Monday, we had underwater shorts, a potential bottom, and a tether print fuel a spike upwards. That stalled out under $6300. It's evident that there is significant resistance above us. Longs are up nearly 8% since we peaked there, and the majority of those are underwater. It's clear that there is major dip buying happening here. A break back under 6000 would likely be catalyzed by those bailing, a la a mini long squeeze. 

Speaking of squeezes, I think many people think short squeeze = 4/12 BGD. As /u/SloppySynapses and others (including me) have pointed out earlier, that was an extremely unique event that required a perfect storm of circumstances and likely won't happen again. We have squeezes all the time when leveraged positions are shaken out. 

Now for some charting. I don't think there's a ton to watch in the short term. As has been the case for some time, there's significant chop which I believe is intended to transfer the gambler/high leverage/impatient trader's coins to the patient trader's wallet. Last night's spike to 6250 is a prime example. Apologies for the slightly cluttered charts.

I'm also watching this shorter term downtrend line, but I'm not really looking to execute anything on a break of it: https://www.tradingview.com/x/zi7YopVb/  

Bottom line, look at the trend. The trend is your friend, and the trend is down. There's little incentive to believe we've reversed that trend until we break out of our channel around 6600, and I'd prefer to see 6800. That said, the r/r here actually favors a long. Breaking under 6K (~$100 drop) would be a much clearer indication to cut it than getting to $6200 ($100 rise) would be for a short. 

I'm currently holding a short on swaps (4x 50% of stack @ 6150), and I've been debating flipping that to September futures. I think chances are decent that I could close here ($6100) and get a September entry at $6100 on chop at some point here. I'll update the bot if I do. 

Good luck all. 
Glad to see price discovery is finally over.  BTC = 6130
Haven't posted in awhile and will continue to put my attention elsewhere but I'm surprised by the bulls right now. A few days ago I was certain we would close the daily under 6k until those huge buys from 5.7 to 6.2. It made a nice hammer on the daily at the bottom of a long sell off. I'm still unconvinced this is the bottom, though. 

My strategy is still to wait until the end of July before entering the market. If we are still above 6k by then I think the likelihood of this being the bottom is high. If we close a daily under 6k before that it will probably send us further down into the 4's. Good luck everyone. I'll be lurking here and there but won't be actively trading until we are out of this downtrend.
GBTC hasn't apparently been this oversold on an RSI basis since 2015. Something to note about this market - the signs of panic and despair are getting very, very palpable.
If we're talking about stophunts, $20k to $5.8k was literally a gigantic stophunt before the real rally. The greatest fakeout in the history of markets!
Shorts aren't piling up. The squeeze worked.
That was fast down and up again. 
Dont we have fun here !!
So, looks like the market is gonna take a nice bite out my trading stash when the June Futures settle. Not too big a loss, but I think everyone here can agree that nobody likes losing.

And the funny thing is that I was implementing a plan that would prevent exactly this from happening. I had almost exited my long in the June's Futures at Bitmex, and I decided to move my buy orders to the September Futures. Thus, if we dropped to a range below, I would have reduced the risk of the price dropping to a lower range in June.

But then, I decided "I'm adding buy orders of $15 every week, let's add them where the June orders were". It turns out that was a bad idea... Oh well, live and learn. At least this lesson isn't as costly as some other lessons I've had to learn while trading bitcoin. 
we broke out from the wedge I posted below... 
Patiently seeking a panic catalyst over the next few weeks.
I just noticed this recurring pattern in ETH during this downtrend, thought I'd share:

I'm really liking all the negativity I am seeing recently. People asserting cryptos are dead, pointing to the price action as evidence. We are approaching the bottom, I can feel it in my bones.

My thoughts are if you can look at [this graph](https://imgur.com/a/f7hHSdP) and then declare Bitcoin or cryptos dead because of the current price action, you can go fuck yourself because your opinion means nothing to me.

The horizontal line is 1.0

No short squeeze in play.
Guys, can some1 please let me know the Long orders currently is at 32,500. Is it the actual total number of BTC which longed? For example 1 Long = 1 BTC. Or it is the number of Long Order, for example 1 Long = 2BTC, another Long = 10 BTC (so maybe more or less than 32,500 BTC)

I guess 1 Long = 1 BTC but I am not so sure, never used Bitfinex before.
Not sure what will happen, but a bigger move is overdue. 4h Bbands getting tighter and tighter...
last bit of bullish hopium before I kill myself,

The only time bitcoin really crashed through the 0.786 fibonacci level was the 2014 bear market. The 2013 bear market ended exactly at that level, and the bear market before that as well, as did the dot com bubble. Neither time were a rounded bottom and Bitcoin rebounded well. So perhaps 2014 was exception and we will really see the bottom at around 0.786 fib ($5000 USD) which also coincides with our long term trendline. 

I've done a bit of TA (I am not a pro trader, just a young wolf) 

Taking one of my previous comments into consideation:

> Assuming that this is playing like 2014, and that we are following the ATH downtrend now to goblin town, and that the April 10 Green dildo was equivalent to the large pump on May 18, 2014.....then we can conclude the following: From the ATH of 2013 to May 18, 2014 was 167 days, From the ATH of 2017 to April 10, 2018 BGD, was 116 days, From May 18 2014, to the bottom of the bear market, took another 241 days, Using the same ratio, then we can conclude that from the April 10 BGD to the bottom of this market will take 6 months from that date. Therefore there are approximately 93 days left (3 months) in this bear market and the bear market will reach its bottom in late September....

Assuming the above plays out, and we are in fact following 2014 in terms of the pattern of the market, at a 30% quicker rate...then

This is my ["TA"](https://prnt.sc/jzu2qg)

[Closer look](https://prnt.sc/jzu128)

It appears that we are in the same descending channel from the ATH as we were in 2014 after the corresponding BGD event. We broke out of that channel prior to hitting the bottom (and the log support) and then finally touched the log support. Assuming this goes according to 2014, but does not break 0.786 fibonacci, then the market bottom will be around 5000 USD (0.786 Fib) mid to late September just like in my calculation. 

Don't take this seriously, I'm just having some fun but something to think about. I really don't think this is going to go the same way as 2014 in terms of the % drop from the ATH. I'm not really going to kill myself either. I took several multiples of my initial investment out a long time ago.

And yes, dropping 1000 dollars more is the best hopium I have. I really don't think 5776 was the bottom.
So here we go, current situation as I see it.

- In terms of the cloud, realistically our last decent support is the 1 hour Kijun which is currently at 6050 (Binance). We are under basically every cloud on almost all timeframes. Not good.
The 1 hour Kijun interjects a support line taken from our yearly low, so if we break this my best guess would be a retest of the big low.
http://imgur.com/hzifMvt

- My trusty 144WMA, we have now fallen under it on nearly all timeframes. Daily, 4 hour, 2 hour, 1 hour, 30min.. again this isn't good. To add some perspective, we dropped under the daily 144 on 10th May and are just nowhere near coming back up to it.

- 4 hour MACD has just crossed to the negative, with the daily flatlining/intertwined.

The daily MACD is currently at the very end of its triangle formation, every time this year we've reached a similar position we've either broken up or down with violence. So really i'm expecting something big soon (said the schoolboy to the bishop).
http://imgur.com/YHRG0s0

- The daily Wavetrend is now flat and in a very low position. There is some room to go down but not a ton left compared to the Feb low 
http://imgur.com/I72nnBA 

no prediction with this one, it's just interesting to see. We certainly have plenty of upside to move into should it decide to.

Apart from that there isn't much to report really. Just that i'm expecting a reasonable move in the near future, so within a few days perhaps. By reasonable I mean a good 10%. Of course I have no goddam clue which way but seeing as it's a bear market the odds are certainly in favour of a move down. 

I still have my 1st target , which I posted a few days ago of 5300 with my 2nd target of 4950ish. 
http://imgur.com/0gOfOrg

As always this shit is a nightmare to predict, no one can predict it, merely just try to understand the bigger picture and react accordingly should it break up or down. 

In the last hour (from now, not hourly candle) on BFX, market buys have outnumbered market sells  about 1,000 BTC to 350 BTC. Meanwhile, the price has only gone up by $18. I think *this* is the sort of liquidity someone who is accumulating might be looking for. 

Then again, maybe wash trading, maybe nothing. DYOR, I've been wrong many times before.
Cant help but find that hilarious

Moved my SL from 5940 to 6005 10 minutes before the dump.

There goes my $500.. Maybe I should quit crypto all together, now that I've recouped all of my 10k losses, and sleep like a baby.. This is consuming my life :'(

Sorry for a little breakdown

Everyone is saying longs increasing and shorts decreasing without any price change is an indicator for further drop.

On the contrarian side what if it is smart money getting in position for a trend reversal?
The main bullish things I see are: bounce off 5800, a bullish daily doji, historic oversold RSI with some divergence, possible falling wedge forming.

Yesterday, /u/SloppySynapses made a [great observation](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8tx0m2/daily_discussion_tuesday_june_26_2018/e1cqpbs/?context=3) in a conversation that I wanted to add some color to:

> small theory of mine- there are a few very large arbitrage groups that make sure exchanges are kept in lockstep. this has occurred since futures opened (spreads were much larger before futures opened) and over the weekends sometimes spreads get kind of wide, possibly because the groups running the arbitration do not operate or have access to funds over the weekends.

That's an astute observation, and I think you're half right...spot on about the new behavior, but (I think) off on the cause. I don't think it's direct arb, but rather the new class of HFT algos now running cross many of the major exchanges since roughly December or so.

Instead of direct exchange-to-exchange arb, they work as "momentum bots"...if one or two exchanges start drifting up slightly, dozens of BTC get put on the best bid on other exchanges (and vice versa). I'm sure the bot rules vary and are more complicated and whatnot (VWAP, trade and exchange weighting, etc.), but the behavior is very noticeable.

You can also tell it's not pure arb because price differences are allowed to persist, while the direction is very well enforced (Bitfinex could be $25 lower than Bitstamp, but if Bitstamp and OKCoin go up $5 then the bots stack up on the bid until Bitfinex goes up $5).
Y'all ready to ride this <6k?

Missed it last time.


I'm just a noob who understands how shorting works, can someone tell me what futures, perps, and <insert name of the month> contracts are and how they work?

Thanks.

edit: fuck me, bulls are defending surprisingly well. possible stop hunt before pump?
Guys, underwater long looking for hopium checking in. 

Is it possible for buyers to accumulate while price and volume decrease? Is it even possible to hide the buying that well?

My thinking is if there was accumulation that looked like accumulation, others would pile in and quickly get price back up. So they slow bleed it hoping (not succeeding) to draw in shorters while accumulating/suppressing price for as long as possible (cuz quiet accumulation is slower than accumulation via capitulation). Why don't they accumulate on a capitulation candle? My theory is sub 5750 is uncharted territory and going there means there won't be bounces left to play. 

This all hinges on whether it's possible for whales to accumulate on declining price and volume so as to not set off obv/volume indicators. 

Thoughts?
These stupid wicks up and down are getting old
Praying september futures gets over 6200 so I can hedge out my mex account and then go short.
No follow-through dumping... interesting. This one could actually flip north pretty quickly! (Smallish timescales, of course)
First time checking price/ Reddit / position since early AM.

That Kraken wick absolutely fucked me. Had stops at $6206 and they somehow got executed.

Had some pretty decent short entries, one from mid $6300’s and another from the high $6200’s. 

Out of position for now, little heated and don’t want to revenge trade 
[deleted]
People who will invest in crypto today or in the weeks to come will always win in sometime in the future. Those who were rich when BTC was $20000 were those who bought it many years ago when people thought it was worthless. 2018 may as well be the accumulation year. The reaping years will come!
Did anyone catch the remainder of the whalepool interview with Phil Potter after they cut off the Youtube stream? The first part was mildly interesting, some takeaways:

* OTC volume varies wildly, there is no frenzy of buying activity currently as some have claimed. "OTC activity is pretty dead right now."

* CME futures launch correlated with the top by accident, doesn't have enough volume/liquidity to be relevant.

* We're not going to see an ETF for physical BTC anytime soon, need liquid regulated spot markets first. Futures ETF might come but isn't nearly as big of a deal.

* Finex/Tether banking with Noble implicitly confirmed, at least that's my interpretation.

* Phil Potter has bids around 3k.

Literally there is no money to be made right now lol 
Hey guys, I have a question for you, bulls especially.

Do you use crypto to buy any goods or services or is its utility solely limited to investment/speculation to you?
Not a lot to add as we have barely moved since the weekend but to give you a different perspective here is my [Ichi 4H chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/e4ypiSr4/). Last night we had a strong bearish TK cross. I've marked in red horizontal lines previous resistance painted by the lagging span. And support in blue horizontal lines. Would not be surprised for a push to the next two resistance lines but anything beyond that i think is doubtful at this point, based on buyer action for the last two months. Of course, things can always change in a minute. I'm currently hedged short but I'll take a full position if that rejection does happen again, either at 6200 or 6300. And would probably bail after a convincing brake above 6400.

Also something to keep in mind for the dip buyers, looking at [volume profile](https://www.tradingview.com/x/MEQEuI3T/) if that blue line does not hold as support, around 5500, there is a lot of thin air down to 4800. I think those two areas are my long entries, depending how they hold up.

One bullish note to close, look at the volume decline on the daily.



Why is anyone surprised? This is basically the norm now. High volume drop to resistance, followed by a bounce, followed by another drop on increasing volume but less than the first, everyone here thinks the floor is going to drop only for it to start to slow grind up to the 12 day EMA, we stop short of resistance on evaporating volume followed by a high volume dump like the first one
Someone must have figured out a way to game everyone else's algorithms.
[https://www.tradingview.com/x/Tbt4K49T/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Tbt4K49T/)

Help please learned people - can anyone tell me what would explain a chart pattern like this? I'm a newbie to TA and haven't seen anything like it before. 

Is this a bot? If so so why would it be trading in this pattern?

Many thanks in advance.
Nearly a 1/3rd more longs at this point than shorts with longs increasing again.
why is nobody talking about this descending wedge?
I love bitcoin
I’m trying to find a bullish situation here, but I can’t. Longs vs. shorts is now at 32k vs 23k despite the price going down from $6350, alts are still bleeding, and we can’t seem to break any significant resistance. The fact that anything under $6k is getting bought up quickly is reassuring. However, with the long/short ratio looking surprisingly overbought, this could easily shape up to be a fakeout.

My only hope here is that BTC is being shorted to cash in on cheap BTC before the June 29 futures close on Bitmex, but the long/short ratio still concerns me there.

I am now running into the same issue I’m sure many others are - scared to short this low, but not willing to buy more BTC since it’s almost sure to eventually drop further from here. Because of this, it’s looking like a slow bleed down over the next few weeks/months is the most likely scenario if this keeps up. What do you all think?
Rejection down, rejection up. More slowly bleeding it is.
Alright guys, I just bought some BTC. Now if you guys wait a while the price will drop and you will get more BTC for cheap because of me. You’re welcome! 
There's a rumour that Facebook may be buying coinbase.

Don't know how likely this is and what it means for the market.

Short forever nothing bad will happen
Types bitcoin into Google. Clicks news tabs. Notices more layers of FUD is being applied. Closes news tab. Opens coinbase. Buys as much as I can afford for the day of Btc, Eth, and Ltc. Closes coinbase. 

Have a great day folks. Good luck to those brave enough to trade this short term. You got balls of steel. I'd undoubtedly get wrecked short term and that's why I buy, and hold only. Will report back in 1-3 years how I did.
Hey guys, I was thinking. Market cycles are getting stretched out, bubbles are taking longer to inflate and deflate. Bubble events roughly correspond to halvings, with an offset of just under one year. Does this mean that eventually we will reach a point when the bubbles themselves span far enough to reach the next halving, and the bubbles will not pop? Like, eventually will we reach four-year bubbles, and just proceed to the next four+ year bubble from that bubble? 
Put my remaining trading fiat in alts, was waiting for this entry as I still think btc did find the bottom for a while.

I’ll bail out for probably a good loss if it goes below 5750 or so since it would invalidate my idea or double top at 10k.
The last dump was the weakest I have seen these days. Price was under 6k for about 10-15 seconds. Buying power was amazing. There were 300+ Long just closed that moment. It seems the Whales is playing SL hunt again and again.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/xxTkYsU7/

you can pretty much just assume any move that comes after chop is a fakeout.

I don't actually think this is a stop hunt or anything- I think it's people trying to get the best prices they can.

if some dude blows his load selling 1k btc you know he's not gonna have it on the books later, so it's the best time to buy and vice versa


I'm stepping out of my swaps short. I'll be adding it to my September short on upward wicks to improve that entry.

!short XBTUSD close 6100

This isn't a sentiment shift on my part, it's just looking longer-term. 

I have my initial entry (1x hedge) on September already at 6095. I have adds up to 6200 on Sept. We'll see if I get them.

What do people think of CoinGate offering Lightning Network to their Merchants next week?

Who are their biggest merchants? (Think they’re also announcing new ones on Monday)
First quick dip below 6k already this morning. Going to be glued to this today. The bounces are weaker and weaker too....looking like this is going to fall sooner rather than later.
Did anyone see the price hit 6200 dollars. I had a stop loss trigger on kraken for some reason. I was short @6100. Wtf.?

Edit. In the last half hour. 
I'm a holder since November.  Never sold so of course I am down.  Most of my holding is in litecoin.  I have been thinking about selling and taking the loss but buying back into bitcoin for a month.  This way I can secure the loss for taxes.  Then I will decide to stay in bitcoin or go back to litecoin, etc.  I think this plan would work? If I am down this much I feel I should take advantage of it? 
Monero showing unusual counter-trend price movements. 

Edit: Does anybody know why?
Perfect time for a long term entry right now 
Im not liking the way things are looking for shorters. And I’m short currently.
In a bear market you short the bounces. In a bull market you long the dips. 
Very unwise to short this bottom. Better wait for a clearer picture. This is critical times for BTC and nobody freaking knows where it's going short term.
Market also need to rekt people and need sacrifices to move on. So just do as you wish. I'm just telling you, if you're wise then don't take the risk to short this 6 months bottom.

Is that a C&H on the 1 hour chart I see?
Noticing lots of people trying to call this the bottom, when we just set a new low after consolidating a range for 6 months. Was this all an elaborate 6 month stop run just to catch a few coins under 5800 (lol)?  Clearly the long time holders are selling and have been for the last 6 months. Any price over 1200 is relatively new to bitcoin. Bounce is possible, but trend is down. All I am saying is bottom is not in.
I've been sitting out for a while now, but I've just started DCA'ing back into BTC and a few major alts.

Not because of support lines, fib ratios, oscillators or clouds, but because Facebook are lifting the ban on crypto advertisements.

Is it possible that the green uptrend channel should be the end of this crash pattern, maybe even until the end of this year? I would be really bearish on BTC if the price drops below these levels, but it's a long way from here...

Short term bullish scenario would be breaking out of this downtrend channel from 10k, current levels to watch 6400-6500? 
As you probably already know, its always best to view a conflict from multiple perspectives. 

Let's consider a new participant who wants to buy Bitcoin today. They will need to buy at 6-10k. I'm not going to let that new member into the club at 4-5k per BTC, without giving up a major fight.
Looks like we tried to break 6300 over night and dumped after rejection. we're now at what i would consider last 6k defence.

bears are starting to have a stronger case again as 6300 should be a much weaker resistance than it is proving to be.

little volume on the dumps for some bull hopium but keeping a very close eye. Maybe we can have some recovery at London open in a few hours.

Buys got triggered on two small alt trades over night but if we cant hold 6k im probably gonna gtfo

https://www.tradingview.com/x/uBU8ypBZ/

edit: london didnt impress at all. im preparing for the last few days to just be a bear flag. fuck getting caught with my pants round me ankles.
Think we'll see sub 6k today.

The big buy walls that were holding us up have disappeared.

We may bounce up after but I think for now anywhere between 5800-5900

The small bump ups are being sold in to and we end up back down to where we were within 10 mins. 
the longer it stays above 6k i imagine many traders could get the trigger finger to buy
That's what I'm seeing, after accumulation through the year we'll break the upper resistance by early/mid 2019 IF we play like the last bubble.

June discount is gone on mex.  Do futures contracts generally converge with spot toward the end of the contract?  Are there generally any shenanigans upon expiration?  Never held one in that context.
That outbreak was not very convincing so far. 
Question for you all:

How do you guys feel about the complacency in this current bear market surrounding the next 'bubble cycle' ?

Specifically referring to posts like this:

https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8u57ui/what_triggered_the_bull_reversal_of_august_2015/

Its something which strikes me as a key difference between this current cycle and the previous 2014/2015 one,  everyone this time is expecting the return to crazy bullish times where as in late 2014 to 2015 most felt that Bitcoin would be range bound below 1k (Maybe with the exception of the stubborn Bitcoin ideologues).

Its one of those things, when people become complacent with trends/cycles that's when they have a tendency to fail.

I'm not saying that its going to fail this time, the point of what I'm writing is does this complacency with endless bubble cycles scare some of the longer term bulls?
It feels good to trade contrarian (to others and my instincts)

Buy under huge resistance. Buy after the support of a wedge breaks. Buy when it doesnt make any sense to go long. Short when it looks like its ready to break up
Just reminiscing. The Gox bandits dumped 400,000 coins at a time when fewer coins existed and mining was far easier. Didn't shake people out then, the smart ones, anyway. WTF? You think you're going to shake them out now with a few thousand borrowed coins and some snarky comments on Reddit? Come on. Wake me up at $2000. I'll be slightly worried at that point but still not selling.
order books look relatively balanced here at the precipice of sub 6k, something we haven't really seen lately at these price levels. we're drilling down to a new range, slowly.
What if it doesn’t go up for down just stays around 6K for a couple months
For any anyone that was here during the gox crash, I know it was relatively a  long time ago so you may not remember, and I know it was an entirely different market back then, but do you recall people forming a correct consensus of what the bottom was? Everyone now is so sure it is at 4-5k...was something similar happening back then too? 
BFX volume looking like it's been in maintenance for the past 30 mins.
If one were the type of person to just go by gut instinct on this, one could say that Bitcoin is basically just pausing after some seller exhaustion from the previous weeks drop. Indicators will cool off, we'll all take a breath and rest.

One could say that there just aren't enough buyers to drive price up, in fact only just enough to hold our current level.

Then soon, when selling pressure increases again, the tiny buying pressure we currently have will be defeated and the huge drop will begin afresh.

I mean if you're a gut instinct kind of person, you could say that.

P.S... I feel this way  
its make or break NOW
E'rbody was going long yesterday. Now E'rbody is going bearish. Time to go long with 5800 SL
What do people make of us bouncing off the ATH downtrendline  twice? Second one being bgd. 
Currently repeating 6/10-6/16? Expecting this to pop $300, sideways for 3 days, and then dump.
Does anyone have the skills to do statistical textual analysis to compare the sentiment on Reddit in 2018 compared to the 2014-2015 bear market?

I think could indicate when we hit absolute bottom.

Archive.org has a lot of archived content from Bitcoin and to a lesser extent Bitcoin Markets.
Got to admit 6k is strong support which now correlates w/ETH $420 support.
Can capitulation come in the form of selling the year's bottom in an attempt to buy lower? 
I am just going outside, and may be some time.

Alright whales, time to let this go down already -_-
Stop long chasing are made to accumulate cheap. Just saying.
Even at 3k we’d still be up 20% YoY, which is insane returns. Trend is bearish. Indicators are bearish. Sentiment is hopefully bullish. Guess which direction it’ll move next?
Will it ever see a 5 in the price again?  How many more hours or days does it need to stay above 6k for ppl to think its bottomed?
Any experience with localbitcoin/localethereum vendors rejecting a buy trade offer during a dip to hodl/accumulate?

What's the overall sentiment on shitcoins, do you think they all will die during this bear market? Or do you think they will thrive again once the bull starts? 
Wow - just received this in my work email

 Hello xx,

Did you know that Bitcoin 

* Purchases      Are Not Taxed.
* Very      Low Transaction Fees
* Investment      alternative
* Irreversible      Transactions
* No      Paperwork
* Appreciating      Value
* It’s      highly liquid and portable because it’s digitized
* Central      governments can’t take it away **Supply is limited**, Demand is      unlimited.

Why not take a leap into understanding Bitcoins and its future. Many prominent Venture Capitalists have recognized that Block chain assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum will have bigger impact on the human civilization than Internet.

Ikkurty Capital is a fund management company that exclusively invests in a diversified portfolio of Block chain assets.Our fund is structured similar to Warren Buffett's original partnership that was started in 1956.

We bring the long-term, patient investor ethos of Buffett to Block chain assets.

Our goal in launching Ikkurty Capital is to find investments in the crypto-assets space where we can find the 'next bitcoin' that can return 100X on our investments.

Because accumulation. If you think btc will be 1mm someday then it’s all about accumulation.  

Ok sure you turn you non profitable rigs off but then you buy cheap coins until it’s profitable.  This the miners creating the floor. 

Sorry on mobile.

I hope my question doesn't come across as shitposying or trolling
Sorry guys, just sharing my observation in this sub lately... Passed few weeks, bears are all dressed-up, excited and ready to go to their goblin town party. Being rejected at the door several times now does not spoil the fun though - we'll be back. On the other hand, bulls are getting aroused by green dildos, where size does not matter anymore - even 100 USD dildos will do. Now looking at the graph... we barely move up or down...
3D chart: https://imgur.com/a/IwBiQc6
It's funny that none of the TA gurus here seem to be able to see two obvious things: 1) 6K is the bottom, evidenced by the many times it's been tested in the past five months and 2) that big-ass bull pennant if you zoom out to November.

You know what's even funnier than that? Bitcoin will resume its climb (when exactly nobody knows but I think fairly soon) for the same reason Hillary Clinton lost the election: millions of little people who see right through the sock puppetry, FUD and general horseshit that's being thrown at them by the losing side. Go ahead and downvote, shillbots. You know it's true.
Throwing out a contrarian scenario just for kicks, since going down seems "too obvious" at this point given the lack of upward direction and the long/short ratio steadily increasing:
  

Facebook just stepped back from its crypto ad ban and is rumored to be purchasing Coinbase. People know this and are accumulating ahead of the announcement.

Hillary lost the election because she ( and her dnc cronies ) is/are complete shit AND because there are about 50 million americans who are completely devoid of common sense and thus, think trump is actually not a totally inept, compulsively lying conman.

This long squeeze is going to be epic
Box reject multiple times - 6130-6140..

That's it guys - BTC is dead, can't take the first resistance - while there is a huge army ahead
Question what was the volume profile during the lows of 2014?

Also is there a way to track of every 1000 Bitcoins bought how many are stored and not sold for a significant time? There MUST be a number even if it is .1 of 1000 BTC bought are "hodl'd'. There is a strong culture of that in this market.

Longs increasing for Bitcoin is something that is reasonable if those longs don't plan to close for many years and have liquidation < 3000 (and probably FIAT to DCA down even further).

Traders of BTC tend to be so short term focused they don't see the bigger picture (these coins are being horded and not traded... potentially that is I would love to see the data).
So is all this behaviour still correlating with this 6th of the month theorising? I haven't bothered to keep up with it. 
Excuse my ignorance... I’ve been around awhile, but have never heard of “coindays”... site isn’t explaining much either. What is “coindays destroyed” in reference to exactly? 
Looks like someone moved 50,000 BTC from the end of last year... Exchange maintenance?

Haha i feel you.  I literally transferred from cold storage yesterday to start shorting and then transferred it right back. I'm trying so hard to just forget about it but it's hard watching all these guys stack it up by shorting!  Guess im just gonna remain on the sidelines some more, and that probably means btc will be down 9 percent by this time tomorrow. 
You said you sold at $60xx looking to rebuy at 50xx. That's a 15% increase. Right now we're only at a 1% decrease off your sale. We just springboarded off 5950 and we couldn't even crack 6175. 
You held through a 70% correction you can hold through a 5% pump 😁
This... is... BITCOIIIIIIN
Yes, bulls will "win" when the price increases 40% from $1000 to $1400.  

Congratulations.
Ditto. Been looking at that IH&S for quite some time now.
Haven't we learned anything from the last 50 ih&s' that all broke down?
The IH&S meme has been iterated on one or more time frames on every single leg down since 9.9k. This is just another bulltrap until proven otherwise imo. I'm starting to think this pattern arises from how trading bots adapt to dump flushes and extreme oscillator conditions when attempting to establish a new local bottom. 

Edit/TLDR: I got burned on the first IH&S assumed bullish but confirmed bear flag and seen several since with same outcome. Don't get rekt:)
Volume on GDAX has been about 25% of what it used to be,...Feels like I’m the only human trading.

Now that McAfee is out of hospital, a 180 is due any day!

My concern is that the sheer volume of December's *dumb money* retail got smacked so hard that they won't consider putting in fresh fiat until genuine signs of adoption legitimize the space. Word of mouth is bad right now, it's going to take more than a few manipulated green days to heal that

Good to think contrarian at times like these though; what do you think would trigger the communal decision on price discovery if not a specific news catalyst?

The premium is falling. Might be a value pickup.
Rising bearish volume. TDI is showing short plays that have a few days left before any major let up on the momentum. I rarely look at GBTC but I think it's one of those to watch during periods like this. Got a feeling BTC will be just behind. GBTC should have a weekly bounce by the end of next week or the week after (even if just for relief) otherwise it may get even more ugly than BTC if we continue downwards. TDI or Ichi has nothing good to show (maybe weekly TDI short is approaching a take profit point), that's not to say it couldn't just continue in the same direction with no let up...

Another thing to keep track of I haven't been doing so thanks for the comment!

You could actually be right. Never change, Chad.

Come'on Chad you are better than that. Stophunting downto $1300 would be the greatest!


Just got to wait for the conveniently timed optimistic news.
That's actually bad, price is falling without new shorts opening. Meaning that there are more longs to close than shorts. So now we are more likely to get long squeeze instead of short squeeze.
When is Junes future closing?

RemindMe! 1 day. Did anything happen?
Some one posted a graph of eos transfers out of their hot wallet and it synched with every major dump on eth.

Edit: here you go [thanks for helping ruin my summer EOS](https://twitter.com/econoar/status/1012011103339986944)

Obviously this guy is over stating it, a bunch of that was probably otc, but that removes buyers from the market too
This is partly EOS dumping you are seeing.
I've literally posted this like 4 times today 
I see a wedgie channel [https://imgur.com/sNHOjLL](https://imgur.com/sNHOjLL)

The forcasted range for the next days would be about the same as your last blue box anyway.
It’s the 8-11 day consolidation in a certain range then dump.
It's weird you'd use this graph with its moving averages to make the claim that the bottom is in.. look at the MA's which appear to be 30, 100, 200 respectively and then notice how in 2014 we bottomed out at the 200 MA.  

The 200 MA currently sits at ~$2500. 

There's still a lot of room to move down without BTC being "dead".

There will undoubtedly be another uptick before we find the real bottom and those calling for sub $1k BTC are doing so without historic precedent... but thinking the bottom somehow happens here, despite your bones, seems unsubstantiated. 


3K looks reasonable in that chart
To me, that graph makes it look like we’re headed to $3000, which is approximately the same ratio of the 2014 bubble / crash. 
Did it ever occur to you that the price could continue to go down to a point where an irreversible fundamental shift would occur as such that the speculative bubble would truly pop and the magic of empty altcoins will die from people's minds, and thus die in the market as well, and that perhaps BTC and a few chosen ones with actual real world use could continue the road to a mature market after the shakeup? 

BTC could go to \~2000 and still be in an all-time uptrend...stop thinking so binary. 
Because a few people in a BTC trading reddit sub, most of whom are betting on the price going down, is representative of the market as a whole...

I don't think anyone has said BTC is dead, however I suggest you remember way the price was only just a year ago. 
Though I'm an absolute fan of these types of models and analyses, I definitely think more historical data should be incorporated into this kind of modeling, due to the current analysis only consisting of one "hype-cycle", and I think you would be able to derive better predictive analytics from incorporating the previous bubble cycle. 

Despite this, As I initially said, excellent contribution and I hope to see more! :D
You said it was the best predictor variable but what's the determination (r squared)?
I'm more of a holder than a trader but the long/short ratio is making me uncomfortable. 

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BITFINEX:BTCUSDSHORTS

down to 24,500

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BITFINEX:BTCUSDlongs

Up to 32,350 

We were basically even a few days ago, but all these longs opening and shorts closing hasn't put a dent in the price. If this diverges further I will seriously consider opening a hedge short to protect my position.


I don't follow your logic.
And a modest long squeeze is in play.

Your first assumption is correct: 32k longs means 32k BTC. Could be one single order THEORETICALLY. Which of course it is not.
Got it, thank you 2 so much!
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say down
You're cutting off tons of wicks in your charting ... not sure why.

How are you measuring your 0.786 fib retrace?

I'm showing that a 0.786 retrace from the prior low would put price at about $4300 (and likely no earlier than Sept as otherwise price would need to move *below* the log support form ATH which seems unlikely). 

I'm showing the mean/log support at $2500 currently (the line dating from 2015).  By Sept, this historic line will give support at ~$3500.

[Chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/fv3Pwm1z/)
why is the line on trading view off from the line on Bitcoinwisdom. Is tradingview log? https://imgur.com/a/rVmg7cY. Also i think you're bearish if you're calling for 5k.
Similiar idea, I think the $4250 region might be possible

Here's my TA:
 https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/coM1ppXd-BTC-USD-long-term-trend-August-2013-to-September-2018/

Bearish idea, yes for sure. And why not. Prices go up and down. 

I am watching exact the same... exact... 
And the 4975 level is also to mention I guess! Maybe we will bounce off of it a bit and then follow the long term trend line as you mentioned. Then it is 2015 revival 
Shorts closing maybe?

https://datamish.com/d/000000004/btcusd?refresh=20s&orgId=1
Generally accumulation is more market sells than buys and distribution is the opposite. 

I think at least.. Where are you seeing this data? 
> Sorry for a little breakdown

no need to apologize bud, in addition to being a trading sub I think we're also sort of a highly dysfunctional support group. PM me if you need to vent privately 
take a break mate, it will help clear your head and you'll be happy when you come back. the charts sometimes look clearer if you dont look at them for a week or two

losses are a part of this whole thangy

(also set stops below local low and set orders where you'd set your "first" stop at)
Most people are probably in your position,  this is pure gambling at this point. It is one big game of shooting fish in a barrel since january and it is being run by market makers with unlimited funds doing the most messed up fakeouts that money can buy. 
To make money you need to risk more. I have done these stupidities in the past and I don't even want to calculate the lost profits. Your stops should have been under 6k in that case. Mine would be at 5900 but of course this depends on your position.   


PS 500 is nothing, good price if you take a good lesson.  


PPS You never recover losses. Don't think like a gambler. You learn to trade better with better risk management. Stop losses and take profits are key.   


Good luck.

Old news.
It's been known about for a couple of days and played down but I consider it bullish(ish).

Decent for awareness anyway, only trouble is people can leave comments under ads and you really would feel a bit awkward if the first few comments were:

Bitconneeeeeect!

Hey Hey Hey

I lost everything

Scam

Pyramid scheme for losers

.....so let's see.
Shorts increasing - bearish

Longs increasing - bearish
Yeah its a very valid point. I saw someone one twitter the other day commenting on the fact that people are looking at shorts vs longs on an exchange that accounts for 6% of daily volume to indicate what direction will be squeezed. 

Trading is not that easy and you have no way to know who they are or why they are entering the position. 

A 600 btc short could be a hedge for a massive amount of BTC being held for all we know. Assuming its dumb money about to get squeezed is silly. 
From 23 May to 23 June,  shorts on BTC increased almost 50&#37;, going from 22.500 to 30.500.

In that same period, BTC price went down from $8K to $6K, everybody talking about a short squeeze all the while.

So, yeah, it can be a tricky indicator.
heh yep. There's no way to know right now, but when I see all of these long squeeze comments I want to say, well, have you considered the possibility that whales might be opening longs and they might not want to squeeze themselves? 
I don't see the amount of leveraged shorts or longs as either bearish or bullish. This is a gambler's market anyway.

I look at the charts and see a severe downtrend with no signs op stopping. There is nothing bullish to be seen in these charts.
Volume increasing at the end is uncharacteristic for a wedge, ya? although I will watch the upper line for sure. 

While a lot of people see shorts closing and longs opening as bearish, it makes me wonder if it's really retail traders or a strong hand accumulating

Lots of shorts are closing and longs are opening/staying high.

If we go sideways for another week while longs continue to open I can't see it being a good thing - although right now it's hard not to see this as a short term bottom. Testing $6400-6600 seems almost inevitable simply since we are "overdue" for a relief rally and we've now established a higher low + bullish hammer 

But the fact that we are struggling with relatively weak resistance at the low side of our range doesn't exactly inspire confidence
Something that I noticed earlier today using tradingviews [accumulation/ distribution indicator](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/McrYnVVO/) is that it follows the trend with price rises, but decouples with the drops (check out the ETH rise to 1400 and then the bounce to 830).

This implies that accumulation (bullish) is actually going on, now keep in mind this occurs on larger time frames and doesn't reflect what we are seeing with these 8-12 day cycles that have been occuring
Pretty sad when best you can do is $300 bounce off of sub $6K level.

Most likely, this is just a pause for the cause, before heading lower, even if is via $7K.  $4K before $10K is extremely likely.


I think you can see both styles active on gdax.  50 Btc, several hundred Eth, several hundred BCH all appear as walls just outside of current price.  This happens every few seconds on each coin.  I've read others observe this activity stops when bitfinex is down.

Less often, you'll see very large *almost* market buys supplementing that activity.  They aren't single market buys as they may have a few seconds between order matching.  So either separate bots or a single bot with separate triggers.

Perpetual means it never ends you can hold the contract open until the exchange shuts down. When there's a month that's when the contract ends and your position will be closed 
Yeah I also would like to know 
I mean here’s just the honest truth man.... there aren’t any quick bounces coming. It is a good time to begin buying so long as you are on low leverage.

We don’t know how far down it will go but in the cycle of it we are firmly in a bear trend.

So being long is the right choice here but you have to be prepared to wait potentially years. The market is just stagnant generally.

If you want a bounce the price will have to dip into stupidly oversold territory. 5750 could be that but the weakness of the bounce from Sunday implies it might not be.

I’m of the opinion we will see 5k at the least just due to the psychological fencepost aspect. However that is purely a guess/hunch.

What I will also say is that shorting here is just text book stupid. Especially given that a very many of participants here plan to never sell.

EDIT: stuff is happening
> Is it possible for buyers to accumulate while price and volume decrease?

That is pretty much exactly how accumulation looks.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/1NiKiaua/

Can't say volume is decreasing though.
Yes
I actually noticed something really interesting this morning when I was looking at the accumulation/distribution indicator on trading view.

Basically, the indicator follows price rises, but decouples when we are in a downtrend (look at the rise to 20k and 9.9k). Meaning that accumulation is actually going (I'll post a chart later, I'm on my phone currently).

Now this is all on the day chart so the point is moot on the shorter time frames, but it does indicate some upside in the future (could be a few months though)
if it doesn't look like that is what is happening it probably is not what is happening. 
I'm short but rethinking atm. This may actually go up.

Edit: pump also isn't followed through....
the way I see it, there are a ton of shorts opened, but the sell side order books are paper thin

5000 BTC takes this down $500

5000 BTC takes this up $1,900

so if someone starts buying and the shorts start closing, this goes up big time, similar to the last BGD 


First time in a while I'm considering heading off to Coinbase and buying more with fiat.
Longs closing on bitfinex...
That sucks man, sorry to hear that. You think the spike on Kraken was just a big short closing? The covering trades might start to be getting a bit crowded if you know what I mean. 
Young blood placed his stops poorly 
there is, it's usually not in the daily though. I would appreciate it more for sure.

if traditional markets start to turn down I really don't know how well btc is going to hold up given it's already looking very weak and most of its strength appeared during an economic boom
Because the macro economical prospects for Bitcoin are bearish right now. Almost any market in the world is getting bearish, notable exception is US domestic. Global growth is slowing with Europe and EM at the front. China down almost 20% from the top lol. Dollar strength breaking every other asset class. If the dollar is rising, bitcoin is likely going to fall. It really is that simple. It's not a coincidence that the crypto market topped in early January and many other markets topped there as well.  
I'd love to see more of that.  Though I think one problem those discussions have is that no one's got a good footing on how cryptocurrencies will behave in that situation.   The two point I always hear brought up are 1) crypto isn't tied to a specific country, so should provide relative stability (hah) during an international trade war or even a global recession; and 2) crypto is a highly volatile asset, which people will flee from during uncertainty. 

While it'd really wreck my other investments to find out, I think riding through another 2008 (or even a 70s style oil crisis) is the only way to gather enough datapoints to know which of those ideas is right.   Even then, it'll probably depend on what crypto is itself doing at the time, since that'll frame things in peoples minds to some degree, and become self re-enforcing. 
I think there is a net bias against fundamentals, which is probably fairly justified, because barring some substantial subject matter expertise, those kinds of discussions easily border on low substance moonkiddery.
Does it need to be said?

If everyone knows the argument front to back; what of it? The rainbow charts are posted every once in a while, and I think that covers it.
It generally gets downvoted into oblivion, trust me I've tried lol
I WANT TO BELIEVE
Yep many alts are down 90-95%.  That’s an easy 10-20x right there if they ever reach ATH again, which is very likely if btc reaches ATH again.  Bear markets have good qualities too, they give you a chance to go back in time and ride the Ferris wheel up again, as long as you have the balls to keep investing.
That's a little more than mildly interesting. I had a feeling those people saying OTC activity was high were just making shit up lol

is this still on their stream? I want to go listen so I'm not doing the exact same thing I'm criticizing 
Accident my ass.  Even if it doesn’t have enough volume it still made retail investors buy the rumor hardcore before the sell the news dump of futures arriving.
Sounded to me as if he was actively shorting. If that is a correct  assessment I would take his words with a pinch of salt. Also, even if the news about Potter leaving was announced this week, it's not really news. It was already known since at least the middle of May that he was phasing out of the company:  [https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/breaking-key-bitfinex-executive-expected-phase/](https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/breaking-key-bitfinex-executive-expected-phase/)

Bitfinex does not have the position in the crypto world as it once had and I assume he felt it was time to leave a loosing team (another reason perhaps to be  somewhat careful about his comments).

Where can I listen to this?
Bids at 3k my ass. Did he show any proof? If he's saying 3k then it will never get that low.  4.5k seems well below the global average for cost of mining.  I'm sure the miners could mine at a loss for a while but I doubt they would tolerate it for an extended period. 
Whoa what was this? What's PGP?
Been mentioned a few times in this sub today, scroll on brotha, scroll on
Any rumor to make this reverse I guess. People are desperate.
Well, next week we'll see some fireworks.
There is plenty of money to be made the last few weeks if you are short.   It just still isn't easy.  I have a major short bias and still managed to screw up some trades.

But there plenty of people, plenty smarter than me, who are cleaning up.
Dude you're crazy, these bounces are becoming much more predictable (I'd post the pattern but I've already said it like 4 times today so just go through my history)

Edit: nvm, yes it is super hard to make money in this market, OH THE PLIGHT OF THE COMMON MAN!
Store of wealth disconnected from the wider financial system.

I spend my crypto only when I must, otherwise you can go fuck yourself you're not having my cryptos.
Both. I used it to buy a VPN subscription, gold and jewelry, and I have a prepaid debit that I load with btc for everyday shopping if I can't spend it directly. But my main reason is what the other guys said, independent store of value. 
Myself and many other devs get paid in $-denominated crypto. Spend it here & there via crypto debit cards [though I prefer to deplete fiat savings/income instead]. And yes, certain items & transfers I conduct direct with crypto. I use stablecoin DAI in certain cases where stability is sought.


Yes, I'll use Bitcoin online whenever possible, unless the outlook is bullish 
I find it easier to buy services anonymously from companies in foreign countries with bitcoin.
I have been using bitcoin to occasionally buy stuff from crypto-minded friends, rent rooms as a tourist (cryptocribs), as well as buy/sell stuff online (OpenBazaar etc.)... regardless of bull or bear market.
bitrefill can buy/pay phone bill for yourself or family almost in any country . 
Whenever I can, which isn't often unfortunately.  
Anyone who supports this technology should use it as much as possible so adoption spreads, if you're just hoarding you're part of the problem in this space
yes, been using it on DNMs for few years, even before started trading
Nice- I like your chart and analysis
\>One bullish note to close, look at the volume decline on the daily.

Same thing happens during every drop. Volume declines, people think sellers are out of steam then boom one large drop.
Shaking the trees 
Cause algorithms don't work well in a bear market. 
Simple answer is it's no pattern and mostly noise - stop using the 5 minute chart.
Yes, as the others have said, don't try to trade off a 5 min chart. And we are in a descending channel-bear market. And those indicators are worthless off that chart.
Thanks all - just wondering what would cause a pattern whereby the volume looks so symmetrical and produces 24 green bars in a row without an overall significant price movement.

Would this fit with a pattern of bot-driven accumulation?
They haven't been telling yet other than showing how many people are about to get stopped

I love bitcoin
Wait no I hate bitcoin
> the long/short ratio

I think you shouldn't place such a high premium on this data point. As you may know, many people "long" on BFX with no leverage so it's difficult to really know if it's lopsided or not. 
My main bullish perspective is that this is the third time Bitcoin has knocked on $6k's door in 6 months without breaking it. And six months is a long ass time in crypto. The downtrend appears to be slowing and volume is dropping. If bull volume picks up for whatever reason, it will return to bull mode, because there just aren't that many sellers left. 
Eth might be in the process of bottoming, with a higher low on the broader picture, and lots of shorts still open, which could drag btc up.

Btc still has to play a 1D rsi bull div, and they can take time to play out.

Also I have yet to see a 1d pin bar candle not being a sign of some green on low rsi. 

Not saying this is a reversal, but 6.7 wouldn't be too surprising.
I have nearly the same mindset atm. In addition, RSIs are reset on all timeframes now. My plan here is to hedge short on the sept futs, since the negative premium is in a tolerable area for me. Will naked short if we get another bounce upwards (around 6.2-6.3k area) and bail probably around 6.5k (only on the naked short, hedge short i will close manually if things start to look like a real recovery).
How does the bitmex futures close incentivize shorting here? Thanks in advance
I don't know how to feel about Coinface
I don't want that. It would be alright for crypto but fuck Facebook. 

Buying coinbase would mean Facebook would own one of the big gateways to crypto. And it would have access to how much money in crypto and bank accounts each user has. That's too much data for a single company.
theres no way coinbase would sell out to Facebook 
Coinbase know how much they can get big.

If facebook buy Coinbase it will be at a very high price.
can you imagine facebook having all that extra data
the Winklevii twins will probably explode if this ends up being true
I think it's more of a case people are leaving FB in droves and they need to revenue, so allowing ads back into the fold.
Would be bullish af
Those fat longs are a gift for shorters... they make any bounce a futility.
I love salty snacks.
Im short rn but I wouldn’t be surprised if we have a break out 🤦🏽‍♂️
LTC?! It is mind bugling how someone can buy Coin that was publicly dumped on the noobs by its creator and leader during ATH...

Would you buy FB stock if Mark sold all his shares and remains CEO?

Would you buy Apple if Tim Cook sold all his shares and remains CEO?
i haven't been trading the last month or so. It's felt nearly impossible for me, so i've been mostly buying on the large local bottoms.
Would be curious to see what you do with we hit 3000

Trade bitcoin short-term ,10% fall, quit.

 trade bitcoin long term ,30% fall, quit

 ok this time I'm really trading long term ,50% fall ,quit
that wouldn't be considered a bubble- that would just be normal growth. I mean, depending on how fast it is. Another 2000% increase in a year? Probably a bubble 
Is there any proof that a halvening is guaranteed to result in a bubble? It’s happened like, what, once? Maybe twice? That isn’t a pattern. If it happens again then maybe I’ll believe it.
Which alts? feel free to respond on the alts thread
Whales? Its probably bfx doing it themselves.  Think it's a coincidence their bfxdata.com stopped working in April?

I'm wondering if this thing bottoms out when Tether pushes past BCH and EOS.
Krakens shenanigans got me liquidated twice, fuck that trash exchange
I saw the price hit that on kraken. That really sucks bro. I will say that I've noticed kraken trading usually like $20-$30 above binance when the price is moving and I try to set up my stop losses accordingly. 

You got fucked though =/
yes, went to 6223. 1
dem kraken wicks boy, they are famous. look on any pair in the last year you'll see nutty wicks like that because super low liquidity.  idk seems like liquidity is actually getting a little better on kraken lately but its still nothing compared to finex. 
Maybe the market did you a big favor. Be grateful.
Not professional tax advice, but it's my understanding that in the US you can wash trade crypto as they are not securities.
I think you should leave your money in litecoin. I don't think anything has fundamentally changed about litecoin that warrants you putting it somewhere else. When litecoin fell through it's support at .015 I think that's where you should of sold based on TA.

 Also litecoin is up 5% on the day so there's that. 
hate to break it to you, but if you sell for a loss a buy a like-kind asset you don't get to claim it (in most countries)
I am not a tax or law pro, but I did a ton of googling. Bitcoin is property in the US, wash sales only apply to stocks and securities. With that being said, I'd sell and give it some time before buying back in rather than just selling and immediately buying back into the same crypto. I tethered awhile back and got in recently a bit lower for more value. Google and do what you think is best. Also, I am of the opinion that like-kind trades don't apply. When I filed my taxes in April I took every trade hit and owed money on something I never turned to fiat. 2018 definitely does not allow like kind trades from what I've read.
Seems dumb to trade to bitcoin when litecoin is at its lowest ratio in a while. 
Short answer: It's not a shitcoin and it was oversold.   
   
Long answer: I have a theory which so far has been working pretty well for me. I generally divide altcoins into hype-driven and fundamentals-driven (to some extent, let's say).   
   
Hype-driven coins are everything you'll generally find shilled on the front page of r/cryptocurrency and on youtube, and their subs are usually filled with links to tweets, announcements, price discussion and other fomo-inducing fluff. They mainly attract noobs and lambo kids who buy into the hype without DYOR. Significan part of business efforts of those coins goes into marketing and social media. They are quite easy to identify.   
   
Fundamentals-driven coins on the other hand are the mostly quiet ones with real tech behind them and community focused on actual development of the tech. This is were Monero, among (very) few others belongs.
   
Now when the market goes down, the investors of the hype coins see it as a threat and panic sell causing a massive drop, which doesn't recover until the hype builds up again (or doesn't, and the shitcoin slowly dies). The investors of the coins from the latter category see a drop as an opportunity and so they accumulate, usually resulting in a rebound as soon as the market appears to have stabilised.
ETH ratio reversed as well, for now, for about 1%
Check my comment on the same topic in today's Altcoins Discussion.
Well... it's very subjective, but I think there might be less "shorting interest" in XMR. There are less exchanges where you can short it and there was arguably less hype on the way up too (I mean, people completely new to crypto are less likely to be holding Monero than Bitcoin, specially at this point).

I might be the exception, but I still hold some Bitcoin and some Monero and, at least at these prices, I would be more likely to sell some Bitcoin than Monero if things start getting ugly again. That being said though, I am actually slowly accumulating both right now and I have more faith in Bitcoin long term. My XMR holdings are just a small fraction of my portfolio and it is all money I can live without.
Unless it's not
Give me 3 ~~good~~ reasons why
Yes pleas add to the 32.5K longs. More profit for my short 
I wouldn't really be too concerned until >6250. 

edit: and I'm not looking to exit until >6300 at the earliest. Probably >$6400. 
Just set a stop loss at $6430

If it hits that you knows it’s reversing 
hold strong lil buddy, goblin town awaits
all eyes on this: https://i.imgur.com/cIqQbtB.png
Longs are going to get rekt here IMO. Over 32k, most underwater, longs opening and shorts closing in this range and the price isn't moving up. I just don't see them giving people this long to buy the bottom. I don't see us getting over 6400 and I think it will be somewhere between 5.5k-5k before we see a bounce with a shot at continuation. 
lulz
i see a bear flag forming the handle of what could be called an inverse cup and handle?
Serious question, have you ever seen a cup and handle work in crypto
No that is an EKG pattern on the 1m. Code name look out below, street level Goblin Town.

  
Effervescent populace. Don't ask me to explain just short it then go long at the previous all time high.
Why would long time holders sell at this price? Why don't people consider that noobs are scared shitless for their first bear market?
I doubt that this will have any impact on the price.
Hopefully, the news is spreading to jumpstart this market. Seems many Alts are near or below their ICO price....
We basically followed the breakout ATH downtrend in 2013-14 and bounced off of it as support which was the bottom IIRC. Can't chart it out ATM but I'm fairly sure we're following 2013 very closely. If we fall underneath that line we may be in for a lot of trouble.
When Bitcoin's price has you up all night.

Blood in the streets, no end in sight

&nbsp;

Remember, the log trend is your friend.

The Bear market will soon come to an end
> sliding support

Is that the technical term for this? I have noticed (and capitalized) on this phenomenon, but I can't seem to find it in literature.

FWIW, I think we can expect some type of symmetry time wise. Roughly 6 months to break it going up, another 6 months to bounce off of it at the bottom.

I'm probably going to have to sell my mining equipment if we get that low. =|
You don't really have a say in the matter.
Build that buy wall :)
These walls just come and go. Would not focus too much on this.
We couldn't be more stable. What walls are you talking about: https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/books/USD
I agree with the sentiment of under 6k by close of play today. My dingle is tingling and something just feels a bit off to me with this recent action.
We'll see. I do talk a lot of shit so 
already are. 32k longs vs 23k shorts !!! longs adding, right under resistance. what could go wrong
the longer we sit where are the more likely to me we'll see a big move down again. 


That's exactly what all the sellers are waiting for.
Yea, apparently there are some spikes as people attempt to close their orders before expiration but in general it converges to spot near expiry.

A strategy to make virtually risk free profit is to long/short futures when they're at a discount/premium and hedge it by selling/buying spot, then waiting until expiry for prices to converge and make the difference in profit. This is called a cash and carry trade

Since the crypto market is largely nascent and inefficient, this is usually very profitable despite being so "obvious" 

Credits to https://Twitter.com/AureliusBTC for explaining this a few days ago
Futures always converge to spot because it settles at spot prices
idk it gave me aids
> does this complacency with endless bubble cycles this time around scare some of the longer term bulls?

No. Because I think this bubble cycle will look pretty textbook compared to the previous ones once it's played out. 

And until some sort of saturation or failure happens, they're all going to look broadly similar. It's little to do with Bitcoin itself and everything to do with human behaviour and that never changes. 

Supply doesn't change. Excitement and the numbers piling in certainly does, both on the up and the down. That equals bubble cycles until a plateau of some sort has been reached, and even then smaller ones will continue. 
I did this for a while but moved over to trading on indicators instead (volume, macd, stoch rsi). While it felt great to hit the bottom/top with a good entry, it just wasn't profitable enough in the long run. Too often I got chopped up when the market hesitated then continued. It also felt a lot harder holding onto a position hoping it would turn more profitable when the entry was more gutsy to begin with.
So you bought at 9990 in April? Nice strategy.
[deleted]
The only thing I'm worried about is to have enough available money to buy like crazy if we go that low.
> Didn't shake people out then

Most people lost their shirt
Last fall ETH stood still @ $300 accumulting for several months while BTC mooned, which is why I believe that to be unbreakable support. No TA, it just ranged within $10 either side. The Ratio was in the 0.02+ range....
https://www.tradingview.com/x/MpF158he/

if open interest keeps increasing we'll likely see a huge move at some point due to one side getting squeezed
Bitcoin is driven entirely by speculation. If price remains stable for too long, it will drive away traders. The traders cashing out will lead to price dropping. Price dropping will lead to volatility. Volatility will bring the traders back. 
You can go look at the dailies back then. in general about 1/3 of people were bearish and skeptical of any movement upwards. 2/3 were eternally optimistic and bullish, continually being let down after every rally turned around 
For a long, long time the rough consensus was that BTC never, ever went below the last ATH (which in this case was ~$266). That, of course, was true until it wasn't. After $266 broke, all bets were off and anything between $0 and $266 was fair game (with sub-$200, sub-$100, and even $10 being somewhat popular at times).
I remember I got into a 'whatever' mood right when bottom was in and bought a whole coin for €199. Should've bought ten instead...
I recall new consensus bottoms being argued for every hundred bucks right down to the bearwhale showing us nothing could actually break $200. What we need now is a good bearwhale sacrifice to paint the bottom in blood. Nothing less will satisfy the old gods. 
You can go check previous bitcoinmarkets threads from then. I think that will be the best way if you want to compare the two periods.
There were some people, like me, who identified the bottom after it was formed.  I also thought we were near or at the bottom the day before.

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=671764.60

I'm more into 3k.  When the people who think 5k is the bottom are proven wrong, and then the people who think 4k are wrong... we're in for serious pain (1k is even possible).

First, $800 was cheap coins.  We had just hit $1200, so of course things were different now that we hit the $1k milestone.  The world was about to change.

Then, $600 was super cheap coins.  Omgz, I'm buying. 

Then we hit $500, $400.  And there were a few oh shit moments.

Then $200 came, and true dispair along with it.  This thing may actually go back to sub $100.  Fear was at a high.  Much of the volume dried up.

Then, the halvening came, hope was restored, and the bulls started running.
deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.9575  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/06199)
There was no consensus that the bottom was in.  In fact, many if not most of the people thought bitcoin was never going to recover.  That's why you know the bottom is not in right now.  Waaay too much optimism.  For the people thinking they've seen despair........nope not yet.
Not that I recall. By the time the actual bottom hit everyone was too fucking gloomy or long gone to remark on it. Everything slowly bled away until there were no more predictions. 

I don't remember $160 being mentioned when people could still be arsed, and if anyone had, their eyes would've been scratched out. 
There was never a consensus and there won't be one now either.  

> Everyone now is so sure 

No, everyone is not so sure...not even close.  Your fantasy narrative probably isn't doing you any good.
It was like 2 years before the price recovered.
same with this sub
Yep thats exactly what i think, so unless we get some weeks of price stability, imo its suicidal to buy more at this point. We have to wait until nobody wants to sell anything anymore. I doubt this thing will go into rocket mode in the near future, so you dont have to worry about missing the bottom either.
I have no idea what you are talking about.

Do you?
seems to be breaking upwards
why now?
Everyone’s been saying this constantly the past week..... 
!long xbtusd open 6115

(opened long at 6080, but before that I bought spot BTC at 6150 to send it to Bitmex... FML)
log or lin, wicks or bars, which peaks?

I think you need a chart for something that vague on that time scale
We haven't hit it yet. Unless you are giving it a $100 buffer zone. 
I know right!? People are so suprised by this market, but it's literally done the same thing over and over again these past few weeks

Edit: once more people catch on, the strategy will change 

Edit2: people downvoting, how is this different from 6300 or 7500? 
I was around my lowest buy was $199. It was worse IMO. 2014 we had a retrace back to 600-700 dollars then almost a straight drop for 6 months. I think a lot more people questioned if btc was actually a fluke from a pump bot and the mt gox suspension of withdraws. There were not as many big investors in the space either. I remember it was Tim draper...like he was the only VC around. Also start ups were beginning to die in late 14. Seemed like btc was just dying... ecosystem... price... sentiment. There's a lot more hope this time around, and a lot more activity. I think it will be hard to compare based on the amount of people in it now. There's just a lot more people in the space, and talking about the space, and theres a ton of successful alt traders, who really don't care about the btc price anymore. Tether for better or for worse kind of changed that aspect of alt trading. Everyone used to trade strictly in btc gains and losses, now i'd say most people care about exclusively about their USD value.
I may look into it. Sentiment analysis isn't too difficult. The hardest part is scraping the data
Sentiment lags behind price, especially for retail, which Reddit is mostly consisted of
Most of the action in 2014-2015 was on the BitcoinTalk forum. That's where I hung out back then, anyway.

Forgot to say: 

> I think could indicate when we hit absolute bottom.

You don't have to look too hard. We're here now or darn close. I can't believe nobody's accepting that after we've humped on 6K like a college boy on his first fine piece of ass for five months.

I wouldnt be hopefully. The bears are just builing up steam give it a little more time and we will plummet thru 6k easy I belive.
Capitulation will come when bag holders stop talking about capitulation and start talking about it never recovering.  
Those buys aren't there to watch your back. They're there to push you into sell walls...
[deleted]
>When this market moves up it's going to be epic.

I also look forward to the bounce off 3k. In the mean time I will short the break down of this 5 month consolidation pattern.
English please... 
It’s not a huge deal but I wanna point one thing out. Year-to-date is not the same thing as one year ago.
Very true for those who got in @ 3k... what would you do if you bought @ 6k and above?
*Way* too early to be talking about bottoms. Only when we can break 10k, I think we won't see 5k for a long time (if ever again). However, I'm convinced we'll see 4k before we'll see 10k.
No bottom can be trusted unless $11,700 breaks which would confirm the bear market is over. Then you can look back and say "that was the bottom". At this point, no bottom can be trusted and there is no telling how long we will be in the downtrend. We could be at 6k for another month and then make new lows, time is not really important, price is. 
A month. If we are above 6k by the end of the July I'll start to buy in. And if we start reversing, like break 8k, I'll start to enter a low leverage position on Sept/Dec contracts.
6135 <----
Are you using it as an options contract? Cause everyone I know using those platforms hates that =\

[deleted]
Some will likely die if we drop further. To really die, we'd need panic selling to the extent that liquidity on the books went to 0, and *no one* would buy. Not many coins will do that. There are likely folks out there that would buy up millions of shitcoins for under a penny just because or just in case. To die, I think project developers would have to walk away, which could happen if the bid side for their token dried up entirely.  
Some/most, but there will still be people making new ones and those will replace the ones you currently see.
Thrive when bull starts. The valid and integral ones with real world benefits will see gains in the thousands of percents. Picking the correct ones is a challenge. 
I just received an email as well...

My Fiat on Margin balance, i long Btc , it counts as long even though its 1x and won't be margin called. I wouldn't count too much on the Long:short metric on Bfx, especially for longs.
My monkey brain struggles to understand this. When more traders think the market will go up rather than down, the market is more likely to down?
I don't expect a short-term market bottom for several more months.  However, doesn't really matter and smarter to trade the market in front of you and not one in the distant future.  
Lack of volume is what goblin town means

Usually when you trade properly you don’t need to try and convince yourself or others. Nor does “FUD” have any effect on the market.

Dow Theory states that the market is efficient and all news will be taken into account and reflected on the price.

If you know how to how use TA, either you buy / sell or hold.


>6k is the bottom



Okay but we went under 6k just a couple days ago
Enjoy the longs squeeze.
the new "ripple is rumored to be added to coinbase"
It's a rumor. There is no factual basis to this whatsoever.
What would fb gain by buying coinbase?
Facebook purchasing Coinbase? jfc
This is why McAfee called for Bitcoin at 15k next month. I think he may have inside infos. Remember that he knew the date of the meeting between Trump and Kim before it was public.

Why would he risk his reputation making such a call if he had not some solid elements to back his claims ?
I thought FB was working on their own coin together with Coinbase back in May...
You just cut candle bodies *and* wicks for no reason except to make it a steeper wedge. What are you doing, man?
Bruh cutting wicks is one thing; cutting random candle bodies is a whole 'nother thing. In addition to cutting other candles, you literally ignored a whole day.
The fact that you took the time to write this makes me quite bearish on your overall happiness. I would definetly short this if I could.
I use multiple subs but this one takes the cake for actually being a sub with good analysis and trade talk. Other subs are only memes and moon crying. So I'm not sure where you get this false idea that this sub is a good counter trading sub but whatever. You do you.
I wouldn’t long or short anything here. 
IMO No. The LTC/BTC just took a beating so it might go up now
If you lost money hodling you're going  to lose even more trading. Take a break and/or quit bitcoin tbh, you will have to work very hard to make that money back by trading 
IMO, they're all good to short.
Weren't you insecure about your BTC short like 1 hour ago? 

Are you looking for the bottomest coin to short?
I think it is just the largest scale sell the news dump in crypto history.  The buy the rumor was futures coming.  People holding past 20k was like the naive people that sit in an alt after a mainnet launch.

If you have further questions, please to reply to this comment and I'll elucidate if I can!

Edit: grammar
The higher the score, the longer it is since the coins were moved. 

So a day with a large amount of days destroyed means a large number of previously dormant coins are on the move - ie we are all going to DIE. 
Couldn't watch it later live but... Wtf... $100 drop followed by $200 rise. It happens often lately when we try to break support or resistance and momentum just suddenly dries off. It's just like either side has no idea where this is going and people take profits fast.

Me too. I've been trying to ignore it until it's closer to confirmation.
Yea GDAX now vs GDAX end of last year is like a sad amusement park run by robots compared to the bustling heyday. 
You are very welcome and thank you as well.
My outlook, and I must stress this is just one person’s perspective, is as follows. Over the past several months there’s been a rather unique aspect of the trading pattern, what those in this thread refer to as the Bart. Given my professional experience all of this activity is nothing more than attempt by certain parties – and I have no idea which parties – to ascertain where an actual bid-ask spread resides. Trial and error if you will. 

So long as the downward pressure on BTC pricing remains intact my outlook is that we will continue to see the same “Bart” trading patterns. Where it is I am centering attention, however, is on volumes which have improved during the month of June (looking at Bitfinex).  
for a sec I thought he was going to become Bearish_Brad420
Well, my current short is from 6150. From there it's about an even split on R/R (6K from 6300). I don't think shorting under $6100 makes a lot of sense. I also don't think the trend supports a long for anything more than a scalp, but 6080 to 6300 is a pretty good scalp (3.5%). 

I certainly wouldn't begrudge anyone nabbing <$6100 as a long entry, as long as they didn't plan to hold it to a lower low. 
I have some buys down here, honestly I have a feeling the same thing is going to happen what's been happening.

High volume drop followed by a bounce off lower support.

Price starts to slowly decline followed by a steep drop that's sees an increase in volume, but is not as high as the intial drop with the goal of making another swing at lower support

Volume starts tapering off as we hover above support, then we see a slow grind up to/slightly past the 12 day EMA, go sideways till volume evaporites, then another big high volume drop.

Rinse and repeat 
I'm considering it. I already own some in my Roth (which is where I buy a lot of high risk, speculative long term assets), might be a good time to start buying more.
Which downtrend is that? What other instrument has over a 200 percent return over the past 12 months in a "bear market?"

You know, Bitcoin has been around for a while, and this dip since December is nothing new. 
Correct (although I don't think we'll see a long squeeze)
June 30th. I'm not sure at exactly what time. And soon afterwards, the December Futures open. 
In the top left you should see various indicators your using inside your bar charts. One should be Bbands. There's an "x" button at the end.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/1BK0dxWs/

should be at the point of the red arrow (left side)
Holy shit. 
I did't see your posts... but I was pretty sure people picked up on it. 
That last blue box should extend to the red resistance line. Thinking long with just stops at $415.

edit: will probably wait for a retest of $420.
OK Eeeyore, whatever you say.

Seriously though, the bull party is a lot more fun. You have no idea how hard we laugh at all the newbs screaming that 3K is Armageddon is just around the corner. That's just, dare I say it, *delusional* on a couple levels (ie, that 3K is low, that it will go there, etc., plus the fact that you guys have been screaming for Goblin Town since before the big bounce in February.
Also, the consolidation range (blue rectangles) reached the red dotted resistance line (log) each time before dumping.
What is the bottom amount?
MA are on by default, but those calculations can also go fuck themselves, means nothing to me. They are just places where prices slow down and sometimes turn around. Don't miss the train.
right haha like when I look at that all I see is "yea, $3k looks pretty reasonable."
So is 50k
I can definitely see 3k. Depends how long this goes.


I think it is equally likely that we see a panic bottom at around $4.5k in the next month or so and then up from there.


**Edit**: I should also add, I think the bear market from 2014-2016 was the anomaly to the trend, not the trend. Look at all other "bubbles" before that. Big spike, equal consolidation, small sideways, repeat. 2013 bubble was fucked. I don't think circumstances are the same. In fact, we have inflation ticking up with asset bubbles running unmoderated, central banks afraid to get ahead of the inflation because they don't want to cause the burst. And a huge deficit and increasing interest rates. We are fucking with hyperinflation... seriously... yes it is very low probability of happening, but not as low as I suspect most people believe. Just wait until the fear takes hold.
Rounded bottoms are actually pretty rare for Bitcoin.
Not that unrealistic and nothing new, as it went down to ~150 during the last bear market.
In some respects I agree. Only those coins that have real world adoption will survive. That's certainly a key driver for my own speculative investments. There are a tremendous amount of projects that have been about for years but have minimal development or adoption and I suspect when the next upcycle starts we will see a change in which projects populate the top spots. Also with exchanges creating more fiat gateways, easier access to those adopted blockchains will also change which ones become market leaders. 
I don't think that is impossible. I'm just saying the last 6 months of price action cannot be used as justification for that conclusion.

The shorts:longs ratio is currently .76

During the Feb 1st bottom (I forgot to label this one), the ratio was at ~1

During the early April bottom, the ratio got to 1.2

.76 is sort of middle of the road territory. There's not a big opportunity to squeeze a bunch of shorts to drive up the price because the ratio doesn't favor this.

*gasp*
I don't like hitting every wick precisely for very long term trend lines and try to get a rough average.

The 0.786 was not made from the previous low in 2015, I did it from around mid may of 2016 where I think this parabolic movement really started. That gives me a 0.786 of 4750. Again none of this is meant to be super precise or anything. Just a rough estimation of things. If i had moved my log trendline a bit lower then 4750 in mid September is possible too. The idea is that we're not going to 2k and the bottom will be found some time before the end of September and around 5000 dollars very roughly. 
yes it's log. I drew it very roughly. The whole point of it is that we need to break through it before we make our all time low

>I think you're bearish if you're calling for 5k.

I've become a very reluctant and depressed bearofbinance.
Its possible if we keep dumping like this but I do believe we will break through that trendline from the ATH just like in 2014 and make our low at a later point in time, which gives a high low than your chart.
totally possible and the data seems to suggest that played a role
This seems to speak for itself. 

-7K shorts and +2K longs in last few days ending at same price, that's a lot of buying sure, but not exactly accumulating as much as deleveraging.

That could be a sign of sentiment shift toward less bearish, on other hand, that's a lot of short squeeze fuel let out with minimal pain.

Looking back only ~2 weeks ago with similar margin ratios, that's before that big dip from upper $7000's...
Logically speaking, why would we see distribution at 6000$ instead of accumulation. This is the years low, this is where you are supposed to accumulate if you follow the rule of Buy Low Sell High.

I don't get the distribution narrative at 6k when everyone call a 4-5k bottom.


>Generally accumulation is more market sells than buys and distribution is the opposite.

What makes you say that?

https://trading.gear54.me/tradeflow/

edit:  I would think during accumulation (when you're trying to be sneaky and not broadcast your intentions) you want to make market buys to essentially buy up all the limit sell orders that are out there, and when distributing make market sells to take all of the limit buy orders. (The alternative would be to set up limit buy orders and show everyone exactly what you're trying to do, right...?)
I appreciate the kind words :D

I think I will be fine after some break and sleep!
Thanks Sloppy. Good advice as always
Sigh. Who could I blame but myself :) ...

Thanks man :D

How can one make consistent 40~100% profit within an hour? O_O?
It’s funny how one day old news is old news in crypto.
Shorts increasing with no appreciable decrease in price = bullish

Long's increasing with no appreciable increase in price = bearish.

There's not a whole lot of other ways to intepret that. It doesn't mean the move is guaranteed, but it assures if the move happens it will be sharp.
I think for this to be a clean wedge it should have a 3rd touch on the support trend, ideally with lower volume. By my estimation this would be around 5500-5600. But it could hit resistance and then bounce off 5800 again and I would still think that is a decent wedge, with 5 clean trendline interactions. My default plan right now is to just scale in short from 6300-6800. But I am looking for a potential long scalp too if there is a good setup.
I'm not too familiar with that indicator, but I did just read a little bit about it and I checked on the weekly timeframe the 2014 btc bear market. The indicator went up as the price went down but it was not a signal for a reversal. Eventually the indicator started trending down with the price and then after the bottom it went flat with the price during the accumulation period: https://imgur.com/a/s4bQPz6

Todays bear market shows the indicator was flat while the price was trending down and now it looks like now the indicator has started to trend down with the price: https://imgur.com/a/p6mv2Qa

This is just my initial impression of the indicator, but I think comparisons to 2014 would be important. If you notice anything else interesting I would love to know about it.
Seriously the price made a new low since the peak of this bubble and the bounce was smaller than any of the prior bounces since this started in January.  To delude yourself into thinking there will be a recovery is a mentality I can't even comprehend.  There's zero excitement in crypto anymore and the data backs that up.  Additionally most media coverage as of late is negative while the SEC expands investigations into various parts of the crytpo community.  

Trend is your friend, short bounces, sell dips.  So many people having a hard time reversing their trading style despite abundant evidence this is a bear market.  By the time they realize it and adjust it'll turn bull again.
they were never as tight as they were now though, were they? 

Volatility now isn't that much lower than last year and spreads of 2-3% were very common 
Looks sufficiently powdered from here.
I wish m8.


>Perpetual means it never ends you can hold the contract open until the exchange shuts down.

How is that any different from going long on spot where you can hold your coins for as long as you want and margin trading where you can hold your position as long as you want too?


>When there's a month that's when the contract ends and your position will be closed

Is it a glorified limit order that sets the closing date to the end of the month?
What? Almost 10k more longs open. 6k shorts closed the past days. 
except you need a motivator to buy 1900 above this price, and we have no interest (apparently) to even drive it up to 6300, let alone 8k. You have to include the qualitative aspect. 
I think it was just a combo of extremely low liquidity and an over reaction to the bounce off 6k. 

I still see us going down relatively soon, but I’m not willing to short this low to the 6k support. Ideally I’ll be looking for a $200 LGD to fill some shorts between $6275-$6375, but not sure we will get it.
Not really.

Wanted to make some type of profit where fees wouldn’t completely destroy any chance of profit.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring

> Anchoring or focalism is a cognitive bias that describes the tendency for an individual to rely too heavily on an initial piece of information offered (known as the "anchor") when making decisions.

You're anchoring yourself to peak bubble prices which may well never be reached again for many altcoins. If you are going to invest for the long term its better to have a solid basis on why you will rather than looking at the past heights and thinking that a return to them is a sure thing.
There's a somewhat realistic chance that bitcoin will reach a new ATH at some point in the future. For most alts however, that's nothing but wishful thinking in my opinion. I see a lot of bagholders (in the true sense of the word) coming out of this market.
The problem with alts is that it takes almost zero effort to create one. If you look at price of any alt historically vs. bitcoin, they always eventually head south.

"But xxx has better tech/team than BTC!". No, it doesn't.

There will always be a new generation of alts to take your money.
No one "made" retail investors buy...it was a self feeding hype frenzy
Sure. It's also possible Gox initiated the dumping, or many different reasons contributed to it, or none at all and it was just a perfectly natural blow-off top. We don't know.
>  leave a loosing team

I suspect some big company may be making a bid for BFX and he doesn't want to sell out
Bids can be pulled at any time, why do you think a proof would mean anything? Cost of mining doesn't constitute a price floor, this myth has been debunked over and over again.
It's not rocket science. You turn it off when it isn't profitable.
You make it sound like just because you start a mining operation, you are going to be successful, forever. People will go broke.

Pretty Good Privacy :)
remember when Amazon was gonna add Litecoin?  same type of rumor in my opinion. And Facebook has a pretty bad rep now with the privacy issues.  I don't see why Coinbase would want to sell out when they have built such a huge business that will do unbelievably well when the next bull run takes effect.  who wants to make Mark Zuckerberg richer
Ah. You're right. 

I'm not totally sure what the angle would be if this was anywhere near fact. 

If Facebook wants a plug n play banking on ramp for their own coin they must have the muscle to make it happen by themselves or there are better payment processors going cheaper. 

If they want to go existing crypto then it makes sense, but them going crypto seems a little out of kilter. I guess selling user financial data would be even more valuable and crypto certainly serves up plenty of that. 

Or Zuckerberg just wants to really, really piss off the Winkies. 
i would think this would have the complete opposite effect, driving people to sell out of coinbase as soon as possible
I would file that under investment. I was more curious about if people are actually spending them.
Your user name explains btc investing in the simplest way. 
Using crypto debit cards just falls in the investment/speculative use. You are not contributing to adoption, since when you pay with the credit card the merchant gets fiat. So ultimately you are just buying and selling crypto for fiat. Also you pay higher fees than using an exchange yourself to convert crypto to fiat and send it to your bank account. 
How is openbazaar now?
Thanks!
Actually we usually see two drops, the first being a high volume drop to the next resistance level, and a second drop on increasing volume (but less than the first drop) to test resistance again and make everyone think "this is it" only for it to Bart slowly back up followed by a drop similar to the first one 
Yup
agree, zoom out. like, waaaay out.

Id make my indicators smaller too. Price action > indicators imo
Yes, some bot shenanagins going on, there has been some wash trading now and then also seen on GDAX, dunno about other exchanges.
if it breaks out as a wedge your long will be very profitable
here you go [https://imgur.com/a/wCaEC2C](https://imgur.com/a/wCaEC2C)
Yeah, a long of 1 dollar and no leverage can equal a short of $100,000 at 2x leverage. It's not really a fair comparison. 
[deleted]
That’s my thought as well. I was considering a hedge short with possibly increasing to a low leverage short if we form a lower low. I figure at worst I can protect my profits.
Honestly, this is more of just a pet theory of mine, but the last bottom was around March 29. I believe Bitmex U futures are every 3 months? It’s possible big players could have placed large short orders around $10k in May and suppressed the price on perps until close of the contracts, at which they can buy back at a significant discount without paying funding fees. Again, this is just something I’m tracking as a _potential_ bullish scenario, since I don’t see much else here.
You mean Facebase?
Coinbase would lose the users that care but gain a lot more that don't.
Everything is for sale at the right price. Everyone said Carnegie would never sell US Steel till JP Morgan bought it and made Carnegie the richest man in the world. 

This just has trainwreck all over it.

I’m sure you’ll be fine we’re only 70% down from ath
Charlie Lee did say it could go back to $20.....so maybe he's super prescient.
Not trying to defend buying LTC here, but you are comparing centralized companies to a crypto that is supposed to be decentralized. Apples and oranges. 
Zucker dumped fuckloads of facebook right before the privacy scandal.
LTC is not a Security, LTC foundation is a non profit organization. If Charlie is holding LTC it’s a conflict of interest. He’s right now devoting his life for LTC without holding any unlike your friend Roger who literally said inside manipulation is ok. 
I mean, that doesn't mean it can't go up in the future, even big-time.
But it will be a 2000% increase followed by another 2000% increase, theoretically speaking. So a bubble that does not fully deflate. So it might be considered normal growth, but it will be explosive normal growth, if you want to split that hair.
We've had 2 halvings and 5 bubbles.
The halvings aren't directly causative of bubbles, but the correlation is strong enough to earn serious consideration: every halvening we've had so far has seen a bubble follow soon after. Theoretically, it isn't crazy talk to suppose that a reduction in rate of new coins by half might encourage the price to move up.

Bought golem for the first time, seems like there’s a lot of buying interest for some reason. Heavy on omg, also some waves. 

My apologies to our mods! 
It's not their site.
Probably, but bfx is a kind o Whales too. Mother of manipulation market.
yea my tradingview alarm went off on that. and it was the old alarm i used to use that gave me ptsd when i lost a shit ton of money back on my losing streak before i started getting the tops. i now realize i will forever hate that sound and it will always give me awful, awful feelings.

I heard it and it just...it reminded me of waking up to losing money. that's all. :'(

anyway yea it's interesting that we can't seem to rally here. there is really not a whole lot of resistance overhead it's just the buying pressure above the bottom is abysmal. kinda like it's been for the past 7 weeks

i was worried about waking up to $6400+ but now idk how much I need to worry.

now im gonna get fucked watch. oh well now im relaly gonna try to sleep
It means people are not in agreement on where the price is going to go. that's it really. I really just think it's mainly what I said at the end- best  time to buy/sell is after the people opposite you blow their load.

the market will eventually make it's way wiht a sense of purpose, but I think this stuff is sort of noise now
/u/justanotherlogin -- any reason on the website my position from 6060 to 6050 is showing a negative p&l?

Doesn't really matter, it was a wash, but it should have been a tiny positive wash. More just a question on how P&L is calculated. 
!long XBTM18 6084 5x 10%
it's not krakens fault that they have relatively low liquidity. 
~~old man yelling at bitcoin~~ trader yelling at volatility
That's $90 above the BFX high..
the stop loss would've gotten triggered either way if we're going up from here- but if we do end up going down, he got stopped out.

so not really :P
That's what I am thinking.  I will leave it in fiat first and see how things go.  If I need to come back in before 30 days I will get bitcoin.

I see 2 options.  I can hold the loss for a few years or whatever until it goes back up.  When I do sell I pay taxes on the gains.

Other option is  take the loss now and hopefully jump back in when it's right. I wouldn't expect it to moon too fast and any mooning will offset from my tax credits.  I have full faith in crypto though.  And hate to be out.
That's mostly just in the USA and Australia man. European countries have no such rule and much lower taxes on capital gains than the USA.
I am in USA.  I tried researching and don't think it's a like kind.  Basically IRS hasn't clarified.  Anyone know? 
Exactly. I think it's dumb to not take advantage of this if I can.  If you have a $3,000 loss and zero gains for the year, why not? In this market it doesn't hurt.  In November, yeah, but now it sounds like a good move as long as you play it right.

Of course after I sold the price mooned a little ten minutes later (you're welcome)  lol
The ratio is in freefall...
So why is NEM which has the best tech and fundamentals (yes, even when compared to ETH) in the entire crypto space with 0 hype always in the shitter? It should be at least top 5 MC wise.
1. HODL

2. Buy high sell low

3. Rekt
Everyone though a short squeeze was going to happen when Shorts were going parabolic. Now everyone thinks a long squeeze will happen because longs are going parabolic.

My guess is that so many people rely on these indicators that they are easy to manipulate. 

It could easily have been big players shorting the market last months. But now they see that there are no sellers and only buyers below 6k$. So they closed shorts and increase longs.

This market would be too easy if everyone would win and right now most people here thinks were going to the 5k range. This makes me think we won't.

Rant over.
Well to be fair he did not imply a long term entry on margin ;-D.
 *Braveheart*  talk!!!
this is probably the right answer. Longs opening with no movement whatsoever, shorts closing.  
Bad stuff in the making.

Who do you think opens 2k longs in a day.

Bunch of noob noobs?
idk, why dont you ask yruafraid? If he was being serious, that is. I imagine it's because a new low = bear market for lots of people. They didn't want to cash out too early but hitting a new low is a pretty clear signal that the market is bearish and will likely continue its journey down.

Because their faith the price will return has left, or they're confident they can buy back in lower.
Because they are rich, this is a good price for them, and the price is trending down. Anything over 1200 is a relatively new and unexplored price for bitcoin (well 6200-10K has now been explored). Of course, volume is so low right now that there is simply not the liquidity for many to exit. They will sell at this price, at lower prices, and at higher prices. Some will keep selling until they get bought out or until the price starts moving upwards.  Scared noobs is also a factor.. lots of them bought at 8k and will sell for a loss, but scared noobs did not sell it down from 10k to where we are now.
How about you sell so I can buy at lower prices. :)
Advertising works. 

We need new money entering to fuel a reversal / bull run, advertising is how new money gets interested in crypto.

Oh contraire my good friend, contraire.
Yep they do when they are being spoofed.

But the last 48 hours have been different to the usual ones.

The buy walls were being topped up back over 1k every time they were being sold in to.

Now they have just disappeared.

Someone wanted 6k to be the bottom but the selling pressure is too much right now. 
Well firstly the link you have provided is to live walls.

The ones that I was talking about were there over the past 48 hours that allowed the market to slowly bleed down.

They have disappeared hence they won't show up in your link.
Well... It's nice to be confident 5800 will break this time when those longs close.
Where’s resistance, 6250... or 6150ish? These Whales over on Gdax are unloading their coins very slowly so as not to further crash the market. I’m not sure they want it to hit resistance which would defeat their purpose w/ a BRD. Of course, there’s a buyer for every seller so folks / bots are buying. Seen a several full bitcoin orders get filled....
I've been wrong this entire correction at some point ill be right Lol
/me smacks forehead
I feel like there is no such thing as safe entry anymore. As for going long, buying on dumps and setting SL seem to be better than waiting for confirmation that can turn out to be fake.
Thank you
cant believe people unironically upvote him, then again there are a lot of new emotional people here lately
That thought has been keeping me up most nights this past few weeks.
That would be the best thing right now. Stay here for 2 months and prove 6K is the bottom. This thing would blast off after that.
Could a squeeze potentially start a new bull run?
Hmm, which side might that be? ;)
Btc has a fairly stable price at the bottom of the last bear market
> Bitcoin is driven entirely by speculation.

There is a whole ecosystem of non-speculative businesses built around BTC
And who ended up being right?
The bearwhale was impressive, but that was at $300...and we went sub-$200 again a couple of months after that, if I remember right (with months of consolidation +/- $250 around then as well).
They're painting a pretty red line at $6k now. This won't be anything like that. This latest bearwhale lacks stamina. The Gox guys had 400000 BTC to sell

Well... everyone is wrong sometimes. Looks like you did call the 2015 bottom. But you also called this in May 2017: 

"It looks like we are in a bear market.  $2700 was the top.  I'm certain that it won't get as low as last time, so we should definitely stay above $200 and probably $500.  But other than that, speculators love a good bear market almost as much as a bull one.  I might be very scared/scarred from the 2014-2015 bear market.  But I think most people will refer to that, in which case we'll have lots of opportunities for it to appear to stabilize as we beat our way down to unexpected lows.

If you like risk, try shorting all the major alt-coins."

Just saying.
Didn’t mean to trigger you. Maybe consensus is not the correct word. I know that nobody knows anything, and that nobody is entirely confident enough to be “sure”. That being said, you can’t tell me there aren’t a TON of people running around calling a 4K bottom. Right? I mean, that’s not a fantasy narrative, that’s facts. If I had the time I bet I could link to thousands of comments, tweets, posts etc calling for a 4K bottom. A general consensus if you will. Not saying they are going to be right or even that I think they will be right. I have no clue...but the fact that it’s being said is not a fantasy my man. I was just trying to see if something similar was happening back then. 
It was a black swan event
It still comes back for me, to the at times madness of some people believing that we are at bottom right now.

The odds, trend and some logic firmly suggest otherwise. 

How many people have just repeated the same old mantra at every single big price point, be it 9000, 8000, 7000, 6000. "Oh we won't break below this level because blablabla"

Now clearly they'll be a bottom but there is practically nothing right now to suggest we are there. It's highly likely more downside until a reversal is clearly shown to us and more importantly, that it's completed as such
yes
Bitfinex log chart., it wicked below it on the 13th or so. On the 23/24th it hugged it a bit more but then bgd’d when it touched it a second time in that timespan.
$100 isn't much, we could say that was close enough, but doesn't really change much here.
it's literally the same thing. the entire sub is turning bullish again since we stopped dropping for a few days.. 

people here have very little patience 
Volume is your friend
Yup. It is not even close. I remember being despondent and giving up on Bitcoin (but not selling, thank God). People who think this market is anything like that don't know WTF they're talking about. 20K was just Bitcoin flexing his muscles. We'll get back there way sooner than it took to get back to 1K.
So do you think this positive sentiment and bigger community will carry us into another bull wave?  Or do we first need to wipe out the alt-coins (LTC is at an 2018 all-time-low as are many others), the VCs, and hit a deep bottom?
on the other hand, from what I saw in the dailies (which could be totally skewed), sentiment actually sort of seems to improve towards the end *before* the bottom.

Some of those dudes were optimistic when they were pushing new lows below $200!

My theory for this is that the people who wanted to sell/get out had finally left and general sentiment improved. 
Bitcointalk forum will be hard to analyze.  A lot of crazy posts!

In 2014, we bounced off the mid to high 300s three times.  So it looked like we had a floor at 400, then it rose to a floor of 600.  We stayed around 600 for two whole months!

People also thought we wouldn't go below the previous ATH of 266.  They were wrong...

Fundamentally you have to look at the technology and community. Sure we've made massive gains, but we still lack use cases.  There is a ton of froth from wild speculators and people getting millions for ideas that will never work.


Just wondering if I should sell now leaving open the chance this could pop off 5750 & rally past 6k++....decisions, decisions.
So we're going to have to go through a bear market worse than 14/15 then... okay
The "bag holders" are the shorts holding bags of fiat that won't be enough to buy back the Bitcoin they owe, and they will be the ones capitulating. Selling now is textbook selling the bottom.
I remember hearing the same thing when bitcoin was 200, and when ethereum was 6$..

The end of bear markets are always identified in the rear view mirror after the fact. That said I doubt we have reached either maximum pain or sufficient boredom to shake everyone out yet.
You know this daily is full of TA and all sorts of magical stuff but it seems like in about 14 days people forgot the fact that we broke down from a huge consolidation range that spanned ~120 days on relatively high volume. 

The target for it is easily sub $5k, too. 

While I appreciate the effort and don't mean to rag on the guy personally, the top post here today is literally a guy very politely and loquaciously asking "But have you all considered it might go up because it just could?" 

Everyone who agrees pats themselves on the back for being a contrarian, apparently not seeing the irony in it having 64 upvotes and being the top comment on the daily. 

It's quite literally a baseless projection - it's a bunch of words that basically say "remember that it can go up, guys." which I'm fairly sure we all understand already

I think most people realize and accept that things look bearish but are worried it's too obvious, still not seeing the irony in the fact that buying bitcoin as it was rocketing up past $2k, $3k, $4k, $5k, all the way up  to $20k was one of the most "obvious" and "it's too easy" trends to ever exist

I also see people saying things essentially like "how can we all win? we can't all just short this and make money." still not realizing that the majority of people here are hemorrhaging paper profits on this downtrend because they're too afraid to short/sell
Whales selling lots at once to drop the price quickly to trigger stop-losses (auto sells) which drop the price more is Stop-Loss Hunting/Chasing. By doing this, they force others to sell at a low price which they then buy. This allows them to gather lots of Ether cheaper than the market price so that when they pump the market price up, they can sell at a much greater profit. 
stop-loss* chasing..
La chasse au longs a pour but d'accumuler à bas prix.

There I speak french. Thank you for your condescendance. 

Au revoir,
My bad, you’re absolutely right. changed it 
Ask yourself why you bought in the first place.

Quick profits - sell, go short, or wait for bull market and buy back in.

Long term investment - evaluate your position, sell, or hold for another year and reevaluate.

For the tech - ignore the price and use the tech.
Really doesn't matter what your entry point is, everyone should have a plan for where to cash out if the investment doesn't go your way. 

if you don't have one: make one. 

if you were hoping to make a quick profit then you likely already missed the train, unless you want to try to learn how to trade. 

I think it is generally accepted right now that there won't be a massive bull/moon run any time soon, so unless you plan on trading the bounces and run-ups (that will inevitably turn around) then you're stuck holding your investment for a while, depending on how long it might take to go on another run

if you disagree and think we're about to go on a bull run, well what're you worried about 
the odds are 50/50 I'm right Lol, but I've been wrong this entire correction
nothing would surprise me at this point, but when it happens again its going to be the most historical Disbelief stage in history
i think i need to turn off my computer and wait until I walk by a newspaper with Bitcoin in the headlines.  then ill check the price
You can actually look at historical snapshots directly on Coinmarketcap: https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/
In late 2013 there were 40-60 alts in total. Now there must be a couple of thousand if we include stuff that isn't on Coinmarketcap. 

I really can't believe more than a modest percentage of two thousand shitcoins will survive the next couple of years unless there's a new influx of saps, and I doubt they'll arrive for a lengthy period. 

It's possible many will be tucked away by pumpers. I wonder if there are enough miners or stakers to keep each of them alive. 
I got one as well, got a second hand one for a very good price.
What did he post?
Well then why don’t you just get to it then. You should put the floor at $6100 then if anyone can. 
Yep. Many people don't realize that some of the longs  on BFX are just at standard 1:1 no leverage.  It's been mentioned here a thousand times but people don't want to hear things that go against their narrative
Why do you do this? Don’t you have to pay interest?
I don't get it, why would you do this instead of simply buying BTC on the exchange?
That is why it's so easy to manipulate
It doesn't count as a long since you are not borrowing any funding. Only borrowed funds are counted in the long/shorts statistics.
The implication is someone is gonna try to liquidate the longs by dumping.
Trying to add some humour and perspective in this sub, that's all. 
What do *you* want to say? You're always asking people what they want to say but you never say anything yourself 
Unchecked everything but the volume profile and set the row size to 500.
It worked for ripple 
Buy the rumor sell the news!
One of the most central piece in the whole Bitcoin ecosystem ???
We know they are highly interested in blockchain technology.
perfect rumor, comes a day after NEWS of FB unbanning crypto ads.
I will eat my dick if we are at 15k next month
> Why would he risk his reputation 

His reputation as a narcissistic criminal who needs the limelight? 

Why wouldn't he make such a call? 
What reputation?
Also, volume profil imho does not really fit.
damn that made me laugh harder than it should have 
I cut wicks. It's just my style of TA. If you don't think that's a falling wedge, then the jokes on you.
don't worry though because apparently 'the bears are in denial'
Honestly I see a lot of people saying that. It sucks I’m kinda desperate to make the money I lost tbh (27k) I didn’t know how to short and was buying the “dips”
Yes, but if things go down I was asking bc I would make it my first choice 
Indeed, the long term holders sold the fuck out of that news. https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/money-supply
Sometimes.....
Glad to help the next run!
Fair enough ~ i wont mind if you report it.
Would say it is more of a bart
You really think it is only children who buy crypto with no plans of selling for a multiple year window?

So only children made bank after the last major wave up?
I'm aware of this, but if this bilge is a thing presumably they're laying the foundations for their crescendo on that day. 
Thnx for this, never heard of it, but the explanation makes good sense.
I keep learning.
I decidedly tried to not make it apocalyptic, but if that's your takeaway from these statistics, then by all means short the living hell out of it ;)
Yeah, it was bonkers live. 
That's great, but look at the chart.

And yes I hope I remain bearish as long as the price is dropping.  That means more money...more food and shelter and travel for me.  When the market turns around, I will be bullish.  But that is unlikely to be for many months, except for short bullish DCB bounces.

Sorry, but that is what the chart clearly says at the moment.

And no, I don't expect the price to get anywhere near $1000 this year.  However the probability of $1000 BTC in the next three years is far from 0%.   $2700 is a more likely target though, some time in the next 12 months or so.
I feel like in this kind of shitty market, it's way too late to enter *after* a confirmation. I'm just gonna try to predict this thing in advance and just cut my loss
I also saw that also but now I'm seeing an ascending triangle.  7 rejections at 6250 (with one fakeout).  Thought we were going to break down several hours ago.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/1FGPBd8S/
I’m thinking of it, I will accumulate gBTC in my Roth over a period of a year or so, splitting my purchases up into 10 or so buys.  just have to decide when to start.  I feel like it’s getting close .  
The bear market didnt start 12 months ago, it started in december, but your point stands...still lots of potential for downside.
> Which downtrend is that? 

The downtrend from the all time high.

I agree Bitcoin is likely an excellent investment **BUT** it also has a history of losing 80% of its value in bear markets.
We've seen lots of long squeezes, they're just not super obvious because it looks like regular price movements. The BGD squeeze was an extremely violent, abrupt squeeze but we've definitely seen long/shorts squeezes before. They just don't move the price 20% in an hour. that was completely unprecedented and likely won't happen ever again or at least not for a while

https://www.tradingview.com/x/Xz6UpijT/

12k longs closed on our decline from $7.8k to $6k in April.

7k closed from $11.6k down to $9.4k before that, but then they climbed on the way down to $7.8k
Me neither. Following Ripple Longs / Shorts ratio for months now I just think that people do not care of losing money when comes it to downtrend or it is just ripple thing. But nevertheless I still pretty sure bitcoin is going another thousand down, but not because of Long Squeeze, but because of current trend down.
29th actually. 
Thanks a bunch!
Is it common for futures 3 months away (sept) to be at the same price for the one that closes in 2 days? I don't look at them much
How do you keep an eye on futures? Like what are they expecting BTC to close at on the 30th?
I owe you a steak dinner and bottle of Caymus.

Thank you kind sir
Sorry nothing against you ( that post came off a little intense), it was more like "when will people realize this pattern!" So good job seeing it and nice chart!
I'm using eth as an indicator and not trading it, but that sounds like a good play.
I haven't missed the train - I've been riding it downhill since the pennant broke down at $7250.

Again, there will very likely be a price turn around here in the next 2-4 weeks.  But you haven't done much to justify your position other than feels.  
There's a chart in this link with "Priceline's plunge", the first half of which looks remarkably like your chart.

http://money.cnn.com/2000/11/09/technology/overview/
Yes, excellent points. I agree, I think that shift will involve applications that really need a decentralized immutable ledger and probably those involved in the financial sector where middle man bloat is most ripe for trimming.
I guess I am tending to weigh more heavily towards the idea lately that even the dumbest of speculators are wising up, and that reality is setting in. We have recruited those who we will recruit based on idealism and speculation, and now if we are to recruit more speculators, and turn them into investors, we need a vehicle to drive them in on. That vehicle will need to be a true application of blockchain, not a shoehorn. 

BTC can't really be freed, ironically, until the most conservative of investing bodies wants to splash in, because they usually hold the most money and influence. Even 1&#37; of their balances, table scraps, would feed a trillion into this market space. I don't see a true reversal happening until there is regulatory clarity in the ICO space, and the tether situation is handled in such a way that it is no longer arguable. Otherwise we go back to a zesty game of musical chairs with our ragtag group of degenerate riff-raff. 
> 24/7/364

Ah so I guess we're taking Chinese New Year off
Agree but a short squeeze can still happen.
I don't understand, the all time low is zero dollars. 
That's a fair point, I have been wondering whether $4k in August or September might be too low too soon. That would require a consistent sell off which is possibly unlikely. Either way it's not looking particularly good!
[We broke it already in late April on 3rd attempt.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/yR4oN65S/)  We're now riding it down. 
King, I'll try to answer you in an unbiased way.  $6k has acted as a floor for ~3 major macro drops in 2018, but it can't go forever.  The analogy is that you can drop a ball from a high point and it bounces a few times but eventually stops.  Markets do something similar, but as each subsequent peak gets lower and lower (like $BTC has shown), the threat is we will fall through the price floor (since the price will never *stop*).  

We have already made a new 2018 low.  Bulls have fought back but we're still only at this $6.1k level... nothing to brag about really.  So the logical question becomes this - are we in "redistribution" where whales are intentionally offloading onto little fish like us, who are waiting for the $1k candle bounce they never give us?  Or are the whales buying these lows, preparing for that massive candle, to give us a new rally upward.

If sloppy is correct, we're currently undergoing re-distribution.  He's suggesting the signs of buy pressure with little to show for it are a bad/scary sign.  What bulls would prefer to see is LOTS of sell pressure, but the price refusing to budge. 

(Here's one example of redistribution, just as an fyi):

http://d.stockcharts.com/img/articles/2015/11/1446837631954895112336.png
It's complicated and when it comes down to it the whole accumulation vs distribution thing is confusing and potentially misleading.

But from what I've seen, whoever's more patient (whoever sets limit orders) is the one in control of movement and price direction
Because there are loads of coins that were purchased for well under 1200, thus there are lots of coins for sale at these prices. The entire price range above 6200 can be viewed as a giant distribution top.
I was so exhausted earlier today (still am) so sorry if I didn't make sense. Generally I have simply found that whoever lets the market move into their orders is the one that you consider the wyckoffian distributor or accumulator 

In April we stayed near the bottom of the range a lot in $6ks because the market was generally bearish while someone kept accumulating. 

In the $9.6 to $9.9k run up we hovered near the top for a while- the distributors let people buy into their sells. 

When on side is largely attempting to move up or down and the price is not budging, I generally refer to that as small scale distribution/accumulation.

It doesn't always have to be that way. But the price being "suppressed" near a local bottom looks like re distribution to me, personally. 

There is no price to low to sell at if you don't believe buyers will take it higher 
fo sho - enjoy your break homie 
He's lying, that's how. 
Oh yeah I totally agree it shouldn't be used as a trend reversal indicator but does show that the very least during these past two major drops demand was still greater than or equal  to supply. 

Although it is slightly pointing down, the difference in the steepness of the accum/distrub curve during the uptrends compared to the downtrends are significantly different and I would just think of it (at least currently) as noise 
Actually, a company named altcoin analytics shows that sentiment started changing more positive last week after falling for 6 months. Sentiment is a an indicator of the immediate future.
It did take me too long to adjust to the bull market trend last time, so not like I am the fastest, but when the price is down 70% and still dropping, I am bright enough to see that it likely to drop more.
Accidentally deleted my comment above idk how, oops, mobile is bad. But, usually the larger spreads were just between usdt and regular usd exchanges. Bfx and polo would be roughly even, and kraken stamp gdax gemini were also evenish. 
yeah, and the longs have been getting fucked for almost 2 months now without any relief rallies. And yes longs have been getting opened, guess what, they've been getting opened at the bottom, so they aren't as squeezable. 

But the shorts have been piling on too, and we spent quite a bit of time in the $6K range now. So I'd bet quite a few of those shorts have been opened in the $6-6.5K range. 

don't get me wrong, I'm not saying this thing goes to ATH from here. I'm saying that we are due for a relief rally. Probably to around $8.5K-9K At which point this thing has to decide if its ready to turn bullish or if it'll head back down to catch a lower low. 
the motivator is simple...FOMO and pressure for shorts to close before they get liquidated. 

people bought at $9800 last time bounced of $6,000. What was their motivation then? 

the "motivator" you talk about, is only really relevant for the turn around between a bear and bull cycle. a dead cat bounce/relief rally just needs people to stop selling for a bit 
You might get those. I'm hoping we don't climb that high, but it feels like we have some precursor attempts. Wouldn't be surprised by a LGD to 6250, and on Kraken you'd probably get at least 6300. 
Yeah, would say your stop was actually pretty good. Happens also on the mex futs from time to time, due to low liquidity. Cost me probably more than not putting any stops at all on the futs, lol.
>Anchoring or focalism is a cognitive bias that describes the tendency for an individual to rely too heavily on an initial piece of information offered (known as the "anchor") when making decisions.

Sad, but also necessary. There is no path between this growth phase market and a mature market that includes shitcoin stowaways. You just will not have people taking this space seriously with the speculative cesspool. 
Agreed. BTC's value proposition as the only SoV coin gets clearer over time. The alts have had their day.
The "better, faster, shinier than Bitcoin" hype is exhausted, none of it has materialized. Just as the "blockchain not Bitcoin" narrative has resulted in nothing but a lot of wasted money and many people making themselves look foolish. ICOs have lost their novelty and are now generally seen as the money grabs or outright scams that they are. Buying into shitcoins now is betting on the market ignoring all of this, and pumping anything just because it somehow exists in proximity to Bitcoin. 
I get the bids can be pulled anytime...I guess I meant this as more of a caveat not to trust someones random musings on the web. 

I'd like to see any proof or explanation on debunking cost of mining as a floor.  3/4 of 2015 was proof of it to me..
Meanwhile your capital depreciates and you still pay rent and other overhead. 
Coinbase exec was hired by FB and still sits on Coinbases board....
There were rumors facebook was working with LTC last year and rumors that amazon was working with eos. They are all bullshit, of course. Facebook does have some engineers working on blockchain, but it's like basic research level, probably most of the tech companies are doing the same. It's a hot area of computer science research, even in academia.
I do like spending them. It is convenient for online retail globally.
People are selling them. That's a bit like spending them.

I dunno, to me that's like asking people if they spend dollars. The point of dollars is not to spend them. They have value because people keep them and want them. It's so obvious it almost makes sense why they have to say the opposite so many times.
We are friends now
> Also you pay higher fees than using an exchange yourself to convert crypto to fiat and send it to your bank account.

Wrong. Perhaps use/research them before commenting w/ misplaced confidence.

Obviously the vast majority of daily vendors do not accept crypto. Just very small portion accept direct crypto, particularly in tech-savvy cities. 

When vendors do (i.e. via PundiX), I will pay them in kind.
Few shops are doing pretty well, others have stagnant sales. Personally, I'm very happy with it. Future updates could be a game changer: web based interface (no need to download OpenBazaar), mobile phone application, possibility to accept various cryptos within one single shop, etc.
?
You're supposed to be a bear...
Hmmm, not sure about adding on the way down tbh.. i am not a fan of naked bottom shorting. Or did i understand your comment wrong?
It's gonna do one thing to the space: Debase
sure but in many ways ppl that are into crypto such as the founders of coinbase don't agree with the Facebook model.  i remember reading how much Brian armstrong loved Ethereum which if a social media Dapp were to be made on it - it would be much different
Yummy!
Actually trading these past two months have kept me fully erect.
How low do you think it’ll even go? I doubt lower than 4K 
Charlie the prophet.
if bitcoin ever hits $400k (2000% of our current ATH) it will be a bubble, tellin ya that right now. 
That's true, it does sound plausible. Maybe I'm just being pessimistic due to the bear market. Either way, I'm eagerly waiting to see what happens as the next halvening approaches.
XMR is a fantastic hedge. When the top people in the largest crypto submarkets agree on something, it's probably a safe bet.
Well I feel a bit foolish
What do you think about it also being whales on high leverage? But I guess that would show in the numbers?
I reduce every position by 0.25% to account for potential fees (i based this on Kraken). I now some exchanges have no fees (or even pay) so this might be a question to address on whether the bot should take this into consideration.
Well, they have low liquidity because everyone left their exchange when their matching engine and site performance were terrible. So yes, it's their fault.

That said, that's where I still trade, since it's one of the few places you can legitimately short from the US.
Their platform is buggy and will double execute / confirm and then not execute trades / go down during high volume / "run out of margin funds" so you can't close a position (how the fuck does that make any sense Kraken tech support?!?!?)
Yeah, that's kraken for you. flashcrashes and flashspikes
The point is that a big move up could screw him. Why do you assume the stop loss will trigger? In dildo territory it may not happen. Plus if the stop was with market order, any sudden move up could bring big losses. Finally, short at 6100 is simply not right mate!  


PS I have a bot, but if I remember correctly the stop losses in kraken now do a market order. Maybe someone can correct me.
lower than 20%?
There are those wash sale rules of 30 days or so for stocks, but I don't think they apply to cryptocurrency.  And that is for if you sell Apple stock and buy it back in the next few days.  If you sell Apple and buy Microsoft, no way it is a wash sale.  So I don't see how selling BTC and buying LTC would be a wash sale...no way, although I am not an expert.
Just the past couple of weeks. They'll likely continue to drop only if bitcoin drops. Of rather be all fiat than trade litecoin for bitcoin. 

If bitcoin drops, alts will likely drop harder. If bitcoin recovers, the alts ratios will likely recover back to their norm. 
Idk, the market is not rational? What I said is just one of the factors. XMR price has been showing some signs of strength lately which indicated it may be a good trade opportunity. Generally though we're still in the bear market so most coins are in the shitter.
> This market would be too easy if everyone would win

when the market trends, everyone who goes with the trend tends to "win"
cup and handle on the BTCUSDSHORTS?
Goblin town for all, shorts just make money vacationing there.
you used big words, downvoted
Whales can get rekt too. But in this case, yeah noobs are going to get fucked trying to guess the bottom. Everyone thinks and wants 6k to be the bottom. That's why I think the MM's are going to let the longs pile up(just like they did on the short squeeze from 6900) then they'll dump it a thousand bucks, shorts pile in and then they reserve it. Max pain that screws both sides. 
You were saying?
Yup this is basically me right now. I am pretty sure that if I sell most of my alts, I can buy back lower. Besides I don’t want to be in too many alts right now due to the fact that some of them (probably a lot of them) are likely going to die. Bitcoin is safer than alts atm.
you and me buddy :P
What reason did people have at the end of 2017 to buy crypto other than because the price was rising?
Spaulding get your foot off the boat! 
Then you must have a lot of cash on hand.
Au contraire, svp
Yep, even Kraken's fairly low volume had a 140+ coin wall at 6100 and then 6000 yesterday. It's less than half that now and fluctuating every time we flirt with the 6k line.
Right but the walls are bigger than they've been the last weeks on both sides. I don't think we're going anywhere. 
6.3-6.5 area
Safe entry is buying above/at/just below previous ATH (which is roughly $1200).
Im convinced he’s a psyops account but the quality seems too low for a pro psyop
If you're serious... sell everything and step away for a few weeks....

You can thank me later.
My personal opinion:

without news: no. It would likely just delay the inevitable and do what we did in April to May. Run up to strong resistance with virtually no pullbacks then resume the downtrend. 

with great news: yes, that is possible. It's likely the bull run would start either way in that case, though. Just might take longer to get started

keep in mind longs are the ones piling on here and shorts are generally decreasing/staying stagnant
There wasn't that much money involved before. And a lot of the traders back then were amateurs. This time there are more professional traders that only look to increase the value of their fiat portfolio. If they leave, they take A LOT of liquidity with them. But they won't do it in the near future. There are still a lot of amateur traders in cryptoland to milk money from.
On shorter time frames? The 1/3. and because of that they accumulated a massive number of coins. 

Longer term 2/3...that is, if they didn't get shaken out at the bottom. 
That's a matter of opinion.  The bearish ones were arguably right at the time.


Good point! I'd forgotten how to count that low. 
Simiar thing will likely happen again.  People are stupid and also have incredibly short memories.
Some more goodness:

May 31, 2017, 07:31:03 PM: "Sold 2.7 BTC on GDAX at 2260 average.  Got 10 BTC left."

June 01, 2017, 01:37:10 AM: "Sold 3 BTC at around 2320 on Gdax.  Now I'll probably try to hold the rest until they double or something crazy."

I actually like most of your posts that I've read, and appreciate your thought. I'm just trying to point out that you might have a bearish tint. You sold half of your BTC under 3k. I would be too if that was the case.


Yeah. I'm a lot better with picking bottoms so far as I've got an inherent skepticism about things.

I sold half my bitcoins at $700 after I was up 100% ;)

That said, I'm trying to embrace bubbles. So I'm thinking 3k, and then 20k+ in 2-4 years (unless we have a bad recession).
> you can’t tell me there aren’t a TON of people 

A ton of people do not represent "everyone"... or even close.

And even if there was a reasonable consensus in this sub (and there won't ever be if the price is dropping), that doesn't mean there is a general consensus in the larger world, including this sub, and really no way you would know if there was one or not.

So it's a useless discussion, unless you are just doing it for entertainment, and in that case, nothing at all wrong with it and carry on.
To be fair the rise up was also premature as the infrastructure around BTC was also not very diversified or protected against single entry points of failure. 
Thanks.Richy. more clear !!


Reversal will come  
Maybe bottom isn't until BTC dominance points decidedly up. Maybe the last week or so is positive movement in that direction.
Seriously though, it's doom and gloom on the high volume drops, then bullish on the bounces with the crazy wicks, then we move sideways, then volume picks up some with another price  drops and the sub is bearish again, everyone talks about how it's going to drop because of the daily "bear flag" that ultimately slow grinds up (at this point the sub is only slightly bullish for the short term), we stop just at resistance with volume plummeting, and then finally we have another large volume drop and the cyle starts over

Edit: look at the daily chart, we always seem to try and move pass the 12 day EMA before we experience our big drops 
Trust me I know, I stare at it religiously 
yea to me this feels more like a pushdown than 14, the drop the last 2 months hasn't accelerated at all like the dumps in 14, it's been very slow and methodical. I felt like 14 was just a thousand falling knifes, we'd get big bounces then vicious drops over and over again.
If any one wants to write a quick “key” to all this...please do!!

Fiat = 
Bag holders = 
Shorts =
Hodl =

(And any other little bits you think are helpful) 
Thanks! :)
"maximum pain or sufficient boredom."

We are making progress, surely.
So you are saying there's a chance?
> "remember that it can go up, guys." which I'm fairly sure we all understand already

do you read this daily, brotha? there are *many* people who are 100% convinced we will never go back up
I believe that what I shared in the post earlier today went well beyond simply "it can go up".  It was meant to be more about risk management than anything else. In fact, I even made it clear that I am in agreement that the probability supports BTC price pushing lower. 

That being said, you and I have a differing approach towards investing in this space and with that our perspectives, too, will differ.    
Yeah, people are not seeing the big picture. We broke down from a massive triangle, we also set a new horizontal low. This was a 5 month pattern/range that has broken down. It's just not the time to be long. I think in terms of the hopium/permabulls there are 1) a lot of new people who don't trade and don't want to sell for a loss (probably bought at 8k based on volume profile) and 2) long time holders who are selling right now (at immense profits) to support their lavish lifestyle but would rather the price go higher so they post moon charts and hopium.
Translation:  I'm a short seller who posts a lot of bullshit to get people to sell
> like in about 14 days people forgot 

That's why you have more money than many of the people here.  Because you don't have the memory of an ant.
Qui va a la chasse, perd sa place.
Lol good one 👍

Your original post is a bit hard to understand, don't really get your point. 
Franchement, ce n'est pas mal.
Je suis très impressionné par toi!

apart from masturbate in my spare time, I also speak a bit of French...although not the greatest
Thank you
50/50 huh? That's like saying when you buy a lottery ticket your chances are 50/50: you either win or you don't.
So that's what all of the crazies walking my streets and screaming at newstands are doing...
Unless they're broken, difficulty always adjusts so they will always have a miner/staker. I think you're spot on about getting "tucked away by pumpers" for another day, claiming the mantle of an "established" alt.
yall mf's need jesus
What sort of discount do you get on used sextoys?
Said he was 100% long  from like $8.3k and not worried lmao 
My point is that it has nothing to do with mining- which was your original argument. 

Your original statement:

> I'm surprised no one in that thread floated the idea that a miner can take out a loan from a bank or idk maybe keep strategic reserves of cash to maintain the price rather than shut their equipment off.

seems to draw a link between miners continuing to mine and price floors. 

What part of "someone with a lot of money can prop up the price" necessitates that it be a miner? What does that have anything to do with mining?
there's still been long squeezes though, at levels from anywhere between 30-40k longs

not *every* long is what you indicated haha.. People are still using leverage to trade

If you look at longs and shorts historically there have actually been more long squeezes than short squeezes generally. I'll do a detailed analysis of it later 

everyone just thinks a squeeze is 20% in an hour instead of 20% in a day or two :P 
No loan is taken until you go above 1x . It allows me to see my base price(DCA) and exact profit/loss.
only lend to leverage. He's buying BTC on margin with enough collateral to cover his buys entirely so no liqui. I guess people do it to keep track of their positions if trading on a long term swing trade style.
You pay no interest in that case, but can conveniently see your pnl. Also to fuck with anyone trying to call the 'underwater' longs.
he can have extra arbitrage cash to move around (I do this), e.g. sell 3 BTC for USD/EUR, send 1 btc to bitmex/bitfinex and go 3x long (pretty risk-free to avoid 33% crash); pay margin costs on finex (or even collect funding on swaps); send around extra cash to get 0.3-0.4% arbitrages between exchanges
Care to explain please? I'm fairly certain your wrong and my assumptions are correct. (That it actually doesn't matter at all)
It does, Bfx system doesn't count borrowing USD/BTC as long/shorts but total trades on margin section.
Perfect.  Nice
don't mind that guy idk why he asks everyone what they want to say. he's always asking "What do you want to say" like wtf you mean man
Yeah I'm with Sloppy on his one
Pfff. Last 3+ years I have said loads.

I just ask what you mean. Not very clear.
awesome thanks, that row size is sweet

looks like we got a bit of thin air between $4300-5600. I suspect we'll grind our way down to $5700 and potentially make a large move down to $4500 
lol..there won't be any news

It's so amazing that coinbase is the most central piece in decentralized currencies!!!
I'll quit Coinbase if that happens
You would think that would push the market up a little bit but it has barely moved.  Can't shake the bear feeling right now although someone/some people seem to be buying everything up under 6k.
seriously be careful with that dude, easy to choke on small objects ;)
RemindMe! 1 month "hotdogs without meat are just bread"
I knew someone would make that kind of comment. I don't defend him, I don't care, but he seem to have infos. His social position alone is making him more informed than us.

He took the risk to ridicule himself by 2020 with his crazy BTC prediction. He still have about 2 years to be proven wrong. But now he's making a bold 1 month prediction. If that doesn't happen, he will be definitely discarded.


this is the real problem. this bad boy is accelerating.
You cut way more than wicks. 
Your going to lose all your money. My advice is get out, learn to trade properly (including bankroll management) come back. Dont chase your losses because they will get bigger and bigger. Your trying to squeeze money out of a stone at the moment with bitcoin unless you know what your doing.
Don't trade on tilt. You're just gambling and will make it worse
Never commit more than 1-2% of your total capital to one idea (trade). You can achieve this by always having a stop loss in place as soon as you enter the trade. You position your stop loss at a price that you believe would invalidate your trade idea if it hit.
> I’m kinda desperate to make the money I lost tbh

That's one of the textbook signs of gambling addiction, and will almost certainly make your situation worse.      
   
Based on your comment below it sounds like you bought in at about $8,000 which really isn't that bad -- think about the people who bought at $18k.  If this is money you don't need right now, there's nothing wrong with just holding.  Only the super-ultra-bears are predicting that bitcoin will *never* again go back above $8k.   Don't fixate on the idea of  "everyone's making money but me", it's a surefire way to lose everything.
Wow, so you want to sell bottom on top of that?
well in that case you _really_ shouldn't do anything
**Desperate**, **make money** don’t go together.

I wonder how much of bitcoin is made up of guys like you. 


Yeah, all of us are "children." They can patronize all they want. We're still taking their money because apparently children have better math skills than big, dumb bears.
Why on earth would you buy an asset and “hold it” with no regard for market conditions? That’s just stupid. You should buy and sell to increase your stack. That is why smart money does.
Put down the thesaurus and pick up a dictionary 
Ahh, gotcha!
I thought that breaking 6k again will drop us harder... And it got bought up like crazy...
You're going to ignore some candles? Because they're inconvenient?
even if it were an ascending triangle, the "rule" is that on a reversal ascending triangle you need 3 touches on support, not just 2. 

but yea tbh that does't look much like one 
Far more potential for upside. In case you hadn't noticed, we've been bouncing off 6k like a trampoline since February. Only a complete idiot would sell/short here.
Try drawing your line from the "all-time-high" in 2013, then imagine what you sound like to someone who bought (all the way down to $150) and held that. You think this dip is big? Shit. Newbs.
We are now at 32.5k longs on Bfx, the number slowly rising from 30k a few days ago, and a decreasing number of shorts, down to 24k. Open Interest on Bitmex is oscillating around 87-92k, so there's slight decline there. Edit: So Bfx longs up are, shorts are down, Bitmex is flat.

How would you interpret that? Sentiment remains negative, i.e. bearish. Logically, a journey below 6k which many seem inevitable should increase the number of shorts. Why it isn't so? Are people afraid of shorting the bottom? But that would be counter-argumentative to the expected drop below 6k. Honest questions. 
It's not often that happens, just as it's not often that futures trade at a price below the perpetual swaps. But that's from my perspective, I could be wrong. 
Nothing owed, and i'd like to invite you for a steak dinner in Europe next time you're around these woods ;) for market science and drinking. Actually, primarily drinking...
Thanks. Wondering if I should try trading this...
I'm an investor not a trader. My techniques work almost exclusively incorrectly on short time frames, but so far caught the big trends, knock on wood. Not trying to convince people of anything by the way, just sharing how I view things, however fucked that may be.
Cool man
Fear, not greed, will drive the next bubble. Want to help the price? Hold out for higher prices.
But it can't...? At least not by the looks of things. There balance is way out of whack and longs are increasing while shorts are decreasing, all while the price stays still and/or goes down. 

That means that there is very little short squeeze fuel to put in the tank, should the market decide to try to go up.

Current bear market all time low :D
That's not the same line as the one I drew for 2014. The line you drew, can also be drawn for 2014 in the linear chart and it rode it down similarly. 
Thanks for the clarification, it's appreciated
That's a great explanation overall. 

That being said, are we not seeing what you're describing below right now? What kind of volume would you be looking for?

> What bulls would prefer to see is LOTS of sell pressure, but the price refusing to budge.

>  $6k has acted as a floor for ~3 major macro drops in 2018, but it can't go forever.

The price dropped 4% below $6K the last time.  That is not a floor.
You've been a pretty active bearish voice in the last couple of weeks and I'm starting to doubt your motivations.

EDIT: I have not downvoted you, just so you know.
> It's complicated

He didn't ask for your relationship status, bud
A giant distribution top? You actually believe that 70% of the total price area of BTC is distribution?
Right but now bfx is almost always even with Dax and stamp 
most longs were in profit for most of that time, now they're not. they haven't felt any real pressure before now. most shorts are from >$6800, still no real pressure on them - the bottom shorters closed in the past few days. we spent months to break 6.4-6.5k, it's not just going to roll over after building such a strong support turned resistance. with all of that in mind i don't think any bullish rally is possible atm, at least very unlikely
Fomo amongst fewer and fewer hands can only take you so far. I don't exclude the possibility of a relief rally, so I agree with you, I just don't trust it to run very far which is why if it does start to wick up I won't bother buying into it, just like I haven't bothered buying into the others save for a scalp trade here and there. The motivator then was greater fools who thought maybe there was a turn around, but they weren't paying attention to the underlying fundamentals, which are dismal. 

Now we have lethargy just above the major resistance of 2018 and we are still in a massive downtrend for the year and +\~$3000 above where we could still be considered in an all time uptrend, could be a relief bounce, but crypto is on thin ice and it is a sunny day. 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/jJQv3aAF/

My game plan is to stack 30% of stack just below the blue line ( $6205 , $6231, $6256) 

Then stack the remaining 70% between the blue and red line ( Red is the 10k resistance line ) with entries of 

( 15% @ $6278 ) ( 15% @ $6310 ) (15% @ $6335) and (25% at $6385) and bail over $6450 ish on everything.

Might be a little too spread out, but i really like scaling into entires 
There are alts that are not aiming to replace Bitcoin as a store of value and have excellent potential to accomplish what they are trying to do and provide value in businesses such as supply chain management, IoT, AI, etc. Not every alt is a shitcoin. Many alts will die but I really think some will actually help bring legitimacy to the entire space through enterprise adoption. 
Indeed. I've been in bitcoin since 2011 and have literally seen every alt. I've seen a couple that IMHO actually do improve core issues in Nakamoto consensus. Regardless, if they don't pass peer review in BTC they don't matter. There is only one direction for them over time.
[Last comment on mining cost](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8q6lf4/daily_discussion_monday_june_11_2018/e0h0ejb/)
A lot of folks have bought miners on credit as well, you need to factor that in if they have loans to repay.
sure but Brian Armstrong has a vision.  Crypto is creating a brand new industry.  I doubt he would sell out, already pretty rich i imagine.
>The point of dollars is not to spend them. They have value because people keep them and want them. 

Not sure if you're trolling. The point of dollars is literally to spend them. They depreciate so as to encourage spending, and discourage "keeping"/hoarding.

I feel as though a more accurate analogy would be physical gold. Precious metals encourage hoarding, not many spend them. 
I haven't because i find their use stupid. But i am happy to be proven wrong. So currently, i am converting my crypto trading profits to fiat, and send them to my Revolut card which has absolutely no fees (it doesn't even have foreign exchange fees during the work days). Can you name one crypto debit card that comes close to that?
But Marcus who was head of Messenger and now sits on the Coinbase board sure likes Coinbase’s model. 
I’m going to short btc until it’s 100% from ath for maximum profit
Sure, unless it hits $400k on the way down from a million. Then it will be a local low
what do you mean? Like you think these are stop losses? I don't think so because it doesn't look like cascading market orders. 

I really do basically think it sums up to: people are trying to get the best prices for their orders. that is usually right after a dump/pump on lowish volume with low conviction. 
Makes sense. No big deal. I generally use limit orders (to get paid), but have definitely used market a couple times recently. If you're sweating 0.25% on your P&L....lol

Was just curious. Thanks man
fair enough. i just started trading there in April & haven't had any of those issues beyond the fact they don't have super deep books compared to the likes of finex. Being able to trade with the cryptowatch chart is nice. Kind of seems like more people have started trading there though. the eth usd pair on kraken gets almost as much trading volume as eth usd pair on coinbase. 
fair enough i haven't run into any of those issues since i've started trading there beyond low liquditiy. i've had the run out of margin funds thing but never when closing a position only when opening a position, that is fucky. 
> Why do you assume the stop loss will trigger? 

there are stop losses that don't trigger? That sounds awful 
I mean, if you dump JP morgan and buy Fargo Wells they can rule it a wash in Canada and many EU countries, just giving a heads up is all
Correct. Wash sales apply to stocks and securities from what I've read. Bitcoin is considered property.
It also just broke downwards from one of the largest patterns I've ever seen in crypto- a 5 month descending triangle.

Target...-$240 😂
I'm not following
Awareness due to advertising/media coverage.  (Chicken and egg, I know).

Price has risen many times in the past without causing a huge influx of new investors, 2017 was different because of the level of exposure imo.
[deleted]
Do you have in mind any news in particular that might be such a catalyst?
The brutal truth :)
This was actually very accurate:

"We could see a big blow-off top around the time the CME goes through.  So December 18.  I've got no real idea, but something like a run at 15k or 20k followed by a crash to 7-9k would be along the lines of what is possible."

Im getting too deep...
It'll be just like my favourite priest as a child used to say to me... wait for it and it shall come
May very well be. I'm hopeful that bottom will be between the 4900 and 5300 range. I posted earlier with my reasoning behind that idea. 

Where we'll be in 3 or 4 months is a real mystery either way
what's funny is if the uptrend were this strong and we had just peeked over the edge of $12k there would be no one bearish here lol. If 5k shorts opened everyone would be talking about a short squeeze, too
 
really I still have a feeling the strength of the downtrend is going to surprise people because they'll keep fighting it and then end up shorting/selling the bottom 

The amount of time eth/btc have spend outside the bollinger bands lately is ridiculous 
Well it is significantly increasing since we broke 7000$. This should be a tell that the situation is quite different
It wasn't a personal rag on you but more on how it's received. People seem to think everyone is shorting and selling the bottom when it's clear people are holding and hoping. 

I like your writing style and you seem like a nice guy that I'd be friends with. 

I apologize if it came off as a personal attack- truly did not mean it that way. 

I meant to edit some of my comment to make that more clear but didn't get around to it.. There  was a section that was really lame of me to leave in so just please don't take it personally, like I said, the primary point was on how it was received 
Would you like me to stop commenting? 
Well your downvote bot is working nicely kid. I reported it and you to the admins. We'll see if you get banned soon
It's unfortunate how adverse people are to selling/shorting as if it's a moral quandary to them. It's very odd

I personally cannot wait to long this, I am sick of shorting
I'm actually French Canadian
Id say over 50% we are at the bottom.  When it was down at 5800 last sunday morning it didn't last long and it seemed kind of surreal, didn't feel right.  Im holding no matter what and am lucky to have bought some below 3k so my DCA is pretty much even at this point.  But it would make sense for 6k to hold.  The tech IMO is easily worth that
haha!
Do you often give out sex worker recommendations on reddit?

But yes I agree Jesús is fantastic; I wouldn't quite say once you go black you never go back but he earns his keep.
lol
Mmmm idk maybe miners have a lot of capital and a vested interest in keeping the price at a certain level. 

To my point exactly. A miner knows where they become unprofitable so they take measures to make sure that doesn’t happen. 

I’m trying to be patient.  


You realize when btc was at 20k they were still mining and making/saving a lot of money.  
It necessitates that it be a miner because they have the most invested in btc
Gotcha. I was not aware you didn't actually borrow money when you are under 1x leverage.

This doesn't sounds like a bad idea as long as you are sure you will *eventually* close your entire position. Otherwise you will need to pay an additional commission. 
I'm also saying it does not matter because it can easily be manipulated to show that a long squeeze is imminent so people are afraid to buy or may even short.

Did you change account as I have not replied to your comment in the past
if he said "I'm not sure I understand your point, can you please elaborate?" would that be acceptable?
The news will be that they're not buying them. 
If there's no news, then it become a news isn't? :p

Just... no. If this is your bearish perspective of my TA then it's just laughable.
You’re right I used to big of an amount on something I didn’t know I was doing. I chased the bag 😂 the losses are my mistake. Which I bought when bitcoin dropped 60% of all time so I have plenty of space to recover 
Yeah you’re exactly right tbh. That’s what I tell myself. Bitcoin will shine again. And I don’t need the money but I’m just like damn I wanna be making money you know that feeling? 
Good information. I am guilty of this from time to time. Its a nice reminder for us amateurs. 
The whole market I’d say 🤭 including you.
I guess my point is I would be buying now in this price range with a plan to hold through the dips.

  
Follow? Obviously buying at 20k is different than buying now.
Dayummm
I genuinely have no idea what's wrong with my use of the English language here. It makes me feel kind of sexy. 


Yeah. I actually had some knife catching orders on June for a scalp. 0.33x long at 6055 right now. lol
I have to agree with /u/jarederaj

That is way too much leeway
As for the top horizontal line.  6 precise rejections vs 1 fakeout.. yes.. in this case.  As for the ascending bottom line, doesn't really matter if i cut that candle off or not it's still an ascending line.   Of course i could be wrong but i'm trying to make sense of it.  
Hey, sloppy. When are you planning to close your short positions, just wondering?

I had the feeling you don't trade the corrective waves and just hodl your short positions
Youve been consistently wrong for a while now, so i would not resort to name calling if i were you. Price just set a new low, this means a break down from the above 6k range is likely. Buyers above 6200 are exhausted, still lots of sellers left though. I will keep shorting bounces and breakdowns as the trend is clearly down.
> You think this dip is big?

We'll get there.  Give it a few more months.
>  Open Interest on Bitmex is oscillating around 87-92k, so there's slight decline there. 

Actually :)

    _____   81123 	8:55 PM		6/24/2018

    _____   79517	9:46 PM		6/24/2018

    $6235	81791	8:47 PM		6/25/2018

    $6191	83732	11:12 AM	6/26/2018

    $6072	88136	12:40 AM	6/27/2018	

so open interest on bitmex has risen a decent amount these past few days.

People are afraid of shorting the bottom- yes. it's generally more difficult to trade the short side of this market (one of the most parabolic assets in all of history, hah) and the BGD has probably left quite a few traders very hesitant to short. 

Not to mention that the sentiment here/in this sub does not necessarily match the sentiment of the market participants who are still buying/selling/trading this range. For all we know there's a genius market manipulator behind this and he's accumulating longs to mark it up. 

Or he's accumulating shorts on bitmex while selling into longs on bitfinex to reduce his spot exposure before he unloads on the market. 

Who knows. But bearish sentiment doesn't necessarily mean people are selling. They could just be *anticipating* selling. And they might, soon. 

There's a ton of different possibilities.

My guess is: people don't want to short the bottom but they're willing to sell it on spot. Which is why the price is moving down despite shorts not opening. So shorts from above like mine and some of the other people responding to you here are just waiting for spot sells to push it down. 


Btw: don't think I ever responded to your PM mate, sorry about that. Busy with work lately and have gotten lost in a lot of my messages lately. Remind me to respond to it or send it again

A lot of people maybe thinking of shorting here but have memories of the real BGD last time it was logical to short. Now we are drifting slowly downwards with new longs and no real increase in shorts. I wouldn't go long here so I'm not cutting my short (it's up over 22%). R/R may favour longs but when we breakdown with conviction sub 6K with a 4HR close underneath things will get interesting.

People may be afraid of shorting the bottom. So many people come in here and mention that they are thinking of going short and you get the same old people saying shit like 'goodbye lifesavings' or there's a rant from someone who has been in the scene for less than a year ranting on about how the fundamentals are so great that the price should skyrocket and the market is clearly wrong and underpricing BTC. Not that I think BTCMarkets moves the market at all but thats probably some valid points over why shorts are not increasing (without going into TA as I'm at work and cant really chart)).
Trading the short side is more difficult than trading long. My guess is that fewer people get it right, or are willing to trade it
OP watch out those aren’t steaks they’re babies.
I’ll be in Germany in August and Italy in February

I bought at our first trip to the 420s, sold 40% at 465 and used that to buy back at 428.

I'm expecting a slow grind to the 12 day EMA currently (maybe wick slightly past it) 
No prob... it's been a grueling downtrend... I don't think it's quite over personally, but I'll share the idea that an uptrend (at least temporarily) is not far off in the distance. 
We are past the point of meme fuel, this space needs to produce real value to grow. Everyone has peeked behind the curtain at this point and now evidence of utility will be required to win the trust of the wary.

Growth market -> market shake up -> mature market
So why are more traders longing if TA & sentiment indicates the trend is down? Conversely, why aren’t more traders shorting? 
Is it just too much uncertainty at this point?
You mean your prediction on your line? Not the actual low of 5780?
Yes I'm trying to get you all to sell! Give me your coins!!!!!!!

I've gotten this same comment a few dozen times already and we're now sitting at $6130 having made a 7 month low. What kind of malicious motivations could I have? Helping people make money? 
Yes, that's very common for a parabolic blow off top. It has happened in many markets, including multiple times in bitcoin.
Seems like a pretty solid approach to scaling. I typically use a 5/10/15/20/25 spread on 5 entries, but I'm not sure it's any more or less effective than your plan. 
A postgres database can do all of that too. We don't put a dollar value on it though.
How many alts would you say you seen fade out of existence? 
I'm surprised no one in that thread floated the idea that a miner can take out a loan from a bank or idk maybe keep strategic reserves of cash to maintain the price rather than shut their equipment off.
yeah, but he can be MORE rich. Seriously though, don't get caught up in that kind of thinking, at the end of the day people make businesses to make money.
Yeah I think he's just trolling.
That is fair, dollars aren't real money. Gold, which is *the* money, behaves this way. We would be lucky if dollars behaved the same way instead of all our collective human productivity being siphoned off the top in the form of interest payments. I definitely meant money and not modern day fiat when I used the term dollars above. Thanks for pointing that out.

**Edit**: I have to reiterate though, spending doesn't create value in and of itself. However increased adoption as a result of spending would attract more value to the space. But this meme that spending money is what gives it value is just something we say to keep our inflationary debt bubble alive :)
Yes: TenX. 'Absolutely no fees' to the spender.
sure and who knows.  but it would be super lame imo.  Facebook needs to die and a new social media platform needs to take over
you realize to hit a million it has to hit $400k first lol :P
Most of my trades have 1 limit (opening) and 1 market (stop loss). I usually move my stop losses like a trailing stop instead of taking profits along the way.

Thought of moving to BitMex for that but didn't want to buy BTC to trade there so i stayed in Kraken.
Yeah, I've been pretty happy with them lately. I wonder why they haven't switched the main site to the cryptowach interface yet, though.
> there are stop losses that don't trigger?

isn't bitmex well-known for this?
Ok. Let me correct the wording. Just because it  will trigger it does not mean that it can execute at the given limit price (i assume some offset from trigger price) in the case of a stop limit order. Especially if the order is placed at the moment of trigger, since it will be at the end of the queue. 

Edit: Are you suggesting that stop loss with limit order is guaranteed to be filled? Hope not...
Ok I wasn't aware of that and was being overly USA-centric.
Yes Bitcoin is considered property by the IRS.  And it's considered a commodity by the CFTC.  And the SEC doesn't just consider it property either.
lol ya basically. if I were watching from afar I'd probably staying away even more because it's shown twice now that it can't handle itself
no idea, just saying I don't think anything could really kick start a long-term bull run right now except great news/some fundamental change in btc

we could do a *run-up* though, ya know 
I'm a long term bull, but keep in mind there is no bottom but faith in math and our understanding of it. I think you have to be prepared to survive a real test of faith. If that happens, just walk away for a while and you'll be fine as long as you weren't gambling with your cold stack.
I agree, this is the point people start getting nervous about missing/shorting the bottom.

I do think the bottom is in sight (anything lower than 324 ETH would be extremely surprising considering how long things went sideways there)
it's because it's trending finally, for some reason people refuse to acknowledge it 
Ummm I know? What are you getting at?

Edit: also look at my post below

Edit2: aww I see, that downvote provides a very thorough explanation 
Not a worry and no apologies necessary whatsoever. 

I also clearly appreciate the irony that you raised comparing my comments against the number of upvotes.  Then again, the upvotes could just as easily have come from a community appreciative (even if disagreeing) of the measured nature of the post itself which was a goal. But who's to know. Be well Sloppy.
my thoughts on why many people would be averse to shorting:

1. if they are American, it requires either using Kraken, or BitMEX via VPN, which is understandably uncomfortable.  Otherwise, if you aren't bullish and aren't willing to short, the best you can do is sit on the sidelines, not making money.
2. shorting requires trading and making decisions that may turn out to be very incorrect.  It is probably easier to buy, sit back, and hope you get a moon lambo.
More money for us, I guess.  I don't understand it either.

And yes I would much have a compelling reason to go long and see the crypto space start to recover and grow again.  However, that is unlikely to happen until "return to the mean" and we are a few thousand $s above that at the moment.


Ha you'll definitely speak miles better French than me! 
What you *think* it's worth and how you *feel* about a certain price has no bearing on the market. Nothing is stopping people to sell below 6k. Sure, this could be the bottom, but I've heard that countless times since 12k.
lulz
Okay so you're saying miners are rich and are basically going to re accumulate the coins they sold high now that theyre cheaper. that makes sense.

the only thing is, if the market don't want em, it's gonna tank. and then they just wasted a bunch of money attempting to prop up prices for a market that wants to go down in the end anyway

not to mention, I highly doubt miners can prop up the entire market. 

but I at least get what you're saying now- that they will reinvest profits from selling all of 2017 in order to prop the price. was that so hard :P
No I actually didn't comment to you before this but I was saying that I disagreed with something(cant remember what exactly) you said and asked for clarification on it and why you believed it.

I honestly cant remember and couldn't find the comment with a quick search so I thought I'd reply just to let you know I did try and figure out WTF this is about but I've slept and been to work since so there aint much chance of that happening now...
lol idek if he's ESL or not so I can't really get justifiably irritated. 

but I've seen him comment before, he's just rude to anyone who isn't explicitly bullish, long or buying

it's like...OK. or wait no its like "And?? What do you want to say?" 

😂
That’s some basic stuff there you are blatantly ignoring.

Hey there, hot stuff! If you *really* want to be pinup material, though, you have to be loquacious like our pal /u/SloppySynapses....
Lol. I'm like 2x net short at 6130 on Sept. Was busy and missed that drop, plan was to kill half of it somewhere around 6k :-\
depends on price action, but my targets have been $5.5k, 5k, and 4.5k.

I'd probably close at $6.9k+ if we got there too, hopefully i'd have closed before then
Everything else being equal (eg no fundamental change in the mechanics/population behind BFX reported shorts) the price dropping without shorts increasing is the absolute best thing for the market in terms of ownership turnover.

At the risk of erroneous anecdote extrapolation, it makes me think of a friend I rent office space from (hosting mining equipment). He bought BTC at $7k, Eth at $300 (right before the huge run up the bastard), and XRP at .75 (I told him not to).He's underwater on BTC right now, Eth is approaching his purchase levels, and XRP has some ugly percentages next to it. He's not on any exchanges where he can short, and while he *said* he only put in some funny money to see what would happen, part of me expects that he (and his wife) could look at things and say 'you know, we can still get out at just over break even'.

Maybe I should swing by to tinker on one of the machines today.
Gotcha. Thanks. Also good job collecting data from bitmex. I haven't deployed yet although too started working on it.
Babies are probably pretty tender too
Netherlands, but I might just cross borders for a steak dinner, or Schnitzel ;)
I think most people will be caught with their pants down when things finally do turn around. Yes, they will make more money trading 5-10% swings on the way down, but will lose it all when they FOMO back in, sell the dip, and FOMO back in again. These two actions come with the same personality. A very few will be rewarded for their shrewdness, but I believe most will just lower their coin count.

Where else can you hold value outside of "the system"?
Peeked
most people fear getting in on the trend too late- especially when it comes to downwards movement. this entire market is insanely bullish, people don't *believe* that crypto/btc could ever have a strong, sustained downtrend without some sort of large, obvious reason like mt. gox or something.

they will wait until bad news comes out to sell instead of realizing that you don't need any darn good reason to sell other than "the trend is down"

they don't want to short the bottom but they don't really want to buy either - except for local bottoms, so...unless someone is planning on accumulating + propping the price up, this will just take its sweet time bleeding.

a bunch of ICOs and miners accumulated btc and have a shit ton to sell.
Orders placed, let’s see what happens.

You doing something similar? 
Not with the same capabilities to authenticate data and record immutable transactions, etc. Do you not see any future for blockchain tech outside of Bitcoin? If I didn't, I'd exit crypto entirely. 
Ha! They rarely "fade out of existence". What usually happens is they fall of the top 100 into "goblin town", become overwhelmingly ownership centralized, maybe a couple of 51% attacks ("but everything's OK now"). A few vocal bag holders are left. They will never again enter the top 10-20.

Maybe they have a few pseudoscience leaders (ETH with Vitalik) that keeps this from happening for quite some time... You're better off just buying what BTC you can afford, go away and do something else for a few years... But this is a trading sub so that's not a popular opinion.

edit: grammer
If they paid money to support the price, they would increase their exposure and risk for undetermined results and have no income. A business can't do that.
Why would they  do that though? 

Why not just...not mine...?
true but to sell out to Mark Zuckerberg?  Cmon that would be the lamest story in crypto history.  Crypto is creating an entire new industry that could easily make Facebook irrelevant.  To sell the company to FB would defeat the purpose of even building the company in the first place.  Of course, just my opinion, and perhaps ill be wrong.  But Crypto is all about disrupting everything and FB is the old model.  Im looking forward to the decentralized version of social media.  In addition Coinbase has and is making acquisitions of its own.  My bet is this is just a fake click bait rumor.  Either way though it shouldn't matter to me as an investor in Bitcoin
> That is fair, dollars aren't real money.

Dollars are absolutely real money. It's the primary unit of account in the world, the most stable value of all generally accepted currencies, and acts as a medium of exchange in the world's top economies. 

> spending money is what gives it value is just something we say

No, it's not even that, because you're saying it wrong. *The ability to spend money* is what gives it value. The fact that you **can** exchange Bitcoin (or USD or EUR or Gold or Silver or Sea Shells) for goods and services is what gives it value. Social consensus as to what medium can be used for exchange is what imbues any particular medium, fiat or asset backed, digital or physical, with value. Historical acceptance and scarcity (artificial or natural) are of themselves, not enough to create a useful and valuable currency. Adoption, whether actual or anticipated, is what gives value.
Ok, that seems to come close to it, but you still pay the visa/mastercard foreign exchange fee. With revolut, you don't
Sure, the first time
I thought so myself a while back but Mike said he's never experienced it and he's moving around quite a bit more xbt than me so I figured if his stops work mine will lol 
They have not set it to be the same as a stock or security so I am using my best judgment and guidance from all government sites to be on the up and up. If they change it or clarify, I will abide by that too. 
What do you mean finally, its been trending for a month 
I'm not downvoting people with different opinions than mine. I'm not sockpupppet.

I see accumulation (I'm long biased), you probably see distribution (you're short biased). I don't think this is a point worth debating.
That's a very, very good point that I couldn't quite express until now. Hmm. interesting thanks :) 

Hope to see more of your comments around! Promise I won't use em for my commentary! 
yea I'm learning that the hard way.  i thought if anything the bear market would be no lower than 10k.  
That’s enough for me.  Goodnight.  
yep, I agree, it's more *how* he asks than *what* he's asking. 
Yep😁👍
No I'm not. I cut the corners of candles because they don't matter. I'm only posting this shit to help people. I'm very experienced with TA. 
And we've established you have no friends
Your comment is incorrect, rude, and adds nothing. 
Ironic..he could save others from their lack of self awareness but not himself 
I think you're still fine. I also have a 1x short on September at 6092 with adds up to 6200 to 2x short. BTC/BTC makes this pretty confusing, I should be *effectively* net 0.5x long right now. I have a short and a long and the short is exactly twice the size of the long, and the short is equal in dollar value to my current wallet balance. I'm asking for trouble with this shit. 
Is there any particular reason to close at $6.9k?
I could be totally wrong but only breaking into our big triangle would make me think about possible reversal.
Former support is about $7.3k right now and is moving up.
Am I missing something here?

Hella tender.
Downtrends tend to go lower than expected in volatile markets as do uptrends... many sold at $8k on the way up because it seemed insanely high at the time... I think the same can and probably will happen here on the downside.  There really isn't as much 'negativity' as one would expect at a market bottom.  This doens't mean we don't see another uptick in the short term.

At this point, these things will take a long time to manifest (months being a long time in BTC world) as volatility has decreased and it's looking to be another slow bleed until we either revert to the mean or the market turns around due to a now unknown event catalyst.  It's very likely we have at least one more capitulation event before a turn around.  We already breached the prior low in Feb.


Gold, land.
Actually I do give credit to BTC for that, however, the need and desire for that isn’t mainstream enough for it to tap into a major source of ongoing funds. It fits more within a crypto “asset class” and probably wouldn’t pull a percentage of 401ks unless it was part of a larger investable schema.

That is why I see almost a need for other value add real world use blockchain projects to be making money so that they can be part of that and have some gravity, and legitimacy. As long as the main crypto space includes dentacoin I don’t see it happening. 
(nervous smile), corrected...
Thank you
You think miners are holding a shit ton of BTC? What makes you think that?
I'm currently 1x short on September futures @ 6096 (futures at 6121 currently). I have adds up to 2x short by 6250 (on futures). Bailing on a break of 6350 on spot. 
Seriously? Of coarse postgres can do that and it's been doing it for a long time.

Now if the question is can it do it in an adversarial environment it gets a bit more complicated but solvable. You have to look at how it's secured.

Maybe an easy example is to try to alter this reddit post. You can't, so it's "immutable". It's also "distributed" on reddit's database cluster and backup systems. And "decentralized" because I can just go to facebook and talk to my dotcomrades.

Use the right tool for the right job. For programmable money BTC and it's layers makes sense. If you're not here for that I think you're in the wrong place.
Yea, setting the bar of scrutiny VERY high for alts is important. They will suffer from severe skepticism, which is well deserved. 

IMO the most irritating thing to emerge from all of this uneducated speculation in the alt market is the concept of governance being OK; POS, DPOS have emerged as holding top spots because "blockchain", but the lesson of decentralized and immutable is lost. If it doesn't need that decentralized trustless ledger it doesn't need blockchain, you can do it with a database or cloud platform. 
Sure because no one has ever taken out a loan to purchase btc.
Because you can use the fiat loan to maintain mining and then stop selling btc into the market; eventually supply and demand will balance.  

If the terms of the loan are that you don't have to even start to pay it back for say, 16mo, then you take the risk that your coins will be worth magnitudes more and the loan today is minimal.  
 Currency, sure, but absolutely not money. USD is a horrible store of value - it is guaranteed to lose value, and loses the vast majority of its purchasing power over any long time frame. 
Only merchants pay the visa/mastercard infrastructure processing fee
I hear you man. I dont use bitmex so haven't ever seen it myself just what I've heard. I'll bet chewy would know more.
You are probably ok, but if they want to fuck with you, they will....because that's what they do, especially with crypto.
after ranging for 4 
Fair enough, my apologies 
No I actually 100% agree with you that accumulation is currently happening.

I just trade some of my stack on the shorter time frames and was referring to this 3-6 day movement
night mate sorry for the misunderstanding
You are right. Thanks
You can't say something doesn't matter just because it doesn't fit with a pattern you want to see. If candle close/open prices don't matter and candle wicks don't matter, why the hell are you using a candle chart? That's literally all the information the chart provides.
what else doesn't matter?
I bet he's in MS. 9th grade at most
he's an anti-bitcoin troll, who clearly either can't comprehend the technology/finical aspect or more likely just missed the boat and is now jelly.
Yeah, I'm really close to sell and move to USD trading until this reverses. Too much effort in protecting the value of wallet just to see it dropping more :-\
BTW, you saw 4h? We're doing same as yesterday but steps are up now.
I'd actually need to simply think about it more- but I would probably close some at ~$6600. I said $6900+ because that was our last local high in this range
No disagreement here. I can totally see $2k, I can see $3k. Under $2k would be interesting, not sure how confident I'd feel there.
to answer your question for why traders are longing:

we have been on an aggressive downtrend for like 7 weeks now which some see as an indicator of a relief rally soon, we are right around our former lows, and the r/r of buying/longing and simply selling/closing on a new low is decent. 


totally anecdotal but honestly it's not hard to believe. someone on twitter said they talked to miners and they were accumulating + selling less than 100% of their mined coins before Nov 2017

after Nov 2017 they started selling more than 100% of their mined coins; i.e., selling their accumulated coins from pre-Nov 2017 and all of their newly mined coins
Did you just go long as well?
but why...? why not just buy bitcoin if mining is less profitable...it would literally be cheaper...
Maybe you're under the impression that miners as a whole are a single entity? Actually, mining is done by many separate businesses. If one of those started to buy coins, it would essentially support its competitors who can then continue to sell at a higher price.
> USD is a horrible store of value... loses the vast majority of it's purchasing power over any long time frame

The USD has kept it's value better than any other modern currency. Further. it also [doesn't actually lose value when you use it as a store of value](https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5289406c6da8111f72d3d976-480-270.jpg). That's the point.
I am talking about the foreign exchange rate, for people paying in other currencies than US dollars. Visa/mastercard charge a fee for the conversion.  It's not that high (i think around 0.5%) but it's a fee.  Anyway TenX looks like a good alternative.
Yep, I'm sure they'll find a way to kick us again soon. The govt always wins.
any time, brotha - keep fighting the good fight ;)
The thing is, you *can* still draw it as a falling wedge accurately: https://www.tradingview.com/x/7ZoRsFDn/  

It just doesn't look quite so "strong"  

Also it doesn't fit the volume profile of a falling wedge, but since /u/KevuElRevu is very experienced with TA, he's probably right and we'll be at 7300 in no time. 
nothing matters
So according to you I’m a Realestate shill, and turns out you are a bitcoin shill lol 
Yeah, this is laughable 
Right now... despite how bearish it is... I don't think we'll move below $2k...

I'm long term bullish... DCA'ing between here and wherever the bottom happens to be, baring some massive black swan event, is likely to pay big dividends over the next few years.  Crypto isn't going away.


I had some knife catching orders hit on June on the wick down. I wasn't going to add them to the bot, but realized it was a decent order size, so I might as well. Truthfully I don't like any of my current entries, and I'm in (tiny) net profit across them so I might just close out everything and wait for a clearer target. 
Yep take out a loan or use reserves and buy too.  There is your bottom...from miners. 
I think it’s safe to assume the largest operations can and do stay in contact.  

What you are describing is what can simply be called market consolidation.  Happens all the time.  
Comparing a currency to another currency does not make it money.  No fiat currency is money.  That chart also uses government inflation figures, which are absurdly understated...look at the hedonic adjustments they put into those numbers. 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/Sfv4epoY/

much simpler to draw it as a channel, which is much more accurate imo
Agreed. If you squint the pattern is there, but the volume makes me think you're just blindly looking for hopium if you're really putting much stock in it.
It's a shame...but you're right
This is exactly what I'm doing... buy all the way down. Best of luck friend.
and what happens when the market just keeps selling? they just end up holding way, way heavier bags...

doesn't make sense m8
> No fiat currency is money.

Right, and this is where you disagree with most of modern economics.

> That chart also uses government inflation figures, which are absurdly understated...

No more (or less) absurd than failing to consider the effect of population growth, the creation of new technology, the inability (and inelasticity) of the money supply creation when dealing with non-digital asset backed currencies, and the fact that the supply is entirely abdicated to idiosyncratic non-market forces...

> look at the hedonic adjustments they put into those numbers.

I do. I teach economics at the college level right now, and the flaws in inflation calculations (and GPD and unemployment) are something we cover in my introductory economics class. That doesn't make them completely useless, it just means their biased, and a biased indicator can still be useful (for that discussion you'll want to take an econometrics class).

It also doesn't mean that an digital asset backed currency (eg, crypto with state channels) is bad or can't replace current monetary systems. Indeed, cryptocurrencies resolve some of the fundamental problems that a central bank creates *and* resolves the biggest problems that traditional asset backed currencies (the gold standard) face. They're a Very Good Thing™, and the next evolution in economic policy under a number of assumptions.
That's what I had as well (if you saw my top level post). 
Same to you!
I’d bet the operations up in the mountains in China are big enough market makers that they can create a floor. 
Yes, I do disagree with modern economics.  Keynsian economics has failed again and again.  I believe the only reason it is still used is that it supports the existence of a much larger government than would otherwise be possible.

You are correct that government inflation is not completely useless.  However, I believe there is good evidence that real interest rates have been negative for many years now, meaning that USD does not hold its value over the longer term (although it is certainly a short-term store of value).  Something like gold, while volatile, tracks inflation over the long term, and is a much better store of value.
I did skimmed it though I'm exhausted...been up all night need to sleep 

gnight :O
sure but for how long...? they'd have to have a reason otherwise they're delaying the inevitable
The failings of Keynesian economics are only tangentially related to the efficacy of a Fiat base monetary system versus an asset monetary system.

> The only reason it's still used is it supports the existence of a much larger government than would otherwise be possible.

As opposed to the Tiffin Dilemma, which the gold standard faced (but bitcoin or another crypto currency would not)?

> Real interest rates have been negative, meaning that the USD does not hold it's value long term

Yes I do believe I linked a chart previously in this thread that showed that simply holding onto dollars will lose purchasing power over time, while holding your dollars in 3-month t-bills will outperform inflation significantly. 


This is by design. It reflects societal acceptance of the fundamental nature of scarcity. Not using resources incurs an opportunity cost, and this is true under asset-backed or fiat monetary systems.  The two are mathematically equivalent if we assume an efficient market (the best case scenario). Fiat changes the reference point, and makes that opportunity cost salient through publicly stated inflationary monetary policies. As markets with humans are less efficient than theoretical models, making such costs salient improves decision-making. 
The inevitable what? 10x raise in price?

You’ve effectively took out a cheap loan and accumulated btc at a faster rate. Yes you’ve racked up some short term debt but in 16mo the btc you’ve accumulated is worth much more than your fiat debt is holding you back.  

Yes there is a risk associated with it.  Btc never rebounds but so far btc track record is 100%.  Yes 100%.  That’s isn’t much risk for a lot of reward so far.  
im actually just confused now

what are you suggesting? miners take out loans to keep mining even though prices are going down? why? do you think that miners prop up the price?

you realize they can just stop mining and not have an effect on the price, right? 


Really?  Isn’t the impetus of their whole conversation that miners can prop up the price if it drops below the cost to mine?

Are you just fucking with me?
but...why do they have to be miners...they can just buy btc...

not only *can* they but they would *have* to to prop up the price.

are you fucking with *me*? are you under the assumption that miners determine btc price or something?
The miners create the floor. Not the mining rigs. 
How? Where did you get this info from? Miners have nothing to do with propping up the price aside from *not selling* their mined coins. It has nothing to do with buying more coins or mining more coins to hold, so your solution that they take out a loan to ... mine more? Makes 0 sense. 
I can’t. I just can’t.  Never mind. 
Dude don't act like it's me lmao you have no idea what's going on

You keep saying miners will support the price and create a floor. How? Explain that in 1 sentence. Should be easy to do
Ok
