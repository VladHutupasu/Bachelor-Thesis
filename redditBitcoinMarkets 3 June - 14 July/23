Where is this stupid "hurr dur muh deluded bulls/bears" meme coming from? Why not just focus on non bias trend strategies so we all can make money O_o

This is not a football cheerleading contest
I swear to god I'm not making this up, but as I sit watching the order books, I'm also reading an e-book and the [next chapter title genuinely got a laugh out of me.](https://imgur.com/a/OZT5THh)
See ya fellas, it's been fun. This past week I have been mirroring /u/Stokinator 's trades, and as a result I have no choice but to file for bankruptcy.
Howdy.

Following up from my post [yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8souh7/daily_discussion_thursday_june_21_2018/e132ny3)

I shorted the breakdown of our flag within the channel @ 6400, as was the plan:

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/IGqDdg67/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/IGqDdg67/)

I just closed at $6k. Nice profit, but not nearly as much as my portfolio lost (position size was not huge). Also closed my small eth short $525 --> $450.

The channel obviously leaves the price with a lot of room to move downward. \*\***However**\*\*, all of those that are incredulous that a $6k breach didn't leave to a massive breakdown immediately I will say this:

We had to move -10&#37; to -15&#37;  *just to get here*. I am not surprised at all that it bounced here (even temporarily), nor that it overshot the $6k support before doing so (the market tends to do this...). I opened a long OKEX futures at $5850 and $5900 for this reason alone, and to play what I feel like was an impending bounce.  I've already tapered off my positions since that buy for a small profit, but I will not be surprised to see chop/bounces in this area.

That being said, a medium/long term position here (in any direction) is terrible from a risk/reward standpoint. There shouldn't be any doubt that a visit to the bottom of the channel is in play ($5k-$5.2k). Similarly, a huge bounce to the upper trendline of the channel ($6400-$6600) is absolutely a possibility. Both could happen in the near term.

At the risk of getting chopped up, I'm going to play support/resistance in this area after what should be market exhaustion (aka, -12&#37; down on the day, overshoot support a bit, volume on a small recovery, get in and get out quickly). Small positions. I don't think there is very intelligent trade reasoning in either direction to hold trades in this area for more than a few hours, or more than 2-4&#37; moves (unless you have a crystal ball, of course).

Happy trading out there folks.
i want to get off mr.bones wild ride
Pretty decent spike on coindays destroyed yesterday, both BTC & BCH.

https://fork.lol/blocks/cdd

Seems like a sizeable long-term holder decided to exit. Would explain the spot selling rather than margin short increase. 
Strange that margine longs/shorts haven't changed with this drop.
Adam, Eve, Jesus, Joseph & Mary bottom.
Here's what is confounding to me; in typical financial markets, I am used to seeing short sellers pile up when prices approach a peak after a period of markup, becoming 'expensive' at some point AND when oscillators are overbought.  With BTC, the short sellers seemed to pile up AFTER all of major price movement downward has already taken place, when oscillators are already oversold.  Isn't this just ass backwards?  This is a recipe for a short squeeze since bull divergences will cascade and build up from here on out and NOW there are tons more shorts to fuel such a squeeze. 
The one time I didn’t listen to chew n the gang...
I am exactly not sure what to make of the price action; I was convinced if 6k breached there would be immediate pandemonium/cascade of long closing.  But it seems this drop was precipitated by shorts opening and not because of an organic, genuine 'panic' selling.  This is more akin to the doldrums that is found during an accumulation period - meaning the bottom is very close to being found.  It feels like a day in the office after 6k breached; it's as though no one is concerned enough to continue selling except short sellers.
I've..become so numb
I'll save y'all some time: your order could not be submitted.
Interesting is that the lower we go the lower the predictions become.
For you bears out there, where is your long entry point, if there is one? Is it a number you've already decided on, or what other factors are you looking for?

Stopped out of my small long today. Feels like 6k is coming down this weekend.
My take on alts dropping faster than BTC:

There's some amount of money invested in the crypto space, and that total dollar value has been trending down since January. Prior to 2018, we had alts rising while BTC fell, then BTC rising while alts fell.  The overall crypto value was increasing during this time, with people moving their money back and forth.  A small drop in BTC, due to it's high market cap, freed up tons of money to put into alts. When they got overextended, they'd fall and money would move back into BTC. The strongest example of this is BTC vs BCH.

But now all of these guys are trading together.  Alts are down a larger percentage than BTC. Any amount of money flowing out of these alts causes a larger drop than the same amount flowing out of BTC.  This feels like comparing large cap stocks to penny stocks - the latter are more volatile.  But overall, there's money flowing out of crypto in general. This isn't the same as 2017 when people kept their money in crypto, but moved it to another coin (or tether).
Well, it seems like it was a fakeout. I closed at 6030 thinking 6k would break, and it did, but now here we are at 6130 with shorts through the roof and longs closing out. Even on a drop, shorts will have to cover which will provide BTC with a nice cushion. A few hours ago I thought we were going to 5.4k but now I'm not so sure. Regardless I'm out of position and I will stay that way. These past few months have not been kind to me and I would like to have as much capital as possible before the next bull run. If 6k holds through July then I'll be entering a low leverage long on Dec futures. 

BTC, never change.
On the 13th, we had the same amount of shorts as we do today at roughly the same price levels.  Yet the prevailing idea is that this will continue beneath the lows.  The only difference today is that we are more oversold now than on the 13th.
Added an additional $250k @ $6044 to my $250k long @ $6378 posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8sydvj/z/e13k4pc).

New position: $500k @ $6211. Happier with this entry, glad I decided to slowly scale into the position. 
First short position on Bitmex was closed at $6495. Opened @ $6720. Finally glad to be doing it live instead on the testnet. 

Switched up my crypto trading strategy over the last few days and am loading up on some alts that I believe in and am holding long term. All of my trading will be focused on Bitmex rather than the cycling through alts as I had been doing for the last year and a half. 
well I got stopped out overnight at $6,478. Seems to be repeating the old pattern, dump hard, then weak bounce, then dump hard again. If it follows the pattern, we'll probably see consolidation in the $6,300-$6,400 range for a bit before another attempt at $6,000

So my guess is that we'll probably be going through $6,000 either today or by the end of the weekend
 
$7,000 I'd say is the new short term FOMO target for people

Feels like the reverse of $10k right now.
We just broke $6k ☹️
Hmm, in the last 4 hours, shorts up 15% while the price only down another 2%.  Most of the shorts are really late comers to the last 24 hours of activity, they barely increased at all during most of today's fall.

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/ZgP5LYKx/
Hmmm, bullish.
LONG with everything @ $6000

https://www.mtgox.com/img/pdf/20180622_announcement_en.pdf

Won't be enough to halt the downward momentum, but implies no further Gox dumps will happen in the immediate future
Look at this entry : https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8rwmpx/daily_discussion_monday_june_18_2018/e0votfo/?context=0

Fucking disgusting, zero thinking or planning. Pure stupidity but i got lucky. Closed 16.6% of position at 6488 and another 29.16% at  6512.

Now i have 54% position left and im seriously considering just closing it in some profit whilst i can to be over and done with this trade.

Any thoughts? Also, how do you do partial closes on the bot thing?

EDIT: holding on for now. Profit taking over night (limit stops) have freed up enough capital to let me hedge long on futures if we dump. moved stops to be in profit and watching this very closely https://www.tradingview.com/x/2jA3SGVt/
An update to my morning TA post...

- We have now broken firmly below the the 4 hour Ichimoku cloud to the downside. Unfortunately we also broke down through the 4hour Kijun which was at the same place as the trend support line from 13th June. So that's a pisser

http://imgur.com/9L1cbHq

- Our 4hour Wavetrend has now definitively crossed to the negative with plenty of space to fall in to. The daily Wavetrend is now right on the cusp of crossing to the negative... now there's not a ton of space for it to fall into but certainly enough to break the lows

- The daily MACD is now aiming towards a cross after today's fall in price and isn't too far from the cross itself

- The daily MACD is in a big triangle since the ATH as you can see here http://imgur.com/7vmo6JU
It's reaching a decision point very soon, once we cross either or up or down we should get some decent movement either way. Each time this year when we've broken the line it's been a good move. 

- The 4hour RSI has now broken down through the trendline we have held since 11th June http://imgur.com/2YuLPjP

*** Ok so the important numbers to watch for now

- 6120 (Binance) that was the low on 13th June
- 6000... the big one

I said earlier if we broke through 6450 I thought we were really in the shit, at the moment it's certainly not looking good but we'll wait and see if we get a decent technical bounce back up soon. 

There is still air in terms of support until 6120 and then 6000.



Over reacting now. Slowly adding
Like watching a car crash in slow motion.
I've taken half the potential profits of a short from 6700, including a little bit of scalping on the way down lowering the ca to about 6500.  The size of the position is still just under what it originally was. 

Keeping it open because well, this could still keep going.  But stops are close at around 6200 to protect the rest (can always reopen).  I put the stops there considering I almost closed the position at the previous leg, since it was the primary target for the RR on this one.

But... I just couldn’t resist scaling into a long down here:

!long xbtu18 5899 10X 75%

If I bail on it below the current channel, it’ll hopefully just be a dent in the short. (though market closing below here is sketchy, too likely to catch the bottom of the wick)

GDAX and Bitstamp didnt make a new low yet vs february though Bitfinex did. I’m guessing that’s what’s keeping this up still.
With the comment volume spiking today after a week of scarcity, there should be a B-Band indicator for comments
Tether is about to be top 10
Just bought back in. Tethered in late May. Fuck it.
[deleted]
As long as we remain above $6000, we're still in a raging bull market since 6th February!
I think this is the alt armageddon that we’ve been waiting for. The alt bleed is pretty severe.
*gurgle gurgle gurgle* fucking bears! *gurgle gurgle gurgle* 

Hooo boy I should probably cut this sucker soon, managed to average down a bit but still around 6% underwater. If this goes under $5,900 I'll know this is some next level shit. Liquidation is deep into goblintown, so not worried about that (yet). 
Things are not like expected:

- 6k was broken, people expected margin call, sell off, panic sell. However the bottom was only $5910 which is pretty weird. Considering the active selling pressure from $6200 to break the 6k.

- The orderbook after 6k broken was so thin, anyhow "dump" money went in and bought all the selling pressure.

- Now price is above 6k with RSI div for daily chart.

Not recommend anyone to open Long, but I do not think it is wise to open Short here.
I see the "analyst X predict price Z in timeframe Y" articles popping up again in all media, I have only one comment to that and it's show me your gains or be silent

This quote from Trading in the Zone summarize it well:

"Why do you think unsuccessful traders are obsessed with market analysis. **They crave the sense of certainty that analysis appears to give them.** Although few would admit it, the truth is that the typical trader wants to be right on every single trade. He is desperately trying to create certainty where it just doesn’t exist"

Jinkies. 
This is such a tease. It gets close to my set targets and I'm all ready to pull the trigger and then it's a false alarm and I back the fuck away.

One thing crypto has certainly taught me is "patience". 

This is truly one heck of a thrill. 
How come the volume around 6000 is so low?
calling it now... this is the Mt. Gox bottom to mirror the Mt. Gox top!
Has anyone ever met anyone from this Sub Reddit In person?

Meeting up with someone from here ( not saying who) sometime in Mid July. 

If I dont make it back alive. I love you guys. 
I was more active here back in 2014-2016

And I would like to point out how we have over 1000 commenters in this thread. That's amazing to me. Back in my day, after 200-300 or so comments, the thread would push to a new sticky'd daily thread, with a link to the previous.

Some people might get pretty emotional and keep trying to revenge trade back their losses. Just don't.

Look for the big picture https://imgur.com/a/apRcei5 

Long $250k @ $6378. May add to the position. Expecting a short term pullback, will close during the chop. I don't see us leaving this range quite yet. 
Investopedia just sent out an article called "5 ways to short bitcoin" to its subscribers. Buy signal.
Bitcoin goes up $200 and /r/bitcoinmarkets be like "oh wow didn't think it would bounce so hard"

Bitcoin drops half a grand the same day and everyone says "that's okay, at least it's not below $5k yet"
This broke the diagonal support of the past nine days. 
I'm sorry guys but it broke down. Interesting, again, the alt movement preceded the bitcoin one.
Only possible optimism could be that it looks like we are in the process of forming an inverted hammer at what could be the bottom of a downtrend.

If that were to be the case it could signal potential reversal when the weekly closes, that's the only optimism I can see.
How much bitcoin would I need to buy in order for the price to go back up? 
Volume is picking up nicely again!
Hate to clutter up the thread with a shit comment right now, but I'm leaving out to Mexico in a few hours.  Parked in fiat at $6650, but just in case I need to make any moves, I wanted to know if I can use GDAX down there.  It's not on the list of approved countries, but as long as I've been verified as a US customer, anyone know if I will still be able to access the site?

Not much to report, just patiently waiting for 1D ma to cross. The feeling of 95% fiat and just do small big leverage margin trades is nice and help you focus your trading strategy a lot
I meant to build up a short position starting around $6700, but I just started back to med school this week, and didn't want to open up a leveraged position until I had time to sit down and get a feel for the market. Sad I missed out, but I guess you can't be a part of every trade.

I'm not even going to pretend I'm not gambling here, but I Just opened up a long on Sept futures at $6070 since they were trading at an $80 discount. I don't see many signs of reversal yet, with a lower low and no capitulation wick, alts lower than they were at the last visit to $6100 a few days ago, and the long vs. short ratio surprisingly higher than it was on the last visit to $6100 a few days ago. I'm sure I'll have to DCA on the way down, but I'm expecting a bounce around $5800 if it breaks down from here. Color me unconvinced of this position, but I figure I'll at least make a small bet on this long-term wedge/fractal just in case: [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/UMMK51Yq-Potential-Fractal/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/UMMK51Yq-Potential-Fractal/).

I may bail on this trade in a few minutes if this continues to look weak, and I'm sure it'll be a super quick scalp unless things turn around quickly. I just wanted to make a small bet on this formation just in case. However, signs are pointing to a short-term reversal coming soon. Whether that's here or closer to $5800, who knows, but these quick dumps are actually making me feel less confident in a slow bleed all the way down.

!long XBTU18 6070 10x 25&#37;
So this is what death by a thousand cuts feels like huh :p
Shorts increase on the build up.   Going for those inverse dips.
This marked another instance where alts dumping hard were a canary while BTC stagnated
Anyone else think this is going to dump hard on the weekend?
Hello all, wanted to give a quick shout out of appreciation to this sub. I've learned quite a bit since investing at near ATH last year, and I accredit a lot of that to Reddit and specifically r/BitcoinMarkets. I actuallly managed to make money despite the bear market, and even though I'm still down it's looking good from here. Thanks!
I'll repost it as toplevel:

Support is at 5.6k now as ATH downtrend line and 5k horizontal as last resistance before sick bull run.

We never dropped back below 5k after we broke it. This is the last bastion that I could think of that could make a reversal. If it breaks (convincingly, we could wick below it)... Well... A lot of long-time holders will be put to a test after seeing their sub 5k entries, that were green for last 9 months and generated almost 5x returns at tops, are turning red...
Don't worry, McAfee says this is going to $1 million per btc.
lets just get this over with. I would rather see the price plummet now than make false breakout attempts and then slow bleed. The only thing that scares me is that after this region there isnt really a tested support line that we can call a potential bottom.
From at a TA perspective, do repeated failures to break below 6k ever signal anything, or is it always going to be "the big bear flag from the ATH broke down so we are going to 4k?"
I was expecting panic and a large sell off after we broke 6k....

Can anyone explain why that didn't happen?
2am: Wake up to raccoon trying to get into my attic. "Oh the funding rate flipped, I'll just adjust my hedges."

*places bids, places asks.*

Bid ladder immediately fills. Ask ladder disappears over the horizon. 

18 hours later I'm still desperately adjusting order ladders, trying to benefit from a bounce that never comes while trying to avoid liquidation. Holy moly, I've been through this before but you just expect the dumpage to cease at some point.

TA on the dump.
 [VolumeRSI (VRSI) analysis, amateur TA intended to explore this odd indicator to see if it's indicative of market trend in a low volume, BART driven market.](https://www.marketvolume.com/technicalanalysis/volumersi.asp) 

Previous comment from earlier in the week: 

Would love any input or criticism or re-interpretation of any point I make. 

Observations:

* Weekly & monthly VRSI are still at historic lows;
* Weekly VRSI has climbed from a low of \~36 up to \~39. Note that below 50 is still considered a 'buy area', whilst <30 is strictly oversold. 
* BTC has *never* been into oversold on the weekly or monthly, and this is the lowest it has ever been on both time-frames.
* As before, I'm still expecting more pain (Don't fight against the trend) but don't think there's much more room below us. the VRSI oversold territory would kick in around 5.4k if anyone is curious;
* I noted that the last major dump from 7.4k to 6.6k was accompanied by a large amount of buying pressure. There's a [lot less this time](https://imgur.com/a/nVBJj4E). Accordingly, I expect us to test the \~6.1k/6k support levels.

tl;dr: still expecting goblin town, but not the cataclysmic goblin town some are expecting. A quick jaunt to goblin town as it were. 
Here we are then friends, knocking on 6.1k and probably 6k in a few minutes.

*I can practically smell goblin town.*
Damn, my garbage disposal was giving me trouble when I got home from work and I thought I was having a rough day, but some of you guys seem to be having it a little worse.

I managed to fix it though if you guys were wondering 
I used to enjoy reading this and everyones opinions, but right now you guys are being ridiculous. The price drops $200 and suddenly crypto is going to collapse forever? I'm not saying this isn't the bottom but I used this sub to escape r/CryptoCurrency and now it feels like it's turning into it. 
For people watching volume, the volume here does not have to be higher than the last move down until we're making new lows below $5900, then we should see higher volume. 

https://twitter.com/PeterLBrandt/status/1009863083416678400

Also watching open interest still:

bitmex has gone from 70k on initially drop to $6100 to 85k on the rise to $6800 and now to 93k on the second drop to $6100. 

a 33% increase in open interest on bitmex. Lots of traders to squeeze or possible big positions opening on there.

Open interest on bfx has decreased from a high of 60,000 longs+shorts on the initial drop to $6100 to 56000 here. 


so bitmex open interest up 33%, bitfinex open interest down 6.7%

open interest is clearly my new favorite thing to watch. I wonder why bitmex is seeing such a huge spike in margin positions but bitfinex isn't. this is possible evidence for the theory of bitfinex big players moving the market to get their bitmex positions filled - the reason why barts exist. Perhaps after the BGD when we saw bitfinex shorts get squeezed they didn't like advertising their open positions on bitfinex, so they switched to mex where it's not as easy to see massive positions opening?

Even though I'm short I'm fucking sad. This is so depressing. I don't want another year of bear. I want the fun memes and waking up to a new ATH every other morning.

Repost in a prettier form from my weekly chart from earlier :
https://www.tradingview.com/x/OJ8qa3aO

TL;DR: exit all crypto

Looks like legit selling. Almost no movement in margin longs/shorts for btcusd on Bitfinex. I'm expecting a bloody weekend.
Bear flag we are painting right now is so perfect. Like from the textbook
Well, I'm out again at 6030. Took another big hit to fiat. I basically lost all of my profit for the year so I'm pretty sad but I at least live to fight another day. With 6k broken the descending triangle finally completed. Unless this reverses sometime soon and shows itself to be a complete fakeout this should take us down to 4k now. I wouldn't be surprised if we lose another 10% over the weekend and hit a temp bottom of 5.4k. I'll be looking to buy there for some more scalps. Hopefully I don't regret it again.

Edit: Also, longs haven't even budged this whole time, but we also just got 1k shorts open that are all underwater right now. This weekend should be interesting to say the least.
Wow, we almost have a bearish engulfing on the 3D chart. 
"bitFlyer Inc. responds to improvement order from Japanese Financial Services Agency" Man, that's so doublespeak-y. "Business improvement order" aka "do this or we will shut you down"
All things considered, Bitcoin is doing well at ~5% compared to pretty much everything else. I'm seeing 9-27% across the board, though the higher end is coins I've never even heard of.
Weak bounce, there are no major buy for it to break major resistance. It seems everyone is still waiting for it to go lower considering how it got stuck at 6k7. Expecting more violent drop here.
Update on my 4hr chart (RSI 23.3): https://image.ibb.co/njOaC8/2triangle4hr.png
I think my DCA will come to a close now.  I've added as much in as I'm willing to in a bear market.  I'll start it back up when the trend looks like it's reversing.
Stop on my long didn't trigger right. That's always fun.

!long xbteur 5250.1 5x 80%

Lets put that kraken wall to the test. Stop @5249.9 or @5250 if i see the wall being pulled or getting totally eaten. 
For short term target, I'm looking at ~~5700~~ edit: 5600

https://www.tradingview.com/x/jGof22uM/

Will take profits on some of my shorts whenever it touches the blue line and plan to re-short around 6k
Out of interest, how are people expecting this to end? With a v bottom and bounce or with a whimper?

My personal feeling is that it won't bounce this time but flatten out into a period of boredom at some lower price point. I am not even going to guess what that price might be
Closed most of my shorts and went long on swaps for those coming delicious funding fees, still net short but not by a lot. Expected this to break down harder. Will reshort later because this isn't the end, but it has been enough blood for one day. 
Next big green candle and all the guys panicking will call for a jump to 7300. Not even exaggerating. We broke a trend but it's not a reason to call for 5000 and beyond yet.

If you judge by the emotional rollercoaster which is going on in this sub, I doubt many people here are successful traders. This is exactly what not to do. And it's very toxic because you're contaminating others emotions as well.
going to bed with a stop loss at $6478

figure if it hits that, shit will really hit the fan
this is it...the alt culling. o_O I knew I should've gone on a shorting sprees with those babies 
That moment when I Remember December and everyone was like yeah we will see 25,000 maybe 30. Now everyone is like yeah it's going to keep falling. Don't see any reason for that to change

Maybe it will and maybe it won't but you guys have to see humor this

Restating some general commentary from below in the thread.

For anyone that does not realize where we are vs where we were, as a total market from late in the bull run of 2017, think about this.

On October 29th, 2017, Bitcoin was $5800 (close to where we are now). The total crypto market cap was $170 billion then and proceeded due north >$800 billion in early January. That is >4X in about 2 months or 24X annualized.

The total market cap today is $259 billion with BTC basically the same price as the end of October. XRP is still nearly 3X from that point in time. BCH is 2x. ETH is 1.75X.

Now I don't claim to know where the money is going to continue to flow from/to (fiat, tether, small cap Alts, big name Alts, BTC), but I think its important to note that the last time BTC was at this price range, the total market cap was much smaller ($130 billion smaller) and that personally makes me cautious yet. 

Your personal perspective on the amount of coins that will end up with a value as currency or utility (that creates a monetary incentive or some other reward to the token holder) will likely make this bother you less or more than myself. 
Oh hot dayum. That fakeout was real. Finger was hovering so close to the sell button, but I successfully resisted the urge.

Can't wait to see the massive 20m+ liquidations when it randomly decides to pump again 
Not sure why again, everyone seems so sure that it will break 6k. Every dump the same "omg 3k" crowd comes in and posts their weird comments they'll later delete. Not convinced. 
We’re awfully close to the 2018 bottom of $5800 which I don’t see holding, but I can’t predict short term. I’m only good at long term, which is easy. 

Are we finally approaching capitulation? My body is ready... the sooner we get this over with the better. Seriously guys, have fun and take advantage of this bear market. Bitcoin is fundamentally more bullish than ever before, if you don’t get that’s your loss

This whole "sub 6k doomsday" thing is overrated. All these sellers already getting completely exhausted. I still think 6k or round about that is the bottom.

Time for another installment of my rambling TA nonsense...

- We have now broke firmly out of the 4 hour Ichimoku cloud to the downside. No way to sugar coat that i'm afraid. Looks like we are currently hitting the 4hour Kijun which is in the same place as the trend support line from 13th June, sitting at 6488.

Whether this holds or not is really the big question for today, for me anyway. http://imgur.com/CEIJPTM

- We have firmly rejected crossing up through the 144WMA, not a good sign. As I said yesterday, last time we crossed through it to the upside was April 12th and that sent us to 10k.

- Worryingly we have now broken under the 2 hour 144WMA... last time we did this was 10th June and we then fell 19% in price over 3 days.

- Our 4hour Wavetrend is now firmly crossed to the negative with space to fall in to, lots of space actually, the daily Wavetrend is now aiming at a cross to the negative as well... 

- As far as I can see every MACD has crossed to the negative except the Daily, which is flat 

- The 4hour RSI has now broken down through the trendline we have held since 11th June http://imgur.com/5zLAZaN

*** Ok so the important numbers to watch for now

- 6120 (Binance) that was the low on 13th June
- 6000... the big one


If we break through down under 6450 I see nothing but air until 6120. So this really is approaching make or break time now. I see nothing unfortunately to be positive about, the odds are firmly pointing at falling in the coming days / week to retest the lows. 


$$$ Optimism Section - As of todays' date the bear market should be over if we get above 9200, that's above the daily Ichimoku Cloud and the resistance line from ATH. Of course, that's not happening right now but still figured i'd say it
[Would you long this, or go short?](https://www.tradingview.com/x/qTa3Dfst/) Permabulls would be screaming moon.
I was promised devastation upon breaking $6000. Did all the sellers fall asleep?

small long from 6099 spot, will buy more if 6k fails to hold over the weekend
It's amazing how the price can fall 10% in a morning then just go sideways for hours. 
Longs are barely going down... 

They literally all must be underwater. 

Thoughts on when you think they will close? My guess is just under 6k is a lot of stop losses. Under 5.8k there are even more. 
Peter Brandt predicts 30 USD for LTC, yeah as said the lower we go the lower the predictions become. if you believe in crypto it might be better to set buy orders now and and forget about BTC for 2 weeks. he posted this picture showing a gold bubble comparisson: [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DgU45uvVAAAy1sM.jpg:large](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DgU45uvVAAAy1sM.jpg:large)

lmfao, Bitmex was trading $80 less than mark price.
Hey I haven't been watching things super closely today, did the big BTCEUR buy wall on Kraken get eaten or pulled?
Shorts officially up 3k today
New Binance low is confirmed 

Only 6000 remaining until the shit hits the fan and splatters back in our faces 

This is the moment of truth we've all been waiting for for so long. Are we going to bounce like a mother fucker or not...

Looks like the dump could have been related to this (or not Kappa).

Tempted to close my 6800 short and aim for a  6425-6560 reentry. Under 6200 is bull territory and the daily is probably gonna have a very nice looking bull divergence starting. Also seeing some more volume divergence. That said, there's still enough volume for some continuation, the hourly looks like a bear flag, and finex longs still not closing, plus not many bottom shorters yet. Very well could be another leg down or retest of the local low.
They have their evidence: The Price is Down

You're sitting there upset thinking about what to do next.  7 months ago everything was cheery and exciting.  CNBC was running stories about Bitcoin hitting 1 million dollars a coin.  Now the bears are implying the end of Bitcoin.  Are alt coins going to 0?  Is bitcoin going back to 1k?  You start to think well it's possible right.  Look how far it's fallen already.  I'm already down a lot.  I can cut my losses here and keep some of my money.  

A person who bought near the peak is down 80 percent in six months.  Of course when the market was going up they were saying stuff like buy low, sell high.  Now that it's far lower no one is saying that anymore.  That's what they don't tell you about the mantra buy low and sell high.  You have to buy when everyone else appears to be selling.  It's an incredibly tough thing to do.  You'll be worried that you are wrong and it's even true that you might be.  But the closer you buy to the price being 0 the higher the probability that you have bought "low".  If candy bars dropped in price from 2 dollars to 40 cents would you be more likely to buy them?  Probably.

Why?  Because they want you to sell obviously.  Maximum fear, maximum pain.  It's really tough not to give into the fear.  You think well maybe I'll just make a trade and buy lower.  That's reasonable as long as you eventually get back in.

Is Bitcoin over?  Clearly not.  New bitcoin atms etc opening all the time.  I'm not even saying that you should buy or be a bull.  I'm saying have some balls and stay the course no matter what happens.  That is what will make you respect yourself.  And other people will respect you too.  Because it's so easy to quit when everyone's doing it.
If this is anything similar to the last 2 dumps then this is the sub6k move.
My price range for a local bottom is between 5.7-5.2k. That's based off just trends and past support/resistance levels. As we move into the 5ks, the volume on each drop will further refine this range and give us clues as to where the short term reversal will be had.
People are on edge here. Let's see if I can get a downvote record:

**The charts look extremely bearish. I'm short.**
Closed a short from 6630 2 days ago with a 50% loss, would have been a 235% profit today. 

On the other hand I sold all my crypto holdings yesterday and send the money to my bank account.

In fiat I would have been worse off today by just hodling the whole time.
On the other hand I missed a massive profit.
The permabeartardism is very strong here. Long at 6120. Liquidation around 5600. No SL for now.
Let's see.
Turns out it was all just a stop hunt.
Welp, bitfinex made a lower 6 month low officially.

GDAX won't be lower until 5873

Stamp at 5921
So much disbelief/denial and posts like this from bulls here today, capitulation must be close
Bitcoin seems more alive than at 6.8k. 
As bad as this looks, it's an absolute massacre for coins that aren't in the top five.

So many shorts opening on finex. Might be a shorting bubble forming here...
Said this 6 months ago...

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/7kitoc/daily_discussion_monday_december_18_2017/drf7uoz/

...and I'm saying today, selling here is a mistake.

Edit: Evaluate your own risk tolerance. My trade here is long, very long term. I can stomach another 20% down but I DON'T expect that.
“ This time is different “ 

“ Higher lows it’s a reversal” 

“ This feels very bottom-ey”

“ Just added more to my stack I dont see this going down further” 

“ Shorts are stacking up we should see a BGD soon”

“Hahaha I hope you opened up your longs because this isn’t going down further” 

“Bull Market will start in September don’t worry guys” 

“Who would ever Short this? You guys are idiots “

“ It’s a triple bottom”

“ It’s a double bottom, Target should be 7,2k”

“ INVs h&S on 4H Target should be 7.3k+” 

“We will never see these prices again “ 

“Volume is slowly picking up and price should follow”

“ Alts are pumping BTC should follow soon” 

“ Giant Bear Trap” 


This daily has become so short term reactionary/panicky that it’s pathetic. Sheesh. 
buckle up?  BFX 6090's again.  Let's see if bulls cover.
For a change it seems, GDAX bulls defending 6K big time. 
Sorry, I just got the memo. Buy <6k, sell >6k, got it!
For those who are short from the $6600+ range. What’s your game plan?

I’m working late tonight and have minimal time to check charts, prices, and Reddit.

I have stops set for my short from $6720 at $6225.

Don’t want to get stopped premature but also don’t want to miss out on closing early Incase someone tries to pinch these newly opened bottom shorters out of their positions.


Look at that strength, so massive, a pillar of confidence the bitcoin price is. 
7k incoming
So few days ago price was $6375 and instead of tanking to new recent lows it bounced to $6850 and went sideways.

Had the Bithumb hack which knocked the price down 3% but then it bounced back few hours later. 

Now it's trying to stay above $6600 again.

If this dumps be down to $6400 it may finally have the momentum it needs to break $6000

Chart shows under 2 weeks for the big move. https://i.imgur.com/eUnd364.png
I'm getting the sense that people are finished FOMO chasing bounces above $6K.
## Moon Math update

I have no idea what's happening... but I did add a new "markets" page!

https://www.moonmath.win/alt.html

The combined order books are jumping around a lot.

https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/books/USD

That makes me a nervous bull and a confident bear in our current position. The bear in me is worried about us stalling out at horizontal support lines

It's possible that a lot of sell pressure was just lifted from the market. I think it will take time for us to see substantial changes. Creditors have been told that 20 - 25% of their stake has been sold already with an average of about 10,000 USD/BTC. I was told they took a poll and found that the vast majority of them were not planning on selling. It sounds like it could be 2020 before payouts happen.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/BsapAnES/

Leveraged positions are decreasing their volatility substantially, and the rate of change on longs and shorts indicates to me that the leveraged positions that are open are small and affordable positions that aren't going to open or close quickly.

I guess we'll see what happens.
let's do a straw poll while this thread is poppin' (it seems like people are more sure than ever that this is the bottom/this is going to $1k)

https://www.strawpoll.me/15948726

Was that the bottom? as in, long term bottom/bitcoin won't see these prices again etc 

Yes, no, no but we're close (assume ~10-20% off, say, ~$5k)
Japan’s biggest exchange BitFlyer has been punished by the regulator and must submit a business operation improvement plan

In the meanwhile they can’t take any new customers.

!long xbtusd open 6564

(Entered way too early..)

SL 6450ish - Not too far from the current price :'(
Edit- Nevermiiind.

Sleep deprived, looking at 1hr instead of what I thought was 1min
Cmon you effing whales, quit fooling around, take the price where you want it to be already.
Uh, just came home from one awesome stormy kitesurfing day and see this. what the hell, a day of a storm...
Defently interesting that not many stop orders got executed below 6k. 
Oh look, we're painting another bear flag
I regret to inform everyone that because I keep buying all these dips that we aren't allowed to go up until I sell at a loss. Well, Mr Rothschild, Rockefellar, and Soros I guess your going to have to take it to zero because I've got an iron fist. I know, arguably those 3 families can collapse any economy in the world overnight, but I don't care. I guess I'm numb to their tactics living in U.S. watching the dollar become increasingly more and more worthless year after year. 


As all these other hands/wrists break, the only action I take is buy. My strategy is contrarian trading since i am long term holding. People sell, I buy. Eventually when people buy, I will sell but not until I've held long enough to evade ridiculous U.S. taxes. Same with media headlines. When they are bearish, I buy. In a year or so, when headlines are bullish, that will likely be my cue to sell. We'll see..
Bulls will admit defeat soon enough. 30k underwater longs will scramble to close as 6k falls. This shit is fucking rekt guys. Like, this is looking like another year of bear between 3-6k and maybe by the next halving we will return to bull above 10k. 
Putin Net Worth > Global Digital Money/Asset Market Cap.



I will stick to my plan and buy if we reach sub 5.5k. That 6k falls is personally out of question anymore. It will happen, I expect a quick panic and a V-Bottom and a rebounce back above 6k. My inital plan was to buy at 5.2k
We're about $100 away from the 2018 low. If that breaks this isn't going to be good. 
Time to buy guys , bitcoin is melting down and going to 0 https://qz.com/1312305/why-bitcoin-btc-prices-are-falling-japans-regulator-cracked-down-on-crypto-exchanges/
It's fucking crazy how many longs are still open
This thing is going sub 6k. Be careful opening a long here guys. If we break below $6200-$6100 we could see instant panic and just blow through $5800.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/LyVxPzMU/

Barely any stop at 6.5k and we didn’t spend any time at 6.4k. 

Broke through our major ascending support lines we have been establishing for 9 Days.

Stay safe out their gentlemen 
I dont get how anyone can still be long term bullish. I literally cannot imagine an end to this.
We haven't started a 2hr candle below the BB's and have it continue to drop like this in a long while. I think this is a great entry for a $50-$100 scalp. We may even retest 6.6k in the next 24-48 hours. 
Bart from june 18 completed. Let's see if this really has steam to take us lower. 
Waiting for another spike down to test the buy wall on Kraken @5250.

Still with 1500 coins and not looking like it will be moved. Last time when price reached this wall it went up. Today it caused (helped) a 2% bounce. Maybe if it holds long enough some buy orders get to the order book.

Still think that if 6k is to fall we must get comfortable in the 6100-6400 range so it can be tested multiple times weakening the support.
the magical X is approaching https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZsM3AgN9

The RR for buying at the yearly low that also is the so far above ATH downtrend line I assume to be very good, but with tight stops since there will probably be a lot of actin there
Bullrun psychology:

- We made a double top with 1D RSI divergence in the overbought area. SELLLLL.

Bear run psychology:

- We made a double bottom with 1D RSI divergence in the oversold area. SELLLL
Cases for 5 year + bear market?
Bitmex overloaded like a mofo, good work guys...
Oof, got a little too comfy going long, lost today's small profit at the beginning of the dump but glad I didn't just let it ride and go to bed yet.
!long xbtusd 6311 3x 100% . expect at least a little pullback from this dump.

Damn no one wants to touch that 10mm sell wall on Bitmex.

Is there a particular exchange leading the dump?
Are we calling this a secondary test or a spring in the Wyckoff meme?
[A lot of price strength between here and 5k...](https://gyazo.com/c3a40d79e531a51de02d104aac13487b)
So, i have two shorts open, one on swaps at 7600 (smaller), and another one on september futures at  6500 (bigger). The problem is my paper profits vastly exceed my stack, which on its own got quite the beating on the way down trying to catch knives, 'hedging' and whatnot. I'm getting really antsy because while I'm loving this red of course, every second feels more and more like it's going to blow up in my face.
I know the positions should be fairly protected, the swaps one at least (those fees though!!!)...  but I cannot shake off this very uncomfortable feeling. Taking profits right now feels completely wrong. 
It's the first time I'm in a situation like this and I really don't know how what to think, I'm tired and already lost more out of this fear. Any advice..?
Broke through 6k but it refuses to stay down.
Still adding slowly. Even when it goes <6k
Well, it looks like the panic is over. Time for another 28 hour $40 borefest?
Majority of cryptos are >75% off ATH just a few months ago.

Not a crash /s
Why I think the bottom is near:
https://www.tradingview.com/x/awsEY0P1/

Smart money is accumulating right now. A lot of fresh new limit buy order were placed in that drop. These buy orders were not there on previous dumps.
Well, that kinda sucks. The volatility has been so low I was not expecting this. My average entry is 6300 so I'm going to need a nice bounce just to break even. :( This is some serious baggage, again. 
Big question of the day.  Will the daily close with bullish divergence in 3 hours?
Interesting days, a damper on Tether FUD, end to Gox dump fear, all we need now is some more slack from South Korea and China and we will have undone most of the bad news from the crash. Maybe the dumping will continue, but the path is clearing for a reversal.
[deleted]
Went below 6k1 and still no major bounce. 6k will not hold, it will get ugly soon.
Quadruple bottom is in. Moon launch in 5.. 4...
This will end in a panic! Get ready for cheap coins. 
Anyone thinking Bitfinex used Tether to pump the price and others are leaking Tether is legit while BTC continues to tank.

Higher up Bitfinex guy leaves.

Good entertainment. Wonder how low BTC goes worst case.
We are still far from testing recent lows. If it it doesn't drop more it looks like we failed to go down more. Not calling anything I'm just observing. 
[deleted]
Scaling in with stops below 5950 & 5000, will reposition around 3k with similar strategy if stops are hit, risking some capital for volatile upside on logscale chart support
He's going to push these noobs to fill his 6k order then take it back up. 
Been awhile. Some **hypothetical** hopium: if we close the day under 6.3k **and** tomorrow is green, we have ourselves a massive bull div on the daily.
ETH dropping further for whats its worth. I watch & trade both and found that sometimes it leads the way. 
What is the Japan news being referenced?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but looks like Bitfinex shorts are at 10 week high.   I"m short too, so I don't really like this number as makes a short squeeze too attractive to The Manipulators.
I don't know what to say really.
Six months
in the biggest battle of our professional lives
all comes down to today.
Either
we heal
as a community
or we are going to crumble.
Point by point
dollar by dollar
till we're finished.
We are in hell right now, gentlemen
believe me
and
we can stay here
and get the shit kicked out of us
or
we can fight our way
back into the light.
We can climb out of hell.
One trade, at a time.

Now I can't do it for you.
I'm too broke.
I look around and I see these young faces
and I think
I mean
I made every wrong trade a middle age man could make.
I uh....
I pissed away all my money
believe it or not.
I chased off
anyone who has ever loved me.
And lately,
I can't even stand the face I see in the mirror.

You know when you get old in life
things get taken from you.
That's, that's part of life.
But,
you only learn that when you start losing stuff.
You find out that life is just a game of trading.
So is bitcoin.
Because in either game
life or bitcoin
the margin for error is so small.
I mean
one half step too late or to early
you don't quite make it.
One half second too slow or too fast
and you don't profit.
The trades we need are everywhere around us.
They are in ever break of the price
every minute, every second.

In this community, we fight for that inch
In this community, we tear ourselves, and everyone around us
to pieces for that inch.
We CLAW with our finger nails for that inch.
Cause we know
when we add up all those inches
that's going to make the fucking difference
between WINNING and LOSING
between LIVING and DYING.

I'll tell you this
in any fight
it is the guy who is willing to die
who is going to win that inch.
And I know
if I am going to have any life anymore
it is because, I am still willing to fight, and die for that inch
because that is what LIVING is.
The six inches in front of your face.

Now I can't make you do it.
You gotta look at the guy next to you.
Look into his eyes.
Now I think you are going to see a guy who will go that inch with you.
You are going to see a guy
who will sacrifice himself for this team
because he knows when it comes down to it,
you are gonna do the same thing for him.

That's a community, gentlemen
and either we heal now, as a team,
or we will die as individuals.
That's bitcoin guys.
That's all it is.
Now, whattaya gonna do?
Bulls need to start stepping it up man. 
When in doubt, zoom out.
Can we get a poll on what price level the people in this sub will move out of BTC and into only fiat?  Has this been done yet?
Another bear flag being painted on the hourly right now. I think this is it and we're about to finally see a huge price breakdown under $6,000.
[deleted]
Surprisingly strong dump.  Stopped out of my long from 6530 with a tiny gain.  Oh well.  Entering another long here at 6250.
Obviously this was a bulltrap (the rise to $6800). People always forget and were hopeful... They always forget just a week or two ago it was $7800, and before that $10k, before that $12k, etc. A trader's pscyhology... feed them useless hopium and dump on them again. Next we dump to $5k and then we rise to $6k and bulls will be hopeful again, lol.
5700 is coming... Ouch
i hope you all like goblins

I had 5 down contracts with the strike price at 6200 to try out the options and they expired like an hour or two ago.... Bloody typical bitcoin.

Does anyone know any way to see how big the orders are that are leading to this dump? 

*for future ref: https://trading.gear54.me/tradeflow/
Is this dump because of the Japanese anti-money laundering measures and freeze on new account creation? How is it that Asia is always serving up endless amounts of FUD?

Time to.... go all-in ?
doomsday
If you think the bid side of the order book is going to be able to sustain any margin called longs until we get to the low $5ks or maybe even lower...

I'm not sure I have the tools to explain to you why you're wrong. Just look at the chart and the sentiment.
Just a quick thought for bears. So your analysis was right and we went down. But, would you be really happy if it go below 6k and stay there awhile? What if you get more coins but it doesn't come back for a year?

It's kinda like alts like XRP, i can have 5-6x more now than compared to prices at ATH, but would I really want XRP?
I have a big buy order at 5250 EUR in Kraken, thinking of removing it soon once and for all. /s
Funny. We drop down because of hack and Japan news and now this discussion is full of shorts... because they think they are right.

They are just lucky with this downside news....

Not short now. I see what's going on. But adding slowly

Hey guys, serious question: How much actual money is in Crypto?

The total market cap is 250 billion or whatever, but is 250 billion dollars actually in the market?

I heard somewhere that a much smaller amount is in the market, but if that's the case, then why is it 250 billion market cap wise?


I have no short position now but congratulations to the shorts with the lately Hack news and Japan news. 
Expecting sideways movement between approx 6250 and 6500. mooo.
The bottom border of the falling wedge is around 5,8k at the moment...

Having fun yet lads?

Still got a spot short open at x10.

Fishing for a Sept futures long at x5
More hypothetical bull hopium: We are set up for a potential Bolinger W reversal on the one day charts if the price makes a new low but doesn't pierce the lower bband. see here [http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart\_school:technical\_indicators:bollinger\_bands](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:bollinger_bands) I am not optimistic though
Just went long the 6k Wall is holding. Les fucking go
off topic but does anyone know what happened to you tuber Crypto Investor? He seems to have disappeared.
So this is 4th failure to break 6k down. Bounce is weak. What the fuck do you make of this? 

I suppose the answer is nothing and be fully in cash. Not only Bitcoin is rather unpredictable, every other equity is too...

I made some cash off of swinging stocks after exiting Bitcoin, but I wish I could just long something with confidence.
Even though I'm underwater this is certainly something to watch, it feels like crash v2. What I really want to see though is just how many shorts we get and how far down it goes before we bounce. Because that could be epic.
Anyone else seeing this wyckoff formation on the 30s?
[removed]
This dump makes no sense at all 
Well, that long from 6600 is underwater. Doubled down at 5999. It's a tiny portion of my stack, and I'm prepared to lose it all... but I won't. GDAX account loaded up with dumb, dirty dollars. Will add to hodl stack in case this goes further south.
BTC has lost 40% of its value in less than 7 weeks. At this rate, we'll see sub $3,000 before the end of the summer.

Honestly, I can't see crypto recovering from this. It always was a speculative asset, and both market sentiment and adaption are rapidly decreasing. As long as crypto is not being used in the real world, its value will plummet further.
Now bulls have resorted to celebrating that the price hasn't immediately dropped to 0 upon crossing below 6000 after falling $800 in a single day. Lol holy shit you couldn't make this up. I can't stop laughing.

I wonder what you guys are gonna celebrate next.
[removed]
Any Friday this hasn't dumped in a few weeks? Feels more and more like a cycle... Which means now when I know it it will reverse
fuck me. ive missed shit like this, finally some action.

Short fully closed now, need to figure out avg price but made some nice profit on that one. 

Just opened a long on sept futures at 5752. Got 2 more orders at 5652 and 5552. gonna see how much knife catching my hands can handle.

Good luck lads
So Japanese raided all their crypto exchanges.  More bad news.  I posted recently that it doesn't make sense to be long, because the bad news will continue to pound the price lower and lower.  I got downvoted then and I will get downvoted now.

And more bad news will continue to pound the price lower and lower.
2014 had a similar situation. Went up to test the break down area, and then we had a free fall down to 200 or so. 6500 is the test.
Only Bitcoin could be up 120% YoY and have people pronouncing it dead, y'all about to witness the undead shortly YoY to 2019
Never boring in crypto land.
10% rise in under an hour is usually my sign for a reversal. But 5% so far is not bad!
I understand.  Can you believe these people talking about technical analysis of a manipulated market full of trades with the exchanges as both the buyer and seller?
I need a contrarian here. Pronto.
There has been a move out of small cap coins which did not happen on the previous dips. I think the market is coming to it's senses.


There are at best 10x1 Billion+ coins so we probably have a little more to shake out.

We will probably have a bounce (or 2) before the bottom

is the price stuck? [srs]

Cool man. Good luck

The bottom is somewhere between $0.1 and $4000 and it’s anyone’s guess in between those two figures. 4-7k is not enough pain.

I speak from an entirely amateur mind. 
Hack news and Japan news lately and still 6k+. 
Not bad.

That's the biggest h&s I have seen I think.

EDIT: I guess people hates h&s in this sub since they are too common and everyone is always posting them. Well, they might not know that the neck of a h&s is usually a confluence of many indicators, so people is seeing the same h&s just as other metric. 
Panic sell some at 5k for me. Entry is 1k with plenty cashed out. 6 months between 5.4k and 6.3k then move up. 
Oh hey, look! We got it under 6k for 12 seconds, and now we only have to buy back 30K BTC! Yay us! Go team bear! lolol
about to touch the 2k BTC EURBTC Kraken wall, around 6100 might be a decent place for a long. I'll long with a 6k stop but to be honest personally I don't see it holding. 
Shorting since $15k. I've been predicting all these breakdowns for weeks now. Still only see down side for the foreseeable future. Ever since the blockstream core devs have decided that bitcoin is a store of value only and couldn't get the ln running, I see no reason for the value to increase.
I must emphasize at the out start that the Honorable Satoshi Nakamoto is not a politician. So I'm not here this afternoon as a Republican, nor as a Democrat; not as a Mason, nor as an Elk; not as a Protestant, nor a Catholic; not as a Christian, nor a Jew; not as a Baptist, nor a Methodist; in fact, not even as an American, because if I was an American, the problem that confronts our people today wouldn't even exist.

So I have to stand here today as what I was when I was born: A bitcoin owner

Before there was any such thing as Bitcoin Cash or Ether, we owned Bitcoin

Before there was any such thing as a XRP or an Monero, we owned Bitcoin

Before there was any such thing as Bitcoin ATMS we owned Bitcoin

In fact, before there were any exchanges at all, we owned Bitcoin

And after Bitthumb  has long passed from the scene, we will still own Bitcoin

I'm gonna tell you like it really is. Every election year these politicians are sent up here to pacify us! They're sent here and setup here by the Big Banks

This is what they do!

They send dr in Harlem down here to pacify us!

They send alcohol down here to pacify us!

They send prostitution down here to pacify us!

Why you can't even get drugs in Harlem without the White Man's permission!

You can't get prostitution in Harlem without the White Man's permission!

You can't get gambling in Harlem without the White Man's permission!

Every time you break the seal on that liquor bottle, that's a Government seal you're breaking!

Oh, I say and I say it again, ya been had!

Ya been took!

Ya been hoodwinked!

Bamboozled!

Led astray!

Run amok!

This is what He does...

Bull trap confirmed, now is the time we go for the long-awaited $3k.
Hey, a trading theory you can use.

> To assure traders of the existence of dollar reserves, Tether has issued EOM bank statements from December 2016 to March 2017 audited by a Chinese accounting firm. … There is a clear monotonic relationship between monthly Tether issuance and the EOM negative price pressure. In months with no Tether issuance, there is no EOM effect. However, in months with large Tether issuance, there is a 6% negative benchmarked return. Further in supplemental results, we also estimate a regression of EOM return on monthly Tether issuance and find that it explains 37% of the variations in EOM returns. 

https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3195066

The theory is that Tether might be mostly backed, but only at the end of the month to show proof to their chinese accounting firm. During the month, they create tether to buy btc (and perhaps pump the price some), but they sell BTC for dollars at the end of the month. I am not endorsing this theory, but interesting idea. 
The kraken Spoof walls at 5250 Euros leaves to think this is a miners collective activity to keep price up.
Responding to the post that was just deleted about all the negative hews, that isn't all a result of independent editorial decisions.  There is likely a coordinated propaganda campaign against cryptocurrency, funded and pressured by banking and government interests. 
Looks not good but bulls have showed good ressources lately. I'm not trading this.
I was expecting a bit more panic when we broke 6k. There has been much talk about a capitulation event which is required to end this bear market. Just wanted to poll how people are mentally prepared for whatever will/can/might come, and how realistic such a capitulation event really is:

https://www.strawpoll.me/15949229

I am not making a statement that we will be going down. Just wondering about people their plans about a hypothetical future situation.
This is exactly the kind of success I expected to have when you combined a store of value and a broken lighting network. Success for us shorters that is.
Failed / half barts seem to result in miniBGDs. So far, this is looking like said failed / half bart possibly in response to the bitflyer news mentioned below...

It also bounced at 6610 support

EDIT: Technically, it's still a failed bart...

EDIT2: Still clinging on... lol

EDIT3: So is it a failed bart or something else when price goes past the start point of said bart?
It's funny how despite the new Tether FUD of Phil Potter leaving, people are flocking to USDT from BTC

I still think we will break below $1,000 this year. How far below is anyones call though. There is so much borrowed money invested into Crypto it’s absolutely insane. Now you know why the “evil” banks blocked credit card purchases.

Emotions and pride. To a lot of people, changing positions would feel like admitting they were wrong. So they cling to those positions with everything they have hoping to eventually be proven right. 
I think a lot of people are under the impression that if they leave comments on reddit saying bulls/bears are dumb because xyz and down vote anything against their position that it will turn the market around in their favor
Hard for people to admit they are being played by pros who don't give any fucks about reddit trading sub

This is extremely interesting, thank you
sorry, what am i looking at?  "Sum of coindays destroyed in period" means nothing to me, but looks interesting.
You're being downvoted for a good statement.

Yes. They didn't. This actually means that margin traders weren't shaken off from their position and also weren't interested in adding to them and whole price action was based on non-margin trades.

Or... Margin positions that were closing were closed into new positions (if 1k btc long closes into 1k btc long wall then we have no new longs and we see 1k market sell).

'sellers are exhausted'
I think we’ll be trying for a “12 apostles” bottom
Once you realize the average age of the typical crypto traders is somewhere in the teenagers to early 20 range, it all starts to make sense.

This is the dumbest, most naive market on the planet. Its filled with people who lose money by trading entirely based on emotion and FOMO.
FOMO traders abound in crypto
deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.7168  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/42490)
Most margin traders in crypto are new to it, after realizing they can make money if they bet on the market going down, but their entries are shit because they still go on FOMO instincts
How is this a typical ~~financial~~ market?
Can we stop with the "bottom is close" memes? Sentiment is extremely low, vaporware altcoins still at egregious valuations, and there is no FOMO to fuel any legitimate rally. You can see as the bounces got smaller off 6k the last few months. People don't believe it anymore, they are selling off earlier, taking profit earlier, some have lost interest altogether. This will take months, if not more than a year to slowly reverse.
alternatively, we're just flagging while RSI's reset after dropping over 10% in the past couple days
I can't feel you there!

Become so tired,

So much more awake! 
Despair stage.  Want the good news?  I'm a long term bull.  I've been waiting for this stage to begin because until we're through it, we can't prepare for the next cycle.  So... Silver lining.  Won't be long for the real bottom now, I hope
Human nature to overestimate in the moment.
Basic market psychology. Probably a good time to start accumulating.
"Where the bottom is" if you're a trader. You should not be planning to re-entry until the market shows signs of reversal, or is in reversal.
3k for me.
I'll be looking to reenter below 5k.  By 3.5k I'll definitely be buying some.  Really what I'm looking for is a total decrease in the volatility, that's when the cycle is over.

Below 2k is a major buy level for me, if we reach it.  Below 1k is a mortgage the house type buy level.  I don't think we'll get there though.
Will catch a knife at 5700 if we would get there today because that would just be absurd for one day. But once 6k breaks it's going to overperform so I'll just market buy whenever I think the sell pressure subsides. Won't go net long though.
55xx, personally, unless the market tells me different once we get under 6K. I'm not preloading entries. 
I cant check order books but I’m assuming there will be some overly large fat orders in the book around $5800-$5900
This is a great perspective. For anyone that does not realize where we are vs where we were, as a total market, think about this. 

On October 29th, 2017, Bitcoin was $5800 (close to where we are now). The total crypto market cap was $170 billion then and proceeded due north >$800 billion in early January. 

The total market cap today is $258 billion with BTC basically the same price as the end of October. XRP is still nearly 3X from that point in time. BCH is 2x. 

Now I don't claim to know where the money is going to continue to flow to (fiat, tether, BTC), but I think its important to note that the last time BTC was at this price range, the total market cap was much smaller and that personally makes me cautious. 
Bingo. It's important to reflect on the fact that alts are exiting to Tether and Bitcoin. Both Tether and Bitcoin are the primary sources of funding for basically every alt. You can make an argument that ethereum makes a substantial portion, but percentage wise it really isn't that significant.

What you are left with is a market that's extremely fragile and losing sources of funding. Systemic collapse in alt markets is very possible.
Tether hasn't really deflated though and thats what drove the 2017 boom
I'm still on the edge of my seat. I've decided to hold my longs and... I've been flip-flopping between "it's going to be OK" and "[Shit!](https://imgur.com/n1G9NmD) I've made a terrible mistake!"
Shorting now? Way to sell the bottom, guys!

I'm seriously making an "I bought the bottom -- 6-22-2018" t-shirt after these guys get squeezed up to 7K and beyond.
Volume is much lower now, despite the same price level. What's your take on that aspect?
The big difference is that now we've dropped out of the bottom of a huge symmetric triangle, which is hugely bearish. The last time this happened, we dropped from 13k to 5.7k back in Feb.
Hey daddie
Nice! haven't seen you long in a while!

Hats off to you. Very brave trade...
It was such an obvious play. I did the same.
We goin to 3k man, bad idea
Great news. Everyone will update their mental calendar and remove the possible 100K BTC sell-off this autumn. It will be at least a year, likely longer, until anyone gets their hands on old Goxcoins and not everyone will sell.
Honestly, it's not unlikely that we have more downside potential after resetting RSIs while barting up and down in this area... i would put a stop at b/e for the rest of the position and let it ride. 
Stops in place would serve you well. It could sideways and go right up again.
I never post but I can relate so I'll do it anyway. I have the same mindset, "let's just close it so I can be done and lock up some profit". Not always though, mainly when I've, like you, opened a position in a bad spot and held it for a few days.

Anyway, I'm short from 6700 since yesterday and I'm in no hurry to close. This is what I'm looking at: https://imgur.com/sXxsVjW
Maybe close the rest if the price re-enters the channel? 
There's a bear flag on the 4HR and Daily bro. I opened another one and am letting this one just ride the wave down. My position may be open for a week but if that's what it takes then so be it. 
Stay in the position, don't close after the first impulsive move after several days of sideways. 

Don’t close. Let that sucker ride you held it under water long enough. 

This is going down farther. Give it a day or 2.

First stop $6100-$6200 then 6k will be tested 
When are we going to go full "harakiri" ?

Quick question: how come those depth charts are "backward"? Usually they're graphed as a valley (cumulative), and you have them the other way as a skateboard ramp of sorts.

Also, I double love this because I've been lecturing about the hidden magic and importance of order books for a long time, and it usually falls on deaf ears. Turns out I'm not the only one!

Thanks Chad. Needed that 🙌🏻
Alts were already starting to bleed before the drop from 6720 to 6600, and have kept at it. 
Don't you think when Bitcoin starts to rise all the alts will just rise again? 

i.e. Every 1% move in BTC is usually 3-5% in alts. (ETH included). Up or down.
For the last 6 months did btc dominance usually go up while btc went up? Or did it go up when alts went down while btc went sideways?

Or was it just from alts moving more drastically? 
You never closed those Longs!!!

/Underwatersoccerman 

:( 
I feel your pain, maybe we should start a little underwater village. 

What's your DCA as of now?

Im waiting for 4.5-5k to avg down (if we ever get there). This slow bleed's been killing my soul.
6k was only broken a few hours ago mate, still plenty of time for it to dump more this weekend. This isn't resistance. More like a dead cat bounce. Bitcoin is the only thing I can see trade sideways for 2 hours and everyone calls it resistance.
It was already in extremely oversold territory by the time 6k was broken. A cool off is totally expected.
It’s hovering at $6040. If this was a real bounce it’d be back at $6500

And yes order books were thin, yet even with that the price is still hovering a cunts hair above $6000. 

This is just a breather while the RSI cools off. Then the dumping will resume. The key support level was broken, the fat lady is only starting to sing 
Bull div doesn't form until the local low is confirmed (ie only if tomorrow brings a substantial bounce).
I wouldn't recommend anyone else do anything, but I am short, because of the chart.  I didn't expect the price to plummet on the 6k break, considering it was already down about 10% at that point.
Reading this book at the moment. It's definitely got some good content but I think it's the most padded out book I've ever read! It could be less than half as long and still make the same points clearly.


You might be in for some exhilarating months then ;)
Everyone says how they want to buy at 5k but nobody actually wants to sell there. ^^And ^^we ^^might ^^be ^^down ^^11% ^^already ^^today...
because it's one big wash traded clusterfuck of manipulation, there are literally no sellers and conventional retail buyers are long gone, just few institutional players sitting skimming off every douchebag selling real BTC right now

Looks like the lower end of a bear flag pattern and broken trendlines. https://www.tradingview.com/x/iN5ZABWw/

In the past when we see volume, bitcoin crashed and burned. We will see if this volume picks up or another fake out within further consolidation gulag to the up side.

Also, this time, altcoins are leading the drop with ETH, XRP and EOS first taking that first dip since yesterday while BTC stayed stagnant.
A "lower" position size seems to imply less expectancy of the trade?

Whilst everyone tries to sound cleve, all the majority do who are doing is going off past behaviour and hopes it repeats itself ie we've dropped a lot so will probably go up a little 

Nothing more than pure gambling 


i am currently on the can and using my tablet, so with no access to my 2FA, I'm expecting the bounce any second now.
Can't wait for The Great Bounce where all noob shorters lose all of mommy and daddy's money 
All our resident bull buddies are suspiciously missing. The bear friends can be just as annoying though. I noticed they are out to play in force since we dipped below 6k a bit.
Route to fiat.
Yeah, it became a pattern now. 

However I recall alts were dropping to BTC before moves up as well....

We just hit our unreasonably steep downtrend line from the dropoff last night which was pretty much guaranteed to break, so a pop up to test 6250-6300 wouldn't be a shock.

Yea haha, shorts is almost 1:1 with longs now. You know what's next? Calling my fellow BXD lovers ;-)
Yes, alts have consistently shit the bed worse and more readily.
Might be just lagging, people sell their shitcoins to BTC and only then they dump it
Nope
I typically see sell offs happen during the traditional work week and rallies occur in odd-hours of weekends.  I could be wrong, but feels like they want the "every man" to capitulate and see it happening, but want to deprive them of an entry to the "bottom".
yes
No
It might or it might not.  Somebody just blew about $250 million to drop the price a few hundred bucks. It depends on how much of their money they feel like giving away. :))
Lol, get outta here with all this rationality. How's your break going, dude? Wanna FOMO back in?
Also in mid-to-longer term analysis don't miss what /u/jarederaj posted regarding longer term stability, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8souh7/daily_discussion_thursday_june_21_2018/e12iigf/). Check the last link to a tradingview study. This is prolly one of the most relevant analysis recently posted in here.
agreed. Got that on my chart as well, if that fucker breaks then well it's really pretty ugly. It's the last stand realistically before the big unknown is upon us.

There is low of 12th November 2017 as well sitting at 5325 (Binance)
Ooh. I'd forgotten about that. At least some positives coming out of this... 
The problem is with making any statements based on a failure to break that it only holds true until it does break. 

TA is only a method of assessing market conditions and calculating risk based on price movements. 

As for your statement, it means that below 6k there are a lot of buyers willing to buy, though if these buyers run out, then we'll likely drop below, at which point it's uncertain what these new buyers will do -> sell to push price lower, or invest even more to protect their investment and send price higher. 
From TA persp, the key is how volume & price spread interacts at "floors".  Right now, $6k is acting like a floor when you drop a big bouncey ball on it - there are bounces, but each 'peak' gets lower and lower.  What will be key is how the market reacts if/when we fall through the floor - if the market reacts violently and brings us back up and over the $6k mark, then thats very bullish.  If it's still this 'meh' kind of volume with weak dead cat bounces, that's a strong sign of things to come - we haven't actually found the real floor yet.  I'm excited because we're about to learn the truth in the coming days/weeks - if $6k is 'the' floor or if it was just a pitstop.
Someone here used a hammer metaphor the other day to describe this.

Imagine trying to break a large rock, the first few swings cause a few chips and the hammer to ricochet off, but a few more big swings and you eventually crack that shit.

The trend is the hammer and volume is how hard you swing 

Edit: And resistance/support is the rock
Well if it finally breaks down we'll complete the descending triangle that's been forming since ATH
The more times support is tested the weaker it gets. The only exception to this is a *very* long time frame low volatility period like the bottom of a bear market. This is not that.
So I'm speculating but are most of the people buying and sellng just those shorting and longing vs actual regular joes.

Because if I was a regular guy with some coins I'm holding then sure I might sell but are there enough of these people to move the market. Do they have limit orders in place and so on.

At the height of the madness of 20k, sure, loadsa noobs. But most people I know are either out already or don't care about the price as they've written it off, got on with their lives and won't be interested again until the price moves upwards. It's summer, it's boring, the world cup is on and nobody cares outside of day traders.

Me, I'm underwater and have been for two weeks now. I have gone past caring. If it goes up, great, if not, it'll only fall so far and I'm getting the best nights sleep in months as a result of this outlook.
Vast majority of those who would panic sell already panic sold long ago.
probably will happen if 5.8k broke
short covering
Ehhhhh everyone is talking about a huge selloff but I think at this point we are too near the low. That's why we are in slow bleed territory. Like maybe you get lucky and sell at 5900 and you get to buy back at 3100. But it's also possible it heads down to 5200 and reverses quickly.... or fakes you out and you never buy back in until above 6000 again... and people don't want to trigger a taxable event... etc etc. I don't think there's enough volume or interest for a huge panic spike like we saw in January 
Exchange software is so shitty there is always a delayed reaction. The way I see it you normally get the following sequence

1.  Overreaction to dump (so long wick)
2.  Bounce back as long orders finally get through to the books
3. Period of whiplash back and forth as the orders continue to pile in on an overloaded engine
4. Finally the market makes the decision as to whether long or short has the weight of numbers and the final direction makes itself known
Because there are ton of orders between 5.8 and 6 that have been waiting for a break.

The question is whether there is enough interest to overwhelm the sellers.
Because it's literally not going much lower 

So many people have entered the market, crypto is more popular than ever, noobs get swallowed whole by whales but more people are fighting for a smaller share of the pie. 
Patience 
Raccoon trying to break into attic pattern is very bearish
Raccoon revenge!
Personally, I just put in 5% of my fiat at $6K. I have 5% orders roughly every $60 down to $4800. This is a small amount though, and not part of my trading stack. 
A small amount. Be cautious. We're right along the horizontal support lines and Ethereum (relevant to the market as it's second biggest crypto) is just above it's long term trend line (Bitcoin broke its long term trend line, Ether hasn't). To me this means we are either at the bottom right now, or if we break support and that trend line we may be dropping way further down. So exercise caution and don't average out over the time span of days or weeks but rather months given the state of this market.

Maybe you haven't seen about 70% of BTCs value be slowly but surely and consistently wiped off over the past 5 months or so...

All the while the "bullish" indicator drops, a week ago $7k was bullish, now 'if we close under $6.3k but have a green day tomorrow then that's bullish" according to another user...
This goes much deeper than just a $200 drop.

To begin..

We dropped almost 600$ from yesterday’s high at $6750. We broke through our ascending support line that we established over the course of 9 days. 

Volume is still disgustingly low compared to what we are used to seeing. Considering the lack of bounce this proves it’s simply just selling pressure causing the rise in volume over last 6 hours, hence the 600$ drop. 

Margin trades on Finex have barely moved, indicating that this is more of a “ Natural “ sell off rather than a bunch of over leveraged n00bs getting liquidated causing a sharp spike downward. When Margin longs start closing and large shorts begin to open up, then we will see max pain.

We failed numerous times at the attempt to break 6.8k, painting a nearly identical picture to the 7k range. If it’s anything similar, we should see a drop below 6k in the near future.

We bounced only 100$ off the low $6000’s range, also forming a new low in the 6K range. The lack of buy pressure and bounce points to there is not enough buying interest at these levels and we may see a further decline. 

Our old low from the previous drop in February is a scary $100ish dollars away. Apparently there could potentially be a massive bullish div on daily chart but can’t chart it right now, this could bring some hope for the bulls.

Alt ratios/ prices have absolutely been demolished in the last 30 days. Money is being taken out of the market. Lack of fresh FIAT coming in.

I think this is only the beginning. 
I think it's just that whenever there's a bigger movement there is an influx of comments from emotional traders. I still find this sub to be by far the best place for intelligent discussion and analysis, you just have to sort through the noise sometimes 
I don’t think it’s so much the volume of the drop but the fact that it seems to be dropping fairly consistently since around January. 

I’m mixed on this to be honest - on one hand I’m genuinely not optimistic about the future of Bitcoin or even crypto at all at this point, but on the other hand I will say it’s been dropping a lot slower than I had honestly expected, though this may well just be a reflection of how large the market is.

With that said, whilst I think we may see a bounce here, I’m not at all optimistic for the short to medium term at this point. 
It's not forever, but it's not unreasonable to think it comes back down to 2017 levels.  It's not like crypto is much more useful today than it was then.
Welcome to Bearsville. This sub now is just a notch above r/buttcoin in the sense that people don't actively express their disdain for Bitcoin, just it's price.
> I wonder why bitmex is seeing such a huge spike in margin positions but bitfinex isn't.

dumb money on bitmex continues to short the bottom vs smart money on BFX who does not...

Just messing around, no clue if this is the bottom or not, but then again what does the typical bitmex trader profile look like compared to that of BFX?
Sloppy, how do you watch interest on Bitmex? ELI5
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
WOW! You caught the absolute bottom every time! Incredible! /s
I like how active it is on days like this. Just wish it was like this all the time and going up instead :(

It is sad...playing out the way it had to:

"First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then ~~you~~ they win.
Luckily I diversified in to fiat.
I'm all in Fuck Token, been fucked by Bitcoin so now i'm up for some fucking myself 
I know a guy who can sell you some VeChain.
:)
Your sacrifice will not be in vain. 
I guess it’s also quite literal in a way:  “improve your business or we shut you down” :)
Not wanting to piss off the mods talking about alts but I'm surprised how random the drops have been.
This has always been the case though. Even though BTC leads the drops, it always drops the least itsself. 
Good idea.  Never invest more than you're comfortable investing -- in anything.

Now go outside and play.  Check back in September.
Bear market is only just beginning my the looks of it. Ominous drop
Use market stops (if available on your platform) if you are protecting capital.
Average Joe is still wondering "WTF is a bitcoin?"

E: Spelling
"Told you it was a scam!"
If you’re one of my friends, all you would need to do is ask “Hey how’s your Bitcoin doing?” if you wanna make me feel retarded.
My buddy Average Joe who bought a couple thousand at $17,500 (and is still holding) texted me this morning with the following: "GDAX going away? lol looks like they went out of business"
Conversation with a 22 year tech industry vet yesterday:

"I believe cryptocurrency has no value, but the absolutely blockchain does & is the future."

Upon prying, they had *zero* understating that a successful dx network fundamentally requires a scarce network resource (i.e. hashpower or stake).

I'm amazed at how high a % are unaware of such.
My coworkers that are a bit smarter than your average Joe (IT guys) all said it was too late to get in when it made the headlines in november and think it can go much lower. They would be interested around 3k and are absolutely not in a rush.
That was fast... Rekt wall
nice trade, even if it didn't work.
Never going to get there.
5400 then bounce. then we'll see. 
>how are people expecting this to end?

With despair and people calling bitcoin dead
Edit: 80%+ of posters on here
I think we're gonna hang out in slow bleed city for the rest of 2017 rather than straight to goblintown. Quick visits to goblintown to re-moon are common in bull markets but I expect this to be a prolonged bitter pill to swallow for people who don't realize just how lucky they were to get in before or early 2017. (look what this sub has done to my vocabulary)
It won't go lower than zero.
We are at 6k and still nobody cares about crypto. I expect 6-12 more months of bear-action/no action at all.
Oh 100%, it's best to just ignore this subs sentiment and stick with your plan and follow through. You know why? Because that's what Brian Boitano'd do
Isn't that how one makes money? By taking advantages of others panic and fear? Oh and greed, don't forget greed.
Sure it is. All the people basing their trading off a few dinguses here are just as emotional as the dinguses 
Your stoploss is epic IF this reverses from here :-D.

Edit: nvm .
ADA and XRP are always my favorites :D Everything is looking very dumpy to me
Do you remember all through 2017 when everyone was like yeah we'll see 5,000 maybe 10,000 and it went to 20,000?
What the hell is all that red and green shit outside the BB?
You are lucky because of the hack and Japan news .
You chart is useless with news coming out. 

Positive or negative
Yep. And I’m in a few alt communities and they are still a little too optimistic in my opinion. Despite the bear market, they say “Were lucky to be in so early. Just wait, we’ll emerge from this bear market stronger than ever! Other coins survived the last bear market and we will too!” It’s a classic case of survivorship bias. They ignore the fact that like 90% of alts didn’t make it through the 2014 bear market. 



Now I’m not sure if ALL the optimism has to be wiped away for there to be a reversal. There’s always a few that are optimistic, can’t get rid of that. 


My problem is that I know full well that most of my alts will die, but I don’t know *which* ones. It could be all of them but what if it isn’t? Which do I hold? That’s the dilemma that I face and many others as well. 



Overall I think you would have to be stupid to not hold any Bitcoin. Going all in on altcoins right now is not a good choice. Bitcoin is the safest without a doubt. Even if we fall another 50% like a lot of people here say that we might, we know that Bitcoin has the lowest chance of dying compared to all the rest of crypto.

Hey we need to get rid of the daily Alt-coin discussion ( almost no real discussion happening, no charts, nothing good) and start doing the 2nd or 3rd daily (like we did back in the day).

Over **1400 comments** in this thread alone. It has become nearly un-usable.
You'll have to wait ...only so much fun in one day and you already saw  that much in liquidations today from the dump.   
would you be unconvinced if we were hanging out at $10-11k for the 4th time in 4 months and people were saying we're gonna break $12k? 

it's just a proximity/war of attrition thing now. It's so close and we've been here so many times, it's hard not to think the market is ready for the plunge 

I mean it'd be cool if this was the bottom but...we've just been here so many times. it looks ready 😞

which means it'll totally put it off for another week 😃😅

I will say that it wouldn't be crazy to bottom here just because traders get bored waiting for the breakdown or something 
Because bears are just as blind as the bulls sometimes. This is the higher low test on the weekly.
because we are in a bear market and are currently sitting $346 dollars above 6k, plus if we break under 6118 we'll make yet another lower low.

That's two of many reasons why it's reasonably likely we'll break 6k.

Care to state why you find it unconvincing that we could break under 6k then?
I think no one said 3k yet, we are just considering sub 6k atm..
I think capitulation stories are going to pop up in alt market threads this week.
Any idea of how far this will dump when it capitulates?
> We’re awfully close to the 2018 bottom of $5800 which I don’t see holding

It's the double bottom everyone's been waiting months for. Why don't you see that holding? 

I'm with ya bud. What prices you eyeing to buy at? Or already buying at these prices?
Ok.
I can't believe people are still saying that sellers are exhausted after this absolute shitshow today
Lol dunno which side we'll end up on, but for sure 6k will be crazy resistance if we end up below.
we just had a freefall from 6.9k. We need to cool off a bit, after such a drop RSIs need to recover again a bit. 
All these sellers are getting completely recharged. I still think 2.5k or round about that is the bottom.
Not exhausted and getting their 2nd wind.
you've been buying the "bottom" every time there is a move down saying this is it. I haven't seen you ever post that you sold/took profit. Which means your entire position is pretty heavily under water. 
Either: 

“I bought the bottom — 6-22-2018”

Or

“When buying the dip goes wrong — 6-22-2018”
I'll upvote you just this once because this could very well be a plausible bottom.

That's a big ass ascending triangle...
Looks like an ascending triangle. 
I would short that.
Honestly it wouldn't surprise me if we were at 6700 in 12 hours from now.

Because that's the way the market fucks.
Look at the bearish divergence.... it screams it wants to retest support.
This one is clever. I like it.
it's only friday night, it's going to be a long weekend!
I'll help your pursuit.
Reloading
Down 10% in a day is pretty devastating.  If we were down 1% before the drop below $6K, we would be at $5500.  But not going to drop 20% in a day without really bad news (worse than the Japanese news which mostly caused the timing of this drop).
Gotta let them buyers fill the books
They are betting that 6k holds...that 6k is the bottom.  Godspeed to them.
the thing is that while some close others are opened, so they kinda stay the same.
Longs not going down may just mean that old ones close into new ones, there are a lot of buy walls.
A long can be a good hedge if you're all in fiat. 
The difference is Central Banks hoard gold and not bitcoin.  Plus, Russia is dumping US Treasuries and buying gold as I type this.  They aren't dumping Treasuries and buying crypto currency.
I already set buy orders on LTC for insanely low prices should there be a flash crash or some insane dump. Would be hilarious if weeks from now they actually executed.
The obvious one to me is volume. Macro volume analysis (weeks/months) with Volume Relative Strength Indicator is something I've been looking at, as we're obviously trending down hard on volume quantity.

VRSI differs in that it weights the RSI against the buying/selling volume. In theory, touching on VRSI oversold territory on the weekly (30, we're on 38 as I type) will be my hard indicator of a genuine reversal in this bear market.

I'm accumulating still, but I'll be kicking it up a notch if the above comes to fruition. 
Well I bought at 16k after selling a bit at 18k, because 25k was the top ovi; a bit of swing trading before the true top never hurt anyone.

Catching the falling knife has always been a terrible call on my part, assuming the knife was something I didn't expect.
When suicide hotline is too busy to answer that means that enough people failed at it so it's probably the bottom...

Jokes aside. Don't catch a falling knife on a bear trend. Reversal might be 1% or 10% before next leg down.
When people stop posting cringey “I’m hodling cause I’m a special boi who believes” here and on ethtrader
It just dropped. Let's put it another way: when we get a big green dildo and people short immediately, they almost always get burned. Now inverse this situation. TLDR: wait
it's got a -0.3% funding rate in a bit. 

Time to long swaps! that funding rate is just ridiculous. 
Eaten like a mouthful of krill
how much was that wall?
And 2.7k of that is after the last leg of the drop.
It’s summer in the northern hemisphere...who is sitting around their computers drooling to buy bitcoin? Go outside and come back in the fall. 
5969 was the low on Binance, we're still over $100 off.
This is great news for everyone involved. 

And ultimately far, far less dumpageddon ish than if Karpeles had got it all back. He would've had to pay 60% tax. 
Seems like it is a ways off and if repayment is in crypto that is far better than cash since the trustees won't be selling. Isn't this a good thing generally speaking?
Disappointing, I was personally hoping that Karpeles would become a billionaire off this for maximum trollage
Why would the dump be related to this? It seems like a bullish news.
[deleted]
You'll end up with less money trying to do that tbh.
As a trader or investor, we are pro money, not pro respect . Being risk adverse is not a bad thing. From 70 ath to 80%ath is another 33% drop.
What candy bars though? If it's that disgusting Hershey stuff then you couldn't pay me to take it.

Exactly this. 

The world is full of people who can talk the talk.

But times like these filter out the people who can walk the walk.
welp this looks pretty panicky. hard to think it won't go below $6k


Well it has to be sub 6k move. The pattern is same and no ones buying so I do not see it stabilizing or going back up again anytime soon. Really wanting to see some fireworks.
I was looking at the time we spent between $6k and 5400 back in October (before things got completely out of hand).  Seems like a fair amount of support might be found there. Was curious what others think.
If we break down the months long descending triangle will complete and we break a critical support level, not sure it'll repeat the same behavior it had in the 7-8000s
for what it's worth I usually upvote people when they say "let's see how many downvotes I get" just to be annoying and prove them wrong, there might be people doing that too lol
Asking for downvotes is the easiest way to get upvotes.
whoa
i flipped the screen upside down: 
bearish -> bullish
downvote -> upvote
Just say you're all in on BCH - done and done.
Whilst I’m happy to admit that I’m bearish as fuck (as always) I genuinely think you may have the right idea here. RSI needs to cool off badly and it does usually happen around this time in the “cycle” that it’ll bart up again for a while. 

I still have a long term bearish outlook, but I think that $6k is going to provide a hell of a lot of resistance, plus a hell of a lot of people are short so a short squeeze would make sense. 
you wish. market is just getting lubed up. slow penetration on this drop
We're lower than Feb 6th on Binance too.
I capitulated.  But my capitulation looks different than you might think, I just can't be bothered with this garbage for a while. Bury the investment plans and fix my life in general.

My coins not in top 5 are getting absolutely spanked right now. My portfolio is almost at an ATL since November. 

Look at Binance coin taking care of business. 


Etc and bnb. Who’d have thought. 
The purging it seems. 
QUAD BOTTOM (I wanted to get in there first)
Absolutely impeccable timing Mommy 
It tells me there will eventually be a BGD but not really when
dont forget that we have 30k longs open, this can get ugly both ways..
Back to the level right before bloody sunday.  And most of them have opened just on this last little leg down here in the last couple hours.
Love how you got downvoted for that...
For anyone who thinks this guy is a soothsayer, just realize he was calling the top for a while. This is why you can't really trust people who show up out of nowhere and say they have perfect calls, they can just delete the wrong ones or ignore the wrong ones before and show that they got it right.

For example, in 5 years if we're at $50k Stokinator will be able to say he was right. But look how wrong he was at timing it.

This guy could be right, but acting like he has the ability to call the top is pretty disingenuous since he went all fiat at $13k:

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/nitLu16q-BTC-USD-1wk-RSI-Bitcoin/

that's a 50% gain he missed. He was saying "Take profits" because he was flat and was watching bitcoin run away from him. 

if he's calling the bottom here, could go to $3k with his +/- precision

He also said eth was preparing for another run at ~$770 in May, topped out at $838 and is now $450.

edit: nothing personal, and I'm sorry if I came off as a dick, but emotions are gonna be high here today and I encourage people to see things clearly and objectively and not let comments like mine or his affect your judgment. I'd normally delete this comment but I honestly think some people might appreciate it if I leave it up.

Apologies if it seems like I'm fearmongering in the opposite direction. I'd say buying low is as smart as it gets, so I'm not saying people shouldn't buy/long here. 
Or...it's a good day to accumulate more btc during the dip. 😏
And as a holder when do you think it's time to buy?
Ok, fair enough. Is buying here a mistake? 
Broken clock fallacy 
"I have my buy orders set at 1.2k at the long term trend line."

"You do not understand the math psychology of bubbles this has to go down to 1k."

"This plays out exactly as 2014. 1K here we come."

"If 6k breaks there is only air. We will see 3k this week end."

"There must be total capitulation for the trend to reverse. Look at my TA we will go as low as 1k."

"Adoption is at is as low as 2011. I predict a 5 year bear market."

"Goblin town is no where near yet."


>We will never see these prices again 

Heh, could be right
> “ Shorts are stacking up we should see a BGD soon”

This one is usually right though. You just need to see bear exuberance in this board for confirmation.
Great now that we've covered every possible comment permabulls could make we don't need to bring it up anymore

Edit: a lot of butt hurt bulls, we are just tired of you guys saying the same thing over and over again

Edit: down voting has always been an effective strategy for turning your underwater trade around 😘😘😘
This is a trading daily, of course it's all about short-term movements. 
Maybe because theres really not much long term to analyse right now? We broke down weeks ago, all you can do right now is wait for the bottom.
Holy crap GDAX. December in reverse. 
we'll see if it holds, they drop like flies.
> Looks like it's going to mid 5ks, I'll buy there

Seeing this all over the place in other subs.

(I actually bought some with fiat today.  Will again another 10% lower)
I would not have a stop at 6225. We now have immense resistance pretty much stacked up between 6600-7700. Upside is limited but we can chop around in the low 6s.
I lowered my stop to $6176 when we broke $6k. Keeping it tight to lock in profits in case we bounce higher which I think we might, but not closing in case we've bounced as high as we're going to and the drop continues (short from $6734 btw)
May not be what you're looking for, but I was short Eth from 525. Closed at 465, and I have alarms at 445 and 485. Gonna try to enjoy the weekend now, but I still keep checking out of habit :)
I closed out half in profit and am going to add back in the upper 62xx and 63xx's if it gets there, or if we chop around in this range for a day I may add more lower.
I've got stops between 62~6300.  But I already took profits, added, took profits, so the ca went from 6700 to 6500.  If it goes to higher resistance I could just reopen if it seems good to.  But I wouldn't have held it back to break even territory if I hadn't already taken profits.

Won't mind getting stopped out on the way up because also long on sept from about 5900.

If you told me two years ago that it would be $6000 today, I'd have been over the moon.
You won't bet on it 
> 7k incoming

Yeah, it's going to be very expensive to cover all those shorts -- especially the big ones done OTC -- since most of us who bought up today's dump aren't selling any time soon.

It could be that the main perpetrators have more coins to dump, but that too will be bought up quickly.  It will be quite a pickle for them when it comes time to repay what they owe. I'm sure they're scrambling at this very moment to find coins to buy quietly off-market. Most people won't even recognize it as a short squeeze when the big run-up starts, but that's what it will be -- foolish bearwhales covering after their antics today.  (Hope you enjoyed your dump, fellas!  It will be a mighty expensive one!)
Insane in the membrane
Why do so people think the bottom is "close" when longer term indicators are just beginning to turn fully bearish? Good chance this is the beginning of a second many-month bear phase.

What is the middle line that makes you open a long there? It looks like it's just the middle of a channel?
!long XBTUSD close 6433
would be, if it was shorts opening or longs closing.. but this is spot selling, its very bearish that people are unloading like this
It definitely is.  This is the bottom or very near it.

Mr. Kobayashi will need his coins back no later than 9/1/2018.  Things will get interesting when these idiots cover.
Not until we give them all the coins first for ridiculously low prices.

Yeah now I'm wondering how many have stops or if they're just waiting to get liquidated 
And I have all 3 fiat saved!
Nah 

So many people are looking for entry. 4.8K is a meme at this point. The genie is out of the bottle.
We hit 6k several times this year and every time people were sure it would break with a dramatic plunge into goblin town. Don't see any sign this time will be any different. Seems like 6k is where people start buying. Not saying it couldn't be pushed through, but there's little profit in dumping if it just gets bought up.
Oh ok, if u say so
The price could be $1K and many of the bulls won't admit defeat.
[deleted]
It's not going under 6K, and it will smash through 10K again by the end of the summer or end of year at latest.  If it touches 6K, you will see buying like you have never seen, and I am willing to bet that a great number of these recently dumped coins need to be bought back because they were borrowed.

Look at this last little dump.  Looks like $30 mil or so burned.  Dropped the price by, what, 75 bucks?  The bears will be the ones capitulating as always.  Might take a couple more months.  They seem to want to waste all their money.  Fine with me.
longterm buy or just scalp?
It’s going to be great!!
All that article said was a literal recap of what the market did today. Sooooo whats the point, who said its going to 0??
Yes, though nearly 1K longs closed in the last 15 minutes.
How so? The lower we go the more sense it makes
Sunk cost fallacy
I'm leaning towards the classic we fall into the 6200 range before having a sizeable bounce to the upside out of nowhere. Followed by another week or just under of slow upside/sideways before the final drop after that which smashes through 6k into goblin town.


Lets do this..
Lol lordy. I have been around since 2012 and that kind of perspective makes me laugh at comments line this. I don't mean to sound demeaning, but with time comes perspective. And an enormous alpha. 
When everyone is starting to think that way I'll be bullish again.
i am , i've heard that phrase many times before :)
depends on how long is long term. I'm bullish that 3 years from now the price will be higher.
Time to buy!
Sorry but you're myopic if a few months of bear market has made you think that BTC will continue to fall indefinitely. There's nothing wrong with the fundamentals, they will keep getting better even if the prices stagnate, just like in the 2014-2015. BTC is just going through a necessary correction after a super-exponential bull run that didn't reflect the adoption at the moment. It will end when all the get-rich-overnight people has left the market and the smart money has accumulated enough BTC.
I imagine you've been here for less than a year then.
That's  because you are an emotional being. 

Logically, there is nothing to be concerned about.
Even if/when it hits $5000, it will still be 2x the price last year..
That's what capitulation feels like. The bottom will be when the majority feels that way and it goes sideways for months but we're not there yet. Were getting closer but there's still too many bulls buying every "dip" 
That means we're nearing bottom!
I have that line at $5600 on Bitfinex.  Where is yours?
People are not understanding what a double bottom is. It is only a double bottom when the price goes above the local top between the two bottoms.  

So we have not had a double bottom yet.  We need to break 10000 to confirm double bottom and 13000 to confirm triple bottom.  Until that happens bear trend is still on
> We made a double bottom with 1D RSI divergence in the oversold area. SELLLL

Chart? I'm not seeing any very recent divergence that might still be in play other than a small hidden bear div from the 11th to 14th

considering that 5 years is almost 2 halvings (2020 and 2024 one) I find it very unlikely. 
Fatal flaw in blockchain is discovered.

Tight stops. That $100 bounce might have been the pullback...
Liquidation?
10 millimeters means nothing to us without knowing your monitor size. 

(Seriously though, why is MM short for million?)
BTC
I suppose it depends on what rate in fiat is offered. Many probably wouldn’t mind exiting BTC, but I reckon a decent amount will stay in, at least for a while. Certainly not going to have any short term effect on price. 
they'll get btc... with btc being at like $500
bfx
bitfinex always leads in volume.

today bitfinex phil potter quit working for bitfinex.

if you recall a month ago or so the DOJ announced a criminal probe into bitcoin manipulation, a week ago the University of Texas released a paper saying Bitfinex and Tether are likely counterfeiting money... and today... Phil resigns.

im sure it's all FUD though.
We are calling this the market going for sub 6k SLs, nothing else. 3H MFI is so overextended (1.5, lol) that it calls for a bounce real soon. 6 and 12H still have plenty of room to go down tho. Bfx also finally decided to short the local bottom. I closed all my positions, will go to sleep and look to reshort the bounce, longing this is stupid.
Just take profits on 20% of your position.  Or whatever % makes you feel better.
I had a very similar feeling and have just closed enough of my positions that I feel comfortable if we go up (and also stop losses in profit) and don't feel like I'm missing out if we carry on down.


I can't help with specific figures for you but the principle may help
Looking pretty good to me.
It's testing support @ 6k.  And, 6k will probably break and become resistance.
Keep on adding, hope you have the $ to cover
me too. So maybe I finally get my entry of $5k.
But wait! There's more...
it's gonna be 6540$ for like a week then bart down to 0 then up to 500k

Don't think so. Expecting price to fall further soon.

Yep, then a $200 bart up.
Is there anyone here that says this isn’t a crash? There’s like one guy I can think of that says this isn’t a bear market, and he’s a permabull and I’m about 90% sure he’s trolling.
I hold one single altcoin *simply* as a reminder not to buy the top. It's down 93%.
It's a crash, but we've seen bigger.
I didn't realize half a year counts as a few months ago.
Probably institutional money!

Honestly it's the opposite on bfx, more volume at the previous 6100, don't trade based on that.
We are at lows not seen since february. There is obviously still buy interest at these price levels. Sellers had to take the price this low just to off load their supply. When the sellers get exhausted the price should rally again. Macro trend is still down though.
6300 cost avg isnt bad... if you actually plan on being a long term holder 
Periods of low volatility are often followed by volatility 

Edit: instead of downvoting how about actually provide an argument why you disagree
what difference would that make

So, the price dumps 600$ on that note of positivity?

Tether did an audit? Link? Remember it has to be audited...
We touched a new low like an hour ago... Yep, sellers definitely running out of steam!
If 6k breaks, we could see it fall a decent amount under that. 
Based on what exactly?
Yup your absolutely right. 
ETH is bouncing hard atm.
didnt know you followed my TA from May1:

Which is why it's nice to be longterm in this game. A year from now all of this is going to be irrelevant, be it for better or worse.
>  and others are leaking Tether is legit 

What does this mean? I can't parse it in my head

Oh are you saying people are spreading news that Tether is legit to cover up the fact that they pumped BTC? 
> If it it doesn't drop more it looks like we failed to go down more.

....really? I mean, really?
Ah, the good ol "just a flesh wound" mentality.
We absolutely teared the hourly and 2 hour Bollinger Bands. It's normal that we stall here. If anything it's a good indication that this move was very impulsive.
This just started less than 12 hours ago. And the move up was one of the weakest yet. This has more down to go. 
It hasn’t even been 12 hours yet since the dump started.
I don’t know enough to say if $6k is a sweet spot. However...

I would say that institutions don’t want to simply *make money* from Bitcoin, they want to control / own Bitcoin.

Based on this I agree they don’t want it cheap enough for Joe Bloggs to buy it, and that “us lot” are an annoyance. I suspect once their bags are filled (in a few years) they will pump it up so high normies can’t get back in.
my take too, note: bilderbergers are just the retarded administrators, its their masters in the shadows with  their postapocalyptic scenario at stake with bitcoin
It is a scalp and you have two stoplosses at -7.2% and -22%? Is that a scalp?

Edit: I hope you trade cautiously and get your trading terminology straight.
there is already a big wall at $5500-$5600. 

the support has been moved down to make sure it doesn't crash too hard once $6K goes down...which is a pretty major indicator that $6K is going to down 
lol look at the shorts rocketing up.  Why don't people short before the drop not after it's already down 9% or so.

Surely this is the bottom, right 
I don't know if that's copypasta but... for your own peace of mind, realize you are up against proffessional traders whose goal is only to make money. If bitcoin cannot survive that then it cannot survive. Every time you trade on team spirit, for the greater good or whaever... you will lose.

Volume is pretty great in the 6k$-7k$ area.

Why fight the market if the market wants to sell coins.

This dump had significant volume but it got stopped. Let's see where this goes.
This just confirms the doubt.

Don't zoom out on a linear chart, that shit is heartbreaking.
Which hopefully makes you realize we're at incredibly critical support levels right now :/
When in doubt if it's total destruction? Well, nobody is doubting that atm. 
How far?
Sell low
$3.50
I can't see myself trading this if it goes below $2-3k because it'll be insanely boring
No sense in a poll like that because it won't tell you what price level they will move out of BTC and into fiat.  It will only tell you what their plan is and that plan will almost certainly change in the future along with the market.
45k a coin seems a good exit point for me personally.  I think we'll climb that high by the end of 2022, maybe much higher, but I don't think I could pass up liquidating at that range
I don't know, it usually doesn't follow through after the initial severe move like this.  It will probably pump then bart up and down for a few days before finally breaking 6k.

> A trader's pscyhology... feed them useless hopium and dump on them again.

That's a gambler's psychology. Many of the traders here were the ones that kept reminding people about 7800 and 8500 and 9800.
You'll be right if we hit 5k
5700 isn't even the beginning of ouch. Ouch is sub 4k. Ouch is when those who have DCA'd from 19k finally capitulate. It's when those who held all the way through this and said they would survive and never would sell, finally, after months of pressure, click that sell button because they just can't take the pain. It hasn't even begun. 
Wrong.  Again

You must put into the equation algo.
Well.... we have seen worse.
shorts will have to close too, but yeah it won't look good lol
No. In reality it’s sad to see our precious BTC lose value after having such an incredible 2017.

Although I’m short and in the end gaining more coins, it just doesn’t feel right getting satisfaction watching the price plummet. 

This is a trading sub though, so no matter what the price is the potential to make money will always be there whether the price is 1$ or $100,000k. 

Luckily, crypto is still in its youngest form and definitely has room to mature and grow. For me, I’m a young adult and I dont mind waiting a few years to watch my account value take off and this space as a whole.  
This isn't a team game of bulls vs bears.

If TA suggests we're going down and you short and it does, great trade.

If it went below 6k and TA said it'll stay there for a while, fine, scalp trading time.

If your long-term TA says [it'll go up again](https://www.moonmath.win/) then great, below 6k is a great time to accumulate. I know I'll be ramping up my DCA if we do.

Don't be emotionally invested, trade the trend.
No, I wouldn't be happy for a year because it would become boring eventually. But I would be happy in two years. 
I would rather see it go sub 6k then making failed attempts every week or two to break upwards. lol. Even if doesn't come back for a while, sub 6k zone is just as tradeable as any other zone. 
I know most of you guys are idealists first and foremost but I'm not. I like money, it buys you things and I really like things. I think bitcoin is a cool invention but IMO it's not ready for anything near prime time and 2017 showed that convincingly so the love is lost.
Exactly. I also hope that we stop the downtrend here. Personally I spend a lot using Bitcoin and it's a pain to spend so many decimals because of the low price.
> What if you get more coins but it doesn't come back for a year?

So? Bitcoin is not entitled to succeed, it has to prove itself. I personally welcome technological advances, but all this speculation and get-rich frenzy has little to do with tech. If there will be a more efficient type of money, I'll use it, regardless of its brand or price per unit in USD.

Im also not a believer of the "inevitable new ATH for BTC" maxim, so its probably easier for me to say all this.
You can also short to get more usd or eth 
It doesn't matter what we feel... TA and evidence is all that really matters. 

Which has shown for some time now that it's more likely to go down than up. I want it to go up, desperately but that's not realistic or likely at the moment, so therefore my emotions on it just don't matter.

I think it's really under a 50% chance that we'll see 10k again before the end of the year. Again I hope i'm wrong but I'm siding with the idea that we have a prolonged bear market for quite a large percentage of this year. 

My perfect scenario would be a bottom in and around the upper 4k range and then some sideways and a slow move up building momentum over time before the next bull run starts fully. 


This is why I prefer shorting on fiat margin.
> would you be really happy if it go below 6k and stay there awhile?

yes
For the past 5 months every time there is a >5&#37; drop someone finds some small news story to justify the drop.  I'm sure you could find a negative news story every single day somewhere on the internet with how big crypto is now.  

Meanwhile, whenever there is a seemingly big negative story and the market is barely affected, we hear how the market is too strong to be affected by FUD.

I can see why the smarter traders on here do not factor news into their trading.
Trolling? Prolly trolling.

Anyhow check the daily thread about a week ago. Many posts that literally said "OK, the drop is taking a breather, will probably go up to 6800ish, then another leg down". And that happened. Did we all see into the future and knew whatever news was coming? No. It's just a bear market, is all. 
what was the trend so far in 2018?
I agree. Stricter regulations on exchanges is good for crypto in the long run and a pretty lame reason for a drop.
We dropped down because this is a bear market.  In a bull market that news wouldn't even touch the price.  Similarly the strong circle news a few days ago barely touched the price
Wrong, I’ve been saying this for ages.. take a look earlier on today in this post if you don’t believe me because seeing is believing 
No, we drop because people want to sell.

And you will see that more and more the further we go down.

People have seen fortunes diminish from "I can buy a mansion" - "I can buy another house" - "I can pay down my mortgage" - "I can buy a nice car"...they don't tend to hang around much further.
"Its going down I'm shorting" while it's already going down. "See I told you so, I'm so smart!"
[removed]
Yeah, not even just for crypto market cap has that issue.  Sell 5% of it and watch the asset plummet.
There is no money "in the market". When you trade fiat for crypto, the fiat goes to whoever you traded with, not some bank account called "the market"
you make a -starlust- coin with one million coins. you sell one for one dollar. -starlust- coin has a million dollar market cap despite only one dollar being entered into the market. 
Million dollar question, my man. No way to know. 
>but is 250 billion dollars actually in the market?

Not even remotely close. I remember seeing that when it hit 300 billion, there was one of the major banking organizations estimating how it was created by about $6 billion in fiat inflow over time.

There really are only a few billion in actual fiat behind all this, and then of course Tether.

Think of it like a bouncing ball.  Every bounce gets weaker until the ball is resting on the ground rolling for the edge.  At that point it either rolls off the edge or somebody picks it up and bounces it again.
Too short of a timeframe to confirm. Need 3D or 1D at the very least.
> What the fuck do you make of this?

Lemonade
let's try again!
That wasn't a failure. It dropped 700 in a hour and simply used the 6k support to cool off and reset technicals. I'm fairly confident we will make another attempt and succeed relatively soon.
Yep. My stops didn't execute for some reason just below 6.6. Now I'm pretty much fucked, and when this position dies I'm just going to short every bounce with what I'll have left.
It probably won't dip too low in the next 24 hrs because already down 10%+ in the last 12 hrs.   
We've been in a 6 month downtrend, it shouldn't be that surprising at this point 
How so? IMO this activity stems from the same trading dynamic we've seen from January onward.  
Honestly, the last bounce up to 10k coincided with the liquidation of the largest short position ever on OKEX (IIRC?). 

With that in mind, I'm not making any moves until I see a drastic drop in longs at least on finex. I wouldn't be surprised if we keep grinding down until we hit liquidation for a lot of those positions. Of course, this ties in well with overall bear market fundamentals. 
Why doesn't it? We are in a bear market and there is little incentive to be buying a fuck ton of Bitcoin right now. Little to no adoption for real world use, the aforementioned bear market, we are coming off of a ridiculous bubble, FUD galore. 

Seems perfectly reasonable really
People like you are the reason we will see under 2k.
I know right? Who ever would have thought that the price would go down in reaction to reports of problems with exchanges. 
I think you might be able to get out at breakeven at 6.3. Don't get your hopes too far and not take the opportunity tho.
If only I had a Bitcoin every time I had read almost this exact post...
Lmao see you at 100K
> Honestly, I can't see crypto recovering from this.

Seriously? What do you mean by 'this'? Except the price, crypto is doing pretty fine. 
remember that 2x from each 1000 down requires less capital inflow ;D
BTC distributions may be limited, but greed knows no bounds.
The bottom is at 3k guys!
Probably our birthdays, maybe an anniversary. 
You should've seen how people where laughing at us back in 2014 when we kept accumulating during that shitshow at $200... History might not repeat itself but you have to understand that this mentality made us rich so we are understandably biased.
You created an account for this? Insecure much?
Bullish.

There is still the impending ETF and impending next halving, so bulls will have the last laugh.  It won't matter if the price drops down to $1000 (which is impossible), because it is inevitable that it will reach $25K in the next few years.   I mean that is just guaranteed.

please just stop with these "told ya so" comments.

I don't think it is a coincidence that most big dumps have happened over the weekends lately. I would hazard a guess that this is because new fiat isn't hitting exchanges on the weekend and the buying pressure drops a lot as a result.

Yes, the twin sister of FOMO. If you can't trade it, your problem.
I agree. I’m waiting for the trend/reversal to confirm first before making any moves. In a way though it’s kinda exciting to watch
That poll looks rather biased to me, no option for those shorting and only option for those who sold is that they did so in a "panic". Basically various scenarios of hodl and panic sell, there are other ways to trade you know.
You should have added another option: I’ve been sitting comfortably because I placed a calculated sell order at a price far higher than we are now. 😜
Moon dreams die hard. I think we'll get a stubborn slow bleed as true believers buy bounces and more and more slowly exit until there is a crypto that is fully live, working, and use cases to bring more tangible value than our current state. I think this will take 18-36 months (out of my ass, like this post)
It hasn't broken "convincingly" yet.

Another real marker is 5700 because that's roughly the lowest low from the previous panic
lol the fact that no one voted "current investment > risk tolerance; if things go bad, might (panic) sell if we go below X"

says a bit...

I think more people are in that category than they may realize

Lol short it then
wrong sub, bicash already below $1,000
I think $100,000 is more likely than $1,000. We are nowhere near the bottom in my opinion. But I would bet my life to Satan that BTC is never going under $1,000
Or there was no "reason reason" here and this is just a standard price action. We were grinding 6700 for some time now, a drop was more likely than not, especially before the weekend.
nah, technical. bulls got exhausted and we broke the wedge
Well since there's no list, I'd say any?

Here's looking at you u/diydude 
to change when you are wrong is one thing that unifies all great traders, so to post in a trading sub and have this mindset is for me very strange, but I know you are right still... :P
Really pathetic, imo.
> To a lot of people, changing positions would feel like admitting they were wrong.

Unfortunately, if you cannot do that, you are never going to be a successful trader, because you are bound to be wrong often. The job is not never to be wrong, but to manage the risk.
yes but the first step to success is ironicially to admit it :)
yes I understand it that far, but then what? What's to gain other than that?
Been reading a variation of your post too many times to count since february. When it goes so low that the bears in here seem like bulls, then we are closing on the bottom. Its gotta go lower than everyone think is possible, thats the bitcoin way.
That is fucking funny!
The series dragged or the individual books?

It's only a trilogy.

I'll give it to you that at times it's slow. It's more a mystery book with a fantasy flair than anything.
Nice find! Yeah definitely a decent return, and it does seem that some larger holders are taking profit here. 
Then it wouldn't be such a momentary spike, but rather an ~~sudden~~ average increase. Therefore I think it's safe to assume this is a single, or few, cold storages being moved simultaneously. 

However, as the link I replied below also states, this could mean nothing due to the fact that it might just be movements of cold storage coins. However, considering today's drop in value, retrospectively it seems like they were dumped.  
No Problem!
This explains it better than I'd be able too.

https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/845/what-are-bitcoin-days-destroyed
Isn't this a volume chart? It means that there's no volume on longs/shorts? It means that they aren't closing nor opening?

EDIT: and it's a mex chart... I don't get what this actually represents.
It's even worse, the other side of the market are professionals that are here solely because Bitcoin can legally be manipulated. It's not winnable for retail unless they get lucky.
that poll the other day showed the majority of people here are 25-40, with most actually 30-40 oddly enough

But I think this sub skews a little smarter than most crypto communities 
That is what I am thinking, they all just piled on when they saw weakness after 95% of the movement had already occurred.  Really dumb money.  If they were smart, the 3000 new shorts today would have already opened their positions yesterday at 6700, not today at 5900.  Basically, opening a short at the bottom, just like longing the top.
I just think there's a lot of dumb money in crypto.  No wonder really good traders love it.
Underrated comment. Missing the few first % is only painful in mind and can be disastrous on capital when trying hard. Waiting for a long wick never made anyone lose money.
Doesn't the cost/profitability of mining prevent the price from getting too far below like $4k? Seems like $4k is a break even point in [many countries](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-how-much-it-costs-to-mine-a-single-bitcoin-in-your-country-2018-03-06) . If the price goes too low for the large mining farms to make a decent profit, they stop selling their coins on the exchanges, which releases downward pressure on the coin price, preventing the price from depressing further.

Thoughts?
if 6k breaks with major sell off, then 5k7 is a good spot for short term as I expect a bounce from there.
Thanks!
You should move this to a top level comment.
The altocolypse, I though of it the first time I read the ETH WP,  but always from the technology perspective.  A nice perspective from the markets standpoint,  thank you.
Relevant money flow link you shared the other week: https://coinlib.io/global-crypto-charts?theme=dark#global_money_flow  (hard to see though on this chart the direction of btc-> alt or alt-> btc)
How long do you think it'll go on for and what do we do?
We need to start seeing people with tether cashing out. If we don't see that, then we know they're waiting to see which of the top cryptos do the best in these conditions.

My theory is that anyone who is holding tether is waiting for bargain prices on the strongest crypto. Tether will flood in to pump up whatever's left. That move will kill off a vast majority of the weakest crypto.
If we don't see expansion of volume downwards into the $5ks then we likely won't ever even get that far down. 

I think if we are going to move to a new range some explosive volume will likely occur. Technically we've just dipped our feet into it 

note that the sentiment in this sub kind of matches the potential for an explosive move downwards. People are still confident that the bottom is near/this won't go much lower- if it catches people off guard I wouldn't be surprised to see a big panic dump/capitulation dump again to $5-5.5k or something
>Nice! haven't seen you long in a while!
>
>What's your target and s/l?

5% in both directions. S/L is soft, and target can change based on market conditions. I usually set a tight trailing stop once my targets are hit. 
>What's your perspective on what may happen below 6k?

The usual. High leverage traders would open panic positions, we get some fun short term volatility, then back to the usual slow grind. 
Why the downvotes? Everybody's whining how we are going to 3k. The guy, in contrast, makes a confident move with significant funds. My question is sound. I'd like to know how he's seeing things in general. Beyond what his longs tell, obviously.
Makes more sense that shorts opening now. We may be going down, but no free lunch in this oversold market.

People googling short bitcoin is probably up again. I am sure you have a good position and plan, but for every you there are 3 idiots trying to redistribute there allowance.

right after proper hodlero assfucku (pardon my Japanese). 
the broken rectum price for me is currently around 5300. It's the line from the low of November 12th low which interjects with our original ATH trend line running down. 

They interject on 30th June ish.

After that there is one more slim hope which is the line running from the moment I feel the bull run really kicked off in 2017, on 12th October. That line sits at 4900ish and interjects with the ATH trend line on 10th July

Agreed, I think we are just looking at distribution here. Once we find the bottom, alts will get pumped back up, sold for BTC, BTC will get pumped then sold back to fiat before it all starts dumping. It's the circle of life circa 2018.
Generally in 2018, When BTC goes up, it loses market dominance.

There were a few periods in 2017, namely during BTC's monster rally to 20k that alt prices stayed the same and they lost satoshis. It's an exception not a rule though.
That's the thing about bear markets, it just won't let you out. Hope he gets some bounce to reduce the damage here.
Haha I closed the first two for a wash, only the last one remains not *that* bad brotha but thanks
Misery loves company, amigo. DCA is around $6,600
[This](http://gph.is/1nc5TZu) is how I picture you in a short after a 10% drop, but still depressed
Haha totally agree, the chapters about dogs and emotional pain is a bit too much. The middle of the third can be skipped 
Last few months have been truly interesting and I'm certain the next few will be as well but I just want those targets to hit so I can get my feet wet. Sitting on the sidelines and watching this is a good lesson but I'm looking forward for some action now. 
I sure as hell ain't!
Somewhere in my post history was a call for a $2200 bottom, but I've kind of soured on that prediction.
I’m meeting with a dude.

Hopefully it’s a Catfish and it’s a super hot girl who flashes me her tits+ all time high portfolio picture from January. 

I may just fall in Love all over again 
So is it possible for me to meet 9 of you? 
I don't have enough hands
Hes coming to my area.

Gonna show him how we do it around here 
I love you both
this last parabolic move might have added more participants but it also is the 'first' notice for a lot of people.

First you hear about it but don't join. Then you hear it again and try to figure it out. Once you get that 'Ah hah!' moment, you get hooked.

So the next parabolic will include some people just starting out and the people who are currently getting margin called trying to earn back from a small loss.
Which is one of many reasons why we aren't going parabolic again.

Well, maybe parabolic from $500 to $2000 in a few years.
>A "lower" position size seems to imply less expectancy of the trade?

Less confidence in the trade. In this case, it's with regard to my entry price, not direction. Expecting to scale in a larger position if it drops much more.

Yes, thank you. 
Can't wait to book a vacation with my profits from today while being in a comfortable long when the trend reverses. Stop being so hostile and act like an adult. 
Is it really neccesarry to include troll or tard in your post to get your point across? 

I dont want this sub to descend into calling everyone names, because thats for sure as far from being excellent to each other as it can be.

Good advice in my opinion. I have a VPN set up on my home server for precisely this reason. 
Good call. Not sure why I didn't think of that.
Right on, thanks!
Good thing I picked a resort that had a shootout happen a few months back :/

As a rule, I don't talk about crypto holdings much with people I don't know...Or stick with the "yeah, I put a couple hundred bucks in" line.
You ever add to that short? 
Any hopium helps at the moment, though this was honestly my hope; a rally to re-test $6300 since we dumped through it so quickly, then retested $6100 as support after the bounce.
if he was short I think he would be happy 
True, but I was more specifically getting at that alts led BTC in this case
who's they
the selloff from the 7k's happened late on a Saturday night in the US
Definitely a big whale shorting this huh. 23.6K BTC volume ...yet...shorts only rose by 800 BTC.

Definitely not people just realizing $6700 is too much money for BTC right now.


It's going shitty. Instead of not worrying about trading I need to think about my BTC losing a lot of value.

I'm hedged until this resolves.
The "hopium" was so high 7 months ago that I was banned by the Mods of bitcoin for saying this was a bubble.  At least the Mods of bitcoin market are more logical and allow both sides of the argument.
but after 6 months of hammering away you realize the rock isn't breaking and your hammer is now dull 😜

Just kidding...I mean not really. if we fail to make a new low soon ish it'd be pretty bullish, even if we don't bounce super high initially 
Wow this is a great image. Thanks for the explanation. 
Try drawing your trend line from 2011. If you think this is bad, try going from 1000 to 150 in 2014.  This ain't shit, and 6K is the bottom.  Keep swinging that hammer.  Soon enough your shoulders will get tired, and you'll find that buying back creates MUCH bigger green candles than the little red ones caused by selling off.

A year from now, the guys who are trying to kill Bitcoin with this asinine selloff (there's zero reason to sell right now) will have been financially ruined by this folly. I hope it's revealed who they are.  (Side note: I really hope it's Warren Buffett who's doing this. What a fraud that guy is.  He runs a glorified mutual fund that pays no dividends and vastly underperforms index funds.  If Bitcoin broke that overrated old coot, it would be awesome.) Everybody who bought the dip will now control their wealth.  Bitcoin is a beautiful thing. It's been nothing but a big trap for math-impaired bears since block 1.

By the way, I'm long from 6250, a bit underwater but not for long.

Interesting. What metric indicates that it's weaker?
Lol are you joking? Crypto is definitely not more ‘popular than ever’ right now. All the speculators from 2017 are gone. Go look at google stats and see for yourself. 
That would be an excellent strategy if he was a fortune teller
I think realistically, somebody who's never even invested before won't be able to tell when the market has reversed until it is too late/btc too expensive. It's hard/impossible enough for somebody with a reasonable TA background to do that, let alone a newb.

In my opinion, it isn't a bad place to start DCAing slowly at sub 6k, if you have a lot of patience and are able to see through more \*potential\* downward movement for an undetermined length of time (seeing that  you've been waiting since March, I think you have plenty of patience).
One of the brothers has a medical condition that caused facial deterioration.  The exaggerated plastic surgery is the best they could do and is supposedly better than he would otherwise look.

The other brother then opted for the same, as a show of support.

Haha nope, I managed to get some rocks down the drain and had to take it partly apart 
100% agree
Even you are not overly pessimistic. The long term matters.
dont worry im sure we'll get some new tethers right for a pump at 6k
> dumb money on bitmex continues to short the bottom vs smart money on BFX who does not...
> 
> 

I mean you could totally be right...I didn't mention that but it's an obvious possibility, haha. 

Personally I'd be a bit surprised at retail interest in bitmex lately given unfavorable trading conditions- so I think it's large players hedging their positions without exposing them on bitfinex's public margin position data. 
Bitmex shorts/long are always at parity. It just means that more coin is in leveraged trades. :)
It's on the left on contract details.

Where you see the funding rate. It says Open Value: 92,772.9820 XBT

You can see this for any contract on bitmex

Nah. Expensive drop.  Will look miniscule in a couple of years.
This guy trades.
Yep, had one on Mex with more contracts sells than my position to transition into a short, without reduce only checked, at 6479. When I saw the price this morning I was expecting to see some gain to offset the stop loss, and instead just a whole lot of red.

Now I don't know if I should wait to sell higher or just swallow this shit sandwich and close now.
„Didn‘t it get hacked?“
Haha This triggers me even when said sarcastically :)


But why? This is a brutal fast-paced market. It's difficult to handle and hard to master. Risks are taken, mistakes are made. At least you try. Carry on. It's always easy to sit on your hands and be a smartass afterwards with hindsight.

Sure. Then it'll be $1000. Then they'll eventually buy $300 XRP a couple of years later. 
shhht honeybadger will be scared when he hears this. Please beg them to reconsider their collective target of $3.000k.
Did it get eaten or pulled?
Do you think that when a wall goes down the price must drop? I've seen this specific wall go away, the price drop, and then green dildo. Not saying it will happen now, but a trading decision or stop based on a wall is totally amateur. Sorry.
Yeah, should have done it sooner and would have worked but missed it and didnt want to enter @5265
Never say never...
Yeah, but that happens every week 😂
I think I'm of the same opinion. It feels like we've 'done' the quick bounce and instead we need a protracted period of time at lower prices to build up momentum again
what the fuck are you talking about no one cares, are you living in a hole? goldman just bought poloniex, their circle launched crypto trading again. look at localbitcoin volume rise in 3rd world. if this whale wasn't dumping coins at a loss, we'd be still heading up as buying still is larger than selling on aggregate. also: next financial crisis is due and it will be day to day, retail deposits frozen. kiss goodbye to your loved fiat old friend. what do you think the Bitcoin price will be then? maybe it will be in 9 month, maybe tomorrow, but will you take that risk?
I shorted 1 EOS at .0019230...:(

Ez gainz with alts in 2018:

Wait for a BFX margin-enabled alt to get listed on a new major exchange. Sit through the pump. Short the hell out of it vs btc / eth. Don't even have to worry about timing the top too much or what the crypto market in general is doing. 

This, right here. No one was expecting 20k in December. It's possible we'll see a low that not many expect, either.
That was earlier on and when the price was below that amount. I'm not sure if the majority of people are just Trend followers or if it's a psychology thing. If the price is rising it seems like you start hearing larger and larger dollar amounts. If the price is falling you keep hearing smaller and smaller dollar amounts. There are quite a few people that would say right now if Bitcoin hits 5000 I'm buying but if it actually hit 5000 they would say no wait 4000 and so on. 

If there's anything that ever makes me consider leaving the space it's definitely all the gamblers and scammers. 


You're lucky you bought bitcoin below $15k 
> My problem is that I know full well that most of my alts will die, but I don’t know which ones. It could be all of them but what if it isn’t? Which do I hold? That’s the dilemma that I face and many others as well.

Agreed, you are literally re-stating the dot-com bubble. Which of our portfolio will be Amazon and which will be Pets.com? For the currency tokens, like Bitcoin (or whatever you picture could be a global currency or peg), this is super hard for me to determine. I mean you get into hypothetical of V = PQ/M, 10% of golds total holdings, etc. and it is an endless debate.

Now for the tokens that give you access to some network, presumably those tokens need to give you access to something of value in return.  Other users would want to trade for these tokens to receive a benefit ($.0001 to send an email if internet plumbing was tokenized or $.15 per mile of Uber tokens) or pay a dividend for holding it based on value the network provides. There needs to be some incentive to own it eventually, after speculation ends.

So yeah, you are right, there will be some coins that do provide value, no idea right now what they are or how they should be valued, personally.

Everytime someone says 90% of the alts didn't make it or "died" makes me want to scream it's such a outlandish lie. How many can you even think of I doubt I could name a dozen and I've been in crypto since 2011. And most of those were never serious and joke coins Ron Paul coin Kanye's coin BBQ coin etc. Dogecoin is still very much alive. Even namecoin hit it's all time high last year like everything else

What's the point of doing multiple dailies if we're all sorting by new? Or do some people not sort by new haha
I'm not sure that we need multiple dailies at all.  And I was here back in the day.
Multiple dailies would make reviewing them a nightmare.

Eventually the alt thread will regain popularity, right now BTC is so clearly leading the show, so no point.

At worst, it's a useful Honeypot to catch shitcoin discussion
the weekly is a lower low unless you're counting those insane wicks...Which I don't know why you'd be saying "the weekly" then 
where the hell are you seeing a higher low test?!
i've seen a few 3k's calls , but definetely not the big majority 
No. 

Previous ATH is usually a good bottom (so 1200), but Bitcoin isn’t a shitcoin anymore and I doubt it’ll go that far. There should be support around 5K and 4K, but bear market lows get scarier than people expect. 
4,400ish would be nice but it's hard to tell in advance. You'll recognize the capitulation once it happens. Longs on Finex are still above 30k. When 5-10k of them close at a loss on a big red daily, that's where you start looking for a longer-term entry, maybe even try to catch the wick.
Lower than anyone thinks is reasonable.
We sort of had the double bottom in April when we touched 6K and bounced back. Now we’re at this level for the third time and we’re gonna bounce at 6K again? I don’t think so, we’re too weak to be so close to this critical level. Market doesn’t show confidence and I think the low volume indicates many people are waiting for a bottom. It needs a good capitulation before the reversal, at this point we’ll have to fall below 5800
I’m not confident with 6K being the bottom, I’ll try to pick some up around 5K, even more in the 4K range, and make sure I have cash to buy a lot in the 3-4K range 
If after that kind of shitshow they can't stay under 6k convincingly then I would say they're exhausted. 
They said it every step of the way down from $20K and they will be saying the same thing at $1000.  You can't fix stupid (or delusional).
>we just had a freefall from 6.9k.

I would think that should cause a hell of a lot of panic, actually. 
For real. Hes someone the mods should look at because hes just spamming the hell out of the daily with no substance at this point. He's probably lost a lot of money on all his longs, calling bottoms.

Thanks for clarifying at work so not able to check the charts.

My price alerts are going off left and right though. 
Thanks for this reply - I'm going to do some research on VRSI much appreciated.
Have you heard of bearish rsi divergence?
Jokes aside, people don't matter. At this point the market is moved by big holders such as hedge funds, old whales, and big speculators. FOMOers have probably been already shaken out.
Thanks - good advice, I appreciate it.

I'm waiting and watching on the sidelines. I'm going to try and catch at the bottom but I'm obviously not confident that it can be done with any accuracy. Even if I'm lucky enough to time it perfectly it will remain uncertain and there will be sell pressure which may force me to re-exit early. 

For that reason my tactiocs are going to be to allocate 15&#37; of my funds to the "bottom" and to hold back until I can see that any recovery has some legs and can run. At that point I will feed in another 25&#37;.

Combination of sentiment analysis and indicators are going to be my tools.
Can vouch for this. Had been holding an underwater short for 5 days until now!
It was at 1400 btc earlier today

I'm not talking about that low, I was talking about the previous low. Also I did say only the 6000 remains so I was clear about that.

Plus the low on Binance was 6000

This is all organic. Longs/shorts almost without movement.

Talked to /u/haserfauld yesterday about similarities. It behaves almost exactly as 8k and 7k range.

If this goes the same we should see couple hours of sideways followed by sub 6k push.

TBH I think low 5k might be the bottom of this whole dump. At least short/mid term.
Well, the volume is kinda low. If we get good resistance at 6k, I would feel pretty confident.
Guys, what's your personal projection on what happens next? You think the market will look for a solid bottom to rebound or will we grind whenever we stop at for some time? 
I'm only watching two exchanges, although in real-time noting daily moves, and according to watching Bitfinex on tensorcharts.com, and this is where a major buy wall appeared right after the last push up. Today before the dip buy walls literally disappeared. I am scaled at watching more significant "heat action" (0.5 scale for vol > 5) and the most major moves came in bigger volumes, sells x > 5. So this kinda looks like somebody pulled the rug from under 6650. Over last 2 hours "shrimp" action (x < 1) seems neutral to positive. 

Edit: Relevant screenshot, https://i.imgur.com/ilnVV1n.png, scale 0.5 at vol>5
Volume will be the biggest help as we analyze it in realtime as it dumps. Too much money and coin exchanged hands between 5-6k on the way up for us to just blow through that range. A lot of support will be found there like you said. 
I have a policy to downvote any comment that dwells on voting at all.  Especially ones complaining about it.

Yup like I said, people really are on edge around here.
The "cycle" just started ~14 hrs ago. What do you mean this time in the cycle? We're just getting started here.
12 hour and daily RSI can get much lower, and only recently have.
The 2k of shorts that opened for sure hope you are right :)
I think the 5's will be scary, but ok.  Real panic "omfg its the end" sentiment will be the moment 5k breaks.
Binance coin is so interesting because there is incentive to buy it while ~~dumping~~ *trading* other coins.  It's like the anti-shitcoin shitcoin.
And tether just outside the top 10
Same. My portfolio is almost entirely composed of low cap alts. I’m taking some major hits. I can’t sell right now because I’m not at home, and my private keys are. It’s pretty likely that a good chunk of my alts will never recover from this actually... but oh well. At least one of them should do well, and that should cover the losses of the other ones. 
Apparently people care about immutability more now? I don't get it.

It probably wasn't as irrationally pumped up to begin with.
quadruple bottom would be the most stupid and surrealistic scenario imaginable..  wouldn't be surprised bitcoin does what nobody expected, though.
boollish. 
mothers know best
Let’s move sideways for 65 hours 
The longs may well be fiat 1x buys for tracking purposes. They've been there since 10k. Shorts on the other hand are guaranteed to need to cover.
He also went flat and called the top at $13k. Missed 50%. So it could go to $3k and he'd have about the same accuracy with his predictions.

As long as he keeps calling the bottom from here he'll be able to say he got it eventually 
That's usually the way it works around here.
the rule #1 in crypto trader subs. If downvoted and not just trolling or spamming, you are being right
Kind of agree with your point, but let's not forget that going full fiat at 13k is still way better than most of currently active "lolol short this shit to goblintown" bears are doing.

Likewise you are saying Stokinator is massively wrong -- well sure he is right now, but if the prices reverse and go for a new high before he gets completely wiped out, he'll probably be better off than most of those fishing for the lowest bottom or trend reversal confirmations with his entries here.

Only the most lucky motherfuckers get the perfect entries. Missing the top / bottom by 50% honestly isn't even bad for Bitcoin.
That's funny because I actually went long ETH and have no clue what this deleting is about. Also everyone has an agenda this is the internet. If I can influence something to my benefit I will just like anyone else.

Haha, I'm sure it will turn to 4.5k if we ever get to 5.5k. Moving goal posts
Wow did you get stopped out? that was close 
Thanks. Really puts things in perspective.
[deleted]
And if you were smart, you would have sold at 15k+
Won't have to
If you compare this downtrend to 2014-2015, it has been moving much faster. It's not unreasonable to expect bounces (and the eventual recovery) to come quicker if dumps are coming quicker, too. Not to mention that if you are long-term bullish on cryptos without being fanatical to the point of never taking profits, chances are you don't care *that* much about really nailing the bottom.
It's interesting isn't it. Most people believe that this is the nearing the end of the bear cycle instead of the beginning even though we haven't made a new low (well, a significant one, bfx just made a new tiny one) in like 4 months. 

I guess we won't really know for a few months
Well that's why I said assume no lower than ~$5k basically :P probably should have written that into the poll

Quit being such a styx in the mud
People are looking for entries to sell higher on a bounce, not to hodl. Like, I will buy 5500 but then i'm gonna sell 6200.
^ sell signal
why 4.8k? Hear many diffennt numbers, 5.5k, 5.2k, 5k, 4.8k, 4k, 3k, 2k, 1k.... just everything, everybody gives a random guess. nobody knows, as always. 
Every time we've hit, the bounce has been weaker, candles have been closing lower, and this time we are hitting it after a triangle breakdown with targets much lower. I would bet like $100,000 that we close this weekly candle under 6k
what if miners/exchanges/big investors have an non-spoken agreement/interest not to let this thing go below 6k?
I wouldn't. 
Sorry bro...RIP when you get liquidated. I've been there.

With the price of last year ranging from 1k to 20k, I don't quite make sense of your comment
This is Bitmex, so it differs a bit
I should have been more clear. I was only calling the double bottom on the last 2 weeks (6300$ ish). 
Has there never been a time in market history when the market didn’t obey the TA lines and analysis?

Feel free to comment, hate, or like

I should add that the bullish divergence apply after a lower low on price, which as not confirmed yet. But it would take quite a beatdown (meaning 5k$) for the price and RSI to both make new lows.
Confirmed
[deleted]
What're your motivations for posting so much? Just curious 
Cash. Man. Which you do not have.
No crash
Correction... well that's what the T&A people say

Going down 400$ is not a crash. Have experienced worse when we were at 600$ and 1200$

Don't buy the top, also don't sell the bottom.
DCA?
Watching the Bitfinex chart, I see the same pattern.

What I'm point at is the volume of the dump leading back to the horizontal support is significantly greater during this drop than the previous ones. 

Dropping from 7800$ to 7000$, there was absolutely no volume. Volume increased once we broke the horizontal support. This time, there is fresh volume from 6800$ to 6100$ which is the new horizontal support.
Not during this bear market, I'm not. Just trying to catch some knives. Just got cut this time. I still think we'll be in this range for a bit longer.
Yeah, 5% down after a period of low volatility is high volatility. Just wasn't expecting 10% down.
Daily bullish divergence is a strong bull side indicator.  It means that despite the price being lower the strength of the push was weaker than the previous dip.
I am not saying it is, but how can you tell the bottom is not 6k?
What if I told that it is not the news that creates price movements, but the price movements that create the news.
Nope they didn't do an audit, just an "it's good guys" from a law firm.

Nothing gets by Patrick!
I think your missing the point here dude
I also had to read that twice but I believe he's he's trying to say that we failed to go down more than the recent lows.  
So the Jews? Never heard that rhetoric before... Get a fucking clue
I think you misread his comment- he said "scaling in" not "scalping in"
If my surgeon had a margin of error that large I wouldn't let him near the scalpel.

edit: or her. \#respek
No, I hope it's a long term hold, but refuse to ignore the downside risk. The 5k stop would be for purchases closer to that price.
Trading is for idiots who like to pay 35% tax and try to time the market, I learned that lesson. But thanks for your backhanded reply & misunderstanding of my statement
That's exactly what he wants you to think
Or anyone who opened a short position in the last hour is about to get wrecked..
Wow you called that.
No shit. That's why I said "push these noobs to fill his 6k order". In order to fill 6k it will go below then, take it back up.
Yeahh + 1000BTC shorts in the last hour on Bitfinex.
Total volume for the hour is 4000BTC. So 25% of the volume are shorts.

And the 6k$ is not even broken.
> Why don't people short before the drop

I know right? makes you realize this market is really pretty silly- people don't think ahead 
Absolutely not.

However, I find it pretty amusing when people assume things about me. I'm pretty bearish right now, with the most bullish I really see this going is stagnation in the 6-10k range until 2019 and I view that range, particularly the top, as fairly unlikely. That doesn't mean it's impossible for shorter term recoveries.
What did I say that was incorrect?

Estimating the RSI, we could probably close as low as 5.8k today or in the coming days, maybe even lower with a wick even lower than that, and *still* form a bull div. And it only forms once the local low is confirmed.
Just meant ahead of the last drop - but yea overall you are right
well I'm relieved he didn't write all of that lol
The type of chart doesn't have any impact on the data in the chart. The log chart is more readable because rapid exponential growth makes 90% of the chart look like a flat line near 0.  Changing the chart type only changes how people *feel* about it.  

And moon math assumes that the same trend will continue forever, which is a classic mistake.  Exponential growth like this has never been sustained forever.
Stare at the weekly for a while... there's clearly a larger trend at play, and it's a bearish trend. So do you:

A) Short in the direction of the trend, risking a reversal at historic support levels
B) Play small ball in a downward channel, trying to catch the swings
C) Try to predict a reversal, assuming support levels hold
D) Wait for an upward trend to establish itself, then ride it up

Thoughts on risk/reward for any of these options?
I’m sure a lot of people have entry avg a lot lower than we are now.  I guess that was the wrong way to ask that question.
New spin on an old favourite. Nice
Me neither. That's when you go long and just forget, and make way more than trading.
It's not boring to make profits, at least for me.  Volatility is what creates opportunities for profits, not the market price.
Yeah I think it I could even go up to 7000 ish before going back down 
Bears aren't "nervous" after a 12% drop, they're in profit.
you really think bears are the ones who are nervous here? 
> increasingly ~~nervous~~ erect bear

FTFY
We hit 5k's today and will soon drop below $5k.
I swear the way you describe it is more horrific than those last moments of Titanic sinking into the deep ocean, which is true btw!
Damn, that's a horror story.
Yes!!! Zero is a real possibility!

Finally! Who would buy! No one. Zero by end of 2018?
Careful what you ask for, the Internet troll is an agent of chaos and wants nothing more then to spread misery. Summoning them here now is asking for a mild annoyance.

Luckily myself and a few others on reddit belong to a secret organization of Internet troll hunters that will stop at nothing to annoy these trolls into submission.

When you need us most, we will be there, just don't go looking for them
Shit you're not joking. This is some nostalgic stuff. 
Thanks that useful.
Pretty soon it'll likely be much worse... 
This is my thinking, on all accounts. Also we are most likely going through a shakeout. All the barting and engineering as we've just seen at sudden way up to 6700, weird grinding there and now the rug getting pulled. My personal position is that long term it's hard to imagine Bitcoin not "making it", though. It just won't happen overnight. 
I guess this is technically the right answer, but holy shit is the bear market boring. More interest -> more volume -> more volatility yadda yadda.
If everyone had only traded the trend in Nov/Dec 17 then we wouldn’t have had that run to $20k. The whole way the indicators were for selling.
Lightning will bring it back... with added gusto due to having no wait times.
unfortunately I think this is going to be the prevailing attitude in 3-6 months which is why we may end up seeing some low 2017 prices. People who got in and made mad paper profits are gonna get out cause they're bored/disillusioned
Damn, if that's all that really matters then this is one hell of a lame existence, glad I don't see it that way. What matters so much exactly? Being right in order to make money here and there? It's always just rough odds anyway.

I find both pain and gain to be very exhilarating, equally good, and when it comes down to it, while we explore these extremely low prices, I will take all the pain in the world if it means doing my part to support growth once again, for the ecosystem that has already changed my life. It can change it again for the better or for the worse, I will accept either very happily, this means more to me than wealth ever could (any amount of it). 

After this much total loss in the market over many months now, never could I be apart of perpetuating the trending bearish narrative, simply defies meaning and is an insult to all that has been built so far. 

I'll always hone my ability as a trader and exercise those skills when the times are right, traders provide liquidity and stability. But what we see today being pushed by many of our own, just appears to be sad and malicious from my point of view.
Lol why? So you can have more time to hoard Zimbabwe coins?
Sure.... 

Bear market will finish soon
People sell for lame reasons sometimes
So, China and Korea ban didn't touch the previous bull market?
Nope
That's true for all trades, except the ones that miners do. Being the trade of electricity, labour and investment in equipment for coinbase BTC. If we assume that competition between miners is efficient (I know that's not always true, but let's assume), so that the mining costs approach the price of the coins, then it can be calculated how much money originally "went into" the market. 

Which is then the sum over all blocks mined of coinbase * BTC price at time of mining. Though, I would call this money *put into* the market, not money in the market.
Using that logic, can I make a -starlust- coin with 1 trillion coins? Would that push the market cap up to over a trillion?
Nope, wouldn't work. It wouldn't be listed on Coinmarketcap or any other site like that unless it is traded on some markets and in that case, there would be more trades like that and an actual market price.
daily volume usd/BTC is 2-6 bio usd. yearly?

This. Fucking kids getting REKT calling bottoms. Markets don’t just reverse instantly.
If only I had a Bitcoin for every downvote when posting something bearish...
!remindme 5 years 
don't think we're going to 100k but this is gonna surprise everyone when it has a strong relief rally 
He's either a comedian or deluded. Crypto is here to stay. Most these people weren't around during the rise to $1200 at the end of 2013 and the 2 year bear market that ensued. 

This stuff is cyclical.
This is called Bitcoin Markets, right? Of course I'm talking about the price. I think crypto as a speculative asset has peaked. It needs real world adoption for it to grow again.
I was laughing too (or actually crying because I had BTC), but couldn't forsee that Bitfinex would create imaginary tether money to pump the price to $20K.

And actually, I know that was only part of it.  But BTC already mooned.  Bulls already won...you won the freakin' lottery..won the Super Bowl World Cup Series Championship.  Some of you just don't know when take your trophy and the payout and live a wonderful life.  
are you nostradamus?
Also I think bigger players and pro traders who don't work on weekends tend to sell on Fridays to take profits and minimize the risk to their positions over the weekend. Sell into relative strength now, adjust on Monday to whatever happens in the meantime. That'd be common sense. If that's not how pro trading works, please correct me. 
Why is nobody seeing the same thing as me. $80.4 just before 6pm EST. Now $86, and it's just shy of 7PM. That's about 7%
$80.4 to $86 on Gdax. 6.9% percent bounce in under an hour. Not great volume, but like I said, it's something. Probably not the bounce we're looking for, but it's hopeful.
And dumping ~12% in <18 hours. 
That the Earth is round. Turning flat-Earther for the weekend

that wall is there since April (and tested 3 times) so I doubt it will get pulled.
It has more reasons for value increase than the zero btc has.
Lol right? I was thinking just that 
Hitler did nothing wrong. You should update it's 2018 already.
> That poll looks rather biased to me

The poll presumes a hypothetical worst-case scenario (by construction it ignores the best-case scenario that we bottom out here). 

I wanted to poll the hypothetical market reaction to a worst-case scenario (whatever that might be). By polling everybody their "financial plan" I wanted to see if a capitulation event is even realistic.

I was convinced so many times a bitcoin-apocalypse was imminent, but nothing really spectacular seems to happen (only the first time we dropped to 5.7k we were free-falling, now things are just much more slow/boring). This might indicate that most people have a plan which they feel comfortable with (and the up/down movements are just daytraders playing their games); eventually an equilibrium between buyers and sellers will be found, without the need for some capitulation.

If the poll would indicate that most people don't really have any plan and are not mentally prepared for a hypothetical worst-case scenario, an actual worst-case scenario seems more probable.

> no option for those shorting

> Basically various scenarios of hodl and panic sell, there are other ways to trade you know.

Question was not about trading per se, but the total amount in crypto which people are exposed to (and which they feel comfortable with). Being net-short would not really contribute to a massive capitulation sell-off forced by being over-exposed.

maker stable coin seems legit

Whilst I think that sub-$1k is unlikely any time soon, I don’t think having the “worst crash in history” is that unlikely - the value was massively over-inflated in the run up to Christmas last year. I wouldn’t be surprised in the slightest if the value drops significantly over the rest of 2018. 
Yes, read about stanley druckenmiller and 1987 crash :) 
Hmm interesting points all around.

Yeah I think with the sudden price movement plus sudden coin movement, it's a reasonable assumption that there is a meaningful correlation, and it is less likely to just be coins shuttling around wallets.
Thanks +1
Woot I'm in the majority!
I'd agree with this in a way. I feel like TA in this market is very much centered on what the clairvoyant traders on tradingview have to say.

"above this point, position to go long, below this postion go short." It's mindless as far as I'm concerned.
Mining does not affect price at all.  Only the other way around.

Mining farms will continue selling coins because they have bills to pay that must be paid.  The least efficient of them are already in danger of going out of business.  When they do, the difficulty drops and then the same number of coins need to be sold by the remaining miners.
>If the price goes too low for the large mining farms to make a decent profit, they stop selling their coins on the exchanges, which releases downward pressure on the coin price, preventing the price from depressing further.

Are you assuming that the miners will turn off their mining rigs en masse? If they do, new blocks no longer show up, and the network itself will become deeply compromised until the next difficulty adjustment. 

I can imagine a downward spiral that goes something like this: miners switch off their rigs, block times increase to say, 20 minutes. Price falls because the network is less useful, block times increase to one hour, and price falls more. Eventually, the price falls so much and so many miners shut off their rigs that we can never reach enough blocks for a difficulty adjustment again.

Probably unlikely, but point is, miners switching off isn't a good sign for the price or bitcoin in general.
That is certainly one theory. The other is that when it reaches that equilibrium that it forces miners hands to dump to ensure profitability and therefore increases downwards pressure exponentially.
No problem. I always appreciate non shit posts and non short term TA posts, since I just try and trade the trend. Good luck! 
will do
It took me over a year of fucking around with ethereum before I realized this weakness. That was long enough to make a healthy profit but not long enough to get rich. If only I were about one year more stupid.
Yea the direction is kinda important.
When there's a storm you wait it out and rebuild after. Next time, build it strong enough that it can weather those conditions.

Everyone who rebuilds using the old mindset will get crushed again and again, until they learn.
How would you cash out of tether?   You can't directly redeem tether for fiat,  is that correct?  You'd have to trade the tether for something with a fiat pairing?  


My thing is, why it is any more likely today than it was on the 13th when conditions were more favorable for a breakdown deep into 5k's? The only thing I can think of is if it's because were testing 6k again, that said it's more oversold now than it was then.  

Edit: oh yeah...trade war stuff sigh
Thanks! best of luck sir!
Many thanks for answering! 
Some kid on bitmex was asking for $50 in trollbox the other day.

I asked him why he needs it, he says he got liquidated.

I ask how much, he says $1000. I ask him what was his entry/position

Dude longed $6700 at 20x -________-

I was legit gonna give him $50 but then I realized giving money to these people on bitmex is literally throwing it away. It's like giving money to people at a casino

Tell me the secret to your optimism.
This. Over the long haul, *most* alts will underperform BTC. Even coins like LTC have been as high as .05 and it's .014 right now, and LTC is a solid more established coin. If you can time the market, alts will perform better but most alts will probably go nowhere near their ATH in satoshis again. By the time a next big bull run occurs, there'll be shiny new shitcoins that get hyped
> It's an exception not a rule though.

Really? You mean for the past 12 months...?


> Generally in 2018, When BTC goes up, it loses market dominance.

That's correct, weirdly enough! There's a correlation between Bitcoin gaining market share and its price approaching cyclical bottom: https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/
 
Examples: 1 April, or 28 May. 
Looks like a little something is happening right here’s

That's the same thing people said in 2015, you know. "We will never see $1000 again, too many ppl are too smart for this now."
Bitcoin reacts to currency crises. These next few years will be interesting as trade-wars & inflation hit countries. 

Consider the current world markets, some being at near ATHs, what comes next? A crash or a cooling of period.

In 2015 I also had some doubts that bitcoin would bubble again. When bitcoin exchange rates approached 10k, I thought it was 'the top'. I was wrong.
No problem. Tried something like your position but was already stopped. 
Will be staying out for a bit to try and short some possible retrace. 
I agree, sir. I will edit.

I didn't, but I have been messing with a second short on June. Basically playing it really tight/aggressive. Too many shenanigans to try to add it to the bot, and I wouldn't want anyone to think I was recommending it. It's basically a 10x 20% short CA @ 6180 (spot price) with stops just over 6200. Very close stop. It's basically a dice roll counting on 6200 holding as resistance. 
Pretty sure Stok just looks at every chart with a 1/ in front of them.

The tail will wag the dog when it's a combined market move. Overall, Bitcoin has remained more stable.

Making money off you seems like a decent reason.
Google trends =/= awareness, I'm talking about the share of the world that knows what crypto is. There is a shitload of institutional money looking to get into the space. 

Mass adoption comes in waves, the last wave was most investment nerds and tech companies, the wave of your grandma buying a bitcorn to pay for groceries is near 
Well the safer trade is to wait for a breakout or even for an uptrend to form.
Oh yikes, that's really sad and wholesome simultaneously. 

Thanks for the info! :)

Ha! And here i thought you were a Pokemon all this time. Well GL trading the corn, sir.
No, not if I want to stay married :-p
To be fair I have no faith in BTC at all in the long term, but equally I’m well aware that I could be proven entirely wrong, and I don’t think that’s particularly unlikely. I’ve been wrong many times before and I’m sure I’ll be wrong many times again. 
oh yeah totally and the smart money is happy to take the bottom shorter's action which is why you see the overall interest incerease ;)

But is there a chart showing changes over time? I honestly can't find anything. Or do you chart that yourself?
Wouldn't you expense to see open interest measured in BTC rise on a 10% drop? I guess maybe not really, since there's no fiat option on MEX, but it seems like you would. 
Good ~~b~~hot
Good for you. I was just messing with you.

That was only the tiniest taste of bear. 

Bitcoin is going to -10usd. 
The practice
If this issue hadn't screwed you would you go long here? If not you should close, brother. No sense letting buggy exchanges and endowment bias overrule your intended trading strategy. :)
I got burned doing something similar recently.  Better to not try clever things like that in most cases.

Less clever, but I really wanted to have a market order to add to my short at 6600, but was afraid to since it's always bit me in the ass.  Then I slept through that drop so I couldn't do it manually, and had to be on my way to work as it continued.  Added a little in a less than idea place, but oh well, can't have it all.
nah that's just a rumor, it was actually the CEO of bitcoin who got hacked
Lol that only works if you didn't FOMO in December like I did.

How is that better than a database?

Are people saying 300 XRP is possible?  That would be sick.
wat
eaten
Was too fast to check orders but i think it was eaten 
It was a gamble. This wall stood strong 2 times, this time the selling was just too much.

I don't do that on every wall. Actually that was the first.

the way I see it, the memory of the pain of the bear has to be distant and the slate needs to feel clean/reset. Aka a prolonged accumulation period
Oh boy... You are biased as fuck.
Nice entry though! I just noticed that there's still a premium on the new September contracts on XRP & ADA on Bitmex. Crazy if you think that Sept futures for BTC are lower than spot price
What date was that because tons of people did in the middle of December but almost no one did at the beginning of 2017. If you look at this correction and ask people how low they thought it would go in January I can promise you you would not hear 6000.

Now the price is just feeding on itself. People see 6 and so they say 5 if they see five they say four and if they see four they say 3 and so on all the way down to zero.

That's how a lot of people on the Internet seem to be wired. I guess what just disgusts me about them is they have no interest in the technology or adoption or the developers. It's straight gambling
I'll wait for 3800
Law firms can have guilty clients?

I know you've gotten a hard time from this sub at times (and I've been critical before) but your work is appreciated!
appreciated.
Well... F...ck...

Make a descending wedge from tops and bottoms without the wicks. It should close around 5k...
I think I've seen such call too previously. Its just like calling 10k. I think anyone call 3k right now can't see things clearly. While there is a probability of it, I think it just won't happen instantly.. 
ATH retest of 1150 is the bottom
The technical target for this drop is also looking around 5100 based on the pole of the last bear pennant.
Pretty much agree completely. Buys set from 3k to 5k. I'm a super bull but 6k bottom just doesn't feel like max pain... I feel like that would be too easy for the bulls. So I'm eagerly eyeing a dip here.
We are hardly above 6k? We dropped by over 10% today and a 50% retrace of such a move is very common, it's like the easiest golden rule you'll ever find in trading. We ranged upward for over a week and we took it all out in one day, if anything buyers are exhausted. But that is just a non argument because you can't possibly know any of that. For all you know people are transferring coins to dump at the next breakdown. 
Geez this sentiment is 10k in reverse, all over again, and again.

This damn giant triangle of 2018.
How on earth can you single handedly carry those goal posts? Here let me help you... A daily close under 5K will confirm we are going lower otherwise this is just the last part of Wyckoff Inc's spring/summer accumulation of BTC.

There you go goal post moved until next week.
I don't think it's normal for btc to fall more than 10% in a day except for big flash crashes after blow off tops, so there's not a whole lot of room to go lower yet.

If this thing does moon or bottom out here, I would actually think it's hilarious. It would the most obvious and ridiculous double bottom setup ever. 
Possible: 21 million bitcoin buy wall can appear at any price level.

Impossible: 21 million bitcoin sell wall can appear at any price level.

lol just saw this on twitter
Descending volume, failed breakouts, will dump on volume.
But look at the fat W Bottoms with bullish volume, clearly the bear market ended and the market is ready to head higher, right? Maybe.
Think there are traders out there wearing adult diapers or pissing into jugs?

Hmm, that was a bit rhetorical, of course there are.
I'm not short, I've just been here before.
It's also been pointed out that longs on finex could be 1x positions and therefore not in any danger to be liquidated/tough to squeeze
Want advice: look at this sub. Pro traders are getting rekt or sitting on the sidelines watching this. Nobody is trying to long as r/r is just dramatic here. Mike went on a small long, but it's like no money for him, chewy went on a hedge after days of watching the market, sloppy is short from above 9k and thinking where he should exit haserfauld went short above 6.7 and holding...

Longing here is a gamble. Shorting here is smaller gamble but still a gamble. If you can't short then wait it out. I'm like more convinced there's gonna be another leg down before up, but TBH it's a coin toss, we can go once again to 6.8 before going down below 6k.
It's propped up by nothing but hope.
I get the gist that it's almost unprecedented in Japanese bankruptcy law, but the whole freaking shitshow was almost unprecedented. 
That would be very funny to see a new Mt Gox -- ideally decentralised this time!
Not in my experience. I'll take Belgian or even Cadburys over that muck any day of the week. 
Probably a very small amount because they'd likely be going off soon. 
You mean support?

No. Support 5.6 as ATH downtrend line and 5k as last resistance before sick bull run. We never dropped back below 5k after we broke it. This is the last bastion that I could think of that could make a reversal. If it breaks... Well... A lot of long-time holders will be put to a test after seeing their sub 5k entries, that were green for last 9 months and generated almost 5x returns, are turning red...
This isn't V-shaped drop. We should see U bottom, means it'l be long over before majority will notice that.
Sounds about right, had a feeling it looked like distribution/someone was getting ready to pull the rug out. There aren't any huge walls on the way down anymore. 

I was seeing a frickin 4k btc wall up at $6700 a few days ago lol
o.o
when can we have the opposite cycle?
There are a lot of people already feeling this way right now. Capitulation is close.
It’s been absolutely ripping since this entire downtrend.

It probably has the most use out of any coin/is the most used coin when it comes to using it for what it’s actually meant to do 
Man I wish people would stop throwing around the word 'shitcoin' so lightly. Binance coin does exactly what it is expected and meant to do, there's nothing shitty about it. A lot of people use BNB rather than BTC to trade into nowadays btw, which keeps its price up and thus makes it more attractive for other traders to switch to it, too.
No. People care about pumping "OhMyGosh Coinbase listing MOOOON!"
I noticed etc has weird countertrend rallies. 
27% BTC of current BFX shorts are 1x hedges. Which don't necessarily need to cover. A lot more non-hedged being added though in last few hours. If I were to setup a squeeze I'd give about 2-3K more of those so it's almost even 30K vs 30K long/short.
The shorts could be holding BTC and be 1x shorts. Or they could have BTC in cold storage and be short as a hedge against future price declines, and eventually deposit their cold storage to cover their position. 
Selling at 13k and buying at 6k seems like a good plan.
Jesus christ dude. You've said this like 15 times now. It honestly seems like you have more of an agenda then he does. 

Nobody can call the ABSOLUTE TOP, and its ridiculous to expect that. 
I get annoyed when people act like they call tops/bottoms perfectly, especially when they're no where close to correct.

I mentioned lower $13k is a great cash out point, but him coming back here and saying he got the top is super disingenuous and that annoys me to no end.

His ETH prediction was also horribly wrong:

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/ETHUSD/uKHKSz6G-ETH-Staging-for-Another-Run/

I don't go around here acting like I call bottoms/tops perfectly even though I've gotten some pretty good tops, so I get irritated when others do it

like I said, I agree with your point. But imagine I come back at $20k and post some of my old predictions and say "said this 6 months ago..." "And I'm saying today, buying here is a mistake." it's just fearmongering in the opposite direction- but people eat it up because it would be good for them 
Came at you pretty harsh, sorry about that. Just not a fan of "I made one perfect call, now listen to me, do *not* sell" kinda stuff.
Yeah, I know. :-P
"Institutional money is moving in!"
"RIP all bottom shorters"
You forgot the cringest one: 
Bull div on 4 hours
“$3k next week”
“I’m in it for the tech!”
Nope, less than $1 away though! (Kraken) I'm sure it will get hit soon though, no worries since i'm in decent profit.

Not so funny story, recently went short and set a stop a little ways above. Wicked up and hit my stop and then proceeded to dump. My stop buy was literally the local top. I wasn't too happy about that one lol
Well, I'm outta the loop on that one...
What am I missing here??? 
Oh yeah? Want to make a bet?
Yeah, for sure. Hodlers gonna hodl. But, to me, the chart looks about half way through a bear market. It seems more likely that there's at least another *full* cycle of bear before bottoming out. Fractals and such. I think the price will bottom out later in the year or earlier next year. This is not the summer of love.
From a technical standpoint it's not well justified. People just want to think that provided support so many times because the true bottom is close below. The technicals don't really show that though. It shows a lot of downward momentum that's just coming to head, I think, and bearish volume profiles. 
You have clearly not seen capitulation before
And you'll end up burnt 
IMO all the bear circlejerking is a massive buy signal. Buying at 6K vs 3-5K? Who gives a shit, DCA here and laugh when the price is 50-100K 
Opinions are a lagging indicator 
Well do it.
As much as I think you may well be right, I’d suggest that you go ahead and do it. Open a short on Bitmex with 100k. 
That may be true in a lot of cases, but i'm not pretentious like that.

If you factor your feelings out, you too can see that this is a great time to buy and market cycles happen all the time. 

Take advantage of the situation and don't be weak enough to submit to the mass hysteria and fear going on out there.
Whenever someone says "whenever someone says" what they're really saying is "I'm being hyperbolic and making generalizations about people"
Logic made Goedel feel so incomplete ...

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gödel%27s_incompleteness_theorems
I meant last summer, one year ago.  Look at June 2017 prices. But you said it better, the price was even $1k at one time. So if we ignored the heights from Oct 2017 till now, $5k would still be ATH.
obey?  no TA says something will happen 100% of the time.  it says if this happened this will happen 65% of the time, if you manage your risk correctly that 15% diff from 50% is enough to make money over the long term.

But the 35% of the times it fails, you get idiots says 'where's your ta now' 'TA is BS' etc
Ok, yeah I see that when today closes we will most likely have a divergence (unless we somehow go down down to goblin town today) but didn't see much besides that. Thanks for clarifying, wanted to make sure i'm not missing anything.
Saw this earlier... it's a pretty decent divergence so i'm very intrigued to see how it's going to play out should we make new lows soon

they will receive some in cash since the trustee that was holding them already sold 400Million, but the rest will be received as BTC and BCH.
Me too, just curious
k
>Going down 400$ is not a crash


Sure but what if we go down by $14,000? Seems a little crash-like to me.
can you tell me the bottom?
Fortunately it was just a small portion of the profits I got from riding XRP to near the top. I was pretty swept up in the alt craze at that point. At least I sold my XRP for $2.8x. I got out of alts back at the $11.7K rejection in March, but I held this one simply as a reminder, since I think I really did buy within 2% of the top lol
I have no desire to do that. I'm not an alt guy anymore, and if I *did* commit anything to alts at this point, it would not be this one.
I don't think we're looking at the same thing.

It's all relative to the current market, yes it isn't as volatile as dec-jan, but considering we've been trading in small ranges I'd say it's more volatile than what we've been trading
it's not a bull div unless it bounces 
sounds pretty meaningless to me. new lows is the trend. 
The macro trend would have to change for 6k to be the bottom.
One way you'll be able to tell is over the short-mid term the market will sell bitcoin until the price goes below $6k.
You know an audit is just an "it's good guys" from an audit firm? Remember Enron?
I zoomed out.  The cycle isn't complete, we still have further to fall.  Sorry
jews haha WTF, dunno man the alien overlords, the emperor of starwars, something more ethereal. Have you ever looked at the faces at the people walking into Bilderberg meetings? These crackers are just administrators, uncapable of doing anything on their own whim (hence the meetings where they get instructions..). What's with your rhetoric BTW?
Would go for 4.8k though instead of a stop at 5k 
Could be a she
You don't get wrecked unless you let a position move far against you.  All the shorts are in profit and they can easily close at breakeven unless there is a one minute huge green candle, which is very unlikely.

Everyone who longed in the last 6 months is currently wrecked...much more accurate statement.
we will see.
No, but it's been sustained for decades in other computer networks.
> I’m sure a lot of people have entry avg a lot lower than we are now.

When my entry was $800 and I watched it go to $150, buying all the way down, I didn't sell, thank God.  It sucked.  I was not sure of myself or my decision at the time, but I'm sure glad I "capitulated" by putting it on a paper wallet and forgetting about it for a while, not by selling.

Even if your entry was $20K, why would you sell now? Dead money.  Toss it in your safe and go live your life.  You'll be fine.  Nobody in their right mind thinks Bitcoin is going to zero, and people who actually understand the math behind it are nearly certain it will go much higher than 20K eventually.  Maybe not tomorrow, but eventually.

I will never sell for fiat unless I have a compelling need for fiat beyond paying my bills, and I assume that I'll be able to do that directly with Bitcoin within a few years... so probably never trading future money for Monopoly bank money.  Can't speak for others.
yup at that point I'd long and just assume the money's gone. would go trade other markets or something

come back in a few years to $1-3k or $20-50k :D 
Right but if we get there the market will be very, very slow most likely and I won't have a whole lot of interest in trading it over maybe stocks or something. Shorting this has been nice lately but honestly it's been boring lol
As a LTH, I'm excited for the impending breakdown (hopefully). 
[deleted]
Big difference between someone calling for 0 and myself saying sub 4K amigo.
I was about to pull the trigger on reactivating my account. Then I took a step back to think about:

-My Girlfriend,
-The Gym
-My Career
-BTC trading
-Golf Career
-Friends
-Family
-The Fresh Air Outside my Bedroom
-Food
-My eyes 
-Free time

Then realized I My life can’t be consumed by the addicting game. I’ll most likely return in 2019 when the new Wow Classic comes out. Which will be an absolute fucking blast. 
sure not problem 
Give it time baby, it's the top of the 2nd inning. 
Indicators /≠  Trend

Many indicators said we were overbought and we should have sold at anything above 10k.

Opening a short at 10k in Nov 17 would have been a terrible move, in retrospect.

Opening a short would have been trading against the trend.

Indicators are a way of trying to call the top or bottom of any particular price action. My original point to OP was that grievance at 'bear traders' was misplaced, because sensible traders are just trading the trend. 
Can you explain why you think that LN will be that big of a deal? 
*fingers crossed*?
I have good reason to be disillusioned, the run up in 2017 completely broke bitcoin. >100$ transaction fees and gigantic mempool caches lead to complete pandemonium, that really opened my eyes to the true problem: governance.

The fact that pigheaded devs and miners have to do KY jelly wrestling every time they want to make necessary changes to the code is a real design flaw. The cypherpunks who conceived of the thing obviously had a political philosophy guiding them but it isn't one that I bought into as a college student but don't anymore and it's one that makes them generally unwilling to work together and compromise. The necessity of a block size increase was obvious from three years ago and yet no one could either think ahead enough or be pragmatic enough to allow it to happen and it lead to the disaster in late 2017 and the total fucking shambles that is giving Roger Ver a cent.

I'm short 3x BCH right now so the karmic justice is tasting extra sweet I gotta say.
It's all that matters with trading yes, emotions are not a trading asset. What matters is using analysis to skew the odds in your favour one way or the other. Then risk management in case you're wrong.

Simple.

We are dropping because we were in a bubble and Crypto for the most part right now has no real world usage.

We will climb again once it has real world usage. We wait for that day 
It did, obviously.  That was huge news and it happened early in the bull market.

The bull market for all crypto's peaked while ico's and most banking ties to South Korea were blocked.  So clearly the bull run won there.
I would call that money spent on BTC infrastructure, which has no relation to the trading price. When miners spend that money, it goes to the companies that sell the computers and the utilities, not the market 
Only if you can get it listed on an exchange, and have it trade for that price.
I think they get it.
I'm not sure why. He was fairly pessimistic about crypto and thought we had further to go down
I’m not sure I understand.  You guys are estimating that later this weekend it will dip below 6k?

100K before EOY
If you can't see it recovering, sell all and try another hobby. I can see it recovering a lot. Only question is *when*.
Who says we didn't take the trophy or that we aren't living the wonderful life already with what we already cashed out? We won, yes, we now know that Tether did in fact have the money (at least loaded USD bank accounts that have been analysed by two ex supreme court judges in time and place randomised probes) and the blockchain future is brighter than ever, specially if the price adjusts further and we shake out the some of the stupidity a little more.
No, I am Mr. Permabull with magical, omniscient powers.
well it's probably because you're in bitcoin markets, not litecoin markets
I think you're looking for the altcoin thread (or 2013)
Haha jeez, look, I'm usually down to take a contrarian position on just about anything, but flat-earth is right about where I draw the (hemispheric) line lol
do you browse SRD? your name looks familiar
Here's a hint. If you don't understand how to comment on reddit, you probably don't understand the economics of nascent ICOs. VeChain is a bag, like all the other bags. Don't invest in scamcoins, invest in reddit for dummies.
Get your fat fingers out of my butthole, scumbag bot. 

Mobile users suck it!
Tested 3 times is not necessarily good. But of course we cannot know. Some big player is trying to force a bottom. If they have inside info they may keep it.
Well this being a trading sub I'd say most people here plan on watching the market and trying to make money no matter which direction it goes in (and can also lose money and "panic" in either direction too). You're poll looks more slanted toward the "buy and hold" crowd.
Bcash lmao
DAI is nice but it's mostly only on DEX the volume is not that great and speaking of my experience there's always a spread of like 10$(eth/dai) between buy and sell order. IMO right now it's great to open a cdp and laverage some eth but for day trading not so nice, you can only bet on longer time frame. 

No expert here tho, just a guy who has a cdp and played a bit last months.. 
If we go sub 6k it could happen that a cascade of stop losses and and also margin calls result into a BRD. To be sure, you need to make the stop loss a market order, and that could end very bad. 
Druck did the same thing during the Dotcom bubble, flipping his portfolio. On the other end of the competence spectrum: Bill Ackman recently made it to the 6th place of all-time biggest trading losses with his Valeant long by holding on while the company was falling apart. He also got destroyed with his Herbalife short.
> and it is less likely to just be coins shuttling around wallets

As explained in my comment thread below, this indicator gives more weight to coins that sat idle for longer periods of time.  Like 1 coin sitting 100 days = 100 on the scale once moved.  1 coin sitting 1 day = 1.  So it would not pick up on coins shuttling back and forth.  
I'm seriously surprised how many people in their 30s hang out here. Really thought btc was for lil millenials lmao 
So you're saying that the operations from the most efficient miners will become more BTC productive as the price goes down, because fewer machines will be mining.

If this was true, wouldn't we see a decrease in BTC hashrate when the price dips down to potentially unprofitable levels, around the beginning of Feb, April, and June? This we do not see: https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-hashrate.html#6m

I'm looking for a decent explanation for the $5.5-6k support we see from November until now, and this upward pressure from decreased mining sales seemed plausible. Any other suggestions?
Not that they would stop mining, but that they'd stop selling on exchanges. The key assumption here is that the largest farms are in it for the short term gain, and they've got a very tight cost/return model. In other words, this assumes that they'd rather sell at a small profit in the short term than either a) sell at a loss, as Maximalist suggests, or b) hold on the gamble that a larger profit opportunity will come around.
That's not the story this is trying to tell. This is showing you market activity. What you want to see is also interesting and relevant.
How long should I wait this storm out for? I suck at timing and emotions take over. I often end up in the wrong coin and sell the ones that seem to rebound moments before they go up >_<
You're pretty much 100% right about this. You can cash it out at Kraken but there's not much volume on that. Otherwise you have to sell it for something else and then sell that something else for your choice of fiat. So yeah, gymnastics.

Basically, if it's in tether then it going back into the market  to purchase crypto at some point.

Maybe people are hording and waiting for official means to cash it out... but i doubt it.
A lot of people don't realize this but RSI is for *ranging* markets. This is why it was basically useless in 2017 except for determining the bottom.

It's not a great indicator for a trending market. I would say since the top at $9990 there is a definitive downwards trend. RSI will likely not be a lot of help for us as we potentially establish new downwards territory.

What do you mean for favorable conditions? Just RSI? 

It's also sort of iffy, cause bitmex is extremely leveraged volume, but if you look at this chart you can see the volume aggregate with bitmex shows only a slight decline in volume as compared to the other dumps:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/0xElpun2/

Also yea, I'm pretty much completely ignoring fundamentals/real world events. 
My god. I mean seriously, its like the first question for bitmex sign up should be 'is losing $1k enough to make you poor and begging for $50?' if yes, get the F out.

I don't even have a bitmex account, dont trust myself enough.

BTW, if you do want to send money, I'll give you my address =)

2015 was before hardly anyone had heard of Bitcon and cryptocurrency.  Now most everyone has heard of it, and most don't care, or think of it negatively.  Also, more gov'ts have either banned it or severely regulated it into near uselessness in many cases.

It will probably grow very slowly once the market finds a firm bottom, but that will likely not be for quite awhile.

Unfortunately, Bitfinex is not going to be allowed to create billions of tethers for another manipulated pump to $20K.   The last ATH was mostly bullsh*t.
>No problem. Tried something like your position but was already stopped. 

I believe the bottom of this drop was ~1.5% below my entry. Where was your stop? 
Its perfect! Cheers
Well what I was suggesting is to set up a VPN on your home network so you can remote in to your home network from another country. Of course, you could just use one of the big VPN providers out there depending on what you’re looking for. If you want anonymity you’re much better off using a large provider, if you just want to appear to be using the internet from home use your home network. 
True.  I only have a couple hundred bucks in though.
Meh, I'm a sucker for the Riviera Maya area.  We actually did look at Punta Cana, but that place can be kinda sketchy too.  Just gotta try to be aware of your surroundings and not get too wasted and acting like a dipshit off-resort. 

Will be pounding the Anejo though, and trying to think less about crypto for a while.  Should be a good break.
Oh yea Dominic Republic is the bastion of safety /s
Damn you got me figured - you're exactly right.  I'm a big wyckoff advocate.
So in other words, the minority of professional traders in a market who take from the majority.
They can bully the market in the short term. But long term, it's a losing game for big money. The market goes where the market wants to go. One man/entity can't change a cycle. It's extremely risky from a risk management perspective to be trying to manipulate a low liquidity market.
It's gonna be ok, just hoped for a longer stability period in BTC so I could focus on other things, but it's something I've been watching for some time now and it's starting to play as I expected. Not saying we will definitely see sub 5k, but I can't let this ride on it's own and hope for the best.

There's a big engagement difference between trading high lev this chop and just protecting value of your stack.
the name makes sense now!! 
I thought they weren't rocks but rather "minerals".

Jesus Christ, Marie!
I hope you realise institutional money literally cannot enter this space until there is regulation in place for them to do so. This is spat out so often by people because their hopes are counting on some hedge fund with billions of dollars to just come in and market buy a shit ton of bitcoin, sorry to burst your bubble but the infrastructure and regulation needs to happen first before they can do this, and it’s being worked on but not happening any time soon.
I'm a pokemon that decided to grow up and get a real job, onyx is doing heroine now because he couldn't stop that lifestyle

Nope I keep track of it myself...been looking to write a bot for it lately. I wish there was a way, not sure why there isn't. I should do it later today :)


Yea, that's true, in general open interest should rise on a drop if open interest is technically staying flat, although I'm not sure how much of this we can account for it. I'm sure there's some complicated math formula to tell us what it should be as we decline. 

But regardless the open interest was at 70k last time we were *here*. (or around $6.3-6.4k) So open interest has gone up significantly by effectively going sideways
Compelling counter-argument 
Blockchain could be more efficient. Most say otherwise, but a blockchain doesn't have to be public, for someone to use it effectively and efficiently.
You have signed transactions by the parties involved for every single transaction.

Compared to a normal database, it will hold up a lot better when the parties involved start to deny things and start suing,
there are more xrp in circulation than Zimbabwean dollars
They'll demonstrate the typical herd behaviour that causes bubbles and crashes. Virtually no one buys anywhere near the bottom cos it's 'dedded' despite their big swinging dick words on the way down. 

100,000x more people buy at the tippy top because 'this time it's different'. 
Good good. 
Pulled. What are you talking about? Edit: I was watching the order book the moment it was pulled. 
Ok actually in this specific case I understand. Honestly the last two times I was thinking a bit like this (use the wall). And it worked but I also used other factors to get the signal. This time it screamed wrong. Nevertheless you should have wider stops :)
I dont understand you mate, bias at bitcoin, offucking course! you rather want bank turd fiat money in the future or what? WTF is wrong with your thinking
You are right. I agree with what you say. But another mistake people make is that they just can't imagine extreme possibilities. The same way people weren't able to consider the possibility of 20k last year, a lot of people flat out refuse to believe 3k is even possible. 
Fucking december scrub, nobody cares what people like you thought bitcoin would do
No you won't. If you see 3800 it will become 3000 and if you see 3000 it will become 2

You're going to keep thinking like this and the price is going to turn around before you think it will. Most likely you're going to say to yourself oh that's false rally. Then when the price breaks out over 11 7 you're going to start to feel some fomo. Welcome to being one of the masses
Not if you ask them.
leaving a company after a criminal probe and paper saying your company is counterfeiting money backed by some data... fishy fishy!
Yes.

Good bot.
I havent been in this space very long (trading atleast) but if there is something I have learned in the 1,5/2yrs it is that if something «should» happen it usually dont.

We have tested the 6k range for long without breaking it. People seem to be too bearish imo. I think we wont go down. Honestly I think we could shoot up sooner rather than later... That way the market would fuck more people over than going down to 5/3k. Shorts are high, hashrate at ath and I generally see much frustration... my bet is we dont break it (at least not by much). 
we've gone $6k-12k in the span of just a month, it's not terribly crazy to think we could see $3xxx again. 

people are very used to this range 

but really lots is possible at this point 
This is my view, It could be wrong. 
Way of the road bubs
Thanks again - before planning my trades I spend most of my time watching and taking in signals from quality contributors - you're one of them.
highly possible, just confused by the summer comment lol
Considering it revolves around something that's created an entirely new asset class, it's not surprising. It is actually a bit reassuring; while the events were, ahem, unfortunate to say the least, they're breaking enough eggs to bring about changes.
I’ll have to try those then. If I can find something even BETTER than Hershey’s then that would be awesome.
You were focused on huge buy walls at 6.7, you didn't see a lot of sell walls popping out of nowhere just to be bought up by buyers who had their back covered by huge buy wall.
There's one at 900 units at 6000 now. But that's not much, relatively, vs 3-4k at 6700.
Floggings will continue until morale improves.
You're right, and I do genuinely like BNB coin, I'm always topping it off for trading.

Thought I was being funny.
Didn't it's price drop when it was listed?
I don't really care about him suggesting people buy. I care about him acting like he called the top. It's just a form of fearmongering if he's not dead accurate on most of his calls 

With the amount of upvotes he has it seems lots of people are emotional and hoping for a bounce for any reason
yea my agenda is letting people know he's actually quite bad at picking the bottom/top?

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/ETHUSD/uKHKSz6G-ETH-Staging-for-Another-Run/

Buy here all you want, shit's oversold af and there'll be a huge bounce eventually. I just get annoyed with fearmongering "I'm telling you guys, it's CRAZY to sell here!"

it's just...kinda scummy to me. He's playing people's emotions.

If he were calling the top and had formerly very inaccurate predictions I'd call him out too. But I understand this sub is emotional today and thinks I have an agenda. There's a guy in here talking about fighting for bitcoin like it's an actual physical war, so I understand people might not be seeing things clearly
How could I forget that..

Nah, the cringiest would be, "ill buy some around 3k next week"
Yea I don't use stops in this market anymore unless it's like ridiculously high just to prevent me from going broke.

The same thing that I'm missing, I think. Did this guy do something specific to people?
You guys can send me your bitcoins and I will act as escrow and disperse to the winner.
If you don't agree you can simply short.

You can bet live on the market if you didn't know.
Price went down from 10k to 6k with the biggest 1d green candle of around $500 and even less than that on 3d (not counting the wicks) in the last 40 days or so. You gotta imagine there's either a significant bounce somewhere near, or this is a complete collapse of Bitcoin with a one way ticket to Goblintown. I guess most bulls don't think it's the latter, so...
Well "We're close" means ~5k in this context and that's why I voted for it. I don't think that's unreasonable though I do think we can go to 4.8k as well.
Ya I mean you know I agree already lol. Unfortunately I think if we do go down, by the time most people are convinced it could go a lot lower, it'll bounce really hard back above $6k or something
Not as burnt as people bag holding since 8k lul.
Anyone who knows anything about math gives a shit. That's 15%-50% more money.
^ dca is always good advice, imo
The 30k underwater longs give a shit. Because they are liquidated at those prices. The holders who actually bought like 1 year ago at 3-4k   will start thinking, what if it goes to 2k or 1k? They will start to get nervous and sell. If you are on the sidelines sitting in cash, then yeah, like you said, it's just DCA and buy more as it goes lower. But there are many overinvested who will be devastated by 3-5k
I am 2,750,000 short from 6900, give me a minute screenshot incoming

Exactly this, emotional beings judge based on the price, logical beings judge based on the technology. Right now the technology is progressing well, nothing has changed aside from improvements via lightning. Logically all is well.

Just your typical market cycle of over enthusiasm. 
>This is something that everyone likes to ignore. It's like they forgot that so many people are still heavily green and not quite feeling the impact of this drop... yet.
No I can't. Same goes for the top.
Again, if you refer back to my chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/awsEY0P1/

And if you look at Bitfinex, you will see buying volume in the 6800$ to 6100$ that was not there in the 7800$ to 7000$.

I'm not comparing the total volume from the start of the bear flag to the total volume of the end of the bear flag.
Common mistake of people new to TA (self included) is trading a hypothetical signal before the signal fully manifests/develops. Call it the "imminent right shoulder" syndrome

If you believe it'll go down from here and that it won't get back 20K, it makes sense to sell now.  This feels a bit like the sunk cost fallacy to me.  If you don't need the money any time soon and are willing to wait, then you'll likely be fine in the long run.  But even so, if you expected a 50% haircut, why would you not want to have double the BTC in the end?

I think you're taking more risk than you believe you are. It can't go to 0, and it must go above 20K = very large assumptions.  You aren't right or wrong, and only time will tell.  But you're taking some big risk here unless you're putting disposable income into BTC.
As much as I see you downvoted this is one of the few posts I’ve seen from you over the past months that isn’t wildly bullish for no other reason than it has to go up
It depends on how it gets down there.  If it drops to $2500 tomorrow, it sure won't be very slow, with low volatility.

Yes, a raging bull market does seem more exciting somehow.  It's just a bummer to see Bitcoin and cryptocurrency bleeding out, day by day.
I should have added a /s but I thought it was obvious. The “bear” narrative is so boring. 
Yeah, I can't get myself to go back. I did it a few times with increasing disappointment every time. 

I'll keep 2019 in mind but I don't think it's possible to combine it at all with an actual job. I like to sleep nowadays too, in contrast to my school/uni years. 
Is there any way to play wow without getting addicted?

Cause I get super addicted to mmorpgs/rpgs and I've always wanted to play wow.

dad never let me when I was in high school ... probably a really good thing 
It's simple... That shit works.

Bitcoin was sold to merchants around the world as a better payments platform up until it got popular/slow/expensive in 2017, and even before then merchants and users realized that there was a 10-30 minutes confirmation period on transactions that made the whole system sub-par compared to visa or paypal.

Lightning doesn't have that problem. It's absolutely instant and has already scaled further than Visa's network. It's super fast and as soon as the watchtowers are in place the next wave of merchants will actually PREFER using bitcoin to any other network out there for its lower fees.

> The fact that pigheaded devs and miners have to do KY jelly wrestling every time they want to make necessary changes to the code is a real design flaw.

No, this is not a bug it's a feature. It's strong immutability is one of the most important aspects of BTC.
I don't believe I was extolling emotions, I don't act on emotions either, they aren't a problem for me when I trade. The issue with what you are saying is that analysis tells a million different stories depending on how you measure time. Every person here has a different timeframe for their trade, and more importantly every analysis is still nothing more than odds (respective to the analyzer's timeframe).

Bitcoin already has world use, it has for a long time now, and with new capabilities. Clearly in my last post I'm referring to the importance of fundamentals over a longer time frame, those fundamentals are very much in effect as they always have been in the past near-decade.
But if you're talking about money that has been poured into the market, that's exactly what it is. Because it is what the coinbase BTC is traded for. Just like with an IPO, where there's an initial price for a share. Only with Bitcoin,  each block is a mini IPO each and every time.

Doesn't mean that money is still in the market now, of course.
So total market cap is an overinflated and useless way to look market growth? Is that what we're saying here?
I’m actually not sure...
Yes. 
I am, yes, could be sooner or later
Please, enlighten me.

>  You're poll looks more slanted toward the "buy and hold" crowd.

Ok, fair enough. Point taken. 

Still don't think high-leveraged margin traders have the power to take this to the ground (they lose/win every day, so it's no big deal for them). 

I still think the breaking point will be when all 'ordinary people' who invested their savings money give bitcoin the finger and just want to get out. I have trouble seeing this happen (since everything just feels so slow/boring -- as if nobody really seems to care that much we are on the edge of breaking new 2018 lows). This might mean most of them already sold what they wanted, or most of them have no plan yet, and trouble is still ahead (how will people react if we go 4k or 3k? will people who bought >10k still have faith?).
This could absolutely escalate very very quickly. Not for sure, but it really could. May have to get out the knife catching gloves. 
ah the guy in the movie that was released recently? He did not learn market can stay irrational longer than he can stay solvent etc ? :)
Oh yes totally.  

I didn't mean back and forth.  By shuttling around wallets I meant consolidation between a users' own wallets or sending to other people.  But the price correlation is convincing that they could have landed on exchange.
Haha I just barely made it into the majority. Honestly most 30 year olds I work with are basically like people in their late 20s, just a little chubbier!
Yes, I am saying that.  No, you wouldn't see that from the charts because mining hadn't reached the saturation point yet.  Hashrate can only dip when price falls significantly after the saturation point is reached.  And even then it lags behind- it takes multiple months to deploy large mining farms, and even longer to build them- many builds started late last year aren't fully online yet.  And even that isn't visible in the charts if more efficient chips come on the market during the price changes.

Imo the support level is psychological.  We were stuck here before the 2x drama too on the way up.  Also for comparison look at 2014 on the way down- we got stuck at 650-ish and then again at 425-450 ish.  Both of those fooled me, I was naive enough to think the bear market was done.
No because btc price is still extremely high. 
If you are mining at a loss, why wouldn't you shut off mining?

If you are betting that bitcoin would recover, spend the money on buying coins instead.
IMO, you probably shouldn't be in alts until that market has shaken out and become somewhat rational again. You're always at risk of selling the bottom in these conditions, though. Sounds like a rough place.

It's just money. Try to find a way to relax about it before you make any decisions.

Getting into fiat is like taking out an insurance policy right now. You just don't know what the cost of that insurance policy is going to be in advance.

Alts make up less than 5% of my crypto portfolio. I'm pretty happy with that right now.
There was a substantial ninja edit.

Oh my, its at .018. I really like Monero. Hopefully it'll have its day where it just goes up to 0.1+ BTC/XMR. Currently not holding any, buts its price in BTC is getting to be on the more attractive side.
It was dropping because of fluffy departing.
Kinda.

I have 2  a 5x short 100% of stack from $6700’s with trading stack 

Yesterday I sold 25% if all my alt stacks into BTC the. tether so I’m technically 1x short from $6700 too with my non trading stack.

Just sold another 10% before into BTC then into Tether at $6180 so another 1x short technically

Not true. That same line of thought was around in 2015. I even considered it that way. When I talked or asked anyone at that time and their response: "didn't that CEO like loose it all, it failed didn't it?" 
Where has cryptos been regulated into 'near uselessness?' What countries have banned cryptos?
>Unfortunately, Bitfinex is not going to be allowed to create billions of tethers for another manipulated pump to $20K. The last ATH was mostly bullsh*t.

When the supply halves, we won't need fake dollar pegged tokens to sustain a rally.
good luck to everyone that havn't stuffed their fiat in the matrasses cause the banks will eat every saver penny in this next upcomming crisis. Deutsche, Monte di Paschi will kick it off and through derivatives it will spread to every other bank. The next ATH will be 250K and you will not have a chance of buying into it when fiat accounts are voided over night
I was trading on ETH because it has greater volatility but i chart BTC.
My stops were 2% (very tight) and got hit. If i had them at 3% i would still have it open but its life :)

Greater volatility means greater gains or greater losses, so i take extra care with my stop losses. Got lucky last 2 trades when i had no stops and went 5-8% under before getting back to profits and with 5X leverage that is too much for me.

Got it. makes sense.
of course and you are asking for a friend too. pls stop doxing yourself.

And of course is no direct API call for that. After a short research best strategy is to parse https://www.bitmex.com/app/contract/XBTUSD and extract Open Interest from there, since one contract is 1 USD.
You shouldn't need an argument to know that every shit-ICO out there isn't worth a dime. These ICO's don't have working economic models (and can't sustain rent-seeking models). They're essentially just **massively overvalued** unregulated securities.

The point of blockchain is that it removes trust, if I have to trust the bank in being honest when they validate transactions what's the point of using blockchain in the first place?
This goes for the internet vs intranets as well, intranets can be useful too.
Trading volume at the bottom tends to be huge; *someone* is buying a lot at the bottom. 
No because I just told you they didn't buy at 11k because they thought the end is near.
https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=KRAKEN:XBTEUR 

check the volume in the 1min chart, it was eaten.
The only reason i did it was with the belief it would hold. I still don't know if this is a good place for a long so in that case i wanted out fast in case it failed. 
Going to zero is possible. That's something you have to put in the back of your mind if you get into crypto.

3K is starting to get to be dangerous. You're going to have a lot of hash power going offline and that means a lot of use miners being liquidated which of course means lots of 51% attacks because people will buy those miners for a few dollars each and they will launch attacks

This is the kind of stuff that can set things back a long time. Many many years. There is the risk of it not recovering.

Right now people are selling just to do so. There is no legitimate reason. There is no legitimate Fud. That's personally why I think the move is about exhausted. You can even see it on the charts because the moves down keep getting to be less and less extreme

Panic selling doesn't look like what we have had lately. Panic selling doesn't bounce off the EMA . Panic selling doesn't begin when the RSI heats up. This is Traders racing each other to the door. When that move is finally over then what? Because there are a lot of smart people who are buying up what you guys are dumping

I like all the 2014 posts you can look up on here. It's amazing how many people were predicting 20 to $50
THATS NOT WHAT THE OTHER LAWYER SAID!!! - Idiocracy
You and the paper can speculate on whatever you want with regard to Bitfinex and Tether but there is no smoking gun, here or elsewhere.

I don't understand your motivation for all this. Why do you want so badly for Tether to be insolvent?
Where have you been when we were at 7-7.8k range?

It was all exactly the same.

But the descending wedge I just talked about is a bullish pattern. I was trying to say that if the formation is valid we may bounce from 5k to go up and break out of that wedge. That would mean new bull run.
We surely could, I am just unsure how quick or slow would it be if it ever happens. We spend some time in 8ks, then in 7ks, now in 6ks, but yeah if it gets sub 6k, I think things will be different in terms of timings. 
Whilst we went up in a parabolic fashion, the pattern of downward movement hasn't been a classical pattern of taking the elevator down. 
Think about it like this, people enjoy the summer and warmer weather and want to be outside, they don't want to sit at the computer checking charts, feeling stress, the charts look like shit, so why buy? Buy when it's going up, sell when it's going down. Traders are smart and all, but most people who trade lose money right? It means most people need to be washed out. You have people who are still trading who got in in the past year or two who have made a lot of money and who haven't given it all back...they must give it ALL back. Anyone buying here should be looking to flip it quick or want to lose money. Why would you buy here? Why now? Are we just retesting the same low again? Nope. We're going lower, good news does nothing for bitcoin right now, it has no power. The fomo is created by FOMO. Is anyone feeling fomo right now? Is John Q Public thinking about bitcoin or are they focused on what jacket Melania is wearing and whatever else is in the news. Bitcoin had a hype cycle in 2017 and now needs to enter it's slumber.
well ya I did  :D they've been doing this for weeks now 
It wasn't listed yet. "Coming soon on Coinbase," that's all there is to it. Actual tech stuff nobody cares about in a market like this.

Pfft I don't care about that, I wanted to make a bet that you wouldn't have to make any bet and here you are not betting. So I guess that settles that

With the rapidity of movements you gotta take a gamble on a signal sometimes.  Sure, you can get burned that way.  But you can be wrong waiting for the signal to complete too.
Then why call it an "it's good guys" as if that distinguishes it from an audit?
Exactly. Followthrough is key. Rising volume on subsequent dumps would make me think sell momentum was picking up; dropping volume makes me think it's nearing its end.

Don't think we're gonna see a BGD like April, but a slow climb to the high 7ks is what I'm looking for.
Let's find out!

!RemindMe 4 Months "Further to fall?  At 6.05k now"
Well in this case, the appreciation should be faster-than-exponential because quantity of users doesn't matter as much as quality of users. Bitcoin as store of value is still the name of the game.
First of all, thank you for being civil.  I understand why you see it the way you do. I see it differently.

I started by putting disposable income into BTC, and that's mainly what I do now, although selling GE and buying GBTC last spring turned out pretty well.  That was probably the only time I put actual retirement/investment/big-boy money into Bitcoin.

The thing is, all the chump change I threw into Bitcoin (when everybody was laughing at me) became substantial over the years.  Now I understand the technology and the market better than I did, and I see it as far less risky than money in a bank account.

Adoption is always way behind awareness.  Once upon a time, people laughed at you if you had a computer, but I was one of those guys who didn't care. I saw its utility before other people.  Same with the Internet, cell phones -- most people don't see the implications or inevitability of new technologies for several years after awareness of them hits ~100 percent. I don't care if most people don't see it yet, and I don't care if these idiots keep selling Bitcoin at a loss to make themselves feel better that their grandpa money is going the way of the dinosaur in the next few years. Not my problem.

And sorry to say it, but it will go DEFINITELY go WAY higher than 20K, and it will not go to zero in my lifetime.  Because the market is so unpredictable in the short term, the best way to double your BTC is to buy at regular intervals. I've sold hoping to buy back at a lower price and ended up kicking myself for months, then buying back at double.  It will double in a short period of time at some point, probably this year.  It's math.  Supply does not grow.  Demand does.  All the manipulative dumping by people with far more money than brains won't change that.
Why did people sell in ‘08?
One of my best buddies who’s been playing for 10+ years says wow is trash right now. 

 If you’re going to play, play the new classic in 2019. They are bringing back ALL the features of the original WoW + more and that’s when WOW was an absolute blast to play. Everything wasn’t “ Handed “ to you like they do now.  

Only issue with it is it takes hours in the game to get anything done. Want to raid? You have to dedicate like 4-10 hours a night to defeat any bosses especially with new content. 

Want to push for ratings in arena? Need to spend hours pushing for your 2200+ ranking. 

The game is BEYOND fun. Major part of my teen years and I’ll never regret not playing.  
You're still assuming people will spend BTC over using something they have - credit cards. Why spend BTC when one can spend dollars so easily? There's still no incentive for the common man to use BTC other than speculation and buying alts during a bull market. 

Not to mention spending BTC is a taxable event. Who wants to deal with that headache for day to day transactions?
\> It's simple... that shit \*will\* work \*hopefully\*...

FTFY. But in all seriousness, it's an unproven quantity and if the only incentive needed was lower transaction fees then there would be other competitors to Visa/MC. What you need to have is customers, that's what attracts merchants. Furthermore, the fact that LN can theoretically outscale Visa is meaningless, Visa doesn't have a transaction backlog and can add capacity as their growth demands.

So you're back to the problem of having to convince normies to get into crypto, and without a good carrot to dangle in front of them I honestly don't see it happening. Most normal people don't hate le ebil banksters, don't want to think about what money is, and definitely don't want to wade into the problem of buying crypto through some exchange you need to jump through KYC hoops for.
I agree in part but look yes you could look at the monthly and say we are looking good. In the case of this year in isolation then all time frames point down.

There is little to no TA offering optimism on any time frame under 1 month from November 2017 to now.

So that's enough for me.

In terms of real world use? Bitcoin currently has a very limited real word usage profile. Sure you can trade it, you can hold it, you can invest it. You can barely buy with it and that's the issue the whole crypto faces.

We won't be seeing a big bull run again until there is a fundamental shift in use case for the average Joe out there. 
Pretty much. You get a more realistic idea of the true magnitude of a coin by looking at daily trade volumes but that's still far from precise and who knows how much of it is meaningless fizz generated by bots?

There's no real way of ascertaining anything. Bitcoin's price and market cap is set by a fraction of 1% of all of its supply being bought or sold. 
Wish I could upvote you more.  Market cap is useless for anything.  Even comparing different coins using market cap is meaningless.

You can't even use market cap as a measure of an "upper limit" of valuation.  If the world goes the way us cryptonauts want the market cap of this market is going to be ridiculously high.
Already sold? Cashing out some percentage isn't the same as already sold. Most of us did take a good chunk of the table when the craze started but still have solid long-term positions.

His other ventures also depend on Monero. Not sure why the market values Monero so low.

I will not say BTC will never be at $20K again.  If the dollar collapses, then BTC can be worth $25K and you can sell that BTC and use the $25K to buy a loaf of bread.  Congratulations.
Cool.  Will keep that in mind for the next time.

On a different note, your outlook is unhealthy for your trading because you've allowed your mind to justify losing trades with "those market makers/whales ruined my trade"; instead of accepting each losing trade as a personal mistake, and seeking to learn where you went wrong.
Didn’t say they would? What
Yea I was just gonna go with something simple like parsing it. 
I’m not looking to argue, bro. I get that you don’t like alt coins. I’m sure you’re right and every single alt coin will end up at $0. None of the massive amounts of partnerships, money, time will amount to anything. Bitcoin is is the sole coin, praise be 
Your trust wouldn't come in to play for a company using a private blockchain, internally. They could use it as a ledger to track transactions, to exchange data, or a number of other things. Using a blockchain could be more efficient, and reduce error. As /r/Hotsoccerman pointed out with internet versus intranets. 
Even in a system where a single entity is the only one that can mine, it is still straightforward to verify that they did it correctly.

"Trust, but verify" works better than "Trust".
Look, to see if it was eaten you need to see the trades (you can use the API). I saw the wall get pulled and I can reassure you it was not eaten.
Anyway whoever is putting these walls (i've seen a similar one in XBTUSD in the past) is accumulating serious risk. In general supporting bitcoin is an exposure that can backfire pretty bad. And the result can be cutting losses, which means some big big red.
I also see a lot of comments that “this time it’s different”. Reading assumptions like Coinbase now allowing institutional investors will probably push the price up. I actually don’t think they will simply put in their money and wait for it to rise.

No. Those who play with heavy sums of money, want to make more money in the short and long term. I think they will try and push it down, shorting the hell out of it. Then when everyone panic sold below 2-3k, they accumulate and then push the price back up. This all in a 1-2 year period.

Of course I could be very very wrong but if I had enough capital to play with, I think this would be a plan to get maximum profits.
Love that movie/future documentary
> Why do you want so badly for Tether to be insolvent?

they already are. they admitted they cannot conduct an audit as promised and required by their own founding documents and website.

if you cannot complete an audit, the DOJ is investigating, the university of texas confirms that they are likely counterfeiting... and now the chief strategy officer of bitfinex suddenly quits?

of course they will deny committing fraud! duh!

why do you care so much about bitfinex and tether? they are centralized entities that damage bitcoin.

they are not bitcoin.

they will collapse and fail, burning to the ground.

bitcoin network wont.

so what are u worried about?
generally a new low is more of an elevator down move and then sideways/bouncey for weeks/months. so if we do go below $6k I sort of expect it to be relatively quick 
I don't think John Q public cares about bitcoin at all right now, regardless of the temperature outdoors.

I still think it's ludicrous to think that the season/weather/temperature in one particular part of the world has any effect on the price of bitcoin. 

Just as valid to say the current dump is because Venus is in the third house of the sun, or because Satoshi was most likely an Aries and they're luck isn't in today.
But not so massive like at 6.7. And usually I saw a lot of shorts build up on that moves, now it was just sells.

The only thing that actually make me think this won't go sub 5k for long is that a lot of people will probably FOMO in there. If this is really shakeout phase to accumulate lower then 'they' know that price can't drop too much.

But... On the other hand 'they' may be just exiting the market...

Yes I do agree but this is a level of nuance that comes from experience, especially experience with risk management
That's why he put it in quotes.  Do you read at a 3rd grade level?

I think I see where you're coming from, but be aware that you're expecting this to do something totally new and totally different than anything else has done.  Faster than exponential growth, especially fueled by speculation has never lasted.
Excellent move on your part last year!  I see that you bought in early - you got some at $800 - what's your average cost basis?  For now I'll assume that it's very low compared to the current price.  You have owned Bitcoin during a tremendous rally and were rewarded for doing so.  I believe that you're seeing this as less risky than money in a bank account due to selection bias.  For the time that you've held Bitcoin, it has performed at least an order of magnitude better than a savings account.  Although if you held from $800 to $150, I could be wrong. How did you feel about the safety of the investment during that time?

All of those technologies started small and grew. And grew. And here we are today! It's possible for adoption of a technology to reach 100%, there's no doubt about it.  There is however no guarantee that the adoption of anything will reach 100%. Bitcoin is something special and new, but it's not preordained to reach any lofty goals - replacing precious metals, fiat currency, etc.  I see many arguments that Bitcoin does the job of those things better than what we currently use, but even if that's true, it doesn't guarantee the trajectory of adoption.  There are many other factors that could derail it.

The >$20K prediction is speculative, and nothing will *definitely* happen.  See above - so many things could cause Bitcoin to go sour.  I don't know what they are or if they'll happen or when.  They are just 'risks', like any other asses has.  Same with the "it won't go to 0". You can make those arguments, but I disagree with the level of certainty that you have.  From my point of view, you're a bolder and braver investor than I am.

I agree about the cost averaging, that's a great strategy for something that you will hold for the long haul.  But I don't agree that doubling in the near future is inevitable (why do you believe that it is?).  I certainly don't agree that 'Limited supply' always leads to higher and higher prices - that's only true if the limited supply coincides with continuously increasing demand.  You say that demand grows, but it can also fall.  And if it does, the price will come down.

Thanks, I appreciate the conversation as well.  We probably won't agree on all points, but I think there's plenty of middle ground here.

Edits are for typos. I make too many late at night =/
GE just got de-listed from the DOW.   Good call.  Civility should be expected, no thanks necessary.  Bitcoin will go higher than 20k.  A 3x SPY ETF could return 3x with far less risk.
BTC used to be a uniquely unregulated asset.  Now it's heavily regulated for legal/tax reasons, and heavily unregulated for fraud/scam/hack potential.  Worst of both worlds.



Are you talking about stocks or something else?
Do you mean you will never regret playing?
Damn :( I would totally get addicted.

I loved d2/d3 and spent 100s of hours on them. :/ Would probably be worse with WoW. Should stay away  lol it sounds so fun :'(
As a hodler, I'm totally with you on the stance that we tend to spend our least-wanted currency and hoard the most valuable currency. That's how I've been doing it for years since I spent my initial stash of coins stupidly trying to jumpstart the btc economy in 2013. 

However, this is really a 1st-world-only problem. Like Andreas constantly points out, the vast majority of the world has problems with their money, often making regular commerce impossible. Debanking is rampant in all of the smaller countries, especially in the caribbean. Hyperinflation is happening in 4 different countries today. There's a ton of places where bitcoin could catch on simply out of lack of alternatives.

Hyperbitcoinization theory says that a virtuous cycle will be started if just one of those places does catch on, which drives the price up making btc more attractive around the world, weakening existing currencies at the same time, making it more likely for the next country to catch on, driving the price up more, etc.

As for being a taxable event, tell that to the actual majority of the world which doesn't pay taxes because it keeps all their money out of banks and under their mattress.
I just pointed out that the only incentive needed was *not* just lower tx fees. That's if all else is equal, and LN has to solve the receiving problem first, which is what the Watchtowers are for.

In bitcoin we have a loooooooooooong history (going back to the early 1980's, actually) of the world underestimating what a group of focused developers can accomplish. So far, they have a 100% success rate of coming up with new, innovative, and most importantly, working solutions to problems the world doesn't even know it needs. LN has dozens of our best devs working around the clock on it and will be no different.

As for the normies, they had two problems with Bitcoin that don't really exist anymore once the watchtowers are ready.  1) they'd never heard of bitcoin and the news didn't talk about it often back then. & 2) those merchants that were up to try it out saw the 10-minute confirmations and said no thanks.

The LN rollout is basically happening on a different planet than the first one did.
You're heavily undermining the way it is able to do these things, the mechanism making it possible without a business being in control of the very issuance and permissions of your money. 

You say, we can trade it, how is that? Well, you can trade it by offering YOUR sound money to an exchange (assuming you already have Bitcoin in a wallet, going by design), an exchange is a service, so you can use Bitcoin, the money that only you control, to fund a service you trust and then do something. So you just left out every service conceivable. You don't mention online casinos? There's a lot of profit in that. I'm not going to list all of the possibilities. My point is the functionality is there to do just about anything that a true economy could do, that is both incredible and valuable, again given the circumstances of how it is done, without reliance of a government to issue, or a bank to handle, nor the physical movement of fiat cash/precious metal.

Where are cross country remittences mentioned? God damn is there a use for that, and it's being used for that very purpose on a daily basis, you think it is not?

As far as TA goes, my view is the price is far too low to be bearish, I don't care what patterns have been playing out, my strategy is to be opening new buy positions and otherwise doing nothing (long term DCA). Very simple, still trading, and still great odds of success, because I am speaking of such long time frames.
Yes you sold when you cashed out. I wasn't talking about you.
Yeah it’s probably from here. I’ve talked to you a couple of times in the past few months. I appreciate your input and that you tend to have an unbiased perspective. 
>My wife and friend are trying a vegan 30 day challenge. Longing THE FUCK out if soybean futures. See you on the moon in my moon lambo, no-soybeaner. 

Obviously a shill. Nobody who has tried the vegan 30 day challenge could possibly want to long soybean futures. I was thinking about shorting after my experience. Looking at the price charts now, that would have been an excellent trade. 
Hahahahaha no soybeaner. Yeah. that's me. 
Monero is my favorite cryptocurrency.  Fungibility is a very important property of money, and this is one aspect where bitcoin is lacking.  The only coins I hold in any significant quantity are BTC, XMR, LTC, and DCR - what are in my mind the more decentralized cryptos.
Yeah, I should have used different wording.
Lol I went about 6 hours yesterday without doing anything crypto related. No checking TradingView, no checking my portfolio, no browsing crypto subreddits. It was pretty nice, strangely enough. So I think I'm in the same boat as you. I'm back today though, for obvious reasons.
When you barely see activity on here, that's when you know it's the bottom. As long as we have ppl here calling for a bull reversal, it won't happen 
he hasn't been that active recently actually. 

And hey :( I'm super active on reddit and I'm cool irl 😤
He’s a really cool guy. Posting on reddit says absolutely nothing about someone personality. 
No Ma’am.

I’m from Jersey never been to maple syrup land 
I see making stuff up to protect ridiculous arguments is still a thing. Cool.
haha, in your dreams, bud
Cheeky breeky!
That's certainly an opinion.  I disagree, at a macro level.  These "cycles" tend to last multiple years from one end to the other.  The "bottom" and the "top" are 100% determined by the big boys.  Think the level above whales, the guys with no interest in playing chop.  I could go on, but if you're interested in expanding your view to consider another, try googling "Wyckoff market cycle" for the 101.

Now then, with that in mind, if I make a bad trade then yes it's 100% my fault.  But to think there is no intentional direction to the market on a larger level is foolish. 
It was more of an addition to your reply, then a direct reply to you, sorry for the confusion.
What language are you writting this in? C3js is a nice charting ~~library~~ engine, and it's easy to use. Parsing itself is easy, e.g.
 
    curl -s https://www.bitmex.com/app/contract/XBTUSD | egrep -o "Open Interest(.){33}([0-9,])+" | egrep -o "[0-9,]{10,}"
I didn't say they would end up at zero. I said that most are massively overvalued. Some don't even have working models. There are certainly legitimate projects, but anything out of the top 10 is probably not worth seriously developed and/or doesn't have a working product. Even #2 ETH does *not* have a long term sustainable economic model for a valuation beyond its value to process transactions. When it comes to freely forkable, open source protocols, there is not ability to seek rent. The one exception to this is a hard money PoW coin, like Bitcoin, which has store of value properties. So-called utility tokens and less durable (lower hash rate) PoW coins do not retain the same store of value characteristic and therefore cannot sustain a rent-seeking model beyond the "friction" contained within the system itself (onboarding/offboarding costs).

[This](https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/john-pfeffer/An+Investor%27s+Take+on+Cryptoassets+v6.pdf) is an economic framework that I think is well argued in favor of what I outlined above. If you follow this line of thought, it will make sense to you. The cost to use these utility tokens (whatever VeChain claims to be) will be driven down by competition between competing chains as well as centralized systems. These coins are ultimately not business ventures, they're (mostly) open source libraries. This cannot lead to sustainable high value utility coins. Any economic rent will be arbitraged by other systems.

The only reason these coins have value now is because the whole space is a speculative hot bed, very similar to dot com bubble. It won't last, I assure you. 10 years down the road, most of these things won't exist. Just like so many alts before. Furthermore, Bitcoin upgrades, layers and expansions will be the framework for things like smart contracts (MAST) or micropayments (LN). The future is a highly secure PoW coin and a handful of other, low value crypto projects. Everything that's built to be secure will use Bitcoin PoW as its back-end (just like LN does). 

Believe what you want though, I'm not here to argue with would-be VeChain shills. 
Thanks for the shout out, bud. If you had to choose though, and you could go back in time, would you invest in the internet companies or the intranet companies?

edit: This is a hindsight 20/20 loaded question, but I think you get my point ;)
> they already are. they admitted they cannot conduct an audit as promised and required by their own founding documents and website.

That's not the same thing as bding insolvent, you dope.

>so what are u worried about?

Nothing, I don't care either way. I just don't understand why you dream up this fantasy world when the facts don't point to the same thing. 
As ludicrous as it may be, its true, atleast from my experience. Some of these cycles are also a result of randomness (so called perfect timing) when everything is right (right place, right time, right people) and the real "FOMO" spikes happen. It can happen anytime. You can also observe these seasonal changes in various other financial instruments, markets and businesses. Even I have similar experience with a business I run; I make less money around summer time, everytime, without an expection. Doesnt matter how much I spend on advertising or anything. People are out there, enjoying the summer, not consuming what I provide. There are times when they consume my product more, sometimes they consume it less. At times, its totally random. Sometimes when they see a lot of other people consuming it, others follow and a real "FOMO" effect happens. Summers have always been the worst, for me. The best time ever, coincidentally, is always the fall/winter time. Just like the BTC bull run. People get back to school, to work, get back on the grind. And voila, they return and want to enjoy. Im not sure how much it applies here, but just telling you my experience with running a business of a certain type.
More than 85% of the worlds population lives in the northern hemisphere, so summer months and people outside living life makes perfect sense. How many ATH’s took place in the summer? You’re correct that John Q. Public doesn’t care right now though and until the market shows serious signs of life they won’t be back and bitcoin will continue to bleed out followed by months and months of stagnation. 
Just saying man. Its painfully obvious whenever you've taken a short position - you try your hardest to suppress any other counter trend or bulls position you possibly can. 
I think you missed that he was just messing around :P 
I can also sound like a dinosaur want to hear?

*Takes in deep breath*

Hahaha jk, that's silly you'd only be able to read it!
Grats mate, that's awesome. Weren't you close to getting liquidated though? 

I know why the quotes are there, that wasn't the question. Do you read at a 1st grade level?
Yep. Well...there are some parallels to uranium. Prior to its discovery as a useful nuclear fuel, it was basically worthless. Then the value shot up drastically.
Stocks.  I unsterstand why the housing collapse happened, but why did stocks also wildly sell off?

I’ve read and heard stories about people losing thousands/millions in retirement funds, investment accts, etc., but why did they sell after losing so much?

I’m not an economics person but I’m also down more than I’d like but I’m of the mindset that you’re not down until you sell.

I’m trying to relate it to BTC now.

Edit: Spelling
Yes. Thanks for correction 
When I start playing again in 2k19 I’ll reach out to you. I’ll show you the ropes and we can kill things together 
I honestly would like to see the stats for the unbanked in the world who are even interested in such a volatile currency for spending or holding. Andreas says  that the unbanked will pick BTC. What proof is there? He says these beautiful optimistic  statements over and over again until people believe him and send him enough tips to make him rich. He's smart, but do you actually think he's gone in the field and talked with people in small villages about using BTC? I seriously doubt he talks to anyone who isn't already in his BTC bubble like most people on the bitcoin forums. Maybe when we bottom and the speculators dry up there will finally be some incentive to create apps for poor villagers which are easy to use. Until then, it's all pie in the sky talk I've heard way too many times. 
The point i'm trying to make here is that trading and as you put it online casinos... is by no means at all a use case for the masses.  

So far in the life span of crypto there is little to no real world usage. That's fine, one day it will come. I do not see any big bull run again until we start seeing the average man on the street being able to use crypto to operate in the real world, doing real world things such as purchasing food, clothes, electrical goods in the high street. 

We are some time away from that. 

How is price far too low to be bearish??? 
Yea I've got a few upvotes on your RES tag, just could swear I saw you in SRD a while back. But it's probably from here.

Thanks man I appreciate that a lot :)
True that, Mike. Most truth spoken in this sub today.

Edit: soybean shill, something I did not think I would ever be called. Even on reddit. 
I’ll vouch for you 😉
Ah gotcha, all good
hey you're not supposed to do the work for me 😋

I generally like to do everything in python just cause it's so easy and there's wrappers/libraries for all sorts of languages. 

I'll check that out, it'd be fun to mess around with it. I might fire up an AWS server or something to keep it up and running if I actually do it 
> That's not the same thing as bding insolvent, you dope.

actually it is.

if you cant complete audits it likely means funds that do exist are fraudulently obtained or not part of the process of selling tethers.
Imagine how much worse it'd be if I said stuff like "I'm telling you, do NOT buy here." but you're totally cool with it when he does it. 

like 90% of the time my comments end with "but idk, could go up" lol
This guy gets it! BTW I am short, but I didn't open it down here
I've been liquidated for larger amounts multiple times trying to long this dogshit. I was close to liquidation up at 7750 on this position.
Everything collapsed because of collateralized debt related to housing. Financial institutions both large and small all across the country owned collateralized housing debt that they were told by rating agencies was investment-grade but that was actually graded improperly and was worth far less than its intended value. So every default had a magnified ripple effect throughout the economy as, before the waves of nationwide defaults, the debt was repackaged and resold and resold again until almost every institution  owned a piece of it. Then when institutions started to default after many nationwide waves of individual defaults the whole scenario was magnified again, and the interlinked nature of the financial system meant that all of the repackaged and resold bad debt threatened to bring the entire thing down. At the time, they were seriously speculating about martial law and tanks on the streets of America if large consumer banks started to default, which they probably would have without all of the bailouts.

All of these systemic issues were exacerbated by too much leverage in the system. As we fell more and more, more and more investors received margin calls and had to liquidate other, less depressed assets in order to meet their financial obligations. That put more sell pressure on the less depressed assets until everything was selling off as people sold anything they could to raise cash to pay off their margin calls, and those that did not have margin calls were pressured to sell anyway just from the overwhelming downward pressure of so many other people liquidating everything they could. This is why gold sold off with the rest of the market, even though gold was supposed to be a safe haven. This is why btc will not be a good safe haven in another 2008 market environment. All speculative assets get crushed as huge numbers of people are forced to liquidate anything they can to pay off debt from other markets with all of the associated effects of that.

Anyway, to answer your question, most of them sold because they were forced to. Only those on no leverage and who had not invested more than they could afford to lose could afford to wait it out, just like btc.
The idea of "systemic collapse" was very real - it wasn't presented to the public this way, but we were close to everything grinding to a halt. All banks failing and no companies having lines of credit. Supply chains collapsing overnight. Nobody would be paid, stores would not have had things to sell, etc. So when it looked like these banks really WERE going to fail, many people panicked.

Now I didn't - I was in my 20s and just starting to build my nest egg. I had 40+ years to recover. But people closer to retirement did not have the luxury of time. They had to sell - they could not afford to lose it all.  Fear makes people do silly things, but in this case it was warranted.  While I would have had a large unrealized loss for awhile, many others would have been forced to realize that loss.  Even my peers fell into a trap here. Having never invested before, they were struck with a feeling of shock when they saw what the market did.  In short, they sold after losing so much because they saw a risk of losing even more.  And everyone has their limit where they throw in the towel and capitulate.

If you believe that Bitcoin will always recover from declines and your timeframe is long enough, then you'll be like me - you won't have to sell and realize the loss. It'll stay a paper loss until it eventually recovers.  But make no mistake, it's still a loss, even if it's unrealized.  "You're not down until you sell" only works out if there's 0 chance of you being forced/compelled to sell.  My larger concern is with the assumption that Bitcoin will always recover.  If it doesn't - if something catastrophic happens and it goes to $1, then would you still feel like you hadn't lost anything?  




Ok, its late for this, but banks and investment firms had huge liabilities based in mortgage backed securities, credit default swaps and collateralized debt obligations that required government intervention. Banks are public stocks, arguably at the time the foundation of our equity market providing liquidity to all. 

And everything is correlated. If Lehman Brothers, Countywide can fail, why would I have faith in other current valuations of any equity that is also AAA rated if the largets issuer of mortgages can go down? Fear, uncertainty, doubt. That equals flee to cash my man. 
Don't do it!

t. >200 days played from age 15-20
I'd love to see them too; they don't really exist though.

As for volatility, bitcoin's has been falling with adoption, and is about 3.26% today. (https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/volatility-index/) The top currencies can get up to about a 2% volatility already so it's not as bad as it sounds... Just looks worse because we measure in dollars. 

Andreas says the poor will pick BTC when it becomes their best option. So far it has not, but we get closer to that every day, especially with the LN. 

> do you actually think he's gone in the field and talked with people in small villages about using BTC?

I think he's done enough of this to realize that all you learn from the ground is how ignorant about money the people really are. They're just looking for safety for their stored value and bitcoin hasn't looked like that to them yet, but is approaching that soon, especially with the failing health of the existing financial system today.

If you feel Andreas is full of hot air, how about the economist Saifedean Ammous? His book (The Bitcoin Standard) approaches hyperbitcoinization from a different angle, and is far more convincing that Andreas' arguments IMHO.

If you don'[t want to pay for it, he gives away a lot of the content in talks on youtube.   
I did not equate trading to online casinos, online casinos are very different, it was an example of a different service. Video games are another, while in the area of entertainment, Bitcoin can be sent to a video game in exchange for micro transaction currency spent in the game's shop, just as fiat is used to do. Entertainment is of course not the only realm of a service. 

"The masses" will not be driven to cryptocurrency by these capabilities alone, we also don't need the masses to raise in price, the same people in the industry (more now then a year or two ago) generate money on a regular basis, ya know? 

What will drive the masses is major financial pain from the legacy economies, simple as that. From there they can discover.

The price is too low because it is nearly 70% off the ATH, why is that not too low?


You know me in real life? O_O
https://c3js.org/samples/simple_multiple.html

if you want to keep this online it's more of a php thing. curl, save to sqlite lite, display. i have several severs online 24/7, including several collocated ones, just saying. maybe this could be a good start of a fresh new project. kinda "coinwatch" but for major interest research only. nothing of the sort on the market yet. if you want to talk about it, you're welcome to send me a private. we can see what we can do about it.
> if you cant complete audits it **likely means** funds that do exist are fraudulently obtained or not part of the process of selling tethers.

No, it doesn't, you dunce. There are other reasons for not being able to produce an audit, one being the issues surrounding securing a stable banking partnership.

Why do you troll so hard?


It doesn't really bother me either way, but unlike you, he isn't in here spreading his propaganda every day. His comment history is very sparse and I really doubt he has any kind of agenda by posting once a week. 
I remember you praying to the bitcoin gods :-D. Well done this time around, happy for you. Gut gemacht!
Who put their money on margin though? Or rather, who understood what their broker was telling them?
> At the time, they were seriously speculating about martial law and tanks on the streets of America

48 hours. We came within 2 days of completely unfathomable events unfolding.  Imagine if everyone starts their day, tries to go to work, and finds that no gas stations have gas, no grocery stores are open, and their job won't be giving them a paycheck.  It could well have been the end of capitalism in the West.
So people trusted the banks and brokers with their money who gambled it on sub-prime mortgages and credit swaps and lost it on the default...but did they choose to sell their investment account?

I guess I should have clarified my question to be who sold their stock at the bottom...the investor or the broker?
I appreciate your responses and i will certainly check it Mr Ammous and his theories. Let's hope BTC succeeds either way. It would be wonderful for the world if it were stable at 5 million per coin. Totally possible! Good luck to you
What will drive the masses is being able to actually use the coin. Simple as that. 

It has to have every day use or it will never reach the masses. 

Why is 70% not too low? Because it can go lower that's why. There is no arbitrary percentage that you can use and say, well it's already at 70 so it can't go lower. Of course it can. I'm sure people said it's already at 60...how can it go lower. 

No doubt if we get to 80% people will say the same
> one being the issues surrounding securing a stable banking partnership.

they allegedly have a banking relationship, noble.
> he isn't in here spreading his propaganda every day.

lol, honestly mate I'm sorry I post a lot. Just block/ignore me. I really wouldn't be offended at all. 

I'm like 99% sure I have 0 affect on the price of bitcoin. I just like sharing my ideas. 
Thanks haha ;P
I don’t really understand your question. People put their own money on margin. If someone didn’t understand what their broker was telling them then they are a fucking moron who shouldn’t have been investing.

Individuals being on margin is different from there being too much institutional leverage in the system. There was so much institutional leverage in the system unrelated to individuals on margin because of all of the shared, collateralized debt that was repackaged and resold so many times and because of the explosion of the derivatives market. Basically there was a problem with individuals using too much leverage via margin and there was a separate problem with institutions using too much leverage which was basically a systemic problem at that point. 
The investor sold it, fearing total loss.  

Well, its a bit more complex than that. The global financia bedrock was literally fucked. Balance sheets that were made up of assets no one understood. They literally did not know who owned what. OR, imagine this, if you shorted the market, if the counterparty was bankrupt, you don't get paid for betting right. You short bitcoin and the exchange goes under due to insolvent books, kick in the dick. 

I mean if you have retail Joe, he is going to see headlines that the financial world is coming to an end. Exit all markets. 

If you have pension manager Charlie, he is responsible for managing risk, so he sees the same headlines and goes to treasury bonds.

Then you have hedge trader Bill, he knows that Joe and Charlie are going to freak out so he shorts and buys back lower. Dominos. Who catches knives the best? Well, that is what people write books on. 

If you want to equate this market to btc, I'd research the dotcom bubble, more applicable than this, imo. 
The masses can use the coin, of course they can. I say, they need to be driven to it by a sense of necessity and self preservation, the functionality is of course there and still getting better, but the masses do not break their norms until their norms break them. But again, it's silly to act like we need world domination to facilitate any growth.

I'm not against it going lower, I only explained why I think it's low enough now, and earlier said that I WILL NOT aid in the effort of making it lower, not with my money and not with my words. My trades aren't threatened by a lower price though, I have many years to do this.
That was after they parted ways with the auditor, numbnuts. 

Stop trolling.
I don't want to block you. I do genuinely enjoy some of your ideas, but I don't think it's cool to attack someone else just because they have a different opinion than you. He made a good call at 13K, even if it wasn't the absolute top, and he's making a new call now which probably won't be the absolute bottom either, but we'll see how it plays out. 
I'm simply asking, what examples are there where the masses can use crypto to help in daily life. As they do with regular money.

There are hardly any right now, that is the issue with the current crypto space, it needs a bigger use case to become far more relevant. This will drive price for the next bull run 
Yea, I probably went a little too hard. I just read some dude in /r/litecoinmarkets or /r/ethtrader I forget which saying shit like "why did I believe you guys?" yada yada

and honestly I just feel like I gotta do my part in tempering some of the near permanent bullishness that most people here have. 

I know no one believes this is going much lower but it really could and I encourage people to have a plan. The "I'm telling you, it's stupid to sell here" stuff is all just an appeal to emotion. 

I've tried to entirely avoid that sort of thing, and if I have done it I never intended to or I was emotionally shitposting and I'm sorry. 

but ya, honestly half of what annoyed me was the authoritywith which he posted. Yesterday I called out another guy for saying we were going below $6k *for sure* as well
Foreign person working in another country, can send BTC to their family without needing a high fee middle man or permission. 

Less prosperous countries with undesirable or no banking available, can engage in commerce with BTC. 

Countries experiencing continuous high levels of inflation benefit greatly from simply holding (store of value is generally the best use case, but not the only). Likewise any person simply looking to diversify investments can use this hedge.

Kids of any age can benefit from acquiring BTC, gives more freedom in spending money online, trading with friends, and is likely a very interesting tech endeavor for them.

Business owners who accept BTC do not have to be concerned about chargebacks, a major cost for many who take cards, big businesses end up needing a fraud department. With BTC paying customers there should not need to be a fraud department.

What more would you like covered for the evasive masses? Like I said earlier there is much more that can be done if it is sought out. I recently ordered kratom (first time buying it ever) on a website that accepts BTC but not a debit card (only accepted check of some sort?) very convenient for me as an average citizen in the US who happens to have BTC. The process of paying with BTC online is better than typing in card numbers, in my opinion.
Fair enough man. Much respect to you. Have a great day
dear oh dear i'm talking about simple day to day tasks, that the general public on average use money for. 

for example, shopping, restaurants, bars, taxis, airlines, buying clothes, holidays.

It's not that hard to understand surely
Thanks, and I'm sorry if I posted emotionally. I will do my best to keep it in check and make sure I am posting as objectively as possible.

Appreciate your thoughts and input and am always open to criticism. 

Apologies again for being such a frequent poster, I try my best to scale it back and fail miserably :) 
What? BTC is a protocol for money, in order for it to be used for those day to day things, it is up to those businesses and services to make it a payment option, some have some haven't, shouldn't this be obvious? I'm still not even sure why you feel complete mass adoption is a necessity right now, systems are going to live alongside each other, the perfect situation for Bitcoin is a major endgame of dominance and there's no reason to expect it now. There has been a huge success in adoption over the last year, people are simply afraid at this point in time, but this point in time is nothing relative to the long term progress
you are not listening. At all.

Can people use Bitcoin right now to do every day things? No they cannot. 

Can an average member of the public go to the supermarket to buy food with it, no
Can you go to the cinema with it, no
Can you buy your clothes in the street with it at major chains, no
Can you book your flight with major airlines with it, no
Can you pay for your taxi with it, no

I'm talking about those things, the things we all do daily. Please try to understand that 
Have you tried searching for businesses that would accept BTC for those activities? Yes you can pay certain taxis in crypto, yes you can book certain flights, etc. If any of these things are completely not available to purchase with BTC anywhere in the world, it simply means there is potential edge that could be gained if someone would like to establish it.
First of all, the list I made earlier which seems to be ignored are day to day things too, at least some of them, they were just things that are always available, in a broad sense, because they have nothing to do with specific businesses and their payment options.

Bitcoin cannot force a business to accept it as payment, that's what is obvious. These day to day things you are listing, CAN be engaged in with BTC, in some situations today, it DEPENDS on what payment options are available. Today, some business owners find BTC to be very desirable, and so they enable it, the others don't or don't know. Is it clear now? 
Go down to you local mall and buy the basics with Bitcoin, then we can talk about adoption
you're just not getting it. It doesn't matter whether or not Bitcoin can do these things or not, all that matters is that it is not being used that way yet. 

The fundamentals do not matter at this stage, if business does not use it for payment then it will not be used by the masses for every day life. 

without that, demand will never increase to the levels needed to push price into another huge bull run. For now, the public have heard about Bitcoin and crypto but that's likely no longer enough. They want to be able to use it properly, and until that day comes not much will happen
The benefits of commerce are not all or nothing.

Bitcoin is in a unique position because it can capture segments of the entire world without conflict. If you happen to live in a country whose currency is not very good, try and take it to a US Mall, I bet they won't take it, does this invalidate that country's currency by your logic?

You may say they could just convert to USD, well same with BTC.
of course it's not all or nothing but my point stands, you cannot spend crypto on much at all that is useful in day to day living by the general public. 

How you can argue with that I do not know. As I said, fast forward to a time when you can pay your mortgage, rent, car insurance, petrol, food shopping, clothing needs, train travel with crypto and then we've got adoption and then we'll see some amazing price rises 
Yes you can, you just need to be setup and know what's available to you, some people do live on BTC without any fiat conversion and have for years. 

You also can't do many day to day things (such as spending on the internet) if you have no bank account, you need to go through that process to gain more ability or jump through other hoops (buy gift cards with cash?)

No where in the world has Bitcoin dethroned the most established local means of payment, and it does not need to, because it works anywhere in the world and every instance of commerce adds up. I think there is more of it happening than you assume, it's a big world.
OK so you're saying the average person, therefore millions upon millions of people in say America or the UK can live day to day on Bitcoin...

You may be out of touch with reality if you believe that 
That depends entirely on the amount of goods and services available in that area accepting BTC, if the capacity for that many people is not there then some % can do business and the rest will need to come back when things are restocked or when competition springs up, this would not be some disaster, there will be alternative options always. But yeah it can be done so long as supply meets demand.
You're not listening at all. It is currently not possible to do the things I listed in the US or UK for example. Not even remotely close.

You know that. No shops exist en masse, again you know this.
You are being deliberately difficult.

So I can't talk to you anymore sorry 
Not sure what you mean, for example I can just buy Amazon gift cards in the US with BTC and then have all my groceries delivered super easy, what is difficult about it? I'm sure the UK has plenty of similar means to do business with BTC.
In fact a while ago there were big discounts on buying gift cards with BTC (might've hurt on the run up to 20k, but not now!), maybe that's still going on I haven't checked.
You're not listening. I clearly said,

Can you go to supermarket and buy food, no
Can you buy cinema tickets, no
Can you buy clothes in the mall, no
Can you pay for your taxi, no
Can you book flights with major airlines, no
Can you pay for your car insurance, no
Can you buy petrol, no
Can you pay for the dentist, no
Can you buy electrical goods at the major chains, no

I can't make it any more simple for you. 
If I go to the right place, yes to all of those.
How come buying gift cards isn't valid? It's not the only means, but a great one
Never seen that place in my life. No one has
Jesus christ... I give up
Just don't forget that your country is not the only one, and there are more places to look than you could imagine
