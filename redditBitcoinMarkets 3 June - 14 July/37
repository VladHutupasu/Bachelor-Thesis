The stability we've been talking about is settling in. With that, instead of talking about bull vs bear we're talking about distribution vs accumulation. Essentially, we're trying to figure out who's hiding their play and why they're hiding it. Is the market more competitive for people who are trying to build a position or people who are trying to close a position?

I've been highlighting periods that reflect accumulation.

But, where are examples of distribution that look similar to our current position?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/2Q87w6GM/

I'm not seeing a lot that looks extremely similar, but there are some things that stand out.

Distribution periods are preceded by overbought markets and are followed by the price dropping substantially. That's a valid risk.

Periods of distribution can link up to each other. So, you can see one after another.

Periods of distribution are often accompanied by periods of moderate volatility (as observed, not as defined).

**Periods of distribution tend to happen near market tops.**

This is the one worth focusing on, because I see a lot of people saying that this looks like another period of distribution. That's hard for me to believe when we've already gone through several periods that qualify as distribution and **we're near a market bottom.**

First ill go through a lucky (?) little entry ive had on Tuesday. I don’t really know if you guys give a shit but I think it was quite a nice bottom fishing play.

These were the charts:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/kCQ4g7jy/

https://www.tradingview.com/x/jZ1CUQnk/

After a bearish engulfing daily, I figured we might go lower. Then I thought that 7k was a nice support so fishing for longs just above it and stop loss just below could work. Had 4 orders set, 2 didn’t fill, one filled quite early on into the drop and the last one nailed the bottom almost perfectly (off by 1USD). Entries were @ 7430, 7345, 7275 and 7200.

I mean, it wasn’t that great but getting that one order at 7345 when bottom of bounce was 7344 felt pretty noice.

Anyway, looking at the chart today, nothing really changed since the start of june. Its pretty much just been sideways. Everyone and their nan is watching the meme triangle, which in all fairness, looks like a cute little consolidation, lower highs and higher lows with decreasing volume. So far so good.

We got a weekly inside bar forming with 2 days left on the weekly, all that means for now is that this week was less volatile than last [1]. Weekly Bbands seem to be tightening up as well [2]. Interesting thing to note is that the middle of the weekly Bband is getting close the top of the meme triangle, creating a nice little confluence between 8700 and 9000. Not gonna look at momentum indicators on Mex cos I don’t think theres enough data.

Moving to the daily, pretty similar to the weekly. Things are starting to get "boring" for some people. Times like these are great for planning what you're gonna do when it stops being "boring" and I think it will soon. Financial instability hypothesis comes to mind [3]. Basic idea is that stability brings instability (volatility) with it. Really interesting shit imo. Volume on the daily is still pretty shit [4] but the days with most volume (apart from 23/05 dump) have been green (29/05 bounce and 05/06 bounce).

Only things that have me worried on the daily are Stoch RSI topping out and a possible bear div on OBVOSC but the div is very minimal for now [5]

4H is bit more interesting, we have the Bart chop but we always some to find the pink line (shout out Carter Thomas for pointing it out) Care though, the 4h chart has a lot more shit on it [6]. But look at those Bbands… tasty. Im not too sure how to use this tool, I think its just a shitload of MAs but look at how clumped together they all are [7]. Potential hidden bull div on 4hr with a stoch rsi bull cross? [8]

Im sure theres shit I missed but I honestly think this looks great. The more we move side ways the more pressure build up there is and the harder we will pop. Im leading on the pop being bullish. Perfect scenario imo? Slow steady move towards the top of the meme triangle. Why slow and steady? So we have a shitload of pressure when we break to through. We smash through the triangle and 10k, media picks up on it and we have FOMO coming in once again. Worst case scenario? All this pressure ends up blowing us to the downside and we see 4900-4300. What happens then? I aint got a fucking clue lol.

What im doing? Still holding my long from earlier in the post and im really considering just letting it ride but watching momentum and how it interacts with resistances, once we start losing higher lows on the daily, ill probably close. That’s assuming upside. Assuming downside, SL at 7300, at 7k I sell all my alt positions that are in profit and below 6500 I short.

These next couple of weeks are gonna be very interesting imo. Im using this time to learn and prepare as much as possible. Gonna try to learn Ichimoku over the weekend/next week.

Other than that, don’t listen to random strangers on the internet and good luck.

Is it just my confusion or is there difference of opinion here whether this is accumulation phase or distribution? Comments below in the last half hour or so suggest both  . . . does this link help at all? . . Thoughts?https://www.wyckoffsmi.com/accumulation-or-distribution/
Anyone else feeling a little confused?

This whole slow climb looks like its ready to fall off a cliff, but every dump leaves us with consistently higher lows.

I don't really know what to think of this. 
Wow has this market gotten boring. I only check the price every couple hours now instead of every few minutes. 
I'm starting to lose interest in bitcoin. That means that capitulation is close for me. But that same capitulation makes me hyped and attracted to bitcoin for a recovery. It's a strange time.
Pro tip for anyone else tired of waking up rich and going to bed poor, just adjust your sleep cycle by ~12 hours. 

Either direction is fine.
> During this period of indecision, the highs and the lows seem to come together in the point of the triangle with virtually no significant volume. Investors just don't know what position to take.

Can everybody stop talking and bitching about low volume? Jesus christ the past week in this thread is low volume this low volume that. Yes, everybody can see it. This is literally a textbook trading 101 pattern that's playing out to a t. LET IT PLAY OUT



Well, thats one hell of a one minute candle
Big ass pennant since January is going to be done the latest on the 27th this month. What is everyone's take on the direction. Up or down?
It seems like a lot of people are going long/knife catching/getting their bull on. So I just wanted to chime in with why I'm sitting on my hands for now.  As it stands, we have spent the last 2 weeks floating underneath the [50 Week MA](https://www.tradingview.com/x/54j5ZSQo/).

The only other 2 times in Bitcoin's history that this has happened are shown below:

[2011 Crash Pattern](https://www.tradingview.com/x/1oy3QZYD/). A drop of 58.83% from the 50 Week MA.

[2014 Crash Pattern](https://www.tradingview.com/x/WPN516Ok/). A drop of 69.18% from the 50 Week MA.

I think a sensible overview of the market (for me) is this:

- Very bearish <50 Week MA.

- Mildly bearish <200 Day MA.

- Neutral - Bullish > 200 Day MA.

- Bullish > $12,000.

- Very bullish > $20,000.

I hear cries of "This time is different!", and you may well be right.  The biggest thing I'm holding on to right now is that compared to the 2 previous crash patterns we aren't giving up on that 50 Week MA without a fight. It does still look salvageable.

Anyway, to close this out: I'm putting a new rule in place for my trades as of now.  No more longs until I see a weekly close over the 50 Week.

I hope this helps someone and good luck with your trades people!

Looking at the top 100 richest BTC wallet here :https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html

We see that most big players have not sold during the bear market and are accumulating at these prices. 

Exchanges wallet on the other hand are slowly redistributing their tokens.
Added to my short. Longs are in pain due to high rates and sideways action, 4hour tightening and we're still under 50 week MA. Unless there has been an explosion in BTC interest the past week I think the only way is down.
Interesting perfect double tap off this line. Not entirely sure what to make of it: https://www.tradingview.com/x/YsMPrqie/
Just when I was even from my short.. 

This price action is really exhausting
Looks like more 7500

Good consolidation range. Price seems like people are willing to sell above 7500 and buy below 7500. Fair.

*Fair.*

#Fair.
*When volatility dies down, you better prepare your anus.* - Mark Twain
Daily RSI on shorts is starting to heat up.  https://www.tradingview.com/chart/ZgP5LYKx/

Short growth hasn't spiked yet though.
Am I wrong to speculate that the low volatility is a result of two pressures applying equal and opposite forces to the price? One pressure is downward, coming from the 6 month 20 K correction. The other pressure is pushing upward, coming from the long-term multi year upward trend. I can imagine those two forces squeezing and compressing the price, resulting in the low volatility we see today.

Don't worry guys... [I have it all figured out...](https://www.tradingview.com/x/TvUL9Vjj/)
It seems a little early to be labelling Bitcoin ‘stable’ after a few weeks of low price movement. 

It’s like calling a mass murderer ‘stable’ after two weeks in Jail.. “he doesn’t seem to have killed anyone in a while, I think he’s good”
Aloha!

Alright, it's been a while since I've done a market update. Been enjoying my time in between positions, focusing on my health, the house project, and building relationships.

Bitcoin is going pretty sideways. We've been in an $800 range for 17 days. What does sideways imply? Stability precedes volatility. What does this mean for you? Start paying attention.

I've got alarms set at $7200 and at $8500. If we break either one of those, probability of continuation greatly increases in that direction. What does this mean for a new investor? If you aren't already in this market and we start pushing past $8500 you could quickly begin to wish you had mobilized funds, got your Coinbase set up, and started paying attention. If you are in this market, you're probably just sitting on your hands. Well, if we start going down you might wanna sell some and buy it back lower to increase your BTC holding.

So! This has been an alert. Keep your ear to the ground cuz you never know when this shit is gonna start rumbling. My timeframe for confirmation of either move is about 2 weeks (could go THOOOOPER sideways for months though).

----

This is a copy paste from social media, target audience is new money. 

For us guys I'll give some words. This is a no trade zone until we break one way or the other. Rest right now. Get ready to hit it hard cuz a trend is coming. I've been out of position since May 14 and before that April 11. I've been  only taking shorts, just as during the bull market I only took longs. 

If we can get above $8k I'd consider scaling into a short to try to catch the top of the range, or if I was bull (im not until proven wrong), long near $7k.

Otherwise, just hang tight folks. Reset your emotions. Let that 3d BBAND pinch a bit. Go outside. Work time is coming.
If you're familiar with me, you know how bullish I am. If not--I am about as far down the bull spectrum as you can get--as in, "Bitcoin will topple the established financial regime" bullish.

This period we're in, though? **I love it**. Don't get me wrong, I'll take a bull market any day, but I deeply despise the opportunists; the Aaron Burrs of the world who care not which direction humanity goes as long as they're on top of the pile. They don't have a stance on BTC, nor do they understand blockchain. It's all a game to increase their net worth. And right now, the Burristas are losing hand-over-fist trying to leverage-trade their way to riches. "Up? Down? Fuck it--more material for me."

Shoutout to the long-term believers, bull and bear alike. You're the only ones I want to emerge from this jungle unscarred. To the rest--good luck, but no mercy.     
In the next 3 days ( 6/11)  the market is going to have to make a decision if it doesn’t make one by then. . Bitcoin is being forced into a corner 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/LzcaF6R2/

I’m guessing up, but I’m also long 90% of my stack. We just made another higher low on the 4H but also failed to make a higher high. But at this point this entire range has been ~~lower~~  higher lows and lower highs so I’m not sure what to make of it.

Zoomed in:  https://www.tradingview.com/x/eNYesrdK/
On cryptowat.ch, if you're in log view, and you draw a line, and then switch back to the standard view, you've got that logarithmic line still visible (now you see that line as a curved line). On tradingview if I switch from log, the lines switch to actual linear and so I can't have logarithmic lines without being in logarithmic mode. This is annoying because I want my logarithmic trendlines visible on my standard view chart. Does anyone know a way around this.

Yes this is on topic because I'm trying to chart BTCUSD using both log lines and linear lines (both important for doing TA on Bitcoin)
Everybody is waiting it out and looking for cheaper prices. Self-fulfilling prophecy?
Why do you all think you know more now? We went down a bit and up a bit, no decision yet, still sideways, keep calm, it will find its way soon. There are still lottery tickets left for both sides. 
More exchanges getting CFTC subpoenas in the criminal manipulation probe. 

> CME, which launched bitcoin futures in December, asked the four exchanges to share reams of trading data after its first contract settled in January, people familiar with the matter said. But several of the exchanges declined to comply, arguing the request was intrusive, the people said. The exchanges ultimately provided some data, but only after CME limited its request to a few hours of activity, instead of a full day, and restricted to a few market participants, the people added.

> The dispute frustrated CME’s regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, these people said. **In response, the commission subpoenaed the exchanges for the data.** CFTC officials backed the launch of bitcoin futures, saying they viewed it as a risky but worthwhile project.

Buy on June 6th they said...
Hopefully this support will hold here otherwise bulls will be in a tough spot. Even if support breaks, though, it is hard to tell where we will go. I think sub 7k is still unlikely as there just aren't enough sellers to push us that far unless a bear whale can start getting others to panic sell. More chop seems to be the likely thing here; 7.5 to 7.8 is our range still, maybe 7.2 if some fomo selling occurs.
Why does stability lead to instability? I have been reading about Minsky moments and I can grasp how they apply to traditional large scale financial systems, but why is the same true for Bitcoin? Clearly it does happen but for different reasons? For Minsky moments that affect whole economies the timescale is years or decades, but the same phenomenon occurs over the course of days or weeks in this market. Why? 
I have this feeling that everything just looks so weak,  not like it might bounce down heavy so shorting is not interesting, but just low volume, low interest, low movements

Place your bets people. Market is up for a biiig move. ETH slap in the middle of ETH/USD and ETH/BTC range (this pattern has been forming for months!). Bitcoin slap in the middle of it's equilibrium pattern of the last couple of days, 3 day candle opened and the weekend just started. Everything tight as hell. You wanted volatility, you'll get it probably today but 100&#37; in the coming three days.

Well we are just above the bottom of the 4hour cloud and just above the support trend line running from our lows on 29th May and 5th June. 

This number is roughly 7480.

Break under that are could spell a bit of trouble...
Updated Bubble Aftermath chart: https://imgur.com/Szl7Qn6

We entered sideways consolidation at about the same time as the 2013 and 2014 bubble cycles, and it has almost lasted as long. I'm still looking for a move up within the next week or so.

Chart explanation: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8noyex/daily_discussion_friday_june_01_2018/dzxwn1k/
What happens when the volume goes to 0? It's pretty close. And I thought the price should decline slightly because of miners selling, ppl cashing out because 0 roi for months etc. yet we see the price within the same 10$ range for 12 hours straight. 

Everything seems so artificial now. Artificial life support botty mcbot shit. 

"Fair price" is a joke anyway, people aren't here for a stagnant price.
 Seen sporadic discussion of volume here with some claiming that it's not actually that low and that December/January was just highly abnormal.

Okay, maybe. That said, it doesn't mean volume isn't low for the price point. The last time we were at this level of volume (BTC\-wise) for any period longer than one candle on the 3d chart is late June 2017 with the price in the 2ks.

The last time we were at this volume level on the 3d chart fiat volume\-wise was late September at around 4k.

Read into that whatever you'd like, I'm not one to subscribe to the belief that a trend *necessarily* have volume backing it, especially after a fall and before the rise back (though it certainly reinforces it). Just saying I think it's fair to say the volume is low compared to what you might expect.

I'm at the end of my fucking wits.. Can anyone offer insights?

Edit: Reposting on the new daily
Seems everyone outside this sub is predicting the bull run breakout.. is it time to short yet again?
I'm gonna do a deeper analysis and show you guys my current position a bit later but for now i want to talk about a slightly different topic.

I dont have blind faith in BTC. I can easily see a future where it goes to nothing, world moves on and forgets about it.

I'm here cos i dont trust commercial and central banks and i believe that in the next 6-24 months the economy is gonna go tits up. I see BTC as an alternative/hedge to the global financial system. If the economy goes to shit and BTC flies up, then lovely, probably be set for life. BTC goes to shit? No problem, finish school and live life as if nothing ever happened.

I dont even know if any of this makes sense, what im trying to say is that if you have a legit reason for being here other than just getting loaded in a week then any price moves dont mean shit to you.

I dont really care that much what BTC does until i see it during a recession/banking collapse/whatever. Until then, its just noise.
Broke support of the small triangle, bigger triangle support now at 7530 USD. If we break this line, then we might  get some volatility
Here is a poll for bears only (people how expect that his long\-scale consolidation period breaks out to the downside). If you want to buy BTC back at a lower place or if you want to close a short order. Where is the place where you would put this buy order, if you could only place it now?

[https://strawpoll.com/wb4ddeda](https://strawpoll.com/wb4ddeda)
We have support of the huge triangle at 7.2 now, going long here with 10x 1% stack, gonna double up if we bounce there or on the break of 7.8.

This is just long-term position in case this triangle wants to break up and trend reverses, not planning to close it or take profits anytime soon if it goes up, I'm planning to add to this from time to time. Bail out if we break down below 7.2 (liq point).

In fact it's a hedge of my yesterday's short gamble so they'll even out if this breaks down.

!long XBTU18 7730 10x 1%

Edit: This is an attempt to go 100x with 2.5% on a long term long trade with CA below 10k but I'm actually gambling on the fact that the trend will reverse before that triangle breaks down. I know that I could wait and just go 2.5x later, but I'd like to keep this position until settlement if it goes my way and still swing trade on low lev with rest of my stack.
I don't think I've ever seen the price of BTC so stable for so long. It's almost a perfect -0.05% every hour. It's been amazingly consistent so far. Such a narrow channel holding for so long makes you wonder how far it will go before it breaks one way or the other. It's been in this channel for more than 24 hours so it can't be that much longer, right?
OK, I am not a huge conspiracy guy. But Dan from The Chart Guys puts forward a pretty compelling argument for some potential fuckery by exchanges and other bigger players who are trying to get into the space (today and in previous episodes). His video views/trading packages are down and extrapolating that across the space, others must be in the same boat since the space is boring us all to death. 

Basically, with the amount invested in infrastructure, new hires, lost income, the incentive to 'help' us break up from the triangle pattern is huge for those who have been trying to ramp up recently. Sure some people in here will be shorting, but a market going down brings in less revenue than a market going up. I picture it kind of like a stock buy back. 

Anyone got any thoughts on this? I believe GDAX and other exchanges terms of services say that they can purchase btc themselves on the exchanges. I have heard of crazier things in normal markets, and this is the wild wild west still.

Is there anything to this or just more FUD? . . https://www.ccn.com/mysterious-asian-whale-begins-funneling-funds-back-to-huobi/
*Hmmmm*

https://www.tradingview.com/x/QBNmUuYn/

Ide more more comfortable with it with one more touch at around $7530 where the ascending support line( red ) meets bottom support line from the wedge ( green ) 
So many members here just trying to catch a falling knife by adding long after long, when we are in this overall long term bear market. Let's just hope your gamble pays off.
hidden bullish divergence w/ 4hr MACD
slowly adding to my long 
Not going to overcomplicate this anymore, the fact is BTC has been down for half of a year and we're due for at least a small bounce before heading down to test fresh lows (if there's no breakout upwards eg. failure of inverse H&S) -- hence I am 100 percent long, stop limit out at break below 6.8k on heavy volume.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/VAjwf0cw/
I'm still bearish: [https://imgur.com/a/VvMMln3](https://imgur.com/a/VvMMln3)

We have some impulsive buying on that ascending support line/50 MA on the 4hr. But, it always fizzles out at resistance and makes rounded tops. Our second high was a higher high, but our most recent one made a lower high. I think we might make another rounded top here with another lower high, and slowly start rolling over perhaps on saturday/sunday or the open of the new weekly. 

The whole formation is a very sluggish rising shape, it's not a reversal formation at all. The small inverse H&S that Peter brandt pointed out failed to meet target and did not lead to a breakout, every attempt to break resistance fizzles out, and we slowly start drifting down as is typical of bear markets.

The impulsive buying has also been shorts closing the last two times, that is pretty much the only thing holding us up right now.

Edit: ETH is a more clear Adam and Eve top: [https://imgur.com/a/23qQk5I](https://imgur.com/a/23qQk5I) and LTC is flatlined at support, not a reversal structure at all. I know this isn't the alt sub but BTC can sometimes follow, and all majors are looking bearish.

I'm still seeing people predicting that the price will beat its all time high in the next few months or saying the bottom is in.  However, google trends is showing that interest in bitcoin is continuing to decline:  https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%203-m&q=bitcoin

To me, this indicates the downtrend is still intact.  Forget TA, just think common sense.  During bitcoin's bull run, where did you hear about bitcoin and what did you hear about bitcoin?  And now, where and what do you here about bitcoin?  The messaging and the amount of it is totally different.  

So if mass amounts of retail aren't buying, and if institutional adoption still has obstacles (we're struggling to get an ETF approved for example), then obviously, we should be biased towards believing in the downside price predictions, because that's the current trend.  The other thing is that bitcoin has been making the same price action for past couple of months (down a lot, then up a little, then sideways, then down a lot).  So going sideways doesn't automatically mean the price is likely to shoot up again, if anything the exact opposite.

I don't have any specific price predictions but all I'm saying is that I'm pretty sure of what isn't true.  I think that if what I said above is true, it invalidates anyone predicting a higher all time high this year or anyone saying the bottom is in.  It also means that, while we should believe in short term bounces of, at most, a couple tens of percent (which is great for trading), in general, we should be biased towards the downside in the medium term (ie: next 6 months).
We're touching the (very) short-term potential support line from the past 3 days:

[https://imgur.com/a/gwnOJst](https://imgur.com/a/gwnOJst)

We'll see if it holds!
I don't understand why people are shorting here with high leverage! The only price movements we see these days are caused by shorts getting liquidated.


The dynamics between inflationary financial markets and deflationary cryptocurrencies keep me up at night.

Anyone else feel the same?
These dumps just keep getting more and more anemic.  It looks like they're being a little smarter about it, doing it over a period of hours instead of big bursts, but the effect is not impressive at all.  Driving down the price a couple hundred bucks here and there might slow Bitcoin's rise, but it won't stop it, as we've seen since February.
Somebody is trying to force the market to make a decision, 500 ETH market sell on gdax

Edit: that or someone is very happy they unloaded 4k eth without pushing the price down

Edit2: or for those who want a different perspective, this guy/gal who managed to accumulate 4k ETH is an idiot for selling right before our next bullrun

Edit3: or for those who still want a different perspective, regardless of what I type here you are going to vote based off of your own position bias
This might seem like an really arbitrary point to keep returning to, offering both support and resistance on the way up and down at a random dollar value. 

I believe it's because this level is ‎¥840,000 on Bitflyer. A few days ago when the tops were jumping around to different levels on the USD charts, they were stopping at exactly this price point in Japan. 

This seems to be resistance turned support right now, but falling down further could mean picking up momentum.
Anyone else having issues with GDAX today?

People say that this bear market has no similarities to the bear market in 2014.

I say that is very false. I wonder if those people watched charts as intently back then as they do now...

This is just drab market action with buys or sells every so often that are relatively large compared to the book. People call this action Bart now. But it is very reminiscent of lulls in the swing of bear markets where liquidity is drying up.

Then once the makers are satisfied traders have lost all the money they're going to lose at these price levels they turn the dial on the sell pressure. Why do you think they bought so many bitcoin in spiking the price to $20k from $8k over a month?

Back to today, the price pings around and then dumps. Gets 'em every time.

I am just so bearish right now. This "bounce" is just pathetic and the volume is anemic. I just don't see very many scenarios where we survive another test of 6.8k.
The last BGC was ignited by a bunch of shorts closing, setting off a chain reaction of other shorts closing (probably partially orchestrated by various groups, or maybe not, doesn't change much). A bunch of shorts closed just now too in that medium green candle too, but this time it did not trigger a BGC. Probably means it's not the bottom yet. If it was, more shorts would have closed and we'd have a move take us over 8k.
Let's see what happens here.

hey guys, I was rather interested in this 6th of the month theory and tried to find some sort of pattern. Sadly any indicators i tried to use simply did not gave any useful data. I believe that this theory is not about a specific date but more like of a period of time in which bitcoin moves which happens in 29-32 days. So i decided to connect every 6th of the month with lines and see what happens. What i found out was that the 6th of january and the 6th of december were also rather important events for bitcoin. Before that, the 6th of any month was not rather eventful .What i discovered were 3 triangles https://www.tradingview.com/chart/6OJzaMnc/ 
I dont know how useful this is but the last 2 triangles ended with the 6th forming a lower low than the 6th at the beginning of the triangle. If we assume that 7050 was the bottom, then this triangle broke the patter forming a higher low, which I interpret as bullish. If we draw another triangle following the idea that every other triangle was less steep and had a wider angle, then we should expect to be trading in the price range of 8600-9000 in one month from now.
let me know what you think!
Good to see shorts increasing with the price staying steady
I'm not buying this yet.  Google trends continues to find a new low, yet we have a (weak-ass) bull push?  I'll continue to sit this out until our 90d volatility is lower.

Important learning point here for everyone. Multiple articles on June 5 and 6 were telling people to BUY BUY BUY. The correct thing you should have done was SELL SELL SELL. When your being told to buy, that means do opposite. Same thing when your being told to sell. This means buy. Just a a bit of advice for those day trading. 

Have fun trading 7450-7750 range again today.
Alright, it's just wash trading at this point 
I haven't studied this intensively, but I have thought accumulation also . . here the markup was the Nov-Dec rise, the distribution the Dec/Jan top, the markdown into Feb bottom, where we go into the present up/down(accumulation) of the symmetrical triangle to start over again. Maybe this is too simple of a view. I don't know. ?? http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-egmJHceYbp0/UZ8JecrULaI/AAAAAAAAA-A/7ivlc_S1XJY/s1600/wyckoff.png
Man this looks dope af. Not really sure about the conclusions but some nice spacey stuff. Good work.
that looks fanzy! nice work!!
If I understand correctly, the heavily saturated lines represent lags over a smaller (more recent) time frame, while the faint lines are longer lags? This seems to confirm the $10,000 level as the "bull run" turning point
What is the longest time period you're using on that chart?
yeah an ATH is meaningless. ignore it.  Ignore the 6600 double bottom too.  Just start drawing lines wherever you want.

Nice write up. I agree with the pressure building. Only problem is that the triangle we're in is usually a continuation pattern, which should point on the move down in near future.
your links aren't really working, the formatting I mean
Morpheus: *I know exactly what you mean*.

Are market makers merely shaping the perfect 2-week bull-trap or is it the real thing? Price action doesn't fit Wyckoff accumulation pattern so I remain sceptical and out of position since 9.9k. Market got me in tinfoil hat mode
I'm not confused at all, I'm bored with how predictable this consolidation is. People calling bear market are wrong, this is [long term consolidation](https://i.imgur.com/pOM5wXE.png) after the $20k bubble pop. The peaks and valleys will continue to get less extreme, price will be more and more discovered, and then out of nowhere we will start climbing and that climb will turn into a parabolic bubble again.

Bitcoin is a series of bubbles that ratchet upwards, it's so easy to predict and so frustrating that no one can see the long term.
I think the general consensus is that we are at the whim of the market makers until the market as a whole chooses a direction. Anything above 7.2 and below 7.8 can be regarded as noise
Nice timing...

Don't have a cow man

Lmao imagine everyone just leaves and it's like 6 whales trading amongst themselves.

Actually, it's not much different then it is now lol
Yeah, being absurdly wealthy in 2018 was interesting to me, but 2019? 2020? Why waste my time?
Not losing interest, but stating to grow a hatred for the asset. Especially during stagnation like this.
Yes same here...it's just starting to get old.  The market is becoming even more manipulated and difficult to trade and it's been regulated into something that only remotely resembles what it was a couple of years ago.
[deleted]
The low volume could be due to scared whales no longer trading due to subpoenas and regulatory pressure from the US government.
That's some grade a genuine market demand!
All the good news points to up for me but who knows?
It reaches a point mid August on my chart...
Up. 
up and down sideways.
Great post speaking from a certified knife catcher from 2013 and possibly again in June 2018. MA to me is tricky bc, while you can't just eliminate it, can't you possibly discount/discredit the price action from Dec 2017? I don't think any trader at the time thought BTC was worth anything above $10K especially when it 2-4x in a matter of weeks. Most would probably correctly argue that since it happened you can't just write it off but I'm of the thinking the price action from that time should be at least discounted (if there is a way to do that) 

It's almost like an average journeyman ballplayer having that 1 All-Star season where his stats were way above his average numbers skewing his stats.
Great post. Comments like this is why I come here. Thanks for your perspective. 
> I hear cries of "This time is different!", and you may well be right

Not from me. I'm saying, "This time is the same!"  Buying now is something like buying in mid-2015, at a flat-ish bottom of a long down swing.  We probably double in the next six months, then see something like 2017 next year.
What do you make of this?
They *cant'* sell. 

Not without totally tanking the value of their coins, actually working out numbers is a crime here so I won't offend anyone. Go through the orderbooks and see what would happen if just 50k coins were sold off. 
That was certainly a whipsaw back up on the same 15m candle (Binance)
I'm pretty sure I saw distribution in this range before we dropped down to 7500's today.. I will have a look at OBV later and try to figure out what's happening here
[deleted]
I thought that was Abraham Lincoln
I fully hedged at 7715 (june) last night, and I laddered buys on swaps from 7625-7515, 4/5 have executed. I hate going long on swaps because of funding, but my expectation is that I'll be holding this short a lot longer than this long. 

In effect I was just profit taking on my short without giving up my entry. If 7500 falls, things will get interesting. I probably won't cut my long until 7400 falls though.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/VIGkGAle/  

Thank you for your insight. I think 7400-7450 might be a target.
Great ... so soon a good old short squeeeeeezzzee
I guess technically, sure. All it really boils down to is that buyers don’t have enough pressure to push it up and sellers don’t have enough pressure to push it down. Couple that with the fact that not nearly as many people are trading now as they were in the past, and you’ve got low volatility.
I would agree if there was any volume...

GDAX about to break under 40k for ETH and 4k for BTC.  Seems to me like it’s just waning interest in pushing the price either direction.
Yes you are right. There's still a long term uptrend, but that's getting more and more flat. The short and intermediate term however are clearly trending down and rolling over. As you say there's a lot of pressure from both sides, that's why dips are quickly bought and pumps instant smacked down. The longer we stay here tough without going up, the higher the chances of a big move down, breaking the uptrend. The more the averages start sloping down, the higher the pressure becomes. It's very hard to turn the averages back around when they start breaking down, it needs a lot of momentum. That's why we get these failed rallies. The 200D MA is also pretty flat right now (not on the chart).

2014: [https://www.coinigy.com/s/i/5b1af1eb98a69/](https://www.coinigy.com/s/i/5b1af1eb98a69/) Same situation, it also took almost two weeks. Same EMA no less.   


(colors are a bit of an ugly mess, haven't gotten around to make something pretty)  

Thx for the notice. Everytime this has happened in this price area it resulted in a dump.. lets see if it stays true.
And that means no trader is left in the market with that many coins to sell, or either they are not willing to sell right now even if they have a small portion of it, otherwise if it was me and had the chance, I would sell into it if I thought the price is high enough..
Plausible and importantly, a rational take -- as hard it is to believe, seems like we are in the distribution part of a blow off top...and these next few months would make sense for consolidation/accumulation after a period of violent ATHs.  If this were to happen, it would be completely normal for BTC.  To break out upwards to a new bull trend now would be wildly out of character and sort of flies in the face of both TA and sidelines money action/interest. That said, it is a BTC subreddit, I know I am guilty of inherent bias and giving benefit of doubt to BTC going up.  

Really good job.

Well said. But 8500 is almost top of that triangle we're in. I'd scale into a short after bouncing off it or long after break out.

Aaron Burr is the epitome of America. I bet you would've voted for that southerner Jefferson.
Or we could continue sideways for another 2 months. A movement upon close of the triangle is possible, but in no way guaranteed.

I don't like the way that ascending triangle is drawn. I think it's invalid. We have horizontal at 7.8 but won't call it a triangle.
It is annoying. Thanks for letting us know it was on topic. 🙏 
It's just we're running out of both sellers and buyers. The question is which group will lose their patience faster.
good for bitcoin ^^^TM
Uggg finally, now all this price surpression can end and btc cab organically go back up to 20k again
This is great news.  The exchanges are engaged in all kinds of manipulation.  They have been since Gox.  Lately it looks very much to me like volume numbers are being fudged and more BTC is being lent out for shorting than the exchanges have in their wallets.  

I have been scouring the 500 biggest wallets trying to figure out where these big dumps have been coming from and coming up with nothing.  So it must be the exchanges lending out non-existent coins.  Would be very easy to do, and it would probably be hard to turn down  a few hundred million bucks from a dumper whose main interest seems to be suppressing the price, not making money.  If enough buyers are sending their coins off exchange, this could lead to a huge problem and the mother of all short squeezes as people scramble to pay back coins that just aren't there.

Personally, I would like to see this market become properly regulated.  
Not the first time they subpoena exchanges. Guess it's an ongoing thing. 
> Why does stability lead to instability? 

This is just my own theory but I think when you trade within a tight range people make a lot of assumptions about what is to happen next, the longer that this tight trading range exists the higher the assumptions and the higher the amount of money spent on those assumptions. 

Then the market moves in a particular direction a lot of people didn't expect and they're left sitting in a bad position and have to rectify it but generally it's too late and it's damage control... With a large amount of people in the market this leads to violent market movements. 
Traders don't make money off stability. We go broke off stability. We make money off of volatility. 
Weak hands.

Edit: actually a very good article. 

Btw you get one free article a day before the paywall kicks in — when I clear my cookies I can read it.
TL;DR: There's been an ongoing distribution from long term investors (strong hands) to speculators (weak hands) since late last year.
Fuck paywalls.
I mostly agree with the article. Anyone owning Bitcoins now is hoping to become rich, while the rich already sold most of their Bitcoins. That's distribution from the rich to the poor. The low volume confirms this.

In short, smart money has left the market already. Dumb money is gambling away theirs.
The ones who sold want to ride that train again. That's the bubble cycle.
Put it all on black!!!
You just told what everyone already knows. 
What is your view on the direction it will go?
This entire move is the clearest bear flag ever if you zoom out or use 3D Heikin Ashi candles. It's all tight indecision candles on low volume. On top of that we likely finished an entire daily cycle that brought us nowhere: [https://www.coinigy.com/s/i/5b1a649e56531/](https://www.coinigy.com/s/i/5b1a649e56531/)
I cant read that conclusion from your graph... I see consolidation going on, volume declining and most of it is margin volume.
Good spot for a long, stops around 7480.  Nice R/R. 
> What happens when the volume goes to 0?

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DfLD_GAUEAAiqLs.jpg  (stats on volume)

BitMeX should introduce a new gamble product (averaged volume of all exchanges). This would at least give us something more volatile to trade. 
This post feels atypically salty for you, man. 
don't worry, bots will provide another artificial bart and people will fomo like flies to shit
Edit: Deleted post as may come off as dickish.
People need to look at weekly volume averages and see how they change percentage wise with a trend.

Like okay cool it's higher than it was back in 2014, but who gives a shit when 24hr volume dropped by 40-50% from 3 days ago?

Volume confirms trends people
Volume dries up in any market during periods of uncertainty. This market is highly uncertain right now, that is how I take it. 

The spikes are likely market makers taking advantage of thin order books and 'redistributing' funds from minnow gamblers who are over-leveraged.

[deleted]
I keep hearing experts (Peter Brandt, dude from Fundstrat who's not Thomas Lee, etc.) say that the setup is there for a breakout, but it's up to buyers to push higher, and if not....down we go.

So, basically the same "could go up, could go down" nothingburger that any of us could say.
Everyone isn't predicting that...not even remotely close.
My guess is BTC is probably going to crash in the early stages of a crisis, much like gold, and then shoot up like you never seen before, depending on the magnitude of happenings.

If that doesn't happen and it just correlates with the rest of assetts, then I agree with you can pretty much forget about it. Except that I still hold some amount till 0, but whatever. 


Waiting for your detailed comment. Thanks
Did it not already break down the triangle? Or is that a different one you are talking about?

It’s done this before and for much longer too. It will definitely break, when is anyone’s guess 
Uhm it's actually slowly selling off for once instead of mega dumps and Barts, make of that what you will but I think it's only the beginning and it's probably being kept a bit stable because there's so much money flowing out alts. 
Bad for this Room...Traders Room

Oh well... good to have some stability... Let's see where it goes. Something is brewing or not ( Upside or Downside )
Yeah it's possible. But what if they fail to keep up the price? You can't make a market do what you want if it wants to go full bear mode, that's going to absolutely destroy them if it backfires. 
This reminds me of the movie margin call. The firm has huge incentive to make sure the model and their business stays on the right side of the volatility curve.    And they have for the last few years, until it is no longer true. When that will be? Very hard to say if it's this triangle or next. But gdax did raise fee to 0.3 out of thin air so I am not sure if they are making as much as they say nowadays
I hang out at ChartGuys but don't like this narrative at all. Few points:

- This argument can be extended to every single tradable asset in existence
- I'm not so sure of big investments by exchanges. Remember the last few months of 2017? When basically every exchange was going down every couple of days and these threads were flooded with people furious at the exchanges for not scaling. And even now from what I gather BitMEX is often barely working on zero volume. So are they investing in their infrastructure?
- In essence this is just the "whales" argument


Definitely possible. Accumulate 500m+ dollars btc OTC(or be a big miner), get some friends to do the same, each use 100m to take out resistances when the time comes, let the FOMO follow. 

I think the chances of large manipulation like this happening in the future is higher than 50% but who knows.

On walletexplorer you can see that address started getting a lot of coins since March, mostly from Huobi, up to 92k BTC. Note that this doesn't mean he bought all coins in March.. he could previously used another wallet/address. Then on May 30 and June 3 he deposited total of 8k back to Huobi.

Overall I think using blockchain analysis for trading can be very interesting, but I don't think you can make any useful conclusion here.
He just wants to load up on Huobi Tokens
Asian country bans/unbans bitcoin

->

Asian whale loads/unloads bitcoin


Obvious Fud. Why would a whale of this magnitude use spot market to sell, and at these prices? If it accumulated during 2018 most of purchases would have been higher than the current price. 
Don't think that green support line matters here.   Green resistance and red support look useful though.
That's a pretty steep descending wedge, no? Does that matter? I'm not great at this stuff.
>So many members here just trying to catch a falling knife by adding long after long, when we are in this overall long term bear market. 

The overall long term bear market doesn't substantially impact the decisions of a day trader. Trading on smaller timeframes, looking to profit from short term bounces. 
Same goes for short selling... \+1000 shorts added, pushing the price down past 6 hours. I guess it is about who has the most margin nowadays... bears or bulls.
Dont pretend it's not also a gamble to short.
Long term? What the heck are you talking about? It's bearly (haha) been half a year, yet!
I was debating whether or not to enter a little long here for fun.  The above comment convinced me to do it.  Long from 7550 2x.
Out of interest, what do you consider longterm?

I'm guessing less than 1 year because we are up around x3 since this time last year.
I'm assuming one more little leg down clears that up though right? How much lower is needed for it to go away?
What are your current entires so far 
>slowly 

you adapt to the market
Me too, on this one I'm trying the strategy where I put entries based on "if I were already long now, where would my stops be".  All but the last layer on the last diagonal support line we have have now filled.  Heh, of course the barting stopped when I put in a strategy to catch one.

Not sure if I'll exit or not if it busts the last diagonal resistance.

Edit: wait your position is short no?

Edit edit: and there goes the last entry.  It's on now.
We already had a bounce from 6k to 12k and from 6.5k to 10k. We even had a small bounce from 7k to 7.8k just recently. How many bounces do you want?
It's not down since February.  And it's about even from where it was six months ago.  The (higher) bottom is in.  We might go flat for a while, but we're definitely going up this summer. If it were going lower than 7K it would have done it already.
Bitcoin--now with wings!
So it is tied to the moon  . . lol . . the lunar cycle is 29.5 days
Peter's target for failure of IH&S was 7351 which we have not breached.
I am wondering this too. Strange behavior. Prior to 2018 alts would bleed when Bitcoin rose. This year alts gaining has preceded most bitcoin runs. 

People could be selling alts into bitcoin to prepare for a bull run. Or they could be selling to flee the market entirely. Who knows. 
Even if we are in a downtrend, we will still have green days.

This is a trading sub so I think people share their opinions as we can make money both ways.

The media hype pushed the average Joe in to searching for bitcoin, thus increasing the search interest.

Bitcoin hits 10k, bitcoin hits 15k, bitcoin hits 20k. If that is being thrown around by the news its obvious that people will search the term bitcoin. Not necessarily to buy but to see what the hell it is.

I still think that the majority of people don't understand what a bitcoin is and they are misinformed about it, it's like a game of Chinese whispers in which the definition of "bitcoin" changes everytime someone tries to explain it to the next person.

We will go back up, don't know when but we will when it is least expected. 
The universal problem with google trends is that indicates *interest research*. If everybody knows what Bitcoin is, nobody is going to google it. Compare trends with e.g. Tesla which has been flat for a longer time now (ad everybody knows Tesla = electric cars). 

What we have now and what we didn't have before is the readiness to use/buy/sell Bitcoin. There are quite many people who even if they don't buy/invest/trade, know how to use it and know how to buy/sell it.Somebody after all got those millions of accounts at Coinbase in Q4 2017. 
I think it is hard to acknowledge you could be wrong about your strategy. Instead we let emotions take control and add more shorts to prove we are right; "i will show them!". I know professional traders dont fall for this and make their trades based on facts, proper TA and r/R. I dont think we all are professional traders in the BTC market and can switch off emotion \- including myself. Just read the subreddits and is says enough.
It could be because the volume on the most recent pump is relatively low so they think it is only a bull trap.


Note: I am not saying that I believe this, nor am I saying that I don't believe this.
Because its good risk/reward. If we break 7800 you cut it loose or just set your liquidation price to 8k or something, you lose a little. On the other hand, we can potentially break down the triangle from here and that would take us to like 5k at least. Shorts are risking a couple hundred dollars to the upside for a potential $2,000+ to the downside.
No Idea you are talking about??

Yes, I actually thought this week that the whole Austrian school anti central bank thing with bitcoin is rarely talked about any more, even from famous guys like Andreas and nick Szabo. Instead they spend their amount of criticism on other projects if something
For me everything that undermine the state and central banks are good 
Contrarian take: whoever is selling on public exchanges actually wants out and is being smart about it by being aware of liquidity/slippage/etc. Walk the market up slowly, then exit. Rinse, repeat.
This bounces just keep getting more and more anemic. It looks like they're being a little smarter about it, doing it over a period of weeks instead of big bursts, but the effect is not impressive at all. Driving up the price a couple hundred bucks here and there might slow Bitcoin's fall, but it won't stop it, as we've seen since December.
What rise?
There was a 4k ETH dump on BFX in the last 30 minutes. Corn didn't really get affected by it, though.
Might be arbitrage bots or Long capitulating. 4K eth sell on Bitfinex in a minute

Yep, very slow loading. Wasn't sure if was my connection at first but everything else is loading up. 
I’m confused.. youre saying people bought a ton of bitcoin up to 20k so they could sell it.. at these low prices now? That’s what it sounds like to me but I’m sure that’s not what you’re saying cuz that wouldn’t make any sense 
that's not true at all, i have no idea how people honestly think that makes any sense. First of all this "Barts" are mostly due to the market being lead by an exchange which enables high level margin with huge volume , causing huge liquidations , and cascading liquidations, that's why we have Barts so commonly now. 

Secondly the current bear market was due to the bubble pop of unsustainable gains and it was due to a correction, 2014 bear market was due to the main exchange which accounted for 70% of bitcoin volume being hacked in a massive amount  losing clients bitcoins and making everyone lose complete confidence in bitcoin. There’s 2 complete different sentiments from each scenario . 

Humans find patterns everywhere where there is none, there's some really interesting documentaries about this out there feel free to check them out
> People say that this bear market has no similarities to the bear market in 2014.

*Who* says that?
There is no insight here in your post other than "when things go down they go down" that makes the case for the comparison. I see many very substantial differences in structure versus 2014.
At this rate, it's gonna get there in 10 years..
Could we make the same argument but in reverse? About how the dumps have been pathetic and anemic?

Look at it from a broader view. 
I dont get these comments. You may be right eventually, I wont deny that but what is this reasoning of "pathetic bounce"?
We could say the same for the dumps as it had been just as weak and on low volume. What is the difference here that i am not seeing?

In my opinion whole last week was just bunch of noise and we didnt cross any meaningful long term support or resistance since June 2nd. Until we cross 7.4k or 7.8k I dont see how anyone can be overly bearish or bullish. https://www.tradingview.com/x/lTLk2tB8/


Hard to expect short squeeze if price moves to a point from 10h ago. This has to move over 7.8-8 to squeeze anything.
Liquidation only shows $2.2Mil an hour ago that sparked less than $250k of other shorts.

Price movement hasn't moved enough to cause mass liquidations. That number is closer to 7.8

Funny trade area!!

Let's see
Trends are not coming up, they lag the price. Bullrun requires a hype-cycle.

How to get a hype cycle:

Pull in lots of new people who didn't have access before, new exchanges, new countries, new demographics. Maybe people who wouldn't touch it at the top will now load into something with the chart we see today..
Well, if google trends hits those earlier december highs again, you know we need to get out rapidly. So if google trends is a contra\-inidator, I guess it is safe to hodl while trend is low.
Why would you buy Bitcoin anyway? Haven't you said many times that Bitcoin is a doomed project and that BCash is better? Why not put your money where your mouth is and buy BCash instead?
hashrate is trough the roof, so why should i give a crap about Google Searches when the Network gets Stronger by the day? it Added the whole bch Network in Hashrate in 24 hours...
I dont think google trends is a good indicator. because I dont google bitcoin anymore, does that mean Im not interested even though I follow it daily?
You should understand what is a lagging indicator, every crazy bullrun started at some point as a *(weak ass) bull push* 
I dunno about btc, but there are a lot of people on Twitter that will send you 7 eth if you send them .7 eth, apparently. 

In all seriousness, have you tried to withdraw from CB yet? 
I've never had any issue with moving from CB to my bank.
I've withdrawn several times from Coinbase ACH and received it within 24-hours each time. Never tried a wire transfer, so I can't quite comment on that. 

Also, all my btc was initially bought from CB.

hit sell button on your exchange website
I havent seen anything like that. Where are you seeing this?
sell on GDAX, transfer to bank. or link to where they are doing that... 
Buy gold or silver bullion. Lots of online bullion dealers accept BTC. Then sell for cash if you want.
Contrarian trading is not a "decent tip"

Tell that to anyone shorting "the bubble" Nov-Dec or buying "the dip" in Jan. It works if you time it correctly, and if you don't use leverage. It has nothing to do with what all the noise on CNBC or coindesk articles say. If you're trading primarily based off that, you need a new hobby.   

Euphoria or panic tend to drive the market, and buying (to trade) when everyone is panicking only works occasionally. Same goes with selling when everyone is euphoric. 

DCA strategy is obviously different, but this is a trading sub.
> When your being told to buy, that means do opposite. Same thing when your being told to sell. This means buy

This is generally good advice, but if you bought on 6/5 or 6/6, you're going to be just fine and glad you did as long as you didn't over invest and can afford to wait it out.

When I hear Jim Cramer and his brethren start to howl at the moon and tell people to buy Bitcoin, I'll probably sell a chunk. 
What makes you think so?  I mean, I have a position right now. I'm sure lots of other actual people do as well.  It actually looks like mostly organic little retail trades when I watch the trade history scroll by.  But I'm curious to hear why you think it's just wash trading.
the dec jan top was not distribution- it was just a blow-off top. I mean look at the distribution portion right there, it oscillates in a range. we haven't been at any of our peaks for any sort of extended period of time. the only range we really have been in for more than 2 weeks is $9-11.7k and $6-8k
I'm not big on ignoring things on the charts because...they happened (even trimming wicks feels kind of dirty to me).  But what do you think about the theory that the blowoff top was so ridiculous, it can be discounted, and in that case, this ~~pennant~~ triangle would be a continuation of the longer 2017 trend?

Edit: I mean, I guess I understand when fitting a trendline to data points, there are going to be some outliers that aren't part of the larger trend. Maybe that could be the case here.
i could be very wrong on this, gonnna look it up today but i thought symmetrical triangles were 50/50.

either way im ready for up and down
should i just throw the links as im typing? like, instead of the numbers?
i don't think you know what the term "market maker" means. A market maker doesn't buy 15 million $ of BTC for fun as part of their role - they make markets on both sides and provide liquidity, they don't take liquidity.
Makes sense. I'm basically just waiting to see if $7,800 can be taken down or not. 
The market listens to me. 
*Buzz Lightyear meme with scared Woody*

"Barts, Barts everywhere!"
View it as an opportunity to accumulate. I can guarantee when we are back above $10,000, back above $20,000, and especially when we are above $100,000, you will look back and BEG that we had spent more time at these price levels.

People over here cheering for an ETF as soon as possible while I'm over here hoping we don't get one for a few years. Why are we so eager to give up the opportunity at hand?
>>market is becoming even more manipulated

followed by

>>it's been regulated into something

dude you can have it one way or the other, but not both
I don't know. Take a position when it breaks out, not before.
Um, what are we going to talk about until then? 
Down.
I would be hesitant to discount it because it takes the shape of a classic blow off top, which is also seen in the 2 previous examples.

> I don't think any trader at the time thought BTC was worth anything above $10K

I see your point, but whilst I wasn't around during the previous 2 crashes I suspect the sentiment was similar to your quote prior to them bubbling up.
Thanks!
I agree with you but I see it taking about 1.5 times as long. Relatively flat for the next 6 months and then double in 2018 then moon in 2019.
I see your point and it's a valid one.  [You think we're in the yellow circle rather than the orange one](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ld8bZu6c/).

This made zero sense. His point is that if you don't cry like he said because you're sure the situation is the same, then btc is going to 3k now. Pretty far from flat?
Guess he is probably waiting to sell at around 8,500?
Anyone with that amount of coinage can sell OTC with no major issue of slippage.
They wouldn't use exchanges.

Orderbooks are also bullshit. Hidden orders are a thing and just because I don't have a limit buy at $6000 right now doesn't mean I won't buy at $6000.
Happened on BFX too. 
Did you just assume my gender?

Get your pitchforks lads, this nancy’s gonna get a fookin good kickin
The market has the boner, he's just stroking it.
Sounds an awful lot like my priest...
Looks like good calls all around.

Yeah longs are gonna need patience or a strong stomach I think.  I agree that breaking the diagonal support there isn't enough to let go and should probably hold lower.

Was tempted to short the upper area of this formation the other day, but figured it'd only be worth a scalp, and that claiming that would depend on if I was lucky enough to even catch the timing of closing such a scalp. 

My previous 5 positions were SSLLL, all amounting to exactly nothing, so decided to just start scaling into something I could see keeping for perhaps a week or more.  And for that I chose long because I anticipated the macro triangle/pennant being respected for another iteration on this side.  And started scaling in sooner than later to make sure the position was at least big enough to matter before half or so of the orders filled.

No I'm saying that though the increase in shorts hasn't been reflected in the price which is motivational for a long, they also haven't yet started piling on en masse. 

I'm saying the market isn't going down so fast, but don't expect any dildos up.

> ...not nearly as many people are trading now as they were in the past

I question the veracity of this statement.  There are a lot more people trading than there were a year ago.  
I've never seen volume this low before
it could be anything, a lot of time people flash the coins hoping to push people to start buying, and when they don't they start selling
I wouldn't overthink it, just on Bitfinex the daily volume is around 11-20k. It's easy to sell 3k.
I'm drunk
It’s enough for my yacht tho. Works for me 
Scaling in short at the top of a triangle right before a potential break of consolidation in a downtrend is a good setup usually cuz ur risk is low and if it swings back in ur favor you have a lot of cushion if consolidation ends up breaking to the upside later.
Expected response that I could have addressed originally were I more eloquent. I'm speaking of *long term* beliefs. Definitive stances on the legitimacy of cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin skeptics do not believe in the promise of BTC and trade to maximize their fiat. 

Bitcoin believers do, and trade to maximize their BTC holdings.

Burristas have no strong beliefs on the matter. They couldn't give a shit whether BTC thrives or fails. Their philosophies extend no deeper than their bottom line. Maybe that's some of the people here. I hope they go bankrupt. 
This is a *Bitcoin* trading sub with the motto "Sharing ideas to increase your Bitcoin holdings" (or something to that effect), but there are a lot of people on here who only seem interested in their dollar gains.  Those are the ones getting slaughtered.  I'm in a long right now from 7550 with 2x leverage entered just this morning. I will be taking my winnings in Bitcoin.  People trading for dollars don't get it so I kind of sympathize with the MysteriousBarber.
Move sideways? Well isn’t that something new 
I personally think it'd be pretty cool to see sideways movement until we re-encounter the older bull channel, in terms of my confidence in this whole crazy crypto thing.

That would mean about a year of a narrow range.
Thanks. Wrote this between bench press sets. All jacked up on 500mg of Caffeine 
It’s more of 2 resistance lines. The pink line is a line drawn from the BGD, our first retest of support around $7650. The purple is just the 7.8k horizontal resistance. 

I
I'm speaking to jaderaj specifically because hes got a loose trigger finger on deleting things, not you (us)
it is actually, be better for bitcoin without fraud and manipulation all over

exchanges should be happy to comply, wonder why they refused to cooperate when they know they can just get a shiny subpoena 
well longs far outweigh shorts so not sure about that
That seems very plausible to me. And of course after a big move like you described it can cause panic if it drops down a lot or incite fomo if it is a big move up. This second wave of investors following the established trend causes it to become a bigger and bigger movement. Kind of like how last December people were buying purely because the price was going up, and had no concept of fundamentals. Just sheep following the herd; until they all fell off a cliff.
It's a free article. I'm not paying and I see it.
Eventually the big holders that sold may want to buy their coins back. This requires to shake out as many traders as possible. Also one may assume that there are more bagholders than ever now.... 
I think one would be hard pressed to call today's owners dumb money when institutions have not entered the space. The money would only be dumb if one believes institutions will not enter the space at some point in the next few years. I personally think it is an inevitability.
that's not true. I made money when I sold my Bitcoins at $16K. Now, I am back into buying Bitcoin again as I see price going back up to 20K in about 2 years when the next halving occurs.
Just to play devil’s advocate: it’s too short a timeframe to say that those who sold were “smart money”.

If Bitcoin were to beat it’s ATH in the next couple years then selling would have been sub optimal.

Conversely, if bitcoin drops and never recovers it would be seen as a great decision.

Whether they end up as smart or dumb is really just luck. What’s interesting to me from that article is that a lot of long term holders are still holding despite the recent high price.

We're already very high in the cycle while no real progress was made. It can stay high for some time but that's often during strong trends, not in sideways movements. 

It's the same on most of the timeframes.
Hmm, Where are you saying is the start of the pole? 10k or 8.6k?
doesn't downward obv with sideways price mean distribution...?
BitMEX volume on those two dates:

April 26: 3.60B BTC  
June 7: 1.65B BTC  

-54% change

Obviously MEX is full of degenerates and 100x leverage makes that silly, but just as a day over day comparison.

When was that announcement that the US gov't was going to investigate manipulation and corruption on exchanges?

....looks like the news was on April 17th. That could obviously be a huge part of it.
Pretty consistent for most of his posts, he's a sassy Frenchman. 

He does have a point though. I guess you could call it consolidation, but upwards movement really does seem like "life support" instead of legitimate demand

I don't think any of the pushes have been over a span of more than 5 minutes lol. Downward movements happen over hours 
I'm a little annoyed that instead of letting the market run its course, some entity is propping it up artificially by rekting idiot 100x lev chavs maybe.
His central thesis about the mystery of declining volume is crazy misguided from the perspective of any chart analyst.  Also his take on OTC prices already haven breached the bear trend completely neglects the fact that these sources had premiums on the upside as well.
No, that's just not right in this sub.
Right, at the end of the day new money needs to come in otherwise it's just a shell game between traders where the best and well funded traders eat the little ones.  Zero sum game without new money.  The shell game inherently favors bears.
The way I see it is its 40% bagholders wishing for redemption, 40% people waiting for a direction to follow momentum, and 20% big nut people actually trading this. 
I'm talking about the big one that has support at 7.2 and resistance at 9.1 now.
Have no idea what you mean.
Really? I will be overjoyed when BTC trades in a +-3% range all year long because that will be when everyone takes BTC seriously as a world currency. 
That’s dripping with irony I’m assuming
My favorite chart :)
Great. As Always. Thanks
probably the only Posts wich i Read 2 or 3 Times, thanks for your effort to educate the community :)
I've only been doing this for a little more than a year now but, at least on the 15 min chart, I've never seen such a tiny channel held for so long. Like I said, it's almost exactly .05% (or maybe even less) every hour steadily downward. Of course larger channels with bigger ranges last longer but this thing is very small.
Yes, it is slowing selling off, as I said in my comment. But having the price come down slowly in a controlled manner is stable, and that's the point I'm making.
For sure, I agree, huge risk. 

Cannot believe this, but I am going to reference fuckharvey a bit. His arguments that a couple hundred million at the most is propping up the hundreds of billions in 'market cap' in the cryptospace. I wonder how much Coinbase, who had revenue greater than a billion last year, would have to insert to do some real damage on the books. 
Thanks, I'll check out the flick. 
Yes, excellent film that I've watched many times.  
I am not sold on this at all. But, I am bored watching a kids movie, so I'll devils advocate this. Please take with the salt grain.

-Yes, and almost every tradeable asset has been manipulated. Especially those with hype and smaller, less liquid markets.

-Coinbase, Goldman Sachs are acquiring other companies to expand their footprint. No idea the cost, but it is happening. Also, coinbase has  reportedly hired hundreds of new customer service reps, rolles out coinbase pro, an index fund, etc.

-yes, agreed, but there has to be some math involved. If i 'excite the market', the fees for trading ultimately lower my cost basis and increase my value for an IPO.

Whatever, just bored, take it for what its worth.

Yes, it reads he accumulated over a 2 month period and yes nothing  is obvious. Thanks.
Thanks
Well I guess it could be 1 of half dozen different things.
Huobi has an OTC desk. Why the fuck would he move the funds to an exchange for any other reason than to sell? 
~~The article says they bought in March - May last year, lower prices than now, obviously.~~

Edit: Stand corrected, cannot read. You are right.
Yeah, I wouldn't count that wedge either.
Well if it was a falling wedge, it broke out of it 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/iWMnZ40p/
Steepness is pretty normal, I’m just not sure if volume profile fits. 
Do you exclusively day trade or do you hold anything in a cold storage long term? 
Small hidden divergence has been cropping up a lot lately. It's becoming a pattern to find them just barely showing up in charts.
7625, 7575

i got others between 7555 and 7505. What's your sl? I'm thinking lower than 7450 in case we wick kraken style
Isn't that what trading is all about?
i'm short?
This is how I feel about people thinking we'll keep bouncing off the same support line over and over. 

Like how many chances do you need to get out lmao, the market has offered people so many chances to gtfo 
why not 1 more?
Well, it went back to 7372 and we've returned to the breakout point 3 times and the upside target at 8k was not met. If it's a successful reversal it would have met target and made a bullflag for further upside, instead it just fizzled out. 
Sentimentally/anecdotally, I'm seeing mostly flight in the alt communities.
>  If everybody knows what Bitcoin is, nobody is going to google it. Compare trends with e.g. Tesla which has been flat for a longer time now (ad everybody knows Tesla = electric cars). 

The problem with that is that I think people who have already bought/know about bitcoin are still going to use google to find out news about bitcoin.  For example, people who already know about bitcoin, if they are still engaged, will want to know what the current price of bitcoin is so they can buy/sell.  [However, we see that interest in the price of bitcoin is also declining](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%203-m&q=bitcoin%20price).

As for your Tesla analogy, well, this is a pretty bad analogy IMHO, considering that Tesla stock is down quite a bit.

> Somebody after all got those millions of accounts at Coinbase in Q4 2017. 

My concern is that nobody is using those.
> For me everything that undermine the state and central banks are good

Why?
Yeah, I'm sure there's some of that going on. But if you look at the biggest wallets, they're not selling or moving coins.  This is looking pretty manipulative to me.  But it's fine. Whoever it is will sell all their coins sooner or later.

Sellers and buyers both want the best price.
This sideways movement just keeps getting more and more predictable. It looks like they're being a little smarter about it, doing it over a period of months instead of big bursts, but the effect is not impressive at all. Driving the price up and down a couple hundred bucks here and there might stagnant Bitcoin, but it won't stop it from picking a direction, as we've seen since 2009.
We've seen higher lows for five months. If it's a bear market, and not accumulation, then where are the lower lows?
Since 6000 in February or since 0 way back when.  
Yeah wondering if it got absorbed by hidden buy walls
They bought at $200, $2300, $8,000, $17k.

Not $20k. Do you see the chart?
I'm not saying the chart is a perfect mirror pattern as 2014 necessarily.

I'm saying it's the same bear market, where the price goes down down down.

*People*
Perhaps I should rephrase more precisely:

I think anybody who says this bear market is not similar to the bear market in 2014 is wrong.

If you read this sub for about a week you'll find a few mentions of the fact that this is nothing like 2014.

every permabull every single time someone mentions the 2014 bubble
I posted some things I'm seeing in market action that I think are similar. There isn't any insight in your rebuttal you don't give any concrete ideas about the different structure you see.
I give it a week. Basically the same amount of time it took us to get here from 7k
The dumps haven't been anemic up top, the onus is on buyers to reverse near the bottom. Plenty of volume when we dumped off $9k. 

Onus is on buyers for this to explode upwards

if a low volume move takes us near the bottom but there's high volume near the top what does it say about demand near the bottom vs supply at the top? 
It's just noise, the dip yesterday occurred on decreasing volume with the rise occurring on increasing volume, where as, the dip today occurred on increasing volume with the rise occurring on decreasing volume.

There is no set trend, it's just sideways noise
it makes sense when you realize the natural, default direction is down and the onus is on buyers to take this higher. 
So...I'm still holding my 7715 short. Do I close my 7575 long? haha
bro, thats the point. 
I'm not talking about Bitmex. Bitmex might as well be irrelevant in these moves. MM manipulate to liquidate bitmex whales but not in macro scale
Nothing wrong with read-only key, unless you don't want others to see your transactions. But guess the whole idie behind this site is to show off your trades to the public, so no issue there.

You forgot the most important part... Wait a long time.
Oh, I didn't realize this became a hodling sub
Righteo, got it, I should tell everyone asking me about bitcoin not to buy it at all instead of just buying less.  Go go core logic!
He's allowed to prefer one coin and buy both...
It doesn't necessarily mean anything about price but it's a good point regarding dominance. Bitcoin is continuously diverging from other PoW coins in terms of total work. It has 3x the total amount of work done going back to the genesis block than BCash does. The total chain is 3x stronger than BCash after less than a year. Now *that's what I call network effect*.
Hashrate means nothing for price.  It actually depresses the price.
Pretty sure it includes tangentially related searches like "bitcoin etf" "bitcoin SEC" etc

I google bitcoin several times a week. if I stopped being interested in it then it would have an effect because I'd stop looking up things on google about bitcoin

They also started are least months after the bearmarket bottomed.

!RemindMe 5 Months
This happens quite frequently. Coinbase is well known for holding bank withdrawals and deposits hostage for months. I was in this situation too. And the worst thing is that their customer service does not give any shit and respond like once a month on requests.
Op is probably going crazy from the low volume and low volatility.
You might want to measure the duration of previous periods of distribution.
Not to argue but the Wyckoff cycle chart is very general guideline I know. Just throwing out a idea. Thanks.
I used 'usually' and 'should'. Symmetrical triangle often plays a role of trend reversal. We're at the point where we won't know until it breaks. This can really go either way from here.
would you ignore a dump to $2k over the course of a month if we were back to $7k in another month?
They're more continuation than reversal but it's close.
I was using it in colloquial sense to refer to the big players who are currently control the moves of the market but yes, strictly speaking they aren't MMs if they are actively buying / selling
I don't get why it couldn't be, which is why I'm hesitant to go with the crowd on this one...

seems more than a few people have 1k+ btc and could easily pump the price above $7.8k. they're deliberately not doing it for whatever reason
Tell it to pump
I've viewed $20K to $6500 as an opportunity to accumulate. If we go to Goblintown what I accumulated is worth shit. Hard to look at continued loss as an "opportunity".

That said, I was one of the guys who 'almost bought' 1000 bitcoins at $100 each in 2013. Forgot ALL about it until it hit $10K and I FOMO'd in between $10K and $20K in increments.

So I do realize I will be filled with regret not further accumulating at such cheap levels.
Some of us are already all in except the money that institutions make it super hard to invest with bitcoin in.
Regulation just means that the ones doing the manipulating have a license and are risking fines to do so
Of course you can.  Are you that much of a simpleton to think there is only one kind of regulation that regulations everything completely at the exact same time?

There is a difference between making it illegal to sell your friend $5 of bitcoin and regulating exchanges from manipulating the price.  Well, there is a difference to me, but zero difference to you, because to you, it's all identical regulation.
Same as always, we watch the 15 minute charts and allow our fickle sentiment to exaggerate the consequences of every large candle.
You trade alts.
Left.
Ahh yes the classic blow off top the entire equities market is waiting off.

Honestly while I first bought in Dec 2013, I stopped following the reddit and price action sometime in 2014 when I stopped DCA since I figured I was throwing money away into something that was going to zero. 

When people say from that time, about now that "this time is different", believe that. It's apples and oranges. Only similarity is most bubble cycles have similar patterns if you try and fit it into your narrative by looking for repeating and fractal patterns.

In all fairness, like you said, its hard to discount that blowoff top because it happened and it's not an unprecedented move.
Well, it already mooned for me.  I'm looking forward to Mars in 2019-2020.
Would still significantly affect price. 
Sketch out the structure of the market. 

$500 million can be moved OTC without slipping the market? What point does the price move at all? $1 billion? What do you consider a large OTC transaction? What does an average desk consider large? If you upvoted the comment above mine what are your answers/what are you thinking?
Ok fine, you can use the L14dy's bathroom 
well said!
Susan have you been cheating on me?
The market isn't going down.  Hasn't been going down since it hit 6000 in February.  It went down in May but not to where it was in April (6600). 

Expect big spikes up.  Could be today.  Could be next week.  Could be 60 days from now, but this market is going to head upward in a big way soon enough.
Fine then maybe I should have said downward pressure isn’t strong enough and upward pressure isn’t strong enough. That’s what I meant. I think I got my point across anyways. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
I meant more recently. Like compared to a couple months ago. I think that’s why we’re seeing volume dropping to such low levels. There’s still more than last year probably, but less than a few months ago. Which goes along with what he means when he says that the long term uptrend is meeting the short term downtrend. 
You did unless you weren't looking before summer 2017


Thats very true, looking at this situation, I think we have two reasons for low volume; not enough coins to sell are left in the market which can cause substantial downward push in the price; and; the lack of confidence amongst the buyers. I think the second one is easy to do with time compared to the first one.
Yeah the volume is really low. The last time it was this much was three days before the price touched $7,040. That time the coin was trading between $7,200 and $7,450 before briefly touching $7,040 and then taking off soon afterwards.. This is some similarities with that one.
Moreover, why isn't someone really selling $3k if it's that easy? May be they know it's not a good time to sell..
haha indeed  

*clinks glass*
Usually yes, but my view on this is that break of this triangle will be violent. Bband are very tight, volatility is very low, this usually means that move will be sudden and hard. I wouldn't like to be in a short from 8.5 when top of the range is at 9.1 now and breaking it can move the price up 10% in one candle without any significant retrace.

Triangle is continuation pattern, but sometimes it plays as reversal pattern. We're in last 1/4 of the formation. There is not much room for bouncing within.

/Morpheus: What if I told you Jared has a loose trigger finger because I’m always reporting off topic posts. 

Edit: And for the record, your post is fine, I just found it humorous that you felt the need to let us know. 
Because complying costs time and money.  I, too, would only comply if forced.  
It depends on how you define "good". Bitcoin was never meant to be tamed by governments.
And maybe there have been some less than upstanding practices that will see the light of day?
>  wonder why they refused to cooperate when they know they can just get a shiny subpoena 

Probably because they know that the majority of their customers are libertarian minded and would frown upon them willingly handing over data to the government without being forced to do so.
think he's joking
> Just sheep following the herd; until they all fell off a cliff.

Very much so. Also when you throw in fake outs and violent reactions at the other end of a large movement it just feeds into it's self creating even more violent movements. 


I get a paywall too. Wanna copy paste some text?
>This requires to shake out as many traders as possible.

Or just passively letting the price fall as a result of nobody putting in the <$14million daily required to maintain the price due to miners selling newly minted coins.
Agreed. People that bought at $20 and sold at $1000 probably felt like smart money back at $200. But if they didn't buy back...

The trouble is....until an asset is completely dead/defunct, hindsight analysis much be taken with a grain of salt. 
Damn, very nice to read. Thanks!
Don't really know, never pay much attention to the length of the pole. 
Yes, this is it.

MM's managed to sell thousands of BTCs while propping up the price. 
Which is why I don't understand where bulls think all this money is  going to come from
My nuts are huge. Can confirm 
Ahh, alright then.
I saw 7.2 and thought "yay movement" and checked a chart, but no it was still a flat line
Yeah everyone that isn't going to use it anyway will start taking it seriously meanwhile the real users that were drawn to bitcoin for the excitement and moon (or profitable gloom) potential will be gone (this includes hodlers and traders). Nah keep it crazy.
There is for sure much less 'real' money in the space than mcaps indicate, but to claim that it's only a 'couple hundred million' is retarded. Mike Novogratz alone took out a 'couple hundred million' back in summer, for god's sake. 
These are all valid observations
[removed]
Yes, but I actually think he had previous wallets because the first 45k BTC was sent all on March 25 from 7 different wallets. These wallets got their coins between November and March. And it could be argued that even some wallets before that (like [afbf34ae5e]) are from him too which had transactions in September 2017 already.

Basically it's easy to make conclusions with blockchain analysis that aren't 100% correct.

The theory that it's a OTC buyer from Huobi (that IMO already started last year) seems reasonable though.
Huobi just listed Monero, maybe they want the funds to be private ;)
That amount will crash the price. Why the fuck sell at a lower price, even at loss?
Maybe he has no intention to sell and it's just a fake-out move to get people wondering/distracted . . if so, it's working. Or again, maybe it's nothing at all.
Fyi it says “first half of 2018” ... “between Mar and May”.

Just in case this fact is essential to your decisions :)
Indeed.  That sort of potential movement is why I thought that only its resistance line was interesting.

For the alleged wedge's support line, the red one was the one that was going to affect things IMO, so wedge or not, it was/is the one to watch.
>Do you exclusively day trade or do you hold anything in a cold storage long term? 

I have a large cold storage stash of Bitcoin, but it's all hedged at the moment. 
I changed my orders around. Added at $7583.

Have adds now at $7554, $7529.

I was going to bail under the larger triangle support ( red), but I think I’ll give it a chance to defend $8450 and move my stops to about $7425-$7435. I would rather risk a few extra dollars then get stopped out prematurely

you are buying just a bit below a major support line is broken? 
Looks like you just cleared up that last position on https://www.anotherbot.info/history.php?user=trk- then, it was still live when I posted.
As in fleeing alts into bitcoin? Or fleeing alts altogether. 
Well because they in a illegitimate way try to dictate what I can do or not and prohibits voluntary transactions with other grown up humans
> Sellers and buyers both want the best price.

Why is the best price higher than we are now?

(note: Not sure if you have me as permabear, but I'm really long-term bullish on BTC. I just don't think it currently deserves the price it has, and that fundamental environment changes have to occur--primarily tax-related--before BTC can shine. I'm acquiring more through trading in hopes of that eventuality. I'm not convinced enough to commit additional fiat at this stage.)
These comments just keep getting more and more predictable. It looks like they're being a little smarter about it, doing it over a series of posts rather than big bursts, but the effect is not impressive at all. Upvoting and downvoting a couple times here might stagnant the conversation, but it won't stop the series of cascading comments once BTC picks a direction, as we've seen since 2009
this sums up TA for me in 3 Posts. one of them will be right and tell that TA works:)
We've seen lower highs for five months. If it's a bull market, and not distribution, where are the higher highs?
People in this thread.

People who are longing dips.

People who are longing tops.
 But they said it's a deflationary asset with a limited supply and that the price would go up endlessly?
When did you open a long?
What exchange then
But not all my trading data. Sharing to much info let others take over your account. The less I share the better.

But I don't need to show off. People believe in my trades, if they don't I don't care.
That was in general. I don't know you so I wouldn't. We have a position bot here, so this will be the second site.

Not saying your idea is bad, I'm saying I don't like the way it's done and I use another one.

But like I said, I don't really care about guys who brag about their positions. Few traders here have enough reputation and followers that we don't need them to confirm their entries, those traders probably wouldn't even think about adding those keys.
You should probably just try being more intellectually consistent. Also less covert shilling would be great.
Why would someone buy an asset they're certain is going to fail? Seems hypocritical for such staunch BCash shills to hedge their bets with the coin that they're constantly deriding.

But did you eventually get your money? I can withdraw and deposit always within 24-48 hours and have never had issues. Done probably over 50 withdrawals and deposits altogether.
Naw just from being right!
The volume doesn't look that low to me.  A lot of big trades are happening. The trade history seems to click by at a rate that looks normal. I suspect the numbers are being fudged down for some reason.  Volatility is not even that low either.  We're trading in a range from 7100 to 7700 for the past week or so -- that's a ~10 percent swing in a week.  In the stock market that would not qualify as low volatility.
Yup sure, don't care still think that's what's going on because you guys who think it's breaking out Def aren't buying
no worries I am no Wyckoff pro but I just would hardly call it distribution even though it was in the most literal sense of the word 
Oh no, I get what you're saying.  I was just curious if people are entertaining that idea here because I've heard it kicked around other places.  (That it would still be technically a continuation - if you choose to ignore the top)
My inclination is to say no....but I guess the difference in our actual scenario is the question of whether to discount something in favor of the larger trend.  Depending on when you want to say that bull run started, you easily have a 60+ week trend in play...do you let a 5 week trend define what happens next?  

I know, it sounds kinda stupid to me too...then I look at a picture, and sometimes I think, "ehhh, maybe not totally crazy"
https://imgur.com/a/NCj5ILr
The % of continuation vs reversal on symmetrical triangle is so small that I think we shouldn't even consider 20k as fake out here. If this breaks either way he'll be both right and wrong.
Yeah seriously though, we're closer to $7,800 than $7,200 and every dump is being bought into.

You leaning towards a breakout past $7,800?
I don't get it either, what's with this resistance when sellers could just let the price come to them at 8.2 or something? Maybe there's competition for distribution idk. Everything looks weird atm. Which isn't bullish in the slightest in my book, bullruns aren't shady.
When I think about those who have a lot to gain by a bull run I wonder what the plan is.  I guess it would be interesting to figure out how much you would need to spark a sustainable bull run.  I bet it isn't as much as you might think.

He says he will, he's just slow and old and it may take a while. 
> If we go to Goblintown what I accumulated is worth shit. Hard to look at continued loss as an "opportunity".

Why? One bitcoin will be worth $1m+ one day, I guarantee it. What does it matter if it hits $10 before then? Just hodl and don't trade on leverage.

>That said, I was one of the guys who 'almost bought' 1000 bitcoins at $100 each in 2013. Forgot ALL about it until it hit $10K and I FOMO'd in between $10K and $20K in increments.

Yeah you are far from alone. I would wager most of this subreddit consists of people who primarily got interested during the 2017 bull run or shortly after. I cannot tell you how much I dread the days of the people who only get interested at $50k+ taking over this subreddit.

The market is a tool for transferring wealth from the impatient to the patient. Be patient. Find other short term goals to focus on in the meantime, and they don't have to be financial. 
I'm about as all in as I can get as well. I get up each day hoping to earn more to be able to invest. 
wat
it's certainly not illegal to sell your friend or anyone else $5 in bitcoin, but somehow I'm the simpleton here, golly gee what a world
Why don't I give me half the money I would 'invest', we'll go out back, you kick me in the nuts and we'll call it a day?
Right
No doubt, but he was referencing the order books like they were going to market sell on the exchange, which is absurd.
lol... there’s no apostrophe. You are using my username as an adjective. If you had dropped “the” it would have been correct due to the possessive nature of it being *my* bathroom.

It’s “ladies bathroom”, not [lady’s bathroom](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=lady%E2%80%99s+bathroom).

But since you wrote “the”, there’s no apostrophe.

the lady’s bathroom or the family’s bathroom would work, since you are specifying which lady or which family, but using my username, you cannot actually do so...

TL;DR: You have a grammar mistake in your comeback
Is it cheating if the priest really...really..forcibly insists?

They could, they just sell in chunks over time. That's what I'm referring to.

Another misunderstanding. I respect Anti-BTC bears. Though we fundamentally disagree, they're willing to stand by a controversial opinion and defend it rigorously. Hamilton's endorsement of Jefferson over Burr follows similar reasoning, hence the name-drops.
Sounds like a recipe for a bench press bar to the face

*death by bitcoin*
Can't tell if serious.  (I actually believe it though, but seriously are you joking?)
well people say theres no manipulation but then they seem to get upset when people ask to see the transaction data to prove it.

hmmm
> Probably because they know that the majority of their customers are libertarian minded

Yeah sure...
His joke doesn't even make sense because CME already tamed the bitcoin markets. 
I just got paywalled.  
One of the points is that long term investors cashed out 30bn of bitcoin to speculators, which now hold almost the same number of coins as long term holders. But the whales are much fewer than the speculators, i.e., the concentration of power is still on their side. And the article suggests that there is a lot of manipulation in the market.
Good point.

It’s kind of a paradox for me. In your example: selling a speculative, immature, not-yet-even-a proper asset at 50x profit is extremely “smart”, yet being “dumb” and holding would have made much more profit.

I can’t decide if this historical fact is positive or negative :)
Lucky your gf doesn't either...

wha wha whaaaaa

sorry, I need coffee
Start at 8.6k seems to be more reasonable, imo
I really want to sell my holdings to buy lower but damn I’m scared that the market will decide to turn around randomly. 


I think I’ll just wait for the support line from the 6k, 6.5k, 7k bounces to break convincingly.
You really need to learn how to read...

EDIT: yeah, bad joke, you're right that I wrote it badly.
Wait, what? The hodlers and early adopters liked BTC because they hated fiat. Why would they suddenly disappear when BTC actually becomes what they want it to become? Also, people still trade dollars, euro, yen, etc., so people will still trade BTC. In fact, I think it is the traders that keep the markets stable.
I *think* fuckharvey may have been talking non-OTC liquidity, and I imagine Mike didn't throw down a couple hundred million on ETH on an exchange
Step 1: Short on BitMex with 25X leverage. 

Step 2: Dump coins crashing the price.

Step 3: Close short and claim profits.

Easy money.
They don't have to sell it all at once, but the fact that they moved it to an exchange means they intend to sell it.
8000 coins would not crash the price. It would send it down a couple hundred bucks for a few hours.
What are your current positions? 
how again do you hedge your BTC in cold storage?
i have it at 7492 on stamp

https://www.tradingview.com/x/7Rxl9hjW/
yep i went to check, i forgot to close this (very bad) position the other day. thanks for the reminder :) I will update it when the DCA is done
For the alt holders, just getting out of the alt its self, just leaving the project behind or going to sidelines.

I'm unsure how many of them are hedging it into btc, or are tethering up, or are cashing out for real.

But there's a lot of people who hate the alt they used to love.  (again, it's just the sentiment of the loud people, and there's fud etc too so...)

You don't think that's unreasonably idealistic? Do you really not see how the government is the only way to enforce a societal structure? You can fantasize all you want about 'voluntary' societies but the concept breaks down immediately once you consider enforcement of rights and laws. How exactly is this accomplished without a judiciary? Oh right, An-Caps think that people will naturally submit to the same private arbiter of justice. And if not...? There's also the issue about what framework the these 3rd party arbitrators or mediators are supposed to use to make decisions. What are rights and laws without a codified document with overreaching jurisdiction?

Libertarian / An-Cap spam is one step below /r/im14andthisisdeep. Governments arise naturally in societies for good reason. We need a government of some sort and the focus should be making the government work as efficiently and fairly as possible. 
> Why is the best price higher than we are now?

It's not if you're a buyer.  For me, the best price is 7100.  That's where my next buy is set.  Bitcoin is the only investment I've ever made where I often find myself hoping for the price to come down but that's because I'm mainly a DCA buyer and hodler.  I wasn't buying or selling for several months when we were running up last year. Not buying because I felt I already had enough at those prices, not selling because I felt it could go higher, and I've sold with big gains in the past only to regret it later. 

I've been buying little bits here and there since February and have managed to catch some dips.  ~~I'm only down on one buy this year, at 9150 a few weeks ago~~ [just looked at my trade history -- I'm actually down on two, both small].  Even those will turn very green at some point.
Well if you see TA as a prediction tool then I can understand your contempt. But it is a reaction tool, it doesn't predict anything.
You both make good points. And that's prob why the market seems to be locked in around $7500
I don't give a fuck what X market it is, but I'll play ping pong on the blatant ranges.
[deleted]
We've seen higher highs the last three years, in a long enough timeline...everyone is right.
Agreed, the debate at this point is accumulation vs distribution. There's no clear market direction.
I'd say it's neither a bull nor bear market right now.  But the bottom does appear to be in.  That bottom keeps getting higher.  

Higher highs tend to trail higher lows. The next run up should start to reverse the "lower highs" pattern.  10K would be a higher high at this point, and if you've been in this market for a while, you know a 30 percent rise can happen damn fast.
I think people forget the price doesn't go up because it's deflationary...it goes up because people want it. The deflationary aspect just makes people want it more. 

and then you have the downward pressure from miners 

When people stop wanting it at high prices, it goes down. People here think $7.6k is a low price because they've tasted $20k...but new entrants are very likely not going to see $7.6k as a steal.
I put in some limit buys from 7620-7515 after your post yesterday (about opening both and holding until the market decides).
bitfinex
You can not take over an account with an read-only API key - impossible. Anyway, I like to keep most trades to myself which is the smartest thing to do imo.

He's said before he knows it's going to perform well or at least that it will be the most consistent or something like that
I personally had an issue with deposit back at the start of December. Wanted to buy some cheap ETH and my deposit arrived only 3 weeks later (was not that cheap anymore). But you can search over the internet there are dozens of complaints about money being trapped on Coinbase.
You don't pay attention to volume then 
I'm not trying to be mean, I mean to be honest I would probably be going crazy if I was day trading right now.
We had this problem with linear trend resistance. So many people believed they draw it right that it actually played out. Self fulfilling prophecy is something you should always consider. I never heard that someone is counting 20k as a wick above triangle, it's not right technically. But if enough people will believe... That's a different story.
unfortunately blow-off tops are pretty integral to future price action- they're indicative of a top in terms of hype and actual price movements. that's why I'm so skeptical we're just gonna suddenly rev the engines and get all the hype back. 

the public forgets but it doesn't forget in 6 months
No but I mean I'm trying to realize that it wouldn't take much to prove me wrong. Like I said, it's clear there are more than a few players with 1k+ worth of btc in fiat sitting ready to go. 

If they wanna take it above $7.8k, they will. If they don't, they won't.

Looks like the people with 1-20 btc are selling but the big buys come in and prop it up to make it go sideways/down for another 12-18 hours. 

Getting pretty annoying tbh
That's what I'm thinking- it's the only thing that really makes sense, that people are distributing and it's basically a competition of who can distribute first. 

The intensity with which the dips were being bought up was pretty insane at first, but last night it started to sag quite a bit until that massive pump came in and saved the day.

It was 1.2k shorts closing too...Are shorts really that pathetic? They can't handle a $100 move up so 1200 of them close? lol
> Why? One bitcoin will be worth $1m+ one day, I guarantee it. 

lololol

Is that you John?
> Why? One bitcoin will be worth $1m+ one day, I guarantee it. What does it matter if it hits $10 before then? Just hodl and don't trade on leverage.

Let's remove the $1m amount and replace with "a bunch more than it is now." 

It matters a lot so that if I own 1 bitcoin today but could sell and buy 100 in 12 months, well, that would matter a shit ton to me. 
> it's certainly not illegal to sell your friend or anyone else $5 in bitcoin,

Wrong. 
Yeah, that sounds about right.

Bad bot 
I'm rolling around on the ground in tears. Need to call you today M8.
You were probably asking for it with your look
So are they selling any chunks as we speak?
And just after having the first death by crypto recently with that ASKfm promo on Everest.
Oh I never use it anyway so I'm safe
I am sure this is what the FUD articles will say...
It's because the majority of those trading Bitcoin never report taxes.
nah btc tamed itself. CME futures volume is tiny. it's like saying kraken tamed the market or something
Yes, as an engineer and somewhat early adopter what draw me to bitcoin was the clever tech and my disdain (not actual hate) to fiat but that isn't enough to make me sink 6 figures in it, I could still play with the tech buying just $200 bucks. Venezuelans or people that actually need the tech aren't the ones pushing bitcoin to this heights, but rather middle class 1st world guys that can afford to sink 6 figures in this shit and do so because of the potential ROI. This is what makes headlines and drives the bitcoin craze, people ask you about price not asymmetric cryptography when they know you work in this field, without that bitcoin will be just some clever mostly useless technical curiosity for most non tech people in 1st world countries.

Dollar, Yen, etc have real use cases people around the world buy milk and pay taxes with them, without it's crazy price I'm not saying bitcoin will disappear but its trading volume will be nothing compared to what it is today.
I'm so bored I am actually hoping Harvey comes back to call me stupid. 
Easier said than done. 
Or to buy other coins. 
https://www.anotherbot.info/ Been scaling into a long on September over the last couple days.  (I registered it on the bot after getting 3 orders filled, and the final 3 orders have filled today) 

Just above break even now.

Decided to do something more long term (days? weeks? months?) and hold something in the red for awhile, rather than this game of scalping breakouts and setting stoplosses to break even.


>how again do you hedge your BTC in cold storage?

Open an equivalent short position. 
This long could just as well turn out to be a very bad position too ;)

Daily stoch rsi is overbought from the last creep up,  though all lower timeframes are oversold.
This is sort of what I was anticipating. I had invested in NEO and felt really strongly it was a good investment. 

But the lack of updates from the team, increasing disinterest from the community, and lack of price movement sort of told me it was running out of steam. 

I think what we’re about to see is the Alt bubble pop further, but bitcoin is going to rise from the destruction. Eventually alts will boom again, but not until bitcoin starts to settle a bit. 
Libertarian != Anarchist.
basically that the need  to have this discussion in crypto forums was a bit my point, 5 years ago it was somehow implicit  everyone was against central banking, inflation tax and so on. 

But since you don't agree with me anyway I think we should not waste time writing wall of texts here :D       
Oh, found the guy who gets it.
Strongest comment of the thread.
That's why many of us are basically waiting until one of those trends breaks, because the ensuing price movement once the pattern is invalidated should be significant. In the mean time, we swing trade the range at low/moderate leverage. 
Maybe a poll is due, accumulation or distribution?
I'd never go so far as to say something isn't possible or that I definitively rule something out. I think BTC experienced a blow-off top / speculative bubble off of frenzy and greed that went parabolic. We are correcting off of that, and I think we belong back in the upward/bull channel from before the run-up.

Something like this: https://www.tradingview.com/x/jmvZJzfE/

Obviously I'm not betting the farm that happens. If a *significant* major event occurs (proper tax classification in US/JP/EU) and further improvements to on-ramps and UIs for the average user, we could go parabolic again *and rightfully so*. 
Your bias is clearly showing. Maybe mine is as well. We haven't had a higher high in months (nor have we had a lower low). You think we deserve to break upwards. I think downwards. The market will demonstrate. 

edit: a 30% fall can happen damn fast too. Volatility is king in crypto. If we get to 10K, then game on, because that would make a higher high and break the daily pennant resistance. We got to 9950 and dumped, so I'm not sure why we'd break it on another rise without an environmental change. 
So you got lucky on that drop, nice.

My both ways action is more like starting point for something bigger. I think we're too close to a break to effectively trade this and I gamble on bull run before sep futs close.

I want to double on 7.8 break to ~25x, then add somewhere around mid 8 to 50x and go on 100x with 1% of stack on 9k break then add to 2.5% when we break 10k.
You can't, right, but if you can get my balance and trade history you can try take over my account by social engineering and this isn't as impossible as you think.
You don't show it on your site, but as owner of the web site you have access to that key, which means you can read all those information.

It's no point in arguing here about the idea. I just don't like the api key part. And we already have a site that people used to, so it may be hard to switch.

Personally I'm just not interested.
[You sure?](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8mnaib/daily_discussion_monday_may_28_2018/dzp6bse/?context=3)
You are aware how many people use coinbase? And dozens of complains do not even notice as a rounding error?
Man, I've been in this market since way before December.  This volume is not low, and I think the reported numbers are not accurate.  Need to figure out how to capture the trade history so I can verify this.

Does anyone know an API that provides a complete trade history for any exchange?  I can't find one.
This is why ive basically said fuck this and shorthedged at the time we broke the ath downtrend and went full 3x short at around 9700 iirc so my average is low 9s and i dont see the point of exiting until we break 8.5k unless we hit the 4-5k number and if we do i expect we may actually see a massive stop cascade and liquidations if we fall into the the 4.2-4.4k area(assuming 5k doesnt hold) i think if 4.4 breaks then calls as low 1.3k become a possibility just from people wanting out above breakeven to reevaluate. 

Now LTHs may start to think 'what if that actually was the top for 5-10 years and i wanna lock in some of those 2010-2015 gains which are still enormous even if we retrace 98%. 98% retrace would leave the price at about 3x the low of the last bear market. Granted thats unlikely except maybe on mex..... but thats still insanely high when you put it into perspective. 

My roi for my first btc purchased (which i had 50 left from a price point of about $1.50 last year and bought all the way during the bear of 2013-2015 from 740 down to 150 taking out loans on the halvenings and another when we broke the 2013 ath around $1.4k(all paid off).

10k was totally my moon and i know theres always room for growth but seriously guys how much more does this thing have to go up in the short term. We found the high price point was making the barrier to entry higher and higher due to fees and other things that need to be improved before btc is ready to go full mainstream. It also needs to purge the cryptoscene of all the bullshit. 

We just went more than 100x from bottom to top in like 3 years. Not sure why this growth is so sustainable in a tech thats still an experiment and has a relative liquidity issues because its still low market cap.

Im thinking more and more than we're going to see a bear market worse than 2013 but maybe slightly shorter. But this is more intuition than based on any TA or FA. I see the bullish case as very weak at the moment and the money waiting on the sidelines is patient. People who do this for a living probably dont have an issue waiting on confirmation of a trend reversal or at least a low that takes into account that btc should probably have topped at 10k and anything above was pure mania.
I didn't think you were being mean. I just think you are like the rest of the buyers who want others to do the heavy lifting to take the price higher 
Yeah.  Nothing about ignoring the top sounded Technically correct.  I was just curious if there was any sort of precedent or tribal charting knowledge that would say otherwise.  
Yeah, I hear ya.  I'm pretty skeptical as well, especially with the diminishing volume.  But I guess that kind of fits the profile for this kind of triangle, no? 
What is more annoying, the thing that we can't break up or that all the doors are bought up like crazy?

This behaves like ascending triangle...
Good point, you would think those guys/girls would've bought already if they really wanted this thing to go higher. 

I feel ya though man, been sitting on my hands for over a week now. 


You sound like a sassy frenchman.
Noob question (sorry): what is meant with “distribution” when trading?
Why wait? I can sell 1 BTC for 1m today! Who wants it? :-D
It's guaranteed guys! Bears pack it up and go home! 
I got the same response about $10k. It's literally only a matter of time. 
Think about how many people became millionaires from buying 2013-2015. Then think about how many people entered the space in 2017. Like what, 10x? 100x as many people? I know like 5 people in my life in the crypto space. If they all buy now I'm going to know 5 people who went from middle class nobodies to bitcoin millionaires? 

we really think it's feasible the the world is going to have 1 bitcoin millionaire for every, what, 1000 people? Lol

Everyone who can put in at least $20k before $20k is going to be a millionaire some day? 

Some people here are wild man 
You cant take advantage of every opportunity. Did you multiply your Bitcoin holdings by 10x by putting it all on the Patriots moneyline when they were down 17 in the 4th quarter of the superbowl? Probably not. Do you lose much sleep regretting that? Do you lose much sleep waiting for the next time that happens?

Take advantage of the opportunity at hand, not the theoretical ones. 
> It matters a lot so that if I own 1 bitcoin today but could sell and buy 100 in 12 months, well, that would matter a shit ton to me.

If you think that's likely, then sell.  I can tell you that I've sold thinking it was going to go down and kicked myself hard for doing it.  On the other hand, I've never regretted buying, at least over time.  Hilarious now to think that I fretted for months over having bought at $300. 
K lol. great rebuttal 
Hit me up!
you're right... it was 27 years ago and I was only 8. 

Damn my tiny waist and small hands!
You can't know which individuals are making which orders, unless you're the exchange.
Personally, I would rather die climbing Everest then die trying to be like Chad in the gym. 
I was just joking, because IIRC CME said they would tame the markets, but now it's just Barts as far as the eye can see. (And as you pointed out, their volume is tiny).
Wait for price to be low and testing support. Place a limit sell to enter a short just above that price to make sure your short is filled and suppress the price.

With you r short ready and price still testing support, a dump would be most effective as it would probably trigger stop losses and conditional sell orders that trigger if the price drops bellow support.

Of course, there could also be a bigger whale with hidden buy orders around support that would prevent price from dropping and you would end up with a huge underwater short.

All in all i still believe it is more probable to succeed than to fail, if you have enough coins to move the market 
that still means he's selling the BTC.
I see this in a lot of places.

It is like a party hang over.
I didn't say they were, but there is crossover.
> basically that the need to have this discussion in crypto forums was a bit my point, 5 years ago it was somehow implicit everyone was against central banking, inflation tax and so on.

I was going to say the same thing. 5 years ago Bitcoin was saturated with An Caps and it was annoying af. 
All you can do. For me that only works so long cuz eventually I get stuck holding at the top.
I'm curious as to what you think a proper tax classification would be.  It seems fair to me in the U.S.  It's a capital asset and taxed accordingly.  How would you tax it differently?
We've had three higher lows -- 6K in February, 6.6K in April and 7.1K recently. 

I don't think we "deserve" to break upwards, I just think we will because that's how the math has always worked out in Bitcoin (I don't know about the rest of crypto and don't really care.  The only other coins I hold are LTC and Dash).  It's a limited supply, and even with extremely small demand, it's worth $7500 right now according to the market.  If it didn't die in 2014, it's never dying, and what we're seeing this year is NOTHING compared to that.
> Your bias is clearly showing. Maybe mine is as well. 

Google trends shows that interest in bitcoin is declining in the short run.  If price is based on supply and demand, then obviously, it looks like bitcoin's price is going to keep going down in the short term.

My 7515 add didn't hit, so at this stage, I'm still net long, barely. I'm 2x short  with 50% from 7515 (so basically fiat), and I'm 2x long with 33%. They would have been equal positions from 7715 and 7540 if the last had hit.

I didn't realize you were long on sept. That's pretty aggressive, but not really with that stack percentage. 
I'm not disputing your claim, but I'm genuinely curious how this would assist in social engineering

I never said that every single transaction is unsuccessful. But you can see that people are waiting for over half a year for amounts 10k, 50k usd to arrive. People have to pay taxes but they can't because profits they have to pay back are held hostage. If you think that waiting for customer service to reply about your money for over a month is a rounding error then I have nothing else to say. I was sending 6 emails to them and got an answer only a month after.

Also, did you ever try to call their customer service phone and wait less than 30 mins in a queue? Sorry for rant.
The reported numbers aren't accurate? LOL wut?
The volume profile fits. That's why it looks like tension is building. More and more people on sidelines until they'll FOMO in one direction.
lol both. It's annoying that it's taking this long when buyers seem so darn sure that it's going to go up. If they're so sure, why not just blow past resistance?

it's not like anyone's accumulating, volume is piss poor.

Also, it would look like an ascending triangle with another tap of $7700+ but the target is like...$300-400 haha. I'd guess we'll get rejected from $8k after a bunch of shorts are squeezed/liquidated
my best friend is french and we get along very well :D she's taught me a lot 
Distribution refers to someone (or a large group of people) with a lot of an asset distributing that asset amongst other people. 

Accumulation refers to someone (or a large group of people) with a lot of money accumulating that asset *from* other people.

Distribution generally implies that stronger hands are getting out of the market and waiting for lower prices to re-enter (or never).

Accumulation implies that stronger hands are entering the market because they expect an imminent bull run/upwards movement. 
Call John! Tell him his dating life isn't over!
Unless BTC is AOL and not Apple. 

Your level of certainty is silly.
well not many people are putting in $20k right, most people I know who getting into the space these days buying like 0.1-0.2 btc...
there are over 36 millionaires in the world currently. they own half the worlds wealth, roughly. there are not enough bitcoins for every millionaire to own one. 1mm per btc calls presumably include drastic inflation devaluing of the fiat, specifically the dollar. it is literally possible. likely? Hell no. but possible. bitcoin isn’t distributed evenly, if bitcoin goes to a million there is no way it creates 21 million individual millionaires. 

the real question to ask is what would a million dollars get you when bitcoin is worth a million? my guess is a lot less than what it would get you today 
Ha! The over/under was extremely high in that game. But the Pat's traditionally start slow in every SB (had not scored in the 1st qtr in any). So rather than take the over before the game, I took the over after the 1st quarter at 10pts less. Oh and I bet them at +490 down 17 and I crushed that Super Bowl. 

I remember last spring at $2700 before it fell to about $1800 and someone in here saying it was going to happen. I said, whatever, I am holding for the long hall. Thinking back now, if I could have sold at $2500 and re-bought at $2000, I would have made more $$ last year. Managing your opportunities/risks and not blindly holding anything, no matter what it is, is good investing. 

But good luck, I hope your $1m is right. 
I don't think that, but I don't like it when people put forth ridiculous arguments or say that you should never try to accumulate more bitcoin by managing risk. 
2+2 does not equal 5 either.
jesus christ
Yeah mate, what I am trying to say is that selling volume is pathetic, while on the other hand, there is a lot of potential buying power. There seems to be only one element missing which is enough confidence..
I would too in general... but not for a fucking marketing stunt for a manipulative fad like in this case, after being used as a corporate shill husk of a human to get some jackass executive rich.
Can't ever tell lol, some people here still think futures fucked the market up. they fail to understand how a blow off top occurs and the role that expectations play in it 
But buying alt/BTC pairs?
You seemed via your comment to be under the impression that libertarians advocate for no government when in fact they advocate for limited government. This limited government would enforce rights and laws. Your comment seems to have nothing to do with actual libertatianism and is just one giant conflation of anarchism (no government) with libertarianism (limited government).
At least we agree on the historical facts :D that was what brought me in
That's the problem we currently have, and (IMO) the biggest barrier to BTC adoption. There isn't a current asset class that fits it. The SEC has no idea how to classify it. Right now it's classified as property, but doesn't qualify for like-kind exchange. As a capital asset, there are short-term / long-term capital gains rates in play as well. If I want to buy an alt with no fiat pair, I have to buy BTC with USD and then the alt with BTC. Whatever price fluctuation occurred during that process in BTC is a taxable event. 

What if I already hold BTC, and some of it is over a year old and some is less, and I spend some? LIFO or FIFO for tax purposes? If I want to sell 1 BTC and I have 10 ranging from $1K to $10K purchase points, which one and I selling? FIFO for the lower cap gains rate? What if I sell some into fiat, but I also want to buy an alt so I buy BTC to sell into that alt? How can I claim one transaction was FIFO and one was LIFO?

The tax environment is a disaster, and there's no easy answer. France has come up with the closest to a reasonable approach to taxation, IMO. 
Given that the supply is still increasing (mining), the upwards-sloping supply curve is constantly slipping to the right along the downwards-sloping demand curve. If demand were completely flat, we'd just see slowly dropping prices. If demand is dropping, it should compound the dropping effect.

If the environment shifts further in favor of crypto, primarily in regards to tax/usage, we should see demand increase. As the average joe's ability to enter the market improves through legit trading platforms/user interfaces, we'll see further demand increase. When the halving occurs, the supply increase rate will drop. If all of these things happen in tandem, it's parabolic city.

But we're a ways off from that for now.
Unless demand comes from those who don't Google for access. 
I just don't want to trade this until this breaks, it may end up with a sudden move either way and I won't be able to trade the break (or Mex shits) so if rather have something small here than scalp $100 range. Or just add every time it bounces ;-)

You know Chewy did a successful 100x run last year with small % of his stack? 
By calling helpdesk of the company and saying 'my 2fa broke down, can't get to my account and my e-mail, help'.

If you know every detail of the account there is a strong possibility you can force take-over.

You know that a lot of Kevin Mitnick's hack were not by his programming skills but by his social engineering skills? He used info that he could get. Yeah, times were different then and procedures are different now, but when you have enough information you go from 'almost impossible' to 'very hard but not impossible'.
> Interested enough to debate it though.

TBH just trying to help and show other point of view. Just pointing out that I like the idea itself as I use position bot, but as you're a bit too late you can have problem with getting traction here.
Yeah, but the number is pathetically low comapred to the millions of transfersh appening and people are veryi nclined to forget details like not providing requested KLM information.
He maybe looking at btcwisdom which doesnt seem to give you all the info(correctly). Maybe?
I really think it might be fudged down. 

Think about it.  
Still this is putting Target above 8k and it should be enough.

I agree, is like all the big players are waiting for something...
French sex best sex
Thanks! 
Online service provider.... consumer electronics manufacturer.... alright I'll just ignore that silly comparison. Just go with the old myspace vs facebook comparison next time. It's better and it actually makes sense.

Keep an eye out for the Apple of your analogy I guess is the takeaway. You can remain informed and invested accordingly without losing the ability to be patient. I haven't seen anything promising yet. 
most people here are trading with like $10-20k I think actually. I think the average owner owns like 1 btc or smth, just guessing. It's not a whole lot to put into a financial investment
For sure. I don’t advise blindly holding btw. Stay informed and make best decisions you can. If you think you have an edge over the market, trade that advantage! My advice is patience and not using leverage. 
He didn't help me. Although I see the irony 
Every bitcoin bought is also a bitcoin sold, so if you want to sell X amount of bitcoin, the volume/time is the metric to look at in order to sell sell in chunks.

I agree with your market sentiment. And I don't think any news pieces could increase confidence, because the lack of confidence is due to the newcomer wave being over and the market letting off steam.
He sells the btc for the alt. The alt seller might cash out btc for usd(t)
I didn't mean to equate to two, only the spam that comes out of both. Largely referring to the stuff that makes its way on to /r/EnoughLibertarianSpam. Low-effort, low intelligence "fuck the gov't" stuff.
> Given that the supply is still increasing (mining), the upwards-sloping supply curve is constantly slipping to the right along the downwards-sloping demand curve.

On this point, I have two things to say.  The first is that I have heard that some miners do not sell all their bitcoins immediately, in part to keep prices inflated.  The possibility of artificial supply restrictions could explain some of what we are seeing.  

The second thing is that, well, we **are** seeing slowly dropping prices.  You said it yourself, we haven't seen a higher high in months.  And while it's true that we haven't seen lower lows, the lack of higher highs is the more telling indicator because we're not seeing the same level of public interest as we were in 2017.

> If all of these things happen in tandem, it's parabolic city.  But we're a ways off from that for now.

This is basically my analysis as well.  But I'm still astonished to see people on this sub thinking the next bull run is just around the corner or that we're out of the bear market because we haven't gone below 7000.
Dush did a 100x last night from $7639 to $7575 :D

it's on position bot too lol
Haha I did not know that, that's pretty cool. I thought my 13x short was crazy. Grated, that was 100% of stack by the time I moved it to 13x. Maybe that was crazy....
Ah, that makes sense. Thanks! 
[deleted]
well from $7700 it'd barely be $8k. and since $7950-$8000 is strong resistance I don't think it will really happen
Yeah the comparisons to tech companies are retarded. Bitcoin being the myspace/aol of the crypto world is a positive, due to the network effect, recognition, security and immutability
Fair enough, good luck.
There are more than 1 reasons for lack of confidence. I think it can only come back by the willingness of traders to trade in conditions they perceive as favorable for them.
You and I are basically in agreement. I would agree that 100% of miners are not selling 100% of their coins, but I would suspect *most* miners have to sell *most* of their coins to be profitable. 

To me, logically/rationally/economically this market seems much more propped than it does suppressed. I like its chances in the long run, but there is zero legitimate reason that BTC should be worth anywhere close to what it *RIGHT NOW* that isn't predicated on "because it may be worth more later." That's a valid reason to speculate on it, but the certainty we're seeing from some people that the bottom is in or that even that it *will* succeed in the long run is unnerving. 
Well, I'm not counting YOLO with small stack and fast close, chewy did like 3.8k to 5.5k on 100x, he went 50% of BTC price on 100x...
It's all about how you handle it. Scaling up into 100x with 2.5% is better than going 2.5x right now and you can trade the swings on low lev.

If you didn't go 100% 13x in one order then it's not crazy ;-)
It's not like he couldn't come up with the idea himself. We were talking with /u/l14dy about something similar months ago, it just wasn't about the positions itself but about points for good r/r, but doesn't really matter, it's not like he's making money out of it, he came up with the idea, people said they like it and then he developed it, not the other way around.
We're in the woods until we break this big triangle.
Speaking of profitability, the hash rate has been steadily incrasing. It's currently at 37.6 TH/s which is about 2.5 times what it was in January. https://blockchain.info/charts/hash-rate

It's getting considerably more difficult to mine bitcoin, and these miners have to pay for these fancy gpus somehow. Either the price has to go up or they turn off the computers and the hash rate falls. 
Hah yea wasn't comparing! Just thought it was fun
I think I opened 3x at 8450ish and very quickly added while babysitting. I got up to 10x by the time 8100 fell, and 8115 was my last add. I think my final average was like 8310 and I had stops at 8305. I moved to 13x to free up margin to scalp 25x shorts on swaps, which I did from 8000-7400. It was an insane run of account growth.

I'm now back to my 3x ways :P
Yeah. I have 0 faith in sellers, -10 faith in buyers, lol. 

The failure to break $10k after hitting $9990 was pretty sad. 
Well, GPU prices are dropping at the same time, but aren't most BTC miners on ASIC?
L14DY used to go on 100x all the time on bull run.

I'd like to do what Chevy did, set a small margin high lev trade and catch the 50% bull run on it.
Good time, place and some balls. I had numerous occasions to do that but didn't have balls to pull off some moves, I'm preparing for next one ;-) Every time I catched nice move I did something to do f*ck it up. Not this time :-D
Yup, I'm getting tired of this range, too risky to trade big and now even scalping is risky. Want some profits already :-P
Yeah you're right they use ASICs. But I still think the argument stands and is why I don't think we're going to see another month of this sideways movement like some people are calling for based on TA.
