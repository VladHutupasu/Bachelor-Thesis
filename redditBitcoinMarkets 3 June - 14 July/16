[Daily Discussion] Friday, June 29, 2018 -- TITLE
#New post: [\[Daily Discussion\] Saturday, June 30, 2018 →](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8uzb6w/daily_discussion_saturday_june_30_2018/)
Closing my short from around $6,640 at $5,870 for a nice gain. 

I'll elaborate later, but there's some strong bullish RSI divergence that we might see play out over the next few days on the 12h and 1d.
I promised I'd elaborate on my decision to exit my short, so here we go.

First and foremost, I'm watching the former log resistance line from the $20K high to the $11,700 high after the bounce off $6,000 a few months back:

As I've pointed out in the past, there were two strong possibilities for the breakout above that resistance line:

1. The market would make a mad dash back above $11,700 and challenge the previous ATH at $20K again. 
2. The market would continue to decline and hug that resistance line as support for the next few months ([similar to what we saw in 2014-2015](https://imgur.com/a/zFUxj))

Well, it's certainly starting to look like we're going to be seeing option 2 instead of option 1. 

Which is great from an accumulation standpoint, but I'm sure a bit defeating for many of you from a "but I want to be rich now!" standpoint. 

So, that's my longer-term outlook. 

The medium-term outlook isn't super rosy either. 

The market broke down from a fairly massive bear flag (or arguably an even more massive bull flag, depending on how you look at it) when this consolidation triangle broke down earlier in June:

https://imgur.com/a/n8IvP47

The "by the books" target for a triangle breakdown is to subtract the width of the triangle at it's widest point from the breakdown point. In this case that would be about $11,700 - $6,000, which comes to $5,700. 

Using the breakdown point of $7,000 that puts the target at around $1,300. 

Sounds crazy, but it's just math and not something that's really worth arguing/speculating about so far away from the target. But I wouldn't write it off as impossible at this stage. 

So, why on earth would I exit my short when there's so much to be bearish about from a technical perspective?

Well, there's some short-term hopium to be had in the form of RSI divergence on the 12h and 1d:

https://imgur.com/a/Hc4uMDC

Price has consisently been making lower lows over the past few weeks, but RSI has consistently been making higher lows on the 12h and 1d. 

It's absolutely possible that the market will ignore the divergence and continue to drop lower, but there's not a whole lot to be gained by staying in a short assuming the market will do the unexpected. 

Instead, I'll hop into another short a bit lower (sub $5,500 probably) if the market does surprise me. Or reshort higher if the market does what I think it will (hopefully as high as $6,800 or even $7,200).
Tether flaw was fud after all

Good job coinbase pro, you managed to make the charts even worse. Almost as useless as bittrex on mobile now.
Small win, and this could go anywhere but let's enjoy it for now. Congrats to the teflon-handed longs who are no longer underwater, and big ups to the wily bears who had the prescience to close their shorts or even *gasp* go long.

I remain, an underwaterman.
Fuck it.

10x long, 0.5 BTC in margin every 100 bucks down all the way to 5k.

Pray for me
It's times like this where it's hard for me to step away even to do laundry. Guess I just live in these Hanes now
LOL. Sometimes when I’m at the gym and it’s squat or deadlift day, I tell myself if I can just push through, finish my sets, and make a personal record, Bitcoin will instantly BGD. It hasnt yet worked, until today. I finished my workout 15 minutes ago.
At this rate we'll hit ATH by tuesday.
Point and Figure https://i.imgur.com/khnkTKi.png  We have confirmed a new column of 7 O's.  We have been moving sideways for the last 12 columns with only 1 long columns.  That is fairly unusual, usually bitcoin doesn't have so many short columns in sequence.  Often we will get a very large move after such short columns.

A pullback to $4,499 would complete unresolved long pole dating back about 9 months ago and is our next likely long-term target.  

Short term, we have a recent unresolved long pole of 16 O's from 6/10, a move above 7,040 would resolve 50&#37; of the pole.  I was thinking our bull div on the daily from several days ago would bring us to this short term target, but it hasn't happened yet.  Fun fact, we have had 168 long poles in the last 9 months and every single one of the 168 long poles have had 50% resolution except this one from 6/10. 1.5 year of PnF here: https://i.imgur.com/AuSFbNz.png

Daily close at lower low has invalidated our bull div on RSI daily chart.  https://www.tradingview.com/x/kllGtGIl/ 
 So if you bought on the bull div, where to close the long?  I have a strong sense that many traders are waiting for some sort of decent movement up that they can potentially short (that's me at least).  Downside potential is still large and there is no guarantee we'll get that short entry we want.  That doesn't mean we should open new shorts here, but closing a long here to prevent further loss is reasonable.  And there are a LOT more longs than shorts showing on finex right now.

A 2-part bull div could form if we get a green candle today*.  https://www.tradingview.com/x/kllGtGIl/  Yes I realize I just said that our bull div was invalidated at today's daily close.  But tomorrow's another day, and like most bull div invalidation there is a chance for a 2-part bull div to occur if the downward momentum does not continue.  There is 20 hours for this to confirm, so take it with a grain of salt, but keep it in mind when you look at today's close.

Lets do something (just for) fun we do sometimes (tldr; it likely doesn't work) and look at google trends: [https://i.imgur.com/Tkd2p1y.png](https://i.imgur.com/Tkd2p1y.png) If we apply trend analysis to our google trend, we see that we are in a clear downward trend on the daily chart (scrolling back to Q1 2018 reveals the downward trend since 2/6).  Lower lows and lower highs are being made.  However, around June 11 we made a higher high and June 17 possibly a higher low.  If we break the higher high from June 11, this would put our google searches in an upward trend and would be bullish.  Until then, we are maintaining a downward trend that has lasted since 2/6 (on 2/6 we had a single day where it looked like trend was changing to upward and then failed 4 days later).  Does this sort of trend analysis on google trends work? Probably not! 😂

*edit: annndd its red 😂
Yesterday i posted saying that i was expecting a pretty violent and impulsive move soon. Still waiting tbh. The Stoch RSI on 12hr looks like a juicy pimple waiting to be popped and it doesnt really have that much room to go down https://www.tradingview.com/x/tCEAzaDP/

Short term: I think we're due a bounce, the sell volume on the dumps is dropping off, bull divs across the board and depending on how this week closes, it will be the 4th red week in a row inside a longer 8-9 week downtrend. Think it was the other way round, if we were 4 weeks green in 8-9 week uptrend, would you really long it?

Mid term: assuming we do get a bounce, i think 76xx-78xx will be the crucial zone. it wouldnt surprise me if we get rejected there and come back down. that being said, i dont think we'd drop below 45xx.

What im doing: holding my BTC long, looking to add between 58xx and 55xx with stops around 54xx. Whilst i wait for btc to sort itself out, im looking for potential short-medium term alt opportunities.

Assuming we go up: take some profit on my long around 67xx and a bit harder on alts if we break through, retest and bounce up. Take more profits (both btc and alts) around 76xx-78xx and close all longs if we get rejected. If we break through, retest and dont fall through it then ill be more inclined to go long again, if not then short.

Assuming we go down: stops on my long at around 54xx and long fishing 49xx-47xx with stops around 46xx-45xx in case I was completely wrong.

Best accidental long of my life.

Shoutout my eyeballs 

Edit: Broke through the 10k resistance line:

Zoomed in: https://www.tradingview.com/x/7kqZA602/

##Bullish
Over 2k in shorts closed on that candle, most likely all of those large shorts that opened below 6k. Rekt.
Me, like 11 hours ago, reading chewtoys short close. You know, we are pretty overextended, I could see a small bounce here and a 2-4% scalp. Holiday weekend and all in the states, sneaky whales. Maybe I'll put in some orders before I sign off of work.

Me, 6 hours ago (no positions entered). I cut out of work early, pick up a new lease, grab the kids, go to dinner & movie (incredible's 2, not as good as the first). 

Me 30 min ago, open up my phone and see a $600 price move from when I signed off? Oh bitcoin, you cruel lady. But u/_chewtoy_  wow man, nice call.

Edit: WTF Coinbase? GDAX had low volume but was easy on the eyes. What am I looking at right now, truly awful.
Can I just say that the Coinbase Pro looks like it was designed to make people confused.
A lot of people calling this pump ‘artificial’ but isn’t it possible that in an environment where we have hit a new low and opportunity is at a high relative to the past six months someone / some people are simply capitalising on an opportunity to buy when everyone else is fearful?

This could easily be misinterpreted as manipulation. I’m not saying it’s a fact, just a thought and an alternative perspective 
Looking forward to the bear market of 2022.
We broke convincingly out of the descending wedge leading back to June 9th ($7600-$7700), with volume confirmation. If we can continue moving up from here, I'm expecting significant horizontal resistance showing up around $6800 leading back to June 11th. If that manages to break, I see us re-testing the log support line we broke down from on the big pennant everyone had on the daily around $7500.

Personally, I doubt this plays out quite yet though, considering this second pump was from shorts closing, and it seems enough consolidation hasn't happened here for a reversal to happen quite yet.
[deleted]
Haven't posted in a bit... been busy... I've been watching the charts intermittently and have been shorting this since the pennant broke. 

This is the first time since the pennant broke that I'm weary of continuing to short (at least in the immediate term).  [Looking at the 4hr, selling is becoming slightly more shallow and we're currently testing $5.8k support and hugging the bottom of the BB's.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/b1namkff/)  One of the things not often mentioned here in the comments is the support line from ATH.  To date, no bear market has breached this line to the downside. 

Those calling for sub $5k prices in the coming days would need to ignore this trend (line currently at $5.4k) and [ignore the fact that volatility is less than half of what it was near the peak.](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/volatility-index/)   Of course, it's possible this is the first time we breach this line, but I have my reservations.  The selloff from $10k has lasted 8 weeks. In 2014, the two most persistent selloffs lasted 11 and 9 weeks respectively.

I don't think we've found a bottom.. but I'm beginning to think we're setting the stage for a small relief rally.  Price may move to mid $5's and find support at 11/2017 low.  Alternately, we may continue sideways for another week or two and build more foot room to drop down lower.  

Right now I'm out of trade... I've made enough shorting this and not trying to be greedy.  I'll be waiting for a clear sign of a relief rally/reversal and will build a long from there.  Hoping for a textbook capitulation to $4.9k range (likely mid July), but may not get so lucky. 

Safe trades.

Isn't this just another bear flag?
Fuck this. Whenever I buy saying it probably won't go below this it dumps like crazy, but when I don't buy saying it will probably hit 55xx, it FUCKIN PAMPS. FUUUUUUUUUU

People in office are getting gloomy about bitcoin and crypto.
I just did a textbook double-take looking at the price indicator on my browser tab like a got-damned cartoon character.
Closed short (5860), went long (5870). Second consecutive bull div on the 12 hr chart.

Quick chart: https://www.tradingview.com/i/m2n47Mlj/

As per my last post, I closed my long when I decided the bull div on the daily invalidated/never truly materialized. I did mention we could close as low as around here and still form the daily bull div, which *will* confirm if **this** is the local low. Will do the same on this one and close if it's looking like we make a lower low, we're only on the second 12 hr candle post the low and both have been dojiish so not super confident in the div. Part of it's a gut call.

Edit hopium bonus chart: https://imgur.com/a/QbsREG5 double bottom on OBV with a much lower low in price - marking essentially same type of sentiment as a bull divergence. I say hopium because it's sketchy at best and not confirmed with other indicators.
Opened a long here. 33% of stack 5X @ 5890

Will add until $5700 then bail under.

Yesterday I called a [**BSD**](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ug7w8/comment/e1h1ve1?st=JJ04RY71&sh=91adce76)  and it seems to be playing out.

Let’s see what happens

>My maximum pain scenario would be sideways for years, low volatility, with the occasional bart.

*Wouldn't that just be a barrel of fun ey.*
Stops triggered on my heavy reshort from 6100, and with that, I'm out of the market for a weekend getaway unless I do some absolute degenerate trading off a perfect short or long entry. I may have gotten bullfudded here but I've been having more success taking profits and locking in solid stack gains. Risk management applies to exiting disciplined too. Happy goblin town everyone

Edit: happy with how that turned out
Accidentally added 33% to my long at @6192. Guess I’ll just hold it.

Went to put a limit order in and i accidentally market ordered because I wasn’t wearing glasses 

Could be the best or worst mistake of my BTC trading career. I’ve done this twice now :) 

Is what it is. Good luck bulls
What in the fuck is this price action.
[Remember it's only organic if its dumping](https://i.imgur.com/aMA4yR0.png)
No one talking about the 500 BTC market buy and the four other 200 BTC market buys on BFX a half hour ago? I know it's very anecdotal, but I haven't seen market buys like that in a while. 

Edit: In the last hour from right now: 1,804 BTC Market Buys to 211 BTC Market Sells
constant comparisons to the Dot Com bust.  which was orders of magnitudes larger.  How come nobody mentions this?  In today's dollars the dot com bust would probably be over 10 trillion and Bitcoin only hit 330 billion.  What am i missing here?

u/_chewtoy_ has become a self fulfilling prophecy, chewie came back after some time and we have a BGD 
Well the daily closed above $6200. Not sure what that means
https://www.tradingview.com/x/zQZp7POi/ Here is our 2 part bull div on daily RSI + bull div on macd, confirmed an hour ago.
Well this is goodbye. I lost 35k. Half of my money so it’s time to give it up. Im young it’s just gonna go to stocks so I’ll get rich the old long way. Good luck. Make safe trades 
Now someone tell me big players weren't suppressing the price until futures expired.  I wonder what way they've bet on for the next settlement....
Just a musing I had while reading all the doom and gloom in here today. Has anyone in here had any experience of crashes and 'bear markets' outside of trading bitcoin? I just returned home after three years working in Saudi Arabia, and Aberdeen before that. Working for an engineering company, we really felt the pinch and saw the real effects that a price crash like the oil crash can have on people, not only financially but in terms of job loss, house loss, businesses shutting down, the whole kaboodle. Our office in Saudi went from close to 7000 people, to just over 1000 over my time there, with people getting laid off weekly if not daily  


From my perspective, this whole crash just doesn't seem that bad in the grand scale of things, maybe because it's all going on online, maybe because I never had that much in Bitcoin (bought in around 2015 with a small amount of cash).  


Just interested to hear how others compare bitcoin crash to other crashes.

Everyone closing their shorts, even some of the better traders on this sub. That always makes me second guess my decisions. Time after time if you traded against the majority of this sub you would have been in some profit.

Short from $6205; $6231, $5936, $5889. 

Breaking below 6k a second time is extremely bearish considering the lack of rally we got from the bounce off $6750/Tether pump. Yet I expected more of s violent  drop when we breached 6k but buyers are still relentless.

Puzzled on what to do here

Edit: Closed shorts and out of position. Will re-evaluate in a little bit. Looking to short at either the Blue or Red line

The RSI on the 15m/30m on that was monstrous. Momentum wise that was less of a BGD, more like one of those dildos with the suction pads on them that stick after being *fucking launched.*
2,100+ comments in this thread on a friday?! That must be some kind of recent record...!?
So we are at a lot of "trading don't work" sentiment posts today, fud levels rising in other words. Just need some more sold it all posts on ethtrader and cc then we're done for this move 
I feel like we are so close to the bottom that I don’t care either way and don’t want to miss the rebound up.  I’ve lost a lot of money trying to make risky trades at the feet or the head instead of just making safe trades at the knees and shoulders.  The gains from here will be massive.  It’s enough.
Sorry guys. Had to sell a little today. My income is mainly bitcoin and I cover this by drawing it down and converting to fiat in 6 month increments. 

My next planned draw down is August (my last was Oct/Nov but held off by selling some forks etc) and couldn’t risk any further decline to not impact long term cold storage. The slow bleed has been painful. 

Difficult decision but to that end I chose to cover myself from now until Jan 2020 by which time the halving will be in focus and significantly more infrastructure will be in place. Drastic but provides me a lot of peace.  

Lets see what comes. A little pee’d because I had made some good margins (paper :/) on OMG\BTC but got greedy and was waiting for the COS airdrop when I should have sold at +$24 on the Binance pump. Got out a few weeks ago but missed my exit by a million miles. That in itself cost me 6 months. I should have listened to my wife, don’t tell her I said that :)

I had a plan A and didn’t stick to it so had to put plan B into action. I got greedy. A lesson I needed to learn but hoped I wouldn’t have to. Just like the PnF charts, you can’t skip over a lesson. Everything has its retrace. 

Thankfully, still fully in the game and as excited for Bitcoin as ever. Hot wallet depleted but cold storage not affected. 






Almost capitulated yesterday, decided to yolo all in at 5984 for 51 btc. Sometimes things turn out ok.
The funny part is that whatever happens from here will seem extremely obvious in hindsight. 

I'm still underwater from $6,600 with 1.5x lev and I've been panic buying anything under $5,900 and adding to cold storage.

Stay safe out there dudes.
Fuck where is u/crypto_chad69 I need someone sane in this thread
CME BTC futures expire today. In about 40 mins if I'm not mistaken.

Do you expect an effect on the price?
Has anyone ever just copied Chewtoy's trades word for word and tried to just make money off of him?  Wish I had shorted nine days ago at $6640...
It seems I’m following the crowd here, but I’ve been tracking price action all morning, and it’s encouraging to see shorts slowly climb while alts are showing signs of recovery, and sub-$5.8k prices getting quickly bought up since I have that as a long-term support level going back to Nov to 2018. I could see this getting as low as ~$5.6k with the current wedge forming, and will likely add if it goes down there. I wish futures were trading at more of a discount, and I’m still not feeling super bullish right now, but I guess I’ll take what I can get.

I still see a long-term bottom between $3.8k-$4.2k unless conditions change significantly, but I just can’t bring myself to leverage short again until we get some sort of relief rally, so I’m trying to scalp some longs on the way down. Unfortunately, I’m sure that’s how a lot of traders feel about now.

!long xbtu18 5880 5x 20%
Closed September futures at $6286. This could have room to go further up, but I got the profits I was looking for on my long from $5880. What a pump!

!long xbtu18 close $6286.
Interesting -- this leg up shows margin shorts closing, but the original leg up earlier showed margin longs opening. [https://www.tradingview.com/x/2Zz7INYM/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/2Zz7INYM/)
Someone on Finex is heavily cash-buying into shortsellers' asks, any wall is taken down within minutes. Haven't seen [that](https://imgur.com/a/A9lHFRU) on the trades ticker for quite a while now. Whales starting to fight like this might indicate an upcoming movement.

Since price hit 5,900 again about 24 hours ago, [longs are up 500 BTC and shorts are up 3,600 BTC](https://www.tradingview.com/x/5TKJuJ2s/). Quarterlies show some [optimism](https://www.tradingview.com/x/iS62cIPw/) for the first time since the breakdown of the meme triangle. We had a bull div on the daily and now the first attempt to double bottom after dropping through the former lows since 10k without much opposition. MACDs from the 1d down to the 2h are all *slightly* in the red, there's a possibility to flip all at once and make things look bullish for humans and bots alike.

Let's see if this day closes as a green doji and which direction the next candle takes. Not calling a bottom yet by any means, but I feel *some* of my bearishness peeling away today.
I continue to be impressed by the traders on this sub. Nearly everyone closed out their short or opened a long this morning
Short $1mm @ $6420. Expecting a small dip in the near term based primarily on the speed of this sudden rise, volume, and historical Bitcoin market behavior.

Also, I allowed a $6mm hedge to expire on June futs last night @ $5861. Just re opened it in September futs @ $6355 avg for a total profit of 8.4%, or $504k. 
Interdesting, whales are pulling of the same stunt they did a few days ago. Lets see if this pump from 5770ish is a bait.

EDIT: This pump doesnt look good. 
I started scaling into a long yesterday and was waiting a bit to close my short but might as well now. Reasons like others started pointing out:

Daily bullish divs https://www.tradingview.com/x/NnDf21G3/
12H https://www.tradingview.com/x/Pk8qg0CF/

Pretty alarming number of shorts keep opening on the dumps

!short xbtusd close 5880

Edit: fucked up the closing value


Price drop was probably a futures dump 
September futures are now trading at a premium to perps on Bitmex. I am officially baffled by the price action here. I know people keep saying Bitmex traders are clueless, but I haven’t seen this type of action at this low of a price all year. Not sure if it means we have more room to go down or what, but it certainly seems odd.
Regarding the recent Bloomberg Tether article, a few thoughts:

* As someone else mentioned, they do not discuss the order book at the time (which is half the picture). Large walls close to $1 could explain why large trades are absorbed (into the wall) while smaller trades move the price $0.001.
* The Kraken USD/USDT market is quite small in relation to the bigger picture of overall USDT volume and market cap. It's a weird place to wash trade or try to influence things. It's also risky (let's say you wanted to tank the ratio to foment FUD...there could be whales and/or arbitraging traders waiting for opportunities that will jump in to bring the ratio back up and leave you holding bags). Doesn't seem worth it, to me.
* The specific trade amounts are definitely a sign, though to me not necessarily a red flag per se. While I think it likely they are from one entity, I don't necessarily buy that it is something nefarious like wash trading. Another equally likely explanation is that two or more counterparties that don't trust each other are using Kraken as an intermediary. This would go something like this: "On [date] at [time] I want to sell [large amount] of Tether in 13,076.389 lots. I'll be placing those lots at $0.999 and refilling them up to [large amount]." This way, both parties get what they want (buying/selling Tether for USD at a set price) without having the risk of the other party prematurely running away with the funds, because both parties' funds are in Kraken's custody and only change hands in the market in a controlled fashion.
The volume is strange in the past hours on Bitfinex. 
I'm seeing the reaction low, test of middle bands and lower low without piercing the bottom band. Now if we go over \~US6300,  thats a "w" bolinger band reversal. Also noteworthy RSI is higher for the second low and it would create a bullish engulfing candle as well at \~US6300. see here: [http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart\_school:technical\_indicators:bollinger\_bands](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:bollinger_bands)

Edit: Bitstamp 1-day chart
more consolidation in the 6.0-6.3k zone and then a big move with the 12h bbands closing. if we go up now we would go straight into the hardly declning upper 12h bbands and such moves mostly get rejected on such time frames. scalp zone again. 6.15k - 6.25k
Lower creek jumped, major creek at 6700-6900
Is that a bear thing to try and make people sell by providing meaningless predictions with absolutely no reasons? I know we have moon bois but it look much worse when someone just trashing all over Bitcoin just to get more people to sell for his position. Taking advantage of market sentiment is one thing, trashing Bitcoin fundamentals and enjoying pain is just low

Goodbye GDAX. Hello coinbase pro.

Glad to see BCH at the bottom of the dropdown. Feels right.
If this daily can not be seen as capitulation then I don’t know what can.

This is my first bear market cycle so it’s hard to see how things can turn bullish from here which I guess puts me in the same camp. 

Until this point I’ve been entirely bullish the whole way down give or take but this does look like a grinding downward drive that won’t quit.

On the flip side I’ve been around long enough to know how fickle this market is and how a few days to a week people can get all Jeckle and Hyde. 

Fascinating to see what comes next 
Jesus fucking christ I leave for 2 hours and come back and its like death in here. I thought for sure we dipped to low 5ks but we're still at where we were a few days ago are you fucking kidding me. 
Ladies and Gentlemen, we at BTC Moon Tours Unlimited would like to thank you for joining us on our brief adventure sub-6K today.  We hope
you took advantage of some of the fantastic prices offered by the natives.  For those of you who were hoping to catch a glimpse of Goblin Town, we do sympathize with your disappointment, but no refunds will be given.

For the diminutive gentleman in the cute bear costume who ordered the large green robotic phallus: your order has shipped. We advise you to read the warning label and instructions before attempting to use as abuse of this device may result in permanent rectal damage.

Once again, we at BTC Moon Tours Unlimited thank you for your busines and look forward to seeing many of you on the upcoming Mars excursion.
I’m going to go out on a limb here and call this price action nothing but a short squeeze inside of [a bear flag](https://www.tradingview.com/x/dTsVet9i/) on the daily. Come at me bulls...

Edit: [here it is](https://www.tradingview.com/x/6BVFmtMq/) on the 4hr for more clarity
ya know I thought a while back that new lows would cause people who've not panicked yet to start panicking- but the overwhelmingly "Btc is dead" sentiment here is kind of confusing me.

Did you guys really not prepare for this? Like, if you're despairing now vs a few months ago...why? Did you really just not believe it could ever go below $6k?

genuinely wondering if these are sentiment bots or something o_O we're like 5% below where we were a few days ago and some people are doing the "I'm such a fool, why didn't I listen" type comments.

I really thought it would take a bit longer to get here...

Yes, it's very difficult to *not* get more bearish towards the bottom, but guys, try your best to keep your emotions in check. These are the moments where you need to stay in control of your emotions and not panic. Not saying this is the bottom, but panicking and being emotional is exactly how you sell the bottom/get rekt and buy the top of the bounce. 

Formulate a plan and stick to it- I don't like seeing anyone here get blindsided and spiral into depression cause of it!

I told people to not get euphoric at $10k now I'm saying don't get too depressed down here! This game is all about emotions and staying objective. Come on guys, chin up! You are in control of your investments/trades! 
Told some of my local boys that 5900 we saw earlier today was probably a good buy...

Right now my phone is blowing up... they think I'm some kind of wizard LOL.
last year was buy the dip.  this year is short the pump. wish i knew that last year though...
What's do you all think about the volume on the daily chart (other than it being ridiculously low ;)) ?

I wanna see a slight increase in volume in the past two weeks or so... [https://www.tradingview.com/x/vMA53Jeh/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/vMA53Jeh/)

This very slight volume increase has obviously come with increased selling pressure. But volume increase feels like a small positive sign should the market turn around somewhere between 3-6k.
Bart flag on 1h...
Looking at the [daily bands](https://www.tradingview.com/x/8Bj4lGdv) were due for more consolidation before continuing the trend. Anyways there is a great chance of a small pump a couple of hundred USDs up to shakethe short tree
How far would you guys say we need to run before we start thinking "rally or reversal possible"? 6400 to get the bollinger moving average?
impressive this whole action a few mintues before the daily closes to get an daily engulfing.

Got greedy with a good short from earlier in the week and stopped out before I could close it. No loss, but gave up a 6% gain just like that. Learning everyday, sometimes the hard way.

Good time to buy? Or will it dip back under 6k?
I'm not bullish at present, and I see us falling to 5, 4 or 3k before any sort of momentum follows up. I need to do some exploration of VRSI (which is still dumping hard) later on, but suffice to say it's not great right now.

[https://www.moonmath.win/](https://www.moonmath.win/) was everyone's favourite moon chart when we were mooning, and now we barely see any discussion about it. Despite the fact that said chart was telling us all along that there was plenty of room to move down to where we are now.

With the wankest of overlays/image quality (because replicating the moon chart would be bare effort) and chucking on pink lines for 5k/4k/3k/2k you get this: [https://i.imgur.com/BubOonY.png](https://i.imgur.com/BubOonY.png)

My dashed lines are just meant as a hypothetical bounce around our downwards channel trend, but you get the idea. We could go as long as 4.5k if Moon Math is correct, but lower would invalidate the concept (which is entirely possible).

I don't know, I'm just throwing it out there. I feel like a break of 5k would really set into motion capitulation, but that it would fail to dip harder despite the selling (which could be slow as fuck if 2014 is anything to show for itself) seems like an interesting idea to me.

Anyway, welcome to goblin town  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
Kindly resume the dip.

I feel a twing of fomo brewing already.. jesus christ. 

It's almost as if long term, 'money' will be engineered.
Describe the 2018 Crypto market in one word. Go!
Double bottom at $5775.  I guess that means the bear market is over.  

$10K by next week and then new ATH and then moon.

Could this be the accumulation phase from whales and crypto hedge funds? Sentiment is really bad right now. Most people are assuming a price of $4500 for BTC soon. Yet, the prices are kind of stuck around 6k.
100&#37; not buying this! just becuase of principle. I would just feel like an idiot making some market makers rich.

 fuck it another >1month out of major position, glad I could close my short in time
https://www.tradingview.com/x/0fJHgH9s/

This is my rationale for going long here. I don't expect anything different from the accumulation pattern in early April

I don't think this is the final bottom but whales are probably gearing up(accumulating) for a good dead cat bounce.
 (Plus, everyone is bearish af)

If my conjecture is right, we will spend many hours in 5800~5900 range where whales accumulate.

I'm tempted to go all-in here but I will accept the possibility of being entirely wrong here.


So where'd all the sh*t talking permabears go? :)

We've broken out of the downtrend that started in May: https://imgur.com/6kw1bql
Weekly RSI is at 40. The last time it was this low was in August 2015, when the price was only $250.
I'm getting a bit torn about the situation right now. The market "should" have dropped a lot lower at this point considering (1) the big triangle broke down at 7k and (2) bears had several attempts at properly break 6k. But the market have decided to hover between 5800 and 6200 for a few days now. This seems a bit odd to me. But I'm leaning towards bulls just being naive right now.

All that said, I'm still quite tempted to close my hedge here around 5900. But I'm trying to sit on my hands as we just had the first ever daily close below 6k since ATH, which is quite bad news.
Started buying BTC at $99.99 in 2013, small amounts. DCA through bear winter of '14-'15. Last year in December at $11.3k was the first time I made any major purchases/sales: bought gold/silver coins with BTC, which I sold for cash at a slight loss soon after. Screw trying to go through the exchanges, I thought. I always kept my funds offline, figured I'd be questioned despite being a law-abiding citizen. Tried the Goldmoney route for this "cash-out method" too, and they did demand to know everything about me and the provenance of the coins. ... 

Bought into FOMO again in December, January of this year btw, I admit. Kept buying all the way up to $19.6k. Remained stubbornly bullish till we dropped to $9.6k. At that time I started taking profits again: 9.6k, 8.3k, 7.2k, 6.2k. Each time I spent a fraction more of my stash, on average buying 2-3 ozt of gold coins. 

Gold has been a losing investment too this year, but not dropping as fast as bitcoin, mind you, and I'm selling these coins again most times the same week I get them. But I like the optionality here, figured I'd share: a) keep some gold coins, b) sell for 'mattress cash', c) sell and put in the bank, d) sell and put into brokerage account. This process has allowed me to grow my USD savings, grow my non-BTC investments, pay off some remaining CC debt, but perhaps more importantly: gain massive liquidity compared to before. I still keep all BTC funds locked down, generally, but feel much more secure psychologically now with a couple gold/silver coins, a bit of cash in the bank, and no debt. ... 

Wrapping up: I restarted my DCA a couple weeks ago at ~$7000. Short-mid term bearish. Long term bullish. ... 

All the reshuffling of funds that I've done recently has been exhausting but I've gained in terms of peace of mind. My overall portfolio is down 70% this year, but because I have rebalanced and averaged down with 1/3 of my BTC holdings, I'm okay with it. Whether this fall or next year (who knows), I look forward to the beginning of next bull cycle. Hoping to better temper my FOMO the third time around. 

Cheers and thanks for reading, y'all. Couldn't have navigated these waters without you guys!
!short BTCUSD close 5850

My limit buy order got filled and taking profit here to see if we get a small bounce on the daily then further down, maybe a bounce down from the 20-10K resistance. It is time to step away for a bit and let the market do its thing then come back to trade more. Setting optimistic short limit sells until then to see if some of them get filled.
Not all traders read Reddit, there is a much larger world out there you know? :D
Decided to close my hedge from 6600 at ~5900 for a nice profit. [I was on the fence this morning](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8uq6eg/comment/e1hot0o) but decided to lock in profits.

I will not be surprised if we make another leg down from here, but there’ll be new opportunities to hedge/short a bounce at that point.

Have a great weekend all!
Damn, should have gone with my gut yesterday and naked short at 6.1k when i posted my pro/con list. At least i stayed in my hedge short, luckily. Now, i am again too scared to naked short this, although my gut says we will get below 5.7k, and if it is only for a stop hunt ...

Has there been some sort of news that would cause two massive jumps in price within the span of ~3 hours?
Eth continuing to dump harder. For a reversal in BTC I'd ideally like to see eth reversing when BTC is flagging/stagnant. Posting from a plane because I have an open short and a problem
Looks like many people are starting to get panicky. Maybe they got in within the last year thinking that bitcoin meant +100% gains every month. That's not what bitcoin's about, it's about long term value storage. With bitcoin you can buy a static fraction of the total, rather than a continually diluting fraction, and this makes it a better long term money. Bitcoin is sound money dressed up as a get rich quick scheme.

We can keep crashing from here for a while, for the last few months I've been saying $4k is still possible. (A year ago I thought the peak of the bubble would be $6800 tho, so take a grain of salt.) People will tell you this low price means bitcoin is dead, that it can't continue without the get rich quick momentum and hype, that if it stalls for a moment then it's lost its window of opportunity. But they're wrong, bitcoin is interesting beyond its price, it's revolutionizing the world with its predictability and openness.

But long term price is easy to predict too if they just zoom out a little. The fundamental thing driving the geometric rise in price is the geometric divergence in supplies between bitcoin and every other asset. The simple ratio of extant dollars : extant bitcoin will trend to infinity, and I expect the relative price to trend to infinity because of this. The complete lack of supply response overwhelms every other factor eventually, it's just a matter of time.


I'm seeing what looks to be a bear flag on descending volume here off the low at 5780.    I'm not seeing anything to suggest that this is the bottom.
This is a basic news aggregate and recap summary that I do every day for my own trading purposes.  I've posted this here one or two times before, I figured with the drop in chatter I'd try dropping it here and posting it in bitocinmarkets main sub more regularly in case anyone was interested.  Comment if you find it interesting that'll be enough incentive enough to keep me dropping it here. ty

Bitcoin really just looking to me like its following eth on the short term at the moment.
last thoughts from a long timer, making money hurts and it hurts 9 days out of 10. If you can't handle the burn. that is total ok, there is a whole other world outside of crypto.
Whilst im happy that we've gone up a little bit, and i have been hoping for it, lets not start sucking eachothers dicks quite yet.

im off to bed, i want 6k (ideally at least 6150) to hold to get a bit more confident (with stops)
When you look at it from a supply and demand perspective (especially in this illiquid market), the vertical rises at reversals make absolute sense. All the selling was done slowly as we grinded lower and lower. Now that we have a whiff of a potential reversal, demand is rapidly increasing with very little supply at these lower levels. Which explains why the first 1k or so of the reversal is a near straight shot.
[deleted]
Fuck this fucking shit. Been checking my blockfolio everyday like a junkie for 6 months. Wasted too much time on this dead horse.

BTC ain't ever going back to 20K. Instead of downvoting me, feel free to bet with me if you're feeling like you aren't throwing your money away at a dying fad.

I'll bet anyone here 1 BTC that BTC won't hit 20K in the next 10 years.

It was nice while it lasted. Now, it's never going back up. Y'all need to face the music.
I just found a funny little screenshot of a 10x long at 17.2k in December.

How were we all so god damn stupid, eh?
I'm sure many here will be pleased by the fact that my long from 6300 is now underwater but not uncomfortably so. Have not added yet. Will average down at 5K if it goes there.

Of all the investments I've made over the past five years, Bitcoin still has the best return by far. And this market is nothing compared to 2014. 
Ok, i want out. I am done with crypto. The Daily RSI is extremely low, should i wait or just get out now?
Have been sitting on the sidelines, in fiat, since 8k. I've decided to open a position this morning after no response to this latest dump. I'm still 100% on board with my prediction of 4k minimum. We are close to a market turn around but we need more blood in the streets.

So, short 5x @ 59XX.xx, left open til we see any sign of bullish momentum.
Now all the "experts" are going to start talking about 6500 even though this thread has spoken nothing but 5000.
Target $5500 for a technical bounce. We bounced extremely hard off $5750 the other day and right now doesn’t look like it’s happening.

Short from $6200’s/ $5889. 

Will stack some long orders in the $5500 range. 
I am interested in sentiment here, therefore its poll time.

It is just for fun and won't help to find out where the bottom will be ;): [https://strawpoll.com/fspp735b](https://strawpoll.com/fspp735b)

Distances between the numbers are 5&#37; rounded to the next 50 USD number. And: The question is where the next bottom is before we see a major increase and not where the absolut bottom will be in the next 3 years.
A bit surprised to see many traders I respect closing out shorts while we're flagging above what could be a capitulation support line, but I'm about to travel this weekend and can't babysit this. Took profit on 20% on my re-short from 6100 with a stop loss set for if this flag breaks up above 5950.
We are flirting with the top of our bear pennant right now. But you can also draw it as a bear flag?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/fYDKuOwy/

Either or, both are bearish. In the 8k range, the generally broke **UP**, but recently the formations have been playing out. 

I’m long currently, and hoping for a breakout so I’m able to grab another short entry. 
short 6300 50&#37; 1x

Wifey hatin on BTC.. Double hatin on ETH.. lol! 

Brutal times but bear markets leave you with lifetime learnings and experiences !
Hello guys, I started in crypto start of last year, I now mine and hold a nice portfolio 

I’m new to these bear markets bitcoin has regularly 

Do you Honestly believe it will recover at some point? 

I’ve only invested what I can lose but I’m worried the December bubble might have hurt bitcoin for a few years ? Am I wrong to think this? 

Just want some opinions  
The negative premium on the sept futs shrinked to 5-10 USD...(down from 100-150USD!) do the fut buyers know something i missed? 
ETHBTC hanging by the cliff at 0.69xx levels - being tested multiple times. If it breaks down, alts will shit their beds further.
So there's been a lot of talk about futures being used to short the market, but I would wager that the biggest BTC holders aren't "institutional investors" but whales who have simply been in the BTC game for a long time.  

I don't know a ton about futures, but there seems to be some people out there that think futures will drag the market down even further before the next settlement.  Isn't it entirely possible that BTC whales could absolutely wreck those shorting BTC via futures with a big pump? 


started messing with Stoch RSI recently.

is the pink div even valid? https://www.tradingview.com/x/45DxTdbe/
Relevant (to the sentiment of 'end of bitcoin' some actually expressed): 
http://bitcoinist.com/lightning-network-really-does-solve-bitcoin-scaling-andreas-antonopoulos/
Move up puts us right at the 12 MA we keep bouncing off of on the 1D. Things look worse for ETH though.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/9SwSHlFJ/
Uhhh, what spurred these pumps today? 
Well, had 2 successful trades. Just got liquidated with that squeeze. All good, it wasn't a large amount. 

Moving BTC and loading up again lol

EDIT:Nevermind, not liquidated but still moving BTC into BMex to open another position here. 
I’m from the year 3000 not much has changed but we live under water
So everyone thinks the price is going down? Isn’t that when you see a price movement in the opposite direction

Surely this qualifies as bearish euphoria?
So many of you are making novice mistakes that would be remedied just by reading a couple books on trading. (ie. DCA’ing down instead of DCA’ing up into a rising market, trading on news, taking double-digit percentage losses per trade, making trades based on others’ judgements, etc.) Take advantage of this boring market to increase your knowledge. Make yourself smarter than the average 20k buyer who sold at 6k. Prepare yourself for the next bull market so you can make money on the way up, and on the way down.
I think there's an argument to be made for a falling wedge on the 3 day now:

[removed]
What do you really think of the fundamentals ? I hear so much trolling about how BTC has absolutely no fundamentals, that it's only use is for criminals buying drugs and that it is a huge ecological disaster. 
Can't seem to find this data without parsing it myself... Hints appreciated.

Snapshot of BTC dominance (included top 20 mineable, no tokens):

edit: For fun, added some historical data, again with no tokens (pure POS as they were called back then).

Coin | Dominance (%) | Oct. 2014 Coin | Oct. 2014 Dominance (%)
---|---|---|---|
Bitcoin | 60.5 | Bitcoin | 95.4
Ethereum | 24.7 | Litecoin | 2.7
Bitcoin Cash | 6.8 | Dogecoin | 0.6
Litecoin | 2.5 | Peercoin | 0.4
Monero | 1.2 | Dash | 0.2
Dash | 1.1 | Namecoin | 0.2
Ethereum Classic | 0.9 | BitcoinDark | 0.1
Zcash | 0.4 | Monero | 0.1
Bytecoin | 0.3 | Bytecoin | 0.0
Decred | 0.3 | Quark | 0.0
As a total noob trader, I wonder how many others are numb to the effects of these BGDs/MGDs (medium). The April one I FOMO'd, now I look at the smaller time frames and hear:

*"Pomp eet zen paint a bull flag"*

This wasn't 8 days of false breakout below the trend line, will wait for further confirmation before moving on it
Chart still says new lows are in the near future, but no reason this can't be randomly pumped to $7500 or $8000 any time.  It's would just be a lower low after $10K and not change much of anything.

If $10K is taken out, then that changes the big picture.  $10K is a 62% increase in price from here.

When flippening?

Sir? SIR?
I think EOS's mainnet release being a shitshow (coupled with their selling of ETH being a dumping catalyst) has really hurt faith in alts/crypto in general. This was supposed to be one of the big "sure thing" projects. Now Larimer's trying to replace the constitution 2 weeks after mainnet. https://bitcoinist.com/eos-constitution-scrap-larimer/
Some insights from some random guys on the internet. Do not take this too seriously. This is encouragement to plan ahead for the next few months. Not an advertisement to FOMO into a position even if this text might give you some bullish vibes. We are simply not there, yet!

Me and some friends have a small chat group where we talk crypto investments. We are mostly 2010 to 2011 guys and girls.

Back in the first week of August 2017, I wrote: "We are ready now. The top will be found between 15 to 20k within a few weeks. After that we will see a harsh correction down to 4k. Let's enjoy the ride."  

From a longer term perspective 4k was/is just another mid term target on the way, a check post if you want.

Long story short: Recently I see a lot of new investors who lost all or at least a huge amount of their investment. Always follow your principals. Do not invest what you can not afford to lose (digest emotionally).

And remember: It is always (emotionally confusing) darkest before the dawn.

Just wanted to let you know, that we moderately started buying here. We never expect to catch the exact bottom or top. But price is sufficiently low to put in some money parked on the sidelines. We are not entirely sure we will see 4k, though. Worst case scenario we are planing for (keeping some money ready) brings us down to 2k. Only if we get there, we would re-test our fundamental assumptions we hold about this market. We are not Bitcoin maximalists either. We encourage monetary competition. We tend to believe, that fundamentals are still strongest for Bitcoin and a few other interesting projects. We think that most ICOs in their current form are a money grabs by late-comers. Money will flow back into a few select coins and/or fiat. Like in 2014 the landscape will change drastically. The market will soon enough forget 90&#37; of the coins and tokens in the top 25!

Some observations that make us put our money where our mouth is:

\* Price trend is down (x0.3)

\* Volume is down (x0.2)

\* Hash rate is up (x3)

\* Mining reward is down (x0.5)

\* Indicators are down

\* Eco system is vastly different (anti-fragile)

\* Sell pressure is down (no hacks or other sell-offs)

\* Bitcoin-days-destroyed is down

\* Sentiment is low. We do not expect it to get worse, even if price starts to decline for a few more weeks

\* Lightning is experimental (it does not play any role in our assessment)

Do we think CBOE/CME has a huge influence. Yes, but mainly because media ties are used to steer the masses. Do we think it tamed Bitcoin? No. we think Bitcoin will tame traditional markets including exchanges. We are of the opinion that this market is going to scare off quite a few traditional market guys once this market turns around. They are new comers in a way, too. If they want to play on our market, they have to play by our rules.

We tend to agree, that we will see a bottom within 8 weeks. That does not mean we will not have an overall bearish sentiment for a much longer time frame. We also agree, that this market is not comparable to the last bear market in 2014. If at all it behaves more like 2011 bubble deflation scenario with lesser up and downside and lesser external influences. At one point an over-heated engine (same applies for markets) has to cool down to work properly again.

Disclosure: Our holdings are in the ball park of 1xxx-10xxx. We were sellers between 15 and 20k and are buyers between 4 and 6k.
ETH was falling in tandem in the drop earlier today, now it is getting shitfaced.. Ratio needs correction and it has no support after 0.069 - free fall to 0.055 - 58 - April lows
Weekly chart is just brutal - barring a small green candle during which the price stabilized between 7500-7650, it is straight 8 red candles. 

Few points to watch for (Finex):

1. Based on the TD, we are at 7/9..
2. 100 EMA is at 5575
3. Swing low for bounce in Nov. is at 5434
4. 100 MA is 4600 range
5. Longs will see liquidation below swing low of 5770

Talks of a relief rally keep popping up but I don't know when we see one as there is so much lack of follow through on these bounces - thinking we bounce off 100 EMA to test 6500 area and then go down to 4600 area in 2 weeks to get a 9 candle on the weekly chart..
So that CME expiration didn't pump the market, ya??

can we cross that one off the "confirmation bias" list now? 
If I look at the log chart, $4k doesn't seem so far fetched...

It would still be a logarithmic growth...

https://i.imgur.com/DxZvqd1.png
Some time ago, somewhere in early Dec we were around 15k. I made a comment telling people to plan their exits cause this will drop one day.

I'm reminding about it now not to brag about that I was right. I'm reminding it to tell the same thing. Plan your exits. Not because this may collapse totally. Just to make a plan so that you won't be shaken off by emotions. If you can't stand a loss just make a plan 'I will exit at $x' and stick to it.

If you're still holding then you didn't listen to people telling you that it'll drop so you won't listen to people telling you where to exit. I'm not telling you where to do that. Make your own decision and just stick to it, so that you can't complain that you 'lost $x'. If you lost then, you did it on your own and you made an aware decision. If you didn't listen to people telling you where to exit because you had a plan - that's you aware decision. If you didn't listen to those people just because 'they are wrong' and you were greedy - that's your own emotional decision.
To me the sentiment in here feels not like 2014-2015, but summer 2013, after the $250 bubble. Everyone is SURE we are going lower, that the bubble has popped, but is waiting to buy the bottom and still obsessing over price.

Maybe it's just pre-mature and we need more downside for everyone to forget about crypto for a while...but it feels to me like we're going to get a strong bounce off the "bottom" and head back up, rather than grind around at lows for 9+ months.

Wild speculation: I'm calling for an implosion event for tether involving SEC calling for it to unwind as an unlicensed money transmitter. Crash to ~$1500 (2018's Silk Road moment) and then a steady march past ATH by Q1 2019.
I feel like a goddamn fool. Ignored advice from brother, friends, Warren buffett!(!!) and now I'm staring a £30-35k (too scared to calculate real figure) loss in the face. 

Anyone else in my position, I need mental support ):
Looking at the daily at r/CryptoCurrency it seems that alts have finally reached capitalation stage. Every second post is like "How could we be so stupid?" or "Remember January posts about shitcoin xyz? It was sopposed to go 100x EOY lol". Despair awaits, which will happen after some major project goes bust. EOS looks like a good candidate.   
   
Bitcoin still seems to be somewhat in denial.
This market is such an artificial joke, I don't know how anyone can look at this and think anything else. We are in here talking about TA, trying to analyze everything, and it just comes down to whatever whale playing the game decides to do to the market at any given moment. You basically see it meandering around mostly sideways at low volume until someone in an office presses a big green / red button. At this point it feels more like roulette than making educated guesses.
Just got another fat dump of more than 590BTC on finex. Following the 450 one two hours ago. Both happened after a nice build up in price who failed around 5880.
Looking pretty ugly tbh. Just broke 5800
Are green days ahead of us soon boys?
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-28/sec-poised-to-advance-etf-approval-rule-long-sought-by-industry
BFX longs are increasing.  Lol
Since the top, bears have been rolling things back in the context of a strengthening dollar and falling stock market until we are at the levels we were mid-October last year. 

Looking at it in those terms we can easily fall further.

Unless we hear some Facebook-level news, any recovery would probably need 3-4 weeks to prove it had legs. 

Mid-September 2017 would put us at around  $3700.
Well... I guess this is one way to increase your stack.

Guys... I see some heated comments! I'm linking the article as relevant, it does not mean I agree with everything said there. Each makes their own judgement. 

For me the most important part is the last sentence: “Institutional investors, before they commit their capital, want to see the market is fair.”
New 7 month low on Bitstamp..Finex got close.

Fireworks came early....
don't get too excited!
Anyone else believe the bullish div using RoC on the 1d and 12hr?  Do you use a different oscillator?
What's everyone waiting for next? I'm thinking a convincing break of $6,300 cause that would close the 6hr candle nicely.
Hello to all of you , im new to this so just a quick question,was this a technical bounce or a genuine pump?

Ever since we dropped through 6250 support...we've been clamoring to get back over it.

Best word to describe Coinbase Pro... "Clunky"?
Longs haven't decreased even a tiny bit during the last dump and that makes it pretty clear that most of them have their stop losses just bellow the previous low ([somewhere within the orange box](https://www.tradingview.com/x/xuFmdYyu/)).

[Look what usually happens when we get such a crazy amount of longs.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/JNHbXHIE/). If we get BTC to that orange box price level, the cascading effect will be huge.

What was that bcash pump about just now? 
ah yes, bands tighten, another dip, what else is new. 
No margin liquidation cascades yet?

I'd do awful things for <$200B aggregate crypto market cap.
Anyone know what’s going to happen when ETH breaks this line?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/JcqK1OeP/

Bounced off it once already... if it breaks down I expect BTC to get dragged along with it 

Seems like next target would be $250-$300

Back when we blew through 5k We created a nice gap from 4970ish to 5100ish.  Bitcoin always fills its gaps.  The gaps have always been The best places to buy.  
what, coming home, price is the same, but everybody here is going long or closing short... :D
Too jaded by the bear market to trust any upward price movement - aye :)

It drops pretty much every single day and you guys hold bullish celebrations everytime the value doesnt fall for over  2 hours. That's just plain sad. Hope you guys sell before 4k soon.

Get over your pride and sunk cost fallacy, its cost you too much already.
Every time a sketchy big green dildo like this happens, more and more traders leave the market, either by way of liquidation or just apathy towards what Bitcoin has become.

So congrats to whoever is pulling the strings and whoever is profiteering off these moves. But it should be noted that if the intent is to engineer bullish momentum/continuation by creating 'organic' fomo you're not going to achieve that by making the Bitcoin market look like an absolute joke.
&#37;90 of the people here are insane and think some Illuminati ass whales control bitcoin... I'm sure if bill gates got into bitcoin he could manipulate the price a little - but there is no bitcoin god as many of you think. Tired of reading comments like "whoever brought the price up to $6200 is going to bring it back down to $5800 cause..." stfu, there isn't one person or one group of people doing all this. Think logically, think supply/demand relative to panic selling/hodling.
Looks like our friends at the "smart contract" HQ are having their ratio plummet like a rock. Seems pretty bearish to me. Whales are definitely going risk-off.
This is the second time we have bounced off ~5770 hard. If we hold these levels we may make our way back to 7-8k. If we fall through support we might be saying goodbye to 5k.

Just out of curiosity, was anyone around for this crash? 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2017/06/22/ethereum-price-crash-10-cents-gdax-exchange-after-multimillion-dollar-trade.html

As new as coinbase pro is, I don’t think they will ever see margin trading again due to this. 

Pretty crazy story.. people lost millions 

Little more than 1 year ago today 
Going long here - $5850

Expecting some sort of bounce before we start dropping down again. 
Wondering when true fomo will hit. I'm betting > 6800. If we break that 6800 we could see a nice BGD on the daily, emulating the last break of 6800. No one will want to miss that, especially those that missed it the first time. 


Edit: Downvotes from salty bears. Relax, we could very well see it retrace to sub-6k. 
https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSDLONGS/

longs still going up... could you guys give us a break Please? this is so ripe of liquidating...
"Lets make it a quick double bounce bottom" failed. 
Where can I go long on Wyckoff memes? 
Right I’ve put a long order in 3x at 5850 let’s see if it triggers.

My logic is that we’ve had 4 touches at 5700-5800 over the past week and none have been breached.

Not to say that it won’t go down below eventually, but think there will be a little run up first. Will add to my long at 5500, then cut my losses at 5200.
Anyone else swear to themselves for the 100th time that they are absolutely done buying any more dips, or dumping another dollar into this sinking hellhole, knowing full well that's a complete lie and the second BTC flash drops another $200 you're going to smash the shit out of that buy button?

Although there are many parallels between this bear and the 2013-2015 market there is one big difference. In 2014 this far into the bear, we were fairly stable at around the 50&#37; Fibonacci mark, having recovered from \~38.2&#37;. That rather weak recovery slowly led to bitter disappointment as the market bled away to a cycle low near the 23.6&#37; line in Jan 2015.

This time around we're in better shape precisely because, counter-intuitively, we've failed to retrace to anything near the 50&#37; line this far in (the March recovery paralleled the 2014 performance). At the moment we're near 33&#37;, which is unstable no mans land. In any case, we're in an accelerated bear market which is unlikely to be propped up and delayed by false hope as it was in 2014 - which means it ought to end quicker as well.

Where is your 'capitulation' price? (with no strong bounce)  
***EDIT: Where you would consider selling, if the price was to not bounce hard from a clear bottom.***

(Bonus question: What does your maximum pain scenario look like?)
Ugh, so another failed attempt. Calm your tits dear bears, goblin town isn’t happening 
Been noticing this trend past month or so - new coins being listed on Binance are relatively less known with cheap valuation and right after the launch they pump big time..Plenty of examples: today is something called KEY, others: IOTX, THETA, DATA....

Edit: Added exchange (Binance)
For all people holding like me since a long time, don't loose faith in crypto. Coinbase opening new office in Seattle, Binance opening new crypto fiat exchange. These company wouldn't invest money if they don't believe crypto has a future long term. And it does.

Anyone know of a BTC dominance chart that only includes mineable crypto? (not tokens?) Or maybe it doesn't matter so much since they would be a small percentage (others are ~22%)?
For the coders here, how difficult would be to create an indicator on TV that relays Bitmex's open interest from their API?

So, the December Futures on Bitmex start trading in about 9 hours, right? Or is it in a day and a few of hours?
Bloomberg releases their FUD article this morning, then a BGD comes in the evening to take us from 58xx to 62xx. 
I’m not educated on Div’s.

What’s the potential target the Div’s on the daily and 12H? 
 
Double bottom breakout, probably test 6800 resistance. Support  ~6300.

Eta: short squeeze is over now, but the price action is strong breaking the diagonal resistance from 7800
[My two targets](http://prntscr.com/k120w9) though we have to break the May log resistance line to get anywhere.
anyone else having trouble logging into kraken?

The fact that Bloomberg put out this silly little FUD piece today makes me think that "the manipulators" want to push this further down. Problem is it was some really weak FUD, so maybe they're cooking up something better right now?
Okay lets all click buy exactly on the hour!
Can anyone give me some actual reasons of why crypto should have a valuation as high as it does now? I’m honestly struggling to see how this market is worth so much.
If you are feeling bad about the price, go check over at the EOS subreddit and it will be sure to put things into perspective.
So who's panicking? Not I, but I'm pretty sure the people who pissed away all that money on that weak little dump are! :)) If you're short, you'd better cover before they do, and if you're long, don't forget to thank them for their generosity. 
This doesn't look good.  If 5800 breaks again then there will be panic.   5000 should come fast.
I wonder if these guys dumping realize that the people they are buying and borrowing from OTC are using the proceeds to buy Bitcoin at a discount. Probably not. And $120 mil to drop the price 4 percent? Puh leeze. Give up already.

Also, shaking out the shitcoins = This is good for Bitcoin &tm;
Thoughts on Peter Brandt ?
Looks like there is a fair amount of 5900 shorters. Not an astronomic amount but enough for a small squeeze: https://imgur.com/a/CdSPPGV

If I'm tethered right now but I want to convert to fiat but I'm afraid BTC's going to dump inbetween the time I buy BTC and the time it transfers to a fiat gateway exchange and I'm able to sell it, any suggestions?

Hmm can’t even get into coinbase pro.  Oh well.  Fun times
Everyone sounds so despondent here. Today and tomorrow many people are selling to generate a loss on purpose, to balance out profits before financial year closes. This is just a stocktake sale - time to buy, not to give up hope.
[deleted]
I’ll tell you what my confirmation of the next bullrun signal is: when I see btc up big breaking out and almost all alts dropping as that happens. I remember that happening right before we went parabolic. Mark my words I’m selling any liquid assets I have at the time and going all in on margin when I see this. Until then I’m going to bias towards low leveraged shorts on up moves (soonish)
As a guy who started following Crypto in December 2017, all I have ever known was high prices. I was so jealous of people who bought cheap coins, not because of their profits, simply because they had more coins, and at a time everything was too expensive for me.

Sentiment changes, if somene had told me in January about the current prices I would have told him it's good enough, I'll go all in. But now, it feels like the bottom is not even near, I expect maksimum pain and the same volatility like it was before this bull cycle to even consider looking for reversal. I really doubt from the TA standpoint that we will have strong and sudden reversal (V shape), all indicators are pointing that the long bear is ahead of us.


Big Shorty is capitulating as expected. My long from 6300 is green again, but I'm not closing.

Never. Short. Bitcoin. Even in a bear market. Have you guys learned your lesson yet, or do we need to keep beating it into you?
Nah, this dildo couldn't even beat the one we had last sunday. See you in -2k.
This sub is full of cry babies. Do not invest 50k into something you don't understand and then come here and cry that you have lost more than half of your life savings. Someone took your money and you were outplayed in the market.

Next stop: BTC 5.5k (next 24 hours - 36 hours)

Stop after that: BTC 5.2k (My guess Monday)

Market cap, we have retraced 71&#37; from the top. Usual retracament would be 78&#37;. So we are only 7&#37; short from it. 

Bitcoin absolute possible bottom is 4.5k, trend line from 2011. 

Good luck to everyone!
In that we are all heading into the weekend, after what has been a rough and tumble week and month – with frayed nerves everywhere – I wanted to a not-so-gently comment to the group that we share a significant point of commonality.  Be you short or long, spot or derivative, we all seek the same outcome; to build a BTC stack. I believe, perhaps naively, that all of us here are far more united in conviction than not.

TL:DR bros before BTC.

How are we feeling after that squeeze? Just another bouncing dead cat or do we think this thing has legs?

It will be interesting to see if BTC will reach a higher market dominance than its last peak for the first time ever. I’m a firm believer that we won’t see the next alt run up until BTC reaches a new ATH 
Bye 5900! See you at 5800 in another hour! Lol

With bitcoin breaking under 9k, 8k, 7k and now 6k in the past month; how many days until we see under 5k?

Most of the charts point to before next weekend!

It was BCH leading the market all along....
For all the times Bitcoin has been claimed to reach a "critical support"...we agree this is actually critical support right?

Oh, Look at me! I'm a bitcoinmarkets superstar. WOO

Just kidding. Much respect bro :D

Please visit us more often
Glad to see you posting again! I've really missed following your insight
Only comment (and it's purely academic - I agree that it's just math and not worth speculating on the target for the triangle breakdown at this stage)  is that it makes more sense to calculate targets on the log scale when doing patterns on the log scale. So a \~100&#37; width would put the target at a little over 3k imo.

Again, agree it's not important. Just chiming in on that small part. Appreciate the analysis.
Welcome back!!!
I though RSI divergences can't be relied upon in a strong trend?
Nailed it 
Man, do you ever get tired of being right?
I have been bullish to neutral this last dip to 5800 before the recent fall. I am scaling in some buy orders, but cautiously watching. I think altcoin is getting crushed hence I would becareful buying alts, maybe just a few major ones with dominance % high.
Divergence is so hard to trade, I usually can't rely on it (when I do rely on it, it simply doesn't play out, and when I don't it does!)
https://www.tradingview.com/x/FpUzKylr/

A less negative scenario might play out in the old log channel (brown lines). 

Otherwise, the log downtrend line won't reach 1.2K (neon green line) until March/April 2019. There's a good chance that the price stays above the original downtrend line during the entirety of the bear trend, so if it does get that low, we may only be 1/3rd or 1/4th the way through the cycle.
been following your posts since I entered crypto back in 2016, although I don't trade with margin I always enjoy taking a look at your insights.
such a progress you made since your exit back when the market dumped to the 700s in Jan 2017, there is something I admire about people like you: they get it right more often.
Good analysis again. Very plausible too. Thanks for sharing and explaining!
Imagine that
/u/BitcoinTrolling101 
Also, where can we see volume now? Wtf like they are gimping this thing on purpose.
I agree. It is straight up horrible. Chart is unreadable and can't even see past beyond 15 min time frame. Also what does the arrow button next to the volume do? I keep pressing it and nothing happens.
I fucking hate it
I’m underwater til 7.2 and not the least bit concerned. I will at least break even some time this summer. 
You're getting soggy

/u/olesentv is this your downvote bot? lol
Sorry, I'm not religious. But I'll reserve some hopium for you! ;)
I'm stuck in a 5X long on ETH from 470.
At this point i just don't care, i'm going down with the ship like the band of the Titanic.

Besides my poor trade choices, some added bad luck (forgotten stop loss that got me in this messed up trade) and amateur mistakes are really saying that i suck at trading and should just quit.

My liquidation should be around the lowest ETH has been lately (around 360).
I just know that if i close the position and switch to short it will just bounce and i'll feel even worse.
Congratulations on your success!
Dude, please tell me you've taken profit on some of that on this BGD. Please don't be asleep.
Massive congrats!!!!
I read a post of you 'fuck it, hodl mode now' like 15 sec ago. This shit confuses me.
lol I feel like that's so much of the buying here, "fuck it"
Can I pray for you to change your mind? Why not choose one specific place to look for a bounce?
And now I remember I have to get (wrinkled) clothes out of the dryer. Damn you for distracting me, bitcoin!
On a serious note, if anyone here is still wearing cotton underwear I'd like to encourage you to live a little.  Check out SAXX.  You'll be a convert.

The only downside is that they soil just as easily when your money vaporizes in front of you.
It coincides with the closing of the traditional markets, which is a pain, as I'm currently big big big time long and won't be able to close until the Asian markets open 11pm Sunday night (almost midnight Friday now in UK). 
What does BGD stand for?
$300 pumps every 2 hours..? Seems doable!
morning or afternoon?
i think cutting losses and shorting now is the best plan.
Does anyone seriously buy into BTC price being predicted by 'unresolved long poles dating back 8 months' and 'a new column of 7 O's'. 

The mind boggles sometimes. 

TA used by people here has been proven to be wrong time and time again, almost consistently in fact. 

You also have the Massey University study showing it produces results directly comparable to those random chance would offer. You also have the fact that TA is largely seen as a meme in traditional finance.

Yet people here still treat it like gospel LOL.
Thanks for the update. Crazy times these are.
Thank you for the continued insight
Bla Bla Bla... Bitcoin will do what it wants to be honest. No pole is going to decide where its going.

I dare you to buy gold for everyone in here.
Coinbase Pro and Bitstamp trading interfaces look like their designers wanted to make it look cool, modern and minimalistic, but they haven't actually traded once in their lifes.
hate it 
Yeah it's very bizarre. I don't know how that could have ended up as a finished product without some sort of agenda. It makes no sense at all. 
Yea GDAX honestly looked way better to me. But hey at least we can scroll and zoom the fucking charts
There's no such thing as manipulation, ingore all the simpletons that blame their losses on whales. A sell is a sell, a buy is a buy, regardless of size or intent. 
Its not manipulation, its smart trading.

And if I was trying to capitalize on the sentiment, I would do so quietly and methodically, not like, well like that. That was no free lunch designation for bottom shorters who lost their allowance. 

Just my two Satoshis. 
That’s a nice idea, but that doesn’t make a chart like this where there is a single big green candle out of sideways low volume action. Second time it has happened like this, it is an unregulated market, if you think market making isn’t happening that is quaint. 
>  some people are simply capitalising on an opportunity to buy when everyone else is fearful?

"Some people", meaning a small number of people who manipulated the price down, and then back up.   Yes that is possible.
I’m excited to see what the Chinese New Year will bring us in 2022
Yikes, let’s hope January doesn’t last *that* long.
I don't think we'll go straight there but I could definitely see us meander our way to that log line from here.

Moved the stops on my long to in decent profit but definitely letting this ride a little.
were you shorting?
It's bear flags all the way down

Can you explain why its a good thing?
You're trying to be ironic but this is actually bullish. You'll see.
Its almost like noone is really buying bitcoin except degenerate traders anymore, don't see how we can't run to 200k eoy.
Bullish! As Buffet says- When people are Greedy- Be fearful, when people are fearful: BE GREEDY!
Both you and haser were discussing opening new shorts.

But since chewtoy came and said he closed his short you are both going long.

And we scream manipulation.
Funny. I was reading an interview in Market wizards, and a trader that served in a war said how you get used to the fear, but what is intolerable is the boredom. 
10k by 2020 confirmed.
That’s honestly about what I expect. Any quick pumps back up from here would likely just delay the inevitable imo. We need a long-term low-volatility consolidation period before we can expect any sort of long-term recovery.
You are clearly underestimating greed and supply shocks imo.
> I wasn’t wearing glasses

*cough* nerd *cough*
Didn't take profits?  I took 2/3 profits, and when it wasn't immediately rejected, I added some back.  Ca 5860 -> 5910 on sept.
Take profits 
The sentiment everywhere was negative. 

The extreme opposite of 15-20k

Think of the charts as a press pushing an invisible spring until it pops back up against the pressure.

The amount of noobs that longed the top started shorting the bottom.

Was that the reversal? Who knows, but we are doing okay for now. 
the FOMO effect in action
Someone with a lot of money doing a big market buy, or less likely simultaneously everyone decided to buy buy buy! 
It is manipulated both ways...up and down, and most of the posts in this sub (that do not deny that significant manipulation exists) state that clearly and often.
IMO there is really not much organic volume. Most are holding or waiting. All these sudden movements seem to be triggered by whales and accelerated by short term traders.
>th

I have been very lucky being on the right side of trades more often than not, but this last situation here felt like 50/50, and I am starting to feel more like a gambler than a trader. 
Noticed them. (spend all my chart watching time these days watching https://trading.gear54.me/tradeflow/ instead)


There were also several big buys into a hidden sell wall last night that didn't provoke the market reaction I expected. Big patient bears seem willing to let these big hungry bulls come to their limit orders.


Might be that the Battle of 8500 is now the Battle of 5800, /u/haserfauld?


Thinking about closing my hedge short (of my tiny stack) that I've more or less had since $11k and going flat.
It's the same cycle we see again and again...retail investors panic, smart money backs up the truck. 
The ~~pattern~~ chaos continues, as noted here: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8uq6eg/daily_discussion_friday_june_29_2018/e1hyunb/

We are all over the place.
Certainly caught my eye. Barely moved the price.
It seems some1 open Short with limit order and some guys instantly bought it. You can see Short just jump up more than 1k that time.
I believe 2020/21 will be the bubble of bubbles when it comes to crypto. Until then we're just sploshing around in the shallows. 
There was a much smaller bubble in the 90s, I think that is a better comp
Everyone mentions it
Tbh that's why I think we should have one more bull run before it collapses..
What are you confused about?
Internet had use cases.  Bitcoin is 10 years in with 0 use cases outside of crime.  Also the internet was not widely regarded by the general public as a scam like bitcoin is.
I don't know if I'd call that a BGD. I guess if you're looking at anything less than a 6 hour.
It means someone wanted the daily to close above $6200.
Another interesting thing to note is that before the BGD in april, we went sideways instead of climbed up. On the way down from $11.7k and $9.9k both times, every move down was preceded by a bear flag type move- but before both of these moves upwards, we went sideways/ranged instead of crawled up.
Just gotta brag on myself for a sec here. Here was my May 19th prediction for a potential fractal of the April price action: [https://www.tradingview.com/i/UMMK51Yq/](https://www.tradingview.com/i/UMMK51Yq/).

If this plays out, I'm still expecting a Wyckoff-style accumulation period for the coming weeks, as it looks like we're right about where we were at April 7th on the second squeeze up. However, I would admittedly like to see some disbelief from bears, or we're not really setting up for a significant squeeze upwards from here.
So is that the second div playing out? Geez
hopefully you'll be buying boring total stock market ETFs because you can definitely lose half your money gambling on individual equities too, just not as fast as crypto.
See you around, friend. It was a hell of a ride.
Hope you’re okay dude. Try stay positive. Reach out if you need.
[deleted]
Keep your head up bro and take care.
At that point I'd tell you to just leave that money in there and forget about it until the price rises again. It sounds like you risked way too much and bought at ATH. Did you?
Lost as in liquidated or just your BTC hodl stack losing its value?
What? I thought I read your comment like 2-3 days ago saying you were nervous shorting at 6.2k or something.
Bullish.

^sorry.fo.your.loss.
When did you buy?
Did you put 70k in, though, or did you make 70k from the bull run and then lose 35 of it?
You have no idea what I have lost so far since ath lol 

Edit: btw stocks aren't in any good position either right now....
Do you hold any crypto?


Don't give up on crypto completely tho. Keep checking the prices. When you see BTC move up by greater than 10&#37; in a single day. That's most likely the best time to buy again. Historically, the best time to buy BTC is after a 70-90&#37; crash. You do not want to miss the next rally. Some traders will use 10X margin to buy BTC once they see the bottom. Prices will violently go up again, could be anywhere from 3k-4k.
easy way to invest in the stock market: buy SPY index and QQQ index on every major dip and hold. super safe and effective!
Might be the old way, but definitely doesn’t have to be the long way. Bought Netflix call options at a 387 strike price for 15 on Tuesday and sold them for 29.5 on Wednesday morning. 1450 profit on a 1500 investment in one day, when was the last time you got that kind of return in crypto?
Please don't give up, bitcoin will go to 100,000 in 2019 after declines to 2k
Big players weren't suppressing the price until futures expired.
The crash of btc is nothing compared to typical economic collapses

Firstly the amount of people and money involved in crypto is tiny in the grand scheme of things, and you'd hope that the vast majority of those getting involved appreciated the fact that they could lose all of their money, with little to no prospect of recovering their losses. 

In typical crashes you can relax and forget about your stocks and shares (most have the majority of their funds in indexes etc anyway) and check in 5 years time. 
"This crash isnt bad because I am up"
Doesn't seem bad to you due to low investment amount so long ago, but trust me, anyone who paid over 10k for BTC in the last 7 months is feeling it acutely right now.
That's the oil industry for you, boom and bust cycles happen on the regular 

You only have a career in the industry and not with a specific company.

/u/whydontyoutryit brought up a good point. Futures are closing in the next hour for CME.  IIRC, there were fakeout pumps the last two times of about $300 and then back to where it started and lasted about a half hour. 

I'm staying in fiat because I don't want to gamble with those chances. I'll decide in a couple hours knowing I'm risking some of my position. Right now, fiat is more important to me though.
It is bearish, you're right. I got aggressive with my adds and pulled my CA to close to $6K for my liking. I saw a chance for a 6% stack increase and took it. I think we may see a small rally back to test 6100 as resistance based on bull divs and CME close (in the next hour), but I don't see us going too much higher.

I'm still holding a YOLO short on swaps from basically right here. If we break up, it's getting cut very quickly. https://www.tradingview.com/x/JyLkHSQ6/
Short... don't make me whip out my macd again.
Same... I expect more down trend at least till 5.5k since log trend line sits currently there and our November low but maybe the better traders are smelling something for the near future. 
The weak sell off make a me wanna rebuy a bit of my stack too

If you are willing to ignore the academic evidence that TA gives nothing superior to random chance (Massey University)

Or that even in traditional finance TA is viewed very much like a meme 

Then so be it

What we actually have here is a lot of wannabe traders who have read a wiki on TA and repeat it as gospel, and those who cry 'fud' to explain downward price movements, and yes I'm referencing you as one of many such people 

Still it is absolutely hilarious to watch, especially the cries of 'long'...before the price crashes another hundred dollars
When we hit bottom, there won't be a skyrocketing price jump:

First bottom after the 2018 bubble lasted about a day. Second one lasted around 2 weeks. Real bottom will be months.

The 2014 bubble took 1 1/2 years to recover.
Bottom will be 4k or under 2k if it does not hold.
But we are at the waist.
So instead of capitulating you shoved your whole stack in? :-/ You can't bluff Bitcoin.
Big balls. 
Did that with ETH at 150s last summer. Went YOLO degenerate. Was not disappointed. Won't ever do it again. 
>The funny part is that whatever happens from here will seem extremely obvious in hindsight. 

What you find funny I find infuriating. ;) Not so much the outcome, but the glut of people who will come in here alleging they are the trading equivalent of rain-man and that they knew it was coming and oh my god it was so obvious you'd have to be a retard to have traded the opposite way and... (ohmygodmakeitstop).
Yeah sometimes I'll think to myself that I have absolutely no idea what's going to happen, and then when the market makes a move, I say "Ah damn, I should have seen that coming, it makes perfect sense that it happened."


Sometimes I'm lucky enough to have the correct position open, like I did yesterday, but more often than not, I just don't do anything.
There's a part of me that wants to go 1x long here (net 2x long), but this is a pretty perfect bear flag heading into a weekend.

I'm traditionally very bad at margin longs. 
Hotsoccermom I regretfully inform you that you are about to get liquidated if you are long from 6600. But hey on the bright side this one guy from the SEC said crypto is like cell phones in the 90s, right?
I was convinced he was Dush LARPing for a bit
Last couple times IIRC, there was a fakeout pump. Lasted maybe 30 min then went right back down.
Personally I have not. But there are people in here that have.

You would be up a significant amount of money :) 
I posted this yesterday, it could answer your question. It might also just be coincidental.

What tool is that on the trades ticker you linked?
those are wash traded shorts to create a narrative for a short squeeze, harry is probably going to pump it  soon
I did that. I wouldn’t say it was an obvious move.. but there was definitely some potential for an upside.

Shorts were up like 15% and the majority seem to have all been under the 6k range. Perfect to give us some fuel for a BGD. 

Also bears failed to make a lower low under 6k after we broke through again which was bullish to me.: ontop of the bulldiv’s on the daily/12H this thing can have some fuel.

>Short $1mm @ $6420.

Order books are quite thin up here seems risky, 1k btc and we testing 6600.

Fucking sick returns though so who am I to say anything.
The big profit from the roll-over, was it "expected" or more of a surprise?
Target on the new short?

Props, on the good trade. Crazy money.
I don't think anyone is taking the bait. Bulls have become Charlie Brown waking up to Lucy's bullshit
fake pump / short closing / wishful thinking by bulls. both btc and eth are not done with their sell offs imo. i already closed my shorts and will short again when the price is right. up 50% this week from shorting :) just wish it was on a bigger balance. but i have found i do much better trading smaller balances than i do trading larger balances
Position fixed, check it to see if everything is ok now.

Will see if i can create a reclose_because_i_messed_up command to make it easier to fix.  :)

Meanwhile just tag me in a comment or PM me so i can fix it in the database

Yes. Way too high, and low price movement. Interesting, not sure what to read there.
You underestimate what many people are capable of when money is involved.

Well, a lower low with 0-ish bounces on the way down kinda sucks
Most people psychologically are not equipped to recognize, much less handle being wrong. Even people who are able to do that usually have to constantly work at it and monitor wishful thinking in themselves. It takes a long time for moon dreams to die and to squeeze the FOMO out of people as it gets overwhelmed by Fear of Losing Even More.
I think it shows here how many got in last year or 2016 and were not prepared for this bear market. Those that will survive will earn the bull market and be much more prepared for the next long bear market. 

The only ones not panicked are probably those that experienced 2013 and 2014/2015.
I dont think we are anywhere near capitulation or panic yet. Pretty much every post describing the current situation (including yours) includes a hopeful sentiment of "bottom soon" or "long term will be better". Which is ok, but pretty far from capitulation. Capitulation is when people actually, really start to believe that there is a very possible scenario where most of the crypto scene goes bust, pretty much nothing comes out of the hundreds of altcoins and 99% of them completely die (imagine what that will be like), and bitcoin will not be used much more than it is today. When that happens, there wont be "but my long term plan is to add to cold storage". 4000USD per bitcoin is VERY far from that scenario.
I just took a look at the daily threads for r/cryptocurrency and r/bitcoin.  

Oddly enough, people seem to be fairly bullish at r/cryptocurrency. Posts calling for sub 5k being downvoted. 

r/bitcoin seems a bit neutral/slightly bullish. Saw a decent amount of “all in” posts. 

Not sure why there’s so much despair in here tho. Pretty strange to me. 
all these people getting emotional is making you emotional. Stop it guys!! 
Practical and kind words there my friend. A lot of the sentiment comes from the fact that people thought market cycles were getting shorter. So it'll drop then bounce then drop etc. I'm not sure there's evidence to this. Market will take its time. And another thing is "invest what you're willing to lose" - so I'm ready to hold to zero. Either in that wait I make some money or lose an amount which I can make up. Honestly I'm trying to study the true dynamics of this market. It's so different from equities, it's fascinating. Why IS the price dropping at this point? Until then, have a good Friday people. 
Hah. I've stopped commenting a while back because, really there's nothing much to say. I think BTC is just fine I held mine, everything in cold storage. Haven't sold any. Traded some random ALTs pump here and there to accumulate BTC. 

People thought no normies are buying these days. Guess what, my wife started buying from 7.5 and step up buy orders all the way to 4k. 

Normies are buying but the market right now is not about normies. Its the whale traders market. Both bear and bulls are playing their games. Everyone should just chill and wait till all this to blow over. 
Like MikeXBT pointed out to me, I think its because we haven't spent much time under 7k at all during these past 6 months, and the few times that we have, sentiment was pretty bad. We've been dropping like a brick for 2 months straight now with no relief, bear flag after bear flag with no buy side action/volume, we had a decent bounce off 5776 but we broke 6k once again and I think that was enough to break a lot of people's hopes. Personally for me I am still waiting for a relief rally and my sentiments are at their worst when we are bear flagging, not when we're dumping. I need to secure more of my profits, but I refuse to sell after 8 weeks of absolutely no relief/correction. I'll wait it out.

But it's still kinda weird just how bad the sentiment suddenly got. 
Im just glad we got here eventually, it could have taken longer. Your observations are just confirming the idea that the capitulation phase is near. Im thinking that a drop to sub 5k will be the end for many optimists in this space and people who bought at 5 or 6 k and are at a loss. The quicker it comes, the better IMO
We haven't had new lows you got I think in terms of Plus or - 10%. Day traders react to a move barely below the low. But they don't account for much of the capital.

Bigger players wait to see if the law is definitively broken. Self look for the price to get to around lol 5000 before you see any kind of reaction.  Not that you can't see your reaction before then book getting too low 5000 without any reaction would indicate that there is not many whales to be shuck out.

Although that close to a natural boundary like 5000 could get people to wait till I move below that Before they make a big decision

> Did you guys really not prepare for this?

$8200/ $7800
2 weeks. 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/btSCuasQ/

since $9.9k we have failed to go higher than like 62-63 on 4hr rsi. so far in these past few months, when 4hr rsi gets overbought, it's indicative of a correction upwards- a medium term relief rally that lasts 2-3 weeks. 
Rally or reversal is always "possible"...every second of every day.
We need to run to another time when the general public has a reason to buy back in. 
imo we need to test 5k or a bit lower before I can become more optimistic about a possible reversal. 
daily closes in an hour from now
What are you learning? That the market is capricious and opaque and that there are forces larger than you who have an interest in you losing money?

All jokes aside, good trade, currently have a short open from 6800 but although it makes sense to add at 6200 I think I'll save myself the chance of a shitty weekend and watch it a bit more. 
the 20d ema is basically lined up perfectly with the downtrend from $10k, it's interesting
Both. Good chance it will get pumped higher and then it will dip back under 6k.
I’m guessing that it will dip back under short term.
I would not buy a dip under 6k, it should hold above 6250 if its bullish, i think
It will go back down.

bullish
Not yet, everyone sees this bear market continuing, we keep going lower, people arent going to jump in yet. 
I hope that too. But I am stuck in what sloppy call's  "panic hodling".

However we have seen the same behavior at 8k, 7k and now sub 6k. How often can this be repeated?

I am waiting for a short term bull rally ever since.
this meme has been around as long as this thread...
My perspective is that the post-bubble cycle of up/downs (dec-early june) and more violent 'barting' finally ended. So we are in a new territory here and the prolonged sideways grind we've been through supports that. There were significant buy walls at least on Bitfinex at least at 6700 and then at 6350-6400. Several thousands units were bought. Yesterday the fight for 6000 was tougher than most expected, fairly balanced at Bitfinex: https://i.imgur.com/kfuHBtv.png (12h period or so). Today Bitfinex so far has been balanced again. The downtrend prevails but players of all sizes who are not afraid of buying are clearly visible. Note 5820 here: https://i.imgur.com/zYLSXen.png (8h period or so)

In overall, this looks like a mash-up of both accumulation, price discovery and the struggle of downtrend at the same time. If you're a degen scalper, short the fuck out of it. If you know what to do, short with care. If you don't and/or are long-term holder, hold to avoid making mistakes. If you're a longer term investor, perhaps longing here would work out for you too. My projection would be that the turn of the trend will happen soon (late july?) but there's a lot of time to 'bind' in the meantime.

The last time we were at this RSI level in 2014 was a couple of weeks before the final capitulation week, which caused the RSI to drop below 30 and BTC to lose almost another 50% of its value (298.5 - 166.4). The same move here will see BTC dropping to almost 3k by mid July.
the last bear market reached two times <30 weekly RSIs, why should it be different this time? weekly RSI is btw 41 ;)
Activities are slower and price moves at smaller scale than when bubble just got popped. It is a signal that we’re heading for “desert of despair” where everything will be boring for months.
could be hedge funds and whales accumulating BTC around 6K. Who knows.
Sorry off topic in relations to BTC. Do you buy silver? It seems like it hit the bottom of the bear cycle.

Good lord, man. That's a heck of a stack increase.
you made an x13 on this trade, with fees maybe only x11, I would be curious on how your stack was on this bet, but nice gamble ;) congratz!
was this a memo to yourself?
I've been naked since $12k
Yeah we are at the point that everyone doesn't want to miss the bottom, but also they don't want to short the bottom as well.

Tough calls to be made if your not already in a position!
Just take a look at the bigger picture. We  (including stop hunters) are being hunted by strong downtrend. Broken 5.7K is just a matter of time.

ATH support is a few hundred lower from here, but until then there is nothing to stop this bleeding.

Yes. Also, remember that if you open positions in perps instead of futures you might incur funding fee. Right now shorts pay longs for example.
Take it a step further and use post-only to get paid to post limit orders 
it prevents/forbids to execute accidentally as market order (it is cancelled) if somebody frontruns you or orderbook changes
If you check post-only, they operate as limit orders. If you uncheck, they operate as limit unless you enter a price that executes as market (at or above/long below/short current spot).
Once you stop seeing it as a market and start seeing it as a pump and dump scam, it makes much more sense.
people shorting the bottom realized the price was going up really fast,

fwiw, bitfinex shorts went down about 2.5k, bitmex open interest went from 94.3k 36 hours ago to 78.8k 20 minutes ago

https://www.tradingview.com/x/pg8Vpjg3/

The dropping ratio against BTC is probably going to continue. If bitcoin is going sideways and Eth is falling off a cliff, I don't see why Eth matters to BTC.
IMO, BTC needs to gather quite a bit more in total crypto marketcap before a reversal can take place.
> That's not what bitcoin's about, it's about long term value storage.

you mean a peer to peer electronic cash system?

Yeah, the masses definitely all decided simultaneously to spend big bucks on btc, then they all decided not to, and then they all decided to do it again...
Be patient. The price will be <6k again...when? I don't know but this bear market isn't finished in my humble opinion. You sold the local bottom, people were panicking and you missed the opportunity to sell higher but this shit happens to everyone. 

I honestly don't see this going higher than 7700 though.
I feels ya bra
Don't be so hard on yourself, sitting at \~5800 no one really *knew* what would happen next. 
I'll take that bet. Not neccesarily because I disagree with you but because if I am wrong I don't have to give you a huge amount but if I'm right, I will earn $20,000 or more.

It may go back to $20K when when $20K has the buying power of $100 today, when the USD eventually collapses.  And if you think that is gross exaggeration, look at Venezuela or Zimbabwe, where hyperinflation was even worse.

But will 1 BTC ever have the buying power that it did at the start of the year...maybe, but probably not.

Anyway if you think it's over, then short BTC...to hedge / box in your holdings, if nothing else.  Or just sell and gtfo and enjoy the shitshow from the sidelines.

Because everyone becomes convinced that the current direction = the final direction. Just like now, I’m seeing so many posts expecting the bear market to be infinitely long and never recover. Stupid not to buy right now IMO
Dude as annoying as you are with your bull posts, I still don't want to see you lose money (or anyone for that matter).
Don’t worry, I’m still holding a small long from 7200
Bottom selling doesn't tend to work out. You didn't sell the top. That just means you don't have any extra cash to buy the bottom.

Get your head right and make a decision when you're not feeling emotional.
Trying to get out on a bounce is stressful, time consuming, and potentially unprofitable. 

Make a plan, set some stop loss orders or limit orders, check back in a few weeks. 

Ignore anyone telling you this is the bottom, they're speculating and don't want you to sell. People been calling the bottom since january

If you wanna get out, just get out. 
Stop looking at this thing for couple of weeks and do something you'd like to do if you had free time - there will be another opportunity to sell whenever it bounces from the next "bottom" and considering we so tight, it will be higher than current prices.. (hopefully)

Bear the emotional pain my friend.. 
Why didn't you go short at 8k ?
Looks good you are a monster.
I was talking about a 1-2 month long rally to $8,500 or so for a few days now. 
bitcoin = max pain, always has always will.
C'mon now, there's been plenty of talk of going up (and not just bullshitting), with people most commonly citing targets from 6000 to 6800.
The results are in boys! Set stop losses at 4899 and go to sleep until 2020 
Yeah, I’m honestly a bit surprised to see so many people longing here, but it’s not unreasonable to close shorts here, considering we’ve now dumped from $10k to $5.8k without a significant relief rally. I’m sure many are just trying to protect their profits, as we are likely looking for a short-term bottom within the coming days/weeks even if we are likely to continue further down in the medium-term.

In my case, I know I’m not particularly bullish, but I’m gonna start scaling into some longer-term buys the closer we get to $4k. I doubt I will ride any shorts sub $5k though, just to be safe. The lower the volatility gets, the more I believe we are approaching a long-term bottom.
Yeah, I'm in the same boat. As much as I hate to be responsible,

!short XBTUSD close 5881.6
Missed the ! in the command 
RIP
Ouch >< Did you have a tight SL?
I thought you were supposed to be bullish?
Great entry
This is one of the most insightful charts I’ve seen in days. Really puts things into perspective. Thanks
It doesn't *have* to hit that trendline. Note that there are only two touches, and that the bubble of 2013 didn't even come close to grazing it. It'd take big cojones to base your position off that line
Nice. We're still on track for cheaper coins.
Oh you still have a wife after all of this?

Lucky...
Bitcoin is pretty much an experiment. Nobody knows if the price will ever recover let alone when. 

Its role and function in the world is still being formed (p2p cash, store of value, hard money, etc..) and I find it wise to disregard anybody telling me anything about its future (outside of a probabilistic framework)

Having said that, I am a long time holder that is heavily invested in BTC.

Well a lot of people expect the price to drop to 4k and if it doesn't hold then 2k. I do believe it will recover as believe the price will be 100,000 in 2019 after it recovers.
1) even if you have free electricity btc is hardly worth mining anymore, its value has fallen too low for the hash difficulty. Sell the hardware you have asap.

2) No it will not ever really recover, anyone who tells you otherwise is invested too deep and has a bias.

3) absolutely it did. Many in here are those who bought when it started to get popular. Some witnessed the bubble pop and sold with it, sadly others held on hoping to this day to see it again...
They are idiots...

No, really, they were on premium for bigger part of the drop, went on a discount for some tiny amount of time and now again almost no discount.
people don't want to short the bottom, june expiry means futures converge to spot, funding rate is back to normla and sentiment is probably shifting a bit (people getting comfortable with low prices)
Last I checked the volume on futures was too low for it likely more than a red herring. On mobile now so can't look it up
Yessir, also present on normal RSI and the second one on OBV.
I'd argue for three touch points on the bottom of Stoch RSI for confirmation, but as a potential formation, sure, it could be worth a punt.
If anyone here hasn’t watched Andreas Antonopoulos videos, do yourself a big favor and search for him on YouTube. He’s a bitcoin ~~maximalist~~ fanatic through and though, but what he talks about from a technical perspective is grounded in reality and code. Also watch his Q&A’s, they are amazing. 
ETH has BTC dumping it and stealing market share because, well it seems to be the oath of a trader to do so whenever BTC dumps, and it has EOS dumping all over it constantly.
Looks like short volume dried up. Closing leveraged shorts. Nothing fundamental.
i put short at $6287 before the second BGD, because i thought its going to dip a bit  
went to play dota, lost the match, get liquidated
Alt-coins, and another one, and another one

(And a-nother one)
At some point? Yes.

Is that point now? Who knows...?
Honestly, as long as people are asking this and getting upvoted for it, I feel like it's not really true 
And then you realise that this sub is not representative of overall market sentiment... 
If it does, everyone will take notice it's going up so it might reverse to the opposite direction
This is not even close to bearish euphoria, but certainly there is bearish sentiment.
DCA is more in the realm of investment, not trading. And it has not been shown to work. Maybe it reduces stress in some cases. Don't confuse it with building a position progressively which has other motives and techniques, and applies to large positions. Real traders don't give a sh\*t about DCA.
I agree... I dont think we’re done dumpig, but sub 3k seems highly unlikely regardless... If this isn’t the bottom, we are max 2k away from the bottom if you ask me
Yup. No better time to prepare than yesterday! 

IMHO, participating in the market and nibbling down is the best move with these prices. In the long run, no matter where the bottom is, we all believe that at some point or another, BTCs going back up. Best prepare for it now. 
Wouldn’t that be considered Up cost averaging (UCA)?
Hoping for fireworks on the 4th.
Agree if you're leinent with wicks. I think wyckoff accumulation is still in play as well, but just with this being the first ST of phase B. I was never convinced by the 9k trip after the first 11.8k AR being the end of phase A but rather felt the 6.4k trip a more believable one.

Would greatly extend the time frame of wyckoff accumulation though, putting it in line with your volatility theories.

Of course it's way too early to say any of that with a degree of confidence.
Would you count that top as 3 touches or 2?
Nice catch.
Hahah that’s similar to the falling wedge I drew a few weeks ago, with a different resistance line above. Still waiting for the volume profile to confirm this formation though. Otherwise, we could continue to grind down descending support.
...which typically means what exactly?

Ask yourself, is BTC the peer-to-peer electronic cash system the whitepaper envisioned?
It is a cool proof-of-concept for a bunch of mostly old techs mashed together. It has gone nowhere tech-wise in ten years, and people are still trying to figure out some way of shoehorning it into people's lives, which is not how successful, *paradigm-shifting* inventions take hold. There is no reason for joe public to use it instead of fiat. Monero took over its illicit use-cases. 'Store of value' is a tough sell to people who have watched it plummet 70% this year--just because it is 'deflationary' doesn't mean that in practice it will hold its buying power any better than government-backed fiat.

That is to say nothing about how hideous it is for the environment, and how this only gets less efficient--the solution to maintaining network integrity is essentially 'unlimited electricity' (genius!). Or how it would grind to a halt if any meaningful fraction of the population tried to use it as a currency.

Until the average person is compelled to trade their fiat for bitcoin *because bitcoin is more useful to them than that fiat*, staring at the chart and hoping for early retirement will depend on the greater fool theory.

It is still a good casino.

(*braces for impact*)
I don’t see a problem with people using BTC to buy and sell drugs, it’s a use case after all. Unfortunately they are using Monero for that
Yup. I've got Bitcoin at 60.38%.
same games as last time, "This is it! BUY! Everything you rationally planned out in the prior days is now invalidated because a millionaire did a market buy! Don't miss out! The train is starting to chug!"
this is only a couple % gains. For a real BGD that I'd actually care to notice, it would need to go up at least 10% in a couple of hours 
I've been mostly numb during this 70% decline, a 5% increase isn't changing that. Like most are saying, let's get back to the 50% decline mark (10k) and i'll allow for a speck of excitement. 
I think we're most likely to stop at the support turned resistance of the old triangle should we get there around 7200. But maybe now that we "completed" that break out from a TA standpoint it's less relevant.
yes new lows are possible, but we were due for a relief rally 

now if this doesn't manage to get above $9K, we'll be going to new lows 
big green pump, and right back to sideways
Remember, no position is a position. (you don't always have to be in a trade)
Just curious. Your comments seem to be very grim about the prospective of bitcoin, why would you have cold storage of bitcoin if you don't believe in it?
low effort !!! ... just the stuff i like
I'm guessing you're referring to that ETH/BTC ratio that's getting hammered recently... LOL
Pls my familia.
Could be as soon as 460 blocks from now.

The best time for miners to act is at a new difficulty adjustment period when BTC is at a low price.


Well, I mean... Brock Pierce... 

I don’t really trust a crypto currency being shilled by a former child star who dresses like Crocodile Dundee. 
Who thought EoS was a "sure thing" project? Do those people need help?
I don't know why people don't seem to have a good BS detector. There are so many projects out there that intuitively hit me to avoid. BTC and ETH seem to be the most solid IMO.
On the flip side I'm hoping that decent launches this weekend... VeChain and Ontology may help a tad. 
He’s a disgusting fraud. Monero + BTC. Only stuff worth holding. 
Lol, everyone on Reddit has been shitting on EOS for a year now. Why would "a shitty mainnet launch" (it really wasn't shitty) affect all of crypto? People expected much worse. Also, Dan writing a new constitution is a good thing, he's doing what the community wants.
Well all the fucking idiots had to dump $4BILLION into this garbage. Now it can't be ignored. 
Does anyone believe this stuff

Nice try but this made it too unbelievable

Edit: wrong sub, IQ here too high to believe the authenticity of the story


Thanks for sharing your perspective - I agree with you in terms of stage of the market cycle and how early all of us are. Good points about being able to emotionally digest the investment.
>We also agree, that this market is not comparable to the last bear market in 2014

Nice post. I'm with you until here. If you mean in terms of length of the cycle, I agree, cycle appears to tighten. But in terms of market psychology and technicals it sure looks pretty similar from here.

Personally 2014 was a huge misstep for me and I'm looking at this pull back as one of the last opportunities to build a solid position.
Thanks for this post - will be sharing with my group of small crypto investors that have been around for similar time frames.
This is nothing new, and almost always happens, though? It drops faster and climbs faster.
Damn. You is right. Fall from mock-grace.
There will be no relief rally, that already happened
Wait till Monday... Gap will need to be filled... Or something..

you have your plan, if someone doesn't have it now his best choice is don't do anything and hold

Lol
i plan to start exiting, at least part of my stack when mining doesnt give a whole bitcoin anymore, i think thats smarter as any € amount.
19Q1 is aggressive if that happens.
So an implosion event involving tether would mean people selling btc and alts to get more tether?
Silk Road crash was to around $80 from a top of $260. We're already past that percentage wise.
Hmm.  So BFX usd technically usdt, or is that a rumor?  If there is a run on tether and crypto prices spike vs tether, will it happen on bfx?  If so, will they actually devalue your "usd" or will you get to have your cake (inflating crypto prices) and eat it too (not have your "usdt" devalue since it's supposed to be actual usd)
TLDR: Tether will implode lol
Ed Seykota:

"Win or lose, everybody gets what they want out of the market."

I still have not figured out what I want. But I think it is the excitement that keeps my mind occupied and prevents other more worrisome thoughts from gaining traction.
Snap the fuck out of it and stop feeling sorry for yourself. Many many people have lost a lot of money, there's nothing unique about your situation. You knew the market was volatile when you got into it, and yet here you are. Just as the price brutally crashes, so does it rise from the ashes, time and again. I've been in this market long enough to go from paper rich to paper poor many times over. Do you need the money \*right now\*? Yes? Well then, you fucked up. Cut your losses and move on. If not then delete the fucking ticker app from your phone, unsub from this forum, and get your life in order. Clean your house and car, focus on your job, learn a new skill (music is a great one), spend time with those special people in your life who you've neglected while uselessly watching the price rise and fall, go on a trip. Worrying about things you cannot control is what drives a man to insanity, and insanity leads people to do insane things.
Pfft, please, I didn't sell Tron at its peak.
Your best bet is probably to HODL at this point.

Also, what %age is your loss? If it’s 10-20%, no biggie. If it’s closer to 50% or more, then seriously... just HODL 

But it may very well get a lot worse before it gets better
I reduced my exposure (while in profit though, so not quite the same situation) and started trading with whatever I left in the market. 

Probably not a good idea to sell now, but you could try doing a few trades with “x” amount to mitigate some losses. It’s no guarantee but it could be worth it. 
You see all those people in this thread saying all is lost? That mean the reversal is near
There is no more mental support here, man. All optimism seems to do at this point is enable people, so i'm going to give it to you straight:

#This is fucking bad. Real bad. Like dick stuck in a meat grinder while you are high bad.
Hope you're holding actual btc and not a margin position? In that case just HODL and wait a few years. You'll be fine, don't worry. But for now maybe take a break from crypto altogether for a while. If you need some of that money, then sell off a little bit.  
I've been in your position(even worse) and I made it all back, all it took was patience. 
I got out a few days ago with more than $15k loss. I don't trust the price in the short run.

But I'll buy back in when I see a true reversal. I'm still convinced that the technology will be successful in the long run. And that it will be reflected in the price. But it might take a while...

At least I didn't tell anyone about my *investments*. So, I'll just keep quiet while I stomach the loss. But it's not easy. 

I feel you.

The only real reference we have for alts in the toilet after the peak of all peaks is 2013 and back then there were only 40 or so in total around the peak. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20131201/

The only two still in contention to refer to from 2013 are LTC and XRP. LTC managed a 97-98% fall. I can't be bothered to check XRP. 

All the others have had the luxury of arriving after that and becoming the plaything of bored bitcoiners and then riding the elevator to the stars. 

Now there are getting on for two thousand. It's uncharted territory and I'm really intrigued to see how much devastation there's going to be. 




Bitcoin is the only coin worth anything imo
VENGANG VENGANG VENGANG

Gonna track my wine on the blockchain!


How could this possibly go wrong? 
Wait until the SEC drops the hammer on most these shitcoin ICOs. Even the best alts in 2014 fell 98%, most never going near their former glory again. Might be an expensive lesson for people to hold mostly BTC and ETH

I remember getting in arguments on r/cc about them saying cryptocurrency was "wealth creation". No, crypto is not creating wealth out of thin air..

LOL why EOS? Are you an ETH maximalist? EOS with the warchest that it has can easily survive this bear market, for years even.
I got news for you, the whole world is weighted in certain people's favour. You just have to learn to play the game
It's easy to get frustrated from it- but a lot of smart people closed their shorts earlier today. If it's so unpredictable how are so many people seemingly getting it right a lot?

I totally get you though. 
Longer time frames, you can still use TA.  Of course shorting at 17K because the chart said to do so would have worked.  But on shorter time frames, the market is extremely manipulated, even moreso than last year, when it was almost certainly artificially pumped to $20K.
Another way to look at it is that the market liquidity is incredibly small for an immature new asset. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
Bitcoin Futures expire today. So no really a surprise 
So lets just cut to the 4th wall: historically after such pumps what is the behavior of the whale(s)? Should we expect them to repeat themselves?
* market up: artificial joke

* market down: organic sell

SFYL
Someone put up hidden ask walls that were bought into, not exactly a dump. Interesting trades though. The seller opened leveraged shorts while the buys were mostly cash and they were quick to take the liquidity.
[deleted]
The green days have been weak as hell.  +1.02%, +.64% then BOOOM.  -6.2% in 24 hours and then -14.7% in 7 days.

I'm at the end of my rope...
mmm I don't know, the wording implies that this change is primarily for straightforward vanilla ETF's, it explicitly states that complicated or leveraged ETF's would continue to see additional scrutiny. I'd bet you they would consider a crytocurrency ETF to be "complicated".
Someone is opening massive leveraged positions, both long and short, shorts are increasing much more though.
Look at shorts.
Is "BTCUSDLONG" the # of buy walls waiting to be filled? 
Well that's a pretty surefire indicator we are dropping soon
Wow, it’s amazing how this “news” comes out at critical resistance points.... every freakin’ time.
ouch
They didn't even look at the order books, they have no idea what they are talking about
\>Tether FUD

I dont know, whenever the media raises red flags about tether it has always been the best decision to Tether up since most fiat gateways charge a hefty fee back and forth and BTC and friends end up tanking.
The fake news outlet #1 for crypto, move along

The whole "hurr durr muh analysis about market event X" is so extremley boring and unproductive, I refer to this quote from Trading in the Zone

>Why do you think unsuccessful traders are obsessed with market analysis. They crave the sense of certainty that analysis appears to give them. Although few would admit it, the truth is that the typical trader wants to be right on every single trade. He is desperately trying to create certainty where it just doesn’t exist.

Disoriented. Unfriendly. Hostile. Evil. 
why people think 29k longs is low and 33k longs is suddenly "crazy amounts of longs".

While there is some correlation for sure, its definitely not that crazy of an outstanding margin position.
Sept futs discount is at $20. A lot of people hope that this is a bottom.
I'm no trader, I buy, hold, spend a little so excuse my ignorance but I understand charts to a certain extent and that looks just like the bottom end (phase 3?) of that Wycoff chart thing that's been doing the rounds. I could, and probably am a million miles off however.

I dont understand how someone gets upvoted for trying to convince people to sell at the lowest point we have had since 8 months and a 70% retrace from the ATH. If you dont look at the numbers but the actual developement of the crypto-market there is most likely only one way this is going longterm and thats up. People really tend to overestimate the effect of cryptocurrencies in the short term but are almost incapable of estimating the extreme effect it will have in the long term.
These type of comments are the strongest buy signals imaginable. 

People seem to have forgot what bitcoin can do. I guess it's been awhile. A lot of folks are going to be caught with their pants down when these thing decides to reverse. 
In my opinion what did you expect really? We've had like 6-8 red weekly candles with weak to no bounce whatsoever. There are rsi, mfi divergences, the price paused and didnt come down further, the sell momentum is slowing. stop looking for conspiracy and look at what the chart is saying. I'm not saying we are going to fucking moon, but at least short term it's clear it doesn't want to go any lower. We'll see what happens in the next few days.
Honey Badger don't care.
agreed.  I know that people say that crypto is gambling, but I never thought of it that way in a literal sense until recently.  It's like, OK, I'll watch the market go sideways for a day, and decide if I want to take a position or not, and hope like hell that when someone does a 1000+ coin buy or sell that I'm on the right side.  There's no momentum to follow, it all happens in one minute.
You implying bears will be extinct? Is it good to have people constantly shorting BTC  leave?
Why is it sketchy?  Maybe some dude was waiting to buy thousands of BTC at 5700 for the last three weeks and it wasn’t getting there and he’s crushing whiskey and said “Eff it”...market buy.
I didn't see anyone complaining when we jumped $1,000+ on April 12th...???
Their intent is to "profiteer" from those moves.  They don't care if they eventually kill the market once they have gained all they can from it.  That is just logical self interest.
Some leave, some arrive. When the latter is in the majority, we have a bullrun. Look, much infrastructure has been built the last 6 months and there is no doubt that these forces will come together at some point in the not too distant future to actively work to promote increased valuation of the crypto market. At some point Bloomberg and Soros, etc. feel they have shorted enough and there is more money to be made going long.
so true, it really pisses me off, feels like being played by whales. I was in fiat and wanted to step in and than that. 
[deleted]
I very much agree but you aren't going to convince them no matter what you do or say.

Wyckoff is a real phenomenon - it's possible to view the market as an aggregate "person" you're playing against - but there's a large gulf between that and actually thinking there's a group of whales truly controlling things behind the scenes.
Yeah, think logically: price hardly moves at all, sideways on low volume, then giant green / red candles out of nowhere? Makes total sense, certainly not people with a lot of money able to move the needle. If these green candles were the summation effect of buy pressure you would see it walk up, not shoot straight up like a laser followed by some more abrupt sideways and another laser. 
Please explain Barts
Somebody eli5 this senpai speak for me?
Wasn’t this only a 2% bounce? 

First bounce was around 8%. 

Does it make you super salty that I shorted all the way down and closed at 5866?

Umm, you realize you were one of them..? Lots of those shorts are hedges which is essentially what yours was.

>Pretty crazy story.. people lost millions 

AFAIK Coinbase made their users whole. 
they repaid everyone
I was there, kicking myself for not setting low af buys
Yes I remember it well and it is silly they refunded people on that because nothing weird happened other than noobs not understanding how stop losses work.
Watched it live, was on phone with a friend.  Didn't realize what was happening until later, thought it was a glitch & not a real-time event.
WOW, I never knew that happened. Insane story really. I hope that doesn't happen again lol
I remember it. I thought they reimbursed people for that though. Wasn't as bad as the ppl that got caught holding 9k BCH bags when Gdax started trading it
Yeah, I made $12k in 15 minutes. It was beautiful. The good old days.
I remember this wick on Kraken last year too, when the price of ETH went also very low and rekt many margin traders... just a bit after the ETH price hit 1k... dont want to be in the skin of these people...
Yep.

What is BGD? 
A lot of those longs have below 1x lev. A lot of people on finex use margin wallet to buy without margin. That's why longs can pile up and wait through dump.
I've been liquidated for weeks... long at 1x... (joking... kindof... I bought)

how you draw it is totally random. Option 1: Ignore wicks. Option 2: Dont ignore wicks. But not Option 3 Here I ignore this wick, but there I dont ignore it.

\>Where is your 'capitulation' price? (with no strong bounce)

Really depends on how we got the the price tbh. A quick dump to $4000 right now would be immediately bought up. But a low brutal grind similar to what happened these past 8 weeks would probably make the same price of $4000 to not have strong bounces.
I have already capitulated.
Is my capitulation price the price at which I will sell or the price at which I expect bottom sellers to sell?
1K
My maximum pain scenario would be sideways for years, low volatility, with the occasional bart. 
$9k, when that broke is when I GTFO and started learning to trade instead of trying to "hodl"
What do you mean "with no strong bounce"?
Never.  I sold some each doubling on the way up, and what I am holding now, I will not sell until $100k. If it goes to $0, it is money I can afford to lose.
its been happening all 2018...
i'm sure it will, eventually
I have a friend that all he did in the crypto space was going into Binance, seeing random shitcoin being pumped and going yolo because wow it’s mooning. He lost 10k and quit
Low liquidity pump + self-enforcing FOMO?
In the past, if you were an insider and had a good amount of shares that you wanted to unload on retail, you would pay a professional to conduct a pump and dump operation through wash-trading etc so that you could unload those shares on the market at a good price. 

In the unregulated crypto space, it is entirely possible that exchanges play the role of these operators to generate liquidity for ico project founders to get out or profit at the expense of retail investors. I have always found the exorbitant listing fees to be suspect, and in some cases, I have heard of exchanges such as bithumb requiring founders to give them a sizeable portion of the project's coins as part of the listing prereq. If you think about it, it is actually a win-win situation for both the exchange and the project founder, with the loser being retail investors like you and me. In environments where trading volume is low and lesser fees are being made from trade transactions, this is an additional way for exchanges to make money.
KEY is one of the biggest projects of 2018. Just because you know nothing of it doesn't mean it's some noname shitcoin.
> These company wouldn't invest money if they don't believe crypto has a future long term

while I don't want to pile on in this time of despair, these comments are a little misleading- just because people with a lot of money invest in something doesn't necessarily mean it will be successful.

Really smart, wealthy people have failed investments. No one has a 100% track rate. 

Not to mention, 2000% gains could be seen as "the success". Nothing about bitcoin would be a "failure" if it stayed at $3-9k for the rest of its existence


>These company wouldn't invest money if they don't believe crypto has a future long term.

You're correct in as much as it is in their best interests if 'crypto' succeeds. However, they make ridiculous money every day by ~~selling shovels~~ running a negative sum casino; they only need 'crypto' to survive, it is not essential that it flourishes.
But this doesn't mean the price will go up a lot

Note the amount of money/crypto flow into Bitcoin and Ethereum, and between then, and percentage of the overall influx for each on daily scale. Last 24h: According to the first chart Bitcoin noted around 5.1B of "money flow" vs Ethereum's 950M, including 320M between Bitcoin (~6% of its total) and Ethereum (~34% of its total). By "gravity' itself it's hard to imagine Ethereum moving Bitcoin in any significant manner.
Good evidence have been presented both ways the last days. It is possible that both are true at different times depending on the circumstances in the market.
Your third chart (Eth moves first?) shows Eth front running BTC by a 2-3 candles for every decline... Eth has been leading BTC down since May.
I generally set a total failure stop somewhere generously higher than I think any fakeout can reach for some level of protection against a random moonshot destroying me before I can get to my computer if I'm out, but then I have the ability to monitor to the minute throughout most of the day, so I make my real calls based on what's happening at the moment.
\>set a stop loss balancing the potential for a fakeout vs actual reversal

Bad idea lately tbh, you'll always get stopped out unless your stops are so wide to the point of being useless lol. IMO you should just make a decision at the current price then when the price changes the next morning or whatever evaluate based on your life circumstance on what you should do then manually adjust your position.
I too would like to see this.

I've been reading articles that declare bitcoin dead since May 2015.

Divs don't really have targets. Mostly just used to help recognize trend reversals on the time frame of the div but how large/long the resulting trend specifically is has a lot of variance. Obviously the higher time frame the divergence the stronger the resulting trend is likely to be (see bull div before rally to 10k).
Why is it that apparently, every single negative thing about Bitcoin is some sort of elaborate manipulation scheme?
Yes everything negative is a conspiracy against bitcoin.  The only reason to report on an incredibly shady company running a multi billion dollar business with the transparency of a rock is in fact to harm bitcoin.  Certainly there's no cause for concern at all and the fact that Tether have bald faced lies on their website, refuse to release an audit, and literally print money with no accountability is totally normal and everyone should remain quite and ignore it.
I swear to fucking God:

*Bloomberg has ties to Bitcoin whales*

Almost every fucking FUD article is first posted by Bloomberg. Why would they publish FUD? It's either

A) Want to push price further down

B) Want to accumulate at this price

people fudding tether just want to buy bitcoins cheaper. buy the dips guyz
Implied market cap. 

The entire crypto space necessitates a market cap similar to that of precious metals if it is to realise its potential as a value storage and remittance system. 

The price means nothing. 
This is not about crypto at all, I'd say, but rather more broadly about what constructs perception of value in our society. It's all made up, constructed, collectively agreed upon, speculated. This is a very good "story-ish" writeup about what consturcs perception of value.

Why you pay for an iPhone $1500 if production cost is close to $200?
Worth so much?  The crypto valuation is miniscule...more than an order of magnitude smaller than the tech bubble.  I ask myself why the valuation is so low.  I truly believe we will see a $10 trillion dollar cryptocurrency market in the coming years.
It shouldn't be. Why is Cardano still 10x where it was in October? The alt market is filled up with examples of that.
Future bro 
I can't tell you why it should be as high as it is now. But it should be higher than the current utility of the technology suggests, because it's a bet on the possible future utility of the technology.
I do wonder about concern-fud comments like this the price is dropping...what is your motive right now? Are you really looking for some answers as to why the valuation is "high"? what is "High"? relative to what? what do you think the valuation should be? and why? Are you seriously expecting someone to answer this, or are you posting it here to concern troll and fud when people's emotions are riled up right now. Did you short the market and need validation for your decision?

>So who's panicking?

People who bought at 8200 and believed you every time you incorrectly called a bottom.
Already covered below. I might actually join you on the long side of things. Traditionally I'm very bad at leveraged longs. 
keep in mind that's 16%

$5000 from $5800 is $10000 to $8600
Take it easy cowboy.

$5700, then $5500, then ATH line, then $5300.

Some big road blocks below us
There were a lot of people saying that breaking 6k would cause panic, it ended up not being a big deal at all. 
Diydude still bullish

Historically this means we're about to drop further 
Most likely a power bottom.

Cross your fingers.

To be honest though, we’re at a pretty low-volatility point right now. I would just convert to BTC, transfer, then cash out if you’re scared. Transfers honestly don’t take longer than 30mins - 1 hr on average.
I’m using LTC when i want to do that, takes a few minutes 
Just wait for some aggressive price action. After that BTC usually settles down for a bit.

Now wouldn't be a good time, though.
Doesn't kraken have usdt/fiat pairs?  I know someone Tues usdt / tusd
Do it piece-meal?
Just wait if you can, and sell it to BTC or ETH when the price stabilizes. If you think it’s going lower you’ll get more coin for your Tether.
Does the exchange you are tethered right now offer margin shorting? 
If you already have an account set up with an exchange that lets you concert to fiat (like coinbase) just do it.  It shouldn't take longer than 45 mins if all you need to do is trade to BTC, send BTC to coinbase, sell BTC for USD. 
Turn your phone sideways. Yes it is annoying to me too.
Coinbase Pro is absolute garbage. I have no clue why they would switch from GDAX, which was a far superior interface.
What combination of research chemicals are you on? 
Exactly right, it will go down until it can come back up. Lots of panic on here now, people doing the same thing as at 19k - expecting that recent trends will continue forever.

Herd emotion is easy to predict, but it still baffles me every time I see it.
Sigh. If only this hasn’t already been said 50 million times in the last 6 months. I want to believe it this time!
Brainless hopium.
You clearly don’t know economics 
You'll have more success with low-lev longs. I'm 6 for my last 7, and this is in the past two months when we were going down. We won't be going down for a while. ~6K was the bottom. Shorting now, you're effectively selling the bottom.

But hey, it's your money.
If by soonish you mean 12-36 months sure
maximum pain lol. What is maximum pain? Have you been reading this daily thread? How much worse could it get. I wonder what the sentiment will be like at 5200, 4800, 4500, 3900 etc...with a 4% drop this place feels like death. I've read a lot of daily threads from 2014 but this is definitely up there in terms of visible pain. There is literally a handful of positive posts here out of 300 comments. Its almost comical to the point I am wondering if people are just trolling.


Dude, shorts made out like bandit these past few months
20k --> 6k

Lesson learned not found. 
The absolute possible bottom is 0
Amen to that. And people need to realize that striking it large means having the balls for it.

I want to believe so badly... and I think that I do... unfortunately I'm already fully invested... so I can't help you guys out.
Both.  It can easily bounce a good bit higher, but still will eventually be a lower high DCB.
If it’s like the last few weeks, it’ll be a slow bleed back down then a jump off a small cliff. 5800 seems like support though.
it would be absolutely stupid to buy right now (as a trader) expecting another upbart.

When this thread starts to become largely a soiled meta meme of itself, I start to expect the market structure to collapse and things to go completely apeshit.

My guess is that means a break down of at least $1,000 on a drive to a completely new trading range.

I'm hiding my analysis under this terrible comment just so I can say I told you so to everybody in the thread later.
I don't know why you are downvoted. I think that's exactly the purpose, and that panicked coins are absorbed effortless by larger interests.

'Head and shoulders' is a reversal pattern. And since we're in a down trend it would have to be an \_inverted\_ H&S to mean anything.

My vote was for a capitulation at <$3k, only because I would assume we're heading down to re-test former ATH resistance at $1.2k. If we broke convincingly below $1k, I would probably start panicking for real.
I don't understand the question, you didn't give an option for "I will not sell at any prices lower than <>".  For example below 2k I'm buying, below 1k I'm buying big.

All is very well, thanks!

I've just been super busy (which unfortunately isn't likely to change in the immediate future).
This made me laugh, thank you!

If you follow my commentary, I have a consistent pattern of:

step 1: shitpost with an exit or entry point with a vague 1-sentence teaser of why I did what I did. 

step 2: post a more in-depth analysis a few minutes or hours later. 

I do this so that I can immediately lock in my position recommendation for anyone who is following my trades. Bitcoin moves very quickly sometimes, and the 30 minutes to 1 hour that it might take me to write out/chart out my thoughts could see the market move as much as 5% to 10% against the position I was holding. 

I've tried that in the past, and I've had mixed results. 

Ultimately, the best advice here is to just be patient and watch the market carefully. 

We won't get to $1,300 or even $3,000 in a single 12h candle. It's going to take some time and some chop to get to the bottom.
Agreed Mandy, but only thing that makes me strongly consider chewy's position is that $BTC's previous ATH was around $1,300, so would be ultra fitting to bounce off that previous high again.
It's often less reliable during strong trends, yes. However, that doesn't mean it's completely useless and should be ignored entirely. 

If you notice, I'm not switching to a long here. Merely locking in profits. 

I used RSI divergence as a potential warning sign for my short position. But I'm not using it as the end-all-be-all for the future.
That's kind of you, but I do get it wrong fairly frequently. 

My profitability stems more from my ability to manage risk than from my ability to extrapolate the future. 

That said, I am certainly pumped that I exited when I did. 
Nothing to see here, folks! Just imagine the volume!

There's difference between 'fuck it' when we drop rapidly and you expect a huge bounce somewhere and between 'fuck it' when everybody knew that another leg down will come.

But he's got a point. 5.4 is ATH support. We should bounce if we touch it. But... We may just grind over it until 3k like we do it since we broke it...
You're absolutely correct!
I think 5500 will be the bounce

I realize that my analysis is not clearly pointing to a move up or down, but the point of the exercise is to find potential long and short entries and exits (typically on a daily timeframe).  To put simply, risk:reward is not in favor of a long or short entry.  Longs should consider closing their losing position.

Can't adjust the aspect ratio. Cursor slips and you lose the portion of the chart you were looking at. Chart is 100% black. Volume is 90% black-gray. Can't even read it outside. Volume is not listed on the app interface.

Man, playing those divs finally payed. 
I closed my $5880 Sept long at $6286, though I obviously wish I had left it open a bit longer. I'm still net long at the moment (1x), but the second pump still seemed a bit fishy. It seems like we are going up because people are scared to short vs. wanting to buy here, but I could be wrong. Either way, I doubt we break below $5800 support anytime soon, so any longs from around there are likely safe regardless imo.

Congrats btw!
The Truman Show is a cinematic masterpiece that's superior to ALL of the garbage sequel/reboot trash that gets made nowadays. It presents an idea that's ludicrous yet just plausible enough to make you think about your own life from a new perspective. That idea is: what if your every move is being engineered for maximum entertainment to a worldwide audience through a TV show? Emotional traders think some divine force is out to get them as if they're in such a situation, but in reality, they're just getting played by the market makers who play the role of "producer" in these trader's lives. The market makers pull all the strings of emotion in order to get the results they desire, as if they're gods themselves.

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ug7w8/comment/e1hdd81?st=JJ056QZ8&sh=5178bc2f

I also stated in my post below that a lot of the better traders in this sub we closing their shorts, which is usually a decent indicator on when to close. 

I swapped long for a target of 6050/6300. I stated below it was bearish we broke below 6k, but the buyers are relentless and holding the price up well and we haven’t made a new low yet.

Also, I’ve never cried manipulation in my life. Frankly, I dont think I’ve ever posted about it in this sub.

What are you going to do?
I bought during the pump to 9.5k in May and just watched it go down.  I didn't sell, made too many bad trades, figured I'd just hodl until it comes back up.  And now I'm down almost 50% and still hodling.  Told myself "Should've sold at 9000....Should've sold at 7800.... Should've sold at 6800..."  If we could predict the future we'd all be rich. 

Now hoping I won't be telling myself "Should've sold at 5800" next.... 

Don't gamble if you're not prepared to lose.
I bought at 8k or so and sold in the middle of each drop. Idk.. this sucks should’ve left it all in the stock market 
That random pump got me liquidated. My order didn’t feel when it should’ve. But it’s whatever. I’ve learned some things on the way. Not much I can do now. 
I was scalping and I don’t set any sells when I sleep lost hella money when we dipped from 8k bc I don’t use stops

This is my thought process as well.

Once the volatility disappears for a period of weeks, it will start to look like a bottom as the price stabilises.
I'm surprisingly okay with that. Slowly build a position without stressing too much sounds pretty good to me right now.

Apparently you are the one who started the project. You weren't aware of [this fork](https://github.com/Tucsky/SignificantTrades)?

>Curious to know your 3-6-12 month market outlook if you have one and are wiling to share.

This market is fickle and could be moved significantly by a wide variety of news. Outside of that, I feel that the year long bear trend is intact. 
Someone with an agenda downvoting? Seems weird
Mike tends to do ~1% scalps on these pullbacks iirc.
Looks good, thank you, you're the man.
I fucked it up again, closing value is actually 5880 lol.
Yeah I thought this morning that December would open when June closed so I could open there. I was short on perps and opened in September for now. I'm trying to play on the divs see if they play out. Also the fact that this last few dumps have had lower volume. It might take a few days but feels like a relief rally is due.
Today it expires at 11am, my theory is that in the futures everyone is shorting and to reach their goals they do some OTC BTC selling to help reach the goal (with another theory that people sell BTC to trigger stop losses which will further drop the price)

Just a theory
On Bitmex, you have the option to short/long on a continuous basis (perpetual) with no closing date. However, you run the risk of paying funding fees. Conversely, you can short/long the futures, which is essentially a prediction of where people think the price will be on closing date, since you are forced to close your trade on that date regardless of price, and you only have to pay opening/closing fees.

Traditionally, when BTC is trending up, futures will trade above perps since people assume the price will be higher in a few months than it is now. Conversely, futures often trade below perps in a strong downtrend since people assume the price will be lower in a few months than it is now (people are clearly fickle with regard to price action).

What’s surprising here, however, is that we have been in a clear downtrend for weeks, but September futs have been slowly increasing from close to a $100 discount a week or two ago to a slight premium, without any clear reversal apparent yet. Not sure if this means people are just knife-catching here expecting a reversal, or there’s something else going on though, since futs usually don’t stop trading at a discount until a pretty significant uptrend has already been established.

I’m sure someone can elaborate more eloquently, but that’s the general idea.
Someone may be building a massive long position on Sept. futures.

OR

Someone may be closing a massive short on Sept. futures.

However Sept futures have not been around for THAT long, makes me think it's the former rather than the latter.

Yep and you have to stay logged in which is lame
Clear your cache?
If this was capitulation none of us would be posting.  I have a feeling that the price isn’t going to bottom quite the way people want it to...bc it’s BTC.  Everyone here is waiting for goblin town in the mid 3’s...I could easily imagine volume and volatility going goblin in the  5-6 range with false breakouts to ~7.5-8 that crash right back.  Imagine this same scenario playing out 3-4 times over 6 months...I think plenty of people would hang up their hats after that.  
Yes but what's the ATL of the long/short ratio?
Is 70% down not capitulation to you? Then we bounced a bit, retesting now, then a long slog until next bull
After capitulation comes diapers
I think we are pretty much there, give it a few more hours / days 
And l downvote you because you just admitted that you are a downvote bot that delivers downvotes to me automatically regardless of what I say. 
We're not going to Goblin Town. It's just a marketing gimmick. And next time we do the sub-6K tou, if ever, it will be much shorter and shallower.
That makes sense. When even the smarter people here start becoming convinced there won't be a bounce...we'll bounce

I just can't believe how bad sentiment is right now. Mike reminded me that we never really spent much time here though so I guess it's different because people didn't even have much time to consider what BTC at sub $6k means 
yea but, even if it took longer to get down here would people have really cashed out :P

I guess I'm just like what the heck guys you've had quite a while to prepare for this possibility 
[deleted]
Where did I say bottom soon or long term will be better? I very carefully avoided saying that because I don't personally believe it will be true.

you know me, I've been the most constant source of bearishness for the past 5 months here, you know I'm waitin for that sweet dump to $4.5k. 

That doesn't mean I don't feel bad for people here- I just think they should make a plan on what to do next. 
Possibly because bitcoin is finally at new significant lows below the beginning of the bull run whereas a lot of alts are still up above their pre-bull run numbers? Not sure. 

ETH at $420  LTC at $75 so...looks like they're throwing up most of their gains too

I think it might be a /r/buttcoin invasion
Your comment is making me emotional!! I want to sell everything im holding since 1 year
It's entirely sentiment driven- people got way too used to sentiment unification meaning a reversal because we were ranging. Now that we broke down I think people are gonna keep being surprised at how strong btc can trend 
Yea, I Read his comment after I wrote this and it makes more sense now. We barely had time to "realize" how low things were in February. it was barely any time under $7k and whatnot.

I really am astonished at how quickly sentiment has turned though- I feel for these people but it legitimately has me going "hmm" because the sentiment is just that bad.

To be fair, I read a quote once that said something along the lines of:

"be careful of getting too happy when the price goes up because when it goes down you will feel that same amount of sadness"

I suppose this is just the inverse of the euphoria we all felt...
It also often fake. People take advantage of the drama and this sub attracts all sorts of vote and comment wizardry when the markets are making a big move. Whether its a shill brigade, FUD scare or FOMO campaign, this sub gets weird sometimes and random people show up to spread a certain narrative. 

Don't trust it. Tag the good people, tag the bad people and don't believe the strangers. 
I never realized how true it would be that a new low would completely break people.

My stupid $5899 vs $10000 poll showed that at least quite a few people really expected $5899...so I'm like what the heck guys we've had time to plan for this 
Do you know how many people expected this to just be a minor correction and then btc would continue its bull run all the way to $100k? And when that didn’t happen so many were saying 6k was the absolute floor. I am NOT surprised
Yes it will. Any trips below 6k will be brief and not far under because, well, we've bounced off it so many times now. Anyone with two gray cells to rub together will see it as a buying opportunity. But I think we're going up for the next month anyway. Right now is probably the best chance to join the winning team and stop being a no-coiner loser. Because no-coiners will be the losers. He with the most Bitcoin wins.

This is not to say we won't see another super-stupid dump or two. People might get lucky with a short here and there, but the bottom is in, and this is pretty much it.
why do that when these shorts are paying off so well?
that would take a really long time to make a million that's for sure! but do whatever suits you best...
thats a pretty dang big bullish divergence there
oh you are right 
that u dont fuck with the CME mate. They wont let this go below $100b market cap smh 

$100b market cap strong support boyz
!short ethu18 .07042 100% 

shorting eth because I don't think the ratio will recover past .072, stops at around .073
Thanks for the response. And to others above. I thought about it all yesterday and clearly i was late
Unrelenting.
so same as 2017
Exactly why this is probably the bottom
He has capitulated.
Are you ok? It seems on a lot of comments you are replying with messages of doom and gloom, and yes while this may be the case, the sheer frequency of you posting makes me want to check you are ok. 
if that's the case, why aren't we at $4.5k already? that's my price to buy more.
Someone isn't drinking the koolaid like the rest. Nice
Just think of being in fiat as shorting 1x
Lol seriously. That and institutional investors/smart money 
I might be wrong of course, but at some point, whales **will be** accumulating and you will see a BGD.

What are you gonna say then?
Yep, we are far from despair. im looking forward to what the narrative will be december:) 
A whale is a whale because they accumulated 3 years ago.  Look what happens when a whale accumulates now.

https://www.coindesk.com/chinese-angel-investor-amassed-10000-bitcoins-amid-q1-price-slump/

Hopefully he sold when it hit 11.7.  All whale money is going into ICOs to find the next big thing.  Not into an asset that is already matured.

It was a 50xer now thats its well into profit moved to 100x
Honest question, what is the benefit of using the log chart?
if this happens, it would really be free money imho... from 10k to 3k without a bounce would be crazy..
Yes, but I generally aim for 90:10 gold/silver ratio to reduce volatility a bit, with overall PM exposure <10%. Definitely watching the gold/silver ratio at ~77:1 last I checked... Seemed to bottom out around 80:1. 

The Bitcoin/Gold ratio is fun to watch too, I think: 4.7:1 currently.
you mean funding fees? damn fees are that much?? 
Oops, wanten tot reply to an earlier thread. Fail!
That’s hot 
Yeah and everyone is jealous for that one ;-D. But now it's imho too risky..although i said that yesterday aswell and would now kill for that 6.1k entry...
the interesting thing is, regardless of what direction it goes, it seems like the market is giving us plenty of time to make a decision.
That means there's more shorts than longs on the perpetual swaps, right? 
Can you elaborate further on how that works? I couldn't find any info on the fees about that. Nvm found it. Maker fee, -0.0075%
Why shouldn't I always do post-only and get the maker rebate?
Thanks!

[I see a repeated test of the bottom wedge](https://prnt.sc/k0xyqz). It really wants to bust through that shit, it seems. I could see some sort of capitulatory event arising from that
Oh I just went numb seeing it that way. 😥😰🤧😑
Reversals in eth/btc have been a signal for general alt/crypto confidence that we've found a bottom and preceded a BTC rise. There are often fake outs though. Can't verify on charts rn on mobile

Edit: right on time, eth reversed a few pct before this BTC flare up pump
Projects like Cardano need to get back to pre October pricing, too.
well it's about money. we're in the store of value stage now, still bootstrapping that, and that is a necessary precedent for widespread medium of exchange. medium of exchange will take a backseat until gresham's law is totally played out with other monies. until then, bitcoin's biggest advantage is being able to own an undiluting piece, being able to take delivery of digital money with your own computer.

It is truly unique.
Thanks for the reply and the feedback, I do, or am striving to publish on Steem everyday M-F with Monday covering basics from the weekend. 

I'll be attempting to release by around 11 - 12 est everyday to make it a useful mid-morning/lunchtime cap off for others. 

Are you active on steem as well?  It looks like I got a decent response so I'll keep dropping publications here for a while. 
It's seemed pretty quite during this bearish time.  I'll be glad to finally contribute something instead of just lurk.
I don't think I even realize I'm using it wrong.  
Here are the following sections that use publish or a form of it, 

*The Daily Dimes: A CryptoNews Publish*

*As a result I've found that by publishing*

*The Daily Dimes is a publish where I post an aggregate of news*

*In case you haven't been inundated by it yet, there was a report published*

*If you'd like to support the Daily Dimes news publish* 

*....addresses below to support today's publish.*


If you'd be willing to help me understand how to use this word better I'm definitely open to learn.  Thank you.


Thanks for the reply, would you be willing to pull out some copy/pasta of places where you're perceiving a bullish biases. 

I'd like to maintain a more neutral narrative in general, and keep commentaries pertinent to the situations I am commenting on.  I'm not trying to press a bullish or bearish narrative in general.  

Thanks for your response, I'll appreciate the help.

This guy options 
Best of luck man. I doubt you're right.
This is not capitulation. 
I doubt it. I have been in Crypto for a long time and i've never seen this.
But i've been around for cycles. I've never seen a cycle like this.
Ditto, I'll take the bet for 20 bitcoins.  There are some extremely trustworthy escrows - we can do it safely 
The problem is if enough people lose interest in Crypto, there won't be anyone around to care about the halvening, man.
Yeah, being addicted sucks. But it's so sickly this year.
I wish man. And up till this point, I was right there with you guys calling bottoms.

But it's not going to hit the bottom anymore. It's going to fall further and stagnate. 
USD is getting stronger in general not weaker
Yeah, I closed at like 18.75

But more like stupid for not selling at those prices
I completely agree it’s foolish not to buy now
Someone has to lose for someone to take profit.
what makes you think this is the bottom?  It could easily fall another 50-80% from here.  Though obviously he should have sold much sooner, selling today could still save him a lot of money
Chances are he won't be selling the top neither. 

If he needs the money for whatever rational reason, it's much better to sell instead of speculate about a potential bottom.                  
I took time off at 8k, much needed break from crypto since I'd been in from '11
I've been believing for a bit now that due to the amount of true believers and whales still around, and owning a larger pct of BTC, both hoping to prop the market up at key points and a persistent DCA/BTFD mentality, a slow grind is more likely than getting the satisfaction of a singular capitulation wick and return to bull. I've been hoping and leaving shorts open longer just in case there is, but profit taking is proving more prudent for me. Still think we're too early for most of the FOMO masses that got us to 20k to return--pain is too fresh. But the current participants can move us up through the four digits. Looking like it won't be that easy for bears or bulls.

Its role in the world is defined as per the whitepaper:

[Hmmm](https://i.imgur.com/yvu5kDf.png)
Foolish. You can’t say #2 with any certainty and history has indicated it rebounds just fine. 
Listen to this guy with your life choices. He wrote it on the internet and provides many reasonable reasons so he must be right. /s
He isn't really a Bitcoin maximalist. He's positive on ETH too.
as soon as I hear "maximalist" i'm going to avoid it, they are all incredibly unbalanced in their arguments
I thought he was an Ethereum fan as well?
This most recent candle was shorts closing, but shorts did not move much on the first so you are wrong there.
What kind've leverage were you playing with? I just logged in and I actually didn't get fucked but still in the negatives since I opened at $6150 over a week ago. My target has been $5650. 
That’s because you are euphoric

Edit: it’s a joke, I’m not being a dick I promise 
The statement “not even close” is pretty euphoric in itself :)
Bearish euphoria is like a $2k hell candle to $3800 in 15 mins. 
You are correct. Just used the opportunity to point out general mistakes people were making. Nobody should be eager to buy in a bear market. You’ll have plenty of time to get back in once supply and demand start equalizing.
It's a NO BRAINER :)
Why? What would be the rationale for being close to a bottom? Just because it hit 20k at one point and now that number “is so far away” doesn’t mean anything and is a common rookie investor mistake. Dotcom bubble was a prime example.
[deleted]
And this is why the market is dumping, only people left are holders and traders and all the traders are doing is shorting like some hive mind
I don't necessarily beieve we're going back up   I got in in 2013 but my belief in Bitcoin is almost all gone, there are many obvious flaws. My change of heart has been pretty profitable too.
It's Dollar Cost Averaging. Not Down Cost Averaging :p
Here it is on the daily on a linear scale:

I think you can draw it either way. We're still waiting on the volume profile to confirm the pattern (need to see volume increase substantially from here). Another leg down is possible still, for sure.
I agree. I think you can get higher resolution on the formation using the daily on a linear chart:

Bullish signal. Signals a reversal.

Note that to make a viable falling wedge you have to cut off wicks. I remain unconvinced.
It’s usually a good sign. Looks pretty good to me. Volume fits, several points of contact. Finally some new bull hopium.


We just have to wait and see if we’re going to bounce up to the upper line before we can really say it’s a falling wedge.
NP :)

Maybe he meant that out of the circulating supply of ~17M BTC, 20% of them are lost?
He means this: http://fortune.com/2017/11/25/lost-bitcoins/


He means folks literally lost the keys for their btc and they are forever out of circulation.  
The fact that you have positive karma for that comment must mean that we really are in the despair phase.
That is the exact string of words that blared in my moonboy brain back in April. Absolute verbatim.
Uhh, we're there now.
He same one that was 40% lower last time btc hit 6k?
not to forget he is an alleged pedophile
Brock Pierce has been out of Block.one for months.
If there is one thing that's sure about main nets it's the dump 😬

Bitmex saved my portfolio value my adding the eos futures, shorting every top. Next stop 6 dollars 
To be fair: the marketing was great.
I have seen it touted by a handful of people IRL and more on /r/CryptoCurrency as "the next ETH"
XMR
Trade the hype. I knew it was bullshit yet it was one of my best alt trades
It has made me more money in a year than Bitcoin has in 5 years. And it's still doing so - I bought some RAM one week ago and am currently selling it for ~5x gains. 
XMR and ZEC have decent fundamentals as well.

Edit: motivation is unclear. Account is 4h old.

There are actually a few of us in bitcoin!
Oi
It's reddits most liked term.
what's interesting is alts pumped before BTC
*right above me?*
> all we here know that this downtrend will reverse

We don't know that. We hope for that.
to show that he has a track record of being a voice of reason in times of emotional exuberance. It's not a bad point to make
I don't think his comment was meant to be a "Sell now or forever be doomed to be depressed!" but more of a "if you guys are that happy at $15k and this sad at $6k, maybe formulate a plan so the market doesn't whipsaw you back and forth over being depressed and euphoric all the time"
Agreed. But I see it as binary. We're either going to hit ATH in the next 6-8 months or we're going to grind lower for 1-2 years.
Depends how it goes down. SEC could just tell BFX that USDT needs to go away, and to let customers take their redemption in USD. Which would mean they need to convert to USDT (sell crypto, bearish) and then take USD.

It could also mean the SEC freezes BFX's funds, which whould create a run on USDT into crypto..

Either way more uncertainty means more risk imo
Gox was what, ~$180 down from $1000? Could we see sub 4k? Tune in next month!
Just the most likely scenario IMO. We need something to incite real panic if this isn't going to grind lower slowly over the next 9-12 months.
That's funny how people realized their loses just now. 6 months of down trend, 75% down from ATH, and just now they've realized that they lost a lot of money...
I did the same. Recognised a fraction of what I could have, but still made multiple times the gains one would make from a savings account.

I have just over 1 BTC left that I trade with to accumulate BTC, and will re-enter the market once we hit a period of the price moving no more than 300-400 dollars over a six month period.
I have been through quite a few harrowing crashes and I feel the same thing, we maybe have a few more soul crushing dumps, but I don't see how you can go dry powder at this point (unless you over invested and) unless you want to fomo back in around September. 
can't even disagree with you mate...I'm seriously astonished how quickly sentiment has turned o_O
Nice to see all the weak hands are getting shaken out.  It's almost time to start buying again.
Where did you come from?
Would you even say... It's zune bad? 
> 5- 10 years

Are we talking about the same market here? This is crypto, not the NASDAQ. I wouldn't be phased one bit if we were smashing new ATHs within a year.
Please don’t be so naiv

Hey, watch you’re tone 
[deleted]
You are so bitter its depressing. You want everybody to learn a brutal lession just to make you feel better. I tell you from experience seeing other beople lose does not make me feel better about my own losses.
The bottom for how long? A bounce for a month just to build up more dreams to crush? That's how you build despair.
EOS in same breath as ETH...that's stupid and ignorant.  One (ETH) is one of the innovative crypto's with the best developers and the other (EOS) is the biggest scam ever....come on and get your head out of your ass.  i own neither (bitcoin maximalist)
Because it's a clusterfuck that's doing everything wrong? War chests can't save you from stupidity.
Eos has 120k eth left
"Learn to play the game", the game is they decide what happens, you are at their mercy, and you cannot predict what they will do and when they do it. Sounds like a winning plan!
I am in a good position here, doesn't change my growing sentiment that this market is a joke. I could have just as easily been on the wrong side of this. 
If thats the case, then how are the whales manipulating everything?

Edit: /s 
In short: whales with unlimited fiat play the futs and buy the phyzz to make it do whatever the hell they want. 
Some probably keep pumping a stalled attempt, some probably sell immediately (barting?) when they see their FOMO failed, occasionally I guess they're impatient fat finger buys I guess but there's too much slippage for those to be great moves unless you have manipulation in mind. And of course you do--you want to make other people carry your water
none of the moves down happen that quickly though so he has a decent point
I made money on this trade, no loss here.
I saw that live as shorts and longs both rose. How do you tell the buys were cash?
no they will come sooner than you think (though we have waited for years), the futures market had to be in place first, and the big boys all want in.
Where do you see this?
Yowza. I opened another 1x short on swaps at 5880 this morning, but I might set b/e stops on that one. 
Wow it looks like the 23rd and the 17th of this month again. Both times it was a huge drop in price followed by a pop on the 24th and 18th.
no it's the number of longs open in nominal btc.

As in there are ~33000 bitcoin long on bitfinex right now. 
Everyone wanta to believe they are smarter than the majority ? 
Its interesting that you think this guy was arrested and convicted as a way to keep bitcoin down at a key moment. 
Fear not. It was a 5x short from 6440.
>bloomberg writes about crypto

>they have no idea what they are talking about

one implies the other yes :)
C'mon, who cares about the news. Trade the market. If news matter, there are those who know them before you and me, and the impact most of the time is already reflected in the market..
Look I think this quote is irrelevant to the subject, can you explain a bit ~~what you mean?~~ how it relates? You seem to be talking about traders?
ok thanks for the correction..I was on the wrong screen and fixed it.
This has happened every Friday, why are people worried. 
I rode that little wave on LTC from $ once BTC broke $6k from $76-$80 and am out waiting to see if volume picks back up again.
fucking buy buy then
Crazy high in relation to the amount of longs during the last 4 times we had a significant drop.
Remember that the real amount of longs is higher than what you can see on the chart, simply because you can go long without margin trading. I know you know that, just saying for other people. I will be on the watch for the rest of the day and see if there are any real moves to the upside (we are yet to touch any real upward resistance 10 hours after the drop), but I am selling as soon as we get to around 5800. 
What I learned in the last 6 months is that any kind of long term BTC prediction most often fails. The amount of money in BTC is so low that a few whales working together can paint the charts and manipulate in any way they want. People obviously think this is the bottom, (or whales made them think that) thus the amount of longs. They might wait until even more longs open before a huge squeeze and a colossal drop.
I giggled
Shit I’m not complaining.  I was buried from the other day and just got out for a profit.  Sold the top of that little run.  Felt like a broken slot machine there
well it's up like 6.3% over 24h, it just pumped a lot ...like 7% in an hour, would be like $6300 for btc
Not sure what this shows me?
there is a lot of try hard in this

https://imgur.com/a/EW5NZBX
It's partly because volume is not all that high in either direction. The price is just moseying around most of the time on low volume, even around significant price areas.

Maybe if you are on the one minute chart. Zoom out and if you can't spot the trend and where it gets fuzzy..well...
Traders in general who provided necessary momentum to get BTC to 20k in the first place, it doesn't matter if they have a predominate bear/bull bias.

Those same people will just leave to trade something else, which IMO is bad if you're a longer term Bitcoin bull because it means that this Bart Simpson price action will continue and just get worse over time which pushes more people away.

You haven't lived until you've fat fingered a $1MM market order.
Because Bart Simpson patterns like this have been happening continuously for the last 3 months? Idk I just don't take things like this seriously anymore, like if this grinds sideways for 24hours and then dumps again so god help me.
Yeah you're 100% right, I don't think they care about longevity or anything, the thing is how long does this happen before there is no more market left to play with? Eventually people will just leave.
He's right though. People will leave. Whether that is good or bad for bitcoin long term is to be determined. Lots of people want traders out of the market. 

I am personally getting bored of this market, it's the same thing over and over again. Intraday volatility is terrible and we've effectively been mainly going sideways for months 
We’ve literally bled like 2-3% over a few days with violent 5-6% down for like 6 months and you think a reversal is going to make people leave? K.
exchanges taking advantage of their traders info.

You're right. When I wrote that comment, I was presuming the bounce was going to continue. The last bounce took a good hour and a half or so.

If someone could flash crash BTC to 1$ I would put my life into it. 

Plz n Thank you’s 
Still pissed I didn't get in on that. 
Except for everyone that wants to buy before 10,001... Anyone looking to be in this market for years realizes this. It is quite possibly the most risky investment available, and the longer it stays around, the more credibility BTC accumulates. As we all know, it is all about getting the lowest entry.

Omg. Again this comment. Can you please explain why in the world someone would do this? What possible benefit is there for entering a 1x long position on finex instead of just buying BTC?
Nobody expects the spanish inquisition
I'm sorry but that makes no sense whatsoever.
i think when the market capitulates?  

That's a good question. I suppose I was theoretically asking (and I think most answering) what price *you* would sell at.
Yeah OP needs to clarify his question. 
I dont think he said that it guaranteed anything. He's right though. There are a lot of people with a lot of wealth entering the space even in a huge downturn. It's a good sign. 
In this particular case I think the companies making these investments are very smart, and I think they will become successful (i.e. Coinbase and Binance). But the more important thing to realise is that investment in exchanges has little relation or indication of price movement.

Exchanges are making money no matter what direction the price is heading. In fact, growing number of new exchanges, new offices etc. could be seen as incredibly bearish because such investments are some ways big short/hedge against the price.
More exchanges also = more on-ramps. Is this a serious comment? Jesus christ this sub is getting bad. 
to be fair, it only equals more off ramps if the exchange deals in fiat.  I haven't looked at any of the new exchanges popping up recently, but I'd have to imagine that the majority of them are crypto-only.
The size of the trades/monetary flow are not a good argument for or against a coin beeing a bellwether coin for the cryptomarket.
BTC is not trending down right now.
That's what I've been doing lately as well. Just setting stops to prevent any catastrophic outcomes.
> you should just make a decision at the current price then when the price changes the next morning 

and then u wake up to the one day btc decides to move 20% in a day :P
Or you can just count loses. I buy 1BTC here, but if it drops $150 I'm out no matter what. Of course it may be a fake out, but you won't lose more on that particular trade.
Then depending on the TV you might be able to do a PIP or overlay call. 
Yeah, I meant an indicator for Trading View. They have their own language I believe, that's why I thought might get a bit complicated to import it to a chart. But, if you are working on something where I can just look at the values over time, that's really all one needs.

People don't ask when the market is going up because they don't give a shit. When it's going down they want to understand why. 

It's pretty much that simple.. Potato king is a 19 y/o kid and is genuine- there's no reason  to assume he's trying to game this sub into becoming bearish. 

He was even bearish at $10k
No I’m legitimately asking. It doesn’t seem like crypto is very useful to the world, yet it has a valuation of billions of dollars. Why? Asking a question like this is not FUD. 
It's on-chain governance. Instead of governance by hard fork (what ETH and BTC have) the token holders can vote. This drives people crazy. 
That maybe true, but it is completely failing as a project and I'm very glad I'm not holding one of them bags now. 

And those that didn't think this type of governance model would fail were very daft. 

Ethereum and bitcoin are success stories, EOS is far from that category. Just because many noobs got tricked into investing in a crazy centralised project, doesn't make it a success.
proof dumb money still in crypto, here. 2k btc for sure.
Hahaha people here don't know dude don't worry. They all hated ethereum too when it happened. 
I remember reading here someone posting how they've been tracking open interest on bitmex, I think you brought it up as well. Do you still have that? If not I can go through this week's dailies and look for it.
Those longs w/ stops in that $5700 range will trigger a massive cascade...
Yep people are overly concerned with these round numbers. Expecting a massive and quick drop is just ignoring the trend in volatility over the last 6 months https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/volatility-index/

We may be going down, but volatility is going down too so don't expect it to be over in an instant.

> How much worse could it get.

sweetsummerchild.exe
i mean it could totally get worse. We're like 5% under our 6 months low any downwards movement since February hasn't exactly been catastrophic 

Not saying it will but...why not 
I have been reading this thread every day for the last 6 months, this is nothing lol. Just because some reddit users are crying on daily and other subs doesn't mean we are anywhere near the end of this bear. They were crying on 15k also, so not really relevant fact. 
During the big capitulations that I remember the sentiment here was  much worse than now and usually there was a large influx of FUDers of various types. China FUD last summer was crazy, then you had the bcash FUD, Tether FUD, the network was overloaded, and etc. This long grind down is different, it's just people slowly realizing that february was not the bottom and that the people that kept telling them to buy over the last few months have been wrong.
yep and longs made out like bandits for months up until the ATH

it works until it doesn't.
Real life yes, from TA perspective 4.5k is very logical number.
Amen. 
My name means I saw crashes before this one.
If 4.5k breaks then bitcoin is done. 
\>Most here are traders, not tech supporters, they only care how to suck some dollars off crypto.

Not really. BTC is a "store of value" right? Most of us here are for the "value" part duhh. We dont really care whether its dollars, yuan, gold bars as long as we gain more value get it? It is a store of value after all lol... what did you expect.

I mean Ethereum is being praised for its tech but lets be real, being judged on your tech is pretty hard and will lead to low valuations. Being a store of value on the other hand can make something valuable regardless of how shitty the tech is. Digital Gold is the killer app. Thats why i think Joseph Lubin will lose his bet that a killer app better than digital gold will come out of smart contracts in the future.

In fact its so hard to be against BTC but pro gold. Thats why Warren Buffet is being rational with his hate since he hates BOTH gold and BTC

but it was smart to buy at 5900 :)
DAMN STRAIGHT!
Because i’ve been here for a year and a half and saw btc go from 2k to 15k while many other alts remained stagnant in USD during that time
No I mean it’s last recent peak of ~45%. According to the chart on CMC BTC has never gone above its last significant peak
Nice
because so many people are losing money because they are margin traders instead of hodl. so the price falling temporarily causes them to get liquidated before it goes back up.

stop gambling idiots

just keep buying dips no margin and u cant lose 
Yeah i'm not talking about tiny model cars.
if BTC falls in USD value, you can watch your money burn twice. 
Not that terrible actually because the gradual devaluing of my fiat currency over time incentivizes spending, investing and economic activity which results in improved prosperity for all.

You'll notice on the chart you just posted that there is a brief period between 1929 and 1939 where a deflationary trend occurred, do you know what happened during that period? The Great Depression.

If you are curious to learn more about why we have free floating currencies in the modern era here is a good post from r/badeconomics which elaborates on the subject:

https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/8k65c0/gold_backed_currencies_are_more_stable/dz53s51/
Yep it’s getting toxic af in here, I’m out of here for now it’s gross. 
pretty sure bch lead this pump by a good 30 min
it was a fucking joke about how eth isn't leading btc guys
Typically I would agree about the 15m thing but when there's panic in the market they seem to play out
I should have added the amount when opening position but I didn't :(

Hopefully, this doesn't go below 5800 now
Hehe i just wanted to hear someone say something nice about crypto after all the crap I’ve been reading in the last days so i went to listen to the most retarded perma bull podcast I know lol
[removed]
But would you still sell if you held so far down?
This tether stuff is starting to go around quite a bit. I saw in *The Week* the tether manipulation NYTimes article...

*The Week* is where I get a lot of my news, it's really unbiased (basically aggregates all sorts of articles from left/right wing sources) and informative- I was surprised to see them stick in a blurb on btc being potentially manipulated by Tether
Seemed to have data backing up the claims 
your comment is much more low-effort
I expected some downvotes for that comment but I guess it was worth it! :D

I didn't know that was the reason. So considerate <3
Definitely.

I'm usually not one to really take pattern "targets" into account. Once one breaks one way I'll keep it in the back of my mind when framing my viewpoint (like "oh, that shit broke, that's super bearish") but I try not to keep hard numbers in mind. If we do get down to 1.3k or 3k I gotta think there'll be plenty other more timely bearish patterns/indicators that play out to draw from.
So greatest loss ever for BTC is this market? 
The divergence was making me nervous as well but am still undecided whether to close because the bounces have been bit paltry. Probably is more sensible to lock in profits though.
Where do you learn how to manage risk? Is this risk includes manipulated market (like you wrote about let market do what it does and watch closely)? Anyway great job man! Hope you can share more.
Why would they do that. Old was showed in portrait. 
haha will do but seriously what does it do? I see it light up so I press it but it doesn't seem to do anything. I am genuinely curious.
Thank you! I noticed the chart doing that when I was on mobile, but on my computer, clicking and dragging the chart wasn't doing anything so I was confused.
He posts a lot and I get a concern-troll vibe from him. Maybe he is not. I have him at around [+20] on RES fwiw.
Oh yes definitely, it's 100% happening. They're hardly even trying to hide it. I tried to test it in another 18 day old thread and got 5 upvotes immediately- I 'm assuming they have some sort of algorithm that attempts to cover their tracks if I post elsewhere?

my guess is Olesentv since he made that post about "fighting back against the bears" post a few weeks ago saying that bulls needed to squash bearish sentiment to help the price recover lol. he's also constantly doing that "translation: [some variation of: im trying to get you to sell]" thing too

Yeah he's definitely been hit with a downvote bot.  See here yesterday: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ug7w8/daily_discussion_thursday_june_28_2018/e1gyg38/?context=3

/u/SloppySynapses 
The problem isn't being below 50%, is that i've been here many times and the most i could get was 20% profit before starting to lose again and going back to 30% loss, 40% loss...

I just can't be consistent enough to make it to breakeven at least and then go safer not to lose a lot again.

Let's see if Chewy is right and a bounce (even tiny) is in the near future so i can close at least at BE.
Yeah, sure... I have lost 1.2 BTC (1.183 to be exact) since my max BTC net worth
you know as we go lower I'm remembering why we all didn't sell at $17k+. When it starts trending super hard it feels like it'll go that direction forever...I promised myself I wouldn't feel that way but now that we're going lower I'm questioning myself. It will be hard to stick to the plan

The assumption you're making is that my opinion is that of an emotional trader. Bearish momentum is increasing and will do so for a while. 
Might as well just flip a coin or do nothing instead of writing 5 paragraphs of mumbo jumbo. 
From his post history, I'd be surprised if he isn't already homeless. Looks like he got wrecked on some bad trades, and then decided the logical thing to do was to hate on the asset.

I think the big problem with Stamp and Coinbase is that they in fact DO have non turbo nerds with an eye for design. They are putting form over function in products that should be 99% function.  (inb4 someone says how in the ideal world REAL designers design products where form compliments and enhances function, but alas) 
A single buyer with that much money would do a better job of accumulating without raising the price hundreds of dollars in instant upper slippage. 

If you want to accumulate or distribute you do it sideways, if you want to move the price up or down you do a large market buy or sell. 
You are right, I should have chosen better terms. I was not using MM in such a way that it expressed my thoughts accurately. 

In any case, I think use of the term “unregulated market” was reasonable enough. 
Combine that with all those sweet wall street bonuses. Woah boy. 
Haha yeah, had to happen eventually. So happy I randomly checked the 12 hr chart, I usually only use 4 hr/daily. Managed to close a short in profit and open a long in a decent spot... Best call I've made so far, especially since I only recently started using leverage.

Tricky part is going to be closing since I can't watch the charts like a hawk this weekend, doesn't really seem like I'll need to worry about it at this point thankfully. Things can always change fast though.
Jokes on them, they just have to watch me jerk off 5 times a day in between staring at charts and picking my nose.
In reality, the market isn't out to get anyone. Professionals accumulate when the market gives them clues that supply is running low. The only people who lose are the ones that can't spot these accumulation areas, or don't know how to cut their losses immediately. I'll admit I missed it. I just put in 1/4 of my stack at 6.3k. But I also know where I'll exit. Whether we go up or down. 
Where'd you sell all your LTC at? Looks like you got out at a good point...shit's tanking 
I didn't say nobody is buying, try reading the whole sentence next time.
Well watch the link you post in your OP
I think it will be very interesting to see where we are come Monday.
I disagree. Chinese housing market is significantly overheated and the yuan is being devalued again. If the house prices fold in any significant way there will be a significant move away from property as a safe haven (which is it's primary function in China) and cash would not be a good option.

Same goes for the western world. If there is a property crash that coincides with a crash in bonds or equities crypto would be one of a very small number of choices available for where to park funds.

It'll suck when you get the "I told you so".  But remember, you're young and fortune favors the bold.  Don't beat yourself up for taking a shot.  It's better to have tried and failed than be the ones who subscribe to the daily monotonous grind, never taking a chance.  YOLO
Hopefully you can look back and laugh later in life. Remember there’s a lot of people that have lost a lot more. As for the fam, tell them when you’re ready. No rush. It’s your business, not theirs.

After the ATH?

I took one loss (not even comparable to yours, basically what I earned in a day during my temporary job) and decided to learn everything I could from the internet and using Tradingview. Going in without understanding what you're looking at is basically gambling. Don't do that with stocks, too.
You spelled dump wrong.
That sucks. I also lost a lot too. Good luck to you man. Hope it gets better.
That's not half of your money? $4k would be so. 

So you bought into bitcoin less than a year ago without a plan and a long term strategy? And you didn't expect any volatility in the opposite direction? 

Most people that have done very well making money in bitcoin have held for years and seen profits come and go many times. You have to detach yourself from the actual money and understand how this market works long term. When you got in last year you should at the very least said I'll either sell when the price gets to a certain level or at least until after the next halving in 2020. And if you don't understand what the halving is then you shouldn't have put any money in until you had read the whitepaper and understood bitcoin as well as you could. 

Once you set them targets you have to expect to see your money drop 50% or more a long the way, because in this crazy market it doesn't just go up, it has big swings both ways. Simply looking at past charts would have told you this. 

I'm sorry for your loss, but I fully believe in a couple of years you will regret selling now. 

Ultimately it seems you have invested more than you can afford to lose which is the number one rule. Please don't do that again.
Crypto is a zero sum game. So far, its utility to the economy has been marginal, at best. If you have made money out of these pumps, it means that money has come from somewhere. That somewhere is other people, 99% of whom are buying purely with the expectation to sell it to a greater fool. They are not interested in any underlying utility.

As such, had you made money, which you've admitted was your primary intention, that money would have come out of someone elses pocket, who would now be in your situation. In order for anyone to make money in this market, someone has to be in your situation. 
search on "spy" and look at the 5 year chart. same thing for "QQQ". they just keep going up over time and they are diversified indexes with low fees. better than any mutual fund or money manager for sure. that's all you need to know...
I think some people on this sub are in a bit of their own insulated BTC bubble and don't realize the true carnage out there.

Some very naive newbies came along in December and January and invested heavily in altcoins that may be down 90% or more right now. 

To make matters worse, some people bought BTC or ETH, made large gains, sold that for altcoins in December/January which created a large tax bill, and then saw those altcoins become largely worthless and may still/will have have a tax debt they are dealing with in addition to having worthless altcoins.

Some people have literally lost more than they invested which I have to imagine is depressing as hell. Needless to say, it's going to take these people a long time, if ever, to come back to the market.

Yeah, easy to get tilted when you lose. Did my share of gambling and now have to be more careful.
Isn't that what most TA is? 
i suppose? i mean it would be more bearish if we were in free fall i'd like to say we won't return to low 6ks but i won't yet.
You give Reddit too much credit :D
Only to those who paid $2500.
A bull market won’t start before -20k, we need to go back to the same ath levels 
Dude I gotta just say for the last 3 months I thought your name was "hotsoccermom" lmfao
I'm actually out of position at the moment.

I closed a short earlier today at $5,870, but I'm opting to attempt to re-short higher rather than opening a long position.

I think we're likely to see continued downward pressure over the next few weeks to months. 
Awesome, thanks!
Bloody awesome. No, I’ve been out of the loop for a few months, but yes I started the project. The magic of open source!
Told you about harry and sure enough there he goes again:)

He did this at 5700 too lol
Meh. We just broke through a crucial resistance point and made a higher low.

If you remember, the entire run up from 6.4-10k, we would push up then settle for some time then push up again.

It doesn’t need to go up indefinitely.
What would be examples of plausible bullish news that could significantly impact the market?

>Mike tends to do ~1% scalps on these pullbacks iirc.

Usually aim for 5%. When the market moves unexpectedly against me, I'm often happy to close at a 1% profit. 
No problem
/u/justanotherlogin can fix that. 
use long XBTUSD update 5880 5x
I mainly just don't like opening a long on Friday before the weekend. I think I'll just sit out of position for now. If we see a pump over 6000 without breaking 6200, I'll be re-shorting. 
Thx, I get the idea.
It’s taken us over four months to find a lower low after the crash to $6k on 6th February. In early May (3 months later), we were knocking on the door of $10k.

That’s not to say that we won’t be lower in 90 days, but to assume that we will and that pushing the price to a premium is madness, is not a fair assumption.
No?
Yep, good times. Unfortunately I don't/didn't actively trade ETH and was unable to capitalize on it (but on the flip side, wasn't rekt by it, either).
Haven't you heard? It's a bear market. No buying, only selling. Ask side only from here on out.
Same here. Weird, I was able to see it yesterday.
You’ll know when it’s here
[deleted]
Yeah, I agree.

I gave up when we broke 6800.

HODL mode for me now
Yes I agree, those with that experience will have cashed some if not all out at the end of last year, but even those that have been here for a long time cannot call the absolute top or bottom, so most likely they cashed out a large amount around that time, but maybe not all. And many are waiting to see how far this goes before that put some of that money back in. Those with big fiat bags are probably slowly buying around now and willing to buy more if it keeps dropping. Spreading your buys and sells usually works out well if you pick the correct range. 

Hodl is not terrible advice. But I didn't mention anything above about not taking profits when things are going up a lot. Just those that have experienced this before will not be panicking nearly as much.
> you know I'm waitin for that sweet dump to $4.5k.

thats not capitulation, thats just a good strategy! :) and I mean, in your case thats expected, but also as a general vibe, its more about "ahh cant wait for this drop to be over" than "ok, time to call it quits forever". even the guys who do call it quits every now and then seem to reappear a few days later :) so i'd say still far from capitulation.
Hmm that’s a good point. 

Makes sense to me. 

Definitely seems like there’s some trolls out in here though haha. 
Agreed. I'm trying to understand why it dropped in the first place from say 10k. 20k I understand, it was too juicy for intelligent investors to not profit take. But I'm trying to figure out why 10k to 5k and what would be the factors to take the price back up to that point. 
I can't imagine how bad one's sentiment must be to capitulate when the market's been dumping for 8 weeks straight...I feel pretty shitty myself though I'm still well within profit but I'm waiting it out for a relief rally (Which as you pointed out, is why we wont be heading into a "real" bull market anytime soon). I'm also generally pretty bull biased, I think the bottom will be around 4500-5200 so we don't have much more to drop from here.
It was a hit for me too, after we broke 6500 and 6000 I completely detached myself emotionally from this market. Which is sad because i fcking love the space, there isnt anything quite like crypto
Exactly. I dont get people. Makes no sense. Either ignorance or ppl are lying to themselves. Dont know which is worse.

Even a broken clock is accurate twice a day. If whales have been accumulating every time we dropped as per the belief of many in this subreddit, they may not be whales any more. 
Whales are busying finding something else.

https://www.ccn.com/coinbase-billionaire-peter-thiel-back-new-reserve-stablecoin/

They are probably getting each coin for a penny to be early investors.  Once this hits the market whether it works or not or becomes widespread it doesn't matter.  They have made 100X their investment.  
He's not saying this is the long term bottom, just that he's not expecting a capitulation wick at this point, but a short term reversal
$59 is just unrealistic, but $1300, the previous ATH, is possible.
that way $1 to $2 looks the same as $6000 to $12000 instead of $1 to $2 looking like nothing
I would say 1$ to 10$ looks like $1000 to $10000.

>Weekly RSI is at 40. The last time it was this low was in August 2015, when the price was only $250.

ELI5 bitmex futures: https://twitter.com/AureliusBTC/status/1011272037778776064
No, shorts and longs on bitmex are always 1:1 on swaps and futures. It just means that the spot price has been trading under mark price because people are bearish so shorts are willing to sell lower and longs are not willing to buy higher. 
Yeah its obviously very small but a rebate is a rebate amirite?
You should, except if you're trying to open into rapid market movements, you could have the book stack up in front of you and end up chasing your order entry point until you get it. If you give up $25 of entry chasing to try to get your market rebate, it would have been better to just market execute. 

Also, I would still recommend using limit with post-only unchecked rather than just using a market order in that situation. You still get to specify the price then and won't get wrecked on slippage/laggy interface. 
If the market moves quickly you won't get your order filled.
That’s a pretty damn big descending wedge.

Your edit is a spurious claim.

There's no evidence to support that ETH leads BTC. There's only a loose correlation that can be observed randomly.

Why? What's your reasoning? As if there had been no positive development for Cardano in the meantime.  (And I don't own any Cardano and do not plan to buy any).
What makes you so sure that the network effect of BTC is strong enough to protect it against competitors that have a much higher transaction capacity with the same fixed issuance schedule / supply and proof of work?
Thanks for the reply (sorry for late response).

I've only recently started using Steam, but will be sure to check out your posts :)
I mean there are just no mention of any bearish news, such as senate bill that aims to ban anonymous crypto, EOS governance issues, low volume etc.  
Your post makes it look like everything is bright and fluffy, because mentions only positive news.  

Yeah, an elite group of super smart traders all put in 1000 one btc market buys at the exact same moment! Uncanny, remarkable. /s Even if I get lucky and make money on a long like this morning I don’t have the illusion that it was anything but someone pulling strings I don’t have access to. 
Pull yourself together and get over it.

There will be other entries to take advantage of. You win some, you lose some. I lost 0.6 BTC after the BGD in April and I’m only just back to where I was at that point. I just took a break, reduced the size/risk of my trades and traded less frequently.
I've been involved 8 years and have seen this kind of post innumerable times. Usually close to local bottoms.
You must've not been around for 2014/2015. Almost 24 months of bearishness and doom and gloom. Bitcoin goes up a bunch and it comes down a bunch. Then it goes up a bunch again.
Seems like more places are offering cypto to buy now, as much as it might be a massive ponzi i think it will gain in popularity over the coming years. 
Despite the seemingly unending pain and sickness I can say this: A brighter time will inevitably emerge and when it does those who endured no matter what will be stronger, it's not just about money. Like lifting weights, no pain no gain.
Yep.  Until your weak hand is flushed out of the market.
It is being built on a house of cards with more and more trillions of $s of debt.
I agree, still doesn't mean I take pleasure in others misery.
Is that really true?

If Alice buys BTC in 2013 and sells it to Bob in 2017 at a profit, and Bob then goes on to sell it for x2 the price later in 2017.. who has lost here?
This is the time to DCA into a position. Nobody knows where the bottom is.

If you didn't start selling within the 20% of the top, then you have shit timing. Same thing here. We're within 20 - 40% of the bottom. It's time to start thinking about buying.
One shouldn't be in this space with money they need.
You stay away from Bertha you sick fuck.
I don't believe things like that are set in stone and don't think you should be taking them literally. Otherwise you end up with some unhealthy extremist thought system analogous to how, for example, ISIS is basing their ideology on what Muhammad really meant in the Koran. There are plenty more examples like that.

Ideas grow and expand over time and cannot be restricted to their origins. If people would argue that the internet was defined as a  system for e-mail transfers you would not have seen the vast innovation we have seen in this space over the last decade. 

It is simply limiting to think like that.
Aren't you thinking of bcash?
lol he even calls for $5k wtf
Focusing illusion - people weight whatever they're thinking about/current events much more heavily than bayesian updating predicts they should. 
I am not sure you can rely on history to repeat itself. As an example here is the stock price of Intel. https://imgur.com/a/vJWaXSS

As you can see, the price was rebounding just fine until the final bust, which, incidentally looks pretty similar to Bitcoin's.

People that bought 20 years ago are far from breakeven, not to mention if we add inflation into account.

Glad you replied. You helped prove my own point considering [you bought in between $10-20k](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8pgw6v/z/e0cjhtr)

You really dont have a choice to consider it wont go back up at levels like that. And given your username, you must be in pretty damn deep.
Your loss
He wrote a book on Ethereum.
But how can you argue that that makes sense...? Wouldn't you be getting downvoted if everyone disagreed with you? How can your sentiment be the unified sentiment when it literally says "everyone thinks it's going down"?

Clearly people don't think it's going down if they all agree with you. 

I'm not even euphoric...I'm stressed m8 this shit ain't easy on ya heart...
this meme has aged well :)
I’m basing it on the V shaped bottom at 3k in September where we pumped 1k in 1 hour
you realize how naive that sounds, right?
I prefer the daily chart, though the use of a linear scale is interesting. I'm not sure I trust the linear after we managed to drop 50&#37; from the top of your wedge, but I'll admit that it forms a nice-looking wedge.

In the interesting of proving my insanity, I just wanted to share the price levels I'm watching. The aforementioned wedge is in orange: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/osXDmW5u/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/osXDmW5u/)
The pattern I drew cuts wicks. It's there with or without them being cut.

I think we're waiting on confirmation that volume is picking up, still.
Are you convinced now?
How does volume fit? We'd have to see a significant expansion of volume. How is that going to happen right now?
Thanks!

I get pretty much all of my investment advice/explanations from a site called investopedia... do you prefer stockcharts.com?
Yeah I thought that was common understanding.

It's mentioned nowhere how they determined this number. I also couldn't find anything on the Chainalysis website. Did they just assume that if coins didn't move for xxx years the coins are lost? Because that's bullshit.
Child actor is the correct term.
I hope you shorted it from the top at the end of April. Whew.
Bitconnect had some killer marketing too.

Well shit if the brains at /r/CrytpoCurrency are on the EoS train then maybe i've got this thing all wrong. 
XMR yes, ZEC sucks with that insane inflation rate.
It's anecdotal nonsense imo
There's dozens of them!
of course, but from 2011 the probability is quite low to have a "channel with them" :D
Really? Why are there so many examples of it?
He’s from the future, the chart will be posted soon.
I mean, why wouldn't it? Is Bitcoin actually ded this time?
Sloppy. You must be a finance psychology or math major. Always logical. No /s
Agreed
Exactly. What chewy did? He basically sold and going to buy back at 7k or when he sees the reversal. That's the point. Have a plan for all of this or be miserable forever.
The prolonged depressed state is actually damaging for your brain. 

I'm not sure what long-term effect the euphoric bursts have... but I am going to say they don't make up for the damage from the stress
Or, nothing could happen and things carry on as they are.
[deleted]
\>Just the most likely scenario IMO

Not really, its more likely for traditional markets to head downhill further (see asian markets) and whales and big money in crypto going risk-off by going to fiat.

\>We need something to incite real panic if this isn't going to grind lower slowly over the next 9-12 months.

"Need" is a pretty strong word. Pretty sure the market doesnt need anything. Strong biases, and thats coming from someone who thinks we will head down further. I mean at this point just the price continuing the trend will incite panic.

Plus you're predicting a cataclysmic event will happen just because the market "needs" it lol.
I’ve got us at 71% down from ATH ;)
I agree
[deleted]
I bet we will. Maybe a little more, 18months.

This is Crypto after all
except the while be your own bank and stick it to the man piece, right?

Bitcoin is the only thing with literally 0 centralization.

Miners are centralized, but all they cna is double spend (and they dont)

Exchanges are centralized, who cares

There isnt one person on this planet that can control the future of Bitcoin
XMR is cool. I dont think blockchains should be anonymous by default, but I also think that Zecash is a bit of a scam, so XMR it is
ETH too?
xmr is also the ONLY coin worth anything ALSO!!1
Dog Walking ICO "CEO" detected. 
Well played, bogs
What? Why?  Eth is more likely to take 1st spot that die.
In more ways then one, just think of all crypto that raised ETH for their ICO that yet to be cashed out, nearly every ICO....“oh well, it was a great idea to tokenize a dental plan on the Blockchain, but it’s time to cash out”. I wouldn’t be surprised if their not cashing out their own supply of coin before they become worthless. BTC whales are the only ones who can save Cyrpto w/ a BGD! 
no idea mate, could be 2 months, could be 20, could be never. Looking at whats happening in the fiat landscape long run, I'll put the chips on Bitcoin. Fuck the banks and fuck fiat.
I didn't say it was fair or that you would win
Can't really argue with that, I generally don't take this market very seriously ever since the BGD in april. Ever since then I just think it's laughably ridiculous 
... He's saying they aren't. Bitcoin is a new asset class with low liquidity so whales buying/selling can at times move the market quite a bit in a short period, even if they aren't necessarily trying to manipulate it in a certain direction.
Low liquidity makes it easier for the whales to move the price.
If what I said is true (which I'm not saying it is, necessarily), it's because since the liquidity / market cap is low it doesn't take as much capital to push things around.
FOMO-driven market and assymetric nature of supply/demand could explain it.
Shorts increased by 700+600 BTC on these candles, longs by 150+250 BTC roughly. Subtract the longs from the shorts and the rest is exchange buys.

Edit: Explain where I'm wrong instead of downvoting?

No, I find it interesting that you decided to visit this sub for the first time to troll & spread unsourced FUD.
are you using bitfinex?
First I did not mean anything negative towards you, only the link.

The quote is basically saying that if you are not a good trader(what I imagine guys at Bloomberg) you stick to analysis of markets, since you there can create your own dreamed up version of reality that fits your narrative since being right is big importance to you
No worries!
I have been hearing about long squeeze since 8k
Yeah, I been involved with btc for a fair few years now and Im not fussed as to where the ever elusive bottom is. I might panic if we go sub 3k but I believe that with debit cards coming soon things will start flowing again...least to some extent. 
It's still down vs bitcoin by 4% over the last 7 days.
It did that pump in like 15 minutes.  I couldn’t figure out what was happening?  Bitcoin wasn’t moving.  Super strange.  Nobody has any idea of why?  No announcements or anything?  Is it Ver hocking it on TV right now somewhere?

A little hopium for everyone long... last run when we went up to 9900 it was bcash that started pumping first and hardest.  Maybe it fizzles out or maybe we get another little bounce.  Just something to think about
Yes, but unless you are completely anti-crypto (like some in this sub are, nothing wrong with that of course), you would be hard pressed to say that certain coins are not severely undervalued at this point (unless governments go for full crypto-bans that is).  (I do think that some projects may still be a little overvalued, but many are not if cryptocurrencies have a future).
BCH is catching up to moves BTC made over the last week. It's still down 4% compared to BTC over the last 7 days.

People like me dont really say anything and dont give any advice to other people but thanks for putting me into some category. 

> The true bottom is $0. It can go down to anywhere between here and there.

Yeah, no. The thing is that people simply dont know where it is going and telling someone to sell right now is just as stupid as telling people to buy right now. It can also go up in an instant. The longer we go down, the higher the probability we go back up again. If you think this is going to 0 you dont seem to follow whats happening around Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies lately. Exchanges popping up everywhere, usecases and actual use popping up everywhere, coinbaise getting ready for institutional investments, ETFs, ebay and Foxconn just joined the EEA and so forth. We are still just scratching the surface.  I mean TCP/IP v4 was established in the 70s and in 1982 it was installed as the standard network-protocol in the military. When did people really start using the Internet? 2000 or even later?

> There is only down in the short and medium term (3 to 5 years)

Yeah, no again. If history is any indication (and its the only indicator we have) the bearmarket wont last longer than 1-2 years and we are almost 40% into that timeline.
Tagged you as bitter.

Does not mean you are wrong.
Oh fuck off. I'm bearish too but only idiots think they know what the price is gonna be in 5 years.
It wasn’t the traders who brought us to $20k

It was sheep normies FOMOing and buying 
I feel like some of these are some dude that sold weed in highschool back in 2010 for BTC, then sold it at the top and every now and again he’s getting lit with his friends and he’s like “Yo, watch this”.
Profiteers poking the price in their favor isn't going to make the world forget about the first and most secure uncensorable crypto asset I wouldn't think.
Are you still generating profits though?  A lot of people have boring jobs, but boring jobs that pay $100K a year are not the worst things in the world to have.  But also retiring and not having to deal with boring market is even better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Yeah true, I was actually wondering if it would follow through or not too haha.

You wouldn't have time to do anything if it played out like that ETH event did.  It was only that low for a split second, so the only people who scored were the ones sitting on hail mary / joke book orders.
He asked about "true fomo".  He didn't ask when someone on the planet would feel that way.  That happens every hour of every day.
Thank you
Thank you. So the reverse will be BRD then? 
I still dont understand. I googled it and found no explanation. Can you explain it? Thank you. 
And liq fee is 15%.

If lev is lower than 1x you don't have liq price.

Those longs gonna pile up until they'll lose faith in local bottom or close on a bounce...
You see your pnl. You can add later on margin if you want. But if you don't want to go over 1x and swing trade then it's easy to track.

I used this a lot of times when I was trading there and didn't feel comfortable enough to go over 1x lev.
See I am not a bad trader so I BUY at the capitulation price.
> There are a lot of people with a lot of wealth entering the space even in a huge downturn. 

I mean, if this were true we wouldn't be going down nearly as fast...
Why not? I mean this is a non hostile way. I'd like to hear an explanation. I'd say those at very least suggest how much each money is being invested (or pulled out) into (/out of) each.
that seems like a pretty good argument...
Nor was ETHUSD? 18:00-20:00 UTC ETH gained 1% whereas XBTUSD gained .75%, and the reversal indicators on ETHUSD were far clearer than XBTUSD (or BTCUSD).

It's not a contest or a matter of pride. It's just information, something to profit by (if you choose).
wat
>and then u wake up to the one day btc decides to move 20% in a day :P

Then you evaluate your position which leads you to eventually decide to go join a gambling addiction support group haha
\>Or you can just count loses. I buy 1BTC here, but if it drops $150 I'm out no matter what

Isnt that a stop loss.... but with an additional promise that youll stop gambling lol
Maybe I am working on something ;) I don't want to shill or hype it yet. If it goes online, it will provide a column data in CSV and a small graph for it, like this one: https://c3js.org/samples/simple_xy_multiple.html
🙇 
Frak! 
That is logical but they seem to get the news first instead of copying from some other news websites
It's a bit more. I think the hardware itself is worth below $100, you need done marketing, software, etc... Fair price should be around let's say $300-$400 (put a lot of room here). So why additional $1000?

I have a phone that I paid like $250 for it, isn't worse, has better battery, u can throw it into a pool and nothing will happen with it. Why $1500?
I don't really know people that well on here, so I am pretty skeptical of most things I read.
For one thing, the market cap numbers aren't valuations, they are just the number of tokens times the price for the token today.  You can't really go trade all the EOS tokens in the world for 6.61 billion dollars.  That isn't how that works, even a small fraction of the tokens being sold would annihilate the price to zero.

A true valuation would be something like when a company is sold and a single entity pays all of that to own the company.  No one would pay 6.6 billion dollars for all the EOS tokens in a package deal, so the real valuation is much much less than that.  So people that get all up in arms over market cap numbers are kind of grasping at straws in my opinion.  The price for one token is what it is and if you can sell it to someone else, just like all prices have been since the dawn of time.  


Dollar is backed by nothing but a (non-existant) good will of FRS. Yet it has valuation in trillions of dollars. Why? A legitimate question, not a FUD...
Maybe if normal times it wouldn't be FUD, but it seems kinda weird we're getting these comments NOW that people are obviously upset and the market is deep in the red. Why didn't you post this question a few weeks ago or at 800 billion? Don't you think its convenient existential questions are coming out right now all over /r/cryptocurrency and /r/bitcoinmarkets? 

What is also really weird, is that there are certain people in this subreddit, I'm not going to give names, that post super bearish, fuddy, concern trolling, end of times posts and then they delete them a few minutes later.  

It's interesting to observe all this. That's all i'm saying. 
Oh.. What could go wrong

I feel like they made it for us simple Coinbase users, those of us who buy retail but wanted to dip our toes in the trading market. Most of you all here are knee deep in charts, Barts, and BGD’s. A TON of us have crypto interest but need a more simple/easy to see approach. That’s what gdax/Coinbase pro has done for us. Just wanted to give the other side of the token here. 
I am only comparing to daily threads from 2014. Been reading them a lot in the past few days. Sentiment is pretty bad right now even when compared to most of 2014. I am wondering if its because more regular people had easier access to the markets this time around? I wasn't around in 2014 so I would not know what's changed.
I mean, yes, for sure it can get worse but this is pretty bad...and its only a 5% drop from humping 6k for 6 months...It's kinda hard to believe sentiment changed this much. Will people be posting suicide letters at 4.5k?
I never implied we are near the end of this bear. But I think we're near the maximum bad sentiment. The two are not one and the same. Sentiment will improve as people capitulate on the way down.

I've been reading this thread for 6 months as well, and I think today's daily was the worst so far. It was pretty bad in April as well before the BGD but nothing like this. 
Yeah China FUD was particularly bad....I was holding WTC at the time too and coins were dropping like flies on a young Binance...
I guess bitcoin is done then. 
One of us. One of us.
Good on you, maf!
It wont go to those levels, highest this can go is 7.5k But i could be wrong. 
That is very possible.
Really. That doesn't seem so true. They came out of absolutly nowhere and dozens pumped to hundreds of millions of marcetcap. Don't you remember the ico prices or early mining stuff? 
[deleted]
Good one!
Sucks man, I didn't mind getting into it when we were a bit higher but I have 0 desire to "rub it in" for anyone right now
Your humor and logic has no power here. 
 Got to get that /S in. Some people believe this, and there's an invalid argument for it.
I mean you didn't put % or lev on add so your CA is screwed. Use update command on bot to set it manually.
Haha captain crypto will be up your alley if that’s what you are looking for.  I like bad crypto and coin mastery.  Those are the only two I usually listen to.  I’ve found myself going back to other types of podcasts since crypto has died way down for the time being.
And what about all the previous bear markets that rebounded to new ATHs? This is just how it works dude. It's fucking tough to deal with, I know, but this cycle seems to be no different than any others. I'd argue this doesn't seem nearly as dire as the last too.
I’m a trader, so it’s hard to say, considering I don’t see myself encountering this situation. However, a drop sub-$3k without a significant bounce would not only undo the FOMO rally, it would push us below the ascending long-term support line leading back to early 2015. I see this as incredibly bearish. The next level to test in my mind would be $1k, the former ATH resistance, which is another 67% decline from $3k and it would likely be a long slow grind down to that point. So yeah, I’d rather put my current profits in other pursuits until it seemed btc was showing signs of recovery if it dropped below 3k.
Its quite easy to Make a conclusion then find data to support it. That isn't science though.
I disagree
My opinion is that people expecting these sorts of lows are fundamentally bearish: they think Bitcoin is worthless. Ironically, this statement is often accompanied by a declaration of being "long-term bulls" and that Bitcoin simply needs to retrace to the depth of the abyss, as it has apparently always done (because my TA says so, yada yada), in past market cycles. And then the weak hands are shaken out and the next great bull run can begin.

Today, I don't think it's reasonable to expect an asset with this level of exposure to drop 95% and expect it to retain value or appreciate over the long term. And I don't mean exposure in terms of market cap, I mean public awareness of the asset, even if it's not fully grasped by most. Particularly so when it's main selling point to most has become a digital model of gold and a hedge against the rest of the market. I don't think this sentiment existed or was remotely as strong in the past.

There's no clear line in the sand of course, but I think if Bitcoin spends anything more than a fragment of time below or around the 2-3k level, the long-term bullish argument is nullified. Those who have always thought it's the biggest pump-and-dump in history, including the general public, will then commit irreversibly to that viewpoint. Then again, this might be defined as "capitulation" to the "long-term bulls". I see it as the death of the asset.
I haven't looked, just noticed there are ~5 examples of breaking new highs, then falling to previous high, rinse / repeat.
concern troll? how??

And why would you have +20 on me then :P
I truly wouldn’t doubt it. You’re one of the few usernames I recognize around here, so I could imagine an upset basement dweller might find this to be a fun way to fuck around. 

Your comment here was downvoted before the 30 seconds it took me to get here. I know it’s possible for Redditors to friend each other or something like that, but it wouldn’t really explain the almost immediate upvote/downvote action. 

I’m almost wondering if Reddit admins could look into things like this if it involves a user getting targeted. In the grand scheme it’s not a huge issue though, seems like us regular users end up voting accordingly.
Trade with smaller amounts, don't make so many trades.

I've been through all of this. I had 3 months of losing streak.
I dunno. I dont see why it keeps going lower, only that it does. But then again, I never saw why it kept going higher either, only that it did.

The pst 2 years have been a bit heavy...
Because you don't have the whole plan. You know where you close on the way down, do you know where you'll close if this recovers here?
he's lying it's Dog.
Dude you need to get out of the basement, real life doing and making stuff isn't as fast and instantly gratifying as your video game.

Excatly while the rest of us get down voted for speaking the truth. Well said "mumbo jumbo" is all he wrote. 
Who's to say they didn't already accumulate, then make a big market buy to incite FOMO and drive the price up where they start unloading for profit. (and then make a big market sell to incite panic selling so they can do it all over again)

Yeah same here, I actually was hesitant about opening the short and I got the notification that you opened and I said fuck it. Call it confirmation bias but it worked. And same this morning opening the long, you do your own book but always helps to see your not alone in your analysis. 
You're right. The market itself isn't an entity with malicious intent. Market makers are a part of it, but retail traders and indicators like RSI are also a huge part of it. The daily bull divs were obvious to everyone but many people decided to ignore them as unconfirmed or unimportant. I'm not gonna claim to be a perfect trader who knows when to go all in on a bull div---I took a gamble just like any other trader. I just chose to make a gamble where I had solid indicators to back up my decision. Man, I sound like a dick right now. I really shouldn't comment while drunk.
Oh don't be a twat now, dawg. Own the nonsense you type with pride. We all do. And think next time. Clearly these are not "degenerate traders" only buying. Look at the "bubbles" representing "heat" (scale 1.0, transactions x>5). Whole 12+6h since 6am (utc+2): https://i.imgur.com/3RxOozh.png
I added a short at $5889 prior to posting that. And was considering closing them all ( Which I did ). 

I dont see the issue here 
Let's play your assumption out. Do you think someone would liquidate their investments because of a very low (compared to crypto markets) decline in the stock market and move it to bitcoin? Far more likely they'd just park it in cash or short term bonds and wait it out a year or two.


I said without the shadows, just check out the lengh on log scale. 
It's the volatility I think.. There was a person in r/ethtrader doing really heavy shit like this, very high duty memes. With the current market it's all beartrolls.. 
Yeah you’re correct. I still have half the money I came in with I didn’t lose it all. But I should’ve stopped when I was ahead. But yeah you’re right. I probably won’t tell them. I honestly just know I’m gonna be hella depressed. And the people who lost money I feel like they had only lost what they earned except for the people working minimum wage jobs who don’t have much to come in with 
Are you actually down overall? I keep seeing people say they lost x amount but in reality they haven't 'lost' anything. Oh well, I'm down £30k and my mental health is not at a good place  
You sound mentally ill, not meant as an insult
He was talking about the pump from 5780 to 5975 right now. He must have been short.
Thanks, good luck on you getting your money back 
I did join this marker with one outlook tbh. Up. It was my mistake I didn’t know what I was doing with way too much money. I mean I just got happy bc I made 8k in one week. And I was happy then bam it just shot down lol. I still have a lot to learn. But I’ve learned a lot as well. So it can be a lesson to me. I mean I can eat this loss I’ll be fine. But it jusr sucks bc it is a good amount of money 
>search on "spy" and look at the 5 year chart. same thing for "QQQ". they just keep going up over time and they are diversified indexes with low fees. better than any mutual fund or money manager for sure. that's all you need to know...

Should know more. While I agree with the advice for most to park retirement funds into low cost indexes, your statement is very wrong. 

There are mutual funds for both SPY and QQQ, some with even lower fees. SPY is more for trading due to extremely high liquidity and tight spreads. For a long term investment, you're better off with VOO (ETF) or VFIAX (mutual fund) which boast less than half of the expense ratio of SPY. 

Also, there are many mutual funds which have consistently beaten both the S&p500 and Nasdaq 100. 
i don't mean reddit in general, just it's a window into what people think
we see what we *want* to see ;)
You got a very good instinct somehow. Congrats closing before the pump. 
I honestly don't understand what you are trying to say. Someone faked the circumstances under which a short squeeze looks likely and then, instead of dumping, actually squeezes the shorts? Why? And who is this Harry character?
Well i posted above, get about 6.4 to break the bollinger MA and I'd start getting happy
Hey Mike, how you feeling about this short (if you’re still in it)? I didn’t expect the market to hold flat for this long.
Thanks for the shout.
For some reason I thought you already started your DCA long like last time.
I’m not saying you’re wrong. It’s just surprising that people trading futures are so much more bullish here than we were on the past two trips to $6k. I understand there was panic on the first dump, but I feel people were much more bullish on the last trip, predicting a re-test of $6k followed by a recovery. Conversely, I’m seeing predictions of a $5k, $4k, $3k, $2k, or even $1k bottom now, which would have likely been resoundingly down-voted until recently.
I’ll post it as a top level comment 
lol, wait where did you buy? It depends *which $6k* you bought at
Yup. Honestly this no fucks given race to the bottom is waaaay less painful imo.
Yup, it's slowly gotten worse but in general the vibe is still hopeful. I think after bleeding for a bit we will get yet another injection of some hope and happiness as soon as we bounce/stop dropping for a bit. 
Yea, personally have no idea how others can come in right now and rub it in, just seems super fucked up to me. real people losing real money on this shid, it's not funny to me :(
we did $5.5k to $20k in about 40 days, when you realize how insane those gains are it's really not very surprising we are retracing all of it. 

I saw a quote saying once that a bubble doesn't pop when people start selling, it pops when people stop buying. basically the hype just isn't there and we required a *lot* of hype to get to these prices.

no hype = no buyers = price naturally sags. 
I guess most people just really did not expect sub $6k. Like you expect $4.5k so I imagine a drop to $3k would be devastating to you - although obviously I highly, highly doubt we will get to $3k without a correction of at least 20-30% upwards



...were they not? There was like 15 comments about their losses.

Your translation shit is getting tiresome man its not creative or insightful. Can you post something useful? 
At this point I can't tell if I'm serious either. Lol

You're certainly not alone. The couple hundred people you see posting about their successful shorts are a small minority. A very large majority of people is at a loss in these markets.
Seeing these comments just confirms my bias, god damn it :(
What does naked shorting mean?
Oh! I get it now. Thanks :) 
Well, it's not a small rebate when you figure the alternative is a loss of money, right?
Gotcha man. I just changed all my orders to post-only. My performance with market orders are always the worst. It's very rare that a market order is the right way to go.
Meanwhile shorting the breakdown (not on ratio) would be tasty. 
JFC man you should mark that NSFW! 😂
I posted distinct evidence during one of our spring dumps where eth independently was selling off 15 min before BTC fell off a cliff. Don't have sloppys memory and can't look up. I'm not saying eth is necessarily moving BTC, but there is at least some correlation I've observed. It can at least dump hard enough for ratio bots to pull BTC down when it's precipitous.

Bro I know you hate alts and eth but this is an interdependent environment and eth is like an alt index fund. It has enough market cap to matter
Sorry I'm basing this based on limited chart viewing. Just saw eth go 1% from 406 to 410 while BTC was stagnant before they both moved an additional ~1%
Has there been enough development for it to be 10x the price it was in November (it's currently 10x)? Have there been any developments?
Nothing has the same proof of work as bitcoin. Orders of magnitude more work goes into the bitcoin blockchain than any other.

Something could dethrone bitcoin, but we'd see it coming years away in the hash charts.
np, and thanks!
Definitely appreciate the feedback, if you get a chance try to read and comment on future issues as I'll be sure to make a note about this and be more active in watching for it.  

Thanks again for commenting and taking a minute to read it.
stop loss buys can make it seem this way. Look at the 1 minute candles leading up to the BGD. It was starting to gain traction.
[deleted]
But people have been saying this for 3 months now. And the trends say that we aren't anywhere near a reversal.

So it might actually mean that the game is over.
Yes but that was after Mt Gox. That was a major hack.

I'm seeing good news this year and it's doing just as bad as after a major hack when BTC wasn't even that known? 

Nah man. Red flags everywhere. I always try to look at the bright side, but something is 100% wrong here.
What if the popularity came and went in December?
Maybe. But what evidence do we have from previous patterns that backs up this theory? Is it all hope and no substance?

Did anyone see the explosion that happened back in December coming before it happened?

Do these things just happen out of the blue?

I mean, the trend is clear. We'd be lucky to see 10K before 2020.
My hands aren't weak. You need to get your head out of your ass and stop thinking like this.
Then donate your BTC to charity and never come back.

You take pleasure in your gains right? Your gains are other people losses. If /u/diydude sells with a loss then indirectly he pays you if you sold at a profit.
That sounds like a pyramid scheme
The guy who bought from Bob and hodled 2018
The one who bought at 20k and sold at 6k... He paid for alice and bob gains.
everyone wins as long as new money keeps entering. new money will not enter forever- early adopters gain the most from a neverending bull run.
Fair enough opinion.  I will start nibbling at 3k 33% position, 2k 66% position and 1k max position (10% of net worth).  I'm perfectly fine if it never reaches any of these prices though or if only 3k is hit.  I've been all out since 17.3k.  Sold slightly early, but knew that December pump was insanely unsustainable
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, a payment system by nature. You can build awesome things on top of it, like http://memo.cash or http://blockpress.com. But it's a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. A chain of digital signatures, a distributed ledger of cryptographical tokens
what the fuck?

LOL!  


I didn't even notice that. Great call on his part :P
Shares of Intel stock are an *entirely* different asset class. 
this is depressing
How many bubble cycles did Intel have prior to that one? 

And even so, who cares? Didn’t you read my comment: price has gone down significantly and I was still more profitable than the stock market or any savings account. I just had to manage it myself. 
https://i.imgur.com/yvu5kDf.png

and what about you? o_O


You know nothing about me. I’m 100% in cash sitting pretty waiting for this fucker to drop. 

Yes I bought in then but I’m up $-wise from trading and tripled my stack. No despair here I’m banking more in this bear market than I did in the short tail end of the bull run I rode. 

This industry is just getting started. It’ll bounce back fine barring any catastrophic event. 
Funny how you attack his investments instead of giving an actual argument  on why it won't go back up again.

It reinforces that you are pulling statements out of your ass.
Touché, now I’m stuck in a paradoxical loop 
It was channel support then. This channel is no longer valid.

Old ATH at 5k, if we breach it then there's just nothing that can tell where is the bottom.
And even if we do bottom out, it doesn’t mean we will shoot back up to new highs. It most likey will just hover around a certain area for years just like wvery other asset in history has done after going through a bubble.

Nice. I like the black wedge as a fractal.
Sure, but with wicks it looks a *liiiiitle* too much like a descending triangle doesn't it?
No? We're still fairly sat within either a descending triangle or falling wedge.

To draw a wedge you need to cut wicks. To confirm a wedge you need breakout (last pump was nothing special).

To draw a descending triangle you don't need to cut wicks. And we're near the bottom of that triangle. And you don't need volume to confirm that.

It'd be a very optimistic stance to take, to think that it'll break up from here. People are welcome to believe what they like, I'll wait for some more solid formations frankly.
I think we're still waiting on volume to show it is up substantially.

Volume is up over the last 4 periods, but I wouldn't categorize it as substantial, yet. It the pattern is going to confirm it will probably happen in the next week or two.
I don't have a preference.
It \*is\* a reflection of money \*held\* in the space, which is an interesting and productive way to think about people and their bitcoin holdings.
I started buying on March, then got a bit too greedy and bought more At 19 but I am up quite a lot shorting all the pairs in bfx and bitmex. At 4 it's time to buy again after Binance opened deposits 
They are shitting on it just as hard as this sub, possibly harder.
Agreed, but I see ZEC as a "regulation compliant" XMR. 
I don't get why people believe it. No one would believe someone if they said something bearish anecdotally but this stuff gets eaten up so fast 
cause we're virgin neckbeards that idolize logic and fallacies 
MSFT took 20 years to recover from its bubble. Silver is still around 15 bucks from an ath of over 50. Bitcoin doesn't have to die, it could languish for decades under 5k.

Not saying that this is its future... it's a possibility. 
Hah, thanks mate, but if you saw me even just a few months ago (and still frequently) I can get incredibly emotional. I've just learned that being emotional is the best way to lose money, so I was like, "alright time to stop that"

Don't know if you ever read chewy's comment, but it's largely what inspired me to stop being so emotional:

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/80t3g1/daily_discussion_wednesday_february_28_2018/duz2v03/

His situation has now mirrored mine very well. I took a massive, massive loss, cried a few times, then sucked it up and realized the only way I was going to ever beat this thangy is if I stopped being emotional and started doing everything with a plan

Kinda sucks he's absent lately- I think his presence calms a lot of people here :( a big long write up about how shitty this all feels and stuff would be nice for a lot of people I'm sure


Yea, people are kinda missing the point. Oh well. That's what you get for trying to be objective lol

That's the slow grind down for 12-24 months
True - but eventually it needs to all flow back to BFX as they would be doing the redeeming. And I believe, but do not know, that the only people who can redeem USD for USDT are the original depositors, since they have the KYC info on them. But that's just speculation on my part, I don't actually know.
Oh... Right... So they shouldn't be realizing that yet...
We are speeding up, not slowing down as far as I can tell, we're seeing this space being legitimized (including at governmental level) at a rapid pace and we have hundreds of thousands developers working in this ecosystem. 

Considering the wipeout: the 3 bln on the sidelines in tether is still there waiting, I'd take the x15-20 multiplier of that into account. Including another multiplier for what went into icos. 
[deleted]
At this point it's laughable to call bitcoin decentralized.  There's 12 central banks, by your logic USD is decentralized.  6 mining pools control 80% of bitcoin hash rate.  That's why I hold decentralized currencies like USD instead of centralized shitcoins like bitcoin.
DASH is also anonymous and has been around a while. Cool concept with masternodes having to hold a certain amount. It has a future.
yeah but not as a currency, only as a solving halting problem with fee stuff
75% of all Cryptos that have “Tokens” listed on the CMC top 100+ are built on top of the Ethereum Blockchain platform and use it’s network.
Although I'd somewhat agree, it would ultimately drag btc down as well considering these people will want to trade into a more liquid asset.

So it wouldn't be good for anyone 
Look, I am here too, but this is what gamblers tell themselves. This sort of fish in a barrel poaching is brutal. And I made money from this, but I cannot help but declare it absolutely stupid. 
Well, that about sums it up. With you on that one
Call me naive but I just don’t buy manipulation is as prevalent as this bunch would have you believe

Edit: not that you’re implying this, just felt the need to voice it 
>assymetric nature of supply/demand

would that not mean we should be going up? lol

also "assymetric" lmao
Thanks. Downvotes weren't me. How many downvotes did u get at peak downvote?
Future market worked awesome. We would have Never ever reached 20k last Year without the market Getting bonkers because of Futures. this will be the same with etf, when they are real.

I decided to roll the dice. 15m chart so....yeah: https://www.tradingview.com/x/Y4Y2dvre/

!short xbtusd 5880 add 80%

Was gonna close at break even, so I figured I'd take a small risk. Market stops pretty close. 
Visiting the sub for the first time...?
With a single tap and a quick scroll down, you can see he's been here for quite some time. 
And then you share it with the world to confirm your bias.
I know. Anyway personally I could not care less about 'manipulation'. For me anything you can do with your money on the exchange is fair game. The only gray area is wash trading, but to my trading style it's irrelevant.
And since then we had at least 3 long squeezes. I am just saying that I would not go long with the current price being so close to a stop loss that will trigger a massive sell off.
[deleted]
Ya just saying it's doing its own thing 
Lack of liquidity. Just like no-name shitcoins.
I am pro-crypto and would say not certain coins are not necessarily undervalued at this point.  What are you basing your fundamental valuation on?  The fact that the price was pumped to $20K for BTC?

Look at 2 year returns for most all of these coins and they look extremely overvalued at current prices.
The crypto scene, as a whole, has a *ton* of dead weight to kill off before we enter the next period.  Very few alts provide any value whatsoever.
[deleted]
Probably Pewdiepie
Some of them are.
Do you really think good traders who hold no strong biases one way or the other actually care about the ideological narrative surrounding Bitcoin as an asset class?

A good trader only looks at the charts, what do you see when you look now? Suspicious price action which as a trader I don't wanna be a part of.

I know yourself as a long term holder probably doesn't care about the traders but I feel as though them leaving is very important for Bitcoin long term. Because at the end of the day it is those people along with the noobs who fomo which provide the momentum to drive Bitcoin to highs it has reached, if you discourage those groups you may never get the next big upward swing which you desire.
Hah, yea you're right. I'm tilted because I just want this thing to dump so we can see if it recovers or continues to bleed out

In terms of %s it's really not moving that slow, I just am getting that "ugh, guess it's delayed again" feeling. 

I really should've closed this morning- dush and I debated it over discord but I decided to sleep instead. When will I ever learn!

Me and sloppy were taking about putting some insane low buy orders in across alts in hopes people flash crash.

Precisely 
Big green dildo, it’s a large green candle.
It is true.  It doesn't mean bitcoin is going to succeed or go up, but it's a fact. Interpreting exactly what's going on is up to you 
lol, look at the chart.
I think we're playing the 'pick a time frame to justify your argument' game. 
lol.

honestly though in this market environment if you avoid getting stopped out 10 times at a 1% loss, it makes up for the 1 time you should've set a stop and lost 10% :P
Yes, it's a stop loss actually. But instead of thinking where is the point when fake out end and real drop starts you may just go with 'I can gamble with $150' and set the stops accordingly. Maybe you'll get lucky.

That's cool man, keep me posted.
Old, but I think still relevant comparatively. Saz ~200: http://fortune.com/2016/09/20/iphone-7-cost/
It's just a natural consequence of the market continually bleeding. 

The most used word in 2014 was "fundamentals" apparently. 
I'm not sure how he calculated that the market is overvalued right now. How does he know that? What is the real value then according to his calculations...150b? 80b? 20b? 500m?

Sure there are a certain players like EOS, ADA and a few others that are overvalued **RELATIVE** to other projects in this space, and there are others that are VASTLY undervalued relatively speaking...but how do you give a value to a market of a entirely new asset class as a whole? 
When the markets are going up, you are counting on the greater fool to allow you to make a profit. Or at least the lessor fool who catches the falling knife and let you get out with most of your money. The answer for "is there anything value behind this" is "don't know, don't care". When it is falling, the "fundamentals" become really important, because you can't just count on other people falling for FOMO.

Sidenote: From reading about beanie babies, it is amazing how slowly the bubble deflated because so many people were "value investors" who brought the beanie babies on the way down. It is what makes the entire bubble thing safe on the upswing. 
You're using the wrong yardstick for success then, even for a trading sub.  Under that definition bitconnect was a huge success.
Thanks
He's guessing 
Notice the prefix before the coinbase in the web address. "PRO"
Imagine sentiment if we broke through $5k. And $4k. And $3k. The pain you're seeing will only multiply as it includes larger and larger amounts of hodlers who bought >$3k and watched their monster returns go to nothing. I'm not saying it will happen like this or at all, but it could, and if so we will see much more pain in these threads.

And yes the market has many more participants than in 2014.
I think the price compared to 2014 has a significant psychological affect, even though BTC is divisible. Plus the mainstream media hype brought in normies who could  never imagine an asset they purchased simply losing 75% of it’s value in the span of six months (even some good Alts 90%). Afterall, CNBC was promoting LTC, ETH, BTC as being just a click away on the Coinbase, using all the memes like Hodl. Plus all the organized coin shilling so they could dump bags on their heads. The Dot Com bubble took 4 Year’s to pop but that was in the late 90’s, a distant memory w/ a multi-trillion Market Cap. This thing hit 800 Billion and the money vanished Lickety split before anyone realized what hit them. Not to mention all the bounces making the unaware thinking it’s just a normal correction and that it was coming back, or maybe they could somehow trade their way out of it which made it worse. So folks got burned bad and they’re angry, upset and feel mislead & foolish....which is no bueno for the crypto-sphere
A lot of people bought near the ATH thinking BTC was on its way to 100k
>I mean, yes, for sure it can get worse but this is pretty bad...and its only a 5% drop from humping 6k for 6 months

Pretty sure we spent most of the last six months bouncing between 8-10k. Haven't spent much time below 7k at all this year. We have dropped nearly 20% this week, 35% during the month, 70% this year. People aren't panicking about this latest drop alone, more the accumulation of drops during this never ending bear trend. We haven't seen prices this low since around November. 
Yeah, probably. The lower we gothe more paper profits people will have lost. 

But I do agree sentiment is kinda wild...I guess really these people never ever expected to go under $6k or something? we're barely under it...
It is true. Check the charts. After the may 2017 bubble, alts were mostly quiet without a real overall pump until December of 2017/January 2018. Between the May 2017 Bubble and December 2017 bubble bitcoin rose significantly in price. 

Some examples: Ripple, SiaCoin, Stratis
Filtering out the tokens seems like cheating.  There is real money invested in them just like mineable coins.
Oh the “I told you sos” are fine they roll right off my back, it’s the fear-mongering and attempts to manipulate people at a very vulnerable point which is just lowest of the low. If/when we pop back up I’ll be back to share the best “we’re going to zero”  type quotes I’ve *accumulated* over last couple of days. 🤫
I don't know how to use the update command

~~The CA is accurate to within a dollar, so I will just leave it as is~~
That seems sort of like wishful thinking, but OK. This is demonstrably and empirically worse then other bear markets
and why should anyone care if you disagree or agree?
I agree. If BTC loses 95% of its value (for anything more than a wick down) it's no better than the country's who devalue their currency to nothingness. The bull case would be fundamentally suspect (although too late for us to do much about it). 
You are commenting out of "feeling" and not out of facts/math.  We can absolutely fall 95% and still bounce back to new highs.  It's not a matter of sentiment, it's a matter of market cycles and momentum.  

Here's my long term view: 
 https://www.tradingview.com/x/tMRlLawV/

I expect to find substantial support around $2,500, but if you look historically, we HAVE broken that ascending support line before.  A clear break/selloff could easily wick the $1,300 range and bounce back.  I'm not saying it will stay there, I'm saying it would be fitting to see a "touch", if even for 5 seconds, of the previous ATH.  A nice pattern would then be to see the next cycle take us to $100k+, and then a bear market that would bring it back to ~$20k before moving on again.

Edit to clearly say - I have more invested in bags than most anyone I know in my personal life & I don't margin short btc (only sell for usd at most).  So I am absolutely not some long term bear, just trying to be realistic.

> I think if Bitcoin spends anything more than a fragment of time below or around the 2-3k level, the long-term bullish argument is nullified. Those who have always thought it's the biggest pump-and-dump in history, including the general public, will then commit irreversibly to that viewpoint.

I'm upvoting you because you're well spoken and the point is worth discussing but on the other hand isn't this just an erudite version of the "death of Bitcoin" trope that's been repeated innumerable times... and has always been proven wrong?
There are many previous highs before that
Lots of upvoting during forkwars lol. Then a bit of downvoting for getting sick of seeing your name.
yea I'm more amused by it than anything lol, I reported it to the admins but we'll see. I really do feel a bit bad for anyone sick of seeing my name - I hope people just block me. I know I comment *wayyy* too much
I was trying to reach BE to stop using leverage or limit using it just in cases that justify it. I reached like 90% before falling to 50% with 1 bad trade and 1 mistake. Seems every time i set a goal, i crash before reaching it...
actually it's the opposite lol 
[deleted]
I'd like to say regardless of 'mumbo jumbo' thank you autemox for taking the time to share some ideas and lay them out for all of us to enjoy
Well if he makes predictions BACKED UP BY DATA then he must be right!

What's hilarious is how you how have people like 'chewy' and the referenced poster treated like deities here, yet when you look at the accuracy of their predictions, they are usually wildly incorrect! Ie use random chance for comparable results. 
That seems as reasonable an explanation as any other actually.
I would actually be very interested to see this. How do you think 4h charts compare to the shorter time frames we are seeing here, comparative liquidity, and other general market comparisons? Could you share a link?
The effect can be explained by these, right?

 (1) thin order books

 (2) unusually high volume

 (3) leveraged trades being forced to liquidate at a certain price point

 (4) someone having a stop market buy/sell order at a certain price point

 (5) a sort of "chain reaction" due to some deathly combination of these, like that one time when ETH dropped to $0.12 a year ago
that guy accused me of shilling the other day.. don't recognize his name and he's a bullish noob.. Would ignore him, probably from /r/bitcoin or /r/litecoinmarkets or /r/ethtrader

Like who does he think he is coming to this sub randomly and accusing everyone of shilling lmfao fuck off 
There is no issue. You do you.

I just find the timing funny. 
I *did*. You're wrong.

It's only money. It hurts.

If $200 pump from complete bottom gets you liquidated then you're doing it wrong and moving to stocks will only postpone the inevitable.
Lol pump. You're funny.
Unlucky for getting giddy mate. I'm sure it isn't a rare tale. Just a shame you put so much in. If you are sweating now then maybe it is best to cash out and look at putting a small amount in when it looks like the bottom. My guess would be around $4k, but who knows in this crazy world.
yeh
And thanks for the bot and your work!
I did, but I closed it yesterday over 6100. I was going to put new entries in this morning, but December wasn't open yet haha
That’s the shifting of the sands of time :-)

Personally don’t think we’ll go below $3k because the growth over 2017 to that point did not feel parabolic, and was likely investors DCA’ing in. The madness started when Segwit 2x was resolved, and the mainstream media/BBT episode exposure.

I’m trading with 1 BTC right now, but also watching closely to try and get a feel for an approximate bottom so that I can buy back in with my money on the sidelines. Waiting for several months of low volatility in a several hundred dollar range. That will feel a comfortable place to start buying back in for me.
Most definitely man. It shouldn’t be funny to anyone. 

It sucks reading about people losing their life savings on this thing :/

Almost makes you feel kinda guilty if you’re in profit. 

Well, 5.5 ain't far now 😊
I would be in profit even if bitcoin dips to 1k but 3k is devastating to me. Which is partially why I want to secure a bit of my profits on the next relief rally if it comes. Just in case. I think 4.5-5k is a very healthy level for a market bottom and that's my bullish scenario. 3k Is a disaster, fundamentally for the market at large. 
Yeah I don't think it's gonna play out like that but I can understand your case and you have evidence for it
you actually make money off of price going down- not just more bitcoin.

if you short 1x you're shorting btc you already had- essentially just selling. if you short more than 1x then you're "borrowing" bitcoin you don't have to short it harder, meaning you actually make money off of it going down. 

/u/l14dy is this right or no? I think it might be wrong
True. Where are you seeing -0.0075% though? I'm looking at it now it says -0.025% and taker fee is 0.075%
I was considering doing that actually. Target would be around $360 and after that $275 ish. 

If you did that yesterday you would be underwater, giant fakeout

> Don't have sloppys memory

lol i'm laughing, i'm flattered.
I'm sure there's correlation, but I don't think you can say that the last 30 days of data have a strong correlation. You certainly can't show causation.

The whole market has been going down and Eth has been dropping substantially faster than Bitcoin. So, in that sense, yes, Eth leads the market. As far as signaling reversals? I don't think you can show that on the 1 minute chart of the 1 hour chart.

I don't hate alts or Eth. I'm pointing out spurious claims.
BTC has moved decidedly above its low. Eth is still hovering above a critical level.
I was watching both live simultaneously on 3 exchanges, I saw the whole thing. Frankly, I don’t see how any reasonable person could surmise manipulation isn’t a big piece of the unregulated market pie. Seems naive.
Some suggestions:

1. Don’t go long immediately after a pump. Don’t go short immediately after a dump. Wait to see how aggressive the pullback and if it makes a higher low/lower high. Then take your position.

2. If there’s been a big, continuous movement in one direction over a matter of days, or even a week, and we’ve touched a support resistance point several times, open a position in the opposite direction. E.g. I longed at 5880 yesterday because we’d touched 5700-5800 several times over the past week and hadn’t pushed convincingly below it. Likewise shorting 8600 on the way down this time was obvious because we were rejected several times.

3. Put tight stop losses in place to minimise losses. When you’re right, you’ll make back any small losses and more.

4. Trade with lower leverage and lower stakes until you build your confidence back up.

5. Do not revenge trade or overtrade. I just spent the past two weeks out of position and just watching the price movements. I re-entered when I felt comfortable to do so.

6. Trade generally with the macro trend. So primarily short a bear market and long a bull market. Trading against the market consistently will wreck you unless you know what you are doing.

7. Don’t get married to a position. Cut your losses when the trend against you is clear. I lost over half a Bitcoin in the run up after the BGD because I was in denial and contiued to add to a losing position.
Unfortunately, that's part of learning how to trade.  You need to read the market in both directions, constantly going long in a bear market is asking for trouble. Especially if when you decide to short price is at a low
Bottom doesn't mean reversal 
This is a very good point that I haven't considered. Fundamentally, things have seemingly only improved for crypto since December. Why is it that we are still going down? I hope this is just natural market cycles but I'm starting to think maybe it isn't. Maybe there is an actual underlying problem with this asset and it just wasn't meant to ever catch on. 


Whatever, I'm gonna go to sleep and think about it more tomorrow. 
What are you talking about? It's not anywhere as bad as after gox yet. 
> Yes but that was after Mt Gox. That was a major hack.

The same thing is happening this time because the same thing happened during mtgox!

tether is the willybot of 2017
The popularity of crypto seems to come in waves, the price rising seems to be the cause of the popularity. Maybe its all down hill from here but the fact that its going to become more easily available to purchase tells me we haven't seen the end. 
It's a momentum market, the emotions on both sides inevitably change momentum direction, with fundamentals still strong for Bitcoin, human beings are going to spend more time being optimistic than pessimistic, but the bears still get their time to dominate. The market also operates on many overlapping cycles, so the long term outlook is more unclear than people understand, I think. We also need to pay attention to the health of the traditional markets, anything can happen to really trigger the catalysts that Bitcoin was created for.
I do have to say I hope that this stupid market didn't cause you to run into any big financial troubles. I hate seeing people lose a lot of money and go into ruin. Take care dude.
I'm talking more along the lines of kicking someone when they are already down.


Crypto isn't a zero-sum game, same as stock market.

The sum of people's gains isn't necessarily equal to the sum of people's losses
Correct. As much as it pains me to say it, crypto is honestly structured like a pyramid scheme.
The person who bought Bob's coins paid for Bob's gains, Bob paid for Alice's gains. You are assuming that the person who bought Bob's coin didn't either sell at a profit or sell at break even point, or not sell at all. In this case, who has lost? 

I'm not saying there aren't losers in a market but I'm pretty sure trading isn't a zero sum game, so there doesn't _always_ have to be losers for someone to win. 
17.3k exit is admirable. I was 10.4 and 16.
I would expect bubble mania to manifest in similar ways though. What makes you think its different in this respect?

Also, not exactly winning strategy if you shorted the bottoms. It’s a lot harder to short the tops than the bottoms
That's my hope at least ;)

Other than making money off hype. Do you think it is a legit project?  

Exactly. We may see 100k or we may drop to 1k and never go above.
Not sure why there's something or someone following your posts and downvoting them. Thanks for being nice. Here have an upvote.
Trading in the Zone is a good read on the subject. I know many have probably read it already. 
holy shieet.. I think I have read that *famous* comment. Just wondering how did you take a massive loss? All I see in anotherbot are your massively in the money shorts
You know what's the worst? My comment has 2 upvotes and the guy saying "plan your entrances" when it's hard to see the bottom has 12 upvotes.

People are stupid, and those stupid people are actually financing my future. The world we live in...
That's the point. Holders were bragging that they were better than traders when we were on a bull run. Now they're in despair.

I told it already couple of times. I could buy at 3k. I didn't. I traded. 20k gave holder gains of 650%. I had 800% at the time. We are at 6k now. Holder would have 200% from that 3k. I'm at 500% now... Took some bad loses on this drop, bad trading decisions but still way better than buy and hold.

Holding is easier. But if you don't realize that all of those are just paper profits until you cash out then you've basically lost it all. That's why traders have an advantage and that's what holders don't understand. Buy and hold was ok below $1k, I personally think that below $100 was time to buy and hold, every one that bought above $100 was late to the party. They've had a chance to take up to 200x profits, they didn't. Even if it goes back up or go to 50k ATH all those holders will just hold until next collapse...
No disrespect, but this is all just fiction from your own mind :) 

A true probability analyst would suggest that you need to weight up every possible future outcome to create a balanced picture rather than just one random idea.

You are mixing up Bitcoin with the price of Bitcoin

Noone controls Bitcoin, the decentralized peer to peer network
They've been trying for six months, but Bitcoin is still worth ~6K and won't go much lower.
Kek
And what exactly can miners do with all thay hash power? 

Nothing other than double spend 

You onviously have no idea how Bitcoin works... Decentralization has nothing to do with mining

Also, there are 12 Federal Reserve Banks... thats very different

We're going into weekend. Hate this... But you're probably right here.
I'm a merchant. I hold btc. Debit cards will provide a short term (1to2 years) solution for many people who actually use bitcoin rather than simply trading it. There needs to be a bridge. Debit cards are that bridge. 
Wow, your motto must be "New exchanges, people will dump, more off ramps"

Sure, many may, many wont, many would buy more.
I am sorry for your losses/capitulation.
Should have been more smart about your calls.
Last thing you could is to come here and be salty... oh wait..
Yup.  Just no buffer. Doesn’t take much to get it going one way or another.  I look at the order book and it’s so thin sometimes 1m could probably move it 10% on gdax
> Exchanges popping up just means more off-ramps for people to dump.

I think this statement is enough for me to realize that a discussion with you doesnt make a whole lot of sense.
> Do you really think good traders who hold no strong biases one way or the other actually care about the ideological narrative surrounding Bitcoin as an asset class?

No... which was entirely my point.

They don't care... the price only matters to the traders... it doesn't matter at all in the long run to the people who actually use the currency and actually give it it's value... which only seems to be growing year over year imho.
I'd say the majority of people who short here are simply trying to profit and will buy bitcoin when it's low with their profits.

Most people who short are not trying to destroy bitcoin, just profit from the current of market movements.
I'm not doing that at all. I want it to succeed. I don't want $3K. But the market is going to go where it's going to go. I'm not a market mover. I want more BTC without spending more fiat, and that's why I trade with leverage. Long or short, it's really the same thing. I'm just trying to get more coin by moving with the market.

Yes you get more coins by shorting than you do by longing, but I certainly don't want it to fail. 
We survived 180.00 in 2014 without permanent reputational damage...
fucking lame.
I have a few small buy orders in on a couple alts for this purpose. I actually came within 10% of one a couple weeks back. Would have been sweet. 
Hmmm this kind of hair-brained scheme is right up my alley - let me know if you two advance this idea so I can put my buys $.01 above yours ;)

Tbh i dont really know much about trading hahahaahahah hence i always end up with the DCA meme strategy. Honestly i dont think DCA even works. Every single time lump sum buying or selling would have done better.

Just hanging out here with my trigger finger on when to start buying back in again, which is quite boring so i ended up posting on reddit again despite not doing so since July
That is a terrible source. Apple doesn't tell anyone what its BOM costs are. Apple's suppliers can't say how much they are charging Apple, or risk being dropped as a supplier. All of these analysts doing is they are guessing more or less randomly. Since no one have real numbers, they can make up any number they want and no one can say that they are just bullshitting.

Apple's own financial reports say that profits are somewhere on the 25&#37; rate. There are marketing costs and R&D costs, so the BOM is likely to be lower than 75&#37; of retail, but likely not much lower then 50&#37;.

(I know a fair number of people in the industry, who at least know the real cost of one component in one of the major phones. None of them think that these reports are anything close to reality for the components they make/sell/are responsible for.)
[deleted]
np :) 
But more participants wouldn't necessarily correlate with a worse sentiment. I think the type of participant must have also changed. Or perhaps because the run up in 2014 occured in only a month, way fewer people had a chance to buy high vs 2017 where most people who bought even in september would be at a loss now and so the ratio of people at a loss vs those who are not is higher this time around.
That's true, we've not really spent enough time down here for people to "accept" it internally. 

And it was below $7k for like what, 12 hours in February? I guess it is pretty different, you're right
OK thx 
LTC was $50 back in 2014, isn't that insane

lol @ edit too
TA can be mathematical, but putting the word "fact" in there is dangerous in my view. On balance of probabilities determined normally by a backtest, any particular trading method is either ineffective or effective. I haven't come to peruse this sub from somewhere else, I too trade and know what a market cycle is.

That's my point though: draw a trendline through bottoms on a logarithmic scale and say "as long as Bitcoin stays above this line, long term bull market continues". I'm not saying this isn't as legitimate a charting approach as any - it's the most basic and tried and true; indeed the market can fall 95% to that line and still bounce back to all time highs next halving after wicking off that line. Not to mention, that line is going to be broken sooner or later.

I just see it as very unlikely given the public awareness of the asset today - it's not just a nerd's plaything but a recognised asset, even if it makes up a zero or negligible portion of most investment portfolios. It's not a penny stock equivalent anymore. I agree, that is based quite partially on feeling - and there is nothing wrong with that despite the title of this sub - this is unexplored territory for Bitcoin.

The asset has come a long way from its 15 minutes of fame in 2013. At best, if one compares Bitcoin to gold when it was burgeoning in the 70s and 80s (and this is the stage I see Bitcoin at), the bottom of every market cycle was substantially higher than the high of the previous cycle - not a wick off it, it didn't even come close - made a triple bottom, falling beneath an ascending wedge, before a recovery. I expect to see relatively similar action if my belief in the value proposition of Bitcoin long term is to be maintained. (And no, I don't view the current price action like AMZN in the dot-com bubble either :P).
I don't disagree - it is indeed a more sophisticated version of "this time it's different".

And that's reasonable to me. At some point, the log trend will be broken; or average volatility will go down and the market will find an equilibrium; things are going to be different as the market grows and matures. It is extremely shortsighted to assume the dynamics will remain precisely the same as the past. 

Traders love to look at charts and correlate future from past - and that's all well and good - I don't think it's astrology at all, and I've been trading this bear market using the technical tools available to me. 

But assuming previous levels of downwards volatility when Bitcoin wasn't far from a penny stock should also hold true today while shouting from the rooftops that you're a "long-term bull" is both naive and hypocritical in my eyes. What it actually means is you're a long-term bear because you want perhaps the foremost value proposition of Bitcoin to be destroyed with the eyes of the world watching and real value investors on the sidelines. That is what I was trying to point out.

If your TA says Bitcoin has strong support at 1k (top kek), and you're positioning yourself with the expectation that it will touch 1k, even but for a moment, just so you can go YOLO all-in 5x long on Mex, that's cool - I applaud your gambling chops at the very least. However, if you also think the rest of the public (who is aware of Bitcoin by now) is going to follow you longing this market long-term after watching this absolute train wreck on the fundamental reasoning that Bitcoin remains a store of value or "digital gold", you're paying too much attention to the charts. Either that, or you believe Bitcoin's strongest fundamentals are something else entirely, in which case it would be interesting to know what you think they are.

Broadly, what I'm saying is that fundamentals must form a part of a trader's arsenal for long-term analysis - they must be paired with the technicals. Very basic indicators such as network value to transaction ratios and suchlike have a role to play, but comparing Bitcoin to similar assets with similar value proposition and examining their market history is particularly helpful.

Because I believe its strongest long-term value proposition is likely to be as a store of value (although there will be others hopefully), I try to place reasonable limits on how strong a bear cycle should be - assuming the fundamentals still remain sound. The very simplest comparison is to the early beginnings of Gold futures - the correction from top to bottom was around 70% there. Now that's not a hard limit, but alongside a body of other fundamental and technical indicators, it is a useful number for both the speculative daytrader and particularly for the value investor.

Hope this answer helps :).

For long time I had a certain amount that was a curse. Every time I reached it my next trade was 20% down. One or series of trades. Approached it like 8 times before I managed to break it. I just went close to it and did couple very safe trades with quick profits. Psychologically broken the curse.
Scale down. Close all, leave hedge open until it reverses or the direction will be clear.

Well this is my point. You may have 'lost' $20k but looks like you're still up overall. A totally different situation to /u/JKing355 or myself. Oh well 
No problem
If you think 4.5 - 5k is a likely bottom why havent you already secured profits and scale in again closer to the "bottom"?
yeah, naked shorting is when you short more than the notional fiat value of your crypto portfolio.

You are the effectively naked short the difference

If the price goes down, you make fiat (but never more than you shorted (num contracts) in total)

If the price goes up, your losses are unbounded
Sorry, got my numbers mixed up, you're right.
A breakdown of the wedge, though, not horizontal support. Often good value to be had shorting the breakdown of descending support. 
Don't be too flattered, my exes will attest my memory is dangerously shit
I'll try to post better evidence when I'm able. Happy trading and shitpost removing!
I can agree that someone started it. But the fact we haven't barted down, and instead, took another leg up, goes to show us people were waiting to buy at these levels if it turned out to be the reversal. 
Alright well, bottom and remain at bottom then. Just as bad for me.
Yeah sleep on it. All we have is time anyways. This never seems to end.
Come on now. 80% total market cap loss. Alts dying left and right. BTC from 20K to about 5K. 

It's fucking bad. You can't compare it side by side with Gox. You have to take into consideration BTC was much more popular this time around.

With the popularity considered, it's actually worse than Gox.
Dude, just stop. How have mods not banned you for this? 

If you don't have proof then you don't have a case and you certainly don't need to make every comment about Tether FUD.

You're obnoxious af.
I hope you're right. It breaks my heart to see the market dying like this.
I never put in any more than I can afford to lose.

HOWEVER, I have lost money (obviously), and it pisses me off that i've been sitting here trying to give this market the benefit of the doubt for 6 months and seeing nothing but more blood.

I love bear cycles just as much as the next guy, but this stinks of death/stagnation.
Ok, that I agree.
[deleted]
In stock - ok.

In crypto? How come? If this goes back to 0 then it is zero-sum game, for now it isn't as this is still rolling.
It's what I wrote in other reply. It's a zero sum game if there will be no more buyers or it goes to 0. For now I'm assuming that those who sold at loss paid you. It's not like nobody lost. For now there's probably more people that are up than those who are down as we are still close to $6k. But still... There are a lot of people who lost a lot. Thinking that you are up and you didn't get your gains from people who lost money... You're either blind or stupid.
> I'm pretty sure trading isn't a zero sum game, so there doesn't always have to be losers for someone to win. 

That's because an asset almost never goes all the way to $0, but it is a zero sum game. 
>You are assuming that the person who bought Bob's coin didn't either sell at a profit or sell at break even point, or not sell at all.

You can't arbitrarily bound the system so that no one is left holding the bag. This is how they sell pyramid schemes (known as HODLing in the cryptocurrency space). If Gary buys Bob's coin and never sells it, he has lost however much he paid for it.

>but I'm pretty sure trading isn't a zero sum game, so there doesn't always have to be losers for someone to win.

What are the uses of Intel stock vs the uses for BTC? Who controls the supply of Intel stock vs who controls the stock of BTC?

Lines we didn't see for 9 months... Don't trust them :)
That’s the same figure I’ve had on tradingview for myself for the past few weeks. This form of long-term support is reassuring, especially considering we are still recovering from a stupidly high FOMO peak.

I feel like these lines are most important at the moment, considering which side of the lines we are sitting on. My historical support line goes all the way back to early 2015 though, and reaches the descending support line closer to $4.2k.

https://www.tradingview.com/i/W1CP9Qqw/

(The candles haven’t been updated in a week or two, but we’ve been riding descending support since then)
There is never a reason except one concocted in retrospect.
It is a direct instantaneous reflection of the coins that each individual holds at that point in time. It is not double the money that people have invested... but the XMR that everybody holds is now worth twice as much what it used to be, which is itself a force on the market.

Yes, if it goes up or down it may influence people buying, selling, whatever, and that will cause the market cap to change.

But as an instantaneous psychological representation of the money that everybody in the market holds in bitcoin... it is for me a useful way to think about it. I'm not really commenting on what it represents in real terms, but I am commenting on the way people feel about their crypto holdings.
A company stock with 1B marketcap doesn't have 1B dollar invested in it either. It doesn't change the fact it is worth 1B.

As long as an asset can be exchanged with a price when maintaining a reasonably stable price, it is worth that much.

There's a downvote bot on me lately! I was getting -7 on every comment I made last night. Looks like they eased up a bit on me! Lol

Thanks mate!
Well I used to trade on gdax...badly. Took about a 1/3 hit to my entire crypto investment just from doing that. So about 30% losses.

Then I learned about margin trading :)

Made about 15% of my original investment back- I was almost in the green again and feeling good after I shorted $13k, closed at $11k, longed $10k, closed at $11k. 

Leveraged higher, put more on the line- longed the top and closed at the bottom. Lost 60% of my total investment.

Took a break for a few weeks, came back. Lost another 10%. was down 70% on my entire total investment when I decided that I wasn't going out like a chump- kept 25% of my fiat available for hedging in case bitmex engine shit itself and I needed to long. 

Put 5% of my total investment on bitmex and said I'd give myself another chance at trading as long as I had a plan and stopped being so emotional. 5% of my total investment- shorted the absolute hell out of $11.7k, using 2014 price movements as a guide on where we'd go. Rode it down to $6.5k, closed it all at $8k although I did try to short again and closed it at a loss at $8500 (my original short, I fucked up market close on the BGD, could've closed at $7.4k). Longed $8.9k and then re-shorted $9.6k and have now turned it into 75% of my total investment...well if I close here. 

Went from being extremely up on the bull run to net 0% to -70% back up to about +15% lol. Still make mistakes all the time and if I closed on the BGD earlier correctly I could have about 2x that right now. But oh well, we all make mistakes. 
Well, in my opinion you are kind of late if you were to sell now. You might be cutting your own fingers. Hence I said it is now time to plan your entrances with the fiat you earned when you sold high. I also did not say to enter right now, but to "plan" (watch the market and figure out a good entry point). People are selling right now and good traders should go against the trend of the majority.
I really didn't realize I was in bitcoinmarkets.. there's a couple of hundred thousands working on Ethereum based things. 
Well, and censor transactions.
So now your argument is "bitcoin is centralized but hey, it doens't matter, miners can't do anything anyways".

Nice.

Kind of like how you guys changed from "hey it doesn't matter bitcoin failed as a currency, now it's a store of value".

Let's get some wheels for those goal posts bud.

> All of these analysts doing is they are guessing more or less randomly.

You're obviously right.
> **was** a huge success

Emphasis on *was*. There's an arbitrary time period where bitconnect performed just as well as EOS has since October. 
There is a logarathmic factor of higher quantity of people who are experiencing a bear market for the first time, and crypto has a much more active reddit ecosystem than in 2014.

Sentiment is likely similar if we were able to accurately get a "mean" or "median" sentiment of all participants. Right now we just see a larger bad sentiment mode.


You may be right that the type of participant has expanded to include more of an "average Joe". I would say many many more "average Joe" millenials are involved this time around. I just don't know if there was always the same proportion of them, but the whole cryptosphere is just so much larger than it was then.
No it wasn’t

I came here to be spoonfed
Sorry if you feel that way. What I was getting at is a few guys got "manipulated" in closing a short, because of other posters. I find that funny.

Chewtoy came in and gave an explanation why he closed, and other closed based on chewtoy. I'm just baffled by the mentality of this sub were diverging thoughts are bashed until proving right and everyone circle jerks themselves with similar opinions.

Because that became a likely target after the meme triangle broke down. Once it did break down, it broke violently into the mid 6.5ks. I waited for a relief rally, and didn't get it and I continue to wait and not act emotionally. Would I have been better off if I capitulated 6.5k? sure, but I'm trying to do this according to my plan for once and not act on emotions which screwed me so many times in the past. I am going to wait for another rally. We are 8 weeks in the red, and long overdue for a relief rally. Will we get it? I hope so, but I also don't think we're far from the bottom (4.5k isnt really that far relatively speaking.)

Also I've secured profits many times in the past, but into fiat, for myself. Out of the market. I've cashed out several multiples of my initial investment, so I could never really be truly in the red.
Also take into account with post-only you can't set a limit order at the current price for a quick fill.  If you're trading often this may matter to you. 
hahahaha
I’m not so sure, could be almost equal low volume activity, or bots designed to maintain a narrow price range for buying or selling.

If I was a market manipulator I would probably want to bart the price up, then control the price at the higher level until I sold my desired amount of coins at the higher level, then bart it back down and buy the same coins back at a lower price.

I would probably do it in such a way that the long/short squeeze greased the wheels.

Then throw some regular people into the mix, all over the backdrop of actual market fundamental forces. Complex mix of factors I suppose, but these overt examples are pretty despicable. 
It being much more popular means it should drop even lower, because the weak hand ratio is higher.

That's why i still bet we'll see a $1800 bottom and new ATH a few months after halvening. 

Business as usual. 
> If you don't have proof then you don't have a case and you certainly don't need to make every comment about Tether FUD.

it was on the fucking new york times bro, bloomberg, time... etc the texas university paper.

thats called proof.

just because tether and co come out a few days later say na na na na boo boo not true doesn't mean they telling the truth
What’s your prediction? 0?
I'm with you man. I almost capitulated earlier this month but instead I took a break for a few days and started trying to trade, and it's been going alright. I think the main reason I haven't actually capitulated for real is because I don't have much to lose. This market really does piss me off sometimes.
oh lordy, are you for real? You realize that selling is actually a lot worse than shorting, right? Selling carries no guarantee that the person will buy again. Shorting does. Margin makes no difference. If I have 10 BTC and I short 10x, I sell 100 BTC with a promise to buy that 100 BTC back later. If Joe Cryptomillionaire sells 100 BTC, that's the exact same market effect, except he doesn't promise to buy it back.

I recommend taking some time to learn market mechanics. 
Yes, it is a zero-sum game over the lifespan of crypto under the strong assumption that all crypto assets go back to 0
if new money is entering then no- but new money always stops entering at some point.

Many many people disagree with you that trading is a zero sum game.
Of course the Bitcoins will exist and someone will own them. There will always be bag holders. Saying that someone _has_ to lose for someone else to profit is incorrect though. Trading is  not a zero sum game http://www.businessinsider.com/the-stock-market-is-not-a-zero-sum-game-2013-4

> If Gary buys Bob's coin and never sells it, he has lost however much he paid for it.

If Gary's Bitcoin goes up 50% and he doesn't sell them has he made a profit? No he hasn't, those are unrealised gains. In the same way Gary has not realised a loss if his Bitcoins go down 50% and he doesn't sell them.
Are there really so many uses cases for BTC right now to differentiate it apart Intel's stock in a positive way?

Don't get me wrong I am long BTC but we have to face the fact that we may never recover from this drop.

They held as valid for longer than 9 months, so I wouldn't count them out either. I'm definitely not relying on them. Truthfully I don't think we go under the ATH line, and I don't think we bottom under $4800, but we shall see.

Damn.. nice write up!

Most people can't mentally/monetarily recover from those losses. I guess you're one of the lucky ones who learned from mistakes and became a real trader. Good luck with your trades Sloppy!
It depends. Plan might be like this:

I sell here, re-buy at 4k or 7k. I either take $1k loss or $2k win.

Good traders are short for a while now...
yes, and they do neither... ever

There are no larger reorgs or no known censored transactions on the record
Miners don’t make Bitcoin any more centralized. They have no power other than the ability to double spend. They can’t even successfully censor transactions since SlushPool gets a block in every mow and then.

Miners have no powrr

I’m not moving the goalposts. You just have no
clue what you’re talking about.

Leave the thinking to the big boys homie

Bitcoin mever failed as a porotocol... thats all I care about since ~10 USD/BTC
It's a downvote bot for sure.

Wanna know what's funny? I tried to test it out in an 18 day old thread.

3 minutes...5 upvotes. Bot is trying to cover its tracks very hard lol

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8q6lf4/daily_discussion_monday_june_11_2018/e1ixtv7/?context=1

it's now back to normal (I think they caught on quickly that I was testing it to report to the admins), but you can see the screenshot showed it had 5 upvotes in 1 minute. Obviously I could be lying/using inspect element but I have no reason to do so. 

It's very obvious someone is following me with a downvote bot. 
Lol, I just closed mine. Almost 20% stack gain on those 2 trades. I can live with that ;-)
You're terribly mistaken, but good luck to you. 
You are taking it too personally. Any asset class that is going to make it in the long run needs to be able to succeed in spite of shorting. If it isn’t resilient to this then it’s got no chance anyway.

Also incidentally, shorting is not a new thing for BTC, it’s been around for years during and before the most recent bull run so it’s not like it has come along and taken it out or anything. 

I get you need someone to blame but people should have the ability to short if they so wish 
LOL - hilarious, You're mad because the market is acting like...a market?
Sounds good bud
it was $40, mb

https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20131201/
why do u come here? just curious - see you popping in here every once in a while. did u used to hold or are u trading?
lol @ nocoiner
Wait really. We've had this exact conversation before? Smh

I knew I've had this conversation before with someone but I didn't recognize your username
Just don't worry, you'll get there eventually.

If you want to know, I have my trading strategy that depends on my profits. Let's say I normally trade with 1 BTC and 2x lev, I have 75% cap. If I'll lose 25% then I use smaller lev (0.5-1x) and take profits faster until I'll get back to 100%, then I use bigger lev again. If I get some profits (25%) I move my normal trading amount to 1.25 BTC and do it all over again. If my entry is on good profit I can get my lev even higher but then I have stop on be.

It's a strategy that can take long to get good profits, needs some self control, but it's safe. Lower lev gives you more room for mistakes. It took me a lot of time to get back my loses cause every time I lost I used smaller entry for next trade, but consequently bite after bite I got it back.
You can go with my strategy. 10-30% kicker every now and then. It'll be really nice entry for reversal that you can add to. If it drops then not a big loss.
Why throw your own money into it and as I said no funding
[removed]
When you say interest payments, are we talking loans etc here to buy btc ? 
Makes sense... hindsight is always 20/20. The relief will come. As sure as the sun will rise. Of that much at least I am sure. When you take emotion out of the game it all becomes much easier. 
You are an idiot if you think that paper *proved* anything. Furthermore, the paper was published by a professor/student combo at **UT Austin**, not "the texas university". You're apparently not even familiar with UT as an institution and yet you're blindly following a speculative paper that was **self published, without peer review**. Lastly, the NYTimes, or an other news organization that reported on this, did not report on the validity of the paper, they just reported on the paper itself. Any conclusions are speculative and completely circumstantial (and mostly nonsensical).

It's amazing that you spin everything into the worst possible catastrophe for Tether. You apparently don't even understand most of the news and writings you post. 

Why are you so sure you're right when there's no smoking gun?
No, ofcourse not. 0 is ludicrous. My prediction is dip to 3-4K and stagnate forever. 
[deleted]
Or there will be no buyers.

For now you can say that somebody who just entered paid for your gains and didn't have to cut the loses yet, but one day he will. Those who entered on a bull run, got burned and won't come back, those are the ones who lost a lot, so if you're up, then those guys gave away their money to you.
> I wouldn't count them out either. I'm definitely not relying on them. 

Exactly.

> Truthfully I don't think we go under the ATH line

This line goes down very fast

> I don't think we bottom under $4800

Why?

I don't think we can break $5k. Old ATH. If we will then this has no bottom...
I am an extremely stubborn person...I told a lot of people about my losses and they thought I was crazy for doing it, which I was. but I figured it was so little of my money left that if I lost it all i'd just move on. 
FDs
Thanks mate you too :) Im sure i'll take another big hit at some point. Just gotta learn how to bounce back and not take it personally. It's all about maintaining the profit you do make- limiting losses. Everybody wins at some point :)
So...bitcoin is decentralized and trustless.....but we have to trust that our completely centralized miners won't censor transactions.  Makes sense if you stand on your head, squint with one eye, and slightly cock your head to the left.
> Bitcoin mever failed as a porotocol... thats all I care about since ~10 USD/BTC

Yea except the time the block chain was hacked and 184 billion bitcoins printed.  Go ahead, move the goal posts again LOL

"Bitcoin only catastrophically failed once, but it only happened once so check mate nocoiner!"
That's fucking crazy! But also kinda flattering that someone has in for you so bad. I noticed that normal replies from you that were pretty innocuous statements were heavily downvoted.

Btw, talking about bots, have you made any progress on the bot you were talking about to collect the open interest info from bitmex? I think it was very telling when it kept going up with price on a down trend and volume declining. 
I'm closing Sept and I'll bail on swaps with absurdly tight stops. 
Why not? I'm just stating my opinion, i'm not offending anyone. People here are so one sided its pitiful, bears who want price to fall are downvoted, while the same comments telling us bears we are gonna get rekt are upvoted. 

Im sitting in fiat.
I'm feeling offended, can you stop, please?
Might have been another account, i switch regularly. I've been here for 4 years lol...

because if tether was legit they would have done an audit by now instead of handwaving bullshit thats why

if tether was legit theyd certainly stop claiming to be professionally audited

if tether was legit with all of the fud around them and bad news they'd certainly maybe stop issuing tethers until they sort out their auditing problem

tether promised audits from the start and never not once provided a single audit, thats not a good actor.

why are you so convinced they are totally on the up and up?
Stagnate at 3-4K usd forever?

How do you tie the concept of a deflationary asset and stagnation? It’s not possible. 
I'm sorry that you're dense.
> Selling means that the motherfucker can't sell again.
> 
> 

and they're less likely to buy back.......shorting means you *have* to buy back...
That logic applies to stock market as well, and we know that it's been estabilshed that it's not a zero-sum game.

I know where you're coming from, and I agree to some extent that one's gain is another's loss. (mostly whales' gains lol) but I was just viewing it from a strict academic definition of zero-sum game.
So you're saying I should pull my last 3 buys between 4800-5000? :P

There's actually an interesting potential formation (charted on coinbase only because it was a clean chart): https://www.tradingview.com/x/PWA66I0s/
Well, the fact is that they dont censor transactions.

They are not systematically censoring transactions.

And there is still 20% of hash rate that won’t censor your transaction no matter what.
you obviously don't understand the incentive system of BTC and what makes it so genius. Anyone who gains enough hash power to attack the chain will have to invest so much money into attaining that hash power that they would lose more in the devaluation of their holdings and loss of future revenue than they could ever stand to make even with the most absurdly optimistic double spend attack. For example Bitmain could double spend and potentially wipe out the order books on every major exchange making some 9 figure sum (realistically they would be unable to pull all of this money off the exchange since huge withdrawals are manually reviewed). In doing so they would crash the price of BTC and immediately lose billions of dollars in the loss of value in their Bitcoins alone. They would also lose money on ASIC sales as demand falls. They would lose tens of billions in future mining revenues. Nobody is going to lose billions to make millions. It is a non-issue. Not to mention as the network grows in value more groups will be incentivized to develop their own ASICs (i.e. major electronics manufacturers like Samsung which have the infrastructure to outcompete Bitmain even). The only coins that have ever successfully been attacked averaged only a small portion of the average hash power of whatever algo they run in the world. For example Bitcoin Gold was able to be attacked because someone was able to rent a bunch of hash power from a Zcash mining pool and point it at BTG temporarily attaining 51%. Since they have no investment in BTG an attack is logical. However with Bitcoin, almost all of the SHA256 hashing power in the world is already aimed at the network; there is no secondary utility for this hash power either so everyone controlling this hash power has the obvious incentive to protect their golden goose; otherwise they would have spent billions of dollars on paperweights. If anybody wanted to 51% BTC it would be literally impossible because there isn't enough SHA256 out there to overwhelm the hashpower already mining blocks. 
The block chain was not hacked. There was a bug in the cod base that didnt check for/guard againt int overflow in transaction verification. The chain was hardforked and the whole ordeal took less than 24 hours to fix. And that was in 2010. That’s not exactly a protocol failure

You’re such a tool
Yea, it's definitely a bot, kinda annoying :/ oh well

And I believe /u/cryptosecrecy has been working on it lately!

For what it's worth, 12 hours ago bitmex open interest was 94322 xbt  at $5890. After that pump it hit 82175! Lol
Not a bad idea. I'm just going home so I'll be busy for couple hours.
If you’re such a bear, where’s your 10x short?
> I'm just stating my opinion, i'm not offending anyone

pretty sure "bulltard" will offend some people.
There's a higher standard here than to post opinions without any sort of support whatsoever.  It's noise.  Your comment is noise, and it's only there to make your opinion feel valid.
[removed]
> because if tether was legit they would have done an audit by now instead of handwaving bullshit thats why

Nope I've already explained how there are alternative reasons for this. You just jump to the worst possible conclusion,

>why are you so convinced they are totally on the up and up?

On the up and up? What are you even talking about? I'm completely agnostic to everything regarding Finex and Tether. I don't use either, so I don't care. Bitcoin is an ecosystem. Finex and Tether are just a small part of that ecosystem. Are they solvent? The answer is unsettled. You're welcome to have your theories, but stop pushing these ridiculous theories as if they're fact. You're purposefully trying to mislead people. I doubt you even read the UT paper. 

Go troll somewhere else. 
Why is it not possible? 

It can go down to 3K and bounce back to 4K and rinse and repeat. Ping ponging for eternity.
[deleted]
Stock is a bit different game. But yeah, won't argue here, you know my point, that's good enough for me.
I'm aware of that one.

Catching scalps is one thing, trading lev is different.
Hypothetically, the Chinese government could talk to all the largest miners and tell them that they need to censor transactions from blacklisted addresses, and to orphan blocks that contain transactions from blacklisted addresses.

Is this likely? Probably not, but it should be part of a risk profile when investing in btc.
Holy hell, that's a lot of shorts! I bet there's a few more underwater now.
I hate to say it but it does make you wonder how many MMs lurk here and base their ideas for moves on the current memes of thinking. I hate getting conspiratorial but I gotta think there are >0 big actors doing this
Bailed on the YOLO short too lol
please, stop harrasing me. Im actually considering suicide now
[removed]
 nonsense u are way too triggered. If u really cared about crypto u'd care about fraud, just like I warned about pirateat40 and mtgox

every gov will look at fraud them say this is why we can't do it and use it as excuse to ban it
Because of basic economics, the supply naturally restricts over time ergo a price rise (or zeroing) is inevitable. 

I am around for about as long as you are. We’ve seen way worse drops in percentage terms. 

Why are you so “it’s different this time”?

Trade volume, transactions etc etc are all > than early 2017. 


lol /u/sloppysynapses and I sure do want $0 BTC. INFINITE ROE ON DEM SHORTS

I think you should rethink BTC and invest in some SALT.
yes, I agree this is true. But 20% of the hash power will still mine your tx
that's not shorts, it's just open positions on bitmex! it includes all positions on xbtusd
sometimes I think it's manipulation -others I think it's just how the market naturally moves a lot
I have no clue why suicide jokes are funny to people
[removed]
Because of the loss of volume and market cap so rapidly in the face of good news and mainstream popularity (December). 

Word gets around fast in this day and age, and it looks like Crypto's name is tarnished beyond repair. Everyone and their mother knows what horrors lie in the realm of scams and volatility. 


Yeah, but if that 20%'s blocks are being orphaned by the 80%, if you have money in a blacklisted address, it's worthless.
Yeah of course but that drop in positions makes me think it was a lot of shorts closing on that green dildo. 
Definitely. But a downvote bot trained on a popular bear (rather, not permabull) is a hand tip to me that some are. Unless you've just made enemies
cause he's a child, "dank pepe m9"
[removed]
Hmm, maybe you’re right 
yeah, ok thats very true... at which point we would just uasf to a new pow algorithm
Ooh I see. Yes, definitely lol
ooooh you're talking about *here* lol. But why would they downvote me if they were going to pump it today? Hahaha
agreed
[removed]
Yeah man, that’s why I think being able to see changes in open interest would be cool, for example for any divergence with volume.
This is why I hate wading into these waters
Mate that's brilliant
