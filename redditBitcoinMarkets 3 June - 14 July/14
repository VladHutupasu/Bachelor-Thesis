Well, the second quarter has just ended and we are entering the third quarter. I'm gonna share a fact which is not related to technical analysis or trading, but I found it interesting anyways.



This is the first time in Bitcoin's history in which the Quarter 2 closing price has been lower than the opening price.


____



**2011**: $0.78 -> $16.10 



**2012**: $4.91 -> $6.69 



**2013**: $93.03 -> $97.51 



**2014**: $458.50 -> $639.36 



**2015**: $243.39 -> $262.48 



**2016**: $415.16 -> $672.48 



**2017**: $1,079.75 -> $2,499.98 



**2018**: $6,926.02 -> $6,387.31

Another random fun fact: This is not related to the other fact in any way. The first recorded exchange price for Bitcoin was on New Liberty Standard on October 5, 2009, at a price of *$0.00076 USD*. This price was calculated by energy costs, it was not on any exchanges until 2010.
We’ve got _potential_ hidden bullish divergences on all charts from 1-4H (signalling continuation of the short term uptrend). It’s pretty weak on all timeframes because it’s not spanning very far, and not yet confirmed since we need to make a higher high on price first. But it might be something to keep an eye on:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/HB2ZA48W/

We’ve also got the 10k trend line sitting just above. That line is what stopped the breakout yesterday and will likely continue to provide some decent resistance. Here’s the macro view of that line:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/7HcN8RoC/

Despite that trend line, I’m leaning short term bullish. The 2H Ichimoku chart is looking absolutely beautiful in that sense:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/UxhPB7hZ/

- Price above cloud (successful test of support)
- Lagging price above cloud
- Bullish TK cross
- Bullish cloud twist, not yet!

So we are only waiting for that cloud twist to confirm short term bullishness. But remember that this is only on the 2H chart.

Despite short term bullishness I’m still set on 6800-6900 being a great r/r for a short. I’m basing that on very strong resistance shown from 6H cloud chart.

But until then, it looks like we might make another leg up.

Edit: Last time we had all bull signals confirm on the 2H cloud it took us from 6800 up to 10k. That in itself doesn’t mean anything, just an interesting piece of information.

Edit2: Clarified that any "bullishness" is only short term. Trend is still down, and I think we will see lower lows on daily/weekly timeframes.
Thought I'd throw in my analysis :) 

Major confluence at 6170 which is why that's my target for this retracement which I think is coming. 1:1 correction for ABC as well as the .5 retracement of that prior move up to 6570. 

Shorting from here to 6405 looks good to me. I honestly don't think we'll get higher than that for now, but I'll be doubling my position at 6437 if we move up there.

Updated version of that BTC monthly returns chart that everyone was posting a few months back: https://imgur.com/6ECH8Ze
While people today in this thread seem to be bored today, I think the failure to dump like normal is actually very interesting. 
How much should we be paying attention [to this black line](https://www.tradingview.com/x/RMwJf3eW/) on the weekly chart which is clearly long term support? 

Based on all previous “bottoms” before our parabolic advance (which was broken in December obviously) it looks like we’ve got quite a bit further down to go. Like ~$2,000 more...

I mean we could get a nice bounce from where we are now and go sideways for a bit until that black line comes up a ways. So maybe $2,000 is an exaggeration. 

Really puts things into perspective.
I'm taking a day or two off from crypto unless I see some price action. Crypto aka educated gambling is consuming my life.

Some TA, so this doesn't become a shitpost: I don't really see signs of accumulation, and this bull flag taking so fucking long to complete is making me skeptical. It wouldn't surprise me if it barts back down to 5900 even.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/qNbmkldj/
Lots of traders have been banking on the short side in the last months. Now new traders are starting to short at the year's low to recoup some losses. My feeling is that this is pretty similar to new people starting to buy at ATH and it will not end well.
These bull flags / bear flags that take days to complete / bart are coin flips especially with low volume. I closed my BTC & alt long at 6340, and now feel like an idiot since alts are rising back up.

Someone hodl and comfort me. :'(
Is it just me or have the December Futures in Bitmex not opened yet? It feels so weird, looking at just one future's market... 
I got laser surgery done the other day and didn't have buys set up for the dip and missed the last one because my eyes were too shit to look at screens still. 

Based on my Youtube and Twitter feeds it seems like everybody is 100% confident we are going to go below 5k.  Even that snooby El Erian guy now wants to buy who i distinctly remember bashing BTC.  Its almost like ppl feel entitled to get BTC at those prices? Kind of BS and a slap in the face to the ppl who were buying last summer and had to endure the market then.  You could argue it was even more risky, with the infamous BTC fork and china shutting down exchanges as well as other stuff.  So we will see what happens, but i will be laughing if it never gets there.  
Happy Canada Day to all of the Canadians out there!!!
It certainly feels this is one of those times where price gradually creeps up but people don't believe. We have beeen trained to sell the bounce and cover the dips. Traders are skeptical. Price action is weak, volume creeps up slowly. Only when major technicals are broken before they change their mind. And that level is much higher than today

Edit1: charts below in discussion
Hello there guys. Been lurking around this sub since last autumn, have decided to finally drop a line and say hi. :)

 I am no TA expert; bought my first BTC during the bull-run in late 2013, traded some, profited some, but sold a lot during the long bear market that followed. Invested again more heavily in early 2017, and still holding a lot of underwater positions both in BTC and a few select alts, although overall we're still well above my initial entries from last year. 

With that said, still kind of depressed by the current state of the market, but trust things will start to turn around sooner rather than later. Delusional? Perhaps. But I'm not making the same mistake of selling and walking away for a second time. :)

Also, a lot of really high quality posters here, so wanted to say I really appreciate it.
Does anyone in here trade futures on OKex?  If so, how does it compare to BitMEX?     
I've got a good thing going trading alts on mex to increase my BTC stack, but I've been wondering if I might be missing opportunities afforded by the much broader spread of contracts on OKex.
Do not margin long. Do not margin long. Do not margin long... ahh fuck it. xD 
***** Crickets chirping 

Goodnight BM. Tomorrow is another day. 
Here comes the shakeout, lets see if support holds.
This dump is looking far weaker than anything we have been used to over the past few weeks.
Seemed like a safe place to open a short from 6370 with the 10k resistance line just above. Macd and stoch rsi 3h, 4h, 6h, 12h looks bearish, 1d+3d maybe bullish.  Layered stops above resistance. Even a wick above it would be bullish though.
As mentioned many times, I'm not a trader but are there any indications that second half of the years (i.e as of today 1st July) tend to be better uptrends for next 6 months?
My sub 1000 call for the year looks unlikely now. Why you ask? Because every bozo with a mouse and keyboard is now asking how to short bitcoin, if coinbase allows shorting, what does shorting even mean, ect ect...
I think we're near a bottom.
Turn that frown... upside down! https://imgur.com/a/Jmyqy6Z
What that 50btc's doing on the ask. Finex.
Moving up and down  
what are the benefits of trading the regular futures versus the perpetual on Bitmex?
Came here before i made a move, saw the shit show, sat back down on the sidelines
I've had some fiat invested in crypto for about a year, doubled my investment, then lost it all, and eventually fell into the negative by just hodling through this major correction. I just found this sub after being a daily discussion lurker of /r/cryptocurrency for the past months. 

My question to you guys: What's a starting point to learning about indicators, trends, technical analysis, etc? You guys seem to have a lot of knowledge about the trends with BTC by analyzing different metrics. I recently bought [this](https://www.amazon.com/Charting-Technical-Analysis-Fred-McAllen- ebook/dp/B007PRECN2/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?ie=UTF8&qid=1530495001&sr=8-2-spons&keywords=technical+analysis&psc=1) book as a bottom line starting point for understanding graphs, but this book is written in the context of the stock market, so I don't know if it relates to crypto. 

If you would be so kind as to share what resources, books, videos, etc. were a starting point for you to understand a basic level of technical analysis, I would greatly appreciate it. 


prediction for the upcoming two months I will be trading after those.? Have a Nice day
december futures are up on mex, pump it so we can all get good entries.
Haven't seen this posted before, but if you draw a trendline from 2013 ATH, through a major resistance-turned-support around 5000 from the beginning of the bullrun in 2017 then it perfectly matches the 5810 bottom we've reached recently.

Don't know if there is much significance to it, but it's always funny when those lines align this well.  
   

since it's Sunday I can still say a few words ;-)
Have you seen this painting? does that confirm your vision of xbt ... are you ready for 10k?

Looks like we are in the midst of a bulltrap. I have a feeling we will bart sideways for a while than drop to retest 5800 support. Good idea to short this bart

Almost 0 organic increase in price since early may, I wouldn't be shocked if this crash below 5700 this time.
Well, I'm back from vacation, so I guess it's time to open a short!

!short XBTUSD 6359.1 5X 3%
Where can I see the bitmex liquidation data?
Gdax bot freak out going full speed again, not sure if that's bearish or bullish.
Do many people use the Bitmex "Downs" to hedge their leveraged long btc futures? I just matched the premium I paid for the Down contracts with the amount of margin I isolated for the futures, so I am really just longing volatility. If the price gets to the liquidation level over the next 4 days then I would imagine that enough people would pile into the Down kx that I would break even at least. Do other people do this? and if not then why not? 
!short XBTUSD close 6309
If this guy wins let me tell you.. we're going up

i almost thought there would be no dump on a sunday, but looks like the grind back down is on now.
My guess is there will soon be a drop, about 50-100 dollars, to be followed with a higher high than the one before.
I'm kind of a newbie, especially to shorting bitcoin.. Finally got onto bitmex last night and my entry was 6375. 20% unrealized gain but I don't want to keep watching it.  My limit buy is for 5950 & stop loss is at 6450. Used 25x... I think it'll drop based on just watching it for months, I think this is just a long downtrend.. Thoughts? I seen in the chat someone mentioning good news tomorrow, anyone know what that news is? 
Am I the only one who is thinking that we didn't break the February low? One day close down the February low can be ignored according to the books. What are your thoughts on this? Overall Volume slightly increasing (except today) and volume of dumps decreasing. However I don't like the low volume pump - doesn't feel like a bottom.. I guess wait and see is the right move for me since I am a beginner. What are your targets for an long/short?

In the not too distant future, the majority of this market will regret they refused to accept a triple bottom. They will look back and say 6k was so obvious, that all the signs were there. That they had 3 chances, nearly a week, to handle 6k Bitcoin with more care.

A lot of underwater shorts from sub 6k. Liquidation points coming soon. This "dump" is hardly noticeable. Bulls might have come to play this time.

Short this obvious DCB! Still a lot of money to be made going down.
Funny how the hardcore HODL early BTC guys I know on Facebook who spammed price tickers the previous year now have  been mysteriously silent for several months :) 

I wonder where I can obtain this black belt in hindsight returns they all seem to have

What about Q3? From what I remember, Q3 are way more bearish than Q2, but I could be wrong.

Why are you convinced that we will see see lower lows?  Isn't that a bit early to say?
All this over analysis, when the price will bart up if the few people in control of it want it too....or it will bart down if they choose that instead.  In between, it will just meander sideways on low organic volume.

> So we are only waiting for that cloud twist to confirm bullishness

Bullishness to possibly extend this DCB, yes.
I'm curious to see how this goes, but I think shorting a 200$ move during a possible reversal is quite dangerous.
Looks like we're starting a bart downwards right now, so good move unless this really is a bullish reversal and it bounces back V-shaped with good volume. Which feels like a big ask right now.
We are still within the typical 8-11 day interbart dump pattern. 
Look at the 30 min chart
Portrait mode charts are so goofy.  You cut off half of the valuable data in many cases.

And yes, the 1d chart does usually put things into perspective quite well.
That’s what I’ve been watching as well, and no, I don’t think $2k more down is unreasonable. We just went on a stupidly parabolic run from $1k to $20k in a few months, and this would likely signal a return to norm. If we can manage to settle down around $3k or $4k by the end of it all, that’s still incredibly bullish, considering it would still be 3x/4x in two years.
see you in 1 hour.
Absolutely agree.

Could it still go lower than our current low in 57xx? Sure. But people seem to forget that we have already retraced more than 70&#37; since our December ATH. Glorious shorting opportunities, in my mind, are already gone.

If you are not convinced this is the bottom yet, and are not in a short position already, why not wait on the sidelines for a better entry, which may or may not come? Surely, it's less risky than shorting around the time of a potential reversal.
agreed, but remember -- aside from those who got in at the very end (like, last 2-3 days) of the bull run, even the latecomers were well into the green before things turned south.
This doesn't seem to be backed up by data. We now have more longs open than we ever had in 2017.
People have been shorting at the year's low for several months now and it has worked out very well for them.  


Shorting breakdown of a 5 month consolidation is nothing like buying an ATH.
There, there... it's gonna be okay.
They haven't, I actually sent them a support ticket and they said they only have the quarterly for now, they will make an announcement if they decide to open another 6 month contract
Hindsight 20/20.
Don't forget to keep the eyes moist for the first week. 
Lol, better keep them out of the screen for a while. Your bitcoin will worth nothing if you ruin your health :)
Nice. Lasik was one of the best decisions I've made in my life. Most of my allergies went away cause I was using monthly contacts and I swear pollen sticks to it like crazy
no one is entitled to anything...

and really, people waiting for lower prices is literally just supply/demand :P 
Supply and demand man, can't wait to buy under 5k
Sadly for the holders it will go to 5k and even below. Im holding my shorts and adding on as we go further downwards
To celebrate Bitmex is closing all Quebec trader accounts.
Ahhh ya. Thanks it’s a good day today and I hope everyone else is doing well around the world !!
cheers from Vancouver!
Thanks! Great day to you too
>this is a suckers rally 
There are only so many times you can fall for the same shit without being called a monkey.. :(

What do you make of this bull flag?
That's what I was thinking. You have the majority thinking three to four thousand is going to happen. People are very pessimistic. The psychology is against the rally. A lot of people are not going to believe that it's real. It's actually the perfect time for one to happen especially if Deep Pockets want to load up. They will have less competition on the buying
Yea nothing says the price is "gradually creeping up" like making a fresh low for the year and then shooting up $300 in 15 minutes in a manipulated pump only to level off with no volume.  
I can see this being pumped up to $6800 or so with another two manipulated spikes up.   Of course can see them pumping it even higher, but will entire more shorting resistance, because we all know it is another bullsh*t pump and new lows will likely be tested in a few weeks.
I mean why would it be any different this time :P I get you, but why now and not before 
Yeah, a bear market can drain your emotion really bad. The main reason bitcoin makes huge downward drops, is because people start thinking "shit, shit, shit" and panic sell. One of the reasons why people recommend not to invest more than you're willing to lose, is to avoid that sentiment. If this bear market is draining your emotions, consider stepping away for a while and just hold. After all, the only people who held from sub-10$ bitcoin are the ones who forgot about it.
Tryin’ to take a goodnight BM right now. #shitpost
***** Roosters crowing

Good morning. It is a new day and new week.
What dump? In the past 4 hours we dropped $80, inside a bull flag: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/VcrktpUv/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/VcrktpUv/)

I wouldn't call that a "dump" :)

The support lines below us are 6300 (which we're flirting with now) and \~6170 which is bottom of the 4H cloud.
i think its because people realize that we might be in the middle of a reversal, so they stopped using stop losses as much to avoid getting stopped out before the next move up

you remove stop losses from the equation, and you don't have as many barts because you no longer have that cascading effect, where a 1% move down, triggers a 10% dump 
There have been some far weaker declines over the past few weeks.  
Target for the trade?
Bitcoin hasn't had a red November since 2011. November is also the month of the biggest bull runs it's ever had. Winter seems to be decent for bitcoin for whatever reason. Could just be statistical anomaly though. Then again, it's still 6 years in a row, with two of the Novembers being ridiculous gains 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/F5zouCoF/
Well, the saying is: sell in May and go away, but remember to come back in September. I don't believe in that sh*t, but statistics kind of do.
For Christmas products and snow removal companies, sure.
No, not really.  No indication that bear market will turn into bull market the 2nd half of the year.  Only thing is that price has already dropped 70%, so unlikely to drop another 70% from here.
People should stop reasoning like this. It became so popular, that now you might even do better counter trading the counter traders. 
I don't think that shorting has as big of an impact on the market as people seem to think.  Why?  Whenever Bitcoin dips, the alts dip, which wouldn't be a big deal until you look at how many of them don't have a way to short.

My thought is that there were a lot of people with little trading experience or skill who made a lot of money in a short period of time, and are OK with selling after a 50-75&#37;+ drop if it means preserving the profits that they still have.  I mean, if you bought a couple thousand Ether in January 2017, yeah it sucks to see how far things are from ATH, but if you sell at $420, you still made a pretty tidy profit, and have one less thing to worry about.

perpetual swaps have funding fees every 8 hours, could mean you get paid could mean you pay- during bearish markets usually shorts pay during bullish usually longs.

longs pay a default 0.01% every 8 hours

futures don't pay any funding but they often undergo price discovery on their own- they'll deviate from spot price anywhere from 1-10%, even more during craziness. last few months they're no more than 2-5% above/below price though. futures expire every ~3 months ( since a new contract is added every 3 months),  each contract lasts about 6 months. june just expired recently, sept will expire in 3 months, dec is about to be added and will expire in dec
Regular has no fees past the initial premium/discount.

Also read the books by him. Check out TradingView and read other people’s analysis. Learn to draw lines. Join forums. I recommend this subreddit’s Slack channel. Most of all just watch other trailers and Google what they say to learn here and there. Just by being around it you’ll eventually come to understand it well.

I'd say don't trade more than 5%, regularly pull out your profits. The best traders manage risk. 
Start with basic understanding of markets, then move on to candlesticks/volume and basic support and resistance charting, then advance by learning various indicators or chart patterns that interest you. When you actually start trading make sure you learn risk management (it's not too hard, but a lot of people ignore it). I found this resource to be really good for beginners (it's not just about day trading) and it's free: http://www.financial-spread-betting.com/trading/day-trading-course.html

Read and absorb "Technical Analysis of Stock Trends" by Edwards and Magee, and you'll have a better foundation than most people in this market
Research, look at charts, patterns and buying volumes.
It's already trading >$60 above spot. What an amazing short entry if you're bearish mid-term.
Difficult to give credit to a 3 point line over a 4 years period, but it still a great find.
Log sir, log
I don't know... to me this just strongly suggests 3k isn't far-fetched if 5k breaks. Then again, 12-13k volume could use some filling in.
How does this make you bullish? We are under the largest volume nodes which means we have a *ton* or resistance above us.
Is the right axis the resting order volume?
I wouldn't think that would possibly hold again but whales may still see it as a last line of defense 
Or not. 
[removed]
thats usually an indicator that the whales are ready to start a move up

the initial reversal always looks fake as fuck. I remember when ETH pumped during the bubble. You know how it started? Someone put up a giant buy wall at $300(like 5,000 BTC worth) and kept reloading it, and reloading it. I remember counting something like 30,000 BTC worth of buy walls between $300 and $330...then the thing just went went parabolic and a few months later the price was at $1,400

hidden buy walls are an indicator that someone wants to acquire coins without spooking the price up too quickly 
So we are at “Denial of a pump” phase.

Asset balloon cheat sheet accuracy is amazing.
Please share how you can determine organic growth from inorganic growth in this kind of market?

While its obviously manipulated, I think most of the manipulation is within the boundaries of "noise", long-term manipulation would be extremely high risk. Also consider that different people may be trying to manipulate the market in opposite directions.

I think a lot of the insane volatility and bizzare moves are a result of people with no prior experience trading on high leverage, not just manipulation.


At least we see an organic increase in bearish comments every time BTC drops 50$.
Organic and vegan 
Yes good point.  The price very rarely steadily rises.  It only trades sideways on low volume until the next manipulated pump or dump.  It is not even a real market at this point, or at least such a low volume one that very little genuine organic price action.
 I wouldn't be shocked if this **organic** crash below 5700
Yup.  I’ll eat mcafees schlong if we don’t dump to under 59 next day or two.
I am not sure of having the right to post this link. But it is to answer you..

Somebody's losing money.
Why?
He will win. I am voting for him right now. 
Lol no. 
Leave the market to its own devices and it is sagging under pressure for the most part.
Go back to r/bitcoinguessing.
Sell low, you got this
Unless you are 100% okay to lose all your margin, close your position before you get rekt.
That’s a lot of leverage for not understanding what you’re doing...
I'd advise not such a high leverage for newbies 
Fuck me 25x leverage :-D

I hope you have a lot of spare cash!

You realise that one big move could wipe you out, and big moves are relatively frequent. A better option is to reduce your leverage and grow into a position. E.g. 3x at one price with perhaps 20% of your stack, then add another 20% at 100-200 intervals. Then a stop loss on your position to cash you out in the event that the movement continues against you.

Cut your losses on your losing positions, and let
your winning positions run to offset your losses and build your profits.
Take profit broski.  20% is a good nights work (assuming you’re playing with a decent size stack).  

I’d at the very least leave enough room up to $6600-6700.  This thing could easily liquidate you any second instead of a 20% profit.  25x is gambling in most cases, upvote for having balls!  I agree it’s going down most likely but we could easily get a quick spike to $6450 before dumping.
If your a new guy I wouldn't touch Bitmex. 3x leverage is the safest for newbs (exchanges like Bitfinex offer this) .. Margin is a way to a quick death, let alone without having experience of how it feels to have a position go against you and what to do when it does 
As well as the barts, be wary of these kinds of moves. Especially when confident with high leverage

https://www.tradingview.com/x/fb4mUp7o/
We did break the February low, that is an objective fact and you can't just ignore price action because you feel like it, lol.
It can pump on low volume, at the beginning at least, because the public is always late, and at the moment the ask side is very thin after 2 months of non-stop bear. 

It's much more concerning when high (see retests of 11.7 and 10k on declining volume)
following your logic the ATH is not $19961, but somewhere around $17k. 
It seems like you’re selectively applying this rule here, as the lowest daily close in June was lower the lowest daily close in April, which was lower than the lowest daily close in February.

I’m not sure how you’re seeing higher lows even while selectively applying this rule to only one of the lows though, as the second lowest daily close in June was still lower than the lowest daily close in Feb ($6900).

u/the_OPs_mommy, we love you. Please come back :'(

I wouldn't say sloppy is "some idiot" who "started witch-hunting him" though. He just replied to the OPM's comment saying it looked fishy that OPM's post looked strikingly similar to your (long-winded) analyses of arson's extensive alts. People are generally disengaged with the issue and it's admittedly surprising that OPM would come out of the blue and write an extensive dialogue analyzing the display settings, post history, etc. of arson.

I wouldn't just start handing out accusations here, considering I was saying the same thing. I'm sure you'll start saying I'm sloppy here, but I'm starting to agree with people that you're getting a bit overly confrontational at this point.

lmao okay i guess 50% of people who PM me are Arson then. Sorry for falling for it yet again /u/gypsytoy...at this point it probably looks like I'm trying to help Arson but I swear I'm just really gullible

I don't know if you're right or not, but regardless of what direction the market goes from here, you certainly can't say that there wasn't enough time to make a decision.
You do know that the green candle to 6570 took out all 10x from the bottom shorters?
Most of those shorts closed on the pump from $6200 to $6500. We still have 10k more longs than shorts, so it seems we likely have more underwater longs than shorts at this point.
confirmation bias sees 23k shorts and ignores 33k longs
Yeah, those masses of bulls just pushing btc up the stairs relentlessly on buy volume that reflects the captivation of the masses. 
I give up! What is it?

WTF is calling manipulation all the time? ;)

A buy is a buy, and a sell is a sell. Manipulation or not, the market is what it is and it will stay that way. I still believe there's some value in looking at what's there on the charts.

And WTF, did you not read the end of my post where I said 6800-6900 is probably good risk/return for a short? ;)
I'm a scalper, so I'm just looking for volatility. But IMO that move was a bull trap, and so I think 6000 will be tested soon enough.
I took some profit at the .618 extension at 6267, and will also take profit at 6226. 

Looking to add more if we come back up to 6335-6355.
... why? The 4 hr/12 hr/daily are much more reliable signals.
Quite bullish imo, doesnt look like it will bart.
You get the idea man. It still paints a picture quite well.

Let’s see your version. How bout it?
The problem is practically everyone on YouTube and every Forum now expects that. Even if we did start the trend that way people would jump in front and buy early. 

Usually when I hear a universal opinion there is a very slim chance of it actually coming to pass
Hello
[removed]
As someone mentionned somewhere in the last week, it is easy to manipulate Bitfinex longs.

You put 6000$ in your margin wallet, you buy 6000$ worth of BTC (1 BTC), and you leave it there. You did not borrow any money, so you don't risk getting liquidated. However, this shows up as a long entry on the BTCUSDLONGS.

Furthermore, a lot of people are talking about shorting on Bitmex because they don't trust BFX.
I would interpret that as there is a higher percentage of people believing that Bitcoin has hit a bottom and the odds of us going up from here are a pretty safe bet. 
You do realize the years low is 6k and that probably did not end well for them
I don't feel sincerity. LOLOL

But still thank you, stranger!
That's so weird... 
Unlike my vision
If you're struggling, just zoom out to the 3D chart and imagine the money you'd have if you sold in December.

Until we get there and then you probably won't buy, and will start posting about 5k.
yes but i think risky bet, some news could come out that turns the market around
look forward to how this plays out.  I'm not buying here as I've successfully bought every pop, i will if it goes below 5k but i think its a risky move.  so many buyers are expecting it, there could be a surprise news story that flips the market.  
Are you serious?? Did this happen??

Of course it likely is, but doesn't mean that money can't be made on the long side if it is pumped higher for awhile, before the near inevitable lower lows in the not so distant future.
> People are very pessimistic.

Why do you call that "pessimism" to calculate that the price will more likely be lower.    That is nonsense.  Higher prices are not inherently good and lower prices aren't bad.  I

Because he is long this time
A confirmed double bottom is reliable.
My point is the fact that its only "$80" is a sign of how weak it is, if this played out at any point the last like 8 weeks we would have moved much further and on higher volume.
> people realize that we might be in the middle of a reversal   
   
That's the main thing that makes me bearish.
Are you serious? Removing stop losses is something you never do. ~~This place is full of noobs... People have childish  'theories' to explain the market.~~(EDIT removing potentially offensive wording) Sorry if that makes you offended, but someone needs to tell you.


If it's a winner, let it ride. 
so in order for that to continue it'll need to be back at ATH before year end?
It's a coincidence.
Is this actually true? And is there any reasoning behind this saying?
don't forget pumpkin futures.  "They've been going up the whole month of October!"
There are a few golden rules in trading that everyone learn when they step in the game: 

- Buy low, sell high.
- Buy when there is blood in the streets.
- Sell when there is euphoria.

But for some reason, these rules fly out the window when they are at a point of most relevance.
While I agree, this is still a very immature market. I use twitter as a barometer and now it seems that everybody wants to short. People that kept calling bottoms are now shorting or asking questions as to how to short. Sort of the reverse of what we saw during the parabola in Dec. 
I do think the noob bottom shorters have been the biggest prevention of capitulation wicks. Smart shorting of bounces should continue working and is still something most people new to margin don't have the stones to do.
Well, the markets are not only math, the math is the projection of these things.
Youve been saying exactly this from thousands of dollars higher. You are the noise, not the signal. You harm anyone that believes you.
Well where do we find out about these upcoming OTC shorts.

>It's already trading >$60 above spot. What an amazing short entry if you're bearish mid-term.

Oh, & I still have most of my $ in Gemini so this is just to get a feel for it..
But we only closed 1 day below it and there would  the 1 day rule apply right ? And we had some strong sell off below 6k but we closed mostly above it (except 1 time)
This isnt that unreasonable.
> I'm sure you'll start saying I'm sloppy here

What? No. I definitely don't think you or sloppy are running socks. This is exactly the kind of baseless accusations I'm talking about. *Why* would you think I would accuse either of you? Have I made those allegations before? No. I have no reason to believe that and no suspicion. Why are you acting like I'm accusing people (really it's exclusively arson I've accused) without very clear evidence? 

This is 100% the result of Sloppy throwing out ridiculous accusations and then refusing to engage over the evidence and lack of evidence. He make a bunch of ridiculous accusations and then backed out when pressed on it.

OPM was one of the original arson critics and provided me with several additional faked MEX screenshots months ago. I have corresponded him in great deal privately in regards to arson's various socks and we have exchanged info and analysis of the problem. Most recently, I messaged him [this](https://imgur.com/a/OpyohdM) with regard to this cryptosecrecy guy. He looked into it independently and arrived at the same conclusion and then took it on himself to engage with the arson alt.  

He is not me and I am not him. He is smart and I am dumb. I'm flattered, but really that's so ridiculous. 

This is Sloppy's doing. He flip flops sides constantly and cannot seem to look at objective info with an objective eye. He's claiming that I'm making him paranoid, but why? Firstly, you all *should* be paranoid about this problem, but all I'm doing is citing actual evidence. What exactly is the evidence that connects me and OPM? Besides the long-winded-ness, what else is the same? Do we have the same mannerisms? Not from what I can tell.

The OP was outing themselves in an odd way. it’s a personality disorder thingy...Scary in iRL to be on the other side.
Oh shit! Guys, run!
I'm starting to think arsonbunny, gypsytoy and all these alt accounts are the same person. It's just gotten ridiculous at this point and gypsytoy is so psychotic I wouldn't put it past him to do this sort of thing for constant attention. 

I mean who actually is this insane to always do this research and find these "alt accounts"anyway? It's a pathetic waste of time to care this much. 
Does anyone feel like doing a brief summary on today's episode?
Same exact scenario here
There isn't enough time to make a decision. It takes time to get a mortgage or credit card 
Of course, but there is a substantial argument to be made that a bounce upward has been coming for awhile, and a lot of bears that seem to want to short every bounce.  
That may be very true, but at this point I'd be more worrisome to be shorting than longing. This short-term downtrend from the rejection of 10k to 5.6 was experienced without a substantial bounce of any kind, with a solid amount of qualitative bullish news coming out. At some point the bears who short every bounce will get burned. 
Many are looking for a push >6800 and the lack of a substantial drop thus far screams bullish. The movement from 10k-5.6k was experienced without any real bounce. At some point shorters will want to ride the wave up as well. 
Well he's just pointing out a pattern...it's not *that* bad compared to some other stuff here
* I put the arrows so even people like you could comprehend it.
* It looks pretty much the same on Bitfinex and all the other exchanges.   
* Investing.com has more crypto pairs than TV and the charts are exactly the same.

Good point, but sometimes it gets to the point of mental masturbation.  Although nothing wrong with wanking it, and I suppose it's just a way to pass the time for entertainment.   
And then traded almost perfectly sideways on low volume afterwards...and before.  And has been doing that for weeks now, for the most part.
> WTF is calling manipulation all the time? ;)

WTF is calling 2+2=4 all the time?

> And WTF, did you not read the end of my post where I said 6800-6900 is probably good risk/return for a short? ;)

I missed that, and can't really disagree with that analysis and I was looking at the same thing on the chart myself.  
Scalper here as well. I opened a small short on futures at $6370 yesterday. The way I see it, its possible this could re-test $6800, with a small possibility of hitting $7500 before going back down. I’ll add to my short on the way up to $6800 if it hits that.

My target is around $6150. However, this looks very similar to the price action when it topped out at $7800 and $6800, with the possibility of breaking down to the next long-term support level around $5300, which is also where the log trendline from ATH currently sits. This seems like good r/r for a short scalp with the option to ride it down further.
Yh ikno what you are saying, but since its not following pattern, subtle changes are far more important.
And what information or observations make you think this?
Ok you two, now kiss.
I don’t track crypto traders on youtube or twitter. That’s concerning that people are already jumping on this train, as I eyed this target as soon as we broke down from $7k this month. I agree it’s unlikely it will play out this way if everyone expects it. But frankly, this seems like the last stand for bulls except for a re-test of previous ATH resistance around $1.2k, which is still super bearish for me. I’ll prob start scaling into a long below $5.3k if that support breaks rather than trying to catch the absolute bottom. However, I agree this could play out super unpredictability if these major trendlines aren’t respected.

Well as long as you understand you're ignoring the data...

bitmex futures has a *premium* now...it was -$150 a week ago
Very few people get liquidated on bfx, because the leverage is small. in most of the cases it hits their stop losses. So the manipulators are hunting for stop losses, not liquidations, on bfx. If you are buying BTC and leave it on the exchange, it means you have (or you should have) a profit/loss exit strategy. If you don't have such a plan (you are a hodler) it would be stupid to keep your BTC on the exchange, due to counterparty risk.
The years low is not 6k.  You are living in a fantasy world that doesn't interest me.

Again, people have been shorting at the year's low (at the time) for several months and worked out well for them.  The current 7 month low of about $5750 will likely be the same.

Not really. They never used to have anything other than perps and quarterly. They did the 6 month contract just twice I think, maybe as a test. 
December futures just opened
before or after Lasik?

I’m in disbelief. 
Pessimism about the price isn't a moral stance, just a belief it will go down. 
Pay attention to the sentiment. Falling prices attract a lot of negative comments. A lot of doubt. A lot of fear. 

The psychological angle to crypto trading is massive
It's certainly possible.  They can just create a few hundred million $ worth of tether and pump it to that level fairly easily. And of course the permabulls will FOMO in and help them with their project.

But they artificially pumped BTC to $20K last year, so $9K from here is not a big stretch.
Nah, I am bullish because of these factors not the other way around. 
How do you measure the target of the double bottom here? Isn't it only a $400 target anyway?
The last two dumps at $7800 and $6800 started out with a big short squeeze, followed by a bull flag that slowly started trending down before it eventually fell off a cliff and formed a lower low. I’m not necessarily saying it will play out that way, but I wouldn’t start teasing bears quite yet until it gets back above $6400.
Ok, I see what you mean now. I got mislead by the word "dump"
look at the chart, we broke through a pretty important downward line 
well I've done it, and I'd say I've probably been at this a bit longer than you. 

there is a time to scalp and a time to hold, and in this price range, with 2 months of no rallies, I find its safer to hold. 

scalping is how you end up selling your BTC at $1,100 and then sit on the sidelines seeing the price go up to $20,000 while you wait for the price to come back down 



Lol...So you think you know the strategies of each and every trader in the market? 

Sorry to break it to you, but you're the noob.
No, not at all, where'd you get that from?

Just saying that the price bitcoin enters November has been lower than the price it exits November for 6 years in a row. (2012 - 2017)
Possibly! Still interesting to see nonetheless. I would think it was a coinicdence if November 2013/2017 hadn't been explosive months. 
Holy shit can you imagine if that was a thing/trend that somehow nobody caught onto?! A man can dream...

You mean like this: https://invst.ly/7w8rq
We also had a bullish engulfing on May 28th and June 13th. It’s pretty consistent at predicting rallies, but not necessarily reversals.
For the lazy / uninformed: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearishengulfingp.asp
But not on Thursdays. 
I'm not following. Why would political uncertainty suddenly make Mexicans believe Bitcoin is better than their native currency? 
That is definitely not enough breathing room. It hit $6570 on the way up. Any leg up from here and you’ve hit your stop loss and/or been liquidated. With 25x, you can be right about the direction and still lose money. If it’s gambling money, that’s fine, but just make sure you’re comfortable with a greater likelihood of losing your entire entry than winning any sizeable profits. I would never go >10x unless you are comfortable with Bitmex, there is significant support/resistance on your side, and the trade has already gone significantly in your favor.
You're playing against a rigged casino operator who uses fraud to liquidate leveraged positions.  The price can at any time jump up $500 for no reason what so ever and take all your money before promptly crashing back down.  Good luck and have fun.
25x leverage is straight up gambling. 
my recommendation is to move 80% of it to cold storage and play with 20% 
Also, if you are just looking to get a feel for bitmex, I’d suggest trying out their testnet. It allows you to trade with fake money so you can get comfortable with using the sliders, setting orders, closing positions, etc. it seems like it should be simple, but I’ve accidentally changed my leverage with the slider a few times, and you don’t want things like that to happen when using real money.

Also, those wicks can kill you. Whales intentionally liquidated overleveraged traders to increase liquidity. You want to be comfortably outside of range or you could easily get hit by a wick from one of these famed barts.
The one day rule is like the 5 second rule
Guys it's a little silly to think this way, don't you think? :P 

What's next, we're going to pull a parabolic trav and remove a month from the charts and pretend like we're just going up slowly? Haha

The top of blow-off tops are absolutely critical and significant, you cannot ignore them. There's a reason it took like 3 tries to get past $1150 in 2017. 
1 step further, the 1-month rule puts the ATH at 14k. That's unreasonable
Tbh, i noticed how fast Sloppy regains upvotes when someone uses a downvote bot on him. Someone is probably using a downvote bot on him recently but the dude most likely uses sock accounts to upvote himself as well.

Every comment he made had like -8 votes to -12 votes a minute or so it came out. Then it regains itself pretty quickly in a pretty sketchy  manner within a few minutes as well. This happened consecutively btw so it isnt just some random occurrence.

What is clear though is that person downvoting Sloppy uses a more automated system while Sloppy probably just created multiple sock accounts.

TLDR: My guess is someone is using downvote bots on sloppy then the dude logs in and logs out of his sock accounts and upvotes himself manually. Too much drama on both sides lol
That was more in reference to you accusing innocent users of being arson alts without sufficient evidence.

I honestly would be surprised if you and OPM were the same person, and it's nice you are both working on this. But I was not aware OPM was ever an arson critic, so it's just surprising for me at least for him to come out like this when it seems like it's you vs. the sub on this arson drama if I'm being honest (lol).

I think this is more an indication of certain users having too much clout in this sub (sorry to the likes of chewy, sloppy, mikexbt, etc), as a random accusation from a single user really shouldn't have enough impact to force a long-term contributor who provides meaningful, thoughtful analyses and is well-liked within the community to quit.

I'm gonna be real- I'm having the same thoughts. No one cares except these three* (idk how many there are at this point)...like who cares *this* much? Half the reason I keep getting the details wrong/believing the next person to tell me that the last person was lying is because...I don't give a shit. I'm just like "okay, that's weird. moving on"

but these guys are all up each other's asses writing novels, inspecting tools they use and shit. Like good lord!!

at this point I'm wondering if they're the same person. They have a similar writing style and sense of humor. tend to have long-winded jokes that require lots of effort and creativity- including *Italicized Movie Names* and *Novel Titles* 

Gypsy also apparently went to college and he's clearly a smart guy, so maybe he went to college for math/finance and is secretly a big quant guy.

also, gypsy and OPs_mommy both got rekt shorting $7.3k when it bounced to $9.2k back in late March. 

Idfk. All I know is it's absolutely insane to care this much.

if OPs_mommy isn't gypsy, that sucks and I'm sorry for even writing this. but no one should care this much. it's really weird 

I'm sort of even scared to write this in fear of getting hounded over it! But this sub is turning into "No puppet, you're the puppet!" lol
Now we have more time to read useless shit on Reddit! Yey
mhhhh well. thats just a case of not being prepared. i always have some avenues of liquidity ready.
Just keep a few cards open. They'll send you 0% APR offers frequently enough. 
Normally I would tend to agree with you, but one of my primary indicators since these barts started appearing in February has been the short/long ratio. What is scary about the decline from $10k to here compared to the past two cycles is that bears are closing on every dump, and bulls are buying every dip. I think that massive BGD made bears a lot smarter this cycle, as there simply isn’t much pain to be had for bears since many have already realized their profits, compared to bulls who are mostly underwater and hoping for a reversal.
Many are looking for a dump < 6000 and the lack of substantial price increase between bart intervals screams bearish. The movement from 10 down without any real bounce reflected the lack of buying pressure, and dwindling speculative appeal. 

But yes, at some point it will turn around, and people will want to ride the wave up as well (myself included).

Good luck, don't look at anything other than Bitmex when open, and watch out for wicks.
They were really happy they were making a bunch of money , now they are not. There's no irony there it's completely normal 
It's not an irony we've had to deal with smartasses and buttcoiners for years since bitcoin was $200 after the 2013 crash so when bitcoin made us rich in the end it's a reasonable emotion to make some posts, even if they held all (which I doubt since most of us have cashed out at least some to buy a house travel or whatever) so even if they cash out now they've had more ROI in 5 years than many can dream.
Mods have no tools to verify claims. We can report to admins and that's about it. I'll talk with the other mods about what more we can do. It seems like we need to make some adjustments but I can't say what that will be yet.

I did perma ban a couple of ban evading accounts this week. I wouldn't be surprised if the uptick in Dischord  related brigading is related.

Most likely bots

Could be arbitrage bots trying to keep the prices inline with other exchanges. 
I noticed this too. Only been happening for a day or so. I was unaware that bots set limit orders cause I've only ever seen them market buy/sell

RIP in peace. 
Started from the bottom now we here.

Seriously though, you could have bought $1000 worth of bitcoin at $1 in 2011 and re-sold at $20k in 2018 for a total profit of $20mil in only 7 years.

(Edit: Another fun fact: if you had bought $1 worth of bitcoin at $0.00076 in 2009, you would have roughly 1,315.79 bitcoin. If you had sold that at $20k, you would have made $26mil in about 8 years.)
FYI, Bitfinex app uses TV charts and works on android
Im a noob, but ive been studing bitcoin chart patterns, especially barts last months and the latest ones does not follow the last 2 hour pattern til it drops.
I'm with you on all that. So far we have not broken major support but if that happens it's very unpredictable where support would be. I also would be scaling in. I think that's what gets people going is they look at that and there is obvious support at 1.2 and above that you have a few channels that you can point out but it's really tough to tell what the market would do with it all. Too many unknown variables at this point to even consider.

Try it. You will understand.

You are not borrowing money. So you don't pay interest
I'm ignoring BFX long data. But thanks for brining the bitmex futures premium
I think you don't understand the concept of the years low. 
Thanks for the heads up! Just when I go take a nap, they open the Dec Futures. Figures XD
Little A little B.

I had PRK so my vision actually got worse before it got better. 
It will be bigger next time mate :) 
I trust you enjoyed a safe and happy Canada Day!

Now it's back to this sub! :/
I sure didn't learn much there :P
I didn't suggest it was a moral stance.  If someone has a short position, it is not pessimistic to think the price is likely to go down and they will make big profits.  That is called "optimistic".
Sentiment in the sub means little as to the price direction, when only a few people really significantly control/affect the price at this point.
Not sure why you keep getting downvoted. Can only laugh at the mentality of some of the kids who frequent this sub - wearing their emotions on their sleeves & showing it with their votes. 
Bullish as in you think we’ve found the bottom and are going to ATHs? Or bullish as in short term bounce before going lower again? If short term, what’s your target to sell?
I am on mobile, used fib instead of multiple boxes. 6875 is the target, which is also previous resistance. Secondly, we did break a downward trend line on a double bottom.

No, we got rejected from it immediately

and again, not saying this will be the big reversal. Just saying we'll probably go up to test $8,500 and if we beat through that, $10,000, and if we break through that $15,000 
I don't know how long you've been into this. And no offence but it's irrelevant to me. If you are suggesting that my reddit account age is an indication then think again. And sorry but I will insist, no stop losses is a noob thing to do. Wider stops are a different issue altogether.  


EDIT I'm considering to delete my comments, people seem a bit offended.
Removing stop losses is not a strategy any serious trader would do. Widening the stops because of perceived volatility is another thing. And I'm a professional trader.
understood, sorry misunderstood the red November statement.
-cheers for explaining that.
I wouldn't mind being proven wrong here tbh.
people have been saying this stuff since like $11k lol it has no effect. if anything it's probably helped the downtrend. 
>How do you manage to make $1MM+ trades on Mex? they usually have some kind of limit.

Use the slider bar to increase your limit when the warning box pops up. I haven't experienced any limits placing orders up to $18mm on Mex. 
That's not the correct interpretation of volume profile. The tippy tip of anything's all time high is always going to have little volume, it doesn't mean the price will return there. Same with the bottom range.

The correct way to view it is that LVNs - and not spots on the ends - are places the price will tend to jump through or get rejected from quickly. HVNs can serve as a sticking point of price - a lot of volume is there indicating it's a common trading range. Sometimes a HVN can be resistance once fallen out of or support once passed as well.
I think Keats was referring to the bullish engulfing on the daily.
not average mexicans... mexican investors will hedge due uncertainty about the future of the country
Alright- this is directed to everyone who commented. Since I'm already in the green, I'll move my stop loss a lot closer to my entry and let it ride. I'll do the math and put it in at 10% gain & lower my leverage after the trade closes.  Thanks every1.
no it's not. leverage just determines liquidation- it's a hard stop loss. if he's 25xing his net worth, yes that's gambling. if he's 25xing for a small-ish trade then there's nothing wrong with that....you can also add to your position if the trend goes your way.

i went from 10x short to 53x short on the way down from $11.7k to $6k in February. never even came close to liquidation
What is 100x then ?
I respectfully disagree: the testnet doesn't allow you to deal with the managing of emotions that is so critical to a trader's success.   There's no skin in the game.
Remember the first brush with 10k? Yikes. 
> Every comment he made had like -8 votes to -12 votes a minute or so it came out. Then it regains itself pretty quickly in a pretty sketchy manner within a few minutes as well.

Oh come on.

Sloppy is a popular poster, and he gets lots of upvotes simply because of that.

It's one thing if 30 seconds after a post, it's at +/- 10, it's another if it gets that "within a few minutes"
> Someone is probably using a downvote bot on him during the recent pump from $5800 but the dude most likely uses sock accounts to upvote himself as well.

I have also noticed that (and noticed the opposite with me - I'm upvoted initially and then a few negative comments start bashing me and all of the sudden I'm at -10). I don't think Sloppy is doing that though. I think he is acting honestly, he's just seriously misguided about right and wrong with regard to a lot of things, including arguing to DK to be un-banned. Guy has his priorities and ethics a little backwards, but I **definitely don't** think he is using alts and don't want *those* rumors to start spreading. Unless, of course, there were stronger evidence to suggest that, but as far as I can tell, there isn't and no good reason to think that.

>Every comment he made had like -8 votes to -12 votes a minute or so it came out. Then it regains itself pretty quickly in a pretty sketchy manner within a few minutes as well. This happened consecutively btw so it isnt just some random occurrence.
 

Yeah it's weird, but based on his (I think genuine) personality, I don't think so.

>TLDR: My guess is someone is using downvote bots on sloppy then the dude logs in and logs out of his sock accounts and upvotes himself manually. Too much drama on both sides lol

Again, I strongly disagree, and I hope /u/sloppysynapses knows that I think there is a 0.00001% chance that this is true, but I can definitely see why you might think that. Votes (and comments) are so fucked up here and that's sort of my whole point.

Yes, OP was on the case months ago when I was wrongfully banned and arson got off scott free. 

I agree about the point on clout. 

Which innocent users did I accuse? I was very careful not to do that. There were a few accounts 2 weeks ago when this all started going down again that I said were suspicious (because they were defending arson for no reason) but I don't think I outright accused anyone that I shouldn't have. This goes for /u/cryptosecrecy too. 110% Arson.

I would happily retract any accusations that were made unfairly and have offered to do so on many occasions. Unfortunately I've been proven right time and time again, so there isn't much apologizing to do.

Exactly!! It's pretty insane, and judging by gypsytoys instability it wouldn't surprise me at all if he had schizophrenia and a few alter egos. I mean the dude stalked me just the other day digging DEEP into my comment history about completely unrelated things, constantly verbally assaulting me, and stalking me into other subs after we were just having a disagreement about bitcoin. I think the dude needs some professional help.

Making paper profits in not making money
Yep, whatever is going on with the votes in particular has shifting notably within the past few days, at least from what I can tell.

I understand that mods lack the tools to investigate the accounts themselves, which is why this whole situation is so frustrating. Can't we just have a sub where almost everyone is a good faith individual. *Then* I can shut up about this whole mess.
For sure. Still seems weird,  not sure what whoever's running them is trying to accomplish.

> Seriously though, you could have bought $1000 worth of bitcoin at $1 in 2011 and re-sold at $20k in 2018 for a total profit of $20mil in only 7 years.

Thanks for reminding me!!!

When I caught onto Bitcoin it was actually trading at around $0.70 on some weird exchange called "Mt. Gox" in Japan...

I contacted them and asked how to deposit funds... they said they only took wire transfers.

So I called my bank and asked them how much it would cost me to send $100 to Japan and they said $50.

I said "$50? Are you fucking kidding me? To send $100? That's ridiculous!" and I hung up the phone angry...

Worst split decision I have probably ever made.

I decided to spend $10,000 on mining equipment instead... I am not a smart man.
Yeah I use that but no 2 and 4H, a bit annoying
Huh

> You are not borrowing money. So you don't pay interest

This just blew my mind. I didn't know you could do this.
np, I agree that bfx longs are kind of negligible until they start getting above 35k, until then they dont mean a whole lot lately.

In general shorts/longs are not nearly as important as people think. the BGD happened in april and everyone thought they were super important after that but that was a once in a lifetime kinda short squeeze. Literally, that 1hr candle was historic. highest 1hr volume in all of btc history
You think a lot of goofy things.  The conversation above makes that clear.
Next time:

#:'(
Zug zug
You're being pedantic. 
The downvotes are a reflection of their panic and desperation..and extreme levels of denial.
All short term, chart above
That's pretty reasonable- I can see $6800-6900 pretty easily. Is that your target? You gonna flip back to short there?
He probably means a line you'd draw from the top which, to be fair, has more contact points than yours, but we've broken through lines like that in the past without much consequences. I'm just looking at EMA21 that we've been consistently bouncing off of all the way down from $10k.
Sounds like you’re hopeful this will be the big reversal to me. Breaking through $8.5k would be incredibly bullish, and if we break through $10k, that would likely signal the big reversal.
if we break $10k, $12k is the next big test.
No problem mate
it'll be interesting to see, that's for sure. I'm of course inclined to believe it was mainly coincidence as well but it's just been such a strong month I wonder if there's factors in play that occur during November. Not sure 
Nice. 

And what’s your opinion on bitcoin sites that let you invest in the stock market and give you % returns based on the stock performance? 

I mean I’m pretty surprised that they didn’t go out of business when bitcoin went from 1k to 18k. 
Thanks. I was looking for the timeframe. The bullish engulfing candle was on the 28th, yes? There's also one on the 3d, though not as textbook as the daily.
Lol are you even serious? What idiot would buy bitcoin instead of USD or gold to hedge against political uncertainity? " I better buy something that lost 70% of its value under 6 months to hedge against a possible 10% loss."
Yeah because obviously the future of bitcoin looks extremely bright at the moment. What people come up with... What's next, toilet paper shortage in Bolivia is good for bitcoin?
lol sorry, we’re just trying to help. Pretty much everyone here who has used bitmex has had a position liquidated at some point, and you don’t learn to be careful until you’ve already been liquidated a few times.

Just a suggestion, you could also take partial profits on your position and use those funds to decrease the leverage on your position. Just type in how many contracts you want to buy back in the “place order” box, then click the current margin on your position to add margin to your position. 
> I'll move my stop loss a lot closer to my entry and let it ride.

Soon after getting wicked out and closing at a loss when your stop market closes the end of the wick.
So, rekt then? Hope you actually did what you said :).
Sure, but you started out at 10x and increased it as the trade went your way, and you were comfortably out of liquidation range. I doubt you would have opened up the same short at 53x leverage.

Gambling is gambling though, regardless of the balance. It’s fun to do occasionally with small amounts, but you’ve gotta be comfortable with significant odds of losing it all.
A charitable donation to Bitmex.
Oh for sure, that’s definitely a huge component (which is why I recommended not leverage shorting at 25x short on his first trade). I was just saying it might be good to try out since he’s never even margin traded before, much less used bitmex.

Many people who use bitmex for the first time struggle with order types, funding fees, adjusting margins, etc., and you don’t wanna be figuring out these tools with a high leverage position.
Yes! That was very shortly after I had entered the space...I freaked out and panic sold the bottom, bought the top...lost all gains I made from entering at $8.2k lol.

You know what scared me the most? the comment that got me to panic sell?

"$11.5k is 10x $1150" :/
If its organic it probably shouldnt regain votes in a linear matter. Especially if its a controversial one. Its the most linear upvote gain ive ever seen. Like i said im only judging this based on my experience running sock accounts for my clickbait sites a few years ago. Its very similar lol.

I dont really care if people start downvoting or upvoting themselves with a sock army lol. I'll probably stop browsing reddit again once ive completely re-entered bitcoin. Waiting for a clear bottom reversal is boring the fuck out of me.
Im not saying sloppy is doing it but clearly the way he regained upvotes after getting hammered by a downvote bot isnt organic too. The upvote gain is eerily similar to how i upvoted my posts using sock accoutns when i was running clickbait sites a year or so ago for financial gain and were spamming them in reddit.

\>personality

You'll be surprised how often avid redditors love karma. there is something painful about getting downvoted to hell. Just check the dude's karma count, its 89,060 Karma. Again, im not saying what sloppy did was wrong if he did it in fact the downvoter probably started the whole thing.
I don't recall sloppy outright accusing OPM of being gyspy either. As far as I remember, I think he just said he was suspicious of OPM.

I think people are mostly just exhausted of this drama. If u/jarederaj sees sufficient evidence against arson and any potential alts, it is in his power to issue bans. I realize he has recently been trying to be a bit less strict in his moderating lately, but I assume vote manipulation and running multiple alts to push arson's agenda is grounds enough for a ban. Most of us (I assume) realize that arson runs multiple alts, as there is plenty of strong evidence supporting this assertion. I appreciate you bringing this issue to light. We just don't necessarily care to see every shred of evidence, when this could just as easily be sent to the mod team to handle.
[removed]
Hmm, sorry you feel that way. I was simply pointing to the fact that you were, for some reason, defending a known scammer. Why? I don't know, I can't imagine why someone would do that  when the evidence is so clear. Beyond that, I've made digs at you because you're a *very* ignorant ETH shill that doesn't understand basic economic principles or what economic rent is... but that's a whole other issue. 

Sorry you don't care about frauds manipulating the sub. I care though. 

:/
well if you're not gypsy then I'm sorry but like I said, if gypsy wants to make everyone paranoid, eventually people are going to get paranoid of *him*. At this point I have no idea who's who, all I know is you two are the only people that put so much effort into tracking arson

this whole thing is just weird. No one should care this much o_O 

I'm a little unsettled tbh and I kind of just want to bow out gracefully and avoid talking about any of this for the rest of ever.

if you *were* gypsy it'd be some next level psychotic duplicitous shit, but gypsy seems to have quite a bit of time and he's a smart guy, so who knows. All I know is I'm paranoid and deeply unsettled by this whole thing (the downvote bot as well? Wtf) and now realize crypto subs are frequently manipulated 
[removed]
lmao ok , how do you even know they didn't sell, and if you said they are early adopters they are still in an insane profit , they will always be in profit like it or not. 
Bitcoin is my money and I haven't sold any more than I need to keep the lights on. Do I like the exchange rate going down? No I don't. Can I live with it between halvings? Absolutely I can.
The observations you are making are a natural part of an open community on the internet; brigades form; drama develops; bullies recruite spineless minions... nothing about this is new or controllable.

It's a valid PSA to remind people that they can't trust what they're reading; it's not universally known that people contributing here may not be real or well intentioned. That Dischord group is a sad collection of people who want to control the sentiment in this sub, for example. Who knows how many groups exist like this. It's relevant to remind people of that in discussion. It's on topic to point out patterns of behavior in a post. 

Pointing at this stuff over and over runs the risk of exhausting people with it. I think you should consider the possibility that the approach you are taking is not fully having the desired impact.
Why do you care even if people are manipulating votes on an internet forum?

Far more important things to be concerned with in life. 
My guess: make money.
Looks like they are staggered upwards, so prob to drive the price? Dunno tho, am nub.

$50 is a lot. I spent about $20 to send $10,000 to Gox. Got my coins off as soon as I have bought.
I think that the investing.com Android app uses Trading with charts, but you would have to put up with some obnoxious ads. :/
It would increase the ETHUSDLONGS....

Do you even trade on BFX?
It works exactly as kingvw explains. You can wash lend to yourself. People do it for precisely the reason you mentioned - to signal to the market what you're doing. Not everyone takes longs being high (and out numbering shorts) to be an indicator to short. You don't need to fool everyone, just some. 
I would be surprised if we see a squeeze that large again. However, the long/short ratio is still helpful to watch for potential squeezes. It helped me buy the bottom before both short squeezes at $5800. It typically signals when longs/shorts are overextended, and people are buying/selling into larger players’ hands who will turn around and f them up.

I wouldn’t trade this as a sole indicator, but it does help me a great deal as a scalper, and I think it’s a good indicator for longer-term traders to exit a position that is getting a bit overextended. I’m sure once enough people start tracking this, it’ll stop working, but it’s worked like clockwork for me all year.

Regardless of the potential risks, selling euphoria and buying panic is a better indicator than rsi, macd, or any other TA I’ve found so far.
Highest 1hr volume as measured in USD though right? I thought we've see higher volumes when measured in BTC transacted. 
hahha, next time we will be making that face with 70x our current networth :) 
I am using the English language correctly.   The conversation speaks for itself.   
$6.8-7.0K seems so obvious and targeted by lots of ppl so it probably aint gonna happen :)

EMA14 & EMA21 seem to be good curves of resistance
don't think ppl realize how strong $7.8k resistance is- we likely will not make it past there if we manage to get past $7k
I don't really expect it to break $8,500...I'm just saying there is a chance of that. If it gets rejected before $8,500 it just means there'll be at least one more round of price dumping 
Currencies can lose much more than 10% of their value very fast. People in the US/Canada/EU have never had to worry about it but that's not the case everywhere.
I bought a portion of my Bitcoin when the Canadian dollar was pretty much par with the US Dollar. When that changed and the Canadian dollar lost 25%-30% almost overnight I was protected. 
Yes, yes it is.
see?
yes that's true im just being annoyingly technical/pedantic. a 4% stop loss is not exactly "gambling" it's just a relatively tight stop. It's not even that tight tbh, 4% is pretty big for most people here (that's about my normal stop loss when I enter, though)
Except Bitmex gets nothing.
so you admit to past usage of vote manipulation, understanding it and utilizing it to your advantage and have been watching me for the past few days? and I'm the suspicious one?

the downvote bot can rescind its upvotes to make it look sketchy. I posted to an 18 day old daily thread the other day to see if it downvoted me and within 3 minutes I got 5 upvotes. on an empty, dead thread...

It's just trying to confuse you.. or its probably your bot, since no one has any clue who you are whereas I've been posting here for 9 months. Tons of my comments are negative or at +1. I give 0 shits about karma

but this is a bunch of nonsense drama. mods need to purge this thread and any mention of it from here on out

I can't blame you for being paranoid/sus because the upvotes I got *were* very fast. but if you have looked at any of my comments over the past 9 months you know my whole goal is being genuine and helpful...karma doesn't help me in any way

Keep in mind there are people intentionally up voting  to counter the downvote bot and have said so explicitly. 
Yeah but he's been on reddit for 5 years. 89K karma over that period isn't all that hard to believe. 

It is weird how the votes swing so quickly and decisively in different directions, but it happens with others too. I don't think he's adding more votes to the mix, it's someone else. 

Also, like I said, lots of my comments (especially those critical of this issue) go from modestly positive to extremely negative very quickly. 
Firstly, thank you for thanking me. For the most part, it's an incredibly thankless task from day 1 and I've suffered a great deal of harassment and slander as a result (and I was unfairly banned for a month). It's nice to know that some people are at least thankful of me bring it to initial attention, even if they're not so keen on the continued reprisal.

The issue with mods, and /u/jarederaj himself has pointed this out on several occasions, is that they don't have any additional tools to handle this. They can and have spoken with the Admins but Arson has apparently evaded login/IP analylsis or whatever other tools they have at their disposal. What are mods to do to stave this off? Not much they can do. Instead, people (mostly me) have to remain vigilante and point it out when it's obvious. It's a game of whack-a-mole. Ignoring does help. Falsely accusing people creates it's own problem. It's a balancing act and certainly plenty of his alts have gone **un**detected and he can always create or buy more. That's why *awareness* is important and why I don't just message mods privately about it. People should be aware that this is going on (probably a lot worse than most people think) so they can remain on their toes. 

Arson is permabanned here, btw. Though several of his alts have apparently slipped through the cracks.
My hope is that everyone will send reports to the mod team and leave this stuff out of the daily. I disagree with methods I'm seeing used to make reports, but I don't ignore the report because I disagree with how I get it. Makes sense? I can't punish someone who is a victim of bullying just because it's possible to interpret the action of their report as rule breaking.

The nature of this bullying is to isolate and discredit GypsyToy, or anyone else who points at it. To resolve this quickly, the sub just needs to show that they hear GypsyToy.
[removed]
I feel like when we finally get to the bottom of this, every user on r/bitcoinmarkets and r/cryptocurrency will be revealed to be one of two people, either r/gypsytoy or r/arsonbunny, and our job will be to figure out who owns each account. The more accounts that are linked to these two users, the more confusing this drama gets.

I agree with sloppy. You may not be gypsy, but I’ve never seen someone so dedicated to the issue that they would spend hours on an investigative comment, only to get downvoted because most people don’t really care enough to read an essay about how some user has multiple accounts.

I realize vote brigading is an issue, and that many people in the cryptocurrency sphere are pretty easily manipulated. However, I believe it comes with the territory. You really can’t take anything at face value here without analyzing things for yourself since people are always trying to take your money. I’m glad someone is rooting out this issue, but man does it feel like pre-teen drama at this point.
[deleted]
I had no idea how these crypto subs were manipulated until I lost my A$$ on some Alts. Hell, basically you could buy in early, hire an army of shills on the cheap and cash out big. Never used reddit before I bought crypto, so naive. As some mentioned, the CMC market cap is likely the majority of bag holders. “Hodl, never sell @ a loss” ;) 
otherwise they wouldn't  have spammed the HODL meme
Well this all branched off from that arson alt thread from yesterday. It was only my intention to make one or two comments about it to show that it was him, but unfortunately, like always, it spun into a big thing. 

If people weren't so opposed to exposing this stuff, then it wouldn't be such a drama-fest. The people who are claiming that none of it matters are off their rocker (or themselves compromised). 

I would really rather not have to be the one to do any of this, but imo it needs doing, so I'll absorb the pushback and hate that I get as a result. But yeah, I'm sure I could improve my approach, I'm just pretty tired of encountering the same thing (persons) over and over again. 
Why do you *not* care? You'd rather spend your time on reddit (or Twitter or anywhere else) unknowingly interacting with fake accounts? You'd rather do *that* than work to fix the problem?

Why? Crypto reddit is broken. Time to fix it.
Calm down Sherlock howd you deduce that one

Holy shit you must be a trillionaire!
Yeah I believe so. I can't imagine it was in btc...


No you are not, you're being the definition of nitpicky neckbeard who pushes glasses up his nose before saying "well akshuly"
Yeah, as I’ve said earlier, we’ve got some heavy resistance at $6800, and even heavier resistance at $7800, with confluence of log resistance and previous log support around $7500. I would be very surprised if it hits $8500, but who knows I guess.

 (Edit: Wow, the downvote brigade is in full force today! Sorry, sloppy.)
Lol everything was in the chart, nothing to do with mexican taccos
Todays thread was the most fucked up thing ive ever read in this sub.  Been coming for for quite some time.  And over time there have been a handful of people that I've concluded are genuine and i come here daily looking for comments from 5-6 accounts. Two of those accounts are Sloppy and gypsy. I just wanna say that i wish both of those guys the best and although i never say it i appreciate what they each contribute. Also ive noticed a lot of weird shit going on in this thread for the last few days, hope it is temporary as I get a lot out of this thread.  
I think it's more likely that there is a Dischord group that is coordinating to undermine the sub. ArsonBunny is almost certainly a member of one or more groups like that.

The statement above is one I can get behind!
All I'm trying to do is hold people to account and get the mods to act with more gusto and care. Trust me, this is the most thankless and joyless shit ever, I just do it because nobody else does and *somebody* should step out and at least be vocal about bullshit. It's not just arson or socks, I call out *anything* I detect to be manipulative bullshit, shilling or otherwise. Doesn't fly with me and I think I'm doing the sub a favor by blasting these repeat offenders. 

Thanks mate, gypsy has me paranoid af. If you're really not him, then I apologize for even making the accusation, but at this point my head is spinning with possibilities! 
a lot of people spammed the HODL meme for the lols, i did as well and i've sold multiple times, it's just a funny phrase people use on a bull run , don't take it literally 
I've been observing that people who don't usually comment on this sub have been responding to your posts at unusually high rates. So, there are some good data points coming in from that.
Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.

Lol. I haven't realised any of it yet. I have a long term plan. Gonna start selling in 2021.

it's a downvote bot lol. It's following me around for a week now. No mind :)
Ok. As it was in the charts and you read them as obvious.. you must be rich. Piece of shit. 
Yeah, there's no way so many of these arson accounts are actively posting on reddit most days. I can't imagine one person keeps up with all of that. Maybe they share a lot of the accounts. 

But yeah, *something* is happening and it sucks. Probably has been going on for a long time and most of it probably goes unnoticed. Most of it might seem harmless enough, but taken as a whole, it's most certainly not. 

Sucks that it's just a game of whack-a-mole and the problem will probably get **much** worse, should crypto ever start to turn bullish again.
[removed]
I agree that this manipulation is a problem and should be rooted out. But you must admit, it is a bit confusing and exhausting to track this drama. The two of you write the most long-winded, in-depth analyses. I guess this could be helpful evidence for the mods in doling out bans. But at this point, I have to assume that any >500 word essays on the topic are either you or arson, because frankly nobody seems to be quite as concerned about the issue as much as you two are. I also believe you came out and said you had at least one other account (if not more) for the purpose of up-voting your own comments. Not sure if this was some meta-level joke or something, but you must admit it makes the whole thing much more confusing.

Anyway, I appreciate that you’re weeding out the issue, as reddit+crypto leads to some pretty wicked manipulation. But you can’t blame people for getting exhausted by it.
Sloppy, you are doing exactly what he wants. Spending time, thinking about him, writing about him, caring. Basically you are feeding him with your posts and me now too.
(It does not matter if there is not only one of them.)
I am not /u/The_OPs_Mommy, but believe what you will. I wouldn't feign unintelligence and ignorance on most matters if I were the same person as him. Instead I would just write cogent and detailed analysis and help clarify things with people. I'm sort of flattered you think I'm secretly quant pretending to be dumb on this account. 

Anyhow, I understand why you're paranoid now because of how unverifiable most of this shit is. Just know that I would never behave as such. I may not have statistical intelligence, but I have ethical intelligence and sock puppets and manipulation are completely unacceptable in my view. Hence, why I'm so vocal about arson and other bullshit. Someone should say something with regard to these matters and, because pretty much nobody except me says anything, I tend to speak strongly and combatively about it (especially at this point in time). Why should manipulation go unchecked? Not if I have anything to do with it.

Anyway, I'm drunk and I didnd't even read the entire exchange above so I'm not exactly sure what led you to this paranoia, but I assure you that I would never waste my time on such a childish activity. 
Wow, people, you ended up turning away possibly the best contributor to this sub. =(
The crypto equivalent if "it's just a prank?" As if saying it's a joke absolves someone if the inconsistency of saying one thing and doing another. 
Yeah, this is routine at this point. That's why it pisses me off to no-end that non-manipulator, seemingly honest /u/sloppysynapses keeps engaging with these accounts as if they're legitimate. He acts like shit like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8v7f2v/daily_discussion_sunday_july_01_2018/e1legui/?context=3) is accurate.

>Person A: someone who daytraded away a lot of BTC/coins and wants it back (source: very old posts), and **only posts speculative "it's either going up or down" stuff**

When? When have I ever done that? I don't even make price prediction and any analytical points I make (which are rare to begin with) are always heavily qualified and attached to a disclaimer. This is a complete mischaracterization of me. This person is just fabricating nonsense and making me out to be something I'm not.

Look at all the upvotes [these comments got](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8v7f2v/daily_discussion_sunday_july_01_2018/e1l8ea9/). 

What? *Why*? Why would I ever make an account, get 133K, then attack that account from another account? Where is the motivation? Am I shilling some shitcoin? Am I telling people how they should trade? Am I acting at all disingenuously?

Not as far as I can tell.

Or [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8v7f2v/daily_discussion_sunday_july_01_2018/e1lbq7x/?context=3)?

>Sloppy, you are doing exactly what he wants. Spending time, thinking about him, writing about him, caring. Basically you are feeding him with your posts and me now too. (It does not matter if there is not only one of them.)

Yeah... that's definitely my goal, to get people to spend their time thinking about my anonymous reddit handle. Right...

These people are either completely misguided or are slighting me for some other reason. I can take the "gypsy, this is obnoxious. Who cares?" comments, but this is entirely different. This is a misacharacterization of me and for whatever reason Sloppy buys into it. 

I assure you this is not exactly a pleasant ordeal for me. I get nothing out of this, tangible or otherwise.
You made me laugh :)

I saw your comment yesterday about a bot following you, but didn’t realize what sort of bot it was. Seeing a downvote bot following you, and MikeXBT getting downvoted for hedging his balance on Friday makes me even more skeptical of this sub at the moment. Maybe it’s just groupthink at play, but I’ve noticed the same thing happen to me when I called for reversals at the tops/bottoms of cycles in the past as well.

It seems the general community still manages to make top-quality comments visible, but it’s curious that certain dialogues are getting suppressed at key price levels.

Or maybe I’m just paranoid.

I keep my long winded rabbit hole (lol pun not intended) rants to one account. Trust me, I know this is a complete waste of time and energy at this point and I'm reluctant to get back into it again, but duty calls and I've already gone this far. I wish all this horseshit would just go away easily or that someone else would pickup the slack but other than OP's_Mommy's helpful responses, it's mostly just me. 

I'm not *him* btw. I would never do such a stupid thing and I certainly wouldn't feign stupidity on this account if I actually had his breadth of knowlodge.

Also, like I said, I'm pretty drunk and not even caught up on all the drama that took place over the past few hours. 

Cheers to legit users, m8!
Yea, I think you're right. Kinda over the whole thing. Weird af. 
Trust me, my goal is not to get anyone to spend unnecessary time on any of this. I'm not attention whoring.  
lol you're gonna put that on me? I'm trying to mediate all of these wack-ass situations. Don't you think it was a little weird how much they both cared about arson? o_O

no one else really gave a shit. if TOPM isn't gypsy, then blame it on gypsy, not me. dude is making everyone paranoid and harassing people via PMs and shit. really though mods should've done something a while ago
he even said it, it's a MEME , i don't think no one actually believed you would HODL until bitcoin replaces usd. 

The way the meme was born was hilarious and a super funny joke, if you don't like it i couldn't care less , people who take memes literally are really out of touch 
I understand the desire to clean this stuff up. I have that desire too. We can't get it done all at once. Some people will become exhausted by it. Let them rest.

It is a bit weird, especially considering we're at such an important price level...it really seems natural this sub would be manipulated - there are quite a few people with a lot of money here, if someone believed this sub could affect price I could understand that. It would really be funny if I ever had any effect on the price! Lol I really doubt it though

Rabbits have 28 teeth.
What, dude? You really think I'm attention whoring? You really think I'm arson? You really think I'm doing this for some *other* reason?

Why? Why would *I* do that? Why would I trash an account with 133K karma? Is there some long con you think I'm playing here? Like *I'm* suddenly going to start shilling something?

Why?

All these people that are PMing you and commenting saying I'm crazy (and now that *I'm* arson. Lolwut?) are fooling you. 

Not sure what you think I'm getting out of this whole ordeal, but I assure you the effects are almost entirely negative. All I get is additional hate, threats and intimidation (mostly from arson himself). That's not exactly my idea of a good time, but I don't mind enduring all this hate and harassment for the sake of speaking out about lying and manipulation.

It's wrong. Period. Arson and *all of his accounts* should be banned from reddit permanently. 

Did you see the OP's Mommy linked that other complain about him shilling political subs and whatnot. That person PM'd me a list of names and linked to that comment. They watched the drama unfold here and pointed out that they had gone through the exact same thing previously. 

I feel bad that you're all disoriented over this, Sloppy, really I do. But don't be confused as to what's what. I'm not a faker and neither is OP's mommy or any of the others who have affirmed that arson is a scammer. I'm just pointing out that this guy is using a FUCKTON of alts, apparently. Why? I don't know. It's not my job to figure out why he's doing it, I'm just pointing out that he is, in fact, for whatever reason, behaving this way and it's scummy as all hell.
Not you specifically, but it seems like quite a few people got caught up in Internet drama instead of, well, focusing on the art of better trading.

My understanding (I mostly lurk though)...

Person A: someone who daytraded away a lot of BTC/coins and wants it back (source: very old posts), and only posts speculative "it's either going up or down" stuff

Person B: a highly sophisticated algo trader whose each post is a goldmine of information

If they were the same person, that would be some next-level mind jedi stuff. :)

It was just a prank bro.

Good bot
> If they were the same person, that would be some next-level mind jedi stuff. :)

I agree, definitely lol. So that's why I'm like o_O and now I feel bad. I wish I just wouldn't have gotten involved at all, what a bunch of useless drama. If TOPM really is just a brilliant hilarious quant guy then I'm sad I fucked things up. gypsy just making me hella paranoid lately. should've just stayed out. I will probably apologize to TOPM soon and ignore any further Arson drama I see
>Person A: someone who daytraded away a lot of BTC/coins and wants it back (source: very old posts), and only posts speculative "it's either going up or down" stuff

I've already made a good portion of it back and I'm insulted that you think I make up or down predictions. If you read anything I ever wrote, you would know that I do no such thing. 

But whatever, strawman me all you want. What do I care, everyone else is doing it too at this point. 

:/
tough so ;)
Thanks! You can ask me for more facts any time. Beep boop.
We need the bull market to resume so people can focus on more good things instead :)
> gypsy just making me hella paranoid lately. 

**That's because arson alts keep messaging you. I don't know what this cryptosecrecy fellow was saying to you via PM, but I'd certainly be interested to know why all these accounts are messaging you and then trying to get you to defend themselves and arson**

You're a jackass, Sloppy. You make this problem so much worse, not because you stick you're nose in it, but because you are completely oblivious to the facts of the matter. 

Your paranoia is your own doing. I wonder if you're predisposed (in which case, again, sorry) because I don't see anyone else saying that they're suffering from paranoia or delusions based on this drama. Most of the trusted folks seem to see this extremely clearly, including the mods. 

You have a sugar coated exterior, but you're kind of a feckless cunt at the end of the day. Don't take the wrong side *for once*, how about you?
Not meant to reference you specifically, even. Nearly *everyone* in this sub posts "it's certainly going up or down" predictions and draws magic triangles. It's all in good fun though. :)

Who are the quality information-based posters? There's OPM, MikeXBT, and maybe a couple of others.
How many teeth do weasels have?
Agreed :P
I'm over this, dude. You have harassed like three dozen people over the past few weeks in the name of some guy posting on a few alt accounts. It really doesn't matter that much in the end- it's not worth it if that's the price we all have to pay so you can feel like you get to play sheriff for a bit.

You are an extremely unpleasant individual and it's truly painful interacting with you sometimes. You're toxic, extremely belligerent and full of ridiculous insults all of the time. One of the most toxic individuals I have ever met.

I don't really feel it's necessary to explain myself any further- please just leave me out of the rest of the drama. I need to focus on the market. If you keep harassing people, I'm going to contact the admins since the mods won't do anything. Please don't communicate with me again
Joyrider, Jared, Chewy, MidnightOcean, ibankbtc, HotSoccerMan and a good amount of others. 

Yeah most people are completely waving their hands around, but that's not me. I **never** pretend to be clairvoyant and qualify everything I say with caveats, probability distributions and inexpertise and I hardly even talk about price movements directly anyhow. I'm mostly responding to others, asking questions, etc. It's completely off base to think that I peddling nonsense into the sub. In fact, that's the very thing I'm complaining about with arson. Not only is he using **tons** of socks, his "analysis" is so stupid and incoherent but he's verbose and grandiose and he buys himself gold and upvotes (and positive comments) so his idiotic shit reaches the front page. 

Sorry you don't believe me or mods or OP Mommy or /u/justsomebadadvice or anyone else who sees this clearly. For whatever reason, some people in this sub just refuse to see this for what it is and instead want to turn it into a witch hunt and harassment campaign on *me*.

You inserted yourself into this drama and, like I said, couldn't even be bothered to analyze the situation correctly. Over and over again you have missed the target entirely. 

It's ~~funny~~ sad that I gave you some [pretty poignant and blunt feedback](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8uzb6w/daily_discussion_saturday_june_30_2018/e1k6gx6/) earlier and this is how you fucking respond? 

Go ahead and hate me instead of the cat fishers and arson alts that PM you. You're being lied to but not by me. Wake up and stop being so oblivious to the situation at hand. 

**You're being played, fool.**
