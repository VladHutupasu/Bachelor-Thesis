7500 was the level where no one wanted to sell below and no one wanted to buy above.

6550 is the level where bears and bulls draw the line on the sand and are willing to fight till death
I think this still can go up until 6.8 but it's hanging from a thread here. I have sells staggered all the way up there with stops above 7K, and I'm hoping I can catch a wick to fill some aggressive orders.

But if this does indeed break down here, I'm dipping a toe first.

!short xbtusd 6500 10X 25%

Will go all in if the ascending channel completely breaks down.

Long from $6,480ish with about 50% of a planned position, will add to this incrementally down to $6,200 as I believe we could range between there and around $6,800. Plan to close somewhere around $6,800 depending on how we get there.
Interesting article on German state news:

Used google translate: >The EU, for example, has set itself the goal of being the world leader in this field. "Blockchain is a modern technology and we strive to make the EU the global leader in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution," said Eva Kaili, Member of the European Parliament and member of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.<

I'm thinking we move up, had a MA cross on the 4hr, and a [TK cross](https://snag.gy/SPEdeU.jpg).   You could watch [this box](https://snag.gy/SCQXvB.jpg) and play it how it moves up or down but I think we go up, theres also a bull div on there.  
Clearly, they think they're legit:

Added 5% more to my long from $6,480 posted [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8r83yz/daily_discussion_friday_june_15_2018/e0puhp3/) at $6,450ish as the volume seemed relatively low, now have 55% invested into this position and will add another 5% if we get into the low $6400s.

edit: added a bit more at $6410
No trade zone.
May not mean much but worth pointing out, we are reaching the end of our bull flag at the moment and on the 30 minute Ichimoku we have a kumo twist to a green cloud. 

On the 30 min chart at least one could suggest that the break UP is potentially incoming within the next couple of hours. 

take with the usual caveats of downward Bartland which conversely, could rip my pants off and force feed me a ruler (sideways) up my jackson.
Just saw a whole wave of Bitmex advertisement spam on crypto-related chatrooms / boards I'm in. 'Make big money with a small investment thanks to 100x leverage!' 

What a fucking Siren's call, rofl. 
Since the breakdown of the meme triangle, nothing will make me bullish anymore.

Including but not limited to:

- President Trump announces Bitcoin as national Currency

- OPEC will now only trade oil with Bitcoins

- Bill Gates converts every USD he owns into Satoshis and then proceeds to pump the entire market (it'll  just be a pump and dump)

- Samsung Galaxy S10 will be powered by the ICON blockchain

- The entire Rothschild family collectively suicides after realizing they cannot stop the blockchain revolution.

- Wakanda actually exists and they've had Bitcoin as their national currency since 2009

- A man from the future claims Ethereum will literally power the fucking world and will be worth millions. 

- Satoshi Nakamoto was actually a Anunnaki god from planet Nibiru who came down to give us a financial revolution just like he did with agriculture.




I rushed into a short yesterday that would be in profits right now BUT I'm glad I'm out right now, because this looks like a lot of fuckery is coming.

My plans for a position and patience until then:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/JFLu6CtZ/

Only thing I missed, if 6300 breaks, then bottom short it.
https://www.sifrdata.com/cryptocurrency-correlation-matrix/

The 90 day correlation for BTC to the stock market (SPX, S&P 500) is now nearly double (-0.17) the inverse correlation between the stock market and gold (-0.09).
Hey guys burger here. Been using kraken and I hate it. Any Americans use a VPN for bitmex? Any issues? Really considering it 
I wanted to share a more bearish perspective to balance out my earlier bullish wedge: [https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8r83yz/daily\_discussion\_friday\_june\_15\_2018/e0q2r6f/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8r83yz/daily_discussion_friday_june_15_2018/e0q2r6f/), as I'm trying to figure out where this is heading next. I promise I'm done spamming today's daily after this, but I figured it was worth sharing both sides of the (bit)coin.

This model actually shows us bottoming out around the same time (August-September 2018). To be honest, this one seems bit more believable, considering the lack of wick-cutting shenanigans and the multiple points of contact leading back to 2015. This figure shows us bleeding down the previous ATH resistance-turned-support log line until reaching the long-term log support line. Hopefully we can find support there to begin reversing the downward trend:

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/K887NOvv/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/K887NOvv/)

Thoughts?
I'm taking my first entry on a new short on September here. We're forming a bear pennant on the 30m chart, and we seem to have been rejected off overhead resistance fairly convincingly. 

Micro: https://www.tradingview.com/x/vhILYXj1/  
Macro: https://www.tradingview.com/x/qmUIZZgJ/  
Daily: https://www.tradingview.com/x/ebBCkGZa/  

Yesterday's news/relief rally reset RSI (always avoid annoying alliteration) on the 30m-4H, and our daily RSI is now comfortably out of oversold. Friday began our plummet out of the pennant last week, and I think this SEC news has been overvalued. Hearing that the SEC is not going to treat BTC as a security (...they already said as much in the past) shouldn't surprise anyone. As for ETH, read what they said carefully. It was very intentionally worded. The most likely bullish scenario for this "news" is that US-based exchanges will de-list potential securities tokens and push those funds into BTC/ETH. Global exchanges don't answer to the SEC, but we may see more KYC from them. *Everything else* concerning about BTC and the crypto space remains unchanged from two days ago. 

I'm far from convinced 6100 was the bottom of this movement. There are a lot of similarities between where we are now and where we were a week ago at 7500, except we've *already* broken down out of the daily pennant, which is more bearish. This entry doesn't even really make me net short, and I'm opening small intentionally to give myself room to comfortably add all the way up to 6800 if need be.

!short XBTU18 6485 3x 25%

Good luck everyone. 
Feel free to downvote but just wanted to say this sub is great. You guys are very professional and I’ve learned a lot lurking and reading comments. Hope you all retire on luxury yachts. 
We are at the end of a pennant, so a bigger move is likly. Quick poll: [https://strawpoll.com/wscdsegf](https://strawpoll.com/wscdsegf)
This drop looks like it was some big longs from ~6100-6200 area closing. We went from 30k to 32k there, now back to 30k. 
TA proves how accurate it is once again...30 minutes ago most here posting "this looks like it's about to fly"...and it goes down instead.
Morning. 

I use =GOOGLEFINANCE("btcusd") in my google sheet but today it stopped reporting any data and i only get N/A. 

Does anyone know how to get the BTC price into the spreadsheet now? Thanks :)


*Edit* After a bit more research i found a fix. Put *=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:BTCUSD")* instead!

Have a nice day.
https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-06-15/bitcoin-manipulation-study-is-less-than-it-seems

Looks like the tether study has been blown out of proportion. 
Regardless of if you're making money or not, it's nice to see some volatility again. I don't know if any of you guys were around way back then, but earlier this june we were stagnant within the same 100USD block for almost two days once. Now we're bouncing up and down like there's actual life here, with enough variance that it's not just bot chop in the 5m. I was afraid that we'd enter a long stagnation over the summer, so this spark is nice to see.
we're being played with boys and girls!

BTC being shoved into a corner

https://www.tradingview.com/x/9PtzNlOc/

Haven’t been trading much, but may jump into a trade here if the following play out:

A) Long if the red line is broken with conviction
B) Short the resistance ( red line ) if failed to break through again
C) Short if green line falls 

Enjoy the weekend all, have some beers 
Just closed my long from 6250 at 6440 and opened a short at 6400. Consistent selling pressure after breaking down out of what looks to be a textbook bear flag. In this market I can't forsee a solid bounce getting me a better entry. Will add on more once we break 6250 or if we bounce up to resistance of the triangle/flag we just broke down from today.

Edit: looking back, the first two huge wick attempts at 6700 were a clear signal to close my long which I thought about and ignored due to greed. Especially because I believed the rally was only temporary. When whales see other whales' pump attempts get eaten up, it has a chilling effect on any large buyer trying to start FOMO. 
[Longs are dropping at 6350](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/hrPIjL8T/)? Where is the resistance?  

The SEC brought some relief to the markets with the “good news”, some  other nice news include Bittrex trading with actual US Dollars. This  brings some hope that the Tether situation will not blow up in  Cryptoland faces. Lets take a look at what the market has been up to.

Taking a step back to the 1 Day candle charts to get a Eagle eye view  of the price action this year. We have a beautiful confirmed descending  triangle with a lovely divergence, made clear for us by the MACD  indicator.

Many of the serious Bulls gave their thoughts on the markets above  $7000, and with the SEC news out this is basically discounted Bitcoin.  Of course nobody can predict the markets and I am very interested to see  how the price action treats us going into the weekend.

As you can see on the chart the triangle is getting ready to show us a  final outcome as the prices get coiled tighter again with the Bulls and  the Bears battling it out, for now. As most of our community know by  now I don’t trade the fundamentals, but I do believe it is always good  to stay mindful, separating FUD and Fiction from the real news.

In the past the SEC news has been major turning points in the market, lets be patient and see what the Big BTC will do!

Summary

Longer term speaking I think the market is looking very healthy, for  those that bought above $7000 I would relax and try not to over trade.  One thing I am curiously looking out for is what the little crypto’s  will do when Bitcoin starts flexing its muscles again.

Support – $6000 – $6500 (We can see good price action in this zone)

Resistance – $7000 – $7100

We can expect prices to start moving up quicker should we consolidate above $7200.

but muh triangle breakdown 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/j4Zo7e9X/
I see so many people open short with confident on this sub, but:

- RSI oversold and going up over 30 <checked>
- Volume is higher than the last 30 days <checked>
- Price bounced back around $6100 <checked>
- Price action, a daily green candle which closed higher than the opening price of yesterday candle, at $6543 (checked)
- Good news from S.E.C <checked>

So why? R/R is not worth at this situation.
Yo, been gone a while, still educating myself. Only problem i have at the moment is that the more i learn, the more resources i find, this means i have even more to learn which just kinda makes it a spiral of shit to learn which can be quite demotivating.

Anyway, i had longs filled at 6350, 6250 and 6150 so avg of 6250 but ended up closing at like 6320 so yeah... right before the pump which sucks but im getting decent at catching local bottoms.

Cred pointed out a nice bear block (red) within a bear block (grey) which i was gonna short but didnt have the balls. considering shorting on retest with a rejection.

Also watching the bull div on the daily but it still has a while to be confirmed (red line)

Certainly helps checking through all your transfers and make a complete calculation of your investments and stuff. Turns out I actually made more profit then I originally assumed (about 10&#37; more on my total capital)  


I could put a stop below 6k and still come out with profit. Makes me feel a bit more comfortable atm
https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/volume/3d/USD?t=b&vu=curr

Looking at volume data, for the 3-day chart, it's definitely been trending down up to today. It seems we're breaking 6.4k now so it's a pretty bearish outlook.
[I wrote that](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8qphc3/daily_discussion_wednesday_june_13_2018/e0lbo9x/) I was expecting a short squeeze up from 6700. Obviously, I was wrong. I held my long all the way down through to 6100 and closed at 6600 for a small loss. Out of position now.

I'm now planning to short 7200-7300 or long 5200-5300, whichever comes first. It's fine for me either way. Let's wait and see.
Price action to me looks a lot like the bounce off 7050; choppy barting grind upwards.

ACTIVATE SUB-$6500 FINEX TETHER BOOSTERS
Is there any exchange that provide longs and shorts number besides finex?

This got me thinking. On the bull run a lot of noobs used gdax and coinbase. They can't short there, right? Big platforms that allow margin for noobs are kraken, finex and Mex. Kraken used to work crappy, so I think not a lot of people use it for shorting. Finex blocked trading for less than 10k balance for bigger part of this year, then cut US customers. I think a lot of new people may not know that 10k limit was taken down. So all the burned FOMO noobs that thought they get rich on BTC and now think they get rich by shorting are on Mex?

I'm just thinking that we only have data from finex. That means we have data from non US traders which either opened account before December or put there at least $10k. I think the ratio can be completely different than we see on finex charts.
This pattern is not often refered to, but I observed quite often that it plays out in the bitcoinmarket: Descending broadening wedge [https://imgur.com/a/T9aag0B](https://imgur.com/a/T9aag0B)

For reference: [http://thepatternsite.com/dbw.html](http://thepatternsite.com/dbw.html)
Maybe Tone Vays Cash was right all along about the 3-4K bottom. It is looking more and more likely imo. 


Bear markets are much more painful than what we got so far... true bottoms are typically lower than what you expect and when we get there... most people will be too scared to buy when they should be buying. 70% below ATH is a decent bear market but I’m more convinced the true bottom will be around 80% below (~4K). 

A true bear market don’t end with a V shaped bottom (unless capitulation), more of a stretched out curved bottoms indicating a period of accumulation. We’re getting there, and hopefully it won’t take a whole year. But I wouldn’t mind to be honest. 

The little relief rally yesterday was just that, a relief rally. I was planning to sell a couple of BTC on Wed night so I could scoop them back up later... looked at the chart and noticed how quickly the price dropped over the last few days and RSI on every timeframe was way oversold. So I held back for a bounce, and I’m glad I did. But it’s hilarious how people think we’re back to a bullmarket now because of SEC. We weren’t in a bear market because of the SEC and until this cycle completes it doesn’t matter what they think of ETH. Speaking of SEC, even though I have 6-figures worth of ETH I would’ve preferred if they had labeled it a security... I fucking hate the newbies in r/cryptocurrency and r/ethtrader... seeing some of their tears would’ve been satisfying. Bitcoin has stayed true to what blockchains are supposed to be, its growth was organic and it’s a grassroots movement without a figurehead... ETH? Pre-mine, ICO, ethereum foundation, “corporate partnerships”, Vitalik consensus, bailouts, and it brought with it 90% of the garbage in CMC along with the 2016+ newbies turned Bitcoin haters who think all blockchains are equal to Bitcoin’s. Most of these newbies are looking for the next Bitcoin, decentralization is an afterthought and they get swayed by gimmicky marketable “features” without considering the tradeoffs. *XRP does 10K transactions per second and is only $1?? What’s the point of Bitcoin?* It’s everything wrong with this space and I think ETH helped facilitate this mentality.  

But in the end, I do believe Bitcoin has the merit to hold itself and I’m not worried about the future with everything that’s happening. I wouldn’t bet against ETH either, that’s why I hold some, but it sure as hell ain’t no Bitcoin. I think a good thing that will come out of people getting REKT with shitcoins in this bear market is that they will learn and start to appreciate what makes Bitcoin unique. In 2017 it was cool to hate on Bitcoin... I think by 2019 it will be cool love Bitcoin again. 

Anyway, bear market, hopefully will turn bullish sometime this year. I don’t trade because short term price prediction is hard, but I’m 70% sure we’re heading over the next month or few. Wasn’t convinced with the 6K tripple bottom, buying volume was abysmal, and the chart is a little too weak to be hanging around so close to that bottom. Once we fall below 6500 next time that’s probably it.  
Where did all the contract options go on Bitmex? I want to short XRP, but the only option is for June 29th, and I'd like a much longer term. There used to be an option for like 3 months out.


Managed to reopen my hedge at 6550 and close the long at 6500.

Bad timing with the long close, but this rejection of the break out got me off guard.

Gonna keep with the hedge for now. Looks like yesterday's pump don't have legs. Too many profit takers.

Edit: lol, like wtf, now wicked below the flag and 6.5 support.
What do we consider the "if it breaks, get rekt" support line to be right now?
Where are our major support levels here on down?
welp this is probably gonna chop around for a week, buckle up boys n girls
I didn't know how much of the alt market is directly tied to tether.

https://coinlib.io/global-crypto-charts?theme=dark#global_money_flow

Anyone have substantial criticism of this? The model doesn't look complete to me. I'm wondering what others think.
is this now the fakeout or the real breakout?
So what's the peanut gallery thinking about today?
Some bull hope: [https://imgur.com/a/TkABFPL](https://imgur.com/a/TkABFPL)

Edit: nope
Bitcoin limping along...
Short or long...
Short or long...  
Eth/usd is building a bart. Will drag btc with it probably.

Edit: Bart cancelled
It seems a lot of people are expecting BTC to drop to $4k including myself.... Therefore Im now doubting it'll get that low.... 
!long xbtu18 add 6560 1x 20%

Added a bit to my long. We developed nice bull flag and we're above 6.5 support/resistance.

It's more of a gamble here. Position is small enough to not hurt me if this goes down.

Still not much of an idea where this is going. Just gonna watch for now.
Closed my short here for a small profit. I think this can still go lower but i didnt sleep last night babysitting an underwater short thanks to that dildo.

I need some rest and reset my mindset to scalp positions. I had 2 great trades this week that made me risk a bit more and letting the trades go longer. That mindset nearly gave me a new butthole with some help from the bgd.

I'll try to be out of position during the weekend and use that time to improve the position bot. Maybe create some short of weekly statistics.

This Chop City is getting smaller movements and reducing the probability of good trades so trade safe and prioritize taking profits instead of trying to get the most out of each trade. That's how paper profits vanish right before our eyes.


If anyone has ideas or suggestions to the bot let me know. 
Every pump is answered with selling. I can't see this breaking up unless it's done by a whale in seconds. A organic breakout not gonna happen.
[https://imgur.com/a/Zu5aqSQ](https://imgur.com/a/Zu5aqSQ)

Found some pattern. 6h RSI, have not been 1 time overbought since 23 April (almost 2month ago, if you take this other top since 4th Mai or so). If we continue with the pattern we should go up soon.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/8zKHxa6E/

I’ve been following these trend lines on ETH. Bounced off nicely. IMO it’s been quite the leader for BTC. Stay tuned. 
Hopium for bulls if this closes as a higher low on the 4hr chart. Got into a long in the fomo yesterday but not feeling good about this. One more BRD down wicking 6.0-6.1k this gets so ugly. 

Edit: hah and down we went
Looking really bullish if you FLIP the chart! [https://www.tradingview.com/x/tZVeiqWc/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/tZVeiqWc/)

Nice little "bull" flag on the daily. I think we're about to bust through previous "high" at 6100 "up" to 5000. LOL

/s
Nothing like the American morning Friday dump
In addition to my previous comments about why i think we will go lower, take a look at the 200ema. Last time we were under it for a while things got really bad, we havent been under it this long since 2014 when it broke down through it at 665 and went eventually to a low of 165. Previous high before that was 1200 from nov/dec of 2013. Looks very similar to the action we saw last year and this year.
Was thinking that a test of that channel line around the twist would be a good place to add to the long.  Will let it go though if it convincingly goes below now.

https://imgur.com/rpD31kg

Again on the philosophy of longing where you'd put your stops...
Is piercing a support and bouncing up the same as bouncing without piercing it?
Alright, so I'm a bit bearish myself, but I had a Shower Thought^(TM) today, and wanted to supply a bit of hopium for the bulls. This requires the wicks to be cut on the daily, which I think is fair since the daily close is likely what's important anyway. This is possibly the last hope for bulls, considering the ascending support was broken and a descending triangle is uber bearish.

Theory: This is a big bullish wedge forming from ATH coming down to test long-term support around $5800.

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/Lk2i4oI8/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Lk2i4oI8/)

Thoughts?
February to now will look flat as a pancake when we're at $180K, just like other periods that seemed very intense with their wild fluctuations between $800 and $250 (or $20 to $150  -- but that was before my time) look now. 

That's how it is, folks. It's math.  It's just math.  If you don't understand it, you'll soon be working for people who do.
If I were a hedge fund and I look at yesterday's news - ETH not being a security, I'd start thinking the idea of investing, then all my chartists would go and come back with the result that we are in a bearish downtrend looking to bottom over next month or so - what would I do? wait or invest?, if nothing will start building a position to enter while the price action continues.

Yes, the horizon would be over the next few years, but no likes to buy something and start losing money on it.

Everyone on the mother effin earth is now waiting for a lower value..
[deleted]
Back down to 6450 then onwards to 6850 and then I have NFI.

Haven't seen bulls this weak in quite some time , painful to watch.
Low volume, sideways until the next dump. I'm shorting here.
[deleted]
6450 resistance is looking like its turned into support,  I expected us to sell down by now, got stopped out of my long this morning at a tiny profit, relonging here, target is 6850.
How do you guys feel about this bull flag?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/aTFwlabw/

I find it weird that most of the volume is on top resistance and they get rejected quickly.

Seems like bears are letting bulls run up before slaming it down until they finally decide to break down.
Man that news yesterday didn't do much to inspire buyers 
Hi guys. Have a question. Is it possible to get automated signals somewhere? Suppose I'm looking at MACD and I want a signal whenever there's a crossover. Is this possible in some platform or can I program it somewhere? Any help is greatly appreciated. 
So glad?
White House just approved extended tariffs on Chinese stuff. This may have likely negative influence on stocks and maybe, positive on crypto.

Do you think it would be possible to create a bot that shorts BGD and longs BRD? There is always a retracement immediately after this kind of formations (within 5 mins) so this is where you profit and close the positions again. Do you think it would be worth to follow such a strategy?
There is no support. Doom is coming.
The last couple of days it seems I'm good at buying high and selling low. Which annoyed me so much that I just decided to move some funds to Bitfinex to try some margin/short trading.

Question: is the default leverage 3.3x or is there a setting to lower this?
OK, I'm loving that big red candle.  Long at 6530 with 2x lev.

[edit -- damn, jumped the gun. should have waited.  will add at 6350 if it goes there.]
I'm a buyer here.  The bears had time to knock it down but it's starting to show some real demand.  I think the pattern of the chart looks more healthy because it's not sideways and flat like it has been for so long.  It looks like it's becoming more binary with true disagreement and conviction on both sides as to price level.  I think bulls come out on top simply because of it being oversold ultimately.  Bulls have more cash to lop up loose coin at these low prices.  
Upvote if you have completely lost interest in the price of Bitcoin.

*yawn* wake up to find, surprisingly, that my long from 6600 is down again. Not concerned. It's a beautiful day. I'm going to enjoy it and not even look at Bitcoin or this sub. 

Have a great day! If you're short, don't be greedy. If you're long, don't take your profits too soon.
Alrighty. Going short here.... ETH ($505.20) looks like it is about to drop here in the next hour or so. Could continue up slightly but I don't think this is going to play out for the better.

Edit: Whoa, sorry for not providing enough TA to make it appropriate for this sub. Yeeesshhh. Doesn't look as though I was wrong though. Keepin my short open until I see ETH hit $469 or BTC $6150.

Daily Bitcoin Update (6/15/18) + Technical Analysis

https://youtu.be/wtAwvmaqunU
Bitcoin has forsaken us :( 
I'll be the first to give some ta. Remember you heard it here first:

I can confidently say that the bullish trend will continue with a probability of 50%

I can also undisputedly say that the bearish trend will continue with a probability of 50%

Good trading!
While my long term strategy of shorting since $15k has been and will continue to be successful for a while, I do wonder how much more profitable I'll be when the tether/bitfinex crime syndicate is broken up. Combined with the lightning network still being vaporware, I have difficulty imagining just how much money us shorters are going to make. It's probably going to be scary. I predict that we continue to see downside daily until the criminals start getting rounded up and then I'll just get out because it is going to be crazy.
Upward channel breaking [down](https://www.tradingview.com/x/gzI0xtQp/) already??

ICO's will be classified as securities, so all the funds raised in ETH/BTC will probably be sold off.

Why are people selling at these prices, it obviously wants to go up so why not let it and sell less at a higher price.

It is price suppression and impatience, fucking bullshit.
So is this going to continue like last time until volume dries up?
So you're saying 6550 is the bottom? Because there is no way the bears can win such a battle. They'll run out of rare and precious Bitcoin long before bulls will run out of dollars.
20k was the line where stupid normies entered cryptospace, and got fucked hard.
bloody heck. 10x with 25&#37; of your stack is dipping a toe???? isn't that like a normal position?
I hate to be 'that guy' who talks about feelings and shows no TA but if it's due to go up it could stay up through the whole weekend. Or stay where it is for another 12 hours before a GD starts off a round of buying before profit taking on Monday.
No TK cross on the double settings 4hr, which is less error prone. Also even on default settings, price is still well below cloud and cloud is thickening. 
These are all good and usefull indicators in a bull market.

This is probably not the case right now. We will find out soon but my guess is that we will head south fast.
Oh mama time to moon
Wohoo Tether printer,$100 million = 15k btc buying power at current price! Bears gonna cry wolf now!
Is he awake? Pamp it. 
That might explain the 17.15 (UTC) pump.
identical to my average entry point, with tight stops. good luck dude
Really looks text book... we’ll find out soon!
What settings?  On 20/60/120/30 it's above the cloud, the twist is ahead but traversing it would put the price a drop down *below* 6475.
"Make big money with 100x short"
Well, it makes sense: Their CEO has said publicly that 100x is really there to be an advertising play, and that the average leverage used is about 7x.

No different from forex brokers.  Well a little different.  Some of them offer 500x leverage.
ICON one is not very far fetched, go with the hyperconnecting South and North Korea into imperial Korea.
That first one sounds nice.

What does this mean?

I do!  I live in California and use hide.me for bitmex.  I paid extra to have unlimited memory usage tho which is kinda pricey but worth it.  

Here's the link.  It even has an app that use and run bitmex through the safari on my Ipad.  Just make sure to connect to your VPN before logging in or else it won't work.  

P.s. I have my VPN set to Montreal Canada.  :-)

https://hide.me/en/
use it to register, after that they  don't care 
I used a VPN. Just need it when signing up. Aside from losing money, no issues at all.
Nah, just use it to login and maybe first transfer, then you are good.

Don't get rekt.
I think we haven't seen the bottom yet. Volume and interest, which is a big driving factor in crypto, just isn't there right now. BTC before its most recent large drop on the 9th, BTC was at a only 2775 daily volume. The masses and the media dont care about BTC anymore and i think it will continue to fall. We'll see.
It's not about what are the news. It's the news itself. Some people gambled that it'll go up, that's why the pump. No follow up, bull flag broke down, so we're back where we were before the news.
Man that daily is bearish AF. 

We also have some nasty bear divs on the 4H.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/cn1XCaw3/

I think I'm gonna stagger sells all the way up to 6850, see if I can catch a ride with the big boys pumping to fill their shorts.
Nice conviction.  Thanks for sharing your chart.
Thanks for the sobering analysis as usual.
Very generous of you when my position I posted goes against me in 10mins. 
Hey everybody, it's /u/uRecycIops!
Up then down.
Just so you know I've voted up on both of your polls, some people will expect fakeouts and stuff 
Unlike yesterday, bears are winning today!
ignore all TA on anything below 4h charts and the results aren't nearly as terrible. 

That "bull flag" was oddly shaped and on a very low time frame. 

It's really pretty useless to trade on 15-30m candles in this market since it takes a week to make a big move now
They were right, it flew up, but then it immediately flew down
TA only reveals the highest probability outcome, it is neither accurate nor inaccurate.

I could say, "You'll probably never win the lottery." And chances are it'd turn out correct, but there's always a chance I could be wrong, and people with survivorship bias would come out saying, "Hurr once again proving how accurate you are, anyone can win the lottery hurr."
Looks like does not equal will do, patterns can break up or down 
technically both were right, it went up out of the flag and then it fell down :)

so take that as you want. There was profit there for both sides...technically
Because TA = a small selection of people on this subreddit? 
In my experience it "works" in some situations (recognizing patterns and pointing out possible scenarios), but it's a mystery to me **why** it apparently works. In this current situation, I'm not sure what exactly TA can say, as there seems to be several things going at the same time. A bull flag, but also a larger bear flag, etc.
Exactly why I was raising objections that it wasn't peer reviewed.  Showing it to your friends and uploading to SSRN isn't peer review.  You shouldn't get your first objective peer review from Bloomberg after the fact.
This was obvious tbh. Actually, the thread about it on here had some very insightful comments...
Tldr: paper used a lot of guesswork and people took it as fact
As someone with a science background and has actually gone through the process of peer review, this study is a load of shit and would never be taken seriously within the scientific community.

Unfortunately, the general population doesn't know how the process is undergone and will just assume that because it was posted somewhere it is true.

#fake news
how is it even called a study?  What data was gathered?  They looked at some charts and confused correlation/causation with an obvious bias.  Any 5th grader with google could do that study.




Yeah volume is not completely dead on GDAX anymore. We'll see how long that lasts. 

It's nice though that's for sure..Miss Jan/Feb 😭😭😭😭

\#bartfail
Felt more like a giveup since it wasn't provoked by sudden giant orders.
Or long just to be a fake out, switch to short just to see it bounce from 6k5 and rage quit kicking the table

:)
I'm short right now, and I have this pennant as well: https://www.tradingview.com/x/HOtL6deS/

I'm a little concerned if we drop though, and will be setting b/e stops if we do, because of this: https://www.tradingview.com/x/eSXi1WXQ/
Nice setup.  I moved the take profit on my long to just below the line.  Right now buyers aren't inspiring much confidence... going to let it ride however and see what happens
from them closing
Horizontal support at 6450 for now is hanging in there by a thread. 
Impressive trading
Eth went from 460 to 526 in about an hour. Then it went to 512 and back up again. Only the second time was btc dragged along. I went heavy short because Eth was going back down and btc had no growth on its own. In terms of rsi this bump helped clear it on shorter timeframes, and stoch rsi short term indicated that we were due for a leg down again.

Half my stack is 3x short from 6700, half my stack is 3x short eth from 525. Short term I see no reason for stops before breakeven.

In other words, I opened new shorts because there was an unusual event (pump on good news?! Never saw it) and my rules for when to trade heavily favoured shorting.
because we broke down out of consolidation range. Anything under the 1d time frame is basically irrelevant if you're going by TA and not trying to scalp. 

Imagine we broke to the upside of the triangle and we hit $11.3k (3% under highest high of the past ~5 months) 

And then it dipped down to $10200 (10% under that). Would you short that or long it? 

You know me and even I would long it...

Also: 

1. $7950 dip was a daily bullish engulfing. Look where that got us...

2. Being at $6100 is not bullish. It's neutral *at best*. Seriously, imagine me saying being at $11300 is bearish...how? Just because it would be a good short entry if it tanked doesn't mean it's a good short entry. Sure I'd love to short from $11.7k again if it tanked.. But if it got there, I doubt it would tank. Just because $6100-6600 is a nice cheap price doesn't make it a good time to buy (although it could be, just saying low prices don't necessitate that it's a good buy) 

3. the high volume came from breaking downwards out of the triangle after decreasing volume for like 3-4 months. That is a pretty clear signal of what's to come imo
I see so many people open long with confidence on this sub, but:

- interest is down consistently through the year <checked>
- low volumes in the grand scheme of things <checked>
- everyone already knew BTC was not a security <checked>
- the so called 'good news' could only push the price a couple of % when we've dropped significantly in the past weeks <checked>
- we have a significant drop and now $6500 is bullish af, but only last week $7k was bullish af, and before that $xxxx... <checked>

So why? R/R is not worth it at this situation.
We're smack in the middle of our channel/flag. Pure coinflip
Look at the 1d chart and you will have the obvious answer.
Volume expansion on the breakout of the symmetric triangle and breakdown of log support, in particular downwards volume, provides weight/confirmation to the breakdown. Going to keep looking for further volume expansion for continued confirmation.
You weren't necessarily wrong..depends on what your rationale was and what your assessment of the probabilities were.

You were probably wrong, but no one will ever know for sure. That's now how all this works.
and then the bottom falls out and we're in the 5ks
There is a not-small hidden buy wall at 6450
haha
Bitmex futures are zero sum, for every short there is always a long. The ratio is always 1:1. It's not like spot margin trading at all.
There isnt much volume on other exchanges tho. Also on bitmex shorts and longs are always equal.
Before the BGD, I used to post google trends results here (not going to try and find them, but they are in my comments) for search term "bitmex" and the associated terms were usually "short bitcoin."

To me, this was indicative of new shorting interest.

Shorts started piling up, and a few weeks later we got the BGD short squeeze. 

So, yes I personally have been watching this for months and I think you're correct.
> The breakout direction is upward 79% of the time.

Well those are pretty good odds. But it also says it's usually found in a bull market, so I wonder if that brings the odds down at all. 

Edit: it also says to buy on the 3rd touchdown, so did hat just happen at 6107?
Read the description. Typical for bull market, not too high on the list.

We draw here channels, triangles and wedges because they are better in determining direction.
What about this [smaller pattern](https://imgur.com/a/xuyYWu3)
> people think we’re back to a bullmarket now because of SEC

People really think that? Geez...

Edit: I'm not saying we go 50% lower, nor saying that this is the bottom, but we sure aren't in a bull market again c'mon people.
I'm not so sure it will dip so low. I think in 2014/15 there was real uncertainty that Bitcoin would ever pull out of that sub $700 range. Now it seems so much more a given that at least Bitcoin itself is not going away that I would expect at least a slightly softer landing from the bubble pop. 
>	A true bear market don’t end with a V shaped bottom (unless capitulation), more of a stretched out curved bottoms indicating a period of accumulation. We’re getting there, and hopefully it won’t take a whole year. But I wouldn’t mind to be honest.

There’s the possibility though that the stretched out bottom and period of accumulation has been the range that began forming since we first crashed to 6k. Looks a lot like the range that formed when we crashed to $1XX.
Hear, hear!

The crypto market cap hasn't pulled back nearly enough. I criticised Warren Buffett when he responded to the crypto bubble, but I think I understand what he was trying to point at then. The issue isn't with the potential scale, it was with the rate of growth of the whole market. He wasn't even calling for an immediate blow off top. He was just calling the market, as a whole, irrational.

CCs have a long way to drop, and the fat that needs to get trimmed isn't entirely Bitcoin's. Look at the market's reaction to yesterday's  overwhelmingly bearish news. The CC market, as a whole, should have dropped. 50 - 70% of the market is at risk of an SEC crackdown in the next 12 months, and they push forward on the news faster than the asset (Bitcoin) that is most benefited by the news. The CC market is suffering from a delusion; cognitive dissonance abounds.

Lean days are coming.
never trust a 15m bull flag
I got stopped on my short earlier...

Re-entered lower and with a smaller position but will be keeping tight stops on this one. Something smells funny

!long xbtu18 close 6500
I'd put it around 5,800-5,900. 

That's where we had our first bounce when the sell off was going parabolic back in February. 

That range also coincides with the 500 SMA support zone. 
5k.
$5800. Below that... I see bad news. 
6300 . Though I really think that line was already ~6500 out of the flag/triangle
Pretty decent support at $0
6k1
Yeah this feels like the grinding chop that we went through back in April. No Fun Zone ahead.
Could simply be a tilt because of exchanges that don't hold USD trading more alts? If all exchanges traded USD it might look very different. In other words, a reading of the chart is increased liquidity in crypto market thanks to usdt.
I think it's a f-reak'out.
Time to play grampa stocks.

That might be an indication of transfer of funds between coins, not actual price movement. (Edit: This is speculation of course, but I have seen binance coin display counter-trend movements which I think has to do with its use as waypoint coin for people who trade on Binance.)
Yeah when it first hit $2700 people thought it would retrace to $1200ish but it never happened
We'll know what's possible with another severe leg down. Until then, I'd be skeptical. But yeah, a wick to high 4k's is pretty much a foregone conclusion imo.
Hmmm...at that point, (even at current price levels), I think mining would be totally unprofitable. If we drop another 35&#37; like you suggest, miners will certainly need to sell more BTC in order to continue funding their mining operation, which further depresses the price of BTC. Smaller miners will quit, though.

IIRC, miners hold something like 30&#37; of BTC now. Perhaps the bright side is that their selling activities would help to redistribute BTC (assuming there is buying demand from 'regular people'). 
no $4K, but yes most people are expecting $5K
I'm watching the same formation. Breakout point of the flag (previous high) is at around 6.500 (6.550 on bitfinex). Price bounced of that point twice already inside the flag. I'm looking for that support to hold.

Hey man, I totally get it. Being in position can be exhausting mentally, especially underwater. Take the profit, take the breather, and don't worry about the market. You'll trade much better when you return. 
I'd like to see historical PnL per user, as well as like a PnL*Time or something like that. It would be a metric of any trader's performance that includes either number of trades and / or cumulative amount of time (days?) that their positions have been opened. Think like Bitcoin-days-destroyed. Its a lot more meaningful for someone to have, for example, a +30% PnL over 100 trades rather than someone who got lucky with +50% with only one trade.
We just broke the 6.4k support maybe that was a bit too early?
Selling pressure can only last so long. Bears only have so many bitcoins. 
Every dump is answered with buying. I can’t see this breaking down unless it’s done by  whale in seconds. An organic drop’s not going to happen. 
Yeah this is a bear market and looking at all the bull that remains my guess is that it will remain bearish for quite some time.
[deleted]
Where is that support line being drawn from?

The two points of contact I see on GDAX are at $449 and $459 which doesn't touch that line you have drawn.
Bulls don't need hopium.  The facts are clear: Bitcoin made us rich.  It can't fail.  It is indomitable. It can only be suppressed temporarily, and all those who try lose mass amounts of money, giving it to smarter people who see the future. All hail Satoshi.

I'm sorry. I know bears like to think they're gonna get rich shorting Bitcoin to zero, but math and the facts say otherwise.  All the FUD and shorting with billions of dollars that nobody will want in three years won't change that. Sorry.
That fcuker is overbought
Feeling like I wanna go long AF on this chart ;)
Wondering how in the world you decided that 1-BTCUSD was the formula to use. Not that it makes a bit of difference, but 0-BTCUSD would be more accurate.

You on the toilet too?
Friday is American payday and we tend to go up on Fridays.  The BGD back in April was on a Friday evening.  Do your research.
Wasn’t the drop to 165 a flash crash though.
Just bought a significant amount for my hodl stack in addition to the long from 6530 I entered this morning.

We're not going down.  We're going up.  It might take a couple weeks, but meh.
Piercing is all good if you recover strongly immediately. 
Forrest from the trees. Support right now is 6k, resistance is 6900-7k. Everything in between is noise.
Looks legit to me. When charting on a macro scale, I think cutting off some wicks is perfectly reasonable. 
Bulls shouldn't be focused on the short term. That's why I'm just hodling and let all this bloodshed play out. 
I never saw this version of ATH resistance line...

Can't chart it now. /u/sloppysynapses /u/haserfauld is this even real?

Went to downvote and then saw the username.
Was told that there would be no math in bitcoin. 
Eventually you won't even have to chart it. USD won't exist. We'll be charting BTC/sneakers and BTC/flying cars and stuff. 

"USD? Oh that old shitcoin? Hah, it died in 2018 when BTC took over."
[RIP Stokinator](https://i.imgur.com/lxS12ja.png)
delusion is real 
Math is being down 70&#37; after you buy here and it goes down to $2000 while you hold. As long as you're buying on that day instead of selling you're probably good.
You're not wrong. And I look forward to the day. But for now we could be in for some more pain.
Hedge funds don't care about bottoms or getting a lower value. They want returns. They don't put money in an asset that's in a bear market. They will come back as soon as the trend changes. 
seems like it was a bull trap
Yeah it looks pretty nice, volume also fits imo. The problem is i think this range (6.8k - 6.1k) might be chop city, similarily to the 7.2 - 7.8k range. And i am not sure if we can use TA in this range, where stops are tight and orderbooks are thin ....
Why would BTC be leading the bear trend? It's like people expect alts to go up forever without ever stopping but only stop because Bitcoin stops. And sure it's good that ETH is not a security but they are clearly saying many other coins/tokens are securities. If 90% of the apps that are built on Ethereum are securities, where does that leave ETH? The SEC will absolutely go on a witch hunt, many corpses will be dug from the ground and many will just exit scam, close or move away/dump BTC or ETH and enjoy their early pensions. The media will love it. 

It's not like billions are suddenly going to be entering the space because ETH is not declared a security... Everyone is taking this news way too positive. It's good long term because the real shitcoins will hopefully finally disappear but it's going to be bloody.

That single piece of news is very unlikely to start a new bull market. We were already having a technical bounce when the news pump today came, which met heavy resistance on two attempts above 6700.

Almost every time, bad news doesn't matter in a bull market, and good news doesn't matter in a bear market.

If it does, however, ratio bots will drag them up roughly the same with possible divergence of a few percent.
Ever thought of the fact Augur is being launched , is bc theiy are afraid of the SEC?  Because they need to prove their utility soon.

A lot of projects are going to rush now and Its going to be a shit show.  The future does not look bright for ETH imo. 
This is forced and reeks of desperation. Transparent concern trolling.
As a battered bull right now in the thick of it, it's painful to experience.
yea volume's been slowly bleeding out today. Can someone post a volume chart of today/this week? I'm too noob so idk how to do that
This may be a shock to you, but the world is not limited to USA.
kinda weird the SEC/Gioancarlo speak only when btc is sub 6.5k!
A few points: 

People use BTC to buy shit coins which I think drive the price up

ETH might get fuked, it might be safe as a stand alone but it’s the major platform for shit coins and ICO’s

I don’t think the people who invest in these shit coins are actually doing a research and read the news, if they did they wouldn’t buy the shit coins in the first place. This eventually will get them rekt which will drive them out of the crypto world.  I already have a few friends who got burned from random shit coins and they aren’t looking back. We need those normies.

This is good news to BTC but it shed a dark light on the crypto world as a whole. Normies who read this and do not understand the crypto fundamentals will see the crypto world as a scam hive and it might drive them away from investing.

Somehow I believe the scammers will find a new ways to scam, they always do.



This is just my random thoughts and i hope I’m wrong and we’re heading into decentralized utopia.

We just fell below trendline on the shortest timeframe, how is it turning to support. https://www.tradingview.com/x/OomE9wIS/

Folks, you gotta trade what you see, not what you expect, what you believe in. TA isn't some magical tool that gives you free money, it is a tool to give you the confidence that allows you to make an judgement of the market. Maybe the trendline break is a false positive in the chart above, but when enough evidence start pointing in the same direction; it is probabilistic. To list a few intermediate bearish trends, below 20MA, below the lows of the previous low. Retesting 6K support that is just a wick, no consolidation. A bear market with low volume. Eiffel tower pattern and so forth.
how does this get so many upvotes?  
6450 is a hidden buy wall and the candles are clearly forming a descending triangle
That it broke down when it kept going sideways and then dropped below 6500. But we have higher lows so it's still an ascending channel on lower time frames. Now go to the 12H, what does that look like?

> Hydrogen is building the financial Web 3.0. Their blockchain project called Hydro connects financial applications to the public blockchain. With just one API call, smart contracts can be deployed in apps to add decentralized authentication, security, identity management, and machine learning

So we are opening the floodgates for buzzword-salad ICO garbage in here now eh? Hope you're getting paid off in BTC and not a heavy bag of 'Hydro'.
Its difficult, often the BGD have pauses in the middle and you would end up shorting the middle or worse from the BGD.

After it stops, the initial retracement is almost immediate and very hard to catch and you end up losing most of your profits.

I tried this in my bot and failed, hard to predict and time correctly
Should be pretty easy, but you'd have to tell it what percentages constitute a brd/bgd. 

And also, there's not always a bounce after one of those, sometimes its a continuation. 
You could setup a bot to long when it goes 50% outside below the 5 minute BB, and then sell if at least X profit percentage plus other parameters.  Inverse for shorting. (Wouldn't try to long a break up to try to ride further upward momentum, that'd be bag city)

It'd work in chop; all these little failed breakouts we've seen the last couple days.  But if the price starts taking the stairs down or up, it'll be holding bags.
Finex let's up to 3.3x. if you have 6.5k on your margin wallet and buy 1 BTC you use 1x lev and don't pay lending fees, but it lets you move out 60% of your money out, so that you'll be in 3.3x lev Max, that's when you borrow money. Or you borrow when your buy is bigger than what you have in margin wallet.

omg, you made shit trades and lost money and now ant to loose more money with margin trading. 
Yes, use the leverage slider.

I don't think so. We're sitting on our low for the day right now. Under 6450 isn't good. Under 6400 is pretty much confirmation of breakdown.

If you KNOW there's going to be a massive sell-off then the right decision is to sell before, not wait and hope your position improves. There is no "obviously wants to go up".
That's an excellent question that i have no answer for. 
6k7-6k8 was rejected and 6k2 showed good support. 

It will need some consolidation in this range to start to wear one of these level out. 

If the consolidation happens around 6350 there is a good probability that 6k2 will be tested and might break, although until 5k8 there should be good support.

To the upside i have a hard time picking levels besides 6k8-7k. 
I think it's easier to get a BGD to blast through those levels and settle higher (but without shorts piling up its harder this time) than to break 5k8 and settle lower. Breaking lower should trigger harder bounces than breaking higher.
Just trying to explain these weird movements around 6650 with a fake out, a bart attempt that also was stopped and left us testing 6550 for  resistance.

I think bulls got a breath of fresh air yesterday with that pump (allegedly due to good news from SEC) and are trying to defend their ground.


Can confirm, entered the game at 19k, i might actually hold the highscore in this sub :-D.
Is this self deprecating humor? After a quick glance at your post history, I see that you first got into crypto like 5 months ago. Ha. Ain’t nothing wrong with that! 
Normal usually for me is 100% but my risk is never more than a 2% move.
Well, the previous previous bullish MA cross on that chart *did* go up 300 before resuming the dumping...

But the previous one was right before a big dump.
They're useful in any market, that's what they're made for, they show bullish and bearish confluence. 
wtf, exactly now. 
Well looking at this: https://www.omniexplorer.info/address/1NTMakcgVwQpMdGxRQnFKyb3G1FAJysSfz

We see that they have been printing pretty much all of May. And we all know how this went.

Tether printer is broken btw.

My guess is that this money is being used by whales to leverage short the market. Hence the huge BTCUSDSHORTS increase without a squeeze.
I see a red candle there... and next candle only was like 50~70 up
good luck to you too, amigo. no stops for me, will continue adding down to around the $6200's range. 
to be honest in this instance i'm leaning towards upside movement because the bull flag appears to pretty end at the traverse point that in this case i'm thinking maybe we could move up out of it, instead of sliding into it. 

I'm also adding to that that our StochRSI 30 min has just crossed up and has room to breath, along with the 1hr StochRSI. 

I don't believe the break up will be very big however as we have the 2hour slow MA sitting at 6710 and the base of the 2hour cloud sitting roughly at 6850. 

again, this is all just coin toss really 
The big little short.
NordFX even offers a hilarious 1000x:

["The larger the leverage ratio is, the more are the free funds you have!"](https://nordfx.com/349-1-1000-Leverage-Ratio-Freedom-of-Trading.html) 
At that point you can trade like 0.2% moves!
Are you sick?
Thanks, I bet your plans are not that dissimilar. 
If I'm not mistaken, it means that there is data which suggests that bitcoin might be a weak non-correlated asset relative to SPX, meaning it doesn't follow the stock market or vice versa, in fact it does the opposite (to a small extent). Investors like non-correlated assets because they can be used to reduce their exposure to risks in the stock market by diversifying with assets that have a negative correlation, so potentially bitcoin. (Given bitcoin's volatility, I know it sounds crazy to think of bitcoin as a diversification tactic to reduce risk, but I believe that's what the data suggests)

edit: some words

~~Edit: oh, according to /u/hotsoccerman's explanation I think I've misinterpreted it.  It's just correlation strength its self, not anything about if a correlation direction is inverse or not, so some of what I wrote under this is probably garbage, but I'll leave it since the potential conclusion I stated might provoke an interesting thought in someone.~~ 

-----------------------------------------------------------------

I think he is saying that *if* the stock market and crypto are related, they are inversely related, and more severely than gold and the stock market's relation.

A possible extrapolation from that is that gold took a big hit in the previous stock crash (no assests were a safe haven), but during the recovery phase gold quickly entered its next bubble (someone here said that earlier today).  So if the stock market has a multi year bear market on the horizon, when it ends, you could expect BTC to explode.

But that's an extrapolation on an extrapolation on a...

Thank you! I’ll do some research this weekend. Cheers 
Do you keep significant funds on it? Scare the crap out of me so much that I still use kraken..... 
I agree that we likely haven't seen the bottom yet. However, I don't see it as unlikely that $4k-ish is the bottom. That would put us on par with &#37; from ATH compared to previous crash patterns, and would give us a pretty strong correction from last year's FOMO fest. I doubt whales and miners would want the price to drop significantly below that, considering they would lose out on their investments. But who knows? This could drag on seemingly forever, especially if government regulation/Mt. Gox continues to loom overhead.
We've also got an interesting IH&S on BTCUSDSHORTS lol: https://www.tradingview.com/x/mHe7cSvO/

But we are at 31634:26963, which is wider than it's been in a while.

Speaking of absurd IH&S calls, how about this one on the 5m ;)

https://www.tradingview.com/x/KLgCp551/  

...this is just me passing the time.
It's the repeating pattern since the drop from 9K, no follow through on any pump. Buyers at 7499 but not at 7501 and eventually it collapsed. Same thing with 6600 yesterday.
Wait another 10 and voila... Profit ;-)
Recyclops destroy!!

Patterns and created by your imagination

The facts are most here said we were about to fly using lines on a chart to back it up... And then what happened 

But it seems you agree that TA is pretty useless if you can't rely on it, which is what your comment is saying effectively, so why not use random chance? If it only works 'sometimes' it's like astrology and clustering illusion. 

Which is what TA really is, I point you to Massey University's comprehensive study showing how TA produces results aligned with random chance.
I’m not saying all TA is bs, but working “sometimes” is how astrology and other false things work.  Random things cluster also.

Someone should bring out a study in to media manipulation and the suppression in the bitcoin price with bullshit headlines and non-stories. 
Nicely done, I enjoyed reading your commentary and agree!

I thought you were joking, but that's not a 5min chart. It's super wonky though. Target would be above 7500. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/umCcZS6m/
Lines holding up surprisingly well. Really hoping we break up here. Would love to have a short opportunity in high 6000s
There was a hidden buy wall at 6450. Ate up a couple hundred BTC on BFX. Pretty interesting. I wonder if it would hold another attempt. 
My butt clenching on eth is over for now. Stops at breakeven (510). Been a stressfull day because i rushed into a position. 

If 500 falls btc will be dragged along no? Ltc is also below support.

Firstly I'm going to say i have a bullish bias in this case. Also the chart ended up becoming quite messy.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/h6XHxoEu/

the magenta lines are major legs and the horizontal lines mark the range of the last major leg (passing these points will continue either the move up from the low or the move down from the high).

Two triangle like things are marked, the current break and previous similar break. 

The black lines (ignore abc) are to generally highlight how bullish that recent price action looks (at least to me.)

Tbh that is a flag now. Those tend to break wrong way lately but it's a flag ;-)
There is a point where people will say 'screw this, it's not possible to go any lower' and we're gonna get a BGD up our assess.

Not saying it's now. The lower we get the bigger possibility it'll happen.
Just want to clear your "checked":

- Interest is down due to the price is down, it does not lead the price. 2013 to 2016, interest is down, but 2017 people 's interest about btc is up. Why? Cause btc price was going up. <unchecked>
- Low volume also means that less selling pressure. Actually low volume when price decreasing and higher volume when price increasing is a good sign of bottom <unchecked>
- Everyone knew BTC was not a security, but S.E.C never confirmed that before. So at least people do not need to worry about unexpected event when suddenly somehow S.E.C makes it as security.<unchecked>
- It was 6% increased from 6350 to 6736. If we counted from the bottom 6107, it is 10.2%, high enough, comparing with other weak bounce from the past which are only 4-5% <unchecked>
- Lel, last time when we were at $5000, we are bullish af, $1200 also bullish af, and before that ... <unchecked>
We didn't drop last few weeks. We dropped last 6 months....... So time for a change
Noob here. What is the obvious answer?
Saw that. Stopped dead in its tracks.
Isn't the very idea of a hidden wall not be able to to tell how small/big it is?
Not what I was asking.
I know how bitmex works.

I was wondering if all those noobs moved there as I it got biggest volume spike on bear market.

Even low volume exchange would be better than having only one data point which cut off bigger part of users.
Yeah, but if all of them moved to Mex then they're just getting wrecked. Mex does not lead the market. At least I didn't notice that it is leading. Futures are messed up lately but if all the noobs are there then there's an explanation.

Was wondering if finex ratio is actually market wide ratio.
Last bull market saw all the rising wedge break up ;-)
you can argue its a bull or bear market depending on the timescale you are looking at.
Check the examples, these markets do also not look like a typtical Bull Markets.

Here [https://www.tradermentality.com/2016/02/descending-broadening-wedge.html](https://www.tradermentality.com/2016/02/descending-broadening-wedge.html) it is not mentioned that they are typical in bull markets, just that it is a bullish reversal pattern.

But even if the pattern plays out, you never know how long we will follow it. We could go down to 3k with the pattern and than pop up. ;) But from the examples these patterns never unfold in such a great trading range.
How is anything in that random line drawing a pattern?

Exactly this...
Wait a minute now, are you trying to say a speculative market that goes from $176 billion to $840 billion in 2 months is irrational? How dare you sir!

Also, welcome back YRuafraid, been awhile. 
Where is this idea of SEC regulations being some sort of an apocalyptic market crashing thing comes from? Majority of 'compliant' US traders are on Coinbase and Gemini neither of which offer alts; most ICOs already bar US citizens from investing; and vast majority of altcoin trading comes from exchanges based somewhere far away from SEC. It's not as if SEC deciding to 'regulate' altcoin trading in some crazy ways would be setting a precedent for other countries to follow either -- major markets EU and Asia (sans China, but then they seem to be coming around, too) have stated multiple times to be 'pro-crypto' and have showed no interest in restricting cryptocurrency trading in any way. 

Worst case scenario would be some quick manipulated dumpage alongside a bunch of FUDdy articles, but it's not as if whatever SEC decides is going to actually affect what the Bitfinex whales or Wolves of Binance do mid/long-term. 

If Bitcoin continues to range sideways / bleed for the next 6-12-24 months, I am 100% confident we won't see any kind of 'fat trimming' in the altcoin markets, quite the opposite in fact. The more boring and slow Bitcoin becomes, the more will money flock towards alts. 
I think you are overestimating the importance of the SEC, most of the market participants are not from the US and neither are the largest exchanges.
It was more about the whole movement since yesterday. Back to hedging :)
I don't like this movement either. Got a bit screwed on last 24h movement.
That short is a hedge... I'm up like 10% on my BTC stack the past couple of days.

Yeah you could almost simultaneously go long and short with enough margin to cover 6100~7000 and probably close both in profit sometime in the next few days of chop.

Until the floor/ceiling breaks and you get rekt.
the problem is that when you YOLO in a bear market after a move up, its very easy to get fucked. Thats why the price of BTC is dropping. The same people who were waiting for a paycheck to come in just so they could buy more at $7,100. Are now sitting on their hands at $6,500 because they are now waiting for $6,100 again
I think we need options or earnings reports to justify wsb-level YOLOing.

Bort
but Bitcoin doesn't appear affected.
Likely paranoia about ETH futures.
The thing that worries me is that this is a textbook bull flag. Descending slope, vanishing volume as we develop further. We've just had volume increase. If this won't break up soon I'll call for a fake...
Yeah, even so i'll kick myself in the butt tomorrow if this dumps big time.

So, go bulls :)

Probably, but i had already set limit orders. I'm tired and really need some sleep.
Made almost 50% profit on my stack this week (even so i am still in the red since i started) so i don't want to push my luck. Almost wiped half those gains yesterday in a matter of minutes...
Do you mean the 6.5k support? We're sitting on 6.4k support currently.
Problem is you have lots of people taking profits and opening new shorts
I have more bitcoins than I've ever had :P 
Very funny and all. Meanwhile we're slipping and slipping down.
Well except we are 40% down from a few weeks ago...wouldn't say every dump is met with much buying 
Comments like this are getting tiresome... I swear I see this shit after every pump, where bulls express their hopium, and after every dump where bears express that they were right and you were wrong. Always someone saying Bulls/bears out in full force, telling me the market still has plenty of room to fall/pump. It’s become a meme at this point - a meme with 0 merit to it. 
Wait what really?!

e: read your comment wrong lol 
Sorry about that. Had to zoom out. Using the candle bodies off the 2 recent lows on the hourly. Will it hold? Maybe, maybe not. Just observation since IMO BTC could be following ETH given the news from yesterday and where we are now. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/omvBAzxU/
You sound like you're part of some cult:

- "the facts are clear"
- "it can't fail"
- "it is indomitable"
- "it can only be suppressed temporarily"

Have you not understood yet that nothing is guaranteed?
Soon I need to when we crash below 6k
The BGD was on a Thursday morning in the US.
I sold at 166. Proud to have panic sold at the absolute bottom...
yes. It hovered around $300 most of that year I think. Which would be the equivalent of like $5200 for us. 

Really, right now shit looks worse than 2014 in terms of (rate of decrease) for % of ATH
Just the tip.
That's some major wick cuttage. I don't buy that
The volume profile doesn't fit and suggests the triangle breakdown. 

I mean really think of the psychology of it all. the reason $7k break was significant was because everyone knew it was the last stand for a higher low 
BTC/Pizza will just be a vertical line down because of that one stupid wick from way back when
>"USD? Oh that old shitcoin? Hah, it died in 2018 when BTC took over."

!remindme 1 year
USD may not exist, but they'll just make "New USD or NUSD" or some shit lol
I'm pretty sure he closed it for a small loss at $6600 or smth 
Target of this BF should be around 6.8. So even breaking up may stop on resistance.

EDIT: and so it broke up as I wrote this :)
The market is so retarded right now that the securities shit coins pumped on the news
Absolutely, a crack down on shitcoins will panic the entire market, at least in the short term.

Obviously in the long term it's very positive in that a lot of shitcoin money will potentially end up in BTC.
[deleted]
why would you jump to the conclusion he's concern trolling, he's probably just concerned.  Any good trader is.


[deleted]
Don't have a chart but I do stare at daily volume religiously and it basically has dropped by 50% from yesterday's pump
[deleted]
This may be a shock to you, but your government doesn't matter, US agencies are way more important.

(1) US and Korea are most invested/active in crypto (2) Most of BTC/fiat trade is BTC/USD, not BTC/your_not_limited_XYZ and US banks control USD flows. (3) There are other obvious reasons.

P.S. Just in case, I am NOT from US.

Most shitcoins are not based in the USA. They cant care less about what the SEC says, they have no plans for listing on any US exchange. Binance, Huobi and the likes will always provide them a platform to continue their trading. 
> People use BTC to buy shit coins which I think drive the price up

Yes, shitcoin speculation and pump&dumps is a big use case for BTC.


>  Eiffel tower pattern and so forth.

Are you talking about the push to $20k? Or what. Is this just another name for a blow-off top?
When we start to see lots of Eiffel towers in a bear market I start to expect longs to be double penetrated by market sellers and margin calls on other longs.
Like a rsi cooloff before another dump, nothing looks promising here.
Glad I kept that long open!
Bought ETH at 485, sold 50% at 518 and was going to wait on selling the other half, but I'll let it ride for a bit
Ah I see. Follow up question: Isn't the pro version of TV embeded in bitfinex? Can I do this there?

To make it dynamic you can use standard deviations away from a mean, which BB does already.
From the recent days I would say at least a $100 price move within 3 minutes is a solid dildo.
> But if the price starts taking the stairs down or up, it'll be holding bags.

We love bags, don't we.
I see, thank you!
Lose or win; depending on my bets. ;-) On Bitfinex I can at least bet on the price going down. On Binance I can only wait for the prise to go up, which did not happen a lot last few weeks.
Tbh it's hard to long in bear market.

But yeah, people get screwed by longing fakeouts. If they don't get that they should go on a bounce they'll lose money either way.
There's no slider on finex. You talking about Mex?
It is when you're not actually trading bitcoin and are just trying to manipulate a trading forum in vain.
It has worked very well recently.
> and here we are with the reversal happening earlier than expected because of those people 

I see no reversal of the bear trend which we have been enduring all year. Are you looking at 1m charts? 
- "and here we are with the reversal happening earlier than expected because of those people"

umm... Ok... not to be sound like a dick here but what on Earth are you looking at to suggest a reversal of the bear market?!

Sorry, should have provided a bit more analysis to my posting. I saw it coming since we were experiencing quite a bit of resistance at 506 on ETH I didn't think we'd have enough power for a leg up on the flag.

The two sides of the same medal.
Stop hunting followed by panic trading. Those wicks don't have follow ups in either direction.

Don't like this market now. I really need to start trading those $100 wicks.
I think $6300 is next if this breaks through support. However, there were some pretty big buys around $6100, so I'm still expecting some choppy/bart movements in the short term before we resume dumping. Guess we'll see though.
*We are going down? What's the news?*


I didn't say I KNOW there will be a sell off, but think about how many ICO's didn't expect the comments about them being securities.

How many will give up, throw the towel in and just disappear after selling the funds raised.

Not a guarantee but it could very well happen.

And as soon as we see a small rise in price it dumps back down, a lot more BTC are being sold to dump the price than the amount needed to increase the price.
And I thought my 16800 was bad :))
Ouch.. there's a fair chance that could be the case!
Still in the fight
Pretty much, don't really understand the downvote brigade on this one.
Above poster is right in the sense that Ichimoku works best in a trending environment.

Which is why you really want the bullish TK cross above the cloud and lagging price above as well.
Well for the price to go higher, people need to buy.

Indicators are just lines on a graph, they don't buy coins.

Sounds more like gambling.
interesting. What makes you feel like we won't go into at least the $5Ks? This downward trend is strong or are you just scalping for another quick bounce
Sarcasm dude
I'm also watching the daily: https://www.tradingview.com/x/uKUj9w6G/

We spent 7 days outside that channel, so I don't think it holds that much water, but the top of that channel lines up roughly with my targets (6700-6800).

I fear I'll be sitting here waiting for an entry until the next bull run, though. 
This is a fantastic—and accurate—answer. 

I would recommend that Folks check out CAPM and modern portfolio theory to see how low- or negative-correlated assets are used to diversify and protect investors against diversifiable risk. 
I believe there is indeed a weak negative correlation per:

Correlation

Correlation amongst assets is the degree to which they move in tandem. The values range between -1 and +1, where a value of -1 means that the returns move in opposite directions (e.g. BTC up 0.2% and ETH down -0.2%) and a value of +1 means the returns move in the same direction (e.g. BTC up 0.2% and ETH up 0.2%). A value of zero denotes no (linear) dependence between the assets. The results can be interpreted as follows:

0.5 to 1: Strong positive relationship

0.3 to 0.5: Moderate positive relationship

0.1 to 0.3: Weak positive relationship

-0.1 to 0.1: No linear relationship [Gold: -.09]

-0.1 to -0.3: Weak negative relationship [BTC: -.17]

-0.3 to -0.5: Moderate negative relationship

-0.5 to -1.0: Strong negative relationship
bad bot

Haha. *This* damn bot.
Cock sucker 
yea afaik it's one of the most trustworthy exchanges, the engine just sucks lately. 

I didn't use to have a lot on it...now I have a bit more lol 
Yeah i think maybe 5k or 4.5k will be bottom. The bottom and tops of markets are at points beyond where people are comfortable or believe the market will go, and I think 6k is not bottom based on that. Mt Gox dumping too could drop us a LOT. Following up my previous point though about volume, now that the initial "Shock" of dropping into the 6's is over, volume is back to 5k on the daily. Yes we have 5 more hours to go but volume is already dropping. I think the volume we did see the past few days was stop losses, stop limit buys, and just people adding who think this is the bottom. A few whales start dumping and we start to tank. 
IHS on shorts? Lol. I really don't believe in TA on positions.

That 5m have a target like what? $75? ;-)
Agreed. I just thought that they may get some confidence.

This no follow up is a case since the first top of 11.7, we barely made it to 11.7 again.
$7800+ actually is where I would reassess the validity of an impending breakdown and my bearishness. would break a big sweat at $7150+ 

$6850+ and I'd break a small sweat :P but usually when I break a small sweat, I sometimes add because it's usually a good time in the end. 

but I've sweat before. 😅 
I think >6700 and <6400. Problem is, waiting to long over 6700 doesn't give you much room till 6800-6850, where I'd look to bail on leverage. <6400 is likely to bounce to at least 6400-6450, but again not a guarantee. It really is a crappy place to try to trade. 

I just chose to open small with the trend (short) and be ready to add on the way up 
Open a chart, there is patterns , patterns is human behaviour voting with money.  

Let's assume the counter position instead then, no patterns or behaviour at ALL in the markets?

The volatility was way higher end of December to February though. More gains to be made :D
I was joking about the IH&S on the 5m chart that ironically did complete before instantly retracing: https://www.tradingview.com/x/KLgCp551/

That was the joke. The 4H one is not a joke, though it's also got a ways to go before the potential completion move. The more sideways chop in this range, the more invalidated it becomes.
Hmm... I'm showing the line broken... I think best case we edge up the bottom side towards $6600 again before it drops.  

I don't think this going to gutter hard right here however... there's a nice V shape on the 4 hr... I think low side will be $6400 range before it attempts another leg up.. or simply range sideways for a bit.


How does a hidden wall work? Is out a bot that just suddenly puts a huge order in right before a targeted price? I mean otherwise you'd be able to see it on the depth chart not?
They're closely related so one dumping will be followed by the other. Eth crashing is a huge warning flag for BTC the last two weeks. That said, we've been over and under 500 often recently so I see no reason why that's a special cut-off.
it's an interesting little pattern. At least it's not barty!
We haven't dropped for the last 6 months. We've been ranging for 4. We dropped in 2 months and haven't made a new low since. 

Also, why time for a change? Just because?
down -> ranging consolidation -> down

could be the ultimate fakeout tho 😅
Yeah, but I mean you kind of generally assume it's big, otherwise what's the point. 

If 250 btc is sold into a hidden wall you start wondering is there 1 btc left? Or is that thing like 900 btc. 
'The chart pattern acts as a reversal of the prevailing price trend 55% of the time.'

'Overall performance rank for up/down breakouts (1 is best): 12 out of 23; 11 out of 21'

You can also toss a coin ;)
I was talking about the symmetrical triangle. 

The other lines are from an old descending wedge that i'm keeping in my chart for now

Edit: The apex of that symmetrical triangle is 6550... 
That sub is a clown party and always has been.
There's no one left here other than whales, bots and scalpers. What the little people think or feel is irrelevant.
There's certainly nano holders and others that like to talk shit about Bitcoin now, but I get the sense they're mostly small fries who got involved within last year (edit: besides bch folks, leaving them as different category). I mean now we get news about Fidelity opening a trading desk or actual exchange, Goldman Sachs owned companies buying exchanges and applying for banking licenses, fucking William Shatner starting a solar powered Bitcoin mine. This level of enthusiasm from mainstream financial companies, celebrities, etc simply did not exist three years ago. 
fuckin-a. Some of these comments I've been getting, right?
I think that over time it will become more difficult for people to buy certain alts due to regulations. The prospect of this occurring, and it happening itself will each reduce demand. Not all, but a non-zero quantity of countries will take a cue from the US and implement similar regulations. I believe we'll look back at this time as the wild west and talk about how it was *insane* that we could buy and sell random alts (that had gone through almost no vetting) WITH LEVERAGE, ON MARGIN!
You've changed my argument. I'm not arguing that regulations are apocalyptic. Try reading what I wrote again and consider the argument I'm making this time.
I still think though it's going to create a big divide in the alts.  One set will have a huge limitation that the other set doesn't.
I don't think you're responding to the substance of my argument. I'm not saying that SEC regulations doom a market. I'm saying that the market is irrational. The way alts responded to yesterday's news is an illustration of that.

Your comment perfectly illustrates something I was actually talking about, though; cognitive dissonance.
it'll probably just chop around $6.3-6.9 for a week 
Wasn't he shorting the bottom the other day at like 62xx? Or am I thinking of someone else...
Sure if we get above 11.8k.
Or a shakeout
There you go, maybe San Junipero? We are all in a coma and this is all going on in an alternate universe? 
WE NEED MORE BORT LICENSE PLATES IN THE GIFT SHOP. I REPEAT, WE ARE SOLD OUT OF BORT LICENSE PLATES
More like a bort shin
Interestingly enough, no, it doesn't. ETH just retraced 61.8% of the yesterdays spike, and is just now staging a little bounce from that point. BTC retraced no more than 50%. But ETH gained more % in the rally yesterday. 

EDIT: The  61.8% retrace of ether (where I just caught a knife right by the handle, watching it closely) is right at the breakout point of it's bull flag, so I wouldn't consider that flag broken just yet. Again, pointing it out here because I think it can have an effect on BTC's price movement.
Was about to preemptively close a btc long upon seeing eth, glad I didn't (glad for now...)
yet.
Worries you as in: "Paint ze bull flag"?
That only shows their history of positions but doesn't really easily tell you their overall performance or success rate nor does it give any weight to cumulative time spent in position.
Oh, yes. Didn't realize that existed. Only additional thing I would like to see is a time-weighted metric of PnL. I'll play with the data later this weekend, hopefully.
Also broken hodlers which lowered their selling point 
I’ve been short from 6600. Hate this waiting game but then again I guess it’s also what makes it kind of addicting, that anticipation. No matter what the TA is telling you, what other people are saying, or what your gut feels, you still just never know. 
Oh, I was referring to pretty much the last 5 hours. 
Hum ok. Thanks for sharing
Ahh gotcha, thanks for clarifying. 

ATH was 1170 in 2013 and the 2014 price of 200 was only 17&#37; of that. In 2017 the ATH was 20000 and we are now at 31&#37; of that. So no,  BTC did not fall nearly as much from ATH yet this time (and I doubt it will fall that much more).
But we aren’t hovering around $5200. Which you said would be the equivalent of the $300 dollar price. Doesn’t sound worse to me. 
I meant that I never tried to cut the daily wick on ATH.
how long were we down there, an hour?
I was asking about ATH resistance, not the triangle itself.
Interesting point about the volume profile. I hadn’t even thought to check that yet, considering it was a brand new idea. Again, I consider this model highly unlikely, but figured it was worth sharing just in case.

NewSD
it will be pegged 1:1 satoshi and printed to pump/resurrect the USD.
Still quite ironic. the whole situation xD

btw, do you ever come on the slack live chat, sloppy?

I double dip there and here sometimes
Bouncing off channel support at $6530 so far.
Struggling to...
There is FOMO into ETH?  Are we looking at the same chart?
My bad. Is he a well established Bitcoin trader that posts here often?
I think there's a difference between the party being over, and the house burning down. If this goes deep into goblin town, it'd likely have a permanent impact on the entire space. I'm curious though to know your general expectations, though - clearly you're bearish but I don't know at all to what extent.
>You may be surprised to learn they pretty much follow what the United States does with regulating currency

Not in regards of Security Regulation tho, thats pretty much only a U.S. Thing isnt it?

I do sympathise with the Point adun makes: World > US  in this market and time more than ever imo.
>they pretty much follow what the United States does with regulating currency

You mean like the BitLicense, which has been replicated precisely nowhere? 

Monetary policy across the globe does not simply reflect that of the United States, that in itself is an insular approach to international economic policy 
Oh really?! You think China, Russia and EU follow US into every lunacy Trump administration cooks up?! Truly, no President of the United States have embodied US policies as much as Trump. You keep thinking that countries all over the world will bend over to US dollar and monetary policies. Check out US national debt.
> your government doesn't matter

You really think in the world stage that the Iranian gov't doesn't matter?

Agree though that east asia is the biggest player for crypto.
If you think crypto is about USD and banks, you are in for a bigger shock than this dude. And US us is breaking down under the weight of the very same agencies that always seems to assume they have to be everywhere in the world. Just wait until the next global economic crash and find out, it's right on the next corner.
Rest of the world might follow USA or at least part of it. Also a lot of the buyers are from USA which this will have some effect on them although they are retarded(i assume that because they buy random shit coins) so I doubt it

Edit: Grammer
Right, but potential buyers care.
How do you say Goblin Town in french?
Careful. My spider senses are tingling.
Not sure don't use bfx :/ sorry mate 
Yes, and to detect an incoming BGD I would buy when price moved X amount of $ in 30 seconds, I used X anywhere from $30 to $50
So much that I've still got mine... was gonna let it go yesterday but it's up a couple percent and on the off chance this starts climbing up that would really hurt to sell the bottom.  Got my finger on the trigger.
Just watch out, moving from longing the top to shorting the bottom isn't great... Short the bounce, not the break.
Indeed, can't find a slider. It looks like 3.3x is standard, no change possible.
meant mex, nvm
Well we got rejected at the bull flag resistance and went on to destroy 2 key support in 5 minutes. I'm gonna have to pass on that.
With a currency, value is the only thing that matters. In this case the price determines the value. So... if you don't have interest in the price, it's all pointless.
Just wondering what's your average overall entry.  I know you are an old timer, so your idea of hold is a lot different than someone that just entered last year.
Facts
some of it does actually

http://www.thepatternsite.com
Someone at GS sneezed and his snot was reddish in color! SELL SELL SELL!
not so fast, we are holding up.
SEC said BTC and ETH aren't securities. Pretty bearish obviously 
I honestly thought you were being serious at first until I glanced over your posts lol. There really are some users (4chan frequenters) who act that way in a serious manner.
No, Ichi works in any market, when it's not trending it's just not as strong, but you can say that of a lot of indicators.

The problem with OPs reading is that even though that is indeed a bullish TK cross it's happening under the kumo which is a weak cross. That means that you can basically disregard it or it's a very risky long entry.

[Here is a quick read](http://www.kumotrader.com/ichimoku_wiki/index.php?title=Ichimoku_trading_strategies) 
Thank you
> Indicators are just lines on a graph, they don't buy coins.

You know what indicators on a chart represent right?
I know it's shocking but people buy in bear markets and at key levels, I'm not saying we're going parabolic.  You think markets just go straight down or straight up because people are buying or not buying? 
that is totally fair criticism 
even if we go below $6k, the chances we never see $6k again after going below it are pretty slim. As long as he's got some cash ready to go down lower he could at least break even or make a decent profit
I think going into the $5K's is possible but my guess is that we'll see around $6800 first which is where I'll hopefully exit depending on how we get there. 
the information would be 1 tether = 1..25 usd because only this price reserved for the insiders. or can be a triple bullish bottom ..
Sorry then :)
True, in the 7K range I kept waiting for a 7.7-7.8 entry and had to jump in at 7.4 and add at 7.3 which felt rushed and ended up being my biggest profit to date. But we spent almost 2 weeks in that range.
Thanks bud, appreciate the kind words. 
Ah cool, so I wans't far off after all.

Man, had to reread all this like 5 times, too many layers of logic for my tired brain.
I bet you do!

Maybe I'll give it a shot. Been considering some more active trades, & kraken suuuucckkks. 
You know, you can add leverage to your short and move some funds from there.
lol the 5m IH&S completed for a minute.
Neither one was serious, I hope that was obvious lol

This is the only *potential* I'm watching: https://www.tradingview.com/x/t5ERHFRa/
Same here, I went short at 6600 and then closed at BE thinking maybe this time we'd have momentum but alas, sad bulls again.
problem is, the longer a trend goes on, the more likly it reverses
Oh I got it, I mean, there's always someone posting a H&S on a 1min chart here.

But on the serious one, yeah, a violent upwards move would invalidate it, sideways chop like you said or a brutal below 6300 drop. So it has a lot to overcome, but def something to keep an eye out for.
On some exchanges, you can request your order not show in the depth chart or on the books. You can't only tell they're there if you're seeing huge market orders go through without the order books dropping accordingly. 
... Yet
What confuses me is the pump on good news. But I closed my long on break even.
[deleted]
You're saying that you expect SEC regulations to cause a major hit to crypto market caps and that there's a long way to drop -- when total marketcap is already nearly 4 times below the high. For comparison, the bottom of 2015 was a drop from 15b to around 3.5b, in a market that had far less overall interest in altcoins. So, you seem to be claiming this correction will go on to be more severe than the depths of the last one were -- how have I changed your argument?
Overall, it will impact confidence, too.
I didn't respond that part of your argument because I was not interested. Is it not allowed to respond only to the parts that interest me? 

Anyway, of course the market is irrational, in no rational market would worthless tokens be valued in the hundreds of millions, but they are worthless whether the SEC considers them securities or not. You'd be surprised how many market participants are aware of it and just treat them as a form of gambling.
Once again got screwed by this. Short/long the bounce, not a break. Was close to flip when it stopped at 6620, got distracted. At least mex didn't screw up and I cached hedge entry.
I had two shorts with CA around 6.7 and closed them at 6.6 yesterday.
That's what you would wait for to validate and take a position?
A non-committal makeout

...per version 1.0.4 of the Mormon Dating Protocol Framework.
It's a shakout of the fakeout of the breakout.
Are you talking to me? No, my son is also named Bort!

r/TheSimpsons is leaking lol
Oh nasty.

Bort rhymes with short.  That's the best TA I've got for now.
ETH usually gains more than BTC when it goes up and loses more when it goes down.
This is very strange, ltc is also dipping.
That dildo on eth yesterday messed everyone up. 
More like 'no follow-up'. We're in a bear trend, we got news that ignited some fomo but this may not be enough to reverse the trend even short-term. We need follow-up that will give confidence to buyers to push it up. Without a follow-up this will just slowly bleed.
It didnt exist, made it this morning
;) 
How would you calculate this time-weighted metric of PnL?
Ah okay i think he was referring to the last month of pumps 
Not yet, but in terms of rate of decrease we're technically at a lower point than 2014 was right now. Of course if we shoot up from here that won't really matter, but right now 2014 was hovering at what would be $9-11.7k for us

If you go look at the 2014 charts, it double topped in the summer in the same way we double topped a month or two ago, whenever it was 
2014 didn't hit $5200 until like August/September, and it's midway through June. Of course we may not go down, but if we do, we will have moved downwards significantly quicker than 2014 did. 

2014 was double topping at our equivalent of $11.7k right now in terms of days after ATH 
Hrm... well...  lines just illustrate regions of resistance/support. A lot of people are saying they diagonals aren't even that relevant. When the market is oversold or over bought it can remain that way for hours, too.

I think I buy this as a **possible** interpretation.
I usually include wicks in my trendline drawings for consistency. However, there appears to be no consensus on whether to include wicks or not in the trading community. Considering the nasty wick on the February dip, I was curious what the trend would look like with the wicks cut. I came across this trend by chance, and figured I would share it considering it’s a bit interesting.
oh I see. Imo changing lines like this is what makes TA useless lol 
Yea no worries, not bagging on you. I've tried charting without wicks before too. The higher volume at the end of a wedge downwards suggests it's not going to break up at least not like a normal wedge 
if that was the break up attempt...well...the bulls are weaker than I thought 
there was a good 2 hours of FOMO and then it died. lol
burden of proof is on you, not him.  He provided insight and information.  You called him names and made baseless accusations.



If the US didn't have the largest piece of the global economic pie, then "only being a US thing" would mean more.  We ain't talking about Belarus or something.

I think he was generalizing, doubt it that he knows I'm from Iran.

Paris?
Do you have skype or discord? I would love to chat and exchange a little bit, I am a developer and maybe we can figure something out to make it work
3.3x is the max, if you are used to bitmex it's like you are always on "cross".
Being interested in the value doesn't mean you're interested in trading. The two are not the same. Furthermore, restricting the supply (hodling) is what causes the price to go up. So /u/L14dy is doing his part to support price increase, potentially more-so than traders who dump on the market to make short term profits. 
You forget that this currency is a github repo though. I’m more interested in the github repo than the price at this point
[deleted]
I dont know exactly.

I would say sub 100, but it could be sub 10

I had a bunch of coins I either lost or spent along the way, and then bought coins every day, week and month during the last bear market... as high as 600 and as low as 200

Once it started going up again, I stopped buying every day and just bought once a month until 1750 usd/BTC. Stopped buying there... bought like 5k worth of BTC to take down the 17250 wall for fun.

If you consider/count the fact that I sold at 13k and bought back at 8k, I have the same amount of coins as I always did and got all my fiat back and then some, so basically 0
Sell sell sell... Good bye... Bye? Buy? Buy buy buy!
I understand it's a weak cross, I was just pointing out a confluence of factors that could pump us up some. 
Thanks for the link. I'll check that out.

I was under the impression that Ichimoku works best when the market has picked an overall direction. This is the same as saying it works best when the lower level time frames are giving a valid signal, given that the whole point of the system is to show the trend. If the bullish TK cross is occurring under the cloud, it means that slower moving trend is still down (below 50%). 
Is this a real question or a passive aggressive comment?
Of course not. I'm thinking in terms of probabilities.

More support will be broken than resistance in bear market. The inverse is bull market. So I'll be betting on downward movement. 

Good luck with your trades
We didn't see 7k since we broke down. We may see 6k after we break down, but there was a big bounce from 6.1 already. This may drop to mid 5k and not bounce higher that 6.1.

Gambling here with a long that may set you up for add if this reverses isn't so stupid, hoping we're gonna bounce to 6.8 while we didn't see 6.7 break after the drop may get you rekt.
Got it. Good luck!
oh so people are waiting for the tether bounce? 
no problem :)
Unfortunately, I didn't re-evaluate charts until this morning, and I would have taken at least an initial entry at 6600 had I done so. Oh well. Seems to be breaking down here.
haha yeah man. I think what this is saying is that if the stock market goes down 10%, then bitcoin goes up like 2%, which if true over a longer time period would actually be pretty exciting. So while the data  appears to suggest an inverse relationship, the strength of that relationship is weak. (We are a -.17, but if we were a -1.0 then it would be stock market down 10%, BTC up 10%)
but I can't do that if I haven't realized any profits, right?
TBH they usually work, it's just the target is actually noise ;-)
I know it wasn't serious.

Didn't see that one. This is concerning actually. Should put us on 7k if it breaks up.

Only thing that actually worries me is that there is a bottom somewhere. The lower we go the harder it is to short. If this plays like 2014 we may hover above 5k for a long time before it reverses. Besides, chewy is talking catastrophic. That was always good indicator of near bottom ;-)
I see people saying this a lot lately without realizing the irony :P 
Oh I see. I only trade on gdax so I don't have that feature. Thanks!
It's possible the good news just catalyzed a bounce that was inevitable. We've gone very far down over the past few weeks 
Until you want to move fiat in and out, right?  Or is there a solution for that now?
Why then do all of them currently have such abysmal liquidity? No one has got it right. So far...
> Ever heard of DEX (decentralized exchanges)?

Yes

>You think majority will still trade on centralized exchanges in a few years

I don't know, but I personally wouldn't assume that it will happen

> the biggest liquidity pool ever?

I hope you're right! But right now, I'm not seeing it happening. Maybe if the demand for alts becomes so high once they are removed from trading platforms people will move to DEX? Again, I wouldn't bet on it personally. 
But wouldn't any new ICO style alt that has to obey regulation have *increased* confidence?

I would worry more about the govt limiting participation to the same elite club that can participate in IPO, and taking the layman out of the picture.  (not sure if this limitation is actually a thing or not)
Lol, you literally change my argument, say my thoughts aren't interesting, then spend another paragraph confirming what I already said.
yeah it pretty much takes a week to recharge for any big move lately and you can almost always get a better entry. 

Also you were like what 40% long? Not a big deal...
My apologies then. 
I mean I'll be bought in well before then. That's just when the triple bottom pattern is confirmed, until then it's squiggles.
That's what would confirm a supposed "triple bottom" pattern. I'll be bullish over 10k though.
You guys should make out 
Classic!
Think maybe I should jump on the "alts are in trouble" bandwagon and cash them out.  But too afraid to sell the bottom to do that.
ALTS back to bleeding for 12 hours already, even non "security" ones.
You're an awesome developer. Thanks. 
Not completely sure. I want to play with the numbers a bit to see what makes sense. The idea is that (as an example) an 8% PnL with 50 days of exposure would outweigh an 8% PnL of 1 day. The rationalization is that proven, long-term trades are a better representation of a successful trader than someone who got lucky with one highly-leveraged trade.

Maybe time-weighted wouldn't end up being telling. Maybe it's number of trades. IDK. Line I said, I'll need to play with them a little.
just means this bear market is moving twice as fast?
Ah. I gotchya, thanks for elaborating. I attribute this to the market cycles moving quicker as a result of the huge influx of volume compared to 2014. Just my 0 substance opinion though. Definitely interested to see how things turn out by EoY 
The question is as always 'how many people see it this way', if there's enough then it's self fulfilling prophecy.
I’m honestly not even sure if I buy it myself. I’m definitely not going to trade off it unless it breaks up from resistance, which is likely when everybody else would buy anyway.

However, this model does line up pretty well with the Wyckoff accumulation scenario people have been sharing lately, with $5800 being the spring. I figure it was worth sharing at least in case anybody else thought this was worth tracking.
Some include and some don't. Can't say if it's even possible to draw it like this until I'll have a chance to check out myself.
Drawing linear is also useless and it worked at 11.7.

Cutting wicks is common practice, especially on blow of tops and bottoms.

I mean... It's like with this first 11.7. it worked because a lot of noobs draw it like that.
In general, the volume has been dropping as we get closer to the end of the "wedge". However, I agree that we should be seeing more buying volume showing up around now, which does not appear to be happening. I doubt this breaks upward, especially considering bitcoin's price still seems inflated, but it's interesting nonetheless.
Going short here. Maybe being impatient but that was pathetic if that was the attempt 
Fine. His last post in a bitcoin sub before this was from over 3 years ago. He's a full-time poster in ethtrader. This first post back in a Bitcoin sub is essentially an advertisement for ETH.  The only BTC content in his post is his concern that BTC will continue to crash while ETH moons. To me, this is not genuine concern from a Bitcoin daytrader. 
not sure this translates 1:1 to influencing crypto Prices... its also debatable and depandant on what pie you use and how you Group.

iam not saying its meaningless! just that many mabye see it a bit too meaningfull in a 24/7 global market.
Dude, I'm not from US, I'm in the polar opposite country, Iran but I have no beef with Trump, he made the right choice by exiting out of the nuclear deal, that shit was no good to us Iranian people, only filling the pockets of the government. So, he is ok in my book, more balls than Obama, he lost a golden opportunity in 2008 by not doing anything when there was a huge revolution going on in Iran.

IMO Trump will be either very successful or another Bush. In fact Trump is doing the opposite of what US agencies were doing all the time, collecting their shit from all over the world and focus on the interior matter, which is very good IF they actually do it and leave the world well enough alone. So SEC regulating crypto should not be attributed to all of the world, East Asia, EU and Russia are big into crypto, US will only lose from overregulating, a fact that was repeatedly mentioned during SEC hearings. 
Yeah you're right, but I thought it was really ironic in this case.
Justice will be served 🦅 
Lol. Somehow I never thought about that :-D
I agree with this
That's very fair, provided you don't own any BTC. However, if you own BTC, then "not caring" about its monetary value is pretty dumb, regardless of how much you care about the tech. It goes against human fundamentals. Sure, it's brave, and makes you sound like you have the moral high ground when you say "idc about the price" but really it's just anti-pragmatism.
Profit is still stakes though...
I get it, but I think you need to zoom out a bit. Even if we get a pump, where does it go, 6.8? then what, 7050? Can it even get there. Well, clearly it keeps breaking down instead of upward. I see this bursts upward as mainly noise in a medium term down trend.
I agree with that, Ichi is suited best for higher time frames, which in my opinion has a clear medium-long term trend right now.
Sorry, I can be a dick sometimes. But it's just that that comment made no sense at all. As for your original comment, indicators being a graphic representation of price action against other variables like volume, time, etc., they are valid on every state of the market. Up, down, sideways. And saying that indicators are just lines on a graph is like saying that words are just letters on a paper.
Oh yea I agree that's why I don't long here. But we will very likely see $6k again after we dump through it.  We won't go straight from $10k to $5k just to not bounce. There will like be a large correction at some point that will wreck a lot of people shorting the bottom. It'll happen just when everyone gets comfortable shorting lol. Right now no one is comfortable shorting. 
How many people tried shorting? If they don't know how it works they can't imagine that you can short with USD, so they can't imagine that tethered funds can be used to short.
You can't move profits but you can move a lot of margin out.

If you have 5x you can do 50x since you're in big profit and you can't get liquidated.
I agree, this does seem possible.
Yes. But it's possible that it is not over yet. I see a bullflag on the hourly.

It decreases confidence in the existing market. There's a transition period where nobody is going to be sure what's what, and who's actually compliant. Lack of clarity will destabilize markets; shrinking until it finds stability.
Bbgurl, I don't disagree that the alt market is irrational, I am just saying even if it were rational a 70% drop due to US regulations would not make sense either.
Yeah, it was a gamble, didn't pay off, happens.

There's a big fight on eth and btc going on here on low volume.

Basically the best way is to watch from the sides until this does something.

It might be that people are exiting alts through eth and btc and part of them cashing out.
I don't fully agree on that. For me, a 1 day trade for 4% is more important than a 50 day 8%. If you are margin trading, 50 days will have more fees to pay so it will cut on profits.

If i can get 1% a day constantly, or even 0.5%, after those same 50 days i'll have far greater wins.

Of course, managing 50 days with an positive average is time consuming (and stressful) than entering 1 trade and just let time bring you the profits (of course there can be some underwater time that is also stressful).

This might be just my opinion of course. 
Yea, I find myself wondering why we're decreasing at a faster rate. The 200ma weekly crossdown + following the ATH downtrend line is already occuring/occurred whereas in 2014 that all happened in late August/September I believe. 

Makes me wonder why. Possibly something to do with what you said.

Not only are there going to be profit takers from this previous bullrun, but there will be profit takers from 2011-2015 as well. 2014 didn't have as much baggage from early adopters. Lots of people with lots of bitcoin probably cashing out portions or lots of it 
Eh... I'm not sure how much TA is back narration and how much is actually pedictive. Seems like the best tool is risk management. 

It's a long enough period that almost anything could happen IMO.
Having a model that gets within 10% of observation is pretty fucking good, IMO.
Well that was true until we broke down from the triangle.. Loook at your chart, volume increased substantially recently

He's possibly tired of being over at ethtrader and is is now asking for the opinions of traders/investors who understand the overall market better than the goobies at r/ethtrader
Good point.  I guess when it comes to the whole "ETF" white whale, its significance is amplified.

I disagree. Its a lot of work to care about the price, and tradig is just not worth it for me currently, especially after a couple bad trades
Agreed
Sorry, that's what I meant. *Higher* timeframe (i.e. lower resolution). I've never understood why longer periods are called *higher*. They should be called *lower* because you're zooming out and lowering the resolution. 
I was probably not clear enough in my previous comment, but I was refering to the OP saying that we are going up because 1) MA Cross, 2) TK Cross and 3) Bull Div.

But they only way we can go up is if people buy this market. Indicators are just tools to make decisions. They are not an end.
Well, aren't words just letters on paper?
Those bounces are getting lower. 10k, 9k, 7.8k, 6.7k... it's not straight down.

But honestly I think that somewhere in 5k we may see the bottom, at least short term. It's like the last time, everyone expected 4-5k and we bounced at high 5k. Now people think it'll go down to 4, so mid 5k may not be stupid to try long if you're already short to hedge it.
Thanks mate. I think it's possible that you are actually a human sitting at the computer writing the same response day after day. You get paid $.25 an hour to type for a psychotic lunatic with a sick fetish for total power over people in completely inane ways. 


I think that if you send fiat through bisq in a country that requires KYC/AML, you are at legal risk.
I didn't say there will be a 70% drop or a 30% drop. I'm saying it's irrational... and it can stay irrational for a long time. It can't stay irrational forever, though.
I do that sometimes.

Look at position sizes and leverage. I sometimes go with small order with high risk to jump start bigger position if movement confirms and cut it for small loss if I'm wrong..
You make a good point. In my previous comment I acknowledged my logic might be flawed.
If you look at the mentality behind both bear markets, I think it logically makes sense why this crash appears to be much quicker and violent than 2014.

2014 was marked by lots of literal FUD, with early adopters questioning the future of bitcoin after the Mt Gox hack and Silk Road shutdown. This sort of issue can likely have a slowly creeping effect on people’s perspective on the coin’s future.

In comparison, we are looking at recovering from a parabolic run from moonbois trying to make quick profits without much interest in bitcoin itself. When it looked like this wasn’t working out, many people quickly turned to cashing out or shorting the market. I think this lead to a much quicker decline in price versus the early adopters in 2014 slowly fleeing the market as uncertainty continued.

TL;DR: 2014 crash was likely slower because early adopters began questioning the future of bitcoin itself. 2018 crash is much faster in comparison because of parabolic FOMO and greed by later adopters trying to catch profits on the way up, followed by panic and greed on the way back down.

The cause was different, but the effect the same - what comes up must come down.
But TA is risk management. Check out first bounce from 11.7. it perfectly touches ATH resistance, but drawn linear, not log.
The way I see it, there were three cycles this year, with dumps occurring from January-February, March-April, and May-June. Each of these dumps was lower in volume than the previous one. It tends to be a small decline with a couple bounces along the way, followed by a big dump past support, accumulation, and a swing back up for further selling. Each cycle has been been slower than the previous one, with the price consolidating overall. I think people are too caught up in the ascending support line around $7k being broken if you ask me, especially since this pattern matches up nicely with the two previous cycles.

From what I can tell about descending wedges, the volume profile isn’t too surprising. The volume on the June 10 drop isn’t as large as the final drops during the two previous cycles, which occurred on March 29 and February 05. Maybe I’m reading it wrong, but the most vital aspects that we need are an increase in buying volume near the end (which I’m not seeing yet), and a positive divergence (which appears to be present at the moment, if I’m not mistaken).

The textbook example of a falling wedge includes four successively lower peaks and valleys, and we’re at three now. So technically there’s still time. However, Bitcoin rarely follows the “textbook”, so I doubt it plays out that way.

Sorry for the essay. Again, I think this pattern is highly unlikely, but am I interpreting the volume profile wrong?
Jesus that was maybe 30 seconds before. Feels good man
This.. I've tried being in altcoin forums the brain and stack size drops steeply as you move down the coinmarketcap list.  I like to trade altcoins sometimes but if you go to their forums its:  ooga booga grug want berry.

As long as he doesnt get annoying and constantly shill eth i say its fine.  Eth stumbled in a pile of shit yesterday and it's semi-relevant to bitcoin.


We don't have any hard regulations regarding cryptos, and Iranians collectively bought about 2 billion dollars worth of crypto recently mostly because it is a hedge against depreciating IRR and also because gold and USD market are restricted and manipulated here. Iranians are generally very pro tech and have a strong internet presence, it's only natural for them to be attracted to crypto, both as a means of saving their capitals and to circumvent various sanctions. When your banking system is not integrated in the global network you have limited options and crypto is becoming a very attractive option to transfer funds out of the country. For example my brother lives in the us but take some projects in Iran, he uses crypto to transfer funds out of iran.

And they don't chop hands for theft here, not yet lol. Iranian politics are very complex, because iranians are complex in nature. Ever had a perisan girlfriend? You'd understand :)
I didn't even mention trading. I certainly care about the price, but i only think about or check the price once a week or once a month. I never trade. Etc. You're just assuming i meant trading when i definitely did not
I can see your point when you expand on it. But yeah, indicators just point the state of the market and the ways thing can play out, so you're right about that. When in consolidation and lack of a trend things get a bit more complicated, that's why it's helpful to zoom out. 

Look at the daily Ichi https://www.tradingview.com/x/ijU692XM/
Under the cloud, lagging span as well and price below both Tenkan and Kijun. That right there says short it since 7800.
Isn't music just sounds?

Reductionism is useless :P 
Oh yes, which is why I think the bounce will be huge and take people by surprise. The second time down from $11.7k the bounces were very large, like 30%. We've not seen more than a 10% retrace on since $10k, which is kind of crazy. It signals the strength of the move, but the trend reversal will be very strong when it occurs. It will probably a month of buying.

People here will go crazy, start thinking the bull run is back on right at the top when other people realize it's probably time to cash out, etc. 

But yea, I'm going to be buying at $4.5-5.5k

I think it will bounce very hard to $6.8-7.8k
Conversation with a bot? ;-)

It's not a flaw, it's a feature :)

Each one has his trading style and strategies. If you have little free time to watch charts than you might "follow" long term traders but if you like faster results then a successful scalp trader is the one to "follow"
Eh... I tried to get too nuanced. I'm just saying that you make your best guess, run with it, then get out when it's clear you're wrong. There isn't a way to do this perfectly.
Dual light saber on the 30m... I'm seeing this going back inside the pattern... We're being played or Bulls and Bears are both sure of themselves and will fight here till death.

I'm with you on a short but this is getting really weird
As a follow-up, he deleted all his posts in here. Looks like he did all his ETH shilling, then circled back and saw that he was caught so he destroyed the evidence. 
Except balsamic glaze reduction. That shit is bomb
Don't think so. Remember when we were going up to 17k after huge drop?

I think I it's gonna be more like this. Rounded bottom until people will realize it's not going any lower and then a lot of buying. It's either capitulation wick and strong bounce or rounded bottom.
Is it a bullish indicator to see sloppy talk to a bot?
Because it is the law.

I know what you meant. I was just saying that if 90% of traders will draw the same but random line then the line is real. That's why they work, people trade by them, they're not only psychology.
No reason not to keep this open for me. Bulls had their chance on what looked to be a clear bull flag and couldn’t push it up and over. 
or we just lost another member with a different perspective because we have a cult mentality like every other reddit.

Yeah and it's also a pain to clean off the pan.
Probably, means I'm going crazy O_O
I think I just give a little less weight to the impact of commonly observed patterns. We seem to be saying the same thing otherwise. I'm trying to get away from using TA as a way to read between the lines and instead use it to frame my narrative about the market that isn't shown in charts.
ETH and LTC were both dipping putting some downward pressure.

6k5 is putting up a fight. Keeping tight stops.
What's even better is he purged his history back to 10 months ago.  He got rid of all of his recent r/ethtrader flippening posts.  Magical stuff.  

You might be right that he's a changed man.  He suddenly decided that his previous approach was wrong and he decided to purge it so that he can start fresh.  We'll soon find out.
Worth it^^^tm
Yeah, you're considering going long. Something's wrong.
I think the bears might of just taken back the momentum there.. we’ll see. Eyes have been glued to the charts the last 48 hours. Need to take a break here soon lol 
I slept like 2 hours babysitting my underwater short... Managed to close it near breakeven. Could have kept it but every time i get heavily underwater i tend to dial down the greed button.

Now it's zombie time all day and i hope to close all my positions before bed time... i need a rest too.
