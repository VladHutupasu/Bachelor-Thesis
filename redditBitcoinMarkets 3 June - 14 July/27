PnF Update

The downward pressure seems to continue.  We turned down into a tentative column of Os overnight.  (This could be reversed with a gain up to $6,600.)

If the price drops under $6,350 today we would have another double bottom break down, with target prices as low as $5,800.  

This formation is now 5 columns wide.  We have been seeing movements between 5 and 8 columns.  So, we could see some sharper moves today.

I hate to say it but it is my inkling that we are going down into the 5 handle area before we go back to 7.  

The key numbers today are under $6,350.  That would trigger the move down to the $6,100 level pretty quickly.  The move down to $5,800 would probably take a couple days to a week.

NOTE:  PnF Charts are different than most charting tools.  It displays longer term trends and is not really applicable to day trading.  There are terms used in both PnF charting and they mean different things.

So this is what Phase II looks like. Nice
down 3000 shorts in this last 4h candle, up 1100 longs...

I think what we've learned here is that when we go sideways/chop around, anyone who tries to open a position in that environment (particularly in the middle of a chop range) has incredibly weak hands and is prone to being squeezed. 

Longs: 30065

Shorts: 25637

bitmex open interest: 75,466. down from 78,000 yesterday and up from 70,000 a few days ago at around $7500  
I'm a noob, and I'm trying so hard not to FOMO right now. I put about 1/2 my available fiat in at this time last week, and I'm saving the other half, waiting.... watching.... but maybe this is me just wishing the market into a bear trend so I can get in at a better price than $14K like in december. That being said, even if I do FOMO my fiat into this pump, it'll still be better than we I got in before lmao.

Does anyone think this is a small, short-lived bounce in a continuing downtrend? If not, that's okay; I've prepared my anus to be downvoted into oblivion. Hope you bulls make a lot of money today :)

*edit: when I put in my money last week, that was definitely a FOMO, which is why I'm waiting now lol
!short XBTU18 6410 2x 100%

Just because f... it.

Edit: guys, that's futs entry, it's basically 6460 on spot.
Something must of changed in the way Google delivers news to me:

'Environmental Disaster' - BIS warns on cryptocurrencies - Financial Times + Reuters

'Bitcoin is useless, unsafe and dirty': this new report is withering in its verdict - Telegraph

I never used to see this before, certainly at least not in the last 5 months. Either it's paid fudding ( with a goal in mind ) or just the algo's
If anyone is interested in watching specific transaction sizes (for example, I just want to see buys/sells >= 1 BTC), this is pretty useful. If I can't be bothered to watch the charts and am doing something else away from the computer, I'll usually set this up full screen and if there isn't a bunch of red/green flashing, I can probably ignore. Good way to casually watch and know if a move is potentially being made. Also a decent indicator showing if the large transactions are skewing buy/sell.

edit: some words, also be mindful that it can occasionally freeze

edit2: hope some of you got to watch those buys just now, that was fun
I closed my long from around $6,420 at around $6,720.  Target was $6,800 but this is close enough. Safe trades all.
45 minutes without a 1$ price movement...
HoW do you interpret The fact that hashrate is on its way to ath in these times?

I didn't realise only 9 had been issued in total. Not a ringing endorsement. 
broke through 6730 so things looking good for [my original target](https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8rwmpx/daily_discussion_monday_june_18_2018/e0vmu88/). Its nice to see a bullish trend on BTC even if its only on the 4-hour chart! I'll take what I can get üêÇ
Full disclosure, I have no one to blame but myself, but I had a nice long entry that I closed because I let others here influence my decision. 

Lesson learned, trust yourself and not others
There's a 1100 strong buy wall on Bitfinex forming, if you haven't noticed yet. https://i.imgur.com/YMiwt4y.png

Interpret that as you will ;)

Did a few buy-high/sell-lows on Binance last week. Moved my funds to Bitfinex yesterday to short some BTC. Lost another $100 today with this pump. Time to face myself: I suck at trading this market. Learning the hard way from my own mistakes. :-)

Final plan: moving my funds back to Gdax and going 100% Fiat. Staying away the next couple of weeks and decide to jump back in on a better (lower) price.

I will keep reading the daily sub here though, some great minds in here with good info.
[VolumeRSI (VRSI) analysis, amateur TA intended to explore this odd indicator to see if it's indicative of market trend in a low volume, BART driven market.](https://www.marketvolume.com/technicalanalysis/volumersi.asp)

Previous comments from Friday:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8qyvqh/daily\_discussion\_thursday\_june\_14\_2018/e0ofsbo/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8qyvqh/daily_discussion_thursday_june_14_2018/e0ofsbo/)

Disclaimer: Amateur TA, experimental indicator, would NOT suggest you trade on this idea. Would love any input or criticism or re-interpretation of any point I make.

Main observations:

* Weekly & monthly VRSI are still at historic lows;
* Bounce from 6.1k bought weekly VRSI out of oversold, as per the above comment. This was short lived, as it's back into [oversold](https://i.imgur.com/rD3jVd1.png);
* For clarity, I explored [maximum goblin town VRSI](https://i.imgur.com/XhBtrWV.png) before the VRSI jumped up on the weekly and I suggested we might be looking for a leg up as [VRSI had flatlined](https://i.imgur.com/6U8R6hj.png), whereas the new weekly VRSI point data puts us back into oversold;
* Monthly VRSI [technically has room to go further down](https://i.imgur.com/FzMZqNK.png) before being oversold, but it has never been so low;
* On the bearish side, both these long term VRSI indicators still show a downward trend. Calling for an immediate reversal given the sentiment I'm seeing from the community with this in mind would be careless;
* Finally, VRSI on the daily is reset to near oversold. Last time it was this low we crashed from 7.5k to 6.6k. Seems contrary to what I said above right? What this means is that whilst we were crashing, people were [accumulating hard enough to pump that VRSI](https://i.imgur.com/gVj0B4j.png). I know people chuck the idea that whales are playing the market to accumulate as some sort of unknowable hopium, but the VRSI for that day suggests an inkling of truth.

tl;dr;(too many links) VRSI still mad low on long time frames, room to drop still but much more room above. Short term bearish, [medium/long term bullish](https://www.moonmath.win/).
Is this the quiet before the storm ?
Do hidden buy/sell orders show up in volume bars?
Do limit buy/sell orders show up?

Dam I'm asking some basic ass questions. Prob shouldn't be trading at all. 

E: thank you my homies. Was hoping hidden orders don't show up, that would support the accumulation story. This chop is getting me nervous that a wick south will liquidate and leave my long behind on the bounce/fakeout up. Or that I don't catch the wick up to exit my long at b/e
Holy cow that was some biiiig market buy on finex.
bottom shorters are given a chance to improve their average entry.
It‚Äôs called the accumulation phase
Lol 10 mins ago I was just finishing my TA up, I was gonna go long after finishing the idea up, now it's already too late. Anyways, we're going to test 7k at the least (physiological resistance + previous support + under the previous downtrend line we broke down out of (heavy resistance). Do not short right now. Just wait till 69xx at the least if you are bearish.
Bears learned their lesson during the April short squeeze. Bulls, not so much!
Closed my long on Sept futures from $6427 on the pumps up today at $6627 and $6715. I've been away from the computer all day, so I'll reassess when I get home. However, we are below heavy horizontal resistance here, and are likely to stall around $7150 if we pump up further from here, especially if it doesn't retrace from here a bit first. I've won on all seven trades this month, 6 shorts and one long, so I want to assess the situation before I enter a new position. However, I will likely start scaling into a short here and add on the way up to the $7300 range, with stops above there in case this thing breaks out. I still don't think we've found the bottom of the cycle here - just a series of short squeezes - but I want to see how things look before I enter a new position.


!long XBTU18 profit 6627 25%

!long XBTU18 profit 6715 25%

Honest question, do you think the market would ever outgrown or resolve these continuous bull/bear flags and bart patterns? In the first few months of this year, it actually felt like there were real volume and volatility to the market. Now its more of a super high leverage gambling to see who gets rekt first or both ways.
Woke up to a nice move up, but unfortunately was not in a position. I think it'll stay that way as well. This move up was entirely longs opening and shorts closing so it's just chop imo. There's nothing really to read into TA-wise. I think my targets are still 7100 to short and 6100 to long, and this time I'll be patient with my entries. That's what made me lose so much in the 7k's; not waiting for support and resistances. I'll make sure to wait this time.
buy wall from $6700 to $6600 is up to 3140 btc. Some fuckery going on either way, never seen a wall that big

edit: up to 3900 now 

edit: down to 2400 now lol 
Lol, almost 3k market buy in 3 minutes on Bitfinex, here is the BGD we are waiting for.
Finex 1m bband are almost touching each other. Hate when it happens, it's usually followed by some stupid wick.

Edit: well, didn't play out as I anticipated. Usually when 1m bbands touch each other you can see something like 'some whale - I see the price is completely not moving, oh well, let's have some fun, let's toss a coin, tails - down it is, 200btc market sell'.
On a day like today, when volatility is in the doldrums I was given to thinking whether another short squeeze like we saw with the so-called BGD on April 12th could occur. 

However, the short:long ratio for Bitfinex isn't giving an indication that this is likely - https://imgur.com/4oVL6XK - right now the ratio is only 0.98 - so longs just dominate. In December at the peak the ratio was about 0.4, back then longs really dominated (see blue arrow). On 12th April when we had that $1000 BGD candle - see blue arrow - the ratio dropped from 1.12 to 0.8 in a single day.

It doesn't look to me like we're due for either a short or long squeeze right now based on this chart
[deleted]
18 days until the 6th July I guess....
At what price would we likely be out of the current down trend ( the one starting from $9800 )?

I'm thinking if we make a strong show of going over $6800, we could see the start of a new upward trend.

https://imgur.com/EznIaEn
Not saying that this isn't the bottom, because it could be... But, realistically, we're still making lower highs and lower lows on the daily charts.  Still looks like a descending triangle that could very well break down further.  This was only a small push back after massive drops, don't get crazy yet.  Be conservative, and realize that we are still overall on a downward trend, and have been for many months now.  Chart below.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/IN4fsPGL/
I just want to say thank you to everyone here - I'm only really lurking, but having the smallest bit of doubt and skepticism isn't immediately punished here like in the bitcoin sub.  It's very refreshing when not everyone posting is a newbie that went long 20% higher than we currently are!
welp it seems yet again as soon as the entire sub was short that we get a big ass market buy. this is just getting tiresome lol
One year ago the ratio of price to volume was 2.6k to 1.5b. Today it's 6.7k to 4b. To be proportional, today's price would be 6.8k. Not trying to make a case here just some random data I thought was interesting. Also worth noting is that today's volume is 2.7 times what it was a year ago.

Edit: numbers to account for mistake in rounding

Everyone so bearish, time to run to 7350
Alts are dropping, some of them are at the 6.1k low already. 
Been reading about ichimoku today. entered short at 6449 on bearish TK cross below cloud. 1/3 of my trading stack which is a tiny %age of my portfolio so i dont really mind too much if we get a short squeeze as i wont lose much.

gonna start using the bot thing as well cos why not.

!short XBTUSD 6449 5x 33.3%

EDIT: shit, mb forgot time frame, 1H on mex chart https://www.tradingview.com/x/M8FQLBV2/
sorry lads
Doesn't it bother anyone that the RSI on 1hr and 2hr charts have been ~~oversold~~ overbought for a few hours now with no movement?
these are WTF moments....

BGD out of nowhere 
Since I sold 95% of my crypto 1 month ago my sleep has improved a lot. Highly recommend, remember that the price level never is too high or too low for a speculator, it's only an indication of market trend 
The next couple of days will be interesting. Never before we have seen such a slow and steady increase in shorts without any kind of squeeze.

There are basically 2 options here:
1) Massive short squeeze incoming.
2) Whales are the ones shorting the market and this will fall like a rock once the bulls are dryed up.

Interesting days ahead indeed.
Are there seriously people that identify as bulls all the time or bears all the time?  Instead of people that just try to make intelligent decisions about the market and either sell or buy trying to make money? Isn't railing against bulls and bears just a way of anthropomorphizing a boogeyman that is really just the random movements of the market so that we feel we have some control over it?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion_of_control

>One study examined traders working in the City of London's investment banks. They each watched a graph being plotted on a computer screen, similar to a real-time graph of a stock price or index. Using three computer keys, they had to raise the value as high as possible. They were warned that the value showed random variations, but that the keys might have some effect. In fact, the fluctuations were not affected by the keys.[8][20] The traders' ratings of their success measured their susceptibility to the illusion of control. This score was then compared with each trader's performance. Those who were more prone to the illusion scored significantly lower on analysis, risk management and contribution to profits. They also earned significantly less.[8][20][39]
Hiring someone to double back hand bitch slap me for not opening a YOLO long before as i just stared at the buy button but didn‚Äôt have the courage to hit it. 

I must have my balls removed as my manhood has gone in the shitter. 
Needs to break 7k trendline for confirmed bull run, 6730 still under the trendline and we will continue downward. Also noteworthy:

2/4 9223 Open, 7809 Low, 8225 Close

2/5 8185 Open, 6651 Low, 6946 Close

2/6 6948 Open, 6000 Low, 7678 Close

2/7 7677 Open, 7175 Low, 7586 Close

2/8 7585 Open, 7565 Low, 8239 Close

This huge dip we had was very very brief, and no day opened under 6500 and the price recovered very quickly. 

The dip from 3/29 - 4/12 bottomed at 6500 and started/ended at 8000. We slowly recovered to 10k and now are here.

Why do I think we are going to see 4-5k price? Interest in BTC has dried up substantially. The day we say the 6135 price a few days ago, the volume the previous day was 2775 BTC. That is tiny. We recovered some the past couple of days, but BTC volume is back to about 5k per day and dropping. 

In addition, we have opened 4 out of the last 5 days under 6500, with one around 6600. No time since before the run of 2017 was price that low this year for this long. Downtrend will continue until interest picks up. 

Price have never been below its 500day moving average since 2014/2015. 500day moving average is 6k. We drop that and look out below.  





Simple symmetrical triangle with breakout targets, also lots of shorts collected at 6500: https://imgur.com/a/T8ly3Ng
To the shorters out here: where do you set your S/L? Just above the current triangle resistence? Or higher to be safe from a wick (fakeout)? Kinda puzzled here tbh..
Does Robinhood let you short Bitcoin? With leverage?
Price is in a tight range ~6370-6570. Easy to take a position with a tight stop or set up some stop orders for when the range breaks.
Although it's basically a coin-flip right now, I slightly favor a breakup rather that breakdown here. Reasons:

\- High amount of bottom shorters.

\- Excellent liquidity pool at low 7k's. Counterpoint: There is also a nice liquidity pool at high 5k's. Counter-counterpoint: It can be hard to drive the price back up if it goes to 5k's so market makers may favor a breakup first.

\- Declining alt ratios may be indicating accumulation.

That being said I'm still out of position. Those are not convincing enough for me to go long now.
This is a suckers rally 
For me it seems we should not expect a big move before the 12h bbands tighten, and that needs another 4 candles = 48 hours. Dont waste time watching the charts when nothing happens, or if you have the volume and pay zero fees than make some mini trades here....
I closed my long from earlier today because I do not know what is going to happen later. Being in a position is really difficult these days. The market can easily turn against any position at any given moment.

!long BTCUSD close 6726
For what it's worth daily RSI is painting some buy signals with a failure swing and a breakout above resistance.
As soon as we had a little momentum starting to build, they had to load the FUD. Just Google bitcoin and click News to see the latest batch of FUD headlines. "Can bitcoin break the internet?" Ohhhh noessss! Omg folks, crypto could break the internet! 

 Rothschild, Rockefellar, and Soros sock puppet media is laughable at this point. These 13 ruling families have more wealth, power, and influence than any other family in the entire world. I suppose their media puppets are the best money can buy. lol sad. I'd rather take my crypto to the grave than sell and hand it to them at these prices.
Any significant that shorts are closing in on longs after being 10k less for weeks? If shorts continue to increase with the price staying where it is that is surely bullish?
https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSDT/wMv2tRqY-Pump-it-pt-2/

Target reached on long.... plan is to look for shorts in the D1 block for now. 
Is there any indicator I can use to see shorts v longs from bitmex on tradingview?
Short squeeze ?
Gosh, I hope this doesn‚Äôt break the internet. 

I‚Äôm targeting a limit sell in the 6850 range. That should peg out the RSI for a decent pull back and a quick scalp. 
B-but everyone told me to short 100000x. Free money basically they said....


I'm re-entering hedge short here.

!short BTCUSD 6720 2x 50%


I'm yet unconvinced.

Today's pump felt pretty significant. In reality, we moved 6% and then retraced 30% of that. This move was really quite similar to last thursday's move. Huge market buy, shorts closing out, stalling before any significant resistance broken. Yes we broke out of our pennant, but a $50 move would have done that this morning. Our daily pennant resistance (assumed) above is up to 7150 now, but a move over 6900 would be pretty bullish IMO. 7150 is a long way to hold from here, so I'm not really sure I'd do that, but I'll have to decide where I want my line in the sand.

Also this entry is on Sept futures.
Unphased by this pump (as with every single pump in recent history). Possibly all we‚Äôre doing is forming [yet another bear flag](https://www.tradingview.com/x/gJzdqFN0/) on the daily chart. 
https://www.tradingview.com/chart/XBT/8ygTUgLR-ABC-target-6600-6800/

My targets if purple down trend line is broken.  

EDIT:  Gotta love when a plan comes together.  Targets still stand
I mean... what would be so wrong about this being the bottom? What makes this have to correct down even further, other than history?
Hard to know if the bear market ends with a bang or with a whimper.  If we drop here it could get ugly.  But I think that no good news happens without a reason, especially from governments.  They have had months to approve the Square bitlicense.  I think it's bullish that it's approved now at this stage in the bear market.  Could be that everyone is mostly in position for the next run up.
So, I‚Äôm kind of liking hanging out at 6500 a while. First, it‚Äôs easier to read the market, for me at least. Also. I have time to accumulate BTC and 9k memes again. 
Something I've learned about this market is: dont underestimate FOMO.
We should have a break by tomorrow when that obvious 4h wedge closes. I have been watching ton of different analysis and I can say that around 75% of people think we will break down. Good luck to everyone! :D
Point and Figure https://i.imgur.com/P6YRMrK.png  We have broken down from our range 5 days ago. New range is between 4,454-7,776. 
 A pullback to $4,499 would complete unresolved long pole dating back over 8 months ago and is our next likely long-term target. Short term, we have a recent unresolved long pole of 16 O's from 6/10, a move above 7,040 would resolve 50% of the pole.

4 hour https://www.tradingview.com/x/khAi3ral/  On my [last post](https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ronjo/daily_discussion_sunday_june_17_2018/e0tvugs/) we were waiting for a break up from the pink wedge.  We [discussed risking a short](https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8rgy73/daily_discussion_saturday_june_16_2018/e0s3w8y/) after the pink wedge is broken.  The short would be risked off of previous support trendline (7230) or volume node (7550).  The short could be risked off a stop loss at the higher high of 7751.  Before we can reach those price points we must break through resistance at 6730 (trendline + higher high on 4 hour marking bull trend on 4 hour).

Edit: broke through 6730 so things looking good for my original target.  Its nice to see a bullish trend on BTC even if its only on the 4-hour chart!  I'll take what I can get üêÇ
As always there will be no follow up to this and we will crash back. Feel free to put a 1 month reminder.
I still believe we break down but if we break I'm taking profits early. I think we have a major short squeeze coming up. You can squeeze even more shorts of grandma and dad when the price is <6k and whales know that.
Wow, this morning i was contemplating selling at 6500 since it seemed like it was going to be a slow blead or a bart move down again.  


Then this happens, I'm not watching this goddamn chart anymore and i'll just hodl it all.    


I'll sell my stocks and buy the fucking dip if we ever go sub 6k, but this just looks like we're going to bottom out on this range again.   


Here's another question:  


Anyone who TA'd this shit and got it right? Any fucking one? I feel like TA is seriously screwing with people's money right now. This entire sub pretty much voted a move down, and here we are
Im honestly so tired of bears, I really hope we pump and blow them out of the water for a change ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Still short at 6537 with 10x leverage and not even a little worried ;)
Doesn't this formation and volume profile look similar to the April bounce? I'm bracing for a decent bounce.
So little strength that even I, who is long, don't think this is gonna go up. I don't see ANY volume..
[removed]
Just trying to get my head around OBV..

If the price rises to a previous high but the current OBV is lower than at that previous high, does that mean the new high is weaker?

My reasoning is that it didn't take as much positive volume to get to the same price the second time. 

Or is it the opposite? That there is less supply so price will rise more easily.
It seems like we've had a bunch of wicks that went through the pennant. It could also mean that the pennant just got a bit larger. https://www.tradingview.com/x/KKwCZTqM/
So pretty much the entire sub has this triangle interpreted as a Symmetrical Triangle... But I‚Äôm viewing it as a Descending Triangle. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/G2s5IM9J/

Seems a little bit more clean and volume profile fits. 

Barely have traded, but I‚Äôll be opening a short if we knock on the resistance again
So BTC will stay >6k this year
Unfortunately I did not act on [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ronjo/daily_discussion_sunday_june_17_2018/e0td7hy/) hunch...
Stops hit 1.5% above the triangle. Held this position for a long time for basically nothing, but certainly could have been worse.

!short XBTU18 close 6498

I *think* we stop here, but not quite re-opening. 
Hit my price target to the penny: https://imgur.com/a/4zO6v0y

Other exchanges did not get up there, so I think we will revisit that price level.
Well, would you look at that! Just noticed my long from 6600 is green again. Not closing. Keep collecting the shorty tax, then close for a nice gain later this week. Thanks again, Bitcoin!
Poor all bottom shorters, really. Hope we can fill the Gap from 10th June.
[shitpost] Last night I dreamt I sold 20% of my stack and BTC shot to 10k. I sold the rest of my stack at 10k and it shot to 100k. Fuck that shit, I'm hodling.
Ok, on the buying side a wall of 900 @6420 and on the selling side not much needed to push price 5&#37; up (just  1900 BTC)
Though I'm well in profit, I have not closed my 6530 long, nor do I have any plans to do so in the next couple weeks.
dont usually do this but im gonna chase this candle. shorted EOS yesterday, closed with tiny profit, shorted btc earlier and just gave back my eos gains.

just gambling for fun with this one tbh

Alts are tanking and we went up to touch the previous support of the bear pennant. when alts are tanking a drop is soon to follow for the bitcorn we all trade. And as I said earlier I would add 20X to my short and so I did because who are we if we dont stand for what we say.  I think every other bearish sign or bullish have been mentioned before in this sub so I guess time will tell if we actually break the critical support of 6400 or not.

!short BTCUSD 6490 add 20X

**DISCLAIMER:** I am fine with getting liquidated/ stopped out, hope i wont, wouldnt reccomend anyone trading with this high leverage
Trying to move BTC to my 'Mex account. It's been nearly an hour. I forgot how much I hate moving BTC around. 
too low volume after that spiked. It doesn't look good, will retrace back to 6k5. After that, I have no idea.

How would you guys interpret this? had the triangle drawn out last night, went to be and woke up to this.

A backtest and rejection of a support level is shortable as it confirms it as a resistance but the lack of any follow through got me sceptical 
Does anybody know the source of this image: [https://i.redd.it/y94sxvrmts311.png](https://i.redd.it/y94sxvrmts311.png)

From which text book is it? Thanks. 
Volume is going up at a pretty decent rate even tho the price is... well sideways. But if volume is going up the price should follow sooner or later.

Edit :- I missed something, which is that the volume is pumping like crazy. Manipulation is the only thing I can think of. 
Hey guys I have a question.. Anyone got their Poloniex account unfreezed after they recently froze all unverified accounts. If so, how long did it take for the verification to be completed after you submitted the needed documents. Thanks in advance!
Every great magic trick consists of three parts or acts. The first part is called "The Pledge". The magician shows you something ordinary: a deck of cards, a bird or a man. He shows you this object. Perhaps he asks you to inspect it to see if it is indeed real, unaltered, normal. But of course... it probably isn't. The second act is called "The Turn". The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary. Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it, because of course you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. You want to be fooled. But you wouldn't clap yet. Because making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back. That's why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call "The Prestige".
Model price based on tx rate: 7-day average: $4373, 28-day average: $4576.

 Model price = 10^-0.638 \* (tx per day)^2.181 / # total coins.

Explanation is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2hyl9c/daily_discussion_wednesday_october_01_2014/ckxhy9y) with [historical graphs of price vs. model](https://i.imgur.com/HnZQ9rv.png) (last updated 2018-04-09) and [graphs of other correlations](http://imgur.com/a/7koaG) (last updated 2017-01-30). The code is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2oyrfq/code_for_tx_model/) if you want to improve on it.


**Accuracy of model and recent bearishness**

 Note, that this model has been doing relatively well if it is within *the same order of magnitude* of the price. That is to say, it is not a very accurate predictor of price, and to be within a factor of two of the market price (as recently) is effectively no strong signal. However, the prediction did dip just before the recent pop.

**Batching, UTXO count and so on.**

I have seen no convincing evidence that batching is currently a major effect to reduce the daily tx rate, and a cursory examination shows a similar dip in the UTXO network measure.
I am interested, long term, in alternatives to tx rate (given lightning etc) but I do not think UTXO count is a convincing alternative over, for example, unique addresses.
Parsing the blockchain directly for outputs per block is one possible alternative to deal with batching, payment channels notwithstanding.
I would have bet the formation would have broken down. I stand corrected.

Good job bulls, that was impressive.
There are few major alts on Binance that I track and most of them started pumping 10 minutes before BTC delivered - this market is so fun!

Does anyone truly believe BTC to see another ATH in the future? I mean, it could happen, but only when transactions are fast, cheap and when there's substantial adoption by retailers and such. Those things are not going to happen for a very long time, if ever.
I'm not a trader so forgive me (just LTH) but does anyone feel this will be *any* different to the reoccurring barts of late? or is there any indication we can punch through this?
Noob Bitmex question (please indulge me) - I have an limit order xbt open short position since mid May. Yesterday i wanted to open another but it ended up adding to my current position reducing the overall entry price. I now want to open another short - but keep it separate! Is there a way to do this? I noticed there is a ‚Äútake profit limit / sell‚Äù but not really understanding how that works (assuming you just set a tp target for e.g sell entry 6650 / trigger price 6500?) 

Thanks in advance guys

Question: Trading on Bitmex is based on future contracts right... I understand that BTC is the underlying value, but there is no actual BTC trading going on - just speculation on the direction. Does that mean the Bitmex ~~orders~~ transactions do not make/influence the BTC price?

It's not traditional TA, but I strongly feel that once the Bart pattern is broken (ie, big bears lose the ability to dump it down) it's off to the races. Will it be today or later this week? I don't know, but recent Barts have been slower and not as deep. Would not want to be short right now, but, hey, maybe you'll get lucky.
When in doubt, zoom out.

Lol and people were skeptical when I correlated BITCOIN price to OIL.

They have been spiking up at very similar times.

Personally I think bots look at other markets too. 
for me, with such a low xbitcoin price, it shows me rather a buying opportunity, than to enter the sales phase, despite intelligent technical reports on the decline of xbt. and bad information unfavorable to a different "x" problem with each attack of xbt, all this seems to me too much manipulated. .
it's not an orientation for the market, just one of my personal conclusions on the price .. even if I'm interested in buying 3000 s ... but I can not believe it ..

Nice write up, as always. 
I missed your regular PnF contributions to the daily, Merlin. Glad to see you bringing them back.
We've cleared $6,600. 

No idea what that means in terms of PnF (or anything else), but my gut says we'll see $5k before $8k. and $4k before $10k. 

That said, if you go all-in right now with the plan of hodling for 3yrs, I think you'll be very happy somewhere along the way. 

That being the case. Trade away! _and_ I'd also encourage everyone to accumulate a little hodling stash (no sales prior to Jun 2021 or $49k). If you have a profitable trade, put 10% of the post-tax gains into a hodl account. DCA with $100/mo. or $1,000/mo. Whatever suits your means.

Squeeze the longs, squeeze some shorts. Circle of life of trading.

Been waiting for a better entry to add to my short. Eyeballing 7200 as the ideal short entry.
btw, thanks for being super nice to me over the past week or so. Y'all have been super cool, even though I'm a noob. It's making me be braver when it comes to asking questions in my learning process. Thanks, guys
Please don't FOMO. It's time for you to come up with a plan that you can stick to. My personal recommendation is to dollar cost average (DCA). That approach can do a great job of limiting expensive mistakes, reduces the stress of trying to time the market, and keeps you within a budget. 
I would recommend you DCA over an extended period of time, you do not have to put all of your fiat in at any given point.  
FOMO is very difficult to resist. Being able to resist it is a great skill to have. In my experience, I have FOMOed at different times.. Some times I have lost, but there are very good times when it turned out to be a good profit. It is not a very good practice though..

Knowing when to FOMO is important *(if you decide to)*, even better, buy in advance if your feeling indicates an upward sentiment or vice versa.  Cheers!
Bulls make money every day. When it goes down, we just trade more grandpa fiat for sexy young Bitcoin, and when it goes up, we don't sell unless there's a compelling need for fiat.
>The fact you wrote this post shows you're starting to get a hold of your emotions and your desire to fomo.  I usually never time the bottom perfectly and wind up with unused fiat that I was saving for the worse case lows that didn't happen.  This is ok for me.  I would rather still have some fiat on the side than fomo in and not have anything left if it does go even lower.  You can still hang onto that fiat until you see a real confirmation of a trend change.  Ok you won't get in as cheap as you could have, but you'll get in when the direction of the trend has started moving in the right direction.  For me, I would like to see a couple of days green candles to be convinced this little bump is a longer term trend change.  It is encouraging that we've held above 6K with such low volume of late - but don't lose sight of the fact that it can easily turn around and shit the bed quickly.  I have some cash sitting waiting in case we go under 6K.  If we go below 6K, I'm happy to get cheap coin - if we keep going up, my longs beginning at 7K will start to turn a profit.  I find it's very healthy mentally to have both possibilities covered so that you are happy if it goes down and happy if it goes up.  That helps to prevent fomo and irrational decisions. 
Good job resisting the urge to FOMO. Most noobies aren't that disciplined. If I were you, I would wait to see if 6800 breaks convincingly, or wait and get a better entry lower. 
how about averaging down just a little bit? Sitting on that 14k entry must suck. dont get too greedy. It is very hard to predict this market. Nobody can really. So staggered buys down there if you believe in longterm bitcoin viability is good.

That's what I think. We've been getting these bumps on the way down for a while now and each time they happen, these people go "it's looking bullish, 30k by the end of the year" before it sinks further.. Everytime they push up, a new fud appears before it sinks again so that should be your cue..
Ya there's lots of people who think that. Doesn't mean they're right. Unfortunately we're all kinda just headless chickens on short term predictions. Virtually everyone in here has been right at some point (save for a few individuals üòÖ)

Imo stick to your plan. Or make a new one üòã

Cool thanks, and the >1K orders on Bitmex passing by are beyond my imagination.
Nice, man.  It was dicey for a day or 2 there.  Awesome hold and profit taking.  Glad it worked out for you.
Considering it hit $6794 (or around that, depending on your platform). I'd say your target was hit, even if you didn't close there. If it passes that, it may be because it's taking another leg up. Solid trade.

good for bitcoin ^tm , medium of exchange
I think this is probably an indication there are very few people trading sufficient amounts to move the market. 
There is almost zero real organic volume.  The price moves sideways (nowhere) until a manipulated BART up or down.  Last year, it was really about the same without the BARTS.  It was mostly all manipulation.
That the damn cat is still bullishly purring
the cost to mine a coin is less than the market price for some people.

additionally, since exploiting this difference requires a huge up front capital cost for ASICs, I assume the entering players have long term demand for coins.
new miners getting released + cost to mine a bitcoin still far below the market price.

If you look at the global hashrate over time, you can see that even in the 2014 bear market the hash rate was still surging:

[https://blockchain.info/charts/hash-rate?timespan=all&scale=1](https://blockchain.info/charts/hash-rate?timespan=all&scale=1)

Of course that was the era when ASICs were first being made on an industrial scale. The uptick started in early 2013 and continued through bull and bear. Of course new generations of hardware were being released almost constantly during this era so the hashrate continued to climb even when the price tanked.

I think so long as they can get a ROI miners are gonna mine. If they think the price of BTC is going up they might hold some of their profit in BTC; if not they'll sell it either OTC or on the open market.
Cost of production still below spot price / cost of production still below producer's estimate in future price.
I interpret it as better mining tech for less power, not more adoption.

P.S. I don't get the halvening hype. How good do you think mining tech will be by the time that happens. Twice as efficient?

Says it all that the group who made the report don't allow comments on the YouTube video.

The sentence "imagine buying a coffee for $2 and having to pay a $57 transaction fee" illustrates how much \*thought\* has been put into the report and their vision of a crypto future.

Question: These people aren't stupid though, so how do they come out with this trash?

Now that they've run out of plausible FUDs they start publishing blatant FUDs.
wow, the amount of misinformation in that article is staggering. I think this is slightly bullish: either CNN is blatantly ignorant about cryptocurrencies by publishing such report, which means we're still in the early adoption phase or CNN (and the original publisher) has an agenda in spreading FUD with misinformation, which means someone is afraid (banks) or is accumulating (investors).
Hilarious. Report by banks directly threatened by Bitcoin, concludes that they are not impressed by Bitcoin. Wow. Can't make this shit up... It's like a report by the sugar industry that concludes that fat causes obesity. Or a report by Oil companies that renewables aren't viable.


CNN is fake news
I am a die hard fan of blockchain and I really believe it will change the world in the following years. But Bitcoin is using only 5% of the blockchain potential - transactions only, and fails to be optimal even in that small area. We will see another bull run eventually, but it won't be lead by currency coins.

I don't agree with everything they said, but I do agree with a small portion of it. Try not to be biased for a minute and tell me if I am wrong.

I just saw your post about this potential fractal in the top comments after I had shared a similar analysis. How likely do you see this to play out?
~~Phase B likely ended, since we breached resistance for this range at 6700. Could be we will skip Phase C and~~
~~enter Phase D with Last Points of Resistance and end of this range (= breakout up). Too early to say~~

Edit: Nonsense. I was thinking about my own chart, **not** the one you linked.

This is my "unevolved" analysis from yesterday: 
https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ronjo/daily_discussion_sunday_june_17_2018/e0tpoqz/

Will post updates when it will be clear where we are.
My biggest issue with this outlook on accumulation is that I really don't think the 9.2k low is low enough to be classified as a ST. Rather, I think the 6.4k low would be the first ST to mark the beginning of phase B, and the lack of a lower low below 5.9k so far here would mean this recent low was just another ST in phase B.
If we are in Wyckoff Accumulation Schematic 1, then we have have not properly gone through phase C yet, instead we're just entering it or so. Remember, there is schematic 2 as well, it does not have such a deep spring, for what its worth.

Ouch, I hope you are able to turn it around.  I know it's not much consolation, but at least you are losing lunch money, not rent money.

The biguest issue I see with your analysis is that you think people are still using bitfinex as their primary trading platform. It makes your whole analysis useless until you include the other exchanges.

I think we have low liquidity right now that allows big players to push around the price in a very predictable way (large market buys/sells) after cranking the Bitmex slider all the way to the right for short term gains. 

Too many people sitting on the sidelines I'd guess due to uncertainty, the downtrend and fear of barts.

I think the only way to play this seems to be DCA, get a really good short entry and don't use too much leverage to get stopped out by these BGDs, play over-sold bounces for quick scalps or.....make friends with a whale?
> do you think the market would ever outgrown or resolve these continuous bull/bear flags and bart patterns?

You phrase that as though the last 9 years of btc has been the same price action. It's been a few months of this. Let's talk again if this pattern is continuing 18 months from now.
It‚Äôll outgrow it once more real money comes in and provides a buffer.  

Right now a few hundred million and you can move this market 100% either way I bet.  
Games being played.

You can add to this sell walls that pop out of nowhere
Could be a lot of people pulling orders from the high 5Ks and moving them up because they are starting to think they'll never get filled down there.
That's crazy. 
1000+ BCH buy wall at 875 too.

I have never seen spoof walls across 2 currencies, it's usually just BTC.

May not be spoof walls, could be some real buy walls there. 
So... explain to me (probably again ) what the point of this is apart from scaring people off shorting.

Edit - please and thank you - where are my manners.
Also a 500 sell wall coming and going right against the spread now.
Tether fueled pump and 3000+ BTC buy wall on Bitfinex. Just the same fraud Bitfinex/Tether has been pulling for ages. Still expecting $3000 BTC and probably lower.
There's your wick
I was so confused when I read the ratios. I realized you flipped short and long compared to others. It seems both eth and BTC ratios are floating close to one. So not much of a chance for a squeeze. The convention is long/short, call/put, since long typically is higher than shorts, you won't get into really small fractions the other way around 
Why anyone follows this fool is beyond me. Keeps adjusting targets, keeps saying he was never wrong, etc. 
I wish they would delist it.  CME has brought nothing good.

I find that REALLY hard to believe. 

They must've known a price below that was more than possible. It means they've baked in a crucial price point which surely must be a giant conflict of interest. 
So, the price of BTC is min. 5890$. Nice market we got here.

7K for horizontal reasons, 7200 for trendline reasons.
At this moment, the downtrend line from 10K (on the log chart) sits right at the former support line of the so called "meme" triangle that we broke down through, and I have it at 7.100 and change (finex).


$8600 in my book 
Depends on what you mean by the current downtrend. I'm trying to figure out the long-term direction, so my current chart on the macro scale looks like a madman made it, but each resistance overhead is trending down, so we've got lots of resistance above for the next few months: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/9fR9HDn8/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/9fR9HDn8/).

I don't see a new upward trend starting until we break resistance around $7000 to the upside ($7100-$7150). If the orange wedge applies, I still see it stalling around $7500, and if the pink pennant applies, I see it stalling around $8400. While beyond that is super bullish for me, falling short of that target will likely lead to the start of yet another dump cycle.
This is well said. It is likely we are closing in on a bottom - and it is POSSIBLE (not likely, possible) that we may see a significant return to or above the ATH in the next 6-9 months, but all that does not mean it may not fall down another 1000 or 1500.

That said, depending on stance (I am an investor, not a trader, in crypto), a DCA (Dollar Cost Average) entry scaled over some months may not be bad. As investor, I don't really care about getting THE bottom.
*sets his limit order slightly lower...
I'm underwater long atm, good 25&#37; down on this position.

I was long. BIG question is, where to now?
>  this is just getting tiresome lol

[and your post below]

> Yup, I agree and have been considering quitting for a week or two now

I think you should take some profits (soonish; not right now on the pump). Even though I agree with you we see 5k probablistically at some point in the future (I think you said you wanted to close at 5.9k?).

I always see you posting good entry positions but never see you closing a position or take profit. You didn't close on the last bounce from 6.4k to 10k, and have been holding a position for months, right? Just imagine if bitcoin makes another dead cat bounce (or real reversal) to 8.5k and you rage close your short at breakeven. I would blow my brains out if I invested so much mental energy for nothing.

As this sub's perma-teddybear with some actual brain and humble attitude, you probably 'deserve' some gains (as opposed to some other #knowitall-and-itoldyouso 'loud voices' in this sub); your last entries were 7.6, 8.5, 10k, if I recall correctly, so you should be more than fine money-wise; it wouldn't hurt to close 20% and do something nice with the profits.
Does this mean we made a breakout? And broke the bear pennant?
are you calculating volume in units of $ or btc?
We won't get above 7k

5k is more likely than 7k+
Does the capitulation phase have to be short term? This long bleed of sadness seems more fitting.
Sept futs $50 below spot, finex buy wall at 6.4+ disappeared, we're grinding this short-term triangle... I just can't see this turning now.

>It's concerning alright, it's less likely that we can make another leg up with a higher high unless the RSI cools off.  What is also concerning is that if you look at the 1 min chart from the pump, there were 4 one min candles followed by 3 one min candles that represented the move.  Doesn't appear to be sustainable at the moment.

I lost all mine. Same effect.
Your "never before" statement felt a little melodramatic to me, but this is indeed a rather unique look for BTCUSDSHORTS: https://www.tradingview.com/x/D9eVSa6s/
The last few months are feeling more and more like 2001 to me. We had a massive exponential increase, a crash from unsustainable highs, then a series of moves downward interspersed with bounces higher. Each bounce had a lower magnitude and happened under lower volume.  I like to call it a ball bouncing down a staircase.  

After it looked like we'd limped to a bottom, 2002 came around and the Nasdaq fell another 40%.  I have no idea if that'll happen here, but the pattern is being followed so far. Each bounce has fewer and fewer people interested in going long. It's characteristic of an asset that is being liquidated by early investors and bought by newer ones. Once that liquidation ends, the trading dynamic changes drastically, and can include a complete breakdown in the asset price.  That's the doom-and-gloom scenario at least.

No position here, although I'm watching closely.

Edits are for awful, awful typos. 

"Never before"?! No ways
Is there a longer-term chart of short interest in BTC? I'd love to see how it's evolved over time. That combined with the recent volume patterns might shed more light on the coming moves.
Historically I would bet for a short squeeze. Not because of crypto - I mean historical. You always have buyers of value at SOME point, but short squeezes once they start are - brutal.
> bulls all the time

hello there
I'm always bullish.

But I'm no daytrader and have a cost basis of something like $400 per coin. I'm in the green anyway and am quite sure we'll see much higher prices again some time in the (not so far) future. It doesn't really matter what price the ticker shows me today.

If you aren't impressed by gambling rationalised with pareidolia and arcane 'trader' jargon, then you're in the wrong place guy
When you begin to take a lot of losses you think the answer is knowing what the next move is (through ta or whatever) whereas the answer is if you do 30 trades in a row with a 3:1 rr (provided you don't do retarded things like selling rsi 10) you should come out successful. So yeah, it's pretty much admitting you're gambling but with discipline. Easier said than done...
I think people think of the market like sports. Teams playing each other with fixed members, and if one team takes an early lead, it's going to continue to widen from there.

But markets couldn't be more different than sports. There aren't any teams or fixed positions, everyone is emotional and changing their minds all the time. Furthermore, if one "team" scores some points, it doesn't mean that trend will continue forever. Markets are anti-inductive unlike everything else in the world, markets go up until they can come down, then they go down until they can go up.

That being said.... I am a permabull. It's pretty simple why, it's the only asset I can invest in that can't be diluted, and I'm certain other actors will also notice this and make the same decision. The simple ratio of existent dollars to existent bitcoin will trend towards infinity, since the total supply of dollars geometrically grows. It sounds insane to say bitcoin is worth infinity dollars long term, but it seems like a obvious fact to me.
Great question.  I don't short.  Not because I consider myself "a bull" all the time, just because I find shorting too risky a strategy for my personal trading style and due to it's lack of availability on some of the platforms I use.  However, that doesn't mean I have a tribal anti-bear sentiment.  Maybe as I get more experienced and comfortable with my trading I will short in the future.  I'll admit that has made trading difficult for me in the last few months, with limited chances to trade, so I've been favouring shorter term trades with small profit on oversold bounces, locking in modest profits on each trade.  Do you consider that I am "identifying as a bull all the time?".  I would actually think I'm bearish at the moment, because I haven't seen the long term trend change to an uptrend, and the reason I'm only trading bounces for modest profit is because I believe we are still in a downtrend.  Great question to provoke some thought into market psychology though!

I'm a permabull. But I'm not actively trading. I'm holding long term, and buying the dips, based on an informed guess that this technology will be successful in the long run. 

Your experiment disregards fundamentals and is only valid for short term traders.
It depends on what you mean by bullish. If you're just hodling and understand the fundamentals to the best degree possible and believe that Bitcoin has a decent chance at being worth significantly more in the future, then that's what I would refer to as perma-bull and I think that position is easily defended. Same goes with perma-bears, if you think that Bitcoin is ultimately doomed then you're a perma-bear, though I think this position is less easy to defend. 


> Are there seriously people that identify as bulls all the time or bears all the time?

Of course there are, especially bulls.  And the "Buttcoin" crowd are permabears.  



There are people that are perma bulls aka hodlers... we them here all the, there are also perma bears aka no coiners aka nouriel roubini et al. Market movements are not random though.

I'm just glad I had the balls not to close my hugely underwater long. Back up to breakeven.
hindsight's 20/20 my dude, at this point it's just like betting red or black in roulette 
The fakeout should be substantial... Could easily go to 6600 at least.
I'm thinking of layering sells from 6550 to 6650 with stops above 6700 to try and catch that wick.
If it really goes up the loss is not so bad as if i shorted 6500. Of course there might be a wick and i stay out.

Opening positions here should only be attempted by people able to watch the charts all day so that they can manualy stop to prevent being wicked.

And rather than just outright buy your minuscule stash of rapidly devaluing internet tokens, you suspect that they are involved in an elaborate (and expensive) 'FUD' campaign? 

The price couldn't possibly be falling because serious, successful investors like the aforementioned power brokers have zero interest in your funny-money?
It's not "bullish" but a potential setup for a shorts squeeze, that's not the same thing. Until new money comes in and buys the market is not bullish.
Bitmex always have equal amount of shorts and longs.


"BTCUSDSHORTS BTCUSDLONGS - Bitfinex BTC Shorts & Longs"
A short one. LoL.
Let's see we can take it from here 
yup, got a lot of them. 6570 is now short term support
Very very short, and it could even been self-inflicted by closing the first shorts manually instead of new market volume 
There's too much Bitcoin volume, the internet's going down this time for sure!
It was free money for someone. :)
Volume isn't really significant on the Daily and it got rejected around the 10 EMA. I'm going to open a short in a bit. 
Mmmmmm.. 
It will be at 6500 again within 12h 
Need volume on your chart (and diminishing volume through the flag).
Where does the bear flag become an upward channel?  :-p
6850 imo. A lot of shorts at 6500, so if 6600 breaks there may be a nice squeeze.
> They have had months to approve the Square bitlicense. I think it's bullish that it's approved now at this stage in the bear market.

What's your reasoning here, why would the recent price history affect whether or not a specific retail outlet is approved for a bitlicense? Are you suggesting whichever governing body approves those licenses would be saying, "Hmm well the price has fallen too much in the past 6 months so, Square, we deny your application for a bitlicense"?
I think it is quite important how this 12h candle closes. If we end up going down 100 USD in the next 2 hours would be very very bearish, as it opens the possibilty to get very tight bbands below 6.6k with resetted RSIs. 
9k may take a long time mate, perhaps next year. 
I can‚Äôt see a real FOMO in the market before 10k which then include media coverage and normies going at it again. Unless you talk about your own FOMO
What fomo. This will full retrace (and more this week)
Thanks bro. Just to be clear you're joyrider5 and Merlin is still Merlin right?
>a few months

>"always"
Lol rekt
you are going from selling and quitting to selling your stocks and buying the dip if we go to $6k..? over a 5% move? We're up like 3% since yesterday man. 

Stop paying attention to TA on lower time frames. It's all going to be wrong at some point. It's useful for getting better entries, that's it. Some dude's 15m chart is useless in 4 hours. 

So we all need to stop acting like 15m charts posted here are supposed to be useful for more than the next few hours. 

Anyway, just remember how you felt about the bounce from $8300 to $8900, $7040 to $7750, and now $6100 to $6850. 

Feel free to do your own thing, but I encourage you to see things on a longer term time frame if you're going to sell  everything.

A decision made over 15 minutes can be very wrong In 15 minutes. 

If you're looking to sell, you should really base it off longer time frames
It's some funny psychology when people get so excited by a few % move up and the 'HODL till I die' comes back

It's like the massive downward movement we've experienced recently never happened 
Dont listen to sub most people are just shilling their positions.
Since you asked:

"I think going into the $5K's is possible but my guess is that we'll see around $6800 first which is where I'll hopefully exit depending on how we get there."

https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8r83yz/daily_discussion_friday_june_15_2018/e0qprg6/

"this could certainly break down, however someone who is accumulating might just be giving the appearance of a breakdown to encourage people to sell/short so that they can buy into your sells with better liquidity and less slippage."

edit: I should mention that I'm long currently

https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ronjo/daily_discussion_sunday_june_17_2018/e0tg600/

Long from $6,480ish with about 50% of a planned position, will add to this incrementally down to $6,200 as I believe we could range between there and around $6,800. Plan to close somewhere around $6,800 depending on how we get there.

This sub tends to be filled with people who are wrong. When we were near 10k, they voted up, when we were at 6k down.
Not surprised by the small move up right now, the number of shorts kept increasing slowly and this probably triggered a couple SL... I don‚Äôt think we will keep going to tho, imo we will go lower than 6k.
I am bullish in the long term tho 
It hit the 10 EMA on the daily chart with that candle so that was my target to look into opening a short.
tip: You do some TA then do the opposite of what is rational.

went all in at 6420ish
I don't short, but a great trading tip I heard was to learn how to think like a bear and a bull.  As the old saying goes "know your enemy".  It's helped me to be more objective to look at a chart and say "what would a bear do?" even when I've no intention of shorting and I'm looking for a good long entry position.  It keeps your feet on the ground.
You gotta understand the bear's psychology though, they are not bearish because they want the price to go down.  They are bearish because indicators and sentiments made them believe that the price will go down.

Maybe this pump will start changing some people's minds though, who knows.
> Im honestly so tired of bears,

You sound objective. 
Believing the market will go down is one thing, wanting to the market to go down is a totally different thing. Although i hate seeing people get rekt, some of them who took their position a little too far deserve it. Victims incoming
18 up-votes for this? This sub is at its best when objective and posters are providing new information, perspectives on trends and of course, TA. 

I also hope the price goes up, but c'mon. And the 'bears,' for the most part, are just on the betting side that its going down temporarily, most of the time to acquire more bitcoin. 
In fashion this season: Bear skin http://i.imgur.com/EQgOTOC.jpg
I'm curious what % of bears want this asset to go to 0, and what % just want a cheaper entry for their long-term stash. 
You should be a little worried. You're down 30% of your stack. Doesn't mean you should panic close--plenty of reason to hold at the moment, but that's just naive. 
RSI is overbought on the 1hr so you might be ok for a little while.
Wow you should be 

Clearly bull news are appearing from nowhere
With good timing 

Its probably the beginning of √† bull trend
I wish you luck.
You'd better set a stop. Good chance you get liquidated if not.
I would say it is more like when we were at 7.5k, price action up stalls while volume drys up, big sells walls letting people buy into them, etc.
We could definitely get a bounce, but it would unlikely be nearly as large as the April one, not enough shorts opened to fuel it.
A bit, and also similar to 7.5k the other week.  
it's double than yesterday.
[removed]
If volume doesn't increase with a trend it is a weak trend
That's one way to look at OBV - volume confirming/not confirming the trend or a trend reversal.

You can also use it for divergence in the same way of RSI.
Shouldn't the lowest point be the start of any TA?
Ok, thanks!
By this time next year, 6K will look cheap indeed.

I'm waiting for 6850. I'll take the big loss if that breaks though.
The other night, I dreamt Bitcoin dropped to $2200 overnight and my position got liquidated.
Come on mate, seems like you have to sell
Last night I dreamt I didn‚Äôt buy at 20k, it was a nice dream
Once I dreamt Bitcoin started dropping faster and faster, and then quickly fell right to zero because of the huge influx of noob market sells... it sat there for a few seconds to a minute, then the market buys caught up and it shot to over 1.4 million in minutes because of all the noob market buys. Sold at the top and retired. That was a good dream.
until you hit one of those hidden sell walls
Don't read too much into walls. They can be pulled quickly. And sometimes the order book simply represents the overall trend/sentiment as large sellers/traders don't expect for large market buys to come through when buyers can generally just wait for a limit to be filled at a lower price. As such, with a lot more bid side liquidity, the sellers are forced to market sell and don't bother putting in limit orders they don't think will be filled. This dynamic creates the asymmetrical order book, but it doesn't mean that the order book will definitely move towards the side lacking orders.

Damn i didn't realise how much alts have taken a hit today. It does look like they're bottoming out though, I can't seem them dropping much further as of now.

Also, bitcoin doesn't always follow alts , we might go through periods where they are quite correlated but its never guaranteed. Remember the days when alts would tank when bitcoin went on a mini bull-run... good times.

Buying and selling both contribute to volume.

Btc getting pumped into a huge bubble was the only manipulation in this market.. $10k-$20k for something that isn't.. 
I read a comment here of someone getting verified in hours after they submited all the documents or something. 
Yea, bro. I love Hugh Jackman.  What's this gotta do with the market?
For years, this gentlemen posted his model. And for years, it was wrong at predicting bitcoin price by a magnitude on the log scale. I was skeptical when published in 2015 and I still am today. When price of BTC was around 250 for a whole year, the model predicted like 2.6K. 

Quote from 2015
> log(7-day price / model) is -3.7 standard deviations from mean. 28-day average: $2675.

> Price of Bitcoin that day 275. On a serious note. I, and many users in the past have repeatedly debunked this. For this year, the model managed to predict bitcoin above $1K. It is not a model when it completely fails to predict for an extended period for time; in the past and now. If you look at the historical correlation, the two has some resemblance. However, a closer look shows Y axis in log scale. At points back in time, the model produced 1.5> magnitudes higher than spot.

>It misleads those new to bitcoinmarkets, the model sounds legit by publishing source codes and historical threads. Not many will go through the source, but take the outcome as is. [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/3dwp4g/daily_discussion_monday_july_20_2015/ct9fojz/)
Just a question about that: why don't you update the first graph with the recent data. That shouldn't be very complex?! 

As a suggestion, I would think maybe a one year timeframe for the chart would also be interesting. 

But with data two month old this appears just like fearmongering to me..
Yeah, all that high volume buying pressure driving the chart straight sideways /s. Market buy -> sideways -> market buy -> sideways, totally reflective of average Joe buying up BTC. 
> Good job ~~bulls~~ **whale**, that was impressive.

FTFY
Was it though? Maybe a little pump action, but with severely limited follow through. It looks like we are [just forming another bear flag](https://www.tradingview.com/x/gJzdqFN0/).
Oooh don't mention that in this sub, you will get downvoted by the retards who think BTC controls the entire market. 
Neo was the first 
But i am not sure you should trade on this 
Dude, of course man. Who do you think controls Tether? (Tin foils)
Actually, most retailer adoption happened during the 2014-2015 bear market when transactions were fast and cheap. 2017 saw transaction fees explode and some retailers even dropped BTC. In the long run, strong fundamentals will lead to a higher price but there has been no correlation so far.
It happened before so why can't it happen again? There was no substantial adoption back then. Transactions were slow and expensive. Yet it did happen. And yes it will happen again if you believe BTC will still be relevant in the next few years.
The main problem in this sub is that people tend to think in harsh absolutes. "It will never happen. It's a given it happens. It's going to the moon. It's going to zero.". The truth is you don't know. Nobody does. It's a *huge* global unregulated market where hundreds of agendas clash and cross. Anything can happen, if you think about it.

Imagine a Bitcoin ETF is approved in the fall. Imagine a possible hype then. As the most basic example.
I believe because non of things that you stated are what brought us to the previous ath. The way i see it is that the average joe doesn‚Äôt care about the technology or usage, they only care about the price. Last bubble the price going up brought more people in and more hype which got the price going higher and higher, there was no significant technical advancements or anything big as LN, it was pure hype which you‚Äôll be surprised how easily can happen again
So you think the only way BTC can be successful is if it's adopted as a currency? No other use case is realistic or matters?
Not sure why you are getting down-voted for asking a reasonable question.  Maybe add that it's your opinion in the last couple of sentences?
It may take 4+ years, but I think we'll get there again.  Crypto is a trillion dollar network.  I don't care that the current price says otherwise.
Absolutely. Probably will take 3 years but i think it will happen. Bitcoin is very useful even in spite of its technical limitations. Long term need better custodial solutions, ease of use, and yes, scaling. I dont see these being an issue with hitting the next ath though, and they are all being worked on.
I don't think 90% of the people that took us to the ATH cared about any of the things you have mentioned above.

It was all a get rich quick scheme to them, buy at X and sell at Y because others are getting rich. 
I completely agree. Don't think BTC will ever see a new ATH, but I think the flippening and  the crypto market as a WHOLE definitely will. 
A lot of people believe it is "inevitable", as in 100% probability.   I would say less than 50% probability in the next few years.  Of course in 10 years after a couple of halvings and a lot of USD inflation, it could be over 50%.
Probably not, it is likely just the market ensuring there is no free lunch (short=profit). I am sure some 'investors' on high leverage redistributed their money to other traders. 

I mean you never know, but that would be my guess. 

Edit: I have a small long open, so I hope I am wrong, but will exit quickly if this breaks down for a small gain.
>looks just like business as usual to me.  Bart will bring us back to 6350 ish and we are just gonna keep on dancing up and down.  The volume has been super low lately, with the exception of when the pumps like what we just saw come in, and then it's back to low volume and we dwindle back down again.  It's as if those pumps are paramedics using a defibrillator on BTC but the effect wears off and has to be constantly repeated.
1. Make separate accounts

2. A profit limit would be the same as setting a buy limit below your entry price in your case. Same difference. 
5&#37; increase is pretty nice if you were in position lol. Granted only 2.5&#37; over 24hr, but we were down 2.5&#37; before the rally started.

Generally: Exchanges are interlinked via arbitrage done by - arbitrageurs. As long as you can make money by buying on exchange A and selling on B, the pressure WILL spread.

For a market to be isolated, there must be no or little arbitrage opportunity. For a long time, Korea was like that - because while you could sell in Korea, moving the funds out was (is?) a paperwork nightmare.

This is, though, not the case on Bitmex. I can always move tether out to another exchange.

nah

that is not a fractal
I guess it's possible to have a rally up to where that downtrend line converges with the bottom of the symmetrical triangle. It also aligns with topping out on July 6th theory. But that's a major stretch, and if all the stars align perfectly.
Can you be more specific?
You can say the same about the bears. Whatever suits your position which is short I presume

Just because he made some bet that bitcoin would drop to a certain amount this year he constantly says his bearish comments.

He is so pissed that ETH was deemed not a security that he talks shit about it constantly.

I can say with 100% conviction that we would never have seen the ATH we did without ETH.

He doesn't realise that BTC needs other cryptos to keep growing and I'm not talking about 90% of the ERC20 shitcoins, there really are a few that have real world use cases.

People were waiting on the sidelines for the resistance to break up or down. We broke the resistance and people bought in.

If it would have broken downward we would have seen the same spike but down. 

It's just a market that don't know where to go.
Right? I mean I havent seen the space this ¬´certain¬ª that we are going down ever.... if the market truly wants to fuck over everyone it should shoot up. Leaving every trader in despair. The ones who have been holding since 20k will not sell on a drop to 3k frem here?



Edit: Im a total noob when it comes to trading btw... (2yrs holding aprox) just my 2cents
Perhaps the miners just see it as an alternative way of accumulating btc and not in hurry to sell.
Hashrate efficiency does not matter. The supply will halve.

If hashrate goes up, the system adjusts - trying to keep 10 blocks per hour. Period. Now, it noramlyl makes a little more because hashrate DOES go up and the average based mechanism is trailing.

But point is, the supply is constant - more hashrate does nothing else than change the distribution of BTC among miners.

But the halving is different. The halving will half the BTC / block. Independent of hashrate. Suddenly the supply halves.
Do you understand how mining efficiency impacts supply?  


(Hint: it doesn't)

Target would be previous support trendline (7230) or volume node (7550). A short could be risked at the target with a stop loss at the higher high of 7751.
lol was gonna say the same 
Yeah I admit I did, this was after I closed my long this morning and had convinced myself that it was going to drop so confirmation bias kicked in. 


Although I'd agree, I'd say a good portion were also long and still looking for upward movements in the 7k region.

Currently feels like the majority went short after that last drop 
It's Bittfinex so sure it can be spoofed. UTC midnight only is 4 hours away. Chances are we close higher than 6.5.

>Hilarious. Report by banks directly threatened by Bitcoin

Even more hilarious is suggesting that banks are "threatened" by Bitcoin. This tired meme died years ago. In the event Bitcoin becomes large enough to have any appreciable impact on global finance, banks will just use it to make money like they do with everything else. 
I agree with you, but currency coins are closer to adoption because of less legal hurdles associated with them (such as being labeled as securities by the SEC). They'll pave the way for the more advanced platform coins that will eventually replace them.
heh, indeed. Stalled under 6800 too. I think someone saw longs/shorts at parity and decided to flip the poker table upside down.
True, could happen. Well, if we're going to 20K again, I can still jump back in when we reach 10K. ;-)
I am now down -65% since march this year. Would have been -40% if i didn't play around with trading.
lol that sounds kinda bleak.
From what I can see, it's third in daily BTC/USD volume and 4/5th (depends which website aggregate) in overall crypto value volume.

It's also the highest volume platform that uses USD pairing, not USDT. Unless I'm missing something?

I'd have thought that there's enough volume on Bitfinex for it to be representative enough. Market spread seems quite tight (1-1.5&#37;?) at the moment. Volume on the exchanges appears to have been dropping at the same rate across the board as well.

What exchanges do you think I should additionally be looking at?
Well... Many non-speculative buys and dumps go through Finex...
It's better to ask questions and learn from experienced people actually willing to give insightful answers than to go into it completely blindly and learn at the cost of your entire bank roll.
it could also have just been 1000 shorts closing, they didn't necessarily have to be stopped out 
it's actually 1000+ shorts and accounts for more than half of the volume.
This is my theory of the market condition - MM sets up a buy and sell wall and absorb the retail traders positions for awhile.  If there is a lot of sell into the bids, MM will pump the price proportionately after some time (now all retail buyers are buying back higher).  Conversely, if there are moderate buys into the asks, MM will dump forcing retail traders to sell back lower.

Unless there is sufficient volume from retail, I guess we will be forced into these tight consolidation range for awhile.  I guess this is why TA still seems to work on a longer time frame while the short term is pretty much gambling atm.  
Haha fair enough.
They all decided to do it at the same time?
Yup, very possible. Also possibly spoofy. Although spoofy usually fucks with 1000 btc so that probably isn't all him. 

It's up to 3700 now. 
3500 now lol, really the biggest $100 spread wall I've ever seen I think 
 
tbf that 1250 wall at $17250 on GDAX was the fiat equivalent of...~3211 btc here. üòµü§Ø
only kobayashi trades same amounts of btc and bcash. maybe it's him bought back. 
Push the price up into sell walls so that it can be pushed down again and take profit from shorting.
Could be manipulation to get a massive short filled.

Could be people pulling their buy orders from $6.3k and below and putting them higher because they don't think it'll get there. 

When the price ranges in a small range people start to pull orders off the books and take matters into their own hands.

Wall is now up to 3900 btc. Either some big insider news gonna come out or someone is spoofing hard lol 
fraud or not its bullish.  Maybe this dead dog will bounce one more time before the final plunge.


Me too, don't necessarily think it's big manipulation but I honestly think it turns out the same either way. 
Not what I meant. That just slowly stretched them.
Yeah, you're right it is less mind bending to do it the other way around!
He said we would never get below 6500
If you change targets all the time there was a time where you were right.
He's actually trying to say that people manipulating the market won't let the price fall that hard cause they will lose CME because of that.
Absolutly nothing. People think every 6 there is a bottom/top, but it's total bullshit
https://www.tradingview.com/x/VAjwf0cw/
Absolutely, this is still a great point to DCA into a position.  You will generally never get the utmost bottom of course, so I don't mean to dissuade anyone from accumulating more at these prices.  But if you're out there degen'ing on Bitmex like myself, don't crank up the leverage to 100x and go all in quite yet.

Personally, I think we're going quite a bit lower ($3000~), though there is a ton of strength at the $6000 range.  Every time we touch it, we bounce pretty strong off of it.  But, the more times we touch it, the weaker those bounces are going to be.  If volume doesn't start improving soon, we will most likely dump past that range.  Where we stop after that, is anyone's guess.

Edit:  I want to clarify as well, that while I think we go down quite a bit further in the short term, I am still long term very bullish on BTC.  I do think we'll be back close to or at ATH within a year or so.  The market moves very fast when it decides on a direction, and cryptocurrency is still one of the latest buzzwords, so as soon as people start flocking back to it, it's off to the races again.
cool ;-)
Read your name as Hotsoccermom, was disappointed after a second look
i was actually thinking 5m ago that everyone being wildly bearish was just getting too much again, just annoying how it seems counter trading the majority works so well. we'll see if it keeps going up I guess, if that's the end of the push then meh
yup, if that was it then it's like "meh" 

not a huge change in margin positions- 1k in shorts closed, bout 200 longs. 7k btc in volume
Unfortunately it's mainly because I am simply waiting for the breakdown for $6k to be very profitable for a short and I don't want to wait for the breakdown to happen because it'll feel odd shorting so low. Only thing is I've been waiting for like 3-4 months now lmao. 

I'll certainly take your advice to heart because it's good advice but I missed my chance to close (I think) 

I think what frustrates me most is that I have the discipline to open good entries but never close them, even though I get roughly the same *feelings* on when to close. I was super close to closing my swaps  (~20%) but didn't follow through. 

Anyway, I just really want to hit my target before taking a break. It's just taking *forever*. 

I'm not burnt out yet, but the sooner this move comes the better. Part of me being exhausted has to do with my personal life kind of asking for a break for BTC :P 

But thanks, I really appreciate it. Will consider it if we make another move up here for sure

Also my targets are more like $4.5-5k but I have some take profits at $5.5. Perhaps that's not worth the wait :P 

Maybe you're right that I should just reduce position size and wait the rest of it out 
Also i did close my short at around $8k. I re shorted a smaller amount up to $8.8k. Then unhedged and longed up to $9.6k. Shorted there, it went back up to $9990 and I added but closed cause pussy...

than shorted hard again on the way down when I realized it was likely a big ol short squeeze. 

So  I did take some profits on it. I'm up more than I would've been if I had held thru the whole thing but you're right that I could be up like some ridiculous amount if I took profits 
definitely broke the bear pennant. Something I didn't note is that we got to the end of it. Although it was a perfect pennant, "finishing" a pattern like that means it often doesn't play out. 

Not sure where we go from here. Personally thinking shorting here with SL above $6850 isn't bad

Definitely not trying to sound like a dick but this drives me crazy, personally. I really wish people would either state the timeframe they're using or post a chart / link.
Yes, that's what I meant, thanks. I edited. It's been sitting above 70. for a few hours now with no movement down. I don't know what to think about it.
How about now that the OP crossed out the word oversold and replaced with overbought? :) 
We seem okay for now, keep an eye on the big buy walls.

If they disappear then I'd start worrying. 
exactly there was 3 green hour candle preceding it. 
Where was it from then?
waiting for the dump......

.....still waiting
hmm, degenerate gambler lifestyle?
That's cup and handle :D
Looks like instead of shorters jumping to conclusion and screaming goblin town, they were unsure of the price action and they slowly started to short, as you can tell by the chart because it gradually increased 
You think its time to hit the capitulation period and watch a fuckload of shorts get squeezed when the bottom (at least for the time) is found? Breaking about 4K would seriously scare people since most think 5 will hold for at least a while. Or do you think they're going to just climb as we go sideways and shorts go up as everyone is expecting a leg down?
Could be similar, but Bitcoin could be the Amazon whereas ICOs are the other dot coms that failed. I say this is closer to 2001 than it is the 2014 bitcoin bubble
Please show me on the NASDAQ chart where it "limped" before dropping another 40%.
Not that I know of.

But there is a poster here that follows the shorts and long positions on the CME and CBOE. 

Results shows that pro traders are taking the short side on both platform
Fact is, you can see from the charts that we've clearly got a double inverse hotdog with mustard going on here, meaning that we're looking at a graveyard loop de loop at 6300, which will take us down a Fibonacci helix with support levels at 5200, 4700, and 3500 (assuming we don't hit a nacho asset flip at 5500, maybe 5600 if it's got extra salsa but don't quote me on this). However, there's a Mortal Kombat triangle at 7200 that would cause us to consolidate in the 7300 - 7800 range unless we ran into a triple Bart Simpson fluctuation...

This book has never been more relevant to this sub than it has in the last week.
BTW, I have an affiliate program link that supports moonmath, should anyone want to buy this book. DM me, so as not to break sub rules.
Lol no I was thinking about whether some secret cabal of bulls and bears locked in eternal battle exist, as described in reddit comments, and the illusion of control article I read last week popped into my head.
I generally only bet black. I never bet red. 

Red is goblin town. Where months of despair and depression arise from the abyss to make crypto holders depressed. 

Black is the galaxy, where multiple moons glisten in the sky. 

Should have went all in on black. 
That's a theoretical $500 target and around 24h to the end of triangle. Even if it breaks up it's probably gonna be sold into and dragged down by shorters like last time.
[deleted]
Although he's probably be the Sheriff of Nottingham in disguise.
it's pretty obvious considering:  


\- the influx of new traders asking how to short on X or Y  
\- the growth in shorts AFTER we broke down below 7k. 

  
I'm not sure how it works when people add to their shorts and if this count's as additional positions or if they somehow get calculated into this chart (guy x is already short so no additional count)   


Just like a lot of people Fomo'd in at 16k and above, we're probably witnissing a lot of the same behavior but shorting the bottom now
Well, I can't be 100% sure of course, but as far as I've observed the number of shorts increased gradually after the triangle broke down.
I'm not sure if 5.8k is a great target for a short right now.
It's a reference to the bubble chart everyone hates
Good trade bro. Taking profits never hurts lol. All the best for the next trades. Cheers!
who are Bogdanoff? Can you give me a quick run down?
I'm trying to understand...

Short/long ratio increasing while price remains stable, means that even with borrowed money the price does not let itself be forced lower. Why would this _not_ be bullish?
Yep, those shorts could potentially be the rocket fuel for next squeeze. All it needs is an igniter in the form of big market buy orders. Bear in mind, also applies for the longs when going down.
Thank you.
now I know its going to rally to 7100 at least..
I agree.  A front run of those targets should happen from those taking profit early while flipping to shorts.
>I read it that he's implying that news is used to manipulate the market, often to allow individuals and/or institutions to get into the market at a low price.  The insinuation being that the sensational negative headlines of late were used to push the price lower to allow said buyers to buy cheap BTC and now that they have bought in and are in positions, positive news is coming out to push the price up for those buyers.  Hence the bullish news re: BTC and ETH not being securities and now the issuing of the Square bitlicence. 
In one year we had volatility of $3000-20,000 in all directions. 9k doesn‚Äôt seems that far to me 
I mean, I‚Äôm looking at 2020 and 2022 as possible selling points, or spending. 
back to 20k?

Yes I am /u/joyrider5, proof on my twitter: https://twitter.com/joyrider50/status/999774124259004416 I lost control over my account so will be posting on this one for now on.  :)
>If you're looking to sell, you should really base it off longer time frames

Word. The amount of times I lost money for not sticking to the plan. I cancelled low buy orders out of impatience that would of filled if I'd waited a week. I'm underwater a long from 7k but I'm holding that until the 6th July, regardless what happens. It's easy to trade off this sub. Don't. People are wrong here A LOT, even the big traders with experience.

Take everything on face value, don't believe the hype, trade on the hourly and beyond.
That's great advice that's too easy to forget.
That sounds like a poor strategy.  More long positions close than short positions open in most cases.  So I guess your "enemy" is fellow holders who are long and who are selling for whatever reason.
Once they are in position, they want the price to go down as much as buyers want the price to go up.
I disagree that bears on this sub are not trying to knock the price down.  They are trying to create the sentiment to make it happen.
The permabulls are very butthurt at this point...to the point they are bleeding heavily out of their backsides.  So they want some kind of abstract "revenge", but they are likely not going to get much.
Nobody wants it to go to 0. But if it could go from 7k to 5k to 7k to 5k to 10k to 7k to 12k I'd be pretty happy 
Doesn't mean it's his full stack tho 
What bull news?
That seems likely to be true but price is going down so if he's long thats not particularly helpful
To keep the symmetric triangle, it requires cutting the wick of the low point at 6100 so then I guess that wouldn't be valid anymore either and already broken down considering your point about the low.
Np
Damage mitigated, smart SL
Okay... so that would be take-profit market orders from margin longs?
Yes agree, those walls are usually not supposed to execute - and I guess the most common goal is the psychological effect. Lets see... it is still there now
We're going to say good bye to Bart pretty soon.  Failure to Bart will be a bullish signal indeed.
Upvoted for good use of italics.  

And I happen to agree with what you said.
We have literally bounced off the 6k range 2 times before, both times we were in a downtrend before that. Both times you got 60% and 40% returns from buying in the 6k range. Right now we are down ~70% from the ATH. This is generally where bubbles tend to stabilize, at least in other markets and all previous non-crypto bubble examples. I seriously dont get the bear mentality here. I dont see the bear master reference plan... $1 bitcoin?
right.... theres always that like megaaaaaaaaa dump before the trend shifts.....  
No, my plans won't change. I will be closing this with a hefty profit.  Might take a couple weeks but probably not.

Or hey, maybe you know something I don't.  Maybe you and your buddies are about to dump 50K BTC at a huge loss just to drive the price down for a few hours.  Either way, I'm closing with a big ass profit because any moronic, irrational toddler dumps will be bought up fast.  
A lot if you're a bearish skeptic.
If his own COMPANY is providing some positive news about a PRODUCT (BTC) then why wouldn't it cause the spike.

Same as as some old turd stating some FUD which will cause the price to drop. 
>  I can't seem them dropping much further as of now.

We've barely seen the beginning of the altcoin culling that should be the next 2 years. 
**For clarification:** Bitcoin doesnt follow altcoins but when people are done selling/ dumping their alts then they might dump their BTC for some tether / fiat as many alts are traded with BTC not fiat. Its not guaranteed though.
I remember that non-correlation period, still don't know why that was and why we haven't seen it anymore.
> Damn i didn't realise how much alts have taken a hit today

Thats because they have barely taken a hit. Almost none of the top 100 are in double digit red and the vast majority are in low single digit losses.
Neither, I'm waiting to see what happens when I wake up tomorrow (I'm PST so it's only 2:21 pm atm). It hit the 10 EMA on the daily and got rejected there but the volume on the 4hr is looking good enough to where it may push up to around $6.9k where the 100 EMA is right now. 
It really is. Try moving money from a bank to an exchange. It will take a lot longer than an hour. Anyway, all my recent sends have happened within ten minutes and been ridiculously cheap. OP is doing something wrong, I reckon.
He‚Äôs been trading cryto long enough to speak with authority.
fuck me, you're right.

Took of that shitty wick and we get 3 touches on the bottom of triangle. nicely spaced out too

edit: shuffled the top a little bit too and its a lot cleaner now. https://www.tradingview.com/x/tr351v4K/
thanks
For something that isn't what?
I would agree with you except that for a future global currency that only has 21 mill total supply $20k is nothing. I can see this reaching 10 to 20 million or even more in upcoming 10 to 20 years, if everything goes well with the market. US stock market has a 30 trillion market cap. But crypto market is global so I can see this easily rivaling or even passing that marketcap. 
Thanks mate. Someone from my peers is awaiting for a much longer time, I will advise opening a support ticket. 
You're joking, right?
I was very critical of the model as well, thinking price points were way too high. Interestingly, the price points it once predicted seem so low now lol
So this guy been posting for years...and used to predict something multiple times higher than its price. 

Now he's predicting a price a bit lower than our current...interesting.
Yes /u/_supert_ to be convincing you need to at least present a favourable correlation coefficient in comparison to a) a simple exponential model exp(xt) like aesop uses for the rainbow charts on www.moonmath.win; and b) a piecewise constant model that predicts that the price tomorrow/next week/whenever will be the same as the price today. Sadly, I doubt very much that the tx model is better than either. 
So, it actually predicted it was undervalued. 
Number is up to date, just not graph. I'll update before next week.
Didn‚Äôt downvote, but it literally is the whole market
*tin foils*

Joseph Kony.
BTC'S fundamentals were great in 2016, and they got better into 2017. Lots better. 2014-early 2017 is when institutional money entered 
Bitcoin probably had one shot to grab retail adoption and it failed horribly.  It probably won't get another one, at least not in the next several years.

And it is peak retail adoption, probably 0.000000001% of retailers accepted it.  So it was a massive FAIL, even at its best.

As long as gyft.com and egifter.com accepts it, I can use BTC to buy quite a lot, so I hope that doesn't' change.
> The main problem in this sub is that people tend to think in harsh absolutes.

Always an obvious sign of low intelligence. 

And "You don't know.  Nobody does" is just about as dumb a thing to say.  Have you ever heard of "probabilities"?
Bubbles don't occur for no reason. Fortunately btc isn't just a big ponzi scheme- at one point or another people legitimately believed in it. It simply will very likely not bubble again without fundamentals to back it up. The majority of retail willing to speculate has bought in - all these posts about going to the moon and btc at $1mm are based on fundamentals valuations in which btc *does* explode and finds massive global adoption. 

Expecting the price to bubble simply because people think it will is, imo, a misunderstanding of the conditions that got us to bubble in the first place

There needs to be another wave of truly great news for BTC to see it bubble again- it's hard to see how anyone can currently disagree with this. 

There is virtually no reason for the price to continue to go up right now. The fundamentals are currently attempting to catch up to the price, there's no real reason to think the price will continue to run away from fundamentals after the hype bubble popped
The price isn't what is attractive about bitcoin.  Neither is the tech at this point.  It's the inflation rate that is grabbing so much attention.  Everyone keeps losing sight of this.  USD prints 220B a year.  Gold, mined at a rate of 190B a year.  Bitcoin, at current prices, is $4B a year.  Anyone that can do basic math can see which system has the most opportunity to rise in value more.
Which use cases are you thinking of?
Because people here like to bury their heads in the sand 
Yes. Ethereum with its 7 tps will take us to the promise land. 
Do not short right now.
Well. . If you are sure why don't you short
Cheers mate. So Basically you confirming they merge your positions - bit retarded but anyways
Thanks, and I am still a bit puzzled how Bitmex works... Lets say a market sell order of 1.000.000 BTC is executed on BM, will that drive down the price on Bitfinex (and pass to the other exchanges)?
Bitmex uses tether?
Are you saying that because the two cycles are not similar enough? In both cases, I see an uptrend followed by an upthrust after distribution, followed by 2.5 relief rallies on the way down. Now I'm seeing the second (bigger) bounce off support that may lose steam soon.

Not much upside here, I admit, even if it does play out.
Yeah, I feel like everyone thinks I'm super bullish now, but I expect the pink uptrend line that it bounced off at $6000 in February and $6400 in April to be re-tested at some point before we continue further down. A rally to $7500 within the next month is not unreasonable, and the fact that I'm getting downvoted without any counterarguments honestly makes me more likely to believe this may play out.

I still think this 6th of the month thing is a sham though. I shared my observation of this fact right after the May 6th dump, but of course it stopped working once everyone started calling for the "June 6th reversal!"
I noticed that 2.236 trend fibonacci time extension on impulse waves marks shift in sentiment usually in btc, last time major point like that occured was couple of months ago and price spiked 1k in a day.. so maybe it spikes again but i doubt it because of 50 week MA
there were reasons to be bullish some months ago!
I volunteer to go logging in Siberia.

Im long already. Im just trying to be objective here you insecure homosapien.
any more smart remarks?
I was thinking drugs.  Not joking.  But too much trading can be just as bad! ;)
On finex it was but 50 bucks
Makes sense. A spike in oil prices is one of the best indicators of dollar weakness.
It takes literally 2 minutes to open the charts and look.

This sub can't handle the fact that there may be anything else linked to the price and could give indicators.

Some people think Bitcoin rules everything, fuckin hell even Alts can affect the price of Bitcoin but nooo that's wrong too because people don't want to hear anything other than their own opinion.
We can always long without worrying about being liquidated. Been doing it for years with no stops and haven't been liquidated once. It's all about using low leverage and doing it at times when you can collect the short tax.
Not all are in circulation. 
There aren‚Äôt 21m in circulation 
If we priced based on 21m coins then we move 100 years forward in time.
With current circulation that would be around 5848 usd. Actually even if it does go under 100b mcap, I would personally be inclined to take the risk and assume that it won't stay long there. But long is relative, and this being a textbook bubble...
Assuming 100% BTC market dominance.  Edit: oops, context was already btc marketcap not global.  
I assume you're leveraging your entire net worth on this then? 
It was a lot bigger couple minutes ago ;-)

Maybe I'm stupid but it behaved exactly like stop hunting. Didn't think it'll bounce up to 6.8 though.
I may be stupid but not insane.
Also think about what kind of time frame the investment is for. Are you trying to make money in a matter of months, or are you think in terms of years?

Don't neglect other more traditional investments either (stocks etc). 
No worries, I'm a relative noob myself :) Not sure if you are long term holding or trading here but I also bought at 14K :O I'm long term holding and swing/day trading whenever an opportunity presents itself.  I DCA'd my holds at 9K and again at 7K to take the sting out of my 14K purchase.  But I try to park those long term holds as a separate compartment in my head to what I'm doing in my day/swing trades - otherwise I find myself tempted to fomo in order to compensate for that 14K buy.   When you have that desperation to correct that, it can affect rational decision making.  For my shorter term trades I was playing short term oversold bounces on the way down and making a modest percent gain on each trade before going back to fiat until the next opportunity cames along.  It worked up till now, but the bounces are getting smaller and requiring lower RSI's to bounce with each one so I am being more cautious and waiting to see what the market is up to so I can evaluate if I need to change strategy.  You'll find what works for you I'm sure, just keep at it!
I didn't say anything about a year ago, I said last year.

And three times next to nothing can still be next to nothing.


it's one dude.

1. place bunch of ure own sell orders at different prices on the sell side of the order book
2. fomo buy your own bitcoins
3. profit from liquidations

It is usually one or two big orders, so it isn't "people" making these big moves up or down.  It is often just one person.   The rest of the time, people don't move the price significantly.
prescient observation trading padawan, nice ;)
Not 10 blocks per hour, but 6.
Efficiency meaning the amount that is mined for the same overall effort.

By todays standard, if it costs me 5k to mine a bitcoin, at the time of the block halving all things remaining the same on the tech front it will then cost me 10k.

If bitmain release a miner 3-4 times as efficient the coins will be mined equal to or faster than, today.

Sure, we're limited to 21 million coins. But the halving is about the difficulty / time to mine? And people are HODLing based on that. Which might be a pointless exercise.

Unless I'm reading this wrong of course.
nothing against you but when I saw that comment and a few others in response to someone else suggesting we might go up it got me worried. probably just confirmation bias though.

idk it's getting annoying how easy it is to counter trade the majority of this sub, seems a little silly considering this sub isn't the entire market 

but to be very fair, we haven't really gone up *that* much. it's just on shorter time frames it seems like someone is actively trying to squeeze this sub up and down repeatedly lol
Trading since we went bear has cost me for sure, but I'd be twice as badly off now had I not been alt-hopping the bull market and done a 4x in BTC terms before everything went to shit.

The way I see it, this clusterfuck has been a great, if expensive, lesson in risk management. 
I'm sorry to hear.  The only thing I could say is to trade on a longer time frame if swing trading is not working out.  Also, always have a stop loss (and make sure you execute it if it's a mental one), that way you don't have those runaway underwater positions.  I hope you start recovering soon, bro.
Closed/stopped - same thing imo. Could be a take-profit or stop-loss, but high prob it is a stop-loss
Or more volume from anywhere, does not have to be retail. Think this is what coinbase and gemini are going after. 
I can't tell if we're about to see 7200 or 6200 :P

edit: may exit my short position at b/e here. 
if I recall correctly, in late march or early april, he(they) were doing the same spoofing on the sell side with the biggest wall Ive seen 8000BTC around  6900-7000. Not sure whats the end game here, they might try to make traders gain confidence just to dump on us once again.  
Guess some made their mind up on which way this pennant was going to go.
You think we're going into the $2k's? What kind of timeframe you talkin?
Not when he says "we'll never see 6500 ever again"
Isn't the volume on CME so pitiful that it would be counterproductive to burn money propping up BTC in a high volume market to support positions on a low volume market?

Tbh wasn't expecting it'll break up like that.
Looks like a lot of SL above that triangle.
Look at that resistance...

Volume can be wash traded on Bitfinex as well. 
Usually I don't also, but I see patterns. Usually when a wall that was there for hours just disappears it means it's gonna move down short-term.
Specially with Ichimoku, since you can have completely different behaviors depending on the Time frame and on the settings you are using.
Once it pumps like that, it probably consolidates for awhile if it's done pumping. If there's no leg left, there is a possibility of a bart down after awhile. I've seen fuckery where it dumps and then repump almost immediately in the past few weeks, but not the other way around so much.
>I rarely do look at them, but maybe I should.  I always figure they can disappear and reappear in and instant so don't know if I trust them.  Where do you check them? on mex?
You mean the 20 mil cuz the market is surely robust so you can buy with confidence buy wall?
Volatility breakout into short squeeze. I actually posted a set up to watch 9 hours ago and then came back and said people should set stop orders about an hour ago. Not tooting my own horn, just saying this wasn't an out of nowhere move.
Yup
I thought you didn't believe in charting positions ;)
So, what would make shorts increase? 

A pump to 6700-6800 being rejected?

For they to rise if we break down it would have to be a massive dump plunging through 6K.
I honestly don't know. I'm bearish, but I'd be surprised by anything under $4K. I'd actually consider throwing additional fiat into the mix under $5K.
In April when shorts were at ATH, if i remember correctly shorts just kept building and building while we'd have little legs further and further down, not straight free falling. Eventually we chopped around the bottom for a few days while shorts remained high and then booom.
Once you strip away the impact of speculation on price appreciation, you still have other reasons for it. In terms of Amazon, revenues are rising - with AWS, they are soaring. There's fundamental support for higher price.  What's the equivalent for crypto? Everything I've heard tells me that it's linked to adoption. The more people transacting with it, the more utility it has and the higher value people will place on it.  

I don't yet see an unstoppable upward trend in adoption. If and when I do, then I'll join your camp.  And if there are other fundamentals to support higher crypto prices that I'm not considering, please point them out to me.  I'm still basically a newbie in this space.

This could very well just be because they are hedging mechanisms for pro traders.

damn I wish I had known when I snagged it a couple months ago. 
Ah I didn't even consider that red inherently opens the portal to goblin town.. yeah you messed up bad
Breaks that only happen at the end of the formations seems almost "forced" breaks and not as hard as a break mid formation.


It only helps it it hits my SL and i'm forced to buy, until then i'll be helping it slow down.
The y-axis is the number of coins. So adding to your positions does increase this value.
That's a difference of 8%. With a lev of 2 you have 16% profit. I'd say that's nice. If you think the pennant will break down it isn't a bad short at all.
That's what I am saying. 
Because it's always short lived and doesn't allow for a higher high basically. Can ignite a mid-term (few weeks) upward swing tho. But not a major trend reversal.
Because the price does not let itself be forced higher either. 

It works both ways. 
because shorts and longs are not the entire market. someone could plan on selling 100k btc in two days, you never know. 

30k btc is not anywhere near the actual amount of supply waiting to be sold 
Oh, sorry I didn't read your post correctly. The indicator shows BITFINEX not Bitmex.
17-18 was a mania. The craze is fizzling out. The next 6-12 months could be more calm, leading to another mania afterwards.
I say 2021 is the better choice. Post-halving years have seen quite impressive rallies, and finding a price near the peak shouldn't be too hard. (Full disclosure, this is coming from the guy that thought $8000 was the peak for 2017. Boy, was I wrong.)

Anyways, there's no guarantee and two events don't make a pattern, but I would advice anyone that's looking to "cash out" in the next few years to see if they can hold until mid to late 2021.
no back to <= 6400s
This shit is literally all about patience. Which is funny because I'm an extremely impatient person. 

Whenever I start to feel impatient I remind myself of Harvey holding his short for like 8 months waiting for his target. 

And another quote I like where someone said "I trade less than more because it means I have less chances to be wrong" 

It's so true. Most objective, unemotional people here have a good grasp on the market direction- but they get it wrong on shorter time frames. That's why I am so stubborn and patient. So my short term incorrect predictions don't take away from the profits on my long term predictions being correct
I'm underwater long myself aswell which is why i contemplated selling for so long.   


At the moment I have only profits on the line (a lot of it though) so selling here would put me slightly above break even, and it could provide me a better oppertunity to buy in again.  2 weeks ago i assumed 3/4k as a much much more likely scenario. Right now after bears failing to push us down below 6.1 for over a week? not so much. Hence my above statement. The last big move up just made it much more convincing to me personally.  

I have no enemies at all actually.  I find the tribalism in Crypto really silly.  We will all be a seller at some point and we will all buy/sell at different times.  I think perhaps you misinterpreted what I meant.  When I said "know your enemy" it was just a turn of phrase to explain that you should be able to see both sides objectively, hence why it's in quotes.  I'm quite happy with my strategy at the moment, I am not confident to short in the current conditions and so I will not force myself to trade things I'm not comfortable doing.  That's what works for me.  I was building up my confidence with small wins on oversold bounces, which worked up until a couple of weeks ago.  Now I'm being patient and sitting on my cash until this chopping about picks a direction.  It might be a terrible strategy for you, but we are all at different levels of our trading journey here and this works for me.  I am also a "fellow holder" since I have invested separately in addition to the trading I do.  So, no "fellow holders" are not my enemy, no one is.  
That's just plain old human psychology, AKA greed.
Aren't bulls basically doing the same thing in the sub?
Yeah, I honestly am mentally removing the word "bears." It could easily be the other way around.

Just some sort of intelligent discourse OR be funny and lighten the mood if its boring. 

BUT, I don't think its going to be boring much longer. Seems like we got a move coming.
I'm 5x short 100 contracts from 6110. Not sweatin it bro

Jack Dorsey said/did something bullish just like he has daily for months but this one mattered. Didn't you see?

Definitely nothing to do with the substantial rise in shorts with flat BTC. 
Some random cash app adds BTC trading which are in reality just futures..
It's allowed to cut wicks that were short lived, so symmetrical can be valid here. But doesn't really matter, both suggest down in TA terms.
I actually had it at break-even since it coincided with a decent % over the triangle (on Sept futures), but took about $20 of slippage. Still, I'll take it.
On Bitfinex you can place limits that don't show in the order book for an increased fee.
You talk like there's some sort of collective bear mentality that wants to collaborate to kill BTC.  There is no "plan".  This is a market, like any other market, and when people don't have use for, or have reason to believe that the asset is overvalued, they won't buy it.  Realize that this isn't some grand scheme being orchestrated by the collective hive mind of the bears, and while yes, there is market manipulation, there is also still no practical use for BTC for most people.  It's main use is trading to accumulate, trading to make fiat, or holding with the hope of value appreciation.  If it is not appreciating in value, many investors simply won't buy, volume falls off (like it has been since December), which means less people are buying it, which means prices will continue to fall.

What's needed, is more investors, more practical use, or more FOMO to raise prices. 
Here's what's different from last time:

1) We're now way below 50 Week MA

2) We've broken the low around 6400's

3) We've broken the meme triangle
Traditionally everything I have read looks at \~80&#37; retracement from ATH, 70&#37; is being generous, and most recent percent swings from ATH to ATL in other markets like gold and so forth sometimes go lower. 
if you are going to buy up "childish" dumps, then you should probably also be selling the upbarts.

And I agree with u/KingVW, you are too emotional about your trades.
All your comments are pretty emotional. 
>  I will be closing this with a hefty profit.

ok
Last year at this time we dropped 20 percent in  30 days and THEN the bull run started.
If you wait a few weeks you're more likely to be selling at sub 6k rather than over 7k
Love this.
If you mean me being bearish, I've a five digit long open since 7k which is still underwater and I'm not closing because I'm bullish right now.

I'm skeptical which is fair enough all things and recent price action considered. Not bearish.
Bitcoin isn't a new feature for the Cash app. They've had that in there for a while. 
I meant short-term as in literally the next few hours.
Happened when we had good news/sentiment about bitcoin and everyone would sell their alts and jump on bitcoin for the ride up, then redistribute back to the alts. Ahh i miss those days.
sounds like you are looking for shorts
So have I, and I agree with the guy to whom you're responding.
>  for a future global currency that only has 21 mill total supply

It's not going to be a global future currency. The governments will kill that idea and any idea that threatens them before you open your eyes in the morning. Wait for a new fud soon, followed by a huge dump..    
    
And it's not efficient. It's slow and expensive.   
   
It' an investable and tradeable asset.
I think a 200 day EMA will work just fine.
What is the correlation coefficient with exponential model?
Thats what I meant. Thanks.
first batch of tether coincides with 2012 presidential campaign
I agree that the fundamentals are good and I'm a BTC maximalist. But there is no correlation that suggests good fundamentals = higher price or vice versa, or at least the component that he was talking about (transaction fees and retailer adoption). 
I think there wasn't much good news during the run. Bitcoin cash was bad news. Slow transactions were bad news. The flippening narrative was bad news. The China ban was bad news. The ETF rejection was bad news. Merchants stopping adoption was bad news. None of it seemed to matter. Literally the only good news was the official establishment of futures.

Now we are in a bear market with good news. Institutions are setting up trading desks. Big stock exchanges want in. Ethereum is not security so the market as a whole is safe from SEC interference on the big players. Lightning network has a beta testnet that actually works. Segwit activation is at an ATH and transactions on chain are the cheapest they've been. There is bad news in the claim of price manipulation but I looked at the paper and wasn't convinced of much evidences 

I agree with you that the pool of risky young millennial men got tapped out... but I doubt that's the end of it. Huge good news would be something like an ETF acceptance and that could kick off the next bull run as portfolios diversify through trusted instruments. I still think we could have a double bubble this year but I'm much less hopeful... but eventually it will happen. There's too much potential good news in the pipe.
If BTC were to pump over fundamentals, real adoption, usage and growth it wouldn‚Äôt be a bubble it would be growth. Last year was a bubble fueled mainly by air. As stated by the other comments, it was mostly bad news when it went parabolic and the fees and transactions times were almost unbearable. The new money didn‚Äôt cared, the media didn‚Äôt covered any of these, they were talking only about the price 
What do you think was the reason the price went up to 10k a month ago? The fundamentals only got better. This is an honest question, no illwill intended. Do you think it went up on speculation only?
The only one that has really mattered for the past 9 years: digital gold.
Software should do one thing, and do it well.

What is that one thing for Bitcoin? store of value
>Which use cases are you thinking of?

How much time do you have? 

In all seriousness, I'm wondering if you honestly think that BTC as a currency is the only use case, or if you could see it being used in other applications.

>only when transactions are fast, cheap and when there's substantial adoption by retailers 
No. Obviously Ethereum needs to implement scaling solutions before that happens, but luckily it seems they are coming soon. (TM) But at least it seems they've made great progress on sharding and will be implemented alongside Casper. 
Thanks for the warning but I don't short and certainly wouldn't start at this stage of the downtrend.  I usually play oversold bounces.  I have a long from 7K still open.
He didn't say he was "sure". He's seeking advice.
>Someone piss on your parade today?  At what point does "looks just like business as usual to me" get interpreted as me saying I am sure?  A question was asked "does anyone feel this will be any different........" and I answered with my feeling.  Literally no reason for your salty interjection. 
Yeah.. of course they do you're adding to your short position that's how every market ever works. If you long .5btc then tomorrow long another .5btc your position is now 1 bitcoin. 
Quite obviously - any significant sell order (compared to the order book) will move the price.

This pressure will then go on to other exchange. See it like a web. You move one point, the connections put presure on the other points.

That said, obviously a 1 million BTC order would be - quite brutal. We talk of 1/18th or so of all existing coins.
Well what he said wasn‚Äôt wrong. A fractal is a smaller version of a pattern that happens inside itself. Like the Sierpinski Triangle. If it‚Äôs just a thing that happens again, it‚Äôs simply a repeating pattern or occurance. 
My gut was telling me the same.

But it would be too easy if it happened again like this, wouldn't it?


>  I expect the pink uptrend line that it bounced off at $6000 in February and $6400 in April to be re-tested at some point before we continue further down. 

Genuinely interested: why do you expect that? What selling pressure do you see? I see no reason for anyone to sell. Weak hands were shaken out by March. New money knows it can dump. Seems like most coins are held by longer term investors now who don't have a lot of pressure to sell. Everybody knows the deal: buy the dip and hodl, never investing more than you'll miss. 

Good news from the SEC, positive remarks from CFTC chairman, the Square thing... I just don't see a compelling reason to sell, and, to put it quite bluntly, the coins that were recklessly dumped over the past weeks and months are now largely tucked away off market. Those guys ( the reckless dumpers) are gonna feel hella dumb by the end of the summer, end of year at latest.
Stupid reasons it seems 
[removed]
[removed]
it went up 5% in about 10 minutes 
I strongly feel the same way, but it doesn't mean enough people do to turn the trend.
Why you gotta hurt feelings man? :/
Right. For most on this sub that means no more than six months.
He isn't live on YouTube at the moment 
but why? 
> If we priced based on 21m coins then we move 100 years forward in time

20.99M coins is kinda close enough and we'll be there in 30 years. Take it down to 20.9M and we'll get there in about 15 years.
Why is it insane to short here? What changed? Did breaking up change that much? Would you long here?
Ok.
It‚Äôs what op said... and manipulation ala barts.  

Some big dick is swinging a couple hundred mil with bots across all the exchanges and just cleaning house on the margin longs/shorts is my guess.  Just raking money and moving the whole market at will.  The normies are like the aftershock and they‚Äôre just hordes like sheep.  Is my guess anyway 
You totally miss the economic reality.

The amount of bitcoin released is nearly constant.

Miners all the time bring new equipment online, to increase of defend their share of the pile.

Better, more efficient miners would only be an advantage until they start being common, then suddently the hashrate is significantly higher. And the amount of bitcoin is the same.

> But the halving is about the difficulty / time to mine? 

No. Halving is about the bitcoin PER BLOCK - that is unelated to he difficulty. THe difficulty goes up because minsers plug in more hashrate.
You start of making sense, but you lose me when you say this:

"If bitmain release a miner 3-4 times as efficient the coins will be mined equal to or faster than, today."

This is not true except in a very marginal sense, at least for the overall number of coins mined. The rate at which coins are mined stays roughly the same, except for halvings, so having more efficient mining equipment doesn't make a difference, all that matters is share of total hash rate.

Unless you're talking about power efficiency. That matters. But doesn;t affect the rate at which coins are mined.
I don't know if I'm in the minority here, but I feel like it's a bit of a waste of time trying to trade this market.  We seemingly wait 24-48+ hours for a 3-4% moves.  The problem is that these moves are most of the time caused by a single actor within minutes.  You are basically trying to do a coin flip on your position, might as well go to a real casino for that.  
Oh I know, I still expect this to be short lived, but the very least I could of gotten a much better entry for a short with this past BGD.

Edit: also why I have no one else to blame but myself
Hey sloppy, considering the current sentiment of the sub right now (6/27/2018), do you think they same thing is going on presently like when you posted this comment?

For me it feels like the same song and dance
Not the same thing at all, really. Someone could have been waiting for their short close order to get filled for days and got impatient so they decide to market close.

The other situation would be they had no intentions of closing yet unless the price shot up.
Kinda read his comment wrong, I saw $3k which I think is more than possible. If $2k happens I wouldn't expect it for 6-12months

my targets right now are $4.5-5.5k. Have been for months now :P Might change depending on what happens but I will *actually* close at 3 places, probably in $500 increments 
I'm just explaining what author had in mind. Don't believe it.

But... We'll probably never know.
Yeah, total bullshit
I actually believe some whales do this. There are some people playing with a large amount of capital that lurk on those 3 sites. 
Let's talk in a few days
It's been 3-4 hours, [look at the RSI and Macd](https://image.ibb.co/dgiSjd/rsi1hr.png), is it normal that it stays that way or goes up?
https://cryptowat.ch/markets/bitfinex/btc/usd

Increase the grouping just above the order book. 
I don't, but hard to miss that one ;-)

Don't believe it'll play out.
> For they to rise if we break down it would have to be a massive dump plunging through 6K.

You just answered your own question. 
Exactly below 4K is where panic really starts to kick in 5K, didn't hold everyones looking at 3K. People will double down to make up for losses. Thats when you get a real short squeeze like when people expected 5K and not 6K.
Close, but not entirely. It wasn't so much chop at the end as a bleeding upwards, giving people "better and better" short entries. There was a $200 fakeout down which spiked it, *then* boom. We could see the same thing here if we bled up to 6700 again, broke down to 6450. 
I'm thinking a low of people throwing in the towel beyond 5K. In the same move a move down to just touching below 4K(remember the 3K bottom after 5K) you can bet your ass shorts will fly up looking for 3K at least and will probably try and make up the gains so will leverage. This could happen real quickly once 6K is broken and if 5 doesn't hold any weight.
Since it's decentralized, it's kind of unique.  

Miners have invested thousands of dollars specific equipment and electricity costs to mine bitcoin. These equipment have no value outside of scrapping their metal.  The only other avenue is for them to short futures to hedge their risk. 


It's also a mostly unregulated market which gives traders and free investors to do what they want. That's valuable in itself. FOREX trading with the wheels off.  


I would assume big players do not want to totally remove hope from the asset as the variability is what makes them money.  


That's just my observations with no real evidence backing it. There's easy ways to profit on both side if you have the money and I can't see people wanting to completely destroy it. 

Plus there just hasn't been much progress technology wise this year. Last year had Segwit which was a multi year battle and glimpse of hope. 

Then when Lightning Network was released, it was kind of underwhelming. It still needs a lot of bootstrapping and it's almost like starting adoption over from 0. 

IMO crypto is a short on collective nationstate fiscal policies & a long on black market activity.
That is true
That usually means that scalpers run out of range and we need a new one.
I mean, if I was short right now and the price went to 5.8k, I wouldn't close it there because I don't think that level will hold. That's why I think it's not a good target.
Yeah, thank you for you response though.
They don't even need to cash out. I was surprised how many people don't realize how to hedge their position. For example if you have one Bitcoin. You can send half of that to bitmex and short it. Now you have a delta neutral position and you don't have to worry about the tax implications of selling. 

You could also do a 60/40 split or any percentage in between if you had a slight bias
This is so good I saved it. Thank you sloppy.

Aha, thx
That is what I'm leaning towards but I have a feeling BTC will possibly have another leg up. I honestly don't see any reason for serious price action to the upside unless some news comes out in regards to regulation (positive news of course), China unbanning or an ETF announcement.  
You aren't wrong. But no one's wrong. Everyone's guess is as good as mine. I know that governments will try and suppress this idea, but let's see how successful they are. As for the efficiency problem, as long as the development process is going on and even a bit of progress there is a decent chance that we can solve the efficiency problem. Again think internet during 1990's.
Governments are lazy pieces of shit who want to appear innovation friendly. Maybe the smart governments like Russia and China ban it but Western countries can't even stop people from just walking right in to live there. That's where the growth will come from, along with countries whose own currencies suck.
The burden of proof is on you, the claimant. Coming up with models is not the hard part. Finding one worth taking note of is the hard part. The tx model looks like it does worse than short-term-same-long-term-up and definitely worse than PnL charting.
Good points, /u/Keats_in_rome

I can only follow with: I think there should be a clearer division in talking about re-visiting ATH and looking for reasonably high/stable priced Bitcoin in general. I don't see much talk of this sort these days. It's always either "moon" or "Goblin Town". Rarely anybody think of the ground in between.

What /u/SloppySynapses suggests that we won't hit ATH without solid fundamentals is reasonably right. People got their fingers burnt, and now they know the pan is hot. We will indeed need an actual reason to price Bitcoin this high, i.e. actual evolution of the fundamentals or some other similar very positive developments for Bitcoin. That's only common sense.

But at the same time I think there are good chances we can go to 10-12k on greed/speculation alone, i.e. yet again go there. People dream of ATH, but I think it would be more important for us (us = traders/Bitcoin users) to actually establish a higher low vs. where we are now, i.e. keep the price oscillating on speculation within a more narrow "channel", say, 8-10k (or 8-12k or so, etc). Or to put this differently, to reach a "plateau" where Bitcoin doesn't induce FUD and panic every 4 weeks, and remains in overall "reasonably well priced". Kinda, "for the time being", with the road to the ATH and above still in the further than closer distance.

I'd say that the most disruptive thing about Bitcoin and its ecosystem is the violence of speculation, 12 to 6, 6 to 10, 10 to 7, and so on. Fundamentals only ever grow stronger. 
> Do you think it went up on speculation only?

Absolutely. That's all it really can be at this stage. There is not yet widespread adoption, practical use case, or tax environment to support $10K BTC for *any* reason beyond speculation.

And I am bullish long term. 
Yes. Short squeeze + disbelief rally basically. Mainly traders and weak handed speculators 
I have all the time in the world. Which use cases are you thinking of?
Yeah... but it won't be implemented this year. Have you listened at all to the dev meetings? It's going to be easily in 2019 before we see any of this stuff. Meanwhile BTC already has lightning live on beta and lot of people are working to get the kinks sorted out... people are betting on the wrong horse here... ETH has way more competition from things like EOS which will eat at its user base and market cap and development.
You can split them on some exchanges - whaleclub for e.g but the financing there is ridiculous 
And its dumb because i might wAnt to keep one open for whatever reason whilst doing a quick scalp on another. Suppose there is a way to take partial profits? 
That‚Äôs what they want you to think. 
I feel like the same tricks keep working until people start expecting them, then the opposite happens. I guess it just depends how many people are expecting it this time, haha.
I'm still bullish long-term, but we had a stupidly crazy bull run last year. I still think Bitcoin is way overpriced at the moment for the rate of adoption, and we are likely bound to experience some further price discovery (downward) before we can settle out and move sideways before continuing back up. If you're buying to hold for a few years, I can't blame you for buying here. But I'm a trader, so I'm gonna continue trying to playing these swings to increase my BTC stack.
I told you to go long last night.  You should have listened ;)
It didn't even go down that much during the Sunday sucker punch dump. Think about it.
let me rephrase

go to his last video, today on his Youtube channel, go to mark 1:11 in the video where he talks about the Bitcoin price spike
Lol fuck off. 
Definitely not long. I would short here but that's over my limit to double down.

If it breaks up I'll wipe out my gains from last couple of days but I trade BTC so I'm up when it goes up. So basically I lost a week and back when I was.

But this here. Come on, huge buy walls, now huge sell walls. This is just taking money from weak hands. My biggest concern here is that we're painting a text book bull flag now.
Yup, I agree and have been considering quitting for a week or two now. as in selling my coins and leaving. I assume lots of this market will start quitting here soon as well. Which is why I want to be patient. I just have to be more patient than the rest of the retail traders 
yea, oh well, opportunity missed. now we get to see if this is really going to go higher or not. At least this is happening sooner rather than later, this was getting kind of boring again
The effect is still the same... and it is unlikely multiple someones closed their short at the same time because they are impatience. Realistically this is 80&#37; closing shorts because of stop-loss orders executing.
Haha I was this close to PMing you around $6,200 saying, hey old sloppy old pal, just a friendly reminder we're at $6,200 lol but I know targets are targets and it's seriously impressive that you're sticking to the plan. 
They do way more than just lurk my dude
It's an unregulated market. I think it would be foolish to think they wouldn't; especially during low volume times. There's people on here with alts that push their agenda. There's tons of people that blindly follow YouTubers. 

I'm sure it was hard to do during FOMO time like in Dec, but it's still unknown if there was a group that caused that as well.
Lmao cool. In a few days we will be going sideways 6700-6900. Let's talk in 2-3 weeks.
Looks like bart down may be incoming..
Looks pretty normal to me. When in doubt, zoom out. Also, look at historical data for some clues. Good luck!
thanks!
I'd suggest using finex instead of cryptowatch for the sole purpose of checking the active buy / sell walls. Cryptowatch does not provide accurate data when it comes to grouping the order books. :)
I just think it's a harder thing to achieve versus a temporary pump. That would require a higher amount of funds no?
Ah yep that was it
Missing out on another drop but still taking 15% is not bad imo. But lets just agree to disagree.
This is the kind of thing I wish were more discussed on big pages like r/bitcoin or r/CryptoCurrency instead of brainless memes, and ramblings the FUDsters/hypesters. Have an upvote.
Hey thanks! Glad you appreciated it :) 
I spite sold my .4 mined Eth after the pump.  That's like 8-10 bux more profit.  Whale bro will surely pump it due to our sins committed now.
That's the symmetrical triangle everyone's watching ;)

That's also why I said it doesn't matter, cause it point towards continuation of a trend.
Just think how a small fud about some mt gox bitcoin being moved cause so much panic and cost so much value in a day from bitcoin. The government can destroy this in a few days if they wanted and offer a crypto product of their own. Just a guess.    
    
I agree that the technology will continue improving and when it does this will be much more valuable, and it will begin to reflect a more true value for its use case, that's why we invest. Think of google or microsoft price in their early years and think of them now.    
    
I'm an investor in blockchain (a small investor). I just think what I'm investing in is manipulated into a bubble by some people..    
    
Example: It was 6430 earlier today, I went to the store and came back in 5 minutes, it was suddenly 6730 with a big pump and some people here are like "when lambo". These aren't natural value gains and losses.. I think the whole run up to 20k from 1k in a matter of weeks was a manipulation like that. 
The US government won't allow it either. Sorry to burst your bubble but bitcoin or some other crypto won't become some world currency independent from governments. Governments (including the US gov't) will arrest citizens, kill, bomb countries, but won't relinquish those powers.
> The burden of proof is on you, the claimant

I've evidenced all the claims I've made. To wit: here is the correlation and lsq power law fit between tx rate and price, and this is what it looks like over a long period of time.

Comparison to exp(nt) is not appropriate because the model above specifically excludes time as a variable. Now, I like exponential fit (I use trendlines on a log plot quite happily) but I don't see them as comparable.

> Coming up with models is not the hard part. Finding one worth taking note of is the hard part.

I agree. But tx rate^2 is a commonly discussed and regularly rediscovered metric. I (still) think there is some value in documenting its behaviour over time.

Incidentally, the comments / votes on these posts have proved to be an excellent sentiment indicator.
I agree. I didn't mean this wasn't my thinking. But, /u/SloppySynapses, why do you think the chances for a drive on speculation recurring yet again this time are low(er)? It happened already twice.

Edit: Better grammar
Before I answer your question, would you answer mine?

>So you think the only way BTC can be successful is if it's adopted as a currency? No other use case is realistic or matters?
Trust me I like EOS too, but Bitcoins lightning network is a joke. Its too hard to use for mainstream adoption, and will likely go nowhere. Its so overhyped and underdeveloped. 

As for EOS overtaking Ethereum - its certainly possible, but its going to take way longer than a year to take away Ethereums user base and strong network effect. A year from now I'm pretty confident sharding and POS will be done, not to mention other sidechain solutions, as well as Plasma which  has developed faster than expected and will be finished by EOY 2018.

Holy shit please tell me you're using the test net(yes, obviously the answer is yes you can buy or sell as many contracts as your account allows anytime you want)
but what if people start expecting the opposite?  Then you have to use double reverse psychology and do what they expect you to, I think.
The problem is that you posted your original comment as if Tone was reacting the price spike we had a few hours ago. That's all 
I'm being genuine. I didn't downvote you either. 

I personally agree that thinking alts don't move the market is silly, too. EOS and ETH clearly propped this up for a while in $7ks.  and ETH and BCH at several other points 

But why oil? Genuinely curious
You can quit the market, but don't quit the sub!
I mean even looking at the day chart and where we are in the downward channel I should of known we weren't going to drop right through and the very least test upper resistance first. 

But hey that's why they say hindsight is 20/20
there is a difference between 1000 shorts getting caught with their pants down vs 1000 shorts intentionally manually closing.

the effect is the same on the books for the first 15 minutes but the intentions of these traders will not be the same depending on which one it was.

Realistically we have no idea if the shorts came first or the market buy came first. If you can show me which came first I'd actually be extremely interested in seeing, but you're assuming. 
Would've been a great close :) I should've taken some profits. Terrible about taking profits üíÄ

And yea thanks I guess I'm just really stubborn lol. 

It'll either be really impressive or really stupid in the end. üòÇ
Glad you are 100% sure of everything you say, always a good outlook
you two are like a couple of toddlers arguing, "nah uh, I'm right" "nah uh, *I'm* right"
Depends how it happens. Another breakdown of 6200 would likely lead to cascading market sells and long stops/liquidations. It's not market manipulation at that stage, it's just people selling into the liquidity on the books. Market makers pull their limit orders and people still hit market sell. Folks trying to benefit from the dump leverage short. Eventually it would bottom. Could be quickly. Knife catchers are tenacious in this range.
I was going to comment too, extremely well said. 
Very good. You need to be diefied here. 
Fair point. Throw the flag pole on it and it gives you context :P
No, I never said that. If there's a convincing use case for BTC other than being used as a currency or "digital gold", I'm all ears.
Brilliant thanks for the detailed response. Appreciate the time. That all makes perfect sense. I have effectively been keeping track of the 'gross' / split position on a spreadsheet which, as you say, equates the net position on bmex. Downside is your leverage will always be the same across your position so liq point narrows as you DCA over time (in one direction).. .

Ps. Whaleclub a joke!!! is great for fx trading but the overnight fee on BTC was like 10%  per 12 hours of your total position. And they are clever to hide the rates so if you assume same as all reasonable exchanges - which i did - you get screwed. Day light robbery. So we learn. 

Cheers mate
Nope live. Sitting on a 290% profit on my May short - want to keep that open. Back to my original question then - how do i open a seperate contract!! The 1st answer has confused the point no? 
I feel like Vizzini in this market. Just waiting til I accidentally drink the wrong cup.
I don't know but as diydude said oil spikes show weakness in the dollar and that could very well be why.

I used to trade oil well before I started trading BTC so I've always kept an eye on them charts too and I was only stating what I could see on both.

The dips and spikes line up more on these 2 "unrelated" markets more than anything else I have seen in the past.

Put the 2 charts side by side and just have a look, it doesn't take too much effort and if helps with your trading then that's a good thing.

A lot of so called traders don't understand that there are always other indicators that can be taken advantage of, it may seem unfathomable at first but why dismiss it until it has been checked. 
:D I'll probably never fully leave but I just am overdue for a break 
Aha, I get you... so you think closing the first batch shorts on purpose could have been the trigger for other shorts to close.. Yes, very plausible
The 1000 shorts were talking about, that's 1000 BTC short as in 1000 BTC collateral right? Not the notional value
I've been right so far: [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/tlo0V1AE-BTC-Capitulation-still-ahead-potential-reversal-soon/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/tlo0V1AE-BTC-Capitulation-still-ahead-potential-reversal-soon/)

If your're not 110% sure don't trade
At least I provided some charts. Where are ur charts?
Lol I don't know about that...
I don't like symmetrical, they often play out as a reversal pattern :/
You said:

>only when transactions are fast, cheap and when there's substantial adoption by retailers

This leads me to believe the only use case you believe in is as a currency, does that make sense?


Nevermind - Ill figure it out. Cheers anyways
Make a new account, I don't think what you want to do is a real thing..are you trading literally $1 contract? 
Yea basically that's all I'm saying, I get what you're saying though 
1000 btc worth of short positions on finex. could be 3 positions, could be 1000.
also it's up to like 2000 shorts closing now 
I don't trade
I haven't backtested, but that's my inclination as well. Also still not a fan of the short:long ratio currently for continuation. 
Man, this is becoming a rather tiresome conversation. I shared my vision, why do you refuse to share yours? Isn't that the whole purpose of this sub?
Thanks, Cheers
Ok, that's collateral, not trade able value post leverage right?
It's 1:1, still far from squezze, but not feeling too comfortable until it breaks 6k.

This is really hard to trade now. It can reverse literally anywhere.
Sorry you feel that way, man. I'm just trying to understand where you're coming from, but we can end it here. Good luck to you.
Yes, as in 1000 btc *including* leverage. Could be as small as 333 btc since lvg is 3.3x on finex 

well 2000/666 now
This is getting rather silly... Do you think I'm trying to trap you or something? I said where I was coming from in my first post. Now I'm trying to understand where you're coming from. You said there are other use cases. I'm eager to know them, so please share them with us.
Got it, thanks man. I'm actually surprised then there's not that much BTC on bfx being levered. 
it's all good man, you've called this dialogue tiresome and now silly and I'm over it. good luck going forward
Oh, did I hurt your feelings?

Next time you want to make a statement, try backing it up instead of making a fool of yourself.
I'm not interested in having a dialoque with someone who thinks the conversation we're having is tiresome and silly. If you can't appreciate that, then I'm not sure what else to say. I truly mean no offense, and actually do hope we speak again at some point.
You were refusing to elaborate long before I called the conversation tiresome, even though I was just asking a perfectly reasonable question. You were the one making this tiresome, I just called you out on it.
Fair enough, man - be well.
Yeah, you too. Let's try again some other time.
