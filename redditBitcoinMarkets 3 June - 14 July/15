Do we need a rule #2?  

When the market moves against you, don't come here to spread your salt?
Coinbase Pro is so wack. Cant even read these charts. And it doesnt even show the 1day chart for me. Anyone else agree? 
[While everyone keeps comparing to 2014...](https://i.imgur.com/ZFmZbwr.png)

I still think 2014 was a odd and exceptional bear market with exceptional FUD and it had a 12x run up in a single month with no chance of establishing support levels unlike 2013 and 2017 which had a more gradual run up with corrections along the way. The only resistance 2014's run up had...was at 160 dollars and that ended up being the support on the way down.
Bullish:

- June future was expired at 6k level so no more worry about it. Next future settle date is 27 July. on 29 March it expired at 7k lvl, and 1 month later we see the high of $9990
- BTC broke the RSI downtrend on 1D chart
- We got double Bullish Div on both 1D and 12H chart
- We got double bottom on 4H chart, confirmed with the breakout of $6300. As theory it can go to $6800 with this pattern.

- Not really bullish: I actually lost some faith in BTC after some fail break out, push up push down pattern, Bart pattern. Hope this time it will not do that again :(
Yesterday I shared [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8uq6eg/daily_discussion_friday_june_29_2018/e1hubb0).  

I moved into a long @$5880 after posting... sadly not at my typical nominal value position as I was expecting to scale in.  FWIW, I've moved my stops to break even and am going to let this one ride.  The divs on the 12h/1d will take some time to play out.  This was one the biggest moves up in the 8 week downtrend, and I think $5800 will be the local bottom until some point in mid July.  If we make it above $7k, I'll begin scaling into a short. 

We're really not out of the woods yet in my opinion... but this relief rally was being telegraphed in charts, and I'm of the opinion that this won't fold over into the kind of relentless bear flags we've seen since May.  Obvious sell point would be resistance off the bottom of the giant pennant @$7500 but I have doubts about price finding its way up that high.

Safe trades.



 
Looks like the BTC 2 part RSI bullish divergence I posted 24 hours ago played out some upward.  (this: tradingview.com/x/zQZp7POi/)  I believe it has more room for up.  I went through years of bitcoin's daily chart and the last time we had a 2 part RSI bull div was in 2014 near the end of the bear run.
Is there a tradingview indicator that breaks down volume into market buy and market sell?
Trend changes are identified in retrospect. A lot of people tied to their bearish positions need to be margin called first. Careful with leverage chaps. 
So... is being unable to push over 6400 bearish, or is resisting a drop below 6330 bullish?!

14D EMA and its role in the bear market:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/OLZ1XFde/

This could mean we will retest the main resistance (blue line) in the following weeks. A 8350$ target would fit with the 0.618 retracement level from the last bearish wave. 
Cracks me up comparing the sentiment on /r/CryptoCurrency and right here when the price goes up a bit:

CC: "WE R MOONING BOIS TYME 4 LAMBO HEHUEHUEHUE"

Really makes me realize what a cancerous stain /r/CryptoCurrency is.

I don't know if the "sub calendar" is still a thing, but some dates. I expect ETFs do be denied, but August 23 still seems somewhat relevant date as it will be the first real/final decision about the "bitcoin futures" ETFs.

The weekly stochastic RSI bullish cross in the 2018 bear market.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/TWiO6AJc/

We are about to do that cross.
This is likely more of a quick scalp than anything else, as I doubt we form a lower low from $5800 without a nice rally. However, it seems that the current push is losing a little steam, alts are dropping a bit here, the long/short ratio still scares me this low, and September futures are fortunately still trading at a premium. I'd likely expect a small retrace, even if it does pick back up over the next few days. I'm just hedging my balance essentially.

Well there goes my short from 6348, wanted to closed with a limit order but did move against me the same minute. Well well

Here is my long term chart that I watch. If 6500 holds for a good while(1-2 weeks?) The X(5700 range) is a perfect double bottom level for me, with the downtrendline acting as support and horizontal line too. When the 1D ma will cross, I will start buying a lot again https://www.tradingview.com/x/1GSRZcBU

This is my 3rd long in nearly 2 months out of my 20+ shorts and I’m in profit. I defiantly feel more comfortable shorting in this market, but not sure what’s going to happen in the future so happy with locking in profits.

While I'm not yet convinced that this is "the turnaround", I'm starting to keep an eye on bullish cloud signals again. The checklist looks something like this on the 4H chart:

* Price above cloud (not yet)
* Lagging price above cloud (not yet)
* Tenkan/Kijun cross (close)
* Bullish cloud twist (close)

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/Guigts5U/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Guigts5U/)

Previously I planned to close my hedge at a small loss if we broke 6900. But I decided to close/take profit at 5900. This recent advance was certainly impressive (pushing through decent resistance around 6300). But it doesn't look like a true reversal, which makes me change my strategy a bit.

I'm planning to enter a new hedge at \~6900, should we make it there. Otherwise I will likely hold until break even (5900) and hedge a bounce.
Another faileded pump immediately rejected. Same price action we saw before dumps at 7500, 6700, and recently 6200 before the second bottom. 

Gonna be scaling back into my short above 6400
ITT: Salty bears who do pathetic comparisons to 2014




I swear, the volume here is shot. Bitmex has been eating at a visible sell wall at $6356 for a few minutes now, no changes...
Warning: crazy talk:

Assuming we are following a fractal of the 2013 crash:

On 2013-12-18 we reached a new low, down 68% from all time high.

A couple days ago we reached a new low, down 70% from all time high.

Following that low in 2013, we moved up 159%.

If we moved up 159% here, it would bring us to $15,000.  $15,000 is the 62% fib from all time high to recent low.  A psychological number that provides a place for the bulls to fail.

BTC would then crash hard down to $1,300-$4,000 range and stay there for >2 years, probably 6-8 years.

Of course I do not advocate trading this prediction, but I need to be aware that it is a very real possibility when finding my entry and exit for trades.
Showerthought: I'm pretty sure the next halvening is not priced in anymore.
The GDAX tip off before the run. 

I noticed yesterday a 170BTC bid wall and 1400 ETH bid wall @ 410 was stood up roughly 30min before the pump (no LTC walls). There were some sells into then and they didn't move.  I didn't have time to check the other exchanges (was working).

I knew something was about to happen, because it's been a long time since I've seen a wall that big on GDAX that wasnt there for defence of something like 6K. This was there for offence. 

Did anyone else see this on the other exchanges? Was there some market signal I missed? 

EDIT: So the common theme here was price action (or lack of, with sells coming into large walls). What about futures? Or other indicator?

Update on my posts form yesterday: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8uq6eg/daily_discussion_friday_june_29_2018/e1hwr7y/?context=0

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8uq6eg/daily_discussion_friday_june_29_2018/e1iwbnc/?context=0

Sticking to my belief that we'll see a brief, relief rally for a little bit. Sticking to my original plan and expanding it a little bit. Not making any moves until Monday as  I want to see how the monthly and weekly close. Also, want to see how (if at all) this pump consolidates. 

Bear case: Remember, we're still not out of the woods and the woods are very much bear territory. We haven’t broken out of the downtrend that started at the beginning of May, we actually got rejected there but we did jump like 12% in a few hours so im not too worried about that. https://www.tradingview.com/x/DNiYJSPQ/

Bull case:  Bullish engulfing on daily yesterday, pump candles had SOME volume behind them and consolidations are low volume. That being said, the volume compared on higher time frames is still relatively shite.

Remember, just as quickly as it came up, it can go back down.

As for my plan, ive decided that when I do make a move to go long on alts, im gonna avg down on some small bags ive picked up before I knew what stop losses were…. Yeah, I was one of them but hopefully I can avg down, dump them and clean up my portfolio. Theyre all small bags but there is a few of them so ive prioritised which ones need more attention than others. If I do enter new positions to avg down, will have stops on them. What was that saying in Tennessee - I know it's in Texas - probably in Tennessee…

Looking forward to seeing what treats we have in store for July. Good luck guys
Altought this move was very agressive, it could also mean that we just check if support turned resistance. In the past 6.5k was a very strong support mark when we declined the 2nd time below 7k. We just broke this line and went 700 Points under it, so it could mean we retest this mark with this move. I am sure it will be heavy resistance and a hard fight for bulls to get sustainable above it.  With every 100 USD we climbed from here, a lot of underwater people consider to get out of there position and thank god that they could without a loss. From my perspektive it takes a bit more to turn this trend then another BGD a bit below our old low.

If it happens that we go above it I will open a loarger short at around 6.8k, because a retest of this old support at 6.5k is then very likly imoho.
Stuff looks weak, shorting swaps from 6350 with stops above 6380. Ready for the downbart

Interesting that futures is above swaps again
I've just been lurking this subreddit lately and have to ask, 

when people type

>(!)short xbtu18 $XXXX 10x X%

etc, are they sending a command to a bot to do some action, or is that just the tl;dr of their position after they explain their view? I've seen a bot respond once or twice with a spreadsheet that made no sense to me.

e:thanks
https://www.tradingview.com/x/Aq8tR6mX/  
Going with this pattern again unless we get above 6750 since that's where we landed after the drop from the 7k range and we got stuck trying to break above that price from the 18th to the 20th.
Will hedge a retest of the high and add in short up to 6900. Retest of 6k sets up potential bearish continuation
I used to think 3k has a very good chance of being the bottom but seeing dead-cat bounces like this just makes me wonder just how long it would take to get to 3k (if we really get there). Look at the endless number of potential bounce areas.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/PpzNwRiz/

(Ignore the numbering. those are not EW's)

Having said that, I hope this rally turns out to be a sizable one. We haven't had a decent rally since April for God's fuking sake. 
Needs to get above 6.5 and stay there today or we will probably die again. Not sure to make of this because of all the bottom shorters that keep getting squeezed(seriously, third time now? Dont you learn?) They are making it difficult to see what the current direction really is, but if we manage 6.8 im turning bull for july.
Look at the up wicks on the 1m candles and the decreasing Accumulation/Distribution Line:

Starting to see some selling pressure since 9 hours ago.. Don't know what to make of it after such a strong bounce we had. Seeing these up wicks is very concerning to me :(

So if I interpret this screencap which somebody trading CBOE futures posted on twitter correctly: 53 people are only trading CBOE futures (bitmex trollbox is even more busy...) and no institutional money ('commercial activity') is even involved: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dg5lzQjX4AAZ04D.jpg  This is pretty much a joke.

This line might has some relevance [https://imgur.com/a/reqFTBW](https://imgur.com/a/reqFTBW)
So what's the lowdown guys? We are expecting this to go a bit higher then drop further than 5K, right?

Please don't downvote as I am asking a serious question. Would appreciate some feedback.

Also, if this is the little bounce before the bigger drop, when is the expected final drop before an imminent reversal? Or is that too hard to see on the trend?
Sure it's a nice bit of relief but at the moment it's nothing more. We haven't broken any key resistances yet, we are still buggered in terms of Ichimoku resistance and we are no where near the ATH trend line break.

I can see this going to the 7k region and then reversing again, prolonging the bear market some more.

But for now it's a case of be very careful. We've been here before, and then ultimately gone back down after masses of people professed the bears were finished.

Far from it as it stands. Zoom out, look at the weekly and the downtrend picture is still crystal clear... For now at least. 
As usual, the true organic volume is moving the price sideways for several hours...99% of this market has absolutely negligible effect on the price, in between manipulated pumps and dumps.


https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/bitcoin-latest-price-concurrency-money-exchange-rate-analysis-a8424651.html?amp

Bitcoin dead again apparently. Permission to short :/

Edit: clearly the sarcasm in my :/ was lost.
I was thinking (hoping anyway) this would push up to at least $6800 or so before going back down, but we seem to have lost steam and are now slowly grinding back down. I'm long with average entry of $6266, so I'll keep it open with stops just above break even and reassess if/when they hit.
we arent actually trusting this are we?
I really dislike the fact that I can't find anywhere that states exactly when the December Futures open on Bitmex... I swear, I've looked everywhere in their page! Oh, well. 
12 hours ago I was hoping for a little rise on the 4hr RSI, now when at 64 it's almost like I don't want to short it ?!?
[removed]
Another futile pump up to prolong the inevitable crash. This is really not good guys, like I mentioned a few days ago the longer we go sideways before breaking down the more pressure builds and the bigger the capitulation will be. Once again, this pump was nothing other than a large short closing who opened at 5900 this morning. 

I think this BGD can instill some confidence, enough for us to test 6900-7000 again at most, but my targets for the capitulation are now minimum 4k and probably 3500.
Bitfinex, last 12h or so (UTC+2). Note the buy wall at 6350.

As someone who often trades counter-sentiment, yesterday when I saw the dominant bearish mood I really wanted to go long but the high long:short ratio scared me. Hindsight is 20/20 of course but I regret not listening my gut feeling.

Anyway, to simplify things there are only two questions that matter now:

1) Will we retest the meme triangle? I'd say 50/50. Only thing I'm sure is that if we do, at that level (around 7200-7300) I'll open the biggest short position I've ever opened.

2) Will 5800 hold the next time we visit it? Probably not. At this point retail traders should be permanently scared to go short at 5800, so no liquidity there.

This kind of sell walls always make me interested in

Will we soon see a large market buy order to clear the wall and create FOMO effect?
anyone else having trouble logging in to kraken?
My long from 5880 was stopped out at 6300 overnight, but promising to see a recovery back up to 6350. The longer we stay above 6300, the better this looks for another push upwards. Will remain out of position for now, but checking that weekly stochastic cross posted earlier.

Edit: That being said, a 6400 short looks like a decent play right now.
I think we’re seeing warning signs of a breakdown right now.  Would be a major fake out if we get a pump right now.  We hit 6700 next few days I’m calling 7700.  From there anyone’s guess,  but my money is breaking down here and touching 56xx or going to 77 and then breaking back down slowly.  I think the soonest we see 10k is November barring any major news (amazon accepts bitcoin or major financial institutions announce they’re in type of announcement).

No triangles or TA.  Just my final destination premonition.  Let’s see how it plays out
[removed]
I'm sticking to my short. Little support for a move past 6500 right now. Its gonna be under 6k by tomorrow though I‘m not sure how much lower than that it will go in the short term.

I see some people draw the line of the Huge Triangle which we broke down very easy on 10 June. Personally I do not think it will turn to the resistance at all, just zoom in and look at the way it react to sell pressure. It seems we only assume it should be the support, turn out it is just a simple line.

Right? Too many cry babies here mad they sold when they thought price was going down.
Well, I would say it’s a good thing to be able to vent here to blow off some steam. There is fine line between complaining and venting though and part of it has to do with assigning blame vs taking responsibility. 
Haha, yeah and don't jerk off in front of us when making high gains long/short, do it respectful 😊
It sucks.  Gdax was fine.
I haven’t really seen anyone that liked it.
Hey heyyy heyyyyyyy
To be honest, I've always thought that the November 2013 parabolic bull run was a little too... unnatural looking. It just randomly shoots straight up, nearly vertical. I just cannot fathom how in the world something like that can happen or why. In my opinion, it never should have happened. The bull run in 2016-2017 looked a lot more natural in comparison. 
2014 was odd and exceptional and 2018 is just as odd and exceptional, but in different ways.
Bitcoin always does everything again, sorry to disappoint.
Good call! We were definitely due for a rally, even a temporary small one. 
Any guess of how high it’ll go?
VPVR
Nope. You have to track that directly from the API 
Not here.  They are identified 30 seconds after a 5% pump.
Both would be correct, but it's way too early to make any of those calls yet. It could drop back to 6100 and then break 6400.

I saw a Tradingview-er using 13D EMA. I guess it's not much of a difference?

It looks as though bitcoin has successfully settled above it and maybe it will act as support
retest of the blue line is likely to result in breaking upwards, just because there must be enough buying pressure and excitement left at 8350 to do so if this is the case

but i wouldn't expect btc to go up anywhere above 10 or 11k just yet, stick to the theory that it will form a double top

Good for miners if this ever happened.

If a bitcoin is worth 6 million dollars, then each 2027 block is worth 3.125 * 6 million dollars or over 18 million dollars.  Each week  $18,900,000,000 ($18,900 million) worth of bitcoin would be mined.

Most of the world's electricity would be dedicated to mining.

Didn't see that coming, but it looks real good! 
What I’m asking is... are you just saying it’s going to continue the pattern: go up then down? 
So then what 
with the breached EMA I think you are playing with fire, especially after a bullish divergence, but then again I suck at trading.
Can you explain why September futures matter here?
I got my DCA under 9000 range thanks to these sweet numbers
Short term there is more than in previous years, but still the same. Just called them whipsaws instead.

Now Bitcoin looks like any other forex chart when chopping. 
Very very similar.  And of course 2014 didn't reach it's true bottom until January ~13-15th 2015.
Can barely read it, is it 2014 overlayed? What's the next move? 😂
for some reason, profits from longs feel better.
Well done, making money on a long in this market is quite an accomplishment. Can't really make myself to FOMO in here though, still treating this as a good short entry. Luckily closed previous short yesterday at 5850. But yeah, did not expect this.

WTF are they smoking over there LOL?!?!

Talk about a false dichotomy...

How could they possibly think that one person "owns Bitcoin"? And why do they need to figure out who it is?! I can't even...

>What can we sensibly say?

Nothing, apparently.

EDIT: Ok wait a minute... this isn't actually an Independant article... it's an "Independant Voices" article... not that most noobs would notice anyways... but it's kind of like the "Forbes Articles" that we have been seeing over the past year that are actually just random blog posts... see https://www.independent.co.uk/voices
Quite possibly the worst cryptofud article ever written in terms of producing good arguments, consistency, and solid premises (only possibly beaten by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) report published last week.:) I'm not saying there is no chance they are  right in their conclusion, but the arguments was funny to read.

I am becoming increasingly interested in the interplay between the futures gap and resultant BTC price. It makes too much sense to play the futures and then buy/sell the physical BTC to get it where you need it to be. 

I don’t make enough money to do that of course, but if I could I would. 

So how does one monitor that gap and identify a pattern? I know this is the CME feed for example, but interpreting it is another challenge. https://www.cmegroup.com/apps/cmegroup/widgets/productLibs/esignal-charts.html?code=BTC&monthYear=N8&year=2018&venue=0&title=JUL_2018_Bitcoin_&type=p&exchangeCode=XCME&dataWidget=true&chartMode=dynamic

well, you are in the right place for comments.. thats for sure
I see your comment and add my comment
Why would you base a "turnaround" off the 4hr chart. For a full trend reversal you should probably be looking at higher time frames. 4hr can easily go bullish and still have it be a dead cat bounce.

Where's this coming from? Just curious, since we've never seen any trend last nearly that long w bitcoin
> >2 years, probably 6-8 years.

Shit. What's the best place to go long on Brent Crude Oil futures?
That’s the dumbest prediction I’ve heard thus far! 
They said that the last time when around 300-500 dollars.
All those up votes are priced in.
Is this a joke? Because if it is... it went way over my head.

Anybody care to explain?
I blindly longed BTC on bitmex when I saw a comment here asking why BCH was jumping. Didn't even look at the price. Latched on at 6000. The alts who lost the most are the best indicators of reversal (I don't mean of the bear market but I do think this might take us up to 8k for a week or two).
Ahem. I believe you mean the Coinbase Pro tip-off....
Since you asked, not sure if this is what you mean, but I posted this yesterday afternoon a couple hours before the pump:

“No one talking about the 500 BTC market buy and the four other 200 BTC market buys on BFX a half hour ago? I know it's very anecdotal, but I haven't seen market buys like that in a while.

Edit: In the last hour from right now: 1,804 BTC Market Buys to 211 BTC Market Sells 

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8uq6eg/comment/e1igeyy?st=JJ1GS9V5&sh=ea5046ce
because the walls before that were hidden

thats how I knew we were going to move up, because there were huge 1000+ BTC hidden buy walls on BFX absorbing orders 
Yeah, I noticed those too.  They weren’t budging and were moving up with price.  I got in at 5900 and 410 with 90% of trading stack and I moved my SL up immediately when I saw those walls.  I moved them up again on the second pump to 5% profit.  I’d hope I can get another leg up today so I can leave the 5% gain SL without the worry of getting stopped out on noise.  I’d like to sit in this position for a week or two but, I need a profit after getting chopped out of my last couple trades.  
I saw it happening in real time too... BCH pumped first and then the big buy walls on eth and btc popped up.  I was in BCH at the time and sold at 715.  Wish I would have had the foresight to jump into BTC or ETH right after I sold and before they pumped.  I was just so happy to get out of a horrible BCH trade green from the other day I didn’t make a move in fear that it was some anomalous weird pump.  But now in hindsight it was pretty clearly a missed opportunity.  Especially since BCH was leading the pumps on the last little run up.

Better than my usual buy high sell low strategy though, so I’m not complaining.  Sitting this one out until something breaks one way or another.  I keep forcing trades and then refusing to sell at a loss and getting raped.  Not today bitcoin.  Not today.
Zooming out really puts a different perspective on things imo. Quite similar to the 6 month period from 2013 to 2014 at the moment.
So, we can still fall to 4.3k and bounce back according to the logchart uptrend. Good. I will wait and buy the bottom.
My chart looks the exact same. It's got that channel going down. I still think $5.4k is the ideal spot, if I were to just go off the TA. 
looks more like a kick-in-the-balls kinda bounce
On my chart we've smashed well through that May downtrend line: https://imgur.com/MdGDu95

That being said, I still think the bear case is more likely
Supports and resistances are meaningless to bitcoin market makers, when the time is right we fall/rise through them like they are made of nothing. 
Do you even know what a swap is?
There's a page somewhere that lists everyone's current position from the bot, I don't remember the link though.
It's possible, but look at the volume.

It would take a long time...probably another 8-12 months, if not a bit longer.  And that's just talking about the next 5 years.  After that, anything is possible.

Yes I learned to short from $20K and sometimes it backfires along the way, but still way up from the shorts.  Don't you learn not to buy the top?   I guess not.
Good trade, but I think this is a premature exit.

Lots of new underwater positions from the past few weeks happy to get a chance to close higher
Kinda risky where are your stop losses ?
Yes, that's how an 8 week crypto bear market looks like.  You can turn that thing upside down and get a near perfect graph for an 8 week bull-market.
You are aware (ok, yo uare not) What a commercial reportable position is in this context? I run a business that trades as part of the business and we would NOT be a commercial activity.

But then, this is CBOE. Before making a joke about how bad bitcoin futures there are - did you check the rest? I give you a hint: Bitcoi nfutures are nr 2 (!) in activity.

CBOE is an "exotic" for any futures trader. I could never use them - refuse to pay their market rates for the one or two contracts they have that are tradeable when I can trade enough other things at the CME. And i know of no other futures trader that pays for the CBOE feeds. It IS a joke - CBOE is for options, not futures. They try to break into that field, but it is not really convincing.
Maybe they just wait for their tax returns ?

[What are you talking about](http://prntscr.com/k143ec)

- We've broken the ATH downtrend in the linear scale, that's not "nothing". That's a key trendline that's been invalidated.

- We've broken out of the falling wedge/channel for the first time since May

- No, we have not been here before. 


I don't know how far this rally will continue if any, but you're pretending like nothings changed.

"Everything I don't have a mental model for is manipulation."
I agree that the BTC market did not used to trade like this, but I don't think of it as "manipulation", so mush as bigger players with more money, who are really good at squeezing every penny out of less savvy traders. I guess that one could describe that as manipulation, just not in terms of it being unlawful or "unfair".

I am finding that the overall price targets/direction work out about the same, but with more fakeouts and sudden pumps/dumps.


In most markets investors would be swayed by rampant fraud.  But this community dresses up fraud with memes and celebrates it, so why not continue it and go bigger and more obvious with each round?  At this point each exchanges could just edit the price to 10k and this community would not blink, they'd just open their wallets and buy at 10k and wait to be dumped on.
Look at bitmex increase in volume and there is your answer

Shitpost
This article reads like a bot wrote it. 
Bullish
My take on 'this' is simple. Anyone who sold / is looking to sell sub 7k is way too late to the party and will likely end up getting burned at some point. Short term daytrading aside, this is the range to be (slowly) getting back in. 

As for short term daytrading... buying breakouts / selling breakdowns was a shit strategy for 6 months now. Sell at the end of pumps, buy at the bottom of dumps, works more often than not. Lots more money to be made by taking your 5% profits every time than trying to fish for that one elusive 20%+
Is it the bottom when I sell? Probably. 20k tomorrow because I'm currently in toilet paper
They like to just randomly add it. Dont think anyone knows before it just pops up
1) you are zoomed out, zoom in and it gives you a better idea what the order book looks like around current price

2) just means more people have buy orders than sell orders
Ya, this is a big recipe for massive disappointment if it falls below $6k again

My reasoning: this pump was primarily shorts closing/bottom sellers panic buying, not people interested in holding - lots of people are still looking to get out of the market on a bounce. First sign of weakness -> sell

idk how high we're going but until we breach $6450+ and close a 12h candle above it, I'm not thinking this relief rally will be as high as people expect (not yet at least) 

$6450 is also the bottom of the April downtrend, too.

Could be speaking too soon (and on wishful thinking) tho, market might head above it in the next few hours 

e: the beginning of the reversal (imo) will be a capitulation wick, bounce to retrace 50-68% of the  dump, then flat for a while. and then it will move into a perfect parabola -> blow off top. It won't be these silly short squeezes we're seeing
starting to agree with this view point

It's not futile.  A great deal of wealth was transferred from one group to another on that last manipulated pump.   

And yes, $5750 is extremely unlikely to be the low for the year.

> 2) Will 5800 hold the next time we visit it? Probably not. At this point retail traders should be permanently scared to go short at 5800, so no liquidity there.
   
If traders are scared to short and there's no sell side liquidity, wouldn't that be a point in favor of 5800 holding again?

Re: counter-sentiment, I think it's pretty funny how a lot of the "short everything! sell sell sell!!" posts nowadays, and especially the, "lol why buy here noob, buy in a week at 3k!" garbage is from accounts that have been going on about 50k ez back in December.

Hi Odbdb, we currently are not experiencing any issues with our login portal. If you are having trouble logging in I would suggest first trying to clear your cache or use a different browser, then if that still does not work opening a ticket with our support staff here: https://support.kraken.com/hc/requests/new 
that was a great move,   a 'short squeeze' play?
The process of moving coins from weak hands to stronger ones which locks up supply, and eventually results in price appreciation, can take time. Obviously those people are not interested in high prices so they won't market buy in a frenzy but let the price come to them. Patience is advised here, forget 15 min charts.
> my money is breaking down here and touching 56xx

Technically that doesn't make sense. If price breaks down here again, it's highly unlikely the drop would stop at 56xx. For the first time since 10k we can see a formation that looks like a bottom. Breaking it again anytime soon would be extremely bearish and I'd expect a straight move down to 52xx or 49xx even. I can't imagine how it could possibly reverse just $150 below the recent low.

In the other direction, hitting 6,700 doesn't suggest immediate continuation as 6,800-6,900 is resistance. The quicker price goes there now, the more likely it is to be rejected. Most bullish scenario is to range sideways for a few days, accumulate some shorts and then gradually rise to crack the resistance and revisit the bottom of the meme triangle around 7,200, then range some more above 7k.
Not by tomorrow.. might take some time. Also sticking to my short for now. 
It has crashed from 20k to 6 in a few months. It can go to zero.

[The top of this huge channel definitely didn't turn into resistance, either.](https://prnt.sc/k13bs7)  The line is only at like $50k right now, we can definitely get back above it! /s

Small short squeeze, bottom shorters/sellers panic buying, and the potential beginning of a relief rally after dumping 40% in 5-6 weeks.

2014 is literally vertical though. Literally. 2013 at least has some form of parabolic arc like we see with 2017's bubble. Personally I think 2013 was more natural than 2014, and the bear market ended right at the 78.6 fibonacci level and didn't go right through it into purgatory like 2014 did. 2014 doesn't even look like the average bubble chart. It had a very weird movement after the bubble popped. I mean look at it.
Well you have to remember we only had two exchanges one of which was doing all sorts of fucked up things (Willy bot). It was just a very very tiny market with very little liquidity.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/xTM191PD/  Major resistance is between 7,500-8,300.  At the bottom of that range we have the previous-support-now-resistance of the large wedge.  At the top of the range we have 62% fib retrace and weekly volume profile node.  My personal favorite place to short would be right after we break to 6/3's high (7,777).  Main issue is, where would you close your short if it kept going up?
I'm expecting this to be saturday pump, sunday dump (with the pump already done, maybe another test at 6500)

I just find 14D EMA more relevant because its 2weeks.

Right now we are trying to find support on the 4Hr 100EMA.

Works well. Seems to be a good resistance.

Still I think the 14D EMA has been more touched in the past. But I'll definetly keep an eye on the 21D EMA

The new [SEC proposed rule](https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2018/33-10515.pdf) states:

>The SEC is proposing a new rule that would permit ETFs **that satisfy certain conditions** to operate without the expense and delay of obtaining an exemptive order

But I highly doubt that bitcoin ETFs would satisfy these "*certain conditions*". From my perspective, it's just a rule change to allow "typical ETFs" (that have similar already approved ETFs) in a faster way. That being said, I didn't actually read that 286 pages rule change.

PS, I am definitely not an expert when it comes to SEC/ETF/etc, so don't care too much about my opinion.. I am just a nerd good in finding information (:

Oh, I'm absolutely playing with fire. I wouldn't necessarily recommend anyone follow me on this. But we're about $750 above the low in Sept futures from last week, and I only see a likely upside of either about $6800 or $7500. I'm not planning to ride this very long, I just expect a dip either here or closer to $6800, and figured I'd start scaling in now just to protect my profits.
I was just saying it makes a nice entry for my short if futures are already trading at a premium, because if this dumps I could potentially close for significantly below spot, and it reduces my risk for loss since it probably won’t go up much higher than spot even if it does go up a bit here.

Lol, that volume before the last few days in June absolutely stinks!
They expired on Friday.  I'm not super informed on them yet, so it's more just observing the interactions. It wasn't by accident when the pump happened. Some whale didn't decide to randomly pump it. There is always...well usually..a reason for a big move. Fundemental or technical. 
because nothing is happening, its been pretty much flat while it consolidates

now when it spikes up another $500 or starts crashing in a couple of hours, everyone will be in here 

"oh noez, rekt!"

For sure. It's just amazing to see bitmex trading between $6355.5 and $6356 for 15 minutes straight. It was starting to look like GDAX.

>  500 BTC market buy and the four other 200 BTC market buys on BFX a half hour ago?

Sounds like that tether is being put to good use.
Can confirm -  you can check post history if you like. I think Ward, some others and I were commenting on some very large market buys on BFX and some other interesting buying behavior a couple hours before the big pump (also large Short limit orders that were immediately being bought into). It wasn’t obvious nor was it guaranteed to go up, but some of the signs were there.


Let’s just ignore Mtgox, it’s not like it created a bear market or something /s
I doubt that we go all the way down without a breakout. It's more likely that we'll breakout to the top at one point, and then go down or sideways in waves until we get close to the old uptrend...
Broke through on linear scale, but not on log scale

No, I did not. 53 people trading just seemed so absurdly low. Together with low volume (https://twitter.com/BitMEXResearch/status/994424448349495296), I wanted to share 'additional evidence' against claims suggesting the 'futures' markets (and 'evil institutions') are driving/messing up the bitcoin price.

I don't use linear, I don't believe much has changed no. Multiple times this year we have broken upward through resistances in a similar way.
So whilst in a small sense some things have changed, no I don't believe anything of real note has occurred.  

I don't believe we have bottomed as I see no evidence for it. Now come back to me should we break the ATH high trend line log scale combined with a break above the daily Ichimoku cloud and things are clearly different. 
What a nonsensical non-sequitur.
Manipulation is buying or selling to move the market, not buying or selling to hopefully profit when the market moves in the direction that you are predicting it is more likely to move in.

It is also wash sales, where you buy or sell to yourself, as well as a few other tricks.  I don't have a problem with it being "unfair" and I've never suggested the Manipulators are doing something unethical or immoral.  I am just pointing out that they are manipulating the market.   I only do that here, because many people insist that manipulation does not exist, which I find offense my sensibilities of favoring the obvious truth and reality over the alternative.

At least it wasn't as bad a year or two ago when many more people here were either clueless or in active denial.


I honestly think at some point there is going to be a Justice Department witch hunt regarding the wash trading going on.  I’m not on board with the blanket “manipulation” conspiracy theories (bc getting people to cooperate on that level is insane) but, there is simply no way a large number of major players aren’t pumping/dumping into their own leveraged positions.  
And how would an exchange "edit" the price? 
Very true..people here love to be f**ked up the a$$ by both manipulators and regulators.
More bots read it than people so it all works out.
[deleted]
no one knows, most people who are bearish would guess 3-12 more months probably

2014 bottomed out early 2015 which would be early 2019 for us 

I mean some people think it's here though 
I think we could hit the final bottom soon like within 2-3 months but it will probably be another few months low volatility sideways before we start moving up again. I think 2019 will be bull market again though.
Not a year; the halvening is in 2 and that final year should be when mining is most profitable i.e. they aren't selling everything for electricity and transistors 
When bottom sir?
Yes it is unanswerable and not really even an important question, in terms of trading today's market.  I would say sometime next year is more likely than in three months.  But can certainly be a short-term bottom and then a 100% rise from that, before going to new multi year lows.

Defos not a hard n fast rule - but for perspective If you look at the history / length / span of the macro impulse vs retracement as a percentile of nr of days for every major correction since the inception of bitcoin (c. 2010 listing) you see the following:

Impulse 1 (346 days) / Retracement (164 days) = 47.4%

Impulse 2 (744 days) / Retracement to Jan FY15 (410 days) = 55.1%

Impulse 3 Jan FY15 to ATH Dec FY17 (1070 days) / Retracement YTD (199 days) = 18.6%

Not to say this is anything...but based on these stats we def not clear of the woods yet. another 3 months would take us to 27%. Again - doesnt mean shit. 
2014's bear market took about a year and a month.  2011's bear market took a little over 6 months.

The dot com crash took over two years.  The housing market crash took over 15 months IIRC.

So take those for what you will.  I wish it wouldn't take that long, but we might have 6 months more before we find the bottom.
If you aren't dca at these levels you are missing the point.
We're already past our previous trend reversal time... how long are you planning on waiting?
gypsy lol I don't think that's Arson. It's just tensorchart. it's a useful tool
Are you retarded? Do you think there's only one person using tensorcharts.com? /u/SloppySynapses please advise.

Your weird reddit shenanigans don't interest me guys.
> The reason is because the < sign means ⇒ less than, instead of less than or equal to (≤ symbol)

Yes, you're perfectly right. I just tested that. The different 1 vs 1.01 is clear: https://i.imgur.com/ygmI5Ui.png. Why is short term study like that stupid, though? My settings were off, but if they weren't, I'd find it short term meaningful. 

I understand the difference between < and ≤. Just somehow auto-assumed it was inclusive since there was no other option.

> You know, now that I think about it, there used to be another extremely famous Redditor around here (#1 top ranked poster in /r/Cryptocurrency!) who happened to use the same exact, incorrect settings.. but I’m guessing you probably just cribbed the settings off him.

I indeed have. Somebody posted a short tensorcharts study. This is actually when I discovered tensoncharts. It's in my posting history: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8qphc3/daily_discussion_wednesday_june_13_2018/e0malfz/ I actually inquired about those particular settings here: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8qphc3/daily_discussion_wednesday_june_13_2018/e0m34sw/

I am not "Arson", though. But I honestly feel unjustly prosecuted here. I already got a nasty DM about all this paranoia sourced by the gypsytoy guy. I am starting to fail to actually see a reason to take this anymore.
/u/sloppysynapses /u/hotsoccerman /u/jarederaj /u/Plaski /u/tenacioustedd /u/geodudebroman 

Un-fucking-believable.

How many fucking alts does this guy employ? 

Same language, same stories, same idolizing, same erroneous settings and hand-waving nonsense, same "gypsy is psychologically deranged, he's delusional" bullshit. 

If it looks like a rabbit and talks like a rabbit...
No, sell side liquidity from retail traders helps whales open large-scale long positions (and vice versa).
Nothing to do with short squeeze, this short squeeze thing is over-egged.

Quite simply a combination of us dropping like a stone for so long, combined with several rejected attempts at pushing the price below 5700-5800. I just got lucky with my timing.
Hmmmm, why would some people suddenly market buy 500btc+ then and creating extreme 5 min candles...?
I don’t think it’ll fall that hard that fast.  I thought when we hit 5800 it was over and it would be a mad panic sell rush... but it wasn’t
In my timeline it rallied from $180 to $6,390
You haven't been here long, have you? 
it could go to minus 5000

Yeah that's what I said, November 2013 bull run, not April 2013. But yeah I totally agree. November 2013 bull run and subsequent 2014 bear market was some weird fluke that should have never happened. 
Close now you will regret later. We have been down for 2 month straight since the last rally in April. At least wait for it to retest $7500. The bull case scenario is it might break up and retest 8300 before dropping again. 

Done trade emotionally !
What’s the CA of the underwater long? I think it’s too early to call this a reversal, def not the bottom, but the case to go higher still is decent. I’m expecting a small retrace and depends how that goes I might add to my long just a bit. 
It works well, and what's interesting is that we wicked generously into it for the first time since 10k, let's see what's next :)
Try it.
Thank you for your info, it is enough hopium for me today :D

Well I’m not an expert trader but thanks for the awesome helpful response! 
Every particle in your body exploding at the same time... iirc
There's no new retail money coming in, I doubt it'll get to $7k. This market is nothing but traders and the hardcore crypto crowd. Most of the people in my fb group are sidelining with buy orders scaling from $5.5k-$5k. 
How can I understand and track this future stuff more?
[similar, but not the same](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8uq6eg/daily_discussion_friday_june_29_2018/e1hmlmk). We've now retraced to the 38% fib.

Quite a few people [commented on the signs](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8uq6eg/daily_discussion_friday_june_29_2018/e1ij7mh/). I didn't notice hidden buy walls earlier, just the massive cash-buying into hidden ask walls and shorts rising. Considering where we were on the chart, that's what gave it away. Although I didn't expect such an impulsive move to be honest.
It didn't. China was the scapegoat for the bubble pop. When bubbles pop, scams/ponzis are revealed (madoff, bitconnect).

And Gox happened in Feb, and we had a nice recovery leading into summer. Why did we continue making new lows almost a year after Gox collapsed, especially with constant good news throughout the latter half of 2014?

Also, news doesn't change trends. Market was heading down regardless of Gox collapsing or not.

Agreed.  Also gotta shake out the "I'm in it for the technology brah!" people who didn't actually take any time to understand what they are talking about or how crypto's work.
"Support" was also $17,000, 14,000, 11,000, 9000, 8000, 7000, etc.   Those who shorted those support levels have done quite well.  Every support level eventually gets taken out to the downside and that is unlikely to change anytime soon.

yea I looked back and even in 2014 when weekly stoch crosses like this it rallies for a bit. But I'm not sure how stoch works- for example if this weekly closes green but the next red will it still be a cross? I don't know, not sure

And I'm looking for the big retrace too, I'm just in an awkward position now since I didn't close under $6k :( 

and thanks by the way, I appreciate that :)
like 2 months ago, why? 

Well I started shorting this waiting for a breakdown to $4.5k since $11.7k, february 20th. so like 4 months lmao. but specifically my open positions now- opened swaps on april 24th

edit: you can actually see most of my positions on the position bot. 

some of my sep entries are messed up now. but my entries were, $9650, $9300, $8300, and $7560
http://www.futuresknowledge.com/dictionary/commercial-commodities-trader/

You are totally wrong ;) It is not about profit - in fact, commercial traders mostly do not trade futures to make profit.

Commercial status is actually a CFTC based classification and among other things it means for example you do not have to put margin up (or very little) as you carry the underlying good.

Commercial Status would be for example a miner that uses futures to hedge sales prices. As tehy have a stream of bitcoins coming in, they don't have the risk of an unhedged position.

Let me quote:

> A trader that uses futures contracts in a particular commodity for 
> hedging as defined in CFTC Regulation. The trader is required to 
> file a declaration to this effect. A commercial trader needs to be 
> engaged in the business activities hedged by use of used the 
> futures or option markets.

Particularly given the low volume, geography and other exchanges - I dont't wonder we see no commercial activity reported ;)

Historically - the CME started their futures and announced a date, the CBOE jumped them (starting a little earlier) and that was it - MOSTLY it looks to me like a marketing stunt on an exchange few people have access to (for futures).
Kaima kamis hah’!
Did you ever ask yourself what the start of a turn around would look like?  Of course it will be gradual before it picks up steam and people trust buying "the top of the pump" again.  I think it is a fantasy that we just V bounce off a bottom and go up 2K and all of a sudden everything is okay.  This was a gradual grinding decline and this is what a gradual grind back up starts to look like.  How many times do you people want to test 5.8K before you're satisfied?
"Everything I do not understand is a non-sequitur."
Agreed
I am one of those who say that manipulation does not exist. That doesn't mean I don't think that everything you listed is happening, I agree that it probably is. I just don't think its manipulation. That is what the free market is for, that is what the orderbook is for. If you make it illegal than you are introducing interference into the natural market. That is manipulation.
Its really  annoying, This manipulation patterns is dificulting the life of traders and investors who are trying to follow the trend, in both ways. Every time market start following a trend we see a decrease in the intraday volatility and obviously an increase in leverage. At that point you can expect some kind of huge manipulated spike, and it is happening frequently. They are clearly trying to squeeze the market!   
Also, in a fully connected market, its very trick to figure out where the moves begin. Also its not clearly how many groups are doing it!  
In my opinion we are not in condition to try to ban it. Its a non-regulated market, with no clear rules.  
For regular traders my suggestion is to pay attention to the intraday historical volatility, dont be too leveraged and avoid to increase your position following the trend, at least for a while.
Ya sounds pretty reasonable, basically what I'm looking out for
already a month under 2 years away, gonna be fun
And 2013's was 3 months.
I've purchased as much as I'm comfortable purchasing in a declining market. 
At least a few weeks. Seeing a few BGD's in a day isn't enough to convince me that months of down trend is over. 
To be fair, Gypsy does have a track record of exposing liars and it’s not like he’s just pulling random stuff out of his ass. He’s citing actual evidence and unfortunately because of people like Arson, we have to be skeptical by default. It’s a good thing to entertain Gypsy’s comments and explore them without being dismissive. 

For Gypsy, I think it would be more productive to lay out the evidence in a less combative way. 

Also if I were accused of being Arson, I would just laugh and think it was kind of funny (and I’ll bet you would too) . If people get very defensive and respond with insults then that raises some red flags for me (but isn’t proof of anything of course.)
Like I said, 25 day old account. First comment written in the same "hi I'm new here, Mex charts totally *fucked*" style. 

I've never seen anyone besides arson post those tensor charts, which are conveniently re-oriented, as to not have the same layout as arson. 

High likelihood. Don't forget that you defended all his alts and DK's alts before too. Not exactly a great track record.
*Yawn* 

Come on, Arson. Ban evasion is so beneath you.

Oh wait, it's not.
he's a little paranoid, sort of rightfully so, since arson has quite a few alts around here. don't worry about it- arson really was one of the few people to use tensorcharts around here, although I obviously don't think you're him since I doubt arson is the only person in the world to use that tool lol
[deleted]
But you are delusional and clearly psychologically depleted. You just spent 4 hours typing like what, 20? 30? angry comments about this drama. How old are you for fuck's sake? This isn't normal even if I was your "Arson".

"Same language"? That's bullshit and your depression talking. "Same idolizing?" I've been talking with /u/SloppySynapses for a few days about a Bitmex interest study. Ask him. Or wait, you called him a liar already. Same TC settings? Yup, unfortunately. But history how I derived them is [public](https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8uzb6w/daily_discussion_saturday_june_30_2018/e1kht99/).

I actually googled you and "arson", and got this: https://www.removeddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/7s8umm/_/dt3lnzi/ Is this real, dawg? If so, it points out that you may be heavily PTSD-ed by all the trauma. I am not trying to be a c*nt here. You really may be. You should talk to a professional about it. Going full hysteria online won't help you. As those ads say "getting help is not shameful"

And I guess you will get your wish. I just got a nasty PM with somebody calling me a whore, clearly also thinking I am your "Arson". Good job fuelling the nonsense. Or maybe it was your alt, since you've got history of doing that too apparently. I am likely to abandon this account. I'll stick to just reading /u/bitcoinmarkets the way I've been doing it since November. 



Once they're done accumulating, to spark fomo. Or in certain circumstances, because rekting shorts is more profitable than trying to push down. 

Didn't look again, but for reference today on bfx there were 12k bids to 5k and 4k asks to 7k. 12, fucking, thousand, bids. 

Anyone thinking bitcoin is going straight to 3k is having a bad case of beargreed here.
"force" other ppl to fomo in

What a failure

You're posting some esoteric reference to "bart simpson 4.5%" whatever that means... you spelled "paw" as "pow" which confused me thinking you were talking about proof of work... and you're talking about bloody stinky bear skins which is just disgusting...

I'm actually long right now and do believe that the price will increase over the next few weeks FYI.

Just try to keep the discussion a bit more logical and you'll do just fine here!

Happy trading!
OH, sorry!
If we hit $7,500 I certainly wouldn't be looking to go long for very long...
It's an accidental long on ETH @470 opened by a forgotten stop loss.
Liquidation should be around 360-380 so it's not been that far away. It's mostly because it's near break even, i was more comfortable when it was deeply underwater since i had no intention of closing there, would be liquidated before closing. 

It's a 5X with 70% stack so it's a pretty big position.
I'm hoping ETH goes at least to 500 but that will mean BTC would have to test 6800 and might just be a wick without giving me time to act on it.

Going out to see Portugal and have dinner with friends now... 
Food could be abundant, we'll be able to grow meat soon, inflation may hit nonessential luxuries more. Plus OP said it's a promotional price if you pay in BTC, meaning they would be more expensive normally. Perhaps the ticket price is far more expensive.
I don't track the CME futures stuff, in case that's what you mean. However, Bitmex allows you to trade future contracts, which lets you hold a leveraged position until closing date at the latest without paying funding fees. Here's my response to a similar question I had yesterday. Let me know if this answers your question! [https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8uq6eg/daily\_discussion\_friday\_june\_29\_2018/e1idtq1/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8uq6eg/daily_discussion_friday_june_29_2018/e1idtq1/)

Neither 17k, 14k or 8k were six months bottoms... but 5800 was. Are you getting the point or not.
Yeah until it reverses and then its not so smart anymore. Very risky thing to do regardless of trend
Unlikely to change anytime soon? Have you been seeing all the good news out for crypto lately? This bear run is gunna run out of gas SOON (couple months)
and 6000, 5000, 4000, 3000, 2500, 1300, 300, 250, 166, 85, 40, 5, 2 etc.
Can’t believe a bot Is stalking you, looks like it will be defeated :) You mentioned that In order for CBOE & CMC to setup futures on an asset (btc), said asset needed a 100 Billion Market Cap. Anymore more info on if it falls below100 Billion? If 100 Billion is the minimum to stay in the market, well there’s the bottom, eh?
Ohh I thought I read that you re-opened a short position. Maybe I read it wrong.

Looks like whales have realized that you're too accurate and are a hindrance. I will heed your opinion :D
What are those downvotes :o 1 min comment at -6?
Never said I wanted a V bounce off the bottom. What I want to see is growth to the upside breaking key resistance points and barriers.

So far people have shit the bed because we had a tiny bounce and now apparently... The bottom is in!!

Of course the bottom could be close, I've already stated openly 5.3 or 4.9 have real potential for the bottom. 5.8? Not in my opinion no.

Now we'll wait and see what happens 
> Did you ever ask yourself what the start of a turn around would look like? 

yes, it will look nothing like this. you guys are very silly thinking a random short squeeze will be the beginning of a long term bull run. but this sub is basically now /r/ethtrader so 
"b-b-but the last bear went -80%+!! who cares if the biggest exchange went bankrupt, the sector wasn't mainstream and 400K btc got dumped for months!!!"
That statement is a non-sequitur as well.
Ok so you call a table, a "chair".  That is alright.  You can call the price going up a "bear market" too. Enjoy your "unique" personal definitions of common terms. 
Of course you can't ban it in an unregulated market, by definition.  Eventually, they probably will regulate the exchanges better, but depends on who pays off who quickly enough.


Yeah, I used to think that, and I tried to count that as its own thing.  But comparing that to the 2017 mid-year drop, it becomes harder to distinguish 2013's "bear market" versus the mid-bull 2017 drop.

The answer of course comes back to willybot - The bull market of late 2013 was fabricated on imaginary dollars.  Because of that it becomes impossible to untangle the true interest growth of late 2013 from the false willybot-driven volume.  So all I can conclude is that the early 2013 bear market wasn't allowed to run its normal course, and can't really be used as a solid historical reference.
they want u to buy mate 😜
Solid move.

My recommendation: Watch the volatility, especially the 30, 45, 60 day time period volatilities.  When those are all low, that has historically been the best times to buy.  We're not there yet.
if gypsy keeps at it we'll all be accusing each other of being arson- seriously. it doesn't really end- if you assume someone has infinite time to do so, why not assume literally everyone is him?

also, gypsy defended himself on his alt mmcakes recently. defended himself in the 3rd person...did exactly what arson did.

so I'm skeptical of the whole thing and honestly would rather just ignore all of it at this point. In general I'm wary of using this sub at all anymore because I think it's being manipulated in several ways to maintain different sorts of sentiment.

the downvote bot on me + influx of new characters here + all these "no you're the alt!" antics are making me like.......meh. cryptotwitter is generally better anyway
Easy for you to say you’d laugh it off.  There’s nothing funny about what’s happening here.  And maybe people get defensive because it’s not fun being falsely accused and trolled by a madman? 
I never defended DK's alt (there was only one) nor did I defend *all* of arson's alts. I defended /u/hcoalter once I realized I was just being overly paranoid. It really wouldn't be hard to start thinking everyone here is arson if we let ourselves get carried away mate
Your paranoia is ridiculous. Will you have the balls to publicly apologise when the mods will clear up your accusations, though? We shall see.
/u/jarederaj
/u/Plaski 

Please advice. I've been in close contact especially with /u/Plaski  when I joined this sub. I am pretty sure the mods can see my IP ranges and my location.
I didn't say he was the only person to use it. Certainly the only person I've ever seen post them repeatedly (or ever).

Check his post history, it's the same exact hand waving and posturing. I don't want to falsely accuse anyone but this is pretty obvious.
> Not only is it immature, but it is indicative of very bad parenting, poor moral character, a lack of impulse control, and possible Canadian citizenship (j/k about that last one). Your vote manipulation and brigading will fool idiots. If someone has to resort to that, or make secondary accounts in order to avert a ban to a sub where they are no longer wanted, then they have already lost.

Unless I am really not "Arson". Wouldn't that be in fact hilarious of you? Because I am really not. ;)
Let's start again: I am not "Arson". I have no idea who the guys is. I don't care what's the problem with him you and that gypsy character was. 

> will make you look very foolish while leaving little forensic doubt as to who you are.

You know what? Let's have it. This is a lost account anyway. *Let's have some fun*. Regardless if the mods clear me up or not, zombies like you or the gypsy guy will stalk me anyway. I can't possibly talk my trades with evil eyes tracking my shit anyway. 

Firstly, since you tried to impose on me your "intellectual authority", a bit naively, let's start from saying that "forensic evidence" doesn't leave any "doubt". It's unequivocal. It is either right, or it is not. You cannot have any against me. You may make shit up, but that's that. Was I stupid enough to copy TC settings off some random idiot in this sub? Yes, apparently. I joined this sub to learn. I already explained how that happened. Check my post history.

Secondly, since by trade I am an actually Unix operator, the only "evidence" here would be either my IP history or my User Agent history. Anything else, any charts and nonsense, is only coincidental and alleged, i.e. it will never prove anything. And my IP history will unequivocally show that I only used very particular Easter European LTE provider to connect and use my account. In fact I only had 5 IP changes since 3 June, so 2 days before I registered. This is a small ISP, subscriber only, requiring at least 1 year contract signed upon presenting a photo ID. It is very conveniently on a 20 bit IP range which is officially registered with RIPE. 

Next, another possible "forensic evidence" would be my User Agent history. I've been only using Chromium 67 series, which I built myself. This means I am on a very unique IP ranges of a subscriber only provider, using a development edition of a rare browser. I am quit fucking unique.

At this point I am ready to prove anything I've just said to any 3rd party with a HTTP server. I'll visit your site and you will record my shit to prove my point. More, I visited Moonmath site yesterday during my evening, which is between 6pm and 12 pm, UTC+2. Ask the guy in charge, /u/jarederaj was it? To check his Apache logs on that Red Hat of his, if he actually collects them. You will see visits from my ISP and my browser.

**Talk to the mods, petition fucking Reddit, I don't care, get my IP history, check this shit.** Only then and only in this situation you will prove anything. Anything else is hearsay. Then you will have you "forensic evidence", boy. In the same way "Arson" or any other random asshole I am an alleged copy of, will have to put their butt on plane/car/train, travel to Eastern Europe (east from Germany), sign up an LTE contract since all SIM cards need to be registered by law, and only then "fake" his activity in this sub through this account. 

Anything else you may come with will be bullshit. Sorry, dawg. 

Finally, I am perfectly capable of hiding my shit to the point I could be fucking your wife next room and you wound't notice. At very least, being a "clone" of anybody, I'd be on VPN pointing to a random country/location, and *not* my legit home connection, 'cuz that's retarded.

Looking forward to the nonsense you will spew back, i.e. your "evidence".
[deleted]
Just stop, bro. It's the same stupid argument over and over, packaged slightly differently. How about you get a life and stop trolling crypto under dozens of alts. The one who needs help is *you*.

Who gives af that you were PMing Sloppy? You've PM'd him plenty of times with other alts too. You're just trying to cover your bases but you are obvious af. Even more-so than DK.

Get fucked and go find something better to do. 
> I'll stick to just reading /u/bitcoinmarkets
>  
>  the way I've been doing it since November.

No, actually you'll just start using different accounts and *attempting* to better obscure yourself. Luckily you've got a number of clear tells and you can't write the same tireless, verbose bullshit that you used to. Any whiff of that crap is going to set off alarm bells, not matter what account you post from.


I wish I was popular enough to get a downvote bot 😎
Yesss
Misfortune?  That is certainly one word to use for being long in these markets.
There's plenty of highly upvoted bearish commentary. Just be respectful.
[deleted]
Switch to Nord or PIA.  Hide My Ass is pretty garbage.  They don’t keep up to date with bug issues whatsoever.  As of a couple weeks ago, I haven’t checked since, they were still leaking IP’s with the old webRTC bug.  You can check ip.voidsec.com if you want to check your own connection for leaks.  Security Now mentioned it on an episode a while ago.  The speeds not great either so...why deal with their terrible security?  
If you buy @ current price, I would suggest sell 50% of your stack when it tests 7500 (probably mid-July or sooner). Wait for it to dip back lower then rebuy. If it dips below 6400, I believe it is not a good sign.
Oh yeah remember you posting that one. It’s tough but I think we should know a bit more before the weekend is over where this is headed. 

Also go Uruguay!
What does OP's post even mean? What is real and what is facetious? I'm finding it hard to believe that Seattle Mariners are charging "one one-millionth of a bitcoin" for a hot dog so what does the post mean?
You're welcome I guess.
The stolen Gox coins we're sold throughout 2011-2012 and we're not sold in 2014. Every candle in 2014 was created by market participants using the same emotions they are using today.
Fascinating. It's like someone ran a merge request of KenM and /r/cryptocurrency
It is a bit. It did reply within seconds 
I get the point that I just made very clearly....the one that you do not want to acknowledge.
So if the price is going up, you are saying it's not smart to short.  Very insightful.
I've mostly been seeing bad news, at least news of any significance.  And I don't have magical powers to see the future with certainty like you do, so I will have to deal in probabilities.
Price hasn't been at those levels recently, except for 6000...which was support that fell and price dropped 4% below that.  Please try to follow the discussion.
Haha I know, this sub is great, it's holding the line on my comment karma. seriously people are really nice :) the bot is having the opposite effect!

But as for the 100b market cap, I'm not sure if it's a rumor or simply FUD/hopium (it can go either way, depending on how you frame it lol) 

/u/btcqq you trade on CME, right? 

do you have any idea if there's truth to the $100b market cap stipulation where BTC gets delisted if it goes below? Or is it only that it had to have a $100b market cap before it got listed? Or is that just a lie/rumor entirely?
Lol like I said, I'm no good trader until I can manage to close the bottom at least once. Until then I am potentially just really lucky at opening positions at the top. 😬

Actually I've longed the bottom twice. But it was a long time ago...like early February. And the closes were yet again very meh 

longed $10k could've closed $12.5k in two hours (this was the day when Gdax buy orders lagged and a bunch flowed through for an hour, causing the price to go to $12.5k over a few hours).. closed $11k. 

Longed $14.1k and could've close $17.2k...closed *$14.5k* tbf I was very new to trading back then. 
lmfao someone got a bounty on me head :O

I got haters bro

it's a downvote bot. it's gone from being funny to discouraging back to being funny again 
Somebody really hates /u/SloppySynapses and created a downvote bot. I'm guessing a permabull that is hurting.
Yep.. Small bounce to upside and people are STILL a big bag of raging bull hormones. Even after the year we've had and the overarching trend showing no real sign of reversal.

People quite clearly haven't exactly reached capitulation yet. Hate that word but fuck me maybe that's what some people actually need
Went there for the first time in months today...  it is funny how a prolonged bear makes people more open to TA, which I see way more of there now
You appear to be in denial dear boy. 
You think spoofing should be illegal? Why?
> Yeah, I used to think that, and I tried to count that as its own thing. But comparing that to the 2017 mid-year drop, it becomes harder to distinguish 2013's "bear market" versus the mid-bull 2017 drop.

There were several drops in 2017 of similar magnitude.  What's so special about the one in July?  And the first crash in 2013 was of vastly higher magnitude.
Some good advice from justsomebadadvice...

Will you post back when the time is right? :-)
> also, gypsy defended himself on his alt mmcakes recently. defended himself in the 3rd person...did exactly what arson did.

I saw that more like an "inside joke" for those that knew arson did the same thing. 

I'm skeptical too, but it does remind us that there are alt accounts here that are trying to sway our opinion to serve an agenda. In that light I'm glad Gypsy calls out accounts that seem to be Arson's alts (which you have to admit this one does look a bit suspect). Before I found out Arson was using a bunch of alts to sway opinion he was one of the people here I thought where worthwhile to listen to so I'm glad Gypsy shed some light on what was going on even if he seems to take it a bit far.
How many people has Gypsy accused in the last week? Is he actively going after lots of people? If so I must be missing it but I read most of what’s posted in here. Let’s not stop trying to uncover the truth for the sake of something that isn’t occurring, know what I mean? 

Also, has it been proven that gypsy used an alt to do exactly what Arson did? If so he should hold himself to the same standard that he holds Arson. 

Edit: Gypsy did not do what Arson did, not even close. 
What we need is some KYC on this sub.

Edit: joking.
> also, gypsy defended himself on his alt mmcakes recently. defended himself in the 3rd person...did exactly what arson did.

No I didn't. Go back and read. I ban evaded when arson got me banned. I was only "denying" that I was gypsy to make a point and mock the situation. I wasn't hiding anything.

Get a clue, dude. You are consistently on the wrong side of things.
What makes you think this individual is being false accused? This idiot is posting the same fucked up tensor charts that arson was. 

If *you're* not arson, why are you so intent on defending him?

Get fucked, stop ruining the sub with your acceptance of this bullshit. Shills and manipulators *of all sorts* need to find better shit to do with their time.

edit: Also, the account I accused *you* of being was /u/intellicheckidn and that account was permabanned after mods reported what happened to the admins. I don't understand how they didn't ban *both* of your accounts but clearly the incident was indeed a violation of ToS because they took action.

No clue why you would insert yourself into this conversation when you were also caught doing this red handed. Oh right, you're here to defend arson *for some reason*... Okay buddy...
I don't mean actively defended, I mean that you expressed extreme skepticism until the evidence was beyond overwhelming. Less-so with DK, more-so with arson.

I'm clearly not trying to falsely accuse people. 

I'm confident of this. 
What are mods going to clear up? How would they know anymore than anyone else here? Because what, you messaged them 25 days ago saying "Just letting you guys know, I'm definitely not Arson!"?

What are they going to *clear up*?

Also, yes, I will publicly apologize if it's **proven** that you're *not* arson.
LOL! Did you preemptively grease the wheels? "But remember when I joined? I told you guys specifically I *wasn't* arson!"

Clever. 
Mods do not have special knowledge about Redditors. We have the same kind if account that you have.
Do we really think arson is that dumb? Or is this just a case of someone using the same tool he did? Really gypsy it's not particularly surprising someone else likes tensorcharts. hell, I'd use it more if I understood how to use it
[deleted]
Funnily enough, 3 different people contacted me, including you, saying the same stuff basically. Let's see what the mods do.
Two weeks ago you couldn't explain why you deleted a comment that made no sense and then immediately posted the same comment under your other account, /u/intellicheckidn, an account which is now banned.

I gave you numerous chances to explain yourself and all you did was lie and then fail to produce evidence you supposedly had.

Liar and sock. Go away!
But I am not your "Arson". You can't even imagine it now. You attacked a perfect stranger. That's how fucking driven this made you. 

Humour this thought for a second. That actually you're completely wrong. Honestly, did you for a second think about that? Scary huh? That's your reality, dawg. Good luck trolling this sub. 
hahaha it's simultaneously irritating and flattering
By "misfortune" I obviously meant someone's financial losses. That respect should swing both ways, btw, bears and bulls alike.
There is an occasional upvoted bearish comment.  For the most part any hint of bearish sentiment gets down voted into oblivion.
[deleted]
I think the bot will have a bug that might delete your entries :)
(not really counting on a win today) 
I think one one millionth is like 14 decimals out, so technically less than a satoshi, is it possible to pay less than a satoshi? Maybe i'm not sure, perhaps off-chain it is
I'm not saying it is 100% guaranteed that we won't ever break this support, but this price is much more critical than the previous ones. 17000, 14000, 11000, 9000, 8000, 7000 were not six months bottoms. 5800 is the six months bottom tested 3 times. 

The comparaison you made is not pertinent. Stop being so stubborn.
Risk management
sounds like bullshit.  There's single stock futures with under 100b market cap.  And bitcoin market cap is meaningless anyway.  Volume would make more sense for de-listing, because the spreads get too wide on some contracts.  But I don't know.


I’ve had the same issue actually. I caught the tops at $11.8k and $10k, as the buyer exhaustion and failed rally was readily apparent. However, the bottoms have been harder to call.

This is actually what has made me think we have been in a huge descending triangle all along. It seems like knife-catching has been occurring around $6k with the intent to re-distribute at the top. And for each top, buyers have become exhausted at lower and lower points. If this were a descending wedge or some other formation, I feel like the selling pressure would likely be greater near the top than it is. However, it seems more like buyers are getting exhausted at lower and lower points, while horizontal support levels have been consistently tested.

With repeated tests, these support levels will likely break down, eventually pushing us further down until selling pressure is exhausted and we start seeing rounded bottoms like we’ve been seeing at the tops. That’s when I’ll start looking to buy in long-term.
it's weird, the sub is getting *more* bullish the lower we go. I actually think we're close to a big ol' dump still because the panick-y feeling is starting to set in for a lot of them
I don't have a bag of raging bull hormones. If you read my comments for the past month, i've been quite bearish. I never said we bottomed, I said you're turning a blind eye to a fact. Just because you don't use the linear chart doesn't mean crossing the ATH trendline is *nothing*. I certainly don't think we are going to the moon but this should be the start of a long overdue relief rally. You clearly did not read my comment carefully and are putting words in my mouth.
Congratulations...a straw man and a non-sequitur in the same post.
Holy shit what a name.
Yes, it was.  In my opinion, that was supposed to be the beginnings of a bear market.  Only in hindsight does it seem pretty obvious that willybot broke the bear market and rebuilt the hype prematurely.  Ultimately that probably made 2014 WORSE, so I'm inclined to think that this bear market will be less bad.
Sure thing, I'll generally post as I reverse from bear to bull
The thing is also that people need to be accountable for what they read/think is fact .

Ultimately if you spend enough time here, you start learning who the regulars are and their track record with their trades (u/_chewtoy is a perfect example) regardless of how many people upvote or comment agreeing with them.

When Galileo was telling everyone the earth revolved around the sun, he got down voted to hell and anyone saying it was the other way around was praised and upvoted. Regardless it didn't make Galileo any less wrong.

My point is, if someone has a bad track record, no amount of upvotes or comments from randos should change your opinion.

People just need to be skeptical of everyone always until they prove things otherwise
Was it a joke? he needs to stop doing that...it doesn't look like a joke. It just confuses everyone. 

oh well I can't keep up anymore. 
> one does look a bit suspect

How do I look "suspect"? In this situation you guys need to spell this out: What did I do wrong here? Used tensorcharts? Or the "first time caller" phrase? I am not a native speaker. I mean. English is actually my 2nd foreign language. 

probably like a dozen/two dozen people, it's getting a bit out of hand
I mean increasing the burden to post wouldn't be a bad idea. You have to sign a Bitcoin message to get an invite to the slack channel. Implementing something similar here (along with other fixes) wouldn't be the craziest idea. 
eh this is too complicated for me, I can't keep up anymore. I imagine I'm not the only one tired of seeing it anymore. Arson wins the war of attrition against me I guess 
I begin to think you're arson. Prove you're not.
I am sorry the internet broke you to the point you're driven by this kind of psychosis, dawg. I really can't help you. You're assaulting and harassing me for no reason.
who gets in touch with mods as soon as they join a sub?
> Do we really think arson is that dumb?

Yes. Look at the massive number of examples of stupid mistakes he's made. Also, look at how delusional and stupid his analysis is. Nothing is too stupid or unethical for arson.

>Really gypsy it's not particularly surprising someone else likes tensorcharts. hell, I'd use it more if I understood how to use it

Dude, are you ignoring everything else I said? Did you read his initial post? It reads just like all the others. The fact that he's posting tensor charts (repeatedly, on CC too) is just *additional* evidence. I've literally never seen anyone but arson post those.

Do you think that arson isn't walking amongst us? Do you think he took his ban and walked away?

No, he's right here, probably with a bunch of new and bought accounts.

Come on Sloppy, you've already seen him do this with *tons* of alts. Be on your toes.
> This is really how you think an innocent person would respond? Lmao

Why wouldn't I respond? You have shit. Mostly because i am not "Arson". You made a threat. Deliver.

> You made your choice. So just sit tight.

IP history in hand, or it didn't happen. Don't be an idiot at this point. If I am an alleged clone of such a Reddit criminal that guy apparently is, get proper administration involved.

Anything else will be just pulled out of your ass.
lmao! Try harder, Arson, you've pulled this same maneuver a dozen times at this point. You need to mix it up and find new tactics. 

Were these 3 people that contacted you other accounts of yours?

Come on bro, weaksauce to the nth degree.
> Humour this thought for a second. That actually you're completely wrong. Honestly, did you for a second think about that?

Actually I did. See all the comments above where I qualified my comments and offered to retract and publicly apologize should I be proven wrong.

But I'm not wrong. Same stupid insults, same stupid charts, same stupid settings, same writing style, same stupid "hi I new here! hurr durr nonsense".

:/

99% confidence
I wasnt laughing at any inidividual losing $.  I was laughing at all the people who are delusional about this insignificant meaningless move.  Just as I laughed at people when they though the market had reversed as we tested 10k.
Dude we have tons of upvoted bearish commentary in these threads. If the post is quality it largely gets upvoted. Yesterday's top post was chewtoy theorizing we may be on our way to the mid 1500's. That's as bearish as it gets.
You realize it is a joke, right?
I disagree that this one is more "critical" than the previous ones.  It is more significant to you, because it just happened.   When this one is broken, then the next support will be more critical to you.
More wisdom, but you didn't point out yet that's not good to buy when the price is going down.
Yeah, I mean think of where we are...we can't even pass April's low. Half of the buying seems to be short squeezes. Every rally in the past few months is a short squeeze. At some point there are no shorts left to squeeze and there's simply no genuine demand at these price levels.
I agree completely. This is highly likely another DCB, people will get there hopes up to ridiculous levels again and then suffer hugely when we drop back down and the big big dump comes in.

It's been repeating since Jan and I see no reason yet for that to end.


I didn't say you specifically in terms of the bull hormones! Some people most certainly do though.

Also again I wasn't singling you out in terms of stuff like, we've bottomed out and the bear market is over. I understand that something happened the other day with the small pump however I don't believe it has any real significance as it currently stands. I do get why if you use linear then it certainly looks OK at this stage. 

Now if the price breaks log ATH and as I said before the daily Ichimoku Cloud or clearly gets back above the weekly cloud then I'm all for stating that I believe the bear market has ended.

I think I just get fed up with those here who refuse to see the bigger picture and believe that because they want bitcoin to go up soon.. Then it will. I don't believe this to be you though, far from it.


You're dumb dude. Just stop. Every time you don't want to respond you just cry strawman or some other bullshit. Get a grip
I think the effect of the willy bot has been way overstated.  The market is far too powerful a force to be so easily manipulated.
Yeah, if you go back and look at all my fighting with arson, I was heavily downvoted for most of it. It didn't stop me from speaking truth to power though and ultimately I was vindicated. The votes and counts in this sub are as manipulated as anywhere else on reddit.

Fuck this place in a lot of ways. I wish mods were much more heavy handed with rules and moderation. I would instantly join a private sub with the 20-30 of you that I actually respect. Filtering through all the bullshit here is like pushing Sisyphus' rock up the hill.


> oh well I can't keep up anymore

Right, almost easier to figure out which way the markets going than to figure out what's really going on here half the time lol


What are you even referring to? When did I "recently" do this? Are you talking about months ago when mods banned me and I ban evaded and sarcastically said I was a different person? Do you not see how I was just getting the last word in before mods hit me with ban evasion? While at the same time, making a point about plausible deniability and whether mods were able to extend the same courtesy they were extending to Arson.

That's totally not the same thing. 
> How do I look "suspect"?

Just several similarities like language usage and syntax along with you responding to the accusation in the same way Arson's alts did. 

I'm not saying you are or aren't an alt account, I have no idea and if you're not I'm really sorry you're having to deal with this. 
>probably like a dozen people 

Man, Arson has been busy 🤭

If it really is getting it of hand, then people who are accused should take it up with the mods and let them sort it out. Gypsy has the right to be skeptical and post his opinion here. If he does it in a combative way though, he shouldn’t expect support from people. 
> probably like a dozen/two dozen people

Wow what the fuck are you even talking about?

When/Where? I haven't even mentioned arson in a week.

You're just pulling shit out of your ass.
this has crossed my mind recently lol, especially since gypsy defended himself on his alt mmcakes by referring to himself in the third person as gypsy.

it's alts all the way down man
> You're assaulting and harassing me for no reason.

It's funny. Arson said the same thing.

"You're crazy, you're harassing, look at all these other comments agreeing with me."

Turns out i was right.

:/
Yeah really. Eagerly awaiting this explanation.
I've just messaged /u/spez asking him to reveal my account history to mods in /r/BitcoinMarkets: https://i.imgur.com/22m6yg4.png

/u/jarederaj/ /u/plaski/ 

You do you, but the schadenfreude doesn't leave the impression that you're a classy guy.


If the post is bullish in any way it gets upvoted regardless of quality.  Are you really trying to argue that bullish and bearish comments get upvoted equally?  Thanks I needed that laugh.
Ya
yup, https://www.tradingview.com/x/k3wTnbLF/ is what im looking for for a reversal personally 
The conversation speaks for itself.
Willybot purchased 600,000 bitcoins with imaginary dollars.  Today we notice movements involving only 6,000-15,000 BTC, and there's many more Bitcoins circulating today.

Yes, Willybot [absolutely drove the price bonkers.](https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/15/researchers-finds-that-one-person-likely-drove-bitcoin-from-150-to-1000/)
lol for real though man
I saw you defend yourself in a comment on mmcakes. You referred to yourself as gypsy. in the third person

I thought it was really odd, apparently the joke went over my head. 

Anyway dude I rather just avoid this stuff. People keep calling on me to defend them from you and I can't tell who's genuine or what anymore. the downvote bot on my head, the random arson alts mixed with genuinely new people...it's all too complicated and confusing and it's putting me off entirely from this sub knowing how many people try to manipulate sentiment and reputation and whatnot

Mods need to do something before it gets out of hand

e: there's the downvote bot again lmao someone wants me out of here. I think I'll take a break for a bit this is exhausting 
I am truly not him. But hey, at least I am getting the famous "full reddit treatment" now. ;)
I don't think it's conducive to a welcoming subreddit. Imagine you use tensor charts and want to post your thoughts and you have this guy down your throat accusing you of being some random ass dude you've never heard of before

Not only discouraging but probably a little frightening. 

this whole thing is getting out of hand and the sub is being cluttered with nonsense & drama now
Actually /u/SloppySynapses is lying. I haven't publicly accused anyone of being arson since he was banned.

The only thing that's happened since his ban is that someone messaged me with a big list of additional accounts that they had apparently connected to arson. I forwarded these along to the mods but didn't make the list public.

Sloppy is completely off base here and doesn't understand that I wasn't deceiving anyone with mmcakes, I was simply ban-evading when arson got me banned because I wanted to make a scene and a point. That's not the same thing.
Oh Jesus Christ, man. Respect for you is once again lost.

Ban evasion is not the same thing as sock puppetry and I was merely getting the last word in. I had already *openly* connected the two accounts on multiple occasions. I was only denying it while I was ban evading to sarcastically mock the situation and get the last word before they banned that account. 
Ask /u/Plaski . Go ahead.
Nothing is equal, what I AM saying is that vapid, nonsense posts, bearish and bullish alike usually get downvoted, while quality analysis post are almost always upvoted regardless of their conclusions. 

Go find me 3 quality posts that add to the conversation today that are in the negatives and link them below. I'm willing to be wrong, here's your opportunity.
I can't disagree that there is a lower bar for quality when it comes to this sub upvoting bullish content- but saying you want to laugh at people when they lose money is too far. 

It's a bit shitty because people here are basically encouraged to laugh at people shorting ("haha hope they lose all their money") but let's not stoop that low...
Sure, it had an effect, I just don't believe the effect was so overwhelming as to make for a majority of the rise.  And most of the bitcoins around now were mined before 2013.
Hmm, that is a lot of downvotes... do you really have a bot on you?
Man don't leave for good, you're one of the best posters here. With chewy, mandy, and others posting less it's getting bleak
> there's the downvote bot again lmao someone wants me out of here. I think I'll take a break for a bit this is exhausting

You're a respected and active poster in this sub, whoever wants you gone surely can't be up to any good so I really hope you don't leave and let them win.

Are you referring to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/86qr6h/daily_discussion_saturday_march_24_2018/dw8djnj/)?

Like I explained above. I was being sarcastic and invoking plausible deniability. I was getting the last word in after mods banned me (wrongfully banned, as mods have since admitted). I had already told you and plenty of others that that was my old account *and* my TV charts and so-forth have always been mmcakes (and always will be, because I'm not hiding anything).

>e: there's the downvote bot again lmao someone wants me out of here. I think I'll take a break for a bit this is exhausting

Yeah, turns out crypto reddit is all sorts of fucked up but I wouldn't assume *all* the downvotes you're getting are illegitimate. The equivocating you're doing in the above comments is pretty absurd.
So 25 days ago you just decided to get a reddit account and start posting extensively about Bitcoin? What were you doing beforehand? Why is your writing style similar and your little introductory speech matches so many other similar stories told by dozens of other arson alts?


If it walks like and arson and talks like an arson...
Like I said, Gypsy should probably work on *how* he brings stuff like this to light. If he were more measured in his approach, then it would solve your issue of “scaring people”. But at the same time, this is reddit and if you’re going to put yourself out there,  you should expect to have your intentions questioned and not just taken at face value. 
It’s hard to keep track of everything, so give old Sloppy a break - I highly doubt he’s saying anything other than what he believes to be true. (He’s also dealing with a fucking downvote ICBM atm, could you investigate that?!) 
[deleted]
I just can't even keep up w it anymore man.. was it a joke? if so you've taken the joke too far because it's just confusing now
Lol that was not my point so I will not being participating in that excercise.  Time to stop this ridiculous discussion, gl with your long (you will need it).
Yeah I think so

*Not arson*
Yes it's been on me for a few days now lmao.. Was funny at first but can't tell which downvotes are real or not now. It's random, so I can't tell when I'm downvoted for posting  a bad comment or it's the bot.

it's actually really discouraging tbh
Thanks man :( some of you guys are really great, I love yall.

this downvote bot is just doing a number on my head 
Thanks dude that means a lot :( really thanks, but I know there are people here who get tired of seeing my name...I just want to try to tone it back a bit, make sure my comments are high quality instead of emotional or unoriginal 
I just think there is an influx of new people after the recent drop and don't know any better 
Oh I'm sure some of it is real. But I can't tell anymore

Anyway, I should just not say anything- I really can't keep up with this stuff anymore. too much stuff going on for me to keep track of

I saw you defend yourself in a comment recently. or someone posted it recently. it was a screenshot of you defending yourself, referring to "gypsy" while on mmcakes.

You responded to the accusation nonchalantly and blew it off but I thought it was really odd
What did I do exactly to "to have [my] intentions questioned", though? You're arguing this like I was somehow at fault here. tensorcharts is a great tool and I will use it.


you know the downvote bot was funny at first but since it's random I can't tell anymore when people are downvoting me or the bot is. It's genuinely a bit exhausting and disheartening
Lol, I've certainly been on the receiving end of vote brigades and bots. I'm not trying to be harsh with /u/SloppySynapses, but it's a little upsetting that one of the people who originally defended arson and got me kicked out of the sub is still so stuck in the wrong frame of mind regarding this stuff. I can understand apathy, but equivocating and conflating my (extremely brief) ban evasion with arson's extensive use of socks and manipulation is defamatory. His claim that I've been randomly accusing people is complete BS. My list of accounts only ever reached 10-15 to begin with and I haven't accused anyone since he was banned.

We are not the same. I am, on-balance, an honest dude, even on the internet. In fact, I (obviously) work pretty hard to force *others* to be honest as well. 

It's insulting to not recognize this and to continually doubt my motivations, sanity or integrity. 
Didn't you write and delete a comment and then post the same comment 30 seconds later from a different account?

Didn't you give a bullshit excuse? 

Didn't you lie and obfuscate?

I'm not lying about shit. You fucked up and got caught. Don't shoot the messenger. 

edit: Also, the account I accused *you* of being was /u/intellicheckidn and that account was permabanned after mods reported what happened to the admins. I don't understand how they didn't ban *both* of your accounts but clearly the incident was indeed a violation of ToS because they took action.

No clue why you would insert yourself into this conversation when you were also caught doing this red handed. Oh right, you're here to defend arson *for some reason*... Okay buddy...
No, I think you and the other poster are referring to different incidents. You, I think, are referring to when I got banned and I showed up to rant under my **old account (not a concurrently used account)**. Ban evasion and sarcastic "I'm not gypsy" is not the same thing as sock puppetry. I was pissed and was making a point (and getting the last word) on **one occasion**. 

I think the other poster was referring to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8s5wxa/daily_discussion_tuesday_june_19_2018/e0y1ip8/) or a few other similar jokes I've made since arson's ban. (also other people are making this joke and claiming to be me -- none of those other people are actually me).
I don't recall saying if I was short or long, but I guess ill take the random jab as a sign that you can't back up your claims. Do us all a favor and think before posting in the future.
To cheer you up a bit: https://i.imgur.com/FNEgecr.png Relevant. It means you really pissed somebody off, likely, by being right.
Time for a secret alt lol
I also think you're one of the best posters here but that doesn't mean you don't have your flaws.

1. Sometimes you mock and troll in kind of a mean way. It's not extreme by any means, but I've noticed an uptick recently and you might be losing some cred because your attitude has shifted.

2. Occasionally your biases really shine through and you fail to hold yourself to an objective measure.

3. You don't always respond to tough questions / critical discussion. Sometimes you just bail at the most obnoxious time or because you don't have a good follow up. 

4. You seem hesitant to change your mind sometimes or take in new information. 

5. You engage in sub drama but are *often* on the wrong side. In terms of the arson situation, you made the whole thing noticeably worse from the very beginning. Your comments only served to make the problem worse and enable him. You unfairly castigated me for standing up for the integrity of the sub, which was already a thankless task before you weighed in negative remarks. Furthermore, you also derided my somewhat-joking aspiration to become a mod. You laughed off this idea and didn't respond when I pressed you for reasons why I would be a bad mod. In fact, I think I would make a great mod and I think you're failure to see why has a lot to do with your flaws in other regards.

Not to rag on you too much. I do think there is something a little off with your attitude though. I don't really understand how a seemingly smart and honest person can routinely take the wrong side of sub drama. I get that you're *claiming* to not be keen on getting involved in sub drama, but you seem to insert yourself quite a bit.
Not gonna lie and I'm not going to get into this past this one post, but I will say I've seen Gypsy accidentally respond to himself as Gypsy a few times commending his analysis in just normal market commentary; it always gets deleted soon after.

Idk I'm a skeptic of both him and arson.
Well I have no clue what you're referring to if not the comment I linked above. There was a BCasher following me around for a while that I had conversed with prior to him becoming extremely upset with me. During our PM conversation (because I was banned from his homebase /r/btc) he claimed to be a 2011 Bitcoiner. I called bullshit because his account was only 9 months old. I said I'd been around since 2013 and he said that was bullshit because my account age. I linked him to my old account, where he saw that original exchange, which I linked to above. He was copying and pasting a comment that linked to that ordeal and claimed that I was using socks. This is ridiculous and untrue as I already laid out above. 

You could make an argument that ban evasion is wrong and unethical but it's not the same thing as sock puppets and manipulation. In fact, it's not even close. I wanted to get the last word in and not be banned unfairly. I knew mods and others in the sub new I was mmcakes. The "denial" I issued was for effect only, I did not think I was fooling anyone, nor was I trying to.
Sorry if it came off that way. If you’re not Arson, then of course you did absolutely nothing wrong. People who are paying attention are just a bit extra skeptical atm and you’re unfortunately caught up in it. If you aren’t Arson then try and let it roll off your back, man. Not sure what else to say. 
Yeah, I was genuinely impressed when you laughed it off tbh but it has to be pretty upsetting. What can be done about that, how can I help? 
Lmfao that's hilarious, thx mate
There's a fine line between secret alt and sock puppet, but the line certainly exists. I would not find fault with Sloppy or anyone else using an alt in an ethical way. At some point I'm going to dump this account (way too much baggage at this point) and start anew. I haven't decided if I'll identify myself as gypsy or not. Probably not publicly, because it just causes headaches with the group of folks that hate me (which primarily consists of the BCash cartel).
I'm just waking up and am totally out of it. this is a really fair criticism and I'll take it to heart, give me a bit to respond in detail, I'm like lightheaded from lack of sleep

!RemindMe 8 hours "respond to gypsy if you haven't yet"
He does it as a joke sometimes I guess? but I can't tell if it's a joke all the time. It's all very confusing. Like I said- way too exhausting to keep track of and simply not worth it. I will just judge every comment on its own merit regardless of who posted it 
I'd have to find it. I generally believe you but I also want to warn you: if you make people paranoid they will eventually be paranoid of *you* as well. That's why you don't want to rile the sub up. People rather not deal w this shit- it should be dealt with in private under the radar. Just don't accuse people publicly of being  arson anymore imo, it's too messy and the sub will turn into "no you're arson!" 
How can I prove that I am not "arson", though? Treat this as an abstract exercise for the mind. I indeed joined recently. I worked with /u/plaski to figure out the filters in here since I couldn't comment at first. Apart form that I am just a random user on reddit. Was "arson's" nationality or location known?
Dude you're a really nice guy, thanks. You just made my day :( 

I'll be okay, the Admins should be looking into it soon. It's probably a hint that I have an overwhelming comment presence here anyway. I should tone it back either way :P 
Well, also hilarious would be for that "arson" character to actually read this drama laughing his ass off how psychologically destroyed /u/gypsytoy is. Even more ridiculous if he actually upvotes gypsytoy only to encourage him more. Imagine that. 
I mean we should probably recycle our reddit accounts more often just as basic opsec once you've identified yourself as having BTC, even though I'm far from a whale

Still waiting...
Yep, agreed. I come here for opinions on the market not drama so try to judge the analysis, not the person.
Like I said, I don't want to accuse people falsely and would feel very bad for doing so. There are plenty of additional accounts that I'd tagged as "probably arson" but haven't commented publicly about, for this very reason.

There's only so much the mods can do. They're working with the same data that we are (they can't see login details and it doesn't matter anyway because arson is using TOR or something to spoof his IP [or Admins just don't give af]). Commenting publicly is a dirty way to handle it but sometimes it's the only thing that works and people should be aware that this is going on. 

I'm not saying OP is 100% conclusively arson or arson affiliate but the circumstantial evidence is certainly there, imo.  Enough to speak up. 

If there turns out to be additional reasons to think he's *not* arson, then I will retract and apologize. 
Hard to prove a negative. The burden of proof isn’t on you, it’s on Gypsy. You don’t need to prove anything. Like I said, my advice is try and let it roll of your back, wish I had more to offer. 
Oh fo sho dude, and glad the admins are looking into it. 

I think we could all use a bit less reddit in our lives, and speaking of that, I shall take a few hours break right now to watch some golf (which is only slightly less boring)- cheers bud. 


Oh yeah, I'm totally psychologically destroyed. Arson (i.e. you) totally shattered me, bro!

Try harder. This crap is too easy to spot. 
> even though I'm far from a whale

Okay, buddy. ;) Your secret is safe with me. ;) ;)
I just saw you accuse several people of being arson with very light evidence so I'm worried you're scaring off innocent people is all. 
You're right. I messaged the mods. Let's see what happens.
Cheers mate thanks again, you're a great dude. Enjoy 
Message /u/plaski and ask for a confirmation that I am not your Arson. I already contacted him. I've only use a single home provider, with a very tight IP ranges, and located in a very particular location and country. No VPN or proxy. A subscriber only network. Confirm it.

When that happens, take a good look at yourself today, your hysteria, denial and anger, and everything you typed, and how you typed it.
For real though watching a series on how they caught Ted kacynski based just off analyzing his writing in the 90s, it's probably trivial to figure out most of our basic info
I said I was skeptical of a few that were coming to his defense. I may have briefly snagged one or two innocent bystanders, but pretty sure all the accounts that I unequivocally said were arson were/are in fact arson. I asked several defenders *why* they were randomly jumping in to his defense. A few people, like you or /u/justsomebadadvice and a handful of others had their reasons for attacking *me* and not him, but there were a bunch of random accounts that showed up that were just parroting his fake ass bullshit. 

Like I said, I'm not trying to falsely accuse anyone, but I'm also going to weigh in when it's obvious, like it is here. 

Arson has obvious tells and when enough of the evidence all lines up, then it's almost certainly him. 

There's no way in hell that he's abiding by his ban. He's here, probably under several accounts, probably starting to build up a new main account because of the damage done to the arsonbunny account. 

It's a fucked up situation with no easy solution. The best I can do is to call it as I see it. Heavier moderation presence would be welcomed. 

No clue what's going on with those -9 downvotes you had earlier on one of those comments. That doesn't seem right. That's a fucked up situation too and just goes to show how rotten this place is from the core. 
How would he be able to confirm that? Mods don't have access to IP logs. 
Yeah I'm sure AI already exists that can figure out most of the internet. 

What's the series? Is it good?
Manhunt: Unabomber. Really good except for a couple parts overly fictionalized
