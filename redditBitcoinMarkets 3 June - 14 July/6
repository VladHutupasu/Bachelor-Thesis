[Daily Discussion] Monday, July 09, 2018 -- TITLE
#New post: [\[Daily Discussion\] Tuesday, July 10, 2018 →](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8xlbz1/daily_discussion_tuesday_july_10_2018/)
Quick bit of TA to show what I'm looking at... 

I personally think there's going to be a bit more downside in the next 24-48.  I would be cautious taking any position here however as we're smack in the middle of $6800-$6900 resistance and $6400-$6500 support. 

[I'm watching the current bull flag, and these two trend lines as points of interest for a trade.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/7nPyZUHO/)

The bottom trend line is certainly more sturdy with 3 points of contact, and is a setup for a potential bounce at ~$6550.  The more aggressive trend line intersects at ~$6600.  Either of these are potentially good positions for a long with stops just below support.  So far buyers have been consistently picking up price just below 50EMA and so this is something to watch.

If we happen to fall below the bottom trend line, I'd expect a retrace to $6200-$6300.

Daily RSI was able to break above 50, and 3d MACD just recently crossed to the upside.  There is the real potential for this to move into the $7k range this month. [Stair-step, break resistance, test support, little bit of who's your father, double top off the bottom of the meme pennant then dream crush our way to the high fours.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Z8Fx7nuP/)


Sure is quiet in here.

What do you guys mostly use when making trades? Id say I trade most often from:

* RSI and divergences 
* Horizontal support / resistance
* Bollinger bands
* General "feel" from watching orderbooks
* News (occasionally)
* FOMO (need to eliminate this one)

Things which I have looked into but haven't found useful at all are:

* Ichimoku (you can put the cloud almost anywhere with different timeframes and settings, and edge to edge trades for example seem to fail just as often as they complete.
* Candle formations (again, they seem to fail as often as they suceed).
* MacD - I don't like trading from lagging indicators. Every cross can uncross on the next candle.
* MAs (I can choose whatever timeframe/period I like to support my bias, I think bounces/rejections off MA lines are mostly coincidence or people just finding the correct time frame to  corellate)

Trading RSI divergences on the 4hr+ is by far my most succesful method, seconded by horizontal support/resistance. I would probably be more profitable if I ignored absolutely everything else.

What indicators or methods would you guys recommend I add to my arsenal (are there any I should re-visit from my list of ignored methods?). I dont trade the break up/down of wegdes and flags/pennants etc, because Mex doesnt usually let me. Also, Ive been burned by a lot of fakeouts, although I do use these break points to set stop losses.

I just wanted to share a thought with you guys that, at least to me, felt profound.

We're told things like, "90&#37; of traders fail. Why bother trying?", by people who shockingly enough, aren't part of that 10&#37;. These people might have tried trading the markets and failed themselves, or maybe they just heard that statistic somewhere and use it as a tool to push their pessimism on others. It is true. Most people lose money in the markets. At the final peak of a bull market, the public has amassed plenty of paper profits, but very few turn those paper profits into hard cash. Bear with me here as I lead you all to my realization. I watched the movie "300" yesterday and a scene crossed my mind this morning: The Arcadian leader says to Leonidas, "But you bring only this handful of soldiers against Xerxes? I see I was wrong to expect Sparta's commitment to at least match our own." Leonidas then points to three Arcadian soldiers and asks them each, "What is your profession?". Each responds with their craft (Potter, sculptor, blacksmith). Leonidas turns and asks his men, "Spartans, what is your profession!?" And they all chant a war cry. Leonidas: "See old friend, I brought more soldiers than you did."

90&#37; of traders fail because they're not traders. They attempt to trade part-time after coming home from work, or they take a reprieve from their career to try a become a market wizard. Or maybe they are none of the above. They don't want to trade. They just want to be a casual investor who buys in because their neighbor is making easy money, their friends are making easy money, and they want in on the bull market action too. So they buy in and count their paper profits with their "something for nothing" smile on, day after day. The real speculators, the 10&#37;, their profession is "trader". They follow the charts everyday and know what is happening in their market. They've learned all that books could teach them, and they know what signs of weakness and strength to look for in a trend. They know when to bail their position. This is the small minority that compounds their money in the markets. These people are the Spartans of the markets. The Arcadians are everyone else.

Don't let a statistic about failure, from a "market philanthropist", persuade you to not even try. If you want to make money in the markets as a trader, make the markets your university and "trader", your profession. It's a profession as any other. A lot of studying and hard work.
Another wick over 6800 followed by a .5% move down and everyone goes bearish like we are automatically back sub 6k. Bears showed up to push the price back under 6.8k, but I think this battle zone is far from over.

Closed 10% of my short, as we hit key support at $6600. However, alts have been bleeding for days now and we had multiple rejections of $6800, so this could still have room to move down, which is why I’m letting some ride for a bit.

On an unrelated note, look at EOS if you wanna see some blood ;)

Unless things get real nasty in the next 10 hours or so, there's going to be a golden (50,200) cross on the 4h.  It's not perfect, but it has been a pretty reliable bullish indicator since at least 2016.  
   
Here's the chart I've been playing with:  https://www.tradingview.com/chart/8x8U06YW/#   
Check "List of Trades" under "Strategy Tester"  to see the historical entries and exits on 4h golden cross.
Bounced nicely off the Kijun(blue) and trend line support. https://www.tradingview.com/x/s8VK7Snq/


Open Interest on bitmex just jumped up and bunch of shorts opened on finex https://www.tradingview.com/x/oV2InBRW/

If it holds, a lot of shorts are going to be quickly underwater and a retest of 6800 is probable.

EDIT: fixed second link.
3 consecutive bart down attempts in the last few hours: https://imgur.com/a/ivTQ4bQ Each with a higher volume. 3 failed to do anything to price.

Something tells me we will see the 6800 resistance breakout.
The "battle" these past couple of days has been about trying to close above the 12H Kijun (which sat at \~$6750 for a while): [https://www.tradingview.com/x/cHaxhaU0/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/cHaxhaU0/)

This is a significant target, obviously indicating trend reversal. But there hasn't yet been a convincing 12H close above Kijun, and it looks like the market wants a short term cool-off/consolidation. We can see this by the wide "c-clamp" gap between the 6H Kijun/Tenkan lines: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/voPoZ21V/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/voPoZ21V/)

Back to that first 12H chart, the cloud tells us to expect some decent support at the flat bottom of the cloud, just above $6500, which also coincides with a high volume node. This could paint some hidden bullish divergences on the 1-6H charts signalling bullish continuation. However, a close below $6400 would both invalidate those hidden divs and break the 12H cloud. Until the latter happens, I will likely remain short term bullish and avoid shorting anything.
[Last drop put 3rd stamp on this emergent bull flag.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ubIG8U4z/).  Buyers are picking up price really quickly with these drops.  Personally, I'd be reluctant to short here; we may get one more impulse to $6900 (or higher) before a retrace.
This round of bitcoin ETF comments on the SEC site is absolutely amazing: https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-cboebzx-2018-040/cboebzx2018040.htm
You’re all sitting here trying to figure out what controls the movement of bitcoin price but I’ve figured it out.  You’re wasting your time with all that TA and lines and triangles and funny names.  It’s my wife’s emotions that control bitcoin.  Every time she gets upset the price plummets because god enjoys double fucking me in every orifice.

She’s in a bad mood today boys, watch out. 
Buy orders filled.

**Long From:**

20% stack @ $6,678

20% stack @ $6,663 

I’m not missing the party. 

The price is in a really awkward spot right now. I dont recommend following this trade. It’s sitting right under the strongest resistance in the 6K range 

On a side note, on the 4H we are in a beautiful bullflag

https://www.tradingview.com/x/lSoOuFAp/

I’ll add down to $6600 if we slowly bleed there, and cut it pretty fast if we break through our support line.

also the main area of the previous consolidation. If that support fails in the 6550-6600 range, we are doomed (I am doomed)
Hi all. Long term holder here. I took profits during the bullrun. Have been heavily accumulating  between 5800-6400. 


My chart is showing the orange line crossed the blue line. We are now resting right on top of orange line. This has led to sustained growth practically every single time this has happened in the past. 

I truthfully don’t care what happens next here in the short time. I’m here again for long term... I clearly don’t know TA well enough to articulate much at al. Just pointing out what I see. I’ll only care if we dip in the low 5000s - have an alert setup for that just in case...

 Best of luck out there. See you in 4 more years.

Not much changed. Still dead volatility moving sideways.

My levels (most explanation on chart): https://www.tradingview.com/x/n0gYCjLa/

My current positions and what im doing with them:

40% leftover of my 5x Sept futures long from 5820 - relong on a confident close above ~6875, targeting around 75xx-76xx. Stops below ~6720. 

Assuming we dont go up, will close the remaining 40% if we cant hold 63xx-64xx (4H block with confluence). [Possibly relong the actual block with stops on the whole trade below but still not sure]

3x spot short from 6610 (underwater) - stop on a confident close above ~6875 (same as relonging condition) and targeting 63xx-64xx (4H block with confluence).

Other fun little side notes:

In Jan, I FOMO'ed in DGB right near the top with no stops (ah, the early days…). Had some other small trades on it since then but didn’t get to dump my initial bags until today. They were still in loss although substantially less than they were last week. Felt damn good.

Managed to nail an entry on ZIL. Logged into binance few days later to set my profit takes, turns out I fucked my stops and they triggered one satoshi below my entry and price ran away. Lost out on like 30% but quite proud I didn’t chase the fucker.

Still looking to long alts on two conditions: we set a daily higher low around 63xx-64xx on btc (this means alts should also make higher lows and stops could go below them) or we break and hold above 6875.

**TLDR: bullish if we break and hold 6875 OR make a higher low and hold 63xx-64xx. Bearish if we cant hold 63xx-64xx**
OK team, time for me to say something out loud. I have been hanging in this sub for almost 18 months, of which, most was a bull run. This sub literally made me $$ due to great advice and would have made me more had I followed advice closer.

I made a lot of mistakes, but going with the trend they were forgiving since I was executing only swing trades of weekly duration.

After taking some courses and just hanging out here for some time, I recently tried a couple of smaller timeframe trades and got wicked out, 4/4. Partially on purpose to limit risk, but also a couple % hit to the stack.

For those of you successfully trading this chop, nicely done! For me, gonna take a step back, re-evaluate my plan and then step back in after some trend has been more clearly established.

Thanks everyone for posting great advice and letting me know I have more to learn. 
I don't know what to do anymore! *flips table, rips eyes out*

You guys are shaking out the bear in me, but there's this wedge, momentum struggling, don't get me started about volume, we're right below Behemoth resistance... Is there a technical reason why should I throw that away and close my short, beside fomo and gut feeling? I'm a turbo noob and honestly asking if there's something I'm missing to see.
...I know we completely ignored multiple diagonal support lines these days, but still, price is coiling and the formation is valid?
Those 1Hr / 2HR bbands though... 

Past 3 times the 2Hr Bbands were this tight we broke up with a BGD 
Genuine question: If we do rise from here how far do you think we can make it?

I've heard the argument with regards to volume "you can slow bleed up just like you can slow bleed down" but do you guys just think there is billions of dollars waiting on the sideline currently?

Our climb to 20k was fueled by new money fomo, do you think the same people who bought at 9-20k are waiting to jump back in (genuine question)? 

Or is it the institution money currently waiting on the sidelines for things to kick off before buying in (also genuine)?

Like many, im just trying to make sense of the situation. I guess I'm just trying to understand where the (nontrader/gambler) money will be flowing in from if this is the start of a reversal.

Just got alerts for this. bounce here -> try $6800 again or I think we're testing ~$6400 and maybe lower again

I believe EOS is almost totally out of ETH to dump and only has about 8k left.  Might have an interesting effect on the market when that hits zero.  [From what I've read](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8x8slr/daily_discussion_megathread_july_9_2018/e22fovm/), they have dumped about 27k in the last 16 hours or so.

We've seen almost this exact same pattern ( big bart up, followed by small bart down ) 4 times already in July. Let's see if this pattern continues and we see another big jump up soon.
maybe a small bounce incoming, if not then i think we fall pretty far: https://imgur.com/a/uvdqI9h
It's so difficult to get behind this with where volume is at, I mean 24hr volume on coin base pro had been sub 4k for the past few days now.

I don't think it's organic but don't feel like it's manipulation either, more like a heavy hand forcing the market in the direction they want

Edit: I'm in disbelief lol

Edit2: last time we climbed on this low of volume was our attempt at 11.6k
Coming out of my hole, because my alarm went on with this >6.8k move. Seems not so convincing now :D staying out and wait for the dip

Man, it would be so bearish if BTC drops back to 6500, and ETH falls back into the wedge / channel after making an evening star

https://www.tradingview.com/x/H5Zvzi3M/
I made a commentary over the the weekly for BTC, and updated the channel that I was tracking on the 4 hour.

*Below taken from Trading Section in my report today*

BTC Macro:  On the weekly we're seeing the StochRSI begin an oscillation upwards, and it's still in the oversold area.  We're testing an old support turned resistance at the 6800 range and the close of the last weekly candle is showing us having solidly moved out of the last 9 week downtrend.  This doesn't necessarily mean a reversal or that an uptrend is coming, we've just come out of the downward trend initially moving upwards.  


BTC Local:  We're still in the channel on the 4 hour that I started commenting on around the 4th. 
I added a new line to notate that the channel may have turned wedge as we're starting to move more sideways within it. I'm watching for a break down before the 14th which I'll presume would look like move downwards to the 6400 range or if prodded lower a retest of the 6k again 
- or -  
another half bart green candle which if it shot upwards like the previous ones in this channel we'd be looking at it completely clearing the 6800-6900 with the top of the channel hanging out around 7100 for a short term ceiling to monitor.

Decent short here into daily resistance. 6850 stop. $150 risk for $1000+ downside. Although I can see it bulltrapping up for another 2-3 weeks before rolling over with a weekly doji or shooting star. After breaking a 5 month triangle, we need to paint large weekly volume to the downside before a bottom can be possible.

Looks like scalpers were ready and waiting for this latest pump
Model price based on tx rate: 7-day average: $4335, 28-day average: $4330.

 Model price = 10^-0.638 \* (tx per day)^2.181 / # total coins.

Explanation is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2hyl9c/daily_discussion_wednesday_october_01_2014/ckxhy9y) with [historical graphs of price vs. model](https://i.imgur.com/KOzbcx6.png) (last updated 2018-06-25) and [graphs of other correlations](http://imgur.com/a/7koaG) (last updated 2017-01-30). The code is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2oyrfq/code_for_tx_model/) if you want to improve on it.


**Accuracy of model and recent bearishness**

 Note, that this model has been doing relatively well if it is within *the same order of magnitude* of the price. That is to say, it is not a very accurate predictor of price, and to be within a factor of two of the market price (as recently) is effectively no strong signal. However, the prediction did dip just before the recent pop.

**Batching, UTXO count and so on.**

I have seen no convincing evidence that batching is currently a major effect to reduce the daily tx rate, and a cursory examination shows a similar dip in the UTXO network measure.
I am interested, long term, in alternatives to tx rate (given lightning etc) but I do not think UTXO count is a convincing alternative over, for example, unique addresses.
Parsing the blockchain directly for outputs per block is one possible alternative to deal with batching, payment channels notwithstanding.

Surprisingly the bulls are still fighting after that embarrassing rejection 
To me, the activity since June 29 looked like a classic bear flag on the daily, until I came here and was shocked to find everyone so bullish in the short term. But zooming out to the weekly, it looks like just the beginning of a bear flag to about 7800-8k...Currently, I'm short from 6700 with stops at 6911.

!long XBTUSD 6712 3X 10%

Gonna satisfy the retarded gambler that i am with some reasonings:

A failed dump this morning(Europe time)- This is the biggest signal for me, there was an attempt and it was pathetic.

We’re holding on this uncomfortable range of price and as a result Normies think we found the bottom and actually buying. Behind the manipulation ™ smoke screen i believe there was some real buyings from real regular people. Not a lot but some.

There is a small chance we actually did found a local bottom(no) and because I’m a permabull I’m gonna hold on this chance for now. If/when we find a bottom i know for sure I’m not gonna believe it so i take my disbelief with a grain of salt. 

Cheers 🍻 
BGD????

EDIT: Or just a mini BART...?
Closed my longs at 6700.  Bearish divergence on the 4h and it seems like we might have a leg down. 

Going to watch the market for now, but will probably rebuy at either 6300 or 6850, whichever comes first.

Good luck all!
A penny stock would be less shady then the price action of bitcoin.
Closes 6755 short with the tinest profit known to man. lol what gives? What the hell happened to the dumps!!?? 

Might have to go long here.  Being cautious cause now that I closed, the mother of all dumps will begin just to spite me going long. It really does feel like traders are being discouraged from trading hard. May just go back to doing what I do best and that's holding.

Every time I say where I'm longing or shorting on here, it feels like some whale is kicking back sniping us off one by one as we post. Really weird how the 2 shorts I've opened closed with such tiny profits. These dumps are getting weaker for sure. I've yet to try my luck going long yet. Such a tight range we been in it don't seem profitable up or down unless your 50X or 100x your position.
EOSBTC is dropping like a stone. Will this have an effect on BTCUSD?
Anyone considering the possibility we range from 7500 to 5500 for 6-18 months with a short capitulation event and maybe a bull trap in that phase?

I'm thinking this is about to be an ultra-boring rest of 2018.
This alt coin sell off is super bearish IMO. I think it's a prelude to a btc sell off. I hope BTC bounces off 6600 because I am not short yet. That said, if we dip and then come back to 6800 I think we would have a good shot of breaking through.
thats what you call a pump and dump lol ...
Ethereum super bearish. False breakout with shitty volume followed by daily evening star and back into the fucking wedge

https://www.tradingview.com/x/WRWgmaX6/
Just a quick update, since my comment reply may have gotten buried, and I’ve had some time to analyze the situation. Updates already sent to PositionBot via PM.

Trades: After adding to my short on consecutive failed attempts at $6800 (heavy horizontal resistance), I closed 1/3 of my short on this drop at $6615.5 hoping for a further decline. Shortly thereafter, I closed the rest of my Sept short at $6621 since it was kind of a hefty short and the dip seemed oddly slow and controlled. I then waited for a bit of a bounce and hedged a bit at $6650 (short xbtu18 6650 10x 5%) to protect my profits in case the bottom drops out.

Justification: We bounced off ascending support, and there’s still the possibility for a small short squeeze, especially with a small ascending triangle forming from the past two attempts at $6800. However, alts have been bleeding for days and could be telegraphing a big dump in our future. We’re also still below horizontal resistance at $6800 and the big ascending log support line we broke through is currently around $7200, where it meets with descending log resistance from ATH to the $10k peak. Below, we’ve got the previous log resistance from ATH-turned support we were riding before the pump at $5800, which is now about $2000 down, Because of this, I see more potential downside than upside at the moment. As a result, I’m still sticking to my current plan of hedging, adding on the bounces and closing on the dips. I figure it is more likely than not that the bottom will drop out eventually, it’s just a matter how long the price goes up first. I’m just hoping I’m not in a weak short when it happens. I’m fine if this one goes underwater for a bit, as it just means I can continue to add to it on the bounces. However, I haven’t had the best of luck building up hefty positions lately before the price reverses, which I guess is a bit of a blessing.


Also, I’m 16 for 16 since I started tracking my trades in May!


(Edit: Sorry, thanks to gypsytoy, I admit I was caught. My buy order filled between $6615.5 and $6616. I’ll be averaging out my orders balance on PositionBot from now on rather than showing only where I entered, as I admit it does seem odd that I could fill my whole order at one price when it’s usually rounded over a range. But yeah, I was super lucky on that wick. Just hoping it doesn’t dump straight down from here.)

Crypto in general but ICOs specifically are getting slaughtered on this HN thread that has been hovering around the top of HN all day now FYI: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17492750

(For the uninitiated... Hacker News is where pretty much all of Silicon Valley hangs out and shoots the shit.)
It begins
I don't believe CBOE would apply without knowing it will be approved. This may be the last chance to buy BTC sub 7K.

Bullflag broke up. 

Let’s see how much juice this baby has 

Edit: Downvotes? Lol 
That's a pretty bearish candle bros. 


I'm out of position (unleveraged short technically) but I am not willing to open a big short at this level despite leaning bearish because there is too much upside risk at this level and no good places to put a stop loss. I was hoping we'd see 7.1-2k where I could open up a big margin short with a responsible stop loss above the old log support turned resistance. In the case a very bearish scenario presents itself, I can short more once there is a bit more confirmation, but I am playing patient. Patience boyos. 


Patience. Patience! Hope none of you sold or shorted sub 6k. Even if you are bearish patience will very likely find you a good entry point. Markets don't move in one direction, especially not this one which is purely based on speculation and manipulation!
Pump failed, pulled out BGD reference
Alts are taking a beating. What the hell Bitcoin! Let's get it together here. Up or down. I'm so bored with this sideways crap.
12h Bbands tight, is this all the Bulls can come up with, buying up till 6.8k?
Massive negative delta divergence last couple hours. This is generally very bullish. If we move back up over 6730 I think a big break above 6800 is all but guaranteed.  If we dip back below 6670 it would be very very bearish though.

Order flow is a bit wierd right now. Would expect it to be more bullish . Only reason I gave the possible bearish scenario. 
Doesn't the price and sentiment just seem like it is almost *guaranteed* to go up over $7k soon?!
Who else thinks alts are going to get slaughtered regardless whether BTC pumps or dumps? Its known that alts lose their ratio when BTC dumps but i think if the speculation on the BTC ETF leads to a pump then alts are going to get rekt hard.
Feeling very much like 6700 is being artificially propped up. Everything I'm seeing in the short term chart action and volume tells my gut that this is going to break hard below $6700 soon. It bounced off of $6870 well but just feels like that was the first test dump and we will see another larger dump in the next hour or so. 

In this scenario I want to be right so I can buy in at a better price. However, if it breaks through $6750 in the next few hours then I'll go long at that point. 
The only thing holding the price in the daily is a minor spoofer under this very low volume. I'm selling, no leverage. 

$6700s is also a big long term resistance. See 1w and 1d charts.
anyone notice that margin debt on bitfinex dropped suddenly by over 100M with no movement in prices?

https://www.bfxdata.com/swaphistory/usd

july 8th 100m of margin debt just vanishes like nothing.

(i like how random facts get downvotes too)
Is this another failed dump in the making?
Comfortably short from 6755 from yesterday afternoon. This thing ain't cracking 8k and if it does it will be short lived. Volume just ain't there. Waiting another day or two for correction to 6450 area.  
Looking from an elliot wave standpoint, we can see Bitcoin -0.07&#37; has finished its 5th wave up, and is now due a retracement. BTCUSD -0.07&#37; is currently hovering around the BIG resistance level of 6700/6800 and i cannot see us breaking this signifying the finish of the 5th wave. Now a healthy retracement would be to $6300, losing this support and i foresee a retest of $5700, which i would not expect to hold again, with btc -0.07&#37; going to low 5k. 

Alternatively the bulls get through the $6800 resistance with volume , in which case i would wait for a retest of the resistance turn (maybe)support to think about opening a long position, but more likely to open a short the higher it gets, but as i say play with the market, so cannot say 100&#37; which position i will take up without seing the charts and sentiment, will update. 

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/3WATB6Cu/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/3WATB6Cu/)

TLDR: keep an eye on if the bulls can break BTC -0.07&#37; $6800 resistance with volume , if not a retracement to at least 6300 is coming very soon.
OKEX quarterly futures contract have gone from a $40-50 premium in the past days to trading on par at the moment... Not sure how I feel about that swing in sentiment there...
I've seen this story before. We'll be breaking 6800 shortly. probably tonight.
Overbought + bearish cross on daily stochastic (14, 3, 3). This has been a very reliable sell signal the past 6 months.
Seems like the patience of (if still beliving for somehow bottomed out reversal here) low limit orders is paying off, got filled at 6670 area now. 

Will be interesting to see how fast it goes back to 6720 range

"."ump in coming

. fill in the blank P/D?

Real recovery occurs when 100 & 200EMA cross again on the daily (for perspective, check the daily chart on Bitstamp and zoom out far enough so you can see 2012). I like this indicator because it cuts out so much noise.

Based on above, I think there's a lot more pain to come before we get a sustained bull run (certainly sub $5K, possibly sub $3K). I guess a max price ceiling of $7.8K (+/- $200) is also possible prior to BTC breaking down below $5.7K. 
Something going to happen this week. 

https://i.imgur.com/BPfkx2j.png

To me it looks like a big dump coming. Since 2010 the only times BTC pumped in July is in 2015, 2013 and 2012. 

Based on history odds are in a favor of this breaking down. 
Another 50-buck red candle. OK so Big Shorty's not down for the count (yet). Props for toughness. 
womp womp womp
Looking bullush as fuck
all in short; watch and learn
Some talk of no shorting under 6K but you may want to at least hedge a little especially if we go down bounce at 5K and don't clear 10K. It really could go all the way down to the 1.4K levels and if your financially dependent on btc then you may want to lock in some gains just in-case. I'm not going to go heavy on a long position(or any leverage) until the daily candle close above it's ichimiku cloud. I haven't had a problem shorting until I over-leveraged a little on my mex account the other day which was just gambling money and not my main account. The few times I've gone long using leverage I've gotten wrecked. I Cant trade this market intraday it's a nightmare and you get no sleep so I think the play is longer timeframe(minimum of daily candles following the weekly trend) bounce shorting with little to no leverage until we're clearly making higher highs.
[deleted]
Well I think it could go up, but it might stay sideways...and you can't leave out the possibility of it going down.

Last time 3d macd crossed we had a small rally to 10k, but before that we bounced hard off 11.7 and 3d went back to red.
I sometimes use coin. Heads is long, tails is short.

And yeah, I'm not kidding, market is so indecisive lately...
Honestly the simple things like MA tend to work best for me, Bollinger bands too. I use to use ichimoku clouds, but honestly they seem to be hit or miss especially lately where these BGDs just pierce right through these clouds no problem 
> General "feel" from watching orderbooks

So hit or miss on this for me.

I often feel it helps when I do it.  But then if I manage to ignore it for long periods of time, in hindsight those have been better streaks than streaks where I watch the books a lot.  

Personally I'm trying to get back to ignoring the book.
Price/time, trend lines, divs, sentiment


gut feel lol. seriously. lol.
Just wait for a decent sized red candle (hard to come by lately) and go long with low leverage, keeping half of trading stack dry so you can average down if it drops. Works like a charm if you're patient. Currently long from 6550 with 3x lev and looking forward to either a slow, steady ride up or a BGD. Target is 7500 but I'll take less.
RSI/Divergence along with watching orderbooks and going with my gut feeling is usually enough for me to trade off of.
Many try and fail. Those that succeed are those that didn't quit when they where down, but instead kept learning and trying new things.

 In every "how did you start" trading discussion I've seen the vast majority say they blew up an account or two before they became profitable. I think that the statistical 90% just throw in the towel before they are able to turn it around.
> We're told things like, "90% of traders fail. Why bother trying?", by people who shockingly enough, aren't part of that 10%.

The losers don't say 90%.  They will say 99.9999%, if not 100%.  Actually you hear that 100% of traders fail quite often in this sub.  People will say it is impossible to daytrade BTC profitably over the long-term.   Just because they aren't smart enough and don't work hard enough to do it, they say everyone is as incompetent as they are.  Anyway good post.
Most studies that show traders in general are unable to outperform the market are based on professional traders so your argument about the general public makes no sense. Replace traders with casino gamblers and it's going to read the same.

pun intended?
You felt the need to post this. I’d consider that pretty telling.

I’ll lmfao if these consistently rejected pushes through 6800 end up just baiting shorts before a dildo that holds.  I jumped back into a small long, with SL 3/4 down the pole, at the bottom of the flag this afternoon.  It looks ugly but, they do keep knocking.  
lol
The general sentiment is confusion 
go look at futures premiums to see sentiment. it's pretty clearly cautiously bullish. You can see this with most short sellers unsure of themselves here while bulls are very confident this is a disbelief rally (lol @ the irony of that)
He's been bearish for months now...hasn't he? I remember he was calling it a manipulated scam with some ridiculous h&s at like $10k 
Wish I could upvote more than once 
So you gonna try to buy at 6660 instead of now?  The FOMO in me would ladder entries to at least above 6700 just in case.
This is what I'm waiting for. I've been saying it all year. The bottom will be BORING. Sideways to oblivion. Once you are so fucking bored that you couldn't be bothered trading let alone check this sub, then the bottom is in.

We are not there yet. Earliest October for trend reversal but I think 2019 is more likely. No ATH until 2020. No I don't have any TA, just been around a long time...

I was watching that, what do you think about the volume profile? Seems a bit all over the place to me and I'm not sure if it's safe to disregard it or not.
Yes, looks kind of bull flaggy to me, gonna short the pump if we get one. May or may not try to scalp long.

Nice work. I am considering longing this one, but have concerns that the bull flag may not be valid after the July 4 one broke down, and also I'm tired of getting stopped out. 
Wow it looks just like Reddit.  I feel sorry for whoever has to read all of those.
I was looking forward to some entertainment, but jstolfi hasn't commented yet.

Edit: So far, 100% of the comments are positive while those on the [Winklevoss ETF](https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-batsbzx-2016-30/batsbzx201630.shtml) in 2016 were more of a mixed bag.
"In December because of SEC approval of Futures, Bitcoin went up from $3K to $20K. we again need SEC help to make money for small retail investors who lost lot of money in last 7 months."

Fuck me...
Are these just random comments from anyone though? Or actual SEC employees. Because some of the language is really unprofessional. And if it's just bitcoin enthusiasts commenting then of course you will get very bullish and biased comments...

I'm a bit more conservative, but have buy orders laddered from 6550 down to enter a trade for the first time in nearly two months.

That why you didn't use the position bot for this one?

Edit: lol nevermind!

> For those of you successfully trading this chop, nicely done!

I wouldn't feel too poorly...

Pretty sure that number amounts to a whopping 0-of-us-here.

Glad to see a new face in the forums!

Happy trading!
Chops are the hardest thing to trade. I’m a scalper myself, and if you really want to trade the chop. trade on the bias you have (aka, if you think it’s topping out, short any pumps. If you think think it’s bottoming out, long the dumps). Otherwise, I would just zoom out and ignore the chop, and make sure not to set tight stop losses (sorry, but you’re never gonna manage to stay in a trade if you keep tight stop lesses with all the stop-loss hunting going on.)

Just trying to help during this period. It always helps to step back and re-evaluate though. I lost out on a potential $13,000 by overleveraging a few months ago, and realized a bit of introspection can be healthy to rethink your trading strategies and not get too emotional in your trading.
First piece of advice can be given regarding your first line. The joke about flipping tables and ripping your eyes out gives me a sense that you are too emotionally invested. 
Everytime it dips into 66xx, it gets bought back up to 67xx pretty quick...
We just barted down so yeah we will probably see a BGD come out of no where and put us back where we were a day ago

Edit: any minute now, whales must be on there coffee break or something
Institutional money is not going to jump in and drive the price up so all of the bag holders from 20k can unload onto them. 

If institutional money was the driving force behind a bull run, they will just be racing each-other to be the first to exit. 

Institutional money is smarter than this. 
$7300-$8500

$7300 is previous triangle support turned resistance.

$8400 is 0.618 fib retrace.

$8500 is previous triangle top resistance.
There's 2.6 billion in tether that's always looking for a new home.
Well, Yonhap, the Korean news agency, reports that Korean banks have added $2 billion in Bitcoin to its asset mix. Do you suppose other banks might be thinking along the same lines? Do you suppose Korean banks will stop at just $2 billion?

https://ledgeble.com/banks-in-south-korea-have-2-billion-in-cryptocurrency-is-an-emerging-asset-class/

And speaking of banks, many people hate them. More and more of those people are putting their money into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies all the time. 

There are many other levers of demand that haven't had the slightest pressure applied (yet). Yes, we're going up in a big way. Maybe not (or maybe) tomorrow or next week, but in time for sure.

Don't let "The Ballad of Bitcoin Shorty" be about you.
> do you think the same people who bought at 9-20k are waiting to jump back in

Nope. Not a for a goodly while.

This is the land of wolves for now. The sheep will be scoffed. 
The institutional dollars will come in a way that is unexpected. If fund managers start putting in just 1&#37; of funds into actual crypto it would shoot a trillion into the space. 

But, those are unlikely to come until there is some further regulatory clarity. Some funds may disregard that and proceed anyway. The public won't buy in until it doesn't look like a downtrend any more. 

My money is on tokenized securities being the catalyst for that. 
I personally know of 2 people who largely missed on the FOMO last time (scoffed at me at in August and then listened when I told them not to buy in December) who at least bi-weekly ask if its time to get back in. One of them had a net positive by catching the original DCB early this spring.

In other words, if you did not get badly burned the last time or had some mediocre success, it may happen sooner than we think. 

And yes, this is anecdotal, but amateur, white collar investors with no trading background is I think who we are talking about.
Based on the accumulation period which I believe we are in and relative slope smoothing we have been experiencing on the daily, I think a retest of 10k could definitely be in the cards in the next month-6 weeks if we do break 6.8k with conviction relatively soon (which I believe we will). 


I personally am loving the slower movement. It gives time for decisions and proper analysis. Remember, most successful trading firms (outside of quants) trade on 1-3 month timeframes. 
no, but they'll jump in at $21K because at that point they'll know the pump is back on. 

I think there is an incredible amount of money and fiat on the sidelines, once they see the price just keep going up or think the price isn't going down any lower there will be rapid FOMO.
Thanks for the reminder. I think I may have re-entered my short too early. Closed out at 6622.5 and may re-think this for a bit since I’m likely overtrading because things look so bearish. Are you holding onto your shorts through this?
Nice. I don't think we get to 6800 again, ive moved my offers down.

This belongs in altcoin daily thread!
Excellent overview of the market.

> I don't think it's organic but don't feel like it's manipulation either, more like a heavy hand forcing the market in the direction they want

A heavy hand forcing the market in the direction they want is pretty much the textbook definition of "manipulation".
the volume on coinbase/bitstamp is more genuine, exchanges like bitfinex and other non-real money exchanges usually have rampant wash trading.
Time to add massive short at 6800 with SL 6880
That’s manipulation

Right there with you, mostly. Outside of the SEC announcing allowance of [crypto ETFs](https://cryptoslate.com/sec-opens-up-the-etf-market-opportunity-knocks-for-cryptocurrency/) I don't see us getting past that 7000 barrier before another leg down.
I remember distinctly the price being stuck at 6666.66 on the way up (last bull market) too. Very strange.
Devilish
hard to believe you're literally 0.9% of the open interest on mex.

lol like it's really funny to think that 1/100th of the bitmex market is a self admitted degen gambler. how fitting
holy fuck. If bitcoin goes up to 8k, you're a millionaire.

Wish you luck man
only 15x, thought u were a degen. Also someone can probably calculate you liquidation prices i think? Also, why do you take such large positions on futures, perps would give you a lot better liquidity?

Inb4 the spanish inquisition comes in about faked images.
holy shit. No sane person would open a huge long position with this dreadful volume after we pumped more than 10%.
Hi griffin26
I hope it does.
Good report as always. Thank you!
Thanks for zooming out and painting the bigger picture. I honestly don’t see much of this in this sub.
I personally think log charts are the only way to go. $100 increase at $1000 and $100 increase at $20000 are certainly different. It would be weird to draw trendlines / patterns
Logarithmic scale are best used to represent exponential movement. 

Cryptos have exponential movements. Stocks and other commodities do not (normally).

The vast majority of movement in the past month or two happened in 15 minute timeframes, I don't know if there's a method to this madness or if whales are just screwing with everyone.

But we've nearly completed the Adam Eve Jesus Mary and Joseph pattern which started late Jan! 
'Star destroyer' pattern confirmed...
Yeah, fuck everything. Bullish.
Nah this sub collectively decided that accumulation above $5,500 is impossible. Instead, what is likely happening is that BTC is being distributed by people who bought around $1,000, held through the bubble and didn't sell there. Now, after holding through 19x gains, they've collectively decided that the bottom of a half year long downtrend would be a good time to distribute. /s
I am seeing a lot of this wyckoff catapult talk going on, there might be some self fulfilling prophecy involved. 
IF one pattern doesn't fit the story, invent another! 
bull flag on the monthly 

but seriously I keep seeing this and apparently (according to p brandt) a descending wedge is not a strong long term reversal pattern. I believe it's more of a relief rally/short/medium term reversal pattern
Gotta have the orders already in place. Cant really catch those especially when Bitmex server goes nuts during big moves.
i shorted with stops above .073 got stopped out -_- reshorted at .0727 glad I did. dunno why i put stops at .073 instead of .074 lol

We have seen these games many times the past several weeks.  Nothing new...just manipulated bullshit.
just dont put stops where they can easily be run.
Yep my stop and some slippage fucked my over right then. On the plus side did manage to get a better entry on my short
Good call! I agreed with your chart and shorted more at 6815!
Good call, but there's still time for continuation on this latest move. Not looking good so far though. 6800-7000 has been a massively strong resistance/support zone. I think it's gonna take some extremely bullish news to break through that range.
What about volume?

I'm having trouble believing in any TA in an environment of low volume and thin orderbooks.
Caught that wick at 6829 for my short entry, yum yum
Yeah, it is really obvious.
Less than 3k if you are looking at coinbasePro and watch the monster volume bring it up to 4k
I don't think I'd say this is out of nowhere. Alt ratios have been dropping for months.

https://www.moonmath.win/alt.html

Maybe people know BTC is about to dildo to 7k+ and leave alts in the dust so they are preparing for the alt RektAge 
I do not usually get involved in lending and I do not monitor it like I should, can you spell out the historical significance / implication for me?
Why does that not feel good? Means longs wont get squeezed by funding rate. Often high funding rates coincide with peak sentiment and reversals.
Truth be told, spot market moves bitcoin.  
And then what?
today? I've been waiting half  a week for price to form that right shoulder
Well, if it jumps up, it will jump up high and keep going. If it jumps down, it won't be far or for long.
Bulli-

Ahem... *boobish*
Actually this chart is a very good representation of the current market condition. I would add a dildo though, not sure about the color.
since i would benefit greatly off of this i can only upvote this stellar TA.
I'm no expert by any means on topless tit TA, but it seems that the center of the "left tit" is placed way higher than the "right tit". Ergo, shouldn't the "right-tit" be smaller, equalling a more shallow retracement? 

Due to my noobynotoriety, I have no idea how to make my own titty analysis, but I based on rough "eyeballed" quantification, I'd say the retrace shouldn't be much lower then 4-3.5k. (2.618)




Really useful TA, I'm reassured you are keeping abreast of rising and falling movements 😏
have an upvote from boob lover
I honestly think this is more a fractal of March-December 2013 than December 2013-March 2017
How was the trip? Any wild/divine realizations you'd like to share?
/r/therewasanattempt/
I feel too that if normies take a look at the chart, they also might think this is a bottom.  They aren't here yet though.  It's a bit desperate rationalization for the long, but I'd rather not wait for this to keep stair-casing up and then jump in after half the movement is over.  

Holding onto my long for now too (from 5800ish, been scalping with it and current ca at about 6400).  Really on the fence about closing that one today though.

And opened another gamblers long here at 6700.  (I had a different gamblers long last week that ended with a ca of just under 6500 but it got stopped out last thursday at break even, after having taken half its profits at 6750 before that)  I'll let this one go quickly if the floor falls out from this level.
Could you chart the bear div? I'm not seeing one that hasn't already played out.
Well, for your sake I hope you closed and went to BTC instead of USD.
Then what?
> shady

What's shady about it? It's an outrageously rigged rape machine and quite open about it. 
If EOS has an affect on BTC we are all fucked because that thing is a scammy shitcoin. 1 year long ICO with 0 product. What a joke. Those people cashed out. 
we can also range from 6k to 18k for the next 5500 - 7500 minutes
Boring, especially a year of it, has been consistently the best buying opportunity
Very low probability the price will stay in that range for the next 18 months.  Less than 5% probability.
Isn't it the SEC news? Causing Alt ratios to fall because of likely good in traders eye for ETF? Also historically Alts do worse in bear markets 
Funny thing is, most shitcoiners blame Bitcoin for their shitcoins going down but Bitcoin is the only one showing some bullish signals
Puh-dump. 
> False breakout 

I don't trade ETH at all but looking at that image it could simply be retesting that line it broke through... Isn't bearish until you push back below meaningfully. 
Shouldn't this be in altcoin discussion? Anyways I agree. Part of it is people selling the news due to Bancor getting hacked around $12 million worth of Ether. 


https://www.ccn.com/decentralized-crypto-exchange-bancor-hacked-12m-in-ether-stolen/
...are you still expecting that big orange arrow, my fellow shorter? Seems kind of unlikely after a false breakout + morning star + dump to the bottom of the wedge.
You've betrayed me. You were supposed to hodl that short.

You scalper
So you closed your short at the *exact* bottom of Sept futures? On the very tip of that single 1m wick? Amazing...
Lower volume, hence higher volatility
Books are super thin so there is no buffer.  Any big market buy or sell can move it easily.  
If by "people" you mean the degen lower timeframe margin traders who peruse the dailys, yes.
It's far worse than that. People are trading and making investment decisions based on what 0.0001&#37; of global BTC noobs are upvoting in this very sub. 
Looks like longs closing out. I do suspect shorts to get squeezed soon. Planning to scalp long while scaling into a short at the top.

This comment didn't age well
You know to be fair the ETF CBOE is requesting would be cool, but it's very restrictive and isn't going to be for joe shmoe with his IRA. Each share would be 25 bitcoins, effectively relegating it to the rich or accrediated investors. That's nice, but I don't think it would have the same affect of a more down to earth ETF approval. 
Or could be the last chance to sell BTC above $6.6K.
When buying is contrarian.... i would call it a good time to buy
If this is the same pumper then the real pump should be 1 hour after.  Shit is identical to the pump from 6525, we are only at the second hourly wick.
Too many shorters on that 6.8 resistance :-\
> Markets don't move in one direction, especially not this one.
Bullish?
That was just a little test. Waiting for them to dump cheap now. Had there been no resistance, assumption would have been that they're tapped out of rare and precious Bitcoin. Woo hoo! Let the age of cheap Bitcoin roll on for a while! Give the workin' folk a chance to stock up.
Yeah this is very odd. Usually alts follow behind once btc stabilizes a bit. But alts are going down. This is my lowest value ever right now. 
a 60$ Range is between your very bullish and very bearish ?
Yea it really does which is precisely why I'm hesitant to bet on it, lol. 
Sell signal
How I think the game is played is big players control BTC in a way to help them accumulate alts they think are good long term bets.

Someone is always buying alts the whole way down for many of them. Now perhaps they sold high and are buying back in now on the whole way down and getting ready to pump the alts again. 

But BTC being #1 and main alt pairing it is easy to control BTC to help buy and sell alts. 

End goal is whales control large supply of the alts. They hold the supply of alts and pump them super high in price. Everyone else joins in and since there is little supply due to whales holding the price goes up super high. 

Once the whales feel they have control enough supply of the alts then they let BTC pump to new highs like $50,000 for 1 BTC and that sends alts super high in price and the whales get hella rich for holding tons of BTC and alts. 

Price is still 6x higher than where it was not that long ago. Plus alts mooned hard. Whales enjoying their new wealth and manipulating the price to get even richer in a few years. 

BTC ETF helps push BTC price super high plus in 2024 most of the BTC will be mined like 1,300,000 BTC left in 2024. By then I expect crypto market cap to be in the multi trillions of dollars and many alts to be very high and tons of rich people. You don't get rich by dumping. You get rich by buying the dip and waiting for the idiots to stop dumping. 
How do you slaughter something when vultures are picking at the bones?
If BTC gets pumped on somone's delusional ETF fantasies, then alts will move up sharply as well.  

Oh they are getting blasted right now. To be quite honest, I do have some alts I 100&#37; follow and believe in that I am just holding (I re-entered most of them last month). Rather than over-trading in-n-out to protect sat value I've finally said fuck it and am holding my positions and trading on just Bitmex. Not sure how this'll work-out but I definitely feel less stressed now that I only have to focus on BTC and development updates. 
Feeling very much like **sub 7k** price is being artificially **suppressed**. Everything I'm seeing in the short term chart action and volume tells my gut that this is going to **pop hard above**  **$7000** soon^TM . It was **rejected off of $6870** well but just feels like that was the first test **pump** and we will see another larger **p**ump in the next hour or so^**TM**.

 In this scenario I want to be right so I can **sell** at a better price. However, if it breaks through $6750 in the next few hours^**TM** then I'll go **short** at that point.


Yeah, the moves I saw in play were: rise above this resistance in which case things could get out of hand to the upside vs dump either to higher low (which would then probably get bought up) or new lower low which wouldn't make a whole lot of sense to me from a fundamental standpoint. 
What are you considering a dump at these low volumes?
artificial

organic

inorganic

fake

manipulation

plz stop

the price is what it it. nothing artificial about it
Me too. I have a feeling that there would be a dump. 
Spoofing is losing its effectiveness now that everyone is aware the orders are fake, they trying other strategies such as wash trading more often now
But can't you see how excited the sub is that the bear market is over!? I mean look at all the people pouring in now that we moved passed the 21 day EMA! It's so crowed in here currently!

Surely the trading volume has instilled at least some confidence no?
The only!! thing downvoting you is a rogue colony of bots.
if you post this over at rbuttcoin, it would be quick-blindly interpreted as a $100M bitfinex hack.

PS: is it true that rbuttcoin mod/founder started the sub when btc was @ $4 apiece?
What does this mean?
Does that mean trader closed their longs?
Patient, it's coming.
Fewer than 800 coins market sold in the last hour on BFX, wouldn't call that much of a dump, very low volume.
Well meaninful volume in the form of buy pressure has disappeared again. It can easily go either way. 
The idea of "failed dumps" is silly. Maybe if there was a massive wick with a bunch of bottom shorters trapped you could call something a failed dump, but consolidation after a move up is not a dump--failed or otherwise.
No need for volume when you have massive fraud.
Was counting the second leg up as (3), and your current (3) as (5), a legitimate count a few days ago, i.e. did you revise the count after what is now labeled as (5) happened?
Bullish?
I will consider myself lucky if it stays higher than 6k end of this week.
bye buye buy buy!
D, looks at ETH. we're going down.
> possibly sub $3K

OK... so... just to get this straight here...

(20,000 - 3,000) / 20,000 = 0.85

So you're saying that the hottest investment of 2017 will see a retracement of 85% before our next bull run?

That's... a stretch imho... plausible perhaps... but not without another absolute disaster akin to Mt GOX imho.

I won't fault you for dreaming, though!

I have my crazy crypto fantasies too... I just try to keep them to myself :P
Nice to see the downvoting by rabid bulls hasn't changed since I last posted here /s Fucking grow up (if you had heeded my earlier posts, perhaps you'd be in profit rather than underwater)
Month/Day/Hour trends are not a reliable predictor of future prices. Just track the price action and indicators and you’ll be fine.
BTC dumping last year in July is because of the uncertainty of the first BTC fork lol so thats not really a good metric.
It can just trade sideways +/- $500 until it breaks through the ATH resistance.
What website do you use for that chart?
Were you being ironic of for reals?
Yes, allinshort bitcoin after 7 months into a bear market. what could go wrong ? hope your stoploss is just a few single %.
Next 15m is critical!
I wish I lasted as long as Harry. I’m known as 15 second Joe.
Thanks for this wonderful insight 
[removed]
Yep... I remember when $11.7k flipped to the downside... certainly could happen here as well. If we're above $6.9k in a week, then 3d will read as a stronger indicator
As long as you set a fair exit for either position to not lose much, it sometimes doesn't make a difference. All about the RR, and if the reward is unclear, focus on mitigating risk.

I've never flipped a coin though.  But I did one use the shape of a small hill on the lord of the rings parody TA, and it actually worked out.
I would imagine it is analogous to health club membership upticks around new years resolution time and the % success rate of "six pack achieved." Commitment, hard work and continuous learning just like anything else. 
I 100% agree.
Not going to lie, I lost a good amount of the gains I made in Nov-Dec due to me getting complacent(I started real small last Feb). Never again will I make that mistake. If I see that the market is about to crash, then I'll pull out into usdt or cash and be patient. That is something that has taken a long time to get down as far as trading goes. In real life, I'm all about "getting it there and now" so I can move onto the next thing. With trading, I'll sit on a trade for a week or two (Underwater on a short atm but am holding).
Smart doesn't really have anything to do with it.  Hard work and persistence trumps smart every day of the week.
Exhibit A
hm. I should probably remove that. (I'm long)
Feel free to elaborate.
Yes

Also @CatPizzaTrades on twitter
I dont see any "confusion stage" on the bubble charts, Im confused
Do you think this could be the start of the disbelief rally?
Nope, he was bullish near the top and bearish near the bottom consistently. For example when we were approaching 10k he called for 12k and "went long". Great indicator. I legit believe that account is set up so that people lose as much money as possible but then again I am a conspiracy nut. 
something like 5 layered bids from 6635 to 6680 yes 

I am in no rush and a proper retest of the push on saturday is needed to test the strength
Given how bearish BTC has been lately, theres no need to FOMO. Be patient and try and get your perfect entry.

Something something lagging indicator...
You mean the one around Dec 31 2017 right before it spiked back up to 17k?  Yeah, it would have been aggravating to sell/short on it only to watch the spike, but then it went down to bear town without ever actually crossing again.
Volume sucks... but price can bleed down on low vol as well as bleed up.  I look for high volume confirmation when gauging capitulation events, or looking for a sustained trend (last year's bull market)
This is what I’m doing. 

I’ll close my long for a scalp if we don’t break $6900, but if we break 7k I’ll hold onto it and look to short around 7200

Which if we get there i expect a bounce 
!long XBTUSD 6678 5x 100% 

I honestly forgot lol 

Edit: And i fucked it up. 
Let’s try this one more time ( sorry for bot spam)

!long XBTUSD 6678 5x 20% 
No, thanks man. It is really stop hunt city right now, wicks flying all over the place.

I am not a full time trader (have an FTE, family & such), so I need to zoom out and ignore the chop like you said, just trade the daily/weekly trends. Realistically, missing out on the bottom/top 20% of a move for confirmation is the right call. 
What line exactly? What about it?
Thanks for the concern, I've just been looking at the charts very hard today, I feel like I'm missing something but don't know what lol. I've already made peace with my position any way it goes.
Glad to see you’re back :) 

Yea buyers are pretty fierce right now, Longs down like 3% and price is pretty stable. 

I think we will move sideways for a little more before a $200+ dildo up
>We just barted down

huh?
I'll put you down for institutional money then
Yeah I'm just trying to understand what the potential upside is and where the billions of dollars we need to push this higher will come from (at least currently)
Yes, there is probably a sizable cohort who bought at some point late last year and who sold early this year waiting for a clear signal to get back in. I suspect that amount is larger than those who were toasted so bad that they will swear off of crypto. 
Still need money to fill the gab to 21k, where is that going to come from?
Yea I'm sorry I didn't answer this earlier but yes lol 
ETH price and EOS dumping affects BTC and all of crypto too.  
Usdt is mostly usd used on chain. Very easy to swap out with another solution like TrueUSD if needed. 
I added to my underwater september short on that pump as well, and brought it back into the green on the rejection. Now I’ve got to figure out what to do with it from here. Good luck to us both!
Work the 9-5 so no summer for me lol! 
Yeah but on some level all prices are manipulated, they way I'm looking at it is the market is uneasy and needs some convincing so someone is giving it a little nudge. 

It's more of a grey area right now if anything 
It's not manipulation, it's "alternative demand".
This is why im having a tough time believing this "rally". Low volume on coinbase like 1 month ago was 8-10k now we barely get past a 5k 24 hr volume. The last BGD we saw it went from 2.9k to 4k, not super convincing, but honestly I'm just clueless at this point.
Meh I see it currently as a big grey area, the market seems to have picked a direction (with weak conviction currently) and it's getting a little push from some bigger players.
Just a number I can never unassociate from the idea of other worldly evil. 
The devil was originally an angel...

So perhaps we will rise to the heavens before being dragged into the depths of hell?

Anyone?
Wow, that's really cool.  And people think what is said here doesn't matter...
TIL why Bitmex futures trade at a premium.
Holy shit that's nuts. I assumed the market was bigger.
hey man where can I check open interest of Bitmex? Open interest is just the number of unclosed contracts in $ right?
How did you assume it's 15x, since I blocked out the margin, liquidation prices, and %ROI? It could be 2x or 30x for all you know?

And I don't trade perps because of funding.
i can post it in bitmex chat with the position bot if ya'll dont believe me lol
sane people be cleaning my lambo while im poppin bottles
Thanks for the feedback, I really appreciate it. 
I always find it pretty hilarious when you create triangles with lines on the short time-frames and then change to the 3D and it's this tiny fucking blip. 
Which makes me ask why would anyone want to invest in asset classes that don't have exponential movement lol?  If you need different charts for the new asset class that should tell you something.
great, this is what i was looking for. thanks

+1. Drakdoo is great.
Whales support many different types of life. Several creatures, such as barnacles and sea lice, attach themselves to the skin of whales and live there.
My take on it is that whales buy/sell in a single move, then constrict the trading range via buying/selling with both market buys and limit orders. The constriction allows them to gauge whether people are buying/selling more on average. Thus they can then move the market to the supply/demand price (because they're the only ones who know it and have the money to move the market) and profit from the difference. 

It is within their best money-making interests to try and keep the price at the supply/demand price because fighting the market only costs you money. 
whales have their plans just like you have your plan... the plans simply differ.  
Elliot, Gann.  Many of the big TA names never made money trading.  Quite telling. Personally I think elliot did discover a fundemental way that markets move. But it has very poor predictive power. Only useful in hindsight.  So kinda useless.  When it works it works great. But the concept of extended waves means you never know if your count is accurate till its too late. Still I think traders should be familiar with it even if they don't use it in their trading.  Impulse amd corrective waves should be something  everyone trading understands.  
Who gon eat the apple?
Well when you put it that way it sounds pretty silly. 
nailed it

I heard they want to sell at 3k also
What if i told you there wasn't enough liquidity (or network capacity- lul) for everyone to exit at peak prices. Most of the selling volume happened around 8.2k.
Yup they will feel  dumb selling once all the retail money that's been sitting on the side lines for the past 6 months market buy us up to new highs. I think people were waiting on the tech to deliver first before buying, but now that the majority of crypto has worked out their tech issues (major progress in the past 6 months), I can't walk down the street anymore without seeing how widely used crypto is now./s
What’s crazy is that ETH is holding up comparatively well compared to many other alts. Wish I had shorted EOS myself before that 12% drop. But man, alts are looking super bearish and BTC’s price has barely dipped. Seems super sketchy atm.
Ohhh yeah, especially with volume picking up, sold at 475 and have been in fiat ever since. 

Edit: should find at least some support in the 450s, we'll see how it holds
I've had to step back from enforcement on this. The loose relevance of alt markets has become very popular.
Thus the big wicks. It's easy for large holders to manipulate things right now. I'm currently 70% cash right now waiting for a decisive move. Each time 6800 gets rejected the chances of a flush grow. 
My thinking as well. My instinct tells me shorting is the way to go, but not confident enough for any significant positions. 
Obviously
Bullish. 
> Bullish?

yes if *true*
Always
With this volume? 7k+ and then what? why would it pump there when there are a lot of people waiting to take profit? I suspect there are still a lot of longs open from 7k. I don't know, but at the current stage that is very unlikely.
Traders who open leveraged long position on any USDT trading pairs on Bitfinex need to borrow money from lenders.

When we are in a bull run, traders will tend to open long positions and the lending rate will increase because the demand is high.

This morning the rate was about 0.024 when I opened a position. Now it sits at 0.014 which means supply of USDT outweight the demand.

EDIT: 15 minutes later we are at 0.012

The previous projections for the shoulder have just become a deformed head now, and people are still reworking it.  Fuck these formations.
If you say so...
based on what?
It's not that disagree, but you're one of those people who will see 100k BTC, do nothing about it, panic sell when it comes back close to 0 and cry for the rest of your life.
Honestly I would’ve close that juicy 5800 long if i were you. I agree that my rationalizations are desperate and my current position is pure gamble, that’s why I’m doing it with a small stack and fully ready for consequences as i had a nice strike lately. 

With that being said, I don’t see a good reason to open a short position right now so long it is.
Jesse Livermore would tell you not to sell a winning position. Wait until you’ve been proven wrong before admitting it.

0 product? this is the kind of tunnelvision maximalism that is detrimental for the crypto space. They have some governance issues, but to say there is no product... It's giving this sub a bad image. People supposed to be knowledgeable here.. 
I don't see how EOS is more scammy than any other altcoin.
Come on man, we're better than /r/CryptoCurrency.

https://eostracker.io/  
This is EOS, what do you mean no product? It's launched and it works, yesterday I send some EOS to Kraken to sell - no tx fees and it was on my balance within 5 minutes. There are more than 2.5MM transactions and 4MM dapp interactions. VC funds like Mike Novogratz' are dropping tens of millions in investments on EOS dapp developments, do you really think they're getting scammed like some grandma?

I agree that the ICO was stupid, and you should be very cautious with the governance issues, but the ICO profits are being reinvested, and the governance issues worked on. To say it's a scam is just anxious ETH fanboy trash talk. It really is the same as in 2016 when ETH started gaining traction, this sub was constantly bashing it without any arguments, just saying "it's a scam" over and over again. Look how that turned out.
Well, if EOSBTC drops, many people are selling for BTC. Then they have BTC they might want to get rid of quickly.

No coin is an island.
My thoughts exactly
How did you calculate <5%?
I don't think SEC news is relevant at all. We've seen this same story before. There would be a reaction in BTC itself if the news was important.

Yes, alts do worse in contracting markets because they have less liquidity so when people exit the price drops more. They exit into BTC and then exit BTC to fiat. Alts can drag BTC down with it.
Based on my working theory that is because the alts are selling into btc (by buying BTC with alts they prop up btc price). Once alts finish selling, btc will sell off.
That's a good point. I'm jumping to conclusions here, although ETH and BTC don't look strong at the moment.
Lets be honest. Nobody looks at that thread. Also, there must be some correlation between the two
No, that would be too simplistic a prediction on my part :) I drew it days ago for fun, although it's still a possibility.

>Seems kind of unlikely

Did you mean likely? 
Hahah sorry, I’ve resorted to scalping these days to prevent myself from going too far underwater. I’m sure your short will be much more profitable than mine in the long-term. I’m just scared of trading with a large portion of my wallet based on bad past experiences.
I was close, but yeah I was lucky enough to close 1/3 of it there. I saw the rejection at $6800 and sat and watched when the price started dropping with my finger on the trigger and closed once I saw the order book flip. I was just shocked there was no overload, I guess bc the drop was so slow, esp on futures. I then sent the update to positionbot as soon as it closed. I’m not sure why you’re antagonizing me for actually nabbing the bottom of a wick for once. Do you not trade futures? It typically doesn’t flip as quickly as perps, which is prob why I got so lucky.
Hey, people luck out sometimes
The horror.
Haha... I laughed... and I believe you're mostly right there.

A lot of the top comments just hinge on being bitter instead of informative.

This community centers around getting billion dollar investments from VCs on the regular... I think they're just a tad jealous tbh.
>Hacker News jobs are threatened by crypto

I don't really see how that's accurate... and I never said they were a good metric... just trying to give insight into what some other relatively powerful and wealthy groups are saying about Crypto right now.

HN consists mainly of freelancers and people either starting their own companies or working for startups.

Every single one of them could benefit from the crypto space if they chose to.

I don't see how it threatens them at all.

This same forum however was yelling "SCAM, SCAM!" back in 2011-2014... so they probably all feel pretty dumb about not buying in just a little bit... considering how technically savvy they all are...
\>nothing

Ah.. but nothing is called accumulation if you are a bull.
That sounds very pointless 
> the ETF CBOE is requesting would be cool, but it's very restrictive and isn't going to be for joe shmoe with his IRA.

Thankfully Joe Shmoe Bitcoiner doesn't understand that... or at least he won't immediately... so prices should rise at least short term.

Excellent...

-Mr Burns
True, but the media spin gonna do work. BTC EFT LIVE!!!!
That pump was honestly embarrassing 
Sure, it might move in one direction during a phase of the bullrun. But common, just look at the chart dummy. I'm clearly referring to the current market conditions (correction phase)
lol not anymore 
Yep agreed, retracement is necessary now
I remember a few periods last year, where it seemed like everybody was ditching their alts for bitcoin (oh yeah, it was before the BCC fork.) Are all these alts being traded for Tether right now or something? shouldn't that buying go into BTC and then fiat?
Yup. On the short term (next few days). Intermediate term I'm bearish.
The price action here looks very different than on drops from 10k, that's why I think this might be beginning of something.

Problem with reversals after slow bleed is that it will move up slowly with disbelief from buyers.
Hey I don't blame you!

Bitcoin has made me so paranoid of seemingly natural TA over these past few months...

I'll probably never be able to trade anything other than crypto again!
Alts are way up from the BTC slaughter when it was making ATH after ATH on its run up to december.
You slaughter the vultures along with the bones.
Lol similar to how they moved up when BTC was pumping from November to December? They were absolutely demolished. You would have lost a lot of USD holding alts then while BTC was pumping. They only pumped after the news on the BTC futures was sold at $18k to $20k
Says the guy who shorts after a double bottom is confirmed.

Can we get past these endless unsupported statements someday?
I'm not watching the volume as much on this move but if we break under $6600, then the chart will naturally want to re-test some of the supports below that range ($6500, $6300, etc.) and I'd want to see some major supports being upheld to feel confident that this isn't going back below 6k. I'm very interested in this $6700 price point that is being defended on both sides. I'm not sure that there is a clear winner but the chart/price action feels bearish and I'd say we need to re-test $6500 before we hit $6800 again. 

It's hard to say since on the 1 hr chart, sub 6700 has been consistently bought up and is making this range look like the pivot point for our next leg up. I don't want to miss out on the profit potential of a quick rise but I'm also entirely unwilling to expose myself to a potential drop in price at these levels. If it breaks $6800, I hop in, if it breaks below $6700 convincingly, I'll sit out and wait for $6500 before I buy in. 
What are you considering a pump at these low volumes?
Come back on teamspeak and share your wisdom :D
It feels artificial in that the price action is too controlled for my taste. It's being held between 6690 and 7710 without any clear directional bias. It's either being held up or held down and I can't decipher which way it wants to break. My instincts tell me it wants to break down and have a short term crash. I'm not saying it is "manipulation" just that the current movement and intraday trading ranges feel a little insincere. 
artificial is definitely the wrong word.
what is this based on?
Confirmation comes above 12k, that's 2x from now. We had slow bleed, we'll have slow rise, nothing wrong in trying to set up position from here in case this is a reversal.
TBH I'm just happy to have my capital well positioned for once in my life. I've got skin in the game and am ready for another drop to re-test the low 6000's and potentially $5800 again so that I can scoop up as much as I can afford. I've been sitting out mostly for the last 6 months making too early of buy in's back in the April time frame. Create a game plan and stick to it. Work out your reactions to events prior to them occurring so that when movement happens, you already know how you will proceed in relation to that movement. 
The new low we made two weeks ago is actually good for bitcoin. Here's 5 reasons why making a new low acchkkktually indicates a triple bottom.
That's what it looks like when a leveraged position closes into a cash position. It reads like accumulation to me.

For me it's a bit different as i have been on holiday for last 2 weeks and only got back to make this count, but to me these 5 waves look plausible and now i expect a correction within the day.  adding the 55 EMA too this resistance seems too big imo for the bulls atm. 1st target $6300, then longer maybe $5000 depending on setup, will see. 
Maybe? ;)
A weekly close below 6,100 would engulf the last two weekly bodies and all but guarantee testing 5,400. I see no reason to be *that bearish*.
Agree. Last 6800 rejection is humuliating.
Ok. Let's check in with each other in 3-6 months and see how far off I was.
Nitpick: BCH isn't the first BTC fork

He didn't pu any reasoning into it, but we're banging on a resistance of a bull flag, stops above 6.8 should do the trick. I'm bullish right now, but you can't say that's poor r/r from him.

[deleted]
All jokes aside, I think we are in a very weird spot in the market right now. Personally I'm staying out of a position until I see a breakout from here. Up or down. Just really uncertain at this price.
Exactly this. R/r + risk management done good will make you profitable trader.
> Smart doesn't really have anything to do with it.

Just going to leave that out there.  You just said that intelligence doesn't have anything to do with success in daytrading.

That is so stupid, there is nothing further to say about it.

I am putting you on block, so I don't have to read any of your posts in the future.
ETH giveaways?
It's not on most of the charts, it's usually considered too confusing.
Kind of yea, actually. Not until we see some higher highs though. 

I mainly think we may need to just go up to find sellers. basically no way this is a long term reversal imo. Plus every move up is just a big candle up in 15m, none of it is real demand except for some dude closing a short or slapping down a few million to long 
naww I distinctly remember him basically having a breakdown and calling it a scam and making a chart of the most retarded h&s ever. lemme find it 

It was near the top 
Nice patience.  Looks like you got fully filled!  How low you gonna hold this position?

I'm reset on my longs now with a new entry at 6680, think I'd cut it at 6600.
Well I was overstating FOMO a bit there, it's not like I suggested a market order ;)

But you've got a good point.

I could split hairs all day on where to try to put in some buys for a long, don't need to be totally perfect.
Its the anticipation of the cross thats going to spark some confidence, not the actual crossing. The 50-day MA crossing up through the 200-day MA is one of the most popular bullish market signals in traditional stocks. I dont think it can be dismissed by it being a lagging indicator. Whats the point anyway? Not everyone trades the 2 minute chart, so for most people looking at larger timeframes this is as valid as it always has been.
will need to pump more because it is a lagging indicator. if we drop from here the cross will be invalidated.
These are great finds!

I see even Chad got in on the act: [https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-cboebzx-2018-040/cboebzx2018040-167181.htm](https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-cboebzx-2018-040/cboebzx2018040-167181.htm)
Yeah I very soon realized that the more I read lol. Still interesting to read but I wanted to know the demographics to understand the bias and incentives they may have (which in this case, are almost identical to my incentives).
I'll assume you mean the red one, haha, but that is indeed what I'm keeping an eye on!

Here's to a decent reversal to make it worthwhile.

I'll try to be more active again ;)
Next time try using the delete or update commands 
I should probably be doing the same. Day trading is such a time suck. Anyway, that sounds like the best plan given your situation. Best of luck to you!
Lol, I'm still in the disbelief camp... This reminds me quite a bit of 7.7k
Just added to my short :D
Whatever you want to call it, we organic growthed down and now we are going to organic growth back up 


Yeah... HUH? Think i missed that one
You can't magic up bubbles. This last one took several years to prime and I don't think its deflation is done yet. They can't be engineered. It's a collective madness that descends and it doesn't happen very often. 

Regardless, the last thing that'll happen is 'institutional investors' acting like shitcoin moonkids. 

They look years beyond tomorrow's pump and they're in no hurry. 
For sure, I mean if you really did buy the top, most of that was probably smaller retail and then sold off at a 20-30% loss. How many people can their be that bought a shit ton and held all the way down? Maybe I am naive.

Also, some people are me and got in early last year (or much earlier), took profits in time and have much of those sitting on an exchange waiting for a clear trend change. That is probably what u/jarederaj is saying above re:Tether.

I have seen some say that when the trend does change, it could happen much faster than anyone expects, especially if there is a catalyst in the midst of a mild recovery. I do not claim to know when that will be and I doubt it it right now, but I don't completely disagree that whatever happens, it could escalate quickly.
traders and whales, the order books are pretty thin, once it breaks out and people switch to the buy the dip mindset like they've started to do, the price will slowly go up and up and up. 
We have been selling off for 6 months lol. People have a bunch of FIAT sitting on the sidelines that they will buy back in with once they believe it is bullish. The same money gets recycled many times, we don't necessarily need new users or grandmas to put savings into bitcoin to take us to 20k. That will come later, it will take us to 100k.
lol thanks for the late reply, jk. I dozed off and re-shorted around $6580, and I’ve been scalping along the way.

Also, not sure whether to send these to positionbot, bc I’m usually in and out of these every few minutes on dumps.

Congrats on your profits!
Man, what you talking 'bout, you aint know what to do?

>My ambition as a ridah ridah!
time to change job !!
There is a difference between manipulating a price up 0.01% for 5 minutes and manipulating it 50% over a period of weeks.

> so someone is giving it a little nudge

Unlikely it is anything remotely resembling just a nudge.  
I dont get this volume argument. We are in a bearmarket, the price is declining since 7 months now, where the hell is that volume going to come from? There are so many people that sold in the last 7 months that dont even dream about entering until we hit 10-12k again. Declining volume is a symptome of a bearmarket, not the other way round.
That’s manipulation 
Activate quantum immortality.
yeah I mean it literally takes just 10 people like him to read this sub and you're moving a large chunk of the market by persuading them to long/short. it's kind of crazy 
It's pretty frightening isn't it? Lol. Now imagine it's not some degen gambler on btc markets and it's a guy with 10x his money. They can literally move the entire market
Yes, it's on the left side in contract details! You can see it for any contract 
On the left of the pic it says 14.82x leverage
Just joking around, I don't give a shit either way tbh.  I'm not trolling about *you* actually ;)
WRD
Hahaha my man
that's like 4 months man lmao what're you talking about 
Exponential losses? 
This has never been more appropriate.
Absolutely wonderful, would gild this if I weren't on mobile. I believe this is dead on, and large  players in the space have literally admitted to this publicly before. 
Yep, this is the only theory that makes sense to me. I'd gild you if I hadn't gotten slaughtered by a bear recently.
Yeah I believe this is a thing in other markets. It has occurred to me that Bots may be operating in swarms to move the price deliberately.
Agree its helpful to know the concepts but basing your trading on it is crazy.
CME futures hath eaten the apple, then the eyes of both the bulls and the bears were opened, and they realized they were naked.
it's not silly at all- people have been saying what he's saying for a very long time now. some people don't understand that no price is too low to sell, no price is too high to buy. if you were holding hundreds to thousands of coins and were worried there might not be another chance to sell at $9k+ why not unload some right here? and what happens when everyone has that same idea? bear market

if there is no genuine fundamental demand the price will sag until a hypeless demand meets hypeless price at an intersection. 

of course everyone disagrees on where that intersection is, but believe it or not, $6.7k bitcoin isn't a "low price". the same people who say "look at the bull market we're in, we're still up 200-300% since last year!" are the ones who say "we've gone down far enough. this downtrend has been ridiculous!" lol
i fucked around and shorted EOS at .00193 or whatever the number of 0s it is. basically the top. 

guess how much I shorted? 1 EOS lmao -_- i tell this story like 5 times a week
Same here.  Out at 469.  Jumped back in after getting stopped out of the last flag re trace.  I wouldn’t exactly say it’s tanking though.  I’ve been getting chopped up on 2-3% stops for months.  Not sure why he thinks this small move down is tanking.  The re entry is always there with a little patience.  I was really hoping we’d get another break up though...

Edit:  never mind, just checked the ratio.  It is tanking.  
I understand that this sub is for bitcoin, but on some level we need to acknowledge that ETH and BTC coincide with one another (I mean come on they are two of the most liquid assets in the crypto market and make up the majority of alt trading pairs). I almost exclusively trade in ETH, but love this community, so I'm willing to keep the ETH talk to a minimum 
Are you serious? The thread looks like it was brigaded at close by ETHers. Please take a temporary heavy hand to get this convo back " ~~loosely~~ related to bitcoin trading"  The post needs to at least be denominated in ETH/BTC or contain the word Bitcoin to belong here.  The altcoin thread is empty for a reason.  I thought you guys were sleeping.
Well if sloppy is saying bullish then I'm refinancing my house and going 100% all in.

You can live with one kidney right?
Worth noting that 200 BTC of longs closed on the recent mini movement down, I'm not sure how much funding is usually available but if that trader/entity then put the proceeds up for lending it could contribute to that. Longs are also down about 1k from their recent peak, possibly lessening demand for funding.

It's an interesting observation but I'd like to see some data that says this kind of observation actually plays out bearishly more often than not because it seems to be up for interpretation.
So if people are done opening longs and there are more shorts wouldn't a short squeeze be a more profitable / easy to execute move?
Oh.
the inverse head and shoulders? time predictions are difficult but it's still the same market cycles in play right? I think chart patterns are more about context than shape .
He said so at 10k too
I do. With great confidence. Down = small and short-lived. Up = big and long-term.
I've already taken 50% from it. (edit, actually well more than that considering the scalping adds/takes versus the original size, it's become one of those rare flowing positions that lasts a long time)  So I won't feel horrible if it ends up going back to break even of its current ca.  

Was thinking I might hold it to at least 6600 before giving up on it.

But you have a good point, thanks for sharing your sentiment. Perhaps I may as well just close it, let the new long ride, and quickly let go of that one at its much higher BE of 6700, and then take a fresh position from wherever it lands. (but a drop fakeout there will probably end up sacrificing its entry, and leading to getting chopped up trying to reenter)

Still sitting on my hands, lately doing nothing with already open positions has been working out better for me...
> Jesse Livermore

Wow TIL about him, thanks for pointing him out!

> Livermore left traders a working philosophy for trading securities that emphasizes increasing the size of one's position as it goes in the right direction and cutting losses quickly. 

> Livermore sometimes did not follow his own rules strictly. He claimed that his lack of adherence to his own rules was the main reason for his losses after making his 1907 and 1929 fortunes. 

> He proceeded to lose 90% of that 1907 fortune on a blown cotton trade. He violated many of his key rules; he listened to another person's advice (he preferred working alone) and added to a losing position.

After reading his wiki, I've sort of just realized that I've won very very few trades that I added to when they were underwater.  The only times it's really worked out is to buy in heavy on a spike at the bottom to bring the ca down, then close at the now lower break even on the bounce back up.  But that's when it's still within close range.  (but trades that are slowly scaled into over a kinda wide time frame, with small incremental stakes, which may stay underwater for a little while but not heavily, is a different story and I've had good success there)

Hmm, this is where we could be right now:

> It was never disclosed to anyone what happened to the great fortune he had made in the crash of 1929, but he had lost it all.  It is possible that Livermore turned prematurely bullish and **bought stocks and commodities long before the market finally bottomed** in the summer of 1932.


Yeah that's what I thought you were showing.

I disagree with that being a true divergence as you're skipping peaks. The first two peaks is certainly a divergence (that has already played out) but the second and third don't make a divergence. Comparing the first to the third isn't good practice.

I will say that the second to third is very close to being one, just *not quite*. Maybe semantics as the underlying market dynamics are pretty similar with an essential RSI double top but I'm still playing the wait and see game.

"EOS Centralization: Top 1.6% of Holders Own 90% of Supply"



"Year-long ICO to promote decentralization." Okay.


I'm going to stop replying now because reading about this POS coin is vastly accelerating my aging. 


EDIT: Also, I am not a BTC maximalist at all. I have made a majority of my gains from trading and holding ALTS. 
I cannot even comprehend comparing ETH to EOS. I can say honestly I own currently 0% ETH, but I have read enough about EOS to know that they most likely will fuck a lot of the stakeholders. 



There is a difference in value added to the world vs monetary value. Right now they are only valued monetarily. If they didn't do a 1-year ICO and were simply graded on their ability to develop tech, the coin would be irrelevant. 
Doubt it. If people were dumb (lucky?) enough to have gotten in early in EOS and made money, they most likely will exit to a new alt. Those that exit at a loss are what I'd be worried about. 


Also, I'm gonna steal that phrase "no coin is on an island." First time I've herd it put like that and I like it, so thanks.  
He just says whatever comes to mind.
Think of all 20 ways the universe could turn out in the next year. in one of those, btc ranges in your range. 


Simple, man. just think of all 20 ways the universe could exist in a year 
With my brain.   How did you calculate that there is significant probability of price ranging between 7500 and 5500 for 6-18 months.
Hmm? Alts start falling after the news, of course it is relevant 
ethbtc is rekt tho

No, I mean it seems that typically if a false breakout is confirmed in a wedge, the price seems to swing pretty hard in the opposite direction. It would just seem weird to me if it re-enters the wedge, bounces once, and then moons.
over~~trader~~achiever :D
I'm not antagonizing you, I'm just noting that that's kind of remarkable to catch the exact bottom, especially with a market order. In fact, I would think that the spread alone would mean you would have had to at the very least market sold into the book .5 higher at 6616. How does one manage to market *buy* into the book when market sells never reached the 6615 buy side of the book?


Yeah but that's a little hard to believe. Smashing the market buy button at that price probably wouldn't have slipped and filled much higher. And setting a limit order at a .5 interval at the *exact* bottom? And getting the rebate? *And* he's 16 for 16? Come on, gtfo. That's angel-sidekick lucky.
They make their money selling ads, making people depressive, and driving political polarization. Of course they hate crypto, which has use cases beyond selfies and "bro" apps
They don’t choose to and are scared to learn how to code for blockchain and crypto so they just fud it and want to keep their cushy six figure “engineer” jobs.
Not pointless, strategic. Reason being that if the SEC is concerned for the general public being bamboozled and losing their retirement, this will generally allay their concerns, as the general public can't afford to buy in. 
Doesn't really matter how far it went, what matters is support here. If it's gonna be strong enough it'll break the resistance eventually.
Shoulda scalped my secondary long there but froze up instead of clicking sell!
I've read "this one [direction]" instead of "this one [market]" and found it pretty funny. But then, I'm drunk, so whatever.
That's what I was just thinking. Btc sure ain't going up. I don't know what to think. Like it's some conspiracy. Maybe this is the alt coin purge. 
I would be much less hesitant if every move up wasn't a 5-15m candle of what looks like one large buyer attempting to push the market up on decreasing volume. 

The April rally was basically an unstoppable move up because sellers disappeared for a while but this is getting stopped every 1% up and someone has to forcefully push it higher

Really, look at the 15m, the entire move up has been over 6 big candles. I am just hesitant to long on hoping some guy pushes this higher 

But mainly I'm just waiting for $6900+ or <$6600 and particularly <$6400 
That is not true. Alts were not falling, they were just mostly stagnant in October and November. The Big altcoin movement stared around November 24.
I'm not going to argue about the obvious.   Btw, 2+2=4 and not going to argue about that either.
Why is a mod personally attacking people? Not cool.  His statement is more fact driven than yours is anyway, all of 2018 when BTC has pumped,  alts have pumped harder.  It’s reasonable to assume this would continue until we see otherwise.  I know that bothers you, but this is a fact-based subreddit.
Do you think we've found our long term bottom at 5700-5800? 

I remember a few months ago, when the sentiment was better that this number was thrown around as being the bottom.

I mean it could be true if this plays out like 2013 and we're relatively stable from now till we start arching up again in 2019
Did you just imply that people with a short position are less worthy of being listened to then those with a long position? You're just super duper biased. Sorry man.
Yes, says the same guy who opened massive shorts at $20K and $10K.  Anyway that is lame ad hominem attack, and I stand by my statement about the low probability of ETF getting approved anytime remotely soon.
The volume matters....everything else is noise
Anything at these volumes is noise. 
Hehe, I will come back when I have my next big win and make back my losses. I can't show my face there after so many bad trades ;P
I mean we have strong support 6600-6650 and strong resistance at 6750-6785 so we are getting squeezed in between those ranges. People who are bearish are selling when it gets closer to the top of the range and people are buying when it gets closer to the bottom of the range. It's not artificial in the sense that someone is desperately holding up 6700 or someone desperately selling down 6750. 
The only thing this is based on is brainfart.
i keep seeing some spoofs but nobody seems to be taking the bait anymore, instead now we just see 15 minute harrys when he wants to pump or dump
I've been very profitable these past 6 months, the problem is having a plan during these indecisive moments.

I think some level of manipulation is going on, but I'm unsure of the end goal behind it.

Either the whales are acting as the catalyst to try and kick start a reversal/bull run

Or 

They are trying to make people think this is the reversal so that they can dump it.

Either scenario is plausible, only time will tell though
So whats the plan if you go all in at 5800 and it plummets further.
Almost like putting the ball up in volleyball only for it to get spiked in your face
Fair enough!

Until then!
BCH isnt the first BTC hard fork that actually contests the main chain? bullshit
Thank you.
just TA and bitmex ref shills

I'm still at 0 users referred someone throw me a bone :p 
He's been deleting a lot of his posts too lol
Yes 6557 was my lowest

I keep those to 6200 at least, as long as btc don't crash things feel ok 
I know of the delete command, but is there also an "update" command (other than the add/profit commands)? I can't find it documented on the site...
I've been thinking the same thing...

Fool me once... shame on you...

Fool me... well... you just can't get fooled again!!!
heh okayy then
All tether is waiting to be converted into CC. It almost never turns into fiat. Anyone holding tether is effectively shorting CCs for a better entry.

You can lump every shitcoin in with tether. When alts finally get crushed and start to rush into BTC you'll see those markets pumping Bitcoin and begging for tether. It's going to be a sort of bank run facilitated by access to tether.
But if no new money is coming in, you are basically buying and selling to yourself and cannibalising the market
So basically the current market cap can stay the same but we can push it up to 20k? I mean the paper profits might be fun to look at, but who cares if there isn't any liquidity to cash out into
Hah, it's up to you really. nice job man. scalping is too stressful for me :P
I mean, I could conceivably keep adding to this short up to about $8k, which keeps the pressure off a bit. That rejection was such an odd double-sided dildo though.
Yeah I was in between before, but it's just being manipulated no matter how you paint it 
what are you arguing? His point is that a reversal will see an expanse in volume- which we have not seen. we've seen a decline. 


Go look at the first run up in 2015 after we bottomed out, it's literally a parabolic blow off top with expansive volume. this is not that at all
Ugh your making me get all existential and shit. Damn.
Immortal quantumality activated
Lmao! Didn't see that. The reason is that I don't think we are going lower than the previous consolidation of 6500--6600 so a liquidation a bit under 6500 feels safe
He was clearly talking "in general" as a reply to modestmouse415 :p

(And I assume most of us had that... drawing on that 15min chart to realize it's just noise on the 1D/3D.)
I can only lose 1x, not exponentially. 
It looks like you asked for more animal facts! Pigeons can move their wings ten times per second and maintain heartbeats at the rate of 600 times per minute.
> if you were holding hundreds to thousands of coins and were worried there might not be another chance to sell at $9k+ why not unload some right here? and what happens when everyone has that same idea? bear market

Have you personally communicated with anyone who fits this description and who has taken this action?
I shorted XRP at the top of the $10k cycle for a total of 1% of my portfolio. To be fair, I went heavy short on BCH at the top, so I can’t complain. I’m honestly just scared to short alts after ETH held on for most of the dump from $10k though. I keep saying I’ll try TRX next now that it’s on bitmex, but I haven’t bothered yet.

I guess I just never think to short alts until it’s too late.
Say no more! See my edit ;)
I'll discuss a crackdown with the other mods. Thanks for bringing this up.
You can live with 0 just not for very long 😎
The way I see it is that money that could be used to buy coins is being lend to others who open longs.

This means the lenders are not confident enough to buy coins at this price and prefer to profit from daily interest rates on their loan.
should go ahead and change your flair to bullish bro.
So you've triple mortgaged the house then and put it all on BTC?
> Hmm, this is where we could be right now:

lol I laughed out loud
His story is a riveting one. So much so, that it remains a classic for traders because of all the gems hidden inside. You should read "Reminiscences of a Stock Operator".
I agree with this. If I wanted to compare the first peak to the third I'd used 12 hour candles and there's no divergence on the 12 hour. 2nd and 3rd peaks are showing a double top on the 8 hour though which is bearish. There is also a very slight div playing out on the 4 hour right now: https://imgur.com/a/Ynww3Pa
Are you seeing a falling wedge on the 1W? If so what're you thinking about it, just relief or potentially more substantial? 
you could look at at as there are only two peaks, the one and the third one on the chart; the one in between looks more like noise to me

MACD also looks bearish on the 4h
"EOS Centralization: Top 1.6% of Holders Own 90% of Supply"

This is a pretty stupid comment. Everyone who has bothered to spend more than 1 minute looking into this knows that those top holders are exchange wallets.
centralization, in cryptocurrency space, is a phenomenon not even Bitcoin is exonerated from... every coin out there has this problem. EVERY ONE of them.. whether it's miners, delegates etc... this is not a reason for hating coins... personal feelings are a bit of a drag in trading. 
Well I've read even more and I know they will most likely NOT fuck stakeholders! (see how easy this is)

And of course they added value to the world, a lot of features implemented in EOS were completely new. Using accounts with permissions instead of keypairs, Ricardian contracts, using bandwidth instead of transaction fees, last irreversible block for confirmations. EOS contains one of the first implementations of the Bancor algorithm.
Bought at $5 sold at $14, no regrets
"no coin is an island"

based on "no man is an island"

https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/no-man-is-an-island.html
I didn't man, I'm bearish medium term, bullish short term and bullish longterm. 
Alts have been falling for ages, way before any irrelevant news. This recent sell off started right after btc wicked up, unless i missed some news that happened right when the wick happened? 
The dotted green lines, esp the bottom one, are very strong supports, so maybe it can bounce off the double bottom
hahah thanks man. I feel like my trades are getting tracked more lately, and I’m just trying to keep this streak alive, which makes it super tempting to close any time I’m in the green. Don’t be scared like me.
It reached 6615 on the sell side, but yeah I got incredibly lucky. Still confused why there was no overload, which sketched me out on holding my short for longer since it seemed oddly controlled. Wish I had closed it all down there, but I got pretty darn close at least on the retrace.

Also, this trade was underwater til a few hours ago, and I managed to scalp a profit off like a $100 move that bottomed right back down at $6616 a few minutes later. Not really a mind-blowing trade in my book regardless.

Either way, I’m glad you’re engaged enough to fact-check everybody’s posts. Just don’t want you thinking I’m being disingenuous, which is why I try to post my trades as soon as they happen.
Also, I don’t limit buy/sell. I wish I did, but I’ve found the market flips direction too quickly for me to nab tops/bottoms unless I market trade or try to predict tops/bottoms with a limit order (never ends well). So no rebate for me, unfortunately.

Also, I admit I’ve been super lucky. But I don’t know how you’re questioning my trades when I sent them to PositionBot as soon as they’re conducted. If you tracked my page, you would see that.
Can't a retail mutual fund just allocate money % in this etf and they can get exposure that way? 
aye
Move down did look the same way.

I've said it once. We will be at least 30% from the bottom already before we confirm the reversal. I'm just looking for signals that may tell this earlier. I might be wrong, I just see this move is completely different from previous dumps. Buyers are hesitant but sellers aren't too cocky right now. Both sides are in disbelief right now, a lot of people waiting out of position to see where this is going. We're pushing up for like 10 days in a row and every dip is bought up. This is either about to break up or paint huge ascending wedge.
Did you close your shorts?
> I would be much less hesitant if every move up wasn't a 5-15m candle of what looks like one large buyer attempting to push the market up on decreasing volume. 

What if the market maker is beating the market?

As in... he is pre-emptively pushing the market where he knows it will go before the public does.

So we're all just clueless and consolidating at his made prices.
Yes they were. The situation was even worse because people dumped their alts for free BTC fork coins a month prior to the run. Then they regained some of their lost value after Segwit2x was announced to be cancelled.

Then they got rekt again when the BTC futures speculation started. The reason they lost USD value was because people were FOMOing into BTC so hard that made the alts lose satoshis much faster than BTC gained USD. Everyone was scrambling to get as much BTC as possible even if it meant selling their altcoins at already low satoshi prices.

Sure some alts like ETH remained stagnant after dropping but alts that had a lower volume than ETH were demolished. Even ETH dropped but not as much as the other alts.
I don't have a problem with a mod commenting on my post.   He is a permabull and BTC is down 65% over the last several months, so of course he is a bit unhinged and thinks it's crazy to short below $6000.  He probably said the same thing about $12,000, $10,000, $8000, etc.

I haven't gotten banned in this sub for a few weeks now, and it's very surprising, considering how honestly and accurately I speak.  The truth hurts more than anything, and I realize that.


> Why is a mod personally attacking people? Not cool.

Technically... unless he greens that post... he is not speaking as a moderator.

Would you prefer Jared create an alt account to say his peace?

I know I wouldn't.

I say we should encourage him to engage in discussion however dastardly.

He spends a lot more time here than the rest of us.

He could have just banned /u/PeaceHere if he really felt like it and nobody would have known.
I'm unaware of any evidence that shows causation between the price of Bitcoin and the price of alts.
> Do you think we've found our long term bottom at 5700-5800? 

Personally I do believe that was the bottom.

That's what I told my friends at least, and they've been happy with that advice so far.

That is unless another black swan event like the mt gox collapse occurs in the near future.

If CZ_Binance decides to just take the money and run... we'd be lucky to see $12 BTC next week...
I think it's a candidate for a bottom. I'm advocating a long-term DCA through the end of the year, ATM. I've been saying that we're going sideways/down for the last couple months, but I don't know where the bottom is.

Short-term, this feels like accumulation to me, but I've been wrong about that more than once.
Jared isn't implying anything other than /u/PeaceHere likes to throw a lot of assumptions around which isn't helpful to anyone but him or herself unfortunately.
What evidence is there that shows altcoins always follow the price of Bitcoin?

I'm asking you to support your claims with evidence. That's not a personal attack.
Yup both UP and down
A wise man once told me that a trade should end on 1 of 3 outcomes : A big win, a small win, or a small loss. If you take a big loss, then you fucked up.
Awww, you don't have to wait for all that. Good luck! 
I can totally agree with that statement. I'm not even getting the feeling of desperation as much as the feeling of this price range being the edge of a cliff and either direction that it falls from this point, will most likely be grossly exaggerated. So if it convincingly breaks out of $6700, we may see an upwards squeeze a few percentage points and same if it dips below. The uncertainty has ETH, LTC and BCH all moving down while bitcoin stays in its small trading range. 
Average down and accumulate. At this point in the bear market, I'll be okay if I lose some of my fiat capital if the trade off means I accumulate more bitcoin or litecoin. I just think we've gone far enough into the bear cycle rabbit hole that if I DCA over the next few weeks if it continues to drop, I won't be so concerned if it continues to fall. Anyone buying between 5.8k and 6.7k in my opinion is making a smart buy as we've held 5.8k well and I think the market overall is interested in a small bull run to re-test 8k-10k range. 

I could be absolutely wrong and we may still have further to fall. I'm hoping that we maintain these support levels and start testing overhead resistances. Good luck to all traders. 
Bitcoin XT was the first BTC fork. 


You never mentioned anything in your orginal comment about "contesting the main chain", thus I corrected you.
I'm looking thru his shit and it's painful. this guy is seriously the biggest moron 

you can't even 1/trade him because he's so erratic lmao 
Can you do that on TradingView? I don't think that's possible.
Iirc syntax is !long [instrument] update [new ca] [new multiplier] [new percent] 

It'll just override the current entry, it appears as an open in the DB. Not sure how it affects the cumulated PnL. 

Useful if you do a lot of laddering (in or out) or scalping with open positions. 
except no money is coming in because of the bear market. Once the market goes bullish, once buying BTC and holding it again becomes the path to riches, guess what...new money will suddenly start coming in 
Market cap = price x supply. If we go to 20k the market cap goes up even if no new money enters. This is why market cap is completely useless and doesn't mean anything. 

If we go to 20k yes, you will be able to cash out at 20k. I don't get your confusion here. 
Yeah, not easy, but I enjoy it on dump days. I miss out on some of the big gains, but makes me feel more comfortable if I lock in my profits. By the way, I actually got my first technical loss on position bot buying back $20 lower due to trading fees hahah. A -0.02% PnL is nothing to sweat over though. Good luck to you.
I would just completely close my short if 6850 breaks and maybe start adding at 7100 again.
Yeah and the rest of 2015 has declining volume and nobody actually believed in the run up to $500 at the end of the year, people started buying the last few days of the pump after weeks of green candles. And then, in 2016? The price stayed pretty stable and from march to june we had nice organic growth with declining volumes to levels not seen since mid 2014. So what does volume tell me? It tells me this is not a parabolic blow off top with expansive volume. Nice, it doesnt have to be. Reversals come in different forms, thats all im saying. It doesnt even make sense that we would have a reversal like that if you just look at the charts, if you dont have a steep drop, you arent going to have the reaction to it. If you take a detailed look at the situation right now, Bitcoin hasnt looked like this ever, the only thing coming close is 2014 but even there the drops where way more brutal even going into 2015.

Im not even saying the bleeding is over or that we've found the bottom, Im simply arguing that the volume-theory doesnt hold a lot of value in times like these.
Wow, you take reckless gambling to the next level. Even if you're lucky this time, it's not going to end well in the long run.
ooooooh! I see now. i actually agree with his comment, it's really funny when people do that 
You cannot lose.

But in all seriousness, it still takes a significant amount of upwards movement to make that money back. Which is why "only what you can afford to lose" is so prudent. because then it's truly  r/r worth taking 
what about the cedar wax?
sure, mikexbt re-hedged his short 5% above his futures expiry just 3 days ago. It's a $3mm short. or $5mm, can't remember. 

but that's kind of a silly metric to go by: "Do you know anyone personally" 

do you know anyone personally who's about to buy 1,000 coins? 

if there is no demand, these people will cash out. I know it's generally seen as unlikely or illogical by a lot of people but really there's nothing silly about cashing out if the market continues to look bleak
Thank you for your consideration and thank you for Moonmath 
Pffft who needs kidneys/life when you can own even MORE btc!
Is the lending pool comprised mostly of a few individuals with a lot of money, or a lot of individuals with a little money?
couldn't this just mean people who are playing the gambling game outweighs people who are legitimately buying coins
Don't threaten me with a good time.
The ending of his story... damn.

Thanks for the recommendation!
Since breaking down from the triangle and major log support I've been bearish as I expect it to become resistance, I honestly don't really see this relief rally going too much higher, maybe between 7.2-7.5 depending on how slow it is. Would love to be wrong of course.

I recognize the possibility of the wedge, the volume certainly fits, but I also think just chopping off the first wick down to 6k is a bit of searching for hopium - at the time it certainly felt pretty significant. Definitely plausible to view it as an overreaction but idk. Would put more value on the prospect if we reclaim the triangle/log support line - but it's hard to know if we'd just bounce down off the top of it once more or break out until it happens.
Maybe but idk, it definitely looks like a higher high in price peak to me (on the 4 hr - zoom out and I'd tend to agree more). Just saying I'm skeptical. Wouldn't be surprised by a fall off to search for support somewhere either.

I don't really use MACD much so not gonna comment on that one.
Did you even look at the graph? Sure it shows the top ten holding 50%, lets assume these are exchanges. Then it shows the top 2570 holding 90%. So essentially the top 2570 wallets ~1.6% are in control of 90%, with the wallets 11-2570 holding 40%. This is marginally better. Then the other 161k hold 10% combined. 
Bought at $4 sold at like $6. Some regrets 
Money is money. Good on you brother! Happy it worked out for ya. Others will have a harder time once EOS is seen for what it is: literally the absence of working tech lol 
You said there is significant probability of price ranging between 7500 and 5500 for 6-18 months, but you didn't calculate that?  Maybe you just heard voices in your head and decided to share them with us.
No I don't think you're being disingenuous necessarily, I'm just pointing out how razor thin that margin must have been if that's the accurate close price and, given that I have PTSD from fake BitMEX screenshots and sock puppets in this sub, so it's hard for me to put too much faith into people's honesty here. That said, I don't have any other reason to doubt that what you're saying and I also just don't care, I was just pointing it out.
I'm not questioning your trades, I'm just pointing out that *market buying* into the book that low on a wick on relatively illiquid futures contracts is quite the feat. I double checked and the price actually made it down to 6615, so there could presumably have been liquidity for a brief moment right above at 6615, but knowing the spread and volatility futures have, I'd guess probably not or at least not for long. Usually if it wicks down like that, the sell side of the book remains significantly higher until the price shoots back up.

The fact that you **market** bought into 6615.5 is even more remarkable, but stranger things have happened, I suppose.
It doesn't really look the same way though

I'm not a permabull.

I chided you for claimimg that alts always follow the price of Bitcoin.
Well, he chided him for shorting, which is, unfortunately, a mod trying to humiliate someone for taking a position based on arbitrary speculation. 
I very rarely speak in absolutes, unlike most of the people here who think they have magical powers to see the future with certainty.  I say what is likely or unlikely, or even give a % probability, which usually hurts the peabrains who don't understand how that could be possible.  Then in their next post, they will say BTC will definitely hit $10K before the year is up.  You can't fix stupid.
I never said that altcoins always follow the price of Bitcoin.  That would mean they do so 100% of the time, and while many people here think everything is either 0% or 100%, I realize that is not the case.

The evidence that alts move with BTC the overwhelming majority of the time is on the charts and also in historical data that you can find on the internet.   Look there for your evidence.
But didn’t you say you would “scoop up as much as you can afford”?


How are you gonna average down if you have no money left?
Makes you think how he was the top guy on Trading view for all those months. Its all a sham, he's probably a tool used by the whale bourgeoisie to manipulate the markets even further and steal money from the working class.
No I don't think you can delete ideas anymore (if you ever could), which is a good thing.  I tried to delete one where I made a duplicate post and it wouldn't let me.  I've had a ticket in about it since I made the post lol, still no response.
I think he's deleted one idea before, I don't use tradingview to post ideas personally so I could be wrong
Cheers!
Yeah prob a good idea. This area just kind of strikes me as similar to $10k for some reason though. Everyone was waiting for $9.8k to break. When it finally did, we were supposed to head straight to $10.2k. Instead, we bumped our heads on $10k and everyone going long got dumped on. Even if it breaks out here, I’m probably going to scale in all the way up to $7.2k and hope it holds.
Wheres the expanse in volume on the blow off top? volume upwards is constantly lower, it's just people waiting to sell- it's not demand, it's a lack of supply until the top 
I absolutely believe there's a strong possibility this will reverse and head back down at 8K or so. 

However, from the little I've gleaned about TA I think some posters here are doing a little bit of putting the cart before the horse when it comes to the issue of volume. Volume doesn't have to come roaring back for price to appreciate, it's just that sell volume has to dry up enough, correct? Then, once enough of a bullish trend has established itself, the (buy) volume picture should come back due to retail FOMO.... 


He knows it's reckless, but doesn't care. He's very public about it. 

There's this huge stigma against gambling in this sub which is understandable (this is supposed to be a trading sub). But as a fellow degen and poker player, I respect his balls and am interested to see if he makes money.
Interesting, so you think /u/mikexbt fits into the following category?

>If you were holding hundreds to thousands of coins and were worried there might not be another chance to sell at $9k+ why not unload some right here? 

I thought he was more of a trader who also longs to make profit. 

Sorry if I was unclear, I'm saying do you know of anyone who holds hundreds to thousands of coins who has sold around $6,000 because they fear the price might never reach $9,000 again? My point is if you have never even spoken to someone like that, then what are you actually basing your assertion on? You're a smart guy Sloppy, I think you know what I mean here.
I don't have the answer to that question
Don't make me suck your dick.
The quote you threw up is very deceptive. 

So the top ten are exchange accounts right (Which you only agree with when called out)? So how many actual people do you think that represents? 

Yet you then go on to totally ignore that in your following 2570 number.

There are a lot of whales, fair play but I am not willing to accept it is more or less than most other cryptos. 
50% gain man! Still not bad!
You must be mistaking me with someone else bro
lol I don’t blame you, people can get ridiculous with faking stuff in crypto, which I appreciate that you’re on your toes about. I def wouldn’t want to get on your bad side after these sock puppet ordeals. You can look back at my past trades though, I almost always try to short green dildos and long red dildos, and I prefer Sept futures bc the order book flips on the dump, which typically signals a good time to enter my position. Sometimes I get lucky on these wicks and sometimes I don’t.

Anyway, I’ve gotten caught up in this and don’t even know how my position is doing. GL with your trades!
remember it's at a discount too so he got a bit less than 1% from the bottom I think 
lol well it looks like technically my buy spanned between 6615.5 and 6616, but I figured it wasn’t worth figuring out what that averaged out to. So yeah, I guess you’re right. It def was only down there for like a second or two though.
I meant that it was slow push down, now it's slow push up. Yeah, I know, those are strange candles but think differently. We are low. Sellers are afraid of reversal, buyers are afraid of another drop, yet some people are moving price up without any strong resistance from sellers.

Don't want to call a reversal here, but ever since below 8k it's good r/r to sacrifice some profits to try to catch the bottom.
You know I hate you? :P
Ok, I stand corrected then and I incorrectly assumed you are a permabull when that is apparently not the case.

And I never claimed that alts always follow BTC price.
Agreed he is a mod, and he did chide him, but he wasn't officially speaking as a mod, so I'm arguing that "it's not that big a deal" essentially.

It's not like an elected position or anything... he doesn't really owe us shit.

I've moderated a handful of subs in my day, which is why I am backing him up here.

I have personally witnessed countless good moderator actions by Jared recently.

Banning spammers, pointing out rule violations, etc... that's thankless work and he does a lot of it.

It seems like he is the only mod working this sub sometimes tbh.

He does good work imho. And has yet to be heavy handed as far as I can tell.

Give the man a break is all I am saying.

Have you been to /r/Bitcoin lately??? Or /r/btc? Or pretty much any single other crypto related subreddit out there? Jared is a fucking saint compared to that shitshow lol...
I chided him for implying that the price of alts always follow the price of Bitcoin.
> peabrains

You had me up until peabrains.

Let's just try to keep it cordial, shall we gentlemen!?!

There is no need for name calling!

I do commend you for rarely speaking in absolutes. It is indeed one of things I like best about your posts!

Just try to put a little more effort into the reasoning in your comments, perhaps. As there are a lot of comments to read through on this daily thread and if they're purely assumptions without reasoning then it's arguably a waste of everyone's time.
There is a casual relationship. There's no evidence that shows alts will always move up or down with Bitcoin.

You did say that alts will move up with Bitcoin if an ETF is approved (or rumored to be approved).

 I'm saying that there's inconclusive evidence to support that claim; it's an unsupported claim.
I've got capital in the pipe line converting to usable funds over time. So right now I've got my pile of cash ready to buy and pull the trigger with, but additionally, I have more cash that is "settling" at different dates in the future. So the price I DCA in will come after those other funds have settled. I think we are most likely at a short term "bottom" where we will see some major upside before descending further below the 5800 range. So my future buys will probably be at a higher price than where we currently sit. Or this thing bottoms out and I get to buy lower than today's low. 
why'd you delete the other comment? I'm loling at him calling for gains at literally the top

I looked thru his Twitter though he was bearish at some points before and after that. he just got faked out at the top (I think) 
I would say 6.8 right now is a stronger resistance than 9.8 or 10k. Whales know it has been rejected so many times, is a HVN, and would cost them a lot of money to break. i.e. it's not free for them. If they are willing to break it, that means they are pumping it way higher.

My 2c
That's how it feels, "let me just wait a little longer to see if I can sell just a tad bit higher"
Right!! 
So what stops someone from taking advantage of the extremely low volume to paint the charts to establish a "bullish trend" ?

The issue I'm having is trusting these larger players motives.

It could be that whales see little to gain going more down,but the overall market is still too hesitant about making moves to the upside so these larger players act as the catalyst to kick off the next bull run

Or

It could be a way to trick people into thinking this is the reversal, have longs load up, and then dump it all.

Time will tell.

Edit: in both cases things are manipulated to an extent, but the different being their end goal 
Don't need volume huh? If anything, saying that the volume will come later to match the price rise is in fact putting the cart before the horse
MikeXBT literally re hedged his short on futures expiry like a week ago. I've seen him post his positions in bitmex chat. That means yes, I personally know someone with hundreds to thousands of btc who is continuing to sell/remain short with their cold storage. 

Do you personally know anyone who's about to lay down $6,700,000 to buy? 

It's a poor metric anyway- your reasoning could be solid even if you only know guys with $5 to their name. Asking me if I know anyone personally is really quite silly. 

But like I said, regardless, I actually do know someone who fits that criteria (and so do you!) 
I can see two sides to this: the really smart people would have sold somewhere north of 10k. Those who are less in the green may have been getting more nervous the lower it goes. However, whale traders could be looking to accumulate or distribute at any relative local high or low, particularly if they know what direction things are likely to go. 

So buying right now may be buying low, or it may be buying high, depending on your time-frame and the near future. 
>Interesting, so you think /u/mikexbt fits into the following category?

 
>I thought he was more of a trader who also longs to make profit. 

I am. I believe he's referring to my short to cover cold storage. I allowed $6mm of it to settle on expiry of bitmex June futs, and re-opened it the next day after a ~8% spike.

I don't see our year long bear trend to have broken. Will close much of my  short when that happens. 
Hmm, could have interesting implications!
Dude okay my bad on that one. I come here because I trade bitcoin, I don't hope EOS is a flop, it just seems like it might be from my perspective. As a long-term investor and proponent in the space, I just hope for transparency from teams. Didn't mean for this to turn into 25 comments about EOS. Best of luck, I hope EOS gets you rich (seriously, it has no impact on me). 
Ok then was talking about the person I first replied to. 
> I prefer Sept futures bc the order book flips on the dump, which typically signals a good time to enter my position. Sometimes I get lucky on these wicks and sometimes I don’t.

You mean the premium/discount flips and this provides a signal *after* it happens? Or it confirms that you made the right trade prior to it flipping? 

And no, you're not on any list of mine or suspected of anything nefarious. 
😂😂😂😂 if we hold above $6400 nothing to worry about just yet but man that was a tough one. it looked legit
Well, no, you said "says someone who shorted a double bottom" 

I mean, how did you not? I get that PeaceHere's numbers out of his ass are ridiculous (lol) but that's not what you really chided him for, at least you didn't lead it that way
Some people have low IQ, and in some cases, it is from having small cranial capacity, i.e, small pea-sized brain.  Perhaps a slight exaggeration, but true in spirit, and for most practical purposes.
That’s smart actually!
Is there anything that could cause you to fundamentally lose faith in Bitcoin?
I thought I linked the wrong thing. Man I just woke up lol
Ok I think I get it, when you were talking about people with hundreds or thousands of coins selling, I thought you meant people who were selling and exiting the market, not people who are shorting/hedging (who will have to cover eventually) to preserve the fiat value of their portfolio. So you are saying the actions of Mike and people like Mike who are hedging are in large part responsible for the price dropping? (Not saying there is anything wrong with this at all, still trying to understand)

edit: agree that it's a poor metric, was curious if you actually knew anyone though 
No worries Megabear Peacehere.
I mean I wait til the price drops to a support level, since it usually pushes straight past orders of 1k, 2k, 3k contracts, etc to a huge buy/sell wall of hundreds of thousands of contracts. Once that wall starts absorbing orders, I smash market order and pray. There is no confirmation til after I’ve entered, unfortunately. That’s why I mean I was lucky this time.
Also, I see what you’re saying about the downvotes haha. You’re not even being that aggressive, and I’m trying to upvote your replies here to keep them at 1.
You remember when I asked to slap me in the face when I start talking shit? :P

TBH I really hoped this won't go this way again. Don't think 6.4 will hold, all of my lines broke, next one around 6150.
My point is that he makes unfounded claims that have objectively false implications. I meant to focus on his lack of attention to facts and context. My frustration came through, for sure. That was less than excellent.
LOL ok I laughed at that :P

Name calling is name calling though.

There is no need to point out one's small cranial capacities, only their points which you disagree with.
No not really. I'm not an early adopter unfortunately but I still maintain a wide level of confidence in the technology of blockchain and in bitcoin as the star of the show moving forward. 

I was looking at bitcoin back in 2011-2013 range and never made an investment because at the time, I was 19 years old with very little money to go towards something like that. I didn't get in until November of 2017 and have been paying the price of admission ever since. 

However, I am extremely bullish on crypto and the top 10-20 coins. The alts, I used to be more interested in but now feel pretty confident that they are all a bunch of unnecessary ideas being applied to the blockchain tech. Very few of those alts do I expect to see in 2019 or beyond. The only coins I'm interested in (because I have restricted myself from funding alts anymore by investing), are BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH, XLM, GRS, Monero, maybe ZEC to an extent. I'm only investing in BTC and LTC currently and don't plan on changing that strategy anytime soon. 
Well exiting to fiat is just a few steps away once they've covered. 

And there is the added factor of people covering but not wanting to continue to risk exposure. If someone shorted at $18k it seems very plausible that they'd reduce exposure / counter party risk by moving coins and selling on spot 
but I'm not predicting that is going to happen ; I'm mainly pointing out that there is plenty of supply to go around if the market continues to be bearish. People seem to think it unfathomable that people would be willing to sell sub $7k and I'm explaining why that's silly in the same way that it was silly to say no one would ever buy $15k+
Yeah it doesn't look too great now. Sub $6400 will look ugly 

The thing is it's hard to "warn" people when I think it's the top because I don't  want to be wrong and look stupid. but I did post several times that I thought $6800 would hold :P 


It was a gamble. I thought that too. My mistake was not closing above 6.6 when I had a chance after it bounced couple of times from 6.8. Took a small hit on that one, but still think it was worth it. Just annoyed that we're probably far from reversal.
Yeah I get that. I think the Bart with horns pattern is the most bearish pattern we have lol

but if we stay above $6400 we're not that bad off yet 
I'm 5x short now, we can go down now :-P
I really hate being right...
