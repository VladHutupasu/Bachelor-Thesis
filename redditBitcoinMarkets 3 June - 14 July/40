Bitfinex is under DDoS attack.

Be wary.
ok, I have a general question for the more TA-savvy guys (and this is, perhaps, the best sub of all for that). 

please consider it a neutral question as well, but didn't BTC like triple-bottomed at ~7k-ish since February. and if that's the case, isn't that actually extremely bullish in the mid to long term?
Closed my $500k long from $7433 posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ontzj/z/e04xdf5), at an average price of $7627 for a total profit of 2.6% or $13k. Tight trailing stops hit while I was asleep. I expect us to continue chopping around in this area for awhile, happy to exit my position and lock down some quick profits. 
Closed my short at around $7380 a moment ago. 

The market has so far failed to drop back below the downtrend line from $10K: 

https://imgur.com/a/FyRHGSw

RSI has been hovering just below or just above 30 on medium timeframes, yet the market hasn't really seen much of a meaningful drop since $7,800. 

I'm a bit unsure which direction the market is gearing up to push, and I'd prefer to be out of position rather than holding a short at the moment. 

I'll gladly hop into another short below $7,000 if that unfolds in the near future, or wait to see how far a potential short-term reversal pumps to the upside. I might reshort at $7,600 or $7,800 or potentially hop on board a long at $7,800+.
Um, June futures just hit 7923.
[In this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8n5lmx/daily_discussion_wednesday_may_30_2018/dztgw7p/) last week I had mentioned the possibility that between 7k-8k may develop to be a redistribution zone. The price action since then seems to have proven it accurate for now. Alt ratios moving up and down also support this point of view. So if I'm right this price level should be fine for a long-term short with reasonable leverage.

The alternative to that is the triple bottom argument, which is extremely bullish if true. But I'll stick with redistribution for now until proven otherwise.
I don't really know what to make of this, we're flirting with the downtrend from 10K. It's quite bearish that we broke up from the channel just to come back inside again, but with the triangle support so close buyers are putting up a bit of a fight. I guess the possible hidden bullish divergence on the 4h (and below) is also giving an incentive to buy. 

I closed my hedge short for now and will wait to see what happens with this 10k downtrend. 

Micro: https://www.tradingview.com/x/pdRZiTgF/
Macro: https://www.tradingview.com/x/MZyBOfNf/

In case this triange doesn't hold, a possible target for a rebound would be around 6k (blue box). Would retest the 20k downtrend and make a proper double bottom.

Still stuck on thoughts about stability. What else could be on my mind in this market, right?

Here's the broad view I've been looking at:

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/EwsyTSJs-Projecting-From-Stability/

I'm going to remove some noise and look at just the two most relvant trends, which are determined by BBand % width descending bellow historically low RSI.

https://www.tradingview.com/script/U2gQmM4U-Bollinger-Band-Percent-Width-Crossing-RSI/

When you observe croses you're left with two similar periods in Bitcoin's history which can be projected over today's price:

https://www.tradingview.com/script/SzOofdAQ-Projecting-From-Stability-Low-RSI/

Instead of looking at the weekly for those periods, let's look at the daily.

* zoomed out https://www.tradingview.com/x/9D1uBD9l/
* Zoomed in https://www.tradingview.com/x/oIdCL5qY/

It looks to me like we have market conditions that are forcing the stability that I'm projecting. What I'm really curious about is the rapidly descending BBand width on the weekly chart, but the daily conditions seem to show an environment that will produce that. 

If these conditions continue then we'll confirm a historically rare market condition, but it could go any direction at any point along the way. To confirm the pattern I'm pointing at we have to go sideways for 6 more weeks... which is an incredibly improbable scenario. We should either break up or down if Bitcoin is doing it's normal thing.

After a sideways period with low volatility AND low RSI, Bitcoin historically breaks out to new highs. There's not a lot of data to go on, though, so the 2 for 2 record we have on that is at risk for confirmation bias. The 6/7 number on periods that don't consider RSI is telling, though. 

I don't know anything for sure, and the scenario I'm describing is pretty low probability, but it seems like it's being confirmed so far... oh that confirmation bias.
We just had a +14.7% difficulty change, the biggest since January.

I expect this 7% growth per week to be an additional demand pressure, pushing the price upwards gradually.
I'm starting to think this is just a boring accumulation phase
Can someone tell me how I would calculate the price change needed to move RSI a certain number of points? Let's say RSI is 54, and I want to buy when RSI is 52. How would I calculate the corresponding price change to get RSI from 54 to 52?
!long XBTUSD 7583 5X 20%

stop loss under 7530. Let's see if this thing has legs
*We were somewhere around the 50% retrace, on the edge of the cloud, when the charts began to turn oversold. I remember saying something like "I feel a bit light headed, maybe you should trade...." And suddenly there were terrible red dildos all around us and the sky was full of what looked like huge barts, all swooping and screeching and upwards and downwards, and a voice was screaming: "Holy Jesus! What are these goddamn patterns?" Never mind, it's your turn to buy the dip." No point in mentioning those barts, I thought, the poor bastard will see them soon enough. We had two bags of BCash, seventy-five units of Ripple, five sheets of underwater high leveraged positions, a shaker full of dice, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored lines, candles, arrows, oscillators... and also a set of BBands, MACD, a plot of RSI against volume, and a Trezor full off raw Ether. Not that we needed all this for the trade, but once you get locked in a serious chart collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can. The only thing that worried me was the Ether. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an Ether binge. And I knew we'd get into that rotten stuff pretty soon.*
this is either going to keep rocketing the fuck up or just destroy every short and rocket back down.  bitcoin... this is why we watch as much as we do I guess 
If the 50 DMA crossing the 200 DMA is called a death cross.  What is [this](https://www.tradingview.com/x/VwGK3mBQ/) called?

No FUD

Edit: I know people hate these comparisons, but it marked the tipping point [last time](https://www.tradingview.com/x/XAXqg8iK/).
USD funding is as good as used up on Bitfinex right now...and its all going into alts instead of btc. Its just such a fucking crazy market 
!short XBTUSD close 7410

Tiny profit but still, waited through 7.8 underwater, expected a bigger drop and can't watch it today.

This position just looked better when I opened it.
With the number of shorts rising relative to the margin longs (which have remained relatively stable over the last month) I think the direction of 'maximum pain' is now murky where it was once decidedly against the bulls.  I think this is very good for bullish prospects considering fresh lows have not been seen since Feb and the weekly MACD is almost 'ripe' with the lowest measured selling pressure since ATH.  If margin longs are not closing, then it was very important for me to see the number of shorts grow since they will provide cushion or fuel for bulls. 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/vw4f5mQ8/

thoughts? I'm sure most of you know what this is. Looks like it's bottomed hard and is making another attempt at pushing up where there is not much in terms of resistance. Theres also the bullish TK cross but it's not an ideal Ichi trade setup at all. I know a lot of people dont have access to these charts(dotn pay for TV) so I think it would be interesting to get those views.
Anyone got a bullish chart for me?  There must be some in here, seems like a lot of people are long.

4 Hour Higher High with HBDiv?

All mine are looking bearish.

(Not hating, genuinely want to see what people are trading)
Some big market buys going on with ETH on gdax currently 
Just woke and saw the charts. Does anyone know what the shorts were at before that green candle?

Thinking this might have been a failed attempt at a bear trap to use shorts for fuel to incite a little fomo and push this thing to make a higher high. 
Why do people interpret the optimism in the crypto space as a bearish sign? It may be true that every other time crypto has had its rebound it was after near complete capitulation, but this time the entire space is on a much higher level of adoption and advancement than ever before. Im not saying we are not going to go down more, its highly likely, but to me, people being bullish and adding more money in the space is anything but bearish. As long as we dont make a lower  low below 6600 im still optimistic for the mid-term future of BTC and alts
I think we are going to range in the $7450-$7650 here for another day or 2, then break through and push to $7800 and above. This is one possible outcome I see happening in the coming days

**Macro 4H** https://www.tradingview.com/x/hiMTBo67/

**Micro 1H** https://www.tradingview.com/x/JX6Dl0rq/

Another possible outcome as we post a higher low on the 4H around $7500, and burst through the $7650 on our first attempt: 

**Macro 4H**  https://www.tradingview.com/x/6by7bjtD/

**Micro 1H** https://www.tradingview.com/x/weg23Lg8/

The purple line represents our current resistance line which we have struggled to get through a plethora of times during this drop to $7000’s range. It also was a immediate support followed by our BGD as you can see on the chart to the left 

**Macro**  https://www.tradingview.com/x/Rijf4wmK/

**Micro** https://www.tradingview.com/x/U3Bbb0B2/

I’m currently long .15 BTC from $7472 and will plan to add around $7475-$7530. I’ll bail on anything under $7400 maybe a little lower. As chewy pointed out before, this 7k range favors Longs where if we break through the bottom of our giant triangle it’s a 10% loss, or where if we test the top it’s a 20% gain.

Or we could just bart up through the resistance right now and claim $7800 as our bitch in the coming hours. 

It’s definitely in favor to open a short right here with stops above $7675 or $7700 to avoid a wick, and the R/R for a long isn’t nearly as good. 


**Edit** Too add our formal ascending channel acted as resistance today as we touched the top of it ( Pink )

https://www.tradingview.com/x/3HA72bNM/
OK, so yesterday I mentioned in a post. That when price has respected the 0 line, as well as it has in this example it really doesn't like to [exit](https://www.tradingview.com/x/IQHXlwNr/) very easily.

That's where we are currently.  If we exit here I will try a long on the back test (with super tight stops). I'l close 50% at the Big April/May "Head and Shouldersish" neckline.  And the other 50% at June Monthly Pivot/0.382% retrace.

Trying to be bullish here!
I missed my opportunity to close under 7400, so I'm going to go ahead and swing for the fences.

!short XBTM18 add 7480 45%

Stops moving to small profit just over 7500.

We pumped up quite a bit off the dip to 7360 this morning / BFX outage. It's possible the market was gifting shorters a great exit (a la chew), but I chose to roll the dice and not take it. At this stage, I'm fully expecting to get stopped out on a breach of 7500, where I'll walk with meager profits. I opted to up my reward potential in lieu of paper profits and add to my short at 7480 (Jun futures). If we pop over 7500, we're likely to meander further upwards in this confused market. I'll take my chances that 7500 holds as resistance. If it doesn't, I'll walk with a small stack increase and I'll re-evaluate. 

edit: market closed at 7505.


Update from the [Bitfinex status page](https://bitfinex.statuspage.io/):

"Identified - The cause of the platform outage has been identified. The platform admins are addressing the issue as we speak and will bring the platform back online as soon as possible.
Jun 5, 11:10 UTC "
We failed to break the 4hr low of 7330, so I guess that hidden bulldiv on the 4hr is confirmed now. We still have a lot of resistance above, but I'm thinking a test of the sym triangle resistance line is coming in the next couple of weeks. 
This seems a weird place to stall, but I think 840,000 yen in Japan is offering quite significant resistance. While the big USD exchanges have made a series of lower highs, they've bounced off that level precisely. 
https://www.tradingview.com/chart/qKNmlgPW/

I mean isn't this obviously what we are doing?  Happens on the 6th every month after Futures close.

It's 5/5 so far.  This month will be up and you should sell on July 4-5.  Buy again on August 5.  Am I crazy?  How long before they wreck everyone that follows the pattern?

Long $500k @ $7433. Expecting a short term bounce. May add to the position. 
Remember the April 12 BGD . . the gap left by it is now being filled out . . supports the accumulation scenario . . https://www.tradingview.com/x/kLzPT3Gz/
Bitcoin high on June 5th, 2017:

**$2,637.50**
I don't usually post any charts but I feel it's necessary this time because it's looking very bleak and the 6th of June meme is a recipe for market makers to dump on everyone \(more about that later\).   


Here is a chart with overall chart structures outlined. One of the most striking things is the 33&#37; difference between those major points of control and where there's usually a large sell off. It's the same repeating pattern all the time.  [https://www.coinigy.com/s/i/5b1640b7548b0/](https://www.coinigy.com/s/i/5b1640b7548b0/)  


[https://www.coinigy.com/s/i/5b16425b38ce8/](https://www.coinigy.com/s/i/5b16425b38ce8/) : 200 MA rolling over, first time since 2014. Bands tightening \(so you can expect a big move like with BB\), Price being below the PI line \(314 MA\) \+ Bands starting to go under the PI line, hasn't happened since 2014 and when it happened it was right were the second portion of the bear market started in September   


[https://www.coinigy.com/s/i/5b1643449a61c/](https://www.coinigy.com/s/i/5b1643449a61c/) : 3D bands rolling over, almost finished. Very bearish sign. First time \(since 2014\) the daily bands rolled over entirely was the dump to 6k, when we were trending up, they never managed to turn correctly \(see previous chart\). Last time 3D bands rolled over in 2014 it was right before the same drop as I outlined in the previous paragraph.   


[https://www.coinigy.com/s/i/5b164497a9b3e/](https://www.coinigy.com/s/i/5b164497a9b3e/) : Final touch is the weekly stochastic crossing down and price again being on top of the 60 weekly EMA \(hung there for several weeks in 2014, same spot as I outlined before\).   


Now on to these market cycles. They actually go back to as far as I can draw them on Bitstamp. It's pretty insane. They were also in play during the entire bull market. They don't mean however that the overall trend should reverse. It happened now because we were range bound, but thinking that it should reverse again on the 6th of June implies that we will stay rangebound forever. This entire cycle has completed on the 4th of June actually and it fell together with some other cycles which is why I think a big move is imminent. There's some other cool stuff though. On 6th of December we were at 11.7k which started a rally where we moved from 11.7k to 16.5k or so in two days. On the 6th of march we were back at 11.7k \(three months later\). It's now again three months later \(end of the cycle, see chart structures\).   


Throw in some macro economic stuff like a strengthening dollar, global positioning to less riskier assets, tightening monetary policy and it makes sense why BTC should underperform for some time. It's normal and not that bad.   


TL;DR It's going to dump 
Closed my short at breakeven.

In better terms: 

##I  hate this range. 

I also wont be able to use mobile for next 2 hours in 30 minutes. 

My entry was also god awful 
Bitfinex has updated its status page with the statement that the root cause has been identified

"Identified - The cause of the outage has been identified. A DDoS attack was launched soon after we restarted operations. The previous outage was caused by issues with one of our infrastructure providers. While the platform was recovering, the attack caused extreme load on the servers. 

We are adjusting the DDoS protection measures to fend off the attack and be able to relaunch.

Currently we are running tests to make sure we can safely restart operations. As soon as we have a clearer ETA on when operations will restart we will report. "

No day is boring in crypto! :)
Sorry for the noob quesiton \- long time lurker and searched around here quite a bit but some of the information was fairly outdated. What exchange are you guys using for going short/long on BTC? I am in the US so I registered on Bitmex but it will not let me deposit there. 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/VAZLXfJn/

Seems like a retest of 7800 area. Added to my short. I will admit defeat at 8000 break
Chad is back in town!
I’m not worried! It’s not even the 6th yet guys 😂
Fundus are safu

Easy question: Bitcoin high and low for the following month (June). Go! 
6th of the month is just too obvious to be true. If whales are causing this, I can tell this mini pump is a bull trap. I can see some peaky blinder's Chinese blessed horse being played out.
Alright who's pissed. A BGD is nice but referencing /u/intertron's post on futures market this is frustrating. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ontzj/daily_discussion_tuesday_june_05_2018/e05je8w/
Just tested the "other" descending resistance TL that chops the top off $10k.  Interested to see if we can break through that.
The forever annoying feeling of “ I should have opened a bigger position” 

DCA’ing is a great strategy, but it absolutely sucks when you open a small position with intentions to add lower or higher and the market just takes off in the opposite direction of where you want to add. 

I said I hated this range, but I did open a long before with intentions to DCA down and only caught a very small entry ( .15 BTC ). 

Would like to add more, but now don’t want to fuck up my cost average. 
looks to be stabilizing at $7600, next we see who blinks first the bears or the bulls

opening a long or a short here with super tight stop losses is a coinflip for a quick scalp 
Looks to me like the next move down is close. Of course could be the classic upward Bart zone as well seeing as those things are a Goddam nightmare to predict. 

I'm curious, a question for the Bulls. Where is your evidence that gives you so much medium term hope? 

I'm a long term bull but medium term bear. I just can't see anything in the charts or data that says the bear market is anywhere near over.
I'd love it to be over soon but I can't see it. 

I understand the need for people to be optimistic but for me the realism of it just overpowers that urge
Here is some chart art for you guys.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/oGqhEJxI/

FWIW, ETH's IHS is much more convincing. The ratio is even drawing an IHS. I don't think this will be a flippening scenario rather a market wide bull where ETH outperforms BTC.

Edit: Annotations with possible trajectory.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/QIZ8FfOu/
Oh dear, I think people are gonna be very grumpy with Bitfinex. Especially if there's a more dramatic fall before they're back online.
If $7800 break I will go long.
Any of you subscribe to the Fan Principle?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/eeGeJRhd/

According to that principle, breaking the resistance of the third (top) yellow trend line (right where the price is at the moment) would signal a trend reversal from $9.980, signaling that the price would head higher. A break of the top resistance line would be necessary for confirmation (the price is struggling right at that spot as I'm typing this). 


I got two new rules to navigate this chop. First rule is to wait for the better entry. Second one, don’t be greedy, as soon as the little momentum that we have starts to stall it’s time to get out. 

Went from dinner at Peter Lugers to a couple of tuna subs in a matter of minutes this morning. 

!short xbtusd close 7620


So when trying to use this subs upvotes and downvotes to get an idea of sentiment so you generally feel that people vote differently when their in position or not? I generally don't downvote unless it's bad shitposting/spam or just bad content. I definitely don't downvote views that are counter to my own as long as there's some bit of logic behind the idea (other than a meme) that isn't bat shit insane.

You guys think the majority of people use the voting mechanism to reflect their feelings rather than the content(I expect this to be true most places but maybe not subs like /r/science etc) in this sub?

PS - WTF reddit this new design is fucking awful. One of the key things about reddit is it's cleanliness and simplicity.
This move was being telegraphed on all alts, but since bitcoin is the short sellers suppression market, of course BTC charts didn't see it coming.... The result is a sharp correction to the muthafucken moon.    
opening a long here, with a stoploss at $7538
A pullback from the recent short term decline was inevitable. I have not shorted this as I’m of the opinion that the short term trend is still up.

What’s crucial for bulls at this point is to maintain the higher low and not drop below 7330 or so. There are nice hidden bull divs being painted on all charts from 1-6H.

This is a golden opportunity for bulls to continue the short term trend. But it would be very concerning if we drop 7330.
I hope the June 6 theory is gonna get confirmed, it will be awesome in a very fucked up way. I’m gonna be part of the manipulation ™! Yey!
Does anybody know from experience what to expect the market to do when bitfinex comes back online?  I'm a bit afraid of a dump.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/cut96fH4/

Any idea why this spike could occur?
Does anyone here use trading signals?
Well here’s a [first](https://reddit.app.link/r2DIbDbivN)
Seems that these silly attempts to bait this goofy market into panicking by artificially painting "super-bearish" patterns by a wicky green candle (rejection off the resistance) followed by a big market dump to "confirm" the rejection are finally starting to fail. About time. Was kind of funny watching gamblers get baited by it the couple previous times.
How plausible do you guys think a multi year bear market is?
Finex cold wallet still ok https://chainflyer.bitflyer.jp/Address/3D2oetdNuZUqQHPJmcMDDHYoqkyNVsFk9r
Price drops 150 dollars and the bears are back in full swing. Price rises 150 dollars and its all bulls. The emotions in this subreddit are quite amusing to watch. I really do think its on purpose though to some extent. There's no reason people aren't manipulating novice traders on this subreddit spreading FUD and FOMO when appropriate.
So it's almost 6th and we have this huge-ass pump...
Do you guys think this falling wedge is valid?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/bZsAJjVV/

7340ish is a high volume node as well. Seems like a good place to bet long?
Broke out of the "wedge"/descending trendline from 7.7s but no volume, got stopped short by support turned resistance. Added to my position before the breakout at 7400ish but also on the breakout, avg cost now 7426. I'll exit this position soon most likely.
If this has truly triple bottomed, I have the top of the triangles descending resistance from 20k at around ~8500. A break through that would signify a true reversal. Long way to go...

I have a feeling we're going to play out the entirety of this triangle, which wouldn't be forced to resolve north or south until around July 8th. Meh.
I’m at work so have limited time. What’s the prevailing sentiment right now?  I sense there is a change to bullish.  We going up finally?  Trying to determine whether I should close my long here or hold.  Thanks. 

Edit:  update 

!long btcusd close 7610 

Decided to take some profits here.  My mood is short term bearish. 
Don’t want to ride this back into the red again.  

If it breaks 7800 I’ll likely  jump back in. Thanks. 

I’m not sure anyone has pointed this out/noticed this yet.

What do you guys think about the  **Trend Reversal Ascending triangle** on the larger time frames? 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/1gnd4XFS/ 

A break out target of this triangle would be at $8,200. If the red ascending support line holds I’ll be going ballz deep on a long on that line. If the red line holds that would be pretty bullish IMO 

Thoughts? 
Price movements under $10K have only been a distraction to shake you out before $14k - AngeloBTC
Hi guys, a new trader here. Long time listener, first time caller huh.

Since you guys like patterns, this is my observation intertwining the "futures theory" and the "weekend theory": https://i.imgur.com/lh8wnFD.png

Indeed the "saw teeth" are formed by the 5-6th each month, up and down. That's better charted by this guy https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ontzj/daily_discussion_tuesday_june_05_2018/e05je8w/

Adding onto that, any (sell high, rebuy lower) position opened early Saturday (UTC), over the course of last 2 months, would be profitable. A somewhat of an exception would be the weekend of 21-22 April, depending likely how you would play your cards. 

Tomorrow and the incoming weekend will tell if there's any credibility to this model.

hi, sorry for the debutant question, but someone can explain why the volume btc / jpy has increased since May 26 on bytflyer. ? thank you.
https://cryptowat.ch/markets/bitflyer/btc/jpy/1d
This fucking new design in shit reddit!
Does anyone else get the impression that the vast majority of the 'traders' here use this methodology:

- "price drops a couple of hundred $, we'll probably get a sought rebound so I'll write come fancy terminology and draw some lines, we've usually rebounded a little so I'll probably be right"

- price rises a couple of hundred $, same again but in reverse

Rinse and repeat
Rejected from daily EMA 12, increasing bear volume. No hope of bullish engulfing daily candle. Thinking bull trap (within a major bear trap?). The 6th monthly reversal is a meme now. I don't even. 
Based on the RSI on the 15min through 4hr timeframe I think we will bart down to a higher low in the low 7.5 to high 7.4 range in the next 6 hours.

Long-term I won't be bearish until we breakdown to the 6000's. I don't want to call it a reversal, but the limited indicators I use make me think it is. Happy trading all.
Bitfinex back online
I think we test 8k in the next 12 hours 
What is very weired togetether with this 6th of the month thing is that we are now the 25th day below 7.8k. The last time we were in the 6ks and lower 7ks we stayed there for 26 days before we saw this BGD. Tomorrow is the 6th of June and it will be also the 26th day, maybe tomorrow is the day where things will fold out.
I was not expecting to see this when I woke up today. I almost closed all my positions at 7400, too. 

Everyone was saying how bearish it was that we took away 3 days of growth in only 1 day, so is it now bullish that we reversed a day of losses in only 3 hours? I'm gonna say probably not, but I'm only saying that to lower my expectations. I think it's a fools game to say that we'll be at x price in y hours right now. We're just in for more sideways chop.

Edit: Good news for the bulls though. Longs are now at 30k (down 600) and shorts are at 22.7k (up 500).
Closing a second successful long from $7,400 here. Indicators suggest continued upward movement but I am cautious because of intuition. All my trades except for one has been successful on BTC/USD since beginning of May, buying every dip and closing out in profit. 

I’m fated to fail a few soon and would rather give more attempts at it in different trading range. 

I’m holding a few alt bags - hopefully any sustained  BTC upward movement will let me resurface in profit so I won’t be sour if Bitcoin decides to test $8,000.
Does it seem like trading has stopped on Bitfinex for the last 10 min?
So does everyone think this is going to keep dumping in order to make a new low on the 6th? Then up from there?
~400 spike in BCH on Binance at price 1124.  WTF?
It popped back up into the ascending channel, it seems.
almost looks like a falling wedge with the support line from 10k. Ive been overtrading today but ill be looking one more time for support here or a breakout.

Edit: started a long at 7420. I exited one earlier at 7415 so im clearly overtrading even though i probably covered any losses on fees with a scalp short i did from 7448. If I exit this position I'm done.

Does anybody else get bullish by looking at charts like [Paxful's increasing adoption rate in the USA?](https://coin.dance/volume/paxful/USD)

More people using Bitcoin means a higher price per Bitcoin in the long run does it not?

Or is there something that I am missing?

Sittin on a 10X long on Bitmex from 7356. 

If you were currently in this position where would you set the stop? Why? 

-edit- 

Removed stop for now. Going to enter it higher after I see what is happening. 

https://www.coindesk.com/magic-number-chart-data-hints-at-june-6-bitcoin-boost/
Nice bit of volatility there. I so nearly secured a huge profit on Bitmex June futures. Alas, system overloaded, could only close at a small profit, 10% of what it was at the top. 
Can somebody point me to the chart of the big triangle that we are bouncing in right now where we are supposed to see a major breakup or down in the next few weeks at the latest? There are many charts posted everywhere but appears everybody is referring to one chart in particular and want to make sure I am looking at the correct one. Thanks in advance

Does anyone know about using a directed IRA to trade BTC?  I'm wondering if it is possible.
Ah, another day, another long position in the green. Not closing. Only bummer is that I'm still waiting for my bank to get my money to GDAX. This is about to run up hard. Manipulation in either direction always backfires. Beautiful market, this. Satoshi will be a titan in the eyes of history.
The 2 am EST dump from Feb - April has now subtly become a pump in May / June.. patterns patterns
I am not on my charts, was the volume of the bounce legit today? Like a high volume bounce or would you consider it low? 
I see more or less the same on the weekly but you're right it's too soon to call. But then again isn't it ALWAYS too soon to call when it comes to investing?
Oh man, the big bears got *played* over the past month.  Looks to me like somebody has to cover their OTC shorts on the 6th.  This time, they didn't get quite the bang for their buck and are now looking at a VERY expensive cover,especially since it appears that someone moved a lot of coins off exchanges a couple days ago.

If you're thinking about shorting this, I'd recommend being very careful about it.
Classic bull trap before crash. We may grind up to 7700 again but there is no hope for the bulls unless we get above 7800 and the 50MA on the weekly. There's about $150 potential upside and up to $2,500+ potential downside right now, insanely good odds for going all in 30x short
So, BTC has just barted down while bitfinex seems to be out again.  If it continues to drop before bitfinex is up, will we see some massive fireworks when they come back?
Long $50K @ 7415, short squeeze coming in...

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/LnFFrP1s/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/LnFFrP1s/)
I drew a trendline from the weekly chart that goes back from novemeber, it still seems relevent as so many bounces have been happening from it still over the last few weeks. [https://www.tradingview.com/x/EgbfCkek/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/EgbfCkek/) If it still holds, we could be in for a bounce upwards soon.
I'm pretty certain we have a 400-600$ pump incoming after that we'll start a grind upwards and eventually retest 12k. 

If this doesn't occur that I expect us to retest 7k-7300 before deciding whether we go down to 5500 or up to 12k. 
This small jump coincided with OIL again, do you think bots are watching other markets and not just crypto? 
Did anyone else notice that big spike in the mempool the other day? I was wondering if those were coins being moved to exchanges to be dumped or off exchanges to cold storage where they will no longer be available for shorting. Starting to look like the latter.

And Bitfinex is gone again. Joke of an exchange

Edit: I still use it like a sucker cos of the high liquidity and maximum usd pair offerings 
[deleted]
I urge caution holding open positions on exchange. My prediction is there will be a large amount of volatility and activity and exchanges will be down. The source of this prediction is the lack of volatility, the growing momentum of the bear, and the critical historical prices that are now serving as our final support before significant decline.

Yep and Stamp real time 7380. 
BitMEX just wicked heavily and is also trading under the bitfinex price. Might see some panic, just went 100% hedged, better safe than sorry. Don't like trading while exchanges, especially mex and finex, have problems.
> Be wary.

Why?
There are 2 pieces to every pattern formation:

1. The formation of the pattern
2. A breakout from the pattern to either confirm the pattern or reject it

Until you see step 2, all you have is a **potential** pattern. 

A head and shoulders that never breaks down below the neckline isn't particularly meaningful. It's essentially just noise. 

For a triple bottom, you'd need the market to make a new local high above the point that triggered the previous tests of said bottom. 

This doesn't really fit with the market movement we've seen lately, however — lower highs and higher lows. That's a triangle instead:

https://imgur.com/a/4QcA4pj

There'd be a much stronger case for a potential triple bottom had the market pumped to $11,700 again and failed there, rather than stopping at $10,000 and then subsequently dropped to $6,000 to $6,400 and bounced there instead of at $7,000.

As it stands, there's really not a strong argument for a triple bottom. 

Regardless of whether it's a triangle or a triple bottom, the market still needs to break free of the pattern to confidently call the pattern confirmed. 

In the case of a hypothetical triple bottom, that would require a breakout above $11,700. 

For the case of the triangle I've posted above, that just requires a breakout above $9,200 or so. 



potentially. but we need to break higher to confirm the pattern. I’ve seen calls for 11.7k needed 
Yes especially when u consider how retail investors view the market in much simpler (and longer) terms than traders. If you zoom out to the daily and look at the chart from the all-time high until now it becomes quite clear that we are at the trough of a wave started at the all time high. The downward trajectory has flattened. The second half of that wave should be up.  When we look back at this six month period a year from now we'll likely be saying it was a correction not a bear market.
I think we've got at least one more touch of the bottom similar to what we [saw in April](https://imgur.com/a/XLhoOuf) 
Yes. Maybe.
Do you programmatically set trailing stops?

Good trade, $200 in the profit ain’t bad.  
Interesting--even with BFX going down / under DDoS? I know you don't particularly trade FUD, but this seems like too high a potential reward to pass up. 
I really appreciate your posts.  
Is it a bad idea to set a stop loss just above current price, just to see if there is more downside? I put my SL @ 7394 just now, after reading your post. I mean, it's a small difference in taking but a bigger potential downwards.  
Edit: got stopped while writing this.
That damn line from 10k is really screwing with me.  Depending on how you draw it, we're either above or below.

EDIT: Maybe this is the resistance TL to keep an eye on...

https://imgur.com/a/BYNbpUe
Do you think bulls have the momentum to push this past 7800? Honestly the volume and trading reminds me of when we attempted 11.6k , where a few larger players were reluctant to let it drop lower
should have waited till Bitfinex comes back online imo, could be getting interesting here.
Dang, good call

I swear you're right like 90% of the time
Just came back here to commend you on a great call. Had I closed at $7380 like you I'd have been in some decent profit. Got greedy, and held it open and ended up taking a small loss.

Nice job man.
Thoughts on the 3 day or 1 week cloud?
Welp, there went my short that I've had since 8350. My stop just over 7900 filled at 7923.
What does this mean and why is it good/bad?
That isn’t healthy. 
Can't have a redistribution without prior accumulation.
that's a fair theory, one alternative is that it's been accumulation, and we're slowly getting marked up. I'll buy the distribution theory if we drop below $6,500
Looking at your chart i notice a potential fractal. If this thing completes the pattern we should fall to above the support line (7250 - 7300), go sideways for a bit before going back up to test the resistance line of the triangle.

[https://imgur.com/a/Lq3Yzrk](https://imgur.com/a/Lq3Yzrk)

But of course that would be too easy, so it will probably just fall through... 
Sitting out for while to see what happens.
> https://www.tradingview.com/x/MZyBOfNf/

I don't know how much credence to give that trend line from 10K, it has only one other contact before this leg out and in.
Also if you draw it on finex we're back in. I would only rely on a trend line with 3+ contacts.
A period of sideways movement for consolidation. I think the market needs this after the abominable bullrun of 2017 and the excitement of the past few months to breath. Fundementals will have more time to catch up too. Sounds good to me
Couple questions: how sideways to we have to be for 6 weeks? Can we simply stay within the converging trendlines, bc that seems reasonably possible. Also, What do you consider low rsi? Looking at the two periods you projected the weekly rsi had gone under 30 and was in the process of bouncing up, we haven’t done that yet this time.
Interesting analysis and clearly well thought through, regardless of someone's position.

I was discussing the log symmetrical triangle earlier here and most say a symmetrical triangle will break 1/2 to 3/4 of the way in. When I draw the bottom line off of the three touch points I see, we wouldn't have the 6 week sideways market you propose as indicative of this movement as there isn't enough time before we would leave the 3/4 mark, unless say, the symmetrical triangle isn't symmetrical \(as it isn't on non\-log\) or as you've drawn it.

I will be super surprised, but also very interested in the validity of this idea if we stay so strictly range bound for 6 weeks. The volume supports this idea at least \(or does it, as one big whale can make a bigger splash?\).
Thanks for the field report, soldier!
We went 10x in difficulty since feb 2017 when price was about $1000.
Now I'm not saying we're undervalued now, but the mining cost/price floor of bitcoin is continuously rising for sure. And with GMO launching 24TH miners, things are gonna heat up nicely (no pun intended).

Enjoy this 'boring' low new entrant, low moonkid phase while it lasts.
Also always wanted to know this but the other reply is way over my head.

The best you're going to get without back calculating it all the way is calculating the last smoothed RS value based on the previous periods RSI to get the ratio of average gain : average loss to use in the next calculation, then estimating their individual absolute values based on the previous price movement.
And that, I think, was the handle—that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil monetary policy. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn’t need that. Our energy would simply prevail. There was no point in fighting—on our side or theirs. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave. . . .

So now, less than six months later, you can go on tradingview, and with the right kind of eyes you can see the high-water mark—that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.

B. Chucking in your unit mods, using lagging Ichi, being lazy and using 4h [https://imgur.com/a/538qyib](https://imgur.com/a/538qyib)

I have to zoom in massively to make this 2018 bounce look properly flat. I assume the closer the value is to 1 (as its normalised?) the better as the value is pushed further away as the back end becomes historic?
OK what is 1/BTCUSD*10000? 
It does looks like it has bottomed and is trying to push back up. In fact it looks like an ascending triangle. And this is exactly why a break of 6.4k would be catastrophic medium term. If we break 6.4k there's little doubt we would see 4k or lower. 

You also have to consider on the inverted chart that if the support line were to break it would just look like a big bear flag.
Doesn't the cross needs to be followed by a cloud breach to the other side of the cloud? This just means there is a lot of resistance above. In shorter time frames, the BGD usually take care of that but at this scale, a monstruous dildo would be needed to incite fomo

>  genuinely want to see what people are trading

I just went long @ 7356 (Mex.) I'm watching the 2HR RSI & STORSI, it's been suppressed for a decent amount of time. Either we push up from here strongly in the near future or we drop substantially (retest 7050.)

So I'll be watching this closely ready to exit if need be. I'm hoping for some movement up but this whole Finex thing is got me a bit sp00ky. 
4hour hidden bear div on RSI could still be in play

wyckoff accumulation?

Idk really, but it was the same sentiment in early april. Only thing is there are not enough short to be the fuel for a BGD
I got nothing :( I'm hoping for a short term relief rally to 7500 and then I'm probably out. All the charts look pretty rekt.

Edit: I'm actually still not too worried. I stated as a joke last week that we'll be in 7k for a month but I'm going to make it my official prediction now.

Reduced from 22.7k to 22.2k on finex after the mini bgd.
Cus like, not enough blood in the streets, mate. Price can't go up until all the weak hands are shaken out. Gotta see capitulation before a real recovery can happen. Markets won't just reverse until all the dumb permabull hodlers are out of money and moonboys are all gone. 

Did I get them all?

edit: oh yeah, and all the shitcoins have to die before the one true coin can rise again. 
When has any get rich in 5 years scheme ever worked for the little guy? Why do people suddenly think this is it? That this will be the saving grace for anyone who just puts enough money in and waits? 

If anything has ever seemed to good to be true with money, it's because it is. Some people are a little more keen and wary on how "easy" this all seems.

majority of alts will die but they're all still pumping, reeks of pump and dumps to squeeze every last dollar out of retail before the bubble truly bursts.

So I just put my money into crypto and I'll be rich in five years?

Yeah. Nah. I'm not that stupid. I can recognize when I'm late to the party. When rando-s who have 0 idea how bitcoin/cryptocurrencies work are throwing $20k+ into it, it's time to seriously consider getting out imo.

The space is still collectively too stupid for me to consider it legitimate. Too many college kids and people with 0 understanding of the buzzwords and new paradigm shit for me to think I'm early enough to get in on this big new thing

edit: I didn't mean to imply anyone who has ever so much as touched an alt is a moron.

I came off super elitist but rest assured that I don't consider myself some financial guru...which is why I don't trust that I've struck gold and found the next big thing that will make me rich.

I'm fully prepared to concede that I'm wrong and I won't be one of those people who calls bitcoin a ponzi while it soars 10000% over a few years. 

I just doubt it all, that's all. Perhaps my personal pessimistic view on life is interfering with my ability to evaluate the tech objectively? I don't know. I'll do some thinking on it. Thanks for the responses, everyone. Apologies for being a douchebag, I have an issue with things coming out a bit crude the first time around so forgive me if I said anything stupid. 

also for what it's worth: I consider myself dumb money. I am one of the idiots who bubbled this thing up and paid for some dude's lambo. I never lost a significant amount from investing but that's mainly cause I got out quick after it crashed. 

I don't think I'm much smarter than anyone *here*, but when I go to some other crypto places on the internet...I am a bit skeptical. 
Because that's how these markets work. Those of us buying in 2014 know it first-hand. When there's still optimism in a trend I perceive as Bearish, it means we haven't squeezed out all the greedy bastards from the bubble yet. It means plenty of people are opening margin longs with liquidation prices of "Bitcoin can't possibly go that low".

And making money in markets is not that easy, the majority usually loses. It's usually when the majority *isnt* optimistic, you want to be buying...you don't want to follow what the majority does because you're goal is to make money off of them. When the majority isnt optimistic anymore, there's very few sellers left willing to sell. That's when theres very few panicky people left when they see their wealth "going to zero" and everyone left holding has a longer time horizon and isn't waiting on some "experts" $50k EOY prophecy.

And you're right - adoption and advancement is better than before. But that's also why the price is higher than before. No asset only goes up, no matter how revolutionary it may be in the future. 2014 saw merchants starting accepting Bitcoin for the first time, good regulatory news, etc but it didn't stop the price decline.
Nice analysis dude! Had overlooked the ascending triangle type thing you've got in your charts.
Well that was short-lived (haha, SHORT lived im so funny) 
Thankfully I took some profits for my short a bit.  (I can never decide when to close, so as usual I had laddered profit taking of a few percent of the position every $25 or so, and a bunch of them have filled over the last day)

So rather than closing the rest of it for less additional profit than I've already taken, I've also increased the position greatly and have my stops at about the same.

Yeah, I only noticed that pattern after our last high, so I'm a little late to the party. Problem is, there's no guarantee that it continues.
Seems like a newly discovered pattern 

If this actually plays out I’ll just laugh at this point 
Borderline manipulation if this continues to play out.
Dampening sine wave patterns. Probably a macro reflection of the fact that there is an increasing number of algo's in the space now following each other, and many of these machines are based on signal processing ideas...just a thought.
The fact that this trend is becoming more well known, means it will not continue.
I can’t see this on mobile please ELI5 what is happening here 
More and more people post this "pattern" so I think if it even had any merit the wrecking of everyone would occur tomorrow.

If I had to guess tho we will just go sideways in the 7.5k range.
Price is still within range. A lot of people are expecting the 6th thing to carry forward and there are those who would take advantage of that fact in a negative way. Be wary.

so far to fall ;D
One criticism though is that to establish your 33% difference between major points of control, you skip the second structure, why?  It seems you're cherry picking point of controls and to establish a pattern of percentage difference. 

I also think the way you label your "retest" are quite arbitrary, why isn't the retest of 8500 labeled "retest 2" ? 


How big is your short position?
nice analysis, thanks
> Here is a chart with overall chart structures outlined. One of the most striking things is the 33% difference between those major points of control and where there's usually a large sell off. It's the same repeating pattern all the time.

That would put us at around 6680:

Isn't the point there that not getting a big enough entry is a "happy problem", as you are making money anyway?
LOL, waiting for your next move, CG. What do you think about shorting 7.7k?
The pattern:

Pump to no mans land between support and resistance and flip a coin and see if it lands in your favor 
The fact there's still so much optimism is why I'm leaning bearish. Every bottom I've seen in my years in crypto has come amidst despair and capitulation. 
> I just can't see anything in the charts or data that says the bear market is anywhere near over.

Maybe that fact in and of itself. I see the same, but markets like turning contrarian. Just gotta catch it as it happens, if so.
I'm not seeing the increasing volume on the rise out of the head that you would generally see with a IHS, especially on ETH.

That's generally a bad sign for a H&S or iH&S as volume is kind of imperative for the market sentiment the formation is trying to capture.

IMO it's just more chop.
It looks like they are trying to pump it, which would make the bears grumpy. Either way someone will be upset and I don't think finex users will be happy.
I was just watching a video minutes ago how MtGox failed and how Roger Ver was telling everyone that everything is fine and after I finish the video I see bitfinex is down and it is telling everything is fine. Deja vu moment xD
I don't expect major movements without millions of bots just reacting to the bitfinex orderbook... 
Why? You can go long for $200 cheaper per btc right now....

I have a car to sell. Are you more likely to buy it if I keep raising the price? 
NO! Demand and supply paints the chart (and a bit of bots/whales magic I reckon). Breaking a diagonal/formation is not what drives the price long-term even if some traders get excited locally.

This is the fallacy behind indicators and formations, people think ta drives the price, whereas the price drives (lagging) indicators.

Momentum is a real thing tho.
Read it yesterday in my big TA book
Bro, I'm at a negative Peter Lugers right now.

This is true for every sub on the entire site, and every community on the entire net.  Human nature is the same everywhere.
I think here’s plenty of people here that share your view, myself included. 

I also think those same people get buried in times of high volatility because the others who don’t share that view get more active on this sub and reinforce their positions. 
Less dumb people visit a sub like /r/science than a sub like /r/thedonald, so that is probably the case.  Here it is a mix but bearish posts historically get downvoted more than bullish.
Bearish posts get downvotes , bullish posts get much upvotes. This sub has a huge bullish bias.
I wouldn't say the btc charts didn't see it coming. 

There were a few factors that telegraphed a potential bounce that I cited as my rationale for exiting my short at $7,380. 

Still, while this spike was relatively violent, it also isn't particularly meaningful just yet. Pretty much any market movement between $7,000 and $7,800 could be considered noise in the short-to-medium term.
Why? RSI on 15m is very oversold. Better wait for everything to settle.
7370ish support seemed strong days ago after we broke down from the wedge, and has held so far. There should be a lot of support in the entire 7300 area, will be pretty concerning if we break below to 7200's. In that case ill still be looking a bounce soon, but that does not bode well for the trend.
It's easy to say things are 'inevitable'... After the event, seems to be a common occurrence around here 
It's already June 6 in Asia
Does anyone have the nice chart pointing this theory out? I remember seeing it in another daily thread
what's the june 6th theory?
[deleted]
If other exchanges (especially Bitmex) don't drift too far down, probably nothing much. If we see things bleed a little, Bitfinex will dump hard af once it restarts, and that'll spook every other exchange to dump even more. 
Whenever I've seen an outage, it resulted in at least a short dump. Typically gets bought back, though.
I think it is just not this big event if they are offline and online within 2 hours or so. 
Low liquidity and a big market buy
Someone market bought a couple hundred coins into thin orderbooks. It's not even much of a spike, what, 1-2%? Meh. 
Big spike and drop back down on Binance too. Maybe people are taking advantage of Finex arbitrage bots being offline, though I'm not clear what the advantage would be. 

Edit: also Stamp
Trading signals will net you +10%, +15%, +20%, then out of nowhere -95%. Just my opinion.
Successful traders use trading signals effectively. Idiots compare them to random guessing.
I've tried before, they don't seem to work better than random guessing, or they're pumped probably in a self-fulfilling way, which usually happen within minutes after the signal is given.  When they succeed it's usually in a bull market and you probably would have succeeded from random guessing anyways, and you probably shouldn't follow them at all during a bear market.
RSI on low leverage compared over multiple timeframes has been the most reliable for me. This is anecdotal ofc.
Yeah it's a pretty strange story... 
A man died trying to promote crypto? That's bullish news, pump it
Not very likely I don’t get people who compare this bear market to the one from 2014. The current bear market was due to the bubble pop of insane gains and it was due to a correction, 2014 bear market was due to the main exchange which accounted for 70% of bitcoin volume being hacked in a massive amount of bitcoins losing clients bitcoins and making everyone lose complete confidence in bitcoin. There’s 2 complete different sentiments from each scenario  . I do think that the time for 100 x gains is over but there’s definitely more room to grow in the coming years 
a year long bear market taking up the whole of this year? I'd say that's probably a 25-40% chance right now. 

Multi year? I personally can't see that happening at all. So that probably means it will happen
Overwhelmingly likely. What happens if 1% of coins are sold? The market falls apart. The underlying story is the huge imbalance of paper wealth to actual bids, no one can cash out right now.

If you don't cash out crypto is worthless, you may as well throw away the private keys. Once people try to get out the market is forced to implode.

Only a newer larger army of suckers can prevent this. There are no new countries, new groups of people to come onboard, let alone enough to dwarf the last peak.


The easiest way to model this is to take mildly more extreme example, forum favorite Dentacoin. 200mm mcap. Yet no bid, no one can cash out. At some point people will take what they can, as no one is coming to pump things up. 
funds are safu﻿


hundredth variation of the same comment. It's getting old. Plenty of people believe different things and are more vocal about it when things are seemingly going their way, who would have thought?? 
Do you honestly believe the collective buying/selling power in this sub is going to have any tangible effect on the market?

Nope

There are also many here who have held their sentiment be that bearish/bullish for a long time, me being one.
So many novice traders, in a situation where they have more capital relative to their skill level. Combine that with short time frame trading & high leverage & no wonder it is so easy to Bart bitmex. 
Hardly. There are many many people on here who have maintained their bearish sentiment for quite a while now. The people being over the top are the permabulls who cry bull run every time we jump 400 dollars. 

Any 'bull run' right now is nothing more than a blip in the medium downward trend that we have been in since end of December. Until that bull run breaks the trend, then nothing will change
People always talk up their positions, especially if they're doing well. 

I doubt anyone will spend more than a week in trading discussion forums (of any kind) before quickly being able to see past all the BS
*Yawn*
Huge Ass Pump Check: 3.57%, $264.5 (Bitfinex)
Though this is a decent bounce, I really wouldn't call it a "huge-ass pump".

Moreover, our low was a week ago, kind of invalidating the whole 6th theory. I'll be keeping my eyes peeled though, if by July 6th we're anywhere near the triangle resistance, I'm selling. 
Not that huge actually. Daily volume is still low.
A huge [ass-pump](https://xkcd.com/37/) ? 
A bit more likely than the other ones posted after you, but it could bounce within that wedge a few more times, meaning a fair bit more down before up. 
r/R seems good at least. I'm bailing if 7300 falls, probably sooner.
Yes, that wedge is invalid. Price is inside a descending channel instead. 
What exchange are you using to draw the descending resistance line? 

Even drawn generously on Stamp, I can't draw the resistance line any lower than around $9,000:

https://imgur.com/a/N5G49Zs
Long way to go? Ha! No. This is Bitcoin, and we are overdue for a one-month doubling in price.
Long way to go but I think a 10% move in either direction is no big deal in crypto. 
the "tip" of the triangle is @ July 20th on my charts (not saying we will "touch" the tip though)
[deleted]
Still in chop city. Don't take sentiment here as indication of what to do. If it raises a bit bulls come out and brag. If it drops a bit bears come out and brag...

Better set a trailing stop just to be sure.
Yesterday I checked the last few months price action for hidden bullish divergence on the 2-4 hour RSI.  I couldn't find an example that didn't result in a higher high.

As it stands it looks like that divergence is to have confirmed on our most recent dip and bounce.

Can anyone else chime in on this? As I'm far from an expert

Edit: might be worth checking the 2015 data, to confirm this theory in a similar trend.
As per usual, one really knows. There’s the whole 6th day of the month shenanigans that’s getting people excited for a pump, but no clear objective indicator of which way it we’re headed just yet. A lot of comments are talking about price stability and predicting no clear sentiment change for the next few weeks.

If you want a rundown on the partial daily, I found this comment below: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ontzj/comment/e05qpp3?st=JI22D694&sh=160111b2
Where is your long from? There isn't much incentive to close your long here. The market hasn't really picked a direction, and it won't until it's over 7900 or under 7K, basically. If your long is from down below (under 7400), I'd hold it. If I had a short from >7700, I'd hold that too. 7450-7600 is basically just a bad area to trade. 

edit: also depends if you prefer to take decent wins or swing for the fences. You could always close 50% of it. 
If I were you I wouldn't be looking for a long term long until the market decides WTF direction it wants to go. It seems to want to go down but the bulls are not giving up easily. The problem with this is if it's largely traders trying to catch the falling knife on the spot exchanges it could get really ugly if it gets prolonged . If your in profit and long secure them. Then again I am bearish but I have since we broke the 20K parabola. 5Ks been my target for a long time before reevaluating but it's taking a long time to get there but it seems like it will.
If anything, it looks more like an ascending channel than an ascending triangle. I’m not sure I trust those two points of contact on the top considering the first point was on the way down.
Your purple line looks arbitrary...
Not trying to shill, but I'm 99&#37; sure this is because of their partnership with Quoine's Worldbook (an aggregator of exchange orderbooks / liquidity). They have been doing testing around this time in preparation for June go\-live, and given they are a Japanese company, the BTC / JPY volume would make sense.
You can turn it off under preferences > personalization options > beta options
you can switch back to the old
Hmm. I personally like it.
You can easily switch to the old one... should be a button in your upper right hand corner of your browser.

You should probably step away from trading if you're getting that upset about a social website's style changes...
Have you tried backtesting that? 
Whenever the debate of "do traders who employ TA actually have any clue what they're doing" comes up, I generally draw parallels to predicting the weather. 

When the weather reporter hops in front of a green screen and starts throwing out projections for temperature, precipitation, and expected wind speeds, he/she is merely making educated guesses based on the available data. 

When a confluence of factors collide, they can confidently predict that it's probably going to rain. Or it's probably going to be sunny. But that doesn't mean it's always going to rain when they think it will, or be as hot as they projected it would be. 

The same is true for technical analysis as it applies to bitcoin (or any market). 

Nobody can tell you with any real certainty that the market is going to bounce when it drops 5% instead of continuing to drop an additional 5%. But there are technical indicators that many traders look to that they feel can help increase their confidence level that might occur. 

You are entitled to write those indicators off as voodoo or tea leaves, but by and large they're just visual representations of data. Moving Averages are just that: price averages spread out over time. 

RSI is nothing more than a way to track upward and downward momentum over time. 

Trend lines are merely visualizations of a shared reality of the market: the price is trending up, or the price is trending down. 

If you're looking for Technical Analysis to **predict** upcoming movements with 100% accuracy (or even 70% accuracy), you're going to be sorely disappointed. 

But, I for one find it to be incredibly helpful for helping to manage risk. If x happens, then I'd expect y to follow. If z happens instead, then I need to reevaluate. But if y does, in fact, follow, then the trade becomes profitable. 

 


The market is in range mode atm. Anyone buying below 7350 and selling above 7550 has made good money for the past 2 weeks.
Pretty much, intituition serves the same purpose but it has to be coupled with a good risk management. 

Matter of taste, some like charts and some not. Results probably are not different over the long run. Patterns just are something that humans are wired to look for. 

In my opinion, in TA You are basically guessing who else are looking the same patterns and metrics, and if it's a majority, its probably a good follow (if you can get ahead of major move). But there are just too many patterns that can be drawn at any moment in time.

I only look major multi month lines and the rest is intuition.
Still the fifth in America, and meme magic is the most powerful here. Have patience.

^^^(lol)
While I don't blame anyone secretly hoping for a reversal due to the date pattern, it's almost quite literally astrology at that point...


And it has neither dumped or pumped. I was told there was going to be a pump or dump
I’m coingurruu, and i agree with this statement ( maybe  a little lower and not 12h but soon) 
let’s break 7.7k first okay? please. please?
That could be one 15-minute BGD. We could go much higher. Depends on how much the CBOE boys need to buy back. Seems like that's what happens. This time their little dump got bought up a bit more than they expected, it seems. Quite a pickle.
Keep on dreaming, sub 7K test is more likely.
It’s gonna be another consensus
Can we go for six days in a row? Stay tuned for the next fractal coming near you.
Yeah that was most likely one long closing and going short if you look at lower timeframes
This is going to be my strategy moving forward. Aside from putting a tiny sums of BTC in micro and low cap coins as pure 100% gamble, with BTC and mid and large cap alts, I'm going to take profit and buy dips, repeat and rinse. No more fomoing into moon missions. I've lost much more unrealized gains than realized gains getting too greedy and chasing the moon gains when I was already up 30-40%
> All my trades except for one has been successful on BTC/USD since beginning of May, buying every dip and closing out in profit.

Damn dude, you are smarter than I.  Good job with all that.
Bots have maintenance time too!
i cant tell if you guys are serious or not with this 6th thing
Happened with BTC and ETH too just not as extreme
It would be less risky to wait for a break of the resistance line of the wedge IMO. The wedge looks suspect as it is.

The site is down for "maintenance"

The extreme long run. For many years to come the prices people will be paying will be defined by the psychos on exchanges.

This doesn't look like increased adoption for BTC since December.
This is likely because LBC is now doing KYC.  When Paxful is forced to do the same, its usage will drop

>  More people using Bitcoin means a higher price per Bitcoin in the long run does it not? 

It does to me, but not to many people who say Bitcoin bans in China and India were good, or at least not bad for Bitcoin..
Just the bear whales trying to do their thing. 
Markets weird lately. Seems like we're all just waiting for some dude with 1k btc to move the market.

~~Interestingly, that wasn't shorts opening or longs closing, just 1k actual btc being sold~~

edit: likely incorrect 
Run the price up on low volume so people place bids, then when you are satisfied with the amount of bids at a certain price, you sell into them with little slippage.
[deleted]
You call that a plunge?

I don't know why anyone thinks this is going down at this point.  Seems pretty clear that the bottom is in.  I'm leaving my limit buy open at 7100, but seems I'm not going to get that lucky.
the market and the order books are manipulated as hell, dont try to understand it
Bellow the current minimum. 7345 at least. 

If i was confident about the position i might risk 1% or so, if not i would set it at breakeven (or a bit below in this case since we are near the minimum value). 

I'm also toying with the idea to add to my long.

I'd probably say set a stop at 7249 as I don't think it's out of the question we'll try to see if support holds there. If that falls we'll take the express to the bottom of the triangle @ 7k, and I'm not too sure if it'll hold then as both fractal target + bearflag target are around 6.5k-6.7k-ish. 

yesterday I was quite confident 7350 would hold and would provide a good entry, though I'm becoming a little more cautious today. As most are saying, this is a bit of a tough zone to trade, but I think a bit more bounce is a decent expectation, but it's imperative you don't get greedy in this position. 
[https://imgur.com/a/cVLX8eQ](https://imgur.com/a/cVLX8eQ)

I may draw the support slightly different than everyone else \- I like to draw it starting from the November low to show that the line has confluence with that crash as well as the September top. It probably amounts to at most a \~$150 difference compared to drawing it with only the recent lows.
I want to believe this is a recovery, I really really do. But I just can't convince myself that it is on such low volume. 

I'll be keeping a very close eye on it though
Didn't you sell all your BTC yesterday or the day before? Don't be flotsam carried by waves of sentiment or emotion. We could absolutely drop through the floor of our pennant still. We also could climb. The concerns remain, as does the potential. Until we clear our pennant one way or another, it's all just a lot of market noise. 
"If we can break above 7800 after the type of price action we have had over the past few days we are definitely in the beginning stages of a new bull market."

How so? People were also saying that on the rise from $6.8k to $9.8k to use one example.
Any particular reason?
Wondering the same. I’m short from 7530. 
GBTC in my Roth has been pretty much the best thing ever.  That's the only way I know of to play BTC in the traditional markets at present, except for the Chicago futures stuff.
Congrats on your trade (really). You might want to make some friends here, to comfort you when you inevitably get rekt, although I don't wish it to you. Because you sound like you trade with your gut feeling :)
Also you don't seem an experienced trader judging by your attitude. You might learn something, albeit basic, here. I'd be grateful.

Enjoy the pump.

In all honestly it's the type of volume Stuart Little could put out!
Ok just came home and now I see on tradingview the volume lol
No it isn't always too soon to call.  It wasn't too soon to call a bull market in Nov of last year.

do we even know if there is an OTC shorting capability? 
[deleted]
Let's see that screenshot. 30x Short @ 7,620, 60% of your trading stack.
Or we have infact "triple bottomed" for the time being and revisit the upper triangle area. We don't know. 
I'm watching too, but man...a $30 movement is not a bart. We've got to be more intentional on what we consider a significant movement.

That said, if we drop below 7350 before BFX comes back, I'd expect a fairly hefty drop. 
That actually does seem pretty likely to me. This might cause a dump this time. Then again, last time things were ok
It will be interesting to see what happens when you cut off the market's majority share of gamblers
Funny. Fireworks is what they used as an emoji to describe what's about to go down.
I like how few points the lower line touches and how the top one just cuts right on through candles.
if we're going to talk about squeezes we should talk about the alt long squeeze thats coming up. I've come to realise this market is now driven by dumping and pumping bitcoin in order to squeeze margin positions on alts. Its way more profitable than anything else I'd imagine...Just look how we squeezed a 40k eth short the past week, when we finished squeezing him we turned around and went down instantly.   
Next up: 12.7 million EOS longs
Is there a reason you think a short squeeze is coming?Is there a major exchange with an outsize number of short positions? 
I highly doubt a short squeeze is coming. And even if one does come we'll go up *at most* 200 dollars. 

Edit: And I just want to clarify this doesn't mean we can't bounce here. Just that the cause won't be because of a short squeeze. A short squeeze happens when they liquidate into each other and push the price up. Unless they are massively overleveraged, most people will probably hold onto their underwater shorts for quite awhile.
Yes, keep down\-voting and short selling... thank you!
I agree with you... time to get Up again... But unfortunately  it looks like some... like it more down. Let's see. ( I'm on the buying side - Add )
I need to look at some of these charts next time I drop acid
> where they will no longer be available for shorting. Starting to look like the latter.

Based on what? Your best guess?
Upvoted. Thank you for making me laugh.
It hasn't been in the 10k's for w while now, except on huge move days. It's been as low as 3.5k recently IIRC. 5500 is just medium. (shit compared to the competitors) 
gdax isn't doing well on volume, look at bitfinex for a better indicator 
Yeah keeping the price under 1k sure worked for you guys. Bet that level of sustainability feels amazing! 
He probably has time for that.

I think this is a fake out. A lot of people are buying into the previous trend if bottoming out or topping off on the 6th of every month. Tomorrow would be our reversal if true and I think enough people have cought on to the point where bears can easily take advantage of all the reversal hype, which is what we might be seeing here.
Didn't you flip out, decry bitcoin and say that you were out of this scam no more than 12 hours ago?
Could be. A bull market return can strike at any time.

You never know with BTC / Crypto
Claiming a DDoS. That's interesting. 
Remember when bitmex went down and the price dumped hard, maybe they are trying to trigger something. 
Alright. So what do you think about my reply to you regarding accumulation? Was waiting for a reply. :\)

Define "significant decline."
Yeah! I'm going to send even MORE money to nex during a DDoS attack just to show you!
this is why I like frequenting this sub.

thank you!
Too early to call that. Zoom out to the weekly, there's a lot of different ways this could go as we're still early in the next parabola following a violation of a parabolic advance. [https://imgur.com/a/WzZYmRd](https://imgur.com/a/WzZYmRd)

Sure, this time maybe it is a very short parabola, but turning a blind eye to other possibilities isn't very smart.

As an example of \*why\* you're extrapolating based on too little information here, let's look at September of 2014. Keep in mind this is actually 4 months MORE data post bubble pop than we have now. Look at the "wave" you might have drawn then: [https://imgur.com/a/hZtd69k](https://imgur.com/a/hZtd69k)

Now, let's zoom out and see how that wave would have ended up projecting: [https://imgur.com/a/YeDlJWJ](https://imgur.com/a/YeDlJWJ)

I don't see where he is bragging. Just posting his trade that some appreciate to see. Go play hide and be butt hurt about your losing position somewhere else if you don't like it. 
I definitely don't pay much attention to FUD. In this particular case, I don't necessarily see how a DDos attack on an exchange is inherently bearish. 

Even if I subscribed to the various market manipulation tin foil hat theories out there, a DDos attack on an exchange could just as easily preempt a pump as a dump. 

1. DDos attack exchange A
2. Buy all ze coins on exchanges B, C, and D (that have lower liquidity than Finex)
3. Cease DDos attack
4. ???
5. Profit
i think this *might* be the bottom. market is getting tired of FUD.
Seems you already got stopped out, but the answer to your question would have been, "no, not *just above*. 

$7,500+ would be the appropriate spot for a stop loss on an existing short:

https://imgur.com/a/mn3Zhes

That avoids the possibility of getting bounced out prematurely on a wick above short-term-support-turned-resistance, but ensures you get out of the way if the market makes a more substantial reversal above $7,480 or so.
Sometimes, I'd rather just close a position with a limit order right away instead of risking my stop loss getting hit and incurring taker fees.

I have us above by a lot 

In general this entire area just blows for trading 
I have 2 versions, one with cut wicks one without, and we've been bouncing between them.
Yep. We went below this line last night according to my artistic drawing skills, respecting wicks.
yeah I had it a bit above.. But I'll trust chewy on this one
I don't expect them to, but there's a relatively strong argument that the market is building up to at least test the top of the parallel triangle that's been forming for the past few months:

https://imgur.com/a/4QcA4pj

That could push price to as high as around $9,200 if it were to happen today. Or potentially a bit lower if it takes a few weeks to pump that high.

Personally, I'm not especially confident in any short-term outcome. While there's technically support just below current price, there also hasn't been any strong indication that buyers are ready (or willing) to continue to push this higher.

Right now is a good spot to "wait and see."
Personally I think people are overreacting a bit.
It's closer to 60% of the time. 

Though the important statistic when gauging my — or anyone's — performance is the % gains vs % losses. 

While it can be frustrating to follow somebody who takes nine, 1% losses in a row followed by one 15% gain, you're still very much in the green despite following somebody who only has a 10% success rate. 
I'll always contend that the hardest element of being a successful trader is taking profit. 

It's one thing to know when to take profit. It's another entirely to actually do so. 
I don't really pay much attention to clouds. 

I will say that MA is a bit concerning on the 6h and 12h, but it wouldn't take much for the 6h to cross back up and for the 12h to avoid a bearish cross altogether. 

3D MACD is potentially troublesome, but it's a similar situation to MA on lower timeframes: it could cross back up without warning. 
Oh damn, dude. That is brutal. 
Damn dude.. I have a decently lev short from the high 7Ks and that comment made me go check that position damn quick. That position could possibly may have been one to hold onto until settlement...
It means market buys on June futures on BitMEX wiped through over $300 of orderbook liquidity. I don't know that's it's good or bad, exactly, except that someone got absolutely boned on slippage. 
I managed to get a non-post-only limit order entered at 7850 when the engine was displaying 7880, but it didn't execute. Hammy the Hamster's tiny heart exploded on that. 
In what world, a rational one where a 10 year old stateless currency is worth more than the GDP of entire nations?
Yes and I doubt the whales bought at 7200 to sell at 7600 again.
He's talking about redistribution, not distribution. There can be many periods of redistribution within a downtrend just as there can be periods of reaccumulation in an uptrend.
Additional observation: a symmetrical triangle is expected to break up or down between 1/2 & 3/4 of the way from the first top contact point \(top left corner\) and the line convergence. Then it should move to 'continue the trend'. 3 touch points on top and 3 touch points on bottom, the triangle is fairly 'perfect' in appearance, along with the diminishing volume which is an expected characteristic. A symmetrical triangle isn't a bull/bear signal by itself though.

Ignoring where I've played with drawing trend channels \(a symmetrical triangle 'continues trend' which there's arguments for both camps\) you'll see this means we should expect some sort of trend continuation imminently.
yeah that was my first assumption as well. It's clear a lot of people are expecting this so maybe it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
True true. I'm also looking at this:

Yeah, I've been drawing a new TL from the high on 9-May (~9393) instead since it just made a 3rd contact point a couple of days ago.
It was only abominable if you were short or sitting on the sidelines, just like the next one will be.
I'm looking at BBand width crossing down below RSI. There are periods where it crosses with high RSI. I'm looking at periods where weekly RSI is at or below our current level.
I think you'll see similarly unlikely events in the projected periods. Triple bottoms, and breaking sideways through symmetric triangles...   Price stability as described is extremely rare for Bitcoin. If it happens then it should break TA rules as a matter of course.
Miners are also getting faster so 10x difficulty doesn't necessarily mean 10x price.
Saved. Thank you.
Basically, the RSI calculation isn't dead simple because its value depends somewhat on two different components of the previous value. Ballparking it can be done just with an eye test and estimating it slightly better can be done with some effort put into calculations, but actually calculating it requires going a long ways back and then calculating each successive Average gain and Average loss value until you get to the current candle.

To do the estimate, do the following: calculate last period's RS value based on its RSI: 100 / RSI \- 1 = RS

Now, RS value = Avg Gain (AG)  / Avg Loss (AL). From now on, those are AG^(prev) and AL^(prev), the ratio will be RS^(prev). Let's say you want to calculate the next RSI if the price rose X bucks in the current period. You need to calculate the next RS value (the divide by 14s cancel):

((AG^(prev) x 13) \+ X)

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- = RS^(new)

AL^(prev) x 13

Which reduces to:

RS^(prev)  \+ X / (AL^(prev) \* 13) = RS^(new)

Now the issue here is you only know the previous RS val and X, you don't know the magnitude of AL^(prev). You can estimate that by going back and averaging the down periods from the last 14 or so candles (ignoring the green candles). It won't be exact, but it'll be good enough. Then you can calculate the new RS value based on that last equation and then the new RSI based on RSI = 100 \- 100 / (1 \+ RS).

You'll have slightly more intense algebra to do if you wanted to calculate the new RS value based on the price falling. I believe the expression (did it quickly it may have an error) becomes:

RS^(prev) x 13 x AL^(prev) / (AL^(prev) x 13 \+ X) = RS^(new) where X is the amount the price falls.

If you wanted to do the reverse, calculating price when RSI is at a certain value, it's more estimating and more computationally expensive to do it more than one candle out and the effects of estimation are compounded. For that single candle, though, you can just sub in 100 / RSI \- 1 for RS^(new), pick a value of RSI you want, calculate X, and subtract/add X to the previous candle's close.

Yes, you're right.  The most recent "Death Cross" resulted in us going up to kiss the 200.

Edit: just checked the 2014 chart and the same thing happened then too...
Seems like a good play honestly.
Timing !! 
It's a BTC 3day inverted chart
It's a BTC inverted chart
Very little explanation by OP. I haven’t had my morning coffee. But if it’s 1/BTC it looks like this chart is bearish af because we’ve pierced the bottom boundary of cloud and edge to edge cloud movement is possible?  

Edit: oh perhaps he is suggesting bottom maybe based on cloud rejection 
That's my read. That chart actually looks bullish. It may be able to pull back a little before breaking resistance but when it does theres not much but open air for about 2K
Cloud is complicated. The breakout is usually a cross, cloud breakout wait for a pullback to one of your ichi levels like the cloud or TK for your entry.  Cross has different meaning below above and during the cloud as well as the lagging line that I think is removed from the indicator at the moment. Thats a 3D inverted BTC chart through the cloud would take us around 3K Jun-Jul last year time (thats when the 3D may give you an Ichi short lmao)
It helps eliminate bias. Bitcoin has a history of trending upward so it's easy to get complacent 
I got a 502(server error I think)? Thats unusual. I gotta get to bed... Here's a 3D side by side of the last 1 year on the Ichi if your interested.

> So I just put my money into crypto and I'll be rich in five years?

Just so you know this is exactly what happened to many of us. And yeah you think you are late to the party now, but you should've seen what the landscape looked like after the mt gox implosion we were the laughing stock and everything was gloomy for not just months but years you didn't feel like someone who's late to the party but rather an actual fool, and then...
[deleted]
> pump and dumps to squeeze every last dollar out of retail before the bubble truly bursts.

> Yeah. Nah. I'm not that stupid. I can recognize when I'm late to the party. When rando-s who have 0 idea how bitcoin/cryptocurrencies works are throwing $20k+ into it, it's time to seriously consider getting out

This was totally true when we were at 15k+ on the way up, with Korea running up premiums to 50% and all that insanity. Now? Ehhh... If anything, if you're "considering getting out" *now*, you're probably late to the party again (the getting out party). 
Where I differ in this opinion, and where I think you are wrong, is that we are not late to the party. We are still incredibly early on the timescale of adoption of digital currency, which I, and many others believe, is the future of money.

Those idiots you are speaking of buying altcoins and buying the dips, in my opinion are not only few and far between, comprising a tiny percentage of the population, but they’re actually astute early adopters, rather than the morons you see them as. The 50 year old man who doesn’t know what crypto even is and refuses to entertain a different kind of currency is the moron, these dip buyers are taking a smart forward thinking risk on a future tech.

You’re very pessimistic in general, but I hope this works out for all of us regardless.

Don’t get out yet, we haven’t even started.
You just sound skeptical to me and I think that's good if you are a trader. Not drinking the kool-aid might save you from committing to a bad long term position. If it succeeds great, if it doesn't oh well. Let's go trade fx futures then.
I think no one believes that the little guy can get rich with bitcoin anymore the insane gains periods is gone , that doesn’t mean we can’t have a nice bull run 
> When has any get rich in 5 years scheme ever worked for the little guy? Why do people suddenly think this is it? That this will be the saving grace for anyone who just puts enough money in and waits?

Ummm, care to look at the charts again? We're 800%+ since 2013... Anyone with a little bit of skin in the game since 2013 is making out like a bandit.
This is actually largely accurate, I believe anyway. 

I can't imagine a situation where this doesn't end in a spectacular crash of sorts in the not too distant future, not as catastrophic for BTC perhaps, but definitely for alts. 

We have a market made up of thousands of shit coins with no purpose and no real world acceptance. The majority of the alt market is the greater fools theory in action. One day we will run out of fools. 

But things aren't exactly that much better for BTC, its value is still derived from speculation alone and interest is without doubt dropping or stagnating as we stand. When that happens in a purely speculative market it's clear to see what is likely to happen next.
Maybe not rich but those who buy at these levels won’t complain if we break ath and the great beyond  
Deserves upvoted. Quality post. I agree with the general logic, most likely true. GOOD SHIT RIGHT HERE EVERYONE SHOULD READ AND CONSIDER!
Having bad trades recently? You sound bitter and capitulated. I think this is a bullish sign, buy buy buy!
It worked for many of us, and it will continue to work for people who aren't so bogged down by pessimism to see where the future is headed. I wonder who hurt you.

Somehow you've been able to short the market for 5 months straight. Sounds like easy money to me. 2017? Hold your hat out, greenbacks are falling from the sky. Did you catch any? Sorry if you missed out.

This market will continue to defy rationality for years to come. Folks like you, convinced that tasty=poison, will sit on the sidelines in contempt. I imagine in the 60's we could find you in Florida lambasting all the naive plebs who had the audacity/delusion to think we could put a man on the Moon.

Different era, different Moon. 

Quick question: Do you actually participate in the industry, or just hunt opportunity looking to get rich? Have you ever spoken to a developer/attended a conference in person?  
> 2014 saw merchants starting accepting Bitcoin for the first time, good regulatory news, etc but it didn't stop the price decline.

Maybe that had just a little something to do with the hundreds of thousands of stolen Bitcoin being dumped into the market daily while everyone else was wondering whether other exchanges are really worth trusting their money with after what happened to MtGox. 
If you actually move the purple line higher in correlation with the high wicks from the $7800 attempts, it draws out to be a **Ascending Triangle Reversal Pattern** 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/cUZPgWMr/

Which is a bullish trend reversal pattern. Our volume also hasn’t dropped off and is pretty steady. If this triangle broke up it should put us at a target of $8200 at some point in the coming weeks. 
I wish I'd taken some down at 7380, but I was a bit preoccupied at the time and then we spiked back over 7400. It would have been a solid win even down where /u/v4mpyre close (7410), but I hesitated. We'll see if it holds as resistance. 

Seems like you've had a good trade thus far--well done. 
I market closed at 7498. Thank god for futures lag. My exit bled from 7498-7505.

CME / CBOE made precious metals their b!+(4. It's almost like it's their job. But they've met their match in Bitcoin. They won't be able to keep it down for long.
Will you open a position on the 5th next month though?
Basically he is suggesting that btc price goes from 6th to 5th of following month.  Then it reverses from 6th to 5th of next month and falls.  Then another reversal again, rinse and repeat for going on 6 months.

So he is saying June is scheduled to be a bullish month whereas July would be bearish, followed by August bull.

It would suggest this is a good zone to buy before a swing up . . also a FIB retrace point from our recent low to the May 5 high lines up perfectly with the April 12 BGD . . here . . https://www.tradingview.com/x/OjHz79EQ/

Edit: Does add to this 77xx level as resistance turned support.
Your welcome.
Hah . . I'm parallel channel challenged ;)
Have not seen it mentioned. I don't live here.
I know I made it a bit too quick. It's because I have written most things down but it's way too messy to chart with all the cycles and boxes. Some cycles end up flat and at the same price point. The duration is not the same for all them either.  For example the cycle between 12/3 and 5/5 is about 60 days and ends up flat \(9.8k\). I only included retests that were important for the overall structure. 8.5k isn't such a level, it doesn't matter if it breaks because there's nothing on top of it, it wasn't very important in the uptrend either, there's no sideways movement, it blasted through. 7.8k and 8.8k are way more important.    
BIG 
I don't doubt it no, but the market doesn't always do what it signals. I'm fine either way.
Look up Martin Armstrong and his work on cycles \(cycles are sine waves, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine\_wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave) \) and Jason Jenkins on YouTube if you want to know where I have my model from including PI \(It isn't a thing because he 'invented it'. He's by far the best trader I know.
I was actually considering closing it all morning, but when BFX went down I held our a little longer. 

His decision to close definitely pushed me a little more, but recently I’ve been making my own trades instead of following others and have been doing well.

It was an all around bad trade as I was away from market for 4 days and opened just on the fact we broke back into channel, only to jump back out. 
Pretty content with closing lol 
Finex leads/controls the price for the most exchanges, a small - medium size whale can now manipulate the price on whatever medium-small exchange they are trading on as if they were a much bigger whale.

edit: Also, it takes less resources than you might think. Similarly to the 51% attacks that have been happening lately, the costs are negligible compared to the potential gains.
drive traffic off bitfinex and to other exchanges?
> That sounds like it would take some resources. Why would anyone do that? What would they have to gain?

Way way less than you'd think. A load testing service costs a couple hundred bucks per month and that's essentially the same as ddosing a site (less distributed of course). You could probably rent a botnet for like a hundred bucks for a day
FUD price down to grab few more coins before inevitable 6th day of the month pump starts tomorrow.
Thanks \- appreciate the help. 
Actually, I've spent the weekend with Stacey browsing through offers of family lambos wondering what we should buy when this glorious bull market gets rolling.
Wisdom of the crowd and all that.
What is the prize for the correct prediction?
But it’s already lower, no?
How dare you claim Bitcoin will ever be over 10k again, bring on the downvotes! 

rofl this is amazing
I'm not saying I disagree with you but people are going to ask for justification for these numbers.
Uhmm...
Hope i can Catch that Top....
What’s the significance of the 6th?
Where's your big short at then
Generally when I have a great position and I more at a significantly higher or lower price, it bites me in the ass.
I’m long from $7472 but never posted it. It’s a small position but I think we may knock on 7.8k’s doors again. 

We posted a higher low on 4H and seems like we have established some possible ascending support line even though it’s 2 points of contact. ( red ) 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/PuXuwqVu/

We are also hitting this $7650ish horizontal resistance line ( purple) we have been battling with for 2 weeks. 

This area between 8450-8650 ish is a no trade zone. You could flip a coin right here and go long with stops under $7575 which I’m considering and if i get stopped I’ll still be in profit from my $7472 long. Or you could go short with stops of $7700.

Otherwise, scaling into a short from $7700-$7800 is a smart play with stops of $7900. Or longing over $7800 when blasted through and tested again. 
same for me. I still believe this all ends with a horrible capitulation phase, the ol disbelief time period where a lot of people are just completely fed up and done with it. 

For me it seems highly likely that 6k will be broken, so the question then is at what price will the pain really hit people. Is it going to be in the 4ks or will it have to go lower for that to happen?

I kinda feel the 4k range is the bottom but perhaps not I mean if this bear market continues for another 5 to 6 months then fuck knows where we'll end up.
agreed, it could just spring out of nowhere but the trends and TA on all decent time frames, so anything over 1 to 2hr charts is just looking shit. 

The trend is still down, the weekly chart shows absolutely nothing at all to suggest anything other than weeks and weeks or more downside. 


Yeah haha, it's currently pumped right back to where Finex was anyway. So maybe nobody will be grumpy!
Haha, well, let's hope it stops at just déjà vu
Funny to start seeing the price on each exchange diverging from each other in a disorderly way without the arbitrage.
True, and you can also recon that with taking away 30&#37; volume, erratic movements can happen with smaller trades.
For the same reason somebody might wait in traffic for an additional 20 minutes to see if it clears up before getting off the highway and turning around. 

While it's true that there is a 100% chance you will arrive at your destination 20 minutes later if traffic **doesn't** clear up, you might arrive at your destination an hour sooner if traffic **does** clear up. 

This pump is promising, but it's still quite risky to hop into a long below $7,800. 

While the reward is lower for an entry at $7,900 vs $7,600, the risk is also considerably lower provided the market respects horizontal resistance as support once $7,800 breaks up.
You assume the price will keep rising...
because he thinks people will think and act like he does and he can avoid an unnecessary loss if it doesn't play out that way 
momentum in what form?  RSI, srsi, macd, etc?
Curious why I get downvoted. The butthurting is real in this sub. Did we go straight to the moon after breaking the 20 to 11.7 resistance? No, the bear kept going.
Yeah, well trade before that one was definitely a - Peter Luger. But I'm planning on at least taking a couple of burgers from shake shack after a move.
Yeah, I saw /u/veltrop on the bot taking profits a few times and kept thinking if I should as well. I got my asnwer though.
I think that the bot didn't pick my position close.
Trying again.

!short xbtusd close 7620
I think it also varies on and to a point heavily relies on people who are not trading and just speculating but want running commentary. I wonder how many subscribers have made more than 1 comment a week/month (that would make a nice little python project actually) and are only subbed because they want to be told the the price is in fact going to continue going up or is in fact bottoming out (although I'm going to guess we're going to have less viewers when we bottom than when we topped). So I'm going to lean on the emotional side I think from what I've seen at the extremes of the bubbles. 
I mean yes it is but it also tends to get much worse as the sub gets bigger and becomes more of an echo chamber. Although it can be an echo chamber at times I don't think it's so big that rational contrarian thinking is totally buried in downvotes, at least not yet.
Could be... I imagine big traders have armies of bots to spread news whether good or not to try and shill their positions and this probably includes a few posts on the more popular forums. I imagine a lot of the big players are literal high level hacker so fuckery is to be expected, thats not to say it will always work out for them though. Rule number 1 to not getting rekt 'you are not the trend'.
Ye you do get totally rational posts that go to -20 and then rebound as soon as a correction starts all because it was bearish. When you see a huge number of downvotes quickly on a good post it's usually a really good sign to consider taking that position especially if it's from someone who knows what they are talking about and have some sort of reputation in this community.
You have this reverse.
Hey Chewy,

Let's suppose you fucked up on taking profit with kraken, doubled the order and went 5X short, 33% of stack right before our recent pump, 7425.  Would you close now or try to wait it out?  Asking for a friend :)
Plan on shorting at any particular price point?
*Overbought
because we painted a pretty flat line from around 08:00 to 15:00 and it broke upwards 
It is EASY to comment on all posts and not give your own thoughts on the price. I noticed that you only give comments on Posts and not post anything new. You Just reply with ( you think ) wise words…. Which are for a lot here are already obvious. 

It’s already pumping..
It wicked down to 7028ish on Bitstamp daily on 5/29. This pattern is not touches on 6th dates.
why?
Why?
Hwyy
Any thoughts on the likelihood whether it was an attempt to trigger a short squeeze?
How do you explain Massey Universitys comprehensive study into TA, showing it gives results highly comparable to random chance, ie random guessing? 
>2014 bear market was due to the main exchange which accounted for 70% of bitcoin volume being hacked in a massive amount of bitcoins losing clients bitcoins and making everyone lose complete confidence in bitcoin.

I would argue that the loss of confidence was due to the revelation that MtGox was pumping the price to that level, Willie & Markus Bots had purchased over 250k bitcoins and were criminally negligent with user funds. Without those bots to artificially sustain the price, we saw a bear market. 
lol wtf?
That's just what a sentiment manipulator would say.
true.
Sure and there are many people here that have maintained their bullish sentiment for quite some time now. The people being over the top are the permabears who cry 3k every time we dump 150 dollars. It goes both ways. You believe you are right, so therefore the other side are the ones that are being over the top. I'm sure they see it the same way against you. The biggest logical fallacy is trying to predict and do TA on this low volume and highly manipulated market. Nobody knows what it's going to do, it can go up, it can go down, it can go sideways, it can fucking go backwards and do squiggly lines. Nobody knows shit. I personally think the market has been indecisive since Feb and I've been neutral for the medium term.
Bulls will take whatever they can get.  They are desperate at this point.
Can somebody eli5 this whole "6th theory" for an old fart out of the loop?
Now that it has already bounced at 7370ish, I guess no need to bet long anymore
It's the ATH to 10k resistance line. 

I personally don't think it very significant. 


i think he might be extrapolating a continuation line out of our current short-term uptrend channel to where he thinks it will hit the long-term resistance line. doing that, i could see about ~$8500
Finex, but your line is much more accurate. My line is drawn from the 20k peak, more for 1w eye candy.
if you draw it on the monthly it makes sense
Yes, I miss my real bitcoin... it's been too long. 
Yup I agree 
Went back and checked, found a few examples of it in 2015\-2016. Didn't look for very long or very closely though.

But you're right, it seems to be a pretty rare phenomena to not make a higher high than the one directly before the dip. Part of that might be that legitimate hidden bull divs on 4 hrs with clean/clear local lows don't occur *terribly* often. But it's definitely happened historically.

Side note, holy shit it's annoying looking for divs on those old charts. SO much noise due to low liquidity.
March beginnin 4h right after getting rejected by 100 period MA, funnily we just got rejected from that moving average too
My most recent long was at 7544 which I’ve held for a while now.  I see people talking about triple bottoms and maybe we finally bottomed in the low 7’s.  The low volume and general low interest has me confused on bitcoin’s next move. 
I agree, that first contact is a bit iffy. 
Yea ideally you would have wanted the first point of contact to come after a bottom was made.

Just something to keep an eye on in the near future
Sure there is a wick cut off by .3 millimeters but i drew it straight across from the first wick. I didnt draw it to “ fit my narrative”

That's not necessarily true. I would extend a lot more suspension of belief to the idea that human-driven markets oscillate on a monthly basis than I would to astrology.

What make you think we are headed to sub 7k? 
Dreams are all they have.  Look at the chart.
Based on what we've seen in 2018, this is a smart and good strategy, but knowing the history of crypto I think you are going to get burned.  I read somewhere that if you took 10 green days away from 2017 you would be in the red for the year.  That's 10 days out of 365 making all the profits.  This market isn't rational, and you could miss a massive pump waiting for it to fall back to your dips.   
Iol
ppl really believe that stuff man
Now that the pattern is well known, I wouldn't bet that it happens again. 
As soon as something like that becomes common knowledge it’s over 
It's kinda just a weird conspiracy/ mah manipulation thing. But the charts don't lie, this did indeed happen for the past few months it seems. Not sure if it's coincidence or someone is dumping and pumping strategically. Who knows.
Thank you thank you
Thanks man
I think he meant that the MACD is gaining momentum. It was flatlined earlier today, suggesting that the buying pressure has lost momentum. It’s now curving up again so it definitely looks like bulls can push this further.
Yes, I meant there is a noticeable up-trend for now at least.
Definitely see the bear case. Not bullish at the moment, sitting out.
I don't think this takes into account batching, which has increased greatly on Bitcoin network since Segwit activation, whereas I believe eth is almost always 1 tx per recipient. Switch to the amount of $ being sent rather than # of txs, still crashes hard in January, but less hard and BTC stays well above eth.
https://coin.dance/volume/localbitcoins/USD is looking fairly bullish imho as well...

It's not like adoption of LBC fell off a steep cliff of any kind at least.


Nearly 2k on finex traded hands in that 5m candle. Got eaten up pretty well considering.
> just 1k actual btc being sold

How do you know?
Generally when volume decreases to a standstill (I'm watching GDAX) it seems that the next move is a violent down of a couple percent. You think thats more common than a green ?
moved 70 originally on a market sell then got eaten up
Was he taken out?
Thank you very much. I appreciate it!
I'm really impressed we managed to break 7600 on the first try with such low volume. I've stopped looking at volume so much though as I think there's only very few weak hands left, and without fundamentals changing, there's no need for any capitulation to take place to validate a price rise. Instead I'm viewing it more as seller exhaustion at that price level. (i.e. weak resistance of 7600.)
The volume indicators like OBV and CMF are calling BS too.
Is the volume really that low? How does it compare to this time last year, and how does it compare to what we'd expect to see from that vantage point?
He was faking capitulating as part of an intricate psychological strategy to trick bears into thinking bulls have capitulated:

We Have to Go to War With Bears: a post by Olesentv

> They are playing dirty. If you hold Bitcoin and say and do nothing while you lose money you let them cost you money. Bulls have to fight back. Even if it's 20 dollars on Coinbase pick up a little bit extra. It only requires stopping the momentum a little bit here.

>They are going to be all over this thread. They want so badly to knock this price down. We can stop it. I've moved 10 percent of my alts into Bitcoin.

>That goes a long way to messing up the bots trading because they are targeting different ratios at different prices on the alts. That causes them to buy into the alts to keep the ratios at historic levels because they see the price "out of balance. The new demand for btc causes the price of btc to increase (if done on a large enough scale). The increase in the btc price causes the ratio to become out of balance and the bots to buy the alts to keep it in balance.

>The key is to move 10 percent out of alts to get most of the gains from the increase in alts when the price of btc goes up.

>Almost all negative posts on here are planned FUD. The manipulation is that extreme.

A most noble cause, but I'm not sure it's effective. It sounds like he's out of money to buy the dips and is resorting to more indirect, complex strategies to save bitcoin. 

He's genuinely suggesting people throw in $20 here and there to stop people from selling. -_-

Essentially a very long "please buy sirs" 
he admitted to trolling
We’ve been trading sideways for a while and the breakout failed but we didn’t go straight down so I expect it to continue for a few days before we go down 
Yeah you can hold onto it. I’m making a short term play. 
[removed]
I'm seeing a pattern of people implying that some people don't belong here. That is categorically not funny and a clear violation of rule 1.
I think this is quite bearish but I don't know shit. I am just learning TA but I read that rise of prices or pumps on low volume in a bear trend are not a really bullish sign.. wanted to know some expert advice on that 
Honestly you could have probably been pretty safe to call a bull market in August of 2016, if not sooner, after we made a significantly higher low \(like, over 50&#37; higher\) with a hidden bull div \(or at least, double bottom\) on the weekly RSI.
it was bound to be right eventually I guess 
Here's something insane I thought of yesterday. BTC never corrected more than 40% during 2017.

You could have longed 2.5x 100% of stack at any point throughout the year (before november) and never gotten liquidated. 

Literally pick any point between Jan and November and you could 2.5x long and never had a chance of getting liquidated. Could have longed the very top.

And even if you did it in November you wouldn't have gotten liquidated until after we hit ATH. 

Insane
I mean it's no biggie going all in with $100 anyway right. 
Only 10x myself just in case futures go crazy (like that wick to 7900 on june earlier today)
he said all in 
[https://imgur.com/a/t9lRufH](https://imgur.com/a/t9lRufH)

Happy papi? I crossed out my liquidation price, % ROE, and margin so nobody can stop hunt my liquidation, but essentially, if we bust through 7800 on spot I probably get liquidated

Plan is to close some at 6200-6300 expecting bounce to 6800-6900 (testing trendline as resistance after its broken) and then reshort there, close everything 5400-5500 and long ALL IN balls deep in the 5000-5400 range


Edit: and for those who remember I recently got rekt, I pulled some strings bailed myself out and im back on bitmex gamboool it up boys leggo

Edit2: and as you can see from my remaining account balance I am all in
Well, even if we go up its not a "triple bottom" because it's an ascending grind-line from 6k to 6.5k to 7k. Maybe we can make a huge ascending triangle on the daily but this will never be a triple bottom, I don't get why people keep saying that. A triple bottom would be 3 bounces from 6k, within like a 1 percent margin of error, not $500 each time.
Ok, maybe not bart, but 0.75% of a drop in 5 seconds isn't nothing either.
That's mex, not BFX, and we already know what happens, because it happened last month haha


And if price starts hitting those stop\-losses of short sellers right?
gdax volume does increase with major moves. That fact that it remains low confirms this is still noise vs. signal.
He's pretending he's capitulated so others will see it and invest their life savings in BTC. 
Exactly, you wouldn't want to miss out...you might even phrase your investment strategy as being afraid of missing out...
Yup right after unplanned maintenance, seems risky. I have half my stack on exchange :( 
I got liquefied during that one. My market stop loss didn't trigger. Did anyone else experience this?
It would certainly be easier to manipulate the price if the biggest exchange went offline for a while.
I urge those holding open positions on an exchange to use caution, especially positions that are large or with significant margin.
You're still expecting us to burst through $10k without any issues right? Didn't you say that would happen very soon? Hmmm
Down to $5,000 or $4,300 or $3,800.

Yeah, I don't get why most exchanges don't have a toolset of different types of stops. Maybe it makes the trading engine too complicated algorithmically. Seems like having various types of orders would be #1 priority for an exchange 
That is one of the reasons i have to create my own bot. The other is to close positions with limit offers but in a way that it follows the price if it starts going away. Like a market stop but with less fees 
Awesome, thanks! I did look into it earlier. Need to figure out some of the details, it sounds very useful
No problem

The interesting thing here is the DDoS attacks are from another trader on Bitmex who is fighting a bear whale on Finex. They were losing the battle, so they DDoS attacked Finex to get the upper hand.
If they has been buying all ze coinz though, price would not have dumped?
That's certainly *an* outcome. Stamp is all over the place right now, too. 

I'm not looking at it as manipulation or a conspiracy as much as just that folks generally overreact to anything involving exchange outages/issues. Throw in a FUDword like DDoS, and it's potentially panic-inducing in a skittish market. 

Still, could very much be a nothingburger, or we could even pump like you said. 
Thanks!
That is an excellent point. Thank you.
Yes it does.
Clouds are really just MA's visualized, which is why some find them helpful.  There's more nuanced ways of using them obv, but that's a child's explanation of them. 
At least it was in profit, but that was absolutely not the way I saw this position closing. 

Someone has to buy the top though.
Yeah holding to settlement or a clear reversal was the plan. Getting stopped out at the tippy top of a $350 1 minute wick was not in the plan.
No one rational would market buy through $300 of slippage unless they know something. Spooky!
Was this a wick just on Bitmex?  I'm not seeing anything on the bitfinex chart.
There can be several periods of redistribution, yes, but given how close we are to the bottom of our current cycle, I'd say that's pretty unlikely, all in all. 
I don't understand why people think there isn't a massive supply that can and will be dumped at any sign of large weakness. There are millions of coins from 2013-2017 that could be sold if paper profits are threatened. There is no shortage of supply for distribution- no one needs to accumulate at $7k in order to distribute their coins.. They already accumulated a *lot* below $6000 
Great chart. Do you lean bullish or bearish?
I'm a delusional bull, but 2017 was nuts. Every shitcoin went up. That's not healthy. 
That's a fair point. Reckon that's why we're BART\-ing up/down/left/strange/charm wherever and whenever it suits then?

I'd like to break out of a sym\-triangle sideways just to watch everyone collectively scratch their heads.

I've saved your comment amongst my pile of theories, if you're right I'll definitely be linking back to you with credit.
Not significantly faster since Bitmain launched the S9 in late may 2016 , by early 2017 it should have replaced almost every other miner since it vastly outperformed everything older and we haven't had anything faster since then.
Holy hell is there still a tip bot on here?
I noticed yesterdays as well, great work, keep it up!

No, you'll H0dl it
take it and try to save a baby. If you don't, they will accuse u of killing babies.
The behavior of BTC over this year has been eerily similar to 2014. Alts are still having a, ehrm, wealth reallocation party (which has had some effect on BTC), but there are a number of things seem to be playing out entirely too closely. If we bounce off the top of the broken four months from now so help me.
Lol, got lucky on this one, didn't see this coming down, thought it'll bounce didn't expect such a bounce.
So the price is above the cloud your presenting?

Edit: And if you flip the chart to it's normal orientation results are the same?
Thanks, I understand the cloud business but I haven't a clue what the candle values represent and the scale is what?
Edit: What has been dropping since last April at least and now is leveling off? Volatility?
Now I see what you did, but it is confusing.
Don't understand your scale with the one on the right. Price action doesn't match with chart on left.
I think we couldnt agree to a nomenclature yet, some people proposed MGD (mini) but it was confused with medium... maybe SGD? LGD?
I just don't really see the long term use case playing out like people think it will. I haven't seen any particularly convincing potential use cases- it seems like a problem in search of a solution. Everything it aims to fix ends up being the solution.

I mean I could totally be wrong...but damn, everyone here is convinced it will hit ATH again. 

I think crypto has flourished due to an incredibly unique and rare set of circumstances that allowed for a very large bubble to form. I don't know if it will happen again though because I think some of the dumbest money has finally entered the market. Before any of you think I'm being elitist, I consider myself dumb money. 

I mean I could totally be wrong, but like I said, I've never seen shit work out for the financial irresponsible looking to get rich quick before 
Idk maybe my timing could be off, but I still think we have a ways to go down. My friend bought some random shitcoin called Waves a few months ago and said he's just gonna hold until it goes up like 5000%. 

I will be bullish when his shitcoin dumps to 5% ATH or something. idk maybe bitcoin will explode or recover before his shitcoin dies and I'll be waiting too long

I still see tons of absolute morons just buying the dips and stuff. 

I just find it hard to believe that things will work out so well for dumb people. and it's not that I don't believe they don't deserve it. it's just in my experience life has never worked out so well for the financially illiterate

people are still euphoric and feel like they're geniuses for getting in early. yall can believe whatever you want but I know how life works and it's never this easy 
Well thanks, I didn't mean to imply anyone who has ever so much as touched an alt is a moron. 

I guess I came off super elitist but rest assured that I don't consider myself some financial guru...which is why I don't trust that I've struck gold and found the next big thing that will make me rich.

I'm fully prepared to concede that I'm wrong and I won't be one of those people who calls bitcoin a ponzi while I watch it soar 10000% over a few years. 

I just doubt it all, that's all. Perhaps my personal pessimistic view on life is interfering with my ability to evaluate the tech objectively? I don't know. I'll do some thinking on it. Thanks for the response. 
I always have to be careful of committing too far to the short side though. It's always possible I'll just be flat out wrong and look like an idiot like most people here are hoping for lol

but yes, that is my goal. I will invest in bitcoin not as a trade but as an investment when I think the price is too low for its current usage and real world value.

for now, I will wait
Very well put! Tried to write a comment like this but couldn't articulate it properly.
that's true. the alt space makes me bearish, bitcoin seems ok. Lot less stupid people in bitcoin 
Well yeah. I just don't think we're all lucky enough to see such ridiculous gains forever. 

Maybe my thinking is flawed in that I assume it will go down rather than simply not moon again. It's pretty plausible to see solid gains from here on out but I just can't see this mooning again like it has before. the money required to moon is exorbitant and would require a full on actual new paradigm. Given the stage of tech- I'm not really convinced. 

That's all
I also agree.

95% of these coins are 'pets.com's.  And will eventually cease to be relevent.  Anyone reading this who isn't skeptical of the Alt space should [check out CMC from the peak of 2014](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20131201/).  This is a really humbling window into what the crypto space could be in for in the future.

EDIT: changed exist to be relevent 
I just don't think it will explode like some people think it will. i don't think 2017 will happen again but I'm in like the 1% of people who hold any btc who don't believe it (which is partially why I'm convinced it won't happen)
No actually, I'm doing okay. Pretty well lately actually. Perhaps that's the buy signal? Dunno 
I just look at 2014 CMC to see the top 40 coins back then...36 of them I've never heard of and probably will never hear of again. I expect that to be the case in 2022 as well

Only reason I've been profitable shorting is because we're ranging. Anyone could've made just as much money longing. 

There has been no clear trend lately (except for the trend being no trend) but I have expected the market to move down for quite a while and have been positioning myself for it in anticipation

Nothing so far indicates to me we are on our way to a strong recovery. I'm sure plenty of people here disagree strongly 
It was my understanding that the MtGox hacks happened in 2011 and 2012 and that the hackers had cashed out way before 2014. Any downward pressure in 2014 wasn't directly the result of the hacked coins getting dumped.

Mt. Gox ran an insolvent exchange for years and used the Willy bot to try to earn the Bitcoin back to lessen the damage (he actually lost even *more* Bitcoin by using that bot). The logic was that If everybody kept their Bitcoin on the exchange, nobody would notice that Gox didn't  actually have the Bitcoins they said they had. But everybody started migrating to Bitstamp (and then eventually to Bitfinex) in summer of 2013, and Gox ran out of Bitcoins by the time 2014 rolled around.

Merchant adoption could put some selling pressure, but most people usually buy back what they spent.

Somebody can correct me if I'm wrong.
Nice man.  Keeping an eye on this now.  Thankyou
You dont have to have been around long to have seen Bitcoin run up after a trough like this.  Even the BGD back in April is a mini version. I'm telling you right now, one hourly candle can take us over 8200, and it can explode upwards for weeks after such an event. No way it goes down much from where it is now. Would have happened already. Upside potential is far greater right now. 

Still holding my long from yesterday with no stops. A bit green but I'm expecting a big gain on one of these trades pretty soon. The only thing that makes me a little nervous is that big spike in the mempool a couple days ago. If those were coins moving off exchanges, we'll see big fireworks in the sky soon. If they were moving to exchanges, I may lose big on this trade. But it's OK. I'm always ready to buy the dip.
I got lucky there ;-)

Thanks,
Ah, I see
Everyone doesn't live in a cave.
Mmmh, so... it could be an interesting short squeeze...  
*Bognanov calling*
With how much leverage 
Yes, that makes sense.
I would advise against using bitmex as a US citizen. Its spelled out clear as day in the ToS that US citizens are not allowed. Would hate to see them take your funds cause you didn't follow the ToS.

Just a heads up.
Sounds risky dude.  You could easily wake up to some bad news.
Stacey, bro? Come on bro I thought we talked about this bro?
Yeah, did you plan to do one before posting the comment? Great idea btw.

It would be something like this: https://www.tradingview.com/x/f4hCLCaZ/


3.5 dogecoin
Average :D
I'm just taking the top and bottom of the triangle (with a little bit of leeway)... If i may ask, why did you single me out in this sea of prediction? 
You missed it with 1 USD.
On smaller time frame targets, a small position is a better idea most of the times. However, if you are looking at longer time frame targets, scaling more into a small position / stack is not a bad idea I would say if you are even a little confident about future price movements.

Last month I opened a much smaller position of what I currently have. The risk wasn't that high. I added a lot of new stack  to it at around -12% mark of the position. which reduced the entry by more than 6%, thus minimizing loss at the time of closing.

Scaling more into the position not only saved me from bigger loss, but also helped me build the needed confidence to trade with a position this big, and from making bad decisions. 

Confidence is extremely important when it comes to better decision making; which is a vital part of any given trade. Cheers!

Well we haven't made a new low since 6k, weekly and daily charts show a pattern of higher lows and lower highs. Personally I don't see a reason to be extremely bearish or bullish at this point, not sure what TA or chart patterns you're talking about. Seems more like consolidation than a true bear market to me.
Right? Binance is going off on its own in a sub-7.4k exploration adventure.
Kraken BTCEUR just had an 1.6&#37; up\-tick with just a 460 BTC order... guess related?
You are gonna arrive at your destination soonest if you just sit in the traffic, period. I kinda get your analogy that you have to wait the 20 minutes ($200) to know if you wanna keep waiting. However, you'll actually know if traffic is there or not at that point. 

I personally don't think I have that ability to wait $200 and then suddenly know what the market is gonna do next, or even have a better idea what the market is gonna do next. All I know for sure is that $7600 is $200 cheaper than $7800, so I'd rather buy there. 

I've been trading this market for 4 years now, and for 2 years of it, I drew lines and chased 'critical' breakouts. It didn't work for me 9 times out of 10, and the one time it didn't work didn't make up for the other 9. It's literally letting the market dictate your trading. You are a leaf in the wind, reacting to a gust. I'd rather be proactive, not reactive. It just works better for me. 
Yeah, I've stepped away from that kind of thinking in my trading. I like to try to keep it simpler and I don't kid myself that I can predict the market well enough to know the exact point I should buy or sell at. When price is rising, I'm slowly selling. When price is going down, I'm slowly buying. 
In price huh
Don't feel bad, the previous two shorts before that I did were the same. Didn't take any profits and ended up not even covering fees. Wasn't gonna let that happen again!
Try with a pm, the thread bot could be down 
There's a ton of churn on this subreddit. Most people do not stick around for more than a few months. 

I've noticed lately that the churn is even higher and there are significantly more altcoin proponents here lately as well
I'd probably wait for $7,600 to break up, but I'd expect to take a loss on this trade one way or another. 

You might get a slightly better exit in the high $7,400s, but I'd consider that a small victory for this trade. 
Not really convinced that shorting is the right move here honestly.

I wouldn't really advise anybody open a long or short between $7,000 and $7,800, but if somebody put a gun to my head then risk/reward actually favors a long from anywhere in that range:

https://imgur.com/a/4QcA4pj

The market is either going to drop through the support line of the triangle and force you out for a loss of at most ~10% just below $7,000, or it's going to push back up to the top of the formation (and potentially push through to the upside) for a gain of at least 20%.  
Thanks. My bad!
while he is obnoxious, to be fair, he can't really add much to what he believes. 

"it's going down" is pretty much the jist of his predictions lol 
Could also be a bear trap. It was 6/6 in Asia about 3 hours ago. Seems way too coincidental.
The whole point is that it's precisely the 6th. 
Because the pattern is that it hits either the high or the low in the triangle on the 6th and then reverses. We had 7100 on the 29th so unless it's lower than that, it's not a continuation of the pattern. 
To be the low for the period.
please see below
I dont know, but to me it sounds stupid to place a market order of 460 BTC in such a thin orderbook just to HODL
I doubt that. Kraken has little effect on the other bigger exchanges, even more in EUR. I wouldn't think much of it. If you go back you can see several similar spikes, although they usually happen in response to big movements.
I would draw comparisons between 2014 Gox Bots and the 2017 Mom 'n' Pop investors.

Essentially all we're looking at is a surge in demand that suddenly tapers.
That might have been a factor as well which only goes to show how a different scenario we were from back then , there was so much going against bitcoin , it really looked like it was doomed 
Dentacoin mcap 200 million. Easy.

Dentacoin bid, less than 100k.

Dentacoin actual value, ?? 


I chose an extreme example to make the concept easy to follow, the exact same thing applies to bitcoin. 
Sure it goes both ways but you're forgetting that there is far more TA to support a bearish sentiment than there is a bullish sentiment. 

You could say neutral if you wanted but considering we can't muster the strength to break major bullish TA resistances then i'd suggest for now the medium is still bearish. 

Of course it can just go sideways but a check of the weekly and the daily, a check of the MA's across multiple time frames and the Ichimoku all suggest we are nowhere near bullishness yet in the coming weeks or months.
Ya a few days ago someone pointed out that on Jan 6th we had our peak for the bull run, Feb 6th was the first bottom, Mar 6th we had our top at 11k, Apr 6th we had another bottom, and May 6th we had another top, so now people think June 6th we will have another bottom.

but I think since we noticed the trend it probably wont have the same effect since people are expecting it
Since 17k we've been making high's/low's on the 6th of every consecutive month

6 jan - 17.1k

6 feb - 6000

6 mar - 11.5k (5th was 11.7k)

6 april - 6.5k (not the local low, but 6.4 could be considered a blowoff wick)

6 may - 10k

6 jun - ?????

Correct. I should rephrase, the 8500-9000 range will be telling.
Thanks for this.  I'd be interested to know the probabilities of them playing out based on what the medium term trend is. One day wheniv got some time to kill i might go and tally them all up
The only local low you can really compare that with is the Feb 25th low and RSI definitely didn't make a lower low in the beginning of March to there.

And price went on to make a new local high anyway.
Oh. I wouldn't hold that one back into the red. I'd either take profits here (partial or whole) and set stops maybe just under 7600 / 7575ish. But that's me.
Ok, I see
WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU SAY?!?! /s :)
I'm mainly joking lol, however I personally believe astrology could even have some merit to it. any general effect someone's "sign" has is potentially the effect that relative age compared to peers has in development while in public school. For example, a Gemini tends to be on the younger side of a class of students, whereas whatever the sign for August is will be significantly on the older side. 

That's my lil theory anyway 
I made a boom boom
I mean I believe in the tech. and I am happy to invest and participate in an innovation with potential world changing financial consequences... but I’m incredibly weary of this and am having PTSD flashbacks of, oh idk, the entirety of this year; the year of the bouncing dead cat. I don’t want to miss out so I haven’t sold but I’m certainly not buying and further longing here. this could go to 5k in a flash. good luck bub I hope for all of us yr right I just am skeptical of this rise 
There are lots of bearish people here who have been expecting sub $6-7k for months now. I'd imagine his reasoning could be anywhere from "bubble popped, not enough capitulation" to "this is a very weak bounce off the bottom of what should be very strong support" 

for me personally it's a combination of both and other factors. There are several sell/short signals for me in this range that vary from the 1-4h time frame to the weekly time frame
Bears are hitting the hopium hard these days. Can't blame them.
Makes*
I definitely understand your logic. I always try to create a new strategy based on what I see as current market conditions and learn from my past mistakes. My main change in strategy is really is to stop swinging for the fences and trying to make life changing money in crypto which at one point I was close (pretty much from luck) only to lose a lot of unrealized gains from greed. I used to give myself a hard time if I sold too early but I am now trying to change that mindset and take profit and move on. It's really a personal decision to be honest and depending on your age, financial status and risk tolerance it would vary. At the end of the day I want to enjoy being in the cryptomarket and keep it as stress-free as possible.
:/ 
Bankers get their bonuses on the 6th of each month as part of a new monthly payment scheme being trialled by all major banks. Also, Chinese New Year or something. 
well you guys would just love the chinese number conspiracy in bitcoin
Right that makes sense, Cheers!
Okay, thanks!
because longs/shorts hardly moved and 1k btc was sold

longs moved down a whopping 8 btc in the 5m candle of that sell. 

Shorts moved down 2 btc. 


edit: very likely incorrect 
What do you mean than a green? I agree that lately flat sideways means a big buy or sell incoming 

Oh I see sorry. No I don't necessarily agree actually, it "barts" in both directions for sure. 
Yep, no problem.
That or wash trading 
Comparing last year's with the current volume is like Comparing apples to oranges.

I tend to look at how weekly averages change percentage wise with a given trend.

EL oh friggin EL


Presumably you believe in a bounce, since you placed a long? Well, good luck. I also placed a modest long.
Let's not digress. Rule 1.
why is a mod openly defending an obvious troll? plus the dude's comment seemed like a light joke, ease out pal
It’s a shame he’s getting upvoted too. 
Thank you. I don't understand why these guys are so mean. All I'm doing is showing them how I make money (low leverage longs after dips).
A rise on higher volume would certainly be more bullish than what we're seeing  now.. That's not to say it won't go higher thoigh
Im no expert, but I would agree.  People (me) don't trust the bottom.  It looks a bit too bear flaggy for people (me) to buy.
And I'm calling B.S. while still giving the guy room enough to save face.
Yes. Good luck.
Not entirely true. Because the first dump to 6K didn't really last that long. It was more of a wick from 7K. The price was at 7K and dumped very quickly to 6k but was bought up immediately. Its hard to really call that 6K price point as anything but a short term flash crash. The real price point was around 7k or so. 
BBands on the 15 were already very tight and had to go somewhere. There was more pressure on the upside so it fell, but was quickly stopped so i'm not counting much on this.

I'm trying to work out what I think would happen.  On one hand you probably have existing buy orders for shorts and planned longs, but on the other hand I could imagine a lot of long stop losses being triggered.  I wonder if they will try to bring it on slowly...
A bunch of stop losses hitting each other I guess resembles a short squeeze but to me are fundamentally different. One happens because there are a lot of shorts open that have to cover as the price moves against them. The other is just a bunch of traders that decided to take a loss after a certain % move against them. (This is my theory on why we've been having all those "barts" recently. For some reason there has been a spike in people who are using ridiculously tight stops that cascade into each other.)
I doubt there's any risk to funds aside from the market dropping out of concern. Seems to be holding fairly well so far. 
I was short. I remember sitting there going, "holy shit, I'm making so much money and people are getting rekt without being able to stop it."

Brutal. I would have been pissed. 
I guess we can only watch the charts on other exchanges to get an idea of what will happen when it's back online. 
You could have saved time by just saying “3k next week”
If that were going to happen, it would have already happened IMO. I think we're at or near a bottom.
What exchange do you use? 
> to close positions with limit offers but in a way that it follows the price

Are you already using this or do you plan to make one? 
>I have no losing position stupid imbecile.

>Now go and "appreciate to see". Stupid imbecile.

So much salt and anger. Can't imagine how frustrating your life must be, to get this worked up over a stranger posting a trade. You may want to block me so as to avoid seeing future trades and giving yourself a hernia. 
So what your saying is that a bullwhale was losing so he/she resorted to dirty tactics to get the upper hand?

If that doesn't say we have an organic market then I don't know what else will! Has me super confident about the price rise!
Usually I would call BS but bitcoin basically being created by hackers, mostly owned by hackers, hacktivist and dark web regulars \(forgot about the investors lol\) this doesn't surprise me one bit...
I don't doubt this, but do you have a source? The price dropped during the outage so it seems more likely to have been a bear.
I'd hardly call the last 12 hours a "dump."

Price dropped a tad, sure, but nothing substantial.
And this is precisely why I rarely make any trading decisions based on external factors. 

There's absolutely no way to know what impact they'll have on the market.

Sometimes, it's a no brainer. A country banning bitcoin has been a pretty strong GTFO signal in the past, for example.

But an exchange going down for a few hours? That's just another day in the neighborhood.
Stops... Can't live with them, without them you go insane from alarms.
Could very well have been a high leverage short liquidation. 
Yes, just on XBTM18. Swaps didn't do it and BFX didn't even come close 
If he thinks this is redistribution he doesn't think this is close to the bottom of our current cycle.
If someone was holding a bunch of coins since 2013 through all that's happened til now, it'd take something truly extraordinary for them to decide to start dumping them at, say, $7000. Like, anyone holding since 1+ year ago through all the peaks and dumps we've had surely has the upcoming halvening(s) in mind or whatever huge fundamental changes rather than any local price perturbations, nothing else makes sense. 
In true non\-committal fashion, I'm waiting to see what happens these next few days. The continued higher lows are, in my mind, bullish, but it'll only take one failed instance for that to disappear as a bullish indicator. When you consider that the lower highs are by &#37; worse, you could argue this doesn't mean anything and we never left the bear market behind.

[https://www.moonmath.win/](https://www.moonmath.win/) has us going sideways or grinding very slowly up for a long time and a multi year bear market in the blue channels still could happen quite easily. 3k is our theoretical bottom both on moonmath and on the symmetrical triangle bearish trend continuation. Perhaps that isn't a coincidence. I always sit and expect maximum pain, so you could argue that I'm bearish?
Elephant in the room warning...

Sigh...

So much unappreciated truth in your comment.
At least bitconnect is dead
I think the "Barts" are an attempt to shake traders and weak hands out of the market. Someone or some group is kicking the tree and letting the ripe fruit fall out. If that were not the case then this low volume should be killing the price when high volume selloffs kick in. It seems to be working well enough. I think they have their sights set on new lows and are getting frustrated. with the relative stability. Watch the Barts stop and the price make a long slow rise.
the amount of hate and poison spilled over daily at rbtc shows how desperate Ver and his bcash disciples are.
Lol, BCash tipping is almost always spam. I see people tipping fractions of pennies sometimes. It's meant to be viral marketing (somewhat covertly so) but it doesn't seem to be doing much in the *scheme* of things.

I don't really care if some subset of the population wants to put their money into BCash, I just care about the constant shilling and fraudulent marketing. The faster BCash goes to zero, the better off the entire space is. That, or they just stop with the farce and start acting like every other alt coin.
Wow, all my favorite BCash stalkers are here. We're just missing /u/etherael and /u/kokansei.
I was planning to just send it to a communist regime.
Tbh, it almost seems too perfect.  I wonder if it's happened like this because the 2014 crash is referenced so much.
Doesnt seem like it here 1day side by side

> I think crypto has flourished due to an incredibly unique and rare set of circumstances that allowed for a very large bubble to form.

The total market cap was under a trillion dollars and that was for sure 'created' by a hundred billion 'real' dollars or less in the market. That is not a large bubble for a global asset class. 

> I don't know if it will happen again though because I think some of the dumbest money has finally entered the market.

The 'dumb money' we are looking for are all the 'long-term investors' and 'financial independence' planners who don't realize that **not** investing a percent or two of your total assets into something that has demonstrated consistent 300%+ returns yearly is more risky than ignoring it because it's 'too volatile.' 

It might take months, it might take years for them to get in; but with more and more 'real' financial entities looking for ways to onboard folks into crypto, it's likely a matter of when not if until those guys start getting in. Moving even half a percent of the money in stock markets over to crypto would easily launch the total marketcap here into multi-trillion range. 

Yeah, maybe it won't happen -- but *IF* it does, and it's really not that much of a stretch to assume it will -- anyone with any skin in the game at all between now and then is going to look like Warren fucking Buffet. You could say it's a dumb risk and a gamble; the way I see it, *not* investing into crypto at this stage is a bigger risk, even without considering the potential implications of dollar hyperinflation, all that libertarian crap about world economies moving over to Bitcoin, Ethereum becoming the 'web 3.0', or whatever other bullish dreams. 

There's a lot of money in the world. 800 billion is almost certainly too little to have been 'the final bubble.'

I don't know if we've really hit the bottom or not, but that random shitcoin your friend bought is working with some of the biggest financial entities in Russia. Is it overvalued? Maybe, I don't know. But calling it a 'random shitcoin' and anyone investing into it a 'financially illiterate idiot' seems a bit harsh. Heck, fucking Amazon started out as an online book retailer and all the financial 'pros' back then were so convinced it'd never amount to anything. 
If you know so much about life, how about you apply your knowledge somewhere that matters and let us 'financially illiterate' continue wasting our time on reddit?

No problem. As others have mentioned your pessimism and strong urge to not follow the crowd likely make you an excellent trader, I’d just not want you to end up bailing early and missing out due to this mindset.

Of course the real possibility is there that I’m wrong too.
Oh and also, I know plenty of self made rich people who are dumb as fuck in many ways. Sometimes you just stumble into the right things at the right times, as happened with many of the early bitcoin buyers just purchasing some drugs.
I don't know man. Just reading through your comment history makes me think otherwise. 
So what's with the gloom and doom?

No problem
What's your problem troll?
5x. but will add more if I'm sure 
Is there a better alternative for US citizens then? 
:D
Oh I didn't mean to single you out. I just like your input. Don't take it negatively because I meant the opposite. 
I can definitely respect that mindset. 

It's not how I generally trade, but there's some merit to it. 

At $7,850, I can't argue that I wouldn't rather be long from $7,600. 
That makes sense, but I wouldn't say that his strategy implies he thinks he knows where the market is headed. There are lots of different strategies that can work and while I agree that an aggressive strategy of trying to get the bottom and top is much more profitable, it's also very difficult to do correctly. Especially when the market inevitably decides to trend again at some point...

Are you still short or did you close most of it? I remember you saying you'd close it when futures turned around and went into backwardation right 
There's also a ton of us who lurk in the darkness and very rarely comment.  Just read and learn.  And laugh! :)  But many of us have been here for a long time!  
I think it was your post that got me thinking about it yesterday. You made a post that gave the possibility of bitcoin failing and the content you put out was up to standard as per usual. Your usually well received around here despite your bearish outlook but it's definitely something that has been on my mind this time around (Maybe this time is different maybe we wont get back to 20K, the space in general is a shitshow and full of scams which isn't great but bitcoin could be that once in a lifetime chance) not sure what the comment score was towards the end after you maybe expanded on your views and answered questions but that initial downvote was very much an emotionally charged reaction because that's a big threat to people (and a lot of people would just rather not entertain the idea).

The sad thing is the real indicator of the bubble bottoms has been suicide hotlines on the front of /r/bitcoin and all the crypto subs which suggests over\-investment both financially and emotionally.
[deleted]
Thanks man!
Agree, I think we need to rekt a few shorts and see if the bulls have the power to break through the upper wedge.  
Technically, the last "lowest low" of $6425 was on 1-April, but the low of $6500 on 6-April marked the lowest point to start the next uptrend.  

I guess this could be the same type of scenario here, if it plays out that way.
That is what some are putting forth because it's easy to explain, but April lowest wick was on the 1st. Highs are Mar 5, April 5 and 6. There is variance among exchanges.
If this is a repeat of 2013, then I can see it go sideways for a few months and maybe slowly rise and retest 20k this year. If this is a repeat of 2014...well I don't know. I think breaking down below 7100 and staying there will be quite bearish and I'll change my sentiments then but for now I think its not unreasonable to be neutral.
This is based on futures expiration as well. And the start of it coincides with the launch of CME futures first expiry...?

Futures fucked this market man. The evidence is just piling on.

I remember when futures were coming and this sub was clamoring for it, but a silent few warned what futures would do to the market in terms of manipulation and price suppression. We're seeing it now.

That is very odd... thank you for the clarification good sir!
!long btcusd close 7610 

Decided to take some profits here.  My mood is short term bearish. 
Don’t want to ride this back into the red again.  

If it breaks 7800 I’ll likely  jump back in. Thanks. 

Lololololllll :D
So how do you explain that on this day, 1460 days (4year) have passed since this [https://www.coinigy.com/s/i/5b171391561f3/](https://www.coinigy.com/s/i/5b171391561f3/) in relation to where we are in the chart now?
Yeah but that's not what astrology is. Astrology (supposedly) relates cosmological events with sociological ones. There's really no mechanism of action and, even if we're impacted by events in deep space, it doesn't mean that the astrological model is an accurate one, especially the *sign* thing. As you said, that people are born at different times of the year likely changes the distribution in some way, but that doesn't mean there's meaningful impact from anything beyond our relationship with the Sun. I'm pretty sure astrology is thoroughly debunked at this point. 

Just look at the 1 week chart. Looks bullish af to me 
np
Good eye. ;)
Nah it just updated late: https://datamish.com/d/000000004/btcusd?refresh=10s&orgId=1&from=now-1h&to=now
Strangly, 20 minutes later 600btc shorts opened, 600 btc longs closed and price didnt move at all...
Thanks and good luck to you as well. 

IMO I wouldn’t mind a drop here (I’d lose a little money but I would make more in the long run if this thing didn’t go sideways)
I'm enforcing the rules and asking that we not throw out people who we disagree with.

A person who disagrees with you isn't always a troll. Sometimes they're just operating from different values or with different knowledge. Those people are welcome here.

If you have a problem with a post, downvote and report, but I'm not going to isolate someone because they have a different way of communicating or thinking.
Probably because you have this remarkable ability to:

\- Say you're long and that we're going to blast through $10k with no issue...yet when the price drops you've magically managed to close it before the drop.  

Of course you say this after the event.  But it's hilarious to observe all the same.
You might want to rethink your approach to communicating here. While it doesn't clearly violate any rules, it's easy to interpret as a rule 3 or rule 5 violation. We're not here to advertise a position, or bitcoin, or anything. We want to have a full conversation about the market without being advertised to.

When people come across submissions, like the ones you made in this thread, It gets under their skin. You should take some time to get to know the audience you're writing for and adjust your language so it's more appropriate for the context.

You've been warned about low effort contributions before, and I'm worried about this becoming a pattern. I'm running out of options to enforce the rules. Please adjust.
thanks, GL to you too. And I am only short term bearish, I fully believe 100k+ is happening, probably within 2 years. I just do not believe we can go up again without actual capitulation first, and a clear reversal.
No...the real price was at 6k. Doesn't matter if its a wick or not, that's where the high volume came in, which is important. Also, the second bottom was 6.4-6.5, which is 500 lower than our third bottom. It's a symetrical triangle, at the very best it might turn into an ascending triangle if we go back to 11.7, but it is not a triple bottom
My assumption is that the general expectation would be a drop, and short-term traders would exit positions to protect against that drop (and therefore help cause it) as well as future concerns regarding access to the exchange/their funds. Two outages in one morning doesn't instill confidence in skittish traders. 
Some baby movement right now 
Do you think there is any way of blaming bitmex for this, and get my funds back? If my stop would have worked I would have been slightly in the green.  
Edit: Good to hear you didn't get rekt. 
I don't think we can know that definitively at all. I think there is >70% change we see prices below the Feb 5 bottom within the next 6 months.

This is based off of volume and the historical price of BTC, as well as the perception in the marketplace that BTC isn't ready/useful for global-scale use in commercial systems.

If we do see prices that low I predict the price will become crushed.

Bitmex, but I'd prefer to use Gdax if it allowed for even low leveraged margin trading.

I like bitmex's order types much better than Gdax...

But I do wish there was a type of order where you could set a limit fill only if a certain price has been hit 

For example I'd like to set a limit sell order at $7350 that would activate (although not get filled initially) if we dropped to $7300.

So I'd set it now but it wouldn't be active. if we dropped to $7300, it'd activate and I'd have a sell limit order open at $7350. I think that would be nifty. 

Of course it would make sense just to short it now but lots of people's trading styles depend on where it goes first. So I've always wanted an order type like that

Or, actually, the most useful one:

a stop buy that works in the same way just with a stop buy. Wait that's a trailing stop. Just kidding. Are there trailing stops on bitmex? 
Just thinking about it 
[deleted]
Correct.
I do have a source, but I cannot share it unfortunately. I understand that it's hard to take an internet stranger's word for things, so no hard feelings if you call my bluff.

I've been whale watching for months now and have gotten the hang of it for the past couple months. I was able to see the big short squeeze in April coming a day before it happened.
True more like sideways
> But an exchange going down for a few hours? That's just another day in the neighborhood.

Well, the market dropped fairly hard during the 2-hour BitMEX outage in May and the Binance lockdown in March. If it wasn't BFX and it wasn't a DDoS attack, I'd be less inclined to expect a market reaction. 

Still, in my case, it was just a question of whether to hold my short or to close it. If I'd been out of position, I wouldn't have opened one. Seems like you snagged the local bottom for the time being though. 
But wasn't it you that when China 'banned' Bitcoin again last year said that the massive drop we saw on that day or may not be due to that...something about "just reading what the charts tell me" 

I seem to remember, and thinking how bizarre it was that anyone could attribute that sharp drop to anything but the China news which dropped at the very same time.
Sorry I'm just a bit excited!
On Bitfinex shorts decreased when the price shot up, could be liquidations as well.
Oh damn, haha.  Crazy.
The potential for a looming bear market could definitely get some cold storage onto exchanges. There's more than a few people here I can list who have been around for a while who recently sold. 

Off the top of my head: csasker, trudx both sold in $7-8ks in the past few weeks

and they don't need to dump all of it. People from 2013 have hundreds of coins easily
thanks for the nice reply :)
Yeah, take away 2017 EOY and you have a good healthy market. we suffer today because people went crazy back then. Kimchi premium, mortgage investments, credit cards maxed out... Mass hysteria more likely than bullrun
Silver linings man, silver linings
I always thought the bitcoin tip on reddit stuff was the coolest stuff you could do with bitcoin before I entered the space...it was this incredibly easy way to send money to people very quickly over the internet.

when I learned that you couldn't tip people anymore like you could in 2013/2014 (when I first heard about bitcoin) I was like whaaaaaaat why.

It's little stuff like that that makes me go :(
please don't lose it
I don't think bcore accepts bitcoin. 
The price action does not look the same. 
Hmm, that's probably one of the better if not the best arguments I've seen for all of this. I've thought something along these lines before and it nags at me all the time: "If I don't believe in it, why am I in it? Well because it'd be kind of stupid not to be. the risk/reward is so insanely lopsided that it'd be dumb not to at least put a small amount in." 

So thanks, that's a pretty good point. I will try to see speculators and investors in this space more along those lines than along the lines of fools trying to get rich quick. 

Appreciate your responses a lot, thanks again 
> The 'dumb money' we are looking for are all the 'long-term investors' and 'financial independence' planners who don't realize that not investing a percent or two of your total assets into something that has demonstrated consistent 300%+ returns yearly is more risky than ignoring it because it's 'too volatile.'

Also, if it proves to be non-correlated or inverse co-related to other assets, this may actually be really true.
Well, I won't lie, I haven't been arsed to really look into it. There's only so many coins you can keep track of before realizing not all of them will survive.

Thanks for sending me some stuff, but I think you can make a pitch  like this for *every* coin on CMC. except for like...bitconnect. 

I will reflect on this discussion though.. Thanks
No, you don't understand. He is obviously a financial god and we are just peasants. We're not supposed to question his divine powers of handling money in a speculative market. /s 
That is probably what I will do here soon...I am beginning to dislike this subreddit, I don't really think I fit in anymore :/
Rule 1 - took it a little over the edge here.
Dude I commented on a subreddit. It's unfortunate I upset you so much...but there's nothing being crammed down your throat. 
No you're right. and I will definitely do some thinking. I have never once thought I was 100% correct and that anyone should follow my advice, and I didn't mean to imply that they should. I simply wanted to express my personal judgments and perception of the crypto space. 

but like I said, you're right. It's possible my take on it is incorrect, and I need to garner a deeper understanding of the tech and financial implications themselves before fully committing to an opinion.
 
It's unfortunately a very complicated technology and most of my understanding is second hand, so I fully concede that *I* could be the moron. 

Again. thanks for responding with such a friendly tone, I can't say I deserved it for the way my comment was initially written. Will do some reflection. 
That's very true and I've thought of that before. Sometimes people really do get lucky. To me it seems that there are simply *too* many people involved now for all of us to get lucky. That's all
Why's that? What have I said that's particularly stupid? 


Well I just...to be completely honest I don't believe the tech will be revolutionary. It's been 9 years and it's still being used as a purely speculative investment. Perhaps these things take more time but from what I've seen in the tech world, anything that hasn't found a use case in 9 years is probably not going to find one. 

People compare it to the internet but the internet was made...*before the internet* 

the speed at which technology moves now is lightning fast (heh) and I find it hard to believe that such revolutionary technology is taking so long to ramp up. 

Anyway I don't mean to call anyone here who believes in it a moron or anything. Although I do find some of the arguments fairly questionable. 

My "moron" statements are also directed towards people like myself lol. Perhaps that's why I'm not buying  though? Who knows. 

Anyway, apologies. I would erase my message but it's a good reminder for me to remember to use my words better
/u/justanotherlogin  Actual PnL to my stack was 4.8% considering the scalping I did on the way down during this position.  I used the 'profit' command a couple times but it doesn't seem to affect the tallied PnL displayed here and on the site.  Am I doing something wrong?
We *really* lucked out on this one.   Well, I guess it's not just luck, because it took getting burned by Mex's engine many times in the past to develop the safe habits when using it.
When are you posting the chart that shows that BTC almost hit $20K.  I had no idea.
Kraken offers up to 5x on some trading pairs. Thats as much margin as you'll get in the US
no worries mate!
No matter where the price is, you'd rather be long from $7600 than $7800 heh. Price could be $1000 or $10,000, that's kind of the point.

I get that trading a market isn't exactly the same as buying a car, but sometimes I just feel like traders over-complicate things.

The main notion you have to establish in your head to justify waiting for a $200 rise before you buy in is that you have predictive powers, or at least an edge on the rest of the market in terms of predicting that market. It seems like you do pretty well with that. I don't. It's hard for me to separate emotions from that kind of trading. It's hard for me to be patient and flexible. For the most part you handle those things well from what I can tell.
Yes, I was surprised at the backlash as well honestly. usually I get a few people getting upset but there was one guy who got very mad at me and even began to PM me, proverbially "taking it outside" with me, lol.

I get that people are emotionally invested, but damn. I just can't see someone buying AAPL being so emotional over a criticism of the company and its future or something. I don't have much experience with stocks though so could be totally wrong.

I just laid out why, in detail, I can see us not mooning again...:/ 

My other main reason is the faith in institutional money will falter when the space stagnates/bleeds for a while. It's a prediction based on Soros' theory of reflexivity. I need to find the comment I wrote because it sums up my entire feelings on why bitcoin bubbled and why I am skeptical it will again

Anyway, thanks, I appreciate your input and thoughts and it's nice to know that was mainly a visceral reaction by a select few. I definitely should have chosen my words a bit more carefully though 

I do believe we have at least one capitulation event left. I will go long after that and will re-evaluate my long term outlook based on what happens after that 
I've seen quite a few I knew but 90% of them were people I didn't know or people who stopped posting around December/January 
Honestly don't care for people being 'rekt' but I have a suspicion there are far more people here that 'short' who are actually in most cases and situations 'net long' or 'neutral'.

Anyone who is actually going 'net short' here - hats off to you for having serious balls.

Agree with Chewy - likely (within next 6 months to a year) many people will be wishing again for the days they could buy Bitcoin @ 7.5k.

Personally I think next month keeps us in the support and resistance channels (95% time within 7k and 8k).

I am just not seeing much bull momentum and watching the charts I get the distinct feeling we are just waiting for the real game to start (Macro August wedge close that chewy posted).  Right now it's all Simpsons: Bart this (up), that(down) and the other thing(up/down, down/up) with homer drooling on Marge in between.
True enough. I was following the Bitmex chart and JST candles so it's always the 5th. Finex and others have a lower low on April 1 so maybe it can still fit. But it's a stretch given how much lower May 29 was. 
2017 *was* 2013.

We are now in the aftermath of a manic, blow-off top that saw a 70% correction. Thats a trend-changing event. Public gets spooked, and shit like Bill Gates publicly wanting to short it doesn't help. People sell to preserve their capital and holding becomes the less profitable strategy. It's not unreasonable to be neutral, but a spades a spade and a bubble is a bubble. Everything until capitulation or bottom market structure is just a counter-trend rally.
I hope to God it's not a repeat of 2014 because if it is then we are really going to see a prolonged painful drop lasting I guess until the winter at least.

2013 would let's face it be ideal right now. Some consolidation and then a nice slow rise before we get into another bull run. 

Whatever anyone's views on it we all just want to see it to succeed. The day we enter a world of actually being able to use crypto in day to day life is something many of us dream of. 

We'll get there, just going to take a big ol dose of patience...and probably a lot of pain on the way!
> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_the_Beast

Holy shit, you sent me down a rabbit-hole but look what I encountered.

> A futurist view of the Mark of the Beast is that the rise of a supranational currency (for example, the euro) could be a hallmark of the End Times and that the mark of the beast will be a sign on the forehead or on the right hand.[52] Futurists (focused on the future) believe that the revelation addresses primarily the Second Coming of Christ and similar events at the time's end (1:7; 19:11–16; 22:11–12). Although many do find truth in these general assertions, this view does not take into account all historical views. (Ch. 2–5; 12:5–16).[53]

Bitcoin as global currency = end of times? *puts on tin-foil hat*
lol it is actually pretty eerie how closely we mirror 2014 sometimes but I can't tell if you're joking 😂
This is interesting stuff though. Not really astrology but some will call it that.

Ya I just was more musing  on why people may have picked up on any sort of patterns in the first place. it's pretty clear celestial beings have 0 effect on us 
Better yet the 3 week chart.
Or the monthly one. 
Just longer and longer time frame till you barely see the downturn
Is that a thing? Is it delayed? Because that would actually change a *lot* about my interpretation of a few movements. That would possibly imply that BGD from $6.8 was indeed a stop hunt/short squeeze because shorts didn't close until 15m after the huge green candle according to the longs/shorts charts
Good call (your long)!
I agree with your motive but disagree with your standpoint. You criticised someone for making a VERY light joke which had a minute implication of outlining how much of a shitpost OP made. You are now siding with someone who consistently taunts short sellers and posts ridiculous content which is 99% meant to troll. That does not feel right. 
[deleted]
Sorry but you're wrong, flash crashes and wicks DO matter. Not much stock should be put into low/small timeframes like that. 
Nope. I doubt there's any recourse in this situation, and MEX has little incentive to make traders whole, as they have no major competitor. 
Bitmex does have trailing stops and I feel like there is a way to set up your first example but I'm not a computer atm. If you're unaware there's a drop down menu on the stop order tab 
Don't know, i use kraken and there are no trailing stops. If i ever create a bot (in this case a Windows program would be easier to manage) and the API for bitmex isn't too different from kraken i'll let you know. 
> So I'd set it now but it wouldn't be active. if we dropped to $7300, it'd activate and I'd have a sell limit order open at $7350. I think that would be nifty. 

A stop limit order does this behaviour. You can set the limit order on either side of the stop to go on either side of the book.

Gdax sucks the big one for not allowing you to place take profit and stops on the same position.  Such bullshit...

I'm working on programming a trading interface for Gdax to do this, which is really a waste of time since they could just not suck...

I also wish it had margin.  My main reason for Gdax is FDIC and 0%  limit order fees.
Seriously fuck that person, feels like we are being held hostage in this range because they aren't getting what they want 
Ah, but did the market drop *because* of the Bitmex outage, or were Bitmex's servers overloaded because users were anticipating a drop and spamming sell orders?

Or, perhaps the market was going to drop anyway, and the outage was just a coincidence?

Either way, we'll never know. 
That was my stance at the time, yes. But I'm not sure I'd make the same claim today if another large player in the geopolitical space passed substantial legislation that was obviously negative to crypto. 

The issue is more whether the drop would have happened eventually anyway. In general, I'd argue that yes, it would have. However, there's really no way to know that after the fact. 

If the charts/general market sentiment are already bearish, then shorting a major negative news event is probably a smart decision.
Nice time to be holding a long, if you are. 
No problem, being asked can be nice because you write down your thoughts!
I think the hysteria that hasn't subsided is the enthusiasm for alts. There's an ongoing debate over the actual value of relative garbage. This entire bear market seems to be centered around waiting for alts to make a decision about what's going to live and die. Until that's worked out, I don't think we have a lot of room to go up. The value of alts is still too linked to bitcoin, and there aren't enough tools to bet against the anchors that are holding us down. It's like having a dysfunctional cousin who doesn't stop calling you to borrow money.
It's cool when it's organic. BCashers spam it nonstop and not just in their own subs. For the stupidest content too. Plus, it's often a penny or two. That's just obnoxious (and seems to be viewed as such by the larger hive mind). The even have dedicating tipping threads, which, again, just distribute extremely small amounts to various accounts, which then get's spread across reddit. 

Then there's whole issue of making a fee-based model like Steemit. This seems like a terrible idea to me but that's a whole other conversation.
The first is much more zoomed out
You're right, not all the coins will survive (most won't), but the fact that you can make a pitch like this for, well I wouldn't say every but yeah most of top 100-200 coins on CMC at least is in no way bearish -- quite the opposite. There are in fact a *lot* of 'real world' companies cooperating with all these 'shitcoins' and not all of them are empty words and vaporware. I'd imagine that's one of the main reasons the bulls are so bullish longterm.

Don't downplay what you said. You're an anti-altcoin idiot who is trying to sound smart by pretending to be 'financially intelligent'.

And yet, people who trade with alts have more money than you will ever make.

I'm not upset, just trying to understand why a nobody like you would talk so much smack.
You just sounded a bit jaded by the last 6 months price action to me, rather than offensive, and believe me I’m right with you there.

Here’s to some better times to come, hopefully :)
Your past 5 comments have been pretty hilarious. 
Technology is solid, adoption is troublesome. Technology adoption is opportunistic. Many techs many not be needed until the society develops a need for them. Remember, internet itself was a novelty itself and even bill gates didn't think it would reach mass adoption. cryptocurrencies are just begining, I understand your concerns about Bitcoin, which is built on an unsustainable unscalable model, but new generation of cryptocurrencies will eventually reach adoption. Remember, this space was a novelty until ethereum came along. Many new concepts are being tested out that take time, but the big industries and players involved indicates the potential

The PnL on live positions is just of the open position, the final PnL will only be calculated when you close the position. 
I need to think whether or not makes sense to add to the live PnL the rest of the Pnl from the profit commands.
I've market closed on futures well under spot on the past 3 BGDs. I got wrecked on *the* BGD, though. 
Correct, however my point is that I might not have the opportunity to be long from $7,800 in the immediate future. 

The market could very will hit $6,900 before it hits $7,800. That's the scenario I'm avoiding by waiting for $7,800 before opening a long. 

"But Chewtoy, what's so special about $7,800? Can't you just keep having this internal debate every $200 to infinite?"

My answer to that question would be that $7,800 served as strong support and resistance on several occasions in recent memory. Moreso than any other horizontal value in the $7,000 to $8,000 range. If it breaks to the upside again, I'd expect to see it serve as strong support for at least awhile. 
Interesting theory and I can see how it can fit. At least one capitulation event I think, the space really needs to be flushed of the scams and BS before it really does go mainstream. 

You may well be right. I can't say I think that crypto market cap is anywhere near what it's worth. I think the crypto market cap should just be bitcoin so what I'm hoping this bear market will do is really clean the space up and get rid of these scams that are illiquid pieces of shit and we get back to 90-95% BTC dominance for crypto. Maybe that won't happen but that would give me the most confidence.

My view is that BTC is still an experiment it has potential as long as it doesn't fail but it has to build to scale and then it needs to actually scale via adoption. Now world currency is probably too far and is not as simple as people think. It could at very least become the dominant payment for the internet and it will always have the niche grey black markets that will probably grow their use of BTC as the new features make privacy that much easier to achieve. The main thing that makes me think it cant fail is it's built to run on peoples greed in every sense so if we achieve perfect secrecy then as long as there will be a reason for people to hide money there will be people looking for way to circumvent conventional channels and crypto is prime for that. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if the half the alt market is there to do nothing but wash dirty BTC money from early DNM days. There are other scenarios where I imagine a push based payment method is more convenient than a pull based payment method(game payments maybe)

Even ifit totally fails as a currency you would think having this insanely secure database would be useful for something right? I mean it went to 20K for a moment if not we need to go and spend a lot of time thinking about why the fuck that happened... 

The funny thing is I always believed in bitcoin but as the prices blew past my expectations (I thought we would top at 10K at very most last bullrun) and people 2x-10xing their money in a year or more and still complain it's not going up quick enough actually makes me incredibly bearish. The whole scene at the moment makes me feel incredibly bearish for bitcoin but bitcoin itself is just such a cool idea I think I'll have to put up with it. But I see no reason why BTC couldn't sit at 1.4-3K bottom for 2-3 years before kicking off another proper rally if the infrastructure (decentralized exchanges, protocol enhancements etc) really does build itself out, maybe it takes another 10 years to really get the levels that a lot of people think we deserve now progress in BTC is very slow but it's kind of a anti-fragility feature so these features need to be enticing enough and easy enough for joe public to use (probably through a trezor or ledger). I think things like HW wallets really make BTC easy to handle before those it was a fucking nightmare keeping backups and then backing it up again after using a transaction. It has come a long way it kind of need to pull off it tada moment in the coming years though to not remain a niche interest.
It fits I think, but as you can see from daily chart these are going more sideways down and sideways up before they puke out. This feels like mid-March. . . the little engine just can't make it up the hill and slides down.
Lmao at the tin foil but
Tomorrow it's also 6 of the 6th month. Let's just hope the pump isn't going to start at 06:00 tomorrow.
TL;DR?
I'm not sure if it happens more often, but it has to have happened here: Volume after was not at all significant and can't explain a 1200BTC sell, whereas the drop had pretty much exactly that volume.
Noticed that couple of times that longs/shorts update later than the move but never checked the exact minute, was watching 15/30m charts so just thought that the chart itself refreshed later.
On second thought, I might let this long ride a bit. 
Lol thanks. Probably gonna take profit here. Gonna think about whether to short here and set stops above 7600 or short at 7600 and add some more at 7700 with stops at 7800+. 
I'm not taking sides:

I disagree that the intent is to troll. I think that's a convenient label that's being applied to someone who is still learning how to contribute here. Contributors go through phases. We're either seeing an emerging analyst or an emerging troll. Antagonizing them predisposes them to trolling. Let's not do that.
All or nothing baby life is a game im not interesting in anything but moon or rock bottom there is no in between for me id rather die than lose
That is exactly what I am saying. They DO matter. You can't just ignore 6k because it was a wick. It's a price point that was hit, the highest volume came in at 6k and 6k is a much more important price point than 7k. 
Awesome just figured it out. Thanks! 
Kraken had them but they disabled when they had problems with performance. Thought they added them when they changed the engine.
Yo. Thanks a ton. z
My understanding was they don't work this way. For selling, I think the limit amount needs to be lower than the stop, doesn't it? For instance, stop order at 7350, limit 7300 (meaning when we drop below 7350 then market sell as close to 7350 as possible and stop trying if we fall below 7300). To my knowledge, it won't trigger if the limit sell is higher than the stop sell.
EDIT: I was referring to gdax.
kudos for apt use of "sucks the big one"
Agreed too many garbage and clutter that suffocate and hide legitimate projects. Thankfully ICO craze is being snuffed out. Now to wait for all those ERC20 tokens and bitcoins clones to die out. My compass are coins like XVG. When they die out or at least flat line for a good while, that's my que for a new bullrun with a thankfully thinned out market. Recent trend of 51% attacks on weak pow coins is promising.   
Yes, hard to read thru the noise.
I don't care about individuals on this subreddit so I don't have any personal concern here, but you're being way too belligerent in this message. Even if you disagree with this guy, it's healthy to hear contrary views. 
lol 
The intent of your message violates the spirit of rule 1. We're not looking to remove diversity. It doesn't matter how he chooses to communicate his thoughts. It matters how you do.

In any case, I seriously doubt Sloppy has ever communicated that some doesn't belong here.
I'm not calling YOU an idiot. There are idiots involved.  

Not every single person who touches an alt is a moron, and I didnt mean to imply that. 

I think it's funny that you're calling *me* elitist when the prevailing thought among crypto enthusiasts are that they're a genius leader of the free world, leading the sheep to freedom from the evil banking institutions. 

I don't like seeing people suckered out of their money. Lots of people I like here seem to have been burned and I don't think crypto is where financially illiterate/unstable people should be putting their money. 

I never claimed I was particularly financially literate- in fact, that is part of the reason I am hesitant to think that I got in on this thing early. I missed the train before 2017 and I'm hesitant to believe that I'm getting it this time around. 

Sure, if some great news comes out for bitcoin and we start seeing some major usage out of it I'll change my tune and turn around. Right now it's primarily a gambling token siphoning money off of shortsighted, impatient people. 

Anyway, apologies for cramming my filthy thoughts down your throat. It must have been difficult to be forced to read it 
> 
And yet, people who trade with alts have more money than you will ever make.

Mate, this comment and the sentiment behind it is exactly what he's talking about. Also, for there to be winners there has to be losers.
Haha yes, I can't say I'm not a little envious of those who invested in 2017 who can look at all this and say "yeah, this sucks but I'm still up 3000%"

Lol

You know what I thought of today? The largest correction btc saw from 2017 onwards was no bigger than...58% ATH. 

which means at any point, any time in the year! You could have longed at ~2.5x and not gotten liquidated. Literally at the top!!! And you'd have been fine until the dump to $10.8k in late December or whenever it was. Insane. 
ok then. 
I see your point - for example with mp3 players. It's just that they went through several iterations before becoming hugely popular. Who's to say digital currencies will be in the form of bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency? Perhaps it's all the right idea but someone will come along and make a better version?

I suppose that's what all the speculation over alts is about. 

But when when mp3 players weren't polished and refined they  had a very large use case and existed in some other form of lesser technology beforehand- Walkmans. 

Bitcoin/CCS are, as far as I understand, being used *less* than they were before this huge ol bull run. Why would we see a decrease in adoption/actual usage after such explosive growth? 
I mean even the final pnl isnt what I actually expected. 
7600 right now. Would it surprise you if we see 7400\-7500 levels before going to 8k? 7600 was kind of  a pivot point.
Question: Even if we break 7800, how do we know we won't be painting just another higher high before retracing again. It seems like every time the passed month that we break some resistance, it only goes slightly higher and puts a sort of bear flag on higher timeframes.
Ich you sold your coins at 7460 would you suggest buying back now or wait till 7800 falls ?
I agree with most everything you said! I don't  think bitcoin will really die. I just don't think it will be able to sustain these exorbitant prices for a long time, at least not until it sees significantly more usage. 

the price exploded on hype and the greater fool theory. that's not to say bitcoin should never be worth $6-20k or that everyone who invested is stupid...it's just that it was mainly being used for greedy speculation: to make money and get out before the next guy does. 

It's unsustainable long term. Btc will grow if the tech warrants it- there's no need for people to be so impatient and moonboi about it. For now, I think the space will slowly be purged like it was in 2014-15. The bottom may be higher (and could be here even) but the alt space makes me bearish. Once alts have finished their bubbling and hype cycle I will believe btc can grow again. 

Right now it's chock full of greedy speculators, scammers, and people trying to sell "the next big thing" 

legitimate stuff just doesn't grow like that. A solid foundation is necessary.

It's incredible that people think a 2 year bear market is somehow unimaginably long. Waiting  2 years to make 5000% returns again is absolutely fucking insane. People's greed within this space knows no bounds, it's amazing 
I wonder if the universe also runs on the UTC time-zone.
Human behavior is not random and repeats itself in an almost mathematically perfect way. Not going to write a whole text here, you should read it yourself, it's good. 
Hmm I will look into this later. Thanks! I actually thought for a second that there's gotta be more than 2 shorts and 8 longs opened after a $70 drop just from limit orders. So I think you're right 
Good call again! (I'm also holding on to my long from earlier today.)
What I'm saying though is it makes a difference whether its a wick or not. It COULD still be a triple bottom because not much stock should be put into such a short timeframe in the wick from 7-6k. Flash crashes should generally be ignored when looking at macro chart patterns. 
Know anyone with funding? I'm pretty sure I can orchestrate a huge 51% attack on 5 - 10% of the total shit projects in a few months with a relatively small amount of funding. Just can't take the time off work without selling cold storage. Someone with deep pockets and a valid  Bitmex account could really capitalize on the the advance knowledge. Maybe I should make a go fund me page.
Sure it is, but go through his comments. He's not debating, he's literally calling people stupid, idiots, and financially illiterate just because they bought alts.

He also called Bitcoin a gambling token that takes money from stupid people.

I'm very open to having a normal discussion, but this guy is just lippy.
There's two types of people in this space. The people who take opportunities and the filth that talks shit, FUD's all day, and pretends like they are above all of this until they FOMO in and lose money.

You're the latter, my friend. I suggest you learn a few things before you enlighten us all with your knowledge again.

Crypto isn't a casino. It's a billion dollar industry that grows every single day. Stop pretending like you're playing a slot machine, it only makes you look stupider. 

Also if you had any sense of measurement, you'd know how laughable calling a 300 billion market peaked out and full of 'dumb money' is.
People get very angry when their hopes and dreams are threatened.
Yeah but why are we calling alt investors idiots? That makes everyone here look bad, because that's the exact type of mentality that we don't need.

There are people who lose everywhere. However, if you have invested in a solid cryptocurrency and you don't panic, odds are you will NOT be one of the losers.

He's the type of kid to pretend the market has reached it's peak and is dying now. It's not true.
I'll see what happened tomorrow 
Lol, okay I read that. That all sounds like a load of crap, tbh, and it sounded like the author agrees. I don't doubt that cycles exist, but to pin them to one or two variables is silly. Ultimately emergent phenomena are still fully reduceable to their constituent parts. 
We might see a bullish reversal which is why I’m still holding onto my longs. 
A flash crash is something like what happened with ETH on GDAX when it went from $300 to 10 cents for a split second. The bottom at 6k is not a flash crash, it is a legitimate price point where the buying kicked in. But think of it however you want, lol
By the time I get the funding someone else will do it. It's just a matter of time. God bless nicehash.
Man they turn on a homie real quick.. To be fair I called people morons which is pretty mean and elitist. But to be even more fair, I consider myself one of those morons. I just feel like I wisened up before I could do any real damage. Bought in right before the melt up and sold at breakeven on the pop, feel like I got lucky on that front
I don't think he is a kid. Kid's don't think like him.  He speaks as someone with a bit of life experience. 

I posted a [comment](https://reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ontzj/daily_discussion_tuesday_june_05_2018/e0577hz/?st=ji1nf706&sh=cda1eb2e) somewhere above with regards to why *everyone* should be skeptical of the alt space.

Research Pets.com and the .com bubble.  And look at the coinmarketcap link in my other comment for a counter point to your view.  It's good to be at the very least a little skeptical.
It could also be back in the ascending channel. If so, I reckon we might see $7900, and then go down. But it would be nice if this is a reversal. 
You're very mistaken about the kid part.

A kid would type impulsively and talk about things he knows nothing about.

He mentioned in another comment that he didn't consider himself to be 'financially literate' and was going around calling people 'financially illiterate'. 

Plus his post history is full of Pokemon Go, on top of some amateur questions.

Sounds like a kid to me, bud.

I'm plenty skeptical, but I can't debate with people who keep bringing up the .com bubble with a straight face. You're in a 300 billion market. How can you even logically justify comparing where we are with the .com? You're getting WAY too ahead of yourself.
7614 right now. Tempted to add to my long positions because 7600 is proving to be a good line of resistance.

r/r for a separate long with stop loss at 7580 looks real good.
Sure the market cap is a fraction of that of the .com bubble.  But so is the blockchain real world adoption and use-case comparative to the internet at that time.

These two things will move up in sync.  But there will be crashes and bear markets along the way regardless.
Miniature crashes, sure. But 90% altcoin death? Not quite yet, man.

Bring up that theory when we hit a few Trillions in market cap, at the VERY LEAST.
Did you look at my link? Only 3/40 coins from 2014 are still relevant.  So 92.5% died in the last crash.

It doesn't seem unlikely that, that pattern could repeat, multiple times over the next 10-20 years.

Anyway, you sound like you're more knowledgable than you initially came across, internet arguments can do that sometimes.  My point was being skeptical can be important. So i hope you take that on board.

Good luck with your investing dude!
Alright, you too.
