[Daily Discussion] Thursday, July 05, 2018 -- TITLE
#New post: [\[Daily Discussion\] Friday, July 06, 2018 →](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8wh1a9/daily_discussion_friday_july_06_2018/)
[VolumeRSI (VRSI) analysis, amateur TA intended to explore this odd indicator to see if it's indicative of market trend in a low volume, BART driven market.](https://www.marketvolume.com/technicalanalysis/volumersi.asp) In a nutshell: RSI weighted by volume of buy/sell pressure, which I thought might be a stronger indicator of market movement post bubble.

My previous comments nearly two weeks ago (oops): [https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8sydvj/daily\_discussion\_friday\_june\_22\_2018/e13m628/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8sydvj/daily_discussion_friday_june_22_2018/e13m628/)

And [what I'm looking at in regards to the long-term.](https://imgur.com/a/q6SpMeE)

My general observations:

* It was a 'quick jaunt to goblin town' as I described, but that local bottom was 5.7k.
* Weekly VRSI bottomed out around 34.5 in that candle, but bumped hard to 40. A pseudo rejection of approaching oversold?
* Essentially people sold hard (capitulation from a significant crowd or whale? You decide) but it was bought into hard enough to reverse the weekly VRSI in the same time frame.
* This is similar to the action from week commencing 4th June, where we dumped from \~8.7k to \~7.2k. VRSI actually crept up in the end, as the buy volume actually ate up the selling pressure.
* Normal ol' weekly/monthly RSI is sitting low but not 'record low'. Record low occurs in our 'horrid bear market of 2014/2015. VRSI *is at a record low* and was never as low as this in 2014/2015.

In conclusion: If (that's a big IF) VRSI is a useful indicator, we're in unknown territory, except to say it can't go *much* lower. Every time we dump, someone is snapping the sell volume eagerly. I know it's a tin foil hat mentality, but I don't think Joe-Blogs and his mates are buying in such volume right now, so I am inclined to say this a long drawn our period of accumulation.

A drop below 30 of the weekly VRSI (which would put our weekly RSI at \~35, not quite oversold) would suggest to me that VRSI is *not* a useful indicator. If we never revisit \~5.7k then I'll consider it a useful TA tool for post-bubble crypto analysis.

And until it's wrong, [Moon Math](https://www.moonmath.win/), it's right. As I've spoke [about before](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8uq6eg/daily_discussion_friday_june_29_2018/e1i0dbt/) the fact that this was so regularly consulted during the bull run and then almost immediately discarded in the bear market of 2018 is rather short sighted. It said (even at 20k) that a drop to our current price was perfectly reasonable and consistent with the logarithmic long term price rise of BTC.

Also $5 says that today is super boring, price action wise.
still long, consider this bullish until at least $6,350 gets painted 
Why are these wicks so long?
Might be irrelevant with all the other things going on, but I thought I'd mention that the pattern of higher highs, higher lows since 6/29 is intact if this was the dump: latest low 6445, prior to that 6413. (Edit: grammar)
306 comments as of now. During 2014/15 lows we got perhaps 200-300 per day. Perhaps a metric in itself. 
Opening a hedge short here. [Price is struggling to hold the line.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/tFY5j2c4/)  Stops all the way at $7k.  If bulls can push it that far in this part of the run then God bless them. 
Take this as you want but it seems like there was a huge influx of funding money that arrived at BFX. The loan offering wall was usually at 1-2M, and currently is at 12M.

The current lending rate is also at a record low (6 times less than a day ago) and there was plenty of $ borrowed. 

In contrast, the funding rates for alts are increasing. I don't remember a time when it was more expensive to borrow BTC, compared to USD (though, I really don't have a long track record for BTC lending rate) 
Almost $100 difference between CB and CMC, that’s kinds bizarre. Also “BigONE” exchange is number one in volume, which is even more bizarre 
 
Edit: A little research - BigONE first launched 1.11.2017 with many grammar mistakes and shit FB page(rocking 273 likes), my scam sense is tingling hard

Edit 2: Link to BigONE exchange which says the daily volume is 78k - https://big.one/trade/BTC-USDT
Uhhh what’s happening....???
Bearish divergence makes me want to close my longs, but what stops me from doing that is that btc broke the bottom line of the ascending wedge, yet the price didn't go much lower. I'd assume that if it wanted to go more down then it would have by now, but maybe it just needs a little more time.

If i wasn't in a position myself i'd definitely wait this one out. 

Edit: closed at 6580
deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.5278  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/61957)
So I have a question. If pushing the price up means someone buying at a higher price (let’s say on bitfinex for example) ..why doesn’t whoever stagger tiny buys at (6501 ; 6502 ; 6503 etc) in succession to trigger a bull run (or a bear dump)?
Thinking of settling a bit of my long that I've held strong since $7,100 oh so many moons ago...

Should've sold at $7.8

Daily reminder not to get greedy, boys.

If you've had a good run, take your profits!
Interesting discussion post about the new rule China placed: [https://www.reddit.com/r/InvestingCrypto/comments/8w80c3/lets\_talk\_about\_chinas\_new\_rule\_to\_gauge/](https://www.reddit.com/r/InvestingCrypto/comments/8w80c3/lets_talk_about_chinas_new_rule_to_gauge/)
Seems like we're having trouble breaching 6700 so far today.
Longs are starting to close out, could be sideways action from here for a while:  https://imgur.com/a/I6CWUNx

ETA: To clarify, by sideways I mean in the current range (6400-6800) for maybe a few days at most. It's not a comment on the macro trend.
Well, somebody had enough of that bear's shit.
[Anyone know whats up with this bot that just spams buy/sell orders for $66 on gdax (now CB pro)?](https://imgur.com/a/rsa2uS3)

Im very glad someone is tanking the trading fee but I wonder what the point of it is.

Edit: adding up the trading fees, it's costing someone about $1.60 a second to keep this thing going. $138,240 a day.
The weekly seems to have bounced off the lower band and are forming something of a bearflag/ pennant. 
4 hour chart of the xbt/usd has a potential to have a head shoulders.am i correct? 
Just reminding everyone that Trump's tariff's are set for midnight tonight and China's expected to retaliate immediately. This is going to be the middle of the day for them. 

This might do absolutely nothing for bitcoin, but it might be a catalyst for a green candle. Something to keep an eye out for. 
Hidden buy wall at $6501 on Finex, on mobile so I can't tell how much has sold into it.
Current position: 100% Crypto, 0% Fiat. Not looking to open another trade in this 6400-6800 range, just posting my perspective. If we break up, great, if we break down, great. I'm simply taking a few weeks off the buy/sell triggers.


-I am placing a lot of emphasis on the ascending support from 5800. To stay above this line, we will need to breach 6800 by the 8th (on the daily). Hopefully this breaks. 


-We recently breached to the upside of our Bollinger Bands on the 1D. This is a bullish indicator in my book, as historically when we cross to the upside it seem to be a short-term continuation indicator. I do interpret this indicator differently than traditional markets, but if you look at it on the 1D, it is apparent that ***every time*** we break above the midline, we see a short-term bull movement. This should not be overlooked. 



Not a lot, but that is what I have been looking at. As usual, not investment advice, trade at your own risk, wrap it up. Rock on everybody and remember to live life. 
- We broke the downtrend trendline from early May. 

- Stochastic RSI on the weekly turned bullish.

- MACD on the 3D turned bullish.

- The market does not care about that wedge.

- We found support on the 21D EMA

Ans still a lot of people short this "suckers rally"
It seems like BTC is most likely going to break down from the ascending wedge (generally bearish) and form a potential inverse head and shoulders. Wave 2 is due... looking to refill at $6300 area.
a good indicator which might be useful is that prior to the 10K top, a massive selloff of most top20 alts happened. So imo as long as a lot of those alts get pumped, i dont think this BTC rally will end yet.
[so many longs underwater](https://i.imgur.com/m1T051G.png) 
What would be a good estimate for time preference in this space?

Year per doubling?
Btc daily ma7 currently above ma25 on binance (pending daily close). But eth is still struggling to break above ma25 (currently 481). Is this BTC leading eth? Might eth drag BTC down if it fails to break above? Not sure how much stock to put in the MAs here
Anyone got that meme wedge? Isn't it starting to look a bit like a channel after today?
What's up with BTCUSDSHORTS? It's dropping like crazy, but I don't see a shortsqueeze.
We've broken down from the ascending channel(wedge) we were in. Next support level is at 6411 on coinbase. Drop below that, and it gets spicy.

https://www.icoexaminer.com/ico-news/binance-and-huobi-show-100-jumps-as-crypto-exchange-trading-volumes-demonstrate-signs-of-recovery/

I can't vouch for the source.
Last time Bitcoin exploded out of a bear market was so exciting and hilarious. The panic and fear and excitement at those huge green dildos that just kept rising to 20k was so much  fun. Can't wait for it to happen again.
Some quick thoughts from my end. Slowly adding to my long positions with generous stop losses. 

3D MACD is once again curving upwards and it looks like it will flip positive at the next candle. So far we’ve had three in a row on larger volume than the two previous attempts to bounce. I think it will most likely extend to a few more green candles.
Maybe not so bad buy here, considering how fast the move a few hours ago moved up from 6500 range
Mr Gorbatchev, tear down this wall
short 6570...just went below 4hr tenkan, if it stays below it could go quite a bit lower

edit : this is on the ichimoku cloud, settings are 20/60/120/30
I’m thinking another day of rally and rejection from 6800s, another pin bar daily close, then we break down over weekend to low 6ks.
Hard to tell if the action is bullish or bearish because btc and eth are split:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/c4CFkKLi/

If you look at only ETH (on the right) you'll see its continuing the pattern, and has already retraced 50% of the losses sustained from the last drop and touched the 12 EMA. That indicates we're close to the next drop.

Looking at BTC, shows a 100% retrace and its broken from the channel its been in. It also has gone past the 26 EMA, which it hasn't done for 2 months.

I'm not betting anything on this action because its not clear cut to me, but if I had to bet, I'd say next leg down is coming. Don't see us touching the top bband.
We're probably not going to see much movement for the next 2 days or so as price approaches the weak part of the 12h kumo. I can't be certain, but I'm fairly confident bulls will attack this area, and we'll see a BGD for a kumo breakout. Of course, this is a very specific scenario, so how could this possibly happen, amirite? 😉 😉

Mainstream FUD is reaching comical levels. Look at this one from New York Post: [https://nypost.com/2018/07/04/why-bitcoin-may-be-soon-worth-nothing/](https://nypost.com/2018/07/04/why-bitcoin-may-be-soon-worth-nothing/) It doesn't even put forward a single argument. It just states that BTC is a worth zero because it's a Ponzi scheme and that's about it.
Fundstrat's Tom Lee vs /u/peacehere

Who would win?
If the market stays steady for the next few hours I might place a cautious long. Feels like we are coming out of the scary woods. 

Infact, I might be seeing a bullish divergence on the 1Day RSI (breaking the RSI high from June 7th, but not the price) 
3D PSAR flipped to the downside. That's usually a strong indication we're just getting started here.

However, in the next 3-4 days I expect us to go down to around ~6.2k (accumulation zone).
Sorry for the late update. I’ve been in the clinic all day, so I don’t have the time to fully justify my position at the moment. However, I opened a 5% 10x short at $6620 on Sept futures short yesterday since it looked like we were either forming a bearish wedge or an IH&S - both indicating the need for a slight retrace. I added another 5% at $6675, both to DCA in, and because price was going up while alts were going down (a bit of a divergence in my mind if you track my positions).

I wanted to give a s/o to u/veltrop for pushing me to start scaling out of positions, as I closed half at  $6569 to lock in some profits (which I already update on positionbot by PM), but figured this had some downside left and wanted to make a little extra off the top. I close the rest at $6444. This could always drop down close to $6300, but I’m happy with my profits and don’t have the time to babysit my position right now.

!short xbtu18 close 6444
So uh if the the daily chart looks bullish but the weekly chart looks bearish which should i prioritize? I honestly have no idea about trading so what do expert traders use as a rule of thumb?

What about the hourly etc? Should longer time frames be prioritized? Also why do people use the 1hr and others use the 4hr, 6hr? Do they switch whenever they need to confirm their bias or do they have a valid reason?
600 sell wall at 6580, 1350 sell wall at 6581.

!long btcusd 6580 10X 10%
I know I'm being picky here, but that drop to $6500 really should have dropped more if it were forming an IH&S. Instead, it looks like we just added another point on the new bearish wedge pattern. I'm still looking for a bigger retracement before we manage to break through $6800. Though I'm not convinced, and would love to be proven wrong. Therefore, this short is just a very small position in case the last squeeze was a fakeout (that massive wick + lower high concerns me).

!short xbtu18 6620 10x 5%
Had a nightmare just now that this drop turned out to be a fakeout followed by a BGD to 8500. My Mex account balance was almost 0 from shorting. I ~~can only imagine~~ could indirectly experience the horror that shorters felt in early April.

And I need a good quality sleep. Why am I dreaming about this.. :(
OK so the daily isn't looking great we are stuck on 30D MA and tonight the 3D closes(I think) which is currently showing a doji which has been a good top indicator on the 3D in the bear times. We literally touched the breakdown level I had on my chart to the wick of the minute candle so I can't really see us going any further. Things are starting to look up IMO but I think we just need to breakdown and fill in some sub 6K volume exhaust as much indicators as we can and then bounce hard to from 4.5-5 to 7-8K and fill in the LVNs on the way but I think (IE no evidence or TA to display behind this thought) we will get stuck at 8.2 (if we make it there) and possibly fall into the 3-5K range over the coming quarter.

I haven't really looked at the Ichi since the weekly broke down through a very thin cloud after a bearish TK cross as well as longer term MAs starting to move down quicker but the TDI is on a weekly 8 ideally we want to max out the bearish momentum next week to close under 6500 before making any big rallies to the upside otherwise we could be sitting in undecided land again.
Strange price action today - the market seems to have changed somewhat to me on this last mini rally. Seems to be less stagnation in the prices, even though the volume still isn’t great.

Interesting how these phases change - the huge bart phases, the unwatchably boring phases where prices refuses to move for days, and this which seems to be a little more volatile and seems to move up more easily.

I’m not an expert so don’t know what it means, but it makes me optimistic that this time may be different, as the action seems to have shifted to me.
This is really confusing. The charts seem to indicate a continuation of the uptrend but the longs are crazy high. There's a potential for long squeeze, as difficult ad that may be
[removed]
Both BGD from yesterday and 2 days ago where exactly on the same hour. Can we expect another BGD soon? 
2000btc sell wall being moved down with the price on Finex, was at 6600, now at 6590.

What happened to all the longs?
Last two Pump-o'-clock at 15:00 CET (that's in 35 minutes from now). Probably won't happen again but take note.

EDIT: it's actually alternating days, so if you believe in this maybe tomorrow
On my phone but checked the chart earlier and there are some bear divs on the 4hr ... would love to see this move to 6.9k first as it would be a ideal short setup, but suspect we’re heading to 6.4k range first.   This impulse up has treaded 1k and so a retrace is in order soon. 

If this plays out like the April fractal, this will be a potentially good buying opportunity.  If we see a sustained move below this range, however, I’ll be more inclined to believe that we’ll be digging more trenches down to Goblin Town. 
This price action is giving me cancer. Go up or go fucking down please.

Those who wanted to long are already long. Those who wanted to short are already short. Those who wanted to sit out have already sit out
Took profit on my 10x short...can't babysit the position and I don't like the market action

going to take a few days off i think

good luck out there
https://nypost.com/2018/07/04/why-bitcoin-may-be-soon-worth-nothing/

This came up in my Google feed today. How is this even considered an article? 

Edit: I see this was posted below. New York Post is a joke I guess. 
Ooh god were back to range trading between plus or minus 150 bucks again? Wake me when the price goes parabolic again. I'm not looking to wait around babysitting a position to try and scalp 2%.
Do you think this yellow line is valid? If it is, there might be a resistance at 6,630.

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/KgmNcK6G/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/KgmNcK6G/)

Edit: 6,600 is in general was quite important level and this line can only add some more pain for bulls.
!short xbtusd 6565 5x 25&#37;

Going short here and going to scale more in if the price keeps dropping.
Can anyone refute this? If the compelling arguments within are true, bitcoin has basically had it.

https://nyp.st/2MQYm0H

Edit: Just in case the downvotes are from people who think I’m serious (I’m not) instead of just an unfunny twat (mostly true), this was sarcasm. One of the worst articles I’ve ever read, but a look at what we’re up against with the normies.
These prices are looking vulnerable, no follow through from bulls up to this point.

In addition to that, looks like he bought back in.

Dump it to $6400 in short order and trap a few more dip buyers.
Im still seeing rising volume since early May, I think we will test the the 6800 resistance again. Will hedge there hoping we break through. Long here stops at 6400.

!long xbtusd 6483 5x 25%

damn, the entire last week now look like a bull trap
Never heard of the exchange called BIG ONE.... apparently new and has more volume than Binance and Bitfinex combined on BTC/USD pair.

Is that legit of fake volume? thoughts?
Closed my long from 6300 at 6470. Was open for a while so pretty much a wash. Obvious that this a-hole is going to keep dumping so I'll enter another long at some point, maybe 6K if it goes there again which I kinda doubt.
To the people that are bullish and opened margin long positions, aren't you scared shitless that there is 14k more longs than shorts?  
Not sure just how significant this is, but this is the first 6h candle to open below EMA12 this month, and it's (currently) red.
I'm ready for bitcoin to die so it can rise again.
Getting tired of the inverse h&s meme https://imgur.com/a/vAbfVLG
hi master traders~ i buy high sell low... to usdt, then when it breaks out, i put back in again and set a stop loss, then it goes down again..
long story short i have lost 25% of my stack in these few days.... 
:facepalm: and this shorting business should i learn about it? is it more profitable than buy and sell at exchange?
Can someone please tell me how to see the positions on the position bot as well as add my own position?

Thank You! :D
still short and moved my bids down to the 6200 level for now. looks like its getting ready to roll over.

I've heard that experienced traders consider 1-2% movements as "noise", but also if someone can manage sustained gains of 1% per day that is very good. Isn't that a contradiction? If scalping "noise" pays off, what's to complain about?

Correction: In this scenario, let's I say 1% gains per day as a standard but a few bad trades ( down 10-15%) from time to time. Also: apologies if this question has been asked many times before, but looking at responses (below) it seems to interest at least some of us.
14mins for this bart to close around 6340
Long from 6467
this is the third failed trial to break up today. I am tempted to short this but still afraid of taking a position.

Edit1: watching https://datamish.com, shorts/longs are not changing much, have been following this for days now... although Longs are way more than shorts.

Edit2: 4th attempt rejected, for what is worth, the last 2 pumps all happened around this time of the day, and they created instant FOMO, but this one is getting huge resistance.
Hidden bull div on the 4hr chart. Flat bottom so not a very strong signal and another small move down will wash it out. 

5m looks to forming a bearish pennant as well, which would confirm the breakdown if it plays out. Shorter time frame though so not as reliable.
Is that descending triangle? Or I made this all up?  PS. I am bad in geomerty

Down to 6.1 form inv H+S, return to 7.6

When in doubt, zoom out.
It's a weird one, but it's a Head&Shoulders (on the 15 min).

Having said this, they rarely behave like they're supposed to...
eh this is breaking down...
It has begun
If I were looking to do a big buy ($20 mil+) I'd let it drop down to 6500 or so before dropping the hammer. It's pretty clear that Big Shorty found more coins to sell at a discount. Let the minnows eat up his ammo, then blammo.

But that's just me.

I recently bought a small real amount at 6561.

Of course this happens 
We must take comfort in the fact that while BTC continues its decline, it will never be worthless.  The chain will always be running on a machine somewhere, and there will always be greater fools.
The red candles are so small and flaccid for the amount of money it costs to create them. The same volume gets you a BGD 3x the size of the  little red limpdick these guys seem to enjoy. Lol.

Alts are falling hard.
Soo... why have traders suddenly decided that btc is worth no more than 6700, and no less than 6550?
Wow huge surprise big dump. I think the problem is everyone DID look too much into BTC and learned too many inconvienent truths. They still dont even have a safe way  to transfer money to the correct account. Just pray you dont mess up. No average user will ever adopt it. The fees are still no where comparable to centralized methods.

Sorry for the inconvenient truth bombs.

The thing about the Moon Math is I remember the creator constantly redrawing it almost weekly/monthly because it wasn't accurate. Assuming growth slows down over time as more people become aware and prices get high, its reasonable to assume that the current iteration of his chart won't stay accurate forever.

in 2014, the slope of the rainbow covered the run-up to 1.1k. Now he just cut the whole bubble off of the chart lol.
The moon math shows that we spent an extended period of time in the dark blue band of the chart during the two other large bear markets.  But in this bear market, we haven't even touched that same blue band.  IMHO, my interpretation of the moon math says we have a little more ways to go in terms of falling.
Same, and my stops are a little below there.
I think you might do alright, but I got cold feet during today's dump. This dude is flashing some big walls which means he has a lot of coins to dump.
If the meme IH&S is to play out now, price could wick 6.15k and that would be bullish AF if it bounces back up. 

Right now the 4hr ichi cloud spans 6.15-6.3k. 
Indecision between mad cow and bear steak. Both are strongly defending their territories.
To fuckover as many stop losses as possible rekting both bears and bulls
Lots of indecision right now
Yep I made a small long play off of these numbers. That and we get another good looking daily candle close if it can hang on for a few more minutes. 
Nice, we're gonna late night sneaky uncle our way to an ATH. Very un- bitcoin, but I'll take it. 
Just not a lot to talk about in these moments, all the experienced traders usually have already taken their positions and aren't interested in trying to TA the daily noise 
I'm surprised considering there were 15-20 thousand users signed up back then. 

I'm pretty sure there were days where there were less than 100.

Is there a simple way of accessing any old daily discussion you want? Reddit seems to be hopelessly shit for it. 
Shouldn't we be looking at this line? (ignore the downtrend line running through it)- [https://www.tradingview.com/x/LwAHjAuq/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/LwAHjAuq/) (but really doesn't change what's happening)
You're drawing the wrong line.
I would take this to mean there is a lot of money sitting on the sidelines at ‘finex. If lending rates stay this low for long enough, some lenders may pull their funding in favor of using the money for trading. 
With all those longs they need cheap funding. I'm not really expecting a long squeeze until the price is under 5600.
BigONE is backed by xiaolai li, china's #1 BTC holder purportedly at one time owned 6 figures of bitcoin (actual coins, not fiat value). He's butthurt about not being able to overtake binance and was recorded on a private wechat channel saying shit about everyone involved with Binance, NEO, and a bunch of other bigwigs.

Anyway, he's starting to resort to all kinds of illegal shit to get his exchange on top of Binance cuz he knows that's where the real money is. His recorded convo is widely published on chinese twittersphere and the nig isn't sitting pretty, burned a lot of bridges outting former partners and how he helped them get their scam ICO's done. 

He targeted Justin Sun, not smart, as that nigga is connected to the highest echelons in china's political circles. That means xiaolai's game is probably over in china and all of his investments, BigONE included.
Wtf is going on with that? 
Click on Bitcoin and select 'Native' instead of USD. You will see that all exchanges have roughly the same prices. Thought it would be a difference between USDT/USD, but that price difference is insignificant now. Not sure what's going on.

Perhaps use https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/btc/markets/USD for a better BTC/USD indicator.
I feel like since nobody has a clue about where this is going everyone just jumps on the bandwagon wherever it moves. I mean you can say that for every move in every asset but I think its pretty apparent right now. We drop below 6,6? SELL EVERYONE, THIS IS GOING TO 3k. Back above 6,6? BUY EVERYONE, BACK TO 20k!!!!!!
No one has a clue. Welcome to crypto!
Fakeout. It's pretty typical for BTC whales to pull this shit. 
ETH is not looking so good, might be enough to drag this down some more
you can't buy or sell at an arbitrary price, you can only buy or sell at the best available price on the other side of the order book. So trading at 6502 (to use your example) means buying all the volume available at 6501. Therefore it's quite expensive to buy all the volume to push the price higher, especially since that means you're getting hit with the taker fee at the same time. 

Further, the market exists at many different exchanges, so you need to do it at more than one place simultaneously. This adds to the expense and the difficulty of achieving it. 

There's also the risk that your bluff gets called, perhaps because of a strong organic movement the other direction that happens to occur at the same time you are trying to catalyze a price increase.

In all likelihood, some people are able to pull it off and are, but it's a very risky and expensive endeavor. 
Probably because no one wants to pay more than the current price? If it's selling for 6450 now why would you buy for 6501? 

If you really think this will work and you're selfless, go buy bitcoin at +100 or +200 the current price and if you can keep it up the price will go up for sure. Be the change you want to see in the world. 
Probably a dumb question

Look ugly potential h and s pattern, but yeah, it may form. First it needs to challenge 6680 first then fail, then it need to retest 6425 and break it, and then it may need to retest the neckline at 6425 again. Too much uncertainty so I will just skip it.
I don't see it. Post a chart with it drawn out.

[Here](https://www.tradingview.com/x/v2ZSqQhD/) is a good example of H&S.
What is really interesting is if bitcoin reacts differently than equity markets. That is the million dollar question. 
Why green and not red?
OTC, Hong Kong, and okex fiat to token, huobi fiat to token will be affected. CNY has been weak, down 3% in two weeks. Further currency weakness could allow BTC to gain some ground 
keeping one exchange above the others is a pretty expensive way to buy a lot of btc

While the market does look pretty bullish, most of your gains have already happened imo. Can't go straight down, we must build more longs to stop out first. Everybody and their grandma wants to long the bottom, but when everyones long it gives bears too much ammo in the bear market.

> Ans still a lot of people short this "suckers rally"

Yes every rally this year has been a suckers rally...every single one...100% of them.

But this time it's different...crazy to short this rally.  Why would someone possibly do that?
"The market does not care about that wedge". True for the support line. However, the resistence is pretty well respected so far. The pump yesterday stopped exactly at the line, creating a 4. contact point.
If we go down .... a few Bucks then the Shorts will come up and Say ... they Short...
I'll wait to see if we won't go straight through 6.3k when everyone tries to see the same pattern it never happens.
Are you comparing bitcoin at 10K to bitcoin now at 66xx? 
Alts ratios are down this morning but I don’t feel like this is similar to the 10K bull run.

WTF if "time preference".   
It doesn't look like anything at all.

Only thing workable here is horizontal support/resistance zones imo.
From wedging to sideways movement? sounds like divergence to me.
It looks to me like all those shorts were closed into that massive 1700BTC sell wall at 6590ish.
someone(s) closed into that \~2k sell wall.

Edit:  And I would love to hear some theories as to what that was about. I'm pretty noobish, I've never seen action quite like that before. 
Crikey, so they are.
Bitfinex has so long been the standard that I check for volume that I wouldn't even know what normal is at huobi and binance, as much as I'm sure that they have comparable if not bigger volume. 
Don't hold your breath.
You will have plenty of time to wait.
It was lifted, price blasted through... and then the order book on the buy side didn't fill in.
We havent closed below the tenkan yet be careful. 
Well-timed to say the least.
Nice one! When will you cover?
i've been following the same too. most of the alts can't break of the downtrend but bitcoin is showing an initial breakout.

bitcoin has to leave them behind...

6 sentences = an article? what a waste of resources
Seems like a stretch to call that an article, it's a opinion piece about 6 sentences long.
I've never heard of Fundstrat or Tom Lee, but I googled him and see that he is forecasting new ATH, so of course my prediction (no ATH) is highly probable to be correct, rather than his.
I vote for PeaceHere because he sounds more confident and masculine than Tom Lee... mhmmmmm his way of being dominant is just like how BTC is rough with alts. 
That's called a "hidden bearish divergence".
even within the larger falling wedge, the ceiling is >$7000 so i expect bullish trading towards that point, and then another test of the resistance at $6k as we stay in the channel a bit longer

im bullish on where the price will be in 3-6mos from now though
Maybe I’m mistaken, but I thought divergences couldn’t be used with a low in-between? There was a bit of a dip between June 7th and now.
BTC is painting something that looks like a [rising wedge](https://imgur.com/a/EVBiWcE) on the charts. If this is correct, price could drop when it breaks down. I would wait a bit to see how this plays out before going long at this point. On the bullish side: There is an apparent bull flag, and the 3D MACD is about to turn green.

Glad it worked out for you!

On my side, glad I took half profits on longs at 6700, since all but one of them are stopped out now!  (though I should have scaled out more than I did)


1hr is mainly used for when you want to enter a trade and are looking more closely on the price action.

4hr gives pretty good feedback on any pattern that may be playing out.

1D is the same way but on a bigger time scale and gives the overall gen trend. 

1W Same as above but longer time frames. I'll use the 1D and 1W to check in on the trade I made a few days ago etc.

I don't really trust that potential inverse H&S. Even if we go back to ~6200 and bounce a bit, it just looks too ugly. I feel if we break through the 6300 range it's gonna be goblin town again, too many longs gonna get panicky. Only hope for up is some more sideways here and then a really strong move up breaking through 6800-7200 in one go.
It could happen. You'd have to have been in this game six months or less to think it couldn't.  Listen to your dreams. Go long and sleep well because you know we're not going to zero and what goes down must come up.

Not my charts.
OBV divergence indicates that the rise in price is more substantially related to cash markets.

Maybe you should zoom out.  I see no uptrend.  I see a small blip that does't even register on long term charts in what now amounts to 7 months of consistent decline.  I think to call this an uptrend is grasping at straws.

Lmao, why does the article even include this line? He’s already said it was called Bitcoin twice before. And besides you generally only say “which I like to call...” when you’re not calling something by it’s real name. 


Even without that oddly specific thing I noticed, this is still the dumbest “article” I’ve seen all year.

This is kinda what they drill into normies heads about BTC. The reality is the opposite. Bitcoin is backed by **everyone** in the network.

So yeah, for any of your friends not understanding the irony, this is the simplest argument you can use to counter such statements.
if a person thinks the backed by nothing argument is a real argument, then this said person doesnt understand bitcoin and should start at square one. or better leave it alltogether.

No. What we have right now is a bear trap. There's a LOT of money sitting on the sidelines waiting for this guy to dump it down to 6K again.
Until I see evidence that says otherwise, I'm adding it to the list of fake top volume for a day or so exchanges as of late.  Coinbene, etc.
Sounds fake... No ones heard of it. Are the trades free? If thats the case it's all fake volume.
I like how u just taunted someone for shorting and then closed your long lol 
Lol this is that 6300 trade that you have kept open for weeks and had ample opportunity to close much higher, regardless I'm actually shocked that you closed a long in general.

Congrats on the successful trade
Good move, I was hoping you'd hodl that long back to 5800 again, but you are more bark than bite.
Look at Ripple longs vs shorts. It is more expensive to have short position as I understand not a margin trader.

honestly you're better off holding and working hard on your career/education. only a tiny tiny portion ever 'make it'
If you buy high sell low when you long then you're just gonna sell low and buy high when you short...

Learn to trade first, then go margin.
Try patience and high sells and low buys then hold
only if you want to loose the remaining 75% :)

Just kidding dude, get a strategy, stick to your plan and dont overleverage to win your losses back
Use the bitmex testnet for a while if your track record of regular trades isn't great. Testnet's 'play money' will disconnect your emotions from the trades and get you playing the game objectively
Google "trading risk management". If you are new to trading look at your losses as a tuition fee. Takes years of actual experience to get rational control of your emotions.
Once you lose 25% like you did reduce your position size by 50%. Maximize the number of trades you are allowed to fail in a row. Stay the fuck away from margin and shorting until you have a clue about what you are doing.

Its possible to recover from a 75% loss, its not possible to recover from a 100% loss.
Trading isn't for everybody or most
It's important to never risk 100%. Never.

No. The direction of noise is not predictable.
You also need to consider how much time and stress it will take to constantly be scalping. The best thing I know is to open a trade at the right time and to completely step away from the charts for a day or two (with good risk management in place of course).
I think it's meant as 1&#37; per day averaged out over the long run (from bigger wins spread apart more), not steadily making \~1&#37; every day from scalps
1% daily is more than 3500% annually, warren buffet has ~20% annual returns.
Why 6340? Is that your closing target?
!long btcusd open 6467
Catching falling knifes?
I think staying out of position feels like the right move. While it fails to break up it also fails to break down every time, its not even going below 6,6k convincingly anymore. When the HeikinAshi looks as chopped as a candle-chart, be happy you are out of a position ;)
I am holding my slightly underwater short but that kind of fakeout is, I admit, bullish. Only about 300 were sold and it bounced off 6450 horizontal support
I think the "regular" div is stronger than a "hidden" div (someone correct me if I'm wrong as I'm still learning) so wouldn't we just be looking at a bear div? [https://www.tradingview.com/x/iiZVtMEI/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/iiZVtMEI/)
Can you explain hidden vs not hidden divs?
yes, a cactus triangle
It is made up - not because you are bad in geometry, but because you totally make up the lower horizontal line.

There is a sideways triangle. Apply the same rules to the lower line as to the upper. And STOP BLAMING YOU EDUCATION IN GEOMETRY.

Shorts just went down nearly 2k, there was 1900 coins of ask walls at 6580 and a short closed into it. Longs are 35k shorts are 21k now. What happens when Big Longy decides to dump it?
I'd just buy OTC at a steep discount and I would plan to buy much lower than current prices as well.

I think people expected BTC to be done going up and were taking profits, but now it seems that may have been premature.
I’m a trader and I decided BTC is worth 20k but nobody listen to me 🤷🏻‍♂️
It's not that people think bitcoin is worth that much, it's just that enough people think it'll go higher and enough people think it'll go lower. The real question is whether there's more of one or the other.
I know you’re probably joking, but its likely that it’s because we’re consolidating for a big move.

The fees are absolutely comparably. Around 2% for Credit Cards. BitPay is at 1%.
Thanks for this tremendous insight! How come no one told me this before?!

And no one will ever use the Internet, right? 

You don't know WTF you're talking about. Wrong about everything.
> The fees are still no where comparable to centralized methods.

The fees of bitcoin are higher than centralized solutions.  It costs 1% minimum to buy bitcoin and 1% to sell it.  Additionally, you lose whatever amount of the price decides to go down while you actually hold the coin.  

It's more expensive, slower, less efficient, and provides absolutely no consumer protections.

That's why we're waiting for:

Which for some reason will eventually buy bitcoin.  Probably very soon.  Like two more weeks soon.  Remember, bitcoin is not a currency anymore after the fee debacle it's a store of value.  New paradigm.  
True, but the current iteration seen on the front page is calculated using the 2017 CDPR. I was mostly drawing attention to the fact that the 2017 bull run still had all the colours of the rainbow underneath it as logical possibilities; all the way down to 5k as it stands now. 
The rainbow draws itself based on performance since 2012, which barely fluctuates. It moves between 0.29% and 0.35%  compound daily, depending on the price being at the top or the bottom of the rainbow.

I use azop's chart that excluded price data impacted by Willy bot.

It's shit res because I don't have access to the moon-math chart in decent res.

That second pink line is 4k. Essentially even if we bombed hard, that's the floor if moon-math doesn't need re-drawing.

Remember that with enough time, the dark blue channel still represents logarithmic growth.

If we hit dark blue channel and did what we did during that bear market that means we'd slowly grind up to 20k by  2019-04-11. 

The reason this seems incredibly counter-intuitive in real numbers (and visually) is the logarithmic growth pattern. Consider the real values in the 2014 bubble and what it dropped to and how much bigger a pop that seems, compared to the 20k - 5.7k drop we've had now.

Inside bar on the close.
I don't know, but I suspect that many traders don't want to state their view when there is an unclear situation like now, but prefer to say something when the picture is clearer. There were some statements about a bull flag yesterday that I'd assume someone who called a bull flag would come on the sub and update their view or explain, in light of the latest action.

I remember thinking at the time that you could on anyone day interchange the dollar price and number of comments and nearly break even :)
So you're not expecting a long squeeze then.
Good read, thank you. It’s now 81k BTC volume there, that’s $527,000,000 with no price movement. I dunno what he’s up too but that’s fishy af
I'm long for weeks now. I've been down -15&#37; and now up 12&#37;. I don't care if it goes to 4k, or lower, I'll just ride this one out. There's too much good news to ignore in the cryptosphere and they just keep piling up. 
Almost forgot. We are back fighting around the mythical 6666 level. What a beast.
I agree.
Great answer, thanks bud!
With the hack that happened on binance, apparently the hacker bought SYS at something like USD$640k, acting as buyer and seller from someone's account he hacked (as I understand it).
If that's the case, wouldn't he have had to buy up all the volume of SYS before fulfilling his orders for 640k at the top of the order book?
No such thing, we're all here to get better and share info. I hope we all get our lambos in the end, but I'll be just as happy knowing BCM is mostly in the green.
Haha... I did that a LOT last year... which is probably what's been burning me this year.

Glad I sold a bit earlier today... and bought back in after that dip.
Someone has to be buying, every block reward, though right? I mean if every 10 min, new Tesla stock was issued and the price was stagnant, that would mean someone is buying Tesla stock, no?

TIL H&S can occur on an angle.
I think if there are simply foreign currency fluctuations then bitcoin stands to gain ground, but if the stock markets tank really hard as well then people may go into panic/survival mode and any bitcoin that could be turned to US dollars would be.

I was going to say that, but better that you did.  It's an absurd statement to say you aren't going to adjust your position for a few weeks, regardless of what the market does.

People like to lie to themselves...and to us.
If anything that would be a bearish sign, lol. It's always a local low or high. Unless bitcoin suddenly dumps 20%, at which point it could be a bullish signal.

Imo it's ridiculous.
And the day after 7th 
Get out of here with this crap
Exactly. This is commonly called "going up to find sellers". The basic dynamic is that some bullish traders will be constantly averaging down and not selling so the dumps eventually stop being able to go further down in one single candle. As the price moves back up those averaging down bulls begin to take profits or to break even, while at the same time short positions get closed or margin called. This creates the breathing room to reach new lows.

The real zinger, considering that this dynamic works just the same in the opposite direction, is that a market bottom is indistinguishable from a "suckers rally". So only after observing how the bullish pullback behaves near its "top" can you begin making conclusions.

Currently I think that this rally can go up to 7100 at which point we can observe the price action to draw conclusions. Anything  lower will be very bearish and a sign of continuation of the higher timeframe down trend.
We never broke past the 21D EMA since the BGD in April
It may be worth noting that breaking of the *third* downtrend resistance line is considered more significant than the that of the first and the second one, and may be indicative of a trend reversal (the Fan Principle).
6K to 10K isn't a suckers rally is it?
Crazy to short at this price. Far better short entries in the future.
FWIW I've been short since 10K still open and have a leveraged short opened on Dec at 6735 after my Sept 1K trailing stop got hit...
I also like how people see bulish patterns before those even happen and ignore bearish patterns like downward cup and handle, descending triangle so on.
Not comparing prices, just a heads up if you see BTC price grinding up and most alts getting rekt, usually BTC follows shortly after.

I highly doubt it's as high as the halvening rate. Thats an irrelevant upper bound.
No. That is way too slow if crypto is to actually catch on, which I believe it is doing. Network effect means exponential growth. $600, $6000, $60,000, $600,000. 10x a year for two more years at least. There's a lot of money that is about to jump into the crypto space, for example if ETFs take off. 100x from here takes us to the same order of size as gold. This would also be in line with existing growth - depending on how you draw your trendline, I get $60k by July 2019 and $600k by December 2020.

Doubling once per year is too slow for the adoption of a new technology and asset class. The market will find its price much sooner I believe.

there is a 1750 BTC volume on that 1min candle so I doubt it was lifted
4hr kijun is currently at ~6280...could be a target but I guess we'll see if there is more weakness for another leg down, or if there is more upside to this current uptrend.

My current analysis is that the bottom is not in, but that doesn't mean we can't go higher first to say 7200 or 7800 etc

edit : I should add that the 4hr kijun at 7280 is also right at the downtrend line from 10K that we broke above on July 2nd...so if you are a Bull then this would just be a retest of that line before resuming the uptrend

peace

As a color blind person, I actuary find the crazy variation kind of helpful to distinguish! Even though it's a bit too crazy. I hate charts where shades of blue or subdued red/green lines all look the same.

Hidden bear, crouching bull
I'm still learning, so I might be mistaken. I'll update the post if I'm wrong 
At the same time, there's a long trade setup available as well. Currently forming a moderate sized inverse h&s pattern on the 4hr (volume profile for this pattern is valid). Breaching the neckline and surpassing the $6849.7 high on 19th June (Bitfinex) should give a long trade with a potential reward margin of approx $1000. All in all, should be an exciting day for traders. 
Thanks for your thoughts 
Hahah I definitely feel like it. I’ve honestly been trading with very small positions though since I keep trying to scale into a position, but it reverses before I have a chance to build up a sizable position. I guess I should feel lucky that I haven’t had to deal with an underwater position, but I really wish the volatility were bigger here.
*Geodude uses agree*

Morning. Yep. 6600 is support now and 6800 - 7200 a resistance. 
I think a bounce on $6300 support would still complete the formation, but yeah anything sub-$6200 would likely turn super bearish fast. Either way, I see more potential downside than upside at this point, which is why I keep testing out positions here.
>I feel if we break through the 6300 range it's gonna be goblin town again,

Yeah it's GG if we get back down there.

  
\> Only hope for up is some more sideways here and then a really strong move up breaking through 6800-7200 in one go.   


Pretty much. 
Hopefully this drops soon lol
LOLOL
Yes, it is the fear of being underwater and excitement of gains.. I sleep better when I am out of position
If you want. I just see 8.2K a heavy volume area 4.65-5K as a strong bounce area and I don't think we've been in the bear market long enough or gone low enough to justify just how insane the run actually was. I can see 1.4K but not for long but I have been saying it's possible since 20K but only time will tell I guess.
Probably. But we should be able to recognise such an occasion by different price action. This may or may not be such an indicator.
Well eventually it will be different, and I’d expect price action to appear subtly different when it does. 

If no attempted move up is different ever again, then we are going to go to zero. This could also spell an even more horrible type of different with even more pain, who knows.
Well, the 21 day got breached a few days ago didn't it? I know part of the job of this sub is to throw cold water on the moonbois, but its gotta  come from the data right? 
The majority of the US has been up for 3-4 hours, with the west coast waking up now
You know they mean from the recent bottom at 5,800, you are just being overly negative.  The blip in October 2015 didn't look like much either, but if you want to catch the bottom, blips are what you have to look for.  By the end of October the price left $300 and it never went that low again.
The weekly is a doji. A green one. Generally that's a trend reversal. Longer term EMAs are also changing direction. But as I said, I'm quite confused 
Maybe you should zoom out. I see a 150% gain in 12 months and a 15% gain in the past six days. I also see a very obvious bottom at $6K and a wonderful buying opportunity for long-term investors. I think this "bear market" was manufactured by folks who are (rightly) afraid of Bitcoin and have more money than brains. Would have been much easier for them to have gotten on board and adjusted their business model, but instead they threw away a couple billion (possibly more) attempting to defeat mathematics. They can lose more money for all I care. They don't deserve it anyway.

Yup, tanking right on up for the last two weeks.
Or some major shareholders want a better entry price or they ride a short. They have their editors push stories that it’s all over until they get their entry or short profit. Then the stories switch to “the comeback of the year” to generate fomo and long profit. News is only infotainment, not truth.

So no refutation to this guy’s thoroughly researched and devastating critique on the pitfalls of bitcoin and blockchain technology?

I mean come on, this guy has clearly spent several minutes on this article and you want to dismiss it like that?
... or a 2 week bear flag.
Nah, what theres LoTs of are people who bought in over the past 6 months, at prices they thought were “cheap”, who are now starting to rethink their investments.  One by one their hands are getting shaky, and they will fold.  Until they have all folded, we will not see the bottom.  
Genuine question: is this speculation on your part, or is there some way of quantifying / tracking this? Assuming the former, but your language is quite certain, and I know almost literally nothing. 
I generally scan through the Bitcoin markets to see which has more volume. 1st time i see this one... looks shady af.
So theres this new thing called trans-fee mining. Its about to take over the crypto markets. Look it up. Like 5 exchanges just started doing it within the last 30 days. Essentially its running a ICO for an exchange token through mining. The way it works is you pay normal mining fees in BTC. Then you get fully reimbursed for the fees in the exchanges native token (so thats F Token for the FCoin exchange, not sure about BigOne but something similar). You can then sell the token for BTC if you want or hold it. You usually get some benefit for holding it (dividends from others mining fees or something). F Token (FT) which is FCoin's native token has some crazy high market cap right now for the supply*price though its not shown on CMC. So basically yes the trades are free and the volume is likely a wash. But I would pay attention to what is going to happen here. Trans-fee mining is catching fire. Binance's CZ has come out against it.
When bulls start closing longs or open shorts it's time to go long :)
I guess you can teach an old dog new tricks lol
We're not going back to 5800, but if we do, I'll certainly go long at that point.
Depends on lending rates which are dictated through a lending market (at least on BFX i assume thats how other exchanges work). So it's all supply and demand
Xrp lending rates are close to nothing so wouldnt mind that atm
Not that I doubt you, but I'm still new to trading. Would you care to explain why you say this?
This is just FUD
Ty!
I mean if someone can trade on predictable price movements of 1-2%. 
That's a good point. 
It's a false comparison. The kind of trading I am talking about is only possible with small amounts.
I'm out of position, but if this is an attempt to close the bart which opened on July 2nd, then that's the target to show a complete close.
There's a trick to it.
I've caught a lot of falling knives this year and made some pretty decent money doing it. One of these times, I'll catch the one that doesn't stop going up.
One possible scenario is that the price is trying to stabilize but the amount of margin positions keeps triggering everyone's stop losses to one side then to the other, preventing the usual BBands/Volume squeeze consolidation.
Hidden div is a continuation signal. Regular div is a reversal.

Thanks a lot :D 
Yeah, I got it wrong it seems.
Read the rules then 
Low effort
No not at all.
No, at least when it comes to H&S 
Are any patterns on any timeframe reliable?
Yes because that's what patterns are. They are fractal and repeat on every timeframe. If you see a H&S on the 15 min timeframe you can do a short term trade. 
We'll see soon enough.
It goes down hard? (I’m new here) 
thanks for the response, I'm not sure either, except that maybe it's a link to offsite as gypsytoy is suggesting.  

edit: I just reviewed the postings I've made of it in Bitcoinmarkets daily thread since I started (about 1 week now), each day it has received a few upvotes and the range of votes has shown between 3 and 9, I'm not certain why today it's suddenly received -15.  
I haven't changed format or issuance.
I've received a few responses since I started posting of individuals enjoying the reports.  However I can understand that some people may not want to use steemit, or perhaps just link offsite.  

For times sake I will not be able to take the time to re-format the entire publication onto reddit, however I could try to help accommodate by dropping sections of the commentary here accompanied with the link to offer you a more accessible format.

Thank you again for the feedback.

RSI has higher highs but the price has lower highs.
[removed]
I'm sure many people will happily sell them to you for 20k.
Market buy that shit up dude
It’s probably more that a lot are waiting to increase their stack if it does drop to the $5.7k support. If it does, there’s high probability of bigger faster bull run to low $8k. That predicted $5.3 is being left behind now as support increases on the low side.
If only bitcoin's price was based on a fundamental use case instead of herd mentality and delusions of grandeur.
Isn't this a weird place to consolidate? Especially in a horizontal channel.
It does seem like you can scalp by selling at 6700 and buying at 6550. The question is, why?
You have to enter in URLs to visit sites. Just pray you don’t mess up. 
I can't tell if you are agreeing with OP or not. The "Which for some reason" seems like you don't think they will. But then you follow it up with "probably very soon". 
You kind of just reaffirmed everything I was saying. What happens when institutional investors never come? What's the next deus ex?
2012 CDPR on the left. 2017 on the right.
And this bbq fork thingy pointing down, it looks nice. 
I consider the sub empty when the experienced regulars aren't posting and it's mostly just emotional day traders instead (sorry if I offended anyone).

I started longing at 7600 and averaged it down to 7100. 


Is it because you are a hodler? I am currently slightly underwater long, and if we go down from here, considering just hodling for the summer, but I think there is a trade-off between hodling and trading, as you could make some money on trades in stead of just waiting. Requires skills though.
The hacker, as far as I can tell, hacked people's API keys and used their funds to buy up all of the SYS on the market, not his own, and then used the rest of their funds to buy his SYS at a ridiculous price and then withdrew. Doing this for a low-liquidity altcoin is far easier than for BTC.
If miners were selling at every block reward. There’s a lot of guesswork as to how miners choose to profit from their block rewards though.
Well yes, by "no one buying" I just mean "not enough people buying to sustain these prices"

But yea basically

Happy anniversary, BCash! You're head and shoulders above the rest!
i concur.
Not sure why I'm being downvoted or if you're being sarcastic or not but it *usually does* occur at an angle.
You are most likely correct, but we really have not had a good test of this since inception. If btc shows no correlation at all or inverse, bullish AF. But, you are probably right.

Oh, and I really hope that the stock market does not tank, just curious. 
I disagree. If people see Bitcoin holding its own or gaining a bit, they may put a little money into it. This is a global thing with easy on ramps for normal people. A mere million people putting in a mere $1000 each would be pretty significant. 
Was it because China devalued their currency, or was it because the bear market was over, and people were just looking for excuses why the price was going up? Back then, OKC and Huobi were still using volumizers. In Jan 2017 when the gov't stepped in and they stopped wash trading, the volume fell by 99%. I don't think China was ever that influential.
it's not the worst. but during the time that order was getting hit there was a much larger volume executed elsewhere at lower prices, which, if you were trading at several with a decent bot, you could have had the same volume without the premium.
How a 20% drop is bullish? lol

It’s a decentralized sub
I think we can go higher than 7100. 

The big alts haven't broke out of their multi-month downtrend yet (ETH is in a massive falling wedge) and it could really shift the sentiment if that happens.

The bottom of the symmetrical triangle is in the mid 7ks, so we have a little bit of room to get a little higher

But good post.
You're right and I agree the market seems bullish. I equate longing here similar to going long around 8.5k in april, which *was* profitable but I found to be pretty risky.
It was a big dead cat bounce and of course it was a suckers rally.  That's not to say you can't profit from a 5 or 10% or 50% move if you are on the right side of it, but a DCB is a DCB, regardless.
You are not even close.  The price is currently hanging precariously on the uptrend line from 6275.  This is a good place to short if you have a tight stop.
I talk about the daily "traders" here.... who are going In and Out 

You 10K short. Perfect. Be happy!!
i feel i have no clue what you dudes seem to be talking about :)
600k by 2020! Dude I think your a bit ambitious there. I think we have a multi year bear market wise then 2014. The whole crypto asset market is built on pure speculation with very little use case. We don't deserve half our market cap imo. 
Time preference is different from price.

If the price raises faster than your time preference you go all in sure, but what if the price is going to go down and then up? You have to question how low and how far off the real trend line is.

If so the bottom should be when an extremely conservative estimate trend is double the price a year later, or whatever time preference is in this market
ok that made as much sense as your original post.  I guess I am just not smart enough to follow along.
What website is that? I saw it being thrown around many times
Jared is waiting for the alt purge 😎
I think the next two weeks are critical.
Ah.  Anyway the important point I was making is that after it was gone and the price rose, the buy side didn't fill in.
Good luck. Don't see how anyone can not see 6K as the bottom, but good luck on this trade regardless. 
It was just a joke, nothing personal. I dont even really care, its just that it looks terrible, but since the charts arent here to look nice but to provide information, who cares? :)
No, peace is definitely a soyboy cuck. Watch him say strawman or non-sequitar every time he is losing an argument. Nerd cuck boy nothing more, there is no way he is a chad.
Thanks for sharing it either way, as it’s def worth looking at. I’m fairly rough on it myself as well, as I got corrected when I posted a similar observation a few weeks ago. Could someone else confirm/deny this div?
How important are volume profiles when looking at these various patterns?
OK. Not investment advice, though! Make your own decisions.
You want volatility? Try XMR.
Thanks! Is there a way to zoom out this order book?

https://snag.gy/zmiyek.jpg
I use cryptowatch for most of my charting, but the book viewer is terrible there.
Thanks! I'm aware of Cryptowatch but it's not possible to see 1350 sell wall at 6581.
I think we break 7800 and then a huge rug pull. (7800 could be days/weeks/months) yet once that number is reached it still makes a point on the chart for lines and I think it’s heavy “rug pull zone” 
Too early too tell imo.   Two upward barts doesn’t = reversal, just means a change in someone’s strategy or plan. 
Of course their will be moves up its just a matter of when. I just STRONGLY disagree with your assessment of how "this time it feels different" (see my comment above)
We also saw a 40-50% retrace of the second "bull flag pole" followed by a price rise on decreasing volume where it is stopping right around resistance/close to the 21 day EMA. If this doesn't seem familiar, go look back to June 3-6 and May 15-20
Can confirm, been up for 3.5 hours.
A double bottom is more than a blip, too. There are good indications that the bottom is in.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/ib76qHVS/
Pretty sure doji is a continuation pattern. Hammers/shooting stars are reversal.
Yea rules.  Like black people not being able to sit where they wanted on a bus.  I'm like basically the Rosa Parks of /r/bitcoinmarkets
Nope
No point in displaying such a big sell wall unless trying to tell something
That was not last month!!!

But ....always fun in Crypto world.
Maybe, but I tend to try to not tin-foil these stories. Some journalist has to be writing these stories and I have yet to hear any major evidence that journalists are being told from the top-down to write these stories.

Seems much more likely to me that bear markets provide them with the perfect ammunition to say *hey look you didn't miss out it was a bubble, you were absolutely right* *^(ignore the 200\% returns despite the crash shhh)*
Oh god I didn’t even notice that. I’m dumb lol
this isn't even in the top 99% of cringy lines from the NY Post.  Remember, this is the newspaper that had "KIM POSSIBLE!" as it's headline for the US/North Korea summit a few weeks ago.
Yes
What "thoroughly researched and devastating critique on the pitfalls of bitcoin and blockchain technology?"
Link say bitcoin's value is zero because it only has the value people ascribe to it. Failed logic is all I see there. Are you sure you posted the right link?
Don't forget this entire 70% drop is just a bull flag on the 1month.  It was expected and just a necessarily pullback before the inevitable new ATH, this year or next.

Bitcoin has always done this in the past, so certain to happen again, especially with the halving..100% probability, so load up on these cheap coinz that the weak hands have foolishly sold between $20K and here.
Sure. Why not both?
2 week bearflag during the past 7 days. Most definitely :P
Here is your useful lesson of the day: when somebody starts commenting using language like this in this thread, ignore what they are saying.

I would advise you to discount any of their other analysis if they start talking like this... but I'll leave that up to your judgement as you learn more.
So is it an ICO sale or is it like a mineable blockchain that you get rewarded with for securing (like bitcoin - no premine) and verifying the UTXO set? I like the decentralized exchange idea and think it's possible to run one with LN. Also didn't binance just get hacked for like the third time. Why would they think they will be able to create a decentralized exchange and are binance liable if something goes wrong.

I think exchanges are fine as they are but I think you should be able to secure your funds and have 2/3 sig where you hand over 1 key to an exchange. Using LN I would imagine it would be easy enough to route BTC through the required routes especially when your talking exchanges. I don't think the whole exchange needs to be decentralized but as long as they don't have access to your funds directly and we can achieve that in a way that you can verify it's fair I think that's about as decentralized we really need at this point. When you enter a trade you sign with the second key and your buy/sell goes through and balances could be settled in an on-going sidechain(maybe thats what their blockchain is on the ICO) until the LN channel settles on chain at which point the sidechain can start from scratch to keep the nodes verifying as little data as possible to keep it quick.
> You usually get some benefit for holding it (dividends from others mining fees or something)

sounds like a classic reverse funnel scheme, what could go wrong!
I actually think diydude is a better trader than he lets off with his comments. He's trying to catch the bottom and has managed not to take more than like 1 loss during a 40% downtrend. And I think he's longed like 7 or 8 times now since $9k

longing during a downtrend is certainly more profitable than shorting during an uptrend. Downtrends tend to retrace a *lot* (we have retraced a total of ~45%: 10%, 10%, 10%, 15%) whereas uptrends can just kinda crawl upwards forever- it seems like he knows this
try it 
Nobody can.
For now this just retraced the pump of July 4. Not much selling here but no bounce also, so i'm inclined to say this might go down some more.

Even so i opened a tiny long for a quick scalp just in case it bounces a bit. Stop loss of 0.5% and might move it to BE if it raises 0.5%.
Bitch imma "close the bart" to $5900 and see how you like that.
The secret trick is to post the trade 1-2h later when it's already in the green so people will think you sucessfully catched a falling knife.
Yes I know, but I've read that if both are present that the regular divergence takes priority as it's a stronger signal. 
Thank you. :)
Well, upbarts have been followed by downbarts pretty consistently if that counts ;)
People in this sub in particular don't want steemit links because

1. Why? Why post in steemit when you can just mark the comment down for reddit?

2. This is a Bitcoin sub and a lot of people here (myself included) think steem is scam, just like Dan Larimer's other idiotic endeavors. 

3. You're combining Bitcoin and alt analysis into one post, when really some of that link belongs in the alt thread (where you also spammed this). Because you used a single link, you've bypassed the rules of the sub.

4. People don't care to support, upvote, pay in steemshit on that stupid platform. A lot of us are a little offended and appalled by the spirit of paying for casual content on steemit. The culture of free information, without the overhead of monetized, albeit with phony scamtokens, voting system.


I bought at 6100$ and did not close.

You have some pretty serious issues man.
Do not look for divergences on 1m, FFS.

But I want to sell. I decided
If that was the case bitcoin wouldn't be worth anything. It needs both herd mentality AND fundamentals. In the case of bitcoin, one can't exist without the other.
Part of the price of any market vehicle is speculation and herd mentality.  I’ll give you an example, prior to the iPhone apple had a PE ratio of like 39 and after it was released to dropped to 9 very quickly before profits were realized.  Now it’s raising back up and is almost 18. This cycle was about the hype behind the iPhone. Apple is still incredibly profitable but the pe ration is increasing because people aren’t speculating that apple will release new products.  Eventually as the possibility of bitcoin is realized the fundamentals will catch up to price. 
YOU ARE THE DELUSIONAL PIECE OF TRASH.

GO AWAY LOSER. NO ONE CARES ABOUT YOU AND YOUR HATE
No that weird. We are locked into the low 6.5k to high 6.9k triangle until about July 9th and we either break above or drop below.
BTC by nature doesn’t do what stock market TA does... don’t expect it to do any of that. 
Some people like trading the ranges the barts bring and can make some decent money off of it.

I for one think it's super risky (easy to get caught off guard by a BXD) and tend to stick to one position till the barts are done barting and the market makes an actual move.
Http colon slash slash wtf is that nonsense. I'll stick to my library books.
Well you can just re-enter the URL. can't undo a transaction...pretty different :P
Whooooosh
The man himself!

I'm aware that you explicitly say not to trade on this idea (I don't), hopefully I'm not presenting your data/analysis in such a way as to suggest as such.

I just think it's the best representation of the bubble cycle of BTC and excellent at giving a macro sense of perspective.

Thanks for your contributions in that regard.

(Sometimes I think the use of the meme 'moon' in the name lessens its credibility, just my opinion though)
mmm bbq
Ok, sure, in the short term. But medium to long term its a necessity to sell to maintain the cost of mining, right?

But yes, it is not an obligation to sell at every block reward. More of a macro statement relating to price stagnation. 
Well I know that you are buying, biggly=) 
Exactly what I was thinking! I may have found a new alt to add to my list of alts to short :P 
I didn't downvote you...

And I actually did just learn that... as the investopedia charts show it happening on a flatline... I assumed that had to be the case.

Thanks for your insight!
https://www.sifrdata.com/cryptocurrency-correlation-matrix/

Last 90 days an inverse correlation between stock market and crypto has appeared.
A billion dollars isn't really significant in terms of market cap, and even 24h volume, that's just 20%. 
yes, but then you'd have to rely on the market to sell to you at a lower price. 

by using a hidden buy wall, the bears see it as a challenge, and dump hundreds of bitcoins at once trying to break your wall down. 

when you are a whale, you are used to slippage. And $100 at this price is just 1.5% slippage. Which is nothing when you are 70% off ATH
I was somewhat joking but the idea is that the sixth of the month can predict how the rest of the month plays out.

The sixth of January, March, May and June were local highs, all of which preceded a month long downward movement.

The sixth of February and April were local lows, which preceded a month long rally.

If a 20% drop occurs, the sixth of July is a local low, which, if the hypothesis is true, precedes a month long rally.

Depends on what you think are achievable targets. I think we can go test the 8350$ resistance in the next week which would be about 25% from the actual price.
Oxymoron. DCB is by definition not big.
Dude you are litterally shorting since below 6000$, how would you know what is a good shorting price.
Just clarifying cus people keep calling me rekt when I say I'm short until I say but from the top of the last run (on my main account - bitmex is play money until it isnt cus hat leverage man... But my gambling money went from 0.035 to 0.4 BTC with another position with about 0.1 BTC PnL so not bad in a month risky leverage(mostly10-25x but thats why it's my gambling account)
This 10K entry price doesn't mean anything as to whether he should be short here or not.  It's either smart to have a short position here or not...doesn't matter if entry was $20K or $10K or $5700.   
Did you actually downvote me for disagreeing? Lol.

If you do not see the use case for crypto, we fundamentally disagree and everything that comes after is pointless.

To put what I'm saying into another light, if I had predicted similar magnitude price increases at basically any point in the past 10 years, I would have been right.

I believe the onus is on you to describe what you think is different now.
I mean you could just google it instead of being a smartass.

From what I understand, I think I may have actually made a call for a Hidden Bearish Divergence -- so the opposite of what I wrote, with that said I'm not overly bearish, its been a long and painful year, and most people have been getting chopped by the famed barts more than anything recently.
I find volume to be an important tool when analysing classical TA patterns. Other chartists rarely use volume in their analysis (e.g. Peter Brandt). In thinly traded markets, an argument can be made for not referring to volume when analysing chart patterns, although even for Bitcoin, volume can be useful to tell a story. 

In h&s patterns (whether the normal or the inverse pattern), lower volume on the right shoulder (as compared to the left shoulder or head) generally shows fatigue on the part of buyers in the normal pattern case, and fatigue for sellers in the inverse pattern case, and therefore can bring your attention to the possible formation of these patterns, even if the neckline has not yet been breached. 
Sorry but I have no idea too :(
can you elaborate? we want to improve it. is it just the depth of the book that's available?
Would not be surprised... That needs to be another acronym attributed to this sub HRP Zone - Heavy Rug Pull Zone. I like it
I’m simply saying the price action is a little different from the barts and the days of stagnation we’ve seen recently. Just a little more volatile right now, and I’m not the only one who noticed it, as there was another post immediately before mine mentioning the odd action too.
From this chart we could speculate that the next real test will be the 7600$ level with the confluence of the mid Bband, the downward trendline and the horizontal resistance from the big red candle.

If we manage to break this resistance, we could see a retest of 10k and the weekly BBand top.

So you’ve never seen the scripted talking points exposed videos compiling tens to hundreds of newscasts all saying the same exact line? If you want an example of major news outlets manipulating and repeating the official mandated talking points see the Deadspin channel on YouTube, video title: “Sinclair’s soldiers in trumps war on media”
No tinfoil necessary. All you need to do is understand how the PR business works. Madison Ave PR firms are paid to formulate talking points and trigger words ("bag holder," "delusional" sound familiar?), even craft boilerplate articles, then feed these to media contacts and Internet trolls/influencers. That's how it works, princess. That's why you so often see the same things being said with the same words across various media. 

It's not a conspiracy, just business.

Add: these same Madison Ave firms also have advertising clients so you can see how the media might ask, "How high?" when the PR department says jump.
Read my edit, was just sarcasm, I thought it’d be obvious seeing as how utterly terrible the article was.
The one month chart I love it!  People here are trying the 1 minute charts LOL
Thanks for the advice. As a noob it's difficult to differentiate between the confident knowledgeable people and the confident idiots. Starting to get a good grasp, though. 
I agree, he also has a lot more patience than the majority of people in this sub which isn't always a good thing, but it certainly isn't  a bad quality to have as a trader either
I’ve actually been trying this exact thing. I’ve hit 51 consecutive 1% shorts since May 7th. It took me three months to figure out the right basket of indicators, but I think I found it. 
Many people trade 1% moves as scalps. I know some scalpers that go for less than that too.
I've hit a lot of 1-5% gains on alts in the past weeks even though they were mostly dropping on the daily. Just gotta figure out what works and set good stop-loss so even like 3 bad trades don't matter anymore after 1 good
Then how do scalpers work?
The fact that these posts are starting again makes me think the public is regaining interest and we could see a reversal starting in the coming months due to fresh money(and tears).
Reading the word catched made me want to stab myself in the eyes with a falling knife.
It could be argued the regular div already played out with the breakdown but failed to move the chart past the RSI low, which also coincides with our last support zone from the first rejection from ~$6,700. Hence the newly formed hidden bull divergence.

You know what, a lot of people in here do not agree with your Bitcoin Maximalism. (And to call Steem a scam is beyond belief as it has consistently more real use than Bitcoin and most other coins).

Edit: I don't own any Steem.
Lol these sort of people are sad and lonely. Ignore em bro

It seems to me that these triangles are constantly being redrawn.

We've broken out of the bottom of the triangle that I've been watching.

? His post was so nuanced I couldn't tell if he was being sarcastic or sincere. But seeing as how all the butthurt people downvoted me but upvoted him, they obviously werent sure either.
This. A major objective is to illustrate the mountains and valleys of the bubble cycle.
Also, credibility isn't the objective for the chart. The analysis lacks substance. It's not far off from a horoscope or numerology. It's observation, not causation.
Sure, but that could be part of the downward pressure we’ve experienced from ATH. considering new players aren’t entering the market fast enough to keep up with selling. I’m sure it will balance out eventually, but I just figured I’d share an alternative perspective.
Hahahaha
I think flat lines are more-often going to parts of ascending/descending triangles, double bottoms/tops or something else. H&S typically form diagonally, from what I've seen, at least in crypto.

The BCash example is pretty textbook in my eyes and occurs over a 12 month time frame. Although the target would be -$3000 in this case. But the lowest I could see this shitcoin going is -$2000. 
Don't disagree, but it needs a full blown stress test to confirm anything. 
how is 20% not significant? 
a billion dollars flowing into bitcoin would be significant, at least short term. 
take the same general approach (resting buy order at a better than "normal" price), now do it at five (or more) exchanges simultaneously and adjust the order as the price moves up and down. average trade price is going to be quite a bit lower, no?

edit: fixed buy/sell mixup
Didn’t last month it didn’t played out eventually? I’m not completely in the loop because i think it’s a myth 
[Something like this is the most plausible scenario](https://prnt.sc/k2ttid) if we're going for a bearish continuation setup.

Wherever the top is, the market seems to like double bottoms/tops lately. If the trend is now bull, I'd look for a bearish 1D candle and try to short a double top. I got downvoted back in April for warning that our 9.7k run had a high volume bearish engulfing 1D candle.
You are right ... King
DCBs are usually small, but can be big..by definition.
What a retarded ad hominem. I've also been shorting since $20K and my largest short ever was right below $10K....not that it matters though, except in your muddled, little mind that says it's "crazy" to short right now.

No i didn't downvote, Internet points mean nothing to me, but arent you supposed to downvote if you disagree? 

I see a use case for crypto but can't imagine a government adopting it as a currency and losing control over the money. 

Before eos even had a mainnet it was worth more than spacex, a company that sends rockets to space! The crypto market is so overvalued considering its use case, which is very little. 

Just becuse btc has had huge price hikes over the last 10 years does not mean it will keep on going up, thats very silly logic.  Have you ever seen a gold chart?


His question still doesn't make sense, but as I said, I am probably not smart and/or knowledgeable enough to follow along with this one.
Many thanks!

I guess we gotta use that order book depth chart :(

Thanks bud
Oh thanks for asking.

• I can only see 13 lines max in the order book on my display.
So if I do no grouping, I only see a few dollars of action.
Then the next iteration up of grouping is $10, so then it is too zoomed out.  With $50 grouping, the next iteration, there is only enough data for 9 lines. There should be more options for increments.

• I should be able to scroll the orderbook, and it should have a greater range of data

• Also, the depth chart is glitchy, after being open a while, the buy and sell sides aren't split 50/50, and they overlap.  (actually I think it's been a few weeks since I saw this bug)

• The order log also doesn't keep enough history.

• And I would like to be able to put filters on the order log to only show orders above X size

• I would like a horizontal bar graph for each line in the orderbook and order log, to visualize the relative size of the orders, without needing to look at the order size.

Positive:

• I love the mouse over on the orderbook, and the depth chart, which also shows corresponding lines on the candle chart, and there is the text on the candle chart that explains the summary of that data.
That or “hell candle” 😱
How is it different specifically ? Look back to may 15 - 20 and June 3 -6, how is the current price action different from then?

Edit: *clicks downvote*

 hmm yes I see a very compelling argument to my questions 
Are you missing the falling wedge?
Less dead than you will be once you're no longer alive though, I'd wager. Don't worry I still love you.
No, I have, I just don't think BTC (and crypto in general) is making a big enough splash for that sort of mandated order.

Plus there are loads of examples of journalists coming out and saying "Yeah we were told to push x or y story over the truth" but I have yet to hear of a single journalist coming out and saying "We had a mandate to push stories surrounding Bitcoin going to 0/100/1k/4k" etc.

To me, at least, Occam's Razor: short-sighted human nature (how many people do you think know or understand what a log chart even is) and TV stations appealing to what they know their readers want is much more likely than a top-down conspiracy in a still (relatively) small economic space.
I understood and appreciated your dry humor. Really shows you the intelligence level of a lot of people on reddit that so many couldn’t see your post for what it is: good satire. 
Thanks. Yes, I have found that patience pays on the long side, both in waiting for a good entry point and in not closing at a loss or with too little profit. I may regret closing this one because I still see a reversal in progress, despite this latest little dump, but that's what the hodl stack is for.
Patience is everything!
I'm sure you have a system for roulette, as well?
I believe you, but to the experts here you don't exist, it seems.. 
most scalpers get rekt and quit trading. Most of the scalpers I watch here disappear after a strong move moves against their little scalp. 

"Picking up pennies in front of a steam roller" is the quote 

Sometimes it  takes months for it to happen- but it almost always does unless they have extraordinary risk management, which most scalpers don't. and you have to watch charts very carefully 
'These posts"..?
Not a native speaker, tired, happens.. :-D. 
True, which I think would also invalidate the hidden bull div. But another one (hidden bull div) might be in the making depending on where our next swing low ends up.
I don't claim to speak for everyone, but in this case I think the vote counts are pretty obvious. Most people around here hate steem and don't want to click on links to steemit. 
> You know what, a lot of people in here do not agree with your Bitcoin Maximalism. (And to call Steem a scam is beyond belief as it has consistently more real use than Bitcoin and most other coins).

Lol, that's absurd. Steem has zero use. It's just a gimmick token and a poorly designed one at that.

Bitcoin on the other hand has a plausible use case as sound digital money. That's a *far greater* value prop than Steem could have even under best case conditions. 

Don't fool yourself. Bitcoin maximialism = shitcoin skepticism. It almost never makes sense to use a blockchain for the 1100+ shitcoins in existence. But that doesn't stop people like yourself from shilling all sorts of shit under the guise of "hurr durr blockchain v3.0".

Those of us who understand the technology and economics of the game realize how silly and destructive it is to spin up a token for every novel use case, without any thought put towards first principles. Others, like you, think that every new project has world-disrupting potential.

Which one of us is deluded?

Hmmm...
We were also sitting right below resistance around $6.8k. Typically it will wind up and consolidate before pushing through resistance or take a step back before pushing through, or else reverse at key resistance levels. In this case, my guess is the latter.
Yes sir, fair enough 
So, what, about a $200 spike? $500? How big of a green candle do you think a billion dollars could generate?
not quite a bit, maybe 50 bucks if you are lucky and whales aren't omniscient, who knows if the price will get that low or if it'll bounce

as a whale, you can't just wait for a bottom and buy. the liquidity just isn't there. So you have to accumulate using either hidden buy walls or buy slowly growing your stack a few BTC at a time. 
Not to be argumentative, but the phrase arose to describe how the market bounces 'like a dead cat' -- i.e. hardly at all.
A big bounce as you are describing is just a bounce.

My understanding of Reddiquette (do people still use that term and/or practice? Haven't used Reddit much in like 7 years) is that downvotes should only be used when a post is unhelpful / unproductive. Disagreement should be voiced in the comments, downvotes should only express a low quality / level of discourse. If course it's all subjective and whatever. 
The market cap of a crypto currency is not equal to what’s its “worth” as a whole (I.e. the actual value if you tried to sell every EOS coin is way, way, way less than its market cap). This is a common misconception.

It’s also very different from the valuation of a private company such as spaceX.

A better comparison would be the inflow into a crypto currency vs the value of a private company, and there’s no way EOS has an inflow of $21b (the value of spaceX) and it’s value is considerably less.
That's a huge formation, and they need to drop another 75% or so. Could take some time.
very useful feedback, thanks.
I’m not an experienced trader, so I can’t give you what you’re asking. You may well be right that everything is exactly the same, I can’t prove otherwise.

I just perceived a change as a regular chart watcher, and thought it worth mentioning in case it did turn out to be significant.
Could it not also be seen as a descending triangle, where the bottom has been confirmed as resistance? https://i.imgur.com/zxPtUCL.png

I'm not sure I understand this question....

The downward trendline is the falling wedge resistance. 

Breaking this resistance, this would give us a target of about 15k based on the falling wedge formation. But there are a few resistances in between.
Poe's law.
Whenever I play roulette I just put it on black until I lose. I’ve only played it a few times.  It does nothing for me.

I mean, I’m not trying to say I have some amazing solution that’s going to make millions of dollars. I just had an idea, I’m testing it, and I’ll examine the results when the schedule is finished. So far, I’m surprised with the results. 51 consecutive feels statistically significant, but I’m not ready to make a massive shift with my portfolio. 

There are a few things that please me so far. All but one of the trades closed within 24 hours. Also, in terms of Bitcoin, this trading scheme has outperformed the market, or at least really closely matched it. 

Who knows if it’s going to work long term, I’m going to keep trying it.  
Funnily enough that actually exists.
It's technically possible, but the low liquidity makes it extra hard. Lower time-frames are generally considered more difficult to trade than large so I'd claim you'd need an exceptional amount of skill to do 1-2% consistently. Trading fees can also be high. If someone was that good I'd imagine you'd rather sit back and collect on the higher time-frames. (or switch markets)
What do you mean ”you people”?
In the past few days I've seen multiple people bringing up the age-old "if I can just make 1% a day" idea. We all start that way, figuring we can turn the idea of compounding interest into something that benefits us.

It's not that it can't be done, it's just mentally taxing and can get you into a really bad work/life/trading habit. I turned a great profit doing it last year, but I barely slept or went out.
Yeah exactly. Not saying which way we're headed quite yet, just a couple signals to look out for depending on the price action. 
I have edited my last reply to reflect a more appropriate response as to not assert you were making a claim to speak for 'everyone'. 

I have been averaging a positive vote count for the past week on my initial posts here, as well I've noticed that today I not only have a negative vote count, but also a peculiarly and suddenly high volume/interest of votes on both my initial posts and on some replies in the thread. 

I will take both analytics into account moving forward.  
I believe that the accommodation I presented will provide the opportunity to both allow me to contribute and provide for you to not have to click a steemit link. 

Also I have no desire to talk about steem or steemit, especially here. 
Thank you. 


Hahah sorry to be contrarian. I’ve just seen so many “bitcoin is officially agreed upon to be 9k/8k/7.5k/6.5k posts. Consolidation and retests happen (especially so at $8k). It doesn’t necessarily mean we’ll be stuck at the same price forever, it just means the market is undecided at the moment.

We’re at the 50 yd line right now, which makes it hard for anyone to confidently take a position.
go to an order book aggregator and you can see yourself exactly how high it'd go 

actually $1b would be massive lol 
https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/books/USD


shows 34.8k to $7100. Assuming they're all $7100 asks (which they're not) we get $247mm, so a quarter of a million.

So just a quarter of that $1b would move the price to $7100. I imagine an actual billion would move it somewhere around $8-9k
what's the scenario that you're accumulating a serious amount of coin and you need to do it RIGHT NOW? if your horizon is something like a week there is plenty of time to buy it passively. if your horizon is like five minutes, I guess this is a good approach. 
Ok yes that is a good point and a huge bounce is not a DCB.
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz....

"Crazy to short at this price."
Intresting thank you
That's just not true, eos has a market cap of 8billion as of speaking. If you sold all the eos tokens it would come to 8billion total, i think the comparison is very fair, eos has no real use case at the momemt where as space x goes to the moon.

How dare you to be bullish inside our bear hug box. Shame on thee.
The double bottom on the 12h indicates no.
We don't have to ascend out of the wedge before 7,6. We can do it much later and it's still a valid example of a falling wedge.

Example: https://www.tradingview.com/x/wxpq8ewu/
Clear. I'd also take into account how different people's trading styles are, and all the funny things going with some of the alt coins. I am willing to believe that there are niches in alt trading for consistent 1-5% trades. Can't see the big controversy in asking a question about this anyway.
Alright, I see what you mean. Maybe this is obvious to the oldtimers here, but I haven't seen this "1% idea" discussed in the sub before. 
All good man, same thing for me. I am very undecided about this market, so I am merely challenging the same things that I am working out in my head.

On one hand, I could clearly picture a slow bleed for months, still. But I could also picture something very different the other way, with horns. 
Far higher. When they first start buying and we shoot up, asks would be pulled, others would market buy alongside the whale, shorts would get liquidated. 1 billion would easily take us to new ATHs
because the price is still very close to the bottom and the sell volume is still pretty miserable. if we really had a double bottom at $5,800...a whale looking to acquire 10,000 BTC can't just spend a couple of weeks trying to acquire passively.
Hahaha you deleted your comment. And I find it funny that you now use the ad hominem rhetoric because I remember using it on you about a week ago.


\>  If you sold all the eos tokens it would come to 8billion total

There aren't enough buyers to sell all the EOS tokens at the current price. Every token you sell would have market effect in reducing the price further and it wouldn't take long until they are selling for a few cents.

It's becoming a really common misconception (especially with YouTubers incidentally) that market cap is the value of the project. It 100&#37; isn't (this isn't me saying it, its just a fact -- Market Cap is an indicator of current price \* total supply, period. it means nothing else).

I usually ignore the 100's of times people get this wrong, but as your comment was written coherently I thought I'd chime in :)

EOS true value is probably less than $1b which seems about right (or arguably still too high, but less extreme than 8b).
A good example: I make a coin with a supply of 10 million tokens and sell one to a friend for $100.

The market cap is now $1b yet clearly the project isn't valued at that.

The inflow is $100 which is a more realistic valuation (I have seen calculations taking the inflow multiplied by 5 to 7 times to give a valuation, which is similar to company valuation calculations using profit).

How to value a crypto is an interesting point though (and yeah EOS should be less than spaceX) not sure if there's anything officially determined as yet.
He's bullish because "he feels like things are different" I'm asking him specifically why past his "gut feeling" 
I was assuming $1b as an injection total, but if you assume it's just 1 buyer then yes that would be ridiculous
It either is ad hominem or it's not.  Others can read your post and decide whether it is or not.

They can also decide whether it's crazy to short here or not.
 Not just a gut feeling, a perception based on watching the charts. Not quite the same thing imo. Gut feeling is just a feeling, but I’ve noticed what I’ve perceived to be less stagnation in short term prices. My perception is not backed up by data so of course take it with a pinch of salt, I don’t know how to prove it true or false.

I’m optimistic because the same is obviously bad, and I believe this to be subtly different, which at least has the chance of improved outcome.
He's not wrong. Regardless of what happens next, this bounce has already played considerably differently than the others we've had since May's top.

I don't get why you made such a big deal out of his observation, why deny the differences? It could go down anyway.
Nothing against you in that comment, I was simply replying because he was implying that I was giving you a hard time for being "bullish" rather than me just trying to understand your non quantitative reasoning behind what you said
I'm asking why, idc about if your bullish or bearish, I just want reasoning behind something more than "this is what I'm observing/feeling" and nothing else 
No problem, thanks for clarifying 
But there's nothing to explain, just looking at the chart it's fairly clear this bounce retraced way more of the preceding dump compared to the other bounces. RSI confirms it if not seeing it.
Lol I mean there is totally stuff to explain, would you consider a "bull flag" retracing 40-50% of its flag pole as still being valid? Or that the price rise on decreasing volume after the retrace is considered bullish? Do you think being at a price point for 1 day is enough to break a 6 month trend? Give me something else besides "it bounced a little higher this time"

We can go back and forth but honestly you guys do your thing.

Number 1 rule: listen to yourself before others, so if you feel confident in this, more power to you dude 






This discussion began because he said the market felt different and that made him optimistic. You said nothing changed, but some things did change, you can see with the RSI on the 4H and 1D charts that price hasn't bounced as much from a dump since the bounce in April. Whether or not that warrants taking new longs now is another question, the time to long was last week. But I wouldn't be shorting yet.

Rule number 1 is don't get rekt.
The OP and I settled this a while ago. He said it felt one way, I said it felt another way and gave my reasoning, I asked for his reasoning and he did. Nothing much else too it really.

As much as I'd love to go back in forth with you about if he provided enough of an explanation for me, I feel like I'd just be talking in circles at this point.
