/u/DamonAndTheSea asked for one of my scripts, and I decided to publish it on tradingview. Feel free to grab that up and come to your own conclusions on longs vs shorts and their stability as measured by their rate of change.

We've just doubled our search volume worldwide in the ~~past week~~ two days.

There is no such thing as bad publicity and all that jazz...

Thoughts?
Anyone else in favor of throwing anyone turning this sub into a cesspool of he said/she said personal vendetta nonsense into the sin bin? 

Literally no one else cares. We're here to discuss trading bitcoin. 
So just the day before, basically all american medias are writing about the tether fud. Then the day after SEC announces this. To think that people in Washington and NY don't have insider connections to both sides would be quite foolish, so I am not surprised... but still.


Someone made a lot of money both ways, that is for sure
One of the very few times I’ve ever seen positive news impact the price of BTC/ETH in a positive way. 

Usually, good news is just bypassed while FUD tanks the price like a plague 
I'm out of all positions currently (which is still 1x long) while I see what the market is going to do. Had a lot of paper profits vanish, but I'm walking away with a 12% total BTC stack increase since Sunday, so I can't complain too much.

I don't believe this relief/news rally will have the steam to get us over 6800, let alone back into the daily pennant over 7K. 

/u/v4mpyre called me out for closing my Sept long from 6238 after the 6600 rejection--turns out he was right :P

I need some time off for a breather from the markets. We'll see what it looks like over the weekend.

Good luck everyone
Gonna give this a bit of faith and regret tomorrow. Tiny position, not much to lose.

!long XBTU18 6610 1x 20%

Edit: it's a bottom of a bull flag. If this has legs then it's no point in waiting for better entry. No stops for now. It's not like it's gonna liquidate me.
SEC says BTC and ETH aren't securities. Other ICOs are. https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/14/bitcoin-and-ethereum-are-not-securities-but-some-cryptocurrencies-may-be-sec-official-says.html
Crypto has made me too cynical to believe this news mean anything medium term. decent sized shorts on btc and eth here, will close and reopen as we break and hit resistances..
Point and Figure https://i.imgur.com/w3yX9wH.png  We have broken down from our range.  A pullback to $4,499 would complete unresolved long pole dating back over 8 months ago and is our next likely long-term target.  Short term, we have a recent unresolved long pole of 16 O's from 6/10, a move above 7,040 would resolve 50% of the pole. We have a new unresolved long pole of 12 O's from 6/12, a move above 6,373 would resolve 50% of the pole.

New, relevant trendlines: https://www.tradingview.com/x/ASrHJpfM/

6 hour bull div on RSI  https://www.tradingview.com/x/giGTSZrc/  This is going to confirm at end of this 6 hour candle and could provide us with the upward momentum to touch down on our previous large wedge.  Retesting the break down area could be an opportunity for shorts to open.  Target is between where wedge broke down (7100) and daily volume profile (7670). 
Ugh not fomoing in yet. Looking for a better entry. Still bearish imo. 
that dude's bot from a couple weeks ago is broken again on gdax, wasting money on fees lmao
Finally some explicit regulatory clarity direct from the top of the SEC, and a bunch of folks here are entering/adding to their shorts @ the historical mid-term support/buy-zone ($6.4-6.6k) after several days in oversold technical territory?

Scooping up pennies in front of a Mack truck IMHO. You guys are fucking insane. Good luck!!
I've only noticed it this morning but Binance has an option to view their charts in Normal or Tradingview, as in tradingview actual. As well as a new night mode.
If it wasn't for bitmex's shitty engine I would have fomo\-closed my long at the bottom of that wick. Thank\-you shitmex.

Edit: rip, closed it there anyway
Quick check in!  Been super busy atm.

So my [final bullish chart turned bearish](https://www.tradingview.com/x/IrSpe1Wf/) this week.

- We dropped below the 200 week LSMA, which in simplest terms means we have bucked the 4 year trend.

- The RSI has dipped into bearish territory (below 50) for the first time since the previous bear market.

-  I'm keeping an eye on what happens to price as we approach the median line (blue centre line on chart). 

- For a quick recovery I see it as imperative that we do not enter the underside of the pitch fork.

-  If we do, then I'm looking to the 100 week MA and 200 week MA for support.

My [12 Hour Chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/YIluUNjI/) offers slightly more insight into the finer details of support levels.

-  I believe we could be in for a 50% drop from the 50 week MA (17% into that as of now).  [See this post for reasoning](https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8pgw6v/daily_discussion_friday_june_08_2018/e0bttpp/?st=jier5m3z&sh=1bf63c67)

- Currently we are slumped over June Monthly Support 1 although I expect Support 2 to be tested in the nearish future.

- I believe we are searching for point "C" in our current 6 month correction wave.  I am looking to start my DCA buy back once price enters the "Target Zone".

Not much more to add here.  I reckon playing the longer time frame charts is the name of the game; it's the most effective way of not getting chopped up (for me anyway).

Hope this helps someone and good luck with your trades people.
Random thought: A good news that have an effect is not very bear marketish
Last post for me today about weird ol' VolumeRSI.

[https://imgur.com/a/wz1EIPS](https://imgur.com/a/wz1EIPS)

That last dip put our weekly down to 38.5, into oversold. Over the course of the last day the buying has been outpacing the selling significantly enough to pull the VRSI back to just above 40.

No longer oversold, but as mentioned before, still [very very low](https://imgur.com/a/I1D0l0i). Steepness of the decline has now basically flat lined. I meme'd about [maximum goblin town exploration](https://www.reddit.com/user/DaddyLittlePrincess8/comments/) the other day, but maybe this was a VRSI indicator of a reversal?

I've still got my plate armor, long sword and bucket helmet for goblin town though.
Spotted! Nessie's back! https://www.tradingview.com/x/xqMqa9A4/

Damn, 1.5k btc buy wall at 6.5 and 1k btc market buy.

Someone is pushing this...
It seems I am being too greedy. I intended to sell the other half of my stack at break even just above 6900 but my limit orders never executed. I also set some small buys just below 6100, but they didn't execute either ... interesting. I think the better traders have my psychology well figured out.  :)
First target for scaling into my short hit. Hoping this has legs up to 6800 before coming down again.

!short xbtusd 6615 10X 25%
EUR/USD had worst day in 2 years:

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=FX:EURUSD

FYI: "if" you think this will bounce (good support at 1.15), and you want to short, short BTC/EUR (for additional bonus profit), if you want to long, long BTC/USD (longing BTC/EUR might put you at a loss when EUR/USD rebounds, and e.g. BTC/USD only goes up 1% tomorrow)
1000 btc long just opened.. 
Any idea what's going on with [ETHBTC on finex](https://www.bfxdata.com/orderbooks/ethbtc)? That's some intense (bot?) trading. Candles haven't been painted like this in months.
Volume Relative Strength Index (VRSI) previous comment: [https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8qphc3/daily\_discussion\_wednesday\_june\_13\_2018/e0ldqgs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8qphc3/daily_discussion_wednesday_june_13_2018/e0ldqgs/)

Not a huge amount to say. Still think we're mucking around at the entrance to goblin town. I wouldn't want to call a short\-term movement. Reminder that I'm looking at [VRSI as an experimental indicator](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8oxl82/daily_discussion_wednesday_june_06_2018/e07cjbi/), that I'm an amateur, that I do look at other indicators but that VRSI is the one I'm writing about.

A few quick observations:

* Still not sure VRSI works on timescales lower than 3d\-1w. I think I need to do more retrospective TA to find where it has a decent chance of modelling movement, but as I noted when I started, there's a LOT of noise in VRSI and it can be difficult to differentiate between a high VRSI buying a dip, and a low VRSI selling a top and their obvious counterparts.
* [Weekly VRSI is still insanely low ](https://imgur.com/a/hXtZ3gP)but has actually increased from yesterday's value. Monthly VRSI is the lowest it has ever been.
* Conventional RSI has been lower on the weekly/monthly in 2014/2015, but the VRSI was not as low. 
* They are intrinsically linked, VRSI is an indicator of the volume ratio & strength between sells/buys.

What do I think this could suggest? If the weekly/monthly RSI tanked any further, VRSI would be laughably into oversold territory in an entirely historically unprecedented way. These are large time\-frames though, so a  sharp drop and accompanying sharp bounce into and out of goblin town (4k/5k etc) wouldn't register in the long term, and could signal a reversal for the VRSI.

Great comment by u/kanzen22 yesterday in the [daily discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8qphc3/daily_discussion_wednesday_june_13_2018/e0lyg2p). My previous comment where I looked at the declining steepness of VRSI dropping, plus the weekly VRSI increasing (if slightly) for the first time has me wondering if the equilibrium is nearly here. I'm not about to call a reversal (sentiment has me thinking we have to go down again before we go up) but in the medium\-long\-term VRSI seems to indicate there isn't *much* more room to go down.
In 2013 there were about 30 days of price discovery in the $152.40-$396 range.  In 2017 ~160 days were spent between the $2550 and $6700.  These ranges are between -66% and -87% from ath in their respective bull runs.  I picked -87% because that was the low respective to the 2014 ath, and -66% is our current price compared to the 2017 ath. What does this mean for the price of bitcoin? You tell me, because I am not sure if it is relevant information.  I assume it means we are less likely to see -87% than in 2014, but correct me if I am wrong.
New poll: What will we see first 6k or 7k? [https://www.strawpoll.me/15898439](https://www.strawpoll.me/15898439)
Almost broke out of the downtrend channel but it was just a shake out wick. We could see 7k before going down again.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/l2FzvY4G/
I hate to say it, but it appears ETH is leading the way again on our way up. I can't find any clear pattern on bitcoin right now, but it appears ETH is forming a nice ascending channel.

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/jY8PvB6Z/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/jY8PvB6Z/)
Just noise and chopping... Take extra care trading this shit.

Canceled all my sell orders, this is back to being weird. And weird usually takes money from me.
Anyone else having problems with bitmex on mobile? I cannot see (and change or delete) my active orders anymore. Pretty annoying, since i cant use the bitmex website at work...
I closed my short for a tiny profit. I think I can get a better entry, either way.

Edit: I think the better R/R is higher up, this might have another leg down and climb back to 6.8K, but I'm not comfortable holding a short from 6.6 with stops around 7K where I think the strongest resistance is. It's primed to stay in this channel https://www.tradingview.com/x/ACpMjDx7/ for a bit.
looks to me like bears successfully defending the daily resistance level in spite of bullish news. If 6500 falls, look to 6300 for support: https://imgur.com/xjJ9bjK

If this is a local bottom I kind of suspect it may grind out for a while like the april bottom did.
Took a hit on my short from yesterday afternoon. After we retested 6250 a couple times, I decided to hold it. I did move stops a bit closer, but took some slippage on the stop overnight. Note this was a stop, not me manually closing here.

!short XBTUSD close 6480

I did put in some hedging limit buys on september that have offset some of the damage. The rejection from 6600 was pretty swift, and I think we may have seen the top of our relief rally for now. The double bottom hopium is strong, though, and I'm not counting out an additional push up to 6800. I'm in wait and see mode.

Ascending wedge threatening to break down as I type this. We'll see if buyers jump in the way. There are a number of ways to interpret our current market movement, and the high volatility has led to some crazy wicks that vary across the exchanges that make for some difficult charting. I think it's an ascending wedge, but we'll have a clearer picture soon.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/UjN9MifT/

I'm still short on Jun from 7505 and long on Sept from 6238, although the short is roughly twice the size of the long. Pretty much net 1x short. I'm holding both for the moment, only because if we do move up, my September entry will be phenomenal. I wouldn't mind a bit of ranging in here, as the past 5 days of volatility have been pretty wild to trade, and it feels like everyone could use a breather.  

Good luck all.

edit: just closed my long at 6430 on sept. Looks like a breakdown.
I don't believe in this market recovering anytime soon (next few months), but I'm long for now, because a technical bounce was overdue and the good news today is still being disseminated and could provide a little more fuel to bounce higher.  

I will reshort at some point, but not yet.
[removed]
I'm certainly bearish overall, but did I make a mistake not going long this morning or yesterday with tight stops? There was no way I could have predicted this news and sudden bounce. 

The bounce from 6200 to 6400 felt like big enough to me considering all we had lately was very minor bounces. Then to 6500 and I was sure it'd definitely dip from that point. Other people here were reporting bullish divergences though, I wish I paid more attention to those indicators! I'm trying to learn from my mistakes here.

Anyway 100% long @ 6600, with stops to protect my profits. I hate to FOMO but I don't see any better options.
So this was my first time using u/position_bot, and I didn't want to spam the daily discussion while I tried to figure out the commands. I'm not sure I could ever post updates as quickly as chewy. However, since this trade seems to be working out so far, I wanted to share my progress on the trade so far. Please let me know if this is too much information, and I'll make sure to cut it back in the future.

Past: I opened a 5x long on the Sept futures $6458 for 60&#37; of my wallet since we just had a major dump follow shortly by a mini-dump that was bear-flagging pretty sharply upwards. I figured I would save a little margin to add if it dropped further, but I doubted it would drop straight past $6k without consolidating a bit first. I added 10&#37; to my margin at $6138 for an average of $6427, though if I'm honest, I was getting a bit nervous there.

Future (the part you may actually care about): I initially planned this as a scalp similar to the chop from $7k to $7.8k, and I'm trying to stick to that. I'm slowly scaling out in increasing amounts at resistance using TensorCharts as a reference. I sold 10&#37; at $6615, and I plan to sell another 10&#37; around $6.8k, 20&#37; around $7k, and 30&#37; around $7.3k, with stops placed as this continues to go up. I may rethink this strategy as things start to look more bullish/bearish. However, I only see this reaching as high as \~$7.8k, which is a historical resistance level, and which the log resistance trendline from ATH is rapidly approaching to complete the descending triangle formation on the weekly chart.

Any thoughts on this approach/what are your plans if you're longing this?
So is this a common strategy for whales? Say you want to sell off a large amount, but don't want the price to shift too much, so you put a big wall up on the buy side to make it look like support, hope reinforcements arrive, then sell to them and pull your wall when it gets close?

Probably wouldn't work in high volume, but seems like I've been seeing something similar happen.

Also is stop loss hunting a thing? Bears may know people are uneasy with the increase and are setting tighter stop losses, so one large bear sells a portion of his stack in hopes of crashing it further to buy in lower. Risky, but probably pays off in this market.

**Edit: fixed per** u/daquity36
**Break out the crystal ball** — I’m seeing a lot of $4K price targets for “the bottom.”

What are people’s targets and why? Please post charts / data / rationale behind your guesses. 

I’ll go first: I have no idea. 
Bought back in. FOMO to the fullest

Am I the only one who missed this tweet from John Bollinger yesterday?

https://twitter.com/bbands/status/1007005864740282369
Nothing has changed for me since I first bought in 2014. The risk of missing out is brutally bigger than the risk of losing some Fiat. 
My noob questions were met with positive response yesterday (thanks, btw), so here's some more:


How do you decide what coins to trade on? There's so many, where do you even start? I'm not asking WHAT coins to trade on, I want to be able to make my own, informed decisions. But I don't even know where to start.


Off that same vein, when you trade BTC for a new coin, when do you sell it back? Do you immediately turn it around and try to sell for a higher price, thus profit? What if you trade for a coin at x price, it blows up, increasing your margin, but when you trade back to BTC, BTC has also risen in price? I guess I'm a little confused on the mechanics of trading at the moment. 


A few questions on trading lingo:


* what is a bart? Been seeing that posted here a bit. 

* what is a bear/bull flag? All the youtube vidoes, forum posts, etc have referred to it, but no one has actually explained it.
 
* clarification:  a stop is a point you set where the trading platform cancels your trade so you "stop" your loss, yes?


What charts do you use? I just made an account with Bitcoin Wisdom, but I can't find how to make it a candle chart. 


Based on responses from yesterday, I'm gonna make an account with gdax to start (easy transfer from coinbase), and move onto something else one I get more practice. Been seeing a lot about coinigy; what are your thoughts on that?


Thanks for all your help, guys. I was worried about getting my anus destroyed posting noob questions here, but y'all have been really helpful. I'm a just a simple brewer with no experience in finance, stocks, trading, etc, so all of this can be really overwhelming.

*edit- formatting
Last week holding above 7.2 was bullish , today holding above 6.2 is bullish , next week holding above 4.2 will be bullish AF
It's funny how our perspective change 
Just a heads up I always lose money and bought back in at 6580 so might wanna short this.
Guys, can this be a bear div I'm seeing on the 4h?

TA noob question

Apparently somebody made a clone of bitcoinwisdom.com

The new link is: bitcoinwisdom.io

It contains more markets and altcoins (binance, eth/usd, gdax/eur). It should also more accurately display volume (like on bitfinex). It does not contain bitstamp/usd and kraken/eur yet, though.

Difference with old version is that you need to click on the square box of the market not the name itself (which redirects you to homepage exchange).
if this is indeed the bottom so many ppl are going to be pissed off cause they don't think its the bottom and they will miss it.  Kind of reminds me of last summer when there was a dip and it sat in the low 2,000 range and everybody was calling for 1200 and then boom you miss it
!short xbtusd 6420 1x 100&#37;

Didn't manage to position myself for a hedge once the big triangle broke down. Life happened in between :) But I've been successfully scalping a few small trades since...

Now it looks like 6425 (April's higher low) has turned from weak support to resistance. And the bounce at 6.1k wasn't convincing enough for me. This feels like a decent place to hedge despite potential bull divs on some timeframes. I'm happy to take a loss on this hedge if we can close above 6.9k.

Edit: Chart that show potential (short term) resistance [https://www.tradingview.com/x/PrUY2dTj/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/PrUY2dTj/)
Closed both shorts, small profit. Not gonna stand in a way of this gets fuel.
Just come home, so glad I went back in. What is everybody talking about, which news came out, read through all the last comments, no links found. 
Are all the bears doing ok in here? The sentiment sure did switch in an instant. Was that news really the spark that we’re going to say started the reversal when we look back or is this a short term pitstop  before we get to Goblintown? This move did actually had some volume behind it..
I'm calling Chop City again. This 6200 - 7000 range should be filled with barts and reverse barts...

Trade safely and don't be too greedy. Take profits as soon as the move strugles.

Bears are confident, bulls are also becoming confident with the "strong" bounce.

6600 should line up with eth's and ltc's support (now turned resistance probably) so i'll be watching that level.

Should be a nice place to short with tight stops.

If that is broken up a long with stops below should be Fine for scalping. I still believe the trend is down so moving against the trend should be done with extra care.

Good luck everyone! 
Anyone else find it odd that all the major news publications are publishing the bitcoin artificial bubble story on the day bitcoin is at a critical level at the bottom of this horizontal support level?

LATimes, CNN, NYTimes, FT, on and on. How the hell do they all sync up like that?
Volume of this leg up is around 1/3 of our last leg down. As a lot of coins went into the market below 6.4k, I am quite sure we will have one more downside test before we move up, because some people are closing for a quick profit, when they see the first weakness.
Closed my long from 6360 at 6630 which is a nice little gain with the leverage.  Not confident that this will go up overnight and want to keep my powder dry for another long play if it goes down.  Yes, I think 6K is the bottom.  Looking back, that's quite a bit higher than I would have expected for a bottom a year ago.
Pump is definitely showing more immediate life than I expected (maybe this is where the news actually plays a factor). While we're gonna be running into resistance via profit taking every $100 increment, the resistance of the 4hr bear flag channel we just broke out of is now acting as support.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/jR8oRo4O/

Still not going to be sitting in my long above 7k when we touch the old log support line that is likely still resistance (already tested as such)
Nice to see a bull flag again, even though of course this could go South at any time...but thinking this SEC news rally has more legs, so going to stay with a small long for now.
Sorry for ETH TA here, but there is a bullish divergence developing on the daily chart - since the majors like to move together..
I have returned my bear paws and taken bull horns for today. Falling wedges all followed through recently, and the whipsaw to 6100 and some nice buying there have convinced me.
Short at 6576

Reasons: bear flag, rejected off resistance, bearish divergence on the 1 and 4 hour.

Will bail above 6700
I think it was pretty obvious that ETH and BTC aren't securities. This feels like a fakeout  and we'll more likely continue to go down in the next few days since we are in a bear market.
BitcoinMarkets fam,

My average cost per BTC is \~5800$ and should have / would have sold it earlier - was thinking of selling my stack at 7700 and moved them to the exchange, and then life took over the weekend and woke up to 6800.. fucking luck..

Since there is no bullish thesis at  the moment and I don't short / hedge, I'm thinking the best way to survive this bear market.. I won't call myself a HODLer as I actively track markets (and hence even more mad at myself for not getting out earlier) and take long positions on and off on a small stack. (Feb and April were good :) !

My goal is to not get out of the market but to increase BTC and be ready for the next run whenever it comes.

Should I capitulate with the goal of buying lower (lol, I'm so late to the party))

P.S - Not worried about taxes and was thinking of capitulating if / when we test the bottom of the triangle, which at the moment doesn't look to be happening..

Thanks!

Edit: thanks for the responses below - I posted this and while continued to decide, SEC news came in, so, no change for now. Tracking closely if this move has any legs.
I don't want to FOMO!

This has to go down again right ?
[deleted]
Still holding my long from $6250.  There are bull divs on the 4hr and so I'll let this develop 
over the course of the next week.  I think a reasonable target here is the $6900 - $7300 range.

There is a chance this doubles back to properly test the log line currently sitting at ~$5900, but I don't see it moving under in the very short term.

The primary constraints I'm working with are the top of the pennant and the log resistance from ATH.  I think it's unlikely that either will be broken and thus will provide good r:r for short and long plays respectively.  

If this premise holds true, it pushes a potential sub $5k capitulation event into mid to late July at the earliest.

I'm still very bearish mid-term and tend to think we're going to slow burn back to the mean.  This will be further confirmed if/when $6k breaks. 
It’s funny how we’ve all come to expect the Bart move, even though it demonstrates how utterly manipulated this market is 
Who's fomoing in on this? I'm torn. As always.
Google Trends jumpened from at 10 to a 14, that is really promising!

Is this a legit ascending wedge?  [https://imgur.com/a/6fs56Lu](https://imgur.com/a/6fs56Lu)

Edit: 30M Bbands tightend when a downbreak of the wedge is likly, that is pretty soon. Support sitting at 6484 USD atm
I still think we will probably get a multi-day bear flag/channel (ie-5/28-6/7 for example)...will have to see how far back down the price gets to really draw it, but over the past weeks this has been the pattern

Peace
Just a thought:

Since we are now in a lower low on longer timeframes, is it possible that many people are inclined to short again. Shorts pile on and longs maybe even start to close.

Now I’m a smart whale with plenty of splash. I see the number of short increase dramatically. Newer shorts probably have stops set at 6500+ while longs opening now or in the last couple days would have stops below 5900.

Why don’t I just market sell a fuckton of coins into my own limit buys in the obscenely low territory of sub 5500. I incite a panic by dropping the price to 5500, catch the wick all the way down and then market buy the fuck out of that bottom once my heavy limit orders hit.

There is 140 million in buy orders on the way down to sub 4500. You probably only need to use 10% of that to incite a wick that low... if you coordinate on other exchanges, arb bots will easily allow you to do this.

The same amount in buy orders would put the price well above 8k on Bitmex at this point.

All I’m trying to say is: It costs about 30 Million bucks to incite maximum pain by a single actor, and the result of that could very well be Bitcoin’s price being higher than it is now.

I don’t see how the other way: “first buy the price up and then dump it sub 6k” would work.

I’m gettingg ready for some massive fuckery....
Here some analysis of the current state of the CBOE and CME derivatives markets:

If you look at the most recent CTO report from June 5, here are how the futures traders are putting in their positions on CME and CBOE.

**CBOE Futures - each contract is 1 BTC**

Order | Asset Managers/Institutional | Levered Funds | Other Reportable  | Non Reportable
---|---|---|---|---|
Long | 153 | 1,455 | 1,109 | 2,483
Short | 28 |  3,915 | 700 | 557



**CME Futures - each contract is 5 BTC**

Order | Asset Managers/Institutional | Levered Funds | Other Reportable | Non Reportable

The categories by CFTC are broken down as following:

>* Asset Manager/Institutional. - These are institutional investors, including pension funds, endowments, insurance companies, mutual funds and those portfolio/investment managers whose clients are predominantly institutional.

>* Leveraged Funds. These are typically hedge funds and various types of money managers, including registered commodity trading advisors (CTAs); registered commodity pool operators
(CPOs) or unregistered funds identified by CFTC. The strategies may involve taking outright positions or arbitrage within and across markets. The traders may be engaged in managing and conducting proprietary futures trading and trading on behalf of speculative clients. 

>* Other Reportables - Reportable traders that are not placed into one of the first three categories are placed into the “other reportables” category.

>* Non-Reportable - Everyone else who isn't required to report to the CFTC. Usually small traders and non-institutional positions.

The "smart money" would be the first 2 categories (especially "levered funds" which is basically hedge funds). I'm not entirely sure what the "Other Reportables" category consists of for Bitcoin, but usually its large speculators/hedgers with a professional background, since they have to report to the CFTC. On the other hand the "non-reportable" category is the small speculators, the retail trader.

The same old pattern we've seen for months now exists, with professional traders being more biased towards shorting while the retail traders is incredibly bullish, especially on CBOE. 

In terms of professional traders:

------

CBOE: The total professional trader long positions are 2,717 and short positions are 4,643.

CME: The total professional trader long positions are 1,713 and short positions are 2,179.

If everybody thinks 5k is the bottom, we will not reach 5k, if everybody thinks 4k is the bottom, we will reach 5k, so far most people were calling for 5k, so I still doubt it will happen this cycle.
After months of Barts, if this fails to Bart and instead continues upward, I'm going to go ahead and call it bullish.
That september futures wick just gave me a nice gift!  Literally seconds after placing the order. 

200k sell when there was no liquid in the books.  Someone fucked up.
I have taken profit/closed all positions after a mega run of good trades.

For me the bottom is still not in, this is just a bounce after a lot of selling since 10K, and the filling out of the huge descending triangle which I believe will eventually break down. To my mind 10K was the bulltrap. I could see this going to perhaps 7200 but in the end I am eyeing 5k/3k/1.3k still.

Taking a little time off before the next leg down.

Good luck to all

Peace
Bitcoin is definitely feeling like a 6 coin now.

Gosh Bitmex is impossible. A month ago I “tried” to put in quite a large short @ 8328.. Wouldn’t go through - got frustrated and logged off. Decided I would try again today for the 1st time (life happend) - fucking thing went through. 290% profit. Looks like the only time i make money is when i dont know about it!😂
Going back in, I waited for that wick. Order at 6370 USD. Lets see. This time I want to trade in Chop City before we go to Goblin Town.
I got some charts! https://www.tradingview.com/x/0XX50yJ1/

We have some bullish divs (purple) on the 4H charts that if played out could give price a little boost. There's going to be strong resistance above if this pushes upward at 6.6K and 6.8K. Then the bottom of the meme triangle is around 7050. So that's a lot of work for bulls.

I'm still bearish as hell until the long and medium trend reverses. I got stopped out of my short as I suspected I would and opened a small long just in case bulls showed up and took BTC to 6.8K overnight, but that was a futile attempt and got stopped out this morning. I'm weary of opening longs until we're above 7K or below 6K. I have a hard time looking at the daily and seeing anything bullish about it right now https://www.tradingview.com/x/oQaMgRy9/

I posted yesterday or the day before that I thought BTC could pull the same shenanigan from when it was headed towards the bottom of the triangle and turn back right as it got close, only to climb and chop and finally go through strongly. And alas, that seems to be the case again. Price went lower than the April local low but stopped short from making a new lower low and testing the log down trend from ATH.

I'm going to exercise some patience here and wait for a decent short entry. Or FOMO a proper breakdown.

In the meantime, I'm gonna watch the world cup along with charts.

Don't get chopped up and good luck guys.

EDIT: a word, and fuck me I might not get a good entry.
If paper profits are not really profits, are paper losses also not really losses?
Bugger my arse.. is this another Bart move down?

Still, could be worse I guess... could be the guy somewhere in the world who just heard the snap of an anal bead break off inside his rectum. 

Think of that guy 
Alright, whose shorting this? 
If this pull back turns to a BRD that would upset a lot of people.

I feel like staying underwater is easier than seeing hope then having it taken away.

Popping popcorn.
!short XBTU18 6455 1x 100%

I said I'm gonna reenter higher. I have resistance at 6.5, we wicked above it and trading just below. This is just too good r/r. Bail out if we break 6.5

Edit: yeah, sometimes I 'love' trading futures. Entered 6455 when spot was 6490. Now futs are 6460 and spot 6470 :) And it's been like 20 mins.
Bitcoin broke downwards from the triangle that it had been going sideways in for weeks. We broke the key 6400 support. This is nothing but a little pump before more downwards action. I’m not saying it’s obvious but c’mon. 
The old resistance of the wedge turned support:

Holding onto my long from 6250 until we hit 6800 or break back below it
What a beautiful bullish engulfing candle on the daily. 
ascending "triangle" broke down.
Ok one more word for the folks that still think a new ATH is right around the corner.

If you look at the chart it is easy to see levels that were never tested with a retracement. I have lines on my chart that have been there since before the ATH. They are at roughly 8k, 5k,3k,1.3k. (3k was tested}

I got ridiculed and downvoted months ago when I said that 8k was never tested. " You are delusional we will never see below 10k again, we are going to 100k in 2018!"

Same thing with the lower targets.

2017 started out a a bull market but eventually became a massive speculative frenzy where people with no experience in markets or trading, and who knew little/nothing about crypto, threw money at any coin/token that moved. In many cases they made 1000's of percent gains.

The thought that " Hey, this year will be just like 2017, you buy in the Spring, and everyone gets a Lambo by Fall !" seems a bit far fetched to me.

This is not about whether BTC is fundamentally going to change the world, or institutional money,etc.

This is the aftermath of a frenzy where people just said the word "blockchain" or something, and released a token/coin that made them rich. 

Is it really that easy ?

damn- was sitting on the fence yesterday about buying below $6300- 10% to 7k on sub 25 rsi seemed like a great sure-thing trade, but here i am still out, lol.
my question: should 6100 bottom be looked at as a hammer type formation? it sorta looks like it on the 2hr-1d time-frames! even more interestingly- looks like a perfect bounce off the 3d 200u EMA...
I'm staying sceptical and don't think this is the run up yet. Too forced and we've seen this same Bart pattern before. Expecting a red dildo within the next 48hours.
I don't know which is better form of gambling.

Going to Vegas and getting a new one ripped or understanding the idiosyncrasies of BTC and getting a new one ripped.

The mind fuck is just lovely.

*Plays Pink Floyd: Comfortably numb* 
Does someone have "Coinbase Pro" working properly?

 If I need to enter a price value, it says "wrong value, closest value is X and Y" and I need to refresh the page and then it works if I copy-paste the same number [so the problem is not that the number is too precise, or I enter wrong format].

Is "Coinbase Pro" supposed to be in beta? Really don't understand how they can replace GDAX with a worse product.
The price action here reminds me a lot of the 7k levels starting around 5/29.  I guess we will chop around and form a huge ass symmetric triangle which will determine the fate of bitcoin.  Or, I could be totally wrong and it could shoot right back up into that original triangle with a 9k target (shrugs).
Shorting works, until it doesn't. Crypto is here to stay. The risk isn't holding, the risk is not holding and missing the bus. Very very long on this market generally, so I'm not particularly fond of shorting, especially after so much red over the last few weeks. 


Long and Strong 
I had drawn a very tentative bear flag/channel based on just those two high wicks and went long at the bottom at ~6375...these things are never exact and this is just one of those lucky times when it came out right for me.
This doesn't mean that this channel will hold true, but I will continue to watch it

BTW: we have now a bullish engulfing on the daily. 
This is feeling like bear market short hype cycle right now.

I'm so fucking glad i added to my holdings instead of cashing out.

so, are we going to bounce to 8k or what?
Is it really too soon to declare Lightning Network a failure? It was supposed to be production ready years ago now (it was needed a long time ago as well), and yet here we are, still waiting. Realistically, how long will the market wait on a scaling solution for BTC?

I really don't see how BTC can succeed without one, and I don't think calling it 'digital gold' will suffice.
My take on this tether situation :

If tether was initially backed by nothing and printed out of thin air to pump the price of Bitcoin by a small number of people then yeah fine, there were no complaints at the time. 

Bitcoins that were purchased using tether started when the price was relatively low and kept going up to 20k.

So who's to say that the early tether purchases 2k-3k weren't sold at 20k, 17-18k profit.

If they were clever about it then they would put this extra money in to their bank accounts to cover the later printed tether that was used to purchase higher priced Bitcoins.

2.2 billion dollars isn't much in the whole scheme of things and I'm sure they (bitfinex) have made much more than this over the past 12 months.

I don't agree with this but it can show that each printed tether is actually backed by 1 USD now.

If institutions ever do get involved fully in crypto, 2.2 billion is a drop in the ocean.
ETH pumping hard the past hour, confidence returning to crypto in the short run.... expect this to have legs for at least the rest of the day. Will start taking profit from my long from 6250 from 6800-7k
Could anyone speculate on the pain point for most of the recent shorts?

I don't short so haven't a clue.
On finex, this is respecting the constraints of a bear flag at the moment. It looks a bit different on stamp due to the different wicks. It looks like it broke up there. I'm not trading this. Just pointing out the variances in case anyone is relying on one or the other.

We are now at the same point as the end of October 2017, just before the bull run started to accelerate. I'm starting to think we are done going down. I'm slowly going to start buying waiting for the next halving. 
I expect a nice red candle to 6300 to complete the Bart formation.
Question, if people can trade both ways on Bitmex etc (long and shorts).. then don’t people place 2 trades, one long, one short and set right stops so if it goes in either direction you come out on top?
Interesting to see BTC dumping together with the dollar index (DXY) rallying. BTC/USD down 1.4%, BTC/EUR down 0.3%. The Euro is dropping hard
A "Failure to Bart" or "Stairway to Heaven" formation here would be extremely bullish. With regard to TA, we are writing the textbook as I type, folks.
Back of my envelope says new ATH at $24K sometime in September, then a pullback to maybe $15K, followed by a new ATH of around $35K by end of year. Call me crazy. Downvote me. I could probably give not nearly as much as a fuck... but I don't.
A whole fuckton of people will kick themselves for the rest of their lives for not buyng/selling/shorting Bitcoin right now. Downvote away.
Hanging on to my long from 6360.  It's been 18 hours since the last dump, or if there was one, it got bought up.   Or it's a bull trap, which is fine.  Setting a stop at 6380 just in case.  It's just fun money.

[edit -- 6ks.]
I think that pop was a dead cat bounce. We barely tested/broke 6200 yesterday which was not the low from February of 5900. The Feb low was return to the mean on an overly inflated price. I am long on bitcoin but I think we will break 6k and maybe touch 5k. The past few weeks btc has been at almost no volume and the trend is continuing. Interest has been dying down. Google trends of "buy bitcoin" and "bitcoin" are at lows, people have lost interest who were in it for the quick buck. Once btc starts to get more of an interest or hits a new low i think the new highs will be in the future. I could be entirely wrong but we'll see.

Another thing to note, when BTC hit 1200 back in 2013/14 it eventually reached below $200 and then never got back to 1200 till 2017 spring. I don't think this will happen to BTC as its support is there now, but I dont think 6k is the bottom. 

June 8th-9th had a volume of only 2775 coins before it broke to the 6k's the following day. Volume dropping that low means interest is down and i think we will see a new low.
yall be careful about fomoing here. seems like a trap. we are not out of the woods by any means. im expecting 6k or sub 6k once again. just looks like an obvious trap imo. 
https://bravenewcoin.com/news/bitcoin-price-analysis-a-slow-bleed/
Here's some good trading advice.  

1.  If someone is acting like you should be afraid to buy or sell try to figure out if their motives are pure.  Do they hold a position that benefits by your action?  

2.  Fear isn't a great reason to do anything if you are looking to make good decisions.  

3.  Being worried about losing money is the best way to lose money.  Make decisions with your brain.

4.  The best indicator is price.  To make money in a market the price you buy or sell at has to be different than what you originally bought or sold at.  So if you're a buyer buy low.  If you're a seller sell high.  

5.  Sentiment can be manipulated and is actively being manipulated.  

6.  Technical analysis alone is not enough.  The chart is a function of reality and not the other way around.

7.  Short selling has higher risk and lower potential profit per trade than going long.  A short sale is not just one transaction, it is two.  To trade short you also have to buy back what you sold.  In theory your buying action should balance out your initial sale.  It requires you to be right a much higher percentage of the time than going long requires.  If you have the ability to time the market, go for it.  
Still holding my shorts, for those looking to short: [if this breaks](https://i.imgur.com/q5A81kH.png) this is probably a good moment to jump in.

Edit: On [Bitfinex](https://i.imgur.com/4bRdB2T.png) it has already re-tested $6600 from below and is on its way down.

Edit 2: Boom.
When you guys say closing your short/long are you talking selling/buying bitcoin or are you all actually doing margin trading? 

Also, are there any sites that do options trading? Guessing the prices would be pretty ridiculous because of the variance though.
I just think all the TA is useless now. Bitcoin will do what it wants and when it wants. 
Is it me or in 2018 every effin poster on crypto twitter influencer comments is a TA expert?

Look at the comments on Philakone's tweet:

Funny how ETC gave no fucks on this latest micro bull run, up like 1% last I looked compared to ETH's 10% and BTC's 5%.  Some friends fomo'd in at ~$16.50 on the coinbase news and are crying now.
Whales show the articles it wasn’t artificial for the pump that happened. Show that they must believe in and join crypto 
Get ready! testing 6k1 again in a few hours. I think it will break through it this time. :/

I have to admit that I have been posting some wrong headed things lately. While it is true that I have been shorting since $15k, I have given credit mainly to the blockstream core devs who have made lightning network not work as the reason for my success. But as we all learned, we should also thank tether and bitfinex for artificially raising the price in the first place. Thanks to all of them for my great success. Still plan on shorting because I see a lot more downside yet to come.

Top 3 regions (South Afrika, Ghana, Nigeria) probably looking for a way to dump their own local fiat shitcoins.

Edit: Nigeria: 12&#37; inflation, Ghana: 17&#37; inflation, South Africa: Rand lost 26&#37; of its value
Possibly cause it dumped? Search trends spike on dumps 

Not to mention Tether paper, manipulation articles, SEC/CFTC stuff etc
well not really doubled, more like a 33&#37; increase, that is remarkable, but if you zoom out it might not be the trend reversal. time will tell.

the attention could have caused these tether articles that everything was artificially pumped... if so, I doubt *this* will attract new investors.
It's high school bullshit.

But since we are talking about the state of the sub, isn't it crazy that yesterday we were about to break 6K and expecting a technical bounce, we got it, and everyone is bullish again? Longs have increased, RSI has reset across the board. Daily looks like a bear flag. Maybe I'm dead wrong though.
It's a little funny, though.

This is retarded. You're condoning manipulative voting and posting. The people to throw out are the ones posting fake information and using alts to vote and comment in their favor. 

Don't be *fooled*. Mods should ban *those* people.
You and I are known to disagree on a lot. I like you and respect you, but we get into it sometimes. You might be one of my favorite people to disagree with, actually.

I can't disagree with you on this.
Makes me wish i wasn’t just some white boy from Jersey. 

Who would  have ever guessed this stuff
What has me confused is that the coins that this negatively effects haven't realized that yet. They're just pumping along with the news obliviously. Someone should tap them on the shoulder and let them know.
This is actually very bad news for BTC/ETH, the ratio is taking a dump. ;-)
I hate to say "this news is different", so I guess i'll just say this was the topic that was making alot of people squeamish on Ethereum in recent months. This really does alleviate some significant investment concerns.
We were already having a technical bounce starting at 6.1k, think this is mostly a continuation of that with the news adding just a little bit of fuel. Not enough to spurn a mega rally IMO
I think this will be short lived. The news alone are not enough for this dildo...

I mean, it went vertical... it's not steep, it's vertical...

I just want one more wick to fill some more of my sell orders.
>I need some time off for a breather from the markets. We'll see what it looks like over the weekend.

I'll see you tomorrow when 6800 keeps getting rejected.
Shit happens. Did this mistake couple of times already ;-)

Set alarms at 6k and 7k and go for a rest ;-)
Translation:  I had a long and I was lucky to make some money.  I am out of the market now because it's so scary.  I would like you to sell as well and you should trust me because I have no financial interest in the outcome.  
Genuinely considering longing this or closing a bit here too, but this is sloping  up, not down. Why are you guys calling it a bull flag? it doesn't really look like one.

Only reason I'm wary is because we tend to do this weird pattern I like to think of as an overextended bull flag, where instead of people taking profits it just slow climbs upwards. Then it gets dumped on once the last buyer FOMOs in. Did the same thing at $7950 to $8600 and $7040 to $7750

Slowly trickling up always has me cautious lately.

Then again slowly trickling up often results in a big fat Bart upwards 
Ripple?
hasn't this already been stated like last week.
ETH or BTC itself, but if an ERC20 token is offered in certain ways as an ICO, can that not still fit the description of a security?

I missed where this diverges upon expectations and previous language.

Incisive analysis of the impact of the SEC's decision on the markets:

> Had the SEC deemed ether or bitcoin securities, cryptocurrency markets would have likely been sent into a selling frenzy
what are the tax implications?
That's because it's not even great news and doesn't change the fundamentals much.  Nothing really changed and the news is that a negative change (classifying ETH, etc as a security) is just less likely to occur now.
Great analysis as always. I wonder how strong resistance, if any, the bottom of the meme triangle will be. I might be too bearishly biased to to think that 7Ks is possible.

You mean news we already knew? The Jay Clayton interview from a few days ago already made it clear that BTC was not a security... 
This is a new feature, just been released.

Or someone believes that was the bottom and wants to get in and has FOMO. 

Looks a lot like a bottom to me. 
If true, it's an incredible opportunity: A predictable market move. (Edit: If I understand you correctly, a whale with enough muscles to force the market is pushing the price. That's your theory, right?)
I'm with you. I doubled my short from 7500 on June at 6590 (on June). If we leg up again though I'm going to bail very quickly. 
WTF!!! that is awesome! :)
Last time I saw a 500btc long opened, and not long after a BGD appeared. I'm not saying it will happen again but it wouldn't surprise. You'd think those people that open 1000btc longs would have some sort of knowledge that the price will move in their direction, whether they're taking a gamble on the market, or they're pumping bitcoin themselves.
And completely no follow-up on this.
Yeah I thought the time was right
Now he's got buyers remorse.
barely any effect on the market. btc cant catch a break
Some SEC member probably.
BBQ Bear is my favorite dish.lol
Wow, looks like bot ping-pong scalping indeed.
It has become self aware!
Mezmerizing.
I'm of the opinion that we saw the year's bottom at \~$6000. The thing is that when we're comparing the 2013 run with the 2017 run, you're comparing a steep run with one that's not so much so. For example, about 2 months before the peak in 2013, the price was about 12&#37; the value of the 2013 peak; 2 months before the 2017 peak, the value 2 months before was was 20&#37;. Without as violent a move up, you don't see as violent a drop.

So, I say that it also makes sense that with more price discovery at lower levels done (your scope being -66&#37; and -87&#37;), the price is less likely to just plummet below -66&#37; of the ATH.

Time will tell. I've said it before, and I'll say it again. I really believe 2018 will prove itself to be more analogous of 2015 than it is 2014.
It just means it's retraced more before than it has now. 

But probabilisticly I don't think you can really say that that means there is less probability to see that again.  If you flipped a coin heads twice in a row, it is not more inclined to be tails next time.

Psychologically it's probably the opposite, the cherry for a larger range has been popped, we are used to big bursts in bubbles.
Bulls are winning. lol get out of here
Yes, SEC news is huge. Uncertainty is the biggest hurdle for many bigger investors.
I don't get why people think eth doesn't move the market...btc isn't even at 50% dominance anymore and ETH is the on ramp for tons of coins. of course btc moves the market the most but when BTC stops moving eth does its own thing and the market generally seems to follow 

What doesn't really make sense is that lots of alts will be deemed securities but they all pumped anyway. 

Not to mention btc pumped and...no one ever thought it was a security 

so it seems like eth is leading 
Agreed.  I went 100% Eth at 0.058 and back to 100% BTC at 0.083 in antipation of BTC taking off like it did last fall.  Not happening yet!  Let's see if the ratio can set a new local high (close above 0.081)
They have a mobile app?
Wait, if you can't use bitmex at work, but you can access it on your phone, then why don't you set up your phone as a wifi hotspot when you need to make a trade?
Bitmex works well

We bounced off the bottom of the 12 period EMA on the 4H and we are back below it on the 15M charts. If that’s the extent of the relief bounce from 6140, BTC is not looking very strong. 

I have scaled in buys from 6150 down to 5950, but I may move the further down if we see volume on a flush from here. 

Edit: And there goes the hourly as I typed this post. RSI would indicate a ways to go downward here.

Here's a better option: DCA into another short. Although no need to rush it. 
Both those things happen almost constantly everyday.
Try not to overthink it.   Every strategy is a common strategy for "whales", because there are plenty of people with big money in this market and they try every strategy, good or bad, smart or dumb.

Flash crash to sub-2000.
I posted this last night...but that’s just my opinion on it.

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8qphc3/comment/e0mvizg
2.7k
Long-term? No idea. Though on this current drop, I wouldn’t be surprised to see as low as $5300. That’s how far we dipped during the November bear trap, so it has some historical significance as support. If we get a nice V-bottom, that may wind up being a long-term bottom. However, this could easily bleed out for months, then my guess is maybe the $3k-$4k range based on previous crash patterns and % drop from ATH.
Remember that people had $25 - $40K targets for the top.
A $4k or 5k target for the bottom might be the bear's equivalent.
4.9k
6.1K was the bottom.
If your going to try, go all the way
THE ONLY ONE HE IS
Super fascinating - BBands on the weekly the tightest since end of 2016!
I like the way you worded that. I feel like that will stick with me for awhile
No, *I'm* Chad!
I'll throw some info your way. I'm sure others will as well. There are a lot of dicks in this sub, so brush them off if they give you beef.

You're making the right call starting with GDAX (i.e. no leverage). Be prepared to pay tuition in the form of bad trades. Start small and don't get discouraged *or* cocky. 

Honestly, I would also recommend not trading anything besides BTC to start. It's the most liquid and least volatile, believe it or not. Once you learn the mechanics of trading better, you could branch out to other coins if you want to. I personally only trade BTC. The smaller the coin, the more susceptible to manipulation through pump & dump or other means (although sometimes BTC feels like this too). It's easy to get wrecked on small coins. Yes you can make a lot if you trade them well, but you probably won't. Not intending to be mean, just as a new trader, I'd avoid them.

A bart is a made-up chart "pattern" that doesn't exist outside the cryptosphere. It's basically a long vertical move followed by flat chop and then a mirroring vertical move. It draws the outline of Bart Simpson's head.

A bull flag is a vertical move followed by chop that "flags" downwards. This is due to longs taking profits and people "selling the top" of the movement. Bull flags are traditionally a bullish pattern, and are expected to break upwards out of the flag, though that's far from a guarantee. Bear flags are the exact same in reverse.

Yes, a stop will trigger a move to reduce or close your position when the price reaches a certain point. They are most commonly and effectively used as a loss mitigation tool. You can choose to use a stop limit order or a stop market order, but most of us here use stop market orders in order to guarantee execution. If you need your stop, it sure as hell better execute. 

I use tradingview for charting, and I chart primarily on Bitstamp and occasionally check/compare with Bitfinex.

Good luck.
Most of the basic questions you are asking are easily found online if you take the time to read. I'm not trying to be a dick but you need to inform yourself first before starting to trade. This is how people get burned and lose their shirt. Think of it this way, would you start brewing beer without even knowing what a grain or a hop is? Or the difference between an ale and a lager? That's basically where you are right now.

If I were you I would read this from top to bottom before I start trading https://www.babypips.com/learn/forex 

For example: [bear flags](https://www.babypips.com/learn/forex/pennants) and [stop losses](https://www.babypips.com/learn/forex/undergraduate-senior#setting-stop-losses)
Use really really small amount to start. You don't even have basic knowledge.

Google and investopedia is your friend. You can read there about flags.

Bart is inner joke. It's when price suddenly goes up, sideways and back down.

You've got tools and settings on bitcoinwisdom charts, you set there various stuff.

Really watch for yourself.

Sorry that's not too much info but barely have time now. Feel free to ask on PM if you need something and won't get rest of the answers here.
> How do you decide what coins to trade on? There's so many, where do you even start? I'm not asking WHAT coins to trade on, I want to be able to make my own, informed decisions. But I don't even know where to start.

Just start looking at charts and graphs and try to notice if you can see any patterns forming yourself.

I made some really easy money last year once I realized how to track true uptrends. It was awesome! Just wait for the train to leave and hop on board.

Not as easy to do this year, but I have a feeling one is about to leave the station shortly if you catch my drift ;)

As for what a bear/bull flag/pennant is... this is the best explanation I have found: https://www.investopedia.com/university/charts/charts6.asp

>What charts do you use? I just made an account with Bitcoin Wisdom, but I can't find how to make it a candle chart. 

Definitely sign up for a free account on tradingview.com, and cryptowat.ch is great to get a wide look at all of the top alts trading right now.
As far as learning the basics of T.A I suggest Node Investor's youtube channel. He does live streams  and points out patterns etc. His video course is pretty solid and I've watched it about 4x. Covers all the basics, patterns, RSI, MACD and other indicators. That gave me a good base to build my experience off of to where I'm pretty confident when it comes to charting. 

Realize you're going to lose money doing this before you get better. 

Bitmex also has a TestNet so if you want to learn to go short/long jump on that too. 
i rememeber the "9.2 and 10.2 holding strong" memes 
And then the week after that we'll feel bullish holding above 1200, and by august whales will be paying us to take the corn off their hands, right?
A drop from 8200 to 6200 is a 25% drop.

A drop from 6200 to 4200 is a 33% drop.

define bullish though, I call that bullish because I could expect a retrace if we hold above 6.2

targets are 6800, 7000 , 7200

then after the retrace we return back to our regular scheduled programming
No it won’t
Thank you for your sacrifice. 
Time in market > timing market

This is especially true with Bitcoin.
Hidden bear div, yeah.
Got a bunch of replies that weren't there anymore when I came back!? Talked about a bullish divergence, which I suppose was this one (red), which should be stronger than a hidden bear div. Including this reply just to give some perspective to my comment, although I'm seeing the price breaking an ascending wedge as I'm writing.

awesome thanks!
what is that software that runs the charts?
Well also reminds me of the bottom 1 week ago at 7.2 somebody said exaclty the same as you now. 
I did all the buying I wanted to do. Now, I'm just hoping I can get a good price on the June Futures I have... The September Futures and perpetual swap longs I have, I'm not worried about, it's just the June Futures...
People are pissed off every day with the market when they miss a movement or reversal, big or small.

Could just as easily say "If this is indeed another dead cat bounce and not the bottom, so many ppl are going to be pissed off because they thought it was the bottom and they lose money.  Kinds of reminds me last summer when this happened as well".
FML, plans thrown out the window.

SEC declared BTC and ETH aren't securities, but certain ICO's are

Edit for link: https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/14/bitcoin-and-ethereum-are-not-securities-but-some-cryptocurrencies-may-be-sec-official-says.html
Bears are only up about 70% in the last six months.  And sentiment didn't switch.   Most people in here are still medium term bearish.  If you think switching from a long to short is changing "sentiment" that is goofy.  I sometimes go from long to short and back 3 or 4x in a day, if not an hour.
I think it's more precaution. A lot of people went long or closed shorts just in case. For now we're basically where we were yesterday, if this doesn't break through 6.8-7k range soon then we'll see another drop.
> The sentiment sure did switch in an instant.

I keep getting confused by this. It has been nothing but bear since January. Except for moon memelords I haven't seen anyone hopeful here about BTC's future.
I have res at just above 6.5, we took it as support, broke it, the established as resistance just before 6.1 wick, now we bounced from it and had a failed attempt to break it.

But 6.6 is next step. Moved my stops above 6.6 but gonna watch closely if we break 6.5 again.

TBH I still don't see it going to test 7k. There's no formation we can actually draw here. Small ascending triangle and ascending wedge with 2 touch points and both don't look valid. 1k market buy (actually 1.5k) that didn't have any follow up, some shorts took profit but looks like they're waiting to reopen higher, some longs opened but looks more like knife catching.

I'm getting a bit sick of this. I'm really gonna run a 'toss coin bot' that just flips a coin and open random position with 1% stops and trailing profit taking... Should be as profitable as any TA trading here.

And as I wrote this we managed to run another test of 6.5 break.
This is extremely dangerous to our democracy. 
The establishment wants your digital gold. In times like this you need courage and vision.
No.  If they published it when it was up it has less gravity and creates less of a mini media frenzy cycle.  They can feed off it better in this situation.  Bring excited attention when things are exciting and looking up, bring despair to despair.  The viewers/advertisers wouldn't have it any other way.
It was probably just a wire report that came in to everyone.
Well BTC has been at critical support levels every day for the past few months. Modern journalism is unfortunately cut-and-pasting whatever the latest press release is - thats why it's called "churnalism".
They don't, one publishes and the rest regurgitate, remove your tin foil hat

If a government, or the 'powers that be' to use conspiracy speak wanted to kill BTC they would have done so long ago.

BTC has broken critical supports many times in the past months also
What's really funny is that the true story is not manipulation up last year, it's manipulation down this year, and I happen to think that this story is part of said manipulation. There's zero evidence that Tether wasn't fully backed. I'm cynical and suspicious of the news, though, having some experience in the PR game.
time to buy in other words
For syncing, go look up News Same Script.  
If bitcoin is antifragile bad news is good news and good news is good news but no news is bad news.
Easy, they [read it from a script](https://www.mediaite.com/tv/twitter-in-shock-over-video-showing-local-tv-anchors-forced-to-read-script-about-fake-news/) 
no, I do not find it odd.  I find it odd that btc is still over 6k.
They purposely try to drive the price down. Kick it while it's down, imho. 
I heard local talk radio mention the price yesterday and they never mention the price. This is coordinated for sure.
it used to work when there were high percentage of plebs on the way down from 20k. at this level most of the space are aware of their shenanigans and wont fall for it (sell @6k!)
A 1000 BTC long was opened hours before the news came out. Probably just your average crypto-gambler right?
All owned by the same dudes that chill in the same boardrooms. ezpz
What is remarkable, if true, that you can pump Bitcoin with 2 Billion to these numbers (20k and market cap of whole crypto market at \>800 Billion).
[removed]
nice job man...Not sure I get why you'd close here if you expect $6k to be the bottm. it's a 5% difference...unless you secretly don't :P 
probably just wicking out of it
You're talking about the big pennant?  I haven't seen it as being tested as resistance... [I'm showing it at $7230 currently.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/JUdLj5FE/)
I trade ETH more than BTC.... but this community is a lot cooler so only mention it a every so often here except when someone else mentions it first (like now lol).
Chart? I don't see it.
BTC is the one major, the one king to rule them all. There is one major and a few minors, and a bunch of shit.
Sell signal
Bear flag on the daily?
RIP
Well BTC was already confirmed as not being a security in the Jay Clayton interview from days ago. 
Oh come on, publicly announcing ETH not being a security is extremely bullish, even if we all thought it probably would be. For sure one of the most bullish announcements in the past few months. 
from my point of view the bearish sentiment is a bit too strong that we just go directly from 10k to 5k. also I dont think it will be made so easy for the break out traders from the large triangle...
> I think it was pretty obvious that ETH and BTC aren't securities.

What does that matter?  It's obvious they aren't commodities either, but part of the US gov't says that they are, for their purposes.
If you're unsure if you should sell or hodl, remember you could simply "hedge".  Sell half to buy lower OR open a small short to help offset downward movement (with very low multiplier, like 2 or 3x).  Just a suggestion - you do you!
If you have no experience to navigate the "chop town" we are in now, and the market situation is tough in this range, you should be better off to either hold with conviction, or try to find safe and long positions, e.g. stop loss at 'breakeven' with your input, 5900 maybe (so you end up 1:1 worst case scenario) or e.g. stop loss under major resistance lines, e.g. in retrospect, stop loss at 7500 (after watching all the chopping 7500-7800). 

If you don't know what to do and don't want to sell, mid-range holding (1-3 months) is likely safer for you than shorting and getting rekted now. Within the 'up then down then up then down' cycle Bitcoin's been this year, odds are in your favor this way, as very likely we are at the 'down' moment now.

Edit: Better clarity
Having sold hoping to buy in lower in the past, I wouldn't recommend it.
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deltahedging.asp
To me, the "no bullish thesis" is the bullish thesis itself.  When everyone expects an asset to decline, it typically rises - nothing is guaranteed, but this is what I expect with bitcoin here. 
Yes, you should capitulate so we can finally go up.

/S
Never holding paper losses for long periods of time while setting up an initial investment is a bizzarre concept to me. Not sure how to respond.
Down eventually... up in the short term seems very possible based on how soaked things have been recently and the fact that the charts are looking as if $6100 was the local bottom - small capitulation candle and quick pickup, downtrend resistance broken last night and a handful of buyers fomo-ing in to provide a relief rally.  This is how I'm reading it.  In the immediate term, you'll probably get another buy opportunity at $6450-$6500 range.  
you don't have to worry about fomo until 10k breach, solidly in the noise range
at least wait until we're either broken out of the channel or back near the bottom of it ~6450-6500

Set limit sell @ 6848 for two days ago. Good spot. Selling some old p2pool mined coins.
There's no way we're going sub $5k. If you don't see that by now, nothing will convince you.

Green on my long from 6600. All those people who made fun of me, well, I'm the winner in 6 out of my last 7 trades so ask me how much your little digs hurt. Not closing this one and still not placing a stop.
The bart move is the consequence of what the market has become. Fewer "investors", more traders. Those traders have been burned often so use tight market stop loss. Low volume, low liquidity. Order books are so thin they cannot absorb a big market buy/sell, so of course people with big pockets take advantage of this. 
> even though it demonstrates how utterly manipulated this market

How does it do that? There are other theoretical explanations... How about everyone expects it so it happens? It becomes self-reinforcing market behavior. 

Moreover, how does the bart manipulation favor the supposed manipulator?  
Oh hi another Bitcoin skeptic!
I bought in the minute I saw the news and surge in volume 
I'm in. Despite my bearish bearing I was able to justify this decision by zooming out on the daily chart. It looked to me like bears got overextended yesterday. Also, good SEC news for Eth today and CBOE futures closed yesterday. Higher low on the 4hr, engulfing bullish daily candle in the making, decent green volume.. Emotions did the rest 

EDIT: expect more chop until we conquer daily EMA12 (it's way up at ~7,03k atm) so use protection/stop losses ppl!
LOL, whenever I bring up google I'm told it a lagging indicator...
Lagging indica... oh wait it's realtime right now.

Actually I'm curious, 6% or so 24 hour gain in BTC.  Is 10-14 trend a 4% gain or a 40% gain, what's the units there?
FYI, the google trends incomplete datapoints have been really off when I'm watching them.

Zoom to the 90 day though and you can see an increase in interest.  That is very positive indeed, we'll see if it holds and continues.  Good find, thanks!
I always go to Google news and there's been loads on bitcoin / tether report. Each day same story, different source.
kinda forced, I think it looks more like an ascending triangle.
It's what I'm watching.

On stamp: https://www.tradingview.com/x/8FBFV6b1/
Our interpretations are completely the opposite: https://www.tradingview.com/x/s4eO1qgE/

Bitcoin has not recently failed a falling wedge as far as I know, and after a fakeout (bullish signal), it's making an inverse H&S to break the red resistance, with the right shoulder supported by the top of the ascending wedge
If I were said whale with an interest in the price going higher... 

I would be very hesitant to push us under the psychological $6k barrier (and our triple bottom base) set on February 6th of 2018 for any reason.
That's stop hunting what you describe here. It happens sometimes.
The main reason I'd say is they need liquidity to cash out. I don't think there will be the same liquidity to cash out up higher even if they do pump it. 

Another BGD stop hunt would honestly probably result in a lot of people getting frustrated and leaving, not buying higher. 

If the move up doesn't look legit I'm not sure anyone's going to want to buy high because they know it'll just come back down eventually 
> It costs about 30 Million bucks 

risk none is willing to take. the amount of fud being spread yesterday and today makes me think it wont be easy ...
* https://www.tradingview.com/x/dT96NbqS/
* https://www.tradingview.com/x/ejxVzJmO/

Settling leverage in their current ranges for months has me confused. Leveraged positions have very tight BBands and very low volatility. Something is going to snap.
No way. 30 million is nothing in this market. You'd get bought out in the first 30 seconds of your dump. 
[deleted]
Do you happen to have the data from 5 May? I honestly can't google it, trying though.
Make sure someone double checks these numbers.
A lot more leverage on the short side. That's bullish. Means they can't afford to hold on to it for long.
Everyone thought $10k was moon. 

Everyone said $7.5k so quickly was impossible, then we hit $5.9k.

With such a raw psychological market like bitcoin's, ideas like these tend to extremify. 

They compound upon themselves and reinforce themselves when the goal comes closer.

People see the market collectively turning bearish as a bullish thing but it's absolutely not. The market was bullish as all fucking hell in 2017. 

People buy low if they expect it to go higher. 

Now that we are at $6k for the third time there are plenty of people questioning themselves and wondering if it's time to get out on a bounce. 

The only way the "it doesn't get there" thing occurs is if strong hands step in and buy/sell first. If the strong hands are absent/hesitant that's when you get these extreme wicks and blow off tops and dumps

Every single trader I respect/learned from here is bearish, literally even some of the more moonboi ones. 
This is contradicted by the fact the first time we went to 6k, while hovering around and above 10k everyone thought 8k was the bottom, but it went to 6k.
Monthly support is like $4,700 so I can see it wicking there but it might be such a huge and obvious support that we never get there. 

I agree, I think the 5100-5400 area will be the bottom, strong reversal back to 6500-6900, and we will form an inverse H&S on the daily...leading to a breakout to $9K+ and official end of bear market. (Our current price action between 6100-6900 is the left shoulder)
Obviously, everyone doesn't think any one number is the bottom.
please let us know when you go long
Are you saying we're at the top of a bart?
Seems like we’ll find out verrryyy soon here. 
What I want to know is why Bart just came this year and not last year even pre 5k levels
Whoops. Nice.
That was more like 1.5m sell...

You know, that could be a very large short hoping for a nice entry.
Great timing!
1.3k? lmfao you guys are trying too hard
Translation:  I just made a bunch of money and am leaving the market now because it's starting to go up.  Even though I have no positions in the market I decided to make this post to tell you that the price isn't done going down.  I have no position and really don't care about the price but I want to make sure you don't buy here because I want to make sure the most negative scenario happens because I really do have a position and am desperate for this to keep dropping.
It got us sick in february, we built up the immunity in april, and now we've accepted walking around the quarantine zone without a facemask.
If they show you error - it doesn't go through.

When you click and nothing happens - you've got into the queue and it'll execute as soon as queue before your order empties.

You need to double check your orders.
What kind of leverage are you using? I would close that trade ASAP before you get rekt.
I wish my last trade hadn't gone through.


Now we get to find out if this was another classic dump move:  

1) Test downward liquidity  
2) Place buy wall to prop the price/instill confidence of BTFD  
3) Fill up short orders  
4) Pull buy wall & market sell  
5) ???  
6) Profit
Long you mean? I was thinking half Barts are prolly a good entry in this shitty market. Good luck! 
I'm worried that the bull div may have already played out with the bounce already seen.


I see you're a TD man.  What do you think of the 1 day?
> bullish div

Good call on that TA man! It just pulled through!
Just be a man and long.
What about paper cuts, are those real?
Actually you've lost 100% when you moved $ from your account. Now you've got some kind of token that may give you your $ back. More or less than you had initially. Or the whole system can collapse of you can lose your keys and you'll never see your $ again.

So... Yes, it's all on paper.
Both are real, just unrealized for tax purposes. 
That's the last thing one says before being liquidated, when in a state of denial that it is really going to happen, yet having accepted the clear eventual outcome.
You're in my thoughts.
[deleted]
The market seemed to moved, first such action since the drop on Saturday:

Following /u/arsonbunny 's model, currently (shrimp <1BTC, mid 1<x<5, whale 5<x), ratios of buys to sells:

* Bitfinex 15 min = S 1.2, M -1.3, W 1.4
* Bitfinex 60 min = S 1.1, M 1.1, W 1.4
* Gdax 15 min = S 1.9, M 1.1, W 1.8
* Gdax 60 min = S 2.1, M -1.1, W 1.6 
didnt we just break through the downtrend line? I'm first gonna see if this has sideways power.
The price wicked down to 6430 on the hourly on Bitmex but was pushed back up. Wonder whether this has much more steam if it can bust through 6500?

I’m long from 6280 with stops at 6400 so comfortable, but would expect a bit more of a push before retrace, considering how far we’ve fallen, and the size of the wick at 6200 yesterday.
I'm not too familiar with using stop loss. How would you set stop loss in this case?

Stop Market order at like 6510? There seems to be many types of stop orders, and I was wondering which you find the best
We broke "the key 6400 support"... and yet, here we are...

So either it wasn't so key, OR, (dun dunnn) ???
The majority are primed for a drop which takes a huge amount of volume away from any potential pump. Whales are best off letting this bleed out and getting it over and done with IMO.
Good bull case, and congrats on a nice trade.  What I don't like however is that the upward movements only comes in 1 minute candles.  Could be someone trying to the breakout and resistance turn support that you are pointing out.  We'll see if everyone else is buying into it.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/RXIKupxT/

I have it drawn like this. Seems like it's right below the top of the wedge
What site do you guys use to short and long? Where can I get started
If this was an ascending wedge, the breakdown wasn’t particularly violent either. I think people are too quick to draw trend lines here before a trend has been formed.
Pretty much all you said is correct, but for some reason this common sense does not sit well with some folks here. Saying that you are stupid not to long this in the long term because we are GUARANTEED to hit new ATH at some point, however.. Upvotes, always.

There are more grounded people here too, though. I've found them to have the most interesting insights. 
> I have lines on my chart 

Good for you. 
Translation:  I want to make money short selling so please never believe in Bitcoin again until I buy back in.  
Thanks for the downvotes, they are how I know that the bear market is not over lol.

I really do wish you all the best.

If we go to the moon I plan on being along for the ride so good luck out there

Peace
Yes, everyone gets a Lambo this year 
Back in March 2017, 1.3K acted as resistance and btc saw a pullback before going through on a second attempt. Do we need to retest 1.3K before moving up? Are those levels set in stone?

Just asking because going under 2K is my panic zone.

Edit: I guess my question wasn't clear enough, got me a downvote. I'm questioning 1.3K because it was over a year ago. How far back can we go to find levels that haven't been retested? Does 1.3K need to be retested before we can move forward? 
It's not going to happen soon, but it's going to happen. We're a lot closer to $20K than we were this time last year.
Why?

Without the answer to "why" this is a rule 3 violation.
I think sometimes we just gotta accept that we missed the train and have to wait for the next one.  Its already pumped more than 5% and all oscillators are reset up to almost a 1d time frame. Sure it can bounce to the 7k range, but is it gonna be another DCB? If you look at the 1d chart, this shit sure looks pretty bad, lol... which is probanly why we didn't buy in yesterday.

TLDR - don't FOMO, or FOMO carefully 
Went short, stop loss 6610. Waiting for the Bart.

>understanding the idiosyncrasies of BTC 

Well that's your problem right there.
Are you entering the current price or something?
I was a bear as much as the next guy these past few weeks, but this was a high volume move up after some substantial positive news. 

The market moved with confidence and had me feeling good about the r/r for a long  
Well, we fell through 6400-6600 range pretty easily this time. That was where it stopped twice before, so might be important, right.

So, based on that, I'd be surprised if we formed yet another important support just under it. Disappointment does not disappear so close to a lost battlefield. So my theory is that we will get some more air under 6400 and next big supports will form well below 6000. 
 > ass symmetric triangle which will determine the fate of bitcoin.

the fate of bitcoin does not depend on homo morphic TA shapes


I'm reminded of April 1st where it hit 6400, then three days later 7400, then 6500 three days after that then went off towards 10k.

Longing works, until it doesn't, etc.

In a bull market like 2017 the risk is not holding. Sitting in fiat is the bear market version of holding.
Its amazing how each time we go lower it takes less and less for people to believe we're going to the moon again. 
> Shorting works, until it doesn't. Crypto is here to stay. The risk isn't holding, the risk is not holding and missing the bus. Very very long on this market generally, so I'm not particularly fond of shorting, especially after so much red over the last few weeks.

I believe it's supposed to engulf the entire candle (wick included).
We had a nice bullish candle off 7050. Our current candle could just mean more chop while all the indicators cool off.
[removed]
I'm thinking it will break up to 7k1 here and coming down again.
deflating volume. Seems we'll be headed down again through the weekend at least. to where? I dont know.
no
Possible, but unlikely.  Too many people have given up on the bull returning and they will likely mercilessly sell/short this long before it gets near 8k.
Probably within 24 hours.
Boy LN has really been under attack the past few days. I can’t imagine a group of individuals who would be low enough to attack it during these trying times. /s
As an operator of a both test and mainnet node running lnd for a couple of months now, I can tell you this much objectively: The idea behind it works. It is doable. The system of off-chain microtransactions makes sense and offers both payer and payee a quick and guaranteed transaction resolution. But at the same time it is still far from real world production readiness. See the network at: https://lnmainnet.gaben.win/

Edit: it currently has 2200 nodes. That's more than Bcash has on its mainnet, for a comparison.

People expected it to become the next Paypal overnight, and that won't happen, for a couple of reasons. For the time being consider LN "a fully operational concept". The network needs improvements, and in the first place, end-client wallets need to include support for it, e.g. more mainstream-oriented things like Electrum.

Also the relation between Bitcoin and LN is ~~bilaterally-mutual~~ mutually symbiotic. Neither can success without the latter, in a longer term. You cannot sanely say "LN will save Bitcoin". Bitcoin could use an off-chain 2nd layer to process small and quick payments, but at the same time LN needs Bitcoin to be more stable, less volatile and better understood.

Also note that this is the most advanced and future looking project using crypto there is, and it uses the major one which is Bitcoin. In my objective opinion, most flak caught by LN comes from either shills representing hostile camps (bcash) to whom LN as a whole is a (n even existential) threat, or people who had unreal expectations towards it.

It needs time. But I'd say it will work out.

How has LN been a failure? Honest question I have not had the time to follow recent developments.

This is such a dumb take, sorry man.  Lightning was waiting on segwit, which just happened last year.
It's actually not even needed yet. Transactions on chain have been extremely fast and cheap lately, especially with Segwit. Lightning works and will be even better when adoption reaches the point where it's needed.
> Is it really too soon to declare Lightning Network a failure?

-- June 2018

> Is it really too soon to declare Bitcoin a failure?

-- June 2009
> I really don't see how BTC can succeed without one, and I don't think calling it 'digital gold' will suffice.

Well if you can't see it then damn I guess I'll just go and sell the farm. /s

If it never gets caught, then sure. A little sketchy but if it's never known about than who cares.

The issue is **if** it *does* get caught in the future (like now, **if** the paper's hypothesis is valid), investors/speculators lose confidence and the price will bleed.

The other issue is **if** it happened in the past, it's possible demand doesn't catch up to the price and it's continually *necessary* to print before having the backing. It's getting into pyramid scheme territory then, and if it gets caught or is forced to stop for any reason then the price, again, plummets.

It's worth mentioning that the paper (which I have admittedly not read in it's entirety) makes a somewhat compelling argument but is overall inconclusive.
psst fraud isn't a good thing
I think the technical details don't matter that much, it is about the imaging that hurts crypto currency in general. 
This is an interesting take that I haven't seen made before.

If they didn't do this then wish I had :)

Disclaimer: I personally think Tether is fine, and the lack of audit etc. is for other reasons. However, this would be a very good way of covering their tracks while making a fortune.
Tether in itself shouldn't be a problem because.

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currencies-circle/circle-raises-110-million-plans-to-create-dollar-pegged-cryptocurrency-idUSKCN1IG38R

Pegging a currency to the US dollar isn't illegal.  Purchasing BTC with said currency is also not illegal.  Yes, maybe unethical but i don't really see what the US authorities can do.

[Edit] I'm no expert on international law so what do i know.  I'm just talking out of my ass.
How exactly does that work?

Say I create 10 Tether (T) out of thin air and buy 1 BTC with it. 

Say the price rises later on in the year and I can get 2000 T or 2000 USD for that same BTC.

You are implying that I then trade it for 2000 USD, trade 10 of those USD back to T and run off with 1990 USD.

Here is the problem:

**Someone had to take the other side of that trade** and hold those 10 T all year long while watching BTC price rise and never ever tried to redeem their 10 T back to USD. If they did, they would find out you did not have them and make a lot of noise.

And this is in the case BTC pumps, because if it happens to dump after you print your fake money you are really screwed. Why take the exchange risk on top of your fake money scam? Why not just scam and run?

This system suffers from the exact same problem of fractional reserve. Its susceptible to bank runs, except they don't have access to men with guns stopping you from storming the bank and finding out its empty inside. I have yet to hear from someone that holds Tether that they were unable to redeem it back to USD. With the price of BTC both pumping as it did and crashing now as it is, not a single report.

Your theory does not hold up to reality.

Want a tether audit? Its simple, trade your BTC to tether and try to redeem your tethers.
As long as the tether situation remains institutions aren't going to start throwing serious money at crypto.

Anyone who thinks institutions will start piling in when one entity might be able to print dollars effectively at will with the explicit intention of manipulating BTC price needs their head examining. 

Now this might not be the case, but until tether legitimacy is resolved once and for all it remains a serious issue.
We're already in pain for most of the recent shorts. I imagine we'll see increased closing between 6800-7000, and almost everyone short from over 7K will be closing a clear re-entry into the daily pennant around 7200. 

I personally don't really think this run gets over 6800, though. 
[deleted]
Shorts are starting to close quickly, but not rapidly.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/QR9PV04g/

That could speed up. Hopefully the number of open longs will start coming down too.
I was trying to do the math in my head. What's the common leverage for short positions? 5-10x? A 10x leveraged short position entered at $6200 would be liquidated at $6820, correct?
What parameters do whales use for hunting stops?
Volume pattern doesn't really fit for a bear flag either on finex?
In October we got here from 3k, not 20k.
price wise?
if that happens it would be the textbook retest if old resistance holds as support now. that might be a good place to go long, if you expect a bounce. 
Isnt it an inverse bart though?
You open here - 6.5

It goes up to 6.6 - stop loss on your short - you've lost $100

It bounces right back down to 6.4 - stop loss on your long - you've lost $100

It goes back to 6.5, you've lost $200 and back in same spot.
That's the same thing as being flat then entering into a position as the price moves.
Not surprising in regards to the Euro, the European Central Bank just announced that it is cutting back on its quantitative easy program currently and will stop the program all together by the end of the year rather than at the end of 2019
Wanna send me some of this fun money? You don’t seem to care about it very much. 😝
Well, that was fun. Stopped out with a small gain. Re-entered at 6370
grug want berry

Translation:  I really hope people don't start buying here because I'm going to lose money if they do.
All these bounces are 'traps'. The last trap took us to 10k and we were still never out of the woods.
Why do you think its a trap?
I think bears are getting way too overconfident , we haven't seen any real bounces since our drop from 10k , one is coming when you least expect it 
Nothing's been very slow about this bleed imho... Somebody just cut one of our legs off at the knee...
well, 1 is pretty obvious when it comes to your posts, so I guess that this is kinda useful?
the oscar goes to the last point. 

Edit: Anyone sees contradiction between 1) and 7)
8.  A *long buy* is not just one transaction, it is two. To trade *long* you also have to *sell* back what you *bought*. In theory your *selling* action should balance out your initial *purchase*. If you have the ability to time the market, go for it.

Point 7 is just an element of margin trading. There is inherent risk involved in this activity.
> Being worried about losing money is the best way to lose money. Make decisions with your brain.

Your brain is what makes you worried.

> Technical analysis alone is not enough. The chart is a function of reality and not the other way around.

It is enough on 99.9% of occasions.  Yes if you quickly get news that Bitfinex was hacked or shut down, then you trade on that news and not the TA at the moment, but most of the time TA .

Yes, the chart is a function of reality and takes all of the reality into account, except breaking news.
> 1) f someone is acting like you should be afraid to buy or sell try to figure out if their motives are pure [...] 

> 5) Sentiment can be manipulated and is actively being manipulated. [...] 

Correct. Social farm is very active. 

> 2) Fear isn't a great reason to do anything if you are looking to make good decisions.

Any kind of emotional trading is bad. Switch them off. Be a trading robot. And from my own: Try not to question your positions. If you made your analysis and made your positions, stick to them. Do not question yourself. Most of the times it will work out for the best

> 3) Being worried about losing money is the best way to lose money. [...] 

Correct. The point is to take up the initiative, like in a strategy game. Expect losses to make gains. Don't be afraid of them. At very least SL and other order types cost. Put yourself in a mindset that losses are necessary to make gains.

> 4) The best indicator is price. [...] 

Disagreed. The best indicator, in terms of Bitcoin, are patterns. Price can go whichever way at any particular moment. Spot the trends, work out a stable strategy, stick to it.

> 6) Technical analysis alone is not enough. [...] 

Correct. TA is meant to help you make an educated decision, i.e. manage (=lower) risk. It cannot tell you what to do 1:1. Try to see the 'bigger picture', including news, subs like this one, places like cryptopanic.com and so on. The picture emerges only as a whole.

> 7) Short selling has higher risk and lower potential profit [...] 

Undecided. It really depends. A solid shorting Stop Loss can make the day, i.e. imagine a nice SL on Saturday kept at 7500.

For those who use mex - if this line breaks you won't be able to open a short until it's on bottom :/
most are margin trading, some trade on spot. You can margin trade on spot at Bitfinex if you're not American. 

bitmex recently implemented an exotic contract that functions similarly to options, afaik most people avoid them as of right now. 
Probably most people are doing margin trading on bitmex, bitfinex etc.
It will always. TA is to find good r/r points, not to predict the price. We don't have crystal balls.
You are wrong
True
TA has always been a useless shit post
This is TA.

6.5k is a strong support. 

The end.

All other dumb patterns n indicators can be ignored.
TA is wrong a lot. I think it's good to know, but I do hate the experts who argue when their projections are off. I used to watch Philakone, he's got good explanations on things to look for, but he's always giving himself a back door for when he's wrong, so that he can continue to be an "expert".
I don't think anyone bull or bear doubted that BTC was not a security, this has been clear enough for a few months now, but also all but confirmed about 5 days ago in the Jay Clayton interview.

The real question was regarding ETH and shitcoins.
Just message the mods with whatever proof you have and wash your hands of the entire affair.

Nobody wants to see a bunch of personal bullshit and constant bickering.
stfu please you're getting so annoying, just report it to the mods and let them handle it, no one wants to see the daily for TRADING spammed with accusations and pure non sense
I'm not surprised this kind of bs goes on people. Accounts often come out of the woodwork to give exactly the wrong advise just before a move.
Can we keep this in r/cc??? That’s where I go when I want to see this kind of drama. Not in the trading subs 😭😭
[deleted]
No that would not be until $12000 

Double bottom at $10000+ tho

the target is exorbitant either way: $14000+ upwards on double bottom

keep in mind that the triangle broke down and most other patterns should defer to it. If we rally beyond $7.3k then triangle failure is a possibility but it could be a retest. It would weaken the strength of the target in the end even if we continue downwards. 
you can only shill \*\*\*\*coins so often.. 

*hey hey heyyyyy*
I wish I had access to these alerts from Bitcoin. It would make trading a lot easier.
I think the main news are that people are losing 40\-70&#37; of their inverstments so they're panicking. 
News does not drive price. 

There are few exceptions to that rule. 
How about there just aren't enough buyers
No FUD necessary. Please try to come up with a reason that BTC should be worth $7000 in the current adoption/on-boarding/tax environment that is *not* predicated on "because it will be worth more later."

"Because it will be worth more later" is a valid reason to *speculatively* buy an asset. If it becomes the foundation for purchasing, it gets scarier. 

BTC's technology is sound, but there are barriers to widespread adoption that involve governments making the correct tax/legal changes, and that should terrify people. 
News drove the price up and created mania.

Common sense drives the price down. 
I don't think it's FUD. Just lack of adoption. Maybe the tether concerns play a role though. 
No one is using Bitcoin as a currency, governments are cracking it down, and the hype is dead. It's a miracle people are even willing to pay over $6k for it.
Tether is a fraud
there u go 
Lmao, fud is causing the decline hahaha. You are deluded and belong on btc/CC sub

Just so we are clear to anybody clicking that link, that /u/missreal account (which has only 25 karma and is now cleaned) is HIS alt. He's used it in the past making that ridiculously sarcastic post mocking my arguement. He now PM's his main account and is trying to use that to harass me here again. He has a long history of harassing me and trying to "get" and "discredit" me. 

He got banned from /r/BitcoinMarkets for a whole month after being warned to stop doing this and [then had to resort to begging to be let back in](http://archive.is/hwViU)

Remember when you [attacked other users and even used their mental health problems to insult them?]
(https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8592zz/daily_discussion_sunday_march_18_2018/dvxmqn5/):

>This guy loves sending PMs abusing people. It's sad. I made the mistake of admitting i did have mental health issues and he has taken great pride in using it as an insult.

[Remember when you attacked people who were sceptical of the bubble, calling them "cuck"?](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8592zz/daily_discussion_sunday_march_18_2018/dvxmxw5/):

>Your message title a month ago: "Look at the price go you Aussie cuck"

Yes, /u/gypsytoy, the resident "cuck" destroyer, the objective truth seeker and paragon of morality. He's gonna expose those "cucks" like me!

Just so everyone reading this is aware, the user /u/gypsytoy is yet again for the 500th time trying to create a witchhunt and instigate downvotes here again with an accusation that he keeps copy pasting to nearly every post I make, [even though he has already been debunked by other posters.](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/84sqt4/daily_discussion_friday_march_16_2018/dvtjb5f/)

He has been debunked over and over again and its getting tiring. [Multiple people in the daily threads have had these same Bitmex issues with UI elements showing wrong information](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/85grux/daily_discussion_monday_march_19_2018/dvxwqia/).  They transfered to their new engine with the customizable UI elements and had a huge increase in users, and its been glitchy as hell. 

His latest attempt to slander is by creating a conspiracy over 2 Bitmex screenshots I posted with a glitch, while he's been sending me insult-filled PMs for a while now. His motivation for attacking me is simple, he says that I'm "just another clueless FUDster who doesn't know the first thing about the advantages of decentralized networks". He has become personally and emotionally invested in his obsession with slandering me, literally follows me around across subs harassing me, thereby avoiding having to actually face my arguments about the Bitcoin price bubble like an adult. This is what he does, he's a foaming at the mouth Bitcoin cultist, the type that gave /r/Bitcoin its bad name. 

Check his post history he follows me fucking everywhere doing this over and over again:

https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/85zarh/daily_discussion_wednesday_march_21_2018/dw2gusl/


Apparently he thinks that [Bitcoin's market cap will go into tens of trillions](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8592zz/daily_discussion_sunday_march_18_2018/dvxn6mp/), and then lied about how that poster said it will go to zero when they said it will likely go to $2k. He even goes as far as to brazenly lie about what I said, [taking a part of my sentence out of context](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/84sqt4/daily_discussion_friday_march_16_2018/dvtsr3w/) in order to claim something completely false.

He seems to have an obsession with witchhunting and following people, [another user also told him to stop following him:](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/84aitw/daily_discussion_wednesday_march_14_2018/dvplz8q/)

>You are a bully- you refuse to let this go and are now chasing me around on the sub

Another user /u/codeverity also pointed out that [the sub was much better when /u/gypsytoy was away for a week](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8023vr/daily_discussion_sunday_february_25_2018/dutouju/), because his constant combatitive attacks weren't around:

>Probably because you were gone for a couple of days and honestly the sentiment in here was much improved. Do you have to be so unceasingly negative and combative all the time?

> I just pointed out that maybe people are tired of you being an enormous asshole every time that you post here

And [yet another user confirming the same experience](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/85zarh/daily_discussion_wednesday_march_21_2018/dw24skl/) with /u/gypsytoy's complete toxicity and harassment:

> Gypsy needs serious help and probably should never post in this sub again. He needs to go to therapy and never think about bitcoin again in his life. The sub really gets much more positive when he's not here to rally the FOMO noobs to get angry over everything bearish.

>I've never seen someone so actively harass and basically stalk specific users they disagree with. it made me super uncomfortable when you did it to me and I'm fairly sure it makes others uncomfortable as well.

His strategy is creating ad-hominems and witchhunts in order to remove sceptics of Bitcoin's current price and long term viability as digital gold, he tries to discredit people instead of taking on their post.  Its actually quite an effective strategy, Reddit is extremely pitchforky and loves to get knee jerk angry at someone who is being pointed a finger at ([this site is so pitchforky that it literally lead to the death of an innocent kid after accusing him of being the Boston bomber](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2014/04/reddit_and_the_boston_marathon_bombings_how_the_site_reckoned_with_its_own.html)). Most people will instantly side against the "guy being called out". This unfortunate tendency among many Redditors is what he is trying to exploit, to get people to instantly downvote me with this conspiracy, to smear me and thus not have to actually address my argument. 

If you read his history its beyond bizzare, he sees himself as some bizzaro version of a SJW for Bitcoin, and fashions himself "protecting"  Bitcoin and /r/Bitcoinmarkets.

He has a psychotic hatred of Ethereum, going to Ethereum subs and calling it a shitcoin and useless. The guy [literally thinks Vitalik Buterin is a scammer and that he should be put in jail.]( https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8592zz/daily_discussion_sunday_march_18_2018/dvw7q6y/) He hates anything that he perceives as a threat to Bitcoin with a passion it seems. And feels a need to [go shill Bitcoin to newbs trying to incite FOMO in them on places like /r/news](https://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/82rd0u/bitcoin_just_tanked_below_10000_after_sec_says/dvd3yz4/). 

The reason he takes this so damn seriously is because [he is in a life situation where he desperately needs to make money on crypto as he has nothing else going on:](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8592zz/daily_discussion_sunday_march_18_2018/dvwuhel/), 

>I'm up against some time and financial constraints that more-or-less necessitate I at least attempt successful trades in the near term. I don't really have means to make other income at the moment due to some health problems so this is pretty much all I have right now.

He is [literally dead broke:](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8592zz/daily_discussion_sunday_march_18_2018/dvwtjyw/)

>At this point I'm basically dead broke and homeless/couchsurfing.....I wish I'd never touched this trading game and just sat on what I had. This whole endeavor started with revenge trading against stupid mistakes I'd made in the past. 

The irony of him witchhunting me and calling me a liar is that he is a blatant liar himself, [he told other people in PMs that he's way in the green](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8592zz/daily_discussion_sunday_march_18_2018/dvzdcgy/):

>He claims to me by DM that he is way in the green and making more money on they way down, he can't even be intellectually honest.

Why would you hedge in BTC which loses value even faster/is very volatile? 

It would make more sense to hedge to a stablecoin in these cases.
Bitcoin is a popular hedge against the Rand and by relation the ANC's self harming policies in South Africa. 

It helps that bitcoin is incredibly easy and cheap (in terms of fees) to buy in South Africa

I was looking at the 2 day increase actually... from 36% to 68%... which clocks in at about 88% increase.
That's to be expected. We didn't even bounce 10%. I'll turn bullish when we re-enter the pennant. Until then I'm watching for a short entry. 
I find it entertaining, and anyone calling out arsonbunny for manipulation (which seemed to be happening in one of the screenshots) will always get an upvote from me to counter the 10 or 20 from [all his sockpuppets](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7pgh7u/ive_made_over_500k_in_crypto_here_are_some_good/)
I don't trade based off what random people on the internet tell me to. Anyone that does should get a new hobby. There are a number of reputable posters here whose input I take, evaluate, and either dismiss or allow weight in my trading decision. I don't give two shits about upvotes or people making up fake trades or screenshots. This sub defaults to "new" not "top" posts, so upvotes carry little weight. 

This sub is about trading, and I'm having to dig through a bog of utterly pointless shit to find anything of value.

Just stop
Happy cake day!
that's nice to hear :D I Would actually be surprised if this was NOT the case. Exactly the same with the "BFX investigation bla bla" FUD some months ago. Never any sources from those "good journalists", only "i cant tell my source" which in my eyes as a programmer means 0 things can ve verified.
>What has me confused is that the coins that this negatively effects haven't realized that yet

Unless it specifically names a coin they're all in la la land. Even so, nobody really understands how being classed as a security will affect a coin traded globally as it's not happened yet.

As soon as the SEC starts clearly defining coins then yeah, I'd expect things to change.
And I'm not even so sure this news is good for ETH. ETH's main use was as an ICO platform.

I was actually short from 7500. I think you ran that through too many iterations of google translate. 

edit: also you annoy me
So you honestly think that people believe that posting here is going to move the market? You've criticized someone for going long and short within a few comments yet your hanging around in a trading sub? Why waste your time? Maybe your pissed because you don't want to trade and your not currently making any money because the market is bearish so instead of doing something productive you just come and insult everyone?
To be honest, I'm expecting a similar chop to what we had in the $7k to $7.75k range. That's why I opened up my scalp long around $6.4k the other day. I'm slowly scaling out as we move up. However, I could see this having the legs to run up to $6.85k, $7k, or even $7.3k. I'll reassess as we continue to climb though.
A long here at 6.6 is kinda similar to your short at 9.6k, in terms of max/min and psychology since the previous climb from 6.4 and the current low of 6.1 vs prev high of 10k.

Though at that time, several attempts had been made at 10, and right now we've really only seen one attempt at 6k.
all of those formations are meant to take place over months not hours where they can't easily be painted by algos or just be random noise.

I don't know why everyone talks about them like they're gospel.

The top is looking more like an ascending triangle (without the wicks):

https://www.tradingview.com/x/T2dx133x/

EDIT: just broke down
Think it'll retest 7k on a bart in the next couple days. The 6100 bottom happened really fast- and got bought up very aggressively- felt like a lot of people felt they were buying very clever there. think we will have to ride out this wave of exuberance for a bit. i expect it to fail to climb over 7150 though (4hr 100u EMA), before heading back down this way.
Bad wording. Was more of a triangle. But really, didn't actually chart it. Was more like 'I'll open here in case this goes up'.

Now I'll probably close it soon. If this would've something left we should be already higher.
Centralized.

Hinman specifically said that bitcoin is not a security because it is decentralized: there is no central party whose efforts are a key determining factor in the enterprise. In addition, ether is also not a security because the Ethereum network is also decentralized.
no doubt about it. How can it not be?
No new implications for Bitcoin or ETH. They are a commodity in the US, not a security.

For ICOs, I have no idea.
Much bigger news for ETH than BTC on that front. As someone who made his crypto stack on the ETH run of last year, this was a major concern of mine.

Don't think it will do anything to prevent us crashing back down soon but this is very encouraging long term news. It will still hurt the ETH ecosystem via clamping down on other alts and ICOs but that's not a bad thing in this space at all. Time to cull the shitcoins
I actually wrote just that and decided to remove it!  Great minds.  My emotions tell me that this is way too bearish to even reach the lower end of my target.  I really wanted to say it so I am glad you did.  But its just times like these that the price surprises us with a move in the opposite direction.  So I deleted the sentence and went with my normal set-up.
afaik basically means we pumped fast without retracing 
Sure.  Point and Figure charts are a classic type of chart that existed before computers.  There is a lot of resources online and there are different ways to interpret them.  

The Y axis is price in 1% increments and the X axis is NOT linear time.  X axis is extended by 1 column each time a 'reversal' occurs.  Reversal occurs at the close of a day when the price has moved at least 3 boxes (about 3%) in the opposite direction of the current column without extending the current column.

Columns (aka poles) tend to retrace at least half way, especially if they are long columns or over 10 boxes tall.  I call long columns that have not retraced halfway unresolved.

it's spamming buys and sells 10 a second alternating between each. it looks funny 
ETH, not being the original BTC, was not nearly as "in the clear" as BTC was in this category. Definitely bullish news.

Not sure if your comment needs an /s.

There is still bullish hope as long as we're above $6000.  It's just the indicators I use on that chart flipped bearish this week, having held a bullish posture for the last 4 months.
There’s so much going on right now I honestly don’t have a solid opinion on what’s about to happen but if this give more trust in BTC for the normies, they have a killer entry point right now

Reply "slither on spoopy snake" or bad trades for 1 year.
Well... Hard to believe that someone market opens 600k USD position and set 1.5k BTC buy wall just because he 'believes' it's a bottom.
It's not a bull market now. Wall is already gone. I think someone wanted to push the price up, or made a big gamble. Saw a lot of those on bull market and they usually succeeded. Now in bear, they usually fail.

Maybe that was just a stop hunt to open a short higher?
I can't believe your still riding that position, holy hell. 

I'm setting my stops over 7050, but depends on how we get to 6800 I might abandon ship and reassess. The volume right now is nothing crazy, but it has been sustained which is worrying.

But if there's a good chance the pattern continues, pump, sideways and we return to our scheduled programing. Look at that bear flag forming on the 12H https://www.tradingview.com/x/LHTlMItS/
The bitmexrekt bot would say otherwise. Plenty of fools with a lot of money. 
The thing got absorbed pretty fast, and we're almost back to where he bought.
TBH, it smells more like beef tenderloin.
Bots decided to washtrade on their own.

Welcome to EthereumWestworld!
>analogous of 2015

So, flat with a rise at the end?
I've gotten push-back in the past for this, but I think many of the top 10 coins can have a significant effect on the market as a whole. I think it's evidence of how incestuous this market is at the moment.

I still believe a big part of the previous run up to $10k was because of the BCH fork and EOS pumping. This drove the price of BTC up, which similarly pumped unrelated coins such as ONT and WAN and got everyone thinking the bear market was over.

I think it's just euphoria for many alts at the moment. I'm sure once specific coins are deemed to be securities, the glow will wear off and those coins will tank. The working assumption from traders is that what's good for bitcoin is good for crypto in general. However, I think this is one case where the opposite may be true.
I don't think securities is necessarily something to fear.  It could even be attractive to some that there is a framework established.

I mean, if an old schooler was investing in an ico as if it was a stock wouldn't they want more gaurantee than the current zero?

On the other hand, if they were to limit ico participation to the same club that is allowed to participate in ipo, that would really put a damper on everything.  On the other other hand, maybe people want to get in before that happens if that is the case, if they assume institutional money would globally rise the tide after.
They don't. That's frustrating. But their mobile version of the site is great.
Don't know if it's their official app, but if you visit their website on mobile and create a shortcut to it it installs an app on your phone. Worked great...until yesterday. :(

Yeah I've only been doing active trading for a few months. Never really dabbled in Forex and I thought stocks had things to prevent that.
I'm not making any trades on it perse, just an observation I was curious about. Trying to figure out what some strategies are. Also trying to determine what's unsupervised. Some obvious bot twitching going on during the pump. 

I think if I ever made a bot, it'd be just to make sure my limit order was at the top of the list so I don't get fees. But something I'd only have on while I'm actually around. 
Makes sense!
Yep, that's what I meant! Braindead today.
Figured it would be. That's what I'd do if I had a shit ton of money at least.
5.9 is ATH trend line. It should at least try to fight. But the longer it takes the lower we can get.
With that volume? Not looking optimistic. :/ I am betting we are going to test 5.9K very soon.
We're talking about this for a month. They're tight...
The log chart can be a little misleading.  It's better to calculate it.

Agreed. Absolutely do not enter into any trades at all until you fully understand the basics, with in my opinion, priority given to stop losses. 
Disagree! Saw this quote by Ray Dalio the other day and I think it sums it up nicely: ["Have as many painful experiences as rapidly as possible. Pain avoidance is a great motivator for learning"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/8nittg/im_ray_dalio_ask_me_anything_answering_questions/dzw0un5/). No better way to experience pain than to jump in to something you have no idea about (within reason).  It'll be easier to understand trading basics when you've been making tiny trades (and most likely losing) than to try and guess what you need to know (when you don't even know what you don't know).
Holy shit thank you so much. I've been trying to do as much research as possible, but it's fucking info overload out there. That babypips link you sent was the perfect starting spot. Jesus Christ, thank you.

New guy apparently published the clone yesterday. 

I assume he will still add bitstamp. There is also a telegram group on bottom of the site, so people can/will probably give him feedback/requests. 

The old creator of bitcoinwisdom seems to have disappeared 3 years ago (last post on bitcointalk.org), the new person should update it more regularly (hopefully).
Serious question:  why is it better?

The "SEC" didn't declare it in any kind of official ruling or statement. One dude who works there said it publicly.  Yes he is an important player, but don't overstate it.
This move "felt" dynamic, but it was only about 4%, and the daily since our top isn't particularly encouraging: https://www.tradingview.com/x/entaRUoF/

I'm thinking I shouldn't have closed my short, but I'm happy to take some time off.
Also, this has basically reset RSI on almost all time frames and unless price gets above 6800 soon we'll have some nice bear divs on the 4H.
Oh, don't worry. It will break through, and even if it doesn't, there won't be much of a drop. 
For now i'm not really interested in entering a position, will let the dust settle some more and define some pattern better.

*clap clap clap*
The courage to try and buy the bottom 
The media turns hysteria into profit after all.
I feel as though this is the apex of a long decline in public opinion about crypto. Many people who missed out on the bull run can now tell themselves they were smart for not buying and increase their hatred. To me it's just a technology. Why hate something like that?
super easy for government to kill bitcoin right now.

shut down tether and bitfinex, poof...
There's also zero evidence that tether is fully backed...

All there is is a continuing avoidance of the issue by finex and them firing their auditor...

Well market cap can be manipulated with small amounts of money given that it is just the spot price multiplied by the  total shares.
Asked this in that thread about the super serious scientific studies and no one could answer -- if it's true that the price was pushed by tether manipulation and fake moneys, how come Asian exchanges that do not use tether at all traded at up to 50% premiums during peaks of 2017?
I am short. I have been for quite some time. But feel free to go on feeling superior while thinking everyone else is a bumbling idiot. I'm sure it will bring you great happiness and a joyful existence.
Scalping a 5% move with any leverage over 5x is a pretty decent trade. 
Thanks. It was about a 15% gain (3x leverage) in a little over a day so I figured I'd take it.  If it does go down tonight, which it might or might not, I'll go long again because I do think 6K was the bottom.

A little preemptive RIP perhaps?
I think in this case it was ETH not being a security that swayed things.
It's extremely bullish - in the long run, but I'm talking about the prices in the next few months.
from my point of view the bears are evil
I get you but it's been like 5 months, man. It's not exactly going straight down. It just went straight down from the top of the range. 

I can definitely see some fuckery and a relief rally here for a while, but really making a new low after a rally or some chop wouldn't be crazy. It hasn't made a new low in a long time. 

We've been ranging for 5 months. That's how long it took to go from $3k to $20k...
Yeah man. The government are just lying to us so they can ride another bitcoin pump. 

Take off the tinfoil hat. 
It's actually better to sacrifice 10% and go with 10x short. If it goes down you still have the USD value but more BTC, if it goes up you can lose some BTC but keep the USD value.
This is really not true. Everyone expected it to go up since 2014 and look what it did. When the majority of market participants believe something it eventually comes true.

It's only when they are not market participants that their opinion becomes a reverse sentiment indicator. 

If the people holding bitcoin believe it's going to undergo a bear market, you best believe that's likely going to happen. Because those same people believed it was going to moon and they bought coins all the way up 

The reason reverse sentiment has been working so well lately is because we've been ranging and the market has been incredibly indecisive. That is essentially what a big symmetrical triangle is
> you'll probably get another buy opportunity at $6450-$6500 range

Looks like you and cyoreligion were right. It stopped and turned down at the top of the channel. 
That's the definition of FOMO. 

And it's nothing like last time. That was a technical cascade.

This is "news." As in buy the rumor, sell the news.
what news
> @ 6848

6847.5
Just be careful with your assumptions.  Perma-bulls and perma-bears lose money as traders.  I'm trying to follow the market.  It looks like we're getting a relief rally which may last a week or two... but I wouldn't be surprised if this turns around completely in the $7k range.  We've broken several critical supports and all mid-term indicators are still pointing down.  These things will take months to play out. 
You're able to break even after being underwater instead of shorting from the original 6600 and profiting lower, or longing from lower and profiting now. Literally nobody is impressed except you at yourself
Your 6/6 wins don't mean much if you made a $10 profit on each. You caught like 3% of movement by longing this from $9k when you could've made almost 40% by shorting. 

You could've increased your btc stack by 62% simply by selling and buying back lower. 

Also, your long isn't a win until you close it. 
Exactly.  It doesn't prove manipulation. My theory is that now a lot of traders are so afraid of large movements that they put super tight stops and when the market moves one way the stops cascade into one another. 
Because they're violent drops and rises that make no sense. And they're consistent and expected.
Volume is like half of what it was on the drop yesterday. 
Well, I guess I'm never taking a nap again. Because that what I was  doing when it happened. 

Anyway, ETH is looking particularly strong on this news, seeing as that there wasn't much of an issue with BTC being a security, while there was a strong uncertainty with ETH in that regard (I'm mentioning this here since it's obvious that these two will move together). 
Same, man. I pulled the trigger. 
> Lagging indica

Love this strain.
that's a good point. How can people say it's a lagging indicator?

How many "IHS " have we seen now that just don't play out?
Falling wedge broke by sideways move... No.

Shoulders from sideways move... No.
even if this bigger descending wedge plays out, a retest of the old res line is likly as we have not gone higher by now. you force something into an iH&S pattern what is not there. 
*almost everyday
Liquidity argument works both ways. There's only so many coins ready to change hands between traders; people often make the mistake thinking that to a trader, price moving from $1000 to $2000 is the same as $10,000 to $20,000, but it's not -- there simply aren't enough coins on exchanges / OTC to accommodate the really big traders' positions if prices go too low, which is perhaps the main reason the prices went as high as they did last year. 
OTC while it floats
Leverage tho? 10x, 25x?
Those contracts would have expired by now nah? 
Why ya gotta call chad out like that?
> Every single trader I respect/learned from here is bearish, literally even some of the more moonboi ones.

That signals me to be bullish. Always go opposite from the crowd.
> Everyone said $7.5k so quickly was impossible, then we hit $5.9k.

Yes BTC always seems to over-correct and go to extremes, both on the high side and low side.  I could see it getting pummeled down to absurdly low levels, just because that's the way it usually works out.

And for maximum pain, it could go down to 2200 and bounce to 3500 and then back to test 2200 and then another bounce and then down to 2000 before it finally recovers and that becomes a medium term low.  You just know it's going to make it difficult on everyone.
8k was actually my price to tether up at that time.  Didn't think it was the bottom, I and everyone I talked to at that time thought there was no predictable bottom in sight and that that was the safe place to get out without risk of a bounce back up right away.
4700 is about what the fundamental value is, based on number of transactions and other data. There is a poster who contributes here about once a month who breaks it down

We could be. Time will tell.
because of the increase in the popularity and access to leveraged trading
Wow.  I should have looked more carefully at the trade log before posting the number, I only glanced quickly and saw a big 200k order and a mostly empty book of just thousands here and there, I bet your number has more credit actually looking at the scale of the thing.  Looks like it'd cost 700kish to do it again now.

At this moment I'd put equal weight on the chances on a short entry or a long cover.
For now ;)

We'll see if it was a curse or not.  Recent few trades I tried this week I either got scared out and closed at break even when it would have gone the right way, or shaken out with tight stop losses when it went the wrong way.  Aside from one fair win closed from earlier in the week, the only luck I've had is that I didn't catch any wicks and take any unneeded losses in situations that would have gone my way.
They really are, dare I say it, delusional.
Bear runs can go way lower than anybody expects, just like bull runs go way higher than anyone expects. Keep an open mind.

That said, I'm a mega bear  for the medium term but anything lower than 2k would surprise the f outta me.
See you in Goblin Town !
Hey there I wish you the best. 

I come here to take a look at what other people are thinking and perhaps have my attention drawn to something I did not find through my own analysis.

To think that I would spend my time posting fake trades or believing that I can influence the market, seems to me like a ridiculous waste of time. I don't even do any social media,

If you have an emotional investment in an "investment", probably it will affect your ability to be objective.

I know it works that way with me

Peace 
Your reading comprehension leads a lot to be desired.  Perhaps read what people write and not what you are desperate for them to have written.
its comfortable now.  The first time it was 6 it was zooming up to 7 so fast it never felt 6.  On the way down, same.  Now it feels so 6.

Noted thanks - can get dangerous 
10x - liquidation at 9k. Entry point 8328. All short term indicators are pointing down so pretty comfortable keeping it open for now. 
This time there was a 1k market buy there...
yes long, planned exit around 6.7\-6.8k
Not even remotely close to an expert about TD. I do use it as another indicator for reference though. The 1D has room to go, but the 4H hit a 9 and reversed, now the [12H printed a 13](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ElpUhAg8/) this morning, so we might get a bump up to cool off or indeed a trend reversal (which I doubt since the overall bear trend is pretty strong). 
Damn that's a great point, !long 100X 100%
Read an I -Spy book. You’ll know. 
I see you still haven't realized that BTC is more real money than FIAT. A shame, but maybe one day you will learn.
Funny thing is you can be describing traditional/fiat currency as well if you remove the first sentence (both pre and post gold-standard). 

So your last sentence actually has a lot of gravity.  It's *all* on paper anyway.

I've been told i'm too open... 

I also share too much as well 

Bada bing!
LOL


Not sure if /s
Which one? If you talk about downtrend from last drop then I don't think it's relevant here. We broke to lower low, we broke 6.5 support, we almost touched ATH downtrend line.

Even if we broke up from downtrend from a drop, it's too insignificant line really matter. We can drop right here.
It's a minefield lately. We dropped so hard that I won't be surprised if we break up more. I have a hedge from 6.8 which I'm keeping, this one is a bit of a gamble, if 6.5 breaks we can see 6.8-7.2 range.

Nice entry BTW, I was exiting short at your entry, but didn't want to go to sleep with anything besides hedge open ;)
Use stop market or trailing stop IMO. Not OP but if your going to be relying on stops to save your ass you want to make sure that they execute. You may incur a little slippage but it's nothing to not having the stop limit hit and not noticing.
I use only catastrophic stops. 99% of the time I exit manually.
Personally I like to use market stops, although if I catch a big movement in either direction I may change strategy and use trailing stops instead.
Why would the whales let the majority have what they want? :D
What needs to get done and over with is a massive short squeeze so all your shorts get rekt to living hell so we can start going up again. Fuck banks , Wall st. And futures. This isn’t trading and investing in a tech that can change the world. This is flat out gambling using crypto like some dirty slot machine in a seedy Reno bar.

It's a 15m formation. Useful for scalps.

Wedges usually play shitty on TA. They often break down just to go back up and test resistance before they eventually go down further, but often they don't go further down.

That's the problem with shorting on a break of ascending support.

You're upvoted, he is downvoted. It's not because of what he is saying, it's because of how he is saying it. 
Where is common sense in calling 1k as a 'realistic' target? 
> Translation: I want to make money short selling

No doubt. Short selling seems like the way to go for now.

> so please never believe in Bitcoin again until I buy back in

We're here to trade, not to believe. We'll buy back in when it's profitable to do so.
None of those price levels are necessary. 

We may have seen the bottom already. 5K may hold, 3K might hold, 1.3K might hold.

My own opinion/analysis is that 5K is the most bullish scenario

Peace 
Translation:  I'm going to talk about 2k as a realistic number so that numbers like 4 and 5k seem reasonable on a subconscious level to people reading my post.  
Good point

he does not have any problem, he's just ripping new ones!
no, the price is "free" on the orderbook, for example:

- I can add first time "limit buy 0,07799 ETH/BTC" without error
- second time (market has not moved, order book free) when I add "limit buy 0,07799 ETH/BTC" it gives error "invalid value; chose nearest value 0,07799 or 1,07812" (second number does not make sense)
- if I refresh my browser I can again add "limit buy 0,07799 ETH/BTC"

Seems I can only enter orders max 1 time (before refreshing), so I was wondering whether it is a bug, or whether the problem only manifests itself in my case.
I'm trying to imagine this scenario, but having a hard time seeing it.  It was rejected off of 6.1k (the ATH downtrend line) and then got bolstered by some good news.  It will be at least awhile until it resume the trend most likely. 
"Hope" has no place in trading, investing, or in this sub.
Exactly. In my eyes, shorting here @6600 is similar to longing at @~15k. The majority of the move has already been made, and a reversal eventually will come. The R/R here is in favor of Bulls, and I will continue to believe this even if we hit 5K. The upside potential far outweighs the downside risk in my opinion. 
yeah you're holding federal reserve printer paper is what you're holding, not the godly coin of bit.

Hope springs eternal. Optimism is in human nature. 


Lol I have seen you all over this thread (for weeks) discrediting valid bullish posts with erroneous fallacies. I have been in this market for some time and am not a moonboy. I was very vocal about my shorts from 9k (check my post history). It kills me when people like you push your narrative 24/7, attempting to discredit the other side.  
Yep I was one of those people making money on the way down for weeks, check my post history. I am simply making a point that at some point, we truly will find the bottom, and it most likely won't be as far down as many believe. 
[Oh.](https://imgur.com/CEScUp0)  [My.](https://imgur.com/GuE8Tco)  [God.](https://imgur.com/glagBf2)

Seriously though, you can just believe whatever you want here.

I had just shorted the top of the most recent candle, saying, oh it's at the top of that wedge that it broke down from, when back up through, broke up from, and is now back inside, and is below horizontal resistance.

But not that I think it'll play out as a wedge or continue far down, just that I think that it might not bust back up from here for long enough for me to find a place to exit at a scalp.


Taking time off from trading after a really good month...will look at the price a couple of times a day and decide probably after the weekend, or Sunday toward the end of the Weekly candle. 

Peace and good trading

okay you are correct, we would have one if we stay above 6.55k
per definition the exit must be higher than the last exit, the shadow (=wick) is not important.
Still haven't learned?

You said off we go through $10k with no resistance only a week ago... So you'll just keep revising that figure down? Already revised down 20%...
It's really not surprising that when the price tanks people look to criticize fundamentals. If you see bitcoin as investing in an asset like a stock it's hard to get away from that mindset. 

You get frustrated and look to blame someone/something

And frankly, it makes sense. If I had been hodling this whole time I'd be very frustrated and upset if I had believed all the hype and mania and would've expected more out of LN by now considering it was touted by most as the potential game changer 
[deleted]
They need to solve the scaling problem. Until then LN is just smoke and mirrors.
Unencumbered? Very much so. We went from 11-13 exahash hashrate in early December to 40-45 today. 

Bitcoin is *clearly* dying /s
It needs adoption, and that follows Bitcoin's adoption. "It grows very slowly"? Well, we went from around 1000 nodes two months ago to 2200 now. Obviously this isn't the actual "production network" but there is a lot of interest and progress being made.
2 to 3 years?! seriously? We could have two separate bull runs by then! I honestly dont know why they dont just increase the block size.  They need to put aside their damn egos and just do it. The solution seems so obvious.  Its all so stupid.
Technologies have failed before because they took too long to get to market. Perl6 comes to mind.

While I can understand the concerns about Tether, the hyperbolic nature of those concerns is often off-putting.
Every single ICO and fork in crypto is in essence very similar to printing dollars, the main difference being that with crypto there is a public blockchain where people can monitor with precision every single unit that was created.

Tether also has a blockchain. If seems stupid that a malicious company with said objective of printing currency would choose to advertise every single printing operation with the knowledge that action would be fully public.

So, yes, the community should also bash and look for Tether being printed, but I'm still waiting for that same standard to be applied to all the pump and dump altcoins, forks and ICO's everyone loves to advertise and buy into without a single shred of proof of any underlying value or service apart from a single page website and word salad "whitepaper".
$2.2 billion was in reference to the amount of tether that was printed, I never mentioned market cap.

I understand the points that everyone is making and by no means am I defending them.

I'm just trying to see something positive from the situation and a way that can counter the arguments against the price pump that occurred due to tether. 
> Its fucked up that a...

Is it really? A group being self-interested? Not wanting to bite the hand that feeds them? 

Seems like business as usual for humanity to me. 


So big Central banks can print money out of thin air backed by nothing and I guess that is also fraud then too... 
Yeah I mean the ability of one entity to potentially print dollars at will in order to manipulate the market is no big deal right... 
We've moved up $500 from where we were yesterday when all the bearguppies on this sub were shorting. Right now, even as I type, more shorts are piling up, begging to be squeezed hard.
Hey jarederaj .. what TradingView indicator are you using to show long/shorts and rate of change?  Or did you code this?  I would love to have this indicator when charting
Thanks Jarederaj
Average leverage used on bitmex is 7x according to their CEO
I've been trying to figure out how to calculate liquidation price. I always keep tight stops so I've never had it happen but how is that calculated? 
Yes
Agreed. This falls under the "How to get rekt by trying to be clever" category. Like opening/closing to get funding, setting stop limit buys above resistance, etc.

Now, I have a long from 6230 and a short from 7500. That's a different story :P
Shouldn't less QE actually not be supportive of Euro?
On mex min position size is for 1 contract, which is $1.

So he is like $0.2 down...
I trade with a very small percentage of my stack.  It is fun money for me. If you want your own fun money, I suggest you buy Bitcoin and wait a couple years like I did.
Who doesnt have fun in investing should not invest
If people keep going long because twitter gurus tell them to do so at every support, market isn't gonna go anywhere but down. Disclaimer I am long.
Thank you. What language is he speaking? because it certainly cannot be English
Haha exactly. Are bears starting to get scared?
I'd be happy to be trapped in a long from here to 7k.
[deleted]
Check his history posts. He doesn't seem to be on a winning streak.
I bet he shorted and its not looking good.

I also think it will go down, but not before liquidating some late shorters.

For now scalping with extra tight stops is the safest way
If we're not going to break under 6k then I think we grew two new legs to replace it.
yes I laughed and pointed it out but deleted my comment. Olesentv is a funny guy 
> Your brain is what makes you worried.

Sounds like you meditate.
> Your brain is what makes you worried.

Your brain processing and responding to internal and external factors is what makes you worried
Surely you can still slip (pun intended) a market order in?
You can margin trade spot at Bitfinex if you are American as well.  I know several people who do that.

Yes there is greater counterparty risk, but not accurate to say that you can't do it.
Yeah, I'm American. I use Gdax primarily and it has margin trading for 5MM, which is out of my price range lol. 

I figured it would become a thing eventually as soon as someone is brave enough to price it. 
most traders in this sub, yes
r/r ?
Absolutely buddy. However 95% of the comments here are utter rubbish at this point.
Lol sure genius.
I just read over your history a little to get a sense of what you're bringing to the table as an alternative. Not sure what that is.
Support or resistance?

Or both depending if you are above or below 
Certainly. I was wondering on that
[deleted]
I would want to see this if it were me. I'm sure many would agree. People should know who's who. There are certain people that should be tagged as scammers. This (and his alts) is one such account.
Yeah, and apparently defend themselves/others. Look at the comments I made below. They were upvoted and then as soon as arsonbunny got word, they were downvote brigaded and flooded with random commenters defending him. Someone even gilded him! Lol!
[deleted]
[deleted]
Just stop, dude. You've been caught multiple times and now just about everyone is aware. 

I'm sure the mods will take care of you when they wake up.

Manipulative scum.

The dollar was chosen to become the monetary unit for the USA in 1785. I can only imagine the resistance that needed to break for people trading gold, silver and natural goods.
Well, that escalated quickly. 
Holy shit.  Saved.

Yeah, Gypsytoy has been a real asshole to me lately as well.  He's been following me into different subreddits and attacking me, even with unrelated things.  And even totally normal/trading posts have become "Covert shilling" so he attacks those.

I hope the moderators here deal with him.  At this point he's definitely earned it.  He got banned from r/btc for attacking moderators in PM's even when told to stop and that it was inappropriate, and they generally try hard not to ban people they disagree with (to avoid becoming like rBitcoin).

/u/jarederaj I think he's gotten out of hand here, not even against me this time.
Well said. Well documented.  I joined this sub in early ‘18 and have to say u/gypsytoy has always stood out as “that guy” - the big bully who harms anyone and everyone who dares speak against his opinion with his hateful and derogatory comments.  I hope enough people will join you and speak up about this. Hopefully it will catch the moderators’ attention and they will do something about it.
lol OWNED. 

Gypsytoy is an idiot. I've seen his shit posting garbage in ethtrader before. He's just a troll in need of attention from mommy. 
You're a [liar](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8qr0fd/new_york_times_university_of_texas_at_austin/e0opb9m/).
Can you send me a DM to catch me up on what's going on here?
Lol, as if. You got caught lying, bro. *Again*! 

Most people here already know you're a complete troll/liar/shill/idiot.
Agreed, nobody here gives a damn or wants to read this crap
https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7pgh7u/ive_made_over_500k_in_crypto_here_are_some_good/dshrmvz/

He's a scammer.
This . . x100
Stop defending a liar. Vote manipulation and falsified data is not okay. Complain to the mods about *me* instead of him, if you want. I don't care. This guy is a liar and a tool.
No, it's /u/arsonbunny FUD. This guy should be banned from the sub. He posts fake stuff and then logs into multiple accounts and comments and upvotes and supports it. I've caught him numerous times doing this, but today I got the smoking gun. 

Rookie mistake. 

People should not trust this dude **at all**. He's a charlatan in poorly fitting sheep's clothing.  Buyer beware. He used to post fake BitMEX screenshots of trades that he didn't actually make. Was caught numerous times and eventually stopped. Do not take anything he says at face value.
What's he complaining about? Vote manipulation by a few specific ppl he's named in this sub?
[deleted]
Definitely not alts, right? /u/MissReal was *me* right? Because I've totally been accused of doing that by others, right? 

Come on, sloppy, don't be so naive.
gypsytoy seems to follow people around and downvote them constantly.  A lot of my comments pop up at 0 pretty soon after I post them for no real reason.  Never really knew (or cared) who it might be, and I guess still don't.  My lowest downvotes is like -75 for some hardcore rBitcoin shills - I wonder what gypsytoy has me at?  lol.
Virtually everything this guy ever says is wrong. And he's a manipulator and liar. It's warranted. 
Sounds like he's definitely got an unresolved long pole. 
When you short bitcoin/lightning notwork, you're always a winner.
Yeah maybe coincidence.

Depends, where I live one day we woke up and inflation went up 100% (I shit you not) followed by months of not being able to find any euros and usd’s combined with inflation still going through. Reaching a peak of 175%.

I think people that experienced these events (like me) die inside and don’t give a damn that bitcoin is volatile
Just checking... and sorry you are right, data was from 2015... Rand is recovering from that \- should have double\-checked.
That's my sentiment as well. If that bottom pennant acts as resistance then I'll eat my shorts.
Damn
Lmao! I had no idea that existed. Thank you. 

See /u/SloppySynapses! /u/arsonbunny is a big phony. 
Dude, I usually think gypsy is over the top, but if arson is making shit up then it does call into question the reliability of random users on this sub. How do I know if I can trust any of the numbers he posts? 

Now I gotta assume everyone's lying lol

E: don't know who's lying anymore. Gypsy is an asshole but he's not really a liar. That's all I will say. Done w the drama for now 
>I'm having to dig through a bog of utterly pointless shit to find anything of value.

Yeah, the pointless shit is what I'm pointing out. You think it's okay for people to post false information and purposefully mislead people? Are you out of your mind? The vote manipulation alone is again reddit ToS. 

Sorry you don't care, some of us do.
Thanks, I'm having a great time so far. :)
In NY now for business in the financial district and asked a bunch of people about insider trading, money laundering, etc. Whether true or not, it was widely agreed upon that insider information is rampant and everyone "knows a guy" who made millions on insider tips. 

Also, tons of new construction and rumors are that many existing residential buildings are actually mostly empty and are being used for money laundering from overseas entities. 

But then again, they also said the bitcoin news that broke came from the CEO of bitcoin and despite 5 min of passing discussion, I could not convince them that there is no CEO of bitcoin.
In the United States, I expect this to mean that businesses raising money using ICOs are going to get hit with huge fines or officers are going to prison.

At the very least, this is a money maker for the US Government.
When I saw that spike I thought "It was still struggling to be where it was, I'm not sure this news changes anything substantially."

This shows me that the alt market is deeply unhealthy and the bitcoin market is just regular unhealthy.
Yeah, really. The sole "valuable" use case for Ethereum right now is ICO issuance, all of which will come under scrutiny.
Yeah. They didn't specifically say it, but I think the genesis of ETH might constitute a security for them - premine and presale.

https://twitter.com/nathanielpopper/status/1007303260250599425
That is the definition of a BGD!

10% in 15 minutes
Nah, I got nervous with the violence of the spike. Want to wait it out and see if there's follow through or same old sad bulls. 
Yeah me too, feeling just a little bit silly for thinking this would go lower. closing/longing for the chop was worth it, I should've done it. it was pretty overextended downwards. 

Now it's a bit awkward here. 

Think we'll chop around $6.3-7.2k for a bit.

A strong move up here would not really surprise me though, this could have legs to $7.8 even. 

The support triangle line should be tough to break through though so we'll have to see
The chances are this is going to rise higher. At least and very short them, Asia is going to react first to this in a few hours, and they are always overly excited about bull news, so likely, positively, and then there's the weekend incoming. Likely we will see 7xxxx at least on Saturday. EMA-12 15m/1h/4h all already turned into support.

Edit: Plus I think quite many people are on the lookout for the same BGD from the beginning of April, i.e., expecting it to happen again, at least to some extent. I've already seen several comments on that.

Edit: Typos
I agree, although in btc I'm personally fine using 4h-1d charts. the success of those patterns are generally incredibly reliable axrually, which is part of the reason I am wondering how people who do TA don't see the big ass consolidation range breaking down as incredibly bearish.

A 10 or even 20% move means nothing compared to a 5 month range breaking down on high volume imo. 

we could always go back up and retest it but people thinking this is the bottom simply because it's not a new low yet have me a bit confused, it really seems just a bit bleak
Interesting, unfortunately i try not to ignore wicks, they are important! 

Plus it seems every ascending  triangle we've seen in the past few weeks has been indicative of a huge move down lol

>The actual quote appears to have more nuance than that: "current offers and sales."

Seems like the beginning of ETH with premine and presale might meet the securities definition.
> Ethereum network is also decentralized.

lol
This is Bitcoin markets... Not ethereum markets... 
They know they have a problem, they did what they could in short notice. That's why I like them. But they should've already make some changes in performance. It's taking too long. And I hate they don't have mobile app.
So don't blame bitmex...
Yeah, because on sudden drop you exit long with limit order...

Mex doesn't have big fees.

That's why we're in this bear market 😫
Whales are people too
$6m*, which is even harder to believe. But there's investors out there who have enough money to gamble with six million. This isn't a sure sign.
What about "never sell into weakness, and never buy into strength"? Even if it is a pretty large amount, is it so hard to believe that this is just somebody scaling in?
I think it means that some large market actor has determined that this is a good time / price to go long. This person/company doesn't care if it gets "eaten up" short term.
Maybe they have another few million to spend and are eating up whilst the going is good. 

Who knows really. 
Spoofy has been using his 1k wall to get his sells filled higher all the time lately. He's tricking fishies and bots by spoofing.. Been doing it regularly since $7ks
Yeah, I've held it too long. I should make a rule that I close any positions with >100% ROE lol. 

I was about to market close it on the 6600 break (spot), but it stalled by the time I got there. June was still under 6600, so I figured I might as well double the position and set market stops where I was going to manually market close. The additional risk is small compared to the potential reward.

Seemed like there were high leverage FOMO longs jumping on, and that's usually the time to short.
or she
Yeah. I'm pretty sure we've set the range we'll spend most of the year at $6000-$9800. And I think we should break out over $12000 sometime in November or early December. 
I agree about EOS, it was clear we were just basically waiting for it to stop pumping before we moved down again. it was putting the whole market on delay
Create a copy of 'work' related website with an 'i-frame' of bitmex ui inside.

Bitter sweet.
Swear i heard this last week
They have laws and regulations to discourage it.
You read all these elaborate fantasy narratives in here about what whales are doing and institutional investors and every other possible factor that could influence the price, in theory.  But it is mostly fantasy and mental masturbation and best ignore all that nonsense if you want to try to trade profitably.
Volume has been pretty high.  The dumps have been getting bought up.  The Bitcoin being dumped will run out before the dollars to buy will.
I am using BBW (BBand Width) - so you are right, I wasn't eyeballing it ;) 
he should have chosen a unique name.
.... a private channel you can't post to. LOL

and "BCash".

Yeah, ok, the kid is 15 maybe, so congrats I guess.
You have better entry, I had like 2 mins to see what's going on and decide.

Doesn't really matter if this is good news, it's buy the news, now I know why this 1k market buy today. This can stop right here or may start new DCB wave. Anyway don't wanna stay in the way when can't babysit this.
We didn't see this lately, but there are 4-5 trading times in 24h time frame. When news hit the fan you usually have 3-4 waves followed by sideways or little reverse movement. BTC is usually immune to this but sometimes it plays out.

Used to trade alts on news break ;-) That's why I'll wait it out.
They were saying the same at 19.5k...

I'm a realist, you're lunatic.

I don't mind when people call for a moon. I hate when people can't imagine it may collapse.
Cool
That's what I talked about, but we could draw it like ascending triangle. Both don't look too good for now.
it's not the technology they hate, it's the fraud they hate and then when exposing the fraud the hostility they get from people benefiting from the fraud.

thats what drives the hate.

it does not change anything. people were able to sell at these price, who bought coins for pennies. 2 Billion is just so much less than the total market cap of \>800 Billion.
[removed]
Sure but if he firmly believes $6k is bottom the r/r should be thru the roof. I mean really pretty high ya know?

But that makes sense. I guess not everyone thinks like me and actually takes profits sometimes. 😅
Gotcha... yeah the different exchanges have that big pennant support at different levels.

I'm with you on closing out my long if/when we approach $7k
If you are refering to what i think you are, its a Bull flag since comes after a pump. 

Bear flags comes after dumps. 
Yeah, this feels like goodish news for ETH, bad news for the sea of shitcoins, and basically neutral for BTC. Ratio bots keeping things in check, but if anything, this should be bullish for ETH, neutral for BTC, and bearish for BTC/ETH and all the "tokens" out there.
Only a sith deals in absolutes.
well then you are lost
Non-sequitur.


is this the same as shorting with 50% at 1x?
If people holding bitcoin expect a bear market, they would have already sold.  Holders of bitcoin, by definition, expect a bull market.  Holders of any asset expect that asset to increase, or they would not hold it. 

Since 2014, bitcoin holders expected price to increase, as they always do.  However, I believe those who were not market participants expected a decline...I ahree with you that they are a reverse sentiment indicator. 
Looks like they were selling before the news hit
Looks more like a sell the rumour, buy the news situation.
How is this selling the news when this news is causing the bounce? Or am I missing something?
https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/14/bitcoin-and-ethereum-are-not-securities-but-some-cryptocurrencies-may-be-sec-official-says.html maybe?

6 out of the last 7. Total gain ~15 percent so far. 

I have sold hoping to buy back lower in the past and watched it go up 20 percent in a week. Talk about feeling like a dumbass! Not making that mistake again.
> My theory is that now a lot of traders are so afraid of large movements that they put super tight stops and when the market moves one way the stops cascade into one another.

For sure. Combine that with people getting liquidated trading on 100X and you've some fun ol volatility. 
But your theory doesn't have one group of people dominating another group of people so it holds less weight (in blockchain land). Also claims of wanting a free market free from regulation except when that dude has more money than me and can temporarily influence the market against me, cant have that can we?
> that make no sense. And they're consistent and expected.

You realise that you contradicted yourself in your next sentence? 
Barts are a consequence of derivatives becoming more prevalent. I am not talking about CME or CBOE, rather Bitmex. 

With the huge volume that is now there, larger traders are simply employing better strategies to hit stops. So many retailers use too much leverage with too much size & are easily exploitable. You can call this manipulation but in reality it is just trading the conditions, specifically when the market is uncertain & in a low volume state. 

Trading will get more difficult on short time frames. See how FX trades for the movements on how this is going to evolve once the bigger fish are in.


So it takes half as much volume to cause the price to rise as it does to make it fall. That's bearish in your mind? Please read up on supply and demand. Someone needs to create a lot of supply (dump coins) to get the price to fall a little bit. 

The supply of Bitcoin is limited. Any dumper trying to drive the price down with big dumb market sells will run out of coins at some point, then steady demand will quickly drive it back up.
It's a fair argument, but when comparing it to our other run ups (which occurred on decreasing volume) the market seems much more confident in its upward trajectory  (at least currently )
edit: if by lagging indicator you mean it lags behind price action, then I think it could be one. How long does it take the average person to go from googling bitcoin to buying bitcoin? (verification, bank transfers, etc)
semi-serious lol, but on this time frame https://s.put.re/No7azad.png , on bitfinex that wick ruins it tho.
None. All year. All the people that see all of these H&S and IH&S are just putting their bias into choppy price action or their trying to make sense of some past movements in hindsight (MagicpoopCannons shitty TA comes to mind). I rarely ever see a H&S pattern that actually looks legit in crypto.
That one is pretty forced looking on top of that. That’s not even a right shoulder. 
Not any more forced than that ascending wedge
I mean it comes down to supply and demand and my argument is basically that supply would overwhelm demand if the market is clearly manipulated 20% upwards in an hour again. But I'm just speculating on that, it's not a technical argument. 

Price discovery allows for supply/demand to catch up, if there is no real price discovery then the price will tend to fall back to where it was before. This is exactly what we saw with the BGD 
What if I told you...
you're the crowd?
Those numbers are excellent, but really vague and they only really apply over long time periods.  They're not going to be excellent at predicting the lowest low of the bear run.

IMO we'll see somewhere between $3k-$5k as a lowest low and we'll see a bounce within 30 days to $4.5k-$6k, which will be kind of the new floor value going forward.  Pretty well in line with those fundamental value numbers
That is nonsense.  You could take any other number and curve fit some data to say that is the "fundamental value".  No one knows what the fundamental value of BTC is and the market decides the only value that matters.
Yeah, I think we spend about 1 more week in this 6100-6900 range to complete the left shoulder. Then we will have the capitulation into the low 5's, perhaps wicking below, maybe stay there for 3-4 daily candles to form the head, and then a strong move back into the 6100-6900 range to form the right shoulder. 

It will look like an inverse H&S on the daily, on the weekly it might make a bullish engulfing. 

This is highly speculative though, this is where I got the idea: [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/tlo0V1AE-BTC-Capitulation-still-ahead-potential-reversal-soon/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/tlo0V1AE-BTC-Capitulation-still-ahead-potential-reversal-soon/)

The other possibility is we get the inverse H&S shape, but instead of completing it gets rejected from 6900 again and rolls over below 5k. This would lead to the longer bear market, but either way, there HAS to be a big bounce from the 5k level, the support is just too strong there.
It definitely cleared the order book though. Interestingly, a green wick happened on June futures around the same time, so we're currently in the odd situation where Sept futures are trading below June futures.
That doesn't sound that bad to be honest, just the trades that you closed too early and went the right way. 
Plot twist: Goblin Town is where no coiners go when big Bitcoin shorts have to cover, sending the price of BTC skyrocketing. You won't see me there.
Don't mind the haters, I didn't doubt your sincerity at all. 

Peace. 
Dude, he is just a translator, a shitty one, Ill give you that, but somebody needs to translate if we dont want our world to crumble
Oh I see, I thought you meant you opened a short today and it’s already in 290% profit. I wasn’t even sure a 100x short opened today could give those kind of profits.
I was talking much shorter time frame. Just the past 30-60 minutes. On most of the last dumps, there have been some deeper downward wicks bought up, stall, then the cliff. Often a spoofy wall has appeared after the downward wick is bought up. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/BwuSikh8/
You set a stop?
I dont think thats a 13 on the 12 hour actually, its a new down trend (starting at a 1).  The would-be "10" candle opened higher than the close of the "6", which invalidated the 13 setup.

Edit: See pink line - https://www.tradingview.com/x/MefUPHYW/
Short now; I think you can make alot of money
Right. Like I can buy bread and feed my kids with that.
If I lose keys to my bank account or I get hacked bank will give me back my money. It's regulated.

We live in a real world where you buy food for $ and BTC is speculative asset. You can make money out of it but don't be delusional thinking BTC is real currency. At the moment it isn't. It's a toy to make money by taking it from others.
> Nice entry BTW, I was exiting short at your entry, but didn't want to go to sleep with anything besides hedge open ;)

I had a long from there before going to bed but then closed it at break even for the same reason :(  
Thanks man. I was stopped out of a long at 6550 yesterday, but think bulls will defend $6k aggresively, considering the impact to market confidence that would follow if it drops. So longing the bottoms here isn’t a bad shout, at least in the short term.
I don't like trailing stops. Used them for scalps on alts, but they make you exit exactly where you didn't want to.
Because their worth increases when the majority all start investing again. Investment will increase just below 5k.
It’s shorts holding down the price? Cool. A lot of shorts closed last night and longs opened. How come we are not going up yet?
Yeah man free love and tree hugging woohoo
I'm not short. In fiat waiting for 4.9k. 
Okay I haven’t made a bitmex account what’s the point in a vpn? I know what it is but why use it for the site?
Well he asked to long as well :P 
Agreed. If the trendline was more convincing, or this move was on a greater time frame, I may have been interested. However, I’m just not interested in scalping <$100 moves anymore. It’s just too choppy for that here.

(Edit: For what it’s worth, I saw this as a re-test of resistance-turned support of the breakout from the bearish pennant around $6300. I’m surprised it didn’t drop further with this in mind. With the weekend coming, I expect more chop before we finally drop. I guess we’ll see though.)

Lmao I love your translations dude you’re so spot on every one of these 
That's much better, but If you're going to make claims like this then you need to show evidence for them. It's not a rule 3 violation, but you're making an unsupported claim about an altcoin. That's a rule 2 violation. If you can provide evidence beyond personal anecdotes then this okay for the altcoin discussion thread. If you can provide convincing proof that an alt leads Bitcoin then it's appropriate for this thread. An unsupported claim is insufficient, though.

That downtrend line is not at 6100: https://www.tradingview.com/x/b7MHIrdB/

More like 5950.
Well I don't really agree with you in the current landscape :) yes the r/r for a long (multi-month to multi-year) play is likely going up, but shorting between here and 7.2k I think is going to be profitable within the week if you're willing to be patient underwater. I still think we have months of downside left before we get back to 8k, personally
r/r here in favor of bulls? what?
And here come the bears with the philosophical observations about human nature. The fact is we have been in a huge bearish trend. At some point there will be a true bottom. I believe the 6.15 wick was that bottom. 
Cmon man, you are obviously bullish, so why deny him the chance to be bearish? It's not like either direction is guaranteed. Or if you think eventual new ATH is guaranteed, then you are just a fool. 

I'll say this about Sloppy though, the guy has shorted from 11000 to 6000 and now again from 10000. He has always been true to his belief and that's more than you can say about a lot of other folks here. 
I just genuinely feel bad for bagholders. That's really it.

And those 9000+ Bitcoin mainnet nodes means 9000 users running them too. Do you understand how Bitcoin network is built? You gotta start somewhere. As said, LN is still a "working concept".

> I'm just trying to see something positive from the situation and a way that can counter the arguments against the price pump that occurred due to tether.

During pretty much the whole uptrend asian exchanges traded at a premium to those with USDT. Also, I remember GDAX leading over Finex quite regularly. Why would non-tether exchanges pump the hardest if it was all manufactured by fake USDT?

No *public audit* doesn't mean tether associates didn't do their homework in private. Bittrex and Kraken are serious businesses with actual lawyers. Does anyone believe they would accept the liability of accepting potentially fake dollars?

Kraken is an independent exchange with a USDUSDT pair that trades 1:1. USDT can be shorted on margin for an insane r/r if the FUD is true. Why is nobody putting money where their mouth is?

*Edited to add*: If Bitfinex wanted to create fake balances they could simply change some numbers in their internal database. Why would they create such an elaborate scheme with a publically trackable omni token instead? Someone who is not incredibly stupid will fake money in secret and not in broad daylight.
Central banks are upfront about it.
the whole purpose of bitcoin was to get away from that... and here we are doing it ourselves and nobody seems to care because it made the price go up with inflation.

something bitcoiners claim to hate
No, it's apparently no big deal to have a cryptocurrency backed by fiat and then to use that crypto to purchase BTC.  Whats the difference if we use BTC to purchase alts?

[Edit]  I don't think the issues are as clear as it appears.  Every new coin/token being created is essentially printing dollars.  Just because one is pegged or floated doesn't change the situation much.

I guess if your net loss exceeds your stake you get liquidated? If i go 10x short at $5000 and the price goes up to $5501 wouldn't that be liquidation?
Yup, opening opposite when you're already in good profit is completely different story.

You've opened a long when I closed my short :(
Eventually - if and when they actually stop doing it. For now the news is reducing confidence that the central banks have any ammo left to help the currency out.
yeah, and what about the countless of people asking how to short since 2 days ago?  


Lets use your analogy, if people keep going short (and they have no fucking clue how) because they think shorting the bottom will generate then 10x returns, the market isn't gonna go anywhere but up.  


I'm a hodler at this point, but i added at 6430 & 6250.  Thanks bears
long since 6250 babyy.. :)
I sure as hell hope so... I'm under water from an uncomfortably large $7,100 long atm...
The molecules in your brain firing and moving around in reaction to internal and external factors are what make you worried
Yes, which is what I said.
It's not it doesn't work. But they have limited queue. Market close positions have priority. Every other order goes into a queue. If queue is full then you get 'system overloaded' error. If you're gonna click 10 times per second on the big move then probably you'll get lucky once and push your order through. Or not. You're fighting with bots here.
You can be 100% legit on BFX with via an LLC. Minimum $10k balance, and they'll want to you to file and FBAR, but you should probably be doing that anyway.
It used to be a thing on GDAX. They flashcrashed ETH and took a huge bath making traders whole, so they aren't doing it anymore.

You can margin trade on Kraken though.

Level of interest jesus christ.
It's not good if true, but I think it bothers me because most of the time it's irrelevant to what's being discussed
Why is it so hard to believe I'm right? *I'm* not known to be a liar, I don't think, and the evidence was/is abundantly clear. 
I don't think arsonbunny is necessarily a terrible guy but he spends a lot of time on Reddit and he does seem to be in the business of manipulating. For instance, he once posted something incorrect (IMO), and I corrected him. He deleted the post and then reposted the initial post so it wouldn't be associated with my reply. I know that's a small move but it struck me.

Everyone should be double-checking everything.

Why would you put your money behind some anonymous poster's thoughts/positions without due diligence?

Was it linked in the comment that’s now showing as removed by the mods? Not sure what’s going on here but I can vouch for the fact that gypsy has previously stalked and harassed arson in the past. If he had issues he should take them to the mods and let them sort it out but he seems to have decided that he has a responsibility to campaign against certain users under the guise of “helping”. The sub was far more peaceful during the timeframe when he was banned. 
My guess is now they're waiting at 6k
When someone follows you around for that long you probably get tired of it. I imagine arson finally decided he'd be ready next time he showed up lol

Lightning is as big a game-changer as was bitcoin. Thx for the cheap coins.
That the pump was due to the EOS launch.
That the EOS mainnet had launched, and that caused the FOMO to kick in within the markets.

well of course the 1d chart is useful, else why have charts.  just talking about the smaller timeframes.  I guess 1-6h lets you see korea vs europe vs US



More like in like the past month+.  Any scale, of all I've watched, one out of five or ten broke up.
>Seems like the beginning of ETH with premine and presale might meet the securities definition.


Which ultimately affects a small amount of people who are now very wealthy if they held.
Anything that is good for the space in general will help the BTC price, especially in these early stages of the market. 
To be fair I'm glad they are not focussing on developing an app right now, and like to think all there development  resources are working to improve the engine. Although they may just be replacing them hamsters when they die  of exhaustion.
I was thanking bitmex actually.
yes you put the limit below the trigger
yup. we're going to 8k boys-- thats where the battle will be fought 
Yeah... My math sucks :D
Because the 1k market order was followed by spoofed 1.5k limit order. That looked exactly like a try for a bull trap.
Yeah. Just saying that it was 100% long time when this happened on the bull market. Now there are no follow-ups for those huge buys and usually they end up going with big market sell soon.
I know, but usually it's not followed by 1k market buy.
Yeah I missed out on my second big short of the week because I was waiting for 6000 to break. I think the rule that you brought up before that I need to ingrain is "close to your target is good enough". I hit my first short term goal this week and was really close to hitting my medium one and greed took over I guess.
I don't use this now, but I had a strategy that I bail out if it reverses x%. It worked.
or it (but probably not a bot)

I think you rushed it. That was nice entry to take a gamble and keep until be.

I do lol. I'm still on the fence about TA. Not sure if it actually works in crypto or is a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
why? you could spend less $ and get more btc to sell than someone buying now, for example people who bought thousands of btc under $1000 or something ?
I don't know, check the positive volume after the first bottom in February and the second bottom in April. Look at 4 hour candles. As soon as the bottom was hit, the green volume candle completely overshadowed the previous red candle.

When we hit the "bottom" yesterday with that 4 hour red candle, not even the combined volume of the next two 4 hour green candles was enough to oversize the selling pressure.

That weak buying volume got us this weak rally which failed.
Yeah, someone got a text this morning.

Still, after the hit I took overnight, I'm not really looking to surrender more BTC, paper or not, so I'm watching this closely. It does seem to be petering out. I don't want to stay in the way either, so I'm very much ready to bail.
Are you saying that we are still awaiting asia to wake up and read about it?  Or for Europe's mass media to cover it tomorrow?
I really don't trust triangles on short time frames. 
ETH is drawing a pennant and BTC is looking bartsy...

I might open a small short after all, adding just below resistance and bailing above 6600 (or 500 on ETH, as i find ETH more profitable lately)
Because claiming that the 'crazy bubble' price action is a direct result of whatever malicious third parties using made up money to 'manipulate the prices' while ignoring not one but two regions having much higher than the 'manipulated' prices seems rather... ridiculous? It's not as if it was a one off thing either, both Japan and Korea traded at slight premiums almost always, and went on crazy 30%+ premiums multiple times. Calling it 'a few exchanges in Asia' when those 'few exchanges' accounted for nearly half the global volume is kind of silly, too. (actually I think they might have had more than half global volume at times but cba checking now, regardless it was a significant chunk of it). 

And the no arbitrage part just makes this theory even dumber.
Asian markets traded at a premium for almost all of 2017.
Yeah, I'll sleep better with a gain in my account.  If it's down in the morning, I'll try the same trade again.  Long with 3x has worked pretty well for me because you can always wait it out or add if it goes south, and if it goes your way like it did today, hey, all the better.
On a larger scale I see a bear flag, this recent pump is just a part of it still.
Why do you think it's neutral for BTC? When word spreads that some exchanges won't be able to list these tokens and that holders of those tokens might incur different taxes and be subject to more regulation, don't you think a lot of people will move their alt holdings to BTC? Some will move to fiat but I'll bet more than 50% stays in cryptoland. 
BTC is the main currency in our shitcoin casino (we trade shitcoins mostly for BTC) which adds a lot of value to BTC. However shitcoins are born mostly by ETH-based ICOs these days. Therefore a confirmation that everything is fine with ETH is good for BTC.

> It's obvious they aren't commodities either, but part of the US gov't says that they are, for their purposes.

Please enlighten me on what you mean here. What are their purposes to falsely classify btc and eth? Definitely sounds like you’re insinuating some sort of malice by US government. 
2x at 50% and you need to have 50% on exchange to cover
That just means that by the time the news is getting out there, the people behind it are already positioned to take advantage and most people jumping on are going to get wrecked by being on the tail end of the move. Much less applicable in the days of the internet, though. 
this is the kind of guidance we get now.  Vagaries.  How do we plan for the future?  Meanwhile connected people like the bogdanovs can do whatever they want and the SEC doesn't even notice.  In addition to blatant market manipulation, now I've just seen footage where they are involved in a murder that was even televised.  Where's the SEC?

Something can be consistent and expected, but still make no sense yanno
> Any dumper trying to drive the price down with big dumb market sells will run out of coins at some point, then steady demand will quickly drive it back up.

This may be one of the more delusional statements I've seen on this sub. 
You're not wrong, last time we had similar bullish volume was from 7050 to 7500. But the problem has been the follow through.
The first drop to 6k resulted into a legit iH&S. Problem is people callling for iH&S patterns before they are complete, or they force something into an iH&S pattern where it makes little sense to interpret it as one. 
just saying 3 points of contact of support and resistance

Have you ever read one of his/her posts?
Oh weird timing about June.  
Actually you're right, it's not so bad.  It's been decent RR management through the wrong calls & bad luck.   Thanks for reminding me.  Got caught up looking at the potential profits I missed out on.
Ok, I thought you were talking about today's 6.6 wick.
only manual stops in chop city. 
Oh yeah for sure, that's our current reality.

I was sort of going off the rails into worse case scenarios, such as when banks use fractional reserves and can't pay up when everyone comes back to drain their accounts.  Insurance in the modern era has bailed out banks, but even that can only go so far, and can cause hyperinflation.

I was sort of just going off on a fuck the system rant ;)
Bulls had a lot of occasions to stop this from dropping since we bounced from 10k. Actually 10k was open, right in front of them and they decided they give up.

I just don't believe in going up yet.

But yes, we're close to testing ATH line. This may not have a lot of room to fall from here.
For me, they’re good if you’ve passed your profit target point and you want to lock that profit in, but also allow flexibility to increase profits further if the price continues to move in your direction. Good if you don’t want to babysit a position.

Yes, it is, but some people like those scalps better than long term. Not a reason to make fun of them. We all try to make money here and every single one here has a different strategy for doing this.
That guy is doing it to everyone- don't worry. You could say "I'm going out for a walk" 

and he'd be like 

"Translation: I'm trying to make it seem like bitcoin isn't important to me because I'm shorting it. If I make it seem like I don't care about bitcoin, people will realize it's worthless and sell." 
This is just heavy handed moderation. There is a link between alts and btc even if you don’t want to accept it. And the heads up he gave was correct and came true minutes after. You deleting his post could have cost someone money.
In this case what would be necessary? Showing past examples of the correlation of my observation if it's based on alt coins?
yes, pardon me.  But it is pretty damn close?
Difference of opinion then! No problem, I believe we will run on a much more accelerated timeframe. I believe we could see sub 6k, as well as 8k within the next 2 weeks. But many shorters will eventually be late to the party, and get burned bad. 
Mid-Long term 100% it is
If you ignore all technicals and fundamentals, this could go to infinity. So longing is the best r/r you can get. 

Thing is you could say that about longing the price of my fingernails clippings, too. 
Nah, you really don't. You make fun of them endlessly (which doesn't bother me) but don't say you feel bad for them. You're short, and want to spread fud. Get over yourself and make a valid point for once.

They have fucked the market up and it is all down to pure greed.
Which begs the question why don't they clear this up once and for all, instead they fire their auditor 
It's all FUD and speculation at this point. The price has been manipulated down this year more than it was manipulated up last year.
Nice!  Thanks buddy.
We need to go deeper
I write bots and it is hard too. There was a point where my automatic orders queued and then filled all together, I ended up losing lots because my size was ten times larger than intended. 
I remember the flash crash cause I remember people selling for 10 cents on market sells and complaining and blaming Gdax.
I'm sure we can find a middle ground that's comfortable for everyone.

No, this is the least of what he does. He manipulates, uses alts, posts fake screenshots, falsifies data, lies, makes libelous statements. 

The guy is a complete schmuck and needs to be perma-banned and his alt accounts tracked and banned as well.

r/CryptoCurrency moderator here. Luckily, we keep exceptional logs on users to be able to reference this information.

You were [literally caught responding to your own posts](https://imgur.com/Bin0HbH). We called you on on this, and you responded:

> Yes I do have an alt and I had a really bad day and was having an arguement with [redacted account] about the model and decided to log into my other account and basically back myself up. It was a stupid thing to do and I regret it, I even PM'd [redacted account] to apologize

We eventually offered to reduce your ban as an olive branch. However, using alts to manipulate your content is strongly against Reddit's rules and **will not** be tolerated on our subreddit.

I am not sure what the conflict is here, but we have had rough histories with VeChain and u/arsonbunny. We have noticed some other unusual behavior, such as attempting to get around the Vechain and comedy rules that were in place at certain times.

You think what he's doing is okay? That's unbelievable.

Fair enough, that looks legit. u/arsonbunny is there an explanation for that?

Regardless of what arsonbunny has been doing, that's no excuse for your behavior dude.  Two wrongs do not make a right.  Just wake up and look at the response you're getting HERE.  This is not normal behavior.  Why are you being so destructive?

Doesn't work without 0x (0x is US based in this case, so that's a company that's really at risk if it's a security... which it almost certainly is) or something similar. There has to be someone who takes risk somewhere in the middle of the process.

IMO, Lightning using cross chain swaps is as close as we can get to a truly decentralized exchange ATM. Someone may abstract that out into more layers later, but right now all possible implementations and implications of Lightning are still being worked out.

I could bet that the guys that make the app are not the ones that work on engine.

They published somewhere that it's under development. I can bet they don't publish it because of the engine performance problem.
You were thanking bitmex in a way 'they're so shitty that I couldn't close'. You should thank yourself that you used the wrong button ;)
If the limit price is too low it'll execute as market order
I love the fact that regulations are now bullish
You really shouldn't be so sure of what direction this is going. Zealots don't last long in the world of crypto. 
That's my queue

!short XBTM18 close 6595


Could be, but I had the opportunity to nearly offset the hit I took on the short overnight, and I'm not phenomenal at managing multiple positions. 
If the price declines further - there is no guarantee of that. 
News spread in waves. It's not like the whole world just read them. 24h until wave closes.
I'm saying that if it has legs it won't be one 30% push. It'll come in waves. If not then we'll retrace.
Yeah, it's not a good point to open trade.

I have a hedge from 6.8 and 1x short from 6.5, so basically CA around 6650 on both. No big deal if it breaks up.
You and diydude are actually alright. pretty cool guys.  :P

Nice trade again, like I said wish I had closed/longed even just for a small gain. 

You're correct that a culling of shitcoins should boost BTC. This is a valid counterpoint. 
CFTC classifies BTC as a commodity for their purposes.  Google it if you don't understand or need to learn more.
You're right, and when you're right, you're right they say. 


I don't believe so.  It could be entertaining nonsense, but nonsense nonetheless.  The only value would be to use his calculations over time to see if his arbitrarily calculated value is higher or lower at that time.
Lol figured. Good luck ‘ol chap
Don't think BTC will help if that happens ;)
Okay so I’m guessing you need to get verified before you can do contracts for longing and shorting?
I didn’t intend to make fun of anyone. I just meant that it’s hard to trust TA lines before enough points of contact are made. People were undecided on if it was an ascending wedge or triangle, and the point of contact for the left side of the upper trendline was on the way down. I’m fine with a little scalping, in fact I’m in one right now. I’m just leery about doing it on a small move with somewhat questionable TA.
There's a pattern forming where people make unsupported claims about alts and use those claims to break rule 2 and rule 5. We're here to discuss Bitcoin. If other coins are relevant then we need to discuss how and why as a community. It can't remain an unsubstantiated meme that a few people rally behind so they can skirt the rules.

Also typical for this pattern is for someone to airdrop into the conversation and  accuse me of over moderating.

I'm enforcing the rules in a pretty fair and friendly way. If you don't agree, report me to the admins.

It's not my job to protect someone's investment. It's my job to enforce the rules as fairly as I'm able to.
You need to do your own research on how to do this. Basically, you need to provide an explanation that has real properties and provides some level of predictive accuracy that other people can replicate.

If someone else has done the work on that, you can just link to it.
Well, 3% off the line isn't particularly close, but lines really are just zones. Double bottom or triple bottom of 6000 from February / April is a possibility until 6K falls, but it's not confirmed until >10K or >12K
As an experienced bottom shorter, you're right about that. I'm just amazed I actually learned my lesson this time and took profits
You ignore all qualitative metrics, as well as long-term adoption and regulative bullish news. Again with another erroneous comparison. Time will tell. 
I make fun of crypto rich bag holders for thinking they're better than other people by getting lucky. 

I feel terrible for anyone who bought after December 2017 

What's funny is no one sees the irony in your comment: you are shilling a long term position as soon as you switch to long. 

"Spreading FUD" Is such a ridiculous moon boy comment, as is "The risk isn't holding, the risk is not holding and missing the bus." 

Your investment strategy is quite literally FOMO, and you're trying to incite it within other people to get them to buy so you can make more money. 

But yeah, I'm the one "FUDding" lol
You really don't understand how this works. You're confusing the idea of a "client" (not a "full node") with an actual "node" (aka "full node"). Non-listening client is not a "full node". Node is an actual listening (and hence participating = sharing block information) server and a part of the network, mainly listening Bitcoin Core. 

Back to the basics:

* https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node
* https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#what-is-a-full-node
* https://bitnodes.earn.com/
* https://coin.dance/nodes

Incidentally, there aren't that many. The figure of 9000-10000 looks legit. In the same way there aren't that many SPV servers, e.g. ElectrumX, only 100-120 or so.
not at all... if it was artificially manipulated upwards, then it's going to go down.

just like what happened with mtgox in 2013. 

if bitcoin rose due to legitimate demand and legitimate usage and expansion of the bitcoin economy, it would not crater in price a month later.
NP :)
Internal and external factors are purely based on classical mechanics (from what we know), so you were hard wired to worry at that point in the first place.
I said it before - if you get error - it doesn't go through, if you don't - it's queued.

You didn't wait for confirmation.
That was bs that they reimbursed those people for that.  The system worked like it was supposed to.
I do, when i say TA are shit posts i mean they aren’t reliable and just an opinion. You can have an opinion with words or you can do with with a graph and triangles. It’s all the same
Only shills, trolls, morons, etc. don't like me. That's a lot of people but the good ones actually *do* like me. Also, I'm pretty sure I'm still one of the higher score average posters here. I was the last time someone ran the subreddit stats.
How is it unnecessary? This guy was caught red handed, multiple times and people should be aware so that they can tag him appropriately.


Why do you think he's smart? Because he posts verbose comments that *seem* to be intelligent?

I've called him out many times for making false claims (such as crypto TA is borrowed from "equities markets"). The guy makes specious claims. He's a charlatan, trying to pass himself off as an expert. Look at the PM he sent me from MissReal, FFS. He thinks that the mods love him and think he's the smartest guy in the sub. They don't. He's just a blowhard, manipulative fuckface. 

Gone with him.
[deleted]
Iirc this all stems back to a screenshot that gypsy decided had to be fake. Imo even if it was fake it wouldn’t justify his behavior past that point. He’s not a mod or defender of the weak or whatever he seems to think he is
God this is too good.
Yes that's correct, I really don't want to encourage gypsytoys psychotic obsession with me and his constant harassment but I guess I should just come clean and say I did make a mistake 5 months ago in a completely separate sub and apologized for it. I have been given a lot of hate by VeChain people in that sub on many occasions over my pessimism at the valuation so that conflict goes way back. 

The incident happened in the /r/Cryptocurrency thread where I did a fairly indepth valuation for VeChain, which resulted in a bunch of Vechain shills from /r/VeChain that frequented that sub attacking me. Got a really nasty PM from one of them too. I tend to be conservative in my investing and valuation and my long term 30 year valuation only showed a 2x in price increase given my stated growth assumptions, which the shills hated. This was back during the peak bubble days mind you.

[Here is the same valuation in CryptoMarkets I also posted, where luckily /r/VeChain wasn't patrolling](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/7p7ssy/i_created_a_fundamental_quantitative_valuation/). It goes in depth and shows the work and how I arrived at my valuation.

I put a lot of work into it and had a really shitty day at work (also it was a rough time with my father's health), so getting attacked for it didn't sit well with me and I made a dumb decision to try and encourage myself. Yes I have another account that I don't use for crypto, its primarily for sports/politics and it was opened in my other browser discussing NFL. It was dumb and I do regret doing it, but I made the rash decision to encourage myself among all the hate the /r/VeChain people were giving me and post that "thanks for this arsonbunny" message. But I never upvoted myself or tried to actually manipulate or fake data, it was a dumb emotional mistake to pat myself on the back. 

Well the VeChain people caught that before I deleted it realizing what I had done and tried to get me banned with the mods claiming that I upvoted myself. That temp ban was removed and I went to the admins to confirm that I never upvoted my main account with that account. 

For context, any mention of VeChain on /r/cryptocurrency was banned for a month over how aggressively it was shilled by organized shill groups. I was glad that it was, because I would get non-stop hate whenever I would say anything negative about VeChain's prospects or tell people that it wasn't going to $600 like Ethereum.

Yes I admit it was a really dumb thing to do, one made at an emotional time personally for me and I regret it but its hardly proof of me trying to shill anything as gypsy claims. I have no self-interest in making VeChain prices go down, you can't even short that. I have also never tried to shill anything here, and always show my reasoning and sources if I claim something. 

Now gypsytoy is trying to use this one incident of me patting myback and telling myself "you're appreciated" after putting a shit ton of work into something and getting attacked by actual real organized shill as some proof that I'm actually a shill myself and therefore must be instantly discounted! He is doing this so he doesn't have to address the arguements I make, which are often in-depth and give tons of sources and backup. He can instead just create the "look a shill!" ad hominem by attacking the person instead of what he is saying. It works too often on Reddit.

BTW if anyone is interested, [here is the full post where the admin posted the ban, they removed it after getting that PM.](http://archive.is/ZOgsT) Its just some good investment advice and it was posted in December during the dumb money craze. It went to top of /r/all with 20K upvotes. I have many of the top posts in /r/Cryptocurrency too.
Lol, how will /u/arsonbunny navigate his way through *this*? 

The context is [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8qr0fd/new_york_times_university_of_texas_at_austin/e0opb9m/), in case you're wondering.

This guy is a complete scammer.
Yeah /u/arsonbunny, *those* screenshots were not faked (unlike the screenshots you post of fake BitMEX positions), so care to walk that back and explain yourself for real? 

Or are you just going to delete all your posts again and start shilling from another account?
Is all of this about a five month old post? I don’t even know what happened here, I just got a user name ping in my inbox, I just wish they’d let the mods handle it and leave each other alone the rest of the time. 
Look, take it to the mods. You are not a mod, you are not a defender of the weak or whatever. You are a simple user like the rest of us and your behaviour absolutely does start teetering into that of stalking and harassing. 
I literally don't know what to believe when it comes to arson faking that screenshot only because someone else I trust said it was likely faked. 

However bitmex *does* have UI issues (I see it on testnet all the time)

but most importantly you said you wouldn't respond to him anymore and now you have. 

Gypsy, really, be careful, these are not ArsonBunny alts. You are very belligerent and there is no shortage of people who will side with him when it comes to saying you deserve a ban

You've been so much calmer and cooler lately. Don't blow it to try to play sheriff on this guy 
[deleted]
Calling out scammers for being scammers is disruptive? It's a public service, dude. Everyone should be tagging this moron and his alts. Mods should be removing him too.


Sorry you disagree with me about BCH and ETH, but this issue should be entirely separate. Scammers have no place here.
Can you send me a DM that describes your interpretation of this conflict?
Lol, you're a moron. You think I'm faking *that* too? How many fucking sockpuppets does this asshole have?
Have we had any other exchanges? Not that I could find. If you have them, post them up.
PM'd. I'll delete my comment. didn't mean to make you look suspicious but...I mean it was kind of weird...? 
I have no enemies, only lesser friends. 

You might find it interesting that a certain arsonbunny was caught with several more active sockpuppet accounts.

Errr, after segwit activated (and LN became possible) Bitcoin had the the biggest fiat rally in history. On August 1st 2017, the day segwit was activated, Bitcoin was 2.3k. We all know what happened next.

>In order to raise the money to buy out those holders who insisted upon selling for cash, and also to provide additional working capital for improvements and promotion expenses, it became necessary to raise a few millions. So Barnes saw the president of his bank, who kindly lent his syndicate three million five hundred thousand dollars. The collateral was one hundred thousand shares of the newly organised corporation. The syndicate assured the president, or so I was told, that the price would not go below 50. It would be a very profitable deal as there was big value there. tweet



Whale ICO pools and BTC underlying manipulation anyone ? :D
You mean like 100% DEX then I guess? I was talking about things like IDEX and AirSwap 
I'll join you with my stupid ETH short, just praying for it to drop 2% so i can close near BE.

If this pumps again i'll need a new butt hole.
You'll be fine. This feels like mainly neutral news that sounds encouraging and dropped while the market was pretty oversold.

It's pretty good news for ETH. I actually intended to buy some under $400.
Ah i get you, i guess i should
After all the whale manipulations, nonestop barts, ceaseless scams, and conartists a little regulation would be great
I'm not 10x short, I don't know where this is going. I'm just saying that 1k market buy didn't put any confidence in buyers.
I get that. Have the same problem. Chewy is good at this. 'Every trade is a new trade, doesn't matter that I just had good profit, I'm in a loss on new trade'.

Sometimes is good to just focus on the one that you have. I shorted at 11k, was too focused on my previous losses to add on the way down or to keep it, wasn't calm enough to just keep it ride, freaked out on the way down, took 3 revenge trades and lost all the profits.

Should focus on the one, add when I should and keep calm. I would probably still ride it.
Layered sells close to the resistance. If this is going down i'm expecting a fake out or at least a wick. 

If this just drops i'll wait on the sidelines.

If it breaks up i'll close it for a small loss. 

RSI on higher time frames still pretty low so any move down should be small. This week should  reset the RSI and only after a real direction will be visible.
Thanks. Additionally, I think it's also possible that this could be bad for ETH in the medium-long term too, since so much of ETH's value is derived from it's utility as an alt-token generator. If there is a major cleansing of shitcoins, will as many people still be demanding ETH?
She backs up her calculations with data. But u r clearly the all knowing oracle so I'm sure it is as you say, nonsense.
I am not margin trading, so its fine
Indeed.  Though 5 years ago or so I was naive enough to think that crypto could swoop in and save the day in a total financial collapse.
On bitmex you don't, but if you are from the US think twice about using them specially with a VPN since you'll be breaking their TOS.
You'll have to read it site by site
It wasn't a triangle, you couldn't properly draw a triangle here, it was a wedge, and yes, 2 points aren't good, but if you go with a scalp on short time frame then it's hard to have more than 2 points.

You're right though. A lot of people here draw random lines and try to trade them.
Hell yeah, it is all about learning and growing in this space. Best of luck in the future!
didn't you hear? good news in a bear market has NO EFFECT ON PRICE ;)
I make fun of bullish posts because I think I'm better than other people for shorting. 

Unironically you recently, just saying, whether you intend to give off that vibe or not. 
Whether a node is listening or not is unrelated to whether it is a full node or not.
It was when they changed how their Api worked in December
Did they? Probably because they had a ton going on at that time and didn't want to lose anymore credibility. 

I remember something similar happening when Bitcoin Cash was implemented. They didn't have enough liquidity and it forced the price up to like $9k temporarily and people got caught with that because of market buys.
To me, this sounds patronizing. It's my understanding that it's common knowledge that TA is someone's best guess. We're dealing in probability and risk reward ratios. Certainty isn't something we can trade in. We share ideas and give feedback. Some people are nicer than others about that. If you're looking for promises and accurate foresight then you're in the wrong place. People come here to discuss what they think, and they're allowed to do that in the way that works best for them, so long as they can follow the rules.
How do you run subreddit stats on poster scores? I didn't know this was possible.
Get a mod to deal with him and have them sticky it or something, I don't know
So ignore him, We all have the option to ignore or block someone. This personal BS doesn't belong here. Were all adults and can make our own decision on who to listen to here, I don't need you or anyone else "protecting" me.
Lol, you're just continuing to lie. Unreal. You've been caught by multiple people, multiple times, across multiple subreddits. /u/SloppySynapses knows, he is just reluctant to get involved in drama and I don't blame him.

STOP SCAMMING PEOPLE, YOU FUCK.
Okay. I'm sorry for posting anything about you. 

Gypsy, don't harass me for this comment. I'm done jumping to conclusions on anything. I'll let the mods figure this out.

not my job
It was fake and it wasn't just multiple screenshots. It was repeated behavior and many people called him out for it. I was just the last and the most adamant. Notice how he hasn't posted those shitty fakes in here for months? You can thank me for that. (he still posts that shit sometimes in /r/CC though)

I don't get why you're defending him. This guy is manipulating and lying to people. He's misrepresenting himself as multiple people and then accusing *me* of doing the same. 

Fuck this guy. It makes me skeptical that you're defending him to the moderate degree that you are. 
Yep, but someone here who is very smart and clearly not gypsy assured me the screenshot was fake. I can find the reason why, it was in the screenshot apparently. 

But I do agree with you, it's a bit over the top. I'll let mods deal with it. Don't want to participate in a witch hunt in case arson actually is innocent. 
~~There's no excusing this action (commenting with an alt to promote your own post), but I wanted to provide a few points in Arsonbunny's favor here.~~

1. ~~I dug into his post history quite a bit trying to find the link to the removed comment that was being referenced.  Yes, the comment was real, however it was the only "promotional" type example I found in his history, including among deleted comments.  I didn't find other examples of him replying to himself.~~
2. ~~I have to respect someone who can come clean and admit they messed up.  Does this mean that this is truly the only time that Arsonbunny did this?  Who knows, I couldn't say.~~
3. ~~It is well known that the vechain shills have been extremely aggressive in r/cc.  That element of the story sounds almost certainly true.~~
4. ~~Arsonbunny PM'd me the above after I found the deleted comments.  I thanked him for coming clean and I was the one that suggested he post the confession and trust that most of the r/BitcoinMarkets community can be forgiving.~~

~~I am inclined to believe he's telling the truth, and that he's truly apologetic.  And I respect people who can come clean and apologize, as I think we need more of that in today's world.  Just wanted people to consider these points.~~

Edit: I stand corrected.  https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ronjo/daily_discussion_sunday_june_17_2018/e0uevcu/
I do not know what sort of drama is going on in this subreddit, and I frankly have too much other drama to deal with in r/CryptoCurrency to be especially interested here.

I will say that fwiw, most posts by u/arsonbunny have been well-received in our community. They have an unusually high number of [Good contributor] badges.
Lmao, this idiot is once again changing his story.

How many lies can you tell, /u/arsonbunny?
All of this is because Gypsytoy has been following people around and harassing them, including me and arsonbunny.  He's very aggressive, as you can probably see.  Arsonbunny got pissed and laid out a whole lot of shit that gypsytoy has been doing.  Gypsytoy however appears to have found somewhere arsonbunny was using alt accounts to try to promote his own shilling.  There might be more to what gypsytoy has been linking to, I can't be arsed to unravel the whole thing.

So there's no innocents here.

And yeah, this would be better off just being left to the mods.  Gypsy doesn't leave things alone though, it seems like he's going to keep posting aggressively.
I've also taken it to the mods. There is not stalking or harassing. I'm pointing out a clear scam. Sorry you don't like it. Seems like you're on arsonbunny's discord group or something. Are you just another sock puppet?
FYI, there's a tool someone wrote to try to make a good guess to whether someone is an alt account or not.  It works by comparing the posting times to find the closest posting time between the two accounts - The theory being that over enough time two individuals will, by random chance, make a post within a few seconds of eachother, but a sockpuppet account will not.

The tool is here: https://83m6a1f16h.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/redditsockdetector/dectect/gypsytoy/missreal

Unfortunately the missreal account is now deleted, so this can't be used this time.  But it can be very helpful in the future :)

>Gypsy, really, be careful, these are not ArsonBunny alts. 

You have no idea. /u/missreal certainly was andI hope you know that.

> Gypsy, really, be careful, these are not ArsonBunny alts. You are very belligerent and there is no shortage of people who will side with him when it comes to saying you deserve a ban

Let's find out. 
I'm not looking for a defense, I'm looking for an honest assessment. Liar and manipulators should be perma-banned from the sub. /u/arsonbunny is a prime example of someone who is pulling the wool over people's eyes. 
> Sorry you disagree with me about BCH and ETH, but this issue should be entirely separate. Scammers have no place here.

Like, literally 5 days ago I was the scammer who had no place here.

This isn't disagreement.  You do this.  You go between extremes.  Sometimes you're polite and nice, the next day you're aggressive and going all out.  That's not a public service, that's called being an asshole.  Do you seriously never step back and look at how you come across and look at your own actions?  Fuck dude, for one thing, how much time do you spend on Reddit each day?
Sure thing, will do today
Hold on maybe we argued when I was using my u/Noeeel account and not my u/hcoalter account....Or maybe it was my u/sloppysynapses account. Shit wait- it was u/MissReal and I just deleted that account so I won’t be able to post our exchanges. 
Wow, dude. Whitewash history and believe someone who's lying to your face. Good job. 

I never got in an argument with that guy. He has positive karma from me. 

You are suckered way too easily.

[deleted]
I don't regret giving anyone the benefit of the doubt.

That said, I stand corrected and can now update my opinions.  He's clearly using other alt accounts.  Edited my comment to state that.
The store of value narrative began falling apart, I know! It was great for shorting.
Gonna be one hell of a movie one day. Glad I was around for it!
can IDEX and AirSwap scale without insane chain bloat? It looks like they're leveraging all on chain transactions... which is expensive and slow, too.
Oh man, that's why I focus on one market, don't like to be DPed. When I saw ETH pump, considered longing the ratio at 0.077 but I really don't want a battle on two fronts. I'm sure I'll kick myself tomorrow when it's at 0.088.
Yeah I'm definitely not buying the news, the bounce was expected. I think the news might've just given some extra power. I might regret tomorrow pulling those adds. We'll see though.
Lol, found some money that I forgot I have on other exchange account. Bought XMR to hold. Just for fun. I'm up $2 :-D
But if you would like to open a short there and couldn't, then yes, mex is shitty right now when big moves happen ;)
> I'm just saying that 1k market buy didn't put any confidence in buyers.

Fair enough then. 
The hits I took yesterday/overnight plus the paper profits that vanished shook my resolve a bit. I want to reduce complications and make decisions more straight forward. I had nearly 30% stack swing (UPNL + realized losses on the short + realized gains on the long) from the bottom of the craziness at 6110 to where we are now. Stings even though it was almost all paper. Right now my short from 7500 is my only position, and it's still a +30% stack increase from when I opened it Sunday. Gotta focus on what's in front of me. 
I wouldn't count on RSI. On the way up it was overbought all the time.
Potentially. If digital tokens are securities and exchanges start delisting them, we'll likely see a flight to the "safe" coins (BTC/BCH/ETH/LTC). XRP should be a security based on what I'm reading. I think XLM and XMR should be safe, but I'm not sure. I'm not much of an alt guy. 

If the ability to generate lots of money through alts goes away, it'll be make or break time for the remaining currency players. BTC should win that fight. We still have to figure out the disaster that is tax, though. It's not practically usable as a currency because of tax laws.
I'm sure she does use data in her calculations.  And that doesn't change one thing that I said.

I don't have to be omniscient to know it is nonsense.
I’m still learning TA to be honest. I assumed you couldn’t form a trendline where the two points of contact were on opposite sides of a trend. That is, the left point of contact on the way down, and the right point on the way up. I’m not surprised it dropped a bit, considering buying pressure seemed to be getting exhausted. However, I am curious if this is common practice for scalps? It obviously worked, so I’m curious on your approach to these circumstances.
Minnows sell into the pockets of sharks at the bottom. Has been the case in every market downturn since the beginning of man. People need to remember why they bought in the first place, and not get scared out of their positions.
I didn't even make fun of him, I am genuinely amazed at how quickly sentiment turns for this sub. $6650 was devastation a week ago
Yes and no. Any node with a full copy of the blockchain can in theory be called "a full node" because it's full. But the "nodes" considered to be proper network nodes (i.e. listed by all the indexing services) are not only full nodes, they are also listening ones, i.e. will not only make new connections but also accept them. A proper "full node" requires listening, i.e. be an actual server. Those 9000+ nodes listed as "network nodes" all listen/accept new connections and that's the core of the network.

Oh, ok. I know they've changed it because a lot of users were complaining.
My memory is that they reversed the trades and paid everyone back that lost money.  I find that ludicrous because there were no errors in the system, just noobs not understanding how the market works.
We think the same. That’s exactly what i said TA’s are ideas and nothing more. People take them as the obsolete truth which is wrong. Maybe shit post is not the correct term but here on this sub people consider anything that is not a graph a shit post
I dunno, someone did it previously [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/subreddit_stats/).
That's a good idea. I already messaged the mods but I think /u/jarederaj is asleep at this time and he's the most active. Hopefully they take care of it tomorrow. 
What am I looking at here?
I'm not "protecting" anyone, I'm posting the information so people can make their own determinations. Sorry you don't like it. 
[deleted]
Weaksauce that you'd give him the benefit of the doubt at this point in time, but to each their own.

Also, I'm not an asshole to pretty much everybody. Wtf? That's way off base. I'm assholes to people that deserve it. I'm nice and cordial to the majority of people here.
His story is basically the same as what he told me 5 - 6 months ago when I unbanned him.
> Does this mean that this is truly the only time that Arsonbunny did this?

Are you serious? I've shown that he's done this on numerous occasions with multiple accounts, most notably /u/missreal. Believe it or don't but don't act like he hasn't apparently done this extensively.

Also, he only "came clean" when mods showed up and called him out on his bullshit. You have respect for someone who "comes clean" after being backed into a corner? He's still lying about everything else.

>I am inclined to believe he's telling the truth, and that he's truly apologetic. And I respect people who can come clean and apologize, as I think we need more of that in today's world. Just wanted people to consider these points.

Unreal. So you think the rest of the allegations and evidence are moot? This guy is a scammer and you're shoveling his shit directly into your mouth.

Mods have sent all the appropriate info to admins, so we'll have to see what *they* say. One thing I can assure you is that /u/missreal is not *me*. So who else could it be? (hint: it's arsonbunny)

>Arsonbunny PM'd me the above after I found the deleted comments. I thanked him for coming clean and I was the one that suggested he post the confession and trust that most of the r/BitcoinMarkets community can be forgiving.

As I said, mods took this to the admins. When admins confirm the vote manipulation and sock puppetry, his account will either be suspended or mods will perma-ban him, I'm sure.
[deleted]
Then complain to the mods about it.

It's unreal that you think calling out scammers directly is somehow being "aggressive". You're just saying this because I've also called *you* out for shilling. It's not harassment, it's just an honest assessment. 
I am completely and utterly unsurprised, gypsy has a history of this and got banned a few months ago due to this behaviour. It seems he hasn’t learned anything. I’ve messaged the mods and asked them to take a look, hopefully they’ll deal with it one way or another. I haven’t even been here recently but think that the bickering doesn’t belong on the sub. 
So then why not simply wait for their response? Why the incessant posting about it? 

And no, I’m not arsonbunny’s sock, lol. Feel free to browse my profile if you’re suspicious. 
Thanks I'll use it. Head's spinning with possibilities now because I have an established rapport with several users here who are now lying about each other. Very confused

No, I said you are a covert shill. Sometimes, often times, you are.

No, I call out bullshit for what it is when I see it. Sorry you don't like it.

Agree to disagree.

I don't care.

Probably too much. You?
Really appreciate it. Struggling with objectivity on this issue. The whole thing is making me irrationally sad. Gypsy wasn't always this way and I keep hoping that I'm misunderstanding the situation.
https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7pgh7u/ive_made_over_500k_in_crypto_here_are_some_good/dshrmvz/

Whatever you say, arson.
Dude someone's lying and I don't know who. I'm very confused now. While I do agree you harass people, I've never really seen you *lie* about anything...so I'm confused.

Did you argue with hcoalter before? Through PM not comments? 
Stop lying. You were caught. Own up to it already.
What...? When?

Who is that? This is looking really weird now. 
I don't blame you. Many people were still giving him the benefit of the doubt, some still are for whatever reason. It's now several undeniable incidents just over the last day alone. It's also very likely that he gilded himself the other day for that comment (unless, did you?) and he's certainly gilded himself and bought his way to the top of r/cryptocurrency several times. Not to mention that even his hand wavy gibberish analysis was [debunked by one of our very own](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ronjo/daily_discussion_sunday_june_17_2018/e0u59eg/).

Guy is a schmuck through and through and mods are in the process of deliberating a perma-ban. Admins are well aware too.

That account should be suspended from reddit permanently, imo. All of his accounts should, obv. The extent to what he's doing is unknown, but I've already identified 10-15 accounts of his and that should be incredibly offensive to the sub, but some people don't seem to care or are still calling my credibility into question. Probably because they're also sock puppet accounts, to be honest, at least some of them. All these random accounts showing up in this sub at just the right time to defend and praise arson. Every time. People who've never posted on BM or haven't logged into reddit in over a year... Yeah... nothing fishy about that...
The chart I'm looking at seems to show Bitcoin went from 2.3k to 19k then back down to 6.5k. If you think segwit/LN are causing BTC's price to drop, how do explain it tripling in value since segwit activated?
Very good question actually, IDEX had a lot of troubles a month ago or so when a lot of alts pumped. They have centralized servers for their order books so that is the bottle neck, not the blockchain.

EOS will be very interesting together with atomic swaps to see how things go. Also stellarterms works nice
I only battle on one side. Lately has been ETH.
I'll chart both and since they are pretty much in sync i'll open the same position in ETH as i would do it in BTC.

Last week was golden, shorted pretty much ETH from 600 to 500...

"What ETH gives, ETH takes..."

I'm more upset because it was a rush decision made on the phone without checking for news or charting it correctly... Greed took over my bear bias and is in the process of kicking me in the groin...
My biggest profit-to-zero trade was almost 100% stack increase that I got shaken off at be just to see how it goes back up.

That bull run was crazy and shaking weak hands was more crazy ;)

Not saying you're doing anything wrong. Just saying that there are sometimes other options to consider.

Yesterday I was fighting with myself whole day to close that second short. Ended up closing at 6230 which I thought is stupid. Ended up very nice exit but lucky. It's a hard game.
It's a challenge "sitting on your hands"and not over trading this one, the market is very good at shaking you out. Short from 7500 on June is very good (mine only opened at 7400, and since I've been adding to it my average buy in is lower still). If I was short from 7500 with a large enough position I would just put in a market stop just before break even and try keep it until 5100 or contact roll over. Also a little envious that you have so much time to watch the markets, I don't have the time to do scalping longs
I know, but since 6100 was a good support i'm expecting the fight to be a bit higher and resetting the RSI because of that.

Before breaking 6100 i'm counting on it getting lower slowly, testing it and going a bit up, testing it some more and up again.

The 5800 - 6000 area matches also ETH's and LTC (not so sure here) support areas so it will be trickier to break on the first try.
Agreed, and in terms of tax laws you're absolutely right. Use as a currency doesn't make much sense in the US right now. 

As crazy at it sounds though, as a non-correlated/decoupled asset, it's totally usable as it is right now.
So how do u know it's nonsense?
I don't know which triangle you saw. Mine is drawn as it should be but it has only 2 touches on the wicks after pump.
couldn't agree with you more
It's just in general man, you can't say you genuinely feel bad for bagholders when the majority of your responses to bullish posts translate to 'I can't believe people are so stupid.'. How is that any different from being a reverse Stokinator or Bucky. 
Nope. Any node that performs full validation is a full node. It doesn't need to be listening. It doesn't need to store the blockchain. A non-listening pruned node is just as much a full node as a listening archival node.
What was ludicrous was that the system was setup that way even *after* a similar flash crash on LTC/BTC just weeks before. Coinbase has a fiscal responsibility as *choice architect* to help their customers make good decisions. No one argued that the system didn't work as intended. The argument was Coinbase setup a disastrously precarious system that didn't accurately reflect the market. 
If you ask people directly if their TA is certain to be fulfilled you'll be surprised by their answer. People will place enough faith in their TA to put their money where their mouth is, but they're losing money if they're not also managing their risk... which means they're skeptical of their own ideas.

I try to assume that I'll only be right about 30% of the time and work from there.
What's the deal?
Look! Another sock puppet!
lol okay not everybody but you're extremely belligerent a lot. Cmon, you know it. Arson isn't the first person you've followed around. 

And I'd just rather let mods figure it out than try to destroy someone's reputation over a screenshot that could have been faked. 

Admins can detect vote manipulation n shit.. it's not my job, I can't do thorough  enough analysis to make a conclusion. And I would rather not accuse someone who's potentially innocent. 
Do you believe him that it was a one time thing, or just that this was the one time he got caught?
> he is a Bitcoin cultist who wants to encourage FOMO in the newbs coming to this sub.

No, I'm definitely not and I've been short for quite some time. I'd be more than happy if the price dropped. 

>Apparently found this in my history, and is now trying to use this as an ad hominem.

No, someone else posted this. You've been caught lying so many times at this point, you have multiple people pointing it out. 

You're using sockpuppet accounts to upvote yourself and make comments supporting yourself, which is **exactly** what you did in the linked r/CC thread. 

You're a big phony and now there is ample evidence to prove it. Jigs up!

>Edit: And there he is below, again.

You tagged me, you idiot.
> It's not harassment, it's just an honest assessment.

You're basically the only person here who thinks this way.

But keep believing what you want.
I don't have a "history" of this. I have the history of *this* interaction and that's it, which was the whole point of this fucking post. I.e. Look everyone, what I said back was 100% and here's the proof. 

It's astonishing that you are defending him and criticizing me. He's the scumbag here. Just because I'm outspoken and blunt doesn't mean I'm wrong.
No, I don't actually think you are, but, as you can see elsewhere in this thread, I'm being attacked by sock puppets (so is Sloppy at this point). I'm being attacked, so I'm responding. Wasn't initially trying to turn this into big drama, just trying to let people know that these people are straight up liars and scammers. 

Also, it's vindicating, given that I had called out this behavior previously but didn't have a smoking gun. Now I have multiple.
Kinda sucks.  There was a time when I respected Gypsytoy and thought he was alright.  He's gone downhill fast in the last month.  I wonder if he's missing some meds or something.  I'm not even meaning that as an insult - it really seems like his personality has drastically shifted in the last 3-5 months.  Maybe I just didn't pay attention before though.
Stop, we know you're also /u/hcoalter  and /u/intellicheckidn. Stop scamming and lying. I hope all of your alt accounts get perma-banned. 

And stop attacking /u/sloppysynapses, he didn't do anything wrong. 
Always *what* way? This guy PM'd me from a sock puppet account, attacking and threatening me. What else is there to say? This is literally one of two accounts I'd called him out for in the past. Even Sloppy agrees with me now. This individual (who I won't name) is masquerading around multiple subs pretending to be multiple people and manipulating votes and comments. 

People can deride me however they see fit but everything I said is true and all the evidence I provided is real. It's amazing that he isn't already banished. 

edit: https://www.removeddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7pgh7u/ive_made_over_500k_in_crypto_here_are_some_good/dshrmvz/
I dont recall anything bad from gypsy. One of the names i pat attention to. #fakeredittdrama
Not that I can remember. As you can see from tag and karma, I seemed to agree with him at some point. I don't recognize the name otherwise. 99.99% sure never interacted with him PM. Certainly no "battles" and definitely not something that "proved [his] point" in regards to that post. *He* is lying. So is arsonbunny. Who knows, could be the same person or a group on discord or whoknowswhat. But it's not me. I'm just a person who likes memes and calling out bullshit. Accusing me of being MissReal is just fucking ridiculous, that everyone piled on top is highly suspicious. This is not organic. I'm peacing out if this is addressed by the mods though. It's either me or arsonbunny and his henchmen.
I take that back. Looks like we did [heated battle](https://imgur.com/a/D0RIfWK) at one point. 


You are just as much of a bully. 
I already did. Move along 
If you toned it down, you'd probably avoid the whole "credibility question."  There's nothing to be gained by being so intense.

Wasn't me, and at this point I'd probably believe he gilded himself.
Tether.
There's a lot of pressure to make these systems do more with less... I keep wondering if it's a practical application for a blockchain. It seems like implementing a proper bazaar on a network is just a better approach; You can exchange with whoever you can find who's trading in whatever way they want, and you collate those data yourself. Make that process secure and worry about block level settlement later... or hypothetically, never.

... like cash.
Also, centralized order books sounds like centralization. Isn't the whole point of an exchange the ability to manage the order books? On chain transactions are just the easiest (less than ) half of the problem.
Fighting with greed and finding best exit point. Those are the hardest things in trading. Needs a lot of exp and distance to master.
This was the first successful long scalp I've made since 9250-9800, which was arguably not a scalp haha. 

My position is decent size, but not as large as I'd like. Still, it's a very good entry. I'd like to get a good entry going on September, but I can't bring myself to short under 6500 again, and I slept through my chance overnight. 

There was a lot of bull euphoria after 6500 broke upwards, but we basically recovered 6% off a 35% drop, which is basically just a finger in the dike (don't make it weird). It didn't hold for long, either. If 6K falls and the double bottom meme falls with it...5100 sounds likely. 
You seem really confident we’ll be revisiting the low 6ks so why are you so skittish on placing a decent short from this 6500 level? 
I already explained above...it's boring to repeat oneself.
I could def agree there. Many people were sharing a line that crossed back to yesterday’s bounce to ~$6450, which seemed a bit forced if you ask me. However, it definitely still looks like a wedge if you ignore that PoC.
Why can't I simultaneously feel bad for people and think they make bad decisions?

I genuinely cringe and hurt inside when I see people long and buy the top. I can't tell or suggest they sell because 1. I could be wrong and 2. I hate giving explicit advice

I never called him "stupid", although I do think his investment strategy of FOMO is pretty silly especially when he pretends like it's based on fundamentals.
Don't be too smart with the nomenclature here. You exactly know my meaning here. A proper network node both listens and serves a full validated copy of the blockchain. Otherwise it cannot provide full network functionality, i.e. is not a true node. A non-listening node cannot serve the block info to lightweight clients since they cannot connect to it. A pruning node (listening or not) cannot serve the blockchain to synchronising clients since it doesn't have the full validated copy.
I try to read as much opinions as i can till i get this “gut feeling” about what’s going on in the market and form my own but I don’t consider the TA superior to any other written opinion. I also consider mine as just another opinion(aka shit post) 

:)

Edit: Also I’m sorry if I offended you or anyone
https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8qr0fd/new_york_times_university_of_texas_at_austin/e0opb9m/

This asshole is using **many** sockpuppets to deny that he's doing just that. And apparently he's been caught doing the same thing in rCryptoCurrency. Beyond that, there seems to be a separate set of sock puppets [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8qyvqh/daily_discussion_thursday_june_14_2018/e0orvzn/). 

I'm starting to think over half the accounts here are sock puppets and the same people using multiple accounts. 
> Arson isn't the first person you've followed around.

I'm not following him around. Seeing him post and knowing who he is and calling out his bullshit is not stalking. 

>And I'd just rather let mods figure it out than try to destroy someone's reputation over a screenshot that could have been faked.

Lol, fake screenshots. Yeah... who has a reputation for faking screenshots... Hmm..

People should be aware that this guy is pulling a fast one (and so are all these other accounts). These people go onto all crypto subs and spread misinformation and manipulate people. It's amazing that you still think I'm in the wrong here. 

>Admins can detect vote manipulation n shit..

Yeah, as they did with DushmanKush (mods thanked me for my service that time, let's see if they do this time).

>it's not my job,

Fair enough, but the evidence is overwhelming at this point. Beyond a smoking gun. Multiple smoking guns. Several accounts I can know tag and call out when I see them faking shit on other subs.

These people are the lowest possible scum.
Yeah you’ve done quite a lot of that yourself today (u/sloppysynapses)
E:spelling 
Seemed genuine but I have no idea. I abdicated my mod responsibility months ago and have not paid close attention to his account. I only ever saw the single instance of using an alt account personally. 
I don't think that's true. You can go back and look at the times I've outed you for shilling and the votes seem to indicate people agree with me.

Sorry that pisses you off.
Stop replying to me. Take this to the mods and stop spamming the comments. 
It is probably the loss from margin trading, that would do a number on anyone. 

Anyway thanks for the tool but if they delete comments it makes it kind of useless. :/ 
Lol, no meds, dude. I was [right](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7pgh7u/ive_made_over_500k_in_crypto_here_are_some_good/dshrmvz/).

Maybe you should rethink that whole storyline, eh? :)
[deleted]
You weren't always easy to upset. You were more centered, even a year ago. It's not that you're wrong about things... you're just letting people get under your skin more. I'm not sure if it's because you're being targeted and harassed, or if you just need a break, or both. My impression of you is that when you're at your best you don't get dragged into this drama and you just kill it at making reasonable arguments. You don't need this drama in your life. It's distracting you from what you're good at.

/u/sloppysynapses , what's your read on this?
Yes....speaking as my alter ego, hcoalter, I’m in love with you, Gypsytoy. You speak my language, for sure. 
Huh?! How??
You're a manipulator and sock puppet. 

Get banned.
Yeah it's a valid point.

I'm almost sure he did. It happened like 10 minutes into that post and nobody here gilds shit normally. Why would someone gild that of all things. 

If you sort his history by top, almost all of his top posts have 4-5x gold. He even gilded himself for a really stupid parody song he wrote here. It didn't even rhyme or make sense. 

Guy is a total fraud. Hopefully the mods take permanent action. That type of behavior is entirely unwelcome in just about any sub, forum or community. Imaging trying to pull that off in real life? You're be banished. Same should happen here.


One problem they solve is that no KYC and so on is needed since they do not do any trading, only telling where people want to trade.  Agree it's only half of the problem
I'm getting better at exit points, i'll sacrifice some profits by keeping tight stop losses that i'll move accordingly to the price movement.

But when i start to get comfortable trading, another soul crushing red trade comes along and puts me in place.

I could have exited at breakeven 2 hours ago, but since price was coming my way, why close in the red, just wait a bit more... And boom, there it goes deep into the red...

I better just put a stop loss and hope for no crazy wicks. This is a big position now and the potential for another BGD is big.
I don't like being underwater for long, specially when trading ETH. It's easier to manipulate and if BTC goes to test 7k (7.5%) ETH can easily go up 15% or more, and with 5X leverage is too much of a risk.

I rather cut my losses around 1% and try to open again at a better time. Otherwise i'll start moving stops a bit higher and higher since i'm already underwater and end up getting rekt... That has happened before so i'm trying to learn from my mistakes.
Lost 50% of my stack that way and the revenge trading after... I'm trying to slowly get back to breakeven so my tolerance for being underwater is very low. 
I saw that, it worked cause the proper way was very close to that cross. Doesn't matter if the line if $25 higher or not, support was important here.
I'm not saying you can't, I'm just saying that you may be unintentionally giving off a vibe with your comments that make others feel like they're being attacked. You could definitely word things a bit better to avoid any misunderstandings, just my two cents. 


Or making this a technical argument since I am already tired how silly stubborn you guys get: 

A Bitcoin node advertises their capabilities with nService bitmap. Full nodes (non-pruning) signal NODE_NETWORK if the node is full, and hence can be a bootstrap node providing full sync. Pruning nodes don't. So this is even *hardcoded*, as you can see, what is actually considered a network node and what is not. Pruning nodes *are not* true network nodes.
Ad-hoc source: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/60232

All node indexers discard non-listening nodes, again, for example the indexers listed above, https://coin.dance/nodes and/or https://bitnodes.earn.com. Sources, check their rules for qualifying full network nodes for the index, and why it is so.




No worries. Everyone has to work through understanding the perspectives of others.
> I don't think that's true. You can go back and look *at <random nonspecific time that can't be proven or disproven>*

Right, we should definitely not look at this specific thread where you've been downvoted very heavily.  Definitely not.  And also don't count the comments you deleted after they hit -10 or more.

Me getting downvoted here is no surprise, I don't know why you think you're some sort of wizard.  I'm bearish and I believe Ethereum has a stronger fundamental value.  That's going to be unpopular here, period.  Despite that I still have positive karma in this sub.  You think me getting downvoted and negative responses to me getting upvoted is some sort of magic?

Yeah, definitely don't want to compare those <random nonspecific times that can't be proven or disproven> against this thread, right here, today.
Lol, I'm not spamming the comments, I'm responding to a comment *about me*. 

If you have a problem with that, then *you* take it to mods, buddy.
Yep.  Would be cool if they tied it to removeddit or snew.github.io or something.  /u/Contrarian__ do you still work on this project at all?  Great work btw!
Dude, this has nothing to do with that. I'm well on my way to my old stack anyhow. 

This personal attack is really pretty old at this point.
> Maybe you should rethink that whole storyline, eh? :)

No.  Your behavior stands on its own as plenty bad.  Both people can be wrong in a dispute.  I don't recall reading anything aggressive/offensive/bad from arsonbunny despite this find of yours.  I once said the same of you and defended you.  You need to seriously chill out.
Lol, classic tactic. Keep deflecting, scammer.
Who are you?! Wtf are all these accounts 
/u/gypsytoy you already know I agree with Jared on this, I still think you could get your points across way more effectively if you just simply slowed down and assumed people weren't acting in bad faith a lot. I know I tend to give people the benefit of the doubt far too often but I think there's some use in it - if you simply didn't assume people were acting in bad faith when they disagree with you, I think interactions between you and others would go significantly smoother.

For me and you personally things have gone better since you've pretty much accepted that I mean well and have never intended on being malicious or anything. 

But that's kind of aside from this whole arson thing- while I do think some of the stuff surrounding him is fishy/suspicious, I think  you could handle it all a little better just by not getting riled up so quickly. I know you're a very passionate person, but I think a lot of the time your intensity comes off too strong and it detracts from having meaningful discussion.

i'm sure you already know that, though
I didn't solicit that message, I was just pointing out that OP was peddling nonsense. I hadn't even interacted with this guy in quite some time before yesterday. 

My cake day coincided with great vindication, so I'm pretty happy about that I guess. It's still amazing that this guy seems to be slipping through the cracks even now. Where the justice? Is it really consider okay to conduct oneself this way? Maybe the sub needs to amend its constitution a bit to include bad faith efforts to mislead people (beyond the scope of shilling).

I'm just doing a public service by pointing this out. I think /u/sloppysynapses agrees at this point that "*something*" fishy is going on, though he is far more likely to take people at their word, even in a crazy fucked up place like this (meaning crypto in general).
I agree that manipulating posts with alts should be banned.  I thought if he was doing it, he would stop after you called him out and I found the comment itself.  Then the problem would have solved itself.  I guess I was wrong. :/
That KYC thing is going to come back and bite them. I've been advising people stay away from these decentralized exchanges. They're playing fast and loose with the law.

If this stuff with Facebook being responsible for the information people get sets legal precedent then these decentralized exchanges are going to get wiped out within weeks or days of the ruling. If they're based on what's currently possible then the finger is going to be pointed squarely at them.

It needs to get to the point where a decentralized exchange is similar in nature to installing OpenPGP and launching Thunderbird with an enigmail like plugin that connects your mail client to everyone else.
It's a hard choppy market. Your strategy will work until we go into bull run.

I could've exited at 6.35 today, thought ok, I'll wait a moment, need to do something... Exited at 6.55 and instead of 10% I got 2%.

Until market is choppy it's better to scalp. Until you trade USD you don't have to worry about it dropping.
Learning the hard way will do that. Makes sense though, thanks. 
I just don't want people to get all hyped up again just to be disappointed. The euphoria people feel upon going up is equal to the misery people feel at the bottom. So I don't get why people get so prematurely excited

Oh well, I guess we'll see what happens. 
"full node" refers to the amount of validation performed, nothing else
> And also don't count the comments you deleted after they hit -10 or more.

I've never done this. I don't care about my comments or reputation or anything else. I just care about the truth and representing oneself honestly. Shilling and scamming piss me off to no end.

>I'm bearish and I believe Ethereum has a stronger fundamental value.

This is not what I'm referring to. I'm referring to when you're covert shilling, not just stating your opinion.

>Yeah, definitely don't want to compare those <random nonspecific times that can't be proven or disproven> against this thread, right here, today.

No, I don't really want to compare anything. I would rather just let bygones be bygones and move on. But whatever. 
Thanks. I haven't touched it in a while, but I still have the code (it's fairly simple Python running on AWS Lambda). I have no problem open sourcing it if someone wants to take it and improve it. I'm not familiar with removeddit or snew, but if they have straightforward APIs, it probably wouldn't be *too* much work.

I designed it to be highly *specific* at the expense of being fairly *non-sensitive*. That is, it will be much more likely to give a false negative than a false positive. The main limitations are that both users must be fairly active and current. It won't work on consecutive sockpuppets, nor will it work with users who post less than about 3 times per day.

Anyway, good luck!

cc: /u/SloppySynapses 
You didn't defend me. You defended the rBTC mods. 

Also, arsonbunny is all these other accounts he's posting under, many of which are making false claims of their own, name calling and manipulating the sub.

You're crazy if you don't see that as problematic. This guy should've been banned 3 months ago.
Who tf are all these accounts. 
[deleted]
This is consistent with my read on the situation.

We really want you, /u/gypsytoy , to thrive and do well. We're just concerned that you're engaging in some behaviour that isn't good for anyone, especially you.
I wholeheartedly disagree. I don't know how else I'm supposed to get the point across that this sub is overrun with bots, astroturfers or something along those lines. The sub should be outraged at this but people here don't understand what housekeeping is, **plus** there is vote and comment manipulation.

I think /u/jarederaj was more-so interested in hearing your thoughts on /u/hcoalter and her ridiculous comments, as well as all the other "fishy/suspicious" activity (understatement of the year). Jared is aware I'm an asshole, what we're trying to figure out is how many fake users have overrun this sub. *You* might not care about this but I think the both of us do.
Still trying to grok all this. Haven't come to any conclusions.
Well I see it as if you ask me where to buy cocaine and I say "ask the guy with the red hat", I do not commit a crime since it's only information  exchange

But sure, the SEC or whatever my make another judgement :D 

And also the first steps is better to be half decentralized than waiting for the "perfect" solution imo
The hard way is the best way...

Unless it hurts you don't give it enough importance and keep repeating the same mistakes.
If that was the case it would be called "irrelevant node". Your "full nodes" are nothing more than desktop clients, they validate nothing since they don't create blocks.

Validation is via block creation, nothing else.

Your constant misinformation aimed at switching fees from miners to your pockets (Lightning Network) is tiring.
> I would rather just let bygones be bygones and move on.

I'm 100% for this.  Can you actually do it?
> You didn't defend me. You defended the rBTC mods.

I did until I knew exactly what you did to get banned.

And before that I defended you to some other people.
I call them the ArsonArmy.
So you're hcoalter...? Because I've never had a private conversation with you. 
e: yea i did 3 months ago my bad 
What? Didn't I just provide you with ample evidence of all this via PM? You guys are chastising me instead of giving me a Pulitzer? This is unreal, I'm basically doing the legwork that mods should be doing. A thanks would be more in order.
I don't think you're an asshole. This whole conflict bothers me deeply, though.

I do listen to you, but I want you to communicate in a way that lets other people listen to you too.
https://www.reddit.com/user/imwithniners

https://www.reddit.com/user/intellicheckidn

Looks like admins banned them. 

Hcoalter hasn't been suspended from reddit like those two, but she was banned from bitcoinmarkets 
I'm still very confused personally. I think gypsy means well but it's possible he's looking too far into it. It's all very confusing though. I'm torn between being paranoid and trying to just assume life is simple and people wouldn't be crazy enough to make 8 accounts and sock puppet this sub. But the latter is probably much more likely, unfortunately 

Regardless, I reported it to the admins so they could at least look into vote manipulation/sock puppet accounts. We'll see what they say
That's what MtGox said.

:p
Disgusting disinformation scammer.
Shoo troll, you have no idea what you're talking about.
Yep, I have no beef with you. Certainly any gripe I had/have with you is nothing in comparison to the egregious offenses detailed above. I have no issue forgetting our past differences and moving on.

That doesn't mean I won't be critical of shilling if I see it though. But I will use more tact and decrease my sensitivity to it.

 
Fair enough. I still don't think I should've been banned but that's another story. BTW, I got banned from /r/BitcoinCash too. For no reason other than I was banned at /r/BTC and /u/bitcoinistehfuture said I was inciting violence. Lol! Free expression for the win!
[deleted]
It's just a little constructive criticism. We don't think you did anything overly wrong, here. We just want you to find a better way to handle conflict like this. 
Only one side is encouraging you to take this to the admins. The other side is discouraging you from doing that. Which side is right? Hmmm.
Yeah, that's good that those were banned but how about Mr. Phony himself? And hcoalter? Awaiting more info from mods.
I've already deleted a bunch...dude I'm just confused man I don't even know what's going on. 
That's fine and fair enough but don't equivocate. One party here has crossed a red line, at least in my view.
I'll chime in, you're combative. I assume that's because you're passionate, because you care about this sub. I think that's great but tone down the aggression and people will be more apt to heed your advice instead of taking it with skepticism.
