[Daily Discussion] Thursday, July 12, 2018 -- TITLE
#New post: [\[Daily Discussion\] Friday, July 13, 2018 →](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ygs6s/daily_discussion_friday_july_13_2018/)
Aside from the recent price action, there’s a genuine need to address key factual errors now circulating around the CBOE applying for a Bitcoin ETF.  Above all else is the fact that the product in question is not – technically – an ETF structure rather a Trust (only slightly different than GBTC).

The distinction between an ETF and a Trust is critically important. The former is where price impacting volume and demand would originate. The same does hold for the latter, just nowhere near the same level of amplification as an ETF. What the Trust does provide, and a point not to be downplayed, is a much clearer signal of the intentions of accredited investors and sell side trading desks. 

What I would like to advise is that those of you looking for actual information on the product in question read through the Notice itself:

[https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/cboebzx/2018/34-83520.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/cboebzx/2018/34-83520.pdf)

What should be addressed at this time are the following three, inter-related, points all gleamed, and referenced, from the above-linked Notice. 

First, on page 3, it states that the product will be physically backed – not a synthetic product – meaning that the Trust (again, not an ETF) will be backed by BTC and not derivatives. 

Second, on page 4, is a statement that “the Trust intends to achieve this objective by investing substantially all of its assets in Bitcoin traded primarily in the over-the-counter (OTC) markets”. 

Third – although worded enigmatically – on page 10 “the Sponsor estimates that the US dollar OTC Bitcoin trading volume globally represents on average approximately fifty percent of the trading volume of Bitcoin traded globally in US dollar on US dollar denominated Bitcoin exchanges.” 

As always, I’m aware that this is a trading sub. The commentary and points above may be of very little value to many of you here. That said, it remains my personal opinion that since April we have been witnessing a period of aggressive price discovery by parties (however defined) unfamiliar with the entire crypto ecosystem. Given typical seasonality (summer holidays), I expect that we will remain relatively trade bound until September. 
So, it's been 7 months of bear market. We've had violent drops, V bottoms, double bottoms, double tops, capitulation and people completely giving up and leaving the market.

After all of this, we haven't made it much lower than 6k (give or take 10%). Every time we hit 6k since February, I've thought "this time it won't hold, and once it breaks, it'll be a long time before we see it again". And yet here we are in July, sitting at 6200. 

A quick glance at the chart confirms that this downtrend just doesn't have the same vigor it used to. It's flattening out. Volatility is decreasing, volume is shit, and it seems all that's left are the untouchable holders, degen gamblers, and whales to fuck them over.  It reminds me of the slow painful grind at $200, where every drop felt like the end, but we never spent long below it. 

This is not TA at all, I know that. It's gut feeling and emotion. But if this isn't the bottom, what's it going to take to bust lower? Who's going to panic sell? Just the longs? 

My opinion is that if we haven't seen the bottom, we've seen close enough. Keep your leverage low, buy spot, and forget. We might not to up for a while, but up seems like the safer bet than down.
You know the market is bad when tether has broken into the top 10
Losing hope here.  Every time we start to see some bullish movement, such as a pump to 6800, we get rejected and dumped back down.  Makes me feel like I should sell after every pump because it's been coming back down every time.  But I don't want to miss out if it goes parabolic.....

[2014 vs 2018 comparison](https://i.imgur.com/JQyo22y.png)

A lot of people have been saying the current bear market looks like 2014 but at an accelerated pace.  I thought it would be interesting to see what it would look like if you scale the current market and compare it.

[200% scaled](https://i.imgur.com/WTuzXHL.png)

[250% scaled](https://i.imgur.com/8EP6Mot.png)

Doesn't really mean anything but interesting to look at the similarities.

Wake me up when... well I don't even know. Maybe when price action is just fun again.
I'm curious... why do some people put so much value on "the daily closing in the red/green" when it's a 24/7/365 open trading market?

Who cares about the daily colours on any graph when all potential investors are constantly going to sleep and waking up and every second of every day?
!long XBTUSD 10X 6076 &#37;100
!long xbtusd 6130 3x 20%

Going for a small long. This dump as lost a lot of steam. Here's the bull divs I'm looking at: https://www.tradingview.com/x/2KexvdLU/

Edit: Sweet Jesus, got that order in 10 second before the jump...
Thats my girl.
If I hear bull div or ihs one more time.... 
Figure I'll start publishing my analysis here from TradingView.

Bull Scenario   
\- The Inverted Head and Shoulder plays out and we get a push to $6450.   
\- A test of the previous support now resistance levels at $6200 and $6400 will be the areas to watch.   
\- That being said, $6800 saw HUGE resistance and will be my target for a long should [**BTC** **-3.17\%**](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/) move up. (I'll adjust as necessary)   
\- [RSI](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/relativestrengthindex/) is showing hidden [bullish divergence](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/bullishdivergence/) on the shorter time frames with [**BTC** **-3.17\%**](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/) in oversold conditions. A move up is possible!   


Bear Scenario   
\- [**BTC** **-3.17\%**](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/) tests $6100 and breaks past.   
\- If it does this we will test that $5800 zone again.   
\- [RSI](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/relativestrengthindex/) is still hovering around 40 on the Daily so it still has room to move down.   


What I'm doing   
\- I closed my shorts for a profit.  
\- Currently I'm waiting to see if this Inverted [H&S](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/headandshoulders/) does play out.   
\- I plan on reassessing tonight around midnight PST since the Asian market tends to pick up between 1-3am PST and try to see what the charts say.   
\- The bottom, [**imo** **1.11\%**](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/AMEX-IMO/) , is still between $5-5.5k.   
\- Not opening a short until it breaks $6100. (Estimate)  
\- Not opening a long unless we break $6200. (Estimate)  


News   
\- Biggest news to come out is more info on the [**Bitcoin** **-3.17\%**](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/) [ETF](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/etf/) by the [**CBOE** **0.96\%**](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-CBOE/) .   
\- SEC will give a decision on it August 10th (I've read conflicting dates but this one is mentioned the most.)   
\- [Volatility](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/volatility/) has dropped a lot over the last few months as we've been grinding down and I think we are getting close to the bottom.
Man I'm glad I stopped trading this. At this point it's a coinflip in my opinion.

Just gonna let it ride, wherever the fuck it goes. Took my profits early enough to be comfortable holding.
Soooo... yesterday's short hit my take-profit, and I'm currently out of trade again.

I'll likely position myself in a long if price were to drop here to ~$6k which intersects with the $10k trend line support.  If this is breached however, the last real support/bounce is prev low at $5750.  Any move below this is a short with targets at $4.9k - $4.4k range within 2-4 weeks.

In the immediate term, 4hr RSI is staged for a pump and so I'd be careful shorting here.

[Chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/csxrsLHq/)

Medium term I remain bearish.  It's hard to ignore the [ominous 1M MacD cross](https://www.tradingview.com/x/WsElYgNF/) which is suggesting a heavy/accelerated bleed in coming months.  

Safe trades.
It's gonna have to get over 6400 to make me a believer. Cool bounce though, hope it goes higher as none of my offers got filled.

Probably means more short term down, but im seeing bear market over by the end of the summer.
Closed my short from $6,320 at $6,160. 

Not my biggest win in history, but a win nonetheless. 

I'm watching the possible Inverse H&S, just as many others in this sub are. 

Do I think it will play out? No, ultimately I do not. However, there isn't much reward for continuing to hold a short with the breakdown point just about 1% below current price. 

If sellers break through $6,000, I'll hop back into a short. If buyers make another yolo pump back up into the high $6,000s, I'll be perplexed and will reassess my bearish outlook. 

!short xbtusd close 6160

EDIT: Changed "neckline" to "breakdown point"
Deleting Blockfolio.
Never again will I open a position without stops. It makes it that much easier to get married to your position. 

I still think I'll get another opportunity to close my long from 6.5k in profit or at breakeven, but I will still have missed out on some pretty big moves, which I might otherwise have got on the right side of.
It's the first time in July that I am somewhat bullish, at least short term. Declining wedge on the 4H chart might take us a little higher. Not convinced that we'll go past 6500 just yet though.

Edit: after further inspection, this rally rhymes almost exactly with the April-May rally, after which it broke out of the wedge but subsequently rolled over. It didn't even reach the previous high. Still closed my short, though.
there might be short lived wick to 6300 just like during the end of june
What do people use now that https://www.bfxdata.com is down?
Okay mah boyos, the bottom is in !  https://twitter.com/CNBCFuturesNow/status/1017458654847565824 

https://twitter.com/econoar/status/1017460971860684800
We've been stuck in the $6ks for a bit more than month now 😳
Moving stops for my [short](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8xwe54/daily_discussion_wednesday_july_11_2018/e27bl8w/) to above 6.3 just to get out close to BE in case this reverses hard.

Stops on my hedge still above 6.4
Since there are quite a few posts talking about the importance of holding the longterm uptrend line (if we drop that far) and speculating on the effect an ETF might have on reversing this bear market, I thought I'd share my current "macro map":

[https://imgur.com/a/PhPmdIp](https://imgur.com/a/PhPmdIp)

Purple line is the longterm uptrend. If it gets violated there's one last chance at the lower horizontal support line (in green).

Yellow lines are the ones to watch for a big bull break.

100/200 EMAs are the ones to watch for reliable confirmation of trend continuation or sustained reversal.
Yesterday I bought back in with 30% of my budget at around 6350, after being 100% fiat for a while.

Luckily I had a tight stop loss which triggered while I was sleeping.

Nonetheless, I'll do it again. Going in with around 30% now. Just to hedge for the possibility that it's going up from here.

In these times I'm done with doing 100% this or that...

I have a stop loss at 5900 this time. If we go there we are back inside the old downtrend. Then all bets are off.
140 BTC buy wall got sold into in a second wtf. Selling the BTC i bought at 6215 at 6235 im too sketched out. If it pumps higher and i lose some of my BTC profits i'll probably buy back in $6350 or something.

Did i even gain anything lol. like $17 gains because of fees wtf.
Is anyone else here looking for a position they could sit on for years? My metric on going long on a true position waiting for volatility to become really tight. Yeah, I'll miss the absolute bottom but the position should be safer than just guessing.
Impressive very impressive
Been all in since 6150 just before that little drop, going to still hold it with a stop below 6000. Worked very well for me last time.

Also a great time to pick up alts, they got rekt recently.
4 HR Ichi crossed, fell through it's cloud and retraced within $20 to the bottom of the cloud for an entry. So 4 HR ichi indicates a short trade here with stop loses 6450(base line) or top of the cloud
Lol. Called every bit of it. 

Ez market is EZ 

This was posted basically a week ago. Just press play. https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSDT/gENKt4Tg-Dump-it/
now that's a bounce, clear out the stoplosses at 6100 and then make them chase a pump
Some of you guys that went long between 6k-6.1k with leverage are sociopaths. But you're "in the money" sociopaths. Congrats! 
IH&S broke down and all the hopes...
[Black line. ](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Hjz3wRBU/) Not much else needs to be said if you take as wide of a market view as I do.
noone is selling or buying 

who'll blink first 
https://predictions.global/

Who's planning to trade prediction markets as a BTC or ETH price derivative?

Prediction markets in general?

There's already 'synthetic options' markets on AMZN, S&P500 etc.

Great time to be alive & present. The elegance of a trustless back end contract.
Cannot believe $6,200 broke. I believe if this candle closes under $6,200 (meaning that the support is not retaken ASAP) we will be sub 6K within 24H and well on our way to retesting $5,800. For more context, the $6,400 support was broken, then became a resistance. On the hourly $6,400 was touched (wicked or almost wicked) ~6 times and didn't yield. $6,200 proved to be a weaker support than I would have imagined. 6K is simply a psychological support. $5,800 looks like a critical last support before the ~$5,300 long term ascending support from 7/17/2017. We are also now once again below the 20D MA, which has historically acted as a solid resistance on the 1D. Wow. 


Edit: Bullish flair removed. Context added.

Everyone expects 5800.  
Am I being alone and unreasonable to expect 5500?

Edit: for this week or two
I am enjoying this.

Am I a freak?
https://www.cryptoninjas.net/2018/07/12/abra-enables-visa-and-mastercard-option-to-buy-bitcoin/

UPD: in case you don't get it. Now anyone anywhere on earth except a few countries (listed here: https://www.simplex.com/kb/does-simplex-support-all-countries/) can buy bitcoin with their debit/credit card, up to 20k in one purchase. Let that sink in.
I just listened to Tom Lee's presentation on the macro trend implications of cryptocurrencies (bitcoin in particular), and found it very fascinating. He points out trends and emerging markets within the context of each of the past four generations and how each generation seems to drive certain markets sky-high.  

It certainly provided a lot of hopium, not that I really need any more as a long-term permabull. He makes it seem like 100k and beyond is not only mildly warranted hope, but actually logical. Idk, I'd recommend it.

Not sure I can link Youtube stuff, but "Thomas Lee Presents The Economics of Cryptocurrencies | Upfront Summit 2018" is the title.

Cheers.
With the somewhat weak, but extended, relief rally we just saw fail at 6800, a higher low / same low would actually paint a pretty bullish looking short term chart and would start to look more like a transition to reversal if it could range around here for a while. 

With the main high volume nodes below us still intact there aren't many pressured sellers now, and there may actually be more buyers left of the ragtag degenerates above 5k. Is that the kind of shift that can lead to a reversal?
[Oh hey thanks!](https://imgur.com/a/4f0FnD5) 

Woke up to this. Fell asleep with a buy at 6307 and forgot to put stops. Might as well let it ride and bail if we break 6k.  

Sorry for the shitpost, needed to vent. 
If the bleeding some how stops here, it would be a perfectly painted inverse H&S so there is still hope. Personally, I have buys in the $5500 range because that would be 20% correction from $6800. 20% because that’s how much our last two relief rallies fell before going back up a bit.
Closing my short from $6.5. 

I don't know the command on position bot but I'm taking a profit here. 

RSI on the Daily is currently at 40 so it still has room to go down imo but I'm hoping for a quick bump up before going down again. 

Reassessing the price action later in the day. Waiting until the 1pm and 1am PST. (These times tend to see some movement)
!short btcusd close 6100

Was hoping this would happen. Like others were saying, I don't think we break 6k just yet. I was just a bit more risky waiting for a failed breakdown to close.

Still think we could wick lower yet but I'm done babysitting for now.
Bitstamp 3D SAR now has four bullish ticks. 

edit: Removed fluff
Coinbase "Pro" is starting to piss me off. Received an alert when the price broke 6200 and when I went to move my stops down Coinbase processed it as a market buy for some reason. I had to do a double take to make sure I clicked on Stop and I did. Weird. Hoping a DCB will help recover the lost money on fees from the market buy before the next leg down. Frustrating.
From today's report. Seems pretty chill today imo.

BTC Macro:    3 day showing StochRSI crossover and possibly headed down, red candle without volume backing it up yet.  Still waiting to see if the inverted H&S completes because until it finishes it's not really anything.   Realistically looking to visit or breakout of 6900 by the end of the month or take another revisit down to 5800.  

BTC Local:  12 hours showing pretty heavily oversold RSI & MACD is definitely primed for a turn over
volume was meaningful on last 12 hours candle could easily see this going either way. 

Charts for these commentaries are in the daily report.  
There's also a link for making comments on the ETF as it's been opened up to public comments.  
https://steemit.com/crypto-news/@jcharming/the-daily-dimes-a-cryptonews-publish-07-12-18
Exactly why would anyone be selling at this point is beyond me. Too much risk. I'd rather hodl through 5k and 4k. I would only exit my long at a loss, but not sell. It seems to me, the only people selling are the whales trying to get as many longs as possible, but this isn't sustainable for them unless everyone else follows through.
> drops 700 in a week

/r/bitcoinmarkets be like "3 indicators this is bullish and why you should long btc"
$400 away from pretty much 0 longs in profit and we freefall. It'll be a 9 month low.
Flipping to weekly tf and zooming out shows me we're arriving at a fairly important juncture.

1. We'll know very soon if the equilibrium pattern is going to hold (suggesting a possible move up to $7.9K+ territory)
2. The 100EMA (blue line) is a big support at the \~$5.7K region. Breaking the equilibrium pattern would also mean violating this support. If that happens, next major stop could plausibly be sub $4K. The last time BTC fell through the 100EMA on the weekly was Dec 2014 (and it crossed back over 10 months later in Oct 2015).

Chart here: [https://imgur.com/a/q3rhC9R](https://imgur.com/a/q3rhC9R)

Edit: just for extra fear (sorry!) there have only been two instances since Dec 2017 where a red weekly candle close hasn't been followed by another red week. I know we've still got a few days left for current candle but bulls really need to start pushing now.
It's been 7 hours of slow downward grind in this little bear flag. Dump already!? :P Or am I gonna have to bail on my little short from 6250 here?

Edit: Aaaaand right as I submitted that it dropped. Haha.

Edit 2: Or not....

Edit 3: Or maybe?... Haha
[I may have closed my short prematurely](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8y6i8u/daily_discussion_thursday_july_12_2018/e28pk3u/)

Ahhh.. I was wrong /u/SloppySynapses, /u/dreamsfollower

The worst thing about closing a position prematurely is that it's very hard to re-enter
This is impossible to trade. Every time I open a long the price immediately starts to plummet. Then opening a short, the price starts to shoot back up again.

Why the bears are so salty already? It’s like every bear comment today is full with salty sarcasm or dissing people with hope. At least wait for a squeeze before you pour your salt all over the daily
I was very bearish a few weeks ago when the meme triangle broke down and I was calling for 4700 to be the bottom. However, I am not so sure anymore. The volume is terrible, volatility is low. People are freaking out over a 3% drop. The sentiment is really bad as well. I'm sure a lot of people cannot even imagine a bull run at this point given the low volume BGDs we've been seeing. I think 4.7k was definitely possible if we could have retraced to 7.5k or more during that last bullish runup but it didn't happen. I think if we haven't reached the bottom already, we're close. The other scenario is that this bear market will last for over a year, perhaps two years and going under 4k but I don't see that happening given clear interest signaled by institutions. There might be one final wick down to 5500-5200 before a potential reversal and sideways for months. People are downplaying the importance of a potential CBOE ETF or completely ignoring it just like they did when there were talks..just talks of a potential futures back in June-July last year. I don't see the market going parabolic because of the news and confirmation of the CBOE ETF or another ETF, too many people have lost money and the sentiment remains poor. The market will live in the shadow of December for quite some time but I think at the very least it'll start a new sideways and potentially bull biased trend leading up for parabolic movement for 2019-2020.
Londoners woke up pissed after yesterday steal, obviously they gonna dump all coins before the morning tea
We could be expecting a small bounce which could continue forming the [IH&S](https://www.tradingview.com/x/2buS3Gwy)  but ultimatly since were in a downtrend on the dark side of the moon i believe that we will get a fakeout then dump down hard. The [small falling wedge](https://www.tradingview.com/x/8yzmFage) which can in coop with the support from the right shoulder level incite a bounce, and try to climb above the rising wedge support.

The other scenario which could happen is that we dont form the IH&S but continue down to battle the 6K support or as low as the low 5Ks. I will stay out of postition until a convincing break below 6K or a breakout above 6.7K or until i feel like doing another gamblig high risk trade, but until then im gonna explore something other than the pixels on my screen.

!Short BTCUSD close 6170

Good luck getting rekt!
Observation:

* 1W PSAR is pointing downwards for 26 consecutive weeks.

* This happened only once in BTC's history, when 1W PSAR downtrend was intact for the same time span from 04/13 to 09/13.
* I expect us to set a new record here (almost set in stone).

FYI: I'm bearish in the short term and neither bullish nor bearish in the mid term. I think we are in the process of finding a (the?) bottom hence why I use this market phase to accumulate. For anybody who remembers endless and unnerving ranging between $200 and $250 with some wicks to the up/downside knows what I am talking about. As of now I think boundaries are set at $5.5k and $6.8k this time.
Morning dump came a few hours later than expected 
Stops triggered over night. !short xbtusd 6250 1x 100%

Last bit of cloud support that we had (4-6H Kumo + 6H Kijun) broke down at this level.
Somewhat small descending wedge in the making if bears don't take the price down further

[https://imgur.com/9P6JS7N](https://imgur.com/9P6JS7N)

Edit: We're currently testing the support of the wedge. If the support falls, things could get really ugly. Falling wedges are only bullish if they break up, they're very bearish if they break down. 
Wex.nz just removed the fiat withdrawal (and almost all deposit) options ([before](https://archive.fo/T9ta8) - [after](https://archive.fo/03MH8)). In 5 mins they will have a 2h maintenance. Maybe we will see some full switch to USDT since BTC/USDT was added just yesterday. In theory, the fiat options might also just be added back after maintenance.

Not looking great for Wex.nz, but I assume not many traders still use them.
Stopped out on my long overnight (and went short with the same stop) at \~6.27k. A forming iH&S isn't any reason to go long and I see no significant divergences thus far. One thing still making me uncomfortable is the long:short ratio; I fully expect that to continue decreasing a little bit before more relief (not expecting shorts to reach ATH again for another squeeze or anything - just think longs are still overextended).

Seems like that daily bull div has certainly completely played out by now. Overall, while I could have closed both my longs (including the recent loss) at 6.8k I'm not too upset with the results. Wasn't chart watching during any wicks up there due to a vacation, and I felt like there was still some upside left so I felt comfortable letting it ride a little. Still overall up on my last three trades despite the recent loss.
**!long XBTUSD close 6171**

Want to find a better entry.

What's wrong with the above? Positionbot dosen't like it.
Could hear a pin drop in here..
FWIW, XBT, WAN, XMR, XLM, XRP,  BTG, ADA, AION, ARK, ICX, LTC, OMG are all on TD buy 9 on the weekly chart. If we're going to see a global bounce, it's going to happen Monday when the current weekly candle closes.

If we continue to sink hard after Monday, we'll likely be working on a TD buy countdown which means at least 13 (!) more weeks of downward price action.
Where do you people see this bottomming if we have a multi year bear market? Is 1-2k possible? 
In b4 this pumps to $6800 and inverse head and shoulders holds true 
Why is it that when the market is going down bulls just get despondent and depressed and when bears are wrong they just get salty and angry?
COME TO PAPA 

5995 long 100k chips .. 

3600 to break me. don't sweat the swap.
I am so pissed I missed my chances to close this position below 6K.
Well, I think we will eventually drop further down but for now it will be extremely hard for me to stomach another bounce.

!short xbtusd close 6170

New local low at $6115 since the 1 to 2 week uptrend and still cant break $6200. Not looking good for bulls. If $6115 was cheap enough for whales surely we should have a big greend dildo right now at least breaking $6200.

Who knows it might show up an hour or so from now but i doubt it.

EDIT: New low at i dont know how far.... it just started but $6115 broke lol
We're on the way to meet an old friend again.

I'm predicting sideways action until the effects of the trade war and monetary policies are felt. Right now there's no new money coming into bitcoin, so until some news happens we're stuck between 58-6800.  

One thing I'm keeping an eye on is emerging markets. All sort of currencies around the world are suffering right now. We know from localbitcoins Venezuela volumes that when hyperinflation takes over people will turn to bitcoin. See here https://coin.dance/volume/localbitcoins/VEF. The turkish Lira is in free fall right now, as well as the argentine peso. The Brazilian real is looking rough as well. If inflation starts running out of control in these countries, people will start buying bitcoin. The barrier to entry is so much lower than anything else for a poor person. 

The federal reserve is also going to RAISE interest rates. This is death for emerging markets that have a shit load of US denominated debt. This means they're going to have to pay even more in interest against currencies that are under a ton of pressure right now. 
In case you were wondering about the effect of the FIFA world cup on the stock market (and if you were to assume that a similar thing occurs for cryptocurrencies) there is some evidence that it has a depressing effect on the market:

Who would have thought?
I've noticed that the past few months that the last bullish reason people are hoping for is "ETF being approved". A lot of people are asking about "What if" and "What will the price be after ETF approval"? However, I think we should ask ourselves, "What if ETF gets denied?"; this might be the final straw that will take us down to actual lows. What other thing is there for hope if it gets denied?  I remember when the Twins ETF got denied; there was an extremely sharp drop, then "recovery" (within same day - 3 days) and then the bleeding happened for a long time if I can remember clearly.  

If somehow, ETF does actually get approved, then I'm expecting it to turn bullish almost instantly. 
Closing my positions. Been watching for a good place to close since we broke below 6.2. the move from 6.8 isn't exactly bullish but this should bounce somewhere and we have a lot of support above 6k. Need to agree with chew here, better r/r is long here with Target in higher 6k.

Fucking London... Didnt get a dump yesterday so we get it today. if this hourly closes below my block im closing the rest of my futures long. shouldve closed it a long time ago but stuck to my plan

https://www.tradingview.com/x/FKFJPUMA/

EDIT: decided to close me 6610 spot short at 6227.

EDIT2: hourly closed below the block, long closed. 4H block so maybe shouldve waited for the 4H to close below it but we've not had an hourly close below it. could be a London Judas, we'll see. either way im happy, had a lucky couple of weeks on mex. Taking rest of the day off, have a few tokes and watch some films.

Tomorrow, performance reviews and education time. gonna analyse past trades see how they couldve been played better and really go hard on my reading list.

Good luck to you all
Itching to short but staying out of position. Don't think we're gonna get a panic drop through 5800 just yet. Still room to drop on the 12hr and daily RSI but 4hr has been oversold for a few days now. I've been all fiat by default for a while so that's gonna stay my default 1x short
Can somebody please post a TA of this IH&S I keep hearing so much about, I've not seen one.
Fun fact: 4H chart over the last 3 weeks looks pretty stable if we remove all erratic (6) BGC and (4) BRC.
Since 6.3 fell, only other reasonable level is 6k now, another 200 down we go.

Flippening status: pending
Gooooood moooornning aaaaaaaaaaaahhhh 

So, if this 12h moving average confirms down I expect a new test of the pink line at 5850 https://www.tradingview.com/x/CSUA2xZG 
Cant' even break $6200 without being pushed back down now. I would be really really impressed if we pump up from here without going down a bit first. We were at $6354 just 8 hours ago lol.
Not great continuation from this pump in the following hour. We are finding support above the 12/26 EMA on the 1H time frame, but we were rejected from the 12 EMA on the 4H time frame. 

I was stopped in at 6250, but will looking to limit sell at 6275. I'm not convinced that this is anything more than a stop hunt at this point.

Edit: Additionally, this pump reset the 1H RSI and cooled the 4H RSI significantly.
I dont think even $6100 will hold. Every time BTC consolidates at the bottom of the pump it just plummets down further. Is that what bear flags are like? Consolidating or just going up slightly from the bottom of the dump? Any TA experts here that can correct me if i misunderstood bear flags?
I am watching this falling wedge right now. If we stay at this price for the next 2 hours I will assume we broke up.

Leading on from my previous belief that we are going through a wyckoff accumulation,now i can see a IH&S forming. target 7400-7800.

250B market cap broke, so I guess 5.9k is coming again
6300 should be resistance now, support is 5800-5900. https://imgur.com/a/QzJN9Ya
We are continuing the trend of every dump being weaker than the last. Volume on the dumps has declined significantly. Sorry to disappoint some of the uberbears here, but unless we see some higher selling volume, this isn't going to make a new low.  I now expect a longish period of sideways chop.  It will be boring and difficult to trade.

So we are hanging at the breakdown target from the Bollinger M top (\~$6150).  I believe we broke down from our bullish catapult pnf formation as well.

Watching the ticker here, as I will.

Watching for a bit of follow through from the bears here, looks to be more price action coming up.

Any more follow through from bears and I think the price is going to get away from the bulls a bit. I will close a large, high-margin short in a wide range between $5300 and $4300.
Why do people think this ETF will magically cause BTC to go up?  Have they even read the details?  Do they not know what happened to the price of gold after the ETF was released?

edit: I know it's just the standard delusion and hopium
I'm here to make my standard "watch for volume" post. Volumes are near-dead right now, volumes will continue to keep creeping down until we see some real volatility and price discovery.
Opened a small hedge long near the bottom of the BGD then market closed my short near the top. Now I'm having second thoughts. Makes me feel a bit uncomfortable to not have a short.

Hi folks,

lets have a poll time! Question: Is it a good idea to buy now?

[https://strawpoll.com/sxy2k7y2](https://strawpoll.com/sxy2k7y2)

Thanks for participating.
600btc market buy on finex and the price barely moved. You know, that bear is serious. You'll need billions of dollars to move this market around given how much supply is being thrown around there.
Expecting to break $6k within 24 hours.
Bitcoin dropped 100 alts went down a few dollars, weird.
I find it amusing that bag holders in 2014 were putting all their hopes for moon on an ETF and now bag holders of 2018 are doing the same thing.  Won't be long now until the ETF is denied and then this sub starts talking about the halving as the reason bitcoin will moon and claim the ETF denial was no biggie and totes expected, just like 2014.  Nothing ever changes in the bitcoin community.
Holding a short from 6350. Still maybe 30% of my trading stack waiting to be added... but I'd like to wait to add it to make sure we aren't really pulling an IH&S. That formation would be validated if it goes back up and breaks the neckline... but when is it *invalidated*? Would it be when the forming shoulder goes lower than previous shoulder or lower than the head?
Everyone and their nan seems to be going on about the ETF, its making me think that August 10th will either be a great day or a really shit day and im gonna be ready to play both sides.

Also, whats the general opinion on Teeka Tiwari and his Palm Beach thing? It costs 5k (!!!) but im in a telegram group that posts all of his shit. He's pretty convinced that the CBOE ETF will get approved. Is the deadline for that one 10/08 too or is it a different proposal with a different deadline?

This last wick to $6110 was picked up pretty aggressively..we may be approaching a local low before a short term bounce. 

edit:  Going long here.  Will bail below $5950

aaaaand 6200 just broke... time to buy more shorts...

a long dump with a stopover at 6200.... looks eerily like the inversion of the long pump from 5900 to 6500...

i think we will see 6k fall and probably reach a fresh new low for the year today
/u/jarederaj can we have a `Trader` flair?

This sub is also full of people who hold, are perma bears etc. We have a flair for anything besides 'I just trade'.

So I will continue to post daily (comments: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8wyyub/daily_discussion_sunday_july_08_2018/e1ztfrj/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8xlbz1/daily_discussion_tuesday_july_10_2018/e242lkc/) and [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8xwe54/daily_discussion_wednesday_july_11_2018/e26nqt5/)) here until I close my positions and stop trading for few months.

the 1h, 2h, 4h oversold again, 12h looks bullish (ichimoku cloud) but every other interval is bearish so much room for the trend to continue down on all intervals 1d, 3d, 1w this is why I don't think the 12h will play out. it is also worth mentioning that we are near that time/event when fear will set in and then leading indicators such as RSI, ichimoku cloud, and moving averages will be completely broken, traders will try to take advantages of dumps and small bounces but most will be badly burnt each time because of that.

Also, funny/strange enough, bad news always is timed at these huge dumps which make things even worse, didn't check the news yet, but I will not be surprised if we see some really bad news out there the next couple of days that will speed this process   

Edit1: yesterday I thought we will have a new low today, but woke up to $6150, the day is still long (EU) so let's see how today plays out.


Edit2: some of the people who will be the fuel of every crash caused by fear, uncertainty, and doubt until the bottom are these who writes comments like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8y6i8u/daily_discussion_thursday_july_12_2018/e28rvap/), they find it easy to believe Bitcoin can hit $100K yesterday but not $2K, which is mind blogging to me, fundamentals didn't change much for 2 years, First layer is maxed out and LN will take years before it will mature and be widely adopted. 
This bounce appears to have no legs, we'll be below 6k in the next 24 hours.
Another day of waiting for the next leg down. Wonder how far they'll push it down.
the next 24 hours will be interesting

will Friday the 13th live up to its bad luck reputation with a massive move down or will it be a counter move and we'll see a green day instead? 

stay tuned to find out

I closed 33% of my short at breakeven, I’m not bullish but with my idea being invalidated within the day makes me less confident to put up a big position here.

Hello wall, nice to meet you.
I think that’s a bullish divergence on RSI I see on today’s drop to $6150 vs. the drop on the 10th to $6350. Has anyone else looked into this?
I just dont get who wants to sell right before completion of bullish pattern, this is no normal selling this looks Like intended hindering of any bullish breakout.

Most of you are probably familiar with the name [Richard Wyckoff](https://imgur.com/a/kSdqPuZ). Take a long moment to study this picture. Do you see anything *peculiar*?! Take your time and look over this picture very carefully.

Do you see it?!

Yeah, amazingly enough, it's true. [The pattern fits Wyckoff precisely](https://imgur.com/LMlVNiD). All the components of this pattern are displayed very clearly, but they're not immediately easy to spot.

Now, here's the amazing part... [Does this look at all familiar](https://imgur.com/a/kbT0zJ8) to you?! That's right!! This is the same exact formation we're currently seeing on the chart. 

This is no coincidence.

I think I might go long here because of how there are close to 3 supports for BTC down here. 

1. 0.618 fib support ($6169.2)
2. Bottom of left shoulder support ($6107.9)
3. "Longer" term BTC trend line support

Let's say it doesn't work out, I'll just put a SL slightly below the left shoulder support at $6107.9 
Closing short from same time yesterday opened at 6,365 at 6,167. Quick trade and another small gain for the short streak. Last 3 shorts have all been profitable. Not big profit, but some profit is better than nothing.


I wanna go long here at 6,167 but have a weird feeling if I do we will dump to 5800... I've never opened a long and I'm kinda scared too in a bear market.
Seriously thought about buying back in at $6325 since it remained really stable even though i was gone for a bit. When I checked my exchange i was greeted with $6220 while Blockfolio is still showing $6325. Lmao turns out my phone isnt connected to the WIFI when i got back in.

Definitely not buying back in now since these dumps usually have follow throughs.
Called me a greedy bottom shorter yesterday for saying I planned on shorting at support. Wake up to profit today. Always do opposite of what a majority of people tell ya. Got down voted for saying this can go alot lower. Well we can.
Trading is a game of hot potato, and for shorters it's a very very **very** hot potato right now.

The moment the reversal happens, it's going to be so violent, anyone selling here will be panic buying back above $10K.

> The same does hold for the latter, just nowhere near the same level of amplification as an ETF.

Can you elaborate on why this is? Thanks!
> the Sponsor estimates that the US dollar OTC Bitcoin trading volume globally represents on average approximately fifty percent of the trading volume of Bitcoin traded globally in US dollar on US dollar denominated Bitcoin exchanges.

Think im gonna start looking into OTC markets and how all that works cos that sounds like a lot of money. reckon that 50% includes shit like tether or just strictly USD?
Possible. Told that today to one of mine. I see a range 6000-7000 (and yes, a little lower for short time is still ok) where we could be some months. It definitely feels flattening.

I do long term investment, and this is definitely an area to start DCA'ing again.
I feel similarly (and also, not backed by any explicit TA).

This year's $6-7k reminds me of 2014/2015's $300-400. Doesn't seem to be much appetite for anything higher OR lower. 
>This is not TA at all

Well basically it is since common TA tools are used for abstracting movement and crowd psychology like you talk about
(Compared to the last ~2 years) I’ve been thinking the same thing about $200 recently. Not that that is an absolute predictor or anything but there is a decent amount of weight that that is the correct “bet”
thi makes a lot more sense than the technical "analysis" voodoo
> what's it going to take to bust lower? Who's going to panic sell?

Regulation? No more Tether printing -> less buying. 
Do you mean the 200 after the 1200 peak?

I think we are in a similar bear market as 2014. That bear market dropped what? 85% give or take? That would put our current bottom around 3000? So I wouldn’t be surprised if we lose another 50% from here.

Which btw I think is a good thing and would only be following the previous major bubbles. One thing bitcoin has never done as far as I’m aware is return to the previous ATH. So assuming bitcoin doesn’t die (I don’t think it ever will) then your safe all the way down and can be confident in buying all the way down to collect your discount. I don’t think it will get anywhere near 1200 ever again but would not be surprised to see the bottom at 3000.

Next ATH 2020 (>20,000). Next peak bubble 2021.
Maybe it's good, stable coins most certainly have a better use case than 99% of shit coins 
I kind of like it. I see it sort of like a gauge of sideline money.
It could overtake LTC and get on place 6.
So keep it interesting for yourself. Keep 90&#37; locked in place and trade the movement with 10&#37; of your stack. 
Understandable. I'm not anything even remotely close to a successful trader, but I told myself that if Bitcoin could convincingly break above $7k I'd genuinely consider flipping position (i.e. in terms of my views, not so much any open trades, those all got liquidated because I'm an idiot). 

But no, looks like we're going to be testing resistance again at $6k. The question is whether we can convincingly break down past $5.8k. 
> Losing hope here.

Bullish.
Brilliant post! Do you have the ability to move the 250% scale higher so the parabolic peaks align? But without scaling it further so the width doesn’t adjust? I’m curious to see how the top and bottom overlay to see how near a bottom we might be now. 
Very interesting indeed.  Thanks!  
I think it's a better fit if you fit the current price against mid/late Sept 2014. Right at the point of the prior descending triangle-looking thing and the start of the "second half" of the bear market. 2018 is just moving a tad more quickly.

Things are more bearish now though because inflation is only 3.5%. In 2014 it was 25%. That's a shit ton of supply that was added to the market each day and it still managed similar sized rallies as today. 2018/2019 could easily turn out worse. 

Also, I notice that both of your charts have the current price corresponding with the bottom. This wouldn't happen to be hopium, would it?
scaling x or y axis?
Can you do the bubble burst before that one?  I feel like the people that are comparing now to the time when Gox collapsed is almost an autistic level of only looking at the charts and neglecting the real world events that caused it and greatly prolonged how long the recovery may have taken.  The bubble burst before that has more similarities to now imo, a greed based bubble burst of fomo and/or suspicious wash trading.
Let’s hope it is before the halvening.
when September ends, probably.
It's psychological. Everyone looks at it so it matters. It matters until it doesn't.
Because there are algorithms that use the daily for indicators
I'd be curious to see 23 other daily charts based on the others hours in a day just to see how similar or different they would look.
Because people don't think logically and are able to process large amounts of data.   It is ultimately arbitrary where each period of candle opens and closes, yet people trade those arbitrary candles more than makes sense.
It's not necessarily red/green that is important (sometimes it is) but where the candle closes as that generally indicates whether a support/resistance has been broken or not. You're right though that it is somewhat arbitrary to pick the candle close as the most important time point. You could pick 1 hour later and it would serve a similar purpose, but since everyone else is looking at the close it allows the traders to act in unison, which is often a benefit to them (if enough traders act on a specific close then they can push the market like a whale could).
Midnight UTC is evening in Americas and the time when Asia wakes up. UTC daily candles make quite some sense.
Nailed it.  Nicely done
good luck 
That could have been the most disastrous market order 
Well that’s what I call good timing
Divs work well on big timeframes, and for the shs/ishs they are valid reliable patterns its just that people here are mostly amateurs and open position whilst the pattern is 75% completed, a professional trader would trade the break of the neckline or the pullback to the neckline
lol I hear ya, but divs on the daily are generally more reliable than H&S patterns (not that that’s saying much).

I mean it definitely helped me when we had a bull div at $5800 and a bear div at $6700.
Let's bring back chinstrap 
> - The Inverted Head and Shoulder plays out and we get a push to $6450.

The iH&S doesn't play out until 6850 breaks convincingly. I'm amazed that so many people are projecting this ~~pattern~~ hopium onto the chart when it hardly exists. The right shoulder hasn't even started to form yet and the head and slope down to the neckline look really strange for a H&S. That doesn't mean it won't play out but it's bizarre to even call it an iH&S at this point.

!long xbtusd 6175 10x 100%

EDIT: Specifically, risk/reward favors a long right now. There's a clear line in the sand below which it's wise to close a long. And that line is just below current price. So this is essentially a, "if I'm wrong, I'll take a small loss. If I'm right, I'll take a larger gain" scenario.
> However, there isn't much reward for continuing to hold a short with the neckline just about 1% below current price.

The neckline is [10% *above* the current price](https://www.tradingview.com/x/TJAZlwft/), is it not? 

It's a little perplexing why people are taking this possible iH&S so seriously when it's not even close to completing. Seems like counting chickens before they hatch.
Haha man i am on vacation on an island in croatia
 and I am currently out! I saw your position swap and took a walk to my apartment.. for 50 min. So important is trading to me. All time ready to quit fun and hop into business BUT since I don't trade futures (short only with my normal stack) I dont like copying that trade :/ 

Edit: obviously you are the man, it went up
What's interesting is currently you only see the IHS pattern with BTC where as with alts they are absent. Could have just been that alts took a larger beating then BTC, but interesting nonetheless 
The two traders I admire the most, Chewy and DamonandtheSea, aligning on views gives me the signal to be a copycat here. The logic makes sense to me, seems to be good R/R with small losses if it doesn't work out. 

Going long here with a decent amount, but with tight stops just below 6k.

Did the same with my short. I'm glad to see other users are on the same page. Giving BTC a day to rest before hopping into another trade.
Memento me baby 
considering it myself. wtf is with all these nonsense notifications, why the hell wouldn't you make that opt in
Ha. Did this 6 months ago...
You are the one I was hoping to find. So what if it breaks down. What is your stop pooping point now?  
I've been mostly on the sidelines for the past few months, busy backtesting (fortunately the market has decided to go nowhere and wait for me to regain my confidence), and I've yet to find a strategy that performs better when I implement stop losses.  Obviously being married to a position is no better, but I think that if you use a certain indicator to signal your exit, it is best to stick with that, even if you exit at a loss.
Haven't used stops since 1987.  In equity markets they eat the stops all the time.
That's a shotgun marriage right there.  Good luck.  (My long was stopped out on the drop when it got a new 24hr low btw in case anyone was watching)

Fuck just like CNN or cnbc showed the guys how to buy ripple.. because... yeah it could become worth 10k per ripple... lol

I'd like to bring up /u/Jarederaj's ["Projecting from stability"](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/EwsyTSJs-Projecting-From-Stability/) which shows that projecting from here based on the past 7 bear markets, only one (2014) shows us dipping significantly lower than where we are now (~$3000).
People say crypto time takes forever..

A month feels like 2 weeks.

Is this the longest we have ever stayed in a range since our 20k decline? 
Curious what you think will happen if we finally see $7200+? Explosion up? Or just long sideways up there.
100% all-in or all-out is never a good choice. Re-balancing according to risk/reward is the way to go.
>like $17 gains because of fees wtf.

you can get a pack of condoms for that
So you won’t be spooked $115 from now?
It *might* be a good long term entry point *if* it goes sideways from here for a long time.

But I'd suggest: Wait a little. It might go down more.

Look at this chart for long term perspective...

https://i.imgur.com/Fdl8kER.png
This is exactly what I'm going to do
This is basically what I do. Hold and sell into the parabolic bubbles.
Slowly been nibbling over the last few weeks but we may go down to 4.5k for a bit.
I could sit on my crypto holdings for years if they continued to steadily increase in value for years.  However, the opposite is more likely to be true and not sure why you would want to sit on a position in that case.
That's been the story for alts for a while haha, would be nice to see them recover a bit sometime soon
You've been money recently... got into a long right before the bounce... let's see where this goes :)
Respect. Can’t lie, you’ve been killing it with your calls. Amazing amazing job - especially because most people, including me, are completely confused lately. 
You’re killing it, pussypizza.

Celebrate with both ^
I was seriously in my position for 12 minutes. Bought at 6082.5, sold at 6245. 2EZ.

Keep up the solid trades!
Continue rocking on, Catpizzas 
I used your chart from yesterday as an entry guide for my current long. Let me buy you a couple of beers.   


PM me your wallet address. 
I had the same [analysis](https://gyazo.com/e790329ba2ca9ddbe95cb7d01ef405c6) as you, and it was a no brainer, as in great risk reward. I knew we would touchdown slow with multiple lows to shake out the weak and the early. However when I saw your analysis here I was pretty gutted. I'm a bit superstitious in that sense. I am confident in my trade when I see that the forums are doing the opposite. So when I saw your post I was less confident in my trade.

Anyway, way too early here to 'call' it. Let's see what happens, don't jinx it! ;)
Maybe I should just keep doing what you do from here on out. I did that the last 2 trades I made and it worked wonderfully. :)
Solid calls lately man. Where to from here though?
It’s a bullshit bounce that will go down soon so all of you guys enjoy your temporary profit for 15 minutes or so. 
I know not using stops is the "wrong" thing to do, but there have been so many times like now I'm so glad I don't. I don't believe this pump. We'll see... 
Looks like the market is not quite buying this pump, also it turned from a bull div to a hidden bear div on the 2h. I wanna say I agree with your assessment here.

edit: lol nm changed my mind, now I can't decide :-P
Thanks! Just a heads-up, this still has room to go up. Not saying it will. I already closed my scalp long, but don’t get rekt shorting ;)

Trade what the chart tells you, not where you want it to go.
What does that have to do with sociopathy? 
Let the bulls play in the sandbox for a bit. Little do they know the box is filled with quick sand. Playtime will be over soon for the little bulls in the sandbox. 
Time for those hidden bull divs to appear! 
how are you able to see the chart normally with that bollinger band dipping to the earths core there? also, how did you get so much white space on the upper side of the graph as well? I've been trying to figure that out.
is that a bear flag or a bull flag?
A line that was formed under different contextual variables. 
>No one is selling

lol this isnt even hopium anymore its a completely new state

I think Bitmex offers better rates and liqudity though. However, I am looking forward to USDT derivative markets that could insure against peg risk
It was obvious that a bubble will correct under 6000$. I kept repeting it and you acting all surprised loool
there are people who expect $4.5k my man (or woman)
> Everyone expects 5800.

No, they don't.

> Am I being alone and unreasonable to expect 5500

Yes you are the only one.

Maybe, but so am I!

This is an exaggeration, but I find BTC's plunges almost as thrilling as the jumps. It's all gripping entertainment. 
So many great news, so little price action
Says right from their own support page link that they will never support the USA, Canada, UK, France, Aus, and many others (FATF).  Also, I suspect these will be coded as cash advances which makes it a really stupid idea to use a credit card to buy in.
I think I see what you're seeing. The price would have to hold above $5.8k for over a week. The longer the better. I really think bitcoin has one strong dead cat left in her before we consolidate further for god knows how many months. 
He is trying to convince himself this market action signifies a reversal...speechless.
if you are lucky maybe we retest 6300$ as resistance. Good luck.
5500 is also a new low though, which isn't good. That said, my heavier buys start there too.

Stop losses execute as market orders on CoinbasePro/GDAX
Depends on your time frame. If you're a hodler buying in here isn't too bad of an idea. If you're a daytrader and you think bitcoin is going lower, you're probably going to sell here.


Imo this rally isn't that much different from earlier corrections.
because that's a 33% loss on no leverage...?

Would you hold a short through a 33% pump? 
Everyone here flips bullish/bearish the second a bart appears what are you talking about?
BM daily posters are like my friends that I never take seriously.
Just amazing $300 from 9 month low and people coming up with bullish reasons.
We set a new ~8 month low a couple weeks ago and we sure didn't freefall. What makes you so sure we will freefall this time?

!short xbtusd close 6140 100%

This ain't going anywhere.
Substantial bullish divergence from OBV between here and 5,755. If bears aren't going to make a new low here it paints a pretty bullish picture; Bulls are letting bears push the price down so they can buy at a discount.
Just bust your way back in like you are Kool-Aid Man... OHHhhhh YEAAAAaaaa
LOL .. that call was premature as well..
Maybe you should try shorting bottoms of recent dumps and longing the top of recent pumps lol.
Do the opposite of what you first intended to do.
Anyone who trades with emotions does this
short the bounces. and be patient. The best short entries are the ones that are extremely uncomfortable to hold where you're unsure if it's about to bust through resistance

Also you may need to be more patient and understand the nuances of price discovery.. 

Longing $6100 the first time around = 10% bounce.. Second time around...dip to $5800 then bounce (although you'd have missed the bottom by 5%) 

third time around..kinda playing with fire imo 
It's super easy to trade.  You just have some emotional wall that wont let you short for whatever reason.
One of the things that always baffles me is how people who call themselves "traders" on either side of the trade can be so arrogant about their position as to insult the opposing side. Not only is it more healthy to approach the market impartially, it's better for the community not to be a dick to others based on your position. Do you really think that calling bitcoin a ponzi scheme is going to sway someone to sell? Do you really think making predictions of 2000% gainz is going to make someone FOMO in? Take that weak shit to /r/cryptomarkets.
It's been like this for months (or maybe just since forever). Bulls can be annoyingly optimistic or even delusional in some cases but bears can be down right jerks/trolls
Bulls vs bears is an absolutely stupid mindset as a trader. Sometimes that is difficult to reconcile as a cypherpunk, because you want the space to eventually find success. 
So I have to wait 4 more days until we get a crappy squeeze at $5.4k to diss ya? 
Don't forget CBOE already applied to the SEC for a BTC ETF and got rejected. I think this second shot might have a better chance but it isn't in the bag yet. Also, my understanding is \_even\_ if they get approval it wont be operational until Q1 2019.
yeah this thing could pump 100% in 24 hours. 

obviously pretty damn unlikely, but its possible 


What is a BGD? I've been coming here for almost 5 years and have never heard of it.  Give me the low down on the latest hocus pocus

Was commenting on this yesterday. The only other time this has happened for BTC is in 2014:  [https://imgur.com/a/z5ibON2](https://imgur.com/a/z5ibON2) 

It resulted in the TD buy countdown yielding a great entry.
>are all on TD buy 9 on the weekly chart

Could anyone explain me what is this?
Interesting that the the second largest market cap (Eth) isn't on there. I largely consider Eth to be traded/held/used by a slightly different market makeup than BTC, despite being directionally coupled with BTC. Are those the only ones that you've been watching, or is this the result of a profiling algorithm? Notably NEO is missing from this list (and ETC, although ETC exhibits reactionary behavior to ETH + BTC in a way that makes me think it's used as a maximalist hedge). 

Thanks for pointing this out Simple. Off hand, do you have any numbers on how accurate TD Sequential has been historically for XBT/crypto in general?
I'll choose lucky number 13.
Since we had the 13 countdown last time, and since we are mirroring the last bear market "perfectly" just accelerated, I guess the bet is on the TD countdown... ? (I will play the reversal, even tho we hit 6k so often..) 
1-2k is definitely possible, and not even crazy. I would be very surprised though.

My gut sense is an ultimate bottom somewhere around $2500-3500. 

Would be surprised if we don't at least re-explore mid $5xxx

Totally admit I'm talking out of my ass, though. Don't trust anyone who claims to know wtf Bitcoin is going to do next. 
A lot of people seem to like 3k as ultimate bottom - myself included. 

3k was resistance and denied in June 2017, tested again in that July, then finally broke in August. Also tested as support once in September but practically held (small $20 fakeout I guess.) Additionally 3k is precisely 85% from the top which is the same as previous bubble.

Of course it *could* go to 1k and the bottom *could* be just 5.8k as well, no guarantees.
Lol 1-2k. Good luck breaking $3k. Back when China banned exchanges in October i think $3k only broke for a minute or so and the absolute bottom was $2800 which i doubt anyone but bots was able buy because it was so fast. The price then rebounded very fast to $3,500 or so. After that it was $4500 in a week or so. It was when Charlie Lee was giving insider info about bitcoin exchanges banned in CHina.

Bears in this sub were in denial back then.

TLDR: I doubt we'll break $3k if we reach it.
Possible? Yes. Probable? No.
> Is 1-2k possible?

yes. you answered your question.
/u/peacehere
Personally, I would be buying well before that as a relatively new investor who missed out on buying at those prices the first time.  There were enough people buying to slowly turn the market around 4 years ago.  Those people watched bitcoin seemingly burn to the ground due to the hack. If that market could turn around, I am willing to bet on it turning around again. Even if I am wrong I would not regret it because I am sure as hell not blowing this opportunity again, even if it would be unlikely to repeat at that point.
All is possible 1 -2 K but also 10 -12K. 
Yes of course 1k is possible. Anything is possible.  What matters is what the probabilities are.  And there is significant probability we go down to 2k or 1k or lower in the next year or two.

So many people are in denial about what gov't regulations and protectionism are doing to crypto.  Someone posted the other day about how, in their country, you have to pay something like 35% tax on crypto gains and losses cannot be deducted for tax purposes.  So if you make $10,000 on one trade and lose $11,000 on another trade, you owe $3500 tax, even though you already lost $1000 total.   Japan has crazy high crypto taxes too.

You won't accept how badly we are all getting f*cked, and this is just one way those in power are doing it, and there are many more.  And there will be many, many more if BTC doesn't die as fast as they expect.   That is the #1 reason why crypto prices are falling and will continue to fall.
And.. why multi year? 

We are down 6 -7 months - Called bear market. 

And you talk about a Multi Year?? If?
Watch this ih&s play out along with the wycoff accumulation (according to wycoff the spring would start exactly on a retest of 6k). The two biggest meme TAs out there 
Bears are older. With age, comes great bitterness.

Bulls are younger. With youth, comes hopes and dreams. 

Totally bullshitting btw. /s
I imagine that's all going to change if we go sub $5.5k

if we see a $4 at the front of the price I'm fairly sure lots of people will get extremely bitter/angry

bears are getting impatient. no reason to be despondent over recent price action if you're bearish, but salty/angry, yea it makes sense. bulls have no reason to be *angry* yet, but they are worn out and tired from hoping every pump/rally will last and doesn't

I am kinda surprised lots of ppl in this sub are closing shorts or going long.  I know it's oversold AF on a lot of timeframe, but the drop from 6.8k is pretty nasty.  Also, the daily MACD is about to cross down if we can't bounce a couple of hundreds soon.  I feel like we gotta have at least a few more red days before the real real bounce.  Dunno though.
Volume is dropping again. Will pick up when the sell off resumes, same old shet. Too many people are waiting to sell to break even and get out probably. Look at the Alts sub. Why would the majority risking to buy here? I believe the price will continue to drop here to low 5ks and people who are accumulating will continue to buy and average down as this makes a new low.

The pound also hasn't really recovered from its drop on the brexit vote way back when
>there was an extremely sharp drop, then "recovery" (within same day - 3 days) and then the bleeding happened for a long time if I can remember clearly. 

Not quite what happened. We dipped and recovered over a couple of weeks then went on to pump 200% to the new ATH of 3k.
The ETF approval bull run will be less of a "new money flooding in" run and more of a "self fulfilling prophecy" run. Which makes me worried about its sustainability, if it does occur.
The SEC has the power to approve ETFs as they also have the power to go after anyone on the markets they trade on. 

They have no power over huge swathes of the Bitcoin market. Because of that I see no way how they can approve a Bitcoin ETF even if they were desperate to. 

The Winklevoss denial sparked the epic alt bubble to the second. ETH took off from the $10 range and never came back the moment it came through. Alt fans immediately knew BTC wasn't going to be a separate and elevated market because of the ETF. 

I don't expect that again, but I would hope people weren't dim enough to expect a yes to be in the bag and squeal when it's not.

Basically can't go any lower than $6100 or else everyone will be dumping. 
The funny thing is that number of longs continue to increase. So many underwater already. I guess most of them will close/liquidate  below 5.700. Which makes me think that we might wick down to 5.5. Am I thinking right?  


Edit: But at the same time stopping and reversing at 5.700 makes sense as well to make a feeling of triple bottom and trap even more longs in another bull trap.
Except it bounced here on our first break into 6k. That's why everyone is talking about an iHS.
But wasn't it selling for $400 when it forked? Wouldn't it be up by more than 50% as well?
FYI: I bought BCH for $130 on August 1st, 2017.
[deleted]
agreed, the dumping to low 6ks followed by a pump to 6300 stronlgy indicates that this was just a stop hunt.
[http://thepatternsite.com/flags.html](http://thepatternsite.com/flags.html)
Flags aren't the best indicator, they're continuation patterns so they can be rejected. There are couple of continuation patterns, it didn't have to be a flag, sometimes it's a triangle.
Why not use wick to wick and take the trend line from the top of that red candle?
That is a very nice entry man ;)
Nah, still more room to go down.
what am I looking at here buddy
Good position for a long. Lets see if you are right again ;). 
> I now expect a longish period of sideways chop.

If I had a Bitcoin for everytime I've been reading this here...
Lower volume is bearish to me, means less people are willing to buy, even at these low prices. Interest in crypto has been fading for months now, it will be a slow crawl down I think.
Do you have any actual numbers for volume for these past few dumps to back up your claim?
That's because those that dumped are not buying back in to dump more later. Lower volume on dumps is not a bullish indicator, its bearish.
I agree the ETF sucks it entitles the owner to some Bitcoin stock not Bitcoin itself.  We need an investment vehicle that soaks up the float of Bitcoin to make a meaningful price movement.  Otherwise it's just another tool for market manipulation.
> Do they not know what happened to the price of gold after the ETF was released?

Um, it was in a bull trend that continued to rally hard??

If an idea feels good, you can guarantee a sizeable portion of any given human population will latch onto it! 
I think good ETF news could spur a nice rally but potentially not a macro trend change. Although an ETF is bullish for the price long-term, since it opens the door for many more participants.

Similar to when we were at $1200 and an ETF denial didn't change the bull trend. It could've been a good excuse to top out at a multi-year resistance level.
I mean, that's how markets typically work, right? We had a volume increase during the dump a few hours ago, and now it's painting a bear flag which equates to a lessening of volume before the next break. 


Jeandulouz!  I haven’t seen you since you were making your ridiculous “$3000 this Summer” predictions in early 2017! 

Edit: yeah, the joke is that it seemed ridiculous at the time but it ended up being spot-on and then some!

Nice
You Judas
So you have a firm belief that code which represents the "creation of value out of thin air" should never be legitimised by a state government. Then at the end of your comment you go on to say that Bitcoin will be "ready for an ETF" some day?

Without your last paragraph, your point of view appears internally self-consistent. The last paragraph appears to me to contradict everything before it. Suffices to say I don't understand at all.
"Bits of code" have value; data and software. People make it "out if thin air" all the time.
t. brainlet
'You do not want to legitimise code. You do not want to create a precedent that value can be created out of thin air,'

Erm, is this not the basis of everything these days? 

Take a look at some of the ETFs out there right now. They make BTC look like something put together by Zeus after the laws of the universe agreed to run it. 

Many an ETF is utter, utter dreck. 

The value is already there and the SEC had nothing to do with creating it. It may enhance it. 
So your pretty dead set against an ETF? Arn't you the "final margin call" guy?
Wow nice! Congrats!
It's been a hot minute lad, give it some time haha. But yeah, long way to go to inspire any confidence in this pump.
they tried their best.
Perfect way to engineer some long liquidity ;)
Trying to find signal when there's just noise 
in other words: perfect conditions for grand scale accumulation. ;)
yes, that was a long...this guy is going to have a bad time.
Anyone that wanted to FOMO in did in the last 9 months. Now 9 months later it is almost time for a new low. If you waited this long to buy then wait a bit longer for a lower price.
Yes you would literally need billions of Tether to move the market and guess who has that? Our good ol buddies at Finex!
Why?
Alts are holding well...First time i've seen alts be green vs BTC while BTC dumps. 
Alts move together with ETH basically. And ETH didnt post a new daily low yet. It has been like this the past few months.
Not really

Man, i really wish i was a bagholder in 2014 tho ;-D.
Does anybody believe that the ETF will be approved? Regulatory clarity is what we're hoping for. Approval is very unlikely.
I remember in 2017 plenty of people here doubted the ETF would be accepted, it wasn't and price mooned anyway.
Yes and the day of the etf announcement we're going to have a crazy looking candle like in 2014
> claim the ETF denial was no biggie and totes expected

By this point you'd have to be a fooking moron to think otherwise. 

It doesn't have to be an ETF.  Just something to create a FOMO frenzy.  That is the only thing that keeps BTC afloat.  Of course, this means that BTC will always have some value, it will just fluctuate with the level of hype, just like any other "asset".
> I find it amusing that bag holders in 2014 were putting all their hopes for moon on an ETF and now bag holders of 2018 are doing the same thing

I said the same a couple of months ago.  They will start obsessing and posting about the halving in here often, because it's all they have left.  The ETF is largely a pipe dream, but the halving is a sure thing, so they will focus on that.  People are sometimes very predictable.
I guess that when the price difference to the head is small. But personally I think that since 6300 support didn't hold it's already invalidated unless we close over 6300 today.
Any ETF will probably be pushed back by the SEC for as long as they allow (like 240 days). Everyone around for the last round of ETFs are familiar with that.
People here are talking about it mostly because there isn't a ton else to talk about currently. No matter what people here purport, it's a low chance of approval, and most big players are cognizant of that. I'd be very surprised if we significant negative price action in the event of a denial.
***"Buy the rumor, sell the news"*** is what the inner trader in me is saying.

\>Very bearish sentiment in this sub today.

What did you expect lol BTC just dropped from $6790 to $6168 within 48 hours while it took more than a week or so to reach the top of the local pump.
Market doesn't care about opinions on reddit, it cares about positions opened and for now I still see 12k more longs than shorts on bitfinex when they were almost at parity two weeks ago for the same price. 
[removed]
Someone also said that at 6k3, hmm look at it now.
Someone said the same thing about the wick to 11k on Dec 20.
How is that aggressive when the price was $6175 just an hour before $6110 and it couldnt even break  $6150 right away
Could add something like `Day trader`, `Long-term trader` and `100x Degen`.
this whole sub is based around trading. I think the bulk of people in here are assumed to be traders / people who partake in the market. It'd probably be a little redundant, not that it's whole lot to ask for or anything though.

It is definitely tradeable. If you're experiencing rage, quitting is probably a wise choice. Hope it's not too bad. 
What?

How is a $150 pump untradeable?
Were you short?
Yep, that's what the folks running this show lately what you to feel and do, it's their game for now, till the bottom of barrel is wiped clean.
Love how old school the charts are in the second pdf you linked. 
Might your ST phase B be SC, your peak be AR and your spring be ST Phase B? This would place us much earlier in accumulation.
Energy? Universe energy?
? I mean, if you're looking at a low volume exchange, yeah. But currently finex is at 4.3k BTC for the hour so not sure what you mean.
Wait, are they STILL making Treehouse of Horrors episodes?? That's amazing 
A buy or sell one?
[deleted]
Hmm, not so sure. Look at that BTC high unconfirmed transactions. Usually a bad sign before a massive sell off.
I'm watching it. There's also bullish divergence on the MACD and a [falling wedge](https://imgur.com/9P6JS7N) has formed. I think bears may still be able to make a move and break the support which would be very bearish, but if they don't the bulls will take the reigns and test the resistances.
the majority of the market isn't trading on one of the worst performing patterns btc has. they're just blindly buying and selling haphazardly. Any asset that goes $1k to $20k in a year is full of people with 0 plan 
Do you mean the IHS meme? 

We’ve had so many of those things on the way down that failed. 
Perhaps these whales know ETFs are coming and trying to keep prices low before buying back in. Same way they helped the bull run before shorting futures.

H&S pattern is really a joke. I almost never rely on this. It plays out so rarely in bitcoin!
yeah, it doesn't look like it will last more than 24 hours lol.
I don't follow the logic.
> Bad luck for me, but back on the grind now.

I punched a full grown lion in the head.  It bit me.  Can you believe it?  The luck I have these days!
Why on earth would you do that? If you have such big gambling tendencies you shouldnt be trading
I suppose it depends really on how big the stack was

The lesson here is not to play with 100x leverage.
you should take the rest of your stack to the casino and put everything on red. better odds than trading the way you are.
100x -> rekt

50x -> gainz$z$

Thin line only smart/lucky traders can walk thru.
This is not a typical capitulation wick if think it is. The volume is too low.

Edit: And the wick itself is small as penis of ant.

That 40 million  buy wall is likely faker than Jake the snake. When buy walls are being spoofed, I'd say that's super bearish.
if it's flashing it's fake ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯, probably just someone testing market sentiment or baiting traders to fill his shorts.

They seized $1.5 million, but the transaction volume over 8 months was 1.5 billion. Idk, not a big deal to me.

Why people don't understand that you get downvoted here not because of what you do but how you do it.

There is a difference between 'this is going down, I'm shorting' and 'we bounced hard off 6.8, support of 6550 and 6400 didn't hold, we didn't even try to bounce on the way down, RSI cooled off, this looks like it's gonna break another support, I'm shorting'.

First one get you downvoted, second one is quality content.
Gloating isn't really a desirable human trait.
Why do people promote this myth of a rapid reversal. Historically it takes months and years for bitcoin to reverse. It's never quick. 
\>anyone selling here will be panic buying back above $10K.

$10k is a bit much hopium dont you think? Surely they'll get a chance to FOMO in at $6500 or $7000 during the reversal.
People in this sub are probably aware of the (daily) prices. Some people plan to stay out of it to buy back at lower prices or buy back at a higher (fomo) price. It doesn't have to be $10K. You could plan to buy in at $5K (low) or eventually when it reaches $7K (fomo).
This made my laugh.
Care to share what makes you think 10k in a week and ATH by August? Or are you all hot air?
bullish hopium pass it my way!
Reason?
I don't know if this is a good trade but this is a very nice entry.
You can't just cut the wicks for the first low and not for the second one
Well, it doesn't manage to go back up to the upper resistance. Pretty bearish to me.

It's nothing until it completes by breaking the neckline anyway.
Don't rely too much on H&S and IH&S. It is very unreliable in bitcoin.
This shoulder is dipping pretty hard, I was convinced until today
Lol bgd? Not a chance ..this already went over 6200 and couldn’t even push to 6250
Well I guess it did do maximum pain first. 
Double bottom at $6000 and that level has held off quite well this year, so we aren't really at $6200.  The price is really $9500 and the charts are all wrong.
No, they can't, because there's no reason why that could not nor would not happen... Don't understand the question?

The creation and redemption process in a Trust is more cumbersome than that of an ETF. This is even moreso the case for a Trust product which is being solely marketed to accredited investors as is the case here. It is all laid out in the Notice pages 26- 34. 
I could be wrong but I believe the whole point of tether is to facilitate transactions crypto to crypto without involving fiat currencies. OTC's entire purpose is to facilitate (generally) large transactions specifically using fiat.

So I don't think OTC would ever use tether
True. I guess I meant I have no charts, lines, or indicators.
They're still issuing tether.

A fresh batch of $250m Tether was issued just over 2 weeks ago https://omniexplorer.info/address/3MbYQMMmSkC3AgWkj9FMo5LsPTW1zBTwXL
Yeah I sort of agree. Means people haven't ditched crypto altogether for fiat.
Yea I’m also curious if the low is shown in that picture.

Haa, yeah... :)

I think there is just a lot of uncertainty right now so people are just trying to play it safe with their positions, but I agree with you in regards to it not being an IHS
Great catch. I almost called you out on the 6111 entry until I figured it was on Sep. futs.
Meant new low in the current leg down. 
>  There's a clear line in the sand below which it's wise to close a long.

Just wondering: Do you mean a solid break of $6000 or a violation of the current trading range (like down past $6150 etc).

You're right, I misspoke. 

I meant that the line below the shoulders that would invalidate the pattern is 1% below current price.
>FYI You can turn them off (for all or individually) using the settings icon in the top right. 
I really dont know, I had planned for this, but I didnt expect the pump to, and rejection from 6.8k immediately after opening my position. I would have felt more comfortable if we had bled down to these levels from my entry point rather than getting here from 6.8k if that makes sense?

I think Im going to stick to my original plan, but I'm going to reduce my exposure. I'll close half of my position if we don't have a decent bounce between here and 6k.
This is why I had none. With the volatility the way it is, Im just asking to be stopped out on a wick.

Maybe the real flaw in my plan was my willingness to hold a long from 6.5k all the way down to 5k, where I had planned to add to my position. With hindsight, it doesn't seem like a very clever idea.


Really? 
Methinks there are downvote bots about

ripple was only 4 dollars very cheap
Ripple may be a scam, but I wouldn't bet against it. The owners have waaaaay too much money and can pump it up at any time. 
Yes, easily 
$7800+ is where I'd start believing I was really wrong. $7200 is where I would start worrying that I'm going to be really wrong, but volume nodes suggest a move above $6900 would likely result in $7100-7200 pretty swiftly- so I wouldn't be too surprised if we finally made a move for it if we moved above $6900. 

there's all sorts of resistance overhead above $6900 to $7800 though so it'd be a lot of work
Gotta pay taxes too. On the trade AND the condoms.
t-th-thanks bitcoin.........
Name checks out.
im only worried about this being a fakout similar to the drop from $6800 so if doesnt go down in an hour or so its safe to say this isnt the same fakout. i sold higher so i can probably afford to lose some BTC profit to protect capital.
Using this metric tricked me at 7600. Just want to say im going to wait longer than 3 weeks with a tight volatility limit because of that.
In that case, you could sit on a short position for years.  Personally, I think a long is safer on any timeframe above a few months.
gotta ask, why is the opposite more likely to be true? 
Yeah it has but to me really looks like some are desperate for a reason to bounce and if this has legs it will be it.
Haha I like you
lol, done!
Congrats dude! If you are on mex consider opening an account with my ref link so I can make pennies off your market orders :P
Up. Anything under 6200 is now a long with a stop under the low that was just set.

if it breaks $6350 then its legit

Yep news has been decoupled from price for several months as the bubble continues to unwind. There ought to be a reconciliation of this divergence eventually. 
Hey that's great! I can get my Amazon points again. 😁
Give it time. This news is huge. Looks like the limit for CC purchases is 20k. That's aaaaaaaaaaaaalot.
What's wrong with this market action? It is a fact that we haven't made a new low, and what if we don't? What if we do just range here in the 6k's for awhile longer? For me, this looks just as bearish as bouncing hard off of 5.7k looked bullish. The best argument I can see for a bear scenario is that we are in a bear flag, but the thing about TA is that you don't jump ahead of yourself until the pattern completes. So until we break down from the bear flag I don't see anything bearish about it.
I am fine either way, I am trying to look at the tide and get a feel for the balance of inputs and outputs. I have been quite bearish for a while, but putting blinders on doesn't help one objectively look at the data. 

For me the key takeaway is that the underlying mechanism for the correction will at some point reach an equilibrium and will not continue forever. The meme lines won't be the thing that changes things, though at times they may be correlative. Furthermore the decline petering out is NOT commensurate with a new bull-run, those are two different processes. 

For a new bullrun we need new buyers, for new buyers you need institutional access. I am of the opinion that tether will need to be settled without debate, ETFs will need approval, and stability or slight price increase is needed and all of that has to happen within the larger structure of regulatory clarity. 

So, again, a downtrend slowing is not the same as a bullrun starting, as evidenced by the years after 2014 which ranged largely "sideways" before contextual variables changed that allowed for a new bullrun. Two completely different processes along an equilibrium. Stop conflating the two in some sort of bull vs bear binary fantasy. 
We haven't even dropped a solid 10&#37; since our recent spike. We're not in uber bearish territory yet for you to be so confident. 
My thoughts exactly 
watch out you will get rekt in 30 mins
I should have included that the price at the time was 6177. I set the stop for 6350, received the warning that if the stop loss triggered it could incur slippage and clicked okay, but for some reason it just processed it as a market buy at 6177. I would assume that I fat fingered it somehow, but this is the second time this has happened to me in the last 6 months. It must be some weird bug of theirs.
But it should perform market order only if stop price got triggered. From what I understand OP moved stop down but market buy filled in regardless which I would assume is a bug.
Do stop orders execute differently in other exchanges? Curious..I've only used gdax and coinbase..
Higher percentage of the market is traders now I think which makes patterns self fulfilling 
I wouldn't short at this point. Fuck that game. Risk/reward is bad on shorting at this point.
I think fuckharvey did :-P

People don't get that we may never see increase in price.
as long as we're $1 above the low people will believe it's bullish

$1 below the low and it's dead 
> Just amazing $300 from 9 month low and people coming up with bullish reasons.

This---
Whale had to pump the price to fill some shorts before letting price freefall.

I think it's the blind optimism that annoys the bears into being jerks. Some of these bulls could be standing on some tracks with a train coming right for them and they'd still try and tell you they are safe just because they are looking in another direction 
lmao except that everytime we see a bounce it's 'bears get rekt'
Why can’t we all just get a long? 
^ Case and point
Yes I know that, but this second shot is our best chance yet. They've probably addressed the SEC's concerns over the previous rejection. Overall I don't think the ETF news will cause a big run up in 2018 since we were just in a bear market. People who are saying 50k by December are delusional at this point. I am looking at people like Datadash, who I personally respect a lot and i'm a huge fan of but like...its not going to happen. It would look ridiculous. At most we can see 12k again this year as a buy the hype and sell the event kind of pump leading up to the ETF in Q1, a subsequent dump/tax selling and then perhaps 50k+ by the end of 2019.
I don't understand what this has to do anything with what I said.
You must not have been here the past 3 months :-P
BIG GREEN DILDO
+1 lol, also the longs:shorts ratio indicates bullish sentiment (even if price is falling).
Irrelevant. So in your mind, "bad sentiment" is when 100% of people are 100% bearish, there is absolutely ZERO hope for even a short term reversal and ZERO TA regarding ANY even SLIGHTLY bullish scenarios. The world is not black and white. Inverse iH&S calling has nothing to do with market wide sentiment. That's not how it works. Even in the worst days of the 2014 bear market these calls and TAs existed. 
To be fair, it was planned since [July 9](https://twitter.com/WEXnz/status/1016330620308508672) :p Still looks bad though.
Strange, works fine here in all browsers (mobile/desktop.) I strongly prefer SSL, so I guess people can just change it themselves if it doesn't work and wanna see the change.

Good point, ETC, like litecoin (which everybody acknowledges) has been a tool of Bitcoin maximalists (like Barry Silbert) since inception, just in case the mothership steers on ground.
Here's my chart with a TD seq overlay on the weekly. 

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/g6L0gTJA/

On longer timeframes, DeMark has been fairly good at forecasting trend pauses/reversals.
I've heard 3k so often until now, don't you think it won't happen exactly bc of this?
Now take that in context. 

Hype was very much brewing in crypto at that point, since January it's been steadily dropping off month by month.

Point being during China it was clear it was not the end of the world, one country banning BTC, who had also banned BTC numerous times in the past. 

If we hit $3k now it is for entirely different reasons ie a total lack of interest. Don't underestimate how many people still have life changing gains unrealised, at some point even the strongest hands will crumble. 
thats very different, you had btc new highs in every tv / newspaper. btc already hit 20k, most of average joes got burnt, no one would give a fuark about btc at 3k.
What are your premises to say something like this? Just because it's very far away it's not probable? By that logic, are you saying that BTC when it was at 2k, was probably not going to 20k, and therefore 20k was a blackswan or a 1 in a 100 scenario?

SPX has crashed over 60&#37;, and SPX doesn't go up 10x in a year. Considering that, what makes you think BTC can't crash 90&#37;?
Likely? Maybe.
He asked about bottom.
That would fit Bitcoin perfectly.
I know you're kidding, but I wonder if there's any kernel of truth in that. Life does have a way of sucking optimism out of you, for better or worse. 
I bought it. We mid 30s are the rational ones :-p somewhere in between the bitter and the sweet.
> bulls have no reason to be angry yet,  


Being down like 70&#37; from the year isn't reason enough? 
You're delusional.
> At 3600 i'll sell family




I agree, we need to at least re-test the 5800$, but tbh I doubt it will hold.
Gonna ride my 6800 short until BTC has a flash crash. That when you know it's good to go long again.
Oh really? Anyone from Turkey or Brazil care to chime in? What's the mood in your country?
Wouldn't it make more sense to denominate it in BTC? This just shows inflation, no?

https://coin.dance/volume/localbitcoins/VEF/BTC
This is a possibility.
this is from other day: My current positions and what im doing with them:

40% leftover of my 5x Sept futures long from 5820 - relong on a confident close above ~6875, targeting around 75xx-76xx. Stops below ~6720. 

Assuming we dont go up, will close the remaining 40% if we cant hold 63xx-64xx (4H block with confluence). [Possibly relong the actual block with stops on the whole trade below but still not sure]

3x spot short from 6610 (underwater) - stop on a confident close above ~6875 (same as relonging condition) and targeting 63xx-64xx (4H block with confluence).


gonna find the post, 2 secs.

EDIT: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8x7y3o/daily_discussion_monday_july_09_2018/

says bearish if we break below the block so technically could keep the short open but i wanna take profits off the table, take a break and educate whilst corn figures itself out
We kinda all just waiting for it to go below 6100 now
There's a difference between invalidation of formation (going below 6k here) and breaking it (decline from ihs neckline). First one just says formation didn't complete so it may just bounce in different place, bouncing off a neckline when formation completes is completely different story.
Where do you see that the longs are " underwater already" ?

Nobody was able to sell it. It wasn't even clear how to safely separate the wallet at the time. It was a real cluster fuck for anyone running a full node. I still have some BCH that I haven't sold because it's a pain in the ass to deal with.

So BTC wasnt bear flagging when it dumps since its not sloping up? What is that called continuation?
Because then I will have only two places of contact to form upper line of the wedge. 
That we’ve been rangebound between a bullish block and a bearish one and just keep bouncing back and forth - along with the price levels it’s occurring at and strategy on how to trade it. 
it's been sideways chop for months so it's pretty accurate lol
Look at a chart you muppet
Are you familiar with the details of this particular ETF?

Are you familiar with what happened to the price of gold after the ETF was approved?
Zoom out and look at the volume. What has it been doing since 11.8K? Contracting volume -> trend exhaustion. It's still higher when selling but there's less participation.
try zooming out
Soz bruh. Gotta pick up dem cheap coins for the next bull run 
I ought to write a longer reply but I'm out right now. The gist of what I'd like to say is, before a Bitcoin ETF becomes a reality, the shitcoins need to die. A friend of mine made an ERC20 token last week which got listed recently on a tiny exchange and pumped about 6,000%. He has made about 35 BTC from nothing in a week. When shit like this becomes impossible, only then should the government actually endorse code as value. Too much scum in the space right now.
Or, you know, your balance in a bank
> Take a look at some of the ETFs out there right now. They make BTC look like something put together by Zeus after the laws of the universe agreed to run it.

You should go and submit that as a comment...
Yeah. :(

I'd love an ETF, but the public isn't ready. I'd invest in an ETF and would happily watch my holdings rise... But I can stomach the swings, and I also know exactly what I'm buying. The same cannot be said for a layman.
Early bird catches the wick.
i think so but predicting the bottom will be a hard business. just keep buying and don't bleed yourself. no margin. raw usd and to the longer term storage.

i dont think this bear will last years. i've been suggesting the bottom since sub-7500. so it might be hard for some folks who put their hard earned monies.
Or recognize that a price of 6200 is pretty damn good.  If it goes lower, just buy more.  
RSI on the 1D has room to go down to at least ~30 (that'll be sub $6k).
Yesterday everyone in here said "all alts dumping hard, bitcoin dump will follow"

Why are we surprised now or should alts dump twice?
2014 bagholders wished they were 2011 bagholders

t. 2014 bagholder
yea I mean in 2014 it was a bag full of winning lottery tickets, if the analysis that nothing has changed is true- then we should still be in great shape!
Not if you were a Gox bagholder

It's impossible to know for sure without being privy to the inside baseball, but I think we can't just dismiss that CBOE going for it this time around is significant. These are the hardest of hardcore insiders whispering right into the ears of regulators, and in retrospect circumstances surrounding the futures product offering may be very relevant for addressing many of the initial round of SEC concerns.
It's less than likely. However, the CBOE proposed this ETF - they aren't exactly a fly-by-night organization. Also, as far as potential catalysts go, this is way better than, say, "Chinese New Year" and "Wall Street Bonuses," etc. - that was just permabull delusional stuff.

Either way, we'll know by August 10th.
Futures trading on CME/CBOE came as a surprise, to me anyway. In the event of an approval, any idea what it would do toGBTC?
Erm nope

Somehow else who thinks institutional money is like a tap waiting to be turned on
The anticipation of the confirmed ETF alone would drive a bullish market.
right? lol

The guys with massive amounts of BTC that make it seem like they have a never ending supply of BTC. Most likely because the whales dumping are mainly dumping into their own buy walls so they don't really lose that many BTC while buying the BTC of those panic selling.

~800 BTC buy wall just popped up on bitfinex, got reduced down to 500
500 buy wall on finex and it's being sold into right now, ain't moving.

But with CBOE doing its thing won’t the ETF actually be bad for bitcoin. Pushing spot around to suit their forwards?


BTC is too low in mcap for this shit. 
Why do people think this ETF will be good for BTC price?  Hint: It wont
lol
I dont the logic.
Bitcoin seems to have a lot of self-similarity when it comes to these downward movements. I'm just applying what happened the last two months.
My god! The nerve of that animal, and I ain't lion!
My stack is less than 1% of my net worth, it's not like I'm starving here.

If you're in crypto to play it safe, why not just go long on regular companies and futures?
can confirm.  I did the [same trade](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8xlbz1/daily_discussion_tuesday_july_10_2018/e25s0i4/) with 50x and I'm currently at 450% profit.  its pure luck I didn't get liquidated.
I don't think it's capitulation. Simply, 6155 is 0.618 retracement and the 1m candle shows buyers(=whales) stepping in (buy volume greater than sell volume)
The axis is cut off so I have no idea what I'm looking at but I'm guessing that blue line is parity? I'm pretty sure it is based on what you said. Thank you!!
Thanks, m8. Nice to know my hard work and knowledge is appreciated.

I can't claim I don't use the downvote button myself, but I know what you mean.
Interesting that when you flip a literal head and shoulders, it resembles an inverse head and shoulders?


Or interesting that Wyckoff was indeed a human being with said attributes?


Or, was it that head and shoulders and Wyckoff patterns are in no way related and this was just a meme post?


Which part was interesting?

I like it. Vague but inspirational. 
In defense of FUD, sometimes fear and uncertainty are justified! There's a lot of FUD around the usage of FUD ;P
Bad news is the precursor to what? Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt. Seeds have been planted, let your minds do the rest. Carry on.
Thanks for the shoutout - but to be clear to everyone, I'm just another random amateur trader over here haha.

Anyway, that said, I don't think I use any ideas/techniques/strategies that others here don't use. I do think I use a wider breadth of things than some. I try to incorporate/look at the chart from a multitude of different frameworks when doing analysis. I also try to understand the math computation going on behind all the indicators I use, as it helps to understand their quirks and can help identify when it may be misleading (ie OBV after a bunch of dojis). Some things I'll include:

(1) Support/Resistance lines (basic) - tend to place more weight on longer term and less steep ones. I don't knock a line off the chart just because it's been broken, particularly long term ones (AKA meme triangle). When making a line I also zoom out to see if it's just that short term or if it possibly stems from a longer timeframe.

(2) RSI  - divergence, tend to place less weight on overbought/oversold unless it's time frames higher than 4 hr. I also use Stoch RSI, but really only pay attention to it on longer time frames.

(3) Volume Profile - Low Volume Nodes and High Volume Nodes are great to use to define trading ranges and possibly resistance/support, particularly when it lines up with horizontal lines.

(4)  OBV, Accum/Dist, MFI, CMF - Other indicators I use to look for divergence and signs of accumulation/distribution. OBV is purely volume based; Accum/Dist, MFI, and CMF are ways to incorporate price as well. Worth looking into. I especially really like them to help identify trends (does the price trend have a lot of volume backing it?).

(5) Classical chart patterns. I always consult the pattern site when I can, because patterns can be very misleading and some have nuances/volume considerations that are important to the integrity of the pattern. Also helps understand success rates with them.

(6)  Bollinger bands. On the longer time frames they can be very reliable to identify potential supports/resistances; on the shorter time frames they can help identify when volatility could be likely to expand. Long term their width can give some insight into the market as well (see jarederaj's posts).

(7)  Wyckoff Accumulation/Distribution - I do like to consider on different time frames if I can pick out something like this happening.

(8) Long:Short ratio. Gives an idea of sentiment, and if it's skewed in one direction it can help predict that hey, the buying/selling pressure might not be too much right now.

(9) I also play around with TD Sequentials every now and then.

The trick with all this information is parsing it down to  which ones are providing the most signal to noise at any given time, and keeping in mind your view on the weekly can be different from your view on the next 4 hours (and keeping that separate). When I observe something it's also important to look back and see if that observation was helpful in the past. As a past example (not applicable right now) - what happened most times we touched the top of the daily BBands with stoch RSI crossing in the oversold region?
Care to elaborate further, Dude?
Every dump that has happened so far came in pairs. You really think buying at $6200 is a good idea when its been less than 30 minutes since the dump started.

Be my guest lol buy in 
Trainer: GEODUDE USE UPVOTE!

*Geodude uses upvote*

It's super effective 
add one more reason.  This dude got caught up a couple months back commenting to himself with an alt account trying to justify his comments.  

In fact, if you are sorted by new, the comment directly below this one, /u/vroomDotClub,  is the other account in question.  

i didnt screenshot it because i aint got time for that.

just an fyi.
Historically...
Right now, unfortunately.. I'm leaning to the idea this bear market could take a long while to recover from. It has been very painful and its blazingly obvious the market needs to cool down. 

I'd be content with sideways  at this point.  
Maybe it's hopium, maybe I know something that others don't. Let's wait and see.
Just assume I'm a troll, cannot provide much information as I don't want to get exposed (to the groups I'm working with).
I'm expecting a violent move back upwards within the next 48 hours.

This is a shake out. If I'm wrong I am confident I'll be able to exit at breakeven regardless. The 6HR RSI/STOCHRSI are looking like they always do when I'm looking for an entry and with the 3D MACD/STOHRSI still lookin alright this position has the possibility of max profits.  

Oversold 1h usually bounce, if he closes in 6250 range it's a nice trade

edit: but now I read his position size, that's stupid yes
>this is a very nice entry.

Like I was saying to you the other day (pretty sure it was you,) am very good at picking bottoms even if they are temporary.

Will see how this plays out. I guess I'm staying at my PC for the next however while.
It's the same formation if you chop all the wicks. It's a daily chart. Of course you'd cut the wicks.
Yeah, seeing people post that "wedge" is just a facepalm.

BFX have a significant OTC desk that can be fed with tether.
good point, since tether most likely isnt involved in that calculation, 50% of USD volume isnt that much right?

Yes, they do. I was just trying to imagine what could possibly cause the price to suddenly go down. It could be regulation or just some bad things happening around tether.
Wonderful. Thanks for your efforts!
You should try 120% scale or whatever stretches it to September range. The ups and downs might not line up as well, but other things line up much better. I would say were likely on the verge of the second half of this bear market. Longer term trends are just starting to turn downwards and buyers are notably absent. It's do or die for bulls right now.

The next period of time is critical. 
June
No that doesn't describe all TA by any means.
Utc is the same everywhere. UTC = universal time code
No. The daily close is universal time
Not the person you were asking, but definitely divs. Hidden divs are used to indicate a continuation in trend, whereas divs indicate reversals. Divs seem to result in bigger moves.
Divs, at least for crypto 
Yes, watching divergence on daily candles would have allowed to pretty much sell the top in december 
Yep :) still have my hedge going on perps 
Gotcha 
A solid break below $6,000 would be my line in the sand.
Okay. What do you think of the fact that there are really *2 heads* on this pattern AND the heads are split by a bump that crosses the current price and the pattern-breaking line you're referring to?

edit: https://www.tradingview.com/x/BnH4STrB/ Kind of wacky looking "head".

If it was 3x or less leverage that could be an ok plan I guess.  But still better to cut it off and reenter.  But I'm guessing you blew your DCA load early.  I've fallen in that trap before.

It’s a link to the BFX order book on crpytowatch. OP is asking for something to replace bfxdata.com

how so? they are both bitfinex order books
You could, but if you are a good trader, you don't sit on every short position during a 20 or 25% bounce, before it heads down again.  Also, there are often fees to be paid on an open short position. Also, there is counterparty risk in having an open short position.

If you want to arbitrarily limit yourself to holding your positions for 6 months or longer, then go for it, but others don't restrict themselves like that.   
Hes a troll. A good one too
Because of reality.  Because of all the reasons cited in this sub, day after day, by myself and many others.  The biggest reason is that those in power in gov'ts and Banking, etc do not want crypto to succeed.  So it will not. They already started killing it (for most practical purposes) and they aren't done yet.  Yes, some people will still use it, but less and less will, and the price will be lower.   All of that is very likely.
I’m an Ok person 
1 Confirmation already (:   


Should be there soon. Thanks again. 
RemindMe! 24 hours "check how long it will take for this guy to get rekt"
Great call. How high you see this going? 
Thanks! I’m just parroting what I’ve heard before, as that and “buy fear, sell greed” are amazingly useful rules when applied appropriately.

I only say that bc I saw two bullish divergences on RSI and really didn’t want to long because of how the price looked. My guess was that it was bc people were suppressing the price before the daily close with such an odd RSI chart. I figured at worst, I could always DCA if I was wrong, considering the price went sub-$6100 for a minute or so and would eventually bounce back.

It’s always a hard game to fight your natural instincts, but I’ve found the less I trade with emotions, the more successful I’ve been (except for fear, as I typically take profits early).
dude you are my hero today this is spectacular.
I would argue that the environs that allowed for that line to develop in the past are not necessarily valid today, and that the underlying mechanism may be stronger or weaker. I would be more interested in learning what drove that line to develop and how before supposing that it will still apply here. 
dropped almost 10% in 2 days and no one is selling? what?
[removed]
False. There's over 100 genders!!!
Good news has always been decoupled from price, mainly because it's ineffectual and you harumph and think 'that'll be nice some day'. 

Bad news sends foam pouring out of your trousers instantly. 
It’s an amazing app and exchange. Decentralized exchange that accept CC from anywhere in thr world and everything is based on LTC smart contracts(BTC testnet). Even the 8% fee is low comparing to other buy BTC with CC solutions. Impressive af
/u/Justacluster - I'm curious to hear your thoughts in response to this... or are you still speechless? ;)
Yeah I mean the continued drop since January is irrelevant, the lower volumes, the drop in interest in general

But let's just focus on the recent spike
Speechless
You are not great at maths.  $6820 down to $6128 is 10.15%.  

And the price is $6165 right now. 
no u
He said he went to go move his stop losses when he noticed it executed, my guess, the order book was thin and he got fucked by slippage
in general there are two ways to implement stops. stop-limit-order and stop-market-order . Lazy exchanges implement it as a market order because its "easier" . Downside being you will take slippage if the book is too thin around the area your order executes. a limit order forces the market to actually meet at the price you intended.. the downside  is that you could get a partial fill and have price go back up.
Yeah they do somewhat, it depends on the fee structure of the exchange, binance has a 0.1% fee across the board for all trades (reduced by 50% if you use binance coin). 
barring some wild news, that's just your bias talking. There's plenty of reward potential. it could very easily go to $4.5-5k from here. I don't know why some people refuse to believe we can go below $6k for any period of time. 
>People don't get that we may never see increase in price.

Famous last words from a bear
> People don't get that we may never see increase in price.

This comment won't age well 

!remindme 10 years
I realized I actually held thru a 25% pump from $7.3 to $9.1...lol. it went down to $6k after 
He technically just sold at $15k, short 1x on mex
I see them on OKEX BTCUSD3M, but not on Bitfinex...
I mean longing has not proved particularly profitable lately in the long term - so I prefaced it with "go with the trend"

  but ya i mean you can definitely still make a lot from it. 

I just personally believe there will be another large dump some point here soon and I don't want to get in the way of it. I would rather be shorting when it happens 
that's, for the past few months, been the best time to just hodl a short :P

I remember at $11.7k everyone was freaking out calling for 3d macd switch blahblahblah and I  just had to tune it out. Actually, my coping mechanism for the longest time was simply commenting a lot and arguing with people. Now I'm much less emotionally receptive to comments here- it's easier for me to read bullish comments without getting uncomfortable.

But at first it's very difficult to read this sub and try to get the top or bottom of a trend. once you start doing it over and over again you realize it's actually quite easy because this sub is wrong a lot lmao
It literally happens every week or so that everyone is bullish near resistance while we haven't broken any important resistances since May. Best option at that moment is to take the short and keep a bit quiet on Reddit. 
>blind optimism

zoom out, youngin 

edit: just saying not *all* bullish optimism is blind, there is actual data and historical precedent. Being blindly optimistic about a shitcoin? Well that's another story.
I mean that's blaming other people for a person being a jerk. Do we blame the annoying "low hanging fruit" kid when he gets bullied? The bullies are still bullies and they could easily mind their own business unless the annoying kid gets personal or something.
Yeah it goes both ways, bears that saying $1500 and even lower are the 2018 moon bois
It's not so much blind optimism as it is comfort from being up 1000%.
But they do get rekt 
And stop being so short with each other!
I get it! 😀
I hate to be the baron of bad news, but for all intensive purposes, it's "case *in* point." Trust me, I have a sick sense when it comes to these things.
As good a prediction as any. I'd be ok with that :)
replied to the wrong person
That's when I first started hearing it, hoping it would go away because I knew it was a new thing I wanted no part of
Thanks
That's just one aspect. Look at all the rest of the bullishness here and on twitter and tradingview. Look at the long shorts ratio, like the poster below said. 

Where are you getting this negative sentiment vibe from? All I see are hopium addicts. 
I was telling him to edit.
/u/justanotherlogin when you come back from vacation you should fix this, don't get why bolded didn't work.
Ooo, thanks for that. I haven't used TD enough to need a script for it but I'll definitely file that away for the future.
Nice one 
Yes, you can look into my comment history to see my thoughts on it.

The TD 9 perfect setup is not necessarily the actual buy signal - though it possibly can be (just riskier as I understand it). The safer action is to then do the countdown.
> Any questions, feel free to shoot me a PM.

Saving for later
True. Ideally there would be too much buy pressure and never reach it but just like $3.4k or something. Either way, I am spreading buy orders from like 3k till 5.3k. Might consider a leverage long if we actually go lower than that.

(Again: we might never go below 5.8k - just anticipating different situations.)
I doubt people who have massive unrealized gains at $3,000 will have hands weak enough not to wait for a higher price.
>If we hit $3k now it is for entirely different reasons ie a total lack of interest. Don't underestimate how many people still have life changing gains unrealised, at some point even the strongest hands will crumble.



This, same with stuff like ETH and NEO. A lot of coder friends bought ETH below 5$ for example, they  do not care abut 800 vs 600 but maybe if 400 breaks again it's time to take profit for them
TA on the multi year log chart. If BTC goes under 3k it's literally over bro. 
Some where between 5800 and 6200.

I think. 
I know huh. I’ve noticed myself becoming more of a realist as I’ve aged through my twenties. 
well sure, but that anger has sort of subsided and turned into despondency.

idk, you asked the question man. You literally said why are they not angry now you're asking why I'm saying they're not angry? 
??? how?
BTC is looking rekt as hell, but I'm half-believing the 5.8k bottom :-P If you look at the Eth daily chart, that thing looks like it's making a trajectory to retest the 360 low.  Maybe it will just rekt the ETHBTC ratio, and not drag BTC along as much.  Now that I think about it, if Eth makes a double bottom, that would be a big confirmation for me personally that we are near the bottom bottom.
Lol, you mean an instant 10% drop wasn't enough pain? You sadist.
Why would you buy bitcoin instead of USD? You are trying to preserve value of your money, do you really want to invest in something that lost 70% of its value under 6 months? Before someone says something stupid, no it doesn't matter bitcoin is still up from the last year, those people won't have that kind of time horizon, they can't endure short term risks like this. 

Only reason to buy bitcoin over USD is if your government not letting you buy USD. And both countries are far from that point afaik.
https://coin.dance/volume/localbitcoins

lol, Brazil is actually buying somewhat. Venezuela though..
I'm from Ukraine. Recently our country lost a couple of its parts and our currency lost 70% in 2 years. For quite some time our laws prohibited buying more than 200 USD per day and you couldn't get even that amount legally, because banks would just refuse to sell you even one dollar. The black market thrived though and you could get as many dollars as you need for a 10%-20% premium. There was no functional government, no real army and a lot of well grounded fears that our country will be ripped apart. 

In all that chaos, believe me, nobody was buying bitcoin. They were buying USD. And very few people are buying it right now, despite having zero trust in our government, our currency and our country in general. 

During hard times people need something that is stable, tangible and has stood the test of time in general. Bitcoin is none of those, at least in comparison with USD. 
That’s when things normally don’t happen 
We had 34k at 6800. Number did not change significantly since then.
I don't think this should still be a question tbh.. 
Isn't it technically both? BCH is a fork so any blocks before the fork are shared with BTC if I am not mistaken. I could be wrong but I think that's how it works. Correct me if I’m wrong.


That being said, the "real" Bitcoin is whatever the majority have decided, so therefore BTC is the "real" Bitcoin for all intents and purposes.
I don't think it does. It's still a shitcoin in my eyes but the fact is that it was trading around 400 when it first forked, it's now 700, which means its up 80%. You can't use BTC's price at the split and then use BCH's price now and say it is down. That doesn't make sense.
Sorry bro, it's called Bitcoin Cash. Unless you are calling Bitcoin Gold BGold and Bitcoin Diamond BDiamond you are a hypocrite. 


I think I made a lot of money on that trade. I think I don't care what the point is.
Still a flag - if it doesn't tilt against the bias but instead with its bias, it just performs worse (see flag trading tips in that link).

See also: [http://thepatternsite.com/htf.html](http://thepatternsite.com/htf.html) (notice how the flag need not \*necessarily\*  tilt in a certain direction).
In my opinion, if the "flag" is sloping with the previous move, it negates it. It's not something I would trade and I'd step aside instead. That doesn't mean it can't go further, but I wouldn't rely on it.
Didnt have my screen full, I see what's going on now. 
Nope not my job to back up your claim, post the numbers 

Edit: post the chart that you are telling me to look at
[Here is when Gold ETFS first started popping up](https://prnt.sc/k5k7va). It looks like it was a market that already bottomed and stabilized after the 1980s bubble. But the ETFs were a game-changer for gold.
the etf will be based on solidX so I think it involves real assets.  
Gold went way up when ETF's first introduced but you could argue later ended up suppressing gains.  At least that is what the metal bugs say.
Thanks for the meme response. 

Volume is going to be lower right now because Main Street interest in the market is quite low. 
what do you think is happening? without reading too much into your comment it appears your expecting increasing volume!= increasing price 
"Once every coin but the ones I invested in dies we can go up again"
Okay, I don't really have a strong opinion on the "shitcoin" matter. Let's set that one aside because it wasn't mentioned in your submission, though I doubt that 35 BTC is as liquid as your friend may believe it is. I don't think it's an unfair interpretation then to say that what you really think is that code that creates value out of thin air can be perfectly legitimate - except for the code which you dislike, for whatever reason that may be. Let's address your other points.

What about problems in terms of wealth distribution and a handful of shady right-wing libertarian nutcases having "inordinate amounts of power" if Bitcoin is legitimised. What about the future cryptographic weakness, as you see it, of any crypto-asset?

It is implicit in your submission that you expect these issues to resolve themselves, otherwise you would not think that Bitcoin will ever be ready for an ETF. So how are these obstacles going to go away?

Shitcoins will never die. They'll always be frothing at the margins unless you shut the internet down. 

Natural attrition will take care of the majority. Things like ETFs will push them further into irrelevance. 
Exactly; fractional reserve banking and all of that. Wealth materializes and evaporates inexplicably all the time. That's why immutability matters so much. Investing in this space and not understanding that is...

*Sigh.*
That would hurt the SEC's feelings. 
Lol be honest, theres nothing more painful than watching BTC moon and having your "final margin call" shorting Dash. 

No wonder you would hate an ETF ever because theres a possibility of another bullrun.
Layman won’t be able to purchase here, each share is 25 BTC...
I agree. This is not the time to play margin games. Sideways is not fun when hedging either way.

> I still have a sizable fiat position. I started to accumulate one month ago, when prices touched $6.2k for the first time. Since then I bought every dip, that went below $6.2k and I'll do so for another month or two. I did the same between $160 and $250 in 2014.

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8y6i8u/daily_discussion_thursday_july_12_2018/e29dd67/
Hedge funds are predicting a global recession starting sometime in the next year or two, so that could easily prolong a Bitcoin bear market.
They should have dumped twice. Ethereum pumping may mean some further upside for Bitcoin.
Clearly there's a pattern  here... Looking like a good time to be a 2018 bagholder.
I'm pretty sure they're gonna make out just fine once this is over
Gox bagholders are going to likely get a big payday next year.  Although maybe not big, as BTC will probably be about $3000 by then, if not lower.
Is August 10th for sure? I heard September 15th as dead-line
My understanding is that the application is for something that's more like GBTC and less like an ETF.

The contract size indicates that their probably isn't a lot of crossover in their prospective customers.
Sounds more like a buy the rumor, sell the news event.
>plus 84% of this sub thinks btc is hitting an ATH again

H-ha ha yeah those guys are so funny.... errr i totally d-dont expect new ATH in future. R-ri-right guys?

It seriously makes me question my sanity sometimes, I feel like half the time we are all looking at different charts or something

Regardless of how this plays out, it's refreshing to see a real wall for a change.
I have a question. If there is a buy wall what does it mean? Vice versa if there is a buy wall then there is possibility that the price will go up? 
wall-eater
It’s kind of a chicken and the egg situation. How can we increase liquidity and participation from legitimate institutions if we prevent legitimate institutions from investing? 
it will be great for traders, since we'd be able to hedge with options.  Plus, the FDs would bring in the r/wallstreetbets crowd.
The better question is why piss away your money? You can make a fortune trading this shit WITHOUT leverage
weird OP didn't see 10+ rejections off 6800 and can't afford 20$ extra cushion.
how can buy volume be greater than sell volume? do you just mean market buy volume?

wouldnt that mean price is being suppressed?
Ahhh ok man. Fair enough. Good luck in your trade :)

Yes, for sure.  Any genuine bad news is called "FUD" or perverted that it's actually good for Bitcoin.  If an exchange gets hacked, yes the price can drop 5% or 15%, but the exchange will thenl have better security in the future, so it's actually good.  It is nonsense, but some people's brains just don't work very well.
No, FUD is shitposting GOBLINTOWWN etc with no substance
Thanks for taking the time to get all of this down. It's much appreciated.  Definitely some nuggets in here I have overlooked, and some that have fallen out of favour (have stopped looking at my BBand chart of late and havn't been checking L:S ratio) ; cheers for the reminder and all round quality reply.
Look at weekly averages of 24hr volume to get an idea of what the normal volume range is (back in dec, volume got as high as 100,000 on gdax and now the average is within 5-25k or so) and from there look at the percentage change in volume with a trend (BXD sees a large percentage increase in volume --> strong trend/ small percentage increase in volume --> weak trend)
Hey sorry dude didnt want to catch a nerve :) i was just stating a general trading fact, had nothing to do with you and had nothing to do with 6200 or any other number.

Nah, im not buying anymore :)

I've been doing this 5 years as my primary source of income, I always am either in &#37;100 or out &#37;100.

You guys can fuck around with multiple entries and exits, cost averaging and all that shit, I don't want to over complicate things. Keep it simple stupid.
I'm sure you great at accurately and consistently predicting bottoms, another self proclaimed oracle in our midst. 
Lev is big, You could've taken some profits above 6.2 and just ride it out until 6k breaks...
The trendline has been thoroughly violated if you are trying to extend if from the feb bottom: https://imgur.com/a/zylPPZR

Also, probably bad practice to cut a massive wick like that on a volume climax bottom.

Only way that line is valid is if you just connect the April low to the June low, and then you only have 2 touches.
Apprx $11,000,000 per day in sell pressure assuming 100% of coins mined each day are sold.
Panic selling does miners no good if they're selling below the cost of equipment plus elec.

Had no idea, thanks. Doesn't this sort of defeat the general purpose of OTC though? Maybe I'm misunderstanding 
I’m fairly certain that tether isn’t included in the calculation. Again, the wording in the Notice on this point isn’t at all straightforward. 
[like this?](https://i.imgur.com/WfJJdtb.png)

It doesn't match that well but its closer to what I'm expecting.  I'm surprised we haven't seen more bull traps this time.
I am aware of that.

However, as a developer, I understand that not everybody sets their servers and charts to the exact same times.

TradingView defaults to UTC it looks like... but cryptowat.ch uses my local time which is UTC+5 or something like that.

My main question was what does it matter when different charts use different timezones essentially.
According to which chart? And what time is that exactly? UTC 0:00?
Thank you. Awesome answer :)
>Guys what should I put on my chart (trading view via Binance) to see these? Thanks
I just missed my 6120 entry on perps. Hoping to catch on the next one.

I'm not necessarily confident that the potential head and shoulders will play out. 

In fact, I even mentioned in my original post that I don't think it will. 

This is purely a risk vs reward entry. 

More likely than not, there will be some kind of upward movement before this dumps below $6,000. Could be 2%, could be 10%. 

I'm taking a long position here essentially with a stance of, "this next move up will probably be nothing. But if I'm wrong, I want to be on the right side of it."
There can be multiple heads, but yes, it's a bit of stretch to call IHS now. But we dropped from 6.8, no bounces in between and it wasn't done in one leg, it was $100 move per leg. This should bounce somewhere and this is the best spot there is to make it happen, also because there is a IHS developing.
I believe he was asking for more than the order book, cryptowatch has almost none of the features bfxdata had
I read this sub almost every day.  I see very few reasons cited for a decrease in price for years.  The focus is mostly much shorter timeframes.  I would love to hear why you expect Bitcoin to likely be priced lower than these levels five years from now.
> Because of all the reasons cited in this sub, day after day, by myself

And why do you do this?

So in other words some other long-term parabolic advance (or decline)? Because if it isn’t linear, then it’s parabolic.

False. There are zero genders. 
Good news is generally not decoupled during bull runs but you have a point about the timing of the effect of bad news vs good news.  The Great Bear Winter had so much good news coupled with negative price action that we had a meme in my household- "Good news = price going down". Accordingly, I was too euphoric to pay attention to bad news during the last bull run to my own detriment.
Amazing if you don't actually want to own the alts. Your portfolio will grow and shrink depending on their performance, but you don't actually own the alts and cannot export them. You have to convert to BTC, LTC, or USD in order to export. Still a great so though in my opinion. Just did a credit card purchase to see if I get my 3% back for online purchases. 

Edit: card got declined by Citi Bank. Also I tried to do a test of $100 and it would've charged me a $13 fee. So not 8%.
The decline has slowed to a crawl even percentage wise. Volume has dropped off massively AKA people aren't selling much anymore. The moment buying interest kicks in again, this thing is going up. There aren't enough sellers left. The price going down doesn't mean the price is going to go down forever. 
> But let's just focus on the recent spike

That's all they have at this point, and they don't really even have that.  These are the signs of madness when someone is trapped and no way out.
Oh we may very well go below $6k. My point is: triple bottom on 12h, no bad news, plenty of good news, larger adoption and ecosystem (it's not 2014!), nobody thinks "boy, this Bitcoin is a scam, sell and exit forever", everybody thinks "I want to buy back in at a lower price". Now if it does go lower - markets are irrational after all - I'd be disappointed, for sure. But it's an interesting experiment in human psychology.
There's a difference between 'it won't' and 'it may not'.
You know what 'may' means, right?

You weren't in red then ;)
Still he held through it. There's a difference between going 1x on mex and selling. Selling is easier, you don't see red.
I just wanted to point out that any position is hard. You can still long the bounces and get out with profit, but it's hard.

I'm out of trying to find the bottom until at least mid-to-low 5k.
What timeframe do you think I'm talking about? 

Edit: always bullish long term, doesn't mean I don't want to get the best price 
I mean I left out the part where bulls go full herd mentality and scoff at anyone with a different opinion. Not saying either side is right, but both def aren't innocent either 
Yeah $1500 is just ridiculous 
*Looks at the past 6 months*
Finally lol
It's a doggy dog world out here so your politeness is a real blessing in the skies
You're seeing what you want to see. Go and compare the sentiment today to the daily threads of 2014. The sentiment is awful right now in almost every bitcoin and alt subreddit, especially when there's even a 5% dip. There were those in 2014's bottom that called for the next bull run as well, go look up intuit on trading view who correctly called the 2014 bottom at that time. There will always be bulls, no matter what. 
But... what. The links worked. You need to update or something. 
Bolding requires special characters right? ** if I'm not mistaken, and the bot probably uses regex. * is a character in regex and requires escaping (by typing '/*') and it's probably setup to handle such exceptions yet.
I'm with you now, with it being the setup.  To push your extrapolation further, I think it's possible to argue that linked chart shows a perfect 9-13-9 buy (one additional 1-9 sequence beyond the 13 you show).
> Either way, I am spreading buy orders from like 3k till 5.3k.

Sounds reasonable.
Why are you under some assumption that there has to be a higher price?
Since mining 1 BTC in China costs roughly $3,3k and the price will grow every months, there is no way on earth Bitmain and a lot of other people is going to let that happen. I think even exchanges are going to work against the decay of Bitcoin. The industry and money relying on Bitcoin is just too big and there is too much money on the sidelines from these players that are not going to let their sole source of income die.
Might want to check the definitions of "literally" and "over"... 
It could easily break that trend and form a new one, just slower. 
Haha now you've made me feel even older! Anyway:
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depressive_realism
You frequently make up false narratives. If bulls have no reason to be angry yet, why are you fairly sure lots of people would get extremely angry sub $5k? How are you coming to this conclusion?
Most of eths downward movements were following btc, I doubt eth matters
> both countries are far from that point afaik.

What are you basing that on?
Even if the government is not letting you buy USD, you just go and buy it on the black market, which is usually very developed and convenient in poor/unstable countries. 
Good to keep in mind. I distinctly remember a post from (last week?) about how we were all but certain to break 7k.
Got it
Yeah, my point is that they should've benefited much more from the "air drop". 

Either they're *not* the real Bitcoin and they get to claim they're *up* from they're initial price of four or five -hundred something.

OR

They *are* the real Bitcoin and they're down a ton YoY *AND* they're being fucked over by some alt newcomer named Beetcoin that is consistently worth 10x more and is now 3x the chain length.

It's shitty no matter how they spin it. I'm eagerly awaiting the Aug 1 anniversary celebrations in a few weeks. What a year! :)
It absolutely makes sense. Bitcoin Cash was a contentious forks. The whole idea was to gain the network and market ASAP and become "Satoshi's true vision" or whatever the new marketing slogan is.

Now, a year later, nothing has happened and as time goes on the prospects of *anything* happening diminish. Bitcoin is approaching 4x the total chain length. 10-15x by next year this time. 

**Bitcoiners** (i.e. people who were minding their own business holding coins anytime from year 2009 to July 31, 2017) either saw "the real Bitcoin" go up in value a lot or go down in value a lot in the intervening time.

BCashers can't have it both ways. Either it's an alt and it can be measured against itself OR it's the real Bitcoin and should be measured against the dominant chain. 

Everything else is just BCash propaganda spin. 

But yes, if you're saying that someone who bought Aug 1 at the very low and sold today, they would be up 80%. That's not the point I'm making though. I'm talking about the performance of the asset against its network and user distribution prior to fork, which is the meaningful measure of success of one coin versus the other. Otherwise, you could say that Tron and Dentacoin and a bunch of other shitcoins are also beating Bitcoin, but that doesn't really make sense. 
Lmao, watch this!

*BGold (BTG) is a worthless shitcoin*

*BDiamond (BTD) is a flaming pile of shit*

*BCash is a scammy pump and dump cancer on the world*

See how I just don't give a fuck? *All* those coins are just shitcoin alts.
I identify sexually as a non shitcoin, respect me, you normieeeeesssss
Who the hell cares what any of these scam forks are called.  Bgold, Bdiamond, Bcash, Btrash.. unimportant.
It’s just quicker to type out. Honestly, why do people make such a big deal out of this?
How about you tell this to your dick less cultists friends who come here with their very pathetic “Bitcoin core” attempt 
You could make a lot of money trading anything. The point is that BCash is a shitcoin, clearly. 

You think you don't care about the point, but you also just don't seem to understand the difference between the health and quality of an asset, versus the potential gains you make by trading something at the right moments. 


More like volume down means unwillingness to keep participating in the current trend. It's one indication of trend reversal and consolidation. But could consolidate and keep going down with expanding volume. It's just something to keep in mind though.
volumes are at record lows not seen since the $1600s, so i anticipate meaningful volume and volatility coming soon, but obviously you can't predict the direction. 
It won't go away by itself, and it may take a very long time. Could take a decade long bear market where whales lose faith, or it could take quantum computing breaking BTC and us moving to a new version starting all over... who knows.
The whole concept of shitcoins really came into the limelight only a year ago, so saying that they will "never die" seems a bit premature. 

Regardless, the public doesn't know the difference between "investing" in BTC and """"investing"""" in EOS/OMG/GMCN or whatever shitcoins there are. They consider the them equal, or near equal, under the cryptocurrency umbrella. This can't be more far from the truth, and before we let the public throw vast amounts of money at BTC, we need to ensure that they are educated about what they're getting into.
He's a whiny bitch who doesn't want us to get ours
Makes 0 sense because bull runs are free money 
That happened I think a year or two ago. My current portfolio is worth over 3x what it was at that point... Lol xD
It's less about the ETF itself and more about the government approving it.
we dont know how or if a global recession would affect cryptos. 
True. I was just making the point that as goxxed bagholder myself, 2014-16 was a tortuous time to be a bagholder. Sentiment was much worse than it is now too
https://bitcoinist.com/3-reasons-sec-bitcoin-etf-next-month/

You're right, could be September - August 10th is the **earliest** this gets done, though.

I think it's much more likely we'll get a decision by then, however. 
GBTC has always had a hefty premium.  Im not sure that if something better came along, the premium would disappear or maybe something worse. 
Thanks tho )
Ofcourse, just like the CBOE Futures in December. At the very least the anticipation leading up to the ETF may be enough to stop the bear market. I don't think the market is going to go parabolic though, itll be bullish, and will correct once the ETF lands, and then go parabolic over the coming year
lmao I'm not ragging on anyone who believes it...just saying if  people are trading sentiment then they shouldn't expect a reversal until that 84% moves down quite a bit
Yes, of course it's not going to be super accurate and I'm mainly just being a little dingus
This actually can be replaced by 'long-time holder' ;)

bro, I have been hedged (on average) +/- 11k (so you are obviously the better trader), but you cannot just post random calls (whether it be 100k or 2.7k) without providing any reasoning to back up your claims. It makes you look like a bear troll (at best) or someone who thinks he can influence market sentiment via reddit (at worst).

>  and the lowest I've called in 2.7k.

sorry if my memory was wrong, don't have time to search your post-history, I remember you making 1k bitcoin calls (possibly my memory might have blended you together with the /u/boglihead and /u/blackliberteriangayguy crew making ultra-bearish claims with nothing to back it up); my memory might have been wrong, but the fact remains, you don't provide any reasoning to your claims -- a couple hours ago you even posted just the number "2700" without even taking the effort to write a full sentence. This is not how a trading subreddit/community works where people want to exchange ideas.
HAHAHA WEED FUNNY

Haha thanks
hahhahahahaha xD xD xD
Yeah, but I think she's on her period
No it's not. 

In Chinese, 6 and 8 are considered lucky. 

4 is unlucky. 
I think this wall is a short closing.
... aand it's gone.
For the past six months we haven't had very many real walls on the buy side. Sure we've had hidden ones and spoofs, but rarely any straight up honest walls.

Vamp has a point that it's just someone opening or closing a position, but we're seeing something similar at bitmex too.
It doesn't mean anything. Someone is either closing or opening big position.
True!
I hope it does if only for the memes
Yeah, I know. 

I do YOLO 100x trades very rarely, and sometimes they work out, sometimes they don't. Most of my trading stack was built using 5x at most.


When I see a big volume and a down-bar closing on the high, I consider that candle buy volume, a bit like the way Accum/Dist Line indicator is calculated. Expecting at least sideways / some bounce here.

(I might be wrong)

When I'm short, I hate seeing BTC bouncing and erasing my profits


But I still should have placed my limit buy order around 0.618 retracement. That exit wasn't ideal. (~1% loss)

I guess that's hindsight too. Didn't expect this kind of immediate bounce/rejection
*whoosh*
Unfortunately it's not an isolated phenomenon. Paranoid "libertarian" (aka hatefully selfish sore losers) types are highly attracted to crypto. Its genuinely disruptive democracy makes them feel powerful in a way their personal lives don't allow for, I imagine.

No, FUD is Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt.

People do have a bad habit of spreading FUD without good reason ("China banned crypto so now Bitcoin is dead!"). That doesn't mean that ALL FUD is invalid. Just the baseless FUD. 
Cheers Bro. Appreciate it!
An investment bank, haha, this dude still lives in his parents basement playing around with $10

Those with money do not shout about it, those without money are the vocal ones pretending to be members of mysterious organisations 
Lol
Some wisdom there, I think.

Of course, imo going all in means you have to settle for closing on smaller movements and keep tight rein over greed (e.g. if you decide to sell 50BTC at $6300, be happy with buying back at $6000 - don't wait and hope for $5800). The bigger the risk, the less room for impulsivity or emotion. At least, I think that's true. 
Lets see where we are in 24 hours. 
It looks like horizontal support is still there. We should see the price breaking down without much of a push if it wasn't.

IMO, the market is waiting for alts to decouple from Bitcoin before it will go up.

It allows you to trade any amount directly with someone at half the rate of a market order without slippage.

Its really just an escrow service for large orders.
Yeah basically *that*. Pretty similar except that the bounce up to 10K was less impressive than the equivalent in 2014. 

Is there a reason you're not using a log scale though?
It shouldn't matter. That's part of the reason I chop wicks so often when I'm looking at the daily, too.
The indicator is called Relative Strength Index, then you can go on babypips and learn about the the indicator and what divergences are. Good luck

> Good news is generally not decoupled during bull runs

Bull runs are news neutral. They don't care. They're going to happen anyway unless something genuinely catastrophic occurs. 
I really hope this gem of an exchange will get adopted hard. I’m truly amazed  
you're making a massive assumption that for some reason people are going  to start buying more than they're selling again
> The moment buying interest kicks in again, this thing is going up.

Yes very true that the moment that people start buying enough to push the price up, then the price will go up.  In the meantime, the price will likely continue to drop farther and farther.
yes 
> doesn't mean I don't want to get the best price

Do you think this desire to get a good price perhaps influences how you think about the markets in short-medium term?

edit: what timeframe do you think the bulls you mentioned are talking about?
Man, I think $1,500 might happen dude bro. 
I love you. 
in 2014/2015 people were worried btc was dead/done forever. we'd have to hit like $2k for sentiment to get that bad 
What are you talking about? I was around for 2014. People were shitting themselves a lot of them time. All I see is tons of hopium and **again**, look at the shorts:long ratio. There is very little short squeeze potential on this. Volume is dried up. The next move will almost certainly be a significantly leg down.

RemindMe! "1 week"
I think it may be the case that price isn't number when you add * on the end so it has problem with it, don't think that leading * is a problem.
I'm not seeing the second setup after the countdown ends, but it's certainly close. I think there's 1 or 2 candles that  *just* close above the close 4 before. You're talking about the second descent from 310 to 220 just before the parabola at the start of the bull run, right?
Lol if you held through Gox's bullshit  i doubt you're that impatient and easily moved by massive fluctuations. You're talking about people that have massive unrealized gains at $3000.

As long as there is an ETF hopium for another bullrun these people can afford to hold.
pretty simple: fiat inflation + halvening + bitcoin wallets getting lost all the time

assuming demand stays the same

I’d say a technical breakdown of a 8 year logarithmic uptrend this early on in the life of a completely speculative vehicle justified the use of figuratively using “over” and “literally”

> You frequently make up false narratives.

What false narrative have I made up? o_O

I think that the anger has turned primarily into despondency because no real new lows have been made. new lows = fresh bitterness.

not really a crazy prediction...idk I'm just guessing man. sorry if I upset you by guessing what will happen
actually ETH chart is a lot cleaner than BTC's imo.
I have investments in Turkey, not that confident about Brazil, only know from the news.
As long as we just keep thinking stuff it'll stay in a $500 range forever 
That is very true lmao. Never really considered that. Personally I have to say that they are not the real BTC so therefore they are up over the past year. However that makes sense due to the massive Nov-Dec bull run we had, ALL the coins went up. 


In fact, being up *only* 80% since August is kinda shitty when compared to most alts afaik
I agree with you, and I prefer bch over btc.
What a load of crap
But like.. BCash is CSW’s original vision man...
Each BCH appears to be worht almost .11 BTC. And each BTG .0042 (enough to a round for everyone at the bar). I'll take yours for free though, since they are worthless.
I agree that they don't belong in the daily. Which is why I'm not sure why this dude is posting about them.
All of those are versions of bitcoin that can be compared. most are indeed trash, bitcoin gold, for example. 

bitcoin cash is not. we know this objectively despite you and your astroturf partners trying to gaslight and spread misinformation by any means. 

Bitcoin Cash is the version of bitcoin that still can be used as p2p digital cash and the version that has a scaling plan, on-chain. It's also the version that is available to thousands of merchants via BitPay. 

You can even shop on Amazon and save 15% using BCH via Purse.io
Not sure if you're serious, but in case you are. The reason why they care so much is because the name and branding is the one thing that they can lie to people about to distinguish themselves from other alt coins. 

Bitcoin is a singular chain and network though, it even says so in the white paper. BCash is an alt and using its "*other*" name is fraudulent and misleading marketing and would be stopped by regulators if this space were regulated. 
I mean this gypsytoy guy is clearly putting a lot of effort into this post, you know, italicizing his letters, emboldening them, for style etc.
* I care for Bitcoin, hence why I hold BTC + BCH.

* I care for trading maximum gains, so I can become a better supporter of Bitcoin.

* Rinse and repeat.
This guy betas
You say that time is all that is needed for legitimacy; I don't think time can resolve the fundamental negative issues that you see because all of these were set in stone at the very beginning.

Any limited-supply crypto is always going to have a Gini coefficient comparable to North Korea. Satoshi's supply issuance model guarantees this, even if we assume Satoshi's coins are locked away forever. Early adopters (or "hoarders", rather than adopters) have weathered a decade of sharp ups and downs already - whales losing faith is extremely unlikely. And even if that happens, you will still have the 2009-2010 whales who remain loyal to the ideology and hence loyal to the network; you will never get rid of all the early hoarders - and how are you to tell whether an old address with thousands of coin represents a lost private key or a patient hoarder?

As for the "security model can be broken" argument, there will always be an increased probability of failure as computing power and encryption-breaking methods develop if the cryptographic algorithm remains unchanged. That is the nature of any digital asset. If quantum comes along and crypto is proofed against that, you can be damned sure something else is going to come along later. Where is the threshold for you where this risk is low enough for Joe Average to put money in?

Anyway, I suppose I just find your argument difficult to understand. You put together two sharply contrasting viewpoints (mutually exclusive, in my opinion) without a plausible explanation for how these can be resolved. You're fundamentally bearish, but still bullish. It does not make sense. My opinion is that if you follow your arguments through to their logical end, you'll find you're either a bear or a hypocrite :P.

"Shitcoins" and you include one of the only coins with an actual history of hitting development targets and is backed by a real company that is a significant player in their industry. You opinion is worse than meaningless
> so saying that they will "never die" seems a bit premature.

Ponzi schemes are as old as greed. They're painfully obvious with countless examples. People still delude themselves into lapping them up. 

As long as there is cryto there will be shitcoins. The legit stuff should be separating itself from them and making it clear there is a difference in play. ETFs are one aspect of that. Regulated exchanges rejecting them another. 

Waiting for them to go away is daffy. They're only going to grow from here. 

There's nothing stopping you from writing 'dollar' on toilet paper right now. Because of the wider acceptance of real dollars and all the framework surrounding it, no one will be interested. 
Are you kidding me? Premined litecoin clones - typically meme coins - were the cream of the crop for shitcoins. 
Not when you lost a ton of money and all your BTC. Just read the guy's post which is quite famous around here. That was all his savings and plus he gained debt if i recall. 

How can you profit off a bull run when you lost everything hence the famous "final margin call" post.
It’s more about you wanting to buy in cheaper if you’re honest ;) 
We don't *know*, but it's a reasonable assumption that people sell all of their speculative assets.

And if my assumption turns out to be true, can we stop referring to btc as a store of value?

Cryptocurrencies aren't a safe haven unless you live in somewhere like Venezuela.
Sounds like people are fantasizing too much about a bull market. This bubble still has a lot of unwinding and stabilizing to do imo.
Public is calling crypto an outright scam, a ponzi, especially those that have FOMO'd into it last year, and got burnt, then sold in a loss and left the place, so I'd say the sentiment is already really bad for cryptocurrencies, not sure how much bad you want it to be, that 84&#37; are those opinion WHO ARE STILL in the place, which isn't that many. I'm not really to bring out Social Media platforms, but twitter, facebook, popular streaming services such and youtube, and twitch are also filled with people who make fun of Crypto believers, and whoever mentions it, gets pounded real hard. So I'd say its pretty much a dead case already to the public. 
Why? I've actually given that some thought now, because I thought it was true, too. Maybe you should also ask if they are in fiat/hedged or not. Just because they believe it will reach new ATH's doesn't necessarily mean they are in coin or are buying right now so that poll might not reflect the current price. Also, I bet that 84% probably hasn't changed since 20k and we've gone up and down all over the place. And we'll probably bottom out somewhere still with 84% that believe that. Why does the bottom need to have everyone believe that it just won't recover?
Tbh i think until there isnt an ETF those numbers will remain high because of hopium. Imagine if this trend happened AFTER an ETF came out. There would be little to no hype inducing events aside from halvenings that can trigger a bullrun. That number would drop by a lot.
Yeah, I voted yes but am 100% fiat. Market cycle and the such....Was there a time constraint on the poll I missed?
Ok and allow me to genuinely congratulate you on taking all of the abuse head on over these many months. Brilliant short, held firmly, from the 11k range. That was neither an easy call nor easy to hold on to.  Very. Good. Stuff. 

To the survey, my only issue was that there was no time frame as to “when”.  Now I suspect  the objective was to measure current sentiment, but as with far too many surveys there is just as much confirmation bias baked in given the question posed. 

Trade well Sloppy

lol
fair enough, and thanks for the reply.  i look at this market through a macro lens and it's always been pretty obv the runnup  in december was partially fueled by ICO speculation and the "can't miss money" that was going to come in through the futures market.  

looking at how much money is still in alts, tether risk(i know, it's fud, lol), and the constant negativity coming out of msm outlets, I think bitcion still has a ways to go before bottoming out.  

I think in the past I've thrown out the 1k number as the worst of worst case scenarios, but I do think a bottom happening in the 2.7-4.7k range is going to happen.  I'm planning on closing my short out at around 5k, and setup buys in that range.

My indicators have always been NVT, mayer multiple, BTC dominance ratio, and comparing this runnup/deflation to previous boom/busts of the past with BTC.
This plus bitmex? Maybe, still might lighten some heavy bags on this sub.
Yes and now half that stack is gone because u gambled. Used to do it myself. Not worth it at all. Its a good way to get stuck and fuck u up emotionally
Yeah, I think a lot of people here expected that after 6300 will immediately come 6000. Will see how it goes. I will hold my short for now.
FUD, as a meme, is a figurative device which conveys baseless fear, uncertainty or doubt, not a literal acronym.  Just because a piece bad news could cause one to be fearful, uncertain, or doubtful doesn't make it FUD if it is true, IMO. That's just bad news but hey we're both right because words have many meanings and the crowd decides these things. I'll keep my definition.
> the less room for impulsivity or emotion.

5 years of gains and losses have made me rather indifferent to my feelings regarding my trades. I feel anyone that wants to succeeded at this cannot be impulsive or emotional. 
I have support just above 6k. This is going down without bounces. If it's going to bounce it'll do it hard and violently.

Awesome, thanks! Didn't  know that 
You're right I should be using log scale.  I didn't realize the website had an option for that.
Dammit I knew you were coming and you came before I could even fix it.
maybe I'm confused but I remember bfxdata had a ton more data on longs/shorts, funding rates, etc
Lol ! Think u should go back to starcraft
Seriuously? Back to the beginning please and read up on the technology :) maybe want to check out whats happening in Venezuela aswell if you are already at it.
assuming that claim is true, you can say the same about 50 pounds of gold bullion. it’s still valuable to certain people. 
It becomes less and less useful every day as more countries ban it, restrict it, over tax it.  As the remaining few companies stop accepting it.
crypto infrastructure is actually growing extremely rapidly. i don't see why the development is being done if experts don't think there will be increased usage and adoption in a long term.

I do think we'll see $4.5k before September 
I think we are in agreement: So you are saying causation is decoupled during bull trends and I am saying correlation is positive but agree causation is decoupled or perhaps inverse, until the trend changes. In other words the trend wins until fundamentals (as reported by news) can no longer be ignored by the market.
This is a market with an asset valued at just over $6k. Therefore, there are buyers. Right now, we have massive indications that seller interest is low and waning. All it takes is for the buyer interest to rise above the seller interest. There doesn't need to be a reason other than the market doing its thing.
So why reminder?
Nope, I switch back and forth often when I play the bounces. If I see an opportunity, whether it's up or down, I will take it, and base those decisions off my own TA. I follow the money and keep open an objective mind regardless of position.
Depends on who you talk too, people were calling 6800 the reversal so that sounds like being bullish on the short, mid, and long term to me. I'm still just bearish for the short run and do believe we are close to finding a bottom.
A fellow bro dude guy man!
There were certainly many existential posts back then from what i'm reading. People calling the whole thing a sham, a fantasy etc. We're not seeing this today, and there's generally well founded optimism for the future that's based in reality which is why I don't think its fair to compare this price action to 2014. We will not see a 85%+ correction and I wouldn't be surprised if we're near the bottom already.
I'm only basing what I am saying on what I'm reading in the dailies of 2014-2015. I didn't say there wont be another leg down, perhaps a significant leg down but I think it will be the final leg down. My entire post's point is that we're relatively close to the bottom.
Yep, should be the ** in the end. I can strip the * char to fix bolds and italic. 
if you held through gox's bullshit you're also up potentially 6000%. That's a lot of money to watch get burned
You are talking about private miners though, yes they can just quit. But companies like Bitmain who built entire mining farms and rely solely on bitcoins price staying above a certain point wont let that slip away and wait for other people to give up mining. When 300 BTC (e.g. 2 million USD) can drop the price $300-400 do you really think they wont take advantage of that?

Even Blockstream would probably jump in if we reach prices like this.
In 2014, Bitcoin broke every trendline you could throw at it. Its a bubble pop - it's likely to continue breaking all trendlines and begin anew when we bottom out, just as Bitcoin and other bubbles usually do.
Justifiably using literally figuratively?
Maybe. I guess we'll find out. Just saying, Bitcoin always finds ways to confound.

I have been reading this sub for awhile and have seen you do it often. I'm not going to take the time to go through your posts.

Got it, I have zero experience in Turkey specifically. So, if I have like $2,000 USD worth of Turkish currency, it would be simple, safe, and inexpensive to convert into USD? What is the premium and who do you buy from? Is it legal?

edit: forgot to ask, but would it be easy and legal to get it out of the country?
Nope. If we stay in a $500 range for another 40 days the LOG down trend will be broken. Some may call this for-ever...
They got the benefit of existing distribution though. So it's not exactly fair to consider Aug 1 its birthday. 

The correct answer is that the BCash is an alt coin that started in 2009. Any coins on BCash blockchain are not compatible or interoperable with the Bitcoin blockchain, so as soon as it forked off and succumbed to being the minority chain, it became its own network. Just because the coins were basically air dropped on Bitcoiners, doesn't mean that the chain itself is Bitcoin or a version of Bitcoin.

FFS, the white paper that these idiots cite nonstop discusses consensus and longest chain explicitly. Convenient how they ignore that though.
That doesn't make any sense. My point is that Bitcoin is defined as such in the white paper and BTrash is an alt. 

Prefering one over the other has nothing to do with the fact that only one is actually Bitcoin. The other is just another shitcoin alt.

Go shill BTrash somewhere else. Or better yet, go suck Roger off and beg him to keep pumping and spreading fake propaganda. 
How so?
Yeah, each subsequent fork is/was worth less and less. It's almost like the whole scheme was a big hype nothingburger. 

If you can't see the pattern and implication, I can't really help you. 

I couldn't care less that BCash is still worth *something*. The point is that it's a failure as a sustainable long term project. It was from the get go too. Also, contentious forks are attacks on Bitcoin, so they're bad in that regard too.
LMAO the desperate last gasps of BCash before it's back under .1

Begging people to use a credit card fraud service? 

Wow, bro. You're certainly making a new personal low.
I think it’s clear which camp spreads misinformation and brigades subs. Have fun with your altcoin but there is a thread for that.
Wait til Roger reads all of this and starts BitcoinCash-realbitcoin-markets
Oh *gawd*, the *hours* I *slaved* away **italicizing** the *font*! My *hands* are so *chafed*!
Maybe he’s just doing it to annoy you then idk
BCash is not Bitcoin. That's my point. Go read the white paper. One chain, one network, most PoW, etc. It's all written in the sacred document that BCash shills hold forever dear to their heart. 

I don't know why you're trying to argue. I never said you can't make money from trading volatile, low liquidity shitcoins. That has nothing to do with my point. My point is about the **health of the assets themselves**, not a traders performance on one instrument versus another. 

Even if the creation/ubiquity of shitcoins increases, I'm sure there will come a point where public awareness about *what* a shitcoin is and how to avoid it will increase at a faster rate. That's what I'm looking for in order to really want an ETF to happen - that's when it'll be safe.
Well that's kind of retarded but bull runs are even more retarded. He could just Yolo long and make a fuck ton of money. a proper ETF would really be free money for most of us 

when I look back at 2016-2017 the whole thing is monstrously stupid. how anyone who joined before summer of 2017 isn't retardedly rich is beyond me 
One kid's comment on an SEC website isn't going to move the price... and if it can, then BTC has failed already
wasn't that the same... 2 -3 years ago? when drop from 1200 to ... 500 -600$- BTC was death etc etc.
exactly...? And sentiment is high among market participants who are *already bought in.* 

You just explained exactly why I think this is a disaster waiting  to happen. 

Public not interested but people already bought in have high hopes still. no new money but sentiment is high...price continues to fall 
yes that would probably be better. My point mainly is that sentiment is janky af
No :P

Just trying to prove a point about "sentiment" here really
That's fair, although I genuinely intended on it  being that way. it wasn't meant to be a short term sentiment indicator actually, I was curious to see how many people really think it will hit an ATH ever *again*. 

And thank you haha. It really has been tough at some points. Tbf I did close and re open it but in the end I'm basically in roughly the same spot profits wise as I was in April. a bit more now

But thanks mate. You too 
Which is why you never trade more than you can afford to lose.
I don't think I'm highly emotional or impulsive, but I'd be kidding myself to say I don't have room for improvement in that area. Kudos to your success! 

(Not being sarcastic / saying you're kidding yourself btw! I'm just new and have very minimal fledgling skillz) 
We all have different interpretations of this situation :D
not true. gold actually has many use cases outside of being a store of value.

More than welcome. I could buy a pallet or two of beer on account of your advice thus far ;p 
Seven percent, nice. Best buzz starts at 8.0 tho
I'm curious about which massive indicators are telling you this.
>  Therefore, there are buyers.

..at lower and lower prices.
[deleted]
Something negative to look back on in 10 years and (hopefully) laughing about a small bubble pop along the way 
having a general sense that price can go up at any time is not blind optimism when the price history shows an incredible growth rate YoY.  A bullish sentiment has generally obliterated bearish sentiment over the last 8 years - flip your perspective.
*fist bump*
> My entire post's point is that we're relatively close to the bottom.

Yeah and my entire point is that I dispute that. 

I mentioned this in another comment but 2014 (and 2011) was concurrent with sky high inflation. 

Everything looks pretty bad for Bitcoin right now and the fact that everyone is expecting a rebound off of 5K makes me suspect that the beatings will continue until morale worsens.
Man you have no idea what I'm talking about. I'm not even suggesting that Bitcoin can't go to 1k. Just that if it does, an 8 year uptrend is over. 8 years. That's much longer than a bubble cycle in this market lol. The end of an 8 year uptrend basically spells the end of a purely speculative asset. 
:p do I really, though? or do the replies to me sound upset

I don't even get what is upsetting people about my comment...I'm just trying to answer the question. none of it was even very polarizing
block me then lol I don't get why you guys subject yourself to reading my stuff if you don't like it. if you think it's bullshit just block me

I'd feel a lot worse if we were at like $13k and I'd been super wrong but.....ahem.....yea........
Then don't go through the time to respond to their posts, jeez. Calm down. 
Why would it not be legal? You can purchase TRY from your bank, its not different than purchasing EUR.
The first log downtrend was already broken, only to be redrawn (or shifted over depending on how you do it). 40 days puts us just before the end of August, still too soon (imo) for knuckleheads like me to up and quit. 
So, for the sake of argument. Suppose that I create an altcoin with an entirely new chain, but copy over the balances from the current block height of the bitcoin chain. Then my altcoin was started in 2009?

What if I also copy the transaction history?

What if do all that in a ethereum contract?
How can you make that comparison, are you really that desperate?
I only care about making money. I'm not in it for some gay ass idealogical crusade. I couldn't care less which completely speculative magic internet money is attacking which other completely speculative magic internet money as long as I make money.
*Bitcoin is the real Bitcoin Cash (BTC)!!* 

*Just as it's outlined in Jihan's white paper!*

*BCH is NOT Bitcoin Cash!!! Bitcoin is Bitcoin Cash (BTC)!!* 


Extra paint from Lowe's for **bolding** ... Man these cashie bcashers...
Leave this shit in /r/bitcoin please.
It'll never be safe. Just because alts are easy to manipulate doesn't mean btc isn't. With ETF we will see more money to push around the market. It's as safe as it will ever be.
\>when I look back at 2016-2017 the whole thing is monstrously stupid. how anyone who joined before summer of 2017 isn't retardedly rich is beyond me

You need money to make money. Not everyone has $10,000 to $30,000+ lying around to place in a highly volatile asset; especially since majority of the demographics for crypto investors are young men lol.

Take my case for example, i started investing in BTC back when ButterflyLabs promised to release the Jalapeno ASIC Miners and ColoredCoins for BTC was supposed to be the cool thing not Ethereum.

Did I make a good amount of money with the BTC i bought then? Yes but was it life changing money? Not really. Probably a year or so of my salary now. Why? because i was at college then and didnt have much money to put in it. That was $220 to $640 BTC. A simple 10x at the current price.

I only started putting large amounts in June 2017 after i graduated and received my inheritance. So I imagine a lot of people didnt experience really really life changing money despite being in before 2017.

TLDR: The people who got insanely rich from BTC after Gox were already rich. There are a few exceptions of course.
He didnt just buy and hold though. He kept shorting Dash with all his money until he got into debt. 

His short was underwater but he just kept adding to it. You know what happened next lol. He could have shorted dogecoin if possible and still have lost everything.
Doesnt stop you from trying though. Similar to how certain altcoiners keep shilling their coin despite how unlikely the price will be affected by people reading his shill comments. 

 Dont get me wrong im wishing for BTC to plummet too but being the "final margin call" guy just makes your intentions slightly uhh dubious to me. No offense. 


But at which point are you measuring the -$600? Because the people that bought at $500 prior to the descent to ~$150 felt very different than the people who bought at $500 after that same contraction. I wish I had exchange level data to see how many that bought at $500 sold at $400/$300/$200 just before the final turn around.
While I also see the possibility of lower prices such as *5k or lower*  happening due to the lack of interest, I'm  cautious. Cryptocurrencies are the wild west of financial markets, its the playground of the Wealthy people who are milking newbie clueless investors. So one might ask, why would they crash the market totally if it will not bring new money in. Liquidity is pretty thin, assuming most of the walls on both buy and sell side are spoofers, so a move in both direction could be devastating as much to shorts, as to longs. I don't wish to sound a conspiracy theorist, but in my opinion sooner or later, they will create another hype, which the media will cover again, and another batch of newbies will jump in, maybe even those that have lost in the past like a never ending cycle. And at the end, it will play out just like it did now, with huge dumps. 
* I believed in a new ATH, when BTC was $5 (and I bought),
* I believed in a new ATH, when BTC was at $50 (and I bought),
* I believed in a new ATH when BTC was at $160 (and I bought).

* Will I believe in a new ATH, when BTC is at $4k?


**Come on, do you think I am *THAT* stupid? Of course I won't believe in a new ATH. /s**

FYI: I still have a sizable fiat position. I started to accumulate one month ago, when prices touched $6.2k for the first time. Since then I bought every dip, that went below $6.2k and I'll do so for another month or two. I did the same between $160 and $250 in 2014.

Let's see whose pockets are deepest.
Was just trying to impart some wisdom. It's really only something that can be learnt painfully over time ; D\~
It's good until we're all in profit ;)

Low volume. A low volume bull market is a weak bull market just as a low volume bear market is a weak bearmarket. The volume has dropped significantly since the beginning of the bearmarket. 

Deceleration in price decline. The price has only been crawling down these past few months. It won't be long before it's completely sideways. A sideways market is a consolidating market and from there a bullmarket may begin again. A dead cat can happen much before that, however. 
You said "literally", then used qoutes and then paraphrased in a crass, oversimplified manner.  I read it as FOMO could accelerate a trend reversal if we keep painting higher lows. I'm curious which indicators he thinks are telling him about sellers/buyers.
It's not negative. It's just realistic. As much as I would like to see BTC at $1m a piece I also know that we may never see $10k again.
Again, bullish longterm, bearish short term
Where do you personally think this is going?
Lol what I'm saying is we "broke 4-year uptrends lines" in 2014. All that's happened is that we've redrawn them since then and - "oh hey look guys, it's an 8 year uptrend line!"

A long term uptrend is still intact unless we go below like $200. 
Sloppy you false narrative maker!
There's a lot of black and white thinking in this sub.

People get very triggered by anyone they perceive as a subversive element, and consequently downvote and get upset whenever they see said username pop up. They respond to usernames, not posts. 
Let's table that part for now (see edit). If you don't mind, what are your thoughts on the other questions I asked?

edit: (some countries have restrictions on how much USD can be purchased and also have restrictions on capital flight)
If you're simply copying the chain (and PoW) by forking off, then yeah your coin is not just beginning its trading history, it's already been trading and distributing for some non-zero amount of time. 
 
What comparison? What desperation?

All I'm doing is mocking the "HURR DURR BCASH IS THE REAL BITCOIN" nonsense that comes from that incestuous group of dummies. Sorry if that offends you but it's a fact that BCash has a history going back to 2009 and it's a fact that it's sitting at a multiyear low in that regard. 

BTrashers can't have it both ways. Either they're an alt or they're supposedly the real Bitcoin. If they're supposedly the real Bitcoin then they need to compare themselves to the guy with a cock 10 times the size. 

Don't be obtuse. You know this is how it works. The numbers don't lie. 
Well all I care about is banging the entire Core team. So I guess you could say that I'm *only* in it for the gay ass crusade.
Finally someone gets it.
I hired an assistant to help out with all the asterisks.
STFU. This sub is for analysis, technical and otherwise. 

Sorry you're upset that your shitcoin behaving like a shitcoin. Don't shoot the messenger.
I agree - just because it has no effect doesn’t change the intent. 
'Tis appreciated! :) 
Well we all of cannot be ; D  


You could quite well be right on the entry point on this one but I'm willing to sit on this and go into some substantial negatives, eitherway if I'm wrong this price point is low enough and near support for a short relief rally to exit if I'm wrong.   

[removed]
4.5K - 5K near term and then likely another bounce and then leg down to 3K range. After that, either bleed out to ~1.2K, capitulate to ~1.2K or a small capitulation wick, rounded bottom and the slow return to bull market. 

I also think that the old log channel will play a role in the future. Currently in the 3K-5K range. We could very likely enter that channel for a while at some point in time. 

Like I said, inflation was so much worse in 2014, that it's easy to say that things are *more* bearish today. Bitcoin moves in hype cycles and big replacements are needed. It doesn't really change anything about Bitcoin, fundamentally.
I just don't get it because I really haven't been particularly wrong (yet) so I don't understand why people would be so upset with me. so far I have been at least decent at making some calls
My country (Ukraine) has those restrictions, but they have zero effect on the amount of USD being bought on the black market or amount of capital fleeing the country. 

Black markets, including illegal currency exchange, are very well developed, extremely convenient and customer-oriented in countries like ours :) 

In my city everyone I know has a personal moneychanger. Also, one of our biggest markets with illegal currency exchange is located right next to the building of our local version of FBI :) Everybody knows what happens there and has been happening for years if not decades. It is surely illegal, but everyone is interested in keeping it going, including corrupt officials. I bet it is the same in Venezuela or other similar corrupt and unstable countries. 
sarcastic humorous gypsy is best gypsy
You've passed by analysis straight to cheerleading and shit slinging.
E.g. what do you mean by "my" shitcoin?
Read Livermore's book if you haven't already. 
Well I can see why we're in disagreement, you're more bearish than peacehere. Jesus christ haha.
Many people have zero tolerance for narratives other than their own. Hearing a different mindset is too disturbing to bear, so they attack. Pretty boring people... 
Thanks man that is extremely interesting! What if you have $10,000,000 worth? 

Edit: obviously just a hypothetical 
BCash of course. You know, the shitcoin you're inexplicably implicitly defending.

It's analysis, plain ans simple. You can double check the figures if you don't believe me. It's almost a year later and the BCash community looks desperate as all hell and the price is sitting at .1 

That's pathetic, it's not shit slinging or cheerleading, it's just the facts of the matter.

Sorry that bothers you :/
I'm not even bearish, I'm just a realist. The numbers are what they are. Inflation was much higher back then and the market is in a similar downtrend in 2018 with *mucho* lower inflation. In fact, inflation is within normal parameters right now, it's not high by any means. That means that 2018 is objectively a more bearish environment. 

Not to mention that shorts are low and longs are high. That doesn't signal bearish sentiment by any means. We already had that big short squeeze anyway. It's unlikely to happen again.
We have many corrupt officials and some oligarchs who regularly move comparable amounts of money in and out of the country. Holes in our legislation make simple schemes of money laundering completely legal. And overwhelming corruption, especially in court and law enforcement, make it relatively easy to bribe just about anyone who can potentially stop you from doing things that are officially illegal.  

According to official statistics, out of all countries in the world the biggest international investor into the Ukrainian economy for a very long time has been Cyprus :) That's the favorite laundry place of our big capital, so history shows that this capital has no problem getting out of Ukraine to Cyprus and then getting back in the form of a completely legal investment. These money routes have existed for many years, are familiar to everyone, have a whole ecosystem existing around them and had no problem doing their things through conventional means like USD. Still have no problems by now, so I don't see much incentive to radically change anything and explore the whole new cryptocurrency world in any foreseeable future. 
Hey friend, 

Not sure if you're in Berlin, but if you just so happen to be, feel free to come along:

Bitcoin cash Berlin - BCH http://meetu.ps/e/FwhjY/jh4zz/d

P.s I don't understand why you have to spend so much time attacking something you say is a shitcoin.. Anywho..
What is bearish if calling for a further 80% drop from here and the worst bear market in history is not bearish? 
Mostly because it's funny. It's funny to poke and prod cult members and see how they react. 

The BTrash cult is quite a thing to witness. If I were in Germany or close by, I would certainly show up to mock all of you in person.
All I'm saying that this is *plausible*. I didn't provide you with a probability distribution for various scenarios. 

Implicit caveat is that anything can happen and I don't take firm and defiant stances one way or the other, unless it's glaringly obvious which way the market is headed. Once this breaks down  convincingly from 5800, I become increasingly bearish, but that hasn't happened yet.
Hahahaha 

Ah man, it'd be great to meet you in person.

Where abouts are you based? Any conferences you'll be going to anytime soon?

Maybe I arrange to come along, or vice versa. 
> Where abouts are you based? Any conferences you'll be going to anytime soon?

I live on a Blockstream compound / concentration camp (in the middle of Siberia). I share a dorm with the many other paid Bilderberg shills. At 5 am everyday, our handlers wake us up and we get to work attacking Satoshi's Vision online and spreading false info about how *BCash has tiny blocks, no use and its value and liquidity are in the shitter.* 

We are often sent to meetups, on behalf of our Lord and Savior, George Soros. He sends us there in disguise and to spy on Roger and friends. Our goal is to keep Bitcoin decentralized and lightweight so that banks can control it. Because that makes a ton of sense.


Huh. I actually like Soros. And I have >85% BTC in my holdings.

**But I'm a filthy BCasher shill!**
So the short of it is we'll not be meeting in person? 

What a pity, all talk no action. 
Firstly, why are you stalking me across various subs and threads? What are you in a Bitcoin sub spreading BCash propaganda? Do you realize that covert shilling isn't allowed here?

Also, what "action" are you talking about? What would I do at a BCash "convention" or "meetup" other than just *talk*? You think I'm just going to start throwing punches? LOL! Or is that *you're* plan. 

Is that what it's come to? Now BCashers are so upset by the state of things that they're resulting to physical violence against Bitcoiners?

Unreal, bro. Use your words, not your fists! 

Not to mention that one tug on that delicate neckbeard of yours would probably send you to the hospital. All the people I see in pictures and videos of BCash meetups look feeble and weak af, including Roger. It looks like none of you guys have ever stepped foot inside a gym. Just a bunch of squeaky-voiced Roger clones, begging for people to take them seriously and for girls to show them affection.

Kind of sad, really. 

:'(
