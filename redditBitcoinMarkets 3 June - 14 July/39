[Daily Discussion] Wednesday, June 06, 2018 -- TITLE
#New post: [\[Daily Discussion\] Thursday, June 07, 2018 →](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8p79tb/daily_discussion_thursday_june_07_2018/)
Since the start of the month, shorts have gone up about 6.5%. Over the same period, longs have gone down about 1%. Price is up 2%.  

But since yesterday at 19:00 UTC, shorts are down 2%, longs are up 3%, and the price is exactly the same. 

This is the level of analytics this sideways movement is driving me to. 

There's something about this price action (since the rise yesterday) that feels a little different than the typical up/down oscillation. I'm expecting this to break upwards, but not enough to leverage long. I'm going to wait for a clearer picture in the form of one of the following:

1) Short a breakdown through the bottom of our ascending channel (below 7400)  
2) Long a bounce/test off our ascending channel bottom (off 7450)  
3) Short a bounce/test off our channel top/historical resistance around 7800  
4) Long a breakout through the top of our ascending channel and/or historical resistance around 7900.

Everything else just feels like noise right now. 
Has anyone taken the time to plot a chart with the massive bart-volume candles removed? If not, I might attack this problem myself.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/CB8MKceE/

My thinking here is that there seems to be two markets superimposed on each other - the natural/traders market and the manipulated/bot market. By removing the bart candles, it might be possible to get a better feeling for the direction of the natural market, even if it means the price isn't accurate.

Hey amigos, I've drawn the chart structure of BTC since December, 2017. I copied the idea of BTC testing major levels when crashing from /u/Palmerstoned.

This idea is invalidated when BTC reaches above 8100. Let me know what you guys think.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/jsbLdnNi/
We've now been in the $7ks longer than we were in the $6.5-7k range. 

It's been 14 full days + some change since we dropped into this range, we were in the other range for 13 days

Didn't realize right I would be when I said we've never chopped around in the $7ks and are overdue for it. -_-

Hopefully we get out of here soon, this is frustrating 
Got bored, here are the results from the poll:

Absolutely don't suggest for a second this is an idea to trade on, but just something I was bored and playing with and was curious about other's thoughts on it. I'm not a professional, I'm as amateur as they come. I like to learn by looking at new TA indicators and seeing what they signal about the market. I am a LTH and have a small trading stack that I (very) rarely trade on, waiting for what I think are good opportunities over making many trades. Moving on...

Volume RSI as a technical indicator caught my eye, because there's a lot of arguments being bandied about regarding the low volume we've been experiencing recently.

[https://www.marketvolume.com/technicalanalysis/volumersi.asp](https://www.marketvolume.com/technicalanalysis/volumersi.asp)

*"The Volume RSI (Relative Strength Index) is quite similar to the price based* [*RSI*](https://www.marketvolume.com/stocks/relativestrengthindexrsi.asp?s=SPY&t=spdr-s-p-500) *with difference that up\-volume and down\-volume are used in the RSI formula instead changes in price. If price RSI shows relation between up\-moves and down\-moves within an analyzed period of time by revealing which moves are stronger, the Volume RSI indicator shows the relation between volume traded during these price up\-moves and down\- moves respectfully by revealing whether up\-volume (bullish money flow) or down\-volume (bearish money flow) is stronger."*

So above 50&#37;, bullish volume, below 50&#37;, bearish volume.

* *Buy when indicators moves above 50\% line after being below it;*
* *Sell when indicator drops below 50\% line after being above it.*

You've also got your standard overbought and oversold indicators of 70/30.

I thought I'd go back in time and look at where we've crossed 50, and where we dipped on the 2017 bull run:

[https://imgur.com/a/QQNU6pV](https://imgur.com/a/QQNU6pV)

The key points for me are:

* It's not wonderfully useful at lower time\-frames. A lot of noise and spikes.
* Monthly time\-frame we are just above oversold, whilst weekly we are in oversold. I can see no other instance of being oversold on this or the monthly going back as far as BFX records.
* I do see plenty of instances where we've gone below 50&#37; and a move back above has been explosive. Note: there are instances of the reverse in the 2014 bear market.

The conclusion to me from this is three\-fold.

1. The Volume RSI right now is overwhelmingly bearish. People are selling.
2. If everything post 2014 is to be believed, we could be sat on the precipice of a unique explosive move upwards.
3. If we factor in 2014, this indicator is probably trash, and we could see some above 50&#37; fake outs. This could manifest as perhaps a lower high than the ATH, but a higher high than as of late, e.g 10\-11k.

So question: does BTCs highly volatile (but not as of late) nature mean volume RSI is a useless indicator, or could it be a strong bullish signal in a low volume era?

I'd love to hear some thoughts or criticisms, even if you blow this whole idea out of the water. I probably should have asked if Volume RSI is considered a valid indicator before I went down this rabbit hole aha.

EDIT: Been considering this indicator a little more. One new observation is that it would appear to be exceptionally poor at dealing with exuberant bubbles. The weekly Volume RSI dips ever so slightly before 50&#37; when BTC is 2.5k in March 2017, then doesn't go below 50&#37; until February 2018. Plenty on the daily, but the noise doesn't seem to give a reliable buy/sell indication. 
Jesus Christ, it wasn't a bear trap and this isn't a bull trap. It's noise, just fucking noise people.
Amazing how sentiment changes in this sub based on the last big candle. After a pump, so many posts mocking anybody bearish. After a dump, people saying it was an obvious Bart and such. 

And we keep getting both one after the other, sometimes several in the same day. 
Ah the classic 1 comment per hour again. 

Big move incoming in other words
Bitcoin gods, please give me this one trade. After being rekt over and over longing Jan-May, I have turned to the darkside all in short. Please, one time. One motherbitchin time just give it to me. Quick capitulation to like 5k so I can close then moon.

Sincerely,

Underwater short

EDIT: bart down to 7500 puts me at breakeven but hope this is the beginning of a larger move. Give us a sign oh, great ones!
We've gone down 1.5%. Pack it up boys, the world is over, bitcoin heading to 0 confirmed. Why is everyone panicking? Lol
Geez, drunken long was opened last night.  Interestingly the September premium has gone up about 50% since then (from +90 to +130).

Guess I'll hold onto it for now but don't like that this bullflag doesn't have downward slope, smells Barty.  

!long xbtu18 7697 5X 50%
Jeeeeez I feel like the market is being held hostage in this range 
This sentiment based on something as arbitrary of the day of the month reminds me of that time Ethtrader spent a month having conniptions of joy over someone saying they were a time traveler. 
Stuck on stability with the rest of you.

Here's the broad view I've been looking at:

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/EwsyTSJs-Projecting-From-Stability/

The two most relevant projections are determined by BBand % width descending bellow historically low RSI.

https://www.tradingview.com/script/U2gQmM4U-Bollinger-Band-Percent-Width-Crossing-RSI/

If you look at those periods of stability you'll notice that they're also accompanied by long-term symmetric triangles.

Projected over the current symmetric triangle:

There are several observations that you can make that show these periods have their own distinctions, but broadly, I'm not able to identify significant signals that make them distinct. I'm curious if anyone else is able to see more.

The price is within $20 of where it was when I went to bed last night almost 10 hours ago. There's really nothing to chart here, either. Wicks seem to be testing upward liquidity. It does feel like it may pop upwards. /u/SloppySynapses pointed out the shift in market movements even from a couple months ago, and this vertical movement/sideways chop pattern (...bart) is very difficult to trade. 

I'm out of position right now. I don't even really have any desire to be in a position right now. If we drop back down below 7500 but hold over 7400, I'll probably look to enter a long position there based off this sort of wonky ascending channel and the proximity to our rising pennant floor. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/zRj84cxr/

Otherwise I'm mostly in wait-and-see mode. I'd love a higher low to form an ascending triangle (continuation pattern), but I'm not sure I'll get it.

I don't see this posted yet? Old news or super neat fun exciting news?

Edit: Looks like a few hours old, but did not see it posted anywhere. As per usual, good news = price downward. Hilarious. 
Just because price action is insignificant doesn't mean your comments need to be. There's a lot to think about. If the small picture is boring then start thinking about the big picture. Let's all do our best to observe rule 3.
hmm... can't help but seeing a bart in play, although that spike to 7700 gets me thinking about whales knowing that we know and acting  in the opposite manner. (haven't had my coffee yet so please excuse the uneducated guess-- although these guesses seem weirdly more helpful for me then actual TA in this space)
BBs tight as hell on the 1 hr 
**[Position Bot update](https://www.anotherbot.info)**

Made some more changes to the site:

* Changed the default order of the open positions to order by date and not by username. This was is easier to check the last positions opened.

* Removed the stop loss column since almost no one used it and was only wasting space

* Added real time sort on the duration column

* Added a column to the details of the trade in the History page

* Updated the watchdog script to restart both bots. If only 1 was offline it wouldn't be restarted.

* Pushed still not working until the 13th.

was looking at the 15m charts and this just looks silly...

https://www.tradingview.com/x/CB8MKceE/

is this really a new phenomenon? Like this never happened in low volume periods in 2013-2016?

here is just a few months ago at the $11.7k to $11.7k double top. even though there are strong moves on the 15m chart it didn't look as ridiculous...

>Today we’re excited to announce that we’re on track to become a US-regulated blockchain securities trading venue. We believe this is an important moment not only for Coinbase, but the entire crypto ecosystem

This is good for Bitcoin
Not necessarily TA at all, but this is bullish for the space in general:


https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/05/sec-appoints-a-crypto-quarterback-in-a-key-time-for-regulation.html


"Valerie Szczepanik, who already worked at the SEC, was promoted to a role that didn't exist until this week: Associate Director of the Division of Corporation Finance and Senior Advisor for Digital Assets and Innovation."



The space is gaining traction every day. Bullish from a qualitative standpoint.
What's funny about all of this is a 1.5% movement in January was completely normal within an hour. I remember the volatility was wild. We'd see a 5% range in a day easily and it wasn't something to freak out about. 

Now we're all used to sideways and a $100 move is "Wow, this shit is going  to $0 or lol this is why you don't ever doubt bitcoin" 

The money right now is in squeezing traders out of their money, so perhaps we won't move until overleveraged traders have basically capitulated. 

I'm personally becoming hesitant to be on the side of the majority of traders now since that is where the liquidity and money is for big players and bots to squeeze. 

Related, although some would disagree: The fact that bitmex is becoming *more* bullish on a move sideways after a massive drop to merely ~20-25% above the lowest low in the past 8 months makes me think the majority of market participants are about to get caught with their pants down. It's truly amazing how bullish this market is by default. 

Imagine having a $150 discount at $10k...

Regardless, when we do finally move and begin to trend, I think people will be surprised by the strength and decisiveness of the move and lots of people will be in denial, whichever way it goes.

Looks like one of the possible scenarios I posted yesterday *could* play out. A little premature to call but, it fit the narrative I wrote pretty damn close. 

**Post from yesterday**:::, Scenario number 2. Higher low around $7500 with an immediate bounce followed by a burst right through $7650

Can someone ELI5 why the weekly bollinger bands did [this](https://www.tradingview.com/x/5YnXYQkC/) in December? Why did they go to zero for a little while? The upper band stayed pretty normal looking but the lower band took a random nosedive.


Edit: If anything, though, it does appear that the lower weekly band hitting zero is a good sell signal after a bubble.
Cant post chart, but long-term downtrend line is currently being broken on the daily. If that breaks, we could see some strong movement upwards. With all of the "bart" talk recently on smaller timeframes, many people have neglected the 1D chart. After the huge wick up a few hours ago, holding above 7600 is both surprising and crucial for bulls (for the super-short term <1week). Currently in position, so hoping I caught close to the bottom on this one. 




Best of luck everyone, remember to live your life today. 
This whole 7.4-7.8 is just noise. The only pattern that I can see on short term is h&s almost completed on 2h but this is a reversal pattern (hard to say we were in any form of bull market) and the volume profile doesn't match so can't say it's legit. Even if it completed and breaks we look at ~$400 Target which should bring this to 7k, but as the target usually don't hit on patterns I'd say it isn't big enough to break 7150 support of the triangle.

Can't call a double bottom on 7350.

For now it's just a noise in a triangle, that's all. Trade this only if you feel lucky. I know we're going up and down and it's good for scalping but this will break on one of those moves eventually.

1w and 3d are getting tighter and tighter.
Yesterday Michael Novogratz talked about the impact of

* Regulation
* Market Manipulation
* Probable SEC actions this summer
* Altcoin market consolidation
* CC market cap going to 20 trillion
* New sources of investment
* Smart contracts made simple

Holding long term has never looked nicer. WTH is going on with these random +150 -150 +150-150+150-150.
This just seems oddly and obviously manipulated. Guess day traders are being toyed with.
Looking over the weekly chart since 2014, BTC clearly seems to form symmetric triangles as a form of price consolidation before moving upwards and has always succeeded in breaking upwards given a bit of time.  This is obviously the largest triangle in it's history.  Is there any reason to think that it won't continue to its behavior with a breakout to new highs when it is good and ready?  This is pretty technically driven theory though, ultimately sidelines money needs to flow in to break out a triangle -- if it does break out upwards I would imagine, it should be a proportionally massive occurrence.  
This would potentially be the most sad trombone Bart yet. I got whiplash from the sentiment change in here yesterday after the move from 7350 to 7650.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/LY1hXzkR/

Dump stopped at the .382 fib level of our recent retrace from 7.8k. There is also a thick 4 hour cloud under us. Will start opening long between  here and 7420.
And I am still thinking with every move: "this one will be the move, it cannot go on for so much longer without changing the price level" and then it just goes on and on and then you realize how many scalps you missed here.
So this recent wick has me concerned. We have had a few of those since we have been in this range and all but one led to a huge dump after
Smaller timeframe bear flag hasn't broken down yet, looking at the 1H now. I think it is becoming a psychological game than anything else at this point. If 100-200$ drops / ups are bothering you, just stay out.

Edit: 1H seem to be breaking down
Feeling good about my 7650 short entry now. I have lowered stops a bit to secure profit if this somehow barts back up again in the next couple hours. What I'm really looking for now is the bear flag we've been in for the last couple of days.

Buyers seem to make quick work of the low 7ks, like 7100 and 7200. I wouldn't be surprised to see a quick bounce up from there like earlier in the week.
Right now we are starting to pierce the EMA 100 on the 4h chart. We've stayed below that since May 10th. If we can break through there for good, well, "That would be nice."

Edit: And while I'm writing this... we crash down again. A very important marker, it seems...
ETH seems to be in a symmetrical triangle with the apex in the next day or two. 
If this is true then BTC should tighten also in that period aiming for 7550
I’ve never seen so much bullish news about crypto in my life as we are seeing right now.  Arguing about 7700 vs. 7800 seems really silly at this point.  Coinbase is about to begin selling tokenized securities soon.  It’s over, crypto won.  Get all of it you can now.

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17252322
Still holding on to my 5x long from 7400. My original plan was to take profits at 7900 and stop loss around 7250. I don't see much reason to change that although we've definitely gone a lot more sideways than I was hoping/anticipating. 

If we can comfortably stay above 7500 over the next few days, I can still look at it through my bulltard goggles and stick to the plan. However if we dip to say 7400 again and anemically rise back, I'm going to look to exit my long sooner than I hoped. 
Did Bart recently learn 180 reverts on his skateboard? That was quite a trick he just performed.   


Seriously though this is some janky stuff, has anyone seen a detailed analysis for these abrupt patterns? 
Hey all, 

I am curious wih how much money the average person here is trading crypto. I made a poll to check this out. Please participate and thanks in advance:

Added a very small position to my long from $7472 at $7507.

Will bail on it under $7400. 

I’m still expecting [This ](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ontzj/daily_discussion_tuesday_june_05_2018/?st=JI3EQRAO&sh=09d23593)  which I posted yesterday.

If the line holds and we paint a higher low on the 4H and such, I would be leaning more bullish than I am now. 
seems like we made a higher low and a lower high, this could be another pennant. hard to interpret this one if it folds out as we are in a upmove from the 7040 low, but the pennant would have started forming from top in down direction. 
Someone said BART?????

Seriously, next time another one comes up I'm going x10.

Technical question: Can accumulation occur even as OBV decreases?
If one understood every bart level as representation of a certain tone pitch one could argue that the former noise of the BTC chart has turned into some kind of melody. As a matter of fact, some kind of idiotic melody.
!long btcusd 7492 1x 100%

Seems pretty stable around this price.  Hoping for some upwards movement leading up to the weekend.

Edit:   I also expect it may reverse Bart soon 
I feel like with all of this talk of the 6th to behave a particular way, it may have already been priced in for the short term and we may end up with a red month instead which is annoying because the TA I have is telling me a move up should be happening soon.  Perhaps I am overthinking.
The market in a nutshell:

9 out of 10 times, when the market consolidates this tightly and goes sideways for this long, the price goes way up when it's over.

Unfortunately, it heavily mirrors that 1 time out of 10. 
Anyone else expecting there to be a fight for the daily at 0:00 UTC? Today especially is an important day to confirm a trend reversal. Commented on here earlier today that we might close green, let's fucking do it. 



Edit: Also, shorting BTC just became a bit more dangerous with the SEC statement today. Pretty fucking bullish. 
Damn, I wish I hadn't chickened out on my long earlier today, even though I made a small gain. Entering another here, 7720 3x. Will add if we go down a bit because this is just looking like a big Bitcoin Boner about to happen.
Is this sub really excited about 7700?

Wake me up at 8200
Anyone else feel that? 

The change in sentiment has begun.   Hold on to your hats boys, we going for a ride. 
[The price movement right now](https://www.tradingview.com/x/a7eEcVOi) looks a lot like what we saw exactly a week ago on Wed, 30th at around the same time. The only things different are the size of the candles and price range by roughly $100. The structures are very identical.

Frankly speaking, I don't believe there is more room to retrace at this point. This is further validated by the buying I have been seeing since for more than 24 hours now. A lot of people are already in longs, or are planning to open ones in near future, I can only hope we are very close to whatever one might perceive as to be the case..

That was some massive wicks... again like in the morning. Maybe we even get a lightsaber today?
BTC can go on its own and alts can dump.. just saw the glimpse of it a little bit, top 3 alts on gdax are in red and BTC is getting green.. Enough of this shit.. lol.. BTC the big daddy has to strike.
what's up with this massive spikey pattern?????
This shit is becoming so predictable and boring. Bart after bart after bart, orchestrated by a few big players. Just capitulate already or break up and do something. 

My damn stock portfolio is more exciting lately. Sigh.
New strategy that I've been trying out:

* Buy alts low
* Set a bunch of sell orders into BTC
* Take a week of to do outside things

Intermission

* Send BTC to GDAX
* Set a bunch of sell orders into fiat
* Take a week of to do outside things

wtf is this volume. 71 coins the past 30 minutes ?????? wut

Assume that the market is currently controlled by traders.

Could we be seeing a gradual shift to market agnosticism? Or, are we instead witnessing a hardening of resolve?

Relative stability spotted with moments of intense, capricious volatility. Has the immovable object finally collided with the unstoppable force?
Which price first: $5999 or $10001?

Curious if sentiment has changed, although I know it's not going to be same exact poll participants
I feel messed with. 'They think it's gonna pump or dump on the 6th? Make sure it does NOTHING mwahahahaa'
The banks here in Germany are introducing these real\-time transfers where you can send money and the money is in a few seconds on the other bank account of cooperating banks. It does not work for international wires, but it should be the new standard within the EU at least. I fear a bit that this could take some steam form the crypto industry. Of course banks will not be blind for developments in the crypto\-sphere and I think that is one answer maybe at the right time.

Real\-time transfers become available by 1. August 2018.

Remember, this is absolutely nothing until we break 7800 on high volume. We could be doing the exact same double top-ish pattern we did at 11.7k or make a slightly higher high and do the same thing we did at 9.9k. If 7.8 doesn't break, we may very well be at the "top" for the next few weeks...

edit: the buying so far has also been margin longs opening which (up from 30k to 32k over the past 24h)

Coming back into the market after leaving isn't automatic. If profit is primarily made from buying and holding for months or years, that isn't going to turn many heads.

It looks to me like traders are done trying to figure out how far down the market can go. I don't think that converts to longs and accumulation, but I do think it contributes to the lack of volume we're seeing.

I wonder how long that will be and how much volatility will return. We don't see volatility like what we saw 2011 - 2013 anymore... and I doubt we ever will. What's peak volatility 2015 - 2017 and will we see that again?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/JvIQP5N4/

The purple line is weekly BBand % width projected large over the price. That seems to indicate that volatility is dropping.

Here's another way to look at it that makes it clear that volatility, for Bitcoin, is dropping:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/c4qLUozy/

I'm interpreting this as an indicator that the appeal this market has to traders is dropping over time.

What is the natural rate of growth for bitcoin if bubbles are less substantial over time?

Haven't been keeping an eye on the market as I've been travelling a lot the past few days. 

~~As of right now the support at 7600 looks to be holding up quite nicely, and the finex orderbook is pretty thick at that level too.~~

The support failed as I was typing this up, seems like we'll be testing a new support.

I was looking at a potential H&S pattern yesterday the range of which has been holding up pretty well, but definitely leaves us within barting range with a strong support at 7400+

https://www.tradingview.com/x/1erjp5LJ/

(The formation is a bit cleaner on the finex chart but it's too messy to link. )

As we're moving down a bit here, the level I'm watching is 7500-7400, as a break below would be pretty bearish for me and provide a scenario in which it's very likely that we're going to revisit the downtrend resistance again at (sub-)7250. I'll be looking at a chance to go long at <7100 for pretty decent r/r if we get there, with tight s/l below the bottom of the triangle. A double-bottom formation would be a really solid set-up for another grind up in the triangle, plus it would roughly coincide with the target of an H&S break-down. 

don't forget, for all the tin-foil hat wearers. Today is the **6th**. Let's see if the theory holds up or if we even get close.
Are [bear flags](https://www.tradingview.com/x/TOkhtn6O/) on the daily possible / a thing? Or am I just a bear who’s dreaming? 

More experienced folks: Thoughts?

Very bullish on the inverse BTC chart right now. Could see a massive breakout any day. 3 tests of resistance, clear higher lows, decreasing bear volume, very weak rejection so far of our last test of resistance (looks like a little bull flag), moving averages sloping in the right direction.

Can't post the chart because I don't know how to do it on Coinigy.

H&S in the making right now.  BTCUSD/ 4hr. 

Be aware bulls.  Those bitfinex buy walls are just for them to get a better short entry.

Bitcoin wants to break up Uber bad 
It blows my mind that we get these barts so often now. It can't possibly just be stop losses triggering stop losses. It's retracing to seemingly the exact same 'distance' up / down. What is the cause of this behaviour?

It seems alts are not really effected in the same way, possibly someone is transferring 'value' from BTC / alts. I've checked ETH and LTC? What do you guys think? I find it pretty absurd that the 'majority' of alts all seem correlated with BTC/$, when only a few hand full seem to bring anything to the table.

I'm just gonna short the tops, long the bottoms, tight stops etc. The only question remains is \- what is the baseline? Are we current up or down?
I'm busy and I'm thinking my limit at 7.9 is going to trigger :/

I make maybe a trade a month I hate to miss it and be in usd for to long
Oh man, I bet that dufus that dumped all that coin today is feeling pretty stupid right about now.  He'll be feeling even dumber at some point soon.

So as not to be low-effort:  

It is a very basic TA principle that when a market goes flat either after a run up or down, it has reached its local top/bottom.  There is not enough pressure to continue the trend. It's probably the most reliable trend reversal pattern in the book.  Where have we been lately? Flat.  What happened in the month previous? Down.  Where do we go next? Up.  Probably in a pretty big way.
i've been a no coiner since I sold at $7900 a couple weeks ago, been staring at charts, waking up every morning checking price, patting myself on the back for not fomoing and staying patient. Put first limit order in weeks at $7630 planning to pull it after reading about stamp buy wall holding up for potential short orders. Nature called, went to go take a quick dump. Stamp holding price up and worst case if order hits and I get cold feet I can always sell back for small loss or gain. What could go wrong? Came back feeling great and order had hit and price dumped. There goes a couple weeks of being patient. Now I made the equally awesome decision to send everything to Binance to go lose money on some speculative shitcoins.

At least I did this with only 40% of my cryptofund where in the past I would have gone all in.

Plebs will be plebs.

As I mentioned in the last report $7600 was the key resistance, and the market is still trading in this zone today, lets take a look at the [bitcoin price charts](https://cryptosignals.trade/forums/topic/bitcoin-btc-price-analysis-june-2018/#post-17749).

The market is creating higher lows and higher highs, the key factor traders look for when establishing if the market is in fact in a bullish trend. There is a decent little channel forming on the 4hr candle chart and the price action is finding support above my longer term bullish trend line.

Needless to say, the market is facing critical support zones as well as resistance, with June, so far being quite low on the trading volume, we could expect the next surge of buying/selling pressure to set the stage for the weekend.

Personally I am bullish above $7400 and bear below it. I would expect lower prices for the Bitcoin market, should we fail to consolidate above this zone. It would seem that the buyers are indeed interested in the market, as we bounced back into the $7600 zone quickly after a brief visit to the support zone.

Like usual never a dull day, for the safer entry into the market it could be wise to wait for more bullish momentum and consolidation above $7600 – $8000. I am confident we could see direction soon so don’t go to far. Safe trades.
watch that stamp wall..

Looking at our resistance zones overhead, it looks to me like we've got a gradual runway that will hold us to push through the top of our symmetric triangle.

More support for a forecast that projects continued low volatility through then next month.

Added a short order to ~~7760~~ 7745
rejected by the middle band again..im still pretty bearish about all of this but the amount spot buying and reduction in margin is pretty nice, on the other hand alts like bcash, EOS and eth are consuming all the USD funding on finex - which is very bearish.    
however bears are surprisingly weak..i expected a lot more down pressure yesterday.   
really not sure what to make of this price action at all, its weird.

980 bid wall on stamp has been pushing the market up for the past hour. As soon as that gets pulled, gg longs
How much of a bump are folks expecting because of the world cup?  (Many bank transfers blocked in Russia because of sanctions, vendors are pretty openly accepting bitcoin now.)
So it's officially 6/6 US time. Upvote if you think price goes up today, downvote if down. I think we go down just bc entire twitterverse thinks we're going up. 
I think EOS leads the market (sometimes). I stacked RSIs of the top 8 coins by market cap and included an average of these RSIs as a baseline to see if a coin is under or over performing. What I found was that EOS's price action preceded the average quite often. Here is a chart of EOS (thin purple line) vs. the average (thick black line).

Oh, look at this guy, throwing up his little 50-coin sell walls on GDAX like it will make any difference! Adorable!

In case you failed to understand the material in today's 5-minute Never Short Bitcoin seminar, don't despair! The 15-minute version will be coming soon, designed for the slower students, and if that fails, you can always take the full 1 hour class (no course credit and can be very expensive).

Students who fail will have to take summer school, I'm afraid.  This is required for graduation.
Where's all the people now with that chart that shows bitcoin bullruns on the 6th of the month?
*I don't want to talk about those coins. I see the worst in alts, Henry. I don't need to look past seeing them to get all I need. I've built up my hatreds over the years, little by little. Having you here gives me a second breath. I can't keep doing this on my own with these... coins.*

If the 6/6 meme was too predictable, then the 2014 one is, too.

Consistency is a virtue, bears.


Market is becoming increasingly more predictable, and I like it!

That spoofy 1k buy wall @7,600 was an obvious short sign. These Bart formations are actually a scalptrader's wet dream as you just know they'll keep on coming *and* they complete most of the time. As a bit of a scalptrader myself I'm raking in money lately.

Thanks, Matt Groening!

I'm pretty certain we have a 400-600$ pump incoming after that we'll start a grind upwards and eventually retest 12k.

If this doesn't occur that I expect us to retest 7k-7300 before deciding whether we go down to 5500 or up to 12k.
I'm tempted to go long somewhere around here, but can almost guarantee you that even if we move up $1000, bad news will come out and knock the price down below where we are now.  

Gov'ts and Central Banks have many more ways to fuck with all of us, and they will continue to do so as long as necessary to finish their mission.

For the first time ever, I'm considering shorting. This is very bullish news. 
I haven't opened a trade in about 2 weeks. This choppy nonsense has been difficult to trade and I don't see the point in attempting it. 

However I am expecting this to bart down to the 7400-7500s, due to our lack of volume. I'm short at 7650 (very small position essentially betting this bart breaking down). We can really go either way from here, maybe even more sideways chop. RSI's are pretty much dead 50 on all time frames.  
Long futs, short swaps, wait for a break, close one of them ;-)
Jesus, Bitcoin's price has become an oscillating indicator itself!
Here is another one that is interesting if you are going to attack the above.

If you are going to look at wicks I would be interested in looking at a binned graph of wick lengths and volume underneath them.   Pick any time frame 1hr or greater/wick probably the exchange with highest volume (but the software can look at any exchange).   The question here is whether or how the market depth has changed over time.

EDIT:  The idea here is to pick the bin width (1hr or greater/wick) but also to put this into a larger width bin.   So for example using 1hr wicks put the collected data into 1week increments.  If one were to use 1 day wicks then use 1 month increments etc.   See if anything stands out regarding price movements vs. volume
Upvoted but too much for my simple mind to understand ;(

Can someone explain what I'm supposed to be looking at here? Why is Peter saying get ready to rock n roll. And is that bullish/bearish? Or is he just expecting big price action?
I will agree with whoever always says $7500 is price of bitcoin so pack it up

This sub is bipolar AF! So funny to watch emotions change with the wind.

I will join in on your prayer. 50x short from 7637. Last pocket change.
There you have it boy, your wish has been granted.

Just this one time though
the Gods have answered
I think you might be okay here son...Multiple failed attempts at 7.7, lots of longs opened in this range and now trapped unless we see upside, spoofy action on two exchanges propping price. always darkest before dawn. RIP if no scuba tank and another 24 hours of this.
There you go.
There is no free money, even if this drops to 5k, it will stop at 6k8 and bounce a bit, drop to 6k and bounce some more. There is not going to be quick at all.

It's a bad time to enter a position expecting big pay. If you get 2 or 3% i suggest profit taking because probabilities are pointing to a dance around 7k5
Mex traders are currently bearish, shorting every upside, that why other Top 8 coins are performing better so far. But the day we get the FOMO momentum,its going to be glorious.  
thats and only that is why price is going to go up.
Good luck. If you are lucky it will correct. Have a look at the weekly: 3 rd week in the 0.618 area, bulls fighting for the rsi to remain in long term horizontal... this could end bad for you. 
A lot of people here expect constant up or constant down and are flummoxed by sideways chop.

If we chop this way for most of the rest of the year those people will have brain aneurysms. 
I think honestly it is just a meme at this point. Not many people are panicking, just memeing. Who knows, we might close green.
I think it's more premature celebration from the goblinbois
Nobody's panicking except maybe the folks orchestrating these expensive dumps to such little effect.
I just found out i have a short on ETHUSD since yesterday... Must have forgotten to delete the order...
And without any stop loss in place... Luckily i'm in profit but i would have closed it earlier if i knew...

Stop loss @breakeven and let it ride, although my bet is on another leg up to 7800 before crashing down again.

where are your stops?
Bleh!

Now there's tricky one, if I understand correctly.

7350 as double bottom will confirm above 7.8 which is huge resistance, If we bounce off 7.8 then we'll confirm double top after breaking 7350 :)

No trade in this range.

Yeah the 1-4 hr charts are screaming for a bart back down to like $7400 levels aren't they. It's really too obvious at this point though, but maybe it's obvious that it's too obvious so it'll go the other way anyway? Fucking bartception man. 
bots, bots, bots, bots. low liquidity and whales: https://twitter.com/coincaesar/status/1003474520471027713
Interesting comparison. The first graph is basically a compressed version of the second one. By compressed I mean like a force that's pushing the graph down as well a pushing it up, tightening the price range artificially.

Controlled price movements in a specific range with a bit of "stop hunting" in the mix. As to why this is happening, I agree with @loveyoulongtimexmr's explanation - bots can keep the price at a certain level because of low volume and whales decide when to buy/sell to allow a change in price.
Bitcoin has been infected by the bart virus. Only way to get rid of it is to self-combust by dumping to sub-5k. Ensuing chaos will eradicate the bart virus and launch us back on course for 20k and moon.
exchanges need volume and they do what they can to get it
This means alts could have fiat pairs on Coinbase yeah? 

Wasn't it good for BTC that alts had to enter thru btc? 

Bearish for ETH though, read between the lines Coinbase doing this means they expect coins to become securities and as the head of SEC said today Bitcoin is explicitly not a security (and LTC and BCH are both essentially bitcoins clones) doesn't leave much room for doubt in my mind as to what coin they currently offer they are covering there asses for.
Well it remains to be seen whether it is bullish or not.

No one knows the trajectory the SEC will take yet.  If they take the sledgehammer to ICO's retrospectively then the entire market will be affected, at least in the short term.
Those bbands are getting tight, don't they?
in what way is mex becoming more bullish?
Until we're out of the triangle it's not bull nor bear but more chop

Doesn't work. Did you use the permalink from your own post?
holy shit i thought you were joking about his name being Bart. That's so incredibly funny
Momentarily.  We won't be there for long though.
Also the end of the "pump" so yeah...
There's a lot of time for a bearish engulfing on the daily turning this incredible no volume recovery into a giant bear flag.
That must be a comp glitch, upper/lower BB bands as mentioned below are 2 std deviations from the mean 20 day avg using standard settings. 
AFAIK bollinger bands are nothing more than standard deviations.. so that seems to be just an error
Volatility became high, the 20-week standard deviation was big enough that double of it reached 0. No way to ELI5 unfortunately.
>Best of luck everyone, remember to live your life today. 

Good call, I may take my phone outside for a bit. 
I can't even imagine or comprehend a 20 trillion dollar market.
Another interesting point, around 10:10:

* Current blockchains like BTC and ETH aren't really usable yet because they're slow, but projects like Augur, Golem, EOS and Funfair (??) are going to change that, but this won't take off within the next 18 months.

edit: around 12:46 he even says it will take around 2-4 years for blockchains to scale [appropriately for mass adoption].
Agreed
How does holding long term look good?
Like someone mentioned earlier: seems like the big players are trying to shake out the traders since the weak hands are already gone. Once the traders are gone too they can completely control the price...
Purely technically speaking, the chance of breaking up or down from a symmetrical triangle is in favor of the move before. Since the move before was $20k to $13k, it'd be a continuation triangle that favors moving down by 66% to moving up at 34%. 

This is at least what Peter has said.

Although he did long btc (but then he closed it on the drop) 
Very good! So nice to see someone do some real TA that actually gives insight into the market. 
If this Barts down we're looking at a major h&s on the 4hr chart with measured move target ~7.0k. 
Hi mate. Thanks for your TA. Could you please tell me how to turn on these fibonacci levels on trading view?  
There is a huge list of fibonacci related stuff but not ones you showed here. Or is it Pro version you are using?  

But on crypto 2x ichimoku settings we're just under a thick 4hr cloud
Wow.

Ad soon as you try to scalp the big move will happen.. simple physics 
Testing the " waters" at the Upside.

It is really hard to tell, though, since so many dumps have also been bought up. Every pump being sold into and every dump being bought up definitely makes it feel that we are leveling off here.
You can see them as small-scale blow off tops. This one in particular was pushed pretty hard to be a red candle on the 15/30 min charts
I see what you mean... but could go up or down \- as both up and downside have large wicks. Kind of indecisive. 
As much as I would LOVE for us to finally getting out of this range, 24hr volume has been decreasing with this last dip so I think we are going to Bart around some more.
3% is significant.
Yup always buying the dip, but wanting others to do the heavy lifting when it comes time to push price towards the upside.
Can you link Chart? 

Busy n can’t chart 
When even this kind of news is not responsible for a significant  price valuation , than you know the bear market still have to play itself out.

it would be also cool to know of those who hodl, how much they are hodling.
The amount that I trade is miniscule compared to what I hodl. 
The market is fine, people should just stop trading on margin and stop trading with such a short term time frame.
I don't think they'll leave, they'll just take a break. I'm half tethered right now. Not really paying attention nor trading nearly as much as I used to. 
Perfect, another chance at a giant bull run
nice demonstration of how putting your limits where you would put your stops is a good strategy.

!long XBTUSD close 7620

not convinced by this bull flag and I agree with your analysis
By "trade entered", you mean a short position? What's your target?
Looks like you're calling the BatBart then.

EDIT: But 7570 looks pretty solid for support, no?
Ballsy move sir, I wish you good luck.
Seems to me like we still can’t get above 7700
The right side of his head is always shorter than the left.  You'd be better off going long on the LRD than short on the BGD.

Must be the whales singing.
Danny Elfman is the one whale behind all of the BGDs/BRDs. 

Once the bear market is through, it'll form a single bar of his magnum opus on the 1D timeframe played back as a mono waveform.
Good luck. Where do you have your stops?
Nobody is seriously actually trading this 6th of the month meme..... are they? 

This belief is actually more common than the belief it will repeat for the sixth time so you know what that means...
Not sure if this has already been talked about but could the 6th thing have something to do with monthly futures contracts? Looks like it only started happening after CME started trading crypto. Idk how exactly that would affect the price swings but it's an interesting coincidence
Can't say I disagree.
I think more consolidation is needed. All the previous support from April, May and even March is now turned to resistance and solid. 
Daily looks like a big fat bear flag. Volume profile fits perfectly, too. 

I also find it funny that bitmex futures premium doubled right before we dropped $100

You truly can trade on how wrong bitmex is 
Probably less than that. Periods of stability are very rare. Periods of stability that are combined with low RSI are even more rare. Our current periods is 13 days long.
That’s ballsy action after all this BART’n. Good luck. 
I thought fair price of Bitcoin is 7500?
Wake me up when September ends 
Nah, we'll let you sleep through it. 
Then it will be 8500, and so on.
Lol, good timing, bro.
that timing though
wow, I am impressed. I spit out my coffee I laughed so hard when I saw the BRD.
do u feel a chill?
A change in the market.  

Like a coffee shop of longs all of a sudden..

To goblin town?
Idgaf what you want to call it, but until we break out of this range (or collectively kill ourselves from boredom) it is all just noise.
Noticed the same. Holding this level also makes daily swing low. lessgetit
*Aggressive buying*
Pretty cool. Just looks like we'll be trading sideways with a slight increase for the next 2 years until the next bull run lol.
sooner or later it'll break through and then its off to the races 
There is a FIB line there also on the 4HR-Bitstamp at 7760, that doesn't help.

Edit: Daily chart not 4HR, sorry.
I would expect a fakeout down first.

Laying all cards on the table. Entry price: 7735, also I've got a few more orders set up till 7900.

Vader just lit his.
right now ALTs are doing their thing, since BTC is kinda stuck in a 2% range, once BTC starts pumping the alts will get dragged up too
Moon time didnt you hear? Nows the time to buy. Stock up, totally not a bull trap....
> This shit is becoming so predictable 

Uh, then make a ton of money trading on margin if you know what is going to happen? If you're bored you only have yourself to blame. 
I’ve been visiting r/wallstreetbets for my entertainment because this crypto market hasn’t made up its damn mind 😂
It won't stop as long as there's money to be made by stophunting the overleveraged retards on bitmex by making barts on finex, over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. It'll keep happening until mex gambler are finally out of money. I really hope it happens sooner rather than later though.
Why do you think that capitulation will automatically trigger some new crazy cycle. It could chop around indefinitely after that. Things dont just go straight down and straight up
True capitulation takes time.
my big cap stocks have more daily volatility than BTC nowadays. We went down 1.5%. I feel stupid for just buying above 7600 but I will sell back at a loss if we go below $7K and stay there
How has that been working out for you? It's not a terrible strategy... although you may end up finding yourself holding Reddcoin for 2 years because it did not go back up a few weeks later... (eventually it did MASSIVELY, might I add!... ~167X from 1 to 167 satoshis during the bull run of 2017.. I sure wish I had bought more of that shitcoin during the dark ages... I paid aroudn 8 satoshis for mine and sold around 30 satoshis way too early for the party as usual last year...)
I've been doing this more recently but it takes soooooooooooo long for my sells to execute. Wondering if it's a waste of time
It looks like it's getting harder and harder to make a profit. Isn't that trader repellent?
The market is not controlled by traders but a few individuals , just look at the price action from today.
Well, 5999 is only ~1500 away and 10001 is ~2500 away. Seems like a fair handicap. 10001 for sure.
What/when were the previous results?
Voted 5999
BGD was on April 12th/13th.  April 6th was a deceptive way up, that everyone was calling a bull trap, and then it went back down to the mean, and then had a very small bear trap fakeout below the mean for a half day before exploding.

6th is approximate.
Not necessarily. In April the pump started on the 12th, and before that there was a post-weekend dip. 

Also I don't think it matters to "futures illuminati" if we the little traders know about this or not. This has not been some kind of an insider-only secret. Zoom out and you will immediately notice it. If we fall into their scheme, doesn't it only make their jobs easier? I mean, the "manipulation" can now police itself.

edit: only fast payment coins never had a real Value proposition to begin with
I don't think the use case for Bitcoin is derived from the speed of transactions. Value is based on speculation around establishing a global currency that isn't the US dollar. The use case is a post singularity economy that works without debt.
The UK has had this since 2008!
Cryptos are for "instant" transfers worldwide, not just within the same country. The UK have done that for a long time and its called FPS here.

Also when you want to send large amounts, no questions asked unlike the banks. 
I did a wire transfers from my santander bank to my hsbc 2 months back. It was already instant. I was actually quite impressed, since I was already mindsetted to wait a few days to arrive. 
good to know. Thanks!
I think it's good that they catch up and compete with features that fiat lacks.
Du bist Deutscher? Son Ding...
One thing i have learned so far is to not pay tooo much attention to such walls. If anything, for me the tendency is: buy walls = bearish, sell walls = bullish, hidden buy wall = bullish, hidden sell wall = bearish. 
Lol?
When you wake up, the Whales will be in the middle of eating you for breakfast.  The best you'll be able to do is pass them the salt!

Don't base your trade on an order that can be pulled at any minute, mate!
There's a bigger wall on BFX,  he has the biggest D.i.k 
OK is "he" trying to get sellers to buy into it or get buyers to place orders in front of him? How to tell the difference? This is what puzzles me.
Yes, I think price is mainly moved by margin longs and shorts lately - all short term trades. What BTC needs is new real capital inflows to break those strong resistances. 
Yup, those margin longs make me very sad. However, the chart is pretty bullish so maybe they are just seeing the same things as me. As long as this momentum keeps up we will be breaking 7800 soon.
Shorted ETH @610, closed @595. Nice little profit. 
Now rinse and repeat.
"never short bitcoin"

Honestly bro you should keep your mouth shut. You aren't a trader so don't speak on things you don't understand. 
it could mean so many different things, a real buyer waiting for better timing , someone making fake support to try to pop up the price with a fake buy wall , someone spoofing so people think that it's going to dump. You really can't read that much from a spoofer

Presented clearer now, good work. Is the BB width enough of an indicator? That is just range, correct? or would an average range be a better indicator?
I just want to take a moment to thank you for your contributions to this thread, subreddit, and overall space (bitcoin). Your charts and overall efforts in fostering a community that shares knowledge are truly incredible. 
(Copying buried comment regarding your bband width declining here)

I gotta feel like if you did a linear regression on that it'd have an awful R^2 value, way too much noise in the signal if you're really trying to claim volatility has gone down overall as time has gone on based on weekly bband width.

I do believe from just looking at the daily charts back then that the "wickiness" has gone down as liquidity has gone up, so volatility in that sense may have gone down. Weekly chart doesn't capture that as well though.


On the 6th it dumps to its monthly low. That's what the tin hat theory is. The 6th is either the high or the lowest point of the month. So I dn't understand why people saying it's supposed to be green today.

EDIT: I typed this 20 min ago, forgot to send. It seems a bit fitting now.
As a rookie  trader, let me ask a supportive question: why are some of your bars numbered? What are you counting? The trend? If so, how many bars each way is one? What's the thinking there? Thanks.
Very possible but from our current spot you can't tell. We'd need to make a lower low currently around 7500 in order to call it a bear flag. Although opening a short at this current price isn't bad R/R. We are indeed at resistance. Just make sure to put reasonable stops above 7800 in case it breaks because if it does I would imagine it would be a short trip to 8k.
If you're a bear right now, you're Freddy, not just a Dreamer. One might even say "delusional," to recycle an old lyric from that particular band.
Sorry for my non-understanding, but what’s the point of flipping it upside down and calling it bullish when you could just look at it normally and say it’s bearish?
[Bullish](https://www.tradingview.com/x/4Mj4QtGZ/)

If only we'd bottomed like this
These Bart movements are very bullish ? what are you smoking.  
[removed]
That one looks legit... But /u/sloppysynapses is expert here in confirming hs patterns.
H&S became an amputee. And I was thinking we would have an easy day, just accumulating for a bull run.
I dont think we have seen 1 Invs H&S or H&S play out in line months.

It’s beyond a meme at this point. Literally the most unreliable pattern ever 
Which way after it completes?
[https://imgur.com/a/sEAm70N](https://imgur.com/a/sEAm70N)

I actually kind of agree with this. Important to note it's just noise until the neckline is broken at \~7.4k, but the volume profile fits alright. Would have liked to have the left shoulder be slightly higher volume/better defined but otherwise I can see it.
Or someone wants to build a large short position into these wicks before kicking the chair out.

/tinfoil hat

I'm debating hedging my stack here (not leveraged short, just hedged).
btc wants to go to prom with 7.7 but keeps getting rejecc :/
Bitcoin wants to drop to 7,4 and settle at 7,5 for 3 days uber bad.
I'm interested in seeing if it still would without those buy walls.
As far as I see it (and I may be wrong, I don't give enough of a fuck about this nowadays to really care tbh), it's a by-product of Bitmex having more volume dollar-wise than its reference spot exchanges. If you can move the price on Bitfinex with a relatively small amount of money while having a multi-million position on Bitmex, it makes sense to paint these barts on Bitfinex while taking profits on Bitmex. 
Daily chart showing very low volume, Bart can be caused by people overtrading in thin orderbooks.
Wash trading maybe ?
The market tries to fuck over the most people at any given time. The Bart is an example of that. The traders today are trading with leverage and an order book with low liquidity.
I want to believe
>Nature called, went to go take a quick dump.

So did BTC
Still there. 980 buy wall at 7620

I want to see that fake wall get pulled before I go to sleep
When did you bought ? i guess above 13K... sorry for your loss.  ( edit : 600 ? in your dreams... )
Here, just swap this in:

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-06/bitcoin-etf-dreams-kept-alive-with-new-solidx-vaneck-sec-filing
Just post the Bloomberg article that isn't retarded instead of this shitty article that refers to Bitcoin as Bitcoin Core (BTC).
That's a pennant and not a triangle. A triangle has horizontal bottoms or tops.
Don't be greedy.  Snag your lunch money as soon as it turns green.

[edit -- *if* it turns green forgot you were short not long. long positions almost always turn green if you wait them out long enough, by the way, guys]
Lmao, why would you short here. This is about to break up. I’d move that order up much higher
Keep adding to it on the way up, sure way to profit!
Which period and bb settings?
Removed. Rule 3. Looking for more substance in these shit posts.
Now a 530 wall on finex at 7600
can see very few reasons why a whale would put a 980 wall up on stamp other than to pump up the price, fill shorts, close the wall and profit. Sure, price could still climb up from here but i wouldnt be opening a long, much more inclined to a short or flat. Since the wall has been up, price has risen from 7600 to 7675. An extra 1% margin on your short just for spoofing a wall...
Zero measurable/predictable bump.
Unless Messi is a secret TRX fan or Ronaldo decides to get a EOS tattoo I doubt we'll see any impact.
 I'm from Russia , zero bump 
Why was this downvoted? It seems like a legitimate question.  If I were at the World Cup, I'd certainly have a hot wallet with me.
I'd just do a poll (ofc right) because some people will downvote you for asking for upvotes, essentially.  I also would rather not downvote you lol 
Currently 6 downvotes on the symbolic 6/6. I don't know what to think now.
The overall sentiment of the daily has turned to bullish after the bounce. I am bearish though
It's probably going to be a sell the news event. People bought with the expectation of a price pump today
How can a coin like it lead and entire market??
Need to work on your labels. Got scripts?
This is absolutely impossible. Only Bitcoin can lead the market with its brilliant leadership and generous trading volume, you must be some sort of troller.
Selling coins on gdax is not shorting. Think you need the summer school bro. 
maybe happy got best price for his btc in 15 days.
I think you misunderstood. It showed the highest and lowest points landing on the 6th of each month (and it turns out that's not even true. It's off by 1-3 days sometimes). Next time read it properly.

This 6th of June, it's supposed to be the low point, a day of red, then it starts going bull **after** today. I think most of us didn't believe in it but what you can pull out of the pattern is that the Highs and Lows are tightening. 
that wasn’t what the meme was anyway and it’s just a meme 
All TA, conspiracies, whales, dingo’s ate my baby is bullshit.
Why do you keep making ragequit posts and then deleting them?
See you next month
Oh, I thought you were out 2 months ago...? Well, too bad it did not work out for you. Hope you will find your fortune somewhere else.
Capit-u-later my friend
Bottom is in boys.
Face melting pump in 3....2....1
Nicely timed! good trade
Bills are stacking? Oof. Yeah get out my man
Then by your logic triple bottom is myth too?
If you think the market is predictable, it's about to eat you. Run!
Do it long term >1 year  and compare to buy and hold.

One good BTC run you miss can wipe out all your gains in my opinion.  Congrats on doing so well so far though.  Maybe it will continue!
The bart movements will stop when the bulls no longer fall for the tricks and manipulation , but it looks like the bulls never learn... these movements can go on forever.
We go up or down. Noted. Thanks for your contribution.
What is the point in posting this nonsense?

You've said we will go up, or down, by a few hundred dollars soon. Well yes it seems highly unlikely that the price of btc would remain constant and not fluctuate a few % up or down. 

What scintillating analysis.
Not sure why you're getting downvoted. Your TA is just as helpful as anyone else's 
If you actually believe what you just wrote, I hope you're sitting fully in fiat until $8,200 or $5,500 comes up...
Based on what? Or are you putting your username to work?
Have you been keeping up with the news at all?
Take it easy bro.. we have 1000 coins just like BTC and 100 times more tokens that can do the same thing as BTC.  If you want to blame anyone, blame all the people that want their own token/coin rather than develop apps centered around BTC.  At the end of this year we'll have two or three times as many as we have now.
[removed]
Someone's mad lol
You jinxed it damnit
I would have considered it at our 2x failed attempt at 10k a few weeks back 
Sweet, so either up down or sideways.
Looks almost like a soundwave. Maybe if you feed the chart into an amp, you'll hear Satoshi whisper his private key.
It looks like there's too much stuff going on, but there isn't really. Each crash consists of 3 major drops, and during the crash, there are retests of important high volume-nodes.

After retest #1, 2nd drop follows. After retest #2, 3rd drop follows. (the percentages of the drops are displayed by the red rectangles)

Each drop seems to be pretty uniform in % terms, so I'm projecting another 20% drop from here
Thanks, I'm just concerned if a BGD to 8200 would invalidate this whole concept
Essentially, yeah. if we do fall thru here and things get Uber bearish I wouldn't be surprised to see this range be the top of a big bounce/relief rally

Even before the BGD we had almost 0 movement in the $7ks. Generally zoomed through it 
From reading over there in the past it seems like more than a few people chucked some bitcoin into the ETH ICO.
Green dot on chart, see?


More seriously I’m not totally sure what those indicators are but I’m always up for some hopium. Also why is there a mark at the 14,000-ish level? Is that supposed to be a price target?
I think even the most experianced traders have a hard time trying to figure out bitcoin. I relate it to trying understand a woman, just when you think you have her figured out..she cuts off your Johnson and throws it in a field.
Bullish
/u/l14dy is your guy then
> sesquipedalian

I must be high, this can't be an actual word
This.
So, is this opening a short or closing a long?
One buyer pushed the price from 6524 to 7698 , then he dumped and pushed the price back to 7524.
Wicked all the way back to 7525 on that, so much slippage
We are trying to rationalize the irrational, let's not forget the exact same thing happened the other day when we retraced to 7350. Best to just ignore these shorter timeframes and let the longer ones play out.
I agree 
I'd like to think of it as a public service announcement, especially with the unnecessary growing hostility between people.

We are all frustrated with this market, but let's not be dicks
Sometimes I get caught up reading all the drama and watching charts, then I zoom out to see that the big move is barely detectable within a single candle.  
It's never going to 5K, and now is an extremely bad time to be short.
mex traders are giving me money for holding a short and futures premium is increasing while we continually fail to break the same resistance. 

so I don't think that's true 
The Sept premium has increased by 50% in the last 12 hours.  That's more like permabull delusion than bearish.  Swaps lost their small discount too.
see told you
It's really hard to premeditate this, because September futures are in their own world right now.  Around 6am UTC the premium jumped and it's as if september has two levels of support within the same flag.  If I had opened this on spot, it would already be breakeven right now rather than in the green.

So I guess I'll close if spot looks like it's gonna break back down out of the upward channel, which hopefully will be not so far from break even on Sept.

Honestly idc which way it goes at this point, just feels like someone doesn't want us to leave this range 
Funny to remember, but of course the day came and went without the prophecy coming true
Hey, shhhhh. 
I dunno man, I made the best profits of my life in my time frequenting that subreddit. Of course, that was a long while ago now. 
I explained below :)
RSI was high, the price was at a local high, there was less price stability, during the stable period price hovered against resistance instead of support, and there was no symmetric triangle.
So how does this translate into someone (like me) who just has some cash on the sidelines who wants to throw in, and is just looking for a  entry point... wait to confirm above 7.8 or wait for double bottom? I've been hearing the phrase "No trade zone" for the last several days and I'm taking it seriously.... but my main objective is if I have a couple grand I want to throw back in I want a decent statistical assurance we're not headed back under 6k again. Trend-following, I guess.

Edit- and I want to say I appreciate coming here frequently as I mostly inhabit /r/cryptocurrency and appreciate the (mostly) intellectual and perhaps somewhat slightly bearish bias in this sub.
Maybe I'll just try my hand at being a guppy market maker lol

(edit: not serious, these movements actually make that significantly *more* risky)
And this ETF would be backed by BTC, were the previous ETF's BTC backed as well or just pegged?
Define your moon.
This is almost the only motivation I really have for holding my long at this point.  

So I'm doing a George Costanza, success lies in doing the opposite of what I feel I should do.
yes but it  means that for real big money can come in, since they love regulation  
But of ETH is counted as a regulated security instead of something in the middle, this would create more confidence for the markets or ?
How? Doubtful ETH itself is a security, and if random ERC20s *are* securities, then Coinbase will be able to list them since they are now licensed to do so.
I feel like there're a lot of other lines you're failing to read between
yessir, I think we've been here longer than we were at $6.5k now.

and since we've just been ranging in the big triangle weekly bbands are getting very tight 
Premium creeping up + longs were paying shorts

June futs at $120 premium, was at $70-80 a few days ago, was like $50 at its lowest
[deleted]
What price?
And what do they want? 
Six months isn’t a very long time in a market that’s ten years old 
Fixed it. 
Yea, it usually works but isn’t now for some reason. 
Not much stopping it from going to 8k.
It's never the end of the pump. This is Bitcoin. It's been one big bear trap since Day One. Smart money buys, dumb money sells. Same old story.
It’s okay, it actually makes a lot more sense by looking at it on a linear graph. So I’m all good now. I would have deleted the comment were it not for my edit. 
I think we have to wait for alts to consolidate into a focused and developed market first.  Novogratz calls for a field of 5 - 10 surviving alts. He expects to see alts merge, too.
Sounds about right to me. It will be after the next halving, for sure.
Check the price this time last year
can you say you are up 4900%? I can...
They aren't shaking out people but emptying their bags , many loyal bulls will keep placing buy orders again and again so its easy for them, now wait for the mother of all dumps.
Unless the move before is the run up to 20k. Then breaking up would be a continuation of that trend, and the more likely outcome. 
Sure. https://imgur.com/a/1Ylt9Ux

Chose a timeframe then select the lowest low and drag it to the highest high. 
You gotta draw fib levels yourself (click drag, click). Many ways to draw them, highly subjective so take with grains of salt
So maybe take positions that are 2x the size you normally do, and sell half after one move, then set break even stops.
In a scalper market, yes. But most OGs / long term holder come out of the woods only on +-10% days.
Been in this market long? No. 3% is totally insignificant.  Do it ten times in a row, then we'll talk.
[Chart](https://imgur.com/a/3rf2pg3)

I'm talking about the smaller one. 

That bigger one could play out until the 14th but in that case BTC should fall to 7350 or so.
It's like a poll asking about your sex life, of course everyone tells the truth
Yes, I was thinking the same thing!  u/noeeel, can you set this up?  :D
Yes took a short at 7690. For now looking at that 7460 level. 

That was the low for June 4 daily candle so potential for a nice daily swing low if we find some reaction there. 

I like the 7460-7540 for a low over the next 24 hours. 

Below there its gonna be "muh head and shoulders" and we blow through the pink weekly level and retest the lows. 

I don't have the 7570 level as being of any significance. 
It’s actually not too risky. Decent R/R it’s just the chop and barts that provide the risk.

Bailing anything under the new local $7380 which would confirm this apparent H&S wouldn’t be to bad of a loss. 

Potential 60-100$ loss or a $200-$300 upside 
until we can! 
Wow, never seen this. If you switch "instrument" to "planet" this gets really captivating!
very cool. Thanks.
I dont recommend  listening to this on full blast 5 minutes after you wake up 
i just saw one transaction for over 11 mil!
Wow, that's really cool!
wtf, thats awesome
Admiral!  There be whales here! 
Thanks.  I set very loose stops below 7k as i don’t have too much time to watch price right now.   I may hold this long for a while.  I think we will stay in this chop for another week and then maybe we’ll finally break 8k.  
I should’ve longed at 7500. Not unhappy about taking profit though. I guess I’ll sit in the sidelines and see if it’s an ascending triangle to 7900 or a reversal. 
Of course they are.  Some nuckas here trade *moon cycles.*  
  
Welcome to the party.
Don't be surprised if they are. Once something like this becomes common knowledge it is usually invalidated pretty quickly. We'll know in a few days if there is still a correlation. 
I am

simply because its such a reach, that I'm betting a lot of people are shorting it. Which means if it does decide to pump, all those shorts will panic close, fueling a BGD. 

We've been consolidating at $7600 for almost a day now without going back down so I feel pretty safe in this position...that said if it breaks $7480 I'll close since it would mean it broke downwards  


I really wish I had traded the previous 5 times it moved in unison with the futures closing before the 6th.

It would take quite a bit of cognitive dissonance to not see this pattern.  Whether it repeats again who knows, but I'm sure there were people on the 3rd, 4th time saying "it won't repeat."

I bought 7621 :(
Everyone knows about everyone knowing that everyone knows about the 6th pattern. 4D chess baby
I don't follow what you mean
> You truly can trade on how wrong bitmex is

This isn't accidental. The market is zero sum. The people who profit, even the ones who just hodl, need to make that money off of someone else. Someone else's bank account value (in fiat) has to go down for theirs to go up from trading. Bitmex is made up of a ton of overleveraged and emotional traders who are lined up to be the ones whose bank accounts will continually go down.
Bear flags and bull flags are useless in crypto imo. I think they probably have a less than 10% chance of actually breaking the way they're supposed to. I never trade on flags because they are SO unreliable. 
Yeah I didn't count, 9 of 10 made my point. Also this is your own very specific criteria here. 
which is why 7700 is just noise
When it's a green day?
got alarms set tho ;)
you'd think people would stop falling for spoofy but damn 
Right? I read this, switched back to the charts and screamed
Potentially the most accurate comment in this thread lol
We've seen a slow and steady growth of $200 in a weeks time. Perhaps what we need is more confidence in the market. It is already increasing but we need more..
If you think this is boring, just wait until later I feel like.  We still have several months to go to fill out this wedge and the oscillations are getting damped.  Hopefully it breaks upwards before we reach the tip of it.
Last time it felt very powerful how the buyers made what I call a upwards u-turn from around $7,300 on 30th, though there was less confidence. Now there is more confidence. Right, lessgetit!
Not necessarily, staying above the 200 Week LSMA would indicate a continuation of the current 4 Year trend. Also, looks like RSI is refusing to go bearish.
When did all the smart people show up on this sub?  For days it's been nothing but "bag holder" "goblin town" "delusional" bots.
Do you mean this one? What endpoints are you using?

that wick was NASTY
i know, but it's fun to think about. and at one point, sellers will be out of btc to sell :P
You know the game: buy high, sell low


/s
Disagree. When BTC takes over, all the alts will dump as money will flow back into BTC and that would be a perfect time for an alt crash. Even Binance lead investor for $1B fund mentions how she wants to wait before investing - a 360 is needed.
lol

totally
Well the barting is certainly predictable. The direction, not so much 
why does it bother you? I always get a laugh watching the bitfinex liquidation geyser.
From the ashes a Phoenix is reborn.

But in all seriousness I never said it would automatically trigger a new cycle? I just want it to do something... *anything*.
We're 6+ months post ATH. It should have happened by now... not that it still can't, but It would have been more appropriate chart-wise if it followed the re-rise to 11.7k in March. 
[deleted]
Honestly, I’ve got a small stack to mess around with on Binance, and just buying alts after a dump, waiting for BTC to recover, then cashing out to Tether has been working pretty well for me the past week or two. This seems pretty untradeable at the moment for leverage trading, so it keeps things interesting while we wait here in $7k purgatory.

(Edit: This is more of an altcoin discussion post though)
patience patience!!!
I always thought a "shake out" would be falling prices, which shake out the "weak hands".

But I believe we are now witnessing another kind of "shake out". The kind that shakes out day traders. And it's really *shaking* this time.
Probably. My question pertains to the psychology of individuals continuing to buy/sell.
It's hard to make a profit because bitcoin hasn't moved much in the last few weeks. Traders make money off volatility and bitcoin has just been real flat. 

This isn't going to continue though. 

Edit: "few weeks" it's been like a week and a half in the mid 7ks. It just feels like forever
It is. The market needs to shake out somebody, always. With the lack of hype the next victims are traders. The tape is painted constantly even on the indicators. Also we can see an indecision in the market, which is not surprising right now.  
Challenge accepted! 

*sells 0.005 bitcoin* ha!  eat my dust old man
may 24 2018, 4 days before drop to $7040, 2 days after dump below $8k. 

We were at $7300-7600 that day 

$5999: 167 - 54%

$10001: 140 - 46% 

Meaning sentiment is turning bullish while we literally go sideways :p 
The price went down after the 6th because the weekend (7-8) happened. There's been always a dip after every weekend in past 2 months. So kinda, "futures theory" collided with "weekend theory" there.


They've not been successful in manipulating the market.  The goal was probably to get the price down to $3-4K and kill interest.  That didn't happen.  Due to the immutable nature of the blockchain, it will be difficult for them to use the same tricks they're accustomed to using in traditional markets.  They'd probably have a lot more luck with ETH or some other more centralized, less powerful chain.

[Edit to clarify] The "killing interest" part is the market manipulation.  I read on here that manipulating the price is not the same as manipulating the market. They've clearly dropped the price but not enough to cause a panic and kill interest.

With regard to the enormous hash power of the chain: I suspect that naked shorting has been going on at exchanges, ie, more coins have been lent than the exchanges actually have on hand.  If the big bulls start to move a lot of coins off exchange, exchanges themselves may have to scramble to buy which would cause a massive upward price movement.  On a weaker chain that can be reset, as ETH has been twice in its short history, certain people could probably quietly buy their way out of the problem.
there are maybe 100 arguments why cryptos are better or worse, but just for the 0815 average person it is a "nice to have" within the normal banking industry and the banks could here improve a bit... its good to take notice from that, not more...
Yeah thats typically banks in the uk. So annoying had many payments and transfers blocked for buying plane tickets etc. Good security but so annoying.
> Value is based on speculation around establishing a global currency that isn't the US dollar.

Like the Euro?

I'm guessing you mean, a non-fiat global currency.
How to detect hidden buy and sell walls? Sorry for offtopic.
Then at what point does legit looking demand become a bearish buy wall? Only when it's flashing and moving ? We all see that all the time. Just looking for other opinions . . 
he's short, he's betting on it being pulled...?
how big was it?
We will never know. One thing for sure is that the U.S. investigation on spoofing and market manipulation in general is not doing jack right now
Nice, glad it worked out!
How about you take your own advice brother? 
You can read a lot from a spoof bid. People with >1m that want to enter into BTC would generally be wise to: 

A) Use trading desks that leverage access to high liquidity to make the purchases with little slippage and at optimal prices.

B) Not opt to place their buy order in one large chunk on an exchange like bitstamp that has extremely low spot volume.

C) Not opt to place their large buy order on a lower volume exchange at a time where volume is extremely low.

This bid is for 7.5M and it has barely been sold into. If this person wanted bitcoin so badly at 7620, they'd buy it across multiple exchanges in smaller parcels. Its not logical for a person to do this if they were a genuine buyer, therefore you can assume a high likelihood that they are trying to spoof the market. It could be to increase the price to sell coins elsewhere, it could be to increase the price to open a large short.
It very well could, to be honest this feels like our climb to 11.6k all over again, where volume was pitful and the market was being held up by a few large buy walls.

See /u/mandy7 's great question/criticism below yours.
This is a really excellent point, and I'm glad that I can respond to that down here.

I think this shows what you're talking about visually.

There's variance instability that really needs to have a proper analysis done, but visually, I think we can shortcut that by boxing up these low volatility and high volatility periods with progressively shorter candles.

I’m not sure what you exactly mean with the bars being numbered. Do you mean the price range percentages? 
The world's longest recorded living bear was Debby, a female polar bear born in the Soviet Union at some point in 1966. She died on November 17th 2008 in Canada at either age 41 or 42.
Why do you think we need to make a lower low? Are you saying to confirm the flag? Because it's already an upwards channel that's moving on decreasing volume after a sharp drop. Pretty much  a textbook bear flag 

Unless I'm mistaken about the shape or something. The initial break from the pole is kinda funky I guess 
If you’re a bull right now one could argue you’re equally as delusional. That’s probably why we’re [consolidating](https://www.tradingview.com/x/cpBtg8Rd/).

Psychologically speaking, we like to see things chart up, not down.
Do you really not understand this post?
he said inverse chart. as in if you flip the chart upside down 
In case you haven't noticed, the right side of Bart's head is only half as long as the left.  So yes, bullish.

Prob. Of a valid H&S in a bearmarket , is higher than a Inv H&S.  Just keep an eye..
Most H&S or iH&S's people discuss don't have the correct volume profile. This one seems to have a better chance of being valid than some others, seeing a high volume break of the neckline would confirm it.

Agree that until that happens it's just more chop/noise, though.
We've been creating H&S patterns for months dude. They almost all got confirmed while many inverse H&S failed to confirm.

Some of them don't necessarily look like H&S patterns but you can apply the same tactics on them to trade them.  


Ugly messy chart but you get the point: [https://www.coinigy.com/s/i/5b180ff83724f/](https://www.coinigy.com/s/i/5b180ff83724f/)

I’ll be there to catch it with my .05 BTC buys stacked on the way down.

Sir, you seem to be correct 
Yea Uber is a multi billion dollar company. I think it would be hard to split and break up the partners.

The article in question
BTC isn't "Bitcoin" as described in the whitepaper or as it functioned from 2009\-2015, due to intentionally limited block size and its fee market, layer 2 'scaling', SegWit, RBF, etc.  It's something else now.  Bitcoin Segwit (BTC) or Bitcoin Core (BTC) describe it aptly.
Bro, no need to be condescending.

We don't know that this is about to break up for sure. Could very easily be another fake out before a drop
muh meme lines
Sell signal 
Love the down votes even tho you were right. Sentiment is still incredibly bearish in here.
the daily and standard
it was more than 980,and there is buying across ALL exchanges. So paranoid that you reply to yourself!
So about the same as the end of CNY, Wall St. bonuses, Income Tax Refunds, etc.
Because it sounds like the new *Thanksgiving dinner* or *Wall Street bonuses* shill meme 
I didn't know how to do one. I'm pretty new to reddit itself actually
Now that would be hilarious. Basically that would mean Asia dumped on us
sell the 6/6 news?
I have no idea. I'm still trying to figure that out.
EOS actually topped Bitcoin's trading volume for a few days recently. It's the most hyped thing since Ethereum last May / June. 
I remember you telling me that good labels go a long way, and for the life of me, I still label shit a, b, c, d, e.
I can see how you would conflate my first sentence with the second paragraph and beyond, but there is a reason why it was broken out into its own paragraph.  

Overrun by bots as it is, GDAX is the best indicator of true market sentiment precisely because of the fact that you can't use leverage there.  Leverage distorts things because gambling losers overuse it. So GDAX is the one I monitor most.

 
He's part of Olesentv's psyops team meant to confuse sentiment bots and bear whales into thinking the bottom is in 
One guy sold, bottom's in

this reminds me of that one guy who sold $6.3k and bought $11.3k. People were like longing $11k+ snickering "wow tell us when you sell again!" 

He sold $11.6k lmao...dude learned hella quick
No, because a triple bottom is an unprecedented event for Bitcoin if I remember correctly.
No reason to miss a bull run, even if you are a scalper.  Some traders are capable of both.  But smart traders don't hold in a bull market.  They short and scalp.
well part of it is he gives no reasoning. we're just supposed to assume he has good reasons for thinking that's what will happen...?
Are you saying you don’t trade off of other people’s wild hunches?
Ta/ Fa, been trading bitcoin since 2013.  You don't need to listen to me, nor should you , just wanted post my speculation so I can look back on it. 
What news?
Yes I have.  I'm just not delusional like many others are.
Yes, they are attacking all of crypto currency, not just Bitcoin.  

"You can't kill Bitcoin", but you can make it illegal and almost impossible to use productively.
go back to ethtrader thanks
You’re probably right. It’s doubtful it will go backward 
This might be the most funny comment I’ve ever seen on this forum, LOL.
Man, that might actually be interesting.  Play the day over 30 seconds or so on 1-min candles. 
Only if you play the sound in reverse.
OK I see now. Thanks!

Interesting!
Possible. I'm thinking I'll sit out for awhile. Nice to gain a little ground today but always seems the gains slip back down or are rekt. Been going to hell since March. 
Why does it need to fill the gap? I don't see a PnF case for it on any timeframe
Price target for the breakout of the huge symmetric triangle. So not for a current move.
It appears he has marked an inverted h&s pattern there. The green dot is his buy point, so target would be 2X the height from the top of the head to the neckline. I'll let someone else figure it out. He was right on with the same BCH pattern the other day. 

Edit: I think it's a tease just like the floating 14K target for the triangle breakout. He knows these things get attention and he doesn't answer the questions about them.
Yes that 14xxx is the .618 retracement, that is his target if we break the symmetrical triangle to the upside. 
Ok cool. Yeah I enjoy reading his comments.
If you like that, you'll love its sillier derivation, hippopotomonstrosesquipedalian

it's a short from what I saw. think it's a whale just trying on different pairs of shorts. can't seem to find a pair he likes 
If this is indeed the case, seeing as the BARTS recently have all (re)-initiated at a price point higher than where the previous dump occurred, it would imply that a whale pushing the price up has an asymmetric effect on the market. That is, people are more responsive to increase in prices as opposed to decreases. This gives me the inclination that this market is very much still bullish, despite the cataclysmic diatribes of the bears in this thread.
Exactly. I don't anticipate that it's going to get any less frustrating any time soon, either.
And if it does what are you going to do, scream manipulation? 
If we break down here I think we have a while to fall -  SFP, lots of trapped longs and worn out buyers after taking the stairs up and lift down. If we break up, I don't think we have a long chad given the 7.8 - 8k resistance, not that many shorts open and buying pressure not so strong. (I'm partially hedged short and have bearish bias but dont mind either direction)
On perpetual price is lagging (no premium) but shorts are getting paid! how is that ?
Let's go again.  Too bad I let the other position go.  Before I went to a meeting, I shoulda set a break even stop loss.  But didn't because the lack of stop losses is why I still had the position in the first place, since it didn't get wicked out.  But then when I came back after the meeting to it in a loss I impulsively closed to not get worse.

The difference in entrance isn't so bad though.

!long xbtu18 7728 5X 90%

I wasn't here in 2017. I'm curious. What was going to supposedly happen?
Yeah but price is most similar. I'd be more confident if the dates didn't line up so closely. It'd be strange if the entire bear market played out very similarly to 2014. That'd probably make me believe the Bilderberg conspiracies. Hell, I might switch over to BCash if that happens.
Wait for confirmation of break up on 7.8 or break down of 7.3 (this is more risky as support of higher lows lies somewhere around 7150 also). This range is like a coin toss now. Entering here might get you lucky or in big loss. Breaking 7.8 should put us on the way to test 9k.

Triangle breaks above 9k, that should be a confirmation of at least mid term reversal and that should be good entry point for longer term.

But remember, it's all about r/r. Nobody will tell you for sure. The points I mentioned here are the points where you can go with $100 SL and lose just a little if it turns around.
Some were going to hold bitcoin and some were going to use cme/cboe futures
My moon right now is 15k. yeah... :D
Long term? Potentially. Short term? Nope. Would immediately cause every other exchange to either fall in line with regulations or delist it - i'd wager they would rather the latter.
>How?

ETH had an ICO - ETH does not fall under the currency blanket as it aims to be fuel for the 'World computer' . It is used as a crowdfunding tool for pretty 99% of ICO's. If all of this doesn't sound like a security then i dunno man.
Breaking weekly bbands should be epic. Whichever direction.
But mex futures premium just follows okex futures. It's mex swap where the main bitmex trading happens, and there we have the deafult 0.01% rate.
I think he means short term. If we do break up I think we'll go 9k max.
more bitcoin! when do they want it? only they know...
That's the million fucking dollar question that I wish I had the answer too!
Now it works. Would be nice if it played out that way.
Nope. And well beyond.  

By the end of summer, we'll be doing the moon dance with champagne flowing for bulls (or bear tears which are just as intoxicating.  Bears will have to settle for bull urine, most likely.  If they had been a little nicer, maybe we'd give them some Budweiser which is pretty close to bull piss.  Anyway...)
The way some of you guys talk its as if there will be one guy left trading BTC all by himself to control the price at their whim.
Yet down 62&#37; since I called it an obvious bubble @ 18k back in early December and you had your hissy fit.

Meanwhile Bombardier up 72&#37; over the same period and I've been sitting on call options the whole time... (just wait for the action through to early August too).

You truly do suck Ellis.
Never seen two people disagreeing and both being so equally incredibly wrong at the same time.
True, but it looks like the symmetrical triangle is formed after the downtrend. So on technical terms it should be a continuation of that.
This is where I am at, we're in a massive consolidation triangle that begins at ATH.
The move before the triangle is very clearly down. If you include the movement before it's not a symmetrical triangle, it's actually more of a descending one. 

But Peter even said himself the chances.

I would defer to his charting knowledge over anyone else's really. I will look it up and see though
The problem is if it goes the other way, even with tight stops you'll end up losing more. Unless its a established channel and you only play the outer values to minimize risk
I'll take 3% on a $500K position.
3% is 3%.  3% is significant.
If a poll is anonymous people tend to stick to the truth, as they dont fear social sanctioning or social benfits. I am asking this question in 3 different crypto subreddit and will compare the results later and make a post about it. 
Why aren't there any options for 100 billion?
haha grats, crazy ass market.
or can not.
No joke. Feels like we should all be taking a spa-day. :)
Agreed. Because it is common knowledge, any meaningful spike upwards may create a self-fulfilling prophecy?  
It also takes some mental gymnastics to come to the conclusion that the 6th of each month is the magical date at which all medium-term trends reverse.

Of course I can see that it has occurred several times now, but I remain convinced this is purely coincidence.
On longer time frames I've found most patterns are actually very reliable, particularly when they "confirm". Note neither $6k nor $6.5k looked like a bear flag 

If we break down here I don't expect it to bounce like most people, I believe the pole distance would play out and we'd move down $1000 
Current period is 13 days long. There are a fair number of those.
🙀
I honestly don't no what to make of it. I've seen volume both increase and decrease with the price rise AND price drop. It's like we are going from bullish to bearish to bullish to bearish (Bart is going to Bart I suppose)

The market is like asking your GF where she wants to eat, "idk/idc, all I know is I'm hungry"
A week is nothing.  We were also in the 9000K range for over a week.
This could last the whole year.

Tbh I'd be happy if we're at this price next year.
shorts also moving into the zone where they tend to get squeezed....

That’s the difference between traders and holders

We change our position when the charts show a trend reversal is coming 
The 4-1 low to the 5-5 high. Haven't updated it . . https://www.tradingview.com/x/lFUd2gN9/
this market is wild. it could totally push up again though and then we'd be like "who's selling the bottom?" -_-
I mainly just didn't wanna post a top comment so I hijacked yours sorry lol.

And yes, it's a guessing game how much btc there is to sell though. There is no reason to think sellers will ever "run out" really. there is plenty of supply to go around if demand falters :P
That was true back before 2014. Then Bitfinex came out and allowed you to sell Bitcoin you don't own.
BTC would need to really start pumping for people to start ditching alts for it.

Honestly I don't expect that to happen until we go parabolic again(if ever). 

When BTC just pumps 20-30%, alts are able to keep up, BTC needs to be doing 100% a day for it to outperform alts. (i.e. alts last time didn't really start losing value until about $4,000....so 4x gain from the $1,000 initial price)
I want to see some meaningful market movement instead of this boring chop.
Werd i gotcha
it is plausible that market manipulation (in both ways mind you) has distorted any time frame of that happening. Interest in crypto appears to be waning, but false tether liquidity is propping it up whilst potentially bearish pressure from CBOE/CME is suppressing tether from igniting another bull run

my guess is CBOE/CME is willing to keep suppressing till the tether bomb implodes and they win?
>  It should have happened by now... 

No it should happen later, and probably will.
There is nothing nonsensical about selling at a loss if you think it's going lower 
Lol. Do you not know what a stop loss is? There's nothing wrong with selling at a loss so you can buy back even lower.
Some here are better at guessing price action than others because of TA, experience, etc but nobody knows what is going to happen. My personal game plan is if we go under and stay under $7K I plan to sell because my belief is in that situation we could potentially create a lower low on the triple bottom. Of course how we get there and the price action below $7K may change my mind. Also I am still also 60% fiat so selling at, say $6700, realizing a loss (which will offset my realized tax gains from early in the year) and buying back at $6K is a good investment strategy since wash sale, at the moment is allowed in crypto. While some here may only invest in crypto, I have other investments so I look at the bigger picture. 

Although my entry was pretty shitty, I always have a game plan for certain scenario. Buying and forgetting is not one of them.
I appreciate the report! May that small stack grow ever larger!
I agree. I think someone wants to burn everyone using leverage so they don't have to pay for that leverage while they accumulate.
It will continue until it doesn't.

13 days. That's forever in Bitcoin. 13 days is a really long time to go sideways. It only happens a handful of times a year.
I don't think that was the goal. Bitcoin is here "means" not the "ends" of the manipulation. What happens here influences something out there. Futures? Maybe. But the cycle is very clear. Or maybe this isn't manipulation at all, just several bigger players showing the same mentality.

I may be biased here as a student of Lorenz's chaos theory which claims there are no coincidences, only patterns.

Plus, my understanding is that the Bitcoin futures are not about Bitcoin at all. I believe prestige in "their" success on trading Bitcoin futures is important (as people tend to point out to the low futures volume as a discouraging factor to the actual manipulation), if not as important as gains. Many hedge funds run on prestige building their reputation. If one handles "this new thing" right, it means they are progressive and forward looking. 
I share your sentiments as well. The people behind the scenes seem like they are trying to kill off crypto desperately but it doesn't seem like its working. The longer we stay at these levels, the more optimistic I am.
>  Due to the immutable nature of the blockchain, it will be difficult for them to use the same tricks they're accustomed to using in traditional markets.  

What, even if you were to prove that people actually did what you said, it's all been done off-chain on exchanges, what are you talking about?
The idea that the Euro could compete against the dollar as a global currency is way more absurd than Bitcoin competing against the dollar. The dollar is the only fiat currency that has a remote shot at it... And it's clearly more focused on oil contracts than supporting global trade.
Can't really. You just have to compare the volume and the price actually moved. For example, if 1m candle red volume was 500btc but the price barely moved down, we can infer that there was some hidden buy order
If there was legit demand, price movement wouldn't allow for those limit orders to be filled and people would be market buying
Ah yes, just seen the edit. My mistake u/daquity36 

(no down vote here)
it was showing 2k buy wall down to $7600 for me. but cryptowatch sucks lately so idk if it's right 
Right. The investigation needs to conclude; recommendations made, proposals written, everything run thru legal precedent, etc. Hell, could take several years . . 
Was a small position but is good to win sometimes. Now time to wipe those profits with stupid small trades...

If you hadn't close your drunk long you could also profit or at least close at break even. But i can't blame you for closing, i would have done the same
if you think you should only trade in one direction you obviously don’t understand trading. anyways, i’m not trying to be rude, sorry if i was.
there's definetely information you can get by anazyling it but it's information that you can't be really sure because you have no idea what's the plan behind it  , but saying that it's going to dump just due to seeing someone spoof a big buy wall is pure non sense
Yes, the Bart formation in its natural habitat.
Interesting. See, even that chart makes me think your argument that over BTC's lifetime volatility has trended down doesn't really hold. If your argument is we're entering a possibly prolonged period of low volatility I think you have a much better case.

I just really see nothing to indicate there that BTC's volatility year over year is going down based on the BBand width. I believe part of my original comment may have been misinformed as I was looking at BFX which was still a relatively new exchange in 2014, so it was naturally more volatile than Bitcoin overall (flash crashed down to $100 at one point where other exchanges didn't do nearly as bad).

Again, to truly get an answer we'd have to do a linear regression and see the slope and the R^2 value, but I don't really think the null hypothesis would get rejected there.
good bot
The bear flag does seem pretty extended... 
The bear flag is all white now, pal.  They're on the verge of capitulating.  Wave that white flag high, bears!
Yeah the initial break is what made me question it as well.
Yes, to confirm it.
It's an entertaining exercise but I don't think it has any validity. Upside and downside of a market are not symmetrical. The laws that rule upward movement are not the inverse of the laws that rule downward movement and psychology of confidence is not the simple opposite of the psychology of fear.
Ah makes sense then. 
I think he does, I just think he is saying this is more just noise (barts) rather than testing resistance 
I do. You're living in Bizarro World where everything is opposite.  Superman is a bad guy. Bitcoin's going to zero.  We're not already past the moon and well on our way to Mars. I get it.  
We could see another leg down.
Nah man(most havent sold most likely) just pointing out how every-time we pop up a few % means the bears are dead. Dead air silence for the poor bastards who have tried to hold long on the way down. No acknowledgement of the poor slain brethren bulls.
Maybe that’s why, but I’m pretty certain every h/s pattern has been invalidated/not reached its target but possibly that’s just due to volume. 
Not one of those is a head and shoulders.

They are all just pointy tits 
...than bet on it getting busted. Good luck bro
If there are a million people in the world like you, they're really not.
Heh. At least I hedged
Called it.
Previous denial included the comment that the exchange trading it must have surveillance sharing with a significant market that is trading the underlying commodity or a derivative on that commodity and that market must be regulated(CBOE/CME). 

Also, for anyone who TLDR this, it is backed by the underlying asset and has a $200K min in order to protect retail investors.
Hi there! If you're new to the space, check out r/bitcoinbeginners. They'll get you caught up on the fundamentals of cryptocurrency and clear up your confusion.
I wonder what kind of horrible experiences you had in your life that led you to this point of coming to this sub and post this nonsense 
You are correct yet you are getting downvoted. I hate the big disputes between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash but I won’t downvote facts. 
Sure but the news has been overwhelmingly positive.
This.
Exactly. We have no idea, lol. I feel like this might as well be a coin toss so imo you should wait for some kind of confirmation instead of trying to catch a knife. 
I agree with you that there is no need to be condescending.

But fakeouts work in both directions.  What does 9 years of historical data tell you about Bitcoin?  Is an up move more likely to be fake or a down move?
huh? of course there would be buying across all exchanges if there is a 7.5M spot bid on one exchange. Not paranoid here, comfortable, wanting to offer some commentary.
My favorite is still the valentines day drop.
Also new to the internet?
Alt shills have decided that they can make that claim, provide no supporting evidence, and use that false claim as justification to break rule 2.

Correlation != Causation
It probably topped BTCs spot volume tho. Most of BTC trading is on bitmex. Also most of EOS volume is wash trading.
Meh... It works until you start having to modulating your mnemonics... or work with others.
It happens. One reversed the 2014 bear market.
You can  make nice money with the manipulations but the money must come from somewhere, some people lose allot because they follow the bart movements.
Yeah I guess a screenshot of a laser light show would have helped
Only Chad's and Stokinator's.
Funny that you think a target of 8, 12k or 5k is wild. 

In 2014 I was a lunatic for thinking we'd have a bubble that would take us to 3k+ when we were in the mid 200s. 
Fair enough but people would benefit more from you including the substance backing up your prediction.

I've also been trading BTC for about the same amount of time.
And when you do look back you'll come here and proclaim you were correct, because you covered all bases? 
SEC official declared that BTC isn't a security, Coinbase wanting to offer Security Tokens etc. 

In general, good news that is just laying the foundation for regulations to be hashed out soon and it's showing market maturity. There honestly hasn't been anything generally put out that points to a bad future for crypto. 
Referencing yourself in the second person is pretty weird
I re-entered most of my alt positions back a few days ago. If you zoom out on the daily, we've just been bouncing in this region for a while. In my eyes, it looks like we're in an accumulation zone. Not even worried about the prices unless it drops past $7.2k.
What does PnF stand for?
I don't even know if it's a common technical thing but we've generally undergone price discovery + chop in every single range from $6k to $14k now. $7k was the only range we hadn't done it yet.

This isn't including $2-5k, which is part of the reason I think we're headed down there. There was like 10 days in total where the price was in $3000-3999 range

Mean reversion, vwvp etc. Check out 2014-2015 after blow off top and they filled out every single range they skipped on the way up before bull running back up 

I mean it doesn't have to happen. I just have a hard time thinking the entire market really believes $6k is the cheapest bitcoin should ever be again before bubbling ahain (if it does). I think the euphoria takes a very long time to wear off 
That would be nice. It's a big if though.
It seems we’ve got quite the logophile here.
Haha, classic.

How can you tell the difference?  Wouldn't it just look like a sell on the order books?
the bears here just write a lot. The market is overwhelmingly bullish.  

We're  like SJWs on the internet. We seem a lot more present than we really are 

Twitter polls I've seen show the market is roughly 2/3 bullish 1/3 bearish 

obviously not super accurate but generally anyone who owns crypto is bullish on it 
A 1000 BTC dump has no effect but a 1000 BTC buy will prop up the markets in the short term. Imagine when all these permabulls turn bearish..., markets will drop to 4000 $ in a few hours... we only need a black swan event.
Too scary!

!long xbtu18 close 7755


u/-StarLust- , who is actually still here and posted in yesterday's daily, made a post in Ethtrader saying he's from the future and April 14 would be a day that Ethereum would pump hugely. 

While obviously people didn't think he was a timetraveler, it was an exciting time of growth for the coin and some people thought he was actually an industry insider trying to convey information about some big news. 

Of course, he was just making up crap and no doubt had no idea people would take it seriously. When the day came he posted a trollface and tried to pretend he wasn't horribly embarrassed. And the price did nothing. 
I made an edit to provide more clarification.

What do you mean when you say that the price is similar?
I'd bet on the beginning of next year. Depends on how long this sideways period goes and how long it takes for alt markets to come back down to earth.
> ETH had an ICO

ETH had an ICO many years ago, and its development is probably less centralized than something like LTC or BCH. I also think that Ethereum's ICO was run by a non-profit should change its status.

> ETH does not fall under the currency blanket as it aims to be fuel for the 'World computer'

It does everything that BTC or LTC can do, I don't see why it can't be a currency. Does Bitcoin's scripting language make it a security? Does Rootstock make it a security?

> It is used as a crowdfunding tool for pretty 99% of ICO's

Not sure how this makes it more or less of a security. Is Kickstarter a security? No... it's a platform. But I will agree nearly every single ERC20 is a security.

funding rate seems more related to Bitfinex vs stamp + Dax anyway. 

but okay, if they follow OKex then OKex is dumb as fuck. 

Bitmex futures were in backwardation at $9600...and they only went to a premium when we dropped ans bounced. then it went to $400 premium...Which is where we got rejected. 

Last time spot was at sub $8k we were at a discount. BGD. Now we're at a premium. Sure it seems too obvious but I'm honestly wondering if it's that simple 
He has a dot at 14.8k though
TIL 4900% < 72% lulz. I'm so sorry you cashed out all of 400 bucks of whatever your poor ass invested in, meanwhile I'm still sitting on 7-figures.
I put a lot of weight into Brandt myself too. Rare I give a trader that much belief. 

But I have to wonder if the parabolic nature of the bubble somehow alters this. 

As in, $10K to $20K was the bubble effect, which $1K to $10K was the bull market that really created this symmetrical triangle. Consolidating in the triangle between $13K - $6K seems to imply it’s really consolidating with $9Kish as the median price. If the bubble part never happened consolidating this way would mean up. 

I wonder if this skews the ratio at all. 
Then another choice is to go regular scale, and just sell half after one move, and potentially limit the ultimate profits.  

Feels lame taking those low profits though.  But if I had done that for recent break evens, it would have added up nicely.
My favorate poll yet. Have always pondered how much other people trade with. And yes agree with this. 
I’m also curious to see how much money people have in crypto or % of net worth. Want to see how I stack up against other degenerate gamblers. 
Only managed to snag 2 more entries. My “ theory “ post played out with a higher low at $7500 and rejected off $7650 again.

Let’s see what happens 
What do you think the probability is that something like that would reverse five times in a row on or near the 6th every time?  It has to be very low.

Napkin math (probably wrong, but an attempt):

coin flip 5 times = 1/2 each time so 5 correct is 1/32

30 days in a month, let's say it gets it close to 3 days on each month around the 6th = 1/10

Chance this would happen at random = 1/320.
Agreed. I've been sitting out of the market for months waiting for this to play out.
I'm with you on the bounceless 1k drop. It's looking like there is a possibility to go up a few hundred tho.

On the 4hr if you have both default ichi and cryto ichi on the same chart, we're in a no-man's land between clouds. Have you ever seen people use both the default and crypto clouds together on the same chart like that?
It will bounce, there will be always buyers. The point is that height of those bounces might not be so big.
That's your period, defined by your criteria. 
hahaha, that is a great way of interpreting it lol. Yes its quite a lot like a zig-zag pattern..
I don't think its about squeezing the shorts really, its more like traders are really looking forward to the market to pick it's immediate short term direction, whether its the lower or the higher $7k range.
That purge zone is 20k btc wide
Thanks bud
yep i'm concerned about that though added to short at 7660, stops 7860 and up, also opened a decent hedge short
run out in as "why sell here if I can sell 1000 higher"
Eh, who do you think borrows those btc...
Hell of an argument you made there bud.
I mean they'll just come back when it's volatile again. the only situation in which traders don't come back is one in which btc slow moons. No more ridiculous gains, since mooning causes big volatility 
So worst case scenario is a 2.5 year dip down in goblintown and after that, like all the other projections on the chart, is moon? Is that what I'm seeing from this chart?

Yes I know past performance yadda yadda...
Usually before a massive move 

To me all signs point to a repeat of the BGD from april
Why would they want to kill it? Can you explain (I mean this is a non-hostile way)? Because logically, it would be much more profitable to them to work with it than against it. 

So the "futures manipulation" is either "drop on the 6th, then pull up next month, then drop again", or maybe, "just drop it on the 6th and it will rise up on its own; then drop it again". 

If the second case, then the manipulation only made crypto stronger. It works against huge odds and still rises up, succeeding.
Thank you.
Ahh, I see. Thanks a lot for your answer!
Good point.
there's a strong case to make that this wall was the reason price moved from 7600 to 7675 and is now sustained at 7630, given that the price increase correlates directly with when the bid was placed. The preceding candles for 3 hours had almost zero action.
Thank you.
That's really interesting. We're making very different conclusions from our observations of these charts. I want to get to the bottom of this.

Here's something that stands out to me:

Thanks! You can ask me for more facts any time. Beep boop.
The Spectacled Bear is sometimes known as the Andean Bear because they live in the Andes Mountains.
😅😅😅
Even if it's not a perfect bear flag, it's a weak channel on decreasing volume. I have a hard time going long/unhedging here even if the short term direction is up
Gotcha, fair enough 
Great point, and I totally agree. Turning it upside down actually makes this more apparent because you realize there are significantly more downwards wicks than there are upwards ones. Reversals from up trends happen slowly, rarely are they blow off tops. Reversals from downtrends are very frequently capitulation wicks. 

However it doesn't mean you can't remove bias by analyzing large patterns and see things differently by flipping  it upside down 
Yeah the chart doesn't look that bearish when you look at it from the normal perspective but if you turn it upside down, it looks extremely bullish to the point where I'd start thinking about a x25 entry and most would agree, there wouldn't be many bears here. Which means it's actually a bearish looking chart. 
You don't even see those barts if you zoom out and watch the daily chart for the last 8 month or so. 
More like a journey to the center of the earth.

I don't really recall one I thought was a valid pattern in recent memory.

These types of patterns are annoying because so many people know what it looks like and show it but ignore volume or the preceding price movement. Since the H&S/iH&S is essentially trying to capture a very specific market sentiment, volume on it is critical. For the same reason, it's strictly a reversal pattern and some people try to draw them as a continuation pattern.

That second point is one reason to be skeptical of this one, but you can make the argument it'd be a reversal of the current uptrend since we hit 7k.

Slightly off topic, but the sentiment is essentially this: buyers have some momentum and feel pretty confident, but run into some resistance and get forced down for a small correction (high volume left shoulder). Following this, buyers are slightly discouraged but still feel confident regarding the trend and push for a higher high as sellers kind of just let it happen / are even more discouraged than the buyers (low volume head advance). Then, the weakened buyers run into even stronger overhead resistance, sellers regain confidence, and a high volume retreat off the head occurs. Buyers then make one more feeble attempt to regain the momentum (low volume right shoulder) but fail and capitulate once support breaks (high volume break of neckline).

If any of that isn't there, it's not a valid pattern.
People and their fetish for textbook chart formations lmao. Who cares if it doesn't like how it's supposed to be. They are all clear reversal patterns with a zone of support that's broken and leads to a big sell off. I don't care if it's a H&S or M top or whatever. It's the change in trend that's important. 
I was just about to comment @ you to say you called it lol 
No, i'm not new to the space.  I've been in bitcoin since 2013.  I do suspect that a lot of new people are confused though, and haven't even read the bitcoin whitepaper :|
Peer to peer cash should be basically costless to give to others.  In december, fees were $50.  Lightning is unproven, yet the developers felt fit to cap the transaction capacity, limiting its growth.  How is all this still "Bitcoin a peer to peer electronic cash system"?
Some people trade the chart. Not news. 
In a bear market.
what news?
No such thing as confirmation in this manipulative, stop-loss hunting, tricksy market

I will just cut my loss at 8100 :'( ...
My trading stack at Bitmex is not a very significant amount, as I'm practicing
Bro, that's not a valid reason or logic to go long/short at this particular point in time.. And from all your comments, I just know you're long right now
Viagra can help with that (so I am told...)


lol actually I meant opening up a reddit account. lurked for 5 years
The idea that someones on reddit posting on crypto channels and simultaneously new to the internet made me XD

edit: as in, what if 
What points do you consider relevant? I'm looking at 1/14/2015 and 8/18/2015 as double bottoms around $170. If you're considering ~$220, it's more like a quadruple/sextuple bottom.
One man's bear market is another man's life-changing investment opportunity.
I really don't spend a lot of time thinking or caring about where my profits come from.
lol. I agree with sloppys comment below but that’s hilariously on point 
I mean there is plenty of garbage TA, I agree with that. but giving absolutely 0 reasoning whatsoever...kinda silly.

There are some pretty clear quantifiable factors you can use that area considered "TA" that are silly to ignore. 

volume profiles & horizontal support/resistance are things everyone uses even if they think TA is bunk. even though that *is* ta

If I said we're going to $1000 tomorrow what would you say? would you be able to refute why? I'm going to guess that you're going to use some sort of TA to justify why that will not happen 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/3QdBuMBU/ Here you go
Oh no, it’s absolutely not unreasonable. We could easily see $1k or $100k per Bitcoin by the end of the year. However, since this is a trading subreddit, we have to trade on signals and indicators. It’s hard to trust a random person on the internet for their hunch without evidence to back it up. I’m not saying your hunch is wrong, but I don’t see how it is any more correct than anybody else’s at the moment.
I don't normally proclaim to be correct, I'm wrong more times than right, Though when I am right it is enough to make up for being wrong many times. 
What? When did I do that
Oh. I replied to the wrong comment. Who gives a shit 
Yes, I feel it's accumulation also and that will benefit a push up. There is a massive amount of resistance here and thru the 9000's compared to the sentiment and volume. Buyers seem generally afraid to commit to rally's.
point and figure, a type of charting method. Google that shit and Wyckoff it's good
Gotcha, the closest technical thing I can pull out of my ass is reaccumulation/redistribution. Honestly this feels like redistribution, partly bc im in an underwater short, partly cuz, well, look at the mofo and how heavy it is on declining volume!
I obviously should have paid more attention in English class cause I'm lost
no you can view shorts! Bitfinex has an api you can query to get longs and shorts, it's available as a chart on tradingview.

1k btc closed as shorts and then re opened 15m later 
For a good reason, when you hold crypto you must be bullish to convince another fool to buy your coins at higher prices ( also people with their portfolio underwater must be bullish because they need another fool to break\-even, i'm 100&#37; convinced many bulls are actually deep in the red numbers)

In all seriousness that is pretty cruel. It's people's precious money on the line :(
> Of course, he was just making up crap and no doubt had no idea people would take it seriously. When the day came he posted a trollface and tried to pretend he wasn't horribly embarrassed. And the price did nothing.

Actually, if you had eyes you could review when I made the comments and see for yourself that I made 3 predictions before the 'rick roll' (not trollface), and I got 2/3 times right. 

I wasn't making up crap at all, and people took it seriously for a reason. Get over yourself and stop being salty.

I remember getting pm's for a few weeks about people literally thanking me for the first two calls (before the rick roll). 


okex isn't dumb, it just does its own thing
You're quite a bit less than that now (posted 4900% when it was 7500), and you apparently don't know how call options work; figures. 

Also you're down 62% since I called it a bubble and our interaction began. You could have kept your big speculative bubble gains, but you were too dumb and opted to ride it back down. Sad  =(
While I get what you're saying, I have a few counter points:

1. $740 to $10000 in one year is still absolutely insane and classifies as a bubble/blowoff top. 
2. You can't really just ignore parts of the charts, they happened and that's that, unfortunately. If you wanted to ignore parts, why not cut off the last month and pretend like we're at $10k? :P 
3. The move down *did* happen right before it.. if we dumped to  $3k and bounced to $6k and then consolidated in a triangle from $6-12k wouldn't you think that was insanely bullish? or would you think it was bearish? 
Lol I swear I can follow your trade blindly and come out way ahead :-P
Yes, but it's the same odds if you pick any specific set of dates. E.g., the 3rd on the 1st month, the 20th of the 2nd, the 15th of the 3rd etc. Its no good working out odds after it has already happened.
[deleted]
Well yes, I just don't expect another significant bounce off symmetrical triangle. If we touch it again I believe we're likely breaking down. That being said we may not touch it again...
Defined by bollinger bands. Are common indicators no longer valid?
nice add, that's a good one
right but if it keeps failing to push past...maybe they will stop thinking they can sell 1000 higher. at least not before being able to buy back lower
No argument...just stating facts.
Coming back into the market after leaving isn't automatic. If profit is primarily made from buying and holding for months or years, that isn't going to turn many heads. 

It looks to me like traders are done trying to figure out how far down the market can go. I don't think that converts to longs and accumulation, but I do think it contributes to the lack of volume we're seeing.
I would assume that the probability of each outcome drops as time goes on. A 55 week projection seems to indicate that just about anything is possible, but that 6/7 are pretty positive. 5/7 break the last ATH.
I think the market needs to cool more. Alts haven't really been shaken up yet. I expect to see more suppression of the CC market cap before we can go up. We're not lean and alts are riding on our coat tails.
> Why would they want to kill it? Can you explain (I mean this is a non-hostile way)? Because logically, it would be much more profitable to them to work with it than against it.

I don't know the real reason, but I can come up with some plausible explanations.

First we have to realize that it's not just one big group behind the scenes. We have the bankers, we have the government officials, we have other 3rd party groups - they may have similar interests but I doubt it's exactly the same.

For bankers, I can perfectly imagine why they wanna kill off cryptos. The rise of crypto means they would eventually fade out of existence and become obsolete. They can no longer charge ridiculous fees to people, they can no longer have massive control over money, and it diminishes their power greatly. People will turn away from banking, and that means loss of power and money. 

Institutional investors are smart investors, but they are not interested in paying 20x of what you and I paid for Bitcoin. They want to at least kill it temporarily so they can buy cheap and ride the wave.

For govts., crypto creates lots of headache, in terms of anonymous control, and money laundering facilitation, and aid in criminal activities and other factors. They want to control the money supply and they want it to be as revealing as possible (which goes against the concept of cryptos).

Basically lots of factors here, but I can see why someone would rather kill cryptos than receive short-term profits from it. 


Thank you.
This is the type of regression I was talking about: [https://imgur.com/a/h4yAf82](https://imgur.com/a/h4yAf82)

You can see that since 2013, the BBand width only has a weakly negative slope if you do a linear regression on it. Furthermore, its R value is only 0.16, implying it's not a very strong correlation at all.

I don't think you can reliably conclude that since Bitcoin's inception its volatility has trended down.

Again, if you want to make the argument that we're entering a *period* of low volatility, certainly you can do that and I'd agree with you. Over its lifespan, though, there's nothing to indicate we *won't* ever be as volatile as we were in 2017 or 2013 again aside from that very weak negative slope in the regression.
It doesn't make much sense on the surface but I guess I can see how that makes sense when you think about it. Thanks for clarifying that.
I think it just depends on the time frame you are looking at (day trading vs swing trading). I'd chalk it up as a difference in perspective 
Now you're on the right track. What do you see if you zoom out 8 months? Oh, yes, we were at $4k and change.  Now zoom our further.  See it now?

Also zoom in on any ATH.  They look super huge until you zoom back out.  Do you think $20k will be any different?  (Spoiler: It won't.)
The TF point is pretty much the same sort of point im making though. If your bullish from $1 your laughing. If your bullish from 10K onwards your rekt. If your short above 8K your sat pretty comfortably. Most people(or at least thats what you would assume reading this thread) comment on short term in the market to scalp(in fairness to OP they may be trading lower timeframes). 
This is ridiculous. I just looked up and was like "Yeah, that looks about right. Time for more bullshit." Someone fell in love with a bad play.
The entire network operates on consensus. The consensus is that BTC is "Bitcoin." I thought you said you've been in the space since 2013? Please check out r/bitcoinbeginners
You didn’t answer my question. What kind of trauma you had that made you so retarded?
I'm not discounting his strategy, I'm just offering a contrasting opinion as to why I think we're going up in the short term. 

Username checks out
I've posted many charts int he past, It's not really evidence, we all have the same charts, indicators, ect , you can clearly see where support/resistance is and that bitcoin is in an accumulation phase. Again, never said to trust me, not sure why you would trust anyone but your self. 
Volume has been decreasing as well, I'm planning on some sort of breakout happening by July. The 10 EMA is under the current daily candle as well so I can see some bullish momentum soon up to the 30 EMA (Just on my chart.)
I know the Wyckoff chart but will google pnf. thanks man!
Kinda like Sloppy is saying, that gap was caused by a rapid rise thru low liquidity and when the price returned there later there wasn't much history to cling onto . . support/resistance so the price kinda meanders around without direction due to the lack of strong direction/volume.
I mean if I was being as objective as I possibly could I'd say it's unlikely we pass $9k for a while. So I don't see the point in longing. as much as people here seem to think 8k btc is cheap that was really just the beginning of the blow off top 

Think of how many people were in crypto and buying  at $8k on the way up. Interest is nowhere near that level right now. The people here defending high prices are already bought in. Majority of them are not buying more because they know it's hella expensive 

and yes it looks like distribution to me 
Dang, kind of nuts.  Buy to close out your short in profit, which gets the market to rise, then re-open at a higher price.
Lol I'm amused remembering it rather than salty. You sound very sensitive about the subject haha. Rickroll, trollface, big difference. 

Making good calls is one thing, and saying you're from the future with a very specific date is another. But it's just an amusing anecdote now, relax lol
Well they've been pretty consistently wrong lol 
Seen this *all* before... but you wouldn't know because your new to the space, I've been adding to my stack. Enjoy your "72% gains"

No I'm not 'quite a bit less than that now', I'm at... oh wait 6000%
you opened a levered massive short position back from December right? or do you just talk the shit and not follow your own advice?
All excellent counters. And yes I would love if we could all agree to pretend the price is $10K :)

This is what’s fun about this market: speculating. If you enjoy speculating wow is crypto for you. It sure is for me - just hit me how much so. 
I've been out since the parabolic trend broke after the rally to 20k got stopped short and we fell to 20k. At that time it obviously wasn't a bear flag, but the way we are consistently seeing smaller and smaller bounces off of 6-7k support seems to confirm what I already believed.
I think a lot of people know that, that's why this is being bought up pretty quickly.
Your interpretation of bollinger bands. your interpretation of RSI. I've seen your charts and I like them very much. You determined what is and isn't consolidated enough and low enough RSI to be one of your "periods". 

I'm just pointing out that it is annoying for you to randomly hop on my comment and assume I'm using the same criteria, or that anyone else is. 
yes you just described supply and demand and market pressure :P  And this sort of ascending triangle we are in with a quite firm ceiling but lower bought up quickly, if with more volume will have overweight to the buy side
it'll just go back to what it was last year. There was still lots of volatility even while it mooned
Many alts are down 80-90%....I mean that's pretty fair. Alts took a beating.
>For bankers [...]

Sure, but we already know they have one public face and then the crypto face, covertly. The JPM case proved that. The head honcho yapped against crypto while his traders were loading millions in it. 

>Institutional investors are smart investors [...]

That's working with crypto too. Actually, long term. Buy cheap now, sell expensively later.

>For govts., crypto creates lots of headache [...]

Now this is discussable. You're right, they want transparency. But at the same time we know that covert branches of the govt love dark stuff, i.e. CIA and their fingers deep in the drug trade well since 1970s. So I can be sure crypto is used to finance covert assets as well. That's working with crypto too. Or more openly, what CFTC does, that's pro crypto. They're trying to find a way to actually accept it and its use, aren't they? Despite other branches of the govt completed confused by it. Remember the famous hearing on crypto? The main guy said his niece holds Bitcoin.

I think the basic argument is that there is a public PR, and there is actual stuff happening. And the actual stuff happening is with crypto, not against it.
You're also measuring two periods of high volitility separated by a period of low volitility. If we do move through an extended volitility you should see that drop dramatically.
All the more reason we could as well be at 4k in a month. You are just a tard permabull. It makes a huge difference if you have 5 btc in a year when we might be at 50k or if you have 10btc at 50k. I don't care if you never sell and want to hold a bag and something that might not even recover, but at least don't act stupid. 
I would be pretty content if we paint a higher low around $7450.

Honestly, this is just stupid at this point. It’s pretty predictable, it’s almost sad 
https://twitter.com/lopp/status/990194684361228288
Why would I bother answering a pointless ad hominem attack?  You failed to address any relevant issue.
It is expensive if it doesn't look like your gonna have 150+% returns, yes . . and you can tell buyers hang back waiting for the price to come to them and with good reason. 
Ofcourse i'm sensitive. I traveled through time and space to help the people on ethtrader and you're trying to pass me off as some troll.

Do you even know how many times I puked after going back in time? 

It's not easy. So stop minimizing the pain of time travel I had to go through.
[removed]
you don't short bubbles (let alone with added leverage), as the stupidity of the masses can continue to grow them a final surge larger until you're hit by a margin call or insolvent. and there were/are no Put options (bet against with no risk of margin call and can only lose what you bet) available on bitcoin. 
Haha it's very frustrating but also very interesting and rewarding all at the same time. 
and it's going precisely nowhere, just like the opposite of $6.5k 
Bollinger bands determine when volatility is low, not me. Just pick an arbitrary value and look at it. weekly and daily BBands don't often retract this much. That's objectively true

You can mix in RSI if you want. You can look at other indicators. The bottom line is that periods of stability are almost always followed by breakouts to the upside in bitcoin. The price has never broken down when RSI is low and volatility is low.
well you're the one who said supply will run out :P I just countered with "supply doesnt ever really "run out" unless demand falters"

people just say the "how much more bitcoin can they *sell*?!" as a defense against strong sell pressure and it seems like a fundamental misunderstanding of supply and demand

also, what triangle??
I wonder how long that will be and how much volatility will return. We don't see volatility like what we saw 2011 - 2013 anymore... and I doubt we ever will. What's peak volatility 2015 - 2017 and will we see that again?

Hold on while I look at this...
Alts as a whole are way up year over year. That market needs to sort out winners and losers.
Probably, I still think it's a very weak correlation. An R of 0.16 is basically noise and another period of low volatility wouldn't make it much better.
Well, I'm just going by my experience which is that I have bought these "bear markets" (worse, actually) before and made lots and lots of money.  Maybe someday when you're fully able to grasp your zoomed out "little dips don't matter" epiphany above, you won't think I'm stupid.  I don't think you're stupid. I just think you don't understand this market as well as those of us who have been in it for a while.  My buy order is set at 7100.  Where's yours? Don't have one? Then what are you doing here?

I'm not reporting you for abuse, but I am downvoting you.
More meditation on stability this week.

Getting sick of this. At least 6 more weeks of it. This place is going to be a wasteland. The most interesting thing to me is watching the cycle repeat with more people bitching about it.
Oh... maybe we'll miss my 7,4 target. So, anyone who's bored by the repetition can make even less money on the obvious short play.
You failed as a human being. There is only BITCOIN. The rest of the weird names one of you guys post here every fucking day is part of Btrash scam and Roger Ver idiotic way of shilling. It’s retarded, you are retarded and Btrash is retarded  
Ya exactly. With the range getting smaller people are wondering how much higher it can really go. We tanked 30% in like a week or two and all we've managed is a measly 10% bounce over 15 days. there isn't even a lot of sell pressure, we're just straight up running out of demand 

>Do you even know how many times I puked after going back in time? 

Yeah, that's why we always say not to eat for an hour before time travelling. 
[removed]
> Bollinger bands determine when volatility is low

On a relative basis. Their is not set threshold for "this is low volatility" and "this is high volatility." 

>Just pick an arbitrary value and look at it.

This is what you did to arrive at your "13 days" and "it has happened less than that". I could pick an arbitrary value that would certainly yield more than 10 periods and make this period greater than 13 days.

>The bottom line is that periods of stability are almost always followed by breakouts to the upside in bitcoin.

Yeah, see my OP. That is the exact point I said.

>The price has never broken down when RSI is low and volatility is low.

When the RSI is as low as your subjective threshold you chose, correct. 

I'm not criticizing your analysis. It's as interesting and informative as any TA I've seen. It's also probably just as predictive. I'm simply finding it annoying you think I have your same criteria for defining periods of stability. I find it comical that you assumed from your very first comment that I was using your criteria by default.
The one with the top at 7600 and every 50$ from 5 days or something getting bought up faster
The past 6 months have been pretty volatile actually, nah? I mean if you count big movements the market has gone from 20 to 13 to 16 to 10 to 17 to 9 to 13 to 6 to 12 to 9 to 12 to 6.5 to 10 to 7 lol

that's $66k of movement lol

should measure in % but I mean it's been extremely volatile, even if you just count the big triangle. the lower time frame movements have just been less volatile 
I don't think its quite time for that yet. We're still in a very speculative phase and none of the alts really have products out. We're not there yet imo. The big bubble hasn't burst yet. It will burst when Blockchain technologies are actually being used by the public just like the dot com bubble when the Internet was actually in use by the public and the shit companies could be sorted from the good ones. That will be when many alts will die imo. But this is like comparing apples to oranges. This is a entirely new asset class. 
If you break it up into periods that will change substantially.
How did your plan work out?
Ideally a long from this circle would be a pretty decent play 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/5cHXEOWA/

Maybe we will just paint a higher low at $7500 and Bart back up past $7700. 

I’m pretty bored with BTC at this point. 
Brilliant arguments.  not.

Here's why I'm not a fan of the BTC roadmap:

https://www.yours.org/content/clarifying-my-objections-to-the-lightning-network-2f9d3aa154e5
Yes, the narrowing range is a concern for me. The trips back down as well as back up since Feb are going more sideways and it's obvious the interest level is down.

Edit: wow is all this going to be down voted but like you I also try to be objective with all this.
[removed]
Volatility seems to trend down over time:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/JvIQP5N4/

The purple line is BBand % width projected large over the price.
Here's another way to look at it that makes it more clear:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/c4qLUozy/
A linear regression with a period answers "how is the linear regression going x data points back changing over time" but that's not the question we're asking. We're asking "has the volatility been trending down across bitcoin's lifespan" and the answer to that is "no, not significantly or conclusively."

With a linear regression over a period you're only looking at the trend over x days, not the trend overall. It's useful for identifying which way the volatility is currently trending but not for identifying how the volatility has trended since crypto's inception.
gotta a feeling that line won't hold, just a feeling though.

edit: because it's way too obvious.

Seems pretty well received so far. Some good news could push us over the edge but tbh the year of 2017 might have been "buy the rumor" and 2018 is "sell the news" in terms of regulations

If we don't react to good news then a few bearish months are probably inevitable 
I gotta feel like if you did a linear regression on that it'd have an awful R^2 value, way too much noise in the signal if you're really trying to claim volatility has gone down overall as time has gone on based on weekly bband width.

I do believe from just looking at the daily charts back then that the "wickiness" has gone down as liquidity has gone up, so volatility in that sense may have gone down. Weekly chart doesn't capture that as well though.
In a market that has obvious periods you have to use periodization. You wouldn't analyze temperature over a year this way. You wouldn't look at it over 10 years this way either. The methodology is inappropriate for the data.
great.  Let people research and educate themselves from all sources.  I'm 100% for that.
Excellent observations.

Here's another way to look at it using the daily:

We'll have to agree to disagree. A market isn't a climate that has absolutely known periods; a market is periodic but not of a known period. 

And even if it were known, I'd say if the question you're asking is "how is volatility over the last 90 days trending" a periodic regression is absolutely appropriate. But if the question is "how has the volatility of Bitcoin been trending since it was first trading" looking at a single regression analysis is the correct one.
Interesting. See, even that chart makes me think your argument that over BTC's lifetime volatility has trended down doesn't really hold. If your argument is we're entering a possibly prolonged period of low volatility I think you have a much better case, but I really see nothing to indicate there that BTC's volatility year over year is down.

Edit: let's just keep this to the top level post, gonna copy this there.

Alternatively, how does Bitcoin volitility change when you separate periods using historically low volitility? Time is not the only way to separate samples.
That's really interesting. We're making very different conclusions from our observations of these charts. I want to get to the bottom of this.

Here's something that stands out to me:
