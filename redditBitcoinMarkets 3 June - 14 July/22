'We'll never see $5k Bitcoin again' - Me, October 2017. 
Shorts going parabola up 5K in past 12 hours and touching 30K now. 1H RSI at ATH.. 90+..
I was bored today and did some calculations. 

Assuming that this is playing like 2014, and that we are following the ATH downtrend now to goblin town, and that the April 10 Green dildo was equivalent to the large pump on May 18, 2014.....then we can conclude the following

- From the ATH of 2013 to May 18, 2014 was 167 days

- From the ATH of 2017 to April 10, 2018 BGD, was 116 days

- From May 18 2014, to the bottom of the bear market, took another 241 days

Using the same ratio, then we can conclude that from the April 10 BGD to the bottom of this market will take 6 months from that date. 

Therefore there are approximately 93 days left (3 months) in this bear market and the bear market will reach its bottom in late September....and the bottom would be 3500 USD. Now I really doubt we're going to see 3500 USD, my personal guess at the lowest we can go is 4.8k. A big technical difference between 2014 and 2017 is that on the way up in 2017, there were many corrections and support levels and resistances were built. Where as in 2014, it literally multiplied like 12 times in under a month with absolutely no breathing in between. We have several levels of support before 3.5k, and I really doubt we will breach all of them.When comparing to a more organic and realistic bubble like the dot com boom, the bottom is around 4.8-5k which is the 78.6 Fibonacci retracement. I can definitely see a scenario of a slow bleed to those levels by September or earlier.

If however, April 10, 2018 and May 18, 2014 BGDs are not the same, then we can assume another BGD will happen and then the slow bleed will commence which would mean this bear market would continue on into 2019.


There is also a possibility this is more like 2013, and is only the first sell off before the real bull run, in which case we should be reversing soon...I really doubt this though as much as i want it to be true.

At the end of the day, 2018 is 2018 and this will play out the way it wants to play out. Its still fun to make these comparisons though.





Closed half my short position from $6730 for a little more than a 9% gain at $6097.

Although I’m still extremely short term bearish, better to lock in profits as this is my first trade in some time. 

We could see a move up to as high as $6400 before resuming downtrend where I’ll most likely be adding to my remaining short. 

I’ll be at work all day and have little time to keep tabs on crypto. 
Mine & most fellow devs I'm acquainted with are at ATH ETH & BTC denominated salary. 

Can't say I'd mind if this context persists.

Such devs are consistently increasing their skin in the game as short term players exit.
Was this an upward fakeout to clear some shorts before another leg down?
I was bored so I took yesterday's daily and made a word cloud.

Kinda interesting imo
I'm all over the place--added 25% back to my short this morning, but now closing it fully here with plans to reshort a bounce or short a breakdown. Simply put, the potential flag breakdown that I added based on didn't manifest, so I need to trade based on the new picture of the market I have even though the price didn't really change. As someone pointed out, potential ascending triangle on the 1hr. I don't expect a BGD but shorts could get blue balls and close, adding a little bit of buying pressure to let this drift up. Not confident enough in a bounce to long here. I made great profits on the trade adding to my trade stack about 25% and I have such PTSD from shorting the bottom this spring.

I have every right to change my mind in 2 hours.
deep breaths guys and gals
The entire dump from $20,000 to $6,000 was an immaculate, intricately-setup bear trap
Enjoy your Saturday all, I'll be changing my focus to drinking beer at the beach today. Don't get too wild without me!

Edit: gonna talk to some fish about dropping some of their sand dollars on some btc.

Dont worry all, Fishtitution money is coming

I hear the term "goblin town" quite a bit here. Just wondering what price range do you consider "goblin town"? 3k,4k,5k? Are we already there?
I'm a bit new to this, but it it seems a few days ago folks were calling for sub $6k fairly easily. Is this part of the plan? Should I short it now?
Long here, just a scalp basically. Target is 6400 as I imagine that will be heavy resistance now. If it breaks I'll add and watch out for 6800.

I think we might get some relief and we have bullish div that got confirmed on the daily. Risky trade since it's going against the trend, but tight SL around 6000s. 

Bullish div https://www.tradingview.com/x/RsnXyIGu/
with TSI and OBV and with RSI https://www.tradingview.com/x/hgNkxjc0/

If 6400 fails to break I'll exit and switch short. Or if we are still sideways tomorrow I'll reasses.

!long XBTUSD 6150 5X 100%
It is all about log. Bitcoin going from here to $1200± or $30000± are the same amount of change (in different directions) in a logarithmic scale. 

Nobody knows which direction (bullish or bearish) is going to be, but one can prepare for both.

Btw: this is my first post here and hello.
Point and Figure Chart https://i.imgur.com/8SZZPNz.png  Yesterday we confirmed a column of 14 O's.  Just now we confirmed a column of 6 X's, retracing yesterday's long pole.  A pullback to $4,499 would complete unresolved long pole dating back over 8 months ago and is our next likely long-term target. Short term, we have a recent unresolved long pole of 16 O's from 6/10, a move above 7,040 would resolve 50% of the pole.

Bullish divergence on the daily RSI just confirmed:  https://www.tradingview.com/x/qGRwPogU/  

Here is a cheat sheet on divergence: https://i.imgur.com/wVw4L6h.png

Here is a historical look at daily divergence since we reached ATH 6 months ago: https://www.tradingview.com/x/Fn0XJCzI/  As you can see, they all played out at least for the short term giving bulls some relief.

Here is a look at Major trendlines since bull market ended. https://www.tradingview.com/x/6WHAOj2I/  Right now we are in the green channel down.  Relief if we break out up or max pain if we break down.  Part of me wishes we could break down because we would probably get a good strong bounce off the 4k range.  But following today's bull div we will probably edge up out of the channel and resolve our most recent long pole by reaching 7,040.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/7eLVbo3k/

if we don't make a strong push past $6300 here soon I'm thinking we're in for another leg down

I'm really personally looking for a V bottom before considering longing this thangy

personally think a short from here with a SL at ~$6350 isn't bad r/r for anyone looking to be a degen bottom shorter/seller

edit: the main difference between these two is the market lingered at the bottom of the 4h wick for 8h before coming up the first time- here we just touched ~$5900 and didn't spend very long there. so this could totally be different- i just think if we don't pass $6300 we're in for another one
Closed out half my short at around 6130 yesterday but just added back so I'm at 75% of my original size. Still could pop up here but the flagging since yesterday on the 1hr makes me want to be in position

I just stumbled across this sub and have a few questions: 

1. Is margin trading crypto still allowed for US citizens? I know Bitfinex has closed off from the US, what are some reputable exchanges that I could use? 

2. Do you guys use some form of TA/indicators to make decisions? Does this actually work for you? I've seen nothing but mocking of TA on other crypto forums who shall remain nameless. But without some kind of analysis, long/shorting would appear to be the same as gambling.

3. Is the main difference/appeal of margin trading vs daytrading that you can 2x,5x,10x, etc your positions, vs. only using what you personally own? 

4. Do you have to put up some kind of collateral to the exchange to margin trade? Do you have to have the funds already that would be needed to pay the exchange if you lose on your position? 

Shorts at 30k+ now. Expecting a push up to stop out the bottom shorters. 
Soooooo


Some of yall may remember wayyyyy back when 1758.20.....  my order hit it on the head and we essentially sprung board from that point forward..... I was pretty vocally obnoxious braggin bout it for sometime... I think we had a hashtag never forget meme going around for a bit...kk so that was that...


IDK, its certainly very very very very early and in no way can anyone truly call it.... BUTTTTT  I just noticed, a chunk of my recent orders hit the most recent local low right on the head too!!!
https://imgur.com/a/2V8nou7


soooooooo   considering this has only happened to me twice in my life, and the first occurrence yielded amazing results.... I wouldn't mind if this was one of history repeating itself things...


I only post this because on the off chance this is the floor and we move back up into more comfortable ranges/continue on to the epic mega bubble to 100k/btc..... I WANT IT TO BE KNOWN, that I am the greatest bottom picker of all time..... and yes, I know my username and yeah.... its funny!     If this doesn't breakdown further, I want some special flair or something!!!

Thats all, carry on everyone! 
Closed remaining of my short from $6730 at $6119. 

Not due to me being bullish. 

Simply because I’m getting pretty drunk off Tequila tonight and Tequila + Bitcoin= Terrible decisions.

Although a few weeks back I opened a short that I had 0 recollection of at the bar that wound up being a great entry.

Stay woke broski’s. Catch ya in manana

Praying that btc won't bounce yet so that we get more shorts here for a real pump. If we bounce right now, most of those sub 6.2k shorts will close but there isn't enough of them to squeeze yet. So the pump won't be big enough. One more dip below sub 6k is the place to long. We also didn't hit many long stops under 6k for some suprising reason. They are still chilling there to provide large long positions with liquidity.
What can be made out from the 3 big spikes today on Bitfenix on the 15 min charts? All 3 got shot down at 6163.x
Oh shet, 1k btc dump on binance. it went to 5977.

It's already bounced back. Is it a sign before the mega pump? xD
No buy before 3D RSI is oversold. 
[deleted]
I'd find this hilarious if bitcoin went up to 12k and became the double bottom everyone was insisting we needed.
[deleted]
Don't even bother looking at the chart; just buy before it's too late.
Just a beartrap for Money Monday market buys
What do you guys think the price of bitcoin is going to be at the end of the year, now that you've crossed the halfway mark for the year?
All the big alts seems to be at critical levels, especially LTC (hanging on to $80).  Is this foreshadowing anything for BTC? It was kinda doing this prior to Friday's dump below 6k as well.
7000 BTC worth of buys between here and $5,500...yet the price is still below $6,100 

Could go either way, but that kind of support usually means its going down 
Still could drop another $2000 https://i.imgur.com/loE7Qzc.png

And price may go sideways around $5000 before breaking up within 90 days...or not and BTC goes lower.

Follow that uptrend line and May 2020 is when BTC will break $20,000 which just happens to be the next halving. 
Man... this subreddit has really gone to the dogs. It reminds me of r/politics with "sides" and "rhetoric" always at play. The moment you realize you can make money in any direction, you will live a much happier and more opportunistic life. The fact that so many care about price in only one direction and not VOLATILITY means the majority are not fit for long-term sustainability. 

You think Wall St care about stock prices going in only one direction? Let the opportunity flow through you. Unlock your mind.

People should care less about the color of the candle, and more about the size of the candle (volatility).
How many times does BTC have to say "no" to sub 6k before people are convinced? 
Is it bullish that we're hovering so close to support? Look what happened when we hovered so close to resistance. 
Woke up to my 10x long limit order being filled @ around $6,000, looking for an ultra-speculative position I can hang onto for a fairly long time. Reasonable chance this might be it.

Did the same in the $7,000's and as frustrating as it was to be in the profit zone for days and then get loved tenderly, I didn't take profit because I'm not interested in catching a good scalping opportunity at this point. Willing to get rekt a couple of times if his means snagging a good mid-term position.

We'll see.

Don't try this at home and if you do, understand that it's an ultra-speculative play.

Moving on, I'm kind of seeing this as a potential DOUBLE bottom on the daily chart.

Double, not triple because we had the Feb 05 low of 6k on Finex, right?

Great.

Then we had the March low of 6432 and people wanted to paint that as an Adam & Eve double bottom.

But a 7&#37; difference between the Feb and March lows... meh.

I mean I'm not looking for a perfect double bottom but 7&#37; is too big of a difference.

3&#37; give or take? Sure.

7&#37;? Too much IMO.

Therefore, I'm much more inclined to see what we have right now as a POTENTIAL (unconfirmed!) double bottom.

The difference between the Feb lows and the current lows looks the part, the falling volume is there.

Again, the r/r of this play seems decent.

If I'm wrong, I hope y'all are grateful for my sacrifice :)
So, my short was this close to liquidating but im still holding my 70X short. I am surprised that we didnt go down further than we have after breaking down from 6.4K. It like the bulls just wont give up or someone with a shitton of fiat is accumulating shittons of bitcorn.  Anyhow Iam just going to sit on my hands for now watching how the battle for 6K is going to play out. 
Descending triangle on the daily candles, mass uncertainty, low volume.  

I'm short.
[deleted]
Maybe 6k really has no significance as a price point? We seem to be hovering +/- 2% around it since last night.  It seems like the price is just conforming to the technicals in any timeframe above 2hr. Thoughts?
What is the tick column in positionbot page for?
6000 is the new 150.  Man, those were the days.
I wake up and we're still above $6000? Bears are getting humiliated. Must be so embarrassing, I honestly feel bad for them. 
Either futures are in a 6h bear flag or a technical RSI bounce is incoming. Below 6k makes me buy here at 5980 a small position. The "mispricing" of futures vs swaps ratio is quite fun to look at to gain a few extra % when things start to move. But the risk is also higher since the orderbooks are thinner and wicks appear

Ascending triangle on 1h, break out 6180, down 6100, Target 180 (stamp)
Ahhh this headline just popped up in my suggested reads on chrome "Bitcoin Price Analysis: Is It Over?" 

First of its kind I've seen so far. Glad to know despair is starting to set it everywhere. Hopefully capitulation is almost over and we dont go to 4k or lower before we reverse. Though I guess in the end it doesnt matter.
Lets be frank; at this point the only thing that would get us significantly above 6k without a shift in the underlying fundamentals would be a MM generating a big green short squeezing candle. You don't see any sense of urgency or follow through to buy BTC up at these prices. 
I’m assuming lots of people are setting stop losses as they go to bed in US. So I’m guessing we’ll see some stop loss hunting tonight 
Does anybody know if the 5250€ buy order on kraken got filled or removed? Yes, the one for 1.4k BTC
4H RSI can't even get out from oversold and people think that 'we can't stay under 6k'...

hodling strong from buy at 18k
I'm feeling optimistic that this only touched 5988 or whatever it was during the spike down.  Its kind of 50/50 which way the market heads in my opinion 
didn’t even bart, just slowly dropped again lol 
No need to panic yet, but if this loses $6000 again, it could get very ugly, very fast...just about 1% away.


As bitcoins reached a now ATL for 2018, Iran IRR reached a new ATL against USD. That's 50% profit by hedging in bitcoin, still in profit despite the downtrend. And more depreciation is on the way, sanctions are not back yet. Silver linings. If only Bitcoin was useful to other people just as well instead of being viewed mostly as a speculative poker chip...

The failed pump is turning into an ugly hammer 
 Potential bullish divergence in OBV on the daily in light green in the chart below - but it will only really confirm once the Saturday candle closes green, which is far from certain right now judging by the charts on shorter time frames (the last few hours could well be a bear flag after a totally expected bounce off the previous $5.9k low support).

Even if the bullish divergence plays out, it wouldn't necessarily indicate a reversal as we have had several bullish divergences on the daily in this current downtrend before. So we may at least retest the red log downtrend line from ATH (or follow it further down).

[https://imgur.com/a/7BBjfKt](https://imgur.com/a/7BBjfKt)

So yes, the price may go up or down :-)
Yet ANOTHER bear flag developing on the hourly. I'm expecting another push down below 6000 very soon and I don't think it's gonna be a fakeout this time.
Down 25k woo. 
Is that a bull flag on the monthly log chart?

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DgVjOOjU0AAD9xx.jpg
Eh no big deal. Bears are doing us a favor by giving us cheap coins. They are about to get fucked in their ass 
Anecdotally, in this space it seems that the progression of a large faction of the masses has gone from holder during the bullrun, to shitcoin purveyor during the alt craze, to learning about margin trading to attempt to make money while expecting bitcoin to go lower and then eventually bounce up. I wonder if true capitulation will come when the noob margin traders get shaken out. Until then, 10% drop, 5% retrace, rinse and repeat. Ultimately this is torture for people who would rather investing be as easy as hodling. (I say this as someone who has been trading less than a year and is currently in a short, but I am trying to fight bear hopium)
Behind all these barts are really weak people who can't hold shorts, nor sell without fomoing in again. 
Explanation for low volume? If I'm waiting to invest, this chart tells me to wait another few months at least.

My opinion on Wyckoff meme:

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/4JvwCVen-Wyckoff-just-a-meme-Don-t-discount-the-possibility/

I think the possibility of Wyckoff accumulation should not be discounted
going short here, solely based on my intuition. might not be the smartest idea, but i've been with bitcoin for past two years and it just feels like the right move
Just a quick thought exercise:

If this drops from here, bulls just remember that you too had a chance to short from $6,000 and you chose not to.

If this rises from here, bears just remember that you too had a chance to long from $6,000 and you chose not to.

A month from now, who will be looking back and saying, damn I should have flipped my position at $6,000?

Or maybe we'll just go sideways for a month.

BwaHahahHAAAA! You call that a dump? Because I call it free money.

Wick added to my 6250 long at 5950. 3x 2% 

Side note: Tether is solvent. Rise in 2017 was legit. Exchanges need to be investigated.  Big dumps but no coins moving from big wallets -> exchanges lending more than they have.  Won't end well for the borrowers or the exchanges. Send coins to cold storage ASAP after buying.

Edit: Note to self before I delete this pre-blockchain Internet (and therefore historically useless and irrelevant) account: They're actually selling Bitcoin that doesn't exist. That is how it happened!  Holy shit! Eureka.

Poll time! What’s your initial shorting target? 

http://www.strawpoll.me/15950561/r
It seems too early for the next big leg down to goblin town.  This will probably stop dropping before $6K for a little while, at least.
tether and bitfinexes bank, noble has started scrubbing their website. just a heads up.

I wonder if the lack of buying power is affected by the fact a lot of credit card companies stopped allowing purchasing of crypto. 

In December, Gdax was at a high premium, from people fomoing in and using cc as leverage. I imagine a lot of those people got burned. Haven't seen Gdax trading at a premium since, but I haven't looked into it fully
These shorters are getting greedy a run up to 12k to double bottom would be so nice 🤷🏽‍♂️😂 knock them down to earth for a bit 
Seriously who is this idiot rageshorting the bottom every time? He must hate money..and i hate him - just let it die!
Massive rally coming.  Shorts have had it way too easy here.  It's time for them to feel the pain.  I'm telling everyone I know to buy.  I'm adding to positions and will keep adding as much as I can.  


Am I total idiot, or is there a gigantic head and shoulders on the 4hr chart dating back to the November run-up?  . . . . or both?
A manipulated pump to squeeze the shorts.  It's not like we didn't see this coming.

This next bounce off 6000 is going to be the best yet!
Weekends always down last weeks... so I expect the same.

'We'll never see $20k Bitcoin again.' - Me, June 2018. 
You are still correct
If you compare the longs and short chart its interesting to see that orders on the long side are placed by big players, whilst shorts are increasing gradually in small bites. 
How are the longs? Whats the ratio between the 2?
Crap, really?

Thinking about something similar. Looking at last night, 6000 seems to be a pretty serious support after all. So it's probable we will bounce off that line a couple of times. Setting buys at 5900-5980 range to first close the short and then maybe even scalp some longs.

Let's take a guess, 3-4 bounces in about three days, and then fall through? 
I bought a hedge against my June short on perps instead to pick up funding fees. Once it gets above about 6300 I'll sell the perps and leave the short in place
Sigh, I just want to buy some bitcoin, drink some beers with friends, bang a beauty, pass out and wake up at 11 am to being in nice profit. Is that so much to ask?
Look at the chart.  This happens often...manipulated bear trap before a spike up and bull trap before a big drop.  It sure isn't a coincidence

Very cool. I think it says a lot about what’s happening and the general sentiment. Nice job. 
That's really nice!

Surprised "Goblin" isn't prominent though :)

Edit: Is reading the cloud top-to-bottom trading advice? Bitcoin down. Think Long. Up? Close.
>"Bitcoin down, think Long, Up"

Basically this sub in a nutshell.
I think a lot of people have PTSD from the BGD of April '18! Me included. I'm not convinced the strength / demand is there for any significant bounce.
Deep pockets are better than deep breaths at this stage

Bullish.
Well, when you look at the gargantuan bull pennant it forms, you would certainly think so.

But Satoshi was a genius.  Bear trap is built in to the protocol.

But sell before atlantis new year tho..
Is this money you somehow came across and randomly found? or are you making a consistent income?

Making high risk high reward investments when you're 20 is a really great way to strike gold and make some great returns. 

Be prepared to lose most/all of it - if you don't mind losing that money then there's absolutely nothing wrong with it. You're very young and have a lot of time to make more money, especially if you've already saved up $24k at the age of 20
If you have consistent income to cover costs as well as a little to put aside for investments, this is a great idea.

I think you are gonna be a pretty wealthy mid 20s YO in a few years, sir.
Sounds good to me
Hi, it would have been better to buy 1/4 of the total you plan to buy here.

I suggest to sell 1/2 of what you bought around 7-8k depending where it goes here and rebuy lower.
Good buy only if, and really I have to emphasize this, only if you really mean it when you say "long term". Because it is very possible that price can drop to 3-4k over the next months. You will start thinking, hmm, I could have bough 4 BTC instead of 2 if only I waited longer...and you might start thinking that if you sell now and realize your loss you will be able to buy 5 or 6 at 1-2k. This is where you fuck up and sell the bottom. So if you are prepared to hold through a 50% dip from here and not panic, then you are good.
I like the plan, doing something similar, although with less money.

Genuinely curious tho, how did You save so much money at 20 yrs old if i may ask? Im always working student jobs when there is no uni, but cant imagine this. Truth be told the salaries in my country are pretty low-tier, so maybe thats the reason.
>It's a bit more than half of all my money.

That's a little alarming...
I like it.
If it's money you can afford to sit on for a while and possibly lose (no one wants to lose but there's a good chance we will bubble again) then I would just say keep it in cold storage and DCA on the way down with any additional money your willing to put in. If you can't sit on what you have for a while then get out what you need and consider DCAing over the next few months.

Im betting on lower but be careful asking this sub for guidance and always do your homework if you use it to draw ant conclusions, It also depends on how much time you want to be spending watching the market. We may dip below 6 hit 5 and be back above before you notice. Just have a plan, if you exit here have a plan for where you would buy back if the price moves in your favor and against you.
Diversify into some smart contract platforms like ETH. 
Holding wisely until the next bull run is the best thing to do. Don't gamble this or you may end up losing everything. That was my rule when I started BTC in late 2013 (when it hit 1000$ for the first time) and 4 years later I now have pocket money to gamble.

HOLD
Yeah, don't invest 50% of your savings in crypto. 5% is a lot. Bitcoin and crypto is not "medium" risk, it is extremely high risk.
Is this money you earned, or money that was given to you?  I'd say it's way too risky for putting half of your cash in.  Maybe do 10% and put the rest in index funds?
I think 50% is a lot for initial crypto investment, but at your age it may be acceptable. Also I'd rather call it high risk. Large-cap stocks are medium risk. Crypto in comparison is pretty high on the risk spectrum of financial instruments.   
   
Perhaps it may also be smarter (or at least less risky, given the current trend) to dollar cost average your investment over some period, e.g. 10% each month for the next 5 months.
Smart kid. Got 2 BTC at 20 years old, thinking strategically long term, in this sub asking the right questions to the right people... You'll be fine. Much better than most. My only advice is to hold it hard for five years. It'll either be worth 0 or $100,000 plus. If you want to trade, keep that on the side and buy some more to play with. 
Bitcoin is a high risk investment. But you're 20 (and it's not a huge absolute sum) so who cares? Just make sure you don't need that money to live off of. And make sure to keep saving money from whatever your income source is.

For the future though, you should probably not dump all your investment money in at one price level when it's a bear market, better to buy at multiple prices (ie buy some at 6k, 7k, 5k, etc)

>  It's a bit more than half of all my money. Any thoughts?

My main thought is SET A TIGHT STOP.  Again.....SET...A...TIGHT...STOP...LOSS...ORDER.

Unless you are content with rolling the dice and accepting you may lose 1/4 of your net worth very soon.   If that's ok, then go for it.  I can't say that type of decision is right or wrong. I have done the same thing before myself in the past and it was not smart the way I did it, but that was me.  Only you can decide.
>I hear the term "goblin town" quite a bit here. Just wondering what price range do you consider "goblin town"? 3k,4k,5k? Are we already there?

The term relates to lack of activity, as in abandoned/quiet. Doesn't mean much with regard to price. Volatility brings activity, either way. 
I think < 4500 qualify 
A word of advice:

If you’re new to this don’t come to sub and open up positions based off what a bunch of internet people are doing.

Learn some TA. Stalk the sub and get a feel for who’s well versed on trading and who’s not. Check out BitMex TestNet 

I dont recommend opening a short now. I recommend shorting between $6300-$6400 or shorting the $5900 breakdown. This is currently a “ No trade zone “

Stay safe out there. This is the Wild West on steroids 
Yes, it's all part of the master plan. Didn't you get a copy?
Wrote this in another comment below, I like to incorporate sentiment into my trading strategies and so far it's worked pretty well. 

Here's what I'm thinking about where the bottom is:

I like to look at the sentiment and so far, it seems most people here are generally "okay" with these prices. They don't think it's going much lower nor are they particularly uncomfortable hanging around here.

most rallies/reversals are started when people sell the bottom and then buy back higher.

This is because we need people to panic buy. **You don't get that with people thinking "this is fine"**

People need to freak out, sell, then buy back higher. Because if they freak out and sell and it goes sideways what do they do? They wait. and then it goes lower. As long as we keep dumping with sideways in between every dump I don't think it's the bottom. 

Of course the market isn't a 100% sure thing and I'm not necessarily going to be right. But in general most reversals with bitcoin happen like this. In fact, I don't think there's ever been a reversal that didn't start off of a V-bottom, but markets don't always repeat themselves- not to mention there could be a lot of potential upwards movement in between here and a V-bottom. 

---

But if you're new to this, no I would not exactly suggest shorting now. The market is likely going to bounce hard here in the next 1-4 weeks and I don't think newer traders will know how to deal with it. It's not that I don't think it's going to go down from here (because I obviously do) but I think that when the V bounce occurs, noobs will not see it as a genuine reversal and will hold until breakeven.  All of that paper profit gone. If they just wait for the V bottom to long/buy then they'll have a much better chance at closing in profit. 
> a bit new to this

> Should I short it now?

no
Yes the chart suggests a downtrend and $6K was only 10% away after a recent bounce from near those levels, so was not a big surprise it fell below that level.

We don't know the exact plans of the market manipulators, but the downtrend on the chart is fairly clear. 

You should short whenever you find the risk/reward to be appropriate to open a position.  I am currently short, although could be a better entry if this bounces higher.   Again, look at the chart and also realize that there is almost certainly more bitcoin bad news right around the corner that will pound the price lower.
Short when 12h rsi is around 70, mfi very high and people dream of lambos, not that low we're going up here imo.
Yes... keep shorting 

And we will see
yes
Yeah I agree with that a lot.

I still wouldn't be surprised by a move up to the meme triangle/log support line we broke down from to confirm it as support turned resistance. 
Hey Dude nice to have you !! 
What is logarithmic scale ?

Edit: thanks for the answer guys appreciate it. Sorry. It just very confusing what it does to bitcoin. 
Ok, let's think about the effort it would take, is it equal in both directions in the current situation? 
Log is literally mental gymnastics
Nice, I just went with a scalp long and posted my own analysis about the bull div. Thanks for posting the historical chart and how they played out. 

What is your bottom indicator on [this chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/qGRwPogU/), if you dont mind me asking? Is that an RSI+StochRSI combo you made?

What we need here is more shorts.
Hmm, I'm really torn. I was expecting a more substantial breakout of the ascending ~~wedge~~ triangle we were developing today, but the breakout seems to only be catalyzed by some shorts closing which makes the "bullish" move heavier. 

Nonethless, I wouldn't be suprised for a grind up to 6.4k, though the current conditions aren't promising for a further move up, barring a short squeeze on eth shorts. 
A V bottom where?  Do you mean a V after a 10% drop and then a quick 8-10% rebound?
Nice find. 
$6350 seems way too tight of a SL IMO. I know you know this Sloppy but it's good to point out that it's not necessarily about the price it reaches, but how it reaches it. Could easily see a bear flag on the 4hr getting up to 6.4-6.5. Which is why I closed out my short earlier and am staying out unless we hang out in the 6.2's for an extended bit
Surprisingly my tight stop didn't get hit overnight (came super close though) so I gave it just a tad bit more breathing room and am letting it ride. If I wasn't already in position I wouldn't trade here, but since i'm already in a short from above $6700 I figured I'd keep it open just in case there's more drop coming soon.
Don’t have time to write much so going to keep it simple:

1: Kraken. grossly high fees but simple engine.

2: TA works, but people generally bash it. Using support/resistance to trade is more useful in my opinion. In bear markets we have learned recently formations don’t usually work out as anticipated or not as strong as you would like it. 

3: Day trading is the same as margin trading. Trading is the same all around whether you use margin or not. It’s nice to use margin because
      A) You can keep less $ on exchanged
      B) You can use more coins than you own
      C) Can increase your stack faster
       D) But be careful, being leveraged is dangerous

4: Yes, you need money/BTC on an exchange to use margin. For example, If I had 1 Bitcoin and wanted to make a 5X trade 100% of stack, you borrow 4 from the exchange and your now 5 Bitcoin short at XXX price. 
1. most of us use bitmex- sign up with a VPN and you're fine to use it regularly with no VPN after that. It's probably the most trustworthy btc exchange.

2. Yes. I tried ignoring TA entirely and trading mostly on feeling and some really basic TA stuff like horizontal support/resistance and found myself regretting ignoring some stuff. I don't really care what people think- if it means I'm making less money then why am I not using it. There's lots of terrible TA out there that's *very* easy to mock but that's because TA is pretty much as useful as you make it. If you use TA to justify your preconceived opinions then it's never going to be very useful for you. If you use it objectively then it can be pretty useful, imo. You can use technical analysis on various time frames - the lower ones are often unreliable and inconsistent which is the kind people tend to mock. Longer time frame TA for btc is really pretty decent. 

3. margin trading and day trading aren't incompatible- you can do both. day trading is just the time frame you're trading on, margin trading means you're using leverage

4. Yes. this is all automatically calculated. You can't lose more than you have, generally, unless there's some sort of massive liquidation event / you have a massive position. This stuff is taken care of by most exchanges, they have insurance funds and whatnot to take care of this. If you leverage 10x and the price moves 10% against you, you lose your entire position.
> Is margin trading crypto still allowed for US citizens? 

I think perhaps Kraken allows it for US customers.  Many people use BitMEX with a VPN, but realize this is against their terms of service, so creates extra counterparty risk there.   But they have been dependable and not shown any thieving ways or extreme incompetence like Bitfinex and some of the other exchanges.
Please dont trade with leverage. You will make significant losses.
I keep wondering if it's the whales that are shorting this market...
push up -> add to short for a better entry -> no longer bottom shorter.
Bottom shorters...I keep hearing this. Like, since December.
Yeah, I've been drinking as well and I totally agree with you and hope you are right.

Cheers mate and hodl on!
This is bottom
Bud, if that's GDAX (it is), a fee of $1 means you bought what, $100 worth there? Lol

Edit: May have more lines at other price points. Just saying I'm a skeptic.
haha nice.. I'm guessing 5k bottom then sideways till November. Most people seem to be predicting under 5k but I don't see it
> on the off chance this is the floor

That isn't a very strong or confident call.  
> Tequila + Bitcoin= Terrible decisions.

But, Tennessee whiskey + Bitcoin = max gain.
That could be an expensive bender you go on, but I realize sometimes you have to unplug and recharge.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/Ja6te6Vq/
I'm not too surprised. I would expect most stops to be a little bit below the 2018 low.
It was a failed attemp to short squeeze. Shorts went down around 700\~ at the same moment.
Short squeeze attempts and maybe a hidden sell wall 
Pure desperation.  They're scared. And they should be.
I am bored of this, we talk about a short squeeze since 9k... this open short and long position thing is overvalued. 
the only difference is we have what, 28k shorts instead of 40k..? 

Pretty big difference considering the short squeeze was 15k shorts...

so maybe we'll see another 3k short squeeze of 3-5% lol 
Im a dummy when it comes to this but i do believe that theres a quite a few sub 6k shorts trapped.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/CBSeGXBS/

Shorts started increasing around 21:25 as price was dropping but was still slightly above 6k. that carried on untill we got back above 6k around 23:05.

Thing is, number of shorts hasnt decreased. So all those shorts that opened between 21:25 and 23:05 are still open correct?
I agree with your analysis and have placed laddered limit orders to todays low. Last time before the BGD I was also too fearful to enter with the expectation of goblin town, but this is feeling too similar and I think we're building tension for an upwards spring movement. 

Eth shorts outnumber longs, and BTC long/short ratio is pretty much on par. 

I think a bounce of a few hundred to a thousand dollars is very likely here, and all indicators are pointing in that direction too.

what I'm expecting; another drop down as a fakeout with a hefty move upwards. It might take another couple of days in this range before it plays out.

Will abandon this position if we go below 5750 and look for another entry at 5k-4.5k
Wow you are so delusioned lmao
Also: RemindMe! 2 weeks
Can confirm would lol. 
It could absolutely happen. That feeling of helplessness as you’re longing and it keeps dropping is just as painful in the other direction; when you’re shorting and the bastard just goes up and never stops. 
I'd find it hilarious if some aliens came down from Venus and looked like Ronald McDonald.   But ain't gonna happen.
What's hilarious is that some people still keep insisting this is the bottom 
Double bottoms just like double tops rarely happen. Sorry.
You have some sexy charts man. 
That last chart was some spicy abstract expressionism
 art ;D
I think there is a good chance that a rise to $8500 comes soon. Then a downtrend to around $3000± as the true reversal point. 
Don't even bother 

Looking at the chart; just buy 

Before it's too late. 
did ...but hand is bleeding... knife too sharp
What he said. In a couple years you'll be very glad of this wise decision, as dip buyers and hodlers of yore are today.
$9k-$11k
$29,440.88
$7500.00
Just under 10K
Between $5000-$10000
$6000 mean of the median of the quadruple bottom support 
Between 8200 and 10k.
ATH
11k-15k
just under 10k at this point. slow and steady. buy "now" for 2020
4k
$666.66 or $6666.66
Best estimate is $2500.
big level for LTC was $100. its ratio is just tanking. it's down like 10-15% past few days. Look at the USD chart, it's a massive descending triangle. 

LTC looks pretty terrible rn, my target for it is about $55

I think alts are about to throw up any gains they made on their ratios since December
Could you expound on the significance and context of this a little? Thanks. 
Buy and sell walls mean jack shit. There was huge buy walls when Eth was at 1400$

GFY
OK, Eeyore. Whatever you say.
Trust me, man market never works as expected. 
ahh these oracles....
Right? I was reading some comments on the bitcoin sub that is a flaming pile of dog shit these days but so many comments are so negative or about how much money people have lost. I feel bad, but at the same time, those who did  research and some TA knew there was a lot of overhead resistance and no real upward momentum. You can't just invest in a market and expect it to go up which it seems  like so many did with btc.
[removed]
In recent weeks volatility has been very low, as has liquidity and volume. This is especially damaging to those who use leverage in their positions as they have to pay interest and have difficulty closing their positions. 
And what of the people like Warren buffet who invest in companies long term? You act like trading is the only way. 
I can't make money in either direction because all of the exchanges that allow shorting don't allow americans...
That's one way to interpret it, the other way is "how many times do we have to have a failed bull run from 6k before people capitulate?"
And how long does it have to limp along sideways just above 6k to demonstrate to you that people don't think it is worth >6k right now?
How many times does George Soros' new crypto trading platform need to paint a fake bottom using his limitless trading capital to springboard a new fakeout bull run before shorting it all to hell?
I don't think it's bullish. We didn't get a good bounce so i expect a bit sideway-action before a next drop.

edit: i'm sitting on my 8263 1x short and i will not close.

edit2: but if people keep open shorts here we can get a squeeeze... will see.
https://twitter.com/BTC_Schmitcoin/status/1010564032993153024
There is nothing about this price movement that is bullish. The next time we dip below 6k we might not come back for awhile. 

And what is the support and resistance according to you?
Yes it's bullish that's it's not down to $3K yet. The price just dropped to a 6 month low and is now painting a bear flag/pennant.   Keep grasping for straws.   
> Moving on, I'm kind of seeing this as a potential DOUBLE bottom on the daily chart.

I was curious who would call a double bottom first. It was obvious to me that it would be the next bullish hopium after Adam&Eve, triple bottom, and Wyckoff accumulation narratives fail.

Don’t try to cal a double bottom here.  Could it happen ?  Of course it could.  Just like everyone was calling a triple bottom a week ago.  

We just made a new low.  Now is not the time to call the bottom . 
What the hell did I just read?
It's just a good price to buy, relatively cheap, level of liquidity, I'd be careful over extending here, this is how you get trapped.
Why’d you short so close to support?
I'm very curious. Where can you short 10X+? At bitfinex I can only short ~3X.
I’ve heard that exact phrase at 15k, 12k, 10k, 9k, 8k, 7k, 6k

I mean sooner or later it’ll be right.

But remember the people who bought before the start of the bubble run are still sitting at 6x profit 
I have to agree. I'm seeing a lot of negativity and pessimism all over the crypto subs. Bitcoin obituaries are way up. CNBC did a "Bitcoin funderal" the other day. So my point is that sentiment is pretty bad now. I don't know where the bottom is. No one does. But judging off of the sentiment I'm seeing, I'd say we're either there or pretty close. So yes, selling in this range probably isn't a good idea. You really just have to be patient and wait it out. Bull market will come back eventually. 
How do you know? Just because an asset went to 20k, doesn't mean it's undervalued at 30&#37; of it's max value. That makes no sense. For me BTC was overvalued above 4k, but as you see it all depends in the perspective. 
Would recommend people here to check out Jason Jenkins and his trading model. Learned a lot from him!
So much rationality. I'm surprised you weren't downvoted.
20000 IS THE NEW 1200?
Bullish.
So what is your position? I think you are just trolling. 
This is not the chad you are looking for.
What are you talking about
Yeah, it has to be getting frustrating for them by now. I don't know how many times we have to bounce off 6K before they get it through their thick skulls that it's the bottom.
Ascending triangle is generally a continuation pattern.
I don't even get why people would start wondering if bitcoin is dead. we literally went like $50 under the 6 month low...people should start wondering if it's dead at like $1k. anything above that and it's doin just spankin fine
Feels like I've seen more "analyst predicts $100,000 Bitcoin rebound" than true despair
One could argue that the main reason we dropped down to $6k is because of a MM dumping and without continued dumps we won’t be down here for long. We shall see. 
Oh, just wait until the guys who were dumping yesterday cover. That was a lot of coins, and many of them must have been borrowed. Also, steady demand from the minnows and sharks will cause it to drift up. There is no reason to sell right now. If you're down, why take a loss? If you're up, you've been in this game long enough to know that we will go up further at some point.
I feel targeted 

Stop loss set 2 minutes ago and headed to bed in 20
Yup. I'm going on 22 hours (with breaks), and some eyelid-relieving stop losses are sounding pretty fine about now. It just always feels like the next big move is right around the corner...
Absolutely demolished
Yep, he got his buy order filled 
Doesn't that mean a bounce is due soon?
Yeah. Accumulation is typically a process that takes between 3 to 7 minutes.

And now we are at like what? 20 hours? Crazy stuff

We never know man, market is extremely unpredictable. It might take the market couple of years to really bounce back into that crazy bull phase but I'm betting somewhere around August we might see some bullish price Action. Obviously I could very well be wrong. 
Yes. People forget that bitcoin is finite... once they start remembering this it’ll go nuts again
Those are strong hands. RemindMe! 1 week
Lmao I bought in at 13k but have DCA to around 9k
>Its kind of 50/50 which way the market heads in my opinion 

That's an interesting perspective, thanks for sharing my friend!

Send from my iPad
"Whatever it was" was 5927, a new 6 month low.  It's tough to see how that is not a very bearish signal.  I can't say my calculations agree with yours with the odds of a reversal here at 50% or higher, but good luck.
thats probably a good thing
You're selling the bottom. Lol
JUST DO IT BITCOIN. JUST DOOO IT.

You realise the price can continue to go down without any "bears", right?

What happens when people simply can't be bothered to buy any Bitcoin on account of its poor performance so far this year, and the miners continue having to sell in order to pay their warehouse rent?

Jesus Christ, the sheer newfaggotry in bitcoinmarkets these days
You will see capitulation when shorts outnumber longs about 1.2 to 1.
What am I looking at?
Don't wait. 
A random chart found on twitter, shouldnt be considered financial advice 
Nice this makes me feel better about my terrible decisions this past year.
Considering we have been on a very steady downtrend from $10K, I would say it is a smart idea.
Bear trap city.  You're fomoing into this short.
That's very useful thanks
If the price never, ever changes again, people just remember you too had a chance to do nothing at $6,000 and you chose not to.
Yep .. from the back you look a cow in his Asx
Still profitable for me with an s9 and I'm a hobby miner running in the west (high electric costs) running @ stock 14TH@1400W.

If you are a serious miner you will be paying a fraction of the electric I am and probably paid to get your S9's optimised and running at almost 20TH.

We can go a long way down before mining is "unprofitable", at least for established players who have already ROI'd their hardware.
Depends heavily on the region. Also, as a contribution to fixed costs (rigs, floorspace) it is probably worth keeping going anyway.

If time is a variable in the amount of minable coins and you believe the price is going to rise then why not?
Here in Norway some mining operation just added 50k miners, so it must be for some? 
Depends on how expensive your electricity is. When the price drops mining becomes unprofitable for some people, so they stop mining, so the difficulty drops and mining becomes more profitable again. It's not an on/off switch, and there will never be a point where Bitcoin mining completely stops because of the price.
Depends on the algo used and the coin mined.
It seems to be with hashrate at ATH

[deleted]
I don't think any noobs are trying to buy crypto on credit right now anyways 
Related: last year when you bought on ~~gdax~~ coinbase you’d lock in your buying price but then had to wait a week until it was received and you could sell. It FORCED people to “hodl” for at least a week. I wonder if that contributed to the run up. There was one point when I stupidly bought at an ATH and couldn’t do anything as the price  plummeted and then recovered (when segwit 2x was cancelled). By the time I could sell, price had recovered.
It's currently trading as a premium and has been all day. It's small, but considering it was consistently on par or below finex is interesting.

As to your credit card theory, it could be but I wouldn't expect that to be a major factor. Instead, it's just declining interest and the fomo was fueled by herd get rich quick mentality. These people expecting returns have since definitely been burned (potentially even multiple times selling bottoms and buying back in higher). As Coinbase was the entry point for average joe to investing into crypto, the lack of volume probably indicates less retail investment going on, and less retail investors still being in the market, and instead more "professional" traders that want to trade on leverage to maximize returns. 
Or the fact that China has made it harder to buy.
The only bullish thing about the current situation is that there is nothing bullish about the current situation.

The bounce from $6k in February nearly doubled the price of BTC in roughly 3 weeks. Anything close to that would be pretty impressive. I don't think we will see a bounce stronger than that. 
Maybe they believe in the tech long-term. 
Because sentiment like this indicates this is the point of maximum financial opportunity.
For things like DNMs, long term holdings, people DCAing in over the course of the bubble deflating. I wouldn't buy here but a lot of people have different strategies.
I think that's why most people here are shorting BTC instead of buying.  I've been DCA'ing, but I'm done for now.  The trend is downwards, and I haven't seen any evidence of a reversal.

The fact is, no one uses crypto for anything, so why should it be valuable?
In a few years the next manipulation scheme comes out and pushes Bitcoin price to $100
Terrible... 
Nightmare on ALT street would make more sense. 
I'll never see those lost bitcoin again -- me, after half my alt trades
Normies who panic sold 6k that now "want to regain losses" that open shorts ? What could possibily go wrong here?
Almost 1:1. 500 more longs than shorts.
Last time it was at this level was on 13th June and we got a green candle of 400$.. However, this time 4H has much room to go, while on 13th, 4H was overbought too..
Yeah I'm a big fan of him despite our disagreement on the alt market. 

His 2014 projection extends well into 2019 though. Most people dont seem to realize this but the 2014 bear market was just over a year, around 13 months, not 24 months/2 years. I just can't imagine this bear market taking until late 2019 to complete. If it plays out exactly like 2014, then in Jan-Feb of 2019 we will see the bottom, but its been playing out 30% faster assuming the BGD days are the same points in the bear market.
Can someone eli5 this chart for me? 
/u/jarederaj this is a cool chart!

I find any expectation for the predictive power of this chart dubious, however it is a very helpful visualization to help gauge sentiment relative to that in past bubbles.
Well, fuck me sideways...
Are u saying market bears hibernate like real life bears :O
Personally, I think if we blast through 6K again with some volume we are going lower than $5950. So be careful with those buy orders 
I think it is worth noting that I accidentally included flairs in the data by mistake, so "Long" should be a bit smaller, due to the Long-term Holder flairs. I don't think it skews data TOO much though.
Well, the entire image is this sub in a nutshell lol
In my humble opinion, if the whales are gonna squeeze the shorts now at around 30k, then I honestly expect low 5k prices, or maybe lower. Like shorts reset back to 24-25k, and then continue downward movement, on the other hand, if they let the shorts pile up again close to 40k, then its gonna be April BGD once again, then FOMO rally  possibly to a lower high around 8.5k.  PS: Im no wizard, just sharing a thought :)  
 
That's the only real Bitcoin bounce we've had this year. There will be at least a couple more. 

Demand could come from the same people who dumped yesterday or from a bullish whale or just from steady buying by regular folks. Or it could be that people just stop selling so much. Lots of scenarios could drive it up pretty fast. The only scenario that could drive it down much more is another stupid huge market dump like yesterday, and even that would get bought up by big bulls.
if true
> Bear trap is built in to the protocol.

How? lol where do you come up with this stuff
Guys lighten up with the downvotes, it's a joke 
Then he would just be a trader.  This is dumb advice if hes not a trader.
That's trading, not investing though
> Because it is very possible that price can drop to 3-4k over the next months. 

It is very possible the price could drop to where it was 18 months ago, which is somewhere around $1k or lower.   People here suffer from a lack of imagination sometimes.
He's 20. I wish I had 24k at 20 haha.

Which is fine for someone who's 20, as long as that money isn't a result of a lottery ticket or something. If he's making enough to have $24k saved up at age 20 I'd say he's fine losing $12k. He's young, he'll be able to take it in stride pretty easily
>  Just make sure you don't need that money to live off of.

It is half his net worth.   He can't be sure he won't need it to live off unless he has extremely wealthy parents who are his safety net, and if that's the case, that's great. 
 Then perhaps he can be confident he won't likely need that money for food and/or shelter.  Otherwise, of course everything can go to shit in life very quickly and you need that money to survive.
Awesome. Thanks for the explanation Mike.
Agreed. Even those who are right are often wrong. Especially the last couple of months.
Crap
This is not a word of advice??
Sounds like financial advise. Opening my short now. How much leverage should I use?
I literally, I mean LITERALLY sold the bottom in February. 

Panic bought back in at 9.8k :) 
Exactly my thoughts on "V-bottom" ending every bear run for Bitcoin for now.

But, you have to take into account volume that was made prior to it, and in the reversal itself. Dollar wise, we are talking tenfold, even more right now.

Which begs the question, how big the "V" needs to be to confirm reversal?
Sloppy, if I'm your noob uncle but want to invest in some of this Bitcoin stuff, what play would you recommend?
Interesting but the last drop to the 6000 area two weeks ago was kind of a nice V (if I remember correctly, it did almost 10% upward)
Ok. And... what do you want to say???
Okay sounds pretty much a done deal that we will hit about $5k? Wonder why the charts are lagging, probably the market needs more time to realize what is being discussed here?
Thank you, makes me feel less anxious since I hate going against the trend. Honestly, I'd be very surprised to even break 6800. The way we "bounced" from 6K does not inspire a lot of confidence. But it's a decent R/R I guess.
Thanks.
$1500 to $3000 is the same as $3000 to $6000 even though the flat dollar amount differences are $1500 and $3000 respectively.

This is because $1500\*2 = $3000 and $3000\*2 = $6000

percentage change rather than flat dollar change
Yoy need a bit of math to understand it. But it works in market like this: take the number 5 (a price, ...). To reach 25 you need a 5x operation. To reach 1 you need 1/5x operation. But taking log (in base 5 for example) your operations are: adding 1 to 1 (for 5 to 25) or adding -1 to 1 (for 5 to 1). Tge same amount of change in bullish or bearish moves.
You could have googled that, but hey...

from $6K to $30K or from $6k to $1.2K is a 5x in either direction. On a linear scale you would talk in terms of +$24K or -$4800.
> What is logarithmic scale ?

And yes, I down voted you, too.
The effort? How to measure that? 

But in Crypto driving a bull is "easier" I think.
It is getting pretty hot out. (we're down 1500 in the last 8h btw)
I’m kinda disappointed with this breakup. It was a very small triangle ( not wedge ) but the target was $6300 ish.

Was hoping a sharp rise to $6400 to fill a short entry 
yea basically, you know, the ol' bitcoin bounce. We haven't seen it yet. We basically need people to sell the bottom and get caught with their pants down so they buy back higher when strong hands buy the capitulation wick

that's usually how all of the decent rallies start
it's a 2.5% stop loss from here- it's not *that* tight. 

it's not that I don't think it's going way higher if we hit $6350- it's just that I think if we do, it's very possible we muck around $6ks for longer before heading down again, and there's no reason to hold a position so close to the bottom if we don't make a large move down relatively quickly. It's uncomfortable 
I beat you. ;)

Anyone wanna race me on typeracer.com? 

I'm super fast. I tested the other day and got a 173 wpm high score 8)
Thanks for your response, much appreciated
> Longer time frame TA for btc is really pretty decent.

What do you mean by *TA* in this context and across *which time frames* are you talking about?
Yeah. What do you think happened yesterday?  Somebody just said, "Meh, I think today's a good day to market dump the 30K BTC I've been hodling all these years."

No, it was a whale who borrowed coins, probably from the exchanges themselves since none of the big wallets show coins moving out.  They were expecting people to "capitulate" and bring the price down, but instead people bought.  The fun starts when that guy/guys has to cover.
Ground shorters.

Bet you haven’t heard that before, since like ever 
Everyone is a bottom shorter...until the price drops more
I also keep hearing about top buyers since December... 2016.
Wait, I've been drinking?


yeah it was like hardly anything that got filled at that exact price, i think 0.0747 of a bitcoin...


dontchya worry brotherman... I got more than 0.0747 in the tank....


>Tennessee whiskey

you spelled bourbon wrong
[deleted]
it's not always an attempt at a short squeeze. Imagine the price goes sideways and you shorted $6k. You worry the price is going back to $6.5k but no one is going to fill your limit order before going up. 

So you just Yolo close it
Thanks. Another one just rejected at 6160.6. This doesn't look like a short squeeze, but more of a gradual accumulation knowing there's a big buy wall at 6160. Seems they are just letting the price dip a little in between in order for the order book to fill up again as to not blow past the buy wall and have to buy at too high of a price...
Satoshi is coming. And he's angry.
I guess that what matters is the SHORTS-LONGS difference. It was 38k-32k=6k when BGD happened. We will see how they evolve in the following days.
> Thing is, number of shorts hasnt decreased. So all those shorts that opened between 21:25 and 23:05 are still open correct?

yes, unless someone else opened new shorts while they were being closed.
Making perfectly reasoned Predictions = delusional Bear:"you are so delusioned" lmao yourself dude
>Wow you are so delusioned lmao

I agree with their analysis of the numbers more than yours.

' So if you short 1,000,000 on Bitmex now, you will need to pay about 0.4BTC = $2400 each 8 hours. ' - We've seen similar before and that didn't end well for shorters.
This is the bottom! I insist!
What do you mean? w shape double bottoms happen all the time as do double tops.  It's the triple or more bottoms and tops that are rare.
Good bot
[deleted]
in general the market likes to move to where the liquidity is. Part of this is probably because the people who are setting those walls refuse to buy until they've been filled. 

Basically they're very patient, and I'd guess they comprise the majority of buyers. If they're not buying (or selling in case of a sell wall) the market tends to exhaust itself and then move towards the liquidity. 

Once they've been filled they'll probably attempt to kickstart a rally.

This is kind of bits and pieces of the theory behind Wyckoff accumulation on a smaller scale
Buy walls are enticing for big sellers because they can get little slippage (won't cause the price move while selling), so they often serve as magnets instead of deterrents
> expound 
Lots of bids showing "support", but no one buying at this price.
Lol why are you so mad? We still haven't made a new low.
I didn't get into Bitcoin to trust people!
I beg to differ

> In recent weeks volatility has been very low, as has liquidity and volume.

Agree:

volatility (historical low): https://www.tradingview.com/x/2HLyDCuP

volume (decreasing constantly): https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DfLD_GAUEAAiqLs.jpg

liquidity (quasi-random spikes): https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DZYctctX0AE8cbd.jpg

I don't really think these are the 'golden' days for traders. 

Regardless of people their profits/losses, market is pretty shitty for both bears and bulls. Unless you trade on higher timeframes and hold positions for a few weeks, odds of getting screwed, or forced out of a potentially good position, are pretty high (especially on leverage). 
Considering this is supposed to be a trading subreddit...
Kraken?
People buying at 6k are long term holders trying to catch the bottom and are not expecting a quick run up.
I don't think it's very likely going to limp here much longer, oversold like crazy, shorts increasing and will get squeezed pretty good. 
Can you explain that twitter post for someone not into TA? Is that suggesting that volume is very high and it could go crazy up or down?
Why do you expect a drop? Who's selling?
I heard that every other time about 6k. "It's not the bottom for sure, you'll see, SOON, this time for sure!!"
I'm not sure about that. Going down and hitting between $5200 - $5500 and seeing a solid bounce back up to the 8K range doesn't seem unlikely IMHO.
6k and 6.8k. 
Don't need to be a dick, I was merely asking a question. Any time we've hovered near resistance for long periods we got rejected, same happened for support last time we hovered around here. 

Obviously its been bearish the last 6 months, but short term the market has been doing the reverse of what you'd think is bullish or bearish
Called it a potential double bottom. It's only a double bottom if it confirms, tried to make that as clear as possible in my post.

It's a dangerous play but we're all (?) adults here. If I'm right, I make money. If not, I lose money.
Added to my previous entry, and seeing as the resistance at 6.8K  would be gianormous keeping the liq price just below 7K would be just fine for a small short squeeze, which did come. Also abit of stupidity ;)
The place where bad shit happens. Over at BitMex where you can use 100X.

Exactly, why would they sell now?
one reason is the price anchoring of 5800 range + ATH downtrend line  is there 
"Right" is a very subjective word in that sense. The dips at those price points were followed by decent bounces, so anyone that sold there could have waited and sold higher.

If danger of liquidation is not a issue selling right now is pants on head, you know.
A year ago today BTC was 2700. I mean we are getting down there... these are serious lows... if we go to 3k it will be break even after a year of a massive bull run... I just don't believe it. I mean it can happen but it'll just mean this market is retarded (which is true, but is it *that* retarded?)

Pertaining to your point of relative value, I’ve only been in this space since 2016. When BTC first hit 4K, I distinctly remember thinking to myself, who tf is buying BTC at 4K?! Now...I’m starting to DCA in above that 4K price 

Edit: just curious, why am I getting downvoted? 
Very bullish.
I've just been buying in small portions on the way down, not going to add more until low 5xxx though.
Exactly the same chad, just forgot to relog
It's *Chad*, **bear** that in mind
Symmetrical is continuation pattern, ascending is usually bullish.
Tell that to the people that bought at 18k. Those people are terrified right now 
When people believe its going below $1k thats when true despair will set in.

Todays price is the equivalent % of $380 in 2014, which isn't *bad* but the price still eventually fell another 50% from there.
Where? 
Bingo. 
And my guess is that same MM is really just a frustrated price mover who's shitting his pants about having to cover right about now.
Its likely a cold storage was dumped yesterday based on coindays destroyed. 
I guess your long from 6600 isn't so successful anymore since you don't place stops and likely didn't close 
Sounds like you got the market figure out, you should max your credit cards and double your position.

When I read comments like this, it’s almost like you’ve never invested in equities before.

Imagine saying something like this with TSLA 
What makes you think they don't already have more than enough coins to cover and OTC connections to provide said coins without having to purchase them on exchange?
The sellers are the new / future buyers
We are bouncing. It means that it's a weak bounce, I don't expect to see any V shaped bounces except if we really dump lower to important levels like 4.8k. Market just became harder to trade, those real bounces were easy, now it's always uncertain.
No
I doubt it will take until August. That gigantic bull pennant could create some fireworks in July. Unless something really weird happens and we crash to 3k, which is entirely possible, all the signs point to the next big move sustained over a month or more being in an upward direction.
I have also made some trades to decrease the avg. within crypto though,like btc to eth or to ltc when ratio is good. Like now, I am mostly in ltc and eth
yea who knows my calculations are not too technical.  But its at 5924 now so will be interesting how the day plays out.  We could get a big bounce, but that doesn't really mean anything
This is good for bitcoin.
Look at that fakeout upwards before the cataclysmic drop.
Pull those blue lines back a bit to include those high and low candles and it looks a lot more like a bear pennant.
Can I buy a tank of gas with bitcoin? 
I think log are prefered to linear on large timeframe. At least that is what I use

That's is impressively specific
All time log chart, months.
Lol. I didn't. Been dca ing since 9k. Probably going to wait a while b4 adding any more. Judging by that chart there's plenty of time to catch the bottom.
How is it a "random chart?"
you said that at 8k lul
>Though I'm well in profit, I have not closed my 6530 long, nor do I have any plans to do so in the next couple weeks.

I hope your margin is not too big 
lol we'll find out pretty soon
haha yeah. I think my attempt fell flat here, but the point was kind of to get people to see a worst case future scenario and then reaffirm or reconsider their current thinking in that hypothetical context. Most people are already well prepared for a best case scenario.
THats what I’m doing ! 
Right!! Until a proper audit is conducted, Tether is just funny money to me.
it was the page that listed all of the advisors which included the same people who did the FSS report.

people caught on that the same advisors that did the report also work for the bank and they deleted the page

basically it is a conflict of interest.
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/bitfinex-said-to-find-bank-in-puerto-rico-after-wells-fargo-exit

End the feeeeed!!!
If I had one, I'd wear it 
This stopped on coinbase months ago. Everyone got an email, I am pretty sure, that credit card companies had disallowed this. Good IMO. Although I can still finance a depreciating car over 72 months that would recoup 40% of its purchase price at auction. 
On cc, it was instant. I think even some bank accounts were instant in December. I know mine was by Nov. But yeah a lot of banks had that hold
Hmm. Do you mean buying with cc directly on gdax? When I bought on coinbase with cc in 2017 the btc was available immediately for transfer to gdax
Yeah makes sense. Just remember seeing all those "I'm taking out a second mortgage to buy crypto" posts
You’re absolutely right and I’m considering buying here simply for that reason. When everyone expects more down, that’s when it makes the most sense for MM to drive the price up and the move that would extract the most money. 
It's actually very bullish that we didn't break 6k fully. 
could be both. average joe bought 1k btc in 2012 and now he's fuckin around with $6mil droppin bombs on finex like he needs to buy a yacht in the next 5 mins
Like sloppy says its probably some pleb with a lot of money fucking around. Too much was shorted in a too small timeframe for it to be shrimp
Well everyone I know already knows about Bitcoin but a lot of them didn't buy in December because they thought it was too late.  I also got some calls from people asking if I'm still in it and where they should sign-up.  I mentioned that they can buy it in Square, Robinhood, Coinbase etc.
Tupac cares, if don't nobody else care.
Melania doesn't care
Oh snap!
So when BTC hits negative pricing, how do I pay the money I owe?  Does Satoshi take a check?  Do I mortgage my house again (I already mortgaged it once to hop in during the December rally)?  

Joking aside, I've been focusing the majority of my TA studies on quicker movements on the 15 minute candle charts.  I haven't really focused a ton on the 4 hour.  To me, it really does look like there's a 6 month long head and shoulders pattern on the 4 hr chart.  If we go below the neckline (somewhere around $5800-$6000) then it would seem to me that the pattern is complete and $3,000 is in play.  

Who really knows?  I surely don't.  If we dip below $5,800, I might pull some of cold storage and put it in fiat.  If anything, I like learning the hard way with real stakes.  Otherwise I don't really care too much.  I've still got a ton of room before I'm upside down on my buys.  I'll probably just buy more and stick with my short plays.  
Double in three weeks? Hodl my beer...

Bubble popping and year long+ bear markets with no sign of reversal and major altcoin death is the point of maximum financial opportunity? 

At this point, every other place you could invest your money is safer and probably more profitable. 
I don't know man. Catching a falling knife is less about strategy and more about trying to break even.

I don't see anyone who has broken even or in the green not selling and ever looking back on Crypto.


hmmm I use BTC to buy some stuff like IPTV or VPN services, it's very useful sometimes, especially when you don't want to bother giving out your real name and address.
It's pretty widely used in countries with unstable currencies.
It has a few usages, but not really for most people.
In a few years the next manipulation scheme comes out and pushes Bitcoin price to $7,300


Well, that's what's playing out right now, isn't it? 
ohhh god right!!! soooo many blunders over the years!!! 
Especially Eth long/short ratio is looking rather juicy. I'm expecting some fireworks somewhere in the next couple of days. 
Thanks!!
You're a bit missing the point of that analysis, it seems. Don't take things 1:1.
Fuck me sideways never really made since until I bought into crypto.
$1200 trading range that day.
whats your next target below 6000? the log channel upper edge, currently somewhere at 5600-5500?
Supply does not grow. Demand does.  Nobody can dispute the blockchain.  Fuck with Bitcoin, you're fucking with math, and that never ends well.
Am I the only one here who thinks it's wierd to have 24k at any age to spend on bitcoin?!
You're not really saying anything. I don't see how putting over half of your money into something this volatile that has been on a trajectory downward when you've only got ~$24k is encouraging.

Maybe if you're living off your parents and are in college.
In a bubble, the final drop usually retraces close to 50% of the price. That’s your “game over” signal. Then you sit on your hands and wait for a dead cat bounce
No one is every 100% right. Unless you have shorted the entire way down from 10k and held even while underwater 

Sloppy has been right a crap ton the last month catching nearly every top and shorting it 
Sorry.

Word’s of advice

#Plural 
the max for maximum gainzzzzz /s
Maximum. 100x.  You're sure to win. 
Are u me?? People kept saying sell now it’s going lower! I sold when it was like 5.8 and it almost immediately rebounded and I bought higher....safe to say that was the last time I sold 
Exactly what I'm talking about :D 
I'd recommend you not ask some dingus who just entered the space 8 months ago and made some money off a couple shorts 8)

It just depends on your intentions long term, plenty of people are going to start scaling in here soon and I don't think it's a *bad* idea or super premature. There is not a whole lot of upside into *suddenly* becoming a big bear right here. 

As much as lots of people don't think it will, there's nothing barring this from revisiting $3-4k over the next 3 months and then finally bottoming out.

*Personally*, if you were my friend and came and asked me for investment advice and wouldn't let me leave the room until I gave you explicit advice (wow what a good friend), I'd say wait until people get bored of bitcoin and you start to see some great news around it. Then buy over the next 6 months and give it a year. 

Good news would be an ETF, a large merchant picking it up (and preferably not with a huge warning on it- when you try to buy BTC on square/cash app, it literally gives you a huge warning about how it's extremely volatile/risky to buy. *oof*), or some sort of integration with a large institution of any sort. 

Anything but crypto trading desks. Those are not strong fundamentals anymore. People are going to stop trading bitcoin as its volatility decreases. People like trading bull markets, not bearish ones. Most people suck at trading bear markets
Buy literally whenever you like.

Sit on it for >5 years.

nah I'm talkin like that.

and these 4:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/OCdbJbWN/

not this:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/cr4wDIB8/

the first $6k was a perfect v bottom, but we hadn't spent enough time cooling off .

it's possible this could be the bottom since we haven't made a significantly lower low and we've already seen a v bottom tho
I'm confused. What do you mean? I just wrote what I wanted to say. 
you seem nice. no. it’s not a done deal. this could explode 1k up in 5 minutes. this could drop to 4K in 2 days. 
>Okay sounds pretty much a done deal that we will hit about $5k? Wonder why the charts are lagging, probably the market needs more time to realize what is being discussed here?

B+ trolling effort. Here's an upvote for the lulz
It is far from a done deal...that would suggest close to 100% probability.  I would put it at 75% though, at least.

The chart shows a pretty steady downtrend since $10K.  But anything can happen and never get overconfident with your position.
That bull div, though... thinking of going long here also. 
I don't think we break 6500 if we do bounce. 6250 might have been our bounce. I half expect another harsh leg down tomorrow. Either way, I'm holding both shorts for now 
Yeah thanks for it. Im just new guy that doesnt want to make a wrong assumptions. Maybe i should elaborate more on the questions.

But why it can be applied to bitcoin? Or is it just stand alone assesment?

Because i do think hodler emotions quite important.
What is the current trend? Going with it is less effort than going against it. 
You're correct, messed up when I rewrote my comment but edited now, cheers!

I don't know if we break up to 6400 level or near it if it's a really good place to enter a long. Were still very close to bull territory so I don't know if the r/r is really good here. You might want to see how things play out and when the metrics are more neutral/favorable for shorting. 
The market trades much different than it did a year or two ago.  Not sure if that is from more people finally figuring out how to short or more manipulation or a combination, but very rarely are there huge quick crashes like there used to be.

Of course there was the big V bottom in Feb and not like that is ancient history, but that was in the pre-Bart era.

I’m on mobile and watching new season of Luke Cage:(

I’ll race you tomorrow, about to head to the bars. Get ur butthole ready ur in for a heavy ass whoppin 
No problem. Kraken is the only "legal" exchange in the US for margin trading. People avoid it for various reasons, although I think it's a lot better than it used to be.

Most people like bitmex because of the extreme liquidity (you can open large positions without moving the price too much) and leverage (100x, which is totally degenerate, but allows for fun gambling. 10x is great if you're not comfortable holding your whole btc stack on an exchange)
I mean using TA on longer time frames has so far been pretty reliable/profitable, from what I've seen. Most people seem to use it on much lower TFs and it seems more like guessing because it's so inconsistent. In terms of higher TFs TA has proven much more consistent for me 
You are too emotional man. You never makes sense. Even the words you use don't make sense.

You know that nobody dumped 30k BTC at market price. Why even use that as an argument.
You should have listened more closely.
Oh, sorry man, I thought I read somewhere that you were out in a bar. Or your writting style threw me off.

Non-drinking me says you've got quite the chances of being right because this drop was quite weak. At least for now.
I don't know, man... looks like it's primed to break "up". I would hope fore a triple top, though. 
Looks like accumulation to me without wanting to blow past buy wall.
Yeah indeed, but "attemp to short squeeze" doesn't neccesarily means it was with intention from a trader. The market could have naturally attemp to short squeeze it. 
Lol, what is he so mad about? 
Wouldn't Satoshi waking up drive the price down tho?
No the difference and ratio aren't as important as people make them out to be. It's the amount of positions opened.

longs could be 100k and shorts 101k and we could still see an insane long squeeze. 

We won't see that BGD again unless we have lots and lots of shorts open again while going sideways. 

And if we continue to move down 40k shorts won't be equivalent. 40k shorts at 6k is 48k short at 5k 
Makes sense, so that leads me to think that least some (if not most) of the shorts opened during that time are now trapped
so? how was your prediction?
I don't 'do' charts, baby. I just shut my eyes and consult the cosmos. 
So by that logic the buy wall in the 5000s would fill and then...buy more to raise the price to sell the contents of the buy wall at a higher level?
It means to explain in detail.
Why would anyone buy now? We know dumbshits wanna sell cheap.  They're not even hiding it. lol

Beartrap City, here we come!

Get it down to 6K.  I'll think about adding to my long from 6.25.
I'm not mad. I'm mocking Eeyore with his whiny claptrap... doh derp... it's going down.  boo hoo. I'm gonna sell the bottom and give my munnies to duh smart peeplz.  lol

And, by the way, I think you're funny.  Anger is not a thing for me. So try again, trollboy.

What do you base this on?
He's implying that a short squeeze may be coming (a sudden price increase in an attempt to liquidate short sellers) 
At the bottom you see the shorts (red) and longs (green). Shorts are increasing.
everyone who thinks the price is going down more and wants to profit from it
Bots? People who think they can rebuy lower?
Pussy 's
That's not what he said.
> Short term the market has been doing the reverse of what you'd think is bullish or bearish

Speak for yourself. Everyone is not that confused.

Haha. Well good my dude. :)
Pretty much a gamblers haven. Rather sad if you ask me. Leveraged moonbois and addicts.
Dafuq?
a lot of reasons.

1. they see their profit disappear. so they start selling to lock in some profits before its all gone
2. lot of people got rich very quick(many at a young age). When that happens they tend to splurge. So they might buy a house or a nice car or develop a coke habit. But all those things have recurring costs. And then every month they need to pay taxes/insurance etc. All that costs money and means they need to sell BTC to pay bills(regardless of what the price is like)
3. a lot of people simply have weekly sells where they liquidate a portion of their holdings no matter the price
4. BTC attracted a LOT of traders. But there isn't enough liquidity to support all of them(hence the barts). But the thing is, these people aren't buying to hold, they are buying to scalp. Which means in a bear market if the price starts dropping they'll start selling. Because they stop losses would start getting triggered. 
5. BTC can be shorted. So a lot of people are doing that. For them a move down is just as profitable as a move up


There is a reason so many lottery winners go broke. And BTC was the winning lottery ticket for MANY people. And all those people who had a shit load of money dropped on them, are now having their fun. But unlike the lottery where the money is in cash, their winnings are in a somewhat liquid asset that's been dropping in value every month, which gives them that extra cause of concern. 

Because a 6x profit is better than a 2 or 3x profit, especially when you were at 20x profit at one point in December

So are you expecting it to hit low 5k?
Yes, a bullish continuation pattern. A big move up forms an ascending triangle during a consolidation period, followed by a breakout. After a big move down such as the last few days, this is not an "ascending triangle" in any traditional sense of the pattern. This is more of a bear flag than an ascending triangle, if anything at all.
I'm guessing a good chunk of those already sold at a loss. There were plenty of opportunities to panic sell since December. 
I really feel for them, and it really sucks, but unfortunately those people are not really necessary to declare bitcoin dead or alive.

The people who are generally going to move the market for the next 3 months are people from 2013-2017. I think if we continue to see downwards movement/panic selling it'll be from people who bought in early 2017. 

I don't know if anyone else notices- but there's a high churn rate on this subreddit. Lots of new people every few weeks with people from 2-3 months ago leaving. Imo this is because people are selling and leaving. When people are worried about selling, they visit here for a few weeks. 

They panic sell, the prices bounces or tanks and then they stop visiting 3-4 weeks later. 

Seeing new usernames pop up while the price goes down is bearish- it means people are interested in selling. 
Well, I looked at the biggest wallets. None of them moved enough coins to account for yesterday's dump. Some added. These guys will be buying back at some point.
I doubled down at 5999. Not worried. It's a tiny little bit of my stack that I sent to Bitmex a few years ago. I'll just buy back whatever I lose if I lose (which I really don't think I will now that my average is ~6300).
Ya late July and early August is where I am most curious for. Let's see what the market has for us. 
Alts aren't looking too good rn man. I am in VEN but it's tanking like crazy. BTW are you Indian by any chance? 
$8k to $20k is a hell of a "fakeout"
It is just for comparsion.
That’s a stretch and a half 
Good bot
>All time log chart.

Ta!
I think they think their posts have an effect on price
Look at the date.  Where did we go after that?  Yeah, I closed with a profit, albeit small.  And I'll close with a profit on my current long at 6250 too.  Plus, I collect the short tax until then, as I did on the last one.

6K is the bottom, and if you're shorting/selling it, I deserve your money and won't have the least bit of guilt about taking it.

PS -- your weak little dump just got bought out by a school of minnows.
Oh yeah? When?
Very interesting, thanks for the link
There are 2 scenarios of this resolving.

We're either in shake out phase and large players are accumulating from Joe's.

Or we're after the last bubble BTC will see and large players are exiting the market...
If the price drops they will blame you. If the price rises they will thank themselves.

No up side to it.
They were right to not buy in December though, most of them would of just seen the price rocket up and not sold without any experience in how market cycles work

I get you, just playing devils advocate. A lot of people buying crypto wouldn't even know what catching a falling knife means in this context. I think a lot of crypto traders are really young and naivee and probably still haven't figured out that we're still in a downtrend(not talking about people in here... generally)...

It's not a bad place to DCA TBF if you don't think we're going much lower. Personally I think we'll see 3K which II doubt will hold so loo0king for the bottom to be either mid 2Ks randomly or 1.4K. That's likely to take a few months though. I'm not planing any trading so much until we hit 5K or close to it. Got 2 comfortable shorts from a fair bit higher, think I'll close one take 50% profit on the other and then double down on my sept short when the time is right
I've seen anecdotal evidence of this, but I don't think that the average citizen of a place like Venezuela is spending BTC at their local market.
Elm Street / Bitcoin Street, no link at all. Doesn't even rhyme. Some shit that you put together to feel like you achieved something. You fool. 
I think the real cool multi hedge trade here is to open a position on the right side of ETHBTC too, since that is usually heavy amplified when the underlying there moves. it could lead to like a domino squeeze.

Same with EOS which longs got rekted yesterday
Damn, you're right. Looking at that I think traders except bigger returns on ETH shorts due to the larger multiplier movements. Is this a candidate for a short squeeze?
5500 and then 4700
Supply has been growing since the day it was created :P

Demand doesn't necessarily always go up, either
have fun shorting as it goes to 500k.  Blockchain is immutable.  Simple math, unless you can crack sha256.  Game over.


I think most people in here have at least 10-20k in bitcoin, actually. 
[deleted]
thx mate but I will be wrong at some point. I mean I was hella wrong about the timing of the drop below $6k, I thought it was happening in April and then look what happened. 
I think you are.. sloppy
Lol i think uncle Pan would be confused with your round about way of saying wait a bit. Jk :-p

Seriously though, I appreciate the feedback. Cheers.
>There is not a whole lot of upside into suddenly becoming a big bear right here.

>As much as lots of people don't think it will, there's nothing barring this from revisiting $3-4k over the next 3 months and then finally bottoming out.

Those statements are contradictory, visiting 3k is a whole lot of upside. It's the same as selling at 20k and buying later at 10k.
[deleted]
I don't see anybody calling for even 7k.
But basically everybody here is calling for at least $5k, some even lower. So if that's the case, it is bound to happen. 99%
It can be applied everywhere. History of the asset proves its usefulness or uselessness. 

Emotions of hodlers are in the chart: panic buy, panic sell, ranging market, ...
I’ll probs just hold off. Still short 50% stack from $6720.

Are you in position? Haven’t seen you post in a while 
Yea, I agree, but I think it'll happen. I like to look at the sentiment and so far, it seems most people here are generally "okay" with these prices. They don't think it's going much lower nor are they particularly uncomfortable hanging around here. 

most rallies/reversals are started when people sell the bottom and then buy back higher. 

In short, we need people to panic buy. You don't get that with people thinking "this is fine"
Which time frames though and what TA? RSI divergences? Candlestick shapes? 

I think the 4 hr is the most valuable chart. It's amazing how well certain indicators perform most of the time on 4 hr. This includes William's Fractals for setting stops and the entire cloud system on double settings. 4 hr is the right mix of aggressive yet cautious signaling. 1d and higher and 1hr and lower are less useful. The higher being too slow to calibrate and react to significant moves (because Bitcoin is so volatile and fast sometimes) and the lower being *too* sensitive to volatility and can quickly turn the wrong way, despite good signals.
...and get shaken out at the end of every big move ever. Bad advice.
People selling his legacy at sub-par prices
Yeah, I mean anyone buying low always has the intention of selling higher

Expectation. Everyone knows we are in a downtrend of a crash and a reversal is not sudden. Every crash in Bitcoin history reverse only after a long time of bottoming / sideway.

Do you hear anyone here saying that they are buying at 6k because they expect a quick full reversal?
This is what happens when 17 year olds are allowed to "invest" in magic internet money.
Thanks. Kinda like end of april squeeze? That would be good for me and I wouldn't foolishly think it was the start of a bull run and take profits this time 
Thanks! I give people credit for having the balls to short btc at 6k. I would have anxiety 
[deleted]
This guy doesn't Bitcoin.

I take my profits in Bitcoin. I'm not trading it for Monopoly bank money.  Ever.
And 100x profit is better than 6x profit.  That's what I was at when we touched 20K, and that's where we're going again, smart guy.  

There is a limited supply of Bitcoin, and demand hasn't even begun yet.
Gold 'crashed' 50% after futures went live, then went on a 10x+ rise. If you're going to bring up whatever examples, may want to at least make sure that they actually fit your point.
You never know when Bitcoin will do its explosion upward thing.  That's why you only buy, never sell.

Do any of you guys seriously think this isn't going to explode upward?  Seriously?  It's just a question of when, not if.  Smart money buys.  Dumb money sells. *Especially* in a down market.  Ever heard the expression "Buy low, sell high?" In this market it should be, "Buy low, never sell."

The only thing that would make me nervous about the value of Bitcoin would be if the coins in Satoshi's wallet started moving.
It would make more sense to me for the bottom than $6000, so I kind of expect it. At least I did yesterday, the way 6k is holding and shorts are skyrocketing is making me reconsider that expectation.
Flag is a flag, triangle is a triangle.

I'm fully aware it can break either way. Every bullish pattern in bear trend breaks to downside more often. But we had like 3 legs down in a row, it's a possibility it'll retest 6.3-6.4 before going down more.
So we can take that 6600 long off your successful trades then so back to "4 out of 5" 
then 😆
;)
The price just hit a 6 month low and looks like more down down down.  Allow them something, however absurd, so they don't start jumping off balconies.

"lambs" doesn't rhyme with "lambos". 
Having it already and having money to buy it are different things though.
I really hope your parents are paying for your insurance, housing, food, school, and so on.

>Also - look at the bitcoin charts and the patterns.

Tells me we're going to break 6k. If you can hold on for months or years, good. But that means you can't use that money until then.

>A bunch of long term triangles.

You don't even know what a triangle is.
You’re more right than you are wrong ( Knock on wood ) 

So your trading gains must be pretty decent besides when you shorted the fuck out of the rise up to 11.7k top 
I thought about taking that out because you're right, it doesn't make a *whole* lot of sense. It's just that as we go farther down, it really does get more difficult to go farther down barring actual "bitcoin ded" or something 

What I'm saying is shorting $8k+ bitcoin is a lot different than shorting it at $4k or $5k. because the downside just doesn't have the same room. If btc really ded and it goes below $3k or something, it's going to take a pretty long time barring some catastrophic news 

Shorting $20k is a lot different than shorting $6k. I get your point, but there's a very clear difference there.

I'm also speaking from a perspective of someone who was formerly bullish and intends on being bullish later. If your intention is to get more bitcoin to save up for later, it's odd to start shorting it now instead of simply just buying more. 
It could as easily go up from here as well.  I think that's his point.
I said *when*ever, not *what*ever.

We're talking about BTC.
bitcoin not shitcoins
That's because people who call for 7K get downvoted to oblivion in this discussion.

I would recommend you not listen to any of them except the ones telling you to go long.  I'm currently long from 6250 and feeling pretty good about my chances.

I like your username, and I think I see what you're doing here. ;)
Your premise is incorrect.
>But basically everybody here is calling for at least $5k, some even lower. So if that's the case, it is bound to happen. 99%

The market doesn't much care about what a few people on this subreddit think. I suggest finding other indicators to base your trades on. 
hi.  you must be new here.
still holding a 25% long from somewhere in 7k that I entered a month ago (it's in euros, and about 20% underwater), haha. I'm looking for a place to DCA my entry down a bit. I exited my hedge short right before that entry, and haven't shorted since I'm not too confident about shorting here. 

Though to be fair, I could see us grind down much lower, hence I'm just waiting out the market for now.

Edit: I'm also trading euro, so hedging against the euro with btc has proven to be quite alright in mitigating losses.  
I pretty much exclusively use the 4h for most of my entries, but that's mainly to narrow shit down. The 1d is the best one to know *what entry* I want. If the 1d looks good for a position, I'll go down to the 4h and then try to pinpoint a good entry.

Anything lower and you just start confusing yourself and asking yourself all sorts of irrelevant questions ("hm I want to short but 1h rsi is showing hidden bull div!")

But I really think the most useful thing so far has been simply horizontal lines. Wayyyyyyy too many people underutilize simple support/resistance lines/areas. 

They try to overcomplicate it with lots of extra TA

but yea I agree. I've found most of the more successful swing traders I follow primarily use 4h, 12h, and 1d charts. the 12h is mainly to clarify intraday movement, though, you could probably skip out on using it entirely and be fine

But yea, basically:

1. *horizontal* support/resistance
2. chart patterns on 4h+ (simple ones, nothing wild, nothing that requires adding lines or guessing the future for it to complete)
3. divergences
4. diagonals for potential trend continuation/reversals


that's pretty much all I use lately. most of the diagonals I use are *exclusively* when they interact with horizontal support/resistance, patterns, and divergences. Diagonals by themselves are pretty useless and unreliable 
$6120
Except in Bitcoin where a great plurality have no intention of ever selling to fiat.  We're taking over. We're not playing that game.
What I meant to highlight was that the buy wall individual would be in an interesting spot because they would probably see the price go below their wall, and they would have to have funds set aside to buy up even more, enough to incite an increase in the price, and then they would probably also need enough set aside to operate bots to maintain a distribution price range.

In short they probably have a lot of money to accomplish all three phases of that. I figured whoever was interested in that would use the short liquidations to make the pump cheaper and more effective since the volume at any given level here seems limp.
Whoa shit haha, i thought you'd be young but that's younger than i thought!  You seem wise beyond your years, sir.

Nice sentiment. Unfortunately, things cost money so most of us need to realize profits by selling some of our magic beans. 
Yikes - you were at 100x at the peak parabola, you held for some reason, and now you are back to 6x? That has to sting like nothing I have ever experienced. 
>And 100x profit is better than 6x profit.  That's what I was at when we touched 20K, and that's where we're going again, smart guy.  

With such a clear crystal ball, you must be immensely rich and famous. I envy you.

Lol. Fuck off, creep. 
I guess. It's not like $10-20k is really *that* much money for the majority of people investing, though. 


[deleted]
Fortunately my position sizes increased as I kept trying to get the top. I was very close to being liquidated and pretty much giving up trading as I had a hard limit on how much I was willing to lose before continuing. finally caught that top (2 times actually, I shorted $11.6k both times around on the double top but never closed the first one- I actually managed to lose money on it somehow. Wow, right) and when it tanked I just kept adding on the way down. 

I figured if I was going to be right, I was going to be really fucking right. If I was gonna be wrong well, that sucks. Wouldn't have lost much, would've just closed breakeven. 

That's generally my trading strategy now, which I think is pretty useful. if I'm going to be right I'm going to be *really, really* right and if I'm going to be wrong, well I'll take a breakeven/small loss and move on. 

but yes, it's kind of crazy to think about but if I closed everything right here I'd have 26x'd my stack from the bottom of its btc value. As in, I now have 2600% of the bitcoin I had right before I quit trading lol
I have no idea what you're talking about, I'm a harmless little investor bunny. https://i.imgur.com/laGryAA_d.jpg
the decline from $20000 to $6000 says otherwise 
Yes. If you can "trick" the market into selling and shorting low into your liquidity then pump it after it's clear, you've trapped people and force them to mark up the price even higher for you. 

This is exactly what happened in April

It's all a big game. People always think it's bulls vs bears but really this market is more about strong vs weak hands 
Thank you, that means a lot. I just got too much time on my hands! 

they say fluid intelligence peaks at 26 so I guess it's all downhill from here 😅

I doubt many people rely on bitcoin profits to cover their daily living costs, in the same way you don't sell your stocks or cash out your ISA to pay for your house every month. It's simply a part of their investment portfolio, not a current account.
It's always different.  Every second of every day is different.

If you are asking why it's likely the price will drop below $6000, it just did yesterday and the chart suggests it will again. Plus the fundamentals are weak and only getting weaker.

I could be wrong but I'd beg to differ. Personally I'd say you've got to be in a fairly elite bracket where that much money is loose change that you're comfortable to put into a highly volatile asset like Bitcoin. Personally I'd be surprised if the majority of people invested in Bitcoin put in more that 1k at the time of investment.
Sure.
It would certainly help having the unlimited funds needed to market make at that scale and see behind the curtain.

Frankly, to everyone else, we can suppose this might be happening but on the same hand it could be propped up to sell at a higher price point than goblin town...we never know where the target is, what the plan is. 

To me, earlier today, it looked like a sell wall was in place with a bot keeping the price just below the sell wall. The bot looked like it was lifted when natural buy pressure let up, and the price continued to drop to a new level. It stepped down a couple of levels where no buy pressure existed. 

So to me it looks like the price is being supported in a favorable selling range relative to a natural new low being blocked out.

Ya, unfortunately with this stuff you can also over complicate and look too far into it if you start thinking hard enough. My opinion is to take these theories and apply them to what you think *will work*. Will accumulation at this level be successful? Or will the market end up trapping the accumulators??

Don't get me wrong, I'm sure there's plenty of people that can and do buy more than 1k's worth. My point though was that generally speaking, 20k is a lot of money for an average person to invest, especially in Bitcoin.

Edit: following on from my point above though, I'd still argue that most people, especially in this last bull run, invested around 1k average (or something in that ballpark)

lol there was nothing wrong with that whole thing. It's just a dumb lil news channel preamble. I don't know why people thought it was so crazy. If you overlaid a bunch of people saying "Trump is the best" it'd sound creepy too
Ironic, coming from a windowlicker like you.
Translation: I am a broke little bitch and cannot provide proof of my $10 in Cryptocurrency.

Time to go pretend you're a big shot somewhere else, kiddo.
I mean... It's a fairly small sample size, don't think it does much to invalidate what I was saying. Who knows, I could be wrong though, maybe people are way richer than I think!
Because the news is more manipulated than bitcoin's prices and you shouldn't trust it anymore than you trust the bitcoin market.
Enjoy being a sad, loser bag holder intensely jealous of people who are more successful than you. Then again, it isn’t exactly hard to be more successful than such a irrelevant waste of human flesh.
I really do think you're underestimating. Every single person I've talked to has at least $10000 in btc, and I'm just talking to normal dudes like 23-30 y/o

idk maybe I'm just overestimating cause I assume others are more invested than I am lol
just like the bitcoin market I just run with the manipulation. You can still get what you want out of the news/market if you're careful 
Trump is a failure, and there is literally *nothing* I am jealous of him about.  I just want that moronic cunt to stop fucking up his country and the world.
Yeah I mean ultimately we're both just guessing here based on different points of reference so its a moot point really. I guess the way I see it is $10k is a lot of money to an average person -- most people really don't have that kind of money at their disposal, especially for something so speculative and risky as btc. I think this last bull run did however get alot of 'average' people into bitcoin - just more in the sub $1k range!
So what do you think about our recent bounce from 5900?  We broke through 6k but it didn't trigger a bunch of cascade of stop losses like I was hoping it would.
You are far, far too dumb to be able to judge Trump for anything. It would be like a grubworm judging Elon Musk as a failure. Your opinion is just as meaningful as that worm, except that worm is actually useful to the planet, unlike you.

And I love how you don’t even contest the fact that you are a sad, loser bag holder. But it’s okay, I think you have actually over-performed given how little you had to work with. Being a sad, pathetic, irrelevant, idiotic loser is quite an achievement for someone as useless as you.
It's not that i don't think a lot of people put in that much, I just think the average and possible median would be around $5-20k
I don't know if we're going to have a massive sell off like that. people seem to be wary of setting stops now :P

I actually am doubtful we're going to pass $6200-6300 here but we'll see 
Kewl stori bro.  Trump is a worthless sack of steaming shit, and so are all his supporters.  Yeah, *all* of them.
ah ok. Just did a quick google search for 'Average Bitcoin Investment' and according to [this site](https://oneworldidentity.com/survey-finds-average-bitcoin-investment-3k-plan-less-3-years/) ( the first one with a $ figure ) it's $2,930.85... which somewhat amusingly is somewhere closer to the middle of what we're both saying! How reliable that poll is though is anyones guess.
Whats that, grubworm? It’s hard to hear you down there slithering through the muck and offal.
Hah, sounds about right tbh. I think I'm thinking of the average investment. Median of $3000 sounds pretty accurate.
