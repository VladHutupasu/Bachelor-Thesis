TL;DR = DYOR, tribalism makes bad traders, learn the mechanics of leveraged trading, and don't be dicks

-----    

A few thoughts have been bouncing around in my head in regards to the content of this sub, specifically the past couple weeks. There has been an influx of newer traders and fewer posts/charts from the more experienced faces around here. There's also been a sentiment shift since the bounce off 6110. I've seen a number of posts from newer traders asking for help or citing confusion as to what's happening, and I've tried to answer the questions I could.

The militant tribalism on both sides has ticked up a notch as well. For newer traders who are looking to learn from more experienced traders, be very wary of people that say the same thing regardless of market conditions. Being a perma-anything (permabull/permabear) is very dangerous when trading. Keep in mind that past performance does not guarantee future results. I've seen a number of statements that overtly guarantee BTC will make them rich and that holding will provide significant returns in the future. It's possible, and it's the hope, but it is *not* guaranteed. Look for traders who provide analysis and logic to their trades. Your job as a trader is to take in as much information from market movements, your own analysis, and other interpretations as possible. Then digest and solidify your strategy/plan, and execute it. 

Now, the most frustrating thing to me is the rise in the permabull sentiment, or at least how vocal it is. There's only one obnoxious permabear I can think of (also a BCH shill), but they're just as annoying and dangerous. I highly recommend against tailing any trader blindly, and I hope no one would open or close a position solely due to someone else opening or closing a position. It is important to do your own research and to understand *why* you're taking a position before you do it. 

One other major misconception that gets thrown around here *constantly* and is obnoxious and outright false: that shorters cannot be bullish. Look, I get that shorting an asset is profiting on it losing value and, therefore, it's rational to think that shorters *want* goblin town. While there are undoubtedly some folks shorting BTC that legitimately want it to collapse, most of us don't. We just see it as overvalued for the current tax/legal/adoption environment and want to accumulate more of it for the eventuality that it is widely adopted and gains significant value, and/or we're reacting to market movements that indicate to us that we're heading down. Personal bias always comes into play to some degree, but we should be changing with the market.

Let's say you have 1 BTC which you bought at $7000. You want 2 BTC. There are 3 ways to get it:  

1) Buy another BTC for $7000 fiat  
2) Sell your coin for $7000 and hope the price drops to $3500 so you can buy 2  
3) Open a leveraged position with your coin  

Option 1 takes additional fiat, but it's a guarantee. Option 2 takes no additional fiat, but is unlikely to occur. Option 3 allows you the potential of gaining more BTC without committing any further fiat. The trade-off is that you're risking some of your current BTC.

Permabulls relentlessly bash shorters, but their focus is on the wrong place. Traders who open a short position are actually 100% guaranteed to buy BTC later. Ironically, people who are leveraged long are more likely to squash a bullrun than shorters are by taking profit (a la sells). Shorters actually soften the landing on dumps with profit-taking (a la buys) and accelerate bull runs with stop losses. It's counter-intuitive, but it's reality. Going leveraged long or leveraged short poses the same risk to your holdings. The only truly permabull approach should be a HODL/DCA stratagy. Additionally, many traders that short here are merely hedging short to protect the fiat value of their portfolio.  

I bought BTC initially with fiat. I want more BTC, but not enough to throw more of my fiat at it. I'm risking my current BTC holdings rather than my fiat, because my fiat is more important to me *right now*. That doesn't mean I don't believe in BTC or I want it to fail--quite the opposite. I may commit more fiat to it later. It may be higher or it may be lower than where we are now.

Sorry this was so long. I landed in this sub originally because of the quality of content over the cesspool that is pretty much every other crypto subreddit. I don't want to see this one follow suit.

Good luck all.  
holy shit closed my chewy-inspired short (no offense Chew you're the best) literally the second before the candle on my phone. I have *never* closed a position within seconds that close to a huge move before. oh man the adrenaline fuck im an addict aren't i
I always find it interesting to go back and read the dailies from years ago. Here's the one from ~3 years ago (Wednesday, June 17, 2015). It's fascinating how many comments are so similar even after 3 years.

I sold at a massive (year's rent) loss NINETY SECONDS before getting fucked by the big green dildo. Time to take a few days off. 
Ahh. The famous “ Time to go sideways for 16 hours” 

See you guys at $6740 at 10pm tonight 
If anyone is curious as to Tether's reasoning for engaging a law firm this time, as opposed to an accounting firm, this is what they are saying: (Whether you choose to believe them is up to you)

"First off, the report is not an audit. It was prepared by a law firm – Freeh Sporkin & Sullivan, LLP (FSS) – not an accounting firm. 

That's not for lack of trying, according to Stu Hoegner, Tether's general counsel.

"The bottom line is that an audit cannot be obtained," Hoegner told CoinDesk, claiming that this problem is not unique to his company but one faced by the entire cryptocurrency industry.

He went on:

"The barriers to getting audited are simply too big to overcome right now, and not just for us."

Those barriers include a steep learning curve for auditors in an emerging industry; accounting standards that predated the advent of cryptocurrency, creating uncertainty about how the rules apply; and the resulting need for auditors to exercise judgment, which is "anathema to a lot of large accounting firms. As a CPA, I understand that," Hoegner said. 

In this situation, he said, "we've gone for next best thing.""

when someone gives an opinion/prediction people say "oh yea? Short/long this. put your money where your mouth is" but when they do open a position people say "you're biased/trying to get the price to move in your favor".

We traders have been oppressed for too long! rise up!

In all seriousness I think I'm gonna try to restrict myself to only saying the former and not saying the latter anymore. I think it'd be good for this sub, too
!short XBTU18 6747 2x 50%

I set my target and it hit. Let's see if it was a terrible idea.

This tether news is good news for BFX and the crypto space as a whole, and will hopefully put some of the tether FUD to rest.

It doesn't change any of what's been happening for the last 6 months.
Not convinced yet. Still 75% fiat until choppiness ends. If I miss out on some profits in the meantime, that's fine, but I'd rather do that than FOMO 

*edit: The reason I say this is because we bounced around this support zone (~$6,720-$6,780) for about 42 hours before the continuation of the downtrend just before June 13th. (Disclaimer: This is noob TA. I'm practicing identifying patterns and sticking to my plans/not basing moves emotionally)

*edit2: wrong date
Welcome to another week in a boring channel! 
Charlie lee: “ I believe we are kinda in a bear market right now” 

Nailed it on the head Charlie. We are down 70% and we are in a kinda bear market. Roger that. 

meh market seems to have absorbed the news pretty well
Short from around $6,640.

Edit: the potential bull flag that the market had been forming since the move from $6,400 to $6,850 broke down earlier. 

Since the large consolidation triangle broke down when the market broke below $7,000, I've been looking for a decent opportunity to open a short. It's possible I could see a better opportunity later this week or next, but personally I'd rather just take a decent short position than wait for the perfect short position that never comes. 

I'll probably exit for a loss if the market breaks back above $7,000. 
Quick question as I'm uncertain how said formation pans out:

If (hypothetically or otherwise) this is a big descending triangle from ATH (log or linear) then what would the target price be defined as?

>*In general, the price target for the chart pattern is equal to the entry price minus the vertical height between the two trend-lines at the time of the breakdown.* 

I'm not sure how to interpret this. Does that mean if we broke down now (like today for example) we'd expect to break down to \~5.2k (linear) or \~4k (log)? Some visual demonstrations seem to imply taking the difference between the high (20k) and the bottom (6k) which is obviously not right... Else we'd all end up owing \~8k for every bitcoin we owned aha.

I'm definitely being dumb, but I think I've painted myself into a incorrect logic corner and would appreciate any help. 
Opened a long at $6,650 on the way up here, if there is no follow through and we drop back down, will probably close at break even.

edit: I closed my long from yesterday for a <1% loss when we popped back up to around $6,600, would have been better to have held it but didn't want to mess with "hack" stuff, just not worth the r/r imo. 
I'm not really buying the various triangles/wedges here. I just think we're in an ascending channel that may or may not be within the larger descending channel from 10k still.  

https://imgur.com/a/aUmrsXa

PS: I really hate that "trendline" down from 10k since it was violated for a while already, and you can draw it a couple of different ways. As shown, we're bumping up against it, but I don't know how reliable this is.

Is it time to start DCAing again?
Is the Bart a recent pattern? They seemed to begin around early April this year. In six years of trading I never recall seeing them before now. And since April they've been common - almost predictable. What do you think?
Look at what bitthumb migration to cold wallets has (supposedly) done to the mempool and tx fee: https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#1,2d

Has anyone sent some around today?  How did it go?  Normal or did it get slow and expensive like we had months ago?

Seeing this makes me think btc isn't out of the woods yet on scaling fundamentals (not trying to FUD).

Does bitthumb not batch?
!long XBTUSD close 6620

Forgot to update yesterday
(Shamefully sold at the bottom but no regrets - Fkin Bithumb..)
Should we even be surprised by this bart at this point?
Reversal or bear flag on the 4h?

Hey guys just trying to learn some basic TA, i.e., how to ~~cut~~ draw lines on the charts, I tried the [ATH resistance line,](https://www.tradingview.com/x/AzOvpZEQ) first point of contact is ATH and second at the recent fall from 76xx. Is this line correct? I have it currently at $6,880 Appreciate the feedback. :)
Daily starting to look like a rising wedge, for now at least. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/xheFjv9X/
Haven't posted in a while, but I've certainly been watching the markets.

Here are some 4 hr charts:

Finex: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/TGxmCeY6/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/TGxmCeY6/)

Stamp: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/v5bEDAKi/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/v5bEDAKi/)

Normiebase: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/yW9l7a8u/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/yW9l7a8u/)

An Eth Chart from Finex, as I like to trade/watch that pair too, as an indicator: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/H4Y9QbJL/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/H4Y9QbJL/)

I think this channel we are in is certainly reliable enough to trade. Pretty salty we didn't get closer to $6k on 6/13, as that would have hit the trendline (as I had lots of orders in the $60XX range). Nevertheless, the bounce was welcome.

The risk/reward short for BTC is going to be somewhere around $6850-6900, with a stop above $7000. The breakout long above $6950-7000 should be meaningful enough to have a great long entry, should that happen.

I am curious to see what Eth does here, as it is further up the channel, and touching the trendline as we speak. I took a small Eth short here, but I'd like it a lot more if BTC was in a similar place in the channel. No doubt an Eth fakeout is in the cards should BTC make a run at the trendline and hit 6900 or something (and end up getting rejected).

Let's see what the next few hours has in store for us, and happy trading out there folks.
I love waking up to some freshly loaded Korea FUD

Just about the only certainty in crypto is prices dropping after an exchange gets hacked. As cause or consequence, stoch rsi and macd has now started turning downwards for 2h, 3h, 4h, 6h, 12h. Daily still looks relatively bullish for those indicators in the short term. There appears to be a bear flag forming on the daily with two bumps so far. 

On a sidenote, ETHBTC broke through [a significant resistance yesterday](https://www.tradingview.com/x/TmeYZcUQ/). Although it seems unlikely that is what caused its rally relative to btc, TA on ETHBTC is probably not common (for good reason - its too meta).

I'm 3x short from 6750 btcusd / 535 ethusd but I'll admit I kind of lucked out with the timing of the hack, wasn't feeling great about the entry beforehand. Now my stops are in profit in case this hack drop is just a fakeout and we continue upwards. (In case this is all just a daily bear flag I can probably get a better entry on another bump even if I get stopped out here.)



Good too see we are back at same levels before the hack. 
noticed that many alts did not went up this time together with Bitcoin?
Short-term bulls obviously managed to defend the quite significant area around 6.6k and the high-volume node there. With this small push just recently bulls (at least temporary) pushed through an even bigger high-volume node: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/B0zfWnLW/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/B0zfWnLW/)

Below are the cloud signals to watch before taking a long position (according to the cloud system). I'm guessing that all signals will confirm bullish if we keep pushing above 6.9-7.0k in the next day or so.

**1. Price above kijun (just bullish):**

This is also the first time since the triangle broke down that we crossed above the 4H kijun. That's an important bullish signal (but needs confirmation of other signals as well): [https://www.tradingview.com/x/oYSyHqZO/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/oYSyHqZO/)

**2. TK cross (still bearish):**

We're want a bullish Tenkan / Kijun (TK) cross, which we are very close to: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/ippVD5b9/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ippVD5b9/)

**3. Cloud structure (still bearish):**

The cloud is still red (bearish) and it recently expanded as well. So the cloud will not twist to bullish anytime soon: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/by1eCi9x/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/by1eCi9x/)

**4. Lagging span above cloud (still bearish):**

We also want the lagging span to sit above the cloud: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/KnQIflLk/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/KnQIflLk/)

**Edit:** Also, flags sloping in the wrong direction has been Bart material recently: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/Wxp8qcF6/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Wxp8qcF6/)

Stay safe!
Okay so the tweet from BITHUMBs twitter about the 30m hack has been deleted.

No mention of it now, just that they are moving the coins to cold storage while they upgrade their database.
I must agree that TA shows a clear bear pennant, however I feel we might move sideways a bit longer and a gentle breakout upwards. I expected more selling on the FUD of today.

Rejected from 6.8k 3 times. Finding it unbeliveable this is still hanging up there.
i think this is starting to reverse

1. we've been going down on the daily non stop for more than a month now...on the daily the RSI hit 26(this has been the lowest its been for a few years now. Usually after a bottom gets hit on the RSI the price reverses and starts going up again
2. an exchange got hacked for $30 mil and the price only went down 3% and we barted back up within 24 hours
3.  tether good news came out that should serve as a catalyst to get through the resistance.

Note, I'm not saying this goes to $20,000 now. What I'm saying is that we are due to revisit $7,500 and $8,500 or so to test that support line turned resistance. 
Daily TA Tripe from moi... not that these days it's likely to mean anything

- My biggest worry for Bitcoin is now the weekly Ichimoku Cloud. On Bitstamp if we remain at this price for another 2 weeks, we will be under the weekly cloud for the 1st time since November 2015.

Even worse than that, the last weekly cross under occurred in August 2014. We then remained under for around 15 months... so be warned. For me dropping under the weekly cloud here has potential to spell a very prolonged period of downside easily stretching this whole year and maybe more. 

- If we fell like a stone this week the current weekly Ichimoku Cloud support rests at about 5370

- If we fell hard next week the weekly cloud support would be at 6400 ish

- We are currently holding on in and around the 1 hour Ichimoku Cloud Kijun Line sitting at 6610 (Binance)

- 4 hour cloud resistance currently sits above us at the 6700 area, that's going to be a tough one to crack I think

- 4hour MACD looks to be crossing to the negative

- There could be a hidden bullish divergence on the 1 hour RSI but i'm not really sure about that one, we'll see

- Volume still low, actually dropping now on the 4 hour and hourly

$$$The figure now for me to feel that the bear market is done is now around 9400, this puts us above the ATH trend line and the Ichimoku Daily cloud.

### 1 Day

* https://www.tradingview.com/x/z5jf3KMe/
* https://www.tradingview.com/x/uzb13fc1/

BBand %B and BBand width as a percentage of closing price both seem to be leveling off. RSI is recovering from near historic lows. Shorts and longs are dropping. 

The 1 day chart seems to be set up for consolidation or distribution.

### 3 Day

* https://www.tradingview.com/x/s17NgFgk/

BBand %B and BBand width as a percentage of closing price are both going up. RSI is hover near historic lows. Shorts are increasing and longs are dropping. 

The 3 day chart seems to be set up for bullish movement.

### Weekly

* https://www.tradingview.com/x/43ViToYu/

BBand %B and BBand width as a percentage of closing price are both sideways or descending. RSI is  middling. Shorts and longs are increasing. 

The weekly chart seems to be set up for consolidation or distribution.

The thing about buying the dip is, if you keep doing it then one day you will eventually catch the knife 
Anyone knows what was actually stolen, btc or alts?

Will be looking to re-short over 6750 again if we can get another FOMO leg here. 
Apparently Charlie Lee is about to get on CNBC and talk about what crypto's about to go to the Moon 
*Yesterday* wasn't profitable. *Today* I am in profit. *Tomorrow* is another day, trading will be as usual. There is no need to stick around with this trade for long, thus, I have closed it and decided to take the profit.  

!long BTCUSD close 6764
good luck 'bitcoin short'ers:

**Takeaways**

In the face of some recent coverage, we have stood by the fact that all circulating USD Tethers are backed by USD reserves, and we are pleased to be able to present independent verification of this. We are by no means finished with our transparency efforts at Tether. However, it is our hope that this report helps address concerns whilst we continue to discuss these issues with potential assurance advisors.

Good Morning, 

Currently in a small short at 6800 from the last push up.  BTC working on wave 5 of primary wave C.  Laddered my short entries within my red box and around the top of the ascending wedge just in case btc tries to get cheeky and wick through. 

Open for criticism and critique. 

Enjoy your day everyone and good luck.  Stick to your stop losses :) 
Short update on [my cloud checklist from earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8sfbjm/daily_discussion_wednesday_june_20_2018/e0zoa03/); we just got a bullish Tenkan/Kijun (TK) cross on the 4H chart, which means that 2 out of 4 signals are now bullish. I would wait for all 4 signals to turn bullish before closing my hedge that I'm holding from around 6600 (i.e. going 1x long).

TK cross: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/AbaGHTi4/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/AbaGHTi4/)
Market doesn't seem to care too much about the Bithumb hack, had expected this to cause a bit more hysteria
Can someone please tell me wtf is going on?????  I’ve been panicking and fomoing back and forth and cannot for the life of me make the right decision.  The smartest people on this sub are saying wildly different things.  Are we going to 2k or 20k goddamnit???!!  Should I just go all in and hold?  I was doing so damn good during the bear buying/selling inversely to the barts.  I was out of position with my finger on the trigger to buy when the goddamn sec decided to shove a huge green dildo in my ass because I was too slow with the draw.  Why do I feel like we hit bottom already and I’m about to get drilled out of position?  
I didnt think id ever say this but i believe this was the tether news pump. Supposedly backed 1:1 but i still think they're fishy.  Bias?

Sounds pretty solid tbf, law firm was founded by three former federal judges, one of them a former director of the FBI, Louis Freeh. they seem to have followed decent procedure by not telling tether when they'd be checking their accounts but tether couldve just temporarily put their money together and then gone and asked the law firm to verify them.

> "To prevent any gaming of the process, FSS chose the date for which it would confirm its client's balances at the two banks "without prior notice to or consultation with Tether," the report goes on. The law firm got sworn and notarized statements of the balances from the bankers. "

this one made me laugh:

>"The law firm stressed that its confirmations should not be mistaken for an audit and were not conducted following generally accepted auditing or accounting standards. And it "makes no representation regarding the sufficiency of the information provided to FSS," noting that it all came from Tether and its bankers. "

>" "FSS has not performed any procedures or made any conclusions for activity prior to or subsequent to June 1st, 2018, Close of Business," the firm says in its report."

From what I understand, they got a snapshot of their accounts in two institutions on 1st June 2018.

I'd still rather stick my dick in a blender that touch tether. They veirifed their funds on one day. Its like when birds take an hour to set up for an insta pic. They clean up their accounts and ask the law firm to verify them. 

Now they can go back to doing fuck knows what. I still wouldn’t be surprised if some crazy retarded shit comes out about tether saying they share accounts with finex and keep partial reserves but all in crypto or some other insane crap

edit: sorry forgot source

https://www.coindesk.com/tether-review-claims-crypto-asset-fully-backed-theres-catch/

edit2: also, if report was done 1st june, why publich 19 days later?
*Correct me if I am wrong,* but it seems like ETH is leading this pump and just hit $540+ before rebounding and is now going back there. At this speed, it won't take long for BTC to hit $6,850.. 
What if we were at the bottom of the cup of a massive cup and handle?
Last leg up was a nice 5.86&#37; from the low of $6449 of the 2h candle corresponding to the leg up. I'm hoping we see a similar leg up within the next few days, that breaches $7k, to $7120 more or less.. 

Personally, I think that it's important that we not spend too long below $7k, to not slip into a bear market. I don't know if that makes sense, but I think it would be bad news for bulls if the price spends too much time close to the base $6000 support that was set near the beginning of this year. It would like... some kind of indicator? I dunno.

Bullish


Another payday and another 20% of my check goes into Btc. I'd like to put more than 20% at these prices but unfortunately I still need worthless fiat for certain expenses.
I wanted to say that there's a pretty good battle going on where I have my downtrend line drawn from $10k...but volume makes it look more like buyers & sellers slap-fighting.  

4hr candle closing soon, maybe that spurs some action one way or the other...

You’ve gotta be kidding me.  I got a little panicky and set a sell order this morning at break even.  Got on a conference call and said to myself....  ehhh, should probably cancel this and reevaluate after the call.  Sure thing I left it and it pumps right through me.  Fml
Ignore all the price movements. I'm gonna stick to my original fking plan this time.

Shorting in the blue areas, SL in the red area.

Red rectangle indicates possible similarity

Broke: Ethereum is not a security 

Woke: Ethereum has no security 
Short 50% of stack from $6735. 

Seeing a lot of similarities to the $7000 range 

Charts a little messy, but you get the point

https://www.tradingview.com/x/acOZ2CKY/

Will add other 50% of stack just over red line. Will bail over red line or 7k depending on the steam of he pump. 
Got a short filled at 6815. There's already a potential bear div on the 4hr starting to form and I think this bounce is mostly out of fuel. The main bullish scenario i am considering is if this forms a triangle and the breaks out to the upside (illustrated in the chart), will close my short if I see that happen. Otherwise, I am actually going to add more if this keeps grinding higher without proper consolidation. Will also add more if it forms a triangle and then breaks down.

I don't like the price action of btc in the context of alts.  It seems like it's getting pumped up here but alts aren't really moving up with it.  There is weakness that I can't really identify the reason for and it feels propped up.  I think we revisit the 6300-6400 level again.
Institutional dollars rushing in to buy from the Wild West Bank robbery circus show...

How much does constant hacking and fraud have to be tempered for casual investors to say, “Hey, this does act like a store of gold!” Is there any historical precedent to reference for this?

Until we reach that point crypto will have a major market cap handicap. 
Still waiting for Bogdanoff to keep "dahmping".

$6.5k looks to be the next leg down where BTC may consolidate for a moment.

Doesn't it look like there's a bear flag on the Daily?

Ok let's see how strong the bulls are here, 

- Next target, the top of the 4 hour Ichimoku Cloud sitting at 6960(Binance)

That would be interesting at least. I'm still of the opinion that a retest of 7k is the best case scenario that we'll see. Would be delighted to see a push through 7k and onwards but have to be realistic. 

Also, anyone else seeing the 1 hour bearish divergence on the RSI and the MACD?? taken from yesterdays high price at 3PM UCT to now... it's very pronounced on the MACD.

Reason for the pump

https://twitter.com/crypto/status/1009425999430373386

Don't we have fun here!!
Wow this is just a damn real stupid market to trade. I mean wtf
The bulls are defending each daily open from the bears and slowly grinding up. Furthermore, the volume is not insignificant. They are probably exhausting sellers right under the 12day EMA before breaking it.

https://imgur.com/a/WxEls7W

I have closed my short positions as I now strongly believe we will be testing resistances in the following week.
Gotta admit the daily looks pretty bullish with 3 straight green days and a green dragonfly doji today. Eth even strung almost 5 green daily candles. I'm rooting for the bulls to push through this - the opportunity is right there in front of you.  The onus is on the buyers here, don't drop the ball with the goal just in front of you!
The hack is irrelevant. We were already [in a bear flag](https://www.tradingview.com/x/YHCoU1O7/) anyways.

Sometimes I feel like the media pushes these stories to distract from what’s *really* happening with price/fundamentals.

There just simply isn’t wide-ranging public interest right now. We’ll go much, much lower in my opinion. I’m STILL calling for $4k (have been since violation of parabolic advance in December). Probably even lower.
Serious warning guys: Don't get raped by Bitcoin in the next few days. I sense that volume is slowly coming back to the market. And this can literally go both ways. It can go one way and then the next moment it violently turns around.

Fortunes have been destroyed in market conditions like this.
Very little resistance if we start moving back up here. 
Here's the ascending wedge that I'm looking at: [https://imgur.com/a/qJ5nu9e](https://imgur.com/a/qJ5nu9e)  

Three points of contact on the upper resistance and four points of contact on the lower support line.

Entering a long on an upside break, which currently looks like 6850 which would also top the last local high of 6830.  But I'd also considering buying at the bottom of the wedge around 6515 with a tight stop loss in case the wedge breaks.
This seems like a reaction to the Review (note not Audit) Freeh Sporkin & Sullivan LLP released Today about Tether...

Again, instead of having a full audit done by a third party accounting firm they went this way.

I have a noobish question.

Has BTC been historically characterized by its high trading volume?

I keep reading complaints about volume this and low volume that.

Are we in a new low volume era that has every trader pissed?
Before the breakout I had all-ined at 6420 with alts and BTC. I had such a great entry that I could afford to hold my position at 6700s, expecting one more leg up

Well, today after the hack news broke out, I sold my alts at negative Bithumb premium(yes.. I use that fkin exchange..) and made basically nothing. My 3~4k profit just evaporated due to some hacking load of BS

It's times like these that I become negative and regret in hindsight why I didnt sell. If BTC had made another leg up instead, I probably would have drawn the different conclusion that the big breakout at 6400 was an obvious strong signal and that I made a fantastic call. Sorry.. a bit of rant before I get to bed
If you believe news moves the price and you think it is bullish that the exchange hack news only dumped the price by $200, by the same logic you must find it bearish that the tether news only pumped the price by $200.
https://tether.to/fss-report-transparency-update/

Looks like tether is backed by USD.

Seems like the last 2 pieces of FUD (BIS & BITHUMB) didn't affect the market like the manipulators thought they would.

If the report is true then Tether have known they were fine all along, maybe they were just sitting on this info until the right time to give us that extra push up when the FUD wasn't bringing us down.

Just my 2 cents. 
So what is one thing we can say for sure about Bitcoin? 

It does not comply with the rules. For this reason, textbook TA is likely to get you slaughtered beyond a few basic formations (rounded bottoms indicating impending upswings, flat periods indicating impending reversals, and so on).

What else do we know? It has gone from an idea to a 100 billion market cap in nine years. No company can say that. Not Facebook. Not Apple. Not Exxon.

So do you really want to short this? 

I'm sincerely trying to help normal people break free of debt slavery. You get three chances in life. Most people don't take any of them. Take this one. Don't listen to the sockpuppet no-coiner losers trying to separate you from your Bitcoin. Fortune favors the bold. It did me.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/k8awk7H9/

Short here, teeny tiny profit atm but still holding. Watching that resistance.

Also rejecting EMAs on most time frames (i use 12, 26 and 50)

Think we're ready for another leg down, if it happens then ill start closing my short and fishing longs in 5800-5600 region.
[My plan](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ronjo/daily_discussion_sunday_june_17_2018/e0tr6t8/) is working out nicely: reload the exact same Korean exchange hack FUD, dump it $250 to pick up shorts, then reload the exact same Tether is solvent FUD, pump it $300 to trap said shorts, then chop sideways for a week to capitalize on high funding rates. Then dump it. Or maybe pump it to $7k to trap bulls, then dump it. My how sadistic market makers are...
I wonder how old everyone in this sub is...

inverse bart today, micro wyckoff accumulation cycle nearing the end of phase C inside of a macro wyckoff accumulation cycle nearing the end of phase C.

definitely too early to say we are reversing and going bullish again.  but this could potentially be a signal that looks incredibly obvious 6 months from now when looking back in hindsight.

[deleted]
Lost 12.3% of my total crypto holdings on bitmex today due to an underwater short. 

In order to DCA I shorted again at 6640 right before the BGD which made it even worse.

How do you deal with stupid decisions? 
Wow, goes up 200 bucks and suddenly you all have a case of bull flu?

I think we can have the same dicussion again. The one half will see a triangle and the other half will see a ascending wedge: [https://ibb.co/mPozZd](https://ibb.co/mPozZd)
What is the usual positive ROE you close a position for?
For what do you aim to make it worth your time?
There's no stopping these bulls. They're stampeding into $6800 zone now.. 
From what I've seen over the last 6 months, bears and short sellers are all experts at using technical analysis to find reasons why a bull market is never happening or going to happen again.  

The lower the price goes the higher the probability that it is the bottom.  What bothers me about bears is that they will argue against common sense just to get their way.  They will say the sky is black even if they know it to be blue.  It might not be today, but it will be fun to see the market go up and their tactics not working anymore.
I sure hope this is the lil nigga backing up so he can jump across the mufckin creek...
[4hr Ichimoku (double) on point like usual](https://www.tradingview.com/x/XAM0XqGY).

Arrows:

Green: Cloud rejected the BGD at 6800

Orange: Senkou Span A moved down to 6700 

Yellow: (almost) test of the Kijun

White: Kijun moves downward to 6700

Purple: Kijun collides with price and is rejected

Bithumb must be manipulating Ichimoku.


I'm thinking about opening a long from 6650 with 10x margin. I think they'll try to push it down but this zone is the maximum they can go. After that, I think they'll shoot right above 7k. My limit buy might not even trigger, but we'll see. I'll think about this on the way home..
New 24h high. Stamp and finex.

Up to the  3 day high.!
I walk away for 24 hours and nothing has happened. Maybe a couple failed Barts so bullish. Still happy to be long from 6600.

Go outside and enjoy life. Bitcoin will do its thing. No need to sacrifice all the good stuff in this life to watch candles on a screen.
Bitcoin's up 2.76 percent since yesterday. How's your IRA looking?
https://imgur.com/a/2dndSo3
I have drawn this wedge before last spike, but more or less it is still valid (I could not get more points of contact with resistance). So, the question is how this formation would play out? genuine question!
I feel like there are fair amount of chances that we might break into our old triangle at some stage (yeah, it is too early, but possible). What would that mean?

Ask yourself honestly: Do you really want to short this? Then go long with a little (5x max) leverage and wait a day/week/month until you're richer.
so the sunny tether news came out as I expected but disappointed its just a rehash of the sunny news that came out September 30 and not much value.


[deleted]
Glad I'm sticking to the short strategy. Nothing but bad news going to dominate for a long time. Tether, hacks, ln failure, other coins innovating and developing leaps and bounds ahead and gaining more and more adoption. What kind of informed investor/trader will do anything but short? Predicting more downside. No more hopium to smoke.
On good news every sucker on the planet buys.  
That is good time for smart money to sell to the level where suckers close leveraged long with loss.  
Then bad news arrive and these suckers will try to recoup losses by opening leveraged short.  
This time smart money will buy to the level where suckers close leveraged short with loss.  

BTC will settle below $1,000 and stay there for an extended period of time. Once the market pushes out 70% of the players then it will rebound. We have a lot more pain to go through, so much more than most of you realize. If were heavy into BTC back in 2012 like I was you would agree with me. This has all happened, look at the history if you want to know the future.

Since the BTC/USD market is very boring now, what do you guys think about XRP/BTC? I am shorting it from 0.000086. Not like ETH/BTC, the XRP trend is very clear, or it pumps to moon or it crashes to hell. Last time XRP/BTC drop 95% from the top. It already down 65% at this moment, can it crash more?

Well said sir, and I don't think it was too long, given its quality content. I agree with 95% of what you wrote above and all noobs should take the 90 seconds to fully read. 

I guess that I have not noticed an uptick in "The militant tribalism on both sides has ticked up a notch as well." But maybe that is just me having been around for a year and able to separate the noise from the quality. I mean compared to the shit last year with spiral of death, UASF, SegWit, etc., this stuff seems pretty tame, IMO.

Nice breakdown of ways to acquiring more BTC, shorts softening lands and the such, should be obvious, but you are probably right that it needs to be spelled out.
Wish i could upvote this more than once. Very well written.
If it makes anyone else feel better this is where I come to read about reasonable trade discussions on both sides, vs. r/ethtrader where I usually post and boy, do they not like hearing the dreaded "s" word (short). 
> Shorters actually soften the landing on dumps with profit-taking (a la buys) and accelerate bull runs with stop losses. It's counter-intuitive, but it's reality.

Thanks for this little hidden nugget, I never looked at shorting from this perspective.


Excellent post as always, thank you. 
Great write up.
Great write up for anybody new to trading or even the old chaps looking to sharpen their trading. It is covering almost all contexts, How to trade Bitcoin, Its Price, Positions and reddiquettes of this sub. 

I think the ability to adapt in this market is crucial, i.e., changing positions. One can not always make profit going long and vice versa. We need to continuously adapt to the changing needs/demands of the market.

I always acquire new knowledge by reading your posts, cheers!
> The militant tribalism on both sides has ticked up a notch as well.

I'd say the tribalism isn't between bulls and bears but between traders who follow the trend and permabulls who ignore the trend. We've gone from 20k to 6k and during this entire time bearish posts got downvoted. Then some people get tired and quality deteriorates.
TLDR...?
> I have never closed a position within seconds that close to a huge move before.

I can feel the adrenaline pumping lol.
Always pull out at the last second! Wait.. I am on the wrong sub. Accidentally relevant comment!

sell signal.
I don't know, do people really get that annoyed when people walk the walk? 

I'll admit I get annoyed when people make ridiculous proclamations with zero skin in the game, but unless someone is being a complete twat about an actual position they have open I usually don't see much bitching.

Side Note: It's kind of easy to SAY you have a position open, so unless the person is a quality poster I take it with enough salt to kill a man.
I'd rather that than people bring in drama from other subs.
I expect this pump news to die off. Similar to every single pump news that bitcoin ever experiences 
Well, about a week ago after the drop, the theory was "let it stabilize, go up to about 6800, add to short, wait for next leg down. Signal is when people start talking about hey maybe its not gonna drop this time".

Might be a good time to remember that plan. 
Keep watching

Back to stable up.
This is good for Bitcoin
I find the coin is still a fairly inefficient market and news takes about 12 to 24 hours to get around.

So while I agree the market took it quite well so far it may still not be over
6 coin's gonna 6.  That's how they do.


I thought you would come back with a long for the reversal :)
Seems like it's not just yet.

Welcome back! 
Risky chewtoy. 
Before hack news we passed 6700 and touched 6800. 
Let's see.
Whats your current sentiment on the market?
Thought I'd answer my own question by doing more research as either I'm asking something complex or I'm asking something too simple.

Source: [Here](http://www.aaii.com/journal/article/using-triangle-patterns-to-determine-price-movement.touch)

> *A typical rule of thumb for calculating a price target is to base it on the height of the triangle at its widest point—the vertical distance between the two trend-lines.* 

Everything I've searched up says that we should theoretically subtract the widest point... But that's 14k. We can't go below zero, so I see two possibilities:

* Invalid formation;
* Price target calculated on a shorter time frame.

Can't see a descending triangle on a shorter time-frame without incurring the same problem. The &#37; decrease in the value of BTC versus conventional stocks (where a few &#37; is a big move) seems to invalidate the ability to draw a sensible price target. If you did it on a &#37; graph you could say we'd drop 70&#37; from current position, but honestly, 2k would be an insane price target.

tl;dr: Can't seem to realistically use a descending triangle to make a price target prediction right now because the &#37; drop invalidates the conventional way to draw it.
Patience... sometimes will help?
I was just wondering if you kept your long opened after the fuckery yesterday.  I had a feeling that it will jump back up after the Bithumb news sort of resolved itself.  As I said, I'm always cheering longs and yours is pretty ballsy, lol.

edit: ah just saw your edit.  Good luck on this new trade then!
Hey man, its looking rather good. If I were you I would put stop ahead of -1% from yesterday, either ways, all the best. My long from yesterday also got stopped at about -0.5%, though I got a better entry today. Cheers!
identical close half of my long (too tight), under the same conditions, I thought you were closing at 6200
I like the titles of your charts. “Pump it”, “dump it”, “hedge it”. You should do “bop it” next. 
I really dig your charts but you really hate write ups huh?
https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8qbln5/moon_math_update_noob_dca_strategy_second_edition
for long term hold - yes

for short term hold - no
There is definitely an argument to be made that we aren't quite there yet, but I think that's a little greedy, especially for a 2+ year hold strategy.

Anything under 8k for me is buy territory, but I'll be going with a much more aggressive buy plan below 5k. 

Good luck.
Simply a result of declining volume and the ability to trade BTCUSD with high leverage. 
In my opinion its a combination of higher prices, and also the fact that bitcoin is more spread out between more people/exchanges. It takes a kind of coordinated effort to move the price up or down.. causing up/down spikes. bitcoin's bull/bear markets have also been becoming longer and longer with each 'bubble',maybe having the effect of  stretching out price action? I remember those kind of patterns being noticable a few years ago on the shorter time frame charts like 5 minutes.

As declared some days ago, I fomoed in on the green volume spike triggered by the SEC news. Now, that pump was 'real' buying and news-driven but was eaten up by profit taking over night. That was a red flag imo. Now we're back to chopping/barting and I'm back in fiat until we break daily EMA12 with conviction or continue ze dump. 
Or... 

Bear Flag

Ascending Channel

Ascending Wedge

Ascending Triangle 

Reversal Ascending triangle 

Bart Flag 

##CHOP 
not sure exactly what your looking at but a move down so price can continue the chop and then reverse up.
Most users here use the Logarithmic scale. That changes things quite a bit.

On log scale we are above that [trend line](https://imgur.com/a/VEdIz4a).
You made a valid line as long as no candle bodies have closed above it. Most people connect their linear ATH line to the peaks on jan 6 and feb 20th. There were very nice reactions to that line. You can also draw the line on log scale in which case it connects to the peaks on jan 6th and march 5th, again very nice reactions to the line.

lol, this doesn't look right for some reason...
Don't pay too much attention to sloping meme lines as support or resistance is a good basic TA lesson
Good eye. 
If it completes we should see a target of between $6000-6200
I had a bear flag but same thing. Amirite?
That descending channel is more of a megaphone if you're even a little strict about wick chopping. That seems to agree with your conclusion, so not a big deal.

All the alts look like they're about to fall off a cliff. BTC seems to be humming along at an ideal price point. 

Welcome home. Remember how we drew our TA with screenshots from Bitcoinwisdom using gimp? Those were the days. 
I was a very small hack tho.
6th largest ? wow times change, this time around last year i believe it was the largest?
Fact
Correct
> stoch rsi and macd has now started turning downwards for 2h, 3h, 4h, 6h,

That's all pretty choppy AF, I wouldn't be giving it too much weight on the lower time frames. Those indicators are disagreeing with one another quite a bit. The 2HR STOCHRSI says buy for example. Anyone trading the 4HR/6HR the past few days would have gotten rekt most likely. STOCHRSI is one of my great loves but one shouldn't take it too literally, more of a guide, it seems like you quite like it too. The 1D looks like a pretty solid buy to me, there is a good chance we push back down to 64XX briefly but regardless, will be back at 67XX+ later in the week for sure. 

Also the 3D RSI & STOCHRSI... Looks very much like a bottom. 

ps I think that news is random noise, isn't going to change much, 30,000,000 USD? Who gives a shit. 

pps I'm long @ 6556.5 for what it's worth 
My alts didn’t budge 

Kinda upset on the inside 
Good notice. 
I didn't notice this. Seriously. Thanks for pointing it out.
Thank you for posting this. I've been dipping my toes into interpreting clouds, and that analysis was really, really helpful!

Ya, however it is still on their news website 
http://bithumb.cafe/archives/33189
They also said that withdrawals will have to be regulated. Anywhere from meh to potentially disastrous.

Refgulated withdrawals doesn't really sound good 
from what i understand each "attack" at resistance/support weakens it as it soaks up some orders but could be very wrong on that.

wouldnt surprise me if we break through on next attempt
Patience 
I think the reasoning you gave are all reasonable.  But given the technical target of the meme consolidation triangle breakdown is around 4.5k, you think we'd reverse so quickly (it's only been less than 2 weeks since the breakdown)?  Serious question, not a real bear or anything.
Im not so sure about positive fundamentals at this time. The ETH and BTC not being securities (we already knew BTC wasnt) in my opinion was bigger news than both 2 and 3 and didnt move the market. BTW not saying your wrong just not too sure how the news is going to factor into that.
Nice insight.  Thanks
it really depends on your settings. with default ichimoku cloud settings we are below the cloud for 1 week already. should drop like a stone after a brief recovery.
>why people invest in ICOs

https://moonmath.win/ ?
Unless you run out of fiat before the market runs out of dips 
What if you've been buying the dip since 20k though? Not that practical in that sense 
Buying the dip only works in bull markets. Unless you're looking to scalp a bounce here and there.
Buying the dips is a good strategy in a **bull market**. Now there are speculators buying into what they may perceive as a temporary local bottom, and big players that want to support the price. There is no indication in long term timeframes of an imminent reversal. (Of course you never know).  


As for catching the knife, you may lose a finger or two each time. Thanks but no thanks...
Erm. No. Buy the bottom :) 
Hopium.

Fantastic news. All these bitfinexed idiots have been proven wrong once and for all.
I refused to believe it until there was good evidence to the contrary. I'm very, very glad to have been wrong. 
It’s not definitive since it was produced by a law firm as opposed to an auditing firm but I suppose it’s better than nothing ha 

The end of the article sums it up perfectly, "99 percent of the work a law firm does is advocacy for the client," whereas "100 percent of the work of an accounting firm is to hold themselves out as independent," 
seems like coindesk is running  miner on my computer when I open their webpage, or why is my cpu going up to 60&#37; use, when I have this webpage open?
' Immediately after announcing the hack, Bithumb confirmed it will pay back victims using its own reserves. '

Fair do's
Is a price rise on decreasing volume also considered bullish? Asking for a friend 
That's a bearish cross. [Pic for ref.](http://www.kumotrader.com/ichimoku_wiki/images/a/ab/Ts-ks_cross.gif)

> The signal for this strategy is given when the tenkan sen crosses over the kijun sen. If the tenkan sen crosses above the kijun sen, then it is a bullish signal. Likewise, if the tenkan sen crosses below the kijun sen, then that is a bearish signal.
http://www.kumotrader.com/ichimoku_wiki/index.php?title=Ichimoku_trading_strategies

You have them backwards. You want the fast span Tenkan (red) to cross over the slow span Kijun (blue).

EDIT: More examples of TK cross, red arrow bearish crosses, blue arrow bullish cross. 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/ouSBeMWb/
it is a pretty small hack and looks like no customers will lose money, so it's kinda irrelevant.
I think hacks of that scale are not so important right now. This is not 2014. Risk is spread out. 
We'll see the impact when this bear flag breaks down?
Sounds like you are overtrading my man. Make a plan and stick to it. Make YOUR OWN plan. 

Dont trade by blindly following what others are saying here, but by digesting what everyone here has to say and drawing your own conclusions.
Chill out... we are just moving sideways in a bear pennant. Direction is not clear yet... probably another tick down and up and down and up within the pennant before a final beak-out up/down.

If you are purely in fiat, just buy some BTC on the side to give you peace of mind. Then go enjoy the summer.
Buy high, sell low.

Works for me.
> I’ve been panicking and fomoing back and forth

You're overtrading. Relax. Take a day off.
If serious, don’t trade.

Trading is gambling with a slight edge (some believe).

No one knows what will happen.
Just hold
This is my take - people are pissed off.  That's why we're seeing no new money coming into the market.  I really don't care if I get flagged/down voted because this is the truth.  I've been here since late 2016.  Every single time I see a green candle abruptly spike up for no apparent reason, there's always a sell trend down shortly after.  The tech behind this is good.. at the same time there are so many institutional investors/people who have accumulated a huge amount of coin previously trying to turn this into a scam.  They invest a ton of money for no apparent reason, retail buyers will FOMO in, then the dump happens leaving a lot of bag-holders/pissed off people who will likely never return.  I can rattle off SO many examples of where this has happened - i.e. look at ENJ.  There was some binance "competition" where you're entered into a drawing for 10,000 ENJ coins if you have bought 10,000 or more coins.  Shortly before midnight, a large chunk of that coin was bought up and then the competition was announced shortly after midnight.  ENJ spiked like crazy and like a broken record, it got dumped like crazy right in the middle of this "competition" for no apparent reason.  Personally, I don't give a shit.  I've sold off all my cryptos a couple months ago.  It cracks me up looking at these charts and seeing all these pump/dumps happen like clockwork.    


What caused the spike in early 2017 was not Bitcoin - it was Ethereum.  People were getting so excited about the Flippening happening and all this new, exciting technology.  My co-workers were talking me into it saying big companies like Microsoft or whatever were investing in Ethereum.  The tech created all this interest and along came a lot of people with big pockets who wanted to abuse this system, which caused Bitcoin/everything else to crash (yes, this was a crash, people).  Until some new game-changing tech comes out or there are practical use cases, people will be very skeptical and it's not looking good ATM.

> edit2: also, if report was done 1st june, why publich 19 days later?

FSS checking the balances for 1st june doesn't mean they send the finished report to tether on the same day. The report itself isn't dated.
Pretty telling of the low volume we've been experiencing that hitting $6850 would be anything newsworthy. 
Never assume youre in a cup and handle until its actually fully formed
This time around is the most time we've spent $6000-6800. Lots of time spent under April's low ($6450) so I think we already kind of did that

If you look at a 3d or weekly chart you can clearly see we're making lower lows in terms of candle closes 
It’s not definitive since it was produced by a law firm as opposed to an auditing firm but I suppose it’s better than nothing ha 

The end of the article sums it up perfectly, "99 percent of the work a law firm does is advocacy for the client," whereas "100 percent of the work of an accounting firm is to hold themselves out as independent," 
Well at least the whole “tether is gonna bring down the whole thing” narrative can finally be put to rest and everyone repeating the old narrative to spread uncertainty seen for what they are.
Just means we can finally tether up with no fear :)
Bullish? I suggest you actually read the article.

Again not an audit, but just someone looking at a bank account.
Hey man 20% of your paycheck is a considerable amount, trade safely.
Yes fiat is worthless in the sense that you can use it to by most anything, whereas you can use BTC to buy about nothing.
You're the nerd who everybody bullies but who will be everybody's boss in a few short years.
We'd have to be at $8k to be touching the same line on a log chart, so I'm not going to be getting overly excited.

[Last time we broke that resistance line from $10k we hobbled along before dropping below our previous low.](https://imgur.com/a/VDbzLyX)
Hopefully there are no sadistic MM's who like to browse here just to fuck over people's positions
We all have that plan dude Lol.
IMO the last sell limit should be your SL. If it gets that high it’s going higher. Can’t chart now but there’s a huge LVN from 6850s to 7000s. And a lot of shorts from higher might close, get stopped out. But you know, do your thing. 

One Coin to rule them all, One Coin to find them; One coin to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.

You saw the tether news, right? Just making sure brotha:

https://twitter.com/crypto/status/1009425999430373386
lol CG, you seem to be bullish, but then short it.  What gives? :-P
Be sure you have $$ to cover
Added to my DCA short at 6839, but gave most of it up during today's pump. No need to get underwater here. Will add again at 6899 which should average me at around 6810. Hard to see this getting seriously above 7000 before dumping hard again. 
> There is weakness that I can't really identify the reason for and it feels propped up.

The fact that the price is where it was yesterday before a $30 million exchange hack/theft definitely suggests that it is being artificially propped up right now.
Absolutely, but most here like to bury their heads in the sand and repeat the mantra "institutional money coming", wiling it on through collective positive thought. 
It does.
The Bogdanoff are at the police stations since yesterday. No DAMPING = Bull run confirmed.
Wow, 2015, the year many of the community gave up and most others stayed away.
Press /F to pay respect for 2009-2010 people!
2017 is top, interesting.  That would explain why the price went up in 2017. :)
I'm looking more at 7k2. Will be a good sign if we pass that. 

Later the 8k2 but that is next.
1hr? Are you really trading on anything less than 4hr?
Meh 30M is nothing. If it dumps its because it was gonna dump anyway
And that would be 126M USD today to put things in perspective with the 30M hack ;-)
The coins still haven't moved right? If I were the hacker I'd wait until onchain privacy is improved 
Depends on where you are camping, I'd position myself close enough to a water source that is within walking distance, but still far away enough to where the bugs won't bother you . And if you can, put your tent upwind from where everyone takes a shit. You'll be fine my dude
Go 100% fiat, use the fiat to buy some sheets of acid. Sell the acid at the festival and use the profits to buy back in when you get back.

Cash dude. Trust me from a fellow festival guy. Have fun at Forest!!!
Go 50% Fiat 50% btc, set limit buy and sells  +-$300 it will probably chop so much that both get filled
I don't think this will do much in a week. Up and down, but no clear trajectory. Go cash and have peace of mind.
What do you feel more comfortable holding long term?

That is the one you rest in.

Or, you could hedge and go 50/50.
Long with small leverage.
None of the above really cut it. And part 2 has a spelling error. GenEsis
Answer is E for both questions.
The news is on coindesk like 30 minutes ago and no pump until now. I doubt if it is the reason. But it is great news, we may see more Tether print and pump everything soon, lol.
It's a single player trying to induce fomo, you can only fool the market so much

Edit: oh I'm sorry, that giant 5 minute candle is totally just organic market buying 
You should know... welcome in crypto land
slow grind is bearish to me, daily dojis after a bounce is bearish to me, I have the weekly resistance level at 6815, nice rejections 3 days in a row. I have daily resistance at 7767, still have not closed a daily above it. Potential bearish divergences also forming on lower time frames like the 4 hour. I think r/r favors shorting 6800, can add more around 6900. Wide stops around 7100, target 5850.
Dude, a price rise on decreasing volume is in no way bullish
> slowly grinding up

That's usually a bad sign. Sometimes it's not. I hope it's not. But usually it is.
I'll raise 2 monthly reds in a row, which hasn't occurred for like 2 years
> Sometimes I feel like the media pushes these stories to distract from what’s really happening with price/fundamentals.
> 
> 

It's more like, something happened at all, so they can write about it. Same with "Why X dropped/up", people prefer irrational explantations over no explanation and they capitalize on this
The media is trying to distract the public from the fundamentals???  So this time the media is shielding everyone from the fact that BTC has no future by blaming a hack on it's price dump...  All other times the media just publishes fake FUD to try to crash the price.  Where do you guys come up with this stuff?
Nice catch, but the pattern need to be fully formed and break out first. At this moment it can still go either way.
Thanks for the advice, but I’ve already made and lost a fortune several times over :)
Seriously, if you had inside knowledge of the exchange hack announcement and sold/shorted while knowing that the tether report was coming out today to buy/long, how much money was made on this?

If Commerce Secretary Wilbur L. Ross Jr. is doing this same thing in regulated markets, imagine what people in the know are doing in bitcoin markets. Some peeps are getting rich AF. 
data to back up your "sense"? And perhaps refrain from using rape to describe people making precarious financial decisions. 
Why exactly? 
Ascending wedges break down though, not a signal for a long.
If you can’t trust a former director of the most advanced federal police force on the planet, who can you trust!? His firm’s conclusion carries a little more weight than some auditor with dubious investments.
It's just lower than the recent bubble is all.  2016 was really really low.  But we didn't have rich whales/institutions doing the same sort of games I guess.

Edit: and there were also far far fewer speculative traders creating feedback loops with those games.
The complaints about low volume are comparing it to the December January bubble. It's almost 3x what it was a year ago. 
I think a lot of people here make the mistake of comparing recent 24hr volume to past 24hr volume (I'm talking about volume from 3 years ago) which won't really tell you anything in terms of current price action.

I look at how volume changes percentage wise on a week to week basis to current price action.

For example, (I'm using ETH because that's what I mostly trade) the run up from 480 to 548 saw 24hr volume triple from where it was at, HOWEVER, it was still a little less than half the volume that accompanied the drop from 625.

Additionally, volume with the current price action has largely remained unchanged and does not seem to be picking up with the rise in price. 

So when I talk about low volume, I'm comparing it to what the weekly average has been 
It's all relative.  Seems roughly the same to me as the first half of last year. But no comparison to what it was during the last quarter of 2017, and it's  been steadily declining since February.
Volume in TA is always relative.
volume is low, but remember, the volume is likely diluted by the increasing number of exchanges and coins to trade.
Some exchange volume has undoubtedly been lost due to the China ban and South Korea crackdown.
Volume creates opportunity so people like it. Volume flow drops in a squeeze, and when it breaks it increases. Then it slows down again as the next squeeze/sideways movement starts. It shouldn't be to long until the volume flow begins increasing.
You protected capital, good on you, you should reward yourself for that. In fact, a good trader rewards him/herself even if the trade lost money but they did it because The Plan said so. In the long run, there are plenty of trade opportunities and you'll stay in the game, maybe even make some $
But that doesn't fit the narrative...
News doesn’t move the price. People’s perception of how others will react to the news is what moves the price. But trading news is a losing strategy because bullish news can cause dips if the public had higher expectations, and bearish news can cause rises if it’s not as bad as they thought.
If tether had been *fully vindicated*, and the market reacted with "only" a 3% pump, then I would agree. But that's not the case here. There is still clearly some doubt about Tether from people, and I'll bet you are one of them, no?
Why does it seem like everyone jumps to the "manipulation" conclusion. This meme is getting more tired than iH&S and "the 6th of the month".
That Tether is 'backed' by USD doesn't 'prove' anything:

- No professional audit
- Funds can be moved into accounts to cover the required period of time
- What is the sources of the funds

If you think this clears the issue up you are very wrong.
There is absolutely no conclusive proof in that transparency report that all USDT in circulation are backed by USD in Tether's bank accounts. This is not an audit in any way, shape, or form. 

Tether continues to fail to deliver on their promise that ["reserve holdings are published daily and subject to frequent professional audits"](https://archive.fo/9UMhd#selection-1187.0-1193.139).
The report looks legit and the lawfirm seems reputable (note: finance and legal is not my field of expertise).  That said, I'm still slightly skeptical - as in I believe it will be around awhile to help prop up the market until some major changes.
> It does not comply with the rules. For this reason, textbook TA is likely to get you slaughtered

Oh, the weekly "TA doesn't work for Bitcoin because it's special" post. Must be nearing a violent move
Market cap is not a meaningful indicator in an illiquid market with non-tangible assets.  I’m bullish BTC long term and HOLDers are likely to see a return if they buy at this price with a plan to hold for 5 years.  

But this is a trading forum ... all medium term indicators are pointing to this moving to the $5k - $3k range in the coming ~6 months. 

TA has been fantastic for mapping bitcoin. 
Didn't I say you'd have a chance to close at b/e or in the green? :P

Good thing you didn't "close now and open long"
Pump it to 8k then dump ;)

Usually follow it with a few more stupid decisions. Then I kick my dog.

Just kidding. I can’t afford a dog anymore due to aforementioned stupid decisions and if I could, certainly wouldn’t do it any harm. I often think the gambler is not the person who suffers, it’s those around them. Just like the drinker, junkie etc. I see this at the moment as gambling and those involved either have the ability to step back or not depending on duration in the market
Realizing you have no idea what you’re doing and putting your money in a safe place until this turns around. And drinking. 
I usually go away from the market for sometime when this happens.
> How do you deal with stupid decisions?

Drugs and alcohol, usually.
If i'm underwater i try not to add just because of what happened to you (been there many times already). Sometimes, in last resort i'll go all in a bit below the stops. 
For example, shorted 6500 and BTC went to 6600. I decided my stop loss will be 6700, so i only add around 6680 - 6690 (if it's not being hit by another dildo) and set stops @6705 for example.

This way, if my stop loss was well chosen, i added near the top maximizing my chances of breaking even or at least reduce losses. If my stops do get hit, i only lost a bit more (in fees and slippage).


http://www.gamblersanonymous.org/ga/ can help if you recognize that what you are doing is gambling (unless you are one of the tiny group of trading savants that aren't gambling).
After a losing trade, it’s a good idea to take a break from the market to clear you head and judgement.
Why you always short?
More of a bull sinus infection.

Exchange hack, only dumped to $6600.

Higher low on 4H. 

Making another strong attempt at $6800

Good reason to be a tad bit bullish 
Why does everyone always come in and say this, it is so transparent that you are worried about a $200 rise, which goes against your argument.
are suggesting the hacker used the *hidden* divergence to obfuscate his crime?
Exact same thing in 7k range.

It could also be an ascending channel

Depends on the trade and how much you're risking (margin, stops, liqs). But in general you should aim to profit at least as much as you stood to lose. I think.
Depends on time frame mostly.  These days, seems like unleveraged moves of 3%+ have been pretty good r/r.  Waiting for more has failed more times than its succeeded.  We are POSSIBLY at a turning point in the market though, so it's a decent time to hold out for bigger gains (if we break up for example).  Smart money will take the sure profit though, imo.

>The lower the price goes the higher the probability that it is the bottom.

:thinking:

>It might not be today, but it will be fun to see the market go up and their tactics not working anymore.

So you admit their tactics are working, but you're sticking to your unprofitable techniques. <3

>What bothers me about bears is that they will argue against common sense just to get their way.

Silly bears and their profits! Have they no sense!?
Sorry mate I think you got it all wrong. It's not that bears are shorting just to get it their way or they don't want the price to go up. They have a more clearer sense of grasp over the market than most other traders. They are also good at TA which is a good skill to have in your portfolio.

During the last bull run, longing was the choice of making money. But shortly afterwards, since the start of downtrend from ATH, shorting has been the choice of making money and anyone wanting to make money would do that.

Moreover, no one really cares if others are losing or winning, we all are trading to make money for ourselves not others. I would be really concerned really if I was getting bothered by bears.


You can say the same thing, but inverse, about perma bulls when we are hitting a peak.
I laughed
Agreed, everything was in the chart and shorted 6745, either buyers need a reload or we're headed to new lows but that pamp ran out of steam for now.
Okay but what's your reasoning? All I see is a bunch of "I think" statements 
 *"this zone is the maximum they can go"*   
"They" are probably the same ones causing the pumps, and causing the dumps. We had pretty nice amount of great news recently, except the Bithumb hack obviously, yet all the pumps have stopped at around \~6850. Using statements "They cant go lower / higher than XY price" are mostly always wrong.

In the range of 6960 - 7025 is probably good. We are still in the down channel.
Dude, you could have taken profits and still be in the same position, seems like you have found a good entry and you just want to stick to it for the sake of boasting rather than taking profits on it. I am just saying.. Stay happy.

Read it. Glad I did.
Another amusing tidbit for the "shorters hate bitcoin and want it to fail" crowd:

All else being equal, you actually make far more bitcoin shorting than you do longing. You make more fiat longing than you do shorting. 
The trend can be drawn from a year ago too.
You're correct, although the trend has reversed a number of times between 20K and 6K (depending on time frame). Alternatively, the multi-year trend is obviously up as well. I was being intentional not to just say it's perma*bulls*, because the "perma" part is what's dangerous and militant. But the majority of the last 6 months has been downward, and permabulls do *tend* to be more vocal in their ignorance.

Exactly! BTC will one day be back at the previous ATH around $20k. When, next week, December, 10 years from now, is the million dollar question.

I tend to disagree a bit, at least in the mid term since I expect this to be a fairly significant bit of info for media. This is of course contingent on them actually picking it up - and some might argue "no audit, no real news". However, considering how long this cloud has lingered over the market and how much attention it has gotten in the media before now (deservedly so), it makes sense to me that this will continue to trickle into the news cycle more than other, as you call it, "pump news".
papa bless
I'll gladly take a 7% haircut to my total BTC holdings if it means the bottom is in and there's going to be a strong reversal back above $7,000. 
Although it is still unclear about the hack (did it happen and how big the impact) it dampened any upward momentum for sure.  On the plus side, the news did not cause as big of a panic as it could have (we are still above the recent 6.1k support line).
That's good advice, Bucky. I was patient and held through all the drama until about 9:00 Pacific time, but I just wouldn't have been able to sleep with that position open so I closed for the small loss, sucks, but I can deal with a small loss due to a black swan event. (more like a black finch)
Haha thanks man, the tether "news" is rather interesting this morning, you see that?
my stops were actually going to be around $6,400 for this one (you might be thinking of my long that I had before this last one, so two back) but the "hack" was kind of a punch and I told myself if I had an opportunity to get out with less than a 1% loss I would take it
Thanks for the chuckle, Mr potatoes

Yeah, this is what you get with the BitMEX casino. 
If you could kindly educate me, do you know roughly how big of a position you need to move the market 100 bux or so?  Could it be just one or few person taking positions causing the bart?

I'd imagine like yesterday they'd sell due to news and then rebuy in with the tether news and saw that the market was steady.
That's how I initially read it; unless they had some sort of panic button that sent out batches to cold wallets and had a trigger that read *Adjust fee so as to be actioned with 'x' number of blocks* and it just fed back on itself?

If the process was poorly automated (and aren't all emergency measures till they're tested?) I can totally see this playing out.
source?
Hey mate don't really know the difference or which one is better to use, what do recommend? I will study later.

I see your line is touching ATH and 6 Jan. When I try to do it, the line goes [way below (blue line)](https://www.tradingview.com/x/cGd11jHb).
I just realized, your log line has different distance from what I understand and just read thus the line I below made is invalid, I think log is more significant so I will start with it. 
Good to see you post that because the trend breakout in May was my first signal that the downtrend was potentially broken. I just wasn't sure of the timing. As others pointed out, the same thing happened in the '14/'15 downtrend where it broke the downtrend line but then followed the top of it for quite some time and continued down close to Goblin Town.

What I was looking for was either a triple bottom or a fakeout break-down that went back up and closed above horizontal resistance at ~6400 (on the daily) which for me happened on Sunday, 6/17. At that point it was a fairly decent r/r in my opinion so I started scaling in. I'm awaiting some further dips to continue to DCA in or a break-down of 6k as a stop.

I do tend to trade on longer time frames though.
Cheers mate! Let me try drawing all of these at the same time.
Hah what is it bro?
Both *should* result in a breakdown so essentially yes, but technically they are different. 

I’m a little cautious with this one though since there’s only really two clean touches on the support line. 


Pretty much the same, wedge is probably less bearish of a pattern though. Needs another test of the support to really be a wedge or channel though. https://imgur.com/a/EdKck7J

Hey jarederaj, I am a big fan of you but I'll never understand Bitcoin absolutist statements like this.

Alts are not in a bubble any more than BTC is. 

Many alts have already corrected the the full amount to support. Many are down 90%+ and have completely lost ALL of their gains since November much more than Bitcoin has. 

Straight up scam shitcoins like EOS are still up, and overvalued, inflated artificially and will need to see a full correction but most alts have had their fair share of the correction.

Alts are not holding BTC back, in fact they are holding the price up and supporting the valuation of BTC. If BTC was in a vacuum, the price would have corrected much more than it has now. I'd wager BTC is holding alts back because most alts are already done their bubble cycle, at least on technical terms. Many are done their 78.6 Fibonacci retracement and many have gone beyond that...and many have not yet and have further to go...like Litecoin. 

Please show me how "alts are about to fall off a cliff". There's nothing to support this. We get one day of alts not following a 0.5% move up by Bitcoin and that's your conclusion? I'm pretty surprised to hear this from someone like you. Sure Litecoin can drop another 30-40% but that is not going to affect, say, ICX or ADA which are mostly done their respective corrections...in technical terms. 

The fact is, BTC will never see 50% dominance again and the alt market is further along in the market cycle than Bitcoin is. 

It is Bitcoin that needs a further correction, not alts. and it will drag alts down with it. The alt market is waiting for BTC to finish its correction as it is lagging behind.
Does it matter? People see Korean exchange and hack in proximity of each other within one new article and they panic sell. Because if they don't them koreans will beat them to it
nah I agree with you, people shorter term indicators on this stuff are wildin imo, this is total chop. The 4h is hardly even working anymore- we go sideways for *days* before shit begins to move. 
After getting stopped out (in profit) I went back to take a look at the 3D stoch rsi, and I have to say I really dig what I see. There were a couple of instances where it flat out gave you the wrong flag, but it had a lower degree of trades where I would have ended it in breakeven compared to lower timeframes. I'm going to set aside 10% of the stack and trade on that for a couple of months, see how it goes. Thanks for the tip!
I'm honestly not upset, I'm afraid of what a fomo cycle will do to them before a few fundamentals get cleared up first.
Maybe it is much worse, or they just made a mistake and there was no hack at all and the funds are still there.
That tweet about regulated withdrawals looks like it was from a fake twitter account.

"Bithumb support" isnt their actual twitter account. 
Withdrawals are not allowed for now
It can, but it certainly doesn't have to. Case in point: 9400

https://www.tradingview.com/x/fKIMdXOr/

We attempted it 6-8 times followed by catastrophic dumping. It's common that if it doesn't break on the 3rd attempt for it to ultimately fail. Also far from a guarantee though.
Yes, triangles are usually continuation patterns, and an ascending triangle with higher lows shows more control by bulls. It also means that the order books backing the upper resistance are under consistent buy pressure, and the breakout happens when they can no longer sustain the resistance. Of course it's never assured, and this is a particularly strong resistance, but I'm long and expect that we will break through.
Exactly. And this is a key resistance (12day EMA).

This played a major role in the market so far and it looks like it will break soon
you can also think of it like people run out of money/coin to blow through too though
is this the bottom? maybe, maybe not. 

but nothing goes down forever, sooner or later you get a bounce. 

so far its been a month of dumps followed by a month of pumps(that don't quite make it up to the old high) followed by another month of dumps that go even lower. We had about 6 weeks of dumps. So we are kinda due for some movement at this point.

I'm not saying it'll go all the way up to ATH, just that it'll go up to test resistance points.

so this could go up to $7500 and stop there or $8500 or even $9500 
Could be a fakeout on a longer timeframe. I'm with you though.
oh I'm not talking about fundamentals here, more of technical indicators indicating that a technical pump is due

we'll def need much more fundamentals than this to even think about going above $10K 
thanks, with all the noise on the lower timeframes my big fear is now that weekly cloud. I don't see how anyone can sugar coat that should we fall under it, first time since November 2015... that's just a real nightmare in my eyes. 

Hoping it acts as some serious support and that's the kick we need to break the bear market
I use the Ichimoku settings that most people use for Crypto, they differ from the standard 
I agree that it's probably mainly financial gains. That's exactly what we try to show (and this would also be an interesting finding). However, there is a bit more to it. I come from an entrepreneurial finance background, so the interesting question is whether and how venture's can use ICOs to get funding. IF investor's only want to get rich, the quality of the actual venture should not matter. IF that is the case (which can very well be true) good ventures should not use ICOs as they will not raise more money than bad ventures.

Also, I think there are different groups of investors. There will be some out there that do it for the tech. Getting a comprehensive sample is the tricky part here...
>Greed and FOMO

Isn't that the only reason anyone ever invests in anything?  Besides very isolated philanthropic cases, but even those usually have some sort of benefit to the person doing the investing (tax breaks, networking, PR, etc., so you are back to greed).
They have posted the message in several cryptocurrency subs.
You'd think I'd stop doing that already... Thanks, homie ;)
also, need the www in the address. Haven't got a wildcard cert set up yet.
Is that possible? Don't people have jobs?
Agreed. I bought the dip in Jan, in Feb, and again in April. I wasn’t doing it again. Not buying the dip and selling on the way down and rebuying at the bottom has been so much more effective financially. 

I preserve capital, and I end up with more bitcoin.  
[deleted]
How do you know it's the bottom bro?
Bithumb
I think less impact on BTC price if those were alts. 

The amount is negligible anyway, but psychology and media...
He's reacting to the market, and executing his version of risk management, and not getting married to a position.  Having any trade open at all is of course a gamble, but I don't think he is playing casino games here.

I'm sure he will after he buys back all his Litecoins.
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy 
Bear market could end tomorrow or in 3 years basically was all he said
Well, the report was produced by a law firm and is not an audit so...
Wait for them to actually pay, they removed the tweet again..
Hehe, absolutely not ;)

I don't see us ticking off the aforementioned checklist on low volume. Too much resistance at the top of the flat 4H cloud (between 6.9-7.0k).

At most, I would consider a bullish 4H cloud to be a neutral market, e.g. signal to close hedge / 1x long. I would only consider being proper bullish on 6H cloud signals which likely would not happen until 8k or so.
Usually on a hack (especially on an exchange the size of Bithumb) the effect is immediate and drastic. The fact we've lingered around and not done anything would lead me to believe any downside from here thats not really impulsive would be uncorrelated.
Overtrading. I was going to say the same. Take a step back, breathe, make a plan with calculated r/r and stick to it.

Also, don't ever trade on emotions.
That’s my strategy and I’m great at it.  Somehow I’m still not rich
FIAT
Man, he's asking a valid question. Not everyone in the world are long term holders, there are millions of traders of assets from stocks to commodities to crypto around the world, markets are moved through their transactions. A bunch of you were crying when the price was declining, so be nice or just shut up.
touche, fair enough
Yeah and the attempts are real strong mate. Could be in the news tomorrow at its best perhaps?! lol idk mate.
Not assuming anything, just wishful thinking. If I had more fiat I would be adding here for cold storage though.
Looks like a bear market to me, lower lows 

https://i.imgur.com/9YX25Pv.png
Hmm, I think we might be looking at the charts in different ways, you and I. I'm not taking it strickly by a candle-by-candle bases. Because I think we set a higher high at $6849 (later re-tested at $6848) and the higher low at $6560 (looking at Bitfinex, BTW). I'm waiting on confirmation for a subsequent higher high of significance within the next few days. The patterns have been sluggish at a price range this low, if memory serves right. So I'm not too strict on time frames for indicators to form. 

I wouldn't bet on a harsh drop from here. Is all I'm saying :) 
Now we can focus on the legitimate reasons to be bearish :P
lol, I'm trying to decide if this was /s or not.
They emphasized that throughout, and the firm contracted to have a look. 

By this point we'll probably never know whether USDT ever was a thin air machine, but on June 1st at least it was not. This is as good as it's going to get . 
> FSS, the Washington, D.C., law firm that Tether hired to assess its reserves and write the report [...] was founded by three former federal judges, one of them a former director of the FBI, Louis Freeh.

> To prevent any gaming of the process, FSS chose the date for which it would confirm its client's balances at the two banks "without prior notice to or consultation with Tether".

> The law firm got sworn and notarized statements of the balances from the bankers.

> Likewise, FSS didn't tell Tether the account balances it had received from the bank for June 1 when it asked the company for sworn statements certifying the amount of USDT outstanding on that date.

"*Just someone looking at a bank account*" doesn't appear as an appropriate summary of these proceedings. Except for an actual audit this is pretty much the best they could possibly do.
He is. He's just buying and HODLing. Nothing safer. Literally.
Give it 10 years.
Well, I am using a log chart, but like I said below, I really hate this trendline because of how differently you can draw that channel down from 10k.  
Muhaha
what do you mean? 
I'm just placing a high value to that black channel, and thinking there might be a temporary fake breakout of the meme triangle. Who knows? Maybe whales will absorb that liquidity from all the shorts closing and short the fuck out of it.
Do you even toke bro? 
Maybe you don’t know the definition of the word hint. 
Oh. 

Well then... positive tether news is always followed through by a pretty decent rise in price. 

Guess I could be getting that second add sooner than later lol 
Mostly because of the low volume/ similarities to the 7k range. 

Also longs are increasing/ shorts are decreasing, where it’s going to be way impossible for a mega short squeeze.

I just expect this news pump to die off. If you remember, in the 8k range tether pumped 200 mill and brought market up 300$ then the steam just died and here we are now 


"Propped up" and "accumulation" are the same thing, but with opposing motive attribution. 
Or it means crypto is maturing and realizes a $30 million hack isn't worth lighting your hair on fire over.
Minor piece of bad news in the exchange hack, minor piece of good news with the tether announcement, and we're back to where we were before either of them. 

What would lead you to conclude it's being propped up?
Check list for new ATH:

BTC works with LN or is treated purely as a store of value (or BTC will just choke with wide usage again). Alternative: another project takes the role of currency.

ETFs approved.

Tether sorted out.

Privacy coins - OK with ETFs or no?

Traditional market doesn’t take a dive, or somehow speculative asset miraculously acts like gold. 

Constant hacks dry up.

Rampant fraud put in check. 

Regulatory clarity, resolution on what is an ICO and what will be done about it. 

The clueless learn the importance of POW and decentralization, get wise to the scam of governance (aka introducing trust back into what is supposed to be trustless)

Please add to this list as you see fit!
No need, they have enough money ;-D press F for the december 2017 enter gang.
Yes.. It works well. Everyone uses different time scales oh mighty overlord 
The EMA26 on the 1 hour has been a pretty good guide. Look at the last three days as an example, a break above that has resulted in a good move up from there when trending below and a break below has resulted in a good size drop when trending above.

edit: "last"
This week the 1h has worked well. 
But what about bears?
Haha going to a music festival so all of the above are the least of my worries. 
Found the business wook. 
And save some lucy to do some charting. Mircodosing. Its all the rage right now.   My god imagine contemplating the moonmath rainbow chart... the mind baffles. 

edit: add DYOR
Great mind. 
Thanks man! Probably would be best for peace of mind but I'm addicted to dem gainz
Hmm not a bad idea. Sort of like a spread. Thanks for the input. 
I'm currently 60% tether, 20% btc, 10% ETH, and 10% ela. I think I'm comfortable enough with this no matter what happens
It may be a trick question.. I know absolutely nothing about masternodes 
No offence, but an increase of 100 and we call this a pump? Talking about inflation... 
Dont be silly its only manipulation when it goes down
Exchange hack selling = organic panic

Tether news buying = manipulation 
I agree. It is a difficult spot to chose sides. I went from bullish at 6400$ to bearish at 6700$ to bullish at 6700$. 

But I feel like something is brewing.  
I agree. But the way I see it is the "price rise" from 6300$ to 6700$  is just consolidation, not a bullish impulse. 

If we break the 12D EMA, volume will explode and now we will talk about price rise with increasing volume.

All about timeframes.

I just looked again at the daily and the volume is actually increasing. And we are now pushing for a green candle close for the day
It’s just an opinion of mine, Jeff. My point is, the timing is notable. We were already in a bear flag, price would have likely dropped.
If a bank is robbed... Dollar will also not fall
RemindMe! 2 days
[deleted]
That's why I'm waiting for a potential upward breakout to go long. Or buy at the bottom of the wedge and play within the wedge with a tight stop loss.
why do you need to trust anyone? if an audit is done correctly, it will usually come with balance sheets and verifiable documents that would prove the lightness.

IMHO, not choosing the simple and obvious way of doing an audit is not serving their case very well.
Lol; you must have not followed news at all this past year if you still think the FBI is some advanced or trustworthy organization.
Maybe in monthly volume, but I don't remember seeing minutes with literally 0 volume on many exchanges like it's happened.

Maybe in $ terms is higher, but I'm sure the volume/BTC price ratio is the lowest since at least 2015...
Well to be honest, looking at last years volume, compared to May, June we are pretty much at the same except the price had tripled since then. So the volume is at least a little bit concerning in my opinion, and worth paying attention to.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
This is exactly what I was thinking that whether the volume is being compared to the ATH period or for the full year cumulatively.. If it is the same as this period during last year, then it shouldn't be concerning, with this volume, the price was 3x low last year as stated below, we can only predict what it could be towards the end of this year with same volume and 3x higher price.. 
welp guess I'll go fuck myself then (not like anyone will read or reply to this anyway)
Protecting capital is paramount to profit.
Thanks man I appreciate that!
These meaningless regrets can make one insane :(
it kinda does...it catalyzes what the market was already gonna do or it has an effect over time.

Rarely is it super obvious but exchange hacks have generally been disastrous.

Also, go look at the s2x announcement date...:p
Yes you’re right, I’m still very suspicious of tether. However tether is such a massive issue that even the slight reassurance from today is more significant to me than a $30m exchange hack ($30m is too small to matter).
> Funds can be moved into accounts to cover the required period of 

The law firm actually didn't tell them when or which accounts they would be checking, so this wouldn't have worked.
No, it's not a full audit. That being said it does provide a lot of VERY relevant info. I'm so tired of the hyperbolic bullshit both defending or bashing them.

We know the game we are playing and how the correspondent US bank are bullying the fuck out of any bank that works with them the moment that info is made public which is extremely relevant context to understand the difficulties of getting a full audit and disclosing your bank accounts.

So, in that context, the fact that a reputable firm was able to conduct randomised probes into their bank accounts (which eliminates the moving funds around fud) is VERY relevant info when doing due diligence. 
Shorted the bottom I'm guessing LOL. 
This. At this point I am just wondering why they are so adamant about not having a professional audit done properly. Would be the simplest approach to solving the biggest question marks that people have about Tether. 

What is so technically difficult or impossible about Tether's business that an audit cannot be done?
This is what I expect the skeptics to fall back on. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying Tether should get a free pass. The skepticism is healthy and we should be questioning solvency like this. That said, BFX has been around a long time and stands to lose a lot by not being above board. This is a new market for financial services and auditing firms have very strict and regimented processes to follow that were formalized before the existence of crypto, so it's not completely surprising that BFX / Tether are having difficulty with finding audit firms to work with.

This is my 2 sats. At least they didn't resort to [\*this\*](https://youtu.be/UP1YsMlrfF0).
This clears it: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/trueusd/#markets
Seriously dude. Give it a rest. It’s over.
I didn't say it doesn't work. I said basic things work. Wykoff distributions work incredibly well on longer time frames. Flat tops and bottoms work. Rounded bottoms work. Other things, not so much.

Wyckoff says we're going up big-time at some point in the next six months, by the way.
> all medium term indicators are pointing to this moving to the $5k - $3k range in the coming ~6 months.

All of them? Really? 

When people talk like this it makes others think that TA can predict prices and then blabber about tea leaves when such predictions don't turn up right
"has been"...yes.  In the past...yes.
Can you provide an example?
> "close now and open long"

just caught on hahaha did chuckle
aye, you did indeed.

ngl, i was getting worried but too many times ive closed a trade cos im a pussy just to see it go my way. getting to the point where i set trades and watch them but try not to touch them until stops get hit. thats what theyre for after all
That would be too dangerous. $8k could trigger a reversal. Remember we want a nice slow, painful bleed to inflict maximum psychological damage on traders whilst simultaneously reaping the benefits of high funding rates.
Whoa lol I'm starting to not like this particular poll.
Love this. Mostly in the 30+ with a good block of 25-30s. Downside is there aren't more veterans of the markets with more experience to share.
kindergender
im regular stormie.

can we get a strawpoll
you already turned 25 last summer!
Reminds me way too much of the 7k’s. 

One low test of the lower 7ks/6k’s. 

Few knocks on $7800/6800 doors with not enough volume/power to push through.

Only difference is we have had a handful of good news in this range 
No I'm not, I'm sitting this one out, I switched to USD and I'm watching to see where this will go. It feels like a few whales are playing around and I don't want to fomo into it.

This. Get away as there will be money to be made every single day of your life. Literally, every day, in either direction. Just step away, clear your head, go do something fun/hobby and just take your mind off of crypto/trading for a day. It can make a big difference. Other thing, get a trading journal and start writing. It'll help you pick apart your own strategy and figured out what you did wrong/right and how you can do better moving forward. 
Thanks for the link!
Of course I want to make my loss back by doing more trades, which is the first step in a serious gambling problem. On the other hand it is what many others here do as well day for day
Interesting link.  The 20 questions on there really puts things into perspective when I think of which ones I would say "of course" to versus "holy shit, no".
I'm absolutely blown away at how little impact the hack has had (so far, knock on wood)

Perhaps the market is more mature/stable than I've given it credit for.

Let's see now if Bitthumb carries through with integrity.
Worried? I pulled my money from Crypto and waiting for a re-entry ..but to say this is bullish after a $200 spike is madness.. we’re still in a bear market for goodness sake
Btw a $200 rise from $6555 is approximately 3&#37;, which is not bad at all.
Whoa, this guy is *good*
Haha, honestly no idea. The hack is really an unexpected event. Hopefully the bull can defend this level so the RSI div can play out.
Yeah totally exact.  I've already even drawn the same shit so many times, I keep getting deja-vu.

But they say BTC doesn't do the same thing twice.  So, about what move comes next... I got no idea.  Resisting to FOMO long.
That are many words without saying much. Thanks!
Ant stampede. 
You're one of the worst of the bunch.  Total shill.
It's almost as if market euphoria goes both ways
>*The higher the price goes the higher the probability that it is the top.  What bothers me about bulls is that they will argue against common sense just to get their way.  They will say the sky is golden even if they know it to be red.  It might not be today, but it will be fun to see the market go down and their tactics not working anymore.*
I thought i was pretty funny myself
Wut?
It's the same whale or whales doing these pumps and dumps, wrecking people's shorts and longs. 
> "They" are probably the same ones causing the pumps, and causing the dumps.

That's what I'm thinking.. 
Or lost money shorting the bottom or any number of other fubars you can read here aplenty. In retrospect the movements are just so obvious, aren't they? I'm assuming you played all the right cards?
Eeeh I don't know, as long as you're sufficiently cautious it could have a small place as a hedge. I don't think 5-10% of retirement funds allocated to higher risk ventures is that far fetched.
Wow, I'm only 1/3 in on GBTC at this point, and when I bought it it was only 1/10 or less.  That dividend on the BTrash liquidation was pretty sweet.  Best dividend I've ever gotten on anything in my nice safe retirement accounts.

Seriously, though, for any no-coiners reading: If you don't buy BTC in the next little while, you're likely to regret it for the rest of your life.
I literally just started studying charting and patterns tonight and have picked a little bit of stuff up over time without actually studying intentionally... but I just learned from a lesson in the basics that rising wedges are bearish, not bullish. I did a double take when I read your statement and had to verify that I wasn't remembering incorrectly...

top sources also indicate that a rising wedge is bearish, see: http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:chart_patterns:rising_wedge_reversal

As I said, I'm brand fucking new to TA so am I missing something or did you just get mixed up?
Yeah, I see. I just avoid charting finex since there are usually more wild wicks that I am unable to chart properly:)  Stamp is way easier in this regard. Well, there are no higher highs in your wedge, it looks more triangled :)
I don't know which but I'm deffinitely having a stroke after reading that
Yep
XMR, OMG, NEO, ZEC, QTUM, XLM, ADA, etc.

ETH is strong that is why BTC dominance did not went up so much. 
BTC dominance has been rising since January. 

Excluding Litecoin, about half alt cashflow is coming in through tether and the other half is BTC. If BTC demand goes up, and cash flow from tether (almost all of which goes straight into alts) is dropping, then alts suffer deeply.

thx
> All else being equal, you actually make far more bitcoin shorting than you do longing. You make more fiat longing than you do shorting.

Ummmm, not exactly? If you're going off % changes I guess, but no one should be doing that; a 50% hair cut is mathematically equivalent to a 100% growth, as they're reciprocals of one another (1/2 * 2 = 1). If I short at a 1x and it drops 50%, or long at a 1x and it goes up 100%, I net the same amount of ~~BTC (or fiat) each time~~ fiat.

E: It's been kindly pointed out to me that I'm forgetting the base asset value change. Entering a 1x long and having the price double (in fiat) means my 1x long has shrunk to a .5x long. Conversely, Entering a 1x short and having the price drop 50% (in fiat) means my 1x short has grown to a 2x short. Maintaining a 1x position on a long during an increase requires increasing your long (in fiat value) as the price appreciates; if your long is backed by the underlying asset, you won't have a problem doing this as your collateral has grown as well. Likewise, maintaining a 1x short during a drop will require you to *decrease* your exposure (in fiat) as the price goes down, since your underlying asset has depreciated as well. 
This explains why I am always more inclined towards longing as I trade to make more fiat compared to making more Bitcoin. I believe the same is doable whilst shorting, but me personally, I am not that experienced in shorting and can't manage my short positions for a longer period. So I have a natural hesitance towards shorting but yeah I am really looking to change that and gain more experience shorting as time goes by.

As for the above crowd lol, I think they are not very well informed and need to spend more time trading to understand how it really works. Most likely it is the new traders that come here who say stuff like this. At one point, I think when I joined the sub, I too had similar sentiments towards the shorters as I came here to long. As a matter of fact, I didn't even know how to short all together. But all that settled with time and just like a long trader tries to catch a bottom, a shorter tries to catch a top and there isn't any objective difference between the two thats what I learnt. 

The crowd need to spend some more time both trading and reading in this sub from the experts before they can see the big picture. A good community is where everyone learns from one another and help others. This place has some of the smartest minds and I really like to be a part of it. :) :)
It can be drawn from much earlier and I'm super bullish in the long-term, like 90k-in-2022-bullish. However, it doesn't follow that I get offended by bear charts on the daily or that I cannot be hedged or net short for months or even years in between.
The multi-year trend is obviously up but that's not really what we're trading on a daily basis. Between 20k and 6k bears were right some of the time and wrong some of the time. Much of the time they were right and got bashed and downvoted anyways, which isn't very sensible in a trading sub.
LOL you're not the permabear my friend. Besides, the number of tops you've caught earns you a pass. Freakin soros.
Tinfoil hat. Sloppysynapses is a whale plant account. 

Step 1, show and post permabull madness during the peak of a bull run for whale distribution. Step 2, become suddenly excellent at explaining market cycles and advanced TA, focusing on swing positions and trends. Step 3, achieve sub rookie of the year status to have everyone follow his moves. Step 4, convince everyone this time is NOT different and we are heading for $4000 during whale accumulation.

Profit =)
i eat rocky mountain oysters every morning to support my bullish sentiment. not sure if there's an applicable bear equivalent available.

Personally I think we're about to see 6600, but we'll see. 
You gonna 100x YOLO long the inverse-crypto-volatility-index, fam?
FWIW, I only come to this sub because you are here (~bromance).

Edit: that's to say you contribute well above the average poster in this sub.
You sly dog you, thank you for the example of a twatty post.
Few days ago I saw some drama between a couple of users that spanned a couple of days it seemed.
Yep, the pump came exactly at around the same time, which is... interesting...
Like I said I appreciate the charts though. 
Depends on a lot of things. I'm not trying to get too conspiratorial here, but I would wager that you could do it with anything over a 1000 BTC total balance. I'd expect you'd want more than to make sure you got the result you wanted. It could very well be 1 to 5 folks working in conjunction. 

This is conjecture, but how I imagine it:

1) Keep $5.85MM on BFX  
2) Place 900 BTC sell wall at $6600 to add downward pressure  
3) Keep 100 BTC on BitMEX  
4) Open 20x long at 6500 ($13MM position = 2000 BTC) into the downward pressure you're contributing to  
5) Pull the 900 BTC sell wall and drop a 600 BTC market buy on BFX  
6) Wait for the FOMO to push it up past your target (maybe $100+ up)  
7) Place 300 BTC buy order on BFX under to add upward pressure  
8) Close your leveraged long into the upward pressure you're contributing to  
9) Close your 600 BTC BFX unleveraged position into the upward pressure you're contributing to and pull your 300 BTC buy order  
10) Profit $100 per BTC on a total of 2600 BTC = $260,000  


Depending on order books.

But on low volume it’s generally one large player with a 500-1000 BTC market buy or sell that causes a giant green or red candle.

On higher volume, seems like a whale sets the initial numb then the little dolphins follow behind it causing the price to dump or pump more 
Interesting perspective. The pattern might actually conform to a situation where there is no panic button at all and they have to do some ad-hoc scripting that relies on regular fee estimation.
The fee structure as seen on the chart looks like default wallet fee estimates. An exchange consolidating their outputs wouldn't unnecessarily overpay and supposedly push transactions with a different fee pattern.
Yes, we are above the "classic" ATH downtrend line (20K-17K-11.7K) seen here: https://www.tradingview.com/x/gzke4vWa/

Yes you can re-draw it to new peaks, but you generally want at least 3 points of contact, and if you have a 5-month gap between contacts points on a 6-month line, it's a bit iffy. 

Log is important when charting long term because it accounts for the percentage changes relative to the current price.

For example, a $500 move from $20000 to $19500 is a 2.5% move. A $500 move from $7000 to $6500 is a 7.1% move. Should they be considered equal? On linear they are, on log they are not. 
Make sure your chart is in Log scale. The interval between the horizontal grid lines is always 2000 in your chart. That means it is in linear scale. 
afaik rising wedge has a significantly lower success rate and is generally stronger with rising trends (not sure bout that)It's much more of a bear flag imo 
> Alts are not in a bubble any more than BTC is.

You just explained why they aren't in a bubble.  They are down 70%+ and that's not what a speculative bubble is.   The bubble popped and then have been declining since then.

"Overvalued" is not the same as "in a bubble" all the time.
> coin absolutist statements

That's not an accurate description

> Many alts have already corrected the the full amount to support

That's an unsupported opinion.

> Many are down 90%+ and have completely lost ALL of their gains since November much more than Bitcoin has

The alt bubble started at the beginning of 2017. When there are fewer than 10 alts with a billion + market cap then I'll believe that the bubble has burst.

Alts are propped up by Tether and BTC combined. If sentiment shifts away from alts they will have almost no way to cash out without buying and redeeming tether for cash (which never happens) or buying bitcoin and redeeming it for cash (wich will quickly inflate the price of bitcoin). Since you never see tether cashed out, and we haven't seen alts transfer their value to Bitcoin, we haven't seen the bubble start to correct.

> Alts are not holding BTC back

I didn't say that.

Alts support Bitcoin when the ecosystem is balanced and healthy. Today, alts as a whole are overvalued because of illegal speculation done in markets where value is flowing in through Tether and Bitcoin from foreign nationals who are not legally trading within the jurisdiction of the exchange.

Think about how sensitive that situation is for a moment.


Lol, this is so incredibly misguided. What exactly is it that you think gives alts value? Why are clones of Bitcoin worth *anything*? Why do utility tokens (whose network values are measured in the hundred of thousands of dollars) have market caps in the many billions? What makes you think something like ETH can sustain a rent seeking model long term? Especially if their stated goal isn't even to compete with the Bitcoin "hard money" use case? 

Alts are incredibly overvalued and investors are chronically mis-attributing value in the space because they don't understand the technology or economics at all.

When all is said and done there will likely be only *one* major PoW coin. A singular, robust, durable, decentralized blockchain, with many extension protocols running on top of it. There may be a case for something like XMR fitting a specific use case and maybe a mimblewimble coin, if that doesn't get rolled into Bitcoin (it probably will).

It's absurd to think that there's actual use for all these blockchains or that these projects actually have real, tangible development. They don't. The vast majority are complete pump and dump shell-coins and even the big ones, like ETH, don't have a sustainable long-term economic model.

[PoW hard money is the one exception for this rent seeking rule](https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/john-pfeffer/An+Investor%27s+Take+on+Cryptoassets+v6.pdf).
yeah sure a market bubble is a market bubble but the majority of alts are crappy, smushy version of bitcoin with a couple fancy ribbons, some bright shiny flairs, and a marketing team. 

have you not been following the SEC/ICOs/Security talks? Alts are about to get annihilated, quite possibly legally, but certainly in market cap. 

most people are either figuring out their coins are scams, or they are about to stop pretending they think they aren't.

a core piece of bitcoin's value is in the ledger, its as much a social reinvention as it is anything. that value is the blockchain, and there isn't much value in endless clones of it. 

I like a few alts but they are literally alts.

Not many people left to sell

We're all at their mercy now 
It was the fake account for sure.
very true but multiple attempts in a short time span are kinda like taking 10 little swings with a hammer to wall.

taking some time take a big swing does more damage to the wall if that makes sense
I played that one as an ascending triangle and I'll never trust one again.

I had a well placed stop though based on that actually, but then I ultimately lost out chasing a couple non-existent bounces.
> IF that is the case (which can very well be true) good ventures should not use ICOs as they will not raise more money than bad ventures.

If a good venture can raise more than enough money in an ICO, shouldn't they do it regardless of whether it's more or less than what a bad venture can raise?
There is a difference between sound financial planing and "omg if buy a thousand dollars of this coin I will be driving a tesla next year!!!!!!!!"
Not necessarily. I invest in a few companies because I support their business model over the less innovative incumbents.
Depends where you rank gambling on your hierarchy of budgeting priorities. And obviously how much money you make.
I guess you bought every dip down form 20K. Hope that made sense to you.
need to read in context. if you buy dip every time, at some point you will buy the bottom. thats what i said and meant
FUD, pls gtfo.
Good point.  Every exchange that has ever been hacked without eventually providing refunds, first had a period where they claimed everyone would be compensated.  First with the real stuff they lost, then it turns into tokens/credits that can't leave the exchange.

Speaking of which, I wonder how my bter and btc-e tokens are doing.... /s  (and bitgrail did the same recently)

I do think bithumb has enough legitimacy and equity to make this right though.
Hes not asking a valid question, he's asking a question with a thousand answers, all of them wrong until they aren't. He's trying to beat a market that is stacked against him. Professional traders feed off the likes of him he cannot win long term moving on short time frame trades. He's asking the casino what bets to make, he doesn't know the odds or the rules. 
Well he wasn't asking any serious question but rather throwing a gamblers tantrum which as a trader myself is what I was mocking. And I've never cried for the price declining (maybe a little in 2014) but this time it's been very profitable. That being said you are right it's better to be nice instead of acting snob.
And we clearly see what happens to a market when #HODLers decline and let traders take over, so do the prices. Moving markets downward is not really an accomplishment to be proud of.
If you look at 2015 at the bottom it's interesting how there's 2 capitulation wicks. 

First is followed by a huge engulfing bounce stopped by profit takers with a low volume retest of the top of the bounce. 

Then Second is a low volume capitulation wick into sideways. Then parabolic move upwards over 3 months with  a mini blow off top. 

If we *ever* see that kind of blow off top run up again I'm switching to bullish long term, cause it looks like it marks the beginning of the bull run. 

Anyway, we haven't had any of those things yet. like you said, lower lows on the 3d etc 
Look at Bob's chart, that's basically all I'm saying. 

And I am betting on a large drop :P 

This looks no different to me than $8600 and $7700. 

$7700 even had the big engulfing daily followed by a slow climb 
Exactly! Fundamentals like the pathetic volume and very low numbers of new market entries.
Even that is not certain; we don't know what liabilities (other than Tether) need to be covered by that bank account.

Anyway; I don't think it has been a massive driver of fear anyhow.
Actually there is nothing more risky/dangerous than buying and HODLing BTC.  
I have done that myself in the past, with a rather bigger percentage and sort of a similar mindset, end results weren't satisfying really to be frank.  
Literally far more risky than hedging his position with a short
Yes retreat to your sci-fi fantasy world.  I am more concerned with current day reality.  And of course the USA will eventually have their fiat currencies collapse and experience hyper inflation.  If you give it enough time, everything is likely.  10 years or 20 years or whatever.  The human race might not even be around in 10 years, so I'm not concerned.
Ah, you're not drawing from ATH to 10k (and projecting) but from 10k to previous lower high and projecting from there?

I'd call that straddling of said downtrend fairly coincidental at the time I made my comment but here we are nearly 3 hours later and we're still bouncing up and down over that line.

So fair play, astute and interesting observation.
If you short June futures or September, you might actually catch a wick there, so it does make sense. The low liquidity makes for some crazy spikes. But still risky though.

EDIT: You can see clearly the LVN here https://www.tradingview.com/x/AHmWRYxD/
I do not pollute my mind with green. They are legalizing everywhere to create a domicile, submissive, beta population that is easily manipulated. Stay woke.
I'm watching closely to see if this really has legs, could just as easily be a sell the news situation. Yesterday I legit opened a long less than five minutes before the bitthumb news, it happens. 
Generally staying at the top of a range with high volume indicates distribution

But in all fairness we're at the lower end of our macro range ($6-12k) so you could argue it's distribution on lower time frames and accumulation on higher ones. 

Although I'd say the low volume relative to movements in higher price ranges indicates it's neither really


They are obviously not the same thing.   And the price is below $7000, so not much "accumulating" being done over the past few weeks/months...just a lot of selling and buying at lower and lower prices.
I remember waking up to find out I was stopped out of my long, the reason, price dumped and people here were talking about an exchange being hacked of an unknown amount. I googled, couldn't find any article on it that time, decided to stay out and started my day. lol. The price was just under $6,600 then. 
It sounds like the customers won't lose money in this one if Bitthumb reimburses everyone for the loss.   So that is why the market didn't take a bigger hit..same with a similar Bitstamp hack years ago.
I guess at some point we all got used to bank robberies too 😋
What's their incentive of getting in. 

Are they going to pump and dump the whole market.

If they do want to get in long term, theyd do it to minimise market effect.

Still don't get why institutional money wants to come in though.
I would add China reversing its crypto trading crackdown.

But really no large scale institutional money will come in to feed the next bubble unless Tether gets sorted out. Its absolutely insane that one of the core mechanics of the market can't even provide the most basic asset verification.
You don't have to worry about bears this time of year, they are pretty focused on hunting bulls and won't pay much attention to you unless you open a long position 
Oh so "camping"

Edit: also I think the comment about putting your tent upwind still holds true lol
Last thing you want is to be frying while at a set and a dump goes on lol happened to me last week. It was my fault since I didn't set stops like I usually do. I was only gone for 2 days too.
This has been one of my most reliable strategy. It's basically the question 'will the price get to X% in one direction (to trigger a stop) before it gets to both y% in *both* directions'.
Just what I've picked up here and there:

The actual implementation detail varies coin to coin.  But I think that the key common theme is that a masternode has reached a threshold of having voting weight in consensus (being able to participate at all), or enhanced voting weight (if not complete vote override in centralized-by-design cases).  Edit: and are "trustworthy".

Masternodes sometimes get rewards or dividends too.  And are crucial (hubs?) to the backbone of those networks.
With the low volume these days, I am happy with this 100$ pump 😄
Not talking about news at all, I'm talking about a single 5 min

And the fact that 24hr volume actually decreased with the pump
Gdax 24hr volume basically remained unchanged with that 5 min giant green candle and since then has tapered off ~20% 
Timing? The only ones controlling the timing is the hackers. The media duty is to report on it as soon as possible so you expect then to withhold the news or something? I don't follow.

I'm glad you can feel it, but a post from someone about how bitcoin can go either way (when can it not?) and what their spidey sense of a market is completely worthless to the rest of us. 
Apparently it's not simple at all, in fact I've been led to believe it's so complicated that an accounting firm with the technical understanding of crypto nuance doesn't exist atm. Whether you choose to believe this is up to you.

From the article:

That's not for lack of trying, according to Stu Hoegner, Tether's general counsel.

"The bottom line is that an audit cannot be obtained," Hoegner told CoinDesk, claiming that this problem is not unique to his company but one faced by the entire cryptocurrency industry.

He went on:

"The barriers to getting audited are simply too big to overcome right now, and not just for us."

Those barriers include a steep learning curve for auditors in an emerging industry; accounting standards that predated the advent of cryptocurrency, creating uncertainty about how the rules apply; and the resulting need for auditors to exercise judgment, which is "anathema to a lot of large accounting firms. As a CPA, I understand that," Hoegner said. 

In this situation, he said, "we've gone for next best thing."

https://www.coindesk.com/tether-review-claims-crypto-asset-fully-backed-theres-catch/
>even the slight reassurance from today is more significant to me than a $30m exchange hack ($30m is too small to matter).

agreed
If you know very little about finance I can understand why you think it's 'over'.
He's right. Even the law firm FSS that did the audit says "The law firm stressed that its confirmations should not be mistaken for an audit and were not conducted following generally accepted auditing or accounting standards. And it "makes no representation regarding the sufficiency of the information provided to FSS." 
I'm of the opinion that Tether is solvent but this definitely isn't over. We should continue to demand proof of solvency, not only of Tether but all crypto custodians (e.g. exchanges).
> at some point in the next six months

Oh that narrows it down, thanks
For your pedantic inclinations - *most* medium term indicators are pointing down.  And of course no one can predict the future here. 

When the continuation pennant broke down, price moved under 50MA on the weekly.  [A quick history using a primordial graph.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/G6NuCvCq/). It certainly doesn't look rosy. 

https://reddit.com/r/bitcoinmarkets/comments/7xfduj/daily/du7vsbe
Looks like opening a long there wouldn't have been half bad actually.  (I may have missed a joke though...)
The reversal is going to happen either way. This market has been a blast for bulls. We like to buy Bitcoin cheap. Make it cheaper, we'll buy more, but the bottom is in. That means the climb begins within a couple months. When Bitcoin climbs, it puts that Raccoon in Minnesota to shame.
Given the data I am seeing, surprising rationality in the sub considering many missed 1 or more (by paying attention, not by being alive) of the last two significant market cycles in the US (dot.com & CDO/MBS). Strong skepticism, which is good.

If Bitthumb doesn’t carry through I expect the market to react negatively 
The fact that the market reacted at all to a mere 0.0001 of its total value getting hacked is more worrisome.
Yup. People called it a reversal ascending triangle, ascending triangle, rising wedge, and bullish upward channel. 

If we can’t get through $6800 again especially on this low volume there is only one possible outcome. 

**The Shit hole**
About tree fiddy
the quicker you realize the questions you're asking are equivalent to "how do you make money trading?" the better

general questions get general answers. 
Don't worry you'll get it one day.
If you want to PM or something I can talk to you and you can just get to know me as a regular dude. I'm just trying to guess where the market goes- I've never explicitly encouraged anyone to buy or sell 

Although you do realize I've given buy signals before? and said "I don't think it's smart to short here"
yup that's his point. we're at the bear equivalent of ~$20K now from his perspective
I don't see the hack news having any other effect on the price than what I was already seing/expecting, isn't it what you're saying in a circomvoluted manner?
lol thats quite funny, true and a frequent phenomenon. 

Movements are obvious only when I look back at them. Its just a mix of luck, probability and discipline. Beating the house is always an objective. hehe.
OK, I could see 5-10%.  Well, not me personally, I'm limited to a list of mutual funds in my 401k, and not surprisingly, my company pension doesn't hold any crypto (a coworker and I checked).
Yep. you're right. My bad!
you're right dw
Always good to combine with other indicators. Not sure what you refer too but sometimes what you get is a kind of *triangle* which can be bullish. Recent action suggest neither. Does not look like wedge. It looks more like a corrective sideways move in the Elliott wave sense. Personally I'd like to see how today closes, and maybe once we see things in 3D it will become a better r/r to take on a position.
Turns out I was wrong! See the link below from the other guy
Yes I mainly just meant the last day since people are saying this in the past few hours.

But interesting, thanks. I'm about ready to close some of my shorts on btc and go on a shorting spree with alts :) I think the storm is brewing ☠️☠️☠️ 

have a go fund me ready for when I go broke trying to short these crazy coins 😂
So how did it diverge? 
Hmm, no? 

Shorting btc gives you parabolic btc returns and linear fiat returns. 

Longing btc gives you linear btc returns and parabolic fiat returns.

Short 1 BTC worth at $10000 goes to $5000. 

Earned 1 BTC, $5000. 

Long 1 BTC worth at $10000, goes to $20000. 

Earned 0.5 btc, $10000. 

---

Short 1 BTC at $10000 goes to $1000. 

Earned 9 btc,  $9000.

Long 1 BTC at $10000 goes to $100000.

Earned 0.9 btc, $90000.

---

$5000 to $9000 vs $10000 to $90000

and

1 BTC to 9 BTC vs 0.5 btc to 0.9 btc
It gets messy if your margin is in BTC vs fiat, I believe. On MEX, if you open a 7500 contract position when BTC is 7500, you'd get the following at close:

Long 1x @ 15000 = 0.5 BTC profit = 1.5 BTC = $22500  
Short 1x @ 3250 = 1.3 BTC profit = 2.3 BTC = $7475


Agreed.
Once I get a bottom (close/long) I'll pat myself on the back. until then it doesn't mean much 😤

Haha but thanks. 
Hahahaha. It will genuinely be hard not to be bullish if this hits my targets. Because I would have so much more coin 😭 

I'll start thinking "imagine if it went up to $20k+ from here" and greed will fill my heart
I think they cherish bear gall bladders in China for some reason....
thank you
Agreed.

This is what I’m looking at when it comes to similarities in the 7K range.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/ohFSQUif/

Feels way too similar, and charts are generally the same. The saying “ Bitcoin never does the same thing twice “ is tossed around frequently, but I can see it playing out like this.

Also longs are increasing at this price level where shorts are barely opening. A nice break below $6600 and we should see some longs close and a break below $6400 we should see an immense amount of them close from the $6100-6300 range. 
5 accounts, 500x YOLO long.

500x Long $6740 Target $6400 because get me liquid, get me wet 
I love you

but tbh I do it for the haters 😤👏🏽🙌🏽

but really thanks, that means a lot.
Oh yes. Unfortunately it's not just drama one of the guys really does seem to have quite a few alt accounts around here. But it was drama for sure
f\*\*\*\*ng whales!
seems like you can program a bot to watch the order book to ride this or something.
It's a good idea, and I'm sure this could work.  But if you time it wrong or something doesn't go according to plan you could get absolutely REKT doing this
Cheers mate for all the information, I think I need to get on Trading View to start charting on a Log scale. Log seems more logical and accurate given it's properties.

What I understand is your ATH line (blue one) is the same as justanotherlogin linked above. So we have already broken the line and are continuing down just above it. As others mentioned, this was the case back in 2015 if I remember it correctly.
Yeah I am trying to figure it out if I can use log scale on BitFinex.. I think not. I will also try this on Trading View.
> The alt bubble started at the beginning of 2017

as did Bitcoin. Both are correcting right now. 

> Alts are propped up by Tether and BTC combined. If sentiment shifts away from alts they will have almost no way to cash out without buying and redeeming tether for cash (which never happens) or buying bitcoin and redeeming it for cash (wich will quickly inflate the price of bitcoin). Since never see tether cashed out, and we haven't seen alts transfer their value to Bitcoin, we haven't seen the bubble start to correct. 

This is honestly too simplistic. Alts are also held up by Ethereum. Bitcoin is also held up by Ethereum and alts and Tether. This is not a one way street or a zero sum game. I personally use Ethereum to cash out and bring funds into the market. In fact in my year of being in the market I've never touched BTC for more than a few minutes only if I really had to. I think there's only been one instance where I used Bitcoin. Soon there will be more alt/fiat pairings as well. 


> I didn't say that.

You've said it in the past. You said alts need to correct fully for bitcoin to go on another bull run, that is implying alts are holding bitcoin back. I believe its the opposite. It is bitcoin that needs to finish its correction.

>Today, alts as a whole are overvalued because of illegal speculation done in markets where value is flowing in through Tether and Bitcoin from foreign nationals who are not legally trading within the jurisdiction of the exchange.

This is speculation and overly simplistic.

If people start redeeming alts for BTC and BTC for FIAT, net result will be zero for BTC.
Clones of BTC. I stopped reading there. Many alts are not even Blockchain. Its incredibly ignorant to lump everything into the same basket as Litecoin as clones of BTC.
Not only that, competing protocols cannot sustain rent seeking models in the long term. They are subject to competition among themselves and centralized systems. Only the hard money use case can retain an exception to the rule, where its value supersedes its network value (because store of value isn't directly tied to the processing power needed to processes the TX's, it's an additional property, which is tied to PoW, which is basically just burning energy to produce digital work).

We absolutely must refrain from portfolio comparison in this thread.

Edit: pm sent
Well, that 9400 chart is a 1H chart, so it was across a day and a half or so, but yes, I'm tracking. Another attempt will be interesting to watch if it happens.
*If I had a hammer...*
Yes, definitively for now. But in the long run, a market like that is inefficient and unlikely to function. 
The way any crypto sub talks makes me think that the amount of people who make regularly scheduled buys with their Friday paycheck must be able to fit into a waffle house.
It's not FUD, it's a fact. It literally says it in the report, wow.
[deleted]
>And we clearly see what happens to a market when #HODLers decline and let traders take over    
    
Do you really think the value of any commodity/asset will just go up in a straight line for ever and ever and ever if traders didn't exist? Are you a home owner? Does the value of your home go up and up and up forever? What an interesting comment.    
     
Hodlers don't decide to let traders take over, they don't decide or do anything, they just buy whatever they're hodling from traders, then sit back and hold on to it (until they decide to trade it for cash or something else someday). Traders do all the work in the markets and things like supply and demand, trading volume decide the price. 
Edit: are you talking about consolidation at the bottom? Because if so, you should look at Bitstamp. On Bitfinex, the second wick at the bottom was just a stop-loss cascade. I feel bad for the people that got liquidated right there.

But yes, the 2015 bottom was textbook wyckoff accumulation, in hindsight.
> I don't think it has been a massive driver of fear anyhow.

Tether's been a super dependable source of FUD fun forever. And even better, there are enough people out there who want to believe whatever conjecture can be cooked up and were desperately awaiting a smoking gun. 

I'm sure a few hearts have been broken by this. The tide rolling out to expose a naked Tether would've been this bubble's Gox implosion. 
End results weren't satisfying HODLing? Umm. How....? 

Edit; Y'all downvote me for asking what he means? Jesus. 
No it's not. When do you open your short? When do you close? What if there's chop for weeks? Opening and closing positions using leverage... and then you run out or the funds get too low so you "top it off" just to keep the game going. And soon you're down from just holding like most traders in the long run. I bet he performs better than most in this sub. 
You got it.  I was pretty skeptical about the significance of that line myself, but they way the price has followed it today has made it something I'm keeping my eye on. 

Edit: Crazy how the difference between Open/Close has literally not deviated more than $5 over the past 4+ hour candles.
I appreciate your input! I'm trading perpetuity, so maybe I should lower the last sell limit a bit

If my stop limit hits, oh well, I think I can stomach a 1k loss :(
>(((They)))
Well if you add an N to toke you get token and you seem to like those!! 

Booom.

# woke
> Although I'd say the low volume relative to movements in higher price ranges indicates it's neither really

You're probably right here imo

depending on how well the stolen funds can be hidden, even if the Bithumb users are reimbursed, that's still a lot of coins that could potentially be dumped elsewhere and suppress the price.
Yup, back in the day you got famous for robbing banks. Bonnie and Clyde, James Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson... Now we hardly ever even hear about bank robberies except maybe at the local level and then it's usually just a quick 30 second spot on the nightly news.
I think you’d have to make a distinction between actual institutional insiders who would be doing things OTC, and retail folks buying products and services being sold by institutions.

Dollars spent by actual institutional insiders would likely serve mostly them, unless they were building a long position to posit themselves ahead of a market they encourage to grow after they have established their position.

The dollars spent by retail buyers would be what would drive the price up long term in the form of market cap growth, and a new revolving door of greater fools of varying degrees.

Why would institutional investors want in? Probably as an opportunity to make a profit and also to sell more services and make more fees in possibly previously undertapped markets. In certain applications they would like the liquidity (tokenized securities).

Retail folks would probably see it as a hedge, a way to diversify, as an asset class it may have unique return characteristics.

And, of course, speculative bubble factors until producers of real value emerge and can be valued by conventional methods. 
And to confound it more, they just released a "non-audit" today, which at first feels really reassuring and then makes me even more nervous.

A common misconception is that grizzly bears, unlike black bears, cannot climb trees. While its long claws make climbing more difficult for a grizzly than for a black bear, a grizzly can get to you in a tree – it will more likely, however, be able to reach you before you reach the tree.
Probably moreso. Dirty hippie duke is the worst kind. 
Smiling, but what are we going to call for a 1000 increase then? Superdupermegapump?
hack news was actually 2 days ago. Look around Twitter. Some dude posted about it.. Bithumb didn't comment til last night 
Bitstamp did a full audit in 2014 after their hot wallet was hacked out of 18K BTC (they paid it back from their reserves)

https://www.coindesk.com/bitstamp-audit-proves-behind-147m-mystery-bitcoin-wallet/

They did promise to do it every year but the page doesn't seem to exist anymore: https://twitter.com/bitstamp/status/932883442630610944?lang=en

Part of me wants to believe it, but again why should we believe/trust anyone if it can be done in a verifiable way?
Back along there were also some comments that Tether didn’t want to reveal their banking relationships.
It’s over because the money IS available and that particular FUD narrative is off the table. Choose another, short and move on already.
This is CYA legalese. 
Humblebrag=)

Forgot about that post, nice work 
It used to react a lot stronger to less important bad news. so that has changed a bit perhaps.
You were expecting a drop at that very moment? I mean hindsight is 20/20. You can read the charts many different ways. I'm just pointing out that the 4hr ichomoku was textbook in this situation. 

I think the hack *did* cause the drop but it doesn't change the fact that everything lined up so well on that chart, including the BGD breakout above tenkan, which I forgot to include an arrow for.
Aye, alot of 401k plans are limited, but that's what you IRA is for 😉
No worries I figured, just wanted to make sure.
Just saw this. I was just saying rising wedges are bearish not bullish. Whether there was one on the chart or not... I didn't check.
How are you shorting alts? Do you have somewhere you can do it with leverage in the US?

I've been waiting for an alt storm for 6 months. The market has stayed irrational for a pretty long time already.
The supply of bitcoin increased
[deleted]
Yeah, [I corrected myself in another comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8sfbjm/daily_discussion_wednesday_june_20_2018/e10ikfe/). Since the underlying value of the asset itself changes, your 1x short increases to a 2x short with a 50% drop, whereas a 1x long decreases to a .5x long after a 100% increase. If your primary goal is increasing your BTC stack (and also managing your risk in BTC) you need to DCA in/out of longs/shorts as the price changes. 

I'll update my comment.
Oh right, measuring in base BTC not fiat. Yeah, cause the asset itself appreciated on the long, so your 1x position was really only a .5x position when you closed. Conversely, on your short, closing at 50% is really a 2x short from the current price. If you don't DCA in (or out) as the position changes, then your amount of earnings as measured in BTC will be different.
Just what a whale sock puppet would say!

Exactly what I'm watching. Just for fun, I cut&pasted the ascending wedge I have drawn here and overlayed it *without adjusting* over the 7K range. Exact same lengths/slopes. It nearly fit, which is crazy: https://www.tradingview.com/x/sbDg221w/
you're a sick mothafucka, Coingurrruu - I like it. 
I love you both
New lambo every time they do it LOL
Sounds good in theory, but it's really not possible due to the number of fakeouts that occur in both directions. 
Oh for sure. And it happened to one of them on MEX--I think it was the aabtc guy, but I could be wrong. Huge liquidation and even more $$$ lost on BFX.
That is correct. We're in somewhat of a large void for longterm lines right now unless we break back up into the daily pennant. 
I use Cryptowatch for charting. For me is more than enough. Since i trade Kraken and their charts are also based on cryptowatch makes it easier for me.
I don't think you know the numbers about how much tether and BTC flow into alts vs ethereum during any given 24 hour period.

https://coinlib.io/global-crypto-charts?theme=dark#global_money_flow

You should step back and take a serious look at the value proposition and the flow of speculative money in these markets.
> You've said it in the past. You said alts need to correct fully for bitcoin to go on another bull run, that is implying alts are holding bitcoin back. I believe its the opposite. It is bitcoin that needs to finish its correction.

What would this look like? Bitcoin capitulating to 3K, while the ratios remain constant? How come the ratios drop when this happens? It seems like your concept of how the markets are correlated is fundamentally a fantasy. That would be a remarkable change of course and there's no reason to believe that's how it will play out if/when Bitcoin begins to make new lows.
It never works like that. Some % always stays in BTC, especially if BTC is in demand and the price is rising. People aren't trading shitcoins to get more shitcoins. That's not a thing.
I guess you just don't understand what drives PoW value. Nobody is saying that there aren't other nascent technologies that can sustain long term projects, I'm talking about the ability for something to retain "rent seeking" behavior. Only a hard money coin can retain that. Payment protocols can't sustain this beyond the frictional costs for onboarding/offboarding and the processing costs of its network. All superfluous value is driven down by market forces. Remember, we're talking open source protocols here. The one exception is the money use case, which is best fulfilled by a unified network (metcalfe's law, PoW, various other network effects). 

You can call me ignorant if you like, but it sound like you haven't really thought about this valuation problem from first principles. To each their own.
I could not encourage you more to listen to the first 10 min of this podcast. Economic focused, i promise. Edit: how to economically derive a tokens network value. 

https://soundcloud.com/cryptovoices/show-27-cryptoecon-panel-baltic-honeybadger-conference-riga
Thanks, meant TestNet 
Yes indeed.  Bitstamp is the only pre-2014 exchange that hasn't burned me.  They have my loyalty.  The only survivor from earlier days.

But at the time of the hack, I don't think they made any preemptive and defensive and manipulative "your funds are safe, don't worry" comments either, nor did they do any interim token refund system, which is the point I was focusing on.

(btw, I've also been burned by bitcoin-24, but unlike the others I listed, bitcoin-24 didn't have a phase of illusion where they gave fake tokens as compensation)
Home? Yes. It does. From $350k to $575k over 10 years and still going up.

Wow, really? Well thanks. That's interesting. And also extremely unfortunate yeah 
Sure, there was a constant lingering of theories, but looking at it's volume over time it didn't hurt the use of Tether.
End results weren't satisfying as in losing one of my paychecks along with my trading stack once in the past. By doing so, I got under tremendous psychological pressure and became more prone to making irrational decisions. This is my personal experience and I hope you get what I mean, not HODLing. :)
For those buying 95% of the time since November?
You're describing trading with leverage. I encourage you to research what a hedge is.  It reduces your risk.
Old money whales much richer than you or I. The masters of the universe. The lizard people, the illuminati.

no /s
I don't really think there's anyone manipulating this entire market on any time frame above the 1h anymore. Maybe people attempt to but when there's 100s of whales with 3000-4000 coins there's no reason to think you can easily corner the market
Hmm u do make valid points. Especially with providing services, just silly how everyone thinks there just gonna come in and buy everything up 
[removed]
Who did the audit? I'm having a hard time finding out. Is it these guys? Are they a CPA firm, not seeing that they are...

http://www.firestartr.co/
Haha honestly I just don't know of many other posts that compiled any long term TA like that showing when they've been right. Most long term predictions that are touted are just charts with guesses that exist due to survivorship bias. although I guess you could say the same of this TA in a way 
I was expecting a drop after 2 rejections of 6830 in a row and declining volume, not at that exact moment necessarily

What are your settings for Ichi?
Whatever it was, we saw the result :)
Just on bitmex :/ I wouldn't touch some of the smaller ones because they are random af. But a few weeks ago at the top of $10k range I went on a shorting spree on alts on testnet and literally everything is in huge profits. I have a feeling that's going to happen again. 

LTC is having a pretty rough time right now...Think it's going to like $55
there are a couple you can short on Kraken (mostly at 2x leverage); otherwise, you have to short against BTC on Poloniex.
So if supply keeps increasing at same rate while price goes sideways shouldn't Mcap divergence close or get smaller? 
Damn it. I always forget the difference between exponential, log, parabolic, and hyperbolic growth. I know some have some of the same meanings and some are different. Forget the details all the time 😞
Yup yup. Ima be sad if we don't have another bull run after my stack goes parabolic 😜

But yea it's confusing 
Precisely. 
I know you’re 50% short from $6749. Are you adding more?

Last thing you want to be doing again is adding on the breakdown with a little bit of a worse spot. But yet if we breakdown hard and $5800 falls, all hell will break lose 
I agree with you troth
Cool man, thanks. And breaking back into the daily pennant would be like?
I see. I will try Trading View then. Thanks for the all the information bro. :)
I've never seen this chart or website. 

I'm not being a dick, but I'm immediately skeptical of the validity of the data. Is there a faq page about where these numbers are coming from? The BTC--> LTC disproportionality leaves me absolutely incredulous,. Like, that can't be real. No reaction in the LTC price, either, nor data for fiat out of LTC (or any crypto, for that matter). Mmkay....

This could just be saying "LTC is an exit ramp from BTC, more so than any other alt".

More likely, the data isnt reliable in any way. I cant find any page about the methodology behind the data collection. Someone who took the time to intelligently gather this data, would be excited to share it. Smells super fishy to me.
>How come the ratios drop when this happens?

Because people are going into BTC/ETH and then tether. But many stay in BTC, causing alts to drop further vs BTC. Its a self fulfilling prophecy and just the way the market works right now with most trading pairs being with BTC. It says nothing about the fundamentals of alts. Its just the way the market is.

The opposite is true as well, When the market recovers, alts recover faster.
Well, yeah, sometimes you might be in the red when you Hodl for a period of time. But over the years it shows HODLing typically provides better results in the long run. Is that time over though? Possibly. 

Also: Don't really consider HODLing to only be 6 months.
I know what a hedge is. You are on bitcoinmarkets. The most common hedge here is to use a smaller trading stack (say, 10%), to take a 10x leverage position against the rest of your holdings. So I assumed that's what you were talking about. What other independent asset is so negatively correlated with bitcoin that you can use it to hedge against bitcoin?
[removed]
That's bizarre. I can't think of a reason *not* to care. No worries though, mods are going to ban him anyhow. 
good question, IDK if this is an accounting company or if they do have accountants to do such tasks but it seems like a tech company that deals with all sorts of things.
It's honestly really good. Deserved gold. 

How long did that post take to write? 
20 60 120 30
If money stops flowing from BTC to LTC, that alone would have a pretty big market impact.
No it diverges. Mcap = supply x price. If supply goes up the Mcap goes up relative to the steady price. 
It's funny too, because literally one of the trading rules I have on my wall is 'worry about stack size, not fiat value'. My trades got a lot better once I put that up, but apparently a few decades of default behavior is hard to kick >.<
Well, I'm 3x short with 50%, so I'm actually 1.5x short full stack. I'm not going to add more yet. I'll probably look to add on a break of 6400. 

Also I'm short at 6757 on Sept, so I actually have a pretty solid entry right now I don't want to mess with. 
Moving up through 7250-7300ish. That would be pretty bullish, and should prompt a retest of the resistance of the pennant (8800ish I believe)
Did you go to their faq page?

https://coinlib.io/faq
> It says nothing about the fundamentals of alts.

Eh, I think it does. The fact that money flows so easily in and out (generally correlated closely with other alts) suggests that their value is high speculative and the is little long term belief that its value will ever become independent of that of Bitcoin. 

I'm still failing to understand why you think alts are valuable to begin with. How do you build a case for alts from first principles. What exactly is the value prop for something like EOS or BCash. How are these *not* just completely redundant, insecure and centralized shitcoins?
I think most of the people who successfully HODL are the ones who bought below 1k. Buying and HODLing at these priceses is not that too rewarding really.
I implied you have no idea what you're talking about by your questions. If you're hedged correctly by the time that position runs out of funds bitcoin would've appreciated more than your hedge lost and you made money. If bitcoin continues downward you reduce your hedge to remain balanced.  You don't need to use leverage for this but you can.  It's less risky pure and simple. 
[removed]
Simply because i try to judge each post on its own merits, but if you're right, then good luck.
yeah I wouldn't consider this a "full audit" personally unless I'm missing something. looks like they just moved a bunch of BTC into one wallet to prove they had funds, not seeing anything else, so don't think it is representative of a large exchange going through a real audit know what I mean?
Like an hour to probably :P 
noooo I mean diverging with the price chart. if you look at the charts, Mcap moves with price at first and then begins to diverge upwards. How does this happen? 

they're overlayed upon each other, Mcap runs with it for a while then diverged. How/why? 
It's tough because stack size can stay the same while you hemorrhage money lol.  
Ah alrighty, lets see if the market has enough energy to get there or will fall short as it has been doing most of the time past few weeks. 
No, It suggests that alts have really only been around for a year, and many of them less than 6 months and tether/alt or fiat/alt gateways are not common place or they don't have enough liquidity.


Please sir! Reveal this secret of a perfect hedge wherein you don't have to know when to open, close, or adjust it!
[removed]
Fair enough. This person is a malicious manipulator though and people should be wary of that. Mods thought his account was suspended. Otherwise they would have already banned him for manipulation and using countless sock puppets. 
Straw poll request, see top of sub. 
Price and market cap are plotted on different y-axes and aligned at the leftmost visible x of the chart. And it's log.
It happens exactly like I explained. 
I mean, that's the default behavior right? If you're underperforming *doing nothing* as measure in your stack size during a down turn... what are you even doing? I mean, I know what you're doing, since I did it during down turns too but still... 
I expect the volume would come if we did break back into it: https://www.tradingview.com/x/0rkebtVQ/  

If we were able to punch through the top at 8750 and into the 9000s, that would bring a new wave of FOMO too: https://www.tradingview.com/x/OTzE3ZO1/  

I don't think we're going to get over 7000 here, but I've been wrong before.
I have yet to hear a valid value prop for "alts" as a category. What makes you think they have value to begin with? Can you provide a few examples of coins that have an actual valuable use case? (leaving XMR off the table for the time being)
You can open whenever you please. 2-5%of your total position is fine.  Leave it open until its liquidated. If you have no potential price targets just rebalance whenever it hits x%.  Every 10% seems fine 
It's not at all as complicated as longing/shorting with leverage. Pretty basic in the world of investing.

>But I haven't. I admitted to using one 5 months ago in another sub,

**WHICH ACCOUNT ARE YOU REFERRING TO?** How many times do I have to ask this?


> but never to vote manipulate and the admins confirmed that. 

No they definitely didn't confirm that. Just more lies from you.

>You're now trying to turn that into some conspiracy of "shill" and "scam", while you literally cannot even define what I am shilling or who I am scamming and to what profit. You simply assume anyone you don't like who calls you out on it is my alt. I'm surprised you haven't called /u/_supert_
 my alt too, its generally all the evidence you need to "prove" its my alt.

*Yawn*

Deflections, deflection, deflection. 

You can't even answer the most basic question. **Which alt are you admitting is yours?** 
[deleted]
So why does it diverge at different rates? You're not really explaining much here...not sure if you know what I'm asking. 
I'm confused 😅
Yeah looking at it one can say it would take a whole lot of green candles/volume/confidence and what not to get back in it. Btw the red zone, is that a pennant? 

Frankly speaking, my senses are tingling and telling me we could get above 7000 very quickly if the setup is right, to me it looks like it. But my senses have also been wrong more than once before lol. Fun fact, April's green candle took place on a Thursday, tomorrow is Thursday too. haha.
I don't believe in alts as a single large category. Many of them are completely useless but if you really don't know the difference between say WTC/ETH/ICX vs Bitcoin and what gives them a value, I think you're too biased with Bitcoin to start with. Many alts are on several orders of magnitude faster than Bitcoin, they're cheaper, many are centralized and many are not which is good and bad depending on the inherent application they're used for, many are only designed for a single purpose in mind, so the network is not bogged down by other uses and can function for that one purpose, many have different solutions to the scaling problem bitcoin faces. I could write pages and pages on why many alts have a large value proposition vs bitcoin but you should already know the differences unless you've shut yourself off from the alt space entirely. Its true that largely, a lot of alt projects are completely fucking useless and die out eventually (vertcoin for example) as they become outdated or replaced with something better but the notion that the "Alt category" is going to die off or suffer a major cataclysmic event in the near future is not something that I agree with. To each their own. I started in this space with alts and I've kept with alts and I guess its been the opposite with many of you.

This is really no different than asking why we needed so many search engines when there's google around or why we need hundreds of videoplayers when there's youtube or why we need ebay when there's amazon. Why not have like 10 websites on the internet in total? 
Holy shit that's a HORRIBLE idea.

https://rwer.wordpress.com/2016/06/15/ergodicity-and-the-wrong-way-to-calculate-expectations-wonkish/

You probably can't quite make heads or tails of that (excuse my pun) but the process you've described is fucked up and you will LOSE money. The process of hedging and re-hedging is a NON ERGODIC PROCESS. You are calculating your values like a dumb fuck as an ensemble average. 

In layman's terms: you are shooting yourself in the foot by basically guaranteeing that in the long run you will whittle away your bitcoin.
"pretty basic"

and yet when you described it to me you were unwittingly describing a process whereby you will assuredly lose money (see my other post replying to you)
[removed]
Gotcha okay was thinking it might be something small like that 
Yes, that's the daily pennant that formed over the past several months that we broke down out of when $7K fell. 

I'm not personally seeing the drive to push this back over 7K, but this market is always full of surprises.
[deleted]
None of this addresses the economic rent problem. Again, I'm not saying that alts will cease to exist or won't carry on as their own project. I'm saying that current valuations are orders and orders of magnitude above where they should be.

>If a given utility protocol does not have a built-in mechanism, such as Ethereum’s
GASPRICE, to ensure that the cost of using the network does not arbitrarily and sustainably

things happens: (a) the token’s price trades to a level such that there is no premium cost to
using the network (i.e., there is no economic rent); (b) the chain forks into a functionally

You're clearly trolling or don't understand that a hedge is an incredibly common way to reduce risk when you have a large long position in an asset. In case you're just uneducated I'll point you towards investopedia. Either way, if you disagree that a hedge reduces risk there's just no point in discourse. I'm out.
Cool. The fall from 7k was terrifying. Well, whatever direction it goes from here, I will make sure I always put stops on my positions lol. Had to learn it the hard way, though, better late than never.. 
I probably could, but it would start a war with everyone here seeing as how this is bitcoinmarkets and the subreddit seems to be full of bitcoin maximalists.
too much math for ya huh?
