$6600 two weeks ago - I’m ruined

$6600 today - were all gunna be rich 
To now breakdown why I went long earlier this morning as I promised.

Here’s what I’m looking at:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/j5rYJ1xk/

This is a pretty sexy looking bullflag. High volume pole followed by declining volume and a period of consolidation.

Although it does look like it’s setting up for a perfect Bart, I’m going to trade against the potential Bart flag for a few reasons:

1) We have some pretty strong support below us. The $6000-$6150 range has showed an immense amount of support recently. We have broke through it twice, but it doesn’t go easily. If we get down there bulls will try hard to defend it for a third time

2) We broke up strongly out of a descending wedge and our resistance line from $7800/$6800 ( Blue )
https://www.tradingview.com/x/8W3X7ZbJ/

3) On my Chart i have us breaking the 10k line, which is pretty bullish. ( Red ) 

4) The resistance above isn’t nearly as strong as the support below. It’s pretty smooth sailing until $6800-$6900. 

5) I could either open a short here, with a target of $6150 which is a $150 gain, or open a long here with a target of $6800 which is a 500$ gain. Definitely more upside to a long, considering we could take down 6.8k if we could bring some volume. 

Still holding longs from the $5800/$6100 range, and now added in high $6200’s today. I’ll most likely bail under $6150 at B/E and short the breakdown of 6.1/6k.
I've only ever owned Ethereum but today I bought some Bitcoin for the first time. While I read this sub a lot, I'm not trader. That said, this feels like a good time to finally own some of that digital gold.

One indicator (not TA related) that gave me the push [was this](https://www.turtlebc.com/tools/buy_percentage?period=3years).

Do you traders consider this a valid indicator for entering the market for hodling? Or is it flawed?
Long and Strong. Horns up! 


6k range has been a buy zone for me for the last few weeks and I cannot justify waiting for a lower entry when I believe the price will be multiple times higher in the next few years. 


This one goes out to all the people who had buy targets that hit and bought. When it is 10k, everyone says they will buy at 6/7k. Stick to your plan and recognize that your BTC isn't relying on some centralized bank or bailout. I love it.  
resistance from 10k broken with ok volume on log chart : https://www.tradingview.com/x/B7nyOcMw
I hypothesize that the upward movement over the last few days has been mostly due to Chinese buyers. The yuan is getting decimated right now due to this ongoing trade war. It's had it's sharpest decline of the year over the last few days. https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-07-02/yuan-plunging-again

It's looking like this trade war is more and more inevitable. The Shanghai Composite is down and is in a bear market. If were Chinese I would be looking to get my money into something other than Chinese investments. Also in my poker experience Asians are degenerate gamblers and I think the idea of bitcoin would be very attractive to them.


Screw this, I'm going in. We broke the 3 month downtrend and I may regret this deeply, but at least I tried. Come on bulls. It is our time to shine.
Last Friday I exited my short from around $6,640 at around $5,820 for a nice gain, and I outlined my rationale [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8uq6eg/daily_discussion_friday_june_29_2018/e1i0u0z/). 

Since then, the bullish divergence on the 12h/1d has played out more or less as I had anticipated. 

The market has been confidently making its way back through the $6,000s. 

Despite the short-term gains, my bias is bearish based on the medium/long term bearish scenarios I outlined on Friday (specifically a breakdown of the $20K to $6,000K bear flag, and my presumption that the market will mirror the 2014-2015 bubble pop and continue to hug the log resistance line as support while continuing to gradually decline). 

Have I picked the ideal location to re-enter a short? Possibly, but probably not. The market may very well have its sights set on a test of [local resistance between $6,800 and $7,000](https://imgur.com/a/XnmG8up). 

However, in general, I try to get myself into a "good" position rather than hemming and hawing over getting into the "perfect" position. While I may find myself suffering for a few hours or days in the red, as long as resistance holds then I'll have an opportunity to close in profit. 

This is a scenario where I'll happily get liquidated on this 10x position around $7,200 or so, because that would open up the possibility that the market is pulling itself out of this extended slump it's been in since the failure to break back above $10K a few weeks ago. 

In the short term though, the risk is quite low to short here. 1h - 4h RSI is overbought, and I'd be quite surprised to see the market successfully push above $7,000 here without cooling off first.

Weekly Stochastic RSI, it seems when the blue meme line crosses the orange meme line, people buy btc at more expensive prices for awhile and it just crossed again. 
Traders who are scalping counter trend (ex.: longs during bear market) will usually use the 0.50 to 0.618 FIB retracement levels as a good target. This is what we saw here : https://www.tradingview.com/x/IJOkxGpz/

The fact that we broke this level and are now working on the 0.786 level makes me feel confident we will attempt the 1.618 FIB extension back to 7500$. 
GBTC is up 20&#37; today to 10.20. 

edit: removed regrettable speculation. 
I know it sounds like bragging, but I also know reading this kind of stories helped me to stay positive during the hardest times, and I'm too happy not to share, so please forgive me. 
After losing 95% of all my coins 18 weeks ago, I'm finally in the green again, both in btc AND in fiat value! 

Sold in January, bought back in at 11k right before the dump and instead of swallowing my pride and just take my losses, I decided to say 'fuck it, I don't even know what hedging means but I'm entering the leveraged shorting game, what could possibly go wrong?'

A week later I was ruined, #rekted, gently caressed and all. But not before seeing mad gainz from overleveraging and overinvesting. I'll never forget that, I was completely high and out of control, and then I was miserable in a way I've never felt before... I turned into a degenerate gambler in a matter of hours, and scared the shit out of my friends and family. It wasn't life changing money, but it was a good chunk of my life savings. I was almost ready to accept defeat and walk away and say goodbye to crypto.

I decided to throw the little rest I had yoloing a Chewtoy trade, and what do you know, I gained something to work with again. I admitted to myself that it was unacceptable of me, I didn't know nothing and I probably wouldn't have a third chance to make it right. So I started to follow the sub more closely, educate myself better, take small steps, improve my risk management, try to stay humble and most of all trying not to chase my fucking losses. 

4 months later here I am. I don't know if it was fast, or slow, I'd like for you to tell me to be honest, but it's certainly a good result for me. I don't work in finance, nor in tech, I don't know anybody in real life that does. I just got intrigued by bitcoin in 2014 and even more by the trading aspect of it with that crazy run last year. It's a whole new journey for me, the road is still very, very long, and this community has given me so much support and insight even though I was here just lurking around. Hell, you guys, total strangers from the internet, helped me make money. 

/u/_chewtoy_, /u/haserfauld, /u/SloppySynapses, /u/jaredraj and many others really, I think your opinion is invaluable and I want to thank you personally.

But I also want to thank everyone in this sub for helping me stay on track, carry on and learn from my mistakes. And for anyone who came here by googling 'how to short bitcoin' and things like that, for anyone feeling excited and careless, please don't be like me and take it slow. Listen to the big boys here first, form your own opinion second and take the warnings incredibly seriously before deciding to ignore them. It's obviously not worth it. 

Sorry for the long post.

TL;DR
I busted almost all my btc, but I'm in the green again after 4 months despite the bear and it was all thanks to you guys, hopefully I've become a little bit better as a trader and as a person. We'll see. Don't get rekt, it's a good life lesson but in the end i'm not sure it's worth the mess.
I'm presuming this news is what started off the pump. 
https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-custody-is-officially-open-for-business-182c297d65d9
The long from $6,600 that I've been holding for over a week is officially in profit. Almost forgot what dry land felt like.

Happy Monday all ;)

edit: Think i'll keep it open for just *a bit* longer

Daily chart : https://www.tradingview.com/x/PMqXXfgc

Heikin Ashi candles that filter the noise out tell us we're in a 3rd day of green after a reversal candle, which is promising. We're also very close to breaking the ema21 (pink line) which could signal a decent swing up for the next days/weeks. In any case, there should be a decent pullback around 6.7-6.8 should it get there, as the kijun and upper daily bbands are lined up there.

I turned bullish on the way down around 6.2 and my outlook is unchanged, I think this could take us to 8k or so if the pullback from 6.7 finds support in the lower 6s.

Happy trading, I'm only interrested on longer timeframes at the moment as the weather is too nice to stare at 100$ moves.
Broke out of the May downtrend + 21D EMA. Pretty significant.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/LR1xEIw2/
this thing is bull flagging pretty hard.
Well, I have no idea wtf to do now. I caught a long from 6.4k, but I might close already. I feel like leaving this position open is a complete coinflip.
When shorts and longs stay the same and price goes up is that 'genuine' buys rather than short term traders?
Cool. 3 day Highs

Edit: And 7 days.
Look at the 3D StohRSI... Might just sit on this long for a month or two. 
I have the feeling that we might slowly see a reversal, especially with the coinbase news.  


On top of it I regained access to some wallets, which I deemed lost. \\o/
The one day I can not watch the Market in a month because big corporate meetings.
You are all welcome 
Called 67- 6800 last night. No clue what its going to do now that it's just hanging right underneath that. I assume it will settle back down but my butthole is telling me its going to go up some more. Right around 7k?
Point and Figure https://i.imgur.com/uDGipAe.png  At close of today's green we will confirmed a new column of 6 X's. We haven't had many long poles in the last month- fairly unusual. Often we will get a very large move after such short columns, but a more extended sideways/consolidation can certainly occur.

Long term, a pullback to $4,499 would complete unresolved long pole dating back about 9 months ago and is our next likely long-term target.  But after our recent 2-part bull div (big deal!  hasnt happened since 2014!) I think we should have enough upward momentum to not see <5k too soon.  First we need to retest resistance levels.  Strongest resistance levels are described in my last paragraph.

Short term, we have a recent unresolved long pole of 16 O's from 6/10, a move above 7,040 would resolve 50% of the pole.  Fun fact, we have had 168 long poles in the last 9 months and every single one of the 168 long poles have had 50% resolution except this one from 6/10. 1.5 year of PnF here: https://i.imgur.com/AuSFbNz.png

The 2 part RSI bull div on daily (+ macd bull div on daily) https://www.tradingview.com/x/tCzNfMIp/ gave us enough upward momentum to break first downward trendline (green thick in picture).   Target price at resistance between 7,500-8,300. At the bottom of that range we have the previous-support-now-resistance of the large wedge. At the top of the range we have 62% fib retrace and weekly volume profile node.

Weekly chart showing signs of reversal https://www.tradingview.com/x/qKB2OURt/  Yesterday we closed a 2 part bull div on macd histogram on weekly timeframe.  Arguably not as reliable as macd or rsi bull divs but still big.  For those of you saying what the heck is a div, here is a cheatsheet on divergence: https://i.imgur.com/wVw4L6h.png
Every day we are getting closer to adoption. I was bearish on the rejection from 10k and was able to act on that for a nice gain, but the recent price action + sentiment combo has pushed me bullish. 


Shorting 5.6k is like longing 18k. It might not have been the bottom, but damn it might have been close. 


Based on basic risk-tolerance principles, we can assume that bigger players have been buying at these prices and that smaller players have been selling. This is in line with the traditional investment horizon thesis which states (roughly) that bigger money has longer investment horizons, thus can take on more risk (look at VC firms and Private Equity funds). 



I'm not letting my coins go cheaply to bigger money that entered the game after me. Over my dead body. 



Edit: grammar 
I know this is a trading sub but I’m blown away at how scared everyone is to go long on this for more than 3 seconds.

I would bet current bears were bulls in ‘17, being perfectly happy to watch it rise exponentially. But even though we’ve fallen 60-70+% y’all don’t have the confidence to witness a 5% upward move without freaking out. 

Of course, everyone is out to make money and your own strategies (long or short for that matter) are all fine by me. But I feel like nobody has any balls left when it comes to going long even mid-term.
LONG ENTRY PROTECC

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSDT/WtSv4fhw-Hedge-it/
Short from around $6,620. 

Explanation shortly, but I'm mostly just taking the same medium and long term tact as I was the other day. 
So I wrote 5 months a go that I did not believe the bull run to be over yet. I feel that was also the average sentiment on this subreddit at that time. My last long was in February after it had bounced of 6k, I closed it at a small loss in March.

I have been on the sidelines for much of 2018 with my trading stack (cold storage untouched) apart from failed longs in the early parts of the year. 

So when will the bull return? 

There was a good interview with Peter Smith of Blockchain on Bloomberg a few days back. He said that there is institutional demand for services. Perhaps not trading yet, but setting up the systems in anticipation of trading / investing in the future. 

Bitcoin Days Destroyed (can be found here: https://oxt.me/charts) has started to significantly drop. Too much should not be interpreted of this but one way to think of it is that long term holders do not consider these prices worth while to sell anymore.

It is the summer.. overall internet activity drops of and there is a seasonality also in Bitcoin transactions relating to the summer. In the autumn the seasonality picks up again. Also as repetitive it sounds, people have time to talk about Bitcoin to their friends and relatives during the summer holidays.

Not directly Bitcoin related but there are many new super rich people from ICO's who have gotten their money basically "for free" and will keep selling crypto no matter what the price is. Kind of like the Mt.Gox thief. 

Localbitcoins volume has crashed. Maybe it has to do with their stricter KYC/AML and the overall cryptomarket crash. But interestingly volume for Paxful has strongly increased https://coin.dance/volume. Out of the multiple different indicators I find this to be the most bullish. This is real demand by real people with problems relating to their finances that crypto is there to solve.  

I find the high altcoin prices relative to Bitcoin bearish for the whole market. This is because altcoins tend to go down more relative to Bitcoin in a bear market. Generally in a crash altcoins like Ripple have crashed more in terms of the ratio than it currently has. It is still over 0.00007, I would hope for it to go to below 0.00004 before being "certain" of a reversal.

What to make out of this? There are bearish and bullish things happening, overall I am still (have always been) very bullish on crypto. My own interpretation is that there is a strong possibility of this bull coming back in the autumn. I will start to scale into a long position around September that I will hopefully hold for a long time, I do not really mind if I miss the bottom.
This is the first time the 4H RSI has been above 70 since May 3.
I just sold all I bought sub 6k now. Looking to reload on a pullback to test the breakout point from between 6550 and 6350 if it gets there. 

I still think it's prudent to embrace the bear. That mofo is still king these days/months.
Just to add to the bullish mood/momentum today.

ETH is getting closer to breaking up out of its 3 month long descending wedge 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/E2xddAyX/

Zoomed in: https://www.tradingview.com/x/apg1sd8i/

Unlike BTC, it has yet to conquer and break up over its descending resistance line from the high we had in May ( 820 ) when BTC was 10k.

If ETH is to complete this formation, we should see a target of $700 ish at some point in the future. This would definitely help with some market momentum upward, as BTC could follow along the same path. 

Jared has pointed out/ stated decent proof ETH doesn’t necessarily drag up BTC and the market, but a break up of this wedge after a 3 month downtrend would most definitely have some influence on the market.
Here's a quick update on cloud signals. On the 2H chart all signals have now turned "bullish" : [https://www.tradingview.com/x/CBca5zx1/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/CBca5zx1/)

1. Price above cloud
2. Lagging price above cloud
3. Bullish TK cross
4. Bullish cloud twist

This scenario will become invalidated on a close below kijun (around $6150).

But don't get too excited just yet! If anything I would consider the above a signal to close a hedge/short (i.e. neutral market signals). *Normally* one would wait for the same signals on at least 4H or 6H cloud to open a leveraged long.

**That said,** I'm unsure at the moment if I personally will follow that plan. As I mentioned yesterday once we reach $6800-6900 the risk/return feels better for a hedge than long at that point.
going to be a contrarian here and say that the bears are a bit too eager to short here, you guys got too used to making money shorting any and all bounces over the last couple of months. 

don't be too surprised when Bitcoin stops doing what you expect it to do and just continues going up and up and up. 


No horizontal support/resistance or other trend lines visible in this chart, not taking price volume analysis into account, just my good ol' shit.

[https://imgur.com/a/AHwjlmJ](https://imgur.com/a/AHwjlmJ)

I havent snorted a line in a while. I see a bull flag. I see an opportunity.

In 0.7BTC @ $6306 - If this bull flag (as seen on lower TFs) breaks down, I will rage snort a line and have a good day. If it breaks up, it'll be a good day as well.

There is no loss for me in this trade.

Looking at 1W chart, RSI seems to be around 40, a level that has in the past been a point of a short relief rally (for instance, check out last bear market). I get further confirmation by looking at  GodMode and Phoenix indicators (1W chart), which I havent used or even taken a stare at in a long time but are clearly indicating a reversal of some sorts. This bull flag, sadly, happens to be at the top of a descending channel that we've been inside ever since the top of the latest rally. I am doubtful, but in any case, it'll be a good day.
Still out of leveraged position, but my long entry won't come until a dip > 6850. I'm much more inclined to short 6650ish.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/tLmSrWGx/
Going to sleep soon... hoping to see Bitcoin only very slightly increased in value when I awake... not too much... just a steady gradual incline.

Come on Bitcoin, you can do it.

I believe in you.

*I think I can, I think I can, I think I can, I think I can...*
A very textbook 4H bullish flag. As theory, the target is $6800-$6900. I think we will take sometimes around 6800-6900, then retest 6500-6600 and then challenge 7700.

I do think we find the bottom at 5750, BTC increased by 16% from 5750 and the break out volume is pretty high, so we do not need to worry about the dead-cat bounce anymore.



I've been away from the charts for the past few days and out of leverage since I closed my short at 5866. My desire on exiting that position was to re-short whatever ensuing bounce/relief rally we had. I was hoping to get 6480ish, or 6680ish. I missed the initial spike to 6480, and I opted to sit out the slow bleed weekend. 

Even though I was watching this morning, I didn't jump on 6680, either. I'm looking to enter as close to 6650 as I can get. There are a few reasons why:

1) I don't believe that anything has fundamentally changed for BTC. It still has great potential and I'm extremely bullish long-term. However, it has significant risk (volatility, counterparty, theft, loss), a difficult on-ramp for the unsavvy, and an extremely complicated and murky tax/legal environment. These are all solvable, but until they are (primarily tax/legal), I'm skeptical.  

2) We broke our downtrend resistance from 10K. That's exciting, but we did that with our first downtrend line and then dumped more. I'm not at all convinced this isn't a fakeout. See: https://www.tradingview.com/x/whBPgdgI/ -- Additionally, we could very well slide down it as support as we have the 20K ATH line.  

3) We're in a rising wedge, just under all sort of resistance. I believe the r/r for a short here outweighs a long. Breaking 6800 would be a good place to bail. For the more risk-tolerant, 7000 is a huge barrier above. Opening long here doesn't really have correlating cues. We could go all the way back down to retest 6000 as support. I'm likely to exit over 6850. See: https://www.tradingview.com/x/aRG2oECP/  

4) We're overbought from 30m-4h and daily RSI is back to 50. I don't live and die by RSI, but we're up nearly 15% in 3 days. 

I went ahead and took my entry just now. I will likely add to it if we leg up into the 6700s without breaking 6800. Note that this is just a hedge entry and not naked short.

May the Bitcoin God have mercy on my soul. This pumped more than I expected. SL 6870
The bullish breakout today has seen a rise in volume and looks sturdy. Target 7050 or thereabouts.

Moreover, having faced rejection at resistance  early morning, the cryptomarket was expected to decline throughout the day according to TA. However, the market as a whole picked up support (unexpectedly from a TA perspective).

Anyway this is crypto so anything can happen. I would look to news and sentiment perhaps more than TA at this time.
Thanks for those who commented on this last time I posted it, hope it's a good read again.  https://steemit.com/crypto-news/@jcharming/the-daily-dimes-a-cryptonews-publish-07-02-18
This week has been a bad, bad time for me to learn about stops. I'm just hoping I can recover some of that lost tuition.
Come on guys, at least get me back to where I can break even with funding/fill rates.

E: well fricken butter my buns and call me a biscuit.
My short-term long is now on the money (averaged 6650). First, let's try to sustain these levels. Then, let's make a few grands.

Come on baby...
During the May-June downtrend we had several inverted H&S that were proclaimed to mark *the bottom* and signal downtrend reversal. Now we have a "W"-shaped $5800 double bottom on the 4hr chart. Which formation is supposed to be more legit/bullish?
My friend tried to comment in this thread but his comment did not appear. Is there a karma requirement?
Woke up out of dead sleep and added 15% to my long at $6288.

Back to sleep i go.

Catch y’all in AM with a chart and a explanation 
Guys, is it over? Can I feel happy again? This is looking like some pretty good volume. Are we back?
Well the guy who was saying that we're about to bart deleted his comment that I was commenting on. So I'll post it anyways.

"The age of barts is over... the time of the bull flag... has come."

In all seriousness, we had bart after bart for months and the fact that this giant bull flag broke to the upside instead of barting tells me that a massive change in sentiment has arrived. I would not be surprised if we get bull flag after bull flag for the next few weeks.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/RmkEO2Nb/

I erased much of my gains in the 6700 area (left blue rectangle) by holding through the sideways movement. I decide to secure profits in the 6300 area (right blue rectangle) by selling during sideways movement, and it pumps.

I would have secured 6k if I had sold in the previous case. In this case, extra 7k if I held my long for a few more days. Either I'm not reading the signs properly or it's mostly a coin toss :( .. This is painful
I'm buying in tomorrow again... So that's the signal for everyone else to short. It never fails. Every time.
There is definitely some FOMO driving this up. 

Reading this thread is giving me the same feeling as watching a choppy trading environment. Everyone needs to calm down and buy BTC so we can go ahead and breathe a bull market into existence. 
Don't see ANY reason why we should go down more then these levels ( 6300 area ) .  Now, It looks like some profit takers after the weekend ( last Saturday Pop Ups ).

So I'm slowly adding again between 6200 and 6300 ( long term - on my cold storage ).

Have Fun!!!

its fascinating how similar the bearmarkets are

in 2014 we hit the 2nd blue trendline and came down again.. hard!
https://imgur.com/a/SRhbAam

I think we will do something simmilar but i have no clue if this could be the move where we get rejected, break through it or maybe just get rejected at the red triangle trendline. The triangle trendline would align perfectly with the daily 50 MA so i guess it will provide major resistence... 
 


Break of the log downtrend line from 10k on good volume.  Also we're forming higher lows and higher highs on the 4hr since the June 24th bottom.  Very bullish.
This is actually intersting we  barted up twice in a row. I am nowhere near convinced that this is a reversal since volume inbetween is still low and we only move sideways outside of barts but still good to see some action at least.
The bart was supposed to be a sacred pattern! 
Tbh I don’t buy the Coinbase Custody explanation for today’s movement. Coinbase Custody has been announced for a long time. Price should have jumped on the news if it was going to jump. The actual launch is not new information.

This is the failure to Bart I've been looking for. We're in a reversal. Hold on to your hats.

[Earlier today](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8vfq9u/comment/e1ndfxs?st=JJ4T6VGQ&sh=ab05a719) when looking at the short term trend my target for a hedge was $6800-6900. But I would have thought the breakout would have been met with more resistance followed by a slower more sustainable grind to 6800. I don’t have too much faith in these massive candles...

All things considered, we’re soon reaching oversold and we hit the ceiling on this wedge sooner than I thought, so I’m hedging here: https://www.tradingview.com/x/8h9Q6NvT/

This rally could certainly have legs.  I said (the obvious) below $6000 that this could easily be pumped up to $8500 if they want to pump it there.  There is little organic volume left, and the market will be manipulated wherever the big money wants it to go, up to a point.  But they can count on people to FOMO in and many will make a profit if they sell before the next drop.

But $8500 or so would be another "lower high" and would still keep the bear trend very much intact.

i have some questions regarding to Bitcoin ETF's:

2. what is the possibility of bitcoin ETF approval this year?
Perfekt ascending wedge! r/r good enough to go short. nice setup here. stops above 6.9k

Low volume selling after high spread high volume candles? Sounds like supply is being absorbed to me.

[Bull flag to the top of the trading range. Target: 68-6900. (1D bollinger band target as well)](https://imgur.com/JjfiVQ2)

EDIT: Right on time: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/lAERDzbX/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/lAERDzbX/)
Something seems different about this bull flag compared to the ones at $7800 and $6800 in June. Alts have been consistently trending up since the squeeze, and bitcoin honestly hasn’t moved down much yet since the squeeze up to $6500, even forming a higher low on the 30m. I may regret this later, but I’m going to secure my (small) profits here with the hope of shorting higher up.

!short xbtu18 close 6301.5
Three touches below 6300 in the last 15 hours and no follow through...

Hmmm... Considering going long here.
Lol, total 3,000 BTC buy wall till $6250 on BFX.  I know it could be fake, but I wonder what is the purpose of this buy wall at this moment. Showing off how much money they have?
Im not sure I'm getting much use out of OBV in contributing to trading decisions. How are you folks using it, if at all?
Guys, I had a small add to my long on Bitmex in case price goes above 6,405. But this stop just disappeared when we reached the price. Is it a common thing to happen? Makes me worry to trade next time with a leverage.

!short xbtusd add 6640 30%

Since a lot of ppl here are short-term bullish I will probably be downvoted for this, but I just follow my plan. I think now we are unable to get over 6.9k.  At least not much higher than 6.9
Well, it is risky, but I feel there is not much room higher but there is more downside potential. 
I am bullish long term! But now I have to protect my stack.

Keeping an eye on these hidden bear divs.

There's a smaller one at our last local top around $6,800 which I'm not too concerned about. One more move will wash that right out. 

I'm just keeping an eye on the div from our top around $7,700. I'm anticipating at least a minor pull back in the near term. This leg up isn't bull flagging like the last one. 

1D chart: https://imgur.com/E8krNuP


So why are so many hardcore TA-era looking at this as just a short-term bullish reversal? Is it just because projections from the daily or weekly timeframes are less reliable, or there's something suggesting this is only sustainable up to a certain point?
Let's get out of the way of this.

!short xbtusd close 6619.4

Model price based on tx rate: 7-day average: $3928, 28-day average: $4447.

 Model price = 10^-0.638 \* (tx per day)^2.181 / # total coins.

Explanation is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2hyl9c/daily_discussion_wednesday_october_01_2014/ckxhy9y) with [historical graphs of price vs. model](https://i.imgur.com/KOzbcx6.png) (last updated 2018-06-25) and [graphs of other correlations](http://imgur.com/a/7koaG) (last updated 2017-01-30). The code is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2oyrfq/code_for_tx_model/) if you want to improve on it.


**Accuracy of model and recent bearishness**

 Note, that this model has been doing relatively well if it is within *the same order of magnitude* of the price. That is to say, it is not a very accurate predictor of price, and to be within a factor of two of the market price (as recently) is effectively no strong signal. However, the prediction did dip just before the recent pop.

**Batching, UTXO count and so on.**

I have seen no convincing evidence that batching is currently a major effect to reduce the daily tx rate, and a cursory examination shows a similar dip in the UTXO network measure.
I am interested, long term, in alternatives to tx rate (given lightning etc) but I do not think UTXO count is a convincing alternative over, for example, unique addresses.
Parsing the blockchain directly for outputs per block is one possible alternative to deal with batching, payment channels notwithstanding.
I was kicking myself cause I felt like I closed my short early before going to bed last night. Worked out perfectly, time to reopen it.

I thought we might hit 7k if it rallied over 6800 but my butthole is saying it's time to short. Shorters have been getting comfortable but I don't feel it's going to break out just yet.
My predictions for this thread and the market over the next 1 day - 6 weeks

* Celebration and talk of a short squeeze as price spikes up every once in a while
* A short squeeze will never produce enough momentum or price rise to incite real market appreciation or new all time highs from a bear market
* Time passes, price is flat
* The price moves below lows to attack the low $5k's and possibly below
!long XBTUSD close 6620
short @ around 6655, because this ascending wedge will break down soon. stops above 6.9k
I knew the "reversal" brigade would be out today.  Delusion is a hell of a drug.
do you guys think that bulls related with this news:

Solid 5 % gain for btc today. Yesterday was good too. Debating on shorting it though for a quick scalp in next 24-48 hours.

Aaand with uncanny accuracy, Sydney Australia's major newspaper runs a "Bitcoin is *historically fucked!* article, almost exactly at the same time as the price recovers $900.

https://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/bitcoin-bloodbath-nears-historic-levels-20180702-p4zox4.html

Also their definition of a "historic collapse" is:

>getting ever-closer to matching the Nasdaq Composite Index's 78 per cent peak-to-trough plunge after the US dot-com bubble burst

So, price hasn't fallen as far as it did for a market that has since recovered and is now around 50% higher than it was at the previous peak.

Yeah, took 15 years and sucks for everyone who bought the high, but still. 

Comments are interesting because they all say it was "obvious it would go bad" and nobody seems to have heard of shorting, or that there are been a couple of opportunities since December to, you know, basically nearly double your money. 

FFS.
Descending wedge valid at all or nah? https://imgur.com/VnyUSuo
Is the ignore feature of RES not working anymore or is it just me?  Doing a lot more scrolling past comments in here since I switched to the new reddit layout, would love to solve this.

Then I got locked out for "suspicious activity", reset my password, then came back to a text only error I've never seen before that said something like "we have failed you, try refreshing".  Fixed that by clearing cookies and cache, and now I'm back to the error in that img link.

Bitmex is having one hell of a time catching up to every other exchange, but tanks the second the others dip even a little.

Why is everyone so bullish, the volume is terrible this 'bottom', when I see weekly bull volume increase we might be starting the recovery. 
!short XBTUSD close 6600
I'm getting downvoted on every post because I make solid, logically sound bull arguments. You know what else I make? Money, unlike most of the short bus riders on this sub. 

Downvote me all you want. I know how the PR game works and even have more information about how this sub is manipulated than you know. So have fun, guys, but if you're smart, moonlight and ride my trades (that's trading parlance for copying another, more successful trader) and actually make money.

LONG from 6550. Yes, I changed my mind. No, that's not a bad thing. It's a sign of high intelligence to change course in the face of new data. 
Widest bart ever. 
I'm still quite surprised that we're over 5800. How many of you are still expecting us to eventually fall back down and go below 5800?
I think this may be a good time to start loading up on shorts seeing as [this wedge](https://www.tradingview.com/x/vBGvMEMq) might break us down to the low 5Ks if we fail to break 6.8K convincingly.

EDIT: Seeing as we managed to stay above the [6h cloud](https://www.tradingview.com/x/up01Qw69) it seems to be the source of the bounce as well as the fact that this DCB bounced from the wedge support.Thus were now primed for a rejection from the [12h cloud](https://www.tradingview.com/x/OoPpb5yk)

EDIT2: There was a 2K decrease in shorts on finex that could have womething to do with the pump
I am starting to feel scared, basically no buying at all at this resistance level. Something like a 50 BTC sell could tip this off quite heavy and trigger a cascade.

edit: Well let's follow batareikin below, shorting futures 6642  with stops at 6702
This pump is for real.  
4h RSI is the highest it has been since just below $10K.
Short at around 6615 because RSI is overbought and I will add to this position at around 6850
I am feeling more confident staying in position now. I bought in last night and this is the first time I'm staying in after a pump. Waiting to see how the 6 hour and daily candles finish. 

Going on vacation tomorrow and intend to ignore the price and will likely stay in position. Hopefully we'll see some fireworks in a couple days!

Yesterday ppl were still confident we are still going to sub 5k.  Not looking good for you!
If you're short, you'd better cover before the big guys do.

Just out of curiosity, and I'm asking in earnest to the bears:

At what point do you acknowledge the reversal? $7K by Friday? $9k by next week? $12k? $15k? 

Or are you just permabears? If you're a permanent bear, what's your case against Bitcoin? Do you not see its success thus far? Why wouldn't it continue to grow?

I eagerly await your intelligent and constructive answers.
This is a suckers rally

Looking bearish as hell. Support just became resistant. Smart money will be selling now
If you zoom out to 2+hr on bitfinexshorts, shorts are barely lower than their peak in late Jan before the recovery. They're about middle of the road (longs at 75th percentile) historically.  While longs are on their way to ath and getting rekt, I think we'll need to be well past ath of long positions for a long squeeze to really make an impact. Meanwhile shorts still have half the distance to fall before reaching historical lows. 

What's y'all's thoughts?

/U/sloppysynapses you got that bot that tracks open interest on bitmex up?
Is placing a stop buy @495€ a good idea (ETH) ?

Too much hesitation here at 65/6600. We need to break above 6700 for this to be meaningful. Otherwise 5500 here we come.
Looks like a last desperate attempt.from buyers to artificially raise the price up despairingly in a last ditch attemp to survive. Sorry hodlers but this undertaking will prove fruitless in the longterm. I predict another test of the 5800 support before another strong plummet downwards. Market consensus still bearish.

These charts really crack me up, everyone waiting on standby, finger on the trigger, "is this the moment the market turns around?" Then quickly backing down, not to be the last person pushing on the door, it really does look like musical chairs in chart form. Is it normal when a speculative bubble is deflating to see such fitful trading behavior? It looks to me like we have been in a downtrend for months, and now "bulls and bears" are starting to quarrel when none of the price action between erratic spurts up or down shows any conviction and there is no mechanism in place for new dollars entering our space. Without that mechanism it makes me want to close my long before we hit this next area of overhead resistance because I don't see any sustenance above. 
Sweet bear flag on the Weekly....It would be a shame if it happened :D

Went 50x @6325 last night. Looked like sellers were exhausted in the short term. We will see if this really is the reversal.
It has been a 15% bounce, but it is amusing how so many people are convinced the bear market is over, just a few days after a fresh seven month low.
Lol!
Solid wrap up dude. 

For the new guys/gals, this is what we want to see in here. Not one sentence trash claiming up or down just because you want it to go your preferred way.
Not a trader and I don't even want to pretend I know anything about this discipline but these kinds of analysis keep me glued to the daily. It's like I'm reading some sort of financial sports commentary. 
Nice breakdown. A little worrisome is the lack of volume decrease in both the 4hr and 2 hour bull flag. Unless this candle particularly the 2 hour is that push.

EDIT:Well this candle was the push
Nice write up. I’m seeing much of the same.  I think we’re priming the pump for another move up. I’ve been adding to my long on dips and will close at $6900 if we get there... then reassess. 

I’m still mid-term bearish but think we’ll get a short term uptick here lasting 1-2 weeks

Edit: As I was writing, 10k downtrend line broke. We should see a little more upside here 
There was a comment a week or so ago about (some) investment funds not being able to invest in asset classes that are below $100B valuation. 

Rather than the $5800-$6000 range what do you think to the idea Bitcoin was kept in the $100B range in prep for custodial services ?

We’ve bounced and tested the $100B mark quite tightly. 
Yes, all that

OR

This is 2500coin 5m candles altered with basically no volume, ie. some interested parties pumping this hard in a completely unpredictable manner that no amount of TA can explain.

I mean, either one could be true here. 
Great web site. First time I see it. 
Thanks 
Can someone explain the meaning of this indicator?
It's going to be multiple times higher within months. 12K by end of July, new ATH by end of September. You heard it here first.
Am an Asian poker player and degen gambler.

Can confirm 
so you think china may know about bitcoin? 
So... trade wars are good? ^(and easy to win)
in bull markets these "Barts" are called consolidations before the next move up. 

i think a lot of people forgot what a bull market looks like
I would wait for a correction. Top of ascending wedge, right under 6800 6900 7000 resistance. Have you thought about what would be your upside target instead of FOMOing
"Hee thenks hee is goink to mack eet."
"Dahmp eet".
If by some low probability chance that this is the reversal of the market, you would make great profits going long here.  If it is just another DCB like all the other ones, you will just lose more money like you have been all year, so just risk/reward and go for it if you like those odds.
Nice assessment... I'm still bear biased but think we'll likely bear-div back to the $10k line with a visit to ~$6.8k range first.  [Possibly something like this.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/IVncPYej/)  For this reason, I'm keeping my long open. Per your write up, I'd be really surprised to see a sustained move above $7k in this early part of the run.
We can go to 8.3 and still be bearish, or for example, retest the low but make a higher one at 6 or 6.2.
Thanks as always, Chew. So is this a hedge for your cold storage or are you net short?
What the hell is a meme line?
Yeah, a lot of GBTC was bought. Hmm... bullish? Well, who might buy a bunch of GBTC at a premium, and what might they know that we don't? Yeah... bullish.
Great!!!!!perfect.

Pity you did not listed me...... joke. 
Congratulations brother. At the end of the day we are all just people. Glad you learned for your mistakes, that is what we should all strive to do!
Good for you pal.

I got butt fucked by the BGD, and am pretty much back where I was before then.

I have learned a harsh lesson and will use stop losses forever :-D
Honored to be in that list, man. Congrats to you. My very first trade was a 100% 10x long that came within $40 of liquidation that I managed to close in the green. After the extraction team pulled my cajones back down out of my throat, I decided I better put more research and thought into this. 

We all start somewhere. Sounds like you're well on your way.

Kudos for learning risk management and learning not to chase. Those are both express trains to rektville. 
Glad to see you turned things around. Informed critical thinking is the way to go. Stay conservative.
Bullish
I don't know what sort of volume CB will have or will be looking to accommodate, but I don't think we can ignore the potential FOMO effect of the biggest household name exchange offering institutional money services may have. 

Whenever the next run is (not saying soon) this could be where some of the less risk-averse institutions take their money to.
Mega Bullish
Most all of that rise was in one or two minutes.  It wasn't a coordinated move on organic demand.  It was another pump up and there will be more up and down and the overall trend is still down until the chart says otherwise.

But plenty of money to be made on both sides if you time it right.
Makes 2 of us, now the question is if does this pump still has steam on it to keep going. 6800-6900 should be filled with shorts opening and without some good volume behind down we go again.
S/L that now rather than later though.
You have some steel balls my friend :)
that chart looks very bearish to me
Pretty textbook, but Coinbase Vault news seem to have catalised money on the sidelines. 
Set stops to breakeven close at a failure of breaking 6800.
Well it'd mean it's trades that aren't on margin. They could still be short term just not leveraged. 
There's no way to tell. 5k longs could open at the same time that 5k longs close and the longs would stay the same. (market buys openin g longs into ask walls that are longs closing). Same with shorts, or a combination of the two. 
What news are you waiting?
How’d you do that?  I tried some of the gpu cracking software w/ password lists and didn’t have any luck?  I have some old mining wallets I apparently saved wrong passwords for.  I’m hoping they’re not the 25 character strings I usually used.  
What coinbase news?
Ugh me too.  Have a couple longs open I was so close to adding to in the morning but I pussed out.  "If it's still here this afternoon I'll do it".

Come back to my desk right in the middle of the pump and it was too late.  (Still added to both of em, but not nearly as much as I would have)
6800 is BGD territory from goblin town, does Btc history repeat?
I miss the days when everyone thought 6k was our pullback target. 
Thank you joyrida. In your 1.5yr pic, do you do that on excel on your own? 
Adoption by who?
It probably has more to do with BTC not falling below $5k than anything else. The TA has been showing a high probability retrace to the low for some time now. If it had hit below $5k and bounced up quickly, most bears would be bullish, but without that move it just looks like sucker-play that will be trying to find a bottom again within weeks. 
I have been long, holding since 5900 and adding to my position. I was short mostly altcoins on the way down. This is exactly the kind of bull move that has legs, because price creeps up and shorts/idle cash traders does not believe it, leading to higher covered price and buys [Timestamp](https://twitter.com/ibankbitcoins/status/1010863733319483392?s=21) 
because ALL moves up in the last 7 months have been bull traps, we have maybe at most had 2 weeks of upwards trend. The trend is your friend and never underestimate the market etc
Hard to have long term balls if you go with 5-10x lev that may liquidate you after 10-20% move.

A lot of bears here are 100% in BTC and trying to get more BTC by shorting. That means they are long term bullish but the market doesn't show any up trend in short term.
Let’s put your thought into perspective: 

We have been in a bear market since our 20k fall.

We bounced off 5.8k to get rejected at $11.7k, to fall back to $9k, to bounce and rejected off $11.7k for a second time. 

Which then led to our fall to $6400, then our rise to be rejected off $10,000 back to make new lows in the $5700 range. 

This entire bear market has essentially been GIANT fakeouts. It’s hard to hold a long term long position when you see nothing but red weeks upon weeks, on top of an extremely strong obvious downtrend. 

The only long I would feel very comfortable holding would be a long if we break $11,700, because it’s essentially thin air until 20k. 

Bitcoin has just been a dick tease since 20k
 I Agree w you 
The trend since Jan has been down. It's like riding on a big boat, we won't change direction quickly. Last bubble took 1.5 years to find the bottom.  It would be foolish to go all in against the tide.
> I know this is a trading sub but I’m blown away at how scared everyone is to go long on this for more than 3 seconds.


I've been long for three weeks from 6300. Scared? Nah. Scared money don't make money.


You're on a fucking roll man.
But when does it seem like it’ll happen 
That feeling when you realize the pump was literally just /u/_chewtoy_ covering his short.
Somewhat disagree, since I believe there's some equilibrium on supply demand side. Will wait for your analysis. You're a more experienced trader though, hence will move stops upwards. Thank you for what you do. 
Curious to hear the reasoning. The 1hr and 4hr RSI are overbought so kind of makes sense in the short term but daily RSI is nowhere near overbought.
Not just a scalp then? Many folks here keep talking about going up to 6800-6900.
Your last call played out just like you said, you are a damn wizard. :)
What is your position size & leverage?
Stops?
Bear coming back in the autumn,  enters long position in September. Ok..

Yup.  It did 3 times in April on the way from 6k to 10k
The trend is your friend.... until it's no longer the trend; remember this and exercise caution.
Dude, the chart look pretty similar to BTC, and BTC already broke the descending wedge but ETH not yet.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/k9uKoWUl/


Good observation. And just checked and like BTC volume seems to be supporting it.
On the other hand, ETH getting rejected there once again should coincide with BTC getting rejected at around $6.800.

Eidt: Just noticed your chart is linear. This is where that resistance is on log:

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/Prq8c7xl/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Prq8c7xl/)
Looking at a similar chart https://www.tradingview.com/x/ODObdTKH/

Either this do a nice trendline try, or just barts down to 420 again
Eth is hovering right over 0.07 on the ETH/BTC ratio. If that breaks down there's nothing but air all the way down to 0.05. It's looking like it's in a do or die position. Its gain in USD seems to be entirely based on the boost BTC has been having.

If Eth decouples here, alt markets could be massacred while BTC is propelled by systemic capitulation throughout alt markets. The safe play is to get out of Eth and ride with Bitcoin before a possible breakdown.

To me, this looks like a win win scenario for Bitcoin.
Well... let's first break the 500 ETH.
And then let's see. Normally its following BTC... so...

Anyway it's not a ETH chat here.
But thanks 
I've started digging to TA lately (not taking big positions yet), but I am just wondering about the importance of this signal on the 2h if the 4h, 6h, 12h and 1D, 3D and 1W all remain bearish?
[deleted]
nice call btw, I think beside the TA skills (that traders can probably master if they put time into it) not everyone is going to have the patience and confidence the game requires.

Literally me the entire run from 6k-10k.

Complete denial, no chance it’s recovering, ect 
Bullish!

I'm looking at the weekly chart on Bitmex. We have been in a downtrend for weeks without meaningful respite. Stoch RSI has crossed to the upside with this recent push. Two week's worth of wicks down to 5800 that are pushed back up. A lower low created without follow through.

Personally I find the support at 6300 after several dips below quite promising too.

I'll be looking for another long position to open to ride up. Not expecting market reversal, but at least a small run up to high 7s low 8s before retracing again. I missed my entry this morning because of work :-(
We won't be surprised.  That is bound to happen eventually.  And that is the price we will pay for all the profits we made from $20K downwards. 
If it breaks up snort that line like a winner
Love your piece of art. Thanks for insight :)
Bull run will start when those wedges start to break up again.

How is this wedge corresponding to broken downtrend from 10k? This formation is smaller.
Top lines 3rd candle isn't even finished yet, bottom line has two touch points - although it might play out as your wedge, I wouldn't count on it.
*The next day, Bitcoin had surpassed it's all time high. u/grumpyThrifter had singlehandedly ended the bear market.*
I can only hear FLCL soundtrack here
Sounds very promising. Thanks!
> so we do not need to worry about the dead-cat bounce anymore.

I think this might be a bit too optimistic, but I'm open to seeing some TA to support this. 
sounds likely for short-term, but I'll keep clear of assumptions about "the" bottom.
Sadly, this is looking like a bart flag too.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/MqIdWxZe/

 I’m still bullish though
Good luck to you. You'll need it. I'd advise closing as soon as you've got any kind of profit.
A surprising amount of longs getting rekted @ 65XX... and not all small orders either. Not sure were the logic is in longing after we've already pumped 5% in an hour.. I guess the FOMO is strong.
Lmaooo I feel like I saw the same thing happen in April
That's a lot of 100s
So is longing around 6K.
[deleted]
I would avoid shorting anything for the next few days. 

doing so now is the equivalent of trying to catch a knife for the longs.

wait for this to start getting rejected off resistance points and then you can short the 2nd weaker attempt 
Rip in pieces
You might get lucky. Last grind on the \~6.4k bottom in April had a similar price surge (7.5k) before we ground back ground down to 6.5k. All in the space of a week.
Maybe go with a SL just above 6900
Yes it did increase, however, not by much. Coinbase Pro saw about a 35-40% rise in 24 hour volume (yes it sounds good percentage wise) but that was essentially a 24hr volume change from about 5k btc to 8k btc which is still considered low. Additionally, on the previous dumps, we've seen 24 volume change from 4-5k to anywhere from 20-25k which is still more substantial then what we are seeing now.

Of course that could all change with another strong move so take this more as a observation 
It was! Thanks!
good read i think it should be copy/pasted here in the daily
This is awesome - thanks for the hard work, and keep it up!
> I'm just hoping I can recover some of that lost tuition.

You cannot lose.
Public education is way overrated anyway.
Will that happened pretty quickly...
Yes. Karma and time.
There is. It is an unspoken restriction by the mods and I've been extremely frustrated by it in the past.

I had plans to publish a large expose about the poor moderation of this forum... but instead I decided to use the information asymmetry to my advantage and let it color my analysis of sentiment in here.

Just think, most people read this thread not knowing that a large percentage of the ideas people are trying to submit are completely invisible. And there is no way to detect this fact without testing out yourself and snooping around from incognito windows or other accounts or friends.
To celebrate that I will buy warm food tonight!

until then be fearful
Triple bottom (long-term happy return) confirms at ~11k, so not yet but it's looking good for some happy times right now
Cue the theme from Rocky...
Yes the bear market is clearly over.  Not too early to call at all.
Barts happen from low volume and tight stop losses because of unpredictability of the market.

when volume returns, the barts disappear

a 100 BTC sell before would trigger cascading stop losses...so a 1% move would cause a 5% crash

100 btc sell when there is volume gets absorbed without triggering cascading sells. 

Eventually traders get confidence back and start using wider stop losses. The fear becomes not of not catching the top before the dip, the fear becomes of being stop loss hunted and selling the bottom before the eventual move up

Eventually this causes a return of a bull market, which in turn eventually attracts normies, and then you have a bull run that goes parabolic before hitting a new "nope" high and "crashing" back down, i.e. from $100,000/BTC down to goblin town of $30,000/BTC 
This is a dead market, a whale pumps it and bots create the bart's hair.  A whale dumps and creates a reversed Bart. I don't even consider it a bear market despite the fact bears are winning, it is simply a dead market.
It happens.  At least you managed it well enough, or was in sync well enough, that you washed some instead of actually losing.

Edit: in your situation it would make me try to be more ballsy on the next less-planned move and it not going well, which then has the next effect of making me not ballsy enough on the next next more well planned move.  Careful about regret/revenge loop ;)
You might not want to wait until tomorrow, though it won't matter in the long run. You'll still come out ahead if you keep it long enough.
Damp eet!
yeah, but fear drove it down too. It's the nature of the beast.
I was gone all weekend. Out of position, but technically that's 1x long, so this is fun. 
Not much FOMO.  Unless everyone agrees to FOMO in the same one or two minutes when the price is pumped 5%.  After that, they don't seem to care any longer.
You first 
You don't see ANY reason.. No reason at all? Nothing...

Well then,the bear market is now officially over everyone. 
I'm long term too mate.

I'll see you on your space yacht in 2021.

***Bartception***
This is a formation of a gigantic Bart... Bart Kong
Haha, these inside jokes no one but us will ever understand. "Sacred Bart Pattern"
99% of the time news is spuriously correlated to price action.. market dynamics almost always trump news events... but judging and making sense of market dynamics is very very difficult, and so people tend to couple news events to price in an effort to create some coherence from the chaos.

Of course.  People often construct a fantasy narrative for many of these manipulated pumps and dumps.  
This is quite bullish as well -

Would be more reliable if we didn't just under and over several times
Yup. People always forget to zoom out. Buying right now is idiotic but still people do it. Sure they might get lucky and we go up but it is the wrong play statistically.
At least wait for 6.9k

The 24 hr volume is displayed on the upper middle right of the UI, same place as GDAX... Although, Coinbase Pro has truly abysmal UI and the charts are awful compared to GDAX. Not sure why they would approve or design something like this unless it’s self sabotage. Hopefully, they’ll get the message as trading Volume has been 50% of Gdax across all pairs since the switch.
You said a lot of things below 6000$. Most of them being "We are going to 5k"
A move to 8500 will confirm a falling wedge on the 3 day chart.
How about $12K, would that keep the bear trend intact? 

What is "organic volume" and what makes you think there is little of it? Is a billionaire's buy order not organic? Is a big short buying back all the BTC he stupidly dumped over the past month somehow not organic? 

At what level will you admit that the big bears failed miserably? To me, $6k bottom is proof of that.
Yes, I posted this the other day:

Could of said the reverse 24 - 48 hours ago for not breaking 6400.

Not sure what to make of it all rn.
/u/wardser normally has some pretty good knowledge about these walls. My take on such visible buy walls: slightly bearish (or just ignore them). If it was hidden, it would be bullish, since people really have the intention to buy at the price. A visible wall can be used to prop up the price, give false security, open some large shorts above the wall and then pull it when the short orders are filled (not necessarily on bitfinex, shorts could also be openend on bitmex etc).
[I only see 600](https://snag.gy/KRBgSH.jpg)
I used to use OBV, but now I use Accumulation/Distribution Line indicator because it takes into account the relative position of the close within the candle instead of just the up/down
I only use it to confirm divergences.
Was it limit or market? It could be that if the price barted through then your order failed to fill. It would make sense if there was an automated email in this case.

Thank you.  I agree with your assessment here.  The RSI has moved up sharply.  We just had that 2 part bull div on the daily, but I will consider that to be completed/played out at today's close because of the clear hidden bear div set up you posted here.

Another way of talking about this is: In a bull market its up the stairs down the elevator.  In a bear market it is down the stairs up the elevator.  We are in a bear market.  This fast movement up slow movement down is sort of what creates these RSI patterns we are drawing divs on.

My target is 7,500-8,300 for this push up.

By the way Ahmari90, take a look at the macd histogram bull div on the weekly timeframe.  I'm not sure how you feel about macd histogram being used for divergence; I'm not a big fan, but its there:  https://www.tradingview.com/x/qKB2OURt/
Because a 6 month bear market doesn't  end just like that. Selling simply tapering off and price tentatively going back up is not usually how markets bottom. 

I want to see several months of sideways movement where people start to think it'll never go back up and interest dies or a a big fat capitulation candle where everyone is convinced btc is dead and steadier hands drive it right back up to a massive reversal doji before i consider calling any kind of bottom. 

This is neither.
The longer the trend, the safer it is to trade within or in accordance with said trend.

We've bounced from the bottom of a descending channel (whatever formation you want to draw it as) from a *multi-month* downtrend.

Obviously a trend is only a trend until it's not, but right now there's an awful lot of resistance lines (and a big one around \~8.3k) that would have to be broken before anyone could universally declare a new bull market. 
Skepticism is healthy, euphoria is a hell of a drug and can cost you your worst mistakes as a trader.
The lack of buying pressure near any recent highs is bearish to me.

The lack of any support for a price in the face of heavy selling is bearish. Just because everybody stops selling for a spell after the price has been driven way down doesn't mean they won't start back up again as long as the market looks this soft.

log(Model price) = 2.181* log (tx per day) ~~+Cst**-**log(# total coins)~~

Second term is a constant on a small timeframe: # total coins growing by 2k/day on 17million+.

That leaves the **tx per day** only variable which  is capped (7TPS)

Did you consider adapting it the LN with #nodes, #TxPerDay, and other variables?

Please don't sell, it hurts people's feelings here.
How dare you.  You are scaring the other longs here.
Your butthole needs to make up its mind. Maybe it's tired of your shit.
Well this has been the case lately. Doesnt mean this pattern will repeat forever. I agree its too early to celebrate, but one of those rallys might eventually end the bear market
I guess we'll only know in 6 weeks. Why do you think this way? 


why?
That is a solid strategy.
We are up nearly 1000$ in almost 4 days 
They are still desperately scared and grasping at straws in a futile attempt to retain what is left of their sanity.
It certainly doesn't hurt, but there has been more bullish news than this to come out during the drop from 10k.
That may be your scalp I'm afraid.
www.smh.com

Fitting html address for that rag. It's a perfect example of a news outlet that runs an article that has done zero research about the history of the crypto markets. Sad that they waited so long to run it. Last week would have been much more effective to add to the fake Tether FUD.

I saw this shitty stuff for like 5 min last week, getting auto activated for me. Then I decided I want a discussion threaded board and not a hipster bootstrap angular framework for teens  and turn it off forever :D
Last time I checked, the new layout was a good way to break reddit.
It's annoying cause most links on reddit link to new layout
You can almost feel the anxiety seething through the screen when watching the spread widen and rapidly counter-fill on the perpetual order book. 

Wat 
What bart?
Now that you mention it... this has been the strongest and most obvious bull flag that we have seen in the past few months I believe.

Which... kind of makes me nervous that it's a trap... it looks *almost* too good to be true.

EDIT for perspective: The last bull flag that looked this solid started on April 20th around $8.9k and took us all the way up to $10k a few times before we broke down.
I think 10k is more likely than 5k in the short term. Just my opinion
We are facing the December 2017 ATH being removed from the 200 day MA this week (as we will be more than 200 days from the ATH on July 4th-5th). Should make for an interesting couple of weeks of trading.
We've been in a harsh downtrend for months with a bounce every now and then. A bounce to 7k wouldn't surprise me, but an eventual sub $5k seems inevitable at this point.
The chart says we are likely to drop farther and below $5800 in the next few months, so I am expecting that.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/uMN8fVdI/

Pretty clear and steady downtrend since $10K.  Until that changes, then it hasn't changed.

Why anyone thinks this would go much under 6K for more than a few hours is beyond me. 
I think breaking 6.8k will have to wait until RSI resets. Everything up to 4H is way overheated right now.
On your chart we already broke it.
I just watched the 100BTC buy wall on Coinbase Pro get demolished, yet the price didn't even move down. In fact, it's going up now. Don't underestimate the strength of bulls.

Also don't get scared. Emotions are useless and even detrimental while trading.

EDIT: I also expect it to go down. I'm just saying that 50BTC isn't going to crash this train.
This definitely feels a hell of a lot more different than the bull flag in 6400 range. 

Feels a tad too Bart-ey. 

But going to hold onto my long and wait it out some more 
Only 6 hours passed since previous BGD. Let it calm down. There is no selling either at the moment.
There was an 86 BTC market sell at $6,650 - invisible buy wall sucked it right in. I wouldn't go by the visible order book, there's icebergs out there.
When a daily oversold bull div is resolving you'll get high 4hr RSI. 
I think we're about to get something that looks V shaped.
right... a bear trap that made bears filthy rich...
For some reason, i always read your username as TheGinFeeces. which checks out with the quality of the post.
Yeah, Chinese New Year and so on... or not. That's how sheep think, are you a sheep?

People buying is people buying regardless of the circumstances.

You must have really hated the run up to $19k 
Rule 3 - The rules ask for more substance in your posts.
And I'm confident that there's no effort or substance in your post! See we're both confident there!
It's still looking like the price will go significantly lower..probably below $5K. Nothing much has changed with the 1d and 1w chart.  Downtrend very much intact. 

But enjoy only being down 67% in the last several months now.  You have to take what you can get.
Lol you can't be serious. We had a lower low just last week, you're quite brazen calling out bears below 10k, i hope nobody wastes there time replying. 
Ffs tell us why youre so sure of yourself otherwise youre just like the bears, two sides 1 coin 
Someone isn't looking at the monthly charts, methinks.
When we see a larger pullback on BTC to about $4500 (+/- 5%) I will consider us possibly bottomed out. I just don't think  that was the bottom and although buying power in the 6K range is strong I don't think it will be enough to hold us up here. 
$1M and not a penny less. Don't trust this shit until $1M guys. 
Lol @ all the downvotes. Are bears really that soft? 
>This is a suckers rally

Thank you, I was missing this phrase from my Permabear quote scavenger hunt
Usually I would take a comment like this down, but it's so comically predictable that I think it's sarcasm. Gotta get that /s in if it's a joke and you want to avoid downvotes.
Great for you... so you sold your house and went short?
Support pretty much always becomes resistance. The resistance between 6,400 and 6,500 has been present for over a week now.
This gave me a hearty lol.
Lol -- ha, yeah, "long squeeze." Good luck with that. Longs aren't heavily leveraged as a rule so we're hard to squeeze. I've been sitting on a long from 6300 for weeks now. 3x leverage, and I'll close at 7300. Yeah, I'm being greedy.
You don’t need a massive imbalance of long/short ratios for price to change direction. The imbalances only indicate liabilities in certain interstitials  
Posting in a wrong thread was a bad idea.
Why €495? If BTC and ETH break up from here you're going to miss the train. And it may go as high as  €495, but not much higher. 
You must be new here :) 

If you’re trying to be funny and mock me, you have failed pretty hard. 

I’m pretty sure I’ve established enough credibility to post my entry and later add analysis. 
Wish you sweet liquidation dreams ;)
There isn't.   
Bitfinex = 6641  
Binance = 6644
this is wrong in cmc, Check the exchange.
well if you have btc that you're going to sell at 5500, might as well sell them here
Why the downvotes, disagree with the prediction or just didn't like my wording? I'm trying to figure out if people are still overly bullish around here to the point of downvoting any posts that aren't bullish.
Aaaaaand I was right. This is not a bull market, it's still a bear, like it or not.
This is a sucker's rally am-i-right?  /s
Are you basing the “consensus” on the sentiment in this sub or on the current bullish move up? Or on lines people have drawn on TradingView?
Your holding period begins when you actually have the BCash. Long term means it must be held for at least a year and a day. 
Upvotes, downvotes...who cares? At worse you'll get reported for low-effort posts and put on the ignore list. Just read the rules and try to contribute some TA with your opinion of the market.

There's nothing wrong with being Bullish or Bearish as long as you bring something to the table other than your opinion.
Post reported for sheer idiocy and so I can block you.

Also, $6650.  Congratulations.  You are now down just 64%.
Why talk bad about the bears, they are humans like all of us... I read you added a nice long position last night just before the pump. I am curious what made you trigger that trade, and what is it with the perfect timing?
Ironic
So what you're saying... Is that in a bear market... In an asset that has typically bubbled, popped, entered a bear market only to bubble again... People are trying to catch the bottom for the next cycle?

*Holy shit*
Shut up nerd

It would constitute two failed Barts in a row if we went up from here, the beginning of the highly bullish Stairway to Heaven formation.
Downvote me all you want  boyos.

 Wow I went 100x @5750 
I would say very few here are “ Convinced “ the bear market is over.

I would say people are leaning more towards a relief rally that will eventually get stopped dead in its tracks to resume the downtrend. 

After weeks of red, a small rally is needed.

Head over to the Cryptocurrency subreddit if you want to see moonbois talking about the next bull market right around the corner 
Double or tripple bottom depending how you want to look at it. Perhaps the panic sellers have left the arena...
Do you mean "so many people" in this sub specifically are convinced the bear market is over? Can you post some examples?

edit: yeah, what /u/Coingurrruu said
It has been at least a relief rally, and could go further.  But not so many are calling it an end to the bear.
You’re convinced the bear market is not over which is exactly the same since it can go both ways from here
It’s definitely not on the advanced side of T.A, but this way has worked for me and so far I’ve been a pretty successful trader. 

Not being Bias is also a huge plus, and being able to change your mindset with a trend shift can be a huge plus when making decisions 
I appreciate that, guy 
I’m confident we will see $6800 within a few days 
Would ya look at that. Some great timing. This could be the mini relief rally we were all looking for. 
I've tried to get info about how they calculate it but there isn't a lot out there.  I signed up for the site and they want to charge you $54 a month to use the site and all their signals.  There is a one-day free trial so you can check it out, so let's see if they send me anything good for my one day lol.
Actually i heard it from you months ago when we were at 10k
Satire or you genuinely believe this?
12k never again this year
I bought at ATH so technically I’ve never even seen a bull market myself lol
During the bullmarket we had formations that showed bulls taking the stairs up, with a natural give and take, what we have lately is sideways on low volume punctuated by either a giant market dump or pump. 
The price has been steadily declining for 7 months and just recently made a new low.  You people are seriously nuts thinking every $300 fraudulent pump is the next bull run.  I think you all have Stockholm syndrome.
I can wait 6+ months if necessary, and sell on the next rally. There is a great amount of FOMO, I admit, but most of this market is driven by that anyways...
You literally just posted about your losses and how this is a "coin toss" and now you're advising? IDK man 
I wouldn't be surprised if this goes back down to 6400-6500 territory
I think many people are expecting 6800 as the top.

Not sure whales would make it that easy.
Absolutely. The market could actually jump as high as $11,700 again and still remain bearish. 

Like I said, I'm taking what I believe is a "good" short position. That doesn't mean it's the best one possible, or that I'm even correct that it's "good."
It's a hedge for my cold storage. I've really only been net short for a few days in all of 2018, and I nearly shit myself at least a dozen times when I was.
GBTC has traded at a premium of close to 60% the majority of this year but was down close to 40% at the end of last week. With BTC on the way up over the weekend it was very likely that GBTC would outperform so I’m not sure I would read into much more than that.
Thanks man!
Let's make sure to not have them tighter than our butthole though, I feel like it's a very important ratio to keep away those dildos
Haha thanks man, glad to hear that, it's really encouraging. By the way, besides your TA I love reading when you manage your positions, sometimes it almost looks like you're playing chess. Very engaging, and super interesting!
will do, thanks *dad*
I like your reasoning. I think your conclusion based on your assumptions is plausible and comprehensible. I am going to trade accordingly.
Depends what you're looking at. 

Zoomed out a bit https://www.tradingview.com/x/oRTE1lBG, you'll see that the fall is much less steep and with more relief inbetween than the one from 11.7 to 6.4, hinting at much less panic. More like a "controlled shakeout".

There is a double bull div, both on RSI and MFI.

While it's not broken yet, we wicked generously in the ema21 that was untouched since 10k.

It's subtle, but there are some signs of a possible relief rally here.
Me too, I don't understand how people are bullish, this 500 dollar move up looks like nothing on a weekly/daily chart. At least be neutral
Can you point me to this news? all I can find was from march 2018. What did i miss?

Think stops just below 6.5 are a bit too tight?

I dont believe in just setting stops at breakeven, its kind of similar to the sunk cost fallacy. I like to move stops to wherever I would put them if I was entering a new position at the time. 


Found the seeds, while looking for 2-FA codes because I lost my phone. So exchange cryptos are safe, too.

Good luck to you.
I woke up out of a dead sleep half drunk and added.

Come on Vel. 
I longedfrom 6311 on futures yesterday, then because those meetings I closed at break even before sleep :) 

Anyhow I do not trust this move too much so I put some stops at 6500 for some stuff i bought at 6100 last month anyway
It doesn't have to come anytime too soon.  Yesterday I wrote up a possibility (fractal of 2013-2014) that would put us at 15k before 4k.  https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8uzb6w/daily_discussion_saturday_june_30_2018/e1kw3va/ 
flight to yield and long term store of value
Holders. Don't buy the stupid BCash meme that adoption = spending on merchants. Holding is a valid use case for sound money, especially in an Austrian framework. Holders restrict supply, which drives the value up. If everyone was constantly spending their Bitcoin, then it would have very little value. 

Store of value is crucial to sound money. 
Its just positive self talk....
perhaps but bullish news such as the coinbase custody announcement today could make TA irrelevant. There was also legit corrections last summer leading up to breaking out of 5k in the fall.  Whereas the 6k to 20k was never really hashed out until now.  I think the market is is slowly heating up
I just posted about the bear flag on the weekly and got downvoted lol sucker's play rn
Are you saying this is medium term bullish or headed to new ATH bullish?

Aren't you sort of selectively ignoring a lot of bearish signals or do you most trade price action?
>Bitcoin has just been a dick tease since 20k

This.

Although it looks a bit different **™**  this time
It was thin air both ways. Now there will be a lot of sellers trying to get out on be :-\
But this isn't 2014. There is no existential crisis. Bitcoin is doing just as well if not better than in January when it was 19k
you aren't a bear.  No matter how low it goes, you'd still hold.
Spread some butter!
Yea he’s essentially called every move in the last XXX amount of weeks and he targets are in the general range of 25-75$ of where the price hits
Set orders and stops and walk away 
I covered my short back down at $5,820 or so. And if covering my short could push the entire bitcoin market ~5%, then I honestly wouldn't even be mad about the loss. I'd be "rich bitch", so to speak.
This is the first time in ages where I've seen Chewy take a position I can't fathom the reasoning on. Closing a long, sure, but opening a short is interesting. Will be curious to see his explanation. 
If the market continues a steady decline, then 70+ 1D RSI is not something that's likely to be seen for many weeks to months. 

While the market might ping-pong between overbought and oversold conditions on lower timeframes while still remaining in a strong trend, that's not usually the case on higher timeframes. 

For the 1D, I really wouldn't expect RSI to make it above 60 before buyers lose momentum.

Honestly, if 1D RSI _did_ make it above 70, I'd be more interested in opening a long than opening a short. If you look back at previous bull runs, 70+ 1D RSI is often an indication that there's still substantial upside in the immediate future.
He is a very smart, very solid trader to be sure.  He reminds me how lazy I am with my entries and exits and should put some more work into it.

100%, 10x (from the bot)
10x with 100% of my trading stack, as has been the general size of all my short positions since $20K. 
Will probably bail if the market gets above $7,000. 
edited, meant bull.
Lets be real too.. it's mostly drug shit 
You could probably get some short-term gains by shorting here. A retrace into the low 6500s is likely during a couple-days of sideways before the next break. 

I'm targeting a limit sell in the 7450 range which would put us at roughly the .618 fib retrace from the drop from 10k. I think we'll top out in that range and continue to fall and retest 4-5K.
 Say for example, BTC moves to $6800 and ETH follows and tests the 820 resistance  line. Gets stopped and BTC consolidates at $6800 for a day and ETH right below line. Shorts start stacking up at $6800.

ETH starts gaining momentum and pushes through the line. It could be the little bit of juice BTC needs in order to break $6800. 

( Just a random hypothetical theory ) 
So if both get rejected at these points, how fucked are we? Also, in your opinion, what are the numbers we need to hit for you to feel we are actually pulling out of this downtrend?
That’s definitely a possibility. 
Look at the ratio. If Eth breaks down here it's going a lot lower and at the very least it's taking every ERC20 token with it.
BTC setting up for a bart flag right now so 

I’m pretty torn currently 
One thing I’ve learned from this bear market.

BTC is king and will always be. I’m over invested in alts, it may be time to taking the other side of the court 
Not so sure capitulation throughout the alt markets would propel BTC up. BTC is under 50&#37; market cap overall and is the main on/off ramp for fiat. If alts capitulate into BTC I'd imagine those capitulating wouldn't be planning on staying in BTC, but rather moving to fiat (and selling BTC in the process).

A large portion of the fiat invested within this emerging asset class fleeing out of it would certainly be negative for BTC short-medium term (depending on how fast the bleed occurs) as a member of that asset class, just not as bad as for the illiquid alts.
I’m cautious when it comes to talking about alts in this subreddit.

But when talking about ETH, if you bring facts/charts/analysis into your post when it’s directly related to BTC, it’s OK.

Otherwise, just saying “ ETH is mooning and BTC should follow” is not advised 
You will notice that "analysts" can always adjust their indicator setup or timeframe in order to align "predictions" to their emotions. Bears and bulls use the very same TA tools, just different setup. 
Anyone trading on the 1W metrics is bound to lose money... It's like showing upto a party at 6am.
I literally said a short at 6.9k is better risk/return. I guess you didn't read until the end?
it can still be bearish, the difference is that these guys are opening their shorts after a fairly minor move, when the true bear test is a bit higher(at around $8,500)
What position are you in currently?
That is certainly bullish: https://www.tradingview.com/x/JQdEuud9/

But remember that's a new downtrend line. The first downtrend line was broken, re-entered, broken, re-entered, etc: https://www.tradingview.com/x/JvR1bfq4/

I'll take my chances with the rising wedge and the fact that nothing fundamentally has changed regarding BTC
Here's the 1H:

There are a lot of touch points on this formation. 
I must be dreamin' already!

Its clearly a Evangelion reference of some sort man
Bolinger "w" bottom confirmed at 6300 on the stamp 1day charts, so there's that
Was going to say the same... If i was out of position i would short this, now that i'm long i have greed on my ears saying let it ride...

Was hoping for a test of 6800 at least to close with some profit (as if going from -15% to +1% wasn't "profit" enough)

MEX has some absurd sell walls that worry me, though ($20MM @ 6690 and $17.5MM at 6700). Walls like that are friggin magnets. 
I plan to set profit stops once 6500 falls. 
and with so much leverage that small a move wrecks you
How so? 

BTC went under 6k just briefly to around 5900 and stayed there couple hours.

On the other hand we are now sitting on 6600 and I'm expecting it to go up even higher given the fact how positive news started to pop up.
So is trading
Great fucking entry. Did you market order that one?
No SL?
I should have waited instead of predicting entry points.. :(
hahaha
Good call! That's a high volume node
It's kind of a lot!  And has nice formatting with the images.
Thanks I'll keep dropping them here.  I have a few initial submissions as a text post to bitcoinmarkets sub as well, however I'm getting a lot more responses here in the daily in general. 
Thank you! : )
Only if uses high enough leverage. 
That's the idea. It's important to remember the value of failure.

I'm not an expert pro trader. I know that. I'm an idiot beginner, making idiot beginner mistakes, and paying for those mistakes. (Shorting at the bottom with no stops? Whoops!) As long as I can gain some education from those mistakes... yeah, I cannot lose.
No it arent.
Self education has always suited me best.
Pretty much as I was tying it; hit 5600 hit 5600 hit 5600... erm... well thanks!
How much is required?
The only reason to be frustrated by AutoMod is if you're making multiple accounts. Are you making multiple accounts? Have you been banned? Do you only use accounts with negative karma?
Agreed. If $8.6k breaks I’ll go bullish, until then I remain skeptical.

I’m also currently long as I think this thing will continue up in the short term
and 10,000 and 11,700 and 20,000
What kind of time frame should I be looking at breaking that level?
> until then be fearful

Or greedy?
At this point 11k sounds like a distant fantasy. Hard to believe we were there couple months ago.
this is actually a really good summary of the past year or so
Hey thanks man. I didnt really understand the 2nd paragraph after reading it 3 times lol

edit: I get it now. :)
I buy in every other Tuesday no matter what.
Welcome back.

You were contemplating going long when you closed your shorts at $5800, shoulda went with the gut 
Lol, me too :D

Didn't risk entry at 5.8, just somehow managed to scalp 6.5-6.6 1x long between 'service unavailable' on mex.
What ever You  Say and Think. 

I have my own strategy and thinking with Crypto's

Since 2014.

Have fun!!!
It depends on what the news is. Of course there is Bitcoin "news" every day, so of certainly market dynamics usually trumps that.

The Coinbase news probably had very little effect and this is just another extended DCB that spiked up about on schedule.
What's manipulated about it?
Yeah, you just wait for us to break through $20k mark, that will be a good opportunity for a new run.
Why is buying "idiotic," and why is it the wrong play "statistically?" 

I can think of a lot of valid reasons to buy, not least of which is that ~6K is an obvious bottom. People selling now will regret it in a few years. Big bears will capitulate (they have no choice, really) just like always. 

This is a great time to buy. Nobody's panicking, and most of the sell pressure is fake, coming from people obviously losing a ton of money.
And lose money? Nah. Buy now. It's as low as it's going to get at least for a while.
More like r/jokesforkids
Thanks. That did it
They switched over the weekend which had low volume across the board, their volume is exactly the same as Gdax because it's exactly the same thing aside from some UI changes.
I never said "We are going to 5K" because I'm not as dumb as you are to think that way.

I probably said something like "We are likely going to 5K" and that hasn't changed.   It is still well over 50% probability.  
I don't think it's likely it will bounce that high, but certainly decent probability and would be a juicy short entry.

> What is "organic volume" and what makes you think there is little of it? 

Organic volume is non-manipulated volume. It is volume by someone who is buying in the hopes the price will go higher in the future...not buying to force the price up 5% immediately so they can make money from their leveraged options or futures expiration. Why do I have to state the obvious.

> At what level will you admit that the big bears failed miserably?

The "big bears" have already won.  The price is down 67% over the last several months.



thank you so much! this is what i was looking for. so we have some deadlines regarding to ETF's.. lets see whats gonna happen. 
Looks like you are not lord high chancellors at sec but troll.. 
Google Wyckoff. Those are abbreviations for selling climax, secondary test, and automatic reaction, labeled by price action and volume. 
I can see that bears plan to short around the 6800-6900 level (which is why I said that's the short term target). At this point, volume behavior is showing signs of supply absorption, rather than distribution.
[deleted]
I feel like this post explains the last 5 days.

New people coming out of the dark 
[removed]
Thanks for the welcome. Been trading BTC and equities the past few years and have been a lurker. This is my introduction and contribution.
I can get behind that statement. Either way, it seems unlikely we will test a new low anytime soon with the way things are looking right now.
I like it though; Nobody believes in the bull flag being real!
I’m not wholly convinced it’s not one, but someone’s playing some weird game with alts right now if this is about to dump.
True, but I would expect to meet resistance overhead in a bear market having pushed up the way we did. What I didn’t expect was for us to pull back from 6500, stabilise at 6300, and resist several pushes below 6300. I would have thought we re-tested $6k by now.

Let’s see what happens in the next hour. We are touching 6300 again...
What are these hidden buy walls and how do you know they exist if they're hidden?
Here is what I see dude, down to 2k6 at this moment

https://imgur.com/Rugv3ib
Did not get an email so far. It was the market stop when price >= 6,405. Now I feel very inconfident relying on stop losses.
There is a strong resistance.  Beside that we have rocketed too high in just 2-3 days. In strong bear market you just can not get away with it.  Not to mention RSI. 
I'll jump in. No volume. 
Rounded bottoms are actually pretty rare for Bitcoin.
That makes sense. So its simply just safe to see this as another short-term bounce.
I see. So, the idea has been that bulls have just been too anemic to decisively counter the bears every time resistance is hit, particularly as we got to 10K? I'm presuming we're using mostly the Feb-April runup as a reference.... and we have no reason the expect this pattern will change yet? 

If I'm getting this right, then what would need to change? I'm predicting there are some kinds of volume indicators that are out there? 
It is the only variable, effectively. I've considered multi factor models but probably would not post that. Historical comparison/ regressing becomes a bit difficult in that case. If ln txs become a significant number I would consider that also. At the moment I do bit have access to that data in automated (api) form.
yes
Its all good my listening to my butt has done me pretty well ;). 
I’m at the beach and very happy from the profit, still bullish af
Who doesnt want to long the top of a rising wedge /s
Dead cat bounce dude. Even if we go to 30k its a dead cat bounce before 1k man. Learn some TA
Is that the extent of your TA? What are the indicators that say it's going up? I'm seeing a rising RSI since the 9th of June on the daily. This is bullish, but I'm shit at TA. That's why I come here. Your comment is giving me nothing though.
That's actually what I find most funny about it. Probably the dudes DID write it last week, and badgered the editors to let it run, every damn day.

Who knows. They might be prophets yet... 
Should take at least a week to confirm. I was thinking it would be more like 2-3 weeks.
Well even I don't cut the wicks, the bottom line is still descending, albeit barely 
I feel genuinely ashamed for trying.
It actually fooled me into thinking it had become obligatory, and a few days later when I noticed I could opt out again I started to get used to it.

I seem to recall the same thing happening a long while back.

Fool me once....
That had higher lows back in April. Not really a bull flag. 
If this bull flag breaks up I'll be inclined to believe that we have a true reversal on our hands. We haven't had any decent sized bull flag break out to the upside in months.
Do you think we're heading back down below 6000 after that?
I've never considered this and haven't seen it happen before. Will the 200ma suddenly become attainable? 
Looks like we literally just broke out of that
Just as I wanted to agree with you we started to break the flag and now we broke the trend.

Looks like something has changed.
Fakeout. 

To break the wedge we need to stay ABOVE the resistance line. 

Classic bulltrap imo.
yeah that was more just a good enough high number. But if price is still up but no one tries the breakout trade, for me it feels a bit bad
yeah, if you had a long before 6500 it's nice to hold  on to it
I’m confused why people were calling 6400 a bear flag. Are you talking about on the larger time scale? Because by all accounts it seemed to be a bull flag.
Volume looks like it's trending up, too.
That is beyond my knowledge.  I have become a somewhat old and tired and lazy trader.  But you are likely making a very good point.
yep 
The dumping has likely not ended.
Yup that sentiment hasnt changed. I even put an /s at the end of my comment and you still took it literally. *facepalm
"People" aren't buying unless you mean a handful of people who spike the price up 5% in 1 minute.
HAHA!!
if it goes down there ill happily buy more.  but if not I'm happy with my positions.   Risky trade to expect lower prices imo.  Coinbase custody announcement today is a catalyst and i wouldn't be surprised if we get some more positive news over the next few weeks that keeps that price above 6k.  
I take it you sold the top then?
Shitposts get downvoted.  Just the way it is.  "Bears" are up 65% over the past few month.
I always assume it is being used sarcastically by bulls (based off the bubble psychology cycle chart). The real (and by real i mean possible trend reversal) sucker rally starts when 7800 breaks.
Sucker’s rally after sucker’s rally but he is being sarcastic? Where have you been the past few mos.?
You're a lunatic. Not everyone is like that. Longs can be squeezed but after drop from ATH they're more careful about that. Don't see over leveraged longs on finex. They moved to Mex...
Lol I get liquidated in the 4.5k range


Squeeze me if you can!
This is the first resistance when the daily inside bar will break up

edit oh no it's 490€
It always is... Until it isn't. 
Thanks, I sort of assumed this would be the case
What does "having" the BCash mean though? Didn't all BTC holders theoretically have access on Aug 1st? If using a custodial service that didn't provide access until later on, which date do you use? If you're using a wallet that didn't update to support BCash for a while, which date is your "access" date?
Or, maybe, up 3x from this time last year. But go ahead and and compare all prices to the blow off top, makes you sound real cool to all the other bears. 
No, what I am saying is an actual question; in prior bubble pops is what we are seeing typical, or indicative, of anything? I want to keep making money here and I think that information would be useful. 
Ha, nerd. I will let you have that thought, but translated to the real world it is amusing to me. 
Well, it seems mean spirited now rather than collegiate and plastic. Now it seems like you have people married to positions, identity politics. 

People so underwater or high up on their positions that their cognitive dissonance results in outright delusion and a mental construct that prevents objective analysis. 
This'll take at least 2 weeks to play out.
Done 
Okay
I went 200x $999MM at 5749. 
"few", "so many"...whatever.  It doesn't really matter.  But a relief rally was due and this one is not at all shocking.
The switch flipping is what has to get shaken out of this market for it to become mature, it reeks of desperation and gambling.  
I'd say it's slightly better than 50-50 this will break 6800 in the next week. 21-day SMA has been broken, and on the weekly timeframes at least, overall bull trend is still intact. Daily close over 7K? 50-50 by end of July. I think it's more than likely this will reverse at 8K and head back down again to retest 5800 by end of summer. 

Just what I'm thinking right now
Not a double or triple bottom until we break 10k or 11.8k.
I thought that triple bottoms weren't common, but breaks of support on the third try were? Is there any credence to that or was it nonsense?
Yes of course "perhaps".   5% chance of that is perhaps.,
Yes let me spend a few hours going through posts and collecting multiple examples for you.  That sounds like a great use for my time.
Yes agreed about that.  And many are calling it the end of the bear market.  Not sure if it is "so many" or not because that is vague and says nothing.
> You’re convinced the bear market is not over 

Your reading comprehension leaves a lot to be desired.
Good call, I did the same adding at 6200 except I was holding an underwater long from 6600 (whew). Congrats on the judgement!
It’s definitely starting to feel this way ... let’s see how far buyers will push this...

I’ve been watching for that 10k line break and thought we might need to wait a bit longer... shorters would be well advised to exit now and wait this one out
coinbase vault? so much good news eaten by the bear? This could be a full on reversal.
So you're saying you heard it here first?
Buyers who who sold high w/ Fiat & Tether sitting on the sidelines are thinking to themselves “it may be time to buy back rather than waiting for that 3k which may never come. Mainstreet Joe, Worldwide is thinking.... “Hmmm, looks like the bottom & I could tripple my $$$”....
Just pumping his holdings 
He genuinely believes he has magical powers to see the future.  I had to report his post, so I could block him.  Just boring nonsense.
“You merely adopted the bear market, I was born in it...”
noone is saying this thing is going to break ATH. 

for me I'm looking at this as a relief rally to $8,500 and then we see if this thing has legs 
5700-6680 is not $300 it's a nearly $1,000 and more than 15%. Also, how is it "fraudulent" lmfao.

With that said, I'm not convinced the bear is over either.
Those darn fraudulent pumps! They aren't really happening!
Zoom out just one more month. We're not down, and, yes, Virginia, that is a gargantuan bull pennant you see. Oh, and we're up $800 since Friday, not $300.
Your statement is simply wrong on so many levels that it's hard to know where to start. We had 5 weeks that doubled the cryptomarketcap from April 1 to May 6. The recent bounce was not $300, but $1000, etc.
>The price has been steadily declining for 7 months

That is exactly why some people think that cycle will come to a close soon and there will be upwards price movement again. Whether you like it or not, that's what typically has happened in the past. I'm not saying that's guaranteed, but your point doesn't actually make the point you think it makes.  
Bollinger W and Triple Bottom reversal patterns look like this.

edit:spelling
Yeah suckers rally, totes brah
Eh, he was just giving us the benefit of his hindsight given the past reasoning and present information.  It's not about "calling it" but how you deal with the calls.
I did not make losses in any of these two trades, only gains. I am just trying to be as objective as possible. This is not an ideal place to go long.

Do you think it is? I provided my reasons. You provide yours
What has your ROI been since January 1st of this year?

(You can find out by looking at how much btc you have made and how many btc you started with. If you started with 1 and now have 1.3 you made 30&#37;)
You clearly have a good track record with your short calls.  Why wouldn't you go net short and make more profits/BTC/fiat when you feel the price is going to drop?    I'm not sure why you would have been so uncomfortable being net short in a bear market that is down 67% in the last several months.
It has always traded at a premium, but today that went up. This is absolutely bullish because either: a) somebody knows something or b) a lot of people want in now and are willing to pay a bigger-than-usual premium. Either way, demand for actual Bitcoin will be on the upswing either from a whale who intends to buy a fuckton and make money on this little side bet or from many minnows who bought GBTC today and will buy the real thing as soon as their money gets to Coinbase.

We're going up. It's pretty obvious to me at this point. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe the Mad Dumper wants to waste more money selling Bitcoin at a loss. He's been doing it for six months so why should he stop now, right?
Just looking out for you son. I'm so proud of you.
Agreed and add to that the volume declining on the last few dumps plus decent volume on the bounce up. If this pops up with volume expanding I think a move above 7K is more likely than 5.5K.
Blog.coinbase.com
(sorry, I'm having issues copying a bloody link) 
I think 6.5K are too tight yes, this could flag down a bit before breaking upwards. Or you know, break downwards completely after some serious sideways.

I usually set my stops at breakeven after a trade has moved in my favor, if it keeps moving I adjust for a bit of profit taking in case it moves against me. For example, I'm long from CA 6K and moved stops to 6100, if this hits 6100 it means the relief rally is over. But in my opinion this could break down to 6300, confirm support and keep going up.
The downward channel is sitting at around 6.5 so it's really precarious if it is tested.  I'd close here versus 6.5.  (which I just did on a long that was about the same as yours).  6.4 at least would have a higher chance of surviving that test, but may as well open a new position there right?

But I have another position currently sitting at 6250, so it's easier for me to not be married to the one that I scalped.

Lately I have the same feeling as you about BE stops in this sort of situation.  Have wasted so much time and potential profits wash trading.
I saw that post too.  

Man, where are the balls I had when I was gambling to catch bottom while it was still in the process of going down on the 28th. If you're gonna do that, you gotta do it again until it works to make it pay off! (horrible, horrible advice)  (actually I didn't have enough liquid to try again comfortably hah, and this time I'm in nice safe and boring positions)
Yeah I read that. Was pretty happy to see some logic for entry we could see 15k before bottom.
[removed]
Good point 
> sound money

> Austrian framework.

lmao
Medium term bullish. It's up to time and the market to assign an appropriate value of the ATH. We got ahead of ourselves, now we grind our way to  fair value.
I traded the double bottom following a trend line break on BTC short term. Not ATH, just a strong bounce to higher levels. Up to maybe 8.5k and bear trend still intack
Definitely a handful of bag holders out there trying to get the fuck out of crypto. They most likely have lost face and bought into the hype for a quick 2000% return and don’t see it having a future 
Yet I think a lot of those people will feel scared to sell when they get back to BE, in case it might not go back significantly down.  Real hard to not double-think this scenario.
price has nothing to do with the fundamentals. Price is all hype. Nobody knows what a bitcoin is worth, except the market. And the market has cycles of caring, and not caring.
The existential crisis is that bitcoin is doing better than it was at $19k but it just hit a near 8 month low
Agree. Everyone is fine saying you can’t use the past as an indicator when it’s opposite 
While there isn't a Mt Got equivalent, Bitcoin isn't exactly delivering on any promises. The public is smarter than before and needs to see at least some evidence that crypto will be adopted en masse.
True. If I were a bear, I'd be scared.
On your momz dick.
On top of that, he's had the patience to not enter until his targets, and the balls to actually enter then when the feeling of the movement is icky and counter intuitive at the moment.
I mean honestly looks like we are starting to have the same pattern before 6600... 
Nah I done sold my long w success so I’m deciding if I should short?
Your SL around 6560/70?
Haha I know bud, just having some fun, glad to have you back.
> And if covering my short could push the entire bitcoin market ~5%, then I honestly wouldn't even be mad about the loss. I'd be "rich bitch", so to speak.

Ever heard of a guy named MikeXBT?
Is it really that hard to fathom? 

The market has been undeniably bearish for all of 2018, and jumped 15% in ~72 hours. 

There's strong resistance just overhead between $6,800 and $7,000, and RSI is overbought on shorter timeframes. It's arguably the best shorting opportunity the market has presented in weeks. 
I'm learning a lot about risk management just going back through his comment history and marking the charts with his calls.
Thanks mate :)
thoughts on hidden bull div on 4 hr charts?
Maybe...maybe not.  There isn't anything behind guesses and anecdotal data on that.

But I personally don't have a problem with people buying drugs, regardless of whether or not it is legal in their jurisdiction.
ETH shorts should also stack up around 490. It would need a BGD from the ETH side to break through and drag BTC like it did when the SEC results came out.

Right now i see ETH just following BTC around but we never know.
> So if both get rejected at these points, how fucked are we?

hella
We may not be fucked, just might retest the recent lows again. 

As for the reversal signs, we already broke the linear and log downtrend resistance line from 10K, which is indicative of the downtrend slowing down. I would look for a break of 6.9K to go long. A lot of resistance above, though - the support of the big symmetrical triangle (which should now act as resistance) is at 7.2K at the moment (log scale). After that, I feel that the break of the 7.8K resistance would be significant. 
$12K should convince everyone of a reversal. In the meantime, many will keep getting rekt on shorts, unfortunately. 

We're not fucked unless by "fucked" you mean having to pay back a bunch of borrowed BTC.
I made a ninja edit. Sorry homie :)
Have you had a chance to review this:

https://coinlib.io/global-crypto-charts?theme=dark#global_money_flow

It's not certain that the flow of cash will stop when alts capitulate. It's fairly certain that alts will run for the first and best available door... which is BTC if Eth is falling. As far as I know, Tether isn't a practical avenue for most people to cash out to fiat.

Some percentage of people moving from alts to BTC will hold BTC. Even if it's a small percentage, that puts a fair amount of pressure on the supply side.

Good analysts will know how shorter and longer time frames intertwine and will trade accordingly. You can be both bearish and bullish at the same time and make money. 
That's not true. Ichimoku is strongest in a trending market and works best on higher time frames when all times frames are flashing either bearish or bullish signals. 

You will notice that "people who rebuke analysis" generally don't understand the analysis they're criticizing.
I think a good trader can't "adjust their analysts" to serve their emotions, sure you can probably get lucky and make a good call here and there but generally speaking such traders can't stay solvent for a long time, especially in such volatile market.
Agree, the 1W is mostly there to show the long-term trend IMHO.
Good call. Shorting in open fields is pretty dangerous. Always target resistances.
Yeah I added to my comment whilst you posted. I have shorted a fair way down from $10k in February, but have change my sentiment to neutral now. I know you rode a big short down and have been bearish, so seeing you comment along these lines is an interesting change in sentiment.
Part of me agrees with that wedge (especially \~6.8k being resistance), but part of me thinks the bull divs on longer time frames + breaking the channel take precedence here. Volume profile also doesn't quite fit the wedge. Still leaning towards holding my long until we confirm the meme triangle as resistance.
2 fakeouts on one line basically invalidates it.

I agree with 6.8, but I don't think 6.6 will be good short entry until we break that wedge down.
Yes, the more you zoom in, the more touch points you can find.
You’re still holding that long from $470?

Get the hell out of that 
The step to 7.2k
We just set a new high for today.

Looks like the magnet is in full force 
Ok if you are expecting it to go up, then certainly not playing with fire.  I didn't realize that is what you expected.

It's totally safe to go long at 6K the next time we are down there.


Kind of a lot good, or kind of a lot bad from your side?
And thank you for the feedback on the images. 
GRRRRRRRRR!!!!!
In your friend's case, they probably just need to have a a positive total.
If you are going to shadowban accounts based on some arbitrary metrics then you should make that policy public.

And I hope anybody with any longevity in the bitcoin space would understand why those in the community might take exception to any kind of censorship of ideas.
after $12,500 or so we'll see some pretty crazy fomo. 

And once $20,000 goes down, all the normies will be in for the run up to $100,000
this is crypto, we can be there in a few days. But it'll probably take a couple of weeks 
We will get there, together!
lol glad you managed to follow it in the end.  My communication skills seem be deteriorating these days.
Taco money?
Heh, yeah. Who knew. Well, diy knew, but a broken clock is right twice a day. 
I'll be shorting 6750 if we get there. I'm not over-eager to enter a position, though.
Clearly you do and no problem with that. However if you openly state you see no reason for a lower price, at this stage.. You're going to get people reply :) 
Are we back already at the dumps are manipulated pumps are organic?
Can you imagine someone waiting that long lol 
No prob bob!
Yep, Gdax volume has been significantly lower, but now it’s roughly 50% down since the switch. I’d speculate to say that traders are are disenchanted w/ the UI and have moved elsewhere. Perhaps the last of the humans have left, leaving the bots and trades being made from the Coinbase App.

Edit: Maybe, I’m wrong and volume was just very low over the weekend switchover & traders finally signed up from Gdax. Volume is close to where it was last week...still difficult to use.
You are strong on the ad hominem rhetorics. Pretty empy on the rest.
If TA is bullshit, why have people in this sub been so successful using it to trade the market? 

Do you think we all just trade off our gut feeling? 
Falling Wedge (Reversal)

I don't think this means what you think it means.

No, he is right. Those are 2 stupid questions. First one is easy to google, second one is obviously... a question written without brain usage at all.

So, he is not trolling. You just successfully made a fool out of yourself.
side ways for 2 full days with no follow through, i think a big dump is likely coming today
Lol. Seems to be a deluge of new / random users I've never seen before. In fairness I only joined reddit in Nov 2017 specifically to join this sub. 

I'm pretty much ignoring posts from anyone except for those I recognise from the last 6 months. I don't have the energy to go through post histories to determine which users are fake / idiots.

If this sub is to grow in numbers, not sure what the solution is to welcoming new users and identifying genuine users willing to learn vs other ill intentions.

Perhaps this sub doesn't need to grow and we should hard fork off. Lol.
So? New people come, old people go, why not focus on the post? Will the sub turn into scrutinization, accusation, and asking for motivations of every new poster here? If so I'm out.
Hello, old friend. Nice to see a familiar face from time to time.

You you're meaning the bear flag down from $7600? You're comment is confusing because you said bull flag. Did you mean bear?
On many exchanges you have the option to hide your limit buy order. You obviously cannot see them beforehand. You recognize them when you observe the orderbooks, do not see any visible buy orders, yet alot of BTC get sold and the price does not go down. You can somewhat calculate how big the hidden buy wall was afterwards if it does completely get eaten.
What website is that? Maybe cryptowatch is buggy right now

EDIT: Bitcoinwisdom.com

Hmm I see
Volume actually isn’t terrible. It’s maintaining pretty well and is up from this morning 
Absolutely. 

Don't get me wrong, long-ing off this momentum wouldn't be the dumbest idea, but stop-losses are absolutely essential and you still stand a good chance of getting BARTed out of your position. 

But I (and the trend) says this is all happening well within the confines of a long-term trend. 
I am mostly reflecting on action in the bear market, since the ATH. Recently the level at which people are willing to buy at more than anemic levels is getting lower and lower.
fair enough :) Enjoy your sun!

To paraphrase Terry Pratchett: "He's a very clever young man, but it's dead cats all the way down..."
Why would a dead cat land at 1k level. It needs to be buried, *under the ground* or follow his soul *up to the heavens*.
> Learn some TA

You forgot your /s. 

Takes some balls to say that to one of the more successful traders on this sub. 

There is legitimate reason for optimism up to the 7500-8000 range. Call that a DCB if you like, but it's a very tradeable range. No need to attack other members of the community though.
Check my post history, I’ve offered more than enough TA today.

Every comment I make doesn’t need to give extensive reasoning. 
I shared a similar wedge about a month ago, and yeah, i think this is one situation where you wait either buy the bottom of the wedge with tight stop losses, or buy the confirmation on breakout because the overall trend is bearish. There should be increasing buying volume on the bottom of the wedge before the breakout, which simply hasn’t happened yet. My personal view is also that we’re getting a lot of rounded tops and sharp bottoms, which likely means we are experiencing more buyer exhaustion than seller exhaustion at this point. Either way, I sincerely doubt this was _the_ bottom, but it could be worth revisiting this formation on the next trip down.
Sorry? Can you explain a bit more? I don't quite understand.

I was referring to april 20th to april 23rd. Is that not a bull flag?
We haven't had any decent sized bull flag break out to the upside in months.

To be fair, we literally haven't had a decent bull flag (like this one) in months.
Next time we break 10K, we won't be looking back.
201th day, yes. If it was lower on the day before the 200th.
$5800,$6100,$6200 

Still don’t want to watch my profits disappear 
I meant to type bull flag. 

I guess im so used to seeing bear flags it’s instilled in my brain.  It was 100% a bull flag. Fixed the typo lol 
Oh no I knew you were being sarcastic, lol sorry if what I posted went over your head. My point is that of course someone who couldn't even conceptualize a reversal would call any buying inorganic. 
I think you'll find they are human, therefore they are people :)

So are you saying anyone buying in sufficient bulk to have a market effect doesn't count?

(i.e. most likely stemming from Coinbase's custodian service they announced today with 10 new clients)
That’s still people 
> if it goes down there ill happily buy more. 

Maybe, maybe not.  People lie to themselves every day in this sub

> Risky trade to expect lower prices imo. 

I expect both lower prices and higher prices, as usual.

>  i wouldn't be surprised if we get some more positive news over the next few weeks that keeps that price above 6k.

I wouldn't be surprised by that either. I also wouldn't be surprised by more bad news that pushes the price back below 6k.
bears who keep doubling down and holding their shorts through a reversal, usually end up losing all the gains they made

so do me a favor, set your stop loss at 50% of your total gains, so you can walk away with at least something 
Continuing the joke.
BFX's max leverage is 3.3x anyway. Even shorts can't really be "squeezed" by liquidation.

Even the BGD from 7k to 8k wasn't a liquidation squeeze. Shorts opened at 6.4k wouldn't have been liquidated until over 8k. It's more just cascading stop losses and FOMO that causes the squeezes.

Any time longs or shorts get overextended it's just more likely for a stop loss squeeze to rapidly close a bunch of open positions, like an avalanche. I don't understand why people ever reference liquidation levels when talking about a squeeze, a ton of liquidations is never the reason for it.
The day you were first able to control it.  For example, if your bcash came from coinbase the value would be the day coinbase allowed you to withdraw it after they pumped. 

Basically it’s the value you used to pay your taxes on the airdrop when you received the bcash. 
So if you're talking about BCash held by an exchange for example, I would argue that the holding period doesn't begin until they've given you the BCash. Since the BTC on the exchange was technically in their wallet the BCash was never yours to begin with since you didn't hold the key. 

This also jives with the IRS' concept of constructive receipt and is the more conservative approach. 

It would be hard to argue that you owned something when it was really just owed/promised to you. Since you did not actually have ownership at the time (and thus did not bear the risks associated with such ownership) then it would be hard to argue that your holding period began on 8/1/17. 


Only lost 65% of your money now...Time to celebrate !
>Is it normal when a speculative bubble is deflating to see such fitful trading behavior?

If this was your original question.

Yes, until the buyers and sellers find an equilibrium. Sometimes the bubble pop and return to the mean is smoother or swifter. Sometimes its slow.

I would suggest with crypto, the massive &#37; gains (and massive &#37; losses from those that bought at 12k+) make the bubble pops that much more aggressive. The sudden drop in volume and how much the market is subject to market whales in the aftermath (people are spooked now more easily than in a bull run) gives us the current violent up/down bubble deflation. 

That's been my view of it anyway. It's also why I think crypto is very much a market where new buyers get shook out very easily. Also:

>... no mechanism in place for new dollars entering our space ...

Not all new bull runs/markets require a kickstart or logical reason to begin. You'll only see the BUY BUY BUY signal in hindsight. 

There are the exact same means of entering the market now as there were in late 2017. If the narrative suddenly started changing from:

*BTC went up to 20k and crashed hard to 6k!*

To

*BTC was 20k at one point... and it's only 6k now. Wow.*

Then the market sentiment switches. Until then, everyone wants to catch the bottom, whilst no one wants to get caught holding the bags on another leg down.
Yeah, that’s true. It makes sense though. It’s really not that easy to separate emotions from the market. I haven’t even fully been able to do that.
I can agree with this. A test of $7800-8600 in the long run. I’m not liking the current action now when it comes to painting a bull flag for next leg up, looks like a bart flag in the making. 

If we break $8600 with volume I’ll be erect. 
Do we have to rocket up through a certain threshold to confirm a triple bottom? Or could we just steadily increase as well?

If we're at 9k in 6 months... and never dipped below $6k again until we got there... wouldn't that confirm what we're witnessing over the past few days as a triple bottom?

Serious question.
If there are "so many" why would it take hours?

edit: you get my point here, sorry for belabouring. You've been calling for this relief rally the whole time too, so do just want to say well done there.
I guess I wouldn't really know, I'm staying out of other crypto subs.

Even I avoided this place during last weekend.
Eventually I would like to swap short. Although I did this on the entire way up from 6.4-10k and got murdered, a sweet short entry would be nice. 

I’ll wait until we hit some heavy resistance points, knock on the doors a few times and fail, then swap short. Otherwise, I’ll close 50% of long at $6800 and let rest ride 
What’s coinbase vault, this is new news to me 
*Custody. 
That 8K range is a great time for momentum to shift, certainly could be right back down again
It's fraudulent because he's short.
Last 30 days down 13%.  Looks terrible.
This market is so delusional that outright scam ICOs/coins still hold value.  Additionally, if the bottom was reached, it was substantially higher than previous historical bottoms.  
no that is definitely not what happened in the past. 
https://i.imgur.com/sGbOIXe.png
True, but he is obviously waiting for a correction that might never come, wishing to rebuy in at lower prices. It is an emotional play. Cardinal sin of trading.
I believe BTC moves on an extremely accelerated market cycle and do believe we have seen the worst. Of course I might be wrong, but a 71% retrace from 20k is good enough for me. We are talking about a global asset here, which in itself is unprecedented. 



I have been in this market for some time, and to me the risk has always been on missing out, not the market tanking. I have created excel models utilizing Fisher's Equation (a measure of utility) incorporating many different qualitative growth assumptions. 



I could go on and on justifying my case for some positive price action, but in reality I don't care about the price tomorrow or in a week. I ***FIRMLY*** believe that within a year BTC will far outperform any other possible investment I have access to, thus I am buying. 



Best of luck. 



Edit: I didn't mean to be hostile obviously in my first reply :)
I've been logging all my trades in the position tracker bot for the past few months:

https://www.anotherbot.info/history.php?user=_chewtoy_

Right now I'm about at about 350% ROI against the market if you just go by the position bot. 

Going back to August 2017 my ROI is somewhere north of 5,000% 
Despite the fact that I've been shorting my brains out since $20K, I'm not naive enough to think that the bear market is going to last forever. 

I certainly _think_ the market will remain bearish for at least a few more months, but I've been wrong plenty of times before. 

And once the bottom is found, the market will very likely pull an abrupt 25% to 50% green 1d or 3d candle to culminate the event. 

Avoiding being insta-rekt by a sudden pump is my number-one priority.
I'm not Chewtoy, but I'll say this: he has a good track record with his short calls, but it's important to remember that those calls were made knowing he was going from 1x long to flat. Would he have made the same calls if he was going into a net-short position? Probably not. It's like saying to a baseball player, well you hit singles really well, just swing harder to make them into homeruns. If the batter starts trying to hit homeruns, his whole approach will change.
Go big or go home. 

If it was looking more like a bart flag than a bull flag, I could see why being hesitant on a long could be easy.  But the bull flag was too amazing.

We could also paint another perfect one here, which i would be looking to add another long around $6525-$6550

What's so funny? Do you not understand what [money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money) is or something?
Just wanted to make a visible comment that I support you here. Fucking lel
I see. Nicely played. So above 8.5 on this bounce is a reversal you think?
> The public is smarter than before

I don't know about that -- history suggests that 'the public' is perpetually dumber than a box of rocks.  As soon as the nightly news starts up again with the stories about how Jimmy Gas Pumper made two million on Bitcoin they'll come racing back in.
Done!
She told me that's what she uses when she sticks that double header dildo up your ass 😆
SL for the hedge around 6880 stop on the long hasn’t moved. Trying to let that baby ride past 7k and beyond. 
You might be able to move a single exchange 5% with a few $million if the liquidity is low enough, but moving the entire market that much requires a lot more fiat than even he is slinging around. 
I ... guess that's fair.

I'm definitely not advocating a long position being opened here. And I definitely don't deny the bearish market nor the massive spike. But I see the sells being bought up around 6.6k and the start of yet-another-bull-flag and I don't think the r/r is worth it. I'd much rather sit out of any position. Fully and absolutely prepared to eat my words.
Yes, I have. My point is that the flow of cash would reverse in the situation you're describing.

During the bull run BTC *benefited* from the cash flow into alts as, for instance, if you want to buy XMR with cash you buy BTC then buy XMR => demand for BTC from fiat.

If XMR (example) then capitulates, all those people are fleeing XMR back into BTC then back into fiat => supply for BTC from fiat. I believe this has been ongoing through the whole bear market as the illiquid alts have already fallen a great deal more than the more liquid high cap coins (essentially BTC/ETH).

Bitcoin benefited from the alt market; and if the alt market completely capitulates (or continues to) it will suffer more as well. I think it's solid to argue there are a fair number of people that bought BTC solely as a way to get to various alts as speculation, and even more who would simply sour on the entire crypto asset class in general due to a bad experience in alts despite originally liking BTC as well.

Some moving from alts to BTC will hold BTC, but that BTC was already being held. I've never subscribed to the notion that "BTC supply = BTC supply" whether it's on the alt side or not. With relation to coins with a relatively liquid fiat on ramp, like eth, you have an argument. Against other alts I think it's a very asymmetrical relationship. A person selling BTC for alts would not have that BTC for sale for fiat at the same time - it's the complete opposite action in terms of risk.

In other words: Person A has 10 BTC, person B 100 Alt. Person A is willing to sell the BTC for Alt but, naturally given his apparent appetite for risk, would never have that BTC for sale for fiat. Person B is capitulating and just wants out; he buys the 10 BTC for his alt. That 10 BTC is then immediately sold for fiat.

To take it further (and admittedly more speculative): The alt, given that it's capitulating, decreases in price further. The next time Person A wants to buy back for BTC to hold (his risk appetite has decreased but still not enough to exit the space completely) he cannot buy back 10 BTC so there is net BTC added to the supply in the Fiat<=>BTC relationship.

It's a bit too easy to read that as "Ichimoku simply confirms something that is already obvious" 
> Ichimoku is strongest in a trending market and works best on higher time frames when all times frames are flashing either bearish or bullish signals.


Can you back that up with statistical evidence? 



>You will notice that "people who rebuke analysis" generally don't understand the analysis they're criticizing.

I just explained why analysts using the same tools contradict each other. If you ever spent some time backtesting algorithmic TA trading strategies, you also know that these small adjustments matter a lot. Obviously there is no golden rule for optimal setup, so everyone just uses their own to justify their current position.

This is a simple fact about TA, not a criticism, but sure, it is too complex for me to understand ... :)
TA is made to be broken. So you create a position, you use tools and charts to support your position, and then you set up checkpoints in the chart movement meaning when the chart does this, I as a trader do that. 

If the chart smashes through an overhead resistance and I'm bullish then I may add capital. If it drops below a short term support then I may prepare myself to take a small loss and try to lower my cost basis by re-entering at a lower price (hopefully also adding to my stack). TA isn't a fool proof system but it gives you little hints and red flags/green flags for when to enter and exit a position. Great book to read for traditional chart patterns in technical analysis is "Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets" by John Murphy.
If I was in a long from below, I'd probably be inclined to hold it. Maybe position bias, but there's an x-factor of trading that come from having what *could* be a great entry and avoiding overtrading. 

I'm looking to short between 6650-6750, but only hedge short. Shorting >6650 and cutting on a break of 6850 is a pretty good r/r for someone currently out of position. I'll happily take the 3% hit if it means we're reversing trend. 
> 2 fakeouts on one line basically invalidates it.

Agreed--I'm just saying I'll take the trend + a solid 4hr formation in the case this is a fakeout of our new downtrend line. 
But, but... Reversal, moon, ATH... Breaking lines and stuff... /s

I know, you are right, i should have closed it on this last pre-bart fake out but was driving. Will set stops around 465-470 just in case and try to close it if it goes up again. 
Heh, missed my first add by $6. Oh well. Probably will still hit. 
No good, I liked the variety.  A mix of news and TA at various scales, and the Buy Markets Percentage thing is interesting as it's key timing to mention it.
Got it. Thanks for the answer jaredaj!
The issue this sub has is with ban evasion. Requiring 30 karma or a 1 month old account with positive karma isn't hidden information and it's not extreme or censorship.
he wasn't the only one ;)
Yeah, I entered just because mex was lagging like $100 on this move up so I thought it's worth a shot with a small scalp if I manage to execute position.

Now re-longed around 0,75x of the stack at 6560, gonna leave it ride for now, we broke the 10k downtrend.
No Problem if you reply. 

All Good
What’s your thoughts currently Richyboy? You’re one of the few I pay attention to. :-)
Neither are manipulate. All this dude peace throws around is "this was organic" "this is not organic" this was manipulated" etc. Just fuck off with this shit. You are a clueless fish dude. (not you, op)
Curious. How long do you actually think that’ll be? If you don’t mind sharing. 
That is not ad hominem, genius.
I stand corrected.
Actually you can tell him there's a low chance of the ETF being approved. So his second question isn't useless.

From what I've read, the ETFs are kind of a joke and generally not expected to be approved.
We've been hovering around 6,3k for almost three weeks now. There is absolutely no way to tell where this is going.
> I don't have the energy to go through post histories to determine which users are fake / idiots.

I will be light that guides you, my friend. 

>If this sub is to grow in numbers, not sure what the solution is to welcoming new users and identifying genuine users willing to learn vs other ill intentions.

This will be much worse once the bull returns. 

>Perhaps this sub doesn't need to grow and we should hard fork off. Lol.

I wouldn't be opposed to a smaller, more exclusive and much more regulated spin-off. Someone already grabbed /r/truebitcoinmarkets though.
I’m just pointing it out, that’s all 
[removed]
lol I feel like you’re trolling me, but this is starting to look more like a true bull flag on the 2hr timeframe. It seemed like we were forming a fractal of the price action before the dumps at $7800 and $6800, which is partly why I entered my short in the first place, and it could definitely just be a bear flag on the larger timescales. However, alts were bleeding as bitcoin went sideways at both of those points while they are pumping like crazy here. That makes me think something fishy may be going on, so I’m taking my profits just in case. I’m still not convinced this is a true reversal, just think it looks a bit odd.
Im betting on a huge buy wall @6300
use Bitfinex.com to see the most accurate  walls.. crypto watch has been bugged for months and is almost always inaccurate. 
Low volume would be more accurate not No volume. Is it really enough to pull us out of this downtrend? Idk about that. 
Lmao dude. I guess I did need the /s. You seem to realize it but still think I was attacking him? lol
I'd ignore him, he demands TA while he himself has never given any for all his bearish posts. Hypocritical at best. 
My bad. I don't check people's post history often. That said though, I just checked and you've offered no TA today.
Bull flags typically have lower highs and lower lows. 

We were trending up between the 20th and 23rd. 

http://www.chartpatterns.com/flagsandpennants.htm
We were about to "fly through 10k with no resistance" a few weeks ago according to you, right?
Well IIRC you took some during the previous bull flag before your confidence increased and you added back.

So though your right about the profits potentially disappearing, it's not as if you'll have blatently let it slipped away.  Think you've done everything possible that you could do, and correct, in the situation.
Lol okay buddy. If you really think a 5% spike over all exchanges in a minute is organic, I can't help you at all.
> I think you'll find they are human, therefore they are people :)

That's why I put it in quotes, genius.

> So are you saying anyone buying in sufficient bulk to have a market effect doesn't count?

I'm saying what I said above, not any of your straw man nonsense.
Or bots
"Bears".....you are one of those people who rant about "Liberals" too, no doubt.

Those who short usually don't end up losing their gains.  Market is down 65% in the last few months and many of those who shorted are way up and have a lot of your money as well.

$6600...congratulations.
> why people ever reference liquidation levels 

it sounds more dramatic that way. people love drama
You don't pay taxes when you receive the air drop. You pay taxes when you sell or trade it, with the basis being $0. 
That makes sense (I guess) but what about the situation where you control the keys (let's say on your Trezor) but Trezor doesn't support BCash from day 1. You have access to the keys but don't have a turn-key (no pun intended) way to send your coins until Trezor provided the update. 
I knew I shouldn't have replied to you... Not worth it
Yeah I’d agree with all of that, seems self evident. Was curious if Barting was associated statistically with early or late stage bubble, or how it correlates to the last btc bubble aftermath. 

Relief rally could start with a sneeze but I disagree on the narrative that a simple news tone shift could usher in anything but a little short lived speculative pile on.  That is fine if you are scalping trades and stuff, which I have been non stop, but if you want to open a true long and leave it alone...big picture stuff. 

What I’m talking about are a set of circumstances that appear to be essentially required before there will be larger scale buy in. I don’t see us tapping into 401k fund action until there is definitive regulatory clarity regarding ICOs, there are Physical ETFs, tether is no longer debatable (and possibly not until regulatory arbitrage is sorted out). I am sure it will be a tumultuous process but barring the early investor type which we already had dipping their toes in a little bounce can only go so far. 
Yeah that's fair. I'm essentially just trading on the weekly timeframes anyways (or, at least, that's what I'm telling myself), so this is basically all still bullish for me and an opportunity to accumulate at decent prices besides. If we go below 5800 decisively I'll have to think long and hard about my overall strategy. 
Yes that is fair.  
There are no time constraints for confirming a triple bottom breakout. Only price constraints. 

The market needs to make a higher local high before it makes a lower local low to confirm the breakout. 

In this case a break above $11,700 before a break below $5,774.70. 

If the market remained between $5,775 and $11,699 for the next 10 years, the pattern would remain unconfirmed, but still intact. 
Not if we're only at 9k. The breakout of a triple bottom would be 11.8k.
Sounds reasonable ... I’d be completely shocked if this run breaks resistance from the giant continuation pennant (likely to take a few weeks)

If we move up that high I’ll open a high leveraged short

$6.8-$6.9 seems very plausible this week
Fully insured investing for institutional clients
errr sorry coinbase custody
Coinbase Custody (not vault) opened today with a waiting list. Took the first deposit yesterday. 
>  Additionally, if the bottom was reached, it was substantially higher than previous historical bottoms.

Yes, this is how Bitcoin works.
It’s funny. Bitcoin has made that pattern so many times in the past. People have shown that pattern 20 times over saying “bitcoin is dead, just look at that crash”. It’s always some clueless noobie sitting on the sidelines too. 

/r/buttcoin users have been around for years. I hope some of them invested and at least made some money.. or hopefully some of the early buttcoin users realized the missed potential and got in the crash this time around. You can sit on the sidelines and talk shit during bitcoins worst crashes, or you can invest, hold, and hope for the best. Buying into the past crashes have fared well for those who got in. I’d take the hopium over being a bitter piece of bear shit any day. 
Yeah, it should be way more visible on the WEEKLY chart after one day. Forget that we've been declining for like 8 weeks. 
Hmm good point.  Personally I think I wouldn't open a leveraged long here (anyway have one still that was opened at 5850), but if I did I would probably do one share here  (no not miss out) and scale in more through to a bit past 6500.

That's what I did earlier today for a new one at 6300, but the lower bids didn't hit.  Ended up adding after the breakout with a better ca than only playing the break out, and closed it up here. But I totally regret not just putting the whole stake in at once since it was a really confident move at the time. 
> the risk has always been on missing out

I think that rings really strong considering that a very large percentage of gains from BTC have only occurred over only a few days worth of timespan.  (there was a statistic thrown around here recently that I can't find)
So in short, ungrounded bullish conviction and some price modeling of BTC that never seems to work? No TA at all. How dare you call me out with that BS
how do i log mine in this bot?

Also, thats some damn good ROI, why arent you in the bitmex leaderboard?
>  Despite the fact that I've been shorting my brains out since $20K

You said above that you haven't been net short, except for a few days during the 70% drop, over several months.

I wasn't referring to a short position today. I asked why you haven't been confident to short (not hedge short, which is a flat position) over the past several months.

You clearly were on the right side of the market for the majority of this period, so why did you not short and make additional profits, beyond just avoiding losses to your cold storage.


This is probably a better explanation than the one I offered. 

Essentially, "if it ain't broke, don't fix it."
>  Would he have made the same calls if he was going into a net-short position?

Yes of course he would.  He analyzed the market correctly and opening a reasonable short position would make sense if you think the market is going to drop and that's why you have hedged your cold storage with a short.
It was such a perfect bull flag, I really wasted that clear signal.

Yeah I fucked up my december positon adding to it here, the CA is at 6550 now.  I'm considering closing it here if we don't continue pump up within the next hour, I should be able to reopen it lower.  It's safter as a scalp now.  The adds on the way up are still below where it is now, I should just be glad for a profitable scalp and leave it as that.

The sept (now 6250 from 5850 after a few give and takes) I'm not touching until we go further down on this flag, it's so perfectly safe right now even if it breaks down I won't lose (which is what I fucking said about the damn flag we broke out of...  this time...)

If this flag continues to hvae an upward slope though I won't have any confidence for another leg up...
[removed]
Apologies, I didn’t really direct my question. Where’s your long SL? I can’t seem to see it lol.
Yeah true. Every raindrop is part of the flood though. 
I haven't seen a compelling model that shows more than a net neutral impact on Bitcoin when it's used this way. Do you have one?

If you're buying with cash or an alt, you're still buying. Trading BTC for cash on exchange may impact the order books, but there should be a corresponding increase on the buy side. That those alts do not have their own systems of arbitrage set up will simply increase the demand for BTC in those markets, which is handled by way of arbitrage through Tether.

I don't actually believe there is much of any cash market for alts. That they trade into BTC or tether at all looks more like an expansion of credit to me... they're increasing liquidity without increasing supply. An exodus will have a slight or negligible increase demand on BTC and the market will arbitrage out either side of the order book with USDT. The net impact is just increased market dominance of USDT and Bitcoin.
😯😯😀
Ichimoku shows a range of trend data in an easy-to-navigate system. You can deride it if you like but that doesn't change the fact that without looking at the system, it's incredibly difficult to "see" the trend data that it shows, because the system calculates 5 data points and plots them across time. This is not easy to see without drawing the lines yourself manually (which would take a long time) or turning on the indicator. 

Your argument could be made against MACD, other MA's or really any other indicator. 

The whole point of the cloud system is that it shows you short and medium term trend relative to each other and draws it all out automatically so it's easy to use and easy to see.
Well cool, thanks for the clarification and feedback.  

Is there something in the sidebar or rules that describes these requirements publicly?

It's a terrible experience for new users of the forum to have their ideas just sit there and have no idea why. You are putting people off from using the community.
Ah, indeed we did. Interesting. 
this must be sarcasm.. no one pays attention to me! 
I'm really not sure, could be 3 months could be 12 months could be never.

If I'm being completely honest I don't really think it'll happen again but thats a pretty rare opinion around here
When an ETF is approved that is backed by btc, whenever that happens. 

That will result in the ETF buying btc and those of us who don't mind owning actual bitcoin and securing it ourselves both buying at the same time. Similar growth spikes were seen in stocks for the marijuana industry during ETF launches. 
What's the deal with that forum? Any relation to this one or the regular users here?
I wasn't trolling, it's just weird that you referred to "something being off" about the bull flag when you actually mean that you think the bull flag might play out. As in you think something might be *right* about the bull flag, i.e. it's going to go up. 
Hidden ofcourse, for the bulls to charge up.
Glad to hear it. I'm not as familiar with you as I am with /u/coingurrruu

Absolutely 0. 
Then you didn't check. 
I’ve definitely traded this range well. 

Considering closing 50% here 
Good talking to you bud, good luck going forward
its obvious that you are new here, otherwise you'd know that I'm not married to my positions. If its going down I short. If its going up I go long. 
Ranting about liberals and their idiotic policy proposals is completely justified though, ranting about bears, not so much

Haha I was gonna write the same thing you did..Then I saw his other comments and well...this guy has fucked up hard somewhere and is taking it out here..
I think what I'm asking is... does a triple bottom need to end with a breakout to be called a triple bottom?

What if we just slowly slid up to say $12k then over the next 2 years?

It's a higher high (but not local anymore because it's so far out).

I suppose all of this is just pointless semantics really...

I just like to try and understand the true definition of every word that I use.

Thanks for the help!
In terms of %, obviously....
Mathematically more people have lost money in bitcoin than have made money.  How many average people do you think it took to make all those bitcoin millionaires?
Failing to close a long is no different from opening one. So in effect by not closing your long you are doing the same as someone that's opening a long.
Exactly. If you are bullish mid-long term, buy. Because short term windows oftentimes close extremely quickly. Take profit on the way up, re-enter upon crashes. Not rocket science. 
There's instructions at the top of the page for logging trades. 

As for the Mex leaderboard, I actually might be! I've never checked it really to be honest. 

My chewtoy persona isn't attached in any way to my Mex account. 
We're getting into a bit of a semantic argument here, so it's quite likely this will not be a super productive discourse. But I'll do my best. 

When I talk about whether I'm opening a long position or opening a short position, I'm always talking exclusively about what I'm doing with my trading account at any given time. What effect that may or may not have on my cold storage coins is pretty irrelevant — in my opinion anyhow. Although you may disagree there. 

As to why I'm not shorting more, I'd again point to the leverage I'm using in relation to my trading account and ignore my cold storage for a moment. 

I'm shorting at 10x leverage with 100% of my trading account. Which is already very high. It allows for approximately a 9.5% move against my position before I'm liquidated. Adding leverage would add risk, and lower my liquidation point. 

"But chewtoy, your risk would increase, but so would your profits!"

This is definitely true, but I'm a successful trader...not a wizard. All it takes is one bad call to wipe my entire trading stack. 

"But Chewtoy, if your trading stack gets wiped, you could just move coins from your cold storage and start over."

yes, this is 100% true. However, I don't like losing BTC whenever I can avoid it. If I were to break down my success as a trader, I'd attribute 30% of that to my ability to read the market and 70% to my ability to manage risk.   

EDIT: For example, if somebody said they were opening a 10x long position, would you question whether they were "actually" 10x long because they still have money in their checking/savings account that needs to be factored in? 

They have $100,000 in their 401K, after all. Aren't they technically less than 1x long then?
Well said. The upward slope would look more like a bart flag to me where Ide probably close my long and swap short.

Best is to re evaluate in a few hours. I dont see us immediately dropping down here 
My S/L is basically my liquidation around 5750. I’m looking to hedge an equal position size so I’ll still have my profits if it were to go all the way back to the lows. 

I’m expecting a retrace that doesn’t go below 6000 again and then some more bullish movements beyong 7k though.
I do agree that arbitrage considerations greatly complicate the matter. 

I've been somewhat thinking about a model that attempts to look at cash flow (similar to the coinlib one) but discriminates between flow out/in. For instance. Alt/BTC ratio decreasing would have an arrow going from alt -> BTC with the arrow thickness showing volume. Then I'd like to compare the relative amounts during bull trends and bear trends and see if the "Alt -> BTC" arrows have a large piece of the BTC pie compared to what you would expect coming from tether arbitrage. Unfortunately I simply don't have time to code it up (and honestly don't really feel quite *that* strongly about it to do so when I'm already doing SW development full time).
AutoMod does not prevent new subscribers from posting.
I like your thoughts :) 
Much appreciated and while an opinion that is both rare and one that I don't subscribe to, a divergence in opinions is how markets are made and operate. 
> If I'm being completely honest I don't really think it'll happen again but thats a pretty rare opinion around here

That's because your understanding of Bitcoin fundamentals and economics is severely lacking. I've attempted to elucidate for you the reasons why Bitcoin is here to stay but you seem uninterested in trying to learn the fundamentals. 
I'm rather cynical here on the ETF issue. In that such a launch would be a retail play, I do not see that happening until the time institutional investors have achieved their own collective positioning which I know from my "day job" is currently on going. 
It's for Bilderberg & Illuminati Bitcoin traders.
Hahah yeah I guess you’re right, I didn’t even realize I was making this assumption. I’ve been fooled by so many bull flags breaking down and ascending wedges breaking up lately that I guess I’ve been conditioned to expect the opposite of what they’re supposed to indicate.
Well, if you can manage to scalp each plateau, you'll have played this shit like a symphony.

If you do take some here, maybe precalculate how much you can add back in this same range without bringing your ca above 6400.  (then hopefully you end up adding that around 6500 instead of here or one level up)

Edit: glad I closed my other long to fulfill that scalp for this plateau so I'm not stuck deciding to mess with the one still open.
I like you. :)
This. Exactly this.  The safest method, IMHO, is to assume that forks represent an "*accession to wealth".*  In this scenerio, the basis price is the price of the asset when all three tests first passed.  In the coin base situation, Its either 2k-ish (when people could trade it), or north of 4k (when people could start withdrawing it).

If this is later ruled an incorrect interpretation by the IRS, then one can file and get a refund for tax over-payment. If this interpretation is used by the IRS and one doesn't pay, then one can pay the tax plus penalties and interest.  Particularly in the case of Coinbase -- which has already been compelled to identify the trades and assets of its users once, the prudent move (IMHO) is to pay and hope to get the money back.
TECHNICALLY, YOU DON'T LOSE MONEY IF YOU DON'T SELL.
Mathematically that’s not mathematical. Though again, it’s funny, people said **the exact same shit** after the 2014 crash. Seems like after that point in time buttcoiners were born, as that was the first large spotlight btc had in mainstream media as an investment - before it was mainly the fear mongering around btc only being used for Darknet and illicit purchases. 
Depends on how you look at realized gains vs paper gains and R&R I guess.
which websites do you use to predict future prices?

Do you use anything besides RSI and Bart?
We just jumped higher from 6500 to around 6700. Did any technicals indicate that this would happen? (Still trying to learn).  Also, what do the technicals say now?
To summarize, Chewy practices good risk management by not getting too greedy, because although as successful as he is as a trader, doesn't mean he still can't get liquidated by a BXD coming out of nowhere 
> "But chewtoy, your risk would increase, but so would your profits!"

Not increasing your risk, but taking some risk, rather than none. When you have your cold storage boxed in with a short, you have close to 0% risk (not counting counterparty).  

So I was asking why you didn't choose to take on some risk, so you would be net short, considering you have a good take on the market and have been right for the most part as the market dropped 70%.

You suggest that you have no problem taking on risk to go long, but you do not take the same risk going short.  That is what I was trying to understand.

>  What effect that may or may not have on my cold storage coins is pretty irrelevant 

You are clearly using your trading account to limit the downside risk on your cold storage coins, so it is clearly far from irrelevant.

> All it takes is one bad call to wipe my entire trading stack.

Yes, and considering the market dropped 70% during the last several months it was much more likely to make that call being net long, rather than net short.  Yet you are more comfortable with that somehow.

You seem to be fine taking much more risk to go long, rather than short.  And this is in an extended bear market where you have been right the overwhelming majority of the time. Yet you pointed out that you very rarely do not short (net short), because it makes you too nervous.

So my question was a simple one and not a matter of semantics at all.

(And you are a 10x better trader than I am...probably have 20 IQ points on me, and much more money than I do...which you earned by being smarter.  But just trying to understand why you don't go short in a bear market, given your track record).

The best I can figure out is that you just have a phobia of getting liquidated from being short, rather than long, even though this year, the risk has been much higher on the long side.  Again, you are a superb trader and just trying to understand.

Closed the december after all.  I don't like the \*upward hyperbolic curve on these 30 min candles.  Not gonna just sit and watch those paper profits evaporate when I have a stronger position on sept anyway (I'm trying to do the opposite of the shitty intuition that burned so many profits before or even switched to losses: "I have a better other position that insures this one so I can gamble with it")
In the same boat. No funding for that kind of work means it isn't going to get done.

Anyway, there would certainly be some interesting observations, but overall, I don't think that the existence of alts overly impacts Bitcoin. It may increase a demand for a portion of BTC transactions, but I don't think it's substantial enough to think about as more than a buffer. You can probably just observe tether transactions and get a rough sense of how active arbitrage is and the size of the "buffer."

Can't we somehow make this a transparent, publicly stated policy?
Thanks cutiepie 
Of course I could totally be wrong. 

I am just of the personal opinion that it will go the way gold and silver did rather than the way of the internet/successful dotcom companies. 

Not a failure by any means- but I suspect it may never reach the heights maximalists/enthusiasts are waiting/hoping for. 


I am interested in it and will freely admit they are completely lacking. My prediction comes not from my own understanding but from an aggregate of opinions and predictions from an array of people I deem much more knowledgeable than I am. 

I will say that my conviction in this prediction generally lessens the more I personally understand btc and economics, but I still haven't seen anything particularly convincing. I fully admit I could be wrong! 

Also i decided I will generally try to respond to you if you don't attack me or bring up any of the drama anymore. I apologize for any of the stupid shit I did or said and just want to move on from it.  

I wish I could take back some of the stuff I said/in general just avoid having participated. I'm going to generally try to take a break from commenting here. 

I also apologize for what dush said on his behalf. No one deserves to be spoken to like that and I wish he wouldn't say things like that. 
Well internet friend, please sell me some hopium in the form of institutional investment insider information! I'll eat that right up. 

And of course I am not insinuating that an etf is right around the corner, rather that it would be the appropriate catalyst. 
The term you're looking for is *up-down bart*. 
Thanks brotha, the feeling is mutual :)
Technically Beanie Baby buyers lost nothing.  Lucky them.
Search YouTube for “Crypto Cred” for some good introduction lessons on how to learn technical analysis (TA).
The second you get greedy is when you lose. 
Here's a summary of why I haven't been net short, on top of what I've already offered:

1. I have an inherent bullish bias on bitcoin, and have since $1,350+. Ultimately I do not believe $20K is the ultimate top. 
2. It may _seem_ like I've been 100% certain of the bear market's continuation, but I've actually been a mixed bag throughout. There were a handful of times where I thought it was over and either stopped shorting or went long.
3. My goal is to accumulate as much BTC as possible. I want to make as much btc profit as possible, but more importantly, **I want to avoid losing btc whenever possible.** 
Yeah I don't think there's many conclusions to be made without meaningful data. Without getting more into the nitty gritty of tether arbitrage and supply/demand effects, I was just saying I think there's an argument to be made that the global market views crypto as an overall single asset class. Those plugged in to it, us, obviously see the differences, but I could certainly see how a large bleed of over 50&#37; of the asset class would shake investor confidence in the space as a whole. Even if they do recognize that the alts are even more speculative than BTC, most of the general public still view it \*all\* as crazily speculative and don't make the delinations between alts and btc quite as large as it truly is.
The information does not apply to the vast majority of subscribers. The minority of users who fit that criteria are infantesimal.

Also, the description you provided is incorrect:

There are many more automod rules, but these are the ones that are relevant to the population you're talking about.

I'm unaware of any subreddits that publish their AutoMod rules.  We tweak them to keep out spam, ban evasion, and rule violations. 

Hate speech is the AutoMod rule that has a false positive more than any other rule. If you're looking for clarity around possible sources of censorship, the hate speech definitions are probably more relevant. 
There's no certainty in the direction of any asset class and then you add to directionality a time horizon and it is anyone's guess. Trade well my friend.

All that I'm afraid I can share is a more broad comment. Institutions move at a glacial pace as any action requires a cumbersome internal approval and vetting process. This is doubly the case when the objective to to operate in a new, let alone "untested", market.  

From where I sit, the "sell-side" is halfway complete. The "buy-side" is at least 12 to 18 months farther back. 
They saved babies'  lives and that's priceless
Is that guy good? What’s his ROI for this year?
> My goal is to accumulate as much BTC as possible. I want to make as much btc profit as possible, but more importantly, I want to avoid losing btc whenever possible.

I didn't think you have been anywhere close to 100% certain about any of the market moves. You are too smart for that.  But if your main goal is to accumulate BTC, then it does make sense why you wouldn't short.   

So that solves it and thanks for taking some of your valuable time to explain and my apologies for the distraction.  I am definitely a "fan" and your posts are some of the most valuable in the sub.
God I've missed your posts. The drivel that's been in here the past couple weeks has mostly driven me away from posting. 

It's legitimately refreshing to read logic again. 
Agreed, thanks mate you too! 
This stuff needs to go to DM. We can't keep airing out dirty laundry in the daily.
OK fair enough. Don't want you to put yourself out there too much.

So from your seat, the sell side = physical btc owned and held in custodianship or are you talking more broadly about swaps, futures and actual btc? T
Yes, he’s good. Learn the fundamentals of trading first, and be concerned about ROI after that ;)
MBLA:

"Make Bitcoinmarkets Logical Again!"
Lol, can agree with that. Told you I'm lately only following couple people here and occasionally reading other comments. It's a mess lately.
There's been a lot of quality today actually. Maybe a few weak hands/weak posters got shaken out.
I don't really see why not. I noticed you removed all my comments over the past several days.

Also, I'm just responding you his comment. He brought it up.
You missed a great deal of sock puppetry and the drama around arsonbunny's newly instated permaban. 

Pretty good stuff if you enjoy soap operas.

Unfortunately we also lost The_OPs_Mommy as a result, which really sucks.

:/
Today has been the best in the past few weeks, agreed. I haven't been too active recently, and out of leverage since I closed my short at 5880. I'm very near re-shorting, though.
I get it, but for your sake, and the sake of the sub, we've got to stop broadcasting our problems and get on with implementing solutions.

Off topic threads have been getting removed. I was hoping you were getting notifications from the censorship bot about those. Maybe that's something I signed up for at some point.

Anyway, yeah, anywhere I see this stuff being talked about in the daily I'm censoring it. If the sub needs to talk about it, then the stakeholders should make a self post to handle that. I'm just enforcing the rules on the daily. You've had a lot of leniency on this matter, but I still have to keep things clean.
I actually get a kick out of the drama from time to time. 

If you (or anyone) could provide a tl;dr, I'd appreciate it.
I've been too busy to post analysis since Friday plus World Cup. I switched long then and honestly, I'm short term bullish. Could be my position speaking, but check out the declining volume on the dumps and the expanding volume on the rises since. Open interest has been rising as well over the weekend. 

I know I don't have to tell you out of all people but, patience might be better here than a position. That said, I do have a tiny short I just opened to hedge profits.
You efficient son of a bitch! I wrote like 600 words and the comment was deleted when I hit send. Lost it all 😂 

But yes, I agree. I will attempt to move this stuff to PM at every chance I get. 
With pleasure.

Basically Arson got caught red handed again, mods and myself and OPs_mommy put together list of several of his accounts. Was permabanned but keeps showing up with new accounts and keeps making the same obvious mis-steps and getting caught.

Then a few days ago, Sloppy started accusing OPs_mommy of being *me* because we both write long winded analysis of arson's socks and the various manipulation that's going on here. Sloppy starts witch-hunting us and says that we're making the sub worse and that his "friends" are being wrongfully accused (Sloppy is a direct target of this manipulation, several accounts that have been PMing him, befriending him, telling him they're women, adding him to discord groups, etc.). Most of these accounts turned out to be arson or arson associates (they seem to be organizing brigades and mainpulation via Discord or something else -- it's not all just one person). 

OPs_mommy can't reason with Sloppy (nobody really can when it comes to this matter, he's heavily brainwashed for whatever reason) and says this is stupid and he's leaving reddit. Sloppy still hasn't rescinded his baseless accusations, which sort of pisses me off because he's being manipulated by other users -- putting ideas in his head that I'm running different accounts and falsely accusing people and whatnot.

Anyway, mods are now *well aware* of this whole situation (largely thanks to my thankless efforts [and OPs_mommy too]) and they're working to proactively limit this damage from now on. 

Also, received [this gem](https://imgur.com/a/SANz93w) last night. 

It's a wonderful sub!
Likewise 
Oh, also ctrl-f "OPs_mommy" here to find his top level comment. Guy really put the work in to compare the screenshots that account was posting versus Arson's. 

Scroll around a bit (and search for my top-level comment) to see the context of Sloppy accusing him.

Well, patience led me to not short 6400 or 6500 on the first pump. My target has been 6700 ever since I closed the short. In the grand scheme, 6630 vs 6700 isn't much difference if I'm right about direction. If I'm wrong, it's an additional 1% hit on a hedge short. I'll probably take the closed to 6650 I can get. 
Thanks Sloppy. For what it's worth, OPM is their own person. Shit happens. Nobody makes a decision based on one thing. I had my part to play in that too.

The best we can do is move forward.
Well, I can't say I have a full and complete grasp of what I missed, but I think I've got the general gist of things. 

I won't pass judgement to any degree here, but suffice it to say that the whole thing sounds like a colossal waste of time for everyone involved.  
Jesus, that escalated w/Dush. That's not cool.
Ugh well now I feel stupid. I was just paranoid that night and shouldn't have said anything. I hope he comes back. I would be willing to write a personal "this guy's alright, guys!" to clear his name but I think at this point it's better just to move on since I think probably less than 30-50 people saw that exchange anyway. I can't imagine it'd be a huge deal if he merely kept posting regardless. Don't think anyone would mind at all. Hopefully he comes back 
Yep, especially since it's an unwinnable game of whack-a-sock. As soon as you shut one down, he and others pop up with others. It's made me become even more cynical about the internet as a whole.
On a lighter note, [there](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ontzj/daily_discussion_tuesday_june_05_2018/e04sokk/) were some [happier moments](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8oeff3/daily_discussion_monday_june_04_2018/e039ei0/), while you were away as well.

Also, arguably, a big ol' waste of time.
That's pretty much par for the course for the guy (and many other here. I get messages like these often from BCash shills and others I've pissed of).

Admins were quick to suspend his account though and I think he's perma-suspended this time around (several warnings, several incidents, ban evasion, etc.)... Not that that stops anyone from making a new account.

:/
It his deal. You're not responsible for the choices other people make.

The issues we're navigating that are exposed by the brigades are subtle and not understood. Their purpose is to divide us. So, let's not divide ourselves.

We disagree about stuff in this sub. Everyone gets to be wrong sometimes. That's how it works. That doesn't mean that we dislike or disrespect each other.
HA, now I need to go back and re-read American Psycho. 
Yeah, I am generally pretty tolerant, I mean its reddit. But comments like that are uncalled for and not a community I want to be involved with. Calling someone stupid is one thing, hate speech is something else.

It feels kinda ugly lately, but I guess it was last year also during the fork, usaf and the cashening. Idk, I guess it is just reddit? 
Thanks mate I appreciate that.. Yes it's clear there are outside forces attempting to disrupt the sub. 

After seeing about 6 people close their shorts simultaneously at $5.9k and then seeing it rocket up after I realized that this sub may in fact have a sizable effect on the market. It'd be almost less believable that no one is trying  to manipulate it in their favor. 
Probably the most accurate representation of your average crypto trader. 
It's not even the bigoted hate speech, it's just the fact that he's an asshole. A bad compadre. I assume you were around back then and remember, but he was just a straight up malicious asshole to everyone except for Sloppy and Chewtoy and he was only nice to them because he was sucking up to them to get brownie points. It was also him and arson both who made up a bunch of bullshit and turned a witchhunt on me and got me banned. Actually, it was the three of them to some degree. Sloppy, Dush and Arson.


I dunno. I was completely not paying attention to Bitcoin from summer 2014 to summer 2018. I was just hodling and checking in with the news from time to time but largely not on this sub or /r/bitcoin that much.

I do think it's because of the fork though. In 2013 there was none of this. There was dissent from smart contract folks and buttcoiners were pretty vicious, but there was nothing along the lines with what you see with BCash shills and all they serve to do is normalize the behavior so it spreads quickly. 

Honestly, fight fire with fire is the most sensible way to do it imo. There's a line you don't cross, but I'm happy to flame them with more-clever insults than their "stfu, stupid bch!" (check user H0dl history for numerous examples of this very phrase. 

Being calm and sensible doesn't work. Being passive doesn't work either. It takes vocal outcry to wash out bad actors. Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this sub except for me and maybe one or two others. Who else confronts shady and malicious shit everytime they see it? I'm batting close to 1000 and yet users are still trying to make me out to be a bad guy. Sure, say I'm obnoxious and off-topic or whatever, but don't claim I'm doing anything but exposing misbehavior. It's like a basic civic duty that just doesn't seem to exist in this sub. **Probably**, it's because most of these accounts that are complaining about me a socks. I've already caught about 20 and a bunch have already been banned. This is not hard to believe. This is crypto FFS. It's shady af and unregulated. That's why shitcoins and scams should be **actively campaigned against**. Pretty much nothing except Bitcoin should have anywhere near a multibillion dollar market cap. The economics just don't make sense. A utility platform like Ethereum, which is used exclusively to launch other utility platforms should not have economic value. It's a house of cards and will collapse at some point within the next 10 years (probably a lot sooner). Plus, it was sold a security and is completely centralized... not to get off topic... the point is that "crypto" is overrun with trash and its Bitcoiners' job to clean it up because Bitcoin is the only project that *might* be viable. Even with Bitcoin, people should know all the risks. But with alts, people don't know what they're investing in and their only plan is to buy low sell high. The read some gimmicky white paper about big blocks or DAGs or the power grid or dentist office networks and they think *that's* the next Bitcoin even though it makes zero sense to use a blockchain for that use case.

There is one use case with a valid blockchain use, so far as we know, and that's sound money. I see nothing else in the space that even comes close to supplanting Bitcoin for this use case. However, because Bitcoin has a lower multiplier in the short and medium term and is closer to its theoretical ceiling, it's no longer about just hyping Bitcoin. There is much more profit to be made in pumping and dumping restricted-supply scamcoins. 

And it sucks. It's ruined the space. This place in 2013 was like an ancient advanced civilization that was wiped out by an empire of angry and moronic people. Personality cults, calling Bitcoin obsolete, massive ICO valuations for projects that don't even exist yet -- that's what we're dealing with in 2017/2018. 

Luckily, it'll all wash out in the end I think. Bitcoin is the only thing smart money wants to hold long term. It's always been that way and, by the looks of it, it'll remain that way. It's really just plebs and socks pumping shitcoins and unfortunately they love to do it in this sub.

 
Something funny is going on, that's for sure.
