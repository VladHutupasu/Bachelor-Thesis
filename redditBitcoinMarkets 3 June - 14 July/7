We could be in the distribution range for the traders who bought the 5800$-6000$ range. This range (red box) is outlined by the 2 previous highs.

One thing I'm looking for right now is a wick in the blue box that gets rejected. This would be similar to what happened on June 20th and it would be quite bearish.

Chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/gvSSFoO4/
Are "market makers" doing these "smash-downs-with-a-hammer" or are they the result of normal traders? This hammering (e.g. on bitmex) seems to be a relatively new phenomena (in addition to other new phenomena such as 'Barts').

I doubt semi-professional traders are sitting all day behind their computer and react so aggressively against price movements. Many times a green candle pumps, it is smashed down immediately (+/- 70% retrace in < 1 sec); similar retraces happen on red candles (obviously less because of bearish months). I don't remember such aggressive behavior in 2017 (i.e. aggressive dip-buying in < 1 second for the bull market).

Market makers might have the incentive to "hammer down" the price and keep it within a certain range within a certain time period (to either profit from sideways action by providing liquidity, or maybe they need more time to neutralize their net long/short exposure); normal traders, on the other hand, just want to enter/exit market for profits. 

It just feels so artificial (a 70% retrace in less than one second is anything but 'organic'), but on the other hand, it also feels like it is done by some professionals (algorithmic traders) who recently entered the markets. The 2017 big whale pockets (maybe early-adopters, or just good traders) were more on the level of amateurs. Their strategies were like "woohoo let's flash my big wall" (Spoofy and his 1000 BTC shenanigans went off the radar +/- Sept 2017) or "let's try to market buy and hope the rest FOMOs." 

These "new guys" just feel smarter, faster, more aggressive and more sneaky. I cannot describe it, but looking at the books and orders, it feels like they want to squeeze (with all these hard micro-rejections, fakeouts, and retraces) every last satoshi from average-high-leverage-FOMO-Joe, until there is nothing left to squeeze, and then "they" launch the real pump/dump with their privileged high-speed algorithms while the rest arrives late at the party.
This looks like disbelief rally when price slowly moves up but people refuse to accept it. Note that 1D RSI is over 50 for the first time in the last 2 months. In 2018 whenever RSI cross 50, the price follow with 20% increased in Feb and 43% increased in April. For 2017 it was much better when RSI was over 50 but it was bullish year so a different story.
Sometimes, it feels good to have no position and to just look at this shit show from the outside.
only thing im interested in here is the 50 day ma and the 3d macd.  3d macd has always been a very reliable indicator for the market flipping bull. the rest is just noise. see a lot of people here this past week trying to make sense of it, no point, you are overanalysing. imo we got rejected pretty heavily downstairs and now we gotta test the strength of the bulls.   
https://www.tradingview.com/x/oHCsyysX/    
ultimately think its a bull trap, but think we could go pretty high if we manage to cross the 50d ma.
I'm seeing so many unknown chinese exchanges like ZB, BitForex, LBank, Bibox, etc. climbing through the volume ranking on CMC. Are these exchanges legitimate or are they just faking the volume?
Multiple attempts to break the resistance at  6750-6800, we seem to be consolidating sideways rather than downwards (which is good). I think the next attempt will break the resistance, however its important that we hold above 6800 and start making moves towards 7k. Volume atm however  is not the greatest but an improvement from yday
I really dont think this is a reversal but im looking forward to profiting from a relief rally. The rallies to 11k and 10k that were months apart were only relief rallies but they were very profitable. I'm only looking forward to $7500 to $8500 tbh.

But I've always wondered why people say capitulation must need more pain. We've been dumping for 2 months straight and the latecomers who bought the top have been underwater for 5 to 6 months i think. BTC is 70&#37; to 80&#37; down at one point. Not worse than Mt.Gox but near. Lmao just how much more pain are we looking forward to before people really believe its capitulation?

If this wasnt the bottom we can hit lower and hit despair mode sure, but i think most of the capitulation already happened. Its down 70+&#37; ffs.

That said, im a little bit pissed at myself for taking some profits from $6200 at $6500ish a few days ago lol. I should have not trusted my noob instincts so i really dont know what the hell will happen.
It's amazing how quickly we fell from 6,800 and how long of a trek it has been to make it back up to that point.

I am loving it though.

Slow and steady wins the race.
Well since I sold most of my crypto almost 2 months ago, I decided to wait for my favorit indicator MA cross to the upside on BTC. And look, now it appeared https://www.tradingview.com/x/NExtACYT

Also quite happy that the double bottom of yearly low and trend line bounce my blue arrow here indicated seems to have turned out to be correct.

Will start buying with maybe 5% fiat per day or so now and try to get some good deals. 

Same for ETH, if 480 holds there are some nice room for movement upwards
Don't have too much time on my hands but here's my take:


Very nice to see that we are holding above $6,700. I think the next retest of $6,800 will be a breakthrough based on the fact that on the first wick above $6,800 the bears showed up with better selling volume and got BTC down to ~$6,450. The second retest has held much of it's upward momentum without bears making a true test of bull strength. I believe we will break $6,800 today (the 8th), as I stated in a post a few days ago. I'm even going as far to say that if we break $6,940 (50D MA) we will most likely run to ~7,200. 



The charts are beginning to truly paint a bullish narrative, following the qualitative news we have received recently regarding institutional interest and adoption as well as positive regulatory action. Be wary of anchoring to any position, (as that is how big losses are realized) but recently the short-term trend has been bullish. I'm sticking with it until I see some actual evidence towards the contrary. 



Not investment advice. 



Anybody long the count of my alarm going off <$6700? If so, rich AF. 
Opened massive long yesterday and had some mode bids filled overnight. However, price is not behaving as aggressively as I hope, there has been no continuation once again after the BGD. We are holding 6700 though which is nice, but I am worried that we might bart back down any moment.

This is what I am watching for support: [https://imgur.com/uEHlWzz](https://imgur.com/uEHlWzz)

We have broken above the 200 period MA on the 4H for the first time since we broke down below it 2 months ago. If manage to hold this price we will get the golden cross on the 4H when the 50 MA crosses above the 200 MA. We could pull back to 6600 over the next day or so, and if we bounce from there it creates the perfect golden cross (price pulls into the cross and bounces). Here is an example of the bear version: [https://imgur.com/a/qlvCYyh](https://imgur.com/a/qlvCYyh)

If we can do the opposite of this, we are looking at a good rally to at least the next big resistance at 7500-7700. I know it's only one indicator, and the cross hasn't even happened yet, but its basically my only hope right now. I have bids down to 6600, if the cross happens and we go up, this will be a massive winning trade for me and I will bake mack a good chunk of my losses from early 2018. If it fails and we dump straight through the 200 MA I will likely get liquidated, I didn't leave much room for error. Good trading everyone.
Some of you need to learn some patience

It took a week to break through $6500. And now you are calling it over because we didn’t break $6,800/$7,000 in less than 24 hours. 

Get out of the bear mindset, and realize that this is painting a higher high and a higher low and is staircasing it’s way back up. 

Shorting the pumps during a bear market is the path to riches, but shorting the pumps during the bull market is the path to ruin. 

The key now is to either buy the dips or wait until this goes down below $6,300 to confirm that this is still a bear market 
Does the volume profile for this possible rising wedge fit?

https://imgur.com/gallery/p7v6GOx
People are talking about the potential inverse head & shoulder if we retrace to 6k3, but what if we already form a complex inverse head & shoulder on 4H chart? The one with 2 heads

https://www.tradingview.com/x/g7nmA3Fh/

- Volume was highest on the LS, lesser on the 2 heads, and just a little volume on RS.

- Volume breakout is not really great, but much better than the average volume.

- I just ignore the wicked.

Reference about complex IHS http://thepatternsite.com/chsb.html
Things may get [interesting](https://www.tradingview.com/x/SkXU0uuy) the **next CRITICAL 12h** when this rising wedge support meets cloud resistance.
Starting to look like a bullflag on the 4hr 
So quick question 24 hours after that pump -is it still looking like a Bart or will it break up? I'm no TA expert but looking at the last BGD's that were not Barts they seem to have slowly declined on the hourly chart about half way back to full retracement and then another BGD came along. Not too often has the line been so oddly square and horizontal. 
Currently long from 6730. Planning on flipping my position if we hit 6900 in the next day. I'm expecting a ton of resistance there as that was our last local high before the drop down sub 6k. 
I'm going to go with a mostly non-antagonistic post for a change as it seems a lot of people at the moment are very confused and in bad positions.

What's currently happening then in my mind? We are in an upward trend. To where? That remains to be seen, what is important is that we are pushing up, making higher highs and higher lows. To anyone short long-term, underwater or hoping we are going below 6500 anytime soon you're in serious trouble if you're not being realistic about the current situation. You're fighting one of the most reliable indicators in the world of Bitcoin, the 3D StochRSI/MACD.

Call TA wizardry if you will, on smaller time frames you're quite likely right a lot of the time but the 3D metrics speak volume over the past years of BTC/USD trading. Without a serious move downwards within the next two days a medium-term bullish movement is locked in. We will be seeing 7XXX+ over the coming days without a serious correction very quickly. Once the ball starts rolling in an upwards direction of those 3D metrics the conclusion is a sure bet unless 5 years of being a reliable indicator is about to be made redundant; that is not something I would fight.

It's easy to get locked into a particular trading mindset, a lot of people have been making a lot of money shorting these past weeks, many seem to get locked into a particular system because it has worked previously... Yet that is only true until a point, when the winds shift if you're smart you'll change tact, if not, there is a high probability you'll capsize. Doubly so if you're leveraged up heavily and are being delusional and crossing your fingers.

The market doesn't care for your hopes, dreams or wishes. It's a cruel mistress and indifferent to your suffering. Don't fight a trend, embrace it, cut your losses if need be and live to fight another day.  I've seen some delusional posts talking about a 'double top' on this most recent move, the second wick went substantially higher than the one two days prior... If you're subscribing to that theory and are underwater you're not being logical, you're trading on hope, and take it from me, hope doesn't break even.

Happy hunting.

\-edit-

Laughing at myself... Open with 'non-antagonistic...' Gets increasingly antagonistic throughout. Can't help myself apparently. 
The Power of the .236 ... can we break it?

Found out today that apparently burning thyme is supposed to bring financial luck.

Just got back from a week long vaca and the thyme was the only herb to not make it.  Here’s to you guys!
Funny, I remember my 5x long from 7k. I got stopped out at around 6850 and took a 10% loss which really hurt. But now I'm so fucking glad about it. I would have gotten liquidated and lost everything when we hit 5.7k and even if my liq was lower, I would still be under the stop out price. My idea was invalidated, I took a loss, and it saved me. Always be prepared for what you will do if what you think is going to happen doesn't happen. 
This uptrend should continue, but I don't see this breaking 8.5k. There was a new yearly low and all the downward momentum on the longer term charts (especially on the 3D looking at Stoch and ADX which indicates trend strength) only increased. I expect a bit of a further move up before a continuation of the downtrend. Also, this entire uptrend is occurring on decreasing volume, so it's weak. I will change my mind if a volume outburst occurs while passing 7.5k. As of now, I'm still holding a long but looking to close as soon as upward momentum decreases on the shorter term charts, hopefully after 7.25K which is my current target.
Regarding 6800: seems like a gateway to a move towards bullishness. In the past I have noted that the space needs new dollars. Many have noted that because of the speculative aspect we paradoxically either need a higher price to bring them in, or some large shift in the fundamentals.

People with lots of money could pull the strings, continue to gap up and go on the futures, and this could break whether people “want it to” (voting with dollars) or not. I still think that regulatory clarity would be beneficial, and an end to the debatable tether situation. 

I suspect the tokenization of securities will be the actual catalyst to get people interested in this space again, because that is the only use case besides “digital gold” where the use of a decentralized immutable ledger actually saves a lot of real world money. 
D 50 ma as resistance (~6941), big daily triangle as resistance (~7080) and 2nd fan trend line (~7200) . Fan trend line and daily triangle will cross approximately at a btc price of 7110 so this will most likely be a strong one (if we manage to push past the 50 ma). 2015 we got rejected at the 2nd fan trend line an dumped hard afterwards. I am out of position, will most likely jump into a short if we get rejected or long if we pass through it. thoughts on the market?!

Edit: sorry for no charts but I am only on my phone and on holidays
Bears making their move before 1w close. The next hour will be interesting. 
Is anyone else tracking [USD margin credits on BFX](https://api.bitfinex.com/v2/stats1/credits.size.sym:1m:fUSD:tBTCUSD/hist)? I check every so often to see 'average-ish' margin long position base.

Sometime in last 24 hours or so, it dropped by $25M+...


Does anyone know how long it usually takes for a Bitfinex support staff to respond? I’m so unlucky... 😔
Market is more likely to go higher, simply because CME futures expired near the recent low and most likely CME futures manipulators are long for this next cycle so will manipulate the price higher.  

It is basically as simple as that.
This thing looks about ready to pop anytime now...
If in doubt, zoom out.

Really mixed feelings about recent price action.

To be a bit more bullish, i need to see a 4H+ close above 6850. The ammount of times that we got rejected at 68xx is kinda worrying, but the fact that the recent rejections werent strong gives a bit of bullish hopium.

Since this bull move up from 29/06, we havent pulled back. We've moved sideways but not down. This makes me think that some sort of pull back should come, combined with the multiple rejections, relatively low volume, 1D Stoch maxed out (although it can stay like that a while).

Decided to reduce my futures long, will re-add with confident close above 685x.

Got a slightly underwater short from 6610 which im gonna hold onto for now, will stop it out on a confident close above 685x.

On a slightly less BTC related note, does anyone struggle with the information overflow? 

This might sound daft, but everytime i dont know what something is or what something means, i look it up. Open first few results. Usually within those first few results ill find other interesting stuff i didnt know. Within a few minutes i can easily end up with 20+ tabs and once i see how big of a hole ive dug myself, i get discouraged and start to struggle.

EDIT: sells on the long just filled. Got about 40% of original position remaining. Short still open for now.
Everyone's suddenly bullish.

Making me doubt. 
Closed my long and opened a short.

- 0.236 Fib retracement level.
- Horizontal resistance at 6820.
- We're far from our 21D EMA support. 
- There is this weird thing about red candles increasing in volume while green candles decrease in volume.

My opinion is that we will keep trying to find support on the 21D EMA until we either break it down or break this resistance level. This can take another couple of days.

Why are the BGDs pretty much exact multiples of days or half days?
Hello everyone!  This is my first post here, although I been watching you all for a long time ;).

Anyhoo I was wondering if anyone could explain to me how these sudden price jumps actually occur and why they effect most of the cryptocurrencies.  How many coins do you need to buy or sell to make the price move so much?  
I'm gonna repost this chart real quick because I think this fractal might be back in play: [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/tlo0V1AE-BTC-Capitulation-still-ahead-potential-reversal-soon/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/tlo0V1AE-BTC-Capitulation-still-ahead-potential-reversal-soon/)

It doesn't match perfectly, but the general structure is the same.

1) Breakdown of log support with 3 tests, broken on 4th test

2) Breakdown of 50 period MA

3) Slightly lower low than 6k at 5.7k (2k/1.8k equivalent in fractal)

4) Bounce and formation of inverse H&S that consolidates just under the previous log support

If this were to play out, we would not only get a breakout of the inverese H&S to 7700, but also have continuation to get back above the 50 period MA (on the weekly in our case) and make a higher high than the last top of 9.9k. This would mean we would breakout from here and go nearly straight to a little past 10k. Wishful thinking, I know....but look at the charts.

**Counterargument**

1) Back in 2017 July we had Segwit activation as good news that kicked off the spike

2) The bounce that formed the head of the inverse H&S in 2017 was much stronger and more aggressive, and the inverse H&S was more clearly defined with smaller shoulders and a big head. Currently, we have a small head and wide shoulder. This is less bullish, but still a similar structure.

3) Volume was more convincing in July 2017, however, the highest volume came in at the break of the iH&S, so that is still a possibility now.

4) In 2017, this formation occurred on the daily and we were in an uptrend on the larger timeframes like the weekly and monthly. Currently, the formation is on the weekly/3day? and the higher timeframes (monthly, quarterly) are not as clearly in an uptrend.

Overall, I am not sure what to make of it. I would be more confident if we had actually gone to 5400 and bounced from there to make a better iH&S, but I still think this fractal is worth considering.


Edit: I realize I am just posting bull porn now that I am long whereas I was posting only bearish things when I was short. That's why I put in the counterargument segment. Not trying to influence anyone here please don't blame me if you long and this dumps to shit.
These BGDs are not so convincing to me, the action and volume are concentrated in 15-30 mins, if we ignore the slow bleeding after that then it is almost dead. 
I have a small short underwater opened @ €5616 ($6600), willing to add more to it if we hit back to €5400($6400) and probably close it if we go over €6200 ($7200-7300) and reopen it higher. 

if my observation is correct, besides of that almost overbought RSI on the 1h, 2h, 4h, 6h and 12h and a [3 times fail to break **and** stay over the 6800 resistance.](https://i.imgur.com/GF1NSLC.png) mostly from an experience of having been a Bitcoiner for over 6+ years and being involved with all bubbles and bear markets except the first one of 2011, I think there is still a huge room for another crash (probably will happen the next few days) and we certainly didn't hit the real bottom yet.

Overall this is just an observation, I am not a TA expert, I took enough time to learn but I still don't think I have all the needed TA skills to call it as certain. this is also why up until now I didn't take major leverage trading positions. 

Capitulation is not an event like most of you think, capitulation is a process that will take a long time, most people talking about buying the bottom now will not buy it because they will be either too afraid or think that Bitcoin is dead. and I know it seems easy call now, but even the most experienced people will have doubts about re-entering and committing to an investment. 

Edit: let me add to the above, [the amount of longs vs shorts is also so worrying](https://i.imgur.com/fzv0ThY.png), a long squeeze is going to be ugly to watch [(source)](https://datamish.com/d/000000004/btcusd?refresh=20s&orgId=1&from=now-24h&to=now).



we are painting a very nice launch pad for the move above $7,000


If anyone knows the feeling, getting off a plane in a different country, switching SIM cards and discovering that bitcoin climbed nearly $300 while one was in the air, is quite pleasant when long. That said, the latest action did not impress much, and I think shows more the weakness of the bulls in the 6750-6800 area.

I find it interesting to watch how today's 1-D candle closes, because if at least 75% of candle's body remains above approximately $6680 (upper b-band 1 standard deviation), price will be in what many traders call the "buy zone" (pros confirm?). 

If confirmed on Monday, I think there's a case for calling an uptrend, going by [bbands theory](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/using-bollinger-bands-to-gauge-trends/) anyway. Until then moving up my stops and kind of anticipating a dump.

(Edit: Added missing figure 6680. Edit2: added source for bbands theory.)

Edit 2018-07-09 23:28 UTC: I got stopped out and am currently out of position. 
Hi guys, BTC noob here. Would you guys say it's a good time to get into BTC at the moment if i'm in this for the long term? 1-2+ years?

All these chart analysts are giving me mixed readings about whether to get in right now or not. Half saying it's going to go down further, the other half saying go long.. what to do if I'm not looking for short-term gains? If there's an opportunity to buy at a lower price I'd obviously prefer that but not sure what you guys think what will happen these next few days?

thanks.
Lol at people who put stops right under 6700 as if that wasn't likely to get run.
I am on the sidelines at the moment, looking to short 7-7.2k under the 6 month support we broke down out of. I have noticed most TA seems to be ignoring that obvious point of heavy resistance for some reason lol

I did some stats to local buy/sell crypto group. I’d say 95% of them are losers looking for easy profit, some hardcore hodlers (mostly shitty alts) and some miners (stealing electricity either from public or private/ the ones i met/talked with)

The buy/sell ratio for the last month was 1/10. The premium was 25-30% has dissappeared and some guys are selling below market price or converting for foreign currencies.

The capitulation is real. I think these small dildos up with slow bleed down is big whales buying and small timers selling out of desperation.

Not calling a definitive bottom here but even if you compare this to the 2014 bear market, this is the point where the price went up 80% in a fake run.

I think buying here is a no-brainer.
I have an underwater short at 6535. I will be honest. I didn't expect consecutive pumps like this to above 6800+. I will capitulate if BTC makes another push to above the previous high - 6850.

Each increment of high is decreasing before the real test. 

(6545 --> 6681 --> 6785 --> 6840) --> (+136, +104, +55)

I guess longs would reply that it's softening up the overhead resistance but I just need to see one more important evidence before I change my view


Why is it that of btc bottoms out a reversal must happen? Those are not the same at all 
This was the first pump, that didn't have the power to reach the top of the uptrend channel.


Sometimes it's just better to stick to the plan. Don't forget that you made a plan for a reason... Don't get trapped by a pump, as convincing as it may seem.
Pretty weak dump as usual for this past week or so. 
We are about to blow. It is clearer to me now than yesterday. The world is not ready for what's next.
There are huge differences in price across exchanges right now. Some btc/usdt markets have a price of over $7k. Is it always like this or is this just due to that pump that happened and the markets haven't had time to settle yet?
Noob here. But I wonder why I've not read much here on the possible more prosaic explanation for this week long period of improvement. Lot's of people getting their month pay checks and looking at alt coins and BTC and thinking, nows a good time to consolidate. I'm more of a long term holder and I'm quite good at picking promising coins but my timing is not so great. 

Support for this idea is that ordinary Joe public investors tend to be looking at this on the weekend. When did the pump happen? Immediately on the weekend.  According to some, the weekend markets are more dominated by bots, but one has to assume that they might be amplifying price movements triggered by a sudden influx of fresh buy orders that in this instance, quickly go up with the price movement due to FOMO. So, another pattern I've noticed is that a poor week from Wed to Friday results in a pump on the weekend, usually equal to the fall in the week. Again this was the situation last week. Makes sense since it presented a good buy in price for those eyeing a long term hold of various alts or BTC.  As things dipped over Wednesday to Friday I again thought this weekend could see a pump - based on my belief there still had to be some money left over from the monthly paycheck. But I expected it to be smaller. What happened is nothing until late on Saturday and then it came.   


The low volume also fits this. Whats driving is the price is the relatively high bids a small number of Joe Public are willing to offer out of FOMO.

progressing nicely
It begins, like a coiled scorpion testing the 6800 level with its tail.   


The MACD crossed aggressively earlier signalling a fall in price, and it only went down by $30 dollars and quickly recovered. Then I knew to buy in. 
Let the stop hunting begin: https://imgur.com/a/plC5oPS
Interesting, didn't expect this "dump" to recover. There still might be a round 2 though.
Volume isn't convincing enough to hit 7k. Looks like a decent spot to short to 6450. Volume could magically pick up and prove me wrong but I doubt it.

ETA: It's stoch rsi, macd, and rsi. And yes this is from the 2014 bear market, which is a lot more similar to current conditions than the subsequent bull market. Main problem I have with comparing that exact moment in the 2014 bear market to now is that the weekly RSI was more bearish at ~31 then vs ~41 now.

This other time from the 2014 bear had similar weekly RSI levels to today: https://imgur.com/a/kdSbjmF

Hey,newbie at this. What would you recommend to get me started for investing in cryptocurrencies? I'm also interested in how shorting works. I've only been longing since that seems like the easiest option ( kinda like, buy the dip, sell the peak?)

Our world is changing day by, hour by hour, everything happens so quickly. The blockchain, the all-important ledger that functions as bitcoin’s central nervous system, was Nakamoto’s signature achievement. While technical in nature, it reflected important insights about the psychology of money and community, and what’s needed to create rules that make individuals act in the interest of the group. Virtual Currencies may hold long-term promise, particularly if the innovations promote a faster, more secure and more efficient payment system, like, dor example Credits has all this features.

I know when I'm feelin' down, sometimes it helps to sing a little song. Here's one for all you shorties out there.

Seriously though, when was the last time we had a $100 red candle?

"The Bitcoin Short Blues"

Ain’t seen a $100 red candle since I don’t know when

All the big ones have been so green

Landlord askin’ for the rent

But my sorry ass done put it all on red

[chorus]
Ohh baby, I got them low-down dirty

Bitcoin short blues

I done paid my dues

An’ now I can’t afford no shoes


My woman been lyin’ an’ cheatin’

with a big ol’ nasty bull

An’ I can’t do nothin’ 'bout it

Cause I ain’t got no pull

[chorus… and so on]
Dreamt we were back at $8800, and it happened fast.  

What more you need?
This is not a reversal. If it was, we would have gone much higher, much quicker. If you look at the weekly chart, long term, I am looking to margin long at $3.5k. I am still short 1X from $11k in February. I will happily close that when I see a convincing reversal.
Primed and ready for a bart down. We shall see shortly 
Incoming ~5 minutes according to previous raise.
!long btcusd close 6753

!short btcusd open 6753
Whats interesting to me about McAfee's predictions and other famous ppl like Winkelvoss or Draper - these ppl are already very wealthy.  There lifestyle is not going to change if bitcoin goes to 1 million.  Based on this Technical Analysis, i think they will be proven right.  Their motivation is not financial, more intellect, insight and experience.

No point trading right now imo. waiting for break of monthly 5500 to short down to 3600 and maybe 1000. Break above 7800 and can long to potential new highs. 
20k- WOW what a steal, I is buy 100 is bitcoins, I is sell mi casa to get more

7k- No is no buys here is bad times to have buys

Mayb u narrative is have brokens and u need change it?
Here we go boys. Lets dump this shit.
Opps - target is 4.9k by end of July.
[deleted]
I agree. That looks like a good setup. If it breaks out though, that would be mind fucking
You are most likely overthinking it.  It was manipulated up to $20K, then down, then up, then down, then up, and then down and now up again.  (And of course some smaller moves there in between).

But that's pretty much it.

TA can still be used, because the path to least resistance for The Manipulators is mostly in line with TA, although they also like to do the unexpected sometimes.  But they won't swim upstream most of the time.


i'm a firm believer that for every 1 joe on here who posts a great trade or a great trading history, there's 9 others who have been bled by the MM since god knows when. I call this the 'facebook environment'. People posting their great lives on facebook but in reality they are suffering from life like anyone else would if not more. Yet we believe those people indeed have great success and that we're the ones who are unexceptional and average. (when i say "we" I mean people who are observers or neutrals). The geniuses or insiders who know how to trade with great success probably aren't the ones coming on reddit posting about it either. Just my 2 cents.
There are a lot of dumb amateur traders in this market (honestly, this sub is proof of that), it's too easy for bots to milk these noobs dry.
There are definitely some better bots out there these days. Problem is, if you're a bear you still have to have coins to sell, and you certainly don't want to have to buy back lots of coins that you borrowed in order to smash it down this far. 

We could run up to 15K in the next couple weeks, and bears on here would be like, "Herp derp! Down 25 percent in six months! Bear market! Goblin Town! Bag holders!" Delusional if they think they can keep Bitcoin down for long. They're fighting a War on Math. Guess who wins in the end. Some folks who won in 2014-2015: hodlers.
Upvoted because I think you’re wrong and don’t believe this is a recovery. 

I guess that proves your point.
Welcome to the show where everything's going up and the dumps don't matter. 
lol let's break 6800, 7300, 7800 first?
I call it a sucker's rally
There's no such thing as being outside the market.
More like a thriller.
are you sure you have no position? Having BTC at Mex is implicitly spot 1x long lol
That 50 MA is sitting right in the gap between 6900 and 7040.
When you say 3D MACD do you mean you've changed the signal length to 3? Thanks
Good way to tell is the fee structure. No-fee takers = volume you can't trust.

Edit: takers, not makers. Deer.
Chinese always fake volume, or really fake anything that makes them look good.
I believe a lot of these  exchanges have a token that offers dividends of some sort which grow based on exchange volume. Maybe they're wanting to attract investors for their exchange token by faking volume?
they're all using tether so treat the volume as if it was $0
It's Sunday morning. Why are you surprised that volume is low?
Because they shorted 5800

Rome wasn’t built in a day. 


Nagasaki was wiped out in an hour. 
What MA? 9 or 26?
I like your chart, the 9 and 26 day MAs together seem to be reasonably good at showing direction shifts without a ton of noise.  Seems like trading those crosses would be a pretty solid 'conservative' strategy focused on risk management more than max profits.  I've recently been trying to work out what a model that focuses on preserving or modestly increasing crypto net value (at the expense of sick gainz) would look like -- for someone that was disillusioned with the dollar but wasn't quite ready to just totally strap in for Mr. Toad's wild bitcoin ride.  Going to do some back-testing of how someone would do buying a pile of BTC, and then covering it with a short on the downward 9,26 day crosses and closing said short on the upward crosses.
In about 48-60 hours from now i could be a bull.
> Very nice to see that we are holding above $6,700

Two months ago everyone was so happy we were hovering near 10k.  Two months before that everyone was so happy we were still hovering above 10k.

Today everyone is happy we're hovering above $6700?  To me it just sounds like the goal posts keep getting pushed back.
Sounds like investment advice.
lmao...
Good luck
Seems a bit aggressive to have your liquidation so tight, since you would lose it all on such a minor move. Otherwise, nice perspective on the price movement. I’m glad your approach to the situation here is a bit more level-headed then yesterday.
Jesus ‘ol chap, I wish you the best. 
thanks for sharing
I think we will just dick around for a couple more
months. I HIGHLY doubt we see 10k+ in 2018

But the next bull rally will be insane. Can’t wait
This kind of rising wedge is just weak. Remember the famous rising wedge in 4h chart people draw a few days ago? It broke up and broke down, and it is still around that level.
I seems your support is just a random line
Seems like that could drop to continue forming a IH&S at 6.8K ish neckline. A drop also feels overdue to retest the low 6Ks
Now that's a mutant! You're on some Hills Have Eyes type of TA!
inverse head & shoulders = balls & dick ? - - 

!RemindMe 12h
Thanks guys for the replies, this is a great Reddit group I've learned more this week than in all the previous months put together
Bart’s aren’t a real trading pattern it’s just a meme that people just started taking too seriously. The reason for them was due to most of the action being traders due to low volume which in turn meant that you had cascading stop losses that retraced prior gains. 

A staircase like this on the other hand is one of the most basic bullish patterns. You pump up, you absorb the sells, you run out of sellers and buyers have to push upward to fill their orders 
I dont think TA guys can predict barts hence the term bart. Its unexpected otherwise they would use terms that are common in other markets. 

You cant even google barts in the context of traditional markets
We've already seen a ton of resistance at 6800.

6900 should be a breeze imho.
Why $6900? Have not seen a touch on that in almost a month and $6800ish has seen like 5 rejections since then, so that would be the critical hold, no?
a) The 3D hasn't closed.

b) We made a new yearly low and all 3D momentum indicators made newer lows (including the Stoch RSI that you mentioned) as well the lower we went during this downtrend, so I'm not sure how you concluded that the 3D metrics are bullish when they are bearish. 

c) We have never had a reversal ever in BTC's history when b) happens (look at 2014), and every single time, we made a newer low. So, if one was to take "the market doesn't care for your hopes, dreams or wishes" advice seriously, then looking at BTC's history, the correct trade in terms of risk/reward (if you're not already in a position) would be a short, but at a better entry. I am in a long and am waiting for 7.25+ levels before closing, but am confident it won't go too far up.
3d hasnt closed yet, also check the macd from march 2nd.
We may be in an upward long term trend, but the bottom hasn’t been hit yet. 
> 3D StochRSI/MACD

Excuse me for a noob question,what is "3D" refering too?
Thanks similiar sentiment for a lot of ppl. Can you link me the 3D chart
Good analysis - hope you are right and we are in the early stage of a reversal. Like you say the next move is crucial now. Busting through 6800 and holding it strongly will convince me. Breaking 6400 means i will still be bearish. 
That's *sage* advice.
And here I am just burning time...
>Also, this entire uptrend is occurring on decreasing volume, so it's weak.

What do you propose buyers buy on Bitfinex for example to 6800? The entire 316 BTC at the time of writing?
> I suspect the tokenization of securities will be the actual catalyst to get people interested in this space again, because that is the only use case besides “digital gold” where the use of a decentralized immutable ledger actually saves a lot of real world money.

Well, one man's saved money is another man's lost opportunity to write puts on other people's shares (like every brokerage does) or charge fees for "wealth management," not to mention the effect on other more exotic derivatives. If you think they're fighting Bitcoin (and they definitely are) you ain't seen nothin'.

But it is inevitable, and it will be great when we all actually own our shares and trade them directly instead of having them held as IOUs at our brokers. It will also prevent more things like this (and there are more things like this festering silently) https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-02-17/dole-food-had-too-many-shares
The weekly candle has to be closed anywhere above 6350 to remain green.

It’s very unlikely that bears have time and/or power to push it lower than that.

Edit: we haven’t had two weekly green candles in a row for quite some time; on the weekly it’s looking very promising for bulls right now 

Edit: meant two green candles in a row after a row of red ones 
Pretty weak. Next BGD confirms Stairway to Heaven chart pattern.

Didn't you find the perfect genius spot to short like 2 days ago?
CME: Most volume is in 2 contracts: 50% in the near term (this month) future, and 50% in the 'perpetual' future

near term future volume 
 July:
average daily volume is around 2000 contracts = 10000 btc

In Jun the daily volume was about the same

the bitcoin perpetual:
average daily volume also around 2000 contracts = 10000 btc
The perpetual volume peaked in may around 60k, now its at 50k monthly

total volume on CME is now around 20k btc every day.  
The recent move up has been on fairly average volume.  



lol can you imagine if it were actually that simple? would be stupid 
>muh coiled spring
That would be a too perfect fit ;)

>This might sound daft, but everytime i dont know what something is or what something means, i look it up. Open first few results. Usually within those first few results ill find other interesting stuff i didnt know. Within a few minutes i can easily end up with 20+ tabs and once i see how big of a hole ive dug myself, i get discouraged and start to struggle.


Primarily, I would recommend starting a mindfulness meditation practice. Developing focus and awareness through a regular practice can help mind stay *one pointed*, which lends itself to all forms experience, not just surfing the web in your underwear. There are more worthwhile reasons to meditate but it's worth it for the focus alone. 

There are also apps and browser extensions that can help you stay focused, as well as many methods to assist in time management, focus, etc.

yeah, you gotta prioritize better. bookmark tabs that are interesting but not pertinent to the direction you started in, so you can still read them later, but they won't be in the way of your current learning path right now.
Doubtful mango meets bullish mango. Pleased to meet you.
I’m seeing many low-effort comments today simply saying “I’m long and this is about to go up”, with no justification getting tons of upvotes. Definitely makes me feel better about my short.
that didn't stop it from barreling down in the 4 bear months of doom and gloom here.
Text book bull flag, futs back on premium. Watch out with that short.
Has something to do with the circadian rhythm of the reptilians.
One of the cycles land on a weekend.
"pretty much exact"  


exact and pretty much do not belong together in any sentence. they are not the same.
Depends on liquidity on the orderbooks. Recently we've had low volume periods so it doesn't take much, a couple hundred coins and we go up or down $100
i think the current market is similar to april 2014 in terms of the weekly rsi. I dont like comparing late/mature bull cycle to a late bear cycle. Appreciate your thoughts none the less.
No one thinks Bitcoin is dead. :)
I remember you from btctalk many years ago.

History rhymes, not repeats. You could be right and we go lower and drag this out past years end, or we could slide sideways and you could be wrong and now is accumulation time. It doesn't seem like we have had maximum pain yet but we didn't enter on this latest bubble so that is something to consider.

One thing is certain, this place is a ghost town again and the honest truth is no-one knows the bear is over until it is seen in retrospect.

Good hunting old-timer.
> even the most experienced people will have doubts about re-entering and committing to an investment

The only moment I didn't have that was Q4 last year. Bull markets climb a wall of worry, always. 

I am not implying it's gonna happen now.
I would say expecting the actual capitulation to be just 7 months after the top of a 2-year bull market is a stretch. The point of a capitulation is that no one gets to buy it, everyone is just waiting for it now. Long/short ratio is worrying, but overlay it on a chart and see it's not that reliable.

Anyway, rule of thumb now since we also just started new qrtl candle, break last months open/close and that should be the direction for mid-term.


Good post. Capitulation has got to involve some period of pain - until recently most were waiting for the price to rebound to the 9k range. Then with further drops there was nervousness - maybe a LITTLE pain at 57xx.

Not sure we have seen enough pain and hopelessness to trigger true capitulation yet.
Yeah, if it's going to happen, it looks like it'll happen soon.
Yep, painting a pretty picture on the 1hr and 6hr but, trading the 1hr is usually an invitation for SL hunting.  I got stopped out of my 5900 long on the pullback to the 6550 range (I was moving up stops each leg).  Got back in yesterday ~6660; I didn’t want to miss the party through 6800.  Bailing on ANY type breakdown under BE.  
I had the same but with a dump. Not as pleasant as yours
Don’t try to time the market. Dollar cost average. 
Ask yourself, is the upside potential larger than the downside potential?


In addition to the advise to DCA in, starting when the price is ~60% below ATH is probably safer than buying while the price is making new highs. As a LTH, I have been adding to my stack at these prices.
thanks guys. just needed a little reassuring. Got in on some BTC today. I'm just so stoked on the potential future of this and deeply believe in the mission. If it goes further down, so be it. I'm in this for the long run. 
No one knows. 
just average in over the next 6 months or set some specific price levels where you will buy
It is super risky trying to ride ~6k to 10k compared to 15k to 50k so just pe patient buy at 1-3k

If you are looking for "short-term" gains, then you are a trader like the rest of us in here and you can tell by people's stated positions what they think is most likely to happen in the market.
Slowly raises hand.... 
It's a good point and I remember a lot of talks about shorting that retest about 2 weeks ago.

But at this point I feel like this short target is similar to the 5.5k long target people were expecting. It will either not go there or demolish that range.
Noticed the same haha, everyone seems to just ignore the gigantic log support we broke down from and assume the next stop is 7.5k after 6.8k. It even extends back to the September 2017 ATH resistance and ATH resistance just before the 2014 bear market on bitstamp.
Am I the only one on here who longs? Right now I'm up on my long from 6550 with 3x margin, and I bet I'm doing a lot better than people who shorted in the past couple weeks. 

I mean, be my guest. Short away. At the end of the day it's just more buying pressure when you either get stopped out or close for a tiny profit. The upside potential is far greater than the downside potential at this point. The very lowest we go is 6K, and I doubt we even see that. 

But, you know, hey, it's your money.
Comparing this bear to the mtgoxxing is ill advised and I cant figure out why this sub keeps doing it.  There has been no black swan.  There are institutional investors.  10% of the supply wasn't stolen and one exchange that does 90% of the volume wasn't hacked
Similar position 
Same here
I have the opposite trade, good luck. Will close at 6490.
Going back a week ago, the daily  was full of people waiting for 6800$ for a short entry. I wonder how many actually had the balls to do it.
sounds like your plan isn't going well
I think the real movement will occur in the next 25 minutes. Timestamped at 6692 usd on CBP
Plot twist: it will pull back to 6.4k, liquidate you, then go to the moon and beyond.
Which ones?
My impression is that whales push the price in a certain direction over the weekend since daily volume is lower. They buy longs down low, squeeze the shorts on low volume and hope Joe Public FOMOs in and buys up their short orders up high so they can profit on the decline. Rinse and repeat. This is what gives us these monthly price cycles.

Also, I believe bitcoin dominance has increase overall this week, which would indicate Joe Public is not buying alts.
are you serious about this graph?
Obviously now I've entered I'm bullish lol.
Wow. Always wait a day. REKT lol
possibly post of the day for moi. 
Must say that cliff is looking epic. Its like they are just waiting to see who loads up more.... longs or shorts... and then... well, you get the picture. 
What dump? Maybe a stop hunt?
thats because the people that recognize that this is getting bullish have switched to the buy the dip mindset


Well I kinda expected it. They just wanna make sure the people who put stoplosses around the 6685-6700 area got rekt and next they have to fomo in for higher 6700+ prices. Classic tactics.
A little description would help. This is 2014 data and there is no comparison to the present data.

I guess this is Stoch RSI, MACD and RSI?


Stay away from r/cryptocurrency
Don't take this in an offending way, but do not call it "investing". Call it trading, speculating or something since that's what it is. Investing for me is buying a solid company with business revenue , or maybe a thing like oil when it's time for war.

This is a highly riskfilled asset
Spend at least a few hundred hours on doing your own research and don't fall for manufactured hypes. We've seen a lot of *Next Big Things* come and go. The price of a single unit is irrelevant, look at [market cap](https://coinlib.io/) instead. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose. Don't panic sell.
Buy low sell high. 
About a month ago I was in the same position, and I even posted something similar on this subreddit. I frequently read the posts of the most well-known users in the daily, and try to breakdown their posts into what I understand and don't. If there is terminology or logic I don't understand, I make sure to spend some time on trading websites and other resources for explanations. As far as shorting, most websites that offer margin trading have a breakdown of the terminology and what everything means.

While I don't recommend using Poloniex, their explanation of margin trading is pretty good. [https://poloniex.com/support/aboutMarginTrading/](https://poloniex.com/support/aboutMarginTrading/)

https://www.tradingview.com/x/7EGPfjIc/

God's Plan
Japanese are taking coffee
The volume comes when it spikes .. which essentially will push it up further ..happens all the time
https://www.tradingview.com/x/7hFmXKpU/

3.73 at $9k on the way to $11.7k after dump to $6k

keep in mind a long squeeze won't happen if the price keeps going up. if we start going sideways/down and longs start piling on I'd get worried
Lol I think you need to look up the definition of a bart
No, what's beyond ridiculous is this periods of almost perfect sideways trading. 'Barts' are normal because a normal chart looks wavy, not this disgusting 'kill the volatility' by trading hours sideways and pump & dump for 5 minutes. 
I suspect that big players are just pushing the fraud to maximum levels to squeeze every last penny out of bag holders before the house of cards finally collapses.
Binance - "the shit coin buffet" 

In all seriousness though, Binance is the place to go if you're looking to buy/trade alts.

I trust them too. Very professional team IMO.


Bitfinex is a great trading platform and certainly a market leader there. Unless a coin isn't traded on Bitfinex then I'd suggest using it. Of course you also need to fallow the volume. 
Great for BTC and large caps.

Shit for ALTs.

I just hummed it in my head and I liked it lol.
That's cool that you dreamed Btc was at 8800. Dreams can be interpreted as a glimpse into the future. While memories serve as a glimpse into the past. I take dreams seriously and maybe your right and Btc will be back at 8800 soon enough.

>This is not a reversal.

I love when people like you talk with such definite terms and conviction. Just remember, Bitcoin doesn't care about any of our opinions ;)
By the way you are playing it you could be waiting for capitulation until you are underwater.  Damn that would be sad.  You could be right on the other hand, but I can't imagine waiting until either capitulation or 12k to get back in. If we are destined for another bull run maybe that is good RR though.
The market can remain irrational longer than you can stay solvent. 

Position bias is dangerous when you think you know the future.
You mean like how it took 2 years to reverse from 2013? That quick?
You can pm position bot and avoid spamming the daily if you’re not stating your reasons for the trade. Hence the downvotes. 
these sorts cry themselves to sleep if they have 90 billion instead of 91 billion, thats all they live for
do you think that McAfee actually cares?  If Bitcoin continues to go nowhere while his prediction deadline looms, he'll just bail and say that government or outside forces changed the crypto landscape to make his prediction impossible, and move on with his guards and guns and whatever other nonsense he has to his next scheme.
Is that the same McAfee who predicted 15k for june?
For what?
it'll go to 7800 for you to fill up your longs. It will then reverse to your 3600 and 1000 target.

 Technically you are genius, but financially you are rekt.
You probably won’t be entering a trade for a few months then.

Can somebody kindly explain how it's impossible to be outside of the market?
And being a no coiner is effectively 1x short? :-p
Nop, tether.
no, 3 day
Mods need to get on with banning you. 
Only in a few countries m9, and i was talking about volumes from a long term perspective, i'm not 'surprised' but if you were to compare volumes during bullish movements from the last couple of months you would see a clear decline 
Despair is relative. Imagine if you mortgaged your house to long BTC at 10-12K and up
Its almost july and i remember BTC pumping to 3000 then dumping to 1800ish. Only 2x for something this volatile is really really underwhelming. I mean i doubt anyone who bought btc back then only expected a 2x.

The only regret so far back then is buying ETH at $375 with 30% of my stash. Fuck ETH.
I doubt weak hands in crypto are that hard to shake out. Otherwise we wont have much volatility that points to the downside. 
This was literally just shared on r/cryptocurrency yesterday hahah.
Yes the red is 9 and the blue 26
> and then covering it with a short on the downward 9,26 day crosses and closing said short on the upward crosses.

Well this is maybe not the best thing, since a cross back is not the best take profit point. But I haven't really explored when to take profit so I usually place limit orders and move them below a few days lows or highs in a trending market, to not get stopped out by the usual 3-5% moves, but if it's more then I just wanna exit
So what? the price is just the price, in the end it doesn't matter if it's 2 or 40000 dollar. It's the trend, movement and volume between the moves that matters
So think BTC will just keep going down and down and down? You do realize that is the same mindset the bulls had when they kept thinking it would go up and up and up, right? At some point, bears will get burned on a reversal, that is the overwhelming opinion if you believe in long-term value of BTC being higher than 6700. I'm simply voicing my perspective on the current possibility of us being at the start of that reversal. 
It’s all about where we are relative to where we were.
You do realize what sub you're in right? People post opinions here. If I was actually giving advice I'd be managing money and charging fees. This is simply my opinion. It could very well be wrong and I may lose a lot of money. Highlighting things like the 50D MA, volume analysis, price analysis, and trend analysis can help others formulate their own thoughts on the movements. 
It's an opinion on a matter.
>Seems a bit aggressive to have your liquidation so tight,

Yeah this is just illogical, dangerous and stupid.   


It's gambling. Not trading.   


Use less margin if you win big on this please. 
More insane than $20k?
It's all about playing horizontals right now imo.  Diagonals have lead to bad trades for over a month. 
Yeah, the support line should be a bit less steep, considering it doesn’t touch the bottom of the wick at ~$5800. However, the last 4 green bars have been decreasing in volume, while the last 4 red bars have been increasing in volume, with an overall decline in volume. I would say that indicates decreasing confidence from bulls and increasing confidence from bears. So yeah, I still think it looks like a wedge, even though the support line keeps having to get redrawn.

(Edit: I just want to point out that you should still be careful trusting it though, as plenty of wedges broke upward during the bullish cycle in April. Like these two for example:
https://www.tradingview.com/i/Zy97XxwC/
https://www.tradingview.com/i/0GXQ4w6M/)
I meant to connect the low of 5780 and yesterday's low, only realized I messed up after posting. 
According to your graph, the neckline would already have been pierced. So, we where is the volume breakout?

Very true.
Okay, noob question here: I only operate as a maker. Lower fees on Kraken, so I set limit buys and limit sells. Now, if sellers are also doing the same, who are those that fill them? Who are the takers and why are there takers? Why don't we ever see the price just stay flat for weeks on end with people not wanting to pay sell at market and people not wanting to buy at market?
RSI? Doesn't help with the timing but those show the direction of the next bart.
Bears have ammunition as well. I think they're giving up on 6800 at the moment. There are a bunch of open longs right now and they aren't closing at the moment. 

They need some of the longs to close to add some more selling pressure to drive the price down. We've flat lined for most of the day and it looks like we aren't dropping. Thus I predict 6900 is going to be a good place to get a short in. I have a very easy stop loss at 7100 there as well. 
>a) The 3D hasn't closed.

Why do I have two comments saying this when I literally said the same thing in my post?
Absolutely THIS.  
>3d hasnt closed yet,

Like I said, it's not confirmed yet, a strong move down in the near term could change the situation drastically. I think that definitely isn't the case on account of the strong slope already formed on the STOCHRSI combined with the double bottom from the past weeks. Moreover, the action of the past two days demonstrates strong buying pressure. Sellers aren't anywhere to be found on the moves down in numbers that matter.

\> also check the macd from march 2nd.

Using the 3D MACD after a strong bullish move upwards makes no sense at all. It does however make complete sense after weeks-months of pain... ie, like every other historical scenario you can view from the charts going back years.
I don't do predictions beyond a few weeks at most, that's all wizardry to me; too many unknowns. 
Likely a 3-day time scale, where 3 days of price action is represented in a single candle.
5M = 5 Minute candle sticks 

1H = 1 Hour candle sticks

1D - 1 Day candle sticks 

The longer the duration the more significant the movements generally when trying to predict trends. 
OK, I'll give you that one.
Trends need to occur on increasing volume to confirm longer term continuation. What buyers need to do to achieve that is irrelevant and is not really my concern to be honest.
They can still do all those things (except naked short sell), but with more liquidity, fractionalization, and instant settlement. Add in atomic swaps at the point of sale and your 401k may as well be your savings account. 
We had 5 weekly greens from the 2nd to the 30th of april.
Yeah but a close >6700 would be much better than <6600. I think we will see a bullish move in the next 23 minutes. 
LOL
You can see here: https://www.bfxdata.com/swaphistory/usd

That the total sum of USD funding on Bitfinex has decreased by about 100M$ (-15%) in the last 24 hours. This takes into consideration all the USD trading pairs and not only BTCUSD.

In other words, 100M$ worth of long position have been closed in the last 24 hours. 

EDIT: i'm talking about the green line here     https://imgur.com/a/KTDP31X
Margin long position count hasn't dropped, it's still rather high at almost 36K. Someone snuck in a $25Mish deposit in last day or so to un-leverage some of their huge position.
I think you meant to say the next two decades are critical. 
What a goofy non-sequitur.  If I remember correctly, you said it was "crazy to short", right before the price dropped 3%.  So yes it was a good place to short.   

Here's a pro tip for you. You want to be long, right before the price rises... and short, right before it drops.  



Do you know what the next expiration date is?
Well, I don't think that the price will go to the very end of that wedge. 

It never does. 

But the overall trend is clear, and I believe we will have at least one (maybe two) more leg(s) down before we break out.
my prediction; cup
Damn, this is like the third or fourth completely unrelate instance where I've been recommended meditation.

Reading up and finding out more about it has been on my to do list for a while. It just jumped to the top.

Are you a frequent meditator?

That's not something I would have guessed about you. From what I've seen of you on this forum, you seem to have trouble letting things go.

But then, I'm a bit like that myself, and I meditate (some periods more frequently than others).
Meditating to isochronic tones is very powerful. I recommend it to anyone.
Damn gypsy this is great advice. Mindfulness has literally changed my life. For anybody interested there is a talk by Sam Harris on this subject called Waking Up.  Can't recommend it enough.
Bitcoin is the future and has already retraced 70% from ATH. This is the time to load up on bitcoin. The reversal has already started. People are in denial

/s
!remind me 1 hour
Now it does not really look like a bull flag.
this place is not a ghost town, it actually increased in activity a few weeks ago when we were dropping fast 
Bears will be the ones capitulating, and they'll be doing it fairly soon. Last chance to own a piece of the dream cheap, boys and girls.
\>Capitulation has got to involve some period of pain

2 months of bleeding is not enough for you? lol the fact that we were dumping for 2 months straight without a relief rally is probably the reason why people who sold higher are buying at 5800 to 6700 even though they prefer buying in at much lower prices.

imo a lot of people who got in crypto late are in great pain even at the current price. BTC was down up to 70&#37; to 80&#37; i think at one point. Thats only 10 to 15&#37; higher than the Mt.Gox collapse
Fitting username. :)
It's important to remember that for *any* investment, the upside potential is always greater than the downside potential.
Yeah, $7.2k seems more likely at the moment, especially with log resistance from ATH to $10k crossing that ascending former support line right at $7.2k. The problem with predicting that target a few weeks ago was that that the gigantic log support we broke down from is ascending. So the longer it takes, the closer we can get to $7.5k without encountering significant resistance.
The thing about that log support is that we broke it, bounced on the daily to test it as resistance, then went to 5700. We are now back to consolidating just under it in an inverse H&S structure. Very similar to this: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/avamh0Yi/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/avamh0Yi/)

The first shoulder is the bounce to test as resistance, then we make the head which is the lower low, then we come back up and the second shoulder eventually breaks through. 

Obviously, it could play out differently but I don't think price would be following the log line up just drifting under it if it wanted to make new lows. 
Worthless comment. You have no reason to think I only short. Every time I talked about shorting when the price goes up I’m accused of being a permabear and every time I talk about longing during a crash I’m accused of being delusional or a permabull. Some of you really need to keep your mouth shut when commenting on matters you simply  don’t understand.
> The very lowest we go is 6K

"The very lowest we go is higher than the price was ten days ago." lol smh mkay
I somewhat agree with you but also believe it's pertinent to consider several other variables that didn't exist during Gox.  For example, in 2014 there were no trade wars and the political climate couldn't have been more different. 
Agreed. Really puts in perspective how bearish the market is right now: no huge bad news events but the downtrend is still really similar to the Goxxing period.

Imagine Bitfinex falling next week, the market would plummet into absolute darkness.
This should be sticked to the top
Except that this downtrend has been very similar to the 2014 bear market

Thanks man, wish you good luck as well

Wait, wishing you good luck doesn't make any sense..
I am short 68xx...we'll see what happens!

Good luck out there
1. Stick to plan
2. Get rekt
3. ???
4. No profit
Not sure how you discerned that... 

For the record, I sold about 5% of my stack at $1,100 and about 60% between $12,000 and $16,000. Think I'm doing okay :')
Likely 😓😭😢😩😟

Theres almost a $300 difference between binance and bitfinex.
Could certainly be and I think this is certainly compatible with the general idea. If its correct then there will again be some volatility around Monday and Tuesday and again a slide down around wednesday to friday but there is less free cash available next weekend and we will be again around the 5800 mark.   


Are most of the whales actually trading on their computers or are they getting bots to do this? I think it's mostly bots.
Ye
It's not really about buying volume, it's that the dump was done with hardly any volume.
Roll call.  6681 checking in.  
Can’t wait to see them get rekt by the feds. This shit is illegal 
I have updated the post. TY for the feedback.

Thanks man, appreciate your input.
I've been seeing alot of that, but is that the case now? I've been profiting from the barts, but only minimal.
I do the exactly same as you! Thanks for the tips and best of luck mate!
/u/lifeaintamystery Whenever you read something like this, you probably want to avoid their coin.
One vague sign I've  also spotted is, when the bart is steady and goes up, it usually goes down about 50 dollars first before making a straight arrow up.. 
British are brushing their teeth.
No it doesn't happen all the time, that's sort of my point. In the past 6 months, each subsequent "*now* we're headed to the moon" has been on lower volume. Decreasing volume suggests that the descending triangle is more likely to break down than up. When it does break down, expect volume to pick up, but don't expect the bottom to be in until bulls start continually defending rising price levels. 
Wow, 3.73 is absolutely insane. Thanks for the info Sloppy :)
central bank fraud? national currency bag holders?
Why are you here? Your comment history is literally nothing but boomer hysteria.  It’s SJW bashing, hysteria about brown people, MAGA cheerleading, and BTC ponzi posting.  Is this a satire account or are you really just a delusional boomer who’s brain has been melted by right wing media?  If this is satire, kudos: it’s a work of art.  If not, **The Revolution will be POSTED** 
That university of texas report was literally retarded. Forbes even wrote an article about how their claims were purely speculation
Jesus Christ, stfu already. 

Are you just waiting in the darkness to spread FUD at first chance?

Why are you the way that you are?


Uhm..., ETC could take of at any time as a listing on Coinbase is imminent. 
>We did already?

He's likely referring to a solid clearance of 6800, not a one second spike followed by harsh rejection as we have seen 2-3 times recently. 
Dreams can sometimes  be prophetic and glimpses into the future, but often they are simply just reflecting what we are concerned about. I would be careful about trading based on dreams unless its a person with a known, positive track record.
I am not hoping for catipultation, just simply predicting it. If the bubble from this bull run truly did pop, like it did in 2014 and 2011, then we will retrace to the beginning of the bull run which is around $1-2k. I do not think current demand will let us get to that leg and I think we will stop at the $3.5k leg. If we break above $10k, I will happily close my short and go 3x long because that likely means another bull run larger than $20k. 
Lol hes flat he can stay solvent until he dies.
Ok, thanks.

reddit is dumb, reminds me exactly why I left this garbage community
Not at all, richer than you fren, mucho wealth, mucho powerful frens. Just I don't understand the whole circle jerk "let's downvote into oblivion" community this has become. I've been here much longer than you, make no mistake. I left for this reason, because everyone would rather be mean than be nice. This world needs more positivity. There are many folks who struggle daily with problems and you jump on reddit to have a voice, you get downvotes. Whatever. I get it. Just like maybe be more accepting to new folks???? I've been here for 5 years or more. I went away for a while because of the cultish feel it started to have......downvote me or whatever but you know I'm right.....
I speak english just fine, I thought it'd be funny if I posted something that you can't understand unless you know english and spanish....guess I was wrong tho. Only been here for 4 years doe.....
It might not be what you want to read, but if you look at the chart you know I'm right. ;)
Accisations of breaches of the rules are also against the rules, which means I am also breaking the rules now.
No, you read something that was in your imagination and not what I wrote.
I'm no expert, but I think that if you have ever earned any money in any currency (or any other valuable) that you haven't spent, you have something that is either gaining or losing value relative to all other currencies/assets/valuables. So not doing anything with your money is equivalent to being long at one specific currency and short at all others (and by doing this you are helping the currency you have to preserve its value). There is no "neutral" currency, you are always long in one/some and short in most of them. Someone who has traded/holded crypto but is not trading/holding anymore (and even someone who has never created an account in a cryptoexchange) is simply short at crypto and long at fiat atm, not outside. 
technically yes LMAO
Technically yes I guess
No. that is truly flat

for 1x short, you would have to short 2btc for every 1btc you have at mex
for what? telling people the truth?

Weak hands by definition make the price go down haha. 
Solid post, gonna start using it at work now lmao
Does it bother you that the trend is down and the only time the price goes up is in $300 bursts which occur over 15 minutes (at roughly the same time of day) and then the price promptly goes sideways or down on low volume?  Looks like one or more large players using manipulation and fraud to prop up a waning market to me.  What does it look like to you?
It's an opinion on an investment matter.
I mean, were you there in 2013. That was way more insane.

I remember selling a couple hundred BTC at like 5 bucks in Dec of 2012

It was like 1300 a year later
I mainly use market order, like 95% of times. To me, the timing and positioning of jumping in and out is much more important than 0.2% trading fee. 
impatience/not believing you'll ever get filled
because for some people, its worth to just fill their order instead of waiting and missing out over a 1/4 of a percent. 
Fair enough, it's plan with tight stops. Seems like they are not giving up $6800 or if so, a supremely admiral akbar moment shortly after. 

I'm just picturing that there are some market buys set for mid $6800's that get triggered with a decent move, some bottom shorting covers and a quick $200-$250 move. But you could very well be correct.

You didn't really mention it directly so was a bit confused, and it felt premature for your whole analysis to be anchored upon something that hasn't happened yet. I understand what you mean now though, sorry. The rest of my comment still stands.
Thanks. I'm still a little confused here. This is just prices your looking at for the 3D?  Is there a way to set that up in trading view in the one graph or do you just toggle between the time durations and look for unusual length on all time scales?

I'm just getting to grips with EMA's, MACD stochastic RSI, and also RSI. I found some info from a trader who sets his RSI on this setting - length 2, upper limit 95 and lower 5. And since using that this last week it has accurately flagged up the upper and lower prices. But much to still learn.
6700 is still under resistance, the closer to 6800 the better the r/r on a short is.
> In other words, 100M$ worth of long position have been closed in the last 24 hours.

That doesn't necessarily follow, position size and funding used are separate metrics. You can deposit additional funds to reduce the latter without reducing the former.
Technically someone may have deleveraged their position but that's not necessarily the actual purpose. USD funding rates are often 0.05 or higher, which translates to ~~20%~~ 18% APR. You can borrow money cheaper elsewhere. So it may be deleverage for an expected crash -or- cheaper funding for a long-term long.

Edit: I came to realize this theory is stupid. The hypothetical long-term bull would instead withdraw coins for a better balance of counterparty risk and funding cost.
It's hard to forget someone who insults you for no reason.

I'm pretty far from obsessed.

Expiration is on the Blood Moon (lunar eclipse) on July 27
I'd recommend starting by reading Sam Harris' book on the subject, *Waking Up*.
r/meditation

Edit- also, Insight Timer app for your phone
Yes, my experience with meditation is actually fairly extensive. I've spent a total of a few months on silent retreats, meditating 16-18 hours per day, and plan to accrue about 2 years total time on retreat (~10,000 hours) within the next 10 years or so, in Burma, Nepal and Thailand. 

That said, I don't claim to be a particularly adept meditator. Though I'm not sure what mindfulness prowess has to do with pointing out arsonbunny's persistent transgressions, if that's what you're referring to.
You’re going to check in 1 hour if people are still posting low-effort bullish comments in the daily?
It was when I wrote it.
Quality posts picked up imo
Certainly true - it's why I don't have a target for my long currently. Targeting to close starting $150 below the band of resistance.
What do you mean “just under it”? Isn’t the log line around $7200 right now?
The quick retest right after breaking down hardly qualifies - this is a support on the weekly/super long term weekly, I'd expect a retest after a breakdown to look something like it currently does if we continue up to it (more on the weekly / 3d timeframe).

H&S/iH&S rarely plays out with Bitcoin, and you certainly can't count on one when it hasn't even formed. It's just squiggles right now.

Why would drifting up until it meets the heavy resistance of that log line and then falling off/failing not make sense? Lots of longs would likely start closing with shorts opening.
I'm not talking about you specifically. I'm talking about all the other delusional folks on here who seem to think shorting is a good way to make money. It's not. I made money longing starting in February, and I think I've only lost on a couple of long trades and one short trade. I'm 7 out of my last 10 with maybe a 40% profit, all told, and currently up nicely. You guys can downvote me and taunt me all you want, but from what I see, I'm probably the only trader on this sub who's actually making money so it doesn't bug me at all.
lol
How the fuck do you not have a plan for moving down beyond losing everything?   


Like, what the fuck guy. 
It shows $7040 in Binance, but it's $6700s. Data is for sure incorrect for some reason (they probably incorrectly convert $USDT). 
Dont trust CMC data, it is offen wrong, the Binance BTC price is actually 6730 by now. You can always go to Binance website to verify the information.
You can use bitgur instead of CMC : https://bitgur.com/coin/BTC
This could certainly get pushed up higher than here. Just saying I wouldn’t say the fact that price is increasing over the weekend necessarily indicates increased interest from Joe Public.
yes because people stopped using tight stop losses like they did when it was a bear market, so you no longer have cascading dumping 
What? that was a 75m volume 5m candle on bitmex(there wasn't even any big liquidations), there certainly was volume. There was just so many limit buy orders.
6684....fuckers 
Investing in *Bitcoin* is not the same type of risk as investing in any other "cryptocurrency". Most are scams and Bitcoin is the only project with a proven track record and viable long term trajectory. Don't buy the hype around alts and certainly don't buy into the bullshit narrative that they are somehow more advanced than Bitcoin because they're newer. 
>but is that the case now?

Maybe. You should try buying high selling low and let us know how it works out for you. 
Buy low sell high is a cliche and trying to follow it in a vacuum will lead to bad decision making. Like trying to catch BTC as it falls, then getting liquidated or losing BTC value as it continues to fall. There is also such a thing as "buy high, sell higher." In general, I wouldn't recommend taking the cliche's too seriously.
Koreans went to sleep
it was mainly because there was only like 9k shorts open after that! Tons of shorts closed. And no problem :)
The awkward moment when you have no defense for rampant and obvious fraud but "hey look those other guys tho"

Wasn't bitcoin supposed to protect us from the evil (((banksters))) or something?  Woops...
Calling /u/BitcoinTrolling101. Earth to /u/BitcoinTrolling101... 
We'll see.
I think September was when they would ANNOUNCE when it would be listed
Yes indeed
Dreams can not predict the future. Dreams are just your subconscious mimicking reality based on what it knows about reality. 
The point is anyone stating their position and the future as fact will learn a lesson from the market soon enough. 

He isn't flat in BTC, just dollars. 
Binance is tether only and doesnt have margin
All respects but you sound like my uncle that has had a few too many
Goodbye.
Well I agree people need to be more positive. Suppose its difficult when ppl are losing money. This is the internet - I wouldn’t take shit too seriously. My self worth certainly isnt linked to the amount of downvotes I get! Often it just confirms a point. Perhaps the problem isnt with the sub.......

And too be fair - you have no clue as to my wealth. I could be King fucking Ding-a-Ling for all you know. My gf can confirm :p

All the best. 

edit - Capital “King”
Last comment: "I've been here for 5 years or more..." 

This comment: "Only been here for 4 years doe..." 

Just a few more and someone might believe you. 
Everythings not black&white, especially not Bitcoin.
Im looking.
lol we are getting so meta
That makes perfect sense to me and I believe you are correct.

Going into fiat is 1x shorting BTC.

Going into BTC is 1x shorting fiat.

Makes sense.

Thank you very much for taking the time to explain it.
No that's 2x short my man 

if you have 1 btc at $10k then you short 10k contracts to be flat. 20k contracts would be 1 BTC net short

also something I noticed months ago: all this misunderstanding about what "short" means on bitmex makes me think there's going to be a tipping point where a bunch of "bears" on bitmex realize their crypto value has just been tanking because if they're not 1x short they're hemorrhaging money. lol. 

I wonder how many people here don't realize that having btc on bitmex without having a position means you've lost a shit ton of money over the past few months
>they're all using tether so treat the volume as if it was $0

How is *that* truth?

And where's the proof?

Just stop this nonsense campaign. Enough already.
It's an example. There are even more of retail noobs maxing out credit cards, borrowing from their 401Ks, all that stuff. We were in a serious, full blown mania.
Were not in a traditional market. I doubt you would be in crypto right now if you are only expecting 2x for holding years. 

Be completely honest, if 2x is phenomenal for a year for you then what should be normal gains? 2x in a half a decade or a decade. Yeah no chance you believe that. 
yes, that doesn't feel organic at all compared to the last 2 years. and i mean, I would still be worried if it was with 1000 swings or 2$ swings
I see you met 15 minute harry 
Yes, it’s actually been starting to piss me off. I want “normal” movements back.
Orly?
Thanks for the feedback. I didn't really see it that way before.
>it felt premature for your whole analysis to be anchored upon something that hasn't happened yet.

I'm always open to being wrong or for the opposite to happen, what I do is prediction, I'm not an absolutist, I'm just saying what I think is likely. Hence why I said that this could turn around in my post, I just don't think it likely.

And no need to say sorry, I probably should have been more clear (:
[https://cryptowat.ch/markets/bitfinex/btc/usd/3d](https://cryptowat.ch/markets/bitfinex/btc/usd/3d)

Go there. At the top right corner there are some little boxes, mouse over them until you find STOCHRSI & RSI... Tick them boxes. Maybe drag the boxes bigger when they load at the bottom of the screen. Go back 6 months... A year, watch the waves over time.

Look at these on different time frames. Try and discern movements and try and predict what they will do next. This takes time but once you learn it you can profit if you're smart and logical about what you're doing.
Well you are right. I am only looking at leveraged long positions. 

I added an edit in my previous post to point to what I'm refering to.
Sure, though borrowing elsewhere is beyond our ability to speculate. Right now there are plenty USD to borrow under 0.03% which translates to 12% APR or so 

edit: (I tried to math earlier and it hurt my head,  I'm gonna say 12% sounds right)
I pointed out what a moron you are, based purely on your posts and the way your brain works (or doesn't)  It was in the context of BTC price action and that was the reason.

Remember...short to profit from a price drop...go long to profit from a price rise. You're welcome.
Buy when there’s Blood in the streets!
Ok thanks much.
Shit i literally just said the same thing.  I've watched it 3-4 times in the past year. Life changing if you stick with it and do 10-15 minutes every day
Haha man... more often than not you have me laughing out loud. My gf is gonna start thinking I’m cheating on her.
lmao
Agreed.  Other than Sloppy going silent for a couple days at the beginning things have picked up.  There is really valuable perspective in here if one has the ability and time to sift through all the bullshit.
This is how I have it: [https://imgur.com/a/5aF8dt0](https://imgur.com/a/5aF8dt0)

so yes, between 7k-7.2k. Just a couple percent under it, same as here: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/avamh0Yi/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/avamh0Yi/)

Trendline was about 2550 we were forming the right shoulder at around 2300-2400.
That's the thing, is the entire last couple of weeks the breakdown + retest, and now we will reject and get the actual dump to 3-4k, or have we rejected the breakdown and are we now coming up to break back above the line? The only thing that makes me think its the latter is the fractal I posted + bullish signs on the 4H and smaller timeframe MA's.
because I'm a degen gambler, I accept this. I'd just rather put blind faith into bitcoin than into roulette or horses or whatever
You shouldn’t be downvoted. This guy displays gross negligence with his money and emotional responses to bitcoin. 
Cheers. Thanks for that. Been looking for alternatives. 
Good points. Hadn't thought about bitcoin dominance. Although if everyone is like me, they might have moved their dollars or euros into coinbase and are yet to transfer BTC over to an exchange. I would have done this but the price movements have paralysed me as to what to do. 
I don't really follow Bitmex. They have no-fee trades, right? So the volume is deceptively high and probably includes wash trading.

On Bitfinex, the volume was low.
Yeah, I’d usually set them with a little more wiggle room but, I’ve got a decent string a trades going.  I’m not really that interested in this movement to hold the position.  The 1D looks like trash.  I’m sure it’ll bart up but, oh well.  
That's not correct. There are SOME genuinely legitimate alts, with working blockchains that are adopted and being used by industry, institutions and individuals. To say that BTC is the only legitatmate project with a track record is a disservice to blockchain technology as a whole. 

Some of these could well be more advanced than BTC. In fact the success of blockchains will rely on more advanced chains being developed. It's like saying Dial up Modems are the only legitatmate way to access the internet and it's the most advanced way of doing it. 
I disagree. Investing in Bitcoin might in fact be one of the more risky things to do. Why? Because it is technology, and as you might know, technology tends to get outdated fast.

In fact, there are a lot of altcoins already doing a better job at what Bitcoin tries to do AND more. Bitcoin is version 1.0 of a blockchain use case, but investing in a good upcoming altcoin might be way more profitable. I actually think Bitcoin will be overthrown at some point due to its many issues and slow ability to adopt and change due to its consensus mechanism. It might actually have had it's best time in december 2017 and now be on a downward trajectory to zero.

Moral of the story; there is no safe investment in crypto. This might all boom or go to zero as its technology, which quickly changes or gets surpassed by competition.
My first long position was eth @ 680 and bitcoin @ around our current position, and I fell into the hype that june 6th would be the time to buy. First stupid mistake.
Won't I lose money by doing that? Or is this what they call shorting?
True true.. Most people forget simple logics here sometimes, logic that saved me from several dips..
Americans are eating cheeseburgers and pizza
Uh, it is. My stash hasn’t suffered from any arbitrary inflation policy since I bought my first coin in 2011.
i'm mind blown that people still say things like "dreams can sometimes be prophetic" in 2018 with the internet and access to so much information...thank you for being a beacon in a dark place. Yay science!
Get out of here with your unfounded science! We need to hook Russinuts up to a machine that will chart his dreams so we can trade off of them.
he is flat in btc....his btc stack can never go to 0 if he is shorting 1x.

All Hail King Ding-a-Ling!
Is fine fren, just I have more power than you, than a lot of folks. I have frens in the highest echelon of society. And I know what I is talks about. I'd rather enjoy myself than to get downvoted for no reason. It's all a joke. Reddit has become a sick joke. The biggest accounts frequently make the front page while everyone else? Downvote for that. Whatever. I'll leave again and never come back if that's what this community wants to inspire. I know people that you don't know and never will and that's fine. No reason for salt. Just saying, y'all need to do a better job of fucking being nice to people. There are so many good folks I know that have issues and struggle on the daily. I've been here forever and have seen the evolution. Maybe you haven't noticed but I have.
I have like 20 different accounts dumb dumb lmao

Well I hope it goes up in the long term, as I'm still a hodler, but the stoploss hunt has not ended yet so it seems.
You're welcome!
I guess it depends on your frame of currency. P&L in terms of BTC, that would be 2x but in terms of $, that would be 1x. I personally measure P&L in terms of $ (spot) especially in this bear market

Ahh yes Willy told me he ran into Harry at their last family reunion.
Ahh many thanks! It's making a lot more sense now plus that graph has a 3 day period but the ones I'm using on Binance are only minute, hour, 1 day or Weekly.
Oh I remember. I also remember how you deleted your comment about being liquidated after opening a BIG short in the low 6xxx.
Yeah that talk is good but I'd recommend reading the book if you haven't already. It's pretty short and easy to read, but still goes to greater depths than the 1 hr lecture.

I'd also recommend listening to his first podcast with Joseph Goldstein and also reading Goldstein's magnum opus, *Mindfulness* after reading Waking Up. 

Both of those books are treasure troves of information.
Yeah, if this can retrace a bit to form a right shoulder, the similarity is a bit striking. It would also turn this bearish wedge into a bullish channel. Still not seeing massive upside until a bit of a retrace happens first though.
Bullish on 4 hr and lower =\= bullish on weekly.

My mindset since breaking down from that log line has always been this bear market has a lot of gas left in the tank. Wouldn't be surprised by some wicks on the weekly down into the 3-4ks at some point during a long gradual bleed in the next 8 months, but I'm not gonna take action projecting that far ahead.

I'll certainly relong if we DO reclaim that line but I'm absolutely not optimistic about that prospect at this point.

I don't think we'll ever get a straight up 33% in two days dump to the low 4ks. At least, not down from 6k. It'll be a long boring bleed over months down to that level ala 2014 with bounces along the way.
You know, I saw ur analysis and it is pretty good, you just need to control risk management and you are in the green. Your entries seem very good, improve upon exit and loss cutting

I hope you can read about a post I wrote a few years ago. I lost it all, many times, and I was good at trading. It didn't matter. http://ibankbitcoins.com/btc/time-self-reflection-ibankbitcoins-past-trader-part-1

You can do better. Be better. Grow your stock logically and soudly. You'll make more money.
Because it seems we’ve already entered the greed portion of this cycle. I’m seeing low effort bullish comments get upvoted like crazy, so I can only assume they’re all long and waiting for others to push us up past resistance.
If you're feeling paralyzed, it might be better to trade with a smaller stack until you can feel a bit more confident/comfortable with the price action. Then you can slowly increase your trading stack over time.

Anyway, I admit it's hard to determine whether whales or normies buying here. Either way, I wouldn't be surprised to see normies fomo in on a break of $6800.
It was a dumb position to position to open, really, on my part. I really should have been playing a breakout of like $6850, or given more wiggle room like you said. I was just trying to sneak in early with a tight stop since i was with the family on the boat and no laptop. 

Now just have an inside bar to look at and likely miss a break while sleeping. 
> To say that BTC is the only legitatmate project with a track record is a disservice to blockchain technology as a whole.

Not it's not. You're just massively confused as to what a blockchain is, how it functions and what value it serves and *doesn't* serve. 

>Some of these could well be more advanced than BTC. In fact the success of blockchains will rely on more advanced chains being developed. It's like saying Dial up Modems are the only legitatmate way to access the internet and it's the most advanced way of doing it.

Lol, this is literally exactly what I was warning OP about. You are either massively confused yourself or you have a vested interested in shilling shitcoins.

> In fact, there are a lot of altcoins already doing a better job at what Bitcoin tries to do AND more. Bitcoin is version 1.0 of a blockchain use case

This is a meme that needs to die. Bitcoin is an open source, consensus-based protocol. Your argument does not hold up to economic and market scrutiny. 

>but investing in a good upcoming altcoin might be way more profitable.

Yeah if you buy and sell the right bags at the right times you can make lots of money. Same goes with any pump and dump scheme or emergent market bubble.

>I actually think Bitcoin will be overthrown at some point due to its many issues and slow ability to adopt and change due to its consensus mechanism. It might actually have had it's best time in december 2017 and now be on a downward trajectory to zero.

LOL! You are massively confused, my friend. 

>Moral of the story; there is no safe investment in crypto. This might all boom or go to zero as its technology, which quickly changes or gets surpassed by competition.

No, the moral of the story is that *anyone* can make an ICO or alt, that's not where value comes from. Value comes from consensus and the properties that emerge from that (immutability, censorship resistance, etc.).

Don't believe the shill hype. It's all smoke and mirrors.

No this is what they call "sarcasm" 
You would lose money from that, yes.


Shorting is like buying Bitcoin in reverse. Normally you try and buy low and sell high, but when you short, you sell high and THEN buy low.
Leftover 4th of July hot dogs actually
french people buy xbt ..
Flat earth society is drawing circles. 
Bitcoin is currently inflating to the tune of 4% per year, double that of USD.  
You're so powerful and have so many powerful friends, yet you waste your time complaining about downvotes on an obscure Reddit sub. Sounds legit dude.
"I have more power than you"

14 year old confirmed.
Cool mate. Give my regards to the Queen. 
Doesn't change the fact that you can't keep a persistent persona for even 5 minutes. 
Life ain't, bitcoin for sure is..
True.
yes it is confusing- but you said "mex" specifically. if you're shorting with fiat then 1x short at $10k would be $10,000, as in 1 btc short. 

on mex if you have 1 btc, you need to short 2 btc to be net 1 btc short. 
[removed]
So youre waiting for a 90 to 99% correction lmao. Thats literally gox level or worse. You fail to see my point, BTC is down 70% 
to 80% and bears are getting greedy with majority of them with the same price targets before buying in

How will big players accumulate at those prices when other retail investors are ready to jump in at a 90% or more correction. 

That goes with selling too. If you think BTC will hit 20k? Sell at 18k if you think BTC will shit 50k sell in the mid forties.
Karma is a bitch 
Non-sequitur.  Zzzzzzzzzz.. You are predictable (and pathetic), if nothing else.
True but we now have 5 days worth of daily closes as support at 6600. If we retrace back under that I think it will just break down.
> Bullish on 4 hr and lower =\= bullish on weekly.

True but going from bear to bull starts with lower timeframes resetting and becoming bullish, which eventually leads to more upside and the higher timeframes gradually becoming bullish again. Not discounting the possibility that we will be in a bear market for a long time but this is the most bullish we have been on the 4H in the past 2 months, I think that means something.
Thanks, yeah therea many areas I need to improve. Read your post, that quote is perfect, felt it many times
good advice thanks
Great, just what I need! :)Currently I have a long @ 6650 with a stop loss @ 6652. 0,66 btc. But this is only money I know I can lose. Already lost it in my head. Btw, how do you post your position for everyone to see?
Sounds like a designer drug
Incorrect

>In economics, inflation is a sustained increase in price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time.

[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation](sauce)

Increase in Monetary supply =\= Inflation
Yeah, that extremely relevant USD inflation number that kindly disregards prices for energy, food, and shelter...the only things necessary to live.  
Mining rewards aren’t inflation and certainly aren’t arbitrary. Sorry you sold, find a new hobby.
Yeah true actually you are 100% right on this
LEL yeah that's true tho i'm 11
Hahaha made me lol, you are funny fren, keep being funny, just don't be mean
You are an idiot but it's okay
Fair

For a guy with such high regard for himself, you don't seem too much aware that using latin words and insults won't win you an argument.
A breakdown from a small retrace would be super bearish. I just think establishing some support on a higher low would instill some confidence in longs. Also, the fractal can’t play out unless an IH&S forms here. I’m sure we could continue to go up from here, but I’m not convinced we’ll break the previous $10k high you’ve pointed to unless there are some ups and downs along the way.

Thanks again for sharing that fractal though. It’s kind of an interesting comparison.
We already had a bull div on the daily and consecutive ones on the 12 hr. No need to look lower than that unless you're looking for bearish signals that could signify a top.

A long term log line isn't going to be pierced based on the small time frame signals you're looking at. Those might get us there, but we won't likely break above it.

It's all about probabilities, of course - nothing is certain.
Ok then so what do we call it when the price drops 70%?  How many ounces of weed can I buy with the bitcoin I purchased 6 months ago?  More or less?

Sounds like inflation then right?  Massive inflation.

yeah, AK guy doesn’t know what inflation means.

Inflation is computed as the decrease in purchasing power of a unit of account across a basket of common goods and services. Bitcoin has an inflation rate, but good luck calculating that given it’s volatility.


My apologies, i guess i gave you too much credit. Seriously though, there's nothing wrong with being 11 or 14. It's just that you have so much to learn and the way you speak makes that painfully obvious to us older folk.  And again, nothing wrong with that. Hell i wish i was 11 again!  I
Good luck with your investments.

more non-sequiturs...more Zzzzzzzzzz...

And unlike yourself, I never say it is "crazy" to go long or short at any time, absent good or bad news being released.  That is because I am not a confused simpleton.

Well, it's not exactly a long term log line in the sense that we have been following it up in the bull market for years. Those are lower in the 4k range. It's a log line that is the bottom of the triangle that we broke down from which was about a 5 month formation. Bitcoin has done fakeouts out of all kinds of triangles in the past on different timeframes only to reverse. Albeit, none were as large as this triangle. I don't give this line the same significance as the log resistance that we broke above in 2017, or the log support that we broke in early 2018 at I think like 9k. 
Also, inflation is measured over a period of time, generally more than 1 year

Price is up 2x+ in that time frame
volatility 
Also, goods aren’t denominated in Bitcoin prices, so there really isn’t any inflation to speak of, since you can only compute the price levels in Bitcoin via another reference currency.

Best not to thonk about complex economics tbh

Economics is hard
How many ounces of weed can you buy with the bitcoin you purchased 12 months ago? 18 months ago? 6 years ago?

Still sounds like inflation?
HAH u think old is folks is future? Hmmmm let me ponder this absurd question. Will report back to you when I think I have the answer. This interpretation could be rather ambiguous in nature.
[removed]
I still see a pattern of latin words and insults.

Remember...latin words and insults don't win you arguments. You're welcome
Why not? Go to bitstamps weekly chart (BFX wasn't as significant back then) and draw a thick line (resistance band, not line) from the ATH of 2014 to the September 2017 ATH, and notice how welll it lines with the November low + recent bear market lows until we broke down from it.

Given how horizontal it is compared to other log supports and resistances, it's a very significant line the market has respected greatly.
Goods aren't priced in bitcoin because bitcoin is not a real currency.  It's really that simple.
If bitcoin saw the most media attention during the height of the bubble and various other metrics were on fire during the height of the bubble, then doesn't it logically follow most users of bitcoin bought at the height of the bubble?  That's why I am using 6 months ago as my anchor.  Why are you using 12 months, what significant event happened 12 months ago?
Not sure what your question is. I'm 35 and I do not think that old folks have all the answers or are the future. But you will come to understand that you naturally become wiser the more and more you learn over time. For instance, many of us learned during our teens that saying things like "i have more power than you" never accomplishes anything and only gets you laughed out of the room at best. Again, i wish you the best of luck with your investments. Good day. 
[removed]
The fact that you think it's even possible for either one of us to "win" this "argument" just shows your simpleton mind once again.
What is a resistance band vs line?

edit: but I see what you mean just drawing a line
yes, that is correct.

It is referred to as peer-to-peer electronic cash. The protocol can be leveraged to implement a digital currency
> what significant event happened 12 months ago?

A bit more than 12 months ago the previous ATH from 2013 was passed
That's all I want, laugh me out of any room you want, I know more than you.
[removed]
I'm just messing with you.

And for the record, you never know who you're talking to on the internet, so you should probably lay low on the: simpleton, idiots, moron... insults.

I'm a PhD student in engineering and your insults fly about 3 meters above my head.
On long time frames (and shorter time frames to a smaller degree) resistance isn't at an exact price point to the dollar but more of a zone where the resistance is concentrated around a center line (maybe on a bell curve or something).

For instance, if the resistance line is centered at 10k, there might still be resistance at 9.9k from the same line but only 50% as much. This allows for wicks to not have to match the line to the dollar especially on the weekly charts at such a large scale as they wick down into that resistance but don't make it to the heaviest part.
Cool story bro

"I know more than you"

There you go again lol.  You're clearly a slow learner but that's ok. 
Bro non-sequitur 
Yes, good point there and you could be a desperate sociopath, as well as being a simpleton.  Although I am fairly careful not to dox myself in my posts.   

Anyway, the conversation speaks for itself and I'm glad to learn I am smarter than an engineering PhD student, at least in this narrow context.

I learned every secret in the entire universe before you did but that's ok.
Homo erectus carpe diem indeed
No doubt you are!
Congrats
