Currenntly testing 3 things:

1. Downtrend from 10k
2. Support of ascending wedge
3. Neckline from iH&S

EDIT: all 3 broke

The persistent conundrum: 

1) Bitcoin is undervalued.
2) Bitcoin is still 10x higher than it was 1.5 years ago.
That's it boys, we can pack our bags and move on. $7.5k is the price per bitcoin.
I'm keeping my eyes on volatility, At time of writing,[ the volatility is at 2.78&#37;, one of the lowest in the latest year.](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/volatility-index/) Before May 26th this year, the 30\-day volatility had not gone under 3&#37; since may 30th of last year. If the volatility were to drop under 2&#37;, while the price goes sideways or up... I think that would be a good indicator that a bull run is coming.

This is just some notes I made looking at this shit

1D: https://www.tradingview.com/x/kCQ4g7jy/

4H: https://www.tradingview.com/x/jZ1CUQnk/

Bull case: We hardly had 2 green days in a row in May, after 5 green days in a row a pullback was expected. (Wanted to short over the weekend but didn’t pull the trigger) Maintaining 4H higher low. Volume kinda dead since 23/05 dump

Bear case: 4H, Popped back into the down trend, tested and rejected. Daily RSI still in downtrend, small rest or will it drop below 30 again? If drop below 30 we probably fall out of the meme triangle. Meme triangle + 06/06/18 double meme

What im doing: long buys set at @ 7430, 7345, 7275 and 7200. Stops 7k psychological. Bit wider stop on this one and only 3x. Buuut, cos im a degenerate, I also have an alarm set for 7345 to catch some alts too, stop 7k psychological on btc

We're still in our bull channel, with some hidden bullish divergence in tact.  But we have dropped back into the mid term bear channel we'd been in since $9990.

[Chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/908f7S9n/)

Either the divergence is confirmed and we pop back up and out.  Or the top of the bear channel pushes us down and invalidates the divergence, which for me, would remove all bullish hope for this current move.

Longs should be watching this like a hawk!!

Hit the middle daily band on both ethereum and bitcoin with decreasing volume. Think we are going to see a dip down to 7.4-7.5k, then we'll see if we can break the middle band or not in a couple days.
[This is the spot for the bulls to do it IMO](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Zh8UbyCT/)

Based on previous interactions with this line I'm expecting price to tangle in this area for a bit.  I get the feeling this will decide wether we head to the June Monthly Pivot or Support 1.

Currently in a small short position with a decent [entry](https://reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8o63z0/daily_discussion_sunday_june_03_2018/e02cczf/?st=ji08r5o6&sh=a9c51028), happy to close at breakeven if it looks like we are going to the Pivot.
BTC has been in an ascending channel now for nearly 1 week. Support and resistance trendlines are currently holding well. For a price breakout target it should be the height of the channel, so $8200 for a bull breakout $7200 for the bear. MACD has had abearish cross on the 15 to 4hour timeframes, so looking more like a breakdown at the moment, but if going long here an entry at 7587 with stops at 7547 would be an okay entry if you're leaning bullish for another test of the upper channel trendline . The upside for the bulls is that currently RSI is going downwards towards oversold which may cause a bounce, and the Stoch RSI is at the bottom which normally means a push upwards. [https://www.tradingview.com/x/dVD1yJQx/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/dVD1yJQx/)
Just found something [else](https://www.tradingview.com/x/8xxSuCom/) which favours the short term bull case.  Hidden Bullish Div. (Just took a *quick* look at the past few months price action and cant find a similar divergence   (on the 2 hour RSI) that didn't result in a higher high.)

So if this [support](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Zh8UbyCT/) does hold. We would be looking at a bounce.

A move below $7330 invalidates.

Im tempted to close my short here.

Thoughts?

EDIT: changed "Just did a *quick* back test and I'm struggling to find any (on the 2 hour RSI) that hasn't played out." to (text) because of comment below! Hope that clears up what i looked for/back tested. :)
We broke down out of the ascending wedge we've been forming since 7050 this morning, which I'm sure is news to no one at this point. What I'm watching right now is how and where we bounced. 7500 was about the most predictable and likely place to break the fall, and it hasn't disappointed. 

We're sitting right on the HVN for this range, as the 7500-7550 range has long been horizontal support/resistance. Additionally, there are two other trend lines intersecting right here.

Macro: https://www.tradingview.com/x/gqTJdm96/  
Micro: https://www.tradingview.com/x/TxKimTVc/  

For folks feeling bullish, this is where you want to long with tight stops. I see very little incentive to long under 7500 if it falls, at least until the daily pennant floor. 7600 served as resistance for *days*, and we dropped through it like it was nothing. This is not bullish. 

Our daily pennant floor is now around 7080-7120, depending who you ask (I have it at 7080). My admittedly bearish bias expects this bear flag to complete and that we'll end the day under 7500.

I'm holding my short very comfortably from about 7650 after this morning's add. I'll look to add on a breakdown of 7450. 

Good luck all.

Is it bullish enough for you guys or it's only me seeing every single day good news for bitcoin without any sentiment changing over there ?
Still out of position for about 4ish days now.

Missed my short entry from $7800. Canceled all my orders before vacation just so i could cleanse from all crypto.

To all who chart and trade everyday. Take a weekend off and enjoy life outside of your desktop or phone. It sure as hell does feel really good. 

I’ll probably stay out of position for a little longer. Opening a short/long here doesn’t seem like a good play because this $7500 is extremely sketchy. It’s like a magnet in either direction.  

I also noticed we slowly bleed down from $7800 instead of a big fat bart, which is definitely odd considering we haven’t seen it in a while 
I placed a long yesterday (reason: I thought the bounce from 7000 could potentially be extended to the falling trendline resistance near $7800) but closed it with a small loss. My outlook now is, as [MyFavoriteDude](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8o63z0/daily_discussion_sunday_june_03_2018/e0259fx/) expressed it: "So I think most reasonable thinking traders consider this rise from $7000 to be just another bear market DCB." I think we might see price heading downwards now and I'm mostly standing on the sidelines these days and not getting involved in shorts.
added to my short from 7746 I posted yesterday slightly, average short is now 7667
/u/azop - If you're still around, could we get an update to the rainbow charts in here?  Thank you in advance.
Short $7413. Broke back into descending channel. 

Will add more on any bounce. 

Buyers suck. Binance already below $7400. Expect others to follow soon 

Not the best entry. But was busy tonight and didn’t really have a chance to add 

Edit: 1H closed under channel support 
this is cool https://arewedecentralizedyet.com

Six out of seven similarly stable periods in bitcoin's history have not retested previous lows.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/aq65rC1W/

Six out of seven also eventually breakout substantially to the bull side.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/qse3hUCB/

Periods of low volatility are usually punctuated by traders being unable to make a profit and leaving the market in frustration.

I expect we'll see volume continue to fall for at least another six weeks. I think our trading range is probably between 6,6k and 8k through that period.
Short from around $7,590. 

$7,800 held as support turned resistance, and the rising wedge the market has been forming since the drop to $7,000 has broken down. 

Stops above $7,850 or so. 
/u/L14dy : the fair price of bitcoin is around 7500$. Plz sir, could you change your prophecy for a different value? It's getting boring :-P.
Under 7400.. we pretty much erased 4 days of gains in a 24 hours. Yikes.  
I thought yesterday was a bit too euphoric. Not surprised by this fall. 

I think I'll aim to long around 7100, where we last established and tested support.
Updated Bubble Aftermath chart: https://imgur.com/cO1EWMa

We have tracked very closely to the 2014 line for the last 13 days. The chart suggests to me that historically this has been a time in the "bubble cycle" that people start to get comfortable with the idea of the bear market being over (even though in 2014's case it was not). That said, I do not like us hanging out so close to the bottom of the symmetric triangle on the daily. If that breaks I will turn bearish.

Chart explanation: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8noyex/daily_discussion_friday_june_01_2018/dzxwn1k/
Just an interesting observation: Some of the alts, especially the ones that have had bigger pumps off their recent local lows (e.g BCH and ETH), have only retraced 38.2% of their down-move from their high in early May to their local low in late May. BTC is currently one of the weaker ones, and has only retraced approximately 23.6% of its down-move from 10k. Most of the coins are also currently sitting in formidable resistance zones, and this is probably why the upside movement for the market as a whole has temporarily halted.

It is easy to adopt a bullish sentiment when you see the market as a whole move up 15-20% over a week. "There's real strength in this push" is what we commonly hear here and everywhere else. The fact that this ascent has only been 38.2% of the recent descent for most coins shows just how much value most coins have lost in the last month, and this coupled with the less-than-encouraging volume on this ascent, actually brings a more sober perspective to the recent movement: which is that this rise can still be a technical retracement, and it is possible we lose steam over the next few days and continue our drop. Of course, it is also possible that the bullish momentum picks up and we continue to push higher, in which case, I will join everyone here to buy coins as and when important resistance zones are broken with vigor. 

My sentiment about this market's fundamentals continue to remain the same: that there is widespread fraud which will have negative implications for this market, whether now or in the future. The fact that investors are more willing to buy into the myriad of altcoins with strange names rather than an established household name like Bitcoin (just look at Brian Kelly every time he appears on CNBC to shill an altcoin) is a testament to the fact that it isn't easy for the layperson to assess the merits of the tech in this space, and hence fraud is more likely to exist than to be absent. 
There is currently no indication of the overall downtrend having ended. Given that the recent price increase over the last few days did not have increasing volume, it seems more like a rally due to hitting support and the daily being oversold rather than a true reversal. There is also a huge rising wedge. As such, I have closed my long from 7150 and shorted at 7730. I will hold it if it goes down. Given that we are still hugging the daily resistance, this allows the risk to be small since the stop loss will be tight and I can long once there is confirmation. If I turn out to be right, the reward should be much more than the small risk.

EDIT: Just dropped 30 seconds after I posted this lol. Now at a breakeven stop loss so there should be no risk now :\)
Added to my short on this bounce. Now 2x short.

!short XBTM18 add 7565 10%

As others have stated, 7600 fell without a second glance after taking days to climb through. 

Also, I love how quiet it is in here this morning.
Did longs actually buy the dip this time?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/XRXPrsDZ/ entry on 12 hour upward trend presenting itself over the next 0-2 hour period IMO 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/osOrddrI/  1 hour hammer closing with long wick and decent volume.  didnt quite touch the stock market friday close line (purp +) but pretty close.  see my 12 hour chart above... IMO buy between here and 4 hour clouds horizontal area 7380 ($100 below here)
7600 seems to be holding for now which is a good sign, but we'll have to wait a bit longer to confirm. Since 7600 was breached once it could be breached again. I also feel like this was just a shakeout to see how many people put their stoplosses right under 7600 (which was quite a few). This is also a good (and necessary) test to see if sentiment really has changed. And just as before, I still think it is up to the sellers to see if they can push it down. Since buyers were willing to push us up above 7600 they can and will do it again. But, if more people get scared and want to get out, well, I think it's obvious what would happen then.
Someone on /biz/ pointed out how there's been a change of direction within a very large triangle every month on the 6th. A top or bottom for the month. Anyone else noticed that? In some time zones it's the 5th.

To keep the pattern we'd have to hit a low in the next couple of days and then head up. All coincidental I'm sure but an interesting observation!
Two things I'm looking at https://www.tradingview.com/x/o3wPV9UW/

It broke down through the rising wedge but it's still inside the ascending channel. Would not be surprised for more chop to test back 7600 or a bounce to the top of the channel again which would be around 7800 currently. Breaking down through the channel would be very bearish, next support I have around 7300s. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/cq7x9qte/

Price is also hanging around the PoC right now, with some HVN that can offer support. A bounce here and breaking the top of the channel would make me consider going long. 

I waited yesterday for a better entry and got it around 7700 (7740 june fut). I have stops at breakeven, planning to close for a real test of the bottom of the sym triangle currently around 7000s-6900s. Unless this gets turned around fast, which does not look likely right now.
Just some simple daily candle: [Evening star candle](https://www.tradingview.com/x/7EkTj4MB/)

In this choppy manipulated market, high time frame(daily) evening star candle carries much meaning and is reliable, imo. We almost always made (at least) one more significant leg down after an evening star candle pattern.

I would make an educated guess to at least 7200. Perhaps below 7k.

Edit: in this shitty market, get back to basics YEAHH!!
https://i.imgur.com/yFDbwo9.png

My TA for the day.
To me this isn't looking like much more than a healthy pullback/test of the lower support or the rising wedge. I'm sticking with my analysis a couple of days ago that we'll grind up a little more towards 8000 around which we'll probably stall out for a broader test of 7500-ish. So far the grind has been a bit slower than I was anticipating, rendering the wedge a bit broader, but I think this only allows for the support to thicken up nicely. Despite our last wick out of the wedge, I'm still holding on to the formation for now.

BTC Longs/shorts ratio on finex has decreased nicely making a long squeeze very unlikely. For taking a position, I'm watching for the 4hour candle to close within the wedge (preferably above 7600) at which point it's pretty decent r/r to expect another test of the top of the wedge. If we fall out before candle close, I'm looking at 7450-7500 as initial "weaker" support and strong support at 7350. 

Chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/na534gwG/

Also took a quick look at eth (overall market performance is always important) and it seems it's getting rejected at the downtrend resistance, though I'm still quite hopeful that 600 will prove strong support, and otherwise a worse-case scenario support at 575. A move below would be very bearish.

Good luck with trading all!

Edit: grammar/clarity.
CME gap filled to the penny with the drop this morning. We can go up now.

https://imgur.com/zwKnQAV

People keep down voting me but this has held true 100% of the time since the CME Bitcoin futures were introduced. Literally every single time the gap fills.
I already bought a good portion of Btc that I have to hold for 12 months. If 7400 breaks down, I'll be excited to scoop some more crytpo up! I can't imagine who is actually selling at these current prices. I guess short term traders and those who are over invested are selling. I'd rather lose all my investment than sell for any loss. I remember 2011 bitcoin was in the 100 range. 

I'd rather hold now than live with the regret of what could have been if I never sold. The dollar has lost 2% of it's value for the last 30 years. Today, the dollar has 60% less buying power than it used to. Technically, on paper, our dollar has collapsed. My investment in crypto is a bet against the failed dollar. Maybe my worthless dollars will blossom into something beautiful as crypto.

TLDR 
Short term: IDGAF about all these barts/hiccups. My gut tells me short term traders are simply being toyed with by bigger 🐟 who are out to snack on ya.

Long term: I'm as bullish as a stampede of bulls. I plan on crypto replacing EVERYTHING in terms of visa, banks, and worthless fiat currency. Call me crazy but I follow my dreams. Yeah, I had a dream where various crypto was the main currency and everything else was obsolete.
Can’t check the price right now. Can anyone tell me the price rounded to the nearest 100?

Thx
Is this a valid channel? What are the rules for identifying a ‘channel’? [https://i.imgur.com/lcECIll.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/lcECIll.jpg)

Looks like my 7490 entry long was was too early. I’ve reduced position and will probably have to close if we break to mid 7300s. Still hoping that 7400 support holds 
Clear hidden bullish div on the 4H (black line) https://www.tradingview.com/x/av45a3bC/

If it plays out, might be a good opportunity for anyone looking for a better entry. Might be interesting to see how the wedge support plays out as well. Maybe even a decent play for a scalp long with stops around low 7400s.

EDIT: as /u/mandy7 pointed out "it's important to wait for the higher low to actually form in this case and we aren't quite there yet." I might've jumped the gun. It's still forming and could be meaningless if it keeps dropping. 


**[Position Bot update](https://www.anotherbot.info)**

* Changed the validation mechanism to use the extreme values instead of averaging the values between exchanges. So if Exchange A traded between 7500 and 7600 and Exchange B traded between 7550 and 7650, the bot will validate any entry between 7500 and 7650. This should be enough for most cases.

* Added ETH address for donations

* iOS users that want to use PushBullet but don't get notified try to log out and log back in.

* Pushed notifications should be working again until the limit is reached again. Might create different accounts to try and go around limitations if needed.


ToDo:

* Create a weekly stats post with the average PnL achieved by the last trades

* Implement the stack status mechanism. Every user started with 100% and considering each trade PnL, Leverage and Stack% the actual stack size will be calculated. For example, first trade with 10% PnL puts stack @110% and if the next one has a -3.5% the stack will be 106.15%  (100 * 1.1 * 0.965)

As usual, suggestions and bug reporting are welcome
You know it's a fight when people start market buying/selling 20BTC at a time. 


There isn't much to comment on that others haven't already taken note of. The only good news for bulls is that longs have gone up only by a small amount since our drop but shorts have steadily increased over that time. Other than that things are looking kinda grim for bulls. However, it wouldn't be the first time if we saw some fireworks nearing the end of the daily. There are a few whales that like to paint the charts. But whether those fireworks are beautiful or explode in our face is entirely up to them.
IMO this was just a retest of the 50-week MA. We can now move down. [chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/hYGHLfo4/)   
Although there is still potential to move up to 7.8k, maybe even touch 8k --- but at the end of the week I expect us to be under 7.8k again.   
Most likely I think we just go down here and retest 365-day MA at 7458, then bounce around a little before we break down.   
   
The reason I'm so bearish is because the volume is crap, I don't want to see every daily green candle have less volume than the last. Bulls seem very exhausted, and I just don't see how this is going to push much higher with the current bullish volume.   
   
I'm short from 7720 so obviously biased
7500 will hold. Quote me 
I'm considering the possibilities of a large bear flag on the daily. Anyone else?If so, we're looking at the low $6,000, which might induce even more panic on the market.

On the opposite side of the trade, people who like to draw elliot waves, are looking at this as a new wave count up... Too early to tell imo
Long 7490, adding if we dip to low 7400s. Will probably have to bail somewhere tight after that in the 7300s if the descending trendline fails as support as well as the strong buying pressure in that area from the other day \(high 7300's after we broke down from ascending wedge\) Scalp attempt.

Edit: besides being above this potential support we also have potential bull divs on small timeframes even those are shit, as to my reason for the trade. And as I felt a dip from 7700s was basically obligatory, the momentum of this dip is not at all frightening yet.

Edit: actually right now we are respecting the trendline from the two recent lows on the 30th and the 1st. some focus is on that now have to rethink original plan.  


Edit 3: I guess we are below descending trendline from bfex but above on bmex. We'll have to either break back above on bfex, or below the aforementioned support from two recent lows, range is getting tight between the resistance and support, probably in next several hours has to break one way. Not sure if will bail if we drop below or wait for the support from differently drawn descending line from 10k on bmex. sorry for no graphs.
We've hit the 0.786 resistance and almost hit the black downtrend channel. The bounce off 7600 was pretty pathetic. I'm going to short at 7650

https://www.tradingview.com/x/OuJkZFHA/
Adding to my long at 7520. Haters can choke on a BGD. 
What is this, a dump for ants?
We sat at 7500 exactly for about 30 minutes on GDAX two different times and buyers should be ashamed. 
Slowly shorting is the proper play.

Don't just go all in, but average into a short over the next few weeks.

Don't get overleveraged, just slowly short it. I personally would be adding to the position a bit faster as it goes into profit.

Let the bear market come to you.
So maybe we are in a broadening rising wedge \(bullish\) after all, what do you think?  
[https://imgur.com/3BalFdc](https://imgur.com/3BalFdc)  
Interestingly, the lower support line directly connects back to the $888 low from March 25 last year. Solid lucky number support for now?
closed 7490 long around 7415. Wanted to bail cause I was like a dollar from being stopped out in the 7300's. And i went long on an alt here so needed to reduce exposure. Would still be holding if I  had got a better entry price and could tolerate more losses. I would think we should get a retest maybe of 7450ish\-7470sih but id have to bail then anyway.
Short from 7550
We just broke through 50MA support on 4H and 6H, and the 200MA support on the 1H. This is going deep boys, at least 7200 on this daily candle, at least.
I have been bullish but have to admit bulls are weak AF , they are getting slapped around like cheap whores
Hey guys, TA noob here. Opened a very small long at 7590 with super tight stops. I'm skeptic about it, but it seems that this drop is getting a really hard time going through, and smaller timeframes RSI are already approaching oversold. Also, wedge support seems to be holding up at the moment. What do you guys think? Are these condition relevant for expecting a decent bounce back to the upper side of the wedge, or is this movement a signal that we're going down in the next few hours? I'm bearish overall, but trying to test my own reasoning... any input is appreciated.
Falling wedge on the 1H

We are back in the descending channel though. Interesting to see how it plays out 

Sorry for double post. Haven’t really been charting in the past few days. 
If the lightning network ain't a workin', then I'm still a shortin'! Massive gains since $15k. Not buying this price action. You're getting set up again for more profit taking. Good luck.
Is this dip caused by the hitbtc suspends it's service in Japan?
Model price based on tx rate: 7-day average: $4651, 28-day average: $4533.

 Model price = 10^-0.638 \* (tx per day)^2.181 / # total coins.

Explanation is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2hyl9c/daily_discussion_wednesday_october_01_2014/ckxhy9y) with [historical graphs of price vs. model](https://i.imgur.com/HnZQ9rv.png) (last updated 2018-04-09) and [graphs of other correlations](http://imgur.com/a/7koaG) (last updated 2017-01-30). The code is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2oyrfq/code_for_tx_model/) if you want to improve on it.


**Accuracy of model and recent bearishness**

 Note, that this model has been doing relatively well if it is within *the same order of magnitude* of the price. That is to say, it is not a very accurate predictor of price, and to be within a factor of two of the market price (as recently) is effectively no strong signal. However, the prediction did dip just before the recent pop.

**Batching, UTXO count and so on.**

I have seen no convincing evidence that batching is currently a major effect to reduce the daily tx rate, and a cursory examination shows a similar dip in the UTXO network measure.
I am interested, long term, in alternatives to tx rate (given lightning etc) but I do not think UTXO count is a convincing alternative over, for example, unique addresses.
Parsing the blockchain directly for outputs per block is one possible alternative to deal with batching, payment channels notwithstanding.
So this small dump did reset the Rsi on the smaller timeframes to neutral. The 50 4H EMA acted as strong support as well as the ascending diagonal support line from 7k. If this holds here im expecting a test of 7.8 and then 8k, but we have a lot of resistance such as the 100 4h EMA and the 61.8 FIb level. My guess is that if 7600 holds we will consolidate here for a while before making a strong move in either direction, probably around 16 hours from now, just hoping its up.
Close out short position as well; decent gains 
Price is staliling; Will was for a getter entry.
The 4H Ichimoku Cloud fits the current drop. Support is @7380 which will be more or less the low BBand.  Eth is back inside the 4h cloud also with support around 560, and also matching the low BBand.

Already closed 33% of my short here to lock in some gains since yesterday being stopped @ breakeven and missing out the drop... This time i'll turn the greed button down and take profits along the way.

Will be closing another 33% around those support values and set a stop loss 1% above it just in case it goes back up.
Meh still no volume 
This kind of sucks. Sellers definitely seem to be coming back. The only way I'll have any kind of confidence of us continuing to move up is if buyers can get it back above 7600 in the next 12 hour candle. If not I'm going to start thinking of an exit strategy. But the worst thing about this is that the selling doesn't even seem that strong. I said last week that we could just go sideways in 7k for a month and that actually might happen. There's not many people willing to sell at 7k and not many willing to buy above 7.5k. 
Back to 7600, flipping above and below. I don't have confidence that it will hold for long and if it continues to drop from here I think we can expect a return to the downtrend. 
If you're comparing a DCB to previous DCB, do you look at the % move or the actual price move to interpret the action?
Anyone notice how barts are used to absorb and dissipate bullish momentum while sell-off momentum is exaggerated and pushed to the point of flooring all oscillators?    You can claim it's because we're in a bear market, but Bitcoins price action looks like pure bear manipulation and price suppression.

 
We're testing the diagonal ex-resistance from 10k as a support right now. As long as we don't close significantly below 7600 on the daily (it's like 7575 or something for today), I'd say things look okay for the bulls, although it is concerning that ETH looks like a clear rejection from their resistance from 10k and a lot of alts are in profit taking mode or about to be. 4 hour macd flipping red is also not inspiring much confidence in this level holding. 
Everything looks bearish right now. But what do you guys think about us bouncing of the bottom of this channel?[https://www.tradingview.com/x/rMgti4hs/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/rMgti4hs/)  


Edit: I missed to short at 7,600. Do you think it will be better to wait this channel breakdown or short now?   
Edit 2: Also RSI looks like almost at the bottom right now at 1h and 15m.
[deleted]
It's hardly surprising now is it. We couldn't even manage to get back to the 8k range on this little bullish momentum.

Where do we go now? Well best guess is still hovering in and around the low 7s for a good week until we either make another attempt to climb or we just break down entirely and into the 6s.

If/when we do get back into the 6s we'll likely just repeat this same old cycle that we've been through in the 9s,8s and then 7s. Big drops, then some DCBs, then the slow bleed down, a pause.. Then a big drop.

Until there is some real fundamental shift in widespread crypto sentiment or the true bottom is found then this is just where we are. 
Short here still from 7670, stops from 7850 to 7980. Watching for close of 4HR above current levels (7660) to reduce size, if it closes below i'll probably add. Looking for 7300 then will reasses whether to continue or flip long. EDIT: Added 30% at 7620, ETH looks like its about to go sub 600 and we got a fair way down until we find some support. ETH shorts closing and longs opening, potential recipe for disaster 
Shorts chart looking ripe for a mini short squeeze here. We'll see how 1 hour rsi reacts when it gets in to 20's.

Seems like the only people holding are those in the 4K / 6K volume nodes or below, who can still sell for profit. Everyone else who brought in new money late last year is either trading coins with a smaller and smaller pool of other traders back and forth, or they are underwater and will have a finite amount of time they can wait. To think the weak hands were all flushed out is silly.

Without regulatory clarity, or a resolution to the tether question either way, you won’t see an unbridled return to the space.

Frankly the application of blockchain is perverted, much of the market is speculative proof of stake centralized nonsense anyway. Maybe it will really get cooking once LN is implemented, but what I think is more likely is that a decentralized POW project designed to serve the soon to emerge tokenized securities market will lead the charge as people see a legitimate application of a trustless distributed ledger that saves money and improves current systems enough to drive adoption. BTC needs second layer solutions to be functional and it is the best we have right now. 
Eh, screw it, this looks like pretty solid support and I've got a decent gain from my trade that stopped on me last night. I'm gonna do half that amount long with 3x and add after a $100 move in either direction. Long from 7500.
Monday morning profit takers. Up during weekend always tricky.. there are a lot of people not trading during weekend.

Get your popcorn out folks, shit is going to go down in the next 72 hours.
Adding to my long (from 7100) at 7550.

Been waiting for a dip for couple of days, this seems it.
Bitcoin is depressing lately just too many haters. In the end the general public will own very little cheap bitcoin vis a vis the greater population. We can't expect sheep and lovers of government and control to really step in and be apart of an open solution. I see it all over the posts not here so much but other reddits and youtube comments.. People suck and honestly while bitcoin COULD solve a lot of problems and give this world more decentralized control and more freedom I doubt it will happen because the masses are much like children and less than 2&#37; are leaders of any sort. By the time they get in it will be over $50k and the power back in the same old hands. Only reason it skyrocketed in December is people thought they could get rich \(whats in it for me mentality\) not .. oh great i want to get positioned in a future technology allowing more freedom for individuals.. not at all..  They only react based on FEAR \(fear of missing out or fear of dump\). pretty drepressed.. especially with new scaling possibilties and a lot of progress on dev side. The masses won't lead they will follow only IMHO

Back at the same levels as last Friday. So lets see what this week brings.

Bitcoin is going down. Ok now where are my 100 upvotes?

Yup. I see exactly what the big bulls are doing.  Big bears don't seem to see it so I'm not saying what it is, but if you're short, you're probably going to do OK again tonight.  If you don't, GTFO of your position ASAP.

1 is a potential. 2 is a fact. I hope 1 turns out to be the case, though, as I'm spending a lot of time trying to get more.
Undervalued according to who?
Bitcoin is only 6.6x higher compared to where it closed 1.5 years ago on *Jan 4, 2017 at $1,139.*
It was overvalued at $20,000 and it's still probably overvalued now, but the market will make that clearer in the future, day by day, second by second.
Price discovery was pretty fun.  I can’t complain.  On to some other shit.
Until it's not.
I think we've got more sideways price performance coming.

> I am not bitter...I don't want to fund some neckbeard's retirement

lol.
Dude, you are in quite well. Pile up some more months if you can or want - or not, because you should be able to sleep well - but do not worry. By this time in 3 years you talk of a lot more than some college funds.

I have been moving funds to the exchanges ince we went down below 15k again and I am adding to that for all the next months. I seriously think you are selling at the bottom area - there is a decent chance it will go sideways now (buy time). Anyhow, cost averaging.

> I was working with funds that were significant for me, and 
> probably lower than some of the big hitters around here.

This probably is the problem. If you depend on that money for long term planning - then you get sleeping problems.

I personally am adding monthly at the moment. It does take stomach. You talk college money? I win or loose that on a daily basis when we have a larger move.

But what do I care? - I do not depend on that money (although I am crypto heavy, way heavier than most people of my net worth would advice) I have other funds and sources of income. And this means I can sleep through a million or two or three up or down. But you really msut make sure you can handle the pressure. If you can not - look for some more diversity.

What gave you the impression that bitcoin is a short term investment?  Look at the fucking charts before you invest!   You can clearly see the ups and downs since its inception.  Eventually it will go way up again.  Going all fiat now is more risky than in January as we are that much closer to recovery today than back then.  
If you've been in crypto for 9 months, which includes about 2 months of the an epic bull run, and you're down overall you need to learn a thing or two about investing in general. It is certainly not easy and I myself, being an investor of many things for the last 20 years, is still learning and constantly changing strategies. But if you hodl and didn't take any profit on the way up and now cashed out at the bottom, you need to read up some investing 101 unless you decide you will never invest in anything ever again. I have made the same mistake you made many times over but every time has been a learning lesson.
Damn,  hope you learned how to take profits for the future.  Simple hodl sucks ass now.  I don’t give a shit if you entered a long time ago.  Watching your stack dump 65% or whatever while you just sat on it sucks.  If nothing else work with percentages.  Shit you have goes way up, sell some.  Reduces cost basis and you still get upside if you didn’t catch the top.  Such a simple strategy a lot of people don’t utilize.  Good luck in the real world.  Crypto is a new Vegas for sure now.
as a hodler, Crypto gets way more brutal. you have to be alot more Patient then with your old Assets. you should start measuring the Time not in months, but in halvenings. if you dont want to Check the Charts, Stay in it for 2 halvenings. this will help you trough tough dumps and im Sure you will be pleased in the end.
Imo 9 months isn’t really long enough to hold, esp. considering you bought shortly before a huge crash.

2 years+  is holding to ensure you outpace short term cycles.

However, mans gotta do what mans gotta do. Gl
"Historically, 10 days comprise all the performance in any single year of bitcoin's price," he said. "If you just took out those 10 days, bitcoin's down 25 percent a year."

This is why holding works. I guess same can be said of stock market, just not as extreme.

(Ps upvoted cause I feel your sadness)
Hmm, a little surprised, I'd have expected this sentiment to arise below the macro-triangle. Since it's still at a higher low, and we didn't see any really giant red candles (even since dropping from 10k) which I thought would inspire confidence.
Chill out man. Bitcoin does stuff like this. Always takes longer time than you'd want and what people tell you. It always bounces back though and it's going to make you rich if you stay patient to the next halving. That being said, staying away from the charts and staying away from this subreddit is usually a very good idea.
I really don't understand the all in or nothing mentallity. Why does it have to be yes or no, 1 or 0? Why cant you be partially invested? You dont believe in it? Fairs, no one knows where it'll go, meaning it could go crazy again.

So, why not leave that 3.3% you've made in crypto? If it goes to shit, you wont even notice, if it goes parabolic, you have your foot in the door.

the point is, it makes no difference to me what you do with your money, you can set it on fire for all i give a fuck, but in my opinion, once you're in, it makes zero sense to FULLY pull out.

Limit exposure? sure, why sell everything?
Haha. Write it off as dead money and check back in a year. That's pretty much the best Bitcoin "trade" I ever did.
I am relatively new money as well (March 2017 first purchase). I feel your pain, the first few months were full of awful decisions made by yours truly. And you are right, this takes up a tremendous amount of time after the family goes down for the night and other free moments of the week. 

I also felt like I had no idea where the market was going a time back, so cashed everything out and started DCA'ing what I consider money that is just gone from my life. Figure I will be out of some gains if an ETF is announced tomorrow or if the bear extends into the next 12 months, hopefully my average entry is between here and there. 

Good luck! 
Speaking of MACD: Since January the range of the up/down oscillations are getting smaller and about to reach the peak of a triangle. 

Does this have any implications? What might happen once this reach the peak?
Waiting for the 4H to close because it’s showing a  hidden div there as well. Would not be surprised for a retest of the top of the channel. I’m holding my short to break even. 
> Just did a quick back test and I'm struggling to find any (on the 2 hour RSI) that hasn't played out.

How can you effectively backtest divs that don't show up. If it doesn't turn around now, that it might not end up as a div at all and thus backtesting it will only show ones that confirm. 
Someone called a pullback to the 7400 area in yesterday's daily thread. 
I'm long.
Great spot. Would be one hell of a bear trap. I just closed out my alt shorts an hour back because the drop was too steep and RSI was oversold on smaller timeframes. Was planning to short on a bounce, this makes me reassess. 
Where is your short from and what is the goal of your trade (scalp/long-term)? I'd be concerned by reclaiming 7550 and look to exit over 7600. But that's where my entry is.
Didn't we already briefly fall below $7,500 or are you not counting that wick?

*If* this rises again, you gonna let this position go into negative at all or gonna stop it before that?  I guess it's still too early to tell, but I'm always weary of sudden unexpected spikes back up.

My ca is now down to 7625 (june price) after adding, I've added a BE stop since lately it breaks up when I sleep.  Similar strategy already cost me some tiny losses a couple times in the last week, but no regrets, I got into a better position and was secure in case that wedge broke up, but at least I already covered those expenses today anyway.
Crypto is already way more popular in Japan than rest of the world.

I'm pretty bullish considering all the news these days.

Sup CG, what price would you consider buying some BTC for the short term?  Good call about taking time off from the charts.  Read that you also play golf, hit me up for a game if you are in the DC area ;-)
I would hardly call that a slow bleed down from $7,800, we dropped $300+ in a matter of a few hours
Where'd you open the long?  

I'm guessing it goes back up to test the top of the wedge from here (hope not though, I'm sick of trying to trade this formation).  Closed half of my short to probably turn it into a scalp.  (Like I should have done on my previous 2 "break even" shorts).  Seems like you cold have waited a little bit more to get confirmation of dropping lower, or to have a chance of closing at a more comfortable spot up higher.

Considering closing the rest of it out and reopening a tad higher.  And even scalping a long on another instrument.  It's getting close to breakout time though on this wedge and the range is quite narrow, so perhaps close out more of the short to finish covering my minor chop losses, and add back to it on breakdown, and skip the long.

this has been the problem since $10k. Makes 0 sense and I really do not understand the mindset of these buyers 
Exactly the whole problem this "rally" has had.
Really interesting.  Did you write a custom script on trading view to display those 7 hypothetical continuations on the right?
Good stuff, but I wouldn't take too much of a bullish bias based on that.  Of the 7, only 2 led to reversals of the prexisting trend (4/6 upward breakouts were continuations). If you look at those periods which started with a down trend, 2/3 broke upward.
good timing
Same, opened a short couple of $ lower, waited for a clear break of the wedge. $7.600 was strong resistance, now that support broke at the same time. 
It didn't provide much support tho , we fell right through it 
I thought you're gonna short 7.8 bounce.
On stamp we bounced on the 10K downtrend. On finex we broke it. Do you take this into account at all?
lol, no. Prophecy stays
People got mad when I said 9-11k when were bouncing around there for a month. 


That's low volitility. If the price moves less than 8% it's not much of a change. The short-term market is still characterized by higher lows and higher highs.
That's when you know it's still a bear market.
Like that's never happened before. Lol.
[deleted]
If u scaled 2018 price longer it would look almost identical lol
Agreed, 100%. People are really sleeping on this movement as if it isnt close to what we saw last time in 2014. If we break, you also seeing ~$3k? That would put us in the ballpark of 2014, percentage wise. 
If you compare 2014 with 2018 and think it might fold out very identical and it is the time to buy now, becuase we went up in 2014 at that time, do you also think we will go down afterwards like in 2014 and if not, why not?
I think it's important to get over the "scam economy" in the crypto market, at least in the medium term. Yes, 95&#37; of the alt\-coins are fraud. But that doesn't mean this market can't survive for \*many years\* on this business model and thrive.

Many of the banks operating today on some worlds cities are just as scammy. Unclean balances, high fees, shitty service, unresponsive support, etc... yet they are thriving for many years and expanding.

Many people don't complain for service quality. I'd argue that the crypto population rather complain and care about $ and service quality.

But I agree with your analysis from the technical side. We have been in a strong down trend. And the pushes up lately were technical retracement. Some alts pushed lower more significantly and enjoyed a stronger pump these last days.
tl;dr: It can go up or down.
" The fact that investors are more willing to buy into the myriad of altcoins with strange names rather than an established household name like Bitcoin" 

BTC is not some kind of deity like coin, just because its been around the longest means nothing, it's still based 100% on speculation just like the rest of the coins/tokens out there 
Dam you're conservative. Smart but conservative. Fwiw I'm 90% stack short 8x from the 7500s. Have gotten good at holding underwater shorts

It's not exactly the 6th.  April 6th-12th was still basically deceptive chop.  But yes, we've been watching that conspiracy, and based on our distance to the support, and the previous week, It's looking like it could play out.
I've been using it for some time, it's very unfortunate the masses found out :\( 
Nice spot about the POC, hadn't looked at that yet today!

Good catch.
Maybe. 7200 seems like a good place to add to my long, and my hodl stack would love it. Hope you're right! 

Thing about being long in the long term: it goes up, you're happy. It goes down, you're happy to get more future money in exchange for your guaranteed-to-depreciate fiat.

Peace love and happiness to all. If you're short, don't be greedy because that next "inexplicable" massive run up is always lurking in the shadows, ready to say "Boo, bitch!"
Ya I was thinking oddly enough that the climb  to $7750 and drop today looked much more like the top of an extended rally ($11.7k or $10k) than the beginning of a bounce off the bottom 
lol dush sends me this every time the market pumps more than $50 
How is this guy not banned yet? 
Very true. Shorts went up 500 BTC on this drop, and longs, while there was a very large position that opened up, had a net drop of 200. 
can u ELI5 pls thx
Very interesting. Where can I find this chart? Can't find anything on the CME website.
This is probably an ignorant question but why do they do the futures with a single settlement date?  doesn't that make it ripe for manipulation where the price can go all crazy for a month and then they just manipulate it where they want before the futures closes?
Could you please ELI5 “why” the gap has to be filled? I’ve seen this theory multiple times, though haven’t found any information of why this “filling of the gap” should happen.

>are you long with me?
I'll tell you who is selling at these prices, and who wisely sold at higher prices given how inevitable this seemed.

Those who don't like losing money/want to have more BTC buying in at a lower price.

There is nothing honourable in "HODL", this isn't the stock market.
We get a lot of posts like this when prices drop. If holding is what you're comfortable with that's great, but this is a trading sub so most prefer to cut their losses
Translation:"I'm currently underwater with my trade, you should hold my bags for me"
Many of us didnt buy in the FOMO Frantic 20k bull run so everything over 1500 is a profit.  While that remains the case the opportunity for pain remains high.  There are sellers you aren't even allowing for as you build your trading mentality.  
> I'd rather hold now than live with the regret of what could have been if I never sold. 

Hopefully you're aware, but this is quite literally FOMO as an investment strategy.

From what I've read, divergences and the RSI in general should be ignored if they are midrange. 
Does that mean that if the 6th candle closes above the 5th, it will be formed?  
How reliable is this?
> Clear hidden 

K. If you  say so.
Think I'd prefer to have open/close dates on the site listing when looking at a single users history, so I can look back at the chart to see what was going on.   Though on the main page with all the users, that'd be too many columns.

The duration column on the main page is nice for sorting.  It may be more interesting/useful to sort by duration by default from newest to oldest.

Thanks again for the update command.  Way better for me with all the micromanagement I do on adds/takes.


Yes.  All relevant support/resistance lines converging into one tiny triangle, right at candle close.  This is ripe for some fuckery.  
Using those MA with a log scale is completely illogical. Good short though.

In all seriousness RSIs between 5 min & 1 hour all firmly into oversold territory and, 4 hour has reset from the upper half, daily is in the bottom half and weekly is still at the same lovely low from when we bounced from 6k and 6.5k.

I think last week quite a few people called 7k as the new local bottom. Do we just get higher lows of \+500 from now till 20k? ;\)
Very unlikely. I don't think we'll see sub 7k though.

Here we are again!
It's possible. Long way to go between here and there. If it converts, I could see something like this: https://www.tradingview.com/x/Urtxux3J/  

Break through the large daily pennant floor down to test the ATH downtrend line as support, up to test the pennant floor as resistance, then down to the multi-year log bull channel. 

Not my expectation, but I'm certainly curious to see where we go. 
> I'm considering the possibilities of a large bear flag on the daily. Anyone else?

One one else considers it possible that BTC could be in a bear flag.  Only bull flags, of course.
I think you might have another chance closer to 7350 soon, longing here is asking to be underwater.
There's a case for a scalp long since we are still inside the channel https://www.tradingview.com/x/VcW9um5O/

Just set SL a bit lower than where it currently is and where a fake out won't fuck you up. If the channel breaks down you can exit quickly. I shorted the top of the channel and I'm not comfortable going long above 7200 right now. But I can see this play.
Why do you think the bottom is in?  I'm looking at my chart now.  We're about to see a bear cross with the base and conversion lines on the 4hr Ichimoku.  The price is also pointed directly at the bottom of the cloud, ready to pierce it.  Then, we've got a wide open bear gap on the MACD.  I think we've got room to go down, unless this thing starts bouncing up soon, like right now soon.  

I'm still kind of new with this stuff, but I like how these indicators have predicted movements in the past.  
You longed the bottom. Don't worry.
Don't short because you think the bounce is pathetic. That doesn't make sense. A bounce is a bounce and sometimes that's all that is needed to make people feel comfortable that the support held. Wait until either support breaks or at resistance to short.
Good luck. I think there can be made a case for a rebound now, after a 2.5% drop in 16 hours. But probably a good idea to be careful with longs here, as we are on a down trend now and the area around 7500 has had unpredictable price movements, as pointed out by others here.
Damn looks like you'll be choking a BRD instead, hope you set a stop loss
Haters of making money can go long at 7520.
Good luck, pulling for you!

No but that pump sure was :D
How can we teach children to trade if they can't even find the bottom! The dump needs to be at least.....3 times bigger than this!
Lol, took like a week to break from 7.5 to 7.8, took 4h to retrace that move and you call it dip for ants...
it's just getting warmed up.
It's a triple bottom.
Can say the same when buying!!
Short from 7543
We broke 50MA on the 4H and 200MA on the 1H.... aside from slight variations in closing price these are the same value...?

Both cases your looking at a 200 hour MA.
The price is on a fairly steady downtrend.  It bounced from $6000 so hard that first time for technical reasons.  It just fell too far, too fast.  

Anyway, the chart tells almost the entire story, so I don't need to spell it out.
if it holds $7500 you're good but any lower and I'd get rid of it pretty quick
as long as yr stops are tight that’s a fantastic entry. I mean potentially anyway. Looks like a nice rsi refresh. But if we break this nice line we’ve been hugging the past week I suspect it’ll drop fast. if you’re bearish overall im confused why you’d open a long at a ‘crucial’ point. I’d say we are getting close to knowing if it’s a reversal or another DCB in a line of DCBs since January. I’m bullish cuz im a believer but I’ve had my finger hanging over the sell button a few times this week. If I was bearish I’d have sold when 10k pushed back hard 
Doesn’t look like it’ll take much to broaden that up into a channel. 
wedge... if last candle's volume was spread out over 3-4 hours...
Are you taking any positions yet?
What will happen at the end of that wedge? Down or up?
Remember when LN was going to come out within 6 months... in 2015.

https://twitter.com/starkness/status/676599570898419712
even if it works it'll take another 10 years for that to reach 'full adoption'.   And that's the generous bitcoin version of 'full adoption'.  You may as well invest in a fusion startup.  Same timeframes for ROI.



This dip is just the next logical step after the last 6 months of price action, particularly the last month, more particularly the last week. 

 No fuds or conspiracies or news is needed to explain this. 
No, I don't think more than a tiny percentage of traders are even aware of the suspension. I don't think you should be downvoted for asking the question though

Lmaooooooooo oh man this post just shows that people only look at volume when it fits their narrative. What happened to all the "volume is the same as it was before dec" like before when the price was rising?

BTW ETH volume on gdax was close to 50,000 we are currently at 61,000 with the price drop
Indeed, small selling amounts every time. But .. they manage to get it lower.

There's no major levels broken... The fact that this is going straight down so fast with no bounces is not good dude. If you zoom out on the daily chart it's very much a bear flag that's breaking down much more convincingly than our entire move up. 
there's no volume because its a ponzi coin and only a few hardcore baghodlrs cant accept reality - bubble popped.


Just really seems like the market is waiting for that single black swan event to finally dictate which direction we’re going to absolutely go. The sentiment in this subs seems to be about 50% bearish 20% bullish 30% on the sidelines waiting for the catalyst to hop on the train and ride it in whichever direction it finally decides to go full speed in. I don’t see anything other then a bitcoin ETF announcement getting BTC back into a bull market. At this point I’m not even sure a Korean and/or Chinese unbanning of ICOs/mining/exchanges would do it. 
>if buyers can get it back above 7600

a retest if the wege support line could holds as resistance could happen, but I think it is unlikly.
Don't worry, there's a method to this madness. Smart sellers are gone. This is one dumb ass little boy still selling bottom.

Show me 7k, then I would get slightly bearish.

I think in any relational comparison in any context (not just trading), you must use relative percents and not raw numbers. 

Look at how people can bullshit statistics/probabilities by just stating raw numbers and not relative differences for example. 

Then again, for very small numbers, a high percentage deviation might not actually mean something, and can be equally as deceptive...

What you are seeing is bitcoin selling off. People are selling it off.

Any interpretation about manipulation or suppression is your own.
We hear this mantra every time the price drops more than $100.
bear manipulation into bear annihilation, soon
> Bitcoins price action looks like pure bear manipulation and price suppression

And last year it looked like pure bull manipulation.  Wake up....the market is heavily manipulated and has been for years.
That's how RSI behaves in a bearish trend, no matter what market you look at. RSI spends most of its time in the lower range during a bear market, while rarely (if ever) reaching or maintaining above 70 on higher timeframes (usually the best sell opportunities if it were to happen).
FYI resistance from 10k is about 7350 on my charts, can anyone confirm?
7 day chart. Higher Low's.
[deleted]
That's the only hope for bulls. I don't think it will hold. Expecting a big-ass red candle at the end of this 12 hr candle
I think the channel is a bit wider. A bounce on the bottom of channel \(and 200MA\) is around 7470

> fake *walls

took me a minute to figure that out actually heh

And the motive for that would be what?
A hundred dollar drop overnight is not something bulls need to worry about. The only thing I'm worried about is my fiat not arriving at GDAX before the next big run up. 

By the way, I buy to hodl at GDAX and trade on another exchange. Does anyone else on here do it that way?
Thanks for the daily reminder!
Rule 2
You are thinking in terms of fundamental analysis, which apparently the crypto markets don't care about.
I have to tell you, but you need to shut down your absolutes.

Some of us are still buying with a 5 - 10 year holding horizon.

The way I read the fundamentals - we are moving stronger and stronger. LN will make a change. Ignore all YOU (and your people) - think third world and countries with totally untrustworthy corrupt governments. Serious use case there.
Gonna be honest, "Eh, screw it" is in my opinion one of the worst possible motivations for making a trade. Also, justifying an iffy trade based on a recent success is also a bad reason to make a trade.

I don't want to sound like I'm judging you—you have a decent plan with your position here. I'm just sharing this advice because I've personally made some of my biggest losses by trading with an "Eh, screw it" mentality.
I don't believe you. 
> add after a $100 move in either direction.

I've often found myself considering the same thing. I've recently accepted that if i find myself in that situation that I'm probably married to the position, and will use any logic to add to it, so now I just add at that moment or wait for a more significant signal. 


Keep believing that if it makes you feel better 
I agree.  Returning to friday US stock market close price is very common both when we pump and when we dump on weekend.

I made this indicator for tracking it: https://www.tradingview.com/script/LJxwr2ZL-Line-from-Start-of-Friday-to-End-of-Sunday-v1/
Thanks random stranger, immediately sold all my btc
amazing advice, I can see why you do it professionally
And who's gonna sell all those coins suddenly?
Lets see your charts bud
What's going down? Hint?
https://imgur.com/a/TmnrQ19
It took couple of days to break 7.6 resistance, we didn't even notice it as support on the way down... Risky add.
The issue largely stems from a misunderstanding of value as it relates to 'crypto'. There's likely to only be one major winner in this PoW hard money that most of us are after.

Craze over alts will die with more awareness and time. The tech is what's important, it has to appeal and subsist even when the populace is beyond reproach.
Well at least we have you, up on your high horse, in it for the 'tech' and 'for the people' and not for the gains 

Oh wait, that's a little ironic isn't it, that you spend a lot of time trading BTC to make money... Why aren't you donating your BTC to spread the word if you're as altruistic as you make out... Hypocrisy 
Bitcoin won't have real value until people don't care what its usd value of it is.  Until then its just a glorified ponzi coin.



It's going to most likely get more and more depressing for those who still think crypto is going to be allowed to change the world.  You guys are going to get a rude awakening if you aren't already awake by now.
People can't be trusted with power. Government never did anything to people, it's people who harm people. Like here in crypto markets. A bunch of whales ruining it for everyone. And I'm sure exchanges are involved in the manipulation as well. It was a nice experiment but it's time for government to step in.
There is some bullish divergence. A bounce would make sense. Our last significant low was 7330. If it bounces, you might get another sell opp at 7.6k to paint a lower high in the bear scenario

Still 35 minutes left on the hour and currently it's not there as the hourly is red.
We're in a healthy fall since 20k.
The fall from $7800 definitely feels more organic.

No GMO bullshit

Nooooo baby don't leave me here alone with the beartards
Yeah no
It's not about buying the Bitcoin, it's about sending a message.
Very few people paid more than 8k per BTC. No reason why the price should climb rapidly after a bubble bursting. Check out how long Microsoft stayed down after the tech bubble - took 16 years to hit it's ath and it's not a garbage company no one knows about. 

Also consider Microsoft is a success story. Many companies never regained their ath prices, even today.

I'm not saying it will take 20 years to recover, it took about 3 last bubble.

You should probably short then 
Lol you’ve been posting in this thread all day how you’re done with bitcoin. Get out and delete your reddit account while you’re at it. You clearly invested way too much in this market despite rule number 1. 
Expound?
> If I sell my btc now and withdraw $X from coinbase that money is toilet paper.
If you bought a house for $200k and then can only sell it for $100k where do you think the other $100 went? :O
Part of it went to my bank account.
It's an interesting discussion though, as it helps to visualise what's going on.

Here's an example...

\-\-\-\-

Barry has $20k in USD

Geoff has $10k in USD

Jane has mined 1 BTC but is out of pocket the mining cost for 1 BTC \($miningCost\)

\-\-\-\-

Initial inventory:

Amount invested in that Bitcoin = $miningCost

Total Cash = $30k

Value of everything = 1BTC \+ $30k \- $miningCost

\-\-\-\-

Based on your description:

Jane sells Barry her BTC for $20k

Barry holds the coin but later panic sells for $10k to Geoff.

Barry now has $10k in USD \( Rekt! \)

Geoff has 1 BTC

Jane has $20k in USD

\-\-\-\-

Final inventory:

Amount invested in that Bitcoin = $10k

Total Cash = $30k

Total of everything = 1BC \+ $30k \- $miningCost

 \-\-\-\-

SUMMARY

No money was "lost" it simply changed hands along with the BTC.

However, the "inflow" \(aka the amount of money people have paid for the Bitcoin\) has changed.

Based on our previous conversation I think the confusion is most likely the terminology. The amount paid for the Bitcoin has changed, it's value has changed, but nothing was lost, just moved around.
>We Have to Go to War With Bears  

>They are playing dirty. If you hold Bitcoin and say and do nothing while you lose money you let them cost you money. Bulls have to fight back. Even if it's 20 dollars on Coinbase pick up a little bit extra. It only requires stopping the momentum a little bit here.

>They are going to be all over this thread. They want so badly to knock this price down. We can stop it. I've moved 10 percent of my alts into Bitcoin.

>That goes a long way to messing up the bots trading because they are targeting different ratios at different prices on the alts. That causes them to buy into the alts to keep the ratios at historic levels because they see the price "out of balance. The new demand for btc causes the price of btc to increase (if done on a large enough scale). The increase in the btc price causes the ratio to become out of balance and the bots to buy the alts to keep it in balance.

>The key is to move 10 percent out of alts to get most of the gains from the increase in alts when the price of btc goes up.

>Almost all negative posts on here are planned FUD. The manipulation is that extreme.

Fucking lmao

2 weeks ago you create that excellent post about all the money flowing into crypto every day and now this?

Bears seem to be trying to capitulate, which makes me bullish AF actually
Cool story
And what makes you think r/bitcoinmarkets is THE place to say this? What do you expect to get out of this, other than getting downvoted into oblivion? 
lick my balls please 
Let's downvote this scumbag into oblivion shall we
"bitcoin will never go above 1k again"

"bitcoin will never hit 2k"

"3k was the top, see that crash to 1800 its over"

"5k is a pipe dream"

"you are a bulltard for thinking btc can possibly go to 10k"

etc, etc

We may very well be in for a few more months of down/consolidation but 50k is a a *certainty* for the next bull market, considering we went 200-20k, the next run should be 2k,3k,4k,5k,6k-100k+

It’s the intro to American Psycho  
Could very well be DCB, if thats the case then we fall out of meme triangle, RSI drops below 30 and we probably bounce quite soon again but stops at 7k if it is DCB.

Target wise, low leverage so kinda gonna see how far i can push it, need to read on how funding works so i dont get mugged off on funding by holding will deffo take profit near the top of meme triangle in case we get rejected there

Well, if you enter at $100 you would have sold everything by $5000, because shit goes way up indeed. Problem you have no clue where it goes.

I have tried to do this in 2 bubbles now, and I will say it does not work in real life. Only thing bubbles teach you, is that holding works, everything else cost you money because you usually have to buy back above where you sell. 

After 6 months of bear market, we are still above $5000 which I considered absolute top last year this time. Even getting the order of magnitude right would be very good accomplishment.


Take out the top 10 losing days too, I wonder what it will look like then.
No he longed the top yesterday  and a few weeks ago. I think he's just very frustrated. Hopefully he's okay 
Good call on the 4 Hour!!
You're right I can't, impossible. But i cannot find one that did show up, that didn't bounce...

> So if this support does hold. We could be looking at a bounce.


DCA is low 7700 it's a decent entry that would be a shame to give up.

I'd be targeting a higher high, as thats what seems to happen with these divergences: [top of this bull channel](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ej3W8Ou1/).  I feel like this swing isn't beyond salvage for the bulls. And $8k is achievable.
Well timed comment!
I wasn't counting the initial wick since we bounced and held it. This is a breakdown though. 
Indeed. Seems like it.
Position updated with success.

* Position: short xbtm18

* Opening value: 7,680.00

* Average value: 7,629.00

* Leverage: 5.00X

* Stack: 55.00%

* PnL: -0.13%

[Check Open Positions](https://www.anotherbot.info/)


send an ! short XBTM18 update 7605 5x 55%

This will set your avg price to 7605  with 5x leverage and 55% stack
At this stage I'm riding very tight stops. I have them high enough to avoid getting wicked if we rocket back towards 7600 without holding it, but if we do that, I'll be babysitting a close at breakeven. I'll be quite surprised if we get back over 7600, though, which is why I left my CA over it. 

Right now we're retesting support as resistance, so we'll see how that plays out. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/DccFNVTx/
I know, but don't you think it could be something usefull for noobs or big investors with all their new products they're working on recently ?
Correct, which is why bitFlyer opened in the USA before Coinbase opened in Japan.
This is not cool.
They need to fix this. It can't stay like this for ever...
There is no capital gains tax, only income tax, so it is added to any other income you have. Also, 55% is the upper limit, I think if your income is >$300,000 a year. Otherwise it is less. 
This is fucking disgusting. Is Japan communist or something? Seriously, how does utter garbage like this get approved or passed?
I have drawn absolutely 0 TA in 5 days, so I’m pretty clueless about the market right now. All i know is we were rejected off $7800 and $7600 didn’t even act as an ounce of support. 

If I was to long without looking at charts and just using previous strategies, I would long from $7200 ish and maybe DCA Down to 7k. 

I’m also a scratch golfer, so prepared for a hearty ass woopin 
Compared to what we are used to seeing, I would consider it a “ Slow “ bleed.

I agree, now the run up on the other hand now THAT was slow
Open $7726. Close $7705. 

> Seems like you cold have waited a little bit more to get confirmation of dropping lower, or to have a chance of closing at a more comfortable spot up higher.

You are right about that. I should have waited it out, but the trading already took too much of my "quality time" yesterday, so I decided to close at that point. 

It's a tricky situation now, and I wouldn't recommend anything really, but what's clear is the volume was low during breakout but increased as we dropped, which likely means the wedge will break down eventually. We might go up one more time though, as you mention. Trade carefully, and good luck.
Moonmath has the moon-ie ones, yeah.  I'd be interested in the full suite.  And Azop gives it such a personal touch.

Thanks for the reminder though.
When tested again, I dont expect it to hold. Sellers are in control 
I dare you to ask them (iota)
i linked the speech i found website from.  believe its legit, i don't know much about Iota though so can't comment
maybe because there's not much reward in mining it?
I have it at $7615 (Bitmex and Bitfinex)
Why is that a "problem?" You hand somebody your money, they're gonna take it. Supply and demand. Even with nine years of historical data and very basic math involved, some people can't see the inevitable. Their loss. 

I sold an unneeded thing recently. Only 25 percent of that money is on its way to GDAX. Up, down, or sideways, I'll be buying and taking sellers' money for a while.
The are maybe 200 hedge funds and who knows how many whales. They spend money to drive the price or to support it. This is true especially now at this stage of the market..
Yeah. I modified it to remove projecting the price from before today. Other than that, it's the same as the one I use in this:

Six out of seven come after the reverse from market bottom. 1/7 come after a market top. It doesn't trigger a reversal, it's part of the confirmation.
It served as strong support following the big green candle.
The wedge didn't end up climbing that far though, so this is perhaps the remaining chance. Or are you asking why he didn't short the 7800 rejection as "close enough"a few days ago?
Nooooooo :( 20k or 3k prophecy plz 
They were mad cause 7.5 is the fair price :P
So you're painting this as a positive?

Remarkable 
Like Crypto Chad said the other day, it's never been a bear market. Maybe 2014, but look what happened if you bought that dip, Dogg. I did. That's what gave me the luxury of finding you amusing and not even the least bit annoying.
It is really bearish if we get that low but we could double bottom there just as we double topped at 11.7k. Everyone thought that at 11.7 it was moon time, but then it reversed and we haven't recovered since. If we go back to 7.1k I think there would be similar sentiment that we are guaranteed to die and we could just as easily reverse.
Yeah, I'll open a small position with tight stops and scale into a long if it holds
The thing people keep discounting is IF we even come close to approaching 3k. There will be a huge demand  spike...

Sideline money is absolutely a huge factor people are not accounting for. I am not saying 6k is a local bottom but just like resistance functions, support does. In the case of BTC even more than you can imagine.

Pure percentage comparisons are kinda silly given that the percentage of people that know about BTC now has significantly increased.

The only way 3k is realistic is if we have a long \(and I mean long, many many months\) slow bleed. And major downward movement will likely be bought up out of FOMO \(or savvy believers\).
So what about the 400,000 stolen Gox coins being dumped in 2014. Those don't matter? Sorry guys, I lived through that market. Bought most of my coins in that market. This market is NOTHING like that.

I know all y'all panties get moist every time the price drops 2 percent, but put on your thinking caps. There is no comparison. 
It's possible but I think this bear market will be shorter than 2014. In 2014 the biggest exchange Mt. Gox collapsed, the Silk Road coins were being auctioned off, the inflation rate was higher, etc. Plus 2013 was a crazy year with two big bubbles and that needed some time to deflate.
I'm not making any price predictions. Just presenting a more solemn perspective of the current market to the good folks here.
Only alt shills think that. Bitcoin has the proven model, a talented set of developers and strong network effect. Most alts don't even come close. 
It's based on a *little* less speculation than the rest. It's kind of silly to say bitcoin is on par with dentacoin in terms of real world value, even if you believe bitcoin is largely valued on speculation
Well, I rode a 100% 13x short from 8300 to 7300 and scalped smaller movements along the way. My trading stack is significantly bigger than it's been to date, and I haven't yet pulled the gains out to cold storage. If I pull what I plan to, my current position would be close 5x full trading stack. 
Learning from his risk management, generally the losses I take these days are insignificant enough that I can lose 5 or 10 times and still make it all back and more in a winning trade or two. 
I had adds in to go up to 2.5x last night, but only one of them hit. There's a part of me that wanted to go 5x on this bounce this morning. It would have kept my average over 7600 still. If this whole thing was a technical bounce, though, I should have plenty of opportunities to add. 
[deleted]
i haven't seen any sort of follow through from bulls in months. 
Not at all, actually. We haven't really seen a short squeeze or long long squeeze. The pumps and dumps are happening because of large positions opening. We pump when someone takes out a large long and dumps when someone takes out a large short.
There where many FUDs all these times arround the 6. We have no fud news pushed. Somehow it's waiting for unexpected. 
Why unfortunate?  The larger the self fulfilling prophecy, the easier the trade.  It's not about outsmarting momentum, it's about riding it.
I find it smoother and more convenient for trend trading. 
Chaikin money flow
Thanks man
I am sorry but I smell a bit of hopium and bull bias
Yes, the volume was pathetic. Real bounces dont' give us time to buy, like that $1000 BGD. In hindsight, the run up to 7700's was a detectable enticement/trap. (But of course, only in hindsight :D)
Why is the dushman still not posting here? I kinda enjoyed his posts.

Rule 4. Please report and downvote if you think it violates the rules.

/u/Crypto_Chad69  hasn't been banned because he gets upvotes and doesn't get reported. Even this post, which you're complaining about, doesn't have a single report. His posts are usually funny if they're not serious. People seem to like his contributions and he avoids being directly rude to people.

My hope is that we don't have to ban people. Chad will probably continue to get warnings if/when he breaks rules. Part of his humor seems to be finding where the line is and riding that. I can appreciate the effort and thought he puts into that alone.
How do you see the amount of btc shorts/longs went up with? I was only aware you could see the amount of shorts/longs?
The CME Bitcoin futures market is only open 5pm-4pm Central Time Sunday - Friday. 

This leaves a "gap" in the price action from 4pm Friday until 5pm Sunday every week while the CME is closed. You can see these gaps for yourself by pulling up the chart in TradingView. Type BTC1! and you should see "BITCOIN FUTURES - CME GLOBEX".

You can think of the "gap" as whatever happened to the price on the other exchanges during the time when the CME was closed. 

When the CME opens again, the price across all exchanges will "fill" the gap left over the weekend. So if the price has been going up all weekend during hours when the CME was closed, you can bet the price will retrace to "fill" the gap once the CME opens. This is what happened last night/this morning with the drop we had. The price fell EXACTLY the amount needed to fill the gap.

I don't like that this is happening but it has been very predictive (perfect actually) since the CME started BTC futures.
Type BTC1! in tradingview and it should come up as "BITCOIN FUTURES - CME GLOBEX"

I have no idea to be honest. I have also never heard a good explanation for why this is happening. It doesn't make any sense to me why it should be filled, especially with the amount of volume at other exchanges that could move the price in the opposite direction.

 Some of the large proponents of this idea are **hoping** that one day the price will break away from the gap and not fill, possibly signaling the start of a longer term trend.
I like to draw it like this: https://imgur.com/D5OL9Rn

Tradingview actually splices out the dates that CME is not open so that gaps will appear as vertical gaps in the chart (Yellow lines). The blue lines are where the price retraced to fill the gap.
Don't see you so vocal today with your "we're going to fly through $10k" nonsense hahaha

Liquidation point at $7200 or so? Don't worry we'll be there soon
nice try :)

Or only used in the most extreme cases (>80 or <20
A hidden divergence is just a specific type of divergence. It doesn't have any effect on whether it's clear or not, it just means that the indicator is moving more extreme (more oversold or overbought in the case of RSI) while the price makes a higher low/lower high.

That said, it's important to wait for the higher low to actually form in this case and we aren't quite there yet.
and it is converging
???
You have that info if you mouse hover the opening value. If you click on the pair column you can also see all the changes made to that position. This is fine on desktop, but i can see an issue when using on mobile.
Still need to implement a real time order by on the duration column to make it faster to use.

Agree on the default sort, will change to new positions first.

Updated the ToDo list. Thanks for the input
Candle closed. No fuckery detected.
>Using those MA with a log scale is completely illogical.

Why?
Right.
We bounced off the 50-week and bounced off the 365-day perfectly just now.  
It works so I will keep using it.  
What scale you use doesn't matter unless you draw trendlines.
I agree, this does seem possible.
The bottom, eh?
Huh? Why would you not short a weak bounce?

Wouldn't you buy a weak dip? 
[deleted]
Please enlighten us with your infinite wisdom what we should be investing in.
Yeah, like central bank inflated equities, property who’s value is directly linked to trillions of securities on said banks books, bonds directly linked to those artificial interest rates...shit, might as well get yourself a leveraged Euro/USD forex trade going.  Let’s fucking party.  I personally love equities at the moment.  I’m totally banking on US blue chips purchasing another 3 trillion dollars of their own stock in the next 8 years of this bull market.  
Stairs up elevator down is normal behavior for bull markets
Very true, but I only buy when there is about to be a bubble, not during (well maybe a bit near the end of) bear markets :).
Not sure why you got downvoted. 
*Bangs head against the wall* Duh, my bad lol
Thanks! My stops were tighter but I'll adjust then. Always loved reading your comments btw, I think you've been one of the few voices of reason in this low btc and post volume hell.
Thanks for the input! I've mostly opened it based on the wedge support and this pattern of relentless dip buying of the last few days, but I ultimately think we're going to test the bottom of the daily triangle again... only not today. It was more intended as a scalp to test my noob skillz, so I'll probably flip to short if the support breaks convincingly.
Nobody here knows that's for sure 
The cycles in the big triangle have been alternating up and down about every 30 days, changing direction around the 5th or 6th of each month. So it would actually be right on schedule if we drop to about 7100 within 24 hours, touch the bottom of the triangle and then climb to the top of the triangle by late June/early July. 
Shorts have been increasing... No ss yet but potential forming
Will was for a getter comment


Standard of cryptowat. Don't know a lot about it so i dont mess with the parameters
Absolutely no where near the bottom, roll on a full reset to pre hype prices, $4k or so I'm banking on
>"volume is the same as it was before dec"

The only people saying that were moon bois responding to people talking about low volume.
13.5k btc bought and 20k btc sold on finex in the past 14 hours.  Expecting to see this balance out a bit more before the daily candle closes in 10 hours.
I'm sorry, but I'm not understanding your comment. Which support line will hold as resistance? Are you saying that you think it is unlikely that we will go to 7600 to retest it as resistance or that 7600 acting as a resistance is unlikely?
You bearish fuckers just can't accept the reality you sold and continue to short bottom. Getting shaken out of your long hurts too ... I get it.
Actually, no. In January we had "Kobayashi hour." More recently it has been frantic 15-minute market sells every 12 hours or so. This is clearly not organic market action unless you think that somehow there is a collective panic lasting 5-15 minutes every 12 hours or so. 

When these guys run out of coins or have to cover, then you'll see what the market really wants to do. Of course, they're part of the market too, the part that is getting most expensively rekt.
Compare bitcoins price action to Eth, or BCH over the same period.   Bitcoin looks the most retarded out of all of them.  Basically flip a coin trading.   At least other coins have "normal" price action that accumulates momentum and then has a natural exhaustion.   Bitcoin's price action is buffered.
between 7400-7350 yep.
Yea, I'm pretty bullish medium-long term myself and I think there's a good chance 7k was our bottom for this cycle. Still, this support breaking combined with a red 4hr macd flip could see us back down to $7300ish levels and then who knows what happens there, so watching the market like a hawk right now. 
Thank you! I copied this channel from one guy in this subreddit. But now I see your point. Nothing holds me from shorting on this little bounce.
That's an even more arbitrary channel than the op's one, zero points of contact.
It'll be an attempt to stop the FOMO train getting siphoned down to El Goblino.
Short the top, hold it at 7300-7400 and make people think support is holding so they buy in, let it bounce somewhat, reshort
How about a 62% or so drop since start of year, is that something to worry about? ;) 
> A hundred dollar drop overnight

I know you like math, so:  

Last night's high = 7764  
Last night's average = 7700  
Current price = 7485

Haha I would describe the past couple days as the Bulls slowly and miticulously putting together a house of cards that took a while to put together, only for the bears to come in and knock it all down in the matter of a few hours.

Bears are the ones with nothing to worry about
> l at GDAX and trade on another exchange. Does anyone else on here do it that way?

I do it. I trade BTC USD on GDAX and Alt BTC on Binance. Past 3 months have been good.
No it's not but the decline from 20k to 6k and then a failed attempt to break out and now falling back down.. Is a worry 
Not a problem... Whilst I see people openly banging on that the bear market is over or soon to be over, I'll comment that it ain't even close 
[deleted]
I thought you said you were going to become less heavy handed, in general but also in relation to ETH.

Disclaimer: I didn't see the original comment.
In a way, but it seems like that is the underlying reason why these little rallies seem to be based more on market manipulation and dying cash grabs than genuine influx of new interest, and why they lazily drop back down when the music stops and everyone runs for the nearest chair. 

Everyone who was going to be interested based on the pomp and circumstance of 2017 was already here or left, and it will take a similar pivot to get them back and more to fuel a re-approach to ATH.
Some of us are still buying, but it’s a vast minority considering something in the neighborhood of a trillion dollars left the space. It isn’t “absolute” as you say, but it is impressive.

Use cases that increase value require real world dollars to buy the assets and increase the price. If magic internet money isn’t catching on in first world countries it isn’t going to get off the ground where the streets have no name. 
FYI, this guy is a known LARP.

You're not gonna believe this, but I don't care.
ding ding ding. winner
Well, I've won on my last three trades, all long, so what I'm doing is working for me. If this goes to 7400, I'll double down. When it goes to 7600, I'll add.
Thank you .. You are very kind!!
Thanks!!!
The ones on the way to exchanges flooding the mempool 😜
I think he meant shit is about to go down as in increased volatility in either direction. Not a price drop necesarily.

Just guessing here tho as the comment is very vague in more than one way. 
What coins? lol. 
The ones who barted
No charts. Doesn't matter. This is a market maker move coming. They're going to use TA against traders.

Doom coming, hard. Gonna make a new lower low and break through bottom of triangle. Shorts will open en masse, then they'll get squeezed in a candle that makes April's look like an LGD.

Don't be fooled by the bull div
Shit. That was clearly laid out in original comment.
Ya, but I'll take it to breakeven if necessary
Or craze with alts will reduce to interest in a small number of alts

You say the tech is what's important, well certain alt utility tokens are actually being adopted, more than can be said for BTC 
Honestly, bitcoin right now have no value other than being an investable/tradeable asset. It's not a technology, it's one product of a fairly new technology. It's one product which, because everything for now seems pegged to it, is dragging the growth of an industry with it when it's being manipulated. Blockchain technology can grow without bitcoin.

It’s always amusing when people talk like this. There is a lot to not like about fiat, but we aren’t there yet so don’t count you chickens before they hatch. Your bills are probably all still paid in fiat. 
Yeah, exactly. That money left with the sale but the buyer is either on the hook for the mortgage or left with less valuable products. 
Sure, that’s a nice way of spelling it out. I think we can all agree to that sensible layout.
He's trolling most likely

Nothing is a certainty.

HAHAHAHAHAHAHA

I guess you still aren't aware that there doesn't HAVE to be another bull run at all, let alone one that hits $50k
Ok thanks. Didn't know what Microsoft's intentions were and if btc related. Appreciate your response and thought as much from the downvotes!
Many people who are selling do not think is overvalued. They just think they have too much btc and too little cash.
If you start asking me about huey Lewis and the news I am out of here
It's the verbiage more than the sentiment at play.

EDIT: And if you want to be really pedantic, simply by holding throughout the bear he has funded many a neckbeards retirement.
don't think he was disagreeing, just a funny way to put it
Good luck man. It's tough being a no coiner as well. 
If you bought at 100 and gradually sold up to 5k that is excellent.  You locked in profit.  No one knows where the price goes but taking profits gives you some certainty.  There is a top to bitcoin right?  Or do you think it goes up forever?  I have zero regrets dumping bitcoin at 10k and 20k.  I could have dumped it all at 10k.  Could have dumped everything I had left at 20k but I held some and when it dumped to 17k or so I got out and that turned out to be a good exit. So we got a hell of a way to go for me to buy back higher than I sold.  Taking profits is smart.  Again I’m not saying dump it all, but anyone who dumped some back at the end of last year made out better than holders.  

Bubbles teach taking profits works.  Whoever bought bitcoin off me at 19.5k hopefully dumped it or is content holding a massive bag.  Good luck.  

My advice, you see stupid profits like 3x or more.  Liquidate some of your position.  Liquidate 1/2 and you made Money, have upside left and reduce your capital input risk to zero.  No one plays this shit perfectly.  The big winners play smart, are rich to begin with or get in super early.  I don’t think we are early any longer, but the jury is out for now.
[deleted]
That's what I'm saying, you won't really see the ones that don't bounce because they disappear or confirm at a lower price.
I'd probably close on a break of 7650 personally, but there's an argument to be made for closing here and reshorting sub 7450 or the top of the channel again. I like comfortable entries, and I'd be very happy with >7700. I had >7700 at 1x short, but I wanted to go naked short, so I added down.
!short XBTM18 update 7605 5x 55%

Awesome, thanks. 
and how many people use BitFlyer USA?
It is cool for the Japanese Central Bank and also for anyone who makes more money if cryptocurrency adoption slows.
Yes they can raise it to 70% if necessary.
they won't, that's what the japanese economy never went back up, and no longer dominate lots of space, no one wants to innovate anymore
Wrong.

"Unlike winnings on stocks and foreign currencies, which are taxed around 20 percent, Japan’s levy on profits from virtual money runs from 15 percent to 55 percent. "
Might makes right.  The USA is just as bad, or worse, in many ways...so is the EU.
You sure know how to get your ball in the hole, dont ya?
Depends if you're talking about total time or volatility time. On the way up was 1%-3% moves in 5m candles (seems like a single actor), then 12 hours of mostly sideways. 

This downward movement has been more gradual but consistent drops, which feels more like organic (as much as I hate the meme) selling rather than a single actor.

But you both have valid points. 
Ah you closed way higher, I had assumed that you closed after this breakdown. In that case, well played!
Same, we hardly bounced off it at all and are already back chewing at it. Just fell through as I was typing this. Buyers are definitely still around though.
Yup nevermind, I stand corrected
That 9 year trendline had four bear market retraces to -80% or more.  Or in other words, thanks for putting in your dollars during the slide so i can end up with more bitcoins than you.
That's impressive.

Starting to see the potential of scripting on tradingview.  I could really see getting into this and sinking in a lot of time.


Nice! Thanks for showing the source!  It's much more readable than I expected.
Of those 6 that came after reverse from the market bottom, 4 were in clear trading ranges above that bottom. Ie uptrending conditions.
It's also the 50 week MA this week. The weekly close yesterday closed only a few dollars below the MA and I don't think it ever cracked it on lower time frames.
Is there something inaccurate about what I said?

If the market is bearish then we should see it breaking to new lows.
> Like Crypto Chad said

source?
> Maybe 2014,

Your own personal definition of "bear market" is a bore.  The conventional definitions work for most of the rest of us. 2014 more than qualified and so does 2018 so far.
"it's never been a bear market" hmmmmmmm right I think most here will take conventional and accepted definitions of a bear market 

The amount of nonsense you come out with is crazy, I mean only 36 hours ago you said we were going to smash through $10k imminently...
2014 was a bear market and the past six months have been a bear market with no reversal so far...
Fair points, although I have some thoughts.

Sideline money: that's been the third most used buzzword to back up why BTC can't go "that low" outside of "etf" and "the halving". It was said in the 2013 and 2014 post bubble bear markets about 2/3 of the way down, then we went another 1/3. 

Sure it may seem silly to think the percentage arguement is crazy because it is true that there are multitudes of people that know about BTC now. The problem comes down to the actual buying of BTC, most of those people won't be buying until we are back to/close to ATHs or it climbing rapidly like in December. This is because most people are only into it to get a quick buck, they don't give a shit about BTC outside of that.

As for the bear market, we could still see a slow bleed like in 2014, it took almost 18 months to turn it around. This go around is only on month 6 and no REAL buying volume has shown up yet, just like in 2014.

I am a full blown long term bull on BTC, I've been that way since the first time I got BTC back before the '13 bubble. The only reason I'm not holding/buying is because I've been through 2 full blown bubbles before, I want to buy more BTC at the bottom to increase my stack. Plain and simple. 

Don't fight the trend, it'll beat you every time.
Huge demand spike maybe but not from the average Joe. Remember last xmas? Everyone crazeh because it was *going up*. The price does not matter. It's the direction. FOMO. If it would drop to 3k soon, the average Joe won't even think about buying. 
Also, comparing bubbles is a sure way to miss the action. I'd stick to the current one :) 
400k through MtGox or btc-e? 
Nice, I'm assuming we're in extended downtrend so trading "cold storage" goinshort whenever possible. 
Yup. I didn't want to add over 2.5x underwater so I just watched that bounce from 7.8, nice to be right and in green now :)
I've done that too, its not much fun isn't it?! lol.
That is what we do here.
Because these kind of patterns stop working if many people anticipate them. It's probably going to dump massively though, especially if people really start thinking that it should pump. That's not what the pattern is about, it's about turning points and shifts in the market. That doesn't imply the trend should reverse. There's a whole lot more to be found if you look deeper. 
thanks.

I love how everyone in this sub and /r/bitcoin rejoiced about Bitcoin futures coming, but the price has fallen off a cliff since their inception.
doot
You are asserting that the price of btc on Friday close is always the same as on Monday morning? 

Or what are you saying here? This sounds silly 
Thanks!
No worries! Thanks for your analysis, and the phenomenon is indeed very interesting :)
I agreed and continue to agree. 7,5 is the price of bitcoin for at least the next month an a half. 6,6 and 8k are the outer extremes we're going to see.
[deleted]
You are correct, thank you. I should've said "forming" and not jump the gun. This could keep going down right now.
Ah cool, thanks for the tip about the mouse hover.
Lol. I stand corrected!
Consider simple ma (3) with data points 10, 100, 1000 . The output is 1110/3=370 the related price of interest is 100. (log base 10 so (1+2+3)/3)
the scale doesn't matter, the reason why you choose a log scale over linear is what matters. That same logic suggests that your MA won't be representative of what you expect it to be.
Bad bot

Stop posting here!
You don't say...
I think its sound, longing the breakout or shorting the support break seems safer then expecting the bounce not to keep on going.
Just a r/r thing i believe...
Edit: the closing of the trade, thats where the magic happens :D
Because the bounce was at support. You short a weak bounce *after* support breaks. So support breaks, a weak bounce happens, then you short.
Most people making predictions give reasons behind it, not just state it. You got anything?
After frequenting this sub lately I'm considering going all in on dildo manufacturing. Seems they're in very high demand at the moment.
For now I see that both stairs and elevator is down.
Thanks for condolences, but I am not worrying about "karma" ;)
Thanks, I appreciate that a lot! Hopefully we see an explosive move soon, and not just a 1h candle but something that can be sustained for at least a few hours/days
A lot of people use 20, 60, 120, 30 because it smooths out some of Bitcoin's notorious volatility and accounts for the 24/7 market (compared with traditional trading). 

20 is the number of previous candles factored into the Tenken and Kijun.

60 is the number of candles factored into the cloud lines, span A and span B. 

120 is something to do with the chikou span.

30 is the displacement of the chikou span, 30 candles behind, and of the cloud, 30 candles ahead. 

From what I understand, this works much better for Bitcoin than the comparatively low standard settings.
> cryptowat

How can I use this with tradingview? Can you link it?
Be careful what you wish for. A *full reset to pre-hype prices* would mean three figures, maybe low 1ks at best. 
That's exactly my point, aka "how can I make volume fit my narrative"
This is legitimately only because there is no BCHUSD or ETHUSD pairing on MEX. If there were, these movements would be there too.

It happens with both upwards and downwards movement. I don't think it's "bear manipulation" or "price suppression." That's silly.
it's primarily because people don't care to wait for limit orders to get filled before pumping  alts. Want to trade alts? OK. Market buy 1000 btc. 
[deleted]
I’m guessing El Goblino is a town south of the symm triangle border?
Not at all. I've seen worse.
Oh and don't forget how long it took to get to 7764 again with that crazy "bull momentum" we saw  compared to this "weak bear" push to 7485
Yeah, I like the free limit orders at GDAX and the way it's easy to get fiat there from my bank. Also quick and cheap to move coins off now that they have Segwit. But no margin trading which I don't do much anyway. 
The fact that people are still expecting some impending run-up out of nowhere really solidifies my belief we're nowhere near the bottom.
Your comments are necessary to balance out the bulls
Sounds like the type of comment i'd have been interested in.  If you have the time could you PM it to me please?
I removed the comment and gave feedback. Is that too heavy handed?
The cycles are always the same and have always been since the stock market exists : traders start a bull run. Once the general public comes in you know the end is near. They are buying because "everyone is buying" it's herd mentality. There's no manipulation here.
How did you calculate that a trillion dollars left the space? 

Waaay less imo, but would be interested what makes you think this. Thanks!
Actually it is. When was the last time you paid via phone app? Hint: in Africa the phone already is a wallet, except national.

Those people need access to money services, and banks do not cut it.

And use cases will come.
Losing And Really Pissed?
Whatever, dude.
your entire shtick is based on rainbow meme lines!! 


Nice job!  Just saying that you could have added to your position without waiting and it'd effectively had been the same, since you plan to add no matter what.

I see that you added to your current position, woulda been better if you added when you made that post 4 hours ago ;)
....not sure if serious....
Didn't see your edit, thought you're underwater. Not so risky now, but you may lose those profits.
only the top alts will remain, like ethereum, and bcore legacy.

Which alts? There is likely to only be one major PoW coin and that's likely going to be Bitcoin. Utility coins can't be rent seeking for long because their utility should match their market value. It makes no sense to have premium above the network value of a coin like ETH. 

Which alts will stick around, besides some modest interest in a few secondary projects like Litecoin and Monero?
if you like to invest and trade in assets that go down 60% on the year great.  Bitcoin is worthless until it's valued as a currency.  Meaning no USD ticker.











Ok enjoy your time in a dark, cold prison cell.  

Or if not you, then many other people who are currently rotting away in a cell, along with those in the future.
Last hour closed red, you need to wait for a local low to form before calling for a divergence.

That said, looks like it's confirming now. Small one though.
[deleted]
We haven't even hit the percent equivalent of the fall of the 2014 bubble. Once we get close, perhaps positive coming after that
I wouldn't be surprised, actually, if it were to happen in this daily candle. BTC is known for its fakeouts and shakeouts. If this thing is bought back up to 7700 in the next hour or two then 7800 can easily happen in this daily. (They are *ifs* though)
I've played video poker exactly nine minutes in my entire life, got a royal flush and walked away with $14 from my 25c stake. 
If he's right again today, screw TA, all hail the sage of Bitcoin.
Indeed.... thanks.
They usually work better on longer time frames, even in crypto. And even then they are not that reliable.
That's where he wants to buy. Literally that's it 
He doesn't have one. 
If we hit 7125 on 6/7, we'd be back where the 5/29 pump started and we'd also be touching the bottom of the big triangle. It's probably too perfect to happen, but it would be a beautiful place to start an uptrend.
[https://imgur.com/a/jfXtNls](https://imgur.com/a/jfXtNls)

This looks to be playing out so far. If its true we'll find the bottom some time in the next 24 hrs and sideways/up from there. Of course there's still a big chance it doesn't play out.
Sure, its possible. Heres my bet: 

Looking at the volume and price, the selling was mostly done during the moments peak was reached and all the way we headed there. To actually unload massive amounts, you need high volume \(all the buying we saw during the mania\). Once the real mania hits, you start unloading those massive holdings since you can easily do it on the way up. Now, since late January, we have been hovering between 6k\-10k. There have been many  high volume days/weeks especially earlier this year. That is,  after the ATH, when people started panic selling. When the selling started, thats when you'd start buying back more and more. Now the volume has dried up.  It doesnt really matter if you buy at 7k, 8k, 9k if the future predictions hold any truth to them and the next push could take us to much above 20k. Remember, this simpleton theory only considers basic volume/price analysis and doesnt take anything else into consideration. And many many other things should be taken into consideration. In my opinion, the drop from ATH wasnt because some whales unloaded. The unloading was done before, on the way up to ATH. We dropped off because the buying pressure disappeared and panic set in, people snapped out of it. I would guess this is just accumulation phase. But perhaps if we drop below the magical 6.8k number or whatever, my theory would be invalidated. Im just shooting shit, I dont know a thing.
hate to say it but trading probably isnt for you then... and thats ok.

Your post history is jam packed with bullish sentiment 
I'm messing around.  You ninja edited your comment. The 2nd part wasn't there when I read it.

EDIT: I was just trying to work out what you meant.
For now. Wait until Deutsche Bank collapses. We are approaching a time when fiat will be considered dirty and undesirable. 
It's because he asked nicely. 
Once you have your crypto epiphany you will see clearly that hyperbitcoinization is a certainty. When you understand that FIAT will continue to inflate at increasing levels while BTC supply slows to a trickle you will understand that $50k is a certainty, and beyond that, as the morpheus meme goes, fiat/btc pairs will no longer mean shit except for trading
Well, I believe the top is somewhere between $10M-1000M eventually, unless something else takes over BTC. That's why I don't pay too much attention timing it. Plus I am unable to time the medium term tops anyway, so I won't bother.

How is sub 10k not a nice entry at any price, when it could very well get to 19k again this year. It’s already been there once.  That’s at least 2x your money.  Not bad by stock market standards.     
Yes, so id be looking for strength at the support i posted before entering long.  

Edit: And would be unsure about entering long any lower than this. As i don't see us getting back above the posted support if we go below it. Also, we're at the bottom of our bull channel. So longing that is likely to result in what you're talking about.
I like comfortable entries too, only way i can get good sleep whilst in position. But like the idea of reshorting 7450! Will see how the 4 hour closes llike u/danceswithpizzaz said

Not sure, but I've been using them since January because they've been offering essentially 0% fees since they opened.

https://bitflyer.com/en-us/commission
The US is only 20-25% max depending on a few circumstances. Which I also consider too high, but I am grudgingly fine with it, it is at least somewhat more reasonable. 
I’ve won some tournaments in my day :) 
Yeah, I closed it before the drop, but I could have waited a bit longer for a better exit. 
Which is what we're flirting with now. We need to find lower lows to make a different case.
Do a quick search. It was a recent post.
Time will only tell who is right here but I will quote one thing:

I want to buy more BTC at the bottom to increase my stack. Plain and simple

You represent sideline money also... If you can time the exact bottom... lucky you.

Buying the bottom will be just as hard as selling the top. This I know is a fact.  BTC was 17k Dec 17th and on Jan 17th. People had a month's range to sell the top and it has been gone for 6 months.... It can be staring you in the face and you have zero idea...

Similar to when EVERYONE though the BCH fork would ruin the price of BTC the moment it happened. Price hasn't turned back since the perceived ultra bearish event.

Anyhow hope you and I both see 3k Bitcoin again I would love to buy more then too..... But sideline money is a meme, so we are a meme huh?...
Well that's my point though... percentage based comparisons of bubbles is exactly what the OP did.

Also to your point, just as you know average Joe won't be buying at the peaks. Why would you think he hasn't sold already then? Why would "average" Joe be ok with \-70&#37; but not \-80&#37;?

By your logic the average Joe is long gone. Maybe on the first dip below 6k \(likely before\). So why do you think those with coins left will be magically driven to sell sub 5k?

Sometimes the answer is exactly where you are thinking. I am currently buying in this range... Will be AGGRESSIVELY buying any dips. Including and anything below 5k, 4k, 3k, 2k, 1k....

Most people are secretly waiting for this \(OR are buying NOW as they think this is a reasonable deal\).

Those selling likely were just taking profits from the previous 6.5k \-\> 10k spike OR are dumb traders with high liq prices.

My take tbh... bears have been proven to be wrong each and every bear market \+ BTC/Crypto is more relevant than ever. Why would it ever be allowed to go to 3k? Barring a catastrophic event of course.

It is kinda like hoping for FB stock to dip to IPO prices again. Or gold to dip to ATL's again, fundamentally that ship has sailed.

MAYBE MAYBE 3k hasn't sailed but if it gets there it won't be there for long.
I have no cold storage currently. Long story short I liquidated all of my crypto in early March (fortuitously 3% off the peak) and held back just a bit for trading to try to rebuild cold storage. I've now hit my first goal towards rebuilding that, but I was waiting for the reversal to grow some teeth (>8000) before committing it. If we're headed back down, then I'd rather put that BTC to work shorting. We'll see how this goes. 7500 is proving to be pretty stubborn yet again. 
Logical points.  But on the other hand, I believe that such anticipation is probably why it wasn't able to break 7k the other week.  Without the macro-triangle, I think it would have gone right through.
Fine, I'll try to be a good boy

I'm happy to discuss this with you. I want to make sure that that you know, before we start, that you can say whatever you want, within the rules. Don't worry about breaking rule 2. Let's just try to stay true to the intent of rule 1. 

Questioning mod actions is always fair game. Thank you for taking time to think about this and engaging me on the issue.

There's nuance in the application of these rules. Strict application of rules seems to cause a lot of frustration. Strict application of rule 2 causes a huge amount of frustration since about a year ago. So, I've had to back off from the line that I would have drawn in 2015 or 2016. 

The goal is to create a place where everyone feels comfortable contributing their thoughts in whatever way is most comfortable. Chad is sometimes trollish in the way he communicates... which is where nunace comes in.

Mods also miss a lot. Sometimes we moderate without taking a whole thread into consideration. It can be hard to see patterns of behavior that are obvious to other people, too. So, we tend toward giving people the benefit of the doubt until there's irrefutable evidence that something needs to be done.

> Because not everyone is a butthurt dipshit without self-awareness like you.

That's clearly a rule 1 violation. I'm issuing a warning now, but because nobody is reporting Chad's post's it's his first recorded warning.

So yes, moderation is imperfect. Yes we miss things. Yes we need you to point things out. We need you to criticize our thoughts and actions. However, we don't want the thread filled up with accusations of rule violations. We want to see reports and use those reports to get better at our job. We want to have the opportunity to do better at applying the rules in a nuanced and fair way.
Yeah I have used that. Is that showing the amount of btc being shorted/longed though? I was under the impression it was just the amount of longs/shorts open and nothing about the size of them. Could be wrong though. 
No it doesn't always fill immediately on open like it essentially did today. 

Using this weekends gap as an example, the price needed to retrace to 7471 (where the gap started). *When* the gap fills will vary. Most of the time it fills within 1 week (Before the next gap starts) but once or twice it has taken over 1 week for the gap to fill. 

What is important is that every price gap in the CME charts has filled since the bitcoin futures were implemented. I have no Idea WHY this happens, as the volume other other exchanges should easily trump anything the CME want to do.


[deleted]
No idea how you came up with that. 
Then alts will start to pump for no reason
Not charting on binance, but essentially same type of thing. If we turn around and make a higher low there WILL be hidden divergence on those time frames. But we need to really turn around first.
I'm confused. All the log does is change the scale on the Y-axis, it doesn't change the numbers. Why is this problematic? Longer time frames work better with log scale.
youre overthinking it dude, its just another number
Sort of, shorting support and longing breakout in this market is a great way to short the bottom and long the top lol
if support breaks you likely won't even get a chance to short higher before the move down. He should've shorted the weak bounce. 

do you see what I mean? 
He’s just seagulling this entire thread with shit like that. Ignore.
👌
You must have missed the part where we haven't made a new low since 5th February
I guess my username is relevant 
yeah this price movement has been exhausting to watch to say the least!
It does paint a different view. Will have to compare both to see which fits better. Thanks for the tip
Oh boy... this is very wrong.

20 - tenkan periods

60 - kijun periods

120 = Senkou Span B periods

30 = negative offset for Chikou span and forward offset for SSA and SSB.
Dont use tradingview so i can't help. 
"its higher than it was 5 years ago.  very bullish imo'
Do you think it's bitmex that is "clamping down" on the market?
I listened to your advice and did not short. I see now that your falling edge might play out. Do you think that after such a dipping day we might bounce back to 7,600?
Precisely! It can get nasty down there, the place is run by a group known as 'The Bartel'.
Please stay off margin unless you do this full-time (and even then).
I have reasons for expecting a run up which I have discussed earlier. 

Why would you expect a big selloff? Do you expect mass panic or some whale selling for fun?
What bulls? lol
[deleted]
Giant market orders in semi regular intervals with low volume drivel in between is the work of market makers, not normal market activity. This is an unregulated space, don’t fool yourself, it’s happening. 
Didn’t total market valuation estimates drop from over a trillion to 300 billion or so?
Those people need accesses to all kinds of things, but those people aren’t dumping enough speculative dollars into the crypto space to move the needle, let alone break ATH. 

I’m talking about right now, and within the year, I’m bullish long term but it is my impression that tokenized securities will take over crypto and a market shakeup will take us to a mature space where dentacoin isn’t on the map. 

Somewhere way down the line those use cases will probably come to fruition, but that will be a secondary/tertiary phase not something that will happen during a growth market phase. 

Those same people will need to tokenize assets like property, in addition to currency and banking functions. They will also be able to generate capital through new STO models, which will be exciting. 

Decentralized POW coins will underpin the new token based securities and property markets, replacing current middleman functions of BTCC, but the stuff you see now will become niche or vanish. Proof of stake and centralized projects are no different than a trusted 3rd party like Cede & Co., more of the old ways.
Read my comment history, son. I won on my last three trades, and I'll win on this one. Show me one other poster who has three winning trades in a row.
You misunderstand me or maybe I didn't express myself good enough. I originally invested in bitcoin to see growth, both in price and hoping that it could lead all other blockchain projects into progress and invest in them too. But at the point we are now, it's clear that it's nothing but a shortable asset by a bunch of people who's ruining it for everyone and I'm sometimes thinking maybe other things shouldn't be pegged to it the way they are now, so at least others can progress. I reiterate, bitcoin is not the technology after all, it's the symbolic flagship product of a fairly emerging technology, but just a product after all..    
   
I can easily go invest in other things too. I wanted to invest in this new tech but it looks like it ain't going nowhere because of these people.
Good point, thanks \- still learning :\)
I would buy the shit out of Bitcoin if it hit zero LOL
There is no reason to think that bitcoin price should mimic 2014. Not only past prices factually do not carry any information about the future prices but fundamentals are very different. 2014 crash is caused by mtgox, nothing is happening right now.

I did, sorry I am mobile and thought of more I wanted to add. I figured as much but you never know. I’m an investor and enthusiast in this space too!
The thing that gets me is that fiat has collapsed many times and yet here we are again. I don’t see it going away but something will come of it!
You truly are delusional

You think BTC will come and replace fiat in the event of worldwide economic collapse 

Think again 
Delusional.  That thinking got it to 20k though.  We will see.  Your lower estimate puts all the bitcoin, assuming 4 million lost, at 170 trillion dollars.  That’s a bit less than the value of all the property in the world currently.  It won’t happen unless USD completely collapses.
[deleted]
Indeed, but I think you handled it well in any case in terms of foresight, have to take away the hindsight you now have when considering the choice you made at that time. 

Perhaps the only regret you could have is that maybe next time close half where you did in at -20, and try to close the other half at +20 (which of course would actually introduce a higher risk to end up closing the rest at a greater loss)
We are not in a clear trading range above the bottom. Higher lows and lower highs is not enough to define an uptrend. We need resistance to turn into support and a new range to form above the previous. Like what happened here: https://imgur.com/a/9xkd4Kz
was a rhetorical question.
We're similar, I got out of all positions BTC and alts March 8-9 and scalped small shorts diffidently. When this DCB hit in early April was when I began going for longer swing trades. The characteristics of the April 11-25 rise gave me more and more confidence as it developed that it was a manufactured pump similar to this push to 8k. Why manufacture a pump if we're not going down more?

I'm watching 7100 but don't plan to close shorts unless it bounces back to 7500. Looking for 6800-6200 on this dip. Staying in the huge triangle is too predictable and on this large a scale predictable moves lose their predictability. Look at how we bounced $300 north of the bottom of the triangle last week, similar logic. We need a sow to get the macro movement progressing. 
Thanks for your efforts towards growth and improvement in your moderation, it's appreciated and so is your explanation. I'm on team nuance always.
Thanks a lot for clearing that. I understand that you can't scan every comment and can easily miss something. Thanks for your hard work :)
if that is the data from bitfinex, it's the number of btc long/short, not positions opened

That's unlikely, IMO.
% change is what's important between two price points. In low time-frames it is low but in high you find due to the large % change log is more appropriate. The move from 100 to 1000 is no more meaningful than 10 to 100, but the simple MA would suggest it was

Below is a lot of math, upon re-reading I think it probably wasn't necessary to write so feel free to ignore it.

If price doubles every day (100% increase) then you get a nice relationship of todays price = sum of all previous days prices +initial price

or today = yesterday+ (all but yesterday+initial price)

sma output would be in the form ([2*yesterday-relatively negligible amount]/sma period)

since price change was constant what you would want from your MA is the data point at: MAperiod/2 days back.


May I give my honest 2c?

They all work. For a very simple reason -- we did a survey to see what settings traders use and it was fairly evenly dispersed. That means you have a group of traders who will use traditional settings (9/26/52/26) to inform their trades while another group will use crypto-adjusted settings (10/30/60/30) and the other group that will use the crypto-adjusted doubled settings.  You will find significant S/R levels using each of these settings, so it really just comes down to personal preference. Personally... I want it all.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/efUPUWyy/

You're right. Why does the third number say lagging span **2** periods in the settings?

Also, are these the settings you use?
Clamping down? Not sure I follow. 

I do firmly believe that folks with 4-figure bitcoin accounts are accumulating leveraged positions on MEX in the direction of least resistance / coinciding with TA, dumping market orders on fiat exchanges, then closing their leverage positions. Since BTC is the only non-ratio option for MEX, it's the easiest place to do this. 
I expect further sell off because we are in a bear market and I don't believe we have found bottom, plus there are few if any bullish signs around. That's why 
Thanks
Total market cap top was at about 0.8 trillion and market cap does not represent the amount of money in the space. Some estimates that I've seen suggest that the crypto market increased about $50 for every dollar entering the ecosystem.
Ah, I see.

The Market valuation (market cap.) actually has no bearing on how much money entered or left.

I.e someone could market buy $100 million, and that would probably push the market cap up by billions.

Likewise if for some fundamental reason we all agreed Bitcoin was worth zero then the market cap would drop hugely on very little volume.

Edit: would be interesting to know how much left though. It’s technically possible for the price to go down even if money didn’t leave (sellers market selling, buyers limit ordering)
So in your opinion, it was solely MtGox?
you sound like you bought way too high. sorry for your loss.
I think it’s time for you to crawl back under the rock you came out of. Sell your BTC and be gone instead of trying to spread whatever is wrong with you. See you at 20K+. 
>It's time for you kids to grow up and get jobs

Pretty sure i'm probably older than you, trust me I wish I wasn't. 
LARP = live action role play.

Are you role playing a capitulating bull? or are you really giving up on btc? 
Fiat has never collapsed. 
I don’t think btc will even behave like gold in the event of a market correction right now. 
Yes, this is with dollar collapse and new gold standard formed on top of bitcoin. Without it, top would be probably around 1 million (taking share of gold's market cap in absence of gold standard).

Also, humanity is possibly at a pivotal point where productivity explodes with AI. This must be taken in consideration in estimating total wealth in the world in the next 50 years or so.
The way to deal with goblintown (if it happens) is to start saving a bitcoin emergency fund now (separate from real life emergency fund).  Then once in goblin town, use your bitcoin emergency fund to buy.    You will feel like a BOSS.

It doesn’t matter what happens to the price in short term.  Bitcoin tech is a breakthrough and cannot be stopped. It can only be slowed down by government overreach.   With decentralized exchanges coming down the road, the government won’t be able to do much.   

Don’t be sorry. I am frustrated a lot with the price too because I am impatient af.  Just trying to save you from making a big mistake.   I have been agonizing about missing the bitcoin boat the last couple of years, so I’m hodling long term 4-5 years.    Maybe by then it can become a viable currency and I won’t even need to sell. 
2 things: DCA and hedging
How about just following the simplest of TA to find your entries and exits? It's literally the easiest thing in the world. Bitcoin's coiling in a continuation triangle that's due to more likely than not break downwards in July. Why not sit on your hands and on cash until then and either long or short it once it happens?
Also, we haven't seen a lower low in 17 weeks. The bear market is 25 weeks long and we haven't found a lower low for almost 70% of it's duration. If bears are strong, they should be able to drive the price down. Instead, they're making the market look like a period of consolidation.

in 2014 we found lower lows over a 58 week period. Most weeks, for the first 25 weeks, posted a lower low.
The point of this chart is to search for stability... or stability where RSI is low. It doesn't say anything about the trend. It happens that six out of seven are followed by a significant up trend. when you consider that RSI is low, two out of two are followed by an up trend. It's consistent with the theory that price stability is followed by bullish markets.
Right. That makes it a lot more useful. And yeah its the data from finex
I really like these charts. No matter which bubble you project it seems we'll have very low volatility for the next few weeks. Thank you!
I still don't understand. People use simple moving averages for a reason. The average shows you the relative support resistance level across that period, regardless of whether you're in log or linear. The shape of the line on either scale is not what's important, the values themselves are what's important. 

MA are not about the percent change, they're about the average values across their period. These values don't change depending on whether you're log or linear, only the scale changes.
Lagging span 2 is equivalent to Senkou Span B. Also, if you were interested, Senkou Span A, the kumo line that oscillates around Senkou Span B is calculated by averaging the tenkan and kijun and displacing it by 26 or 30 periods.
Sure, therevs little reason to buy right now. There's also little reason to sell. It's been 6 months since the top, and weak hands have been flushed. What's left are traders, and holders. Holders won't move the price, but traders (both whales and, to a smaller extent, small fish) will.

So, to predict price movements, you look at what these people want. Small fish are irrelevant to the macro picture. They'll try to catch bottoms, maybe control ute to some low volume rises and falls, but ultimately are at the mercy of whales.

So, what would you do if you were a whale? You have a lot of BTC, and you want more money. The easiest thing to do is open a long or short position on bitmex, and then market buy/sell large amounts on finex.

You can also market buy a lot to drive the price up, let the small fish keep it up, and slowly sell off what you bought for profit. When you're close to finished, you market sell it back down and do the same (Bart patterns).

Point here is that we are NOT tending. When volume is low, and there is no trend, whales have to get creative to grow their stacks, and they have a much larger impact on the market.
BTC wasn't mentioned once in his two sentence comment.
I could be wrong, like I said, I am basing on recollection of hearing we were in the neighborhood of a trillion by estimates around the time of ATH. It doesn’t matter though, all that matters is that it was a lot and now it is a lot less. 
It’s the best we have, and it is way down. Furthermore, volume has trended clearly down since ATH even with the DCBs interjected. No sense in arguing specifics no one knows, it’s a general point that a lot of money is gone, and a lot of the money now is tied up in worthless centralized projects and existing volume is bloated with exchange wash trading. 
400000 coins stolen and dumped onto a young immature market.

Power is still flowing to the fewer and fewer as far as I know.  People probably thought like you about the year 2000.  Here we are 18 years later.   I think 1M is delusional too but who knows.  Hit me up in 10 years.
True, we haven't seen absolute lower lows *or higher highs* and this does look like consolidation (in a continuation pattern), but we are spending more time towards the bottom of the range seeing lower candle closes on higher timeframes. The current consolidation range is not cut off from the lows like it is in most of these other low vol periods you found. The macro market structure has not changed with resistance turning to support like it had is most of the low vol periods.

In 2014 there was 16 weeks between the first low and the first lower low: https://imgur.com/a/aZUhneB
Underrated comment right here.
Why do you think the trend that follows the period of low vol is important but not the trend that preceded it?
> The average shows you the relative support resistance level across that period, regardless of whether you're in log or linear.

does it? what makes the average price meaningful?

Ok that makes sense.

Yeah, I get that part. 

Do you use 26 or 30 for the offset?
Sorry but that's wrong. We are trending. We are trending down.

Until the weekly trends up then it won't be over. The trend is still down and will remain so until a fundamental shift in sentiment. Until that day arrives we will continue to get these little pumps of price, followed by the consolidation followed by the decent dump in price.

It's likely that we'll just grind our way down as we have done now for months. Until we reach the bottom of this current market cycle. Then the bull run will start again. 
Fundamental misunderstanding what market cap means. It is Elements available (i.e. shares existing, bitcoin existing) * value of last trade.

If bitcoin tomorrow trades at 1 USD then market cap is suddenly 18 million or so. But only 1 USD and 1 BTC (not even that) may have traded.
Sure, there was a sell-off but 10 billion leaving the crypto markets is a lot less than a trillion.
The value of our coins is lower.

However the amount of USD taken out into fiat is exactly the same as the amount of USD that’s been put back into the market.
Lmao! Just because you FOMOd in and bought the peak like an idiot after an insane ridiculous runup does not mean bitcoin is a scam. 
We always stay close to the bottom of the new range after a bubble. If we stayed close to the top it wouldn't be a bubble.
See my comment about rsi

Yes.

Lol, look up "moving averages trading". MA's are one of the most standard and useful TA tools.

I use 30, sir.
We haven't made a higher high since December. We haven't made a lower low since February. Every time we break under 8k people scream of doom... 2k this and 4k that... But then we just grind back up. Until I see consistent lower lows, this is not a trend.
Yeah, if btc suddenly sells for $1 then there is no value left in btc and that money is sunk. If you paid $10,000 for a btc and now you can only sell it for a dollar do you think the same amount of dollars are still in the space? The $9,999 was spent somewhere else outside the space.  

Just like the price of a BTC is now almost a third compared to what it was, that is a reflection of a compound of factors like interest in the product, dollars willing to be spent on the product, and so forth. Try to rationalize all you want it is worth a lot less now. Don’t believe me? Try to sell your BTC for $19k.
I am genuinely curious about your source for dollars in the crypto space over time. 
What? You think the same amount of dollars are in crypto now as they were at ATH when grandma was buying BTC but somehow market valuation is down $500,000,000,000?

Think about that. 
[deleted]
That's simply not true. The new range is 6-12k, it would still be a bubble if we were grinding at 10.5k right now. Most of the low vol periods you have are in trading ranges that do not include the bottom.
OK let me rephrase.

What does "the relative support resistance level across that period" mean, and why is it related to average price?
Very gentlemen.
Let's just wait and see. It's going to take a while but it is highly unlikely we'll be seeing over 9k for a while now.

More than likely we'll break back into the 6s. Should that happen then the low of 6k has a very good chance of falling.

Then you'll get your lower low 
Yeah, but the money did not LEAVE. If the next trade is for 1000, then the market cap multiplied by 1000 with just very little money coming in.
It has to be the same.

Every Bitcoin converted to USD is matched by someone else converting the same amount of USD to Bitcoin. 

In fact, due to new mined coins there is always new USD coming in.

The price going down is due to sellers being more willing to sell lower than buyers are to buy higher.

I’m not being a dick. Just a change in market cap is due to the price people are willing to buy / sell for and nothing else.

However, I agree the value of all Bitcoins has gone down based on the current price if that’s what you mean. 


Ooooh. Okay. I get it. You're just trolling now. 

You weren't scammed. 
We hit 20k. The bottom is 6k.
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/movingaverage.asp
But there is no CONVERSION. No USD stops to exist to put 1 bitcoin in existence.
What?!? It absolutely is not the same. The value of a btc has changed drastically and new coin dilution of the existing pool of mined coins is a minimal factor. 

I cannot wrap my head around the idea that you honestly think the USD in the space is the same somehow because a given bitcoin is bought and sold in dollars. This is fundamental level economics here, discussion over. 
Cool. Doesn't even mention support&resistance. What I'm taking from this is you don't know.
I didn’t say it stopped existing.

I’m saying the USD value of all Bitcoin sold is the same as the USD value of all Bitcoin bought.

This all started because I pointed out that the Market Cap dropping $X doesn’t mean that’s how much was sold.
When you say “the USD in the space”...there is no money IN crypto, the money is in the pockets of the people who sold you that crypto (or sold most recently).

I’m honestly trying to help, as your initial statement that $1 trillion “left the market” makes no sense and saying “money left the market” also makes no sense as every seller has a buyer.

Edit: Here’s a reasonable article: http://jamescrypto.com/the-difference-between-inflow-and-market-cap-and-how-it-relates-to-tethers/
Like I already said, MA's provide you with information on the trend across the chosen period. Like any other trend data, it's useful for seeing where the price is relative to that moving trend. 

>What I'm taking from this is you don't know.

Actually it sounds like *you* don't know. MA's are probably the first thing people learn after learning how the candles work. Tracking a mix of fast, medium and slow MA's is very useful for seeing changes in trend.

Sorry that all of this is over your head. Wish I could help!
Yes. I understand this. The value of the market has gone down about 500 billion dollars. Mince words, label it however you want, it’s just a general point that this stuff we are speculating on is worth less now.
I stated how sma calculated long ago. I said % change was important.   As an sma does not account for this, the draw is warped from if the same price action occurred over a smaller % change in price.

So I showed the obvious warping on b bands. 

Simply telling me that people find value in sma doesn't make what I'm asserting wrong.
Its not mincing words though, it's a very important distinction :)

I agree 100% that what we are speculating on is currently worth less at the moment, but that really just means sellers have been keener than buyers not necessarily that USD has been "fleeing".

I'll leave you alone now lol, no hard feelings :) 
>Simply telling me that people find value in sma doesn't make what I'm asserting wrong.

What exactly *are* you asserting?

You asked why MA's were relevant and I told you. You can say they don't tell you anything, but I disagree, as would almost any trader. There's plenty of info and backtesting you can do with various MA combos. MA's are literally the first thing people should learn how to use when charting, because they're straightforward and very useful.
I think we are on the same page, but I have to say the use of the verb fleeing wasn’t altogether inappropriate when we are down like 62% from ATH. I certainly felt like I was fleeing to USD when I sold as ATH started crumbling.

But, point taken good discussion. 😎
this back and forth is getting us nowhere. so i think we should wrap it up. I'm saying sma does not self correct for exponential price change.

If price spent half the period in a lower grid square, and half the period in a higher I would want the average to be on the grid line connecting the two. Not the lower region of the high square.

 I'm saying sma does not self correct for exponential price change.

But why would it? Why should it?

>If price spent half the period in a lower grid square, and half the period in a higher I would want the average to be on the grid line connecting the two. Not the lower region of the high square.

Why? I would want to see how the price was trending over that period. I don't see why percent change is more elucidating than the SMA on log scale. The MA compares with candles (visually) and is based on their close price (usually). The line is useful because you can see the deviation from the mean very easily and you can also compare crossovers. I don't see why implementing some sort of percent change line would be more useful. Is there an indicator that does this?
the 2 price ranges are of equal significance, and an equal amount of trading was done in both . I'm trying to setup a very simple situation with this thought.

It's not that your using a log scale, it's why you thought it was better to choose a log scale. 

sma attempts to show where the most volume traded was over a period. perhaps a volume centre or something. setting back the ma half period you can see how price oscillated around it, this is obvious i think though.

That is sma 80, or the range of the consolidation, the aim is to approx that average. what action will price take if we get there.

not sure exactly about percentage change ma but I can show you some macd.

macd / Percentage price oscillator/ something the author titled log-space macd.

they have many altered versions of indis worth looking at including ma and b bands

You still haven't explained why MA's aren't useful. And, the MACD is just two MA's and the distance between the two, so I don't understand the point you're making. 

Like I said, MA's are very useful for any technical analyst. It's usually the first thing to learn after learning how the candles work. It's amazing that you would claim they're not useful but then fail to explain why.
MA is useful, however, when you have exponential price gain it over-weighs the volume at those high prices and does not give an accurate representation of where the majority of volume was traded within your period of choice. 

MACD shows how that volume is changing. So if i were to believe the macd reading I would think the way the trend shifted and curved back then is obsolete in comparison to what is happening now.
> MACD shows how that volume is changing.

No, I think you're mistaken about that. 

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macd.asp
OK I'm very aware of how it's calculated. I'm just also aware of why it's useful.

Consider an analogy of your argument from a different field.

In classical physics velocity(a) + velocity(b) = velocity(c)

It's one of the first things you learn, and a very useful equation, but
it doesn't hold true for velocities very close to the speed of light.

So surely you shouldn't insist on using the classic equation because it's the first thing learnt.
What does any of that have to do with the fact that MACD has nothing to do with volume?
nothing it relates to the talk on mas

2 ma periods 2 points of max volume. how the position of that volume changes across price progression (the derivative) what  change in volume[supply or demand] entering the system occurred for that to happen.

Price squeezes, macd squeezes, volume flow falls. it's all related, you don't need volume bars to tell you how it's changing.
How do you see volume on MACD. I'm confused. If you're thinking of the bars on the MACD, all that shows is the magnitude of the difference between each moving average, positive or negative. It doesn't tell you anything about volume. Not sure where you're getting this idea.
I explained it. I am not talking about the histogram.
You didn't explain clearly enough.
The bottom line is that supply and demand (buy volume and sell volume) dictate price change. All (good) TA is based on this, price change is an effect caused by those underlying volumes. 

Even if you don't know it you are attempting to reverse engineer information about these volumes from price by conducting TA.

I'll add that bar size is generally correlated with volume, but consolidation contains more total volume, even if the volume flow is slower. It's a liquid region, even if the lower timeframes don't appear so liquid.

Liquidity being the ability to buy and sell without having a major impact on price. A flag may be filled with 'barts' but that price stopped moving to flag means that region was liquid. ( In relation to the higher TF,)

Side note is I'd like to see an indicator which takes the range of a bar and divides by volume. I'm curious to see how that looks. If you know of something similar let me know.

Oh I think time is just a means to an end in TA. If there was a history of all trades I believe the order and price matters, not the time inbetween.

I've been stuck in flight mode so I ended up writing lots. The Macd thing is to difficult to explain without fluid discourse and a chart.

> The bottom line is that supply and demand (buy volume and sell volume) dictate price change. All (good) TA is based on this, price change is an effect caused by those underlying volumes.

You can actually see supply and demand because the order book is dynamic and always changing (plus hidden order, OTC, etc.)

>Even if you don't know it you are attempting to reverse engineer information about these volumes from price by conducting TA.

No, not all TA is volume based. The ichimoku cloud, for instance, has absolutely nothing to do with volume.

>I'll add that bar size is generally correlated with volume, but consolidation contains more total volume, even if the volume flow is slower. It's a liquid region, even if the lower timeframes don't appear so liquid.

Okay, but that's not always the case, obviously. Again, the books and price action change dynamically. 

>Liquidity being the ability to buy and sell without having a major impact on price. A flag may be filled with 'barts' but that price stopped moving to flag means that region was liquid. ( In relation to the higher TF,)

Yep.

>Side note is I'd like to see an indicator which takes the range of a bar and divides by volume. I'm curious to see how that looks. If you know of something similar let me know.

I've thought about doing the same thing. The idea I've come up with is to apply a transparent color gradient on each candle. The more opaque parts of the candle have higher volume.

>Oh I think time is just a means to an end in TA. If there was a history of all trades I believe the order and price matters, not the time inbetween.

Not sure what any of that means.

>The Macd thing is to difficult to explain without fluid discourse and a chart.

I'm gonna call bullshit. MACD has nothing to do with volume and if you can't explain explain how it does then I have no reason to believe otherwise.

MACD is a pair of fast and slow MA's plotted against each other. What could that possible have to do with volume?
I try to pick words so that what I write cannot be misinterpreted. 

This section "Even if you don't know it you are attempting to reverse engineer information about these volumes from price by conducting TA.

No, not all TA is volume based. The ichimoku cloud, for instance, has absolutely nothing to do with volume." 

Shows some failure in our communication. Please carefully re-read and at least humor what I'm trying to say. Otherwise I really don't know how to continue.
Can't you just explain how MACD relates to volume. It can't be that hard or confusing to explain... if what you're saying is true.
Macd = moving average convergence divergence.

Converging = losing momentum
Diverging = gaining momentum

Momentum = supply demand imbalance (buy volume, sell volume)

Momentum change = change in above

Big candels = big volume = large distance between mas= large macd range.

Inverse for small volume.

Squeezing macd (triangle/wedge) obviously shows dropping volume.

The length of macd moves down would correlate with amount of supply, so if it increases or decreases you can see how supply is changing in that timeframe.

Moves up is obviously demand.

Are you satisfied? 

Tell me, why do you think ichimoku works? Japanese Tea leaves? 'self fulfilling prophecy'? Cause investopedia said so?




> Big candels = big volume

This is false.

>Inverse for small volume.

Also false.

>Squeezing macd (triangle/wedge) obviously shows dropping volume.

No it doesn't. MACD shows trend and volatility data. Volume is not necessarily directly tied to either.

>The length of macd moves down would correlate with amount of supply, so if it increases or decreases you can see how supply is changing in that timeframe.

Supply and demand are dynamic and reactive to the market. That's why the indicators eventually change direction.

>Are you satisfied?

No, not really. MACD isn't a volume indicator and you haven't convinced me that there's any meaningful or fundamental correlation. 

>Tell me, why do you think ichimoku works? Japanese Tea leaves? 'self fulfilling prophecy'? Cause investopedia said so?

Lol, I'm not even going to bother.



EDIT:

Here's a [source](http://stockcharts.com/articles/tradingplaces/2015/07/the-power-of-the-macd.html), dummy. 

quote:  

>Remember the **MACD only takes into account price action, not volume**.  If you look at the breakouts that created the negative divergences, the third one was accompanied by heavy volume (compare the volume levels for each of the three blue arrows).  This is much more indicative of accumulation and bullish momentum based on volume.  Again, the MACD ignores volume which is a big mistake on this chart.  In addition, you'd have to look at a larger chart, but the first two breakouts either occurred or were followed by a reversing candle and loss of price support created by the breakout.  Neither of those two bearish developments were present on that third breakout.
Big candels = big volume.
Proof: weekly atr is bigger than daily.
Has 5 days worth of volume.

Mas filter out outliers 

So hard



> Big candels = big volume. 

This is wrong and I think you mean *candles*, not *candels*. (so hard!)

>Proof: weekly atr is bigger than daily. Has 5 days worth of volume.

What does that prove? That doesn't support your conclusion at all. Furthermore, a weekly candle (not candel) encompasses 7 days, not 5, you dumbass.

>Mas filter out outliers

What does that have to do with anything? MA's don't correspond with volume, as I've already explained to you.

What a glaring case of Dunning Krueger effect.
Don't know why your so agressive. I'm bad at spelling, I don't care enough to improve.

You're beliefs about the market are just wrong. You insist I edcucate you on macd under some misguided idea that because I understand it that it must be easy to explain, and you judge based upon your own ideas which are wrong.

Then you refuse to explain how and why ichimoku is useful. 

You've don't provide thought out rebuttals instead you link to investopedia. That's called appealing to authority.

How many markets are open 7 days?

Reflect and consider that perhaps your beliefs may be misplaced.

If you actually want to try and learn something I'm still happy to prod you in the right direction.

I have complete faith in my beliefs about the market, and I understand that this makes seem arrogant and authoritarian.

Let go of the negative emotions those bring and actually think about what I say.

Or don't I'm not the master of your life.
> Then you refuse to explain how and why ichimoku is useful.

It's useful because it shows trend data over multiple time frames. Similar to MA's.

It's not my job to teach you.

>You've don't provide thought out rebuttals instead you link to investopedia. That's called appealing to authority.

Lmao. Stfu. I provided you with a source that refuted your claim that MACD related to volume. It doesn't. You're a blowhard for claiming that it does and not conceding that it has nothing to do with volume, it's price data only. Big candles =/= big volume. 

>How many markets are open 7 days?

Bitcoin and all crypto, duh! Are you really this clueless?

>Reflect and consider that perhaps your beliefs may be misplaced.

Right because investopedia routinely puts out misinformation and Bitcoin only trades 5 days per week, right? Right? /s

>I have complete faith in my beliefs about the market, and I understand that this makes seem arrogant and authoritarian.

Good for you. Doesn't change the fact that you're completely wrong.

>Let go of the negative emotions those bring and actually think about what I say.

I've thought wabout what you said and I even went digging for sources that support your claims. Couldn't find any. Only found sources that supported *my* claim that MACD has nothing to do with volume.

Unless you can cite some reputable sources then I have no reason to believe any of the shit you're pulling out of your ass.

>Or don't I'm not the master of your life.

You're seemingly not master over the truth or facts either. 

Go on, keep on making stuff up out of thin air and pretending it's fact. I'm sure that will get you far in life and won't make you look like a complete sophist jackass.



I don't recall saying or even implying bitcoin only trades 1 day per week.

Have a completely unreliable source.
