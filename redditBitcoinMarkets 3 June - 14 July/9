[Daily Discussion] Friday, July 06, 2018 -- TITLE
#New post: [\[Daily Discussion\] Saturday, July 07, 2018 →](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8wqhds/daily_discussion_saturday_july_07_2018/)
Since it looks like we're consolidating in this range for a bit, I like to take a step back and consider where this is going in the long term. In general, people have been tracking the bitfinex shorts/longs ratio. It's striking that so many longs have opened up here at sub-$7k, where there was mostly disbelief until a significant rally had already happened on the last cycle. I have a few thoughts on this though:

1. What's striking is that while Bitfinex longs greatly outnumber shorts at them moment, the shared open positions (longs vs. shorts) on Bitmex are roughly equal according to Coinfarm. This could mean larger players are intentionally occluding the long-short ratio on finex since so many people are tracking out now, that larger players are buying more than smaller players at these prices, or that there is some other potential cause. Considering the long/short ratio is one of my primary indicators as a scalper, this divergence in long/short ratio has caused it to lose much of its effectiveness lately since shorts have been getting squeezed lately while still at much of a deficit. If anybody has thoughts on this change, I'm all ears.
2. The fact that so many longs keep opening at these low prices also make me think we may be approaching a long-term bottom. If people consider buying here as a low-enough risk that they are willing to open longs despite the potential for further downside, it seems less risky to accumulate here compared to, say, 8 or 10k when people were scared of the bottom dropping out and them losing half their balance if the bear market continued. The whale theorist in me makes me think that larger players still need to accumulate at lower prices, so there is still likely another period of short-term panic to get people to close longs/open shorts to fill their bags, followed by an extended period of accumulation. After all, the most recent bull run was capped off by disbelief with people trying to close longs/short on every bounce. I'm expecting the opposite to happen here, with people attempting to buy every dip until the price can't drop any further. However, if people are willing to buy at sub-$6k prices with the price trending down, it seems promising to me as a buyer that most of the potential downside is gone, and that the longer-term upside is worth, say, another 20-30&#37; drop before it starts going back up again. This perspective obviously requires optimism that Bitcoin adoption will continue to grow and that prices will eventually recover. However, I don't think it's far-fetched considering the many real-life use cases for blockchain technology (and the natural human tendency for greed), even if many of these tradeable coins likely won't serve a function in the future.

(Edit: Also, I don't mean to say $5700-ish is the long-term bottom. I just mean this makes me convinced that if this isn't the bottom, I don't see much downside beyond say the $3.8-$4.2k range people have been citing, even if it gets there. These estimates of $1k or $2k seem a bit far-fetched at the moment (not saying it won't get there), but at least this makes me hopeful that the price is unlikely to reach that low.
**Position Bot Update**


Ok guys, i'm sticking my feet in the sand and sea over the next week (and weekends) for some rest and fun.
I'll have limited access to the database so try to mess up as little as possible  :)

Just PM me or shout out my username if needed so i don't miss any issue.
Both Neymar and Bitcoin diving less than usual today, refreshing.
This observation was **really really fucking interesting to me,** so obviously I thought I'd share with you all. 


-On the 1D we broke down below the ascending support from $5,800 and are **hovering right around $6,500**. Support is at $6,400. 


-The "BTC Market Buy %" on July 4th was 14.29% based on data collected from this website (https://www.turtlebc.com/tools/buy_percentage?period=3years). The last comparable time this percentage was hit (on the upswing) was April 4th, 2018. That day BTC dropped ~$700 (from ~$7,400-$6,700). It subsequently dropped $200 to **~$6,500** on 4/6/2018 and then proceeded to start the short-term bull movement up to $10,000. We are looking at a ***very similar situation*** right now.



Essentially as a % of buys, many people are buying at market price because they are not willing to risk the wait or limit orders hitting. 



I don't know if this is valuable or not, but I thought it was really interesting considering we are right at $6,500 and the % of market buys is eerily similar. Do with it what you will. Not investment advice.

Why is it the pump an hour early? Perhaps that wasn't it?

Curious to see what everyone thinks, do you think getting past the 21 day EMA is enough to kick off the next bull run? 

People who were here during 2014, how similar or different was 2014 to the current market? Do you think we will end up going sideways for awhile or just gradually start moving up like we are now?
Went long at 6602 yesterday but bailed on it this morning at 2.5% loss. Now shorting at 6469. 

If anyone wants to make money, do the opposite of that. I can’t seem to call this right at all at the moment. 

Fuck my life
Too much indecisiveness. Bulls and bears please make up your mind. 

I personally “think” the bulls will win because they defended $6425 pretty well and not even a wick pierced through it. On top of that, bulls also defended RSI 50 on 4h chart pretty well. Bounced above it twice.

On the other side, the bears did a terrible job defending $6600 with multiple wicks breaking above it. 
Follow the money then

Look like we got both buying and selling pressure here, which is not common these days. Usually we only see 1 way pump or dump, not fighting over some price point like this. Bull win please, I am bored with the damn fakeout movement.
Just curious but how many of you guys are net positive this year? I was going through a lot of the previous posts and the majority of people are wrong. Like if they would have done what they said they were going to do they would have lost money.

 In society about 90% of people who try to day trade or swing trade quickly are net negative in the long term. Just struck my curiosity to see what we had going on in here
Closed my short at $6,600

Edit: I haven't seen the market this indecisive in quite some time. Better to be on the sidelines for awhile longer. 
Yes we had some take profit rejections at next 100$ levels, but the sustained big selling pressure is in my opinion getting less for each day. Again the dip below 6500 was quickly bought up

This if for me quite a text book version of price anchoring and how to create a support level. The ones who have sold might mostly have done so already, and people think that since 6500 is bought up to, they might aswell buy in.

Then of course this is not some trend reversal that people like to talk about, maybe it will never be a heavy bull trend again. But at least this price discovery feels more organic than last 2 months
Looking ugly, alts did not react to last bgd but they are dumping now. People didnt take it serious at all.
Looking to close my short at the blue rectangle, 6390~6400:

It's so stupid, but the bullish sentiment in here is making me nervous about my long. I wonder why my subconscious has become conditioned to want to go against the sentiment in this sub.


Closed my short for a small profit at around 6560. 

Price is being tight, not really showing signs of going down, missed opportunities to go down and signaled strength by holding 6500 levels. 
just wanted to pop in and say :Fuck Poloniex:

i know its my fault for leaving bitcoin there but damn they cant even answer a ticket after 2 weeks.

verified but frozen. i should have just eaten it as a loss, now they have my photo  :/
Someone asked below about the mining cost/profitability, but I am going to make this a separate comment so others can also benefit from it, before I post about the cost, let me just tell you that Bitcoin mining cost is not a great indicator of the price, I was involved with Bitcoin since 2012, and on the first block halving (50 BTC to 25BTC) many miners that were not profitable anymore just sold off their GPUs (buying GPUs before the first halving is how I found about BTC)...sometimes for months (especially after bubbles burst) miners barely make a break even.... it is a risk you take when you decide to invest in mining (today this is more or less a corporate business), usually, at this point you should have made a ton of money that you don't really care much, so you just turn off the farm and when mining is profitable again you spin the miners on again. 



There are great and efficient miners out there, but just to simplify our calculations we will assume S9s to be the default miners, the network hashrate as of today is around 36000000 TH/s, assuming Antminers S9s at stock of 14TH/s with consumption of 1300W on the wall this gives us a total of 2.6M S9s to achieve today's network hashrate, the hourly power consumption would be around 3.4gWh, assuming that miners pay a flat $0.10 a kWh (I know it is too high, but just for the sake of the argument) this means an hourly cost of $0.34M

the above is a bit exaggerated so we can exclude other costs such as rent, employees salaries and other costs related to running mining farms. 

there are 6 Bitcoin blocks on average every hour, with each block having 12.5 BTC + fees as a block reward, let's forget the fees for now, so this would make the max Bitcoin production cost around **$4.5K**

Edit: fixed some spelling and added more clarification.
The market seems to have found some sort of support at $6425. It definitely does not looking like strong support, but I would have expected a more decisive drop after having $6800 rejected and some pretty strong bear divs forming. On a micro level this is what I'm watching:

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/I6ee9n4l/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/I6ee9n4l/)

It's all bearish signs on that micro chart:

* 6H cloud resistance rejected
* Bear divergence
* Descending triangle, potentially indicating short term reversal (from up to down)

But my point is, *the market should have dropped further*. That's a similar situation to when $6000 fell a few days ago, *the market should have dropped further*.

And while "the market should have dropped further" is the most bullish statement I could come up with in the short term, there's also a big confluence of support at $6100-6300. Here's a macro view:

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/QHqeNZmk/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/QHqeNZmk/)

* 3D 200 EMA
* 1D tenkan (not on the chart)
* 6H cloud + 6H kijun (see the first chart)

Looking at that second chart, it would not feel crazy being long right now. Especially considering what happened last time we tested the 3D 200 EMA support: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/09O787K4/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/09O787K4/)

I will continue holding my hedge from $6630 at least until the small descending triangle resolves one way or another, if not until $6800-7000 breaks decisively. Bottom line is - the bullish narrative is growing on me...
Seems like alts are tanking today which usually is what preceeds a dump also indicated lack of bullish vibes in the market
I think short term we go up, to 7100-7800 area... After that, we'll have to wait and see.

[As I mentioned this morning](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8wh1a9/daily_discussion_friday_july_06_2018/e1vr6l1), the bullish narrative is growing on me. It doesn't seem like this wants to drop any further (right now at least).

Quite a lot of buying power.. the last few weeks I called I dump over the weekend but pumped 5/6 times .. interesting to see 
Well after many months we have found the answer: 1 btc = $6500, shut it all down folks.     /s 
[What I'm looking at](https://i.imgur.com/zhsQJFl.jpg) to see whether things could go up from here. (200 Day Moving Average)

Alongside VRSI on the weekly being so catastrophically low and the 4 hour being cooled off, I'm wondering if we'll be [breaking our 200 day MA for the first time since April and maybe moving up.](https://i.imgur.com/zJAJmdr.jpg)

I expect more sideways movement in the medium term but the relative (for bitcoin) lack of movement either way in the last month (16&#37; range) means and the above makes me believe a short-term move up is likely.

Long-term I'm still a [moon-math vocalist.](https://www.moonmath.win/)
Im seeing that we broke our downtrend line from May 4 with good volume. Resistance from the april double top is around 8000. I think we will test the 6800 resistance again in a couple days once everyone feels confident in 6400 holding. Need to hedge there again but I feel like this time we will break through to 7300 before consolidating again. Finally test the resistance at 8k which will require a large hedge. No idea what happens after that. Adding to my long here

!long xbtusd 6,550.00 5.00X 25.00%
Closing my $6600 short here for a modest profit.  Moving into a long.  We may still drop to $6350-$6400, but this is looking like a play-for-play version of April.  I'll cut this lose if we drop below the $10k support line at $6250.
[Bitcoin is at a crucial point in its history right now.](https://imgur.com/a/1I9eqRZ)

Monetary base inflation is currently ~~just above 4%~~ 3.8%. That's pretty much slightly-high-normal inflation for industrialized capitalistic nation states (this is standard rate for many G20 nations). 

At the time of the next halvening (2020), the inflation rate will drop to ~1.5%, which is well below the current inflation rate of the US (~2.7%). Over the past ten years, Bitcoin has transitioned from highly inflationary to relatively low/stable inflation and within the next 5-10 years will transition to an *effectively* deflationary commodity. 

Obviously this has ramifications for users, investors and miners alike and it'll be interesting to see how a fee market develops and what happens with hashing power. The following halvening (2024) brings the inflation rate well below 1%, which basically marks the end of inflation.  

The next 6 years are critical.

edit: updated with accurate current inflation rate
[Watching this trend line currently for a break to the upside.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/u6UKHSo2/)  It'll be really interesting to see if this April fractal actually plays out.
Look at this setup right now, it's basically a fractal of the setup leading up to the pump-'o-clock two days (47 hours) ago. If we break above 1h EMA26 and then find support on the EMA12 there is a meme possibility of pump. Or fake-out 

EDIT: an erectile dysfunction pump happened while typing. Here comes that awkward moment
Have been following this for a while being a long-term Wyckoff accumulation. Feeling rather bullish and have a large long position all up in that SPRING.

This is the same uneasiness that I felt when I shorted at 7400's all the way to 7700's, when many people were convinced BTC was gonna break out. 

Right now, I am either terribly wrong or terrifically right..
Closed my short from 6615 at 6510 this morning. I was expecting it to at least retest 6400 today, bit given the action, I think it's safer to just close it and look how this will move for the next few days. This + i'm tired of looking at charts, I need a break lol.
ETH is looking very bearish to me. 

Failure to breach its downtrend since May 5th. Looks like more of a channel than a falling wedge. Descending triangle top on this last attempt to breakout. 

ETH could be on its way to making new lows since it has not done so yet. I'm thinking that could possibly bring BTC down with it.

Edit: Bitcoin looks like it's has a descending triangle going on too.

Another dosage of my TA, much like a prostate exam or a rogue erection when you hug your Uncle... no one wants it, but i'm giving it to you anyway.

ICHIMOKU CLOUD http://imgur.com/CXzlT4E
- We are still sitting above the 4 hour Cloud with current support around 6330 (Binance). The cloud is pretty thin here so I don't really expect it to hold should we reach it.

- The 4 hour Kijun is sitting at 6480, hopefully that'll provide a bit more support in case we break down into the cloud again.

- We are also still above the 2 hour cloud although we have now broken under the 2 Kijun line. Support here for the cloud is at 6350

- Looking at the 4 hour and the resistance points we have available, i'm going to say falling under it and hitting the 6130 price area, in my opinion is highly likely to be the end of this mini bull run with a return to perhaps new lows.


MOVING AVERAGES 144WMA & 5 SMMA

- 2 hour chart, we are now moving close to a cross to the negative with this trusty mix of MAs. The last negative cross sent us from 6600 down to our yearly low... so i'm gonna watch this like Maddy's parents  should have watched Maddie. That is to say, you know... i'll actually give a shit.

- Same goes for the 4 hour chart, we are now aiming down pretty hard at this cross over, although it likely wouldn't happen for a few days at least. Again the last cross also sent us to a new yearly low.


RSI http://imgur.com/LAA6cxu

- Certainly looking like we could be running out of steam a tad. Rejected at the 50 line and now starting to just turn down again. Nothing to write home about just yet but something to certainly keep an eye on in the coming days

Was hoping we'd at least attack the RSI resistance line and area that I circled last week but seems we just don't have the strength at the moment.

STOCH and ADX/DMI

- Daily stoch has now crossed from positive to intertwined with no clear direction yet
- 4 hour stoch now firmly negative and heading closer to the oversold region
- 2 hourly now oversold 
- 4 hour ADX/DMI has now crossed negative with a weakening trend, pretty much same for the 2 hour. All in all it's currently stale mate until the next big move comes in.


$$$ Dream Scenario (never gonna happen) Bear Market over
- Above the ATH trend line and the daily cloud... = 9300


Going to start taking some profits at the current price. My noob senses are tingling that this will go down. Its like sellers  just made the RSI cooldown last week before resuming the downtrend.
[https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2018/07/06/bitcoins-lightning-network-could-play-havoc-with-the-bitcoin-price/2/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2018/07/06/bitcoins-lightning-network-could-play-havoc-with-the-bitcoin-price/2/)

>*"If overall transaction levels remain constant but shift to the Lightning Network, then this should result in reduced mining fees, said Garrick Hileman, head of research at Blockchain.com and co-founder of Mosaic.io, a platform for market intelligence on cryptocurrencies. "Indeed, many miners in the bitcoin scaling debate opposed the introduction of the SegWit upgrade (which paved the way for Lightning) due to concerns over the reduction in mining fess that would result from transactions moving to Lightning."*

I'm a tad confused by Garrick's point here.

If overall transaction levels remain constant then BTC isn't working as a means of payment/being adopted for use. If all the transactions shift to the LN, then clearly it is working as a technology, and thus BTC is likely to be functioning as a means of payment and thus merchant adoption and the number of transactions will increase. Unless we're suggesting some mass adoption of an alternative coin that'll steal away a sizeable quantity of merchant TXs, but I don't think any have anywhere near the merchant adoption rate as BTC right now.

No one will route their life savings or mortgage down-payments, for example, through LN, when the on-chain process is hard proven and immutable. And this means there will always be a 'sufficient number' of transactions on the main chain to sustain miners fees. And to be frank, if LN succeeds and massively increases merchant adoption and BTC takes off in the public eye, we'll have to have the discussion of 'reasonable fees' for on-chain, given that you should *theoretically* only be moving sizeable funds on-chain.

I can't wrap my head around the theoretical scenario Garrick seems to be suggesting whereby *LN works but doesn't result in an overall adoption of BTC and an associated increase of on-chain transactions.*

Any thoughts chaps?

EDIT: As a side point, miners can't exactly resist LN; they don't have to change protocol for it to work and so can't resist it like they did SegWit/SegWit2x (with different results admittedly)
The Bitmex UP options contract seems to be a low cost bargain with strike price at 6750. Cost is sitting around 0.0053 BTC for a 0.1 BTC contract, which seem to be cheaper than similar options at [deribit.com](https://deribit.com) (if I'm reading it right).

Does anyone here trade BTC options or use them for hedging?

Edit: LOL, I missed a "0" in my calculations. The Bitmex option is 10x more expensive than on Deribit.
10 day MA is about to cross the 20 day MA, quite a bullish signal. MACD looking good also. Might open a position at close today.
Here is what I'm seeing:

4H: https://www.tradingview.com/x/T0oLCg3K/

1) The right shoulder of a possible H&S forming

2) Bearish divergence

3) Resistance line all the way from 8800, [thank you /u/dreamsfollower](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8wh1a9/daily_discussion_friday_july_06_2018/e1vymxd/)

4) Each consecutive pump from 5800 to 6780 carrying less volume than the previous one. 1st - 16k, 2nd - 10k, 3rd - 5k

I think there is a possibility we may be in process of distribution, as we were in 7.8k in early June (blue rectangle). Accumulation/Distribution Line indicator is in a downtrend
Question to you guys who trade alts, do you guys typically see their price movements proceed BTC or after? 

Just seeing a lot of red on coinmarketcap and wondering if it's because people are buying into BTC via alts
While I'm at it, why not get all my "dumb" questions over with, so here goes: What are the strategic options when someone is underwater? What's the thinking about that? 100% holding, if confident of recovery, versus cutting loose some of the stack (selling with a loss) in order to have something to continue trading, and the last option, capitulation (selling it all, at a local peak). (Edit: Cue the smart-ass comments announcing that "such questions" show retail money is returning.)
Tethered up since $6600. Ascending wedge broke down as expected. Going to wait on the sidelines until the bulls can prove themselves worthy to me.

Keep an eye on RSI 50 4h chart. Breaking below that would give bears some power.
Visited coinmarketcap after a long time. Where did the big one and zb.com come from? That too in the top 3 exchanges? 
What are the possible effects of trade war between USA/China for bitcoin prices?
Bulls just barely defended that daily candle! IDK if that means anything but it got me fired up! 
bitcoin, the bank of the internet.

but first, one more week of shaking traders out.
Staying out errr in, not trading today. I think we are headed for a breakout anytime now and shorting feels incredibly unsafe.
Let emotions influence you you must not.
I drew up a channel last night on the 4 hour to watch that it appears we keep returning to and placed a trade with a stoploss set against it at 6400. 

The follow up to this morning showed that BTC bounced off the bottom of this area, I'm currently anticipating a check of 6900. 

If you want to view the charts they are in the trading section report of my daily write up.

Retail is nowhere to be seen. YouTube crypto channels are dead, Google trends popped. I dont see how this can run far :( these are not fertile grounds for a bull run.
Personally I'm waiting until we are closer to the halving then I'll leverage long.

Still keeping my cold storage and only mental accounting 'these are profits. You cashed out a lot already' helps me to keep my sanity 
Bought in back at 6500; hidden bullish divergence on the 4h; expecting a big upwards movement today

Will re-evaluate if btc goes below 6350
I haven’t been watching the charts today but every time I open the app the price is exactly the same. Part of me feels like when this happens in the past the price tanks eventually. Any TA? I’m long right now but debating on closing as this stagnation feels bearish. 
I'll be commenting over this is my news tomorrow, interesting channel we keep returning to on the 4 hour.  StochRSI is oversold atm which is not matching with higher timeframes, but if the next push up is big 
 on price action then we could be looking for our first test of ~~6800~~ 6900 since June 11th-ish. 

I'd certainly expect that if it breaks down to see a return to 5900 range check.

I’m still thinking we’re in a descending triangle. Broadened a bit since last night but seems to be intact.

what is the average price to mine a bitcoin? are miners underwater as well?
Shortet?
Trump is doubling down on trade war with China!? Wow. This ain't going to take food off US or Chinese leaders plates, it's only going to hurt their citizens. 

What do you do when your country is 20 trillion in debt, outsourced basically all manufactoring to Asia, and is in the worst recession our country had ever seen?? I know, let's mess with China. Ya know, the place that makes 90% of the stuff people in the U.S. buy regularly. GENIUS!

I for one hope this is bullish for crypto. Screw this trade war stuff. I'm sick of the dollar losing more and more buying power each year. I'll be one of the first to drop this dollar in place of various crypto. 

Seeing as our dollar has lost 2 % value each year for the last 30 years, why bothering holding those USD "bags" that are guaranteed to keep losing value each year? 

It was once said "you don't go to war to lose money, you go to war to make money." 

This isn't a difficult decision for American or Chinese people if they want to try to shield themselves from our rogue leaders.
Can someone post their wave count? Trying to get a hang of some EW over here... I'm looking at +4h timeframes. Thanks in advance!
Can't believe I did this, but I'm FOMOing into another long because it looks like the latest dumper is running out of gas, it's payday, and shorts often get covered on Fridays. Plus, the sixth and all that. 

Long from 6550. Will add if it goes down to 6K. (I have my reasons for not using the position bot)
We about to see BGD? 
I've been waiting for a nice slow, steady, sustained rise, and the 15% over the past week is beginning to qualify. If we're up another 5% by next Friday, flirting with $7K, I'm confidently calling a reversal that will accelerate rapidly. Why, you ask?

Because a million people buying $1000 in BTC apiece ad/or 1000 people buying a million apiece will juice this for another big squirt up. If we keep going up for the next week and the rest of the financial world continues to look shaky, it will be two million * $2000 and 2000 * $2mil by the end of the month. Very bullish. Think I'm gonna ride this long from 6550 (this morning, comment was buried for some reason [Lolol like I don't know]) for a while. It might just be the one I've been looking for lo these couple months.
Friday's payday in a few hours. I'm happy to get some discounted crypto so bleed on Btc.
Going to wait to buy till tonight since price might breakdown even more. 
6,340 alert set to start considering buying as supposedly that will kick off the breakdown.  We'll see I suppose.


BTC risks falling below $6,341 (double bottom neckline - former resistance-turned-support, the lower end of the trading range) as indicated by the bearish setup on the hourly and 4-hour chart.
Acceptance below $6,341 would abort the bullish view put forward by the double bottom breakout, bull flag breakout and bullish falling channel breakout and would shift risk in favor of a drop below $6,000.
On the higher side, an aggressive move above the significant obstacle of $6,754 (23.6 percent Fibonacci resistance) would bolster the already bullish technical setup on the daily chart and open doors to $7,000.

iH&S on 15 minutes, 21 day ema support just below, let's see.

Edit: It would be great if you could exalain why this is not a good entry instead of just downvoting. I've been considering opening a small long since we closed just above several support lines yesterday and this looks like a low r/r entry with an easy stop loss.   
   
!long XBTUSD 6515 5x 5%   
stop 6480
Almost time to pay back those Euroshorts, boyz.
Goodbye All.

I'm done here... 

If people track and save all here..... and ask later what investments you do , with names etc etc.

Done for me here. Ciao

It looks like another sideways month really, between 6k and 7k. Only way that something happens is if there's news about ETFs and that stuff.
hi master traders, it's me again~ the one who lost 25% of my stack in a few days, i have try my hand on bitmex and have some questions.
i long btc at 6508.50 and set stop market at 6347.50. leverage 10x.
am i doing this right? just a small amount for testing
what is the best roe% to sell? like above 3%? will it cover the fees? and if it hit my stop market amount will i lose everything or partial of my initial investment?

also how do i bet on the futures contract for sept? what are its pros and cons compared to perpetual ones?  
Hmmm bots working hard to get it a bit down. Finex.

Ready to buy!. 
Hey guys, I've had my bouts (and success) of trading from 1+ years ago. However, recently... the devil tempted me, and I've made a net-loss of 1% on my Crypto. I have an urge to revenge trade (which, thankfully I ignored today). 

A little bit of me can see myself falling down the hole, I think I just need a longer break .. maybe that will make me feel better. (I'm away for some weeks in July anyway) 

How should I approach this situation? I think I should play it safe, as  I have been doing, when the next rounds of bulls happens I will most likely be able retire early vs potentially fucking up my future over a small amount of unfortunate. 

Eurgh 
i think someone figured out how to market make the "barts" so now that other whale who was moving the market is getting played?
I'm shorting this pump on testnet just to see how I would've done had I try to scalp this. Wake me up when we go parabolic again. I remember when the price would move 100-300 in either direction in minutes. Now, we just range 100-300 bucks for days.

I'm not in your list and never disclosure my trade or investment ( only that I'm a buyer and not how many / much $$)

Just keep doing what you’re doing and you won’t end up on ‘the list.’ The people that use the bot choose to do so by posting their positions in a format that the bot picks up. Those users are well aware that the positions are tracked publicly.
If there are any “traders” in this sub that can provide proof that the majority of trades they have done in the last 6 months have been consistently profitable I will send them 4 ETH. 
I was today years old that I learned crypto was a giant joke when Bianance added Dent to their repetoire.
I'm expecting a big move, one way or another, in the next few hours / days
totally agree, and excellent point re long/short.

the bitmex funding, like the finex L/S ratio is a pretty good indicator too. during the previous bounce up to 9k longs were paying outrageous funding fees. whilst now its practically as low as it can be, and has been like that since the "bottom".

Makes me feel very Bullish + agree about 5700-6200ish being the long term bottom

What makes you think we are consolidating and not distributing? You kind of skipped over that important detail.

Never heard of that website and, looking at it now, I don't trust it at all. 

This reads like some sort of marketing plug for this sketchy website ~~and [your analysis earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8w7k00/daily_discussion_thursday_july_05_2018/e1tkb7i/), falsely said that 1d BBands had breached to the topside. [Upon further inspection](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Gg4dgUtG/) that doesn't seem to be the case.~~ (actually I misread your comment, you said the mean was breached, not the top band)

tl;dr website sketchy, wouldn't trust data, ~~analysis doesn't really pass the 'truth' test~~

edit: Sketchy website

China unbans Crypto (again) /s
Kobayashi felt like some friday fun
That wasn't the pump. It's Friday, the day when large OTC shorts cover. They don't do it every Friday. Sometimes it's COB Europe, sometimes Chicago, sometimes West Coast. Last week was West Coast. If it's Europe this week, look for a pump around 10:30 AM EST. 

I don't think that last burst was short covering. It looks more like whale buying. The big short covers are where you see the really BGDs.
 Looks like the bulls want to break out, but everybody else is watching instead of pushing. To be fair the bulls came too early to the party 
possible h&s?
look out for fakeout with that stop :) Im longing from here as I hope we cross that line and 3D MACD will become green. GL
I don't personally agree that this is or will be like 2014-2015 mainly because we don't have the same insane downward pressure from stolen Gox coins (that we didn't actually get confirmation were stolen until long into the downtrend). My opinion, but it makes sense to me.

That said, I expect sideways for an annoyingly long time (even a couple weeks could do it but I'm guessing longer). Thing is, "sideways" is usually put into perspective by future prices, not necessarily past or even current prices. Looking back at 2015, one could say it ranged between ~200 and just shy of 350. At the time, that certainly didn't seem like sideways (175% bottom to top). To look at it now, 200-350 definitely does seem like sideways.

A low of 5775 with an upwards swing of 175% puts us at ~10k. Would you consider that sideways? I don't think many of us would (I certainly wouldn't). But if that ends up being "the sideways", we may already be in that range with bottoms in February, April, and June.

Of course I could be (and probably am) completely wrong. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
No. The 21 day EMA is a random number that is literally meaningless. Why not the 23 day? Or the 36 day? 

The only MAs and EMAs that matter even a little bit are 50 period and 200 period because those create the golden/death cross and therefore many people trade them.
well you're shorting at support and longing resistance :/
You're right about the revenge trade. You guys made me see sense. Thanks! I'm out now and going to go sit tight and cool down for a bit.

Thanks again

Edit: If we ever meet, I'll buy you each a beer. The price shot just after I closed my short lol
Revenge trading is bad man
Sit out dude. Bitcoin has been doing exactly the opposite of the move I make past 3 days. It's not just you this game feels rigged right now. 
You are flipping very fast .. from Long to short?
Exit your short.
This is some solid TA, and judging by the upvotes I'm guessing many think so also 

Edit: [I agree with your post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8wh1a9/daily_discussion_friday_july_06_2018/e1vkezm?utm_source=reddit-android)

Edit2: "Too much indecisiveness. Bulls and bears please make up your mind. 

I personally “think” the bulls will win because they defended $6425 pretty well and not even a wick pierced through it.

On the other side, the bears did a terrible job defending $6600 with multiple wicks breaking above it. "

Original comment before edited 
Bearish
Bullish /s
Impressed with how this was pushed back up.

Feels like 6400 is being defended well.
SIX is also the largest payment processor in the country and themselves provide the majority of card payment terminals. 

If they're building up the infrastructure to manage trading then it's only a matter of time before they also introduce crypto payments (via QR code) from their terminals. Many newer card terminals already offer non-crypto QR payment through an app called Twint, so the foundation is there, and it's certainly a win-win for SIX so they can take more fees that they do not need to share with the likes of VISA or Maestro.

This is going to move very quickly I think. Switzerland was slow to jump on board the contactless payment bandwagon a couple of years ago, but once most people held contactless credit-cards, compatible terminals seemed to spring up everywhere almost overnight. 

Watch this space, I would say.
Apparently it's not cryptocurrencies, only assets per [Adam Back and article](https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/1015220872586694656). Curious how this will pan out in EU market given that stateside, Overstock's T0 has been in-progress for years and Blythe Master's DAH has faded from news.
I absolutely love your charts. Cheers mate!
If you're saying it's a head and shoulders then your re-entry point of 5700 is too high, right?
The whales are on holiday, so the minnows are fighting over the price.

We'll find a new trend only when the volume comes back. Until then, the market is going to be stupid.
Most people who try to day trade are net negative in the short term too lol. My fiat is up 30&#37; since April. The result of 2 or 3 long trades since I can't short on margin on my exchange. Though, I feel behind since I have a tendency to compare myself to others on here. And margin shorters have been making a killing. I'm patiently waiting for our next rally to go long again.
Up overall or up in BTC? I'm up in BTC with my trading stack by about 150% this year... but way down in fiat since December because my trading stack is only a portion of my total. I think it's (somewhat) easy to be up in BTC with a bit of luck, paranoia, and copying Chewy. Being up in fiat takes a fucking wizard in this market. 
You can't know when they close. If the price is above/below their long/short entry at any point after they posted a position then they could've closed in profit.

but I mean yeah I generally agree. are you 0x0x0x0x? cause he asked this like 12h ago
Up quite a bit, but only cause i managed to foresee Ontology's coming rise when launched. Bought big at $1,5 and sold all around $9.

Otherwise a bit up in btc amount in btc trades but down in fiat value there.
I'm net positive in terms of BTC which is what I want for long term anyway. Down a little bit in fiat but not concerned. Got lucky with some alt pumps and cashed out to btc. Been slowly divesting again from bitcoin to undervalued alts I like. Also been toying with margin trading btc.
You didn't do it on a spike to 6.8, you did it on a spike to 6.6... I'm really curious.
Shorted at $6550 yesterday and, shit you not, the price rallied $100 straight up from that short. I held until it finally broke to $6400 and I though "finally, I can rest from looking at charts"... But I soon as I do a quick peek I see bulls spiked up large buys all day long out of nowhere making price slide upwards.

Exited short at $6520. All profit went to cover fees. Exchange wins. FML.

Honestly, this market just looks like MM's spiking everyone's stop losses systematically so they can make money in an otherwise consolidating and low volume market.
Might I inquiry your reasoning there friend?
Thanks for closing, now I'm much more peaceful with my long knowing that I'm not the opposite site of chewtoys trade :). Fucked up, I know.
I agree, ETH especially is looking pretty dangerous.
If that ugly af iH&S gonna play out eventually that will be a clear sign of reversal imo. That’s why I find it hard to believe it’s gonna happen but i wish!
Just read people's post history and you'll feel better (or maybe worse lol)
Man I have a ticket from like 6 months ago that is unanswered.

I sent coins to their exchange (Proof is in the blockchain) to the wallet address that is still on my account there as my deposit address, and they have still not shown up (alt-coin not bitcoin)

Shit show.
Thanks for the breakdown. But I think this is just part of the picture. A full accounting should incorporate the initial capital expense of buying the mining equipment, which can be amortized across the useful life of the equipment. This would arrive at a fully burdened cost of mining. I’d be interested in learning that figure. 
Are you just completely ignoring the cost of the hardware in your calculation? It's a fixed cost but still should be part of the equation, right?

Also, $0.10 per kWhr might not be too unreasonable with cooling costs and stuff rolled in.
In many places with very low electricity costs I would be surprised if a fair bit of "profit" doesn't get spent greasing palms. Along with the equipment/space/maintenance/cleaning cost issue. (Flood in China at the moment not helping) While any calculation will have some flaws, I like that this ball park figure can be quite close. I guess $4.5k is closer to the true than max value, though I think the true cost could be higher.
>But my point is, the market should have dropped further. That's a similar situation to when $6000 fell a few days ago, the market should have dropped further.



This is almost exactly my thinking. I am also placing a lot of emphasis on MAs and pointed out yesterday that we are now above the 20D MA, which historically was always a short-term bullish indicator. Thanks for pointing out the 3D 200 EMA. Only time will tell. Best of luck. 
Can you define... which alts?
7800 would be a major breakout
Enjoy your posts! Haven't seen them in awhile, welcome back, I think? 
It'll be interesting to see where some of these longer term MA's cross. The 50 and 30 week MA's are due to death cross within a few weeks, somewhere in the low $8K range. Perhaps the price retests the 30 somewhere around the cross and then legs back down. 
7800 then rug pull right?

Edit: yeah this actually feels just like 7500 after that last wick
 terrifically right because ... longs:shorts ratio.
That has got to be one of the most well consolidated log trend lines I've seen this year, that's like 5 points of perfect contact without a breakout lol
Same here, I posted this chart in ethtrader https://www.tradingview.com/x/fOZbEEgd

Rejected a lot of times and the fun(?) fact is that if you holded ETH For 1 year now your basically at +- 0 or down a few %

Again shows how much of a stupid meme that is
Save a life. Adopt an abandoned cryptokitty today.
I have some k$ ETH on my ledger ( cold storage). But to be honest, I do not check price... 
In general ETH is following BTC. ( and that counts for mainly all other - low value - ALTS. ).

Maybe a few $$ Up and down but when BTC goes up or down ... Alts are following.. like a puppy.

My 2 cents
Isn't that to do with EOS selling their ETH tho, which has finished now?
Hey Rich - great analysis. Thanks!

Quick one - what is the indicator called that you show at the bottom of the chart - the one with the twirling from green to red etc....

Thanks in advance.
Miners can resist LN completely by pushing and switching to BCH, that’s one of the main pillars behind the old fork’s arguments.  

LN seems about as popular as sitting on a cactus so their fears may have been unwarranted but you can see where they are coming from in wanting to protect their profits.
> No one will route their life savings or mortgage down-payments, for example, through LN, when the on-chain process is hard proven and immutable.

What exactly is lightning for? Is it strictly for micropayment, where the receiver needs to send an invoice and it doesn't matter if the payment is reliably received?

Bitcoin can never be a serious global currency if lots of people can't use it (either directly on-chain or on a secondary layer) to send serious payments like mortgage payments.

If you want a second layer that works quickly and reliably, why not just get rid of decentralization entirely? Just have a single payment processor handle all the payments off chain.

I don't understand why the lightning network is trying to make itself decentralized, because that very same decentralization is killing it by making it unreliable.
So for 1 BTC, 0.053 BTC

Effectively, you are starting off with ~~5% loss~~ actually more because strike price is higher than the current price.

BTC would have to reach 7107.75 by July 13th to just break even.

It's probably wiser to just go long and set a reasonable SL < 5%
It just signals that the last 10 days were more bullish than the previous 10 days right? I'll file this one under "indicators which would be useful if you had a time machine", much like the over-hyped "death cross".
I don't get it, why closing of the day is so important, is it stock market habits? Crypto markets are open 24/7, at the time of your day closing there is active trading going on on the other side of the world. The price moves around every second without stopping, anytime anything can happen. So why did you choose exactly the day closing in your time zone?
Nice sum up. You made me more confident in my short :) I would also add the 1.5 longs/shorts ratio to the list.
Where is the bearish div? I have a hidden bullish div visible on the 4H and 12H https://www.tradingview.com/x/5T1RZA7k/

Also confirmed on RSI. But not on OBV.

And yeah, the volume is concerning.
I asked u/_chewtoy_ earlier about what his thoughts were with the current price action compared to what we sawJune 2-8 in my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8wh1a9/daily_discussion_friday_july_06_2018/e1vxp8j?utm_source=reddit-android).

The sentiment of the sub in regards to indecision during both times feels about the same 
The last couple of weeks alts usually start declining before Bitcoin, especially if it's 90% of them. 
I trade both BTC and alts. Honestly, oftentimes I only move into and out of Alts-BTC. I only trade the Alts that I am looking to hold in the long-term, just in case I do make a bad entry at some point. On Coinmarketcap, at the top you can see the BTC dominance % (currently 42.4%). Alt coins are far more risky than BTC from an investment perspective, so during downtrends they get hit much harder. But during bull runs, Alts typically outperform BTC because of their potential for return. 



To get to your question, a great alt coin is able to hold value during times when BTC is sideways. They typically follow the macro trend set forward by BTC (after BTC moves). For instance, it is very rare for a smaller alt (outside of ETH) to really trade according to its own charts. Rather, the charts will be painted by its reaction to BTC swings and movements. 
After mostly. On these intraday movements most of the alts follow bitcoin directions although not exactly 1:1. 

However the day before the BGC that brought us to 7500 in April there were a couple alts with massive gains. I remember cardano was up like 20% because I had a bunch of cardano at the time. I thought that was a really good sign that money was going into the market and we'd see a move soon for BTC. 
Watch XLM. No idea why but for some reason it appears to be a really great indicator for BTC. 
These questions are highly predicated upon where your position is in the market... for example a buy at $20k has been underwater for 7 months now... a short at the $5900 low in Feb would have been underwater for 4.5 months.  Cutting either of these positions loose, even at a big loss, and then simply following trend with the remainder of your trading stack would have resulted in net gains.  Holding these positions would have resulted in either long periods on the sidelines or liquidations depending on leverage.

Risk/loss management is arguably the most important part of trading.  Buy support, sell resistance.  Cut losers early and let winners ride.  Biggest losses happen when you get married to a position, fail to set stops and hope for a turn around.

Thing is.. there are no hard and fast rules in trading that work *every time*... and so you have to build strategies based on probabilities (part of what TA is all about) and then accept that some of the time, those strategies won't go your way.
This is hard to answer without knowing your personal situation, how much trading you are/have done, how much of your income is in crypto, how old you are etc.

One thing is for sure, if you've been naively bullish until today, *now* might not be the best time to suddenly turn bearish. Turning bearish made sense when 12k broke down properly. 

But you definitely have to decide for your self how much more you're willing to lose. At a micro-level we're sitting just below resistance right now. Taking out a portion now isn't a bad idea. You can more safely buy back in above $7200 or so, without a major loss.

But then... Bitcoin will not care about my opinion. What do I know, a random person on the Internet ;)
In most cases just look at those positions as if you've just opened them. I.e. if you went long at 6500 and the price dropped to 6200, ask yourself if you'd go long at 6200. If yes, just leave it, if no, you should've had a stop loss before the price reached that point.   
      

>  Cue the smart-ass comments announcing that "such questions" show retail money is returning

Don't know why that guy said that, it was a pretty silly comment regardless. Your other question doesn't indicate anything but someone curious about trading. 

Your questions have some really complicated answers that are basically similar to "How do I play an instrument really well? It's difficult to play fast music with lots of notes"

What you're looking for here specifically is risk management- I have written about this before. Maybe I can dig it up again if I'm still up later/if you're curious, but you can look it up and read about it yourself as well.

Risk management is integral to trading- probably the most important part of being a successful trader long term. Most people fail miserably at it and that's why they go broke/lose money before quitting.

In particular look up "asymmetric risk reward trading" on google.
Deciding a strategy (buying, selling, margin...) should be made completely independent of your current balance, performance (or lack thereof) and made only based on price action. Use your current balance (USD+BTC) to calculate your position size.

Likewise deciding when to exit a position should be made regardless of what you "think" the market might do and should be based exclusively on your risk management and portfolio management.

Basically, "underwater" does not exist, "selling at a loss" does not exist. You already lost that money. The act of selling does not lose any more money than you already lost. Same for the decision of holding, it does not magically prevent your loss.

The real question is what are you going to do with your remaining balance.
strategy is kinda secondary here. Remaining rational and keeping your emotions in check so that you can reassess is the hard part.

In a perfect world you would sell at local peak and then buy back at the low.  Holding saves on transaction fees but results in less profit, it's also emotionally more comfortable.

If you add leverage into the mix then things get more complicated.
Why did someone downvote you? This is getting ridiculous. 
I’m not sure about the second one... but, the big one is a new exchange which looks to be wash trading... They have an exchange coin. Which is why I think they’re doing it - for exposure to their exchange, which can lead to more people buying their exchange coins. They don’t even need a ton of people to actually use the site for trading. Binance started off doing the same thing, and look where they are now. 
Decline in the global market has generally paralleled btc dips. It makes sense, crypto is a speculative asset and those are the first to go. Now, let's say China makes a call on all of the U.S. debt it's owed and crashes the Dollar. That should theoretically be bullish for btc as an alternative currency.
Just feels like chop to me, one red one green... repeat
Tape status: painted.
> shaking traders out.

I don't mean that in a bad way either. day/swing traders play an important role in the market.
Why, curious for  your reasoning 
Emotional trading is the best way to get rid of your stack quick
As soon as the price shows any strength they will come back, humans love to follow one another and buy high.
Are retail investors really your holy grail?

We've already seen that, aside from niche cases and black market, BTC is not exactly the optimal medium of exchange.

There is plenty of value in the tech, even for it to moon from here, but it befuddles me when folks get hung up on the retail investor thing.

You go to overstock.com a lot or what?
All of those things will follow price. Plebs will NOT be interested in bitcoin until the price starts rising significantly. We don't need them to bring the price up, only for it to go parabolic (which I'd be happy to avoid anyway).
What makes you think retail is nowhere to be seen? I see lots and lots of organic looking little buys in the order history between pumps and dumps.
Based upon my experience in 2014 the ideal time to buy is when retail is absent. When trends change no one wants to buy the commodity entering a new bull market. The only questions are when the next run happens and if it happens :-)
Institutional investors. I have a feeling as their money pours in we may see a spike in price without the Google trend backing it for the first time. Of course, as the price spikes the Google trend will follow and probably push the price higher as more people experience fomo. Just a thought.
The Pokemon card fad was popular in the 90s and the Pokemon Go fad resurrected the franchise recently.  Hodl tight, maybe one day e-pogs will be cool again too.  Besides institutional investors are RIGHT around the corner, I bet no more than ~2 weeks away at this point.
Did we not already have a test of 6,800 two days ago?
Yeah, I am checking data on bitfinex and my triangle looks a bit longer, but still seems valid. Blue.

Why people down vote this? 
I am not an expert in TA. But can the bull flag which now went below previous BGD be valid?

Edit: I mean it is much bigger than the actual pole now, the flag is underground.
lol, there’s always a way to flip things to the positive side
not sure if i'd call it a bull flag but it looks good :P
With the floods in china, many mining farms are *literally* under water.
Last I heard it averaged around $5k.
https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-how-much-it-costs-to-mine-a-single-bitcoin-in-your-country-2018-03-06
Nah bitcoin mining is almost completely centralized and thus highly efficient.  Probably not even close to being underwater, the price was under $1,000 not too long ago and they were doing fine then and are likely making a killing now.

>Seeing as our dollar has lost 2 % value each year for the last 30 years

This is exactly what currencies are trying to achieve. It's the same about the Euro
> Seeing as our dollar has lost 2 % value each year for the last 30 years, why bothering holding those USD "bags" that are guaranteed to keep losing value each year? 

You aren't supposed to and literally nobody but clueless libertarians think you should be able to. Money at rest means a stagnant economy.  Go invest your money in stocks and take advantage of compounding interest.  Money is for buying stuff, not "hodling" for decades.  
>and is in the worst recession our country had ever seen


TIL we’re in a recession right now, and it’s apparently even worse than the Great Depression
Yeah, BTC is deflationary for now (they were talking about adding a small amount of inflation recently) but it is no where near prime time to replace any major fiat, as of now it is more of an idea or proof of concept. So, as such, probably not relevant to the market channel. 

However, there is some truth to the argument that fiat should not be losing so much buying power and externalizing business to make more profit is short sighted, so, what is the solution? What does a correction of the problem look like? Is this an effort to stave off election for an attempt at a second term?
Fuck china
I think most people here think EW is revisionist history hogwash. 
Yea we get it. You’re bullish. 
Yes, certainly millions of people will start buying now that you've opened a long. Much analysis. Very bullish.
Can get onboard with this. 

Barts down seem to be getting reversed by steady organic rises.

Still bearish overall but the slope of the regression line is flattening - an upcoming reversal is looking more likely for me.
Bulls are getting downvoted lol.
So ... we / holder's need to bleed.... so you can buy some discounts.   

Not friendly?

FYI. I do not have a pay day
FTFY: [source](https://www.coindesk.com/stuck-between-key-chart-points-bitcoin-price-seeks-direction/).
I’m not sure I see what you’re talking about. Picture?
15m time frame is strictly for a high liquidity scalping situation. Btc really isn’t something you want to scalp, I mean some do but the liquidity is an issue and most people swing trade. Second a h&s is a longer time frame formation that also needs volume to confirm. Next you are writing about a 15m time frame but using the 21D ema as justification, you need to use the same time frame when discussing. What support lines have we just passed that you referenced?  What do you think the r/r is that you think would justify your trade. Last use charts to reference everything if you’re giving TA. 

Take everything I say with a grain of salt I am just a lurker. I don’t post charts, opinion or public trades here. I am still relatively new to crypto and mostly trade stock but what your doing is a no no in most forms. Basically you are throwing a bunch of jargon up with no actual meaning. 

Edit: while I’m at it I should finish my thought. This is also not to mention this is dumb point to enter the market if you’re already out of position. We have a confluence of moving averages on the 4 hour time frame that are starting to bunch up and long is on the wrong side of it, we keep bouncing off the 21EMA in this time frame. The BB are getting super tight which usually precedes a break but it isn’t looking to be in the bulls favor. The smart money would sit on their hands if out of position for now and wait for confirmation on the break to enter. 
Dude you've been long for like 5 mins...
Meh, keeping the short so I can buy your discounted coins later when you sell
Stay silent mr 100x long
No one is tracking you bucky, you're fine. The position bot is something people use to track their trades publicly. All of it is voluntary - it's not tracking you! 
Nooo you can't leave :( you are our bullish mascot :(
What happened? What’s your reasoning for this?
Drama 
Are you saying that the average American is 60% poorer? What a load of crap in one message. 
The economy has been fantastic for like half a decade, what are you even talking about? Sure there's probably going to be another credit bubble in the 20's but we are not living in a recession right now.
Or we’re consolidating for a big move.
10x leverage is like investing in government bonds. Use at least 50x.
Time to go short my friends :)
>  the one who lost 25% of my stack in a few days, i have try my hand on bitmex

Those are not so compatible, I suggest you stop using bitmex until you traded it back normallyl..
They have a test net. Please,for your own sake, use the test net until you are comfortable in all of their options. Crypto won't run away in the next years, you have plenty of time to make your losses back.
Revenge trading moved to exchange that allows up to 100x leverage. Yeah, that will end well...
Do not use 10x leverage. Use 1x, 2x.

Almost everyone in here who started out margin trading on BitMex will have done the exact same thing - start with high leverage trying to make big money quickly, get rekt multiple times, start to reduce leverage and then start to see actual profits.

Theres a reason the long time posters in here seem to use lower leverage than the newbies...


I'm not a "master trader", but why would you go long here? What's your reasoning?
i have closed my position around 6520, my liq price increase suddenly from 5.9k to 6.4k and my roe increase to 10%... so i close the position. still have no idea what happened there...
Are you asking how to make back that 1%? It sounds to me like you plan on holding instead of trading? When to re-enter? 

Wait for a red day that's pretty bloody. Since you can't trade  in July because no access to a computer I don't suggest you enter in a short or long if you can't check on it. 

And if no opportunities present itself before you leave I'd still probably buy in for long term. But this is a trading subreddit so I'm not sure why you posted here when it's your first time trading in more than a year.
Learn risk management.
Seriously... 1%? I wouldn’t lose sleep over it mate. Take ur losses like a man & come back when you’ve lost your house, your girl, your job and your dog like half the moon kids on /CC. 1st round of beers on me then.
I know we call them Barts but the last couple of days seem much more organic.  


Don't laugh at me, I look at the 15 minutes from time to time.

Uhm, what? :)
Profitability on "majority of trades" doesn't make any sense to measure. There's some interesting statistics at: [https://www.anotherbot.info](https://www.anotherbot.info)

It's quite common to only have 40&#37; success rate, but those are highly profitable trades. And the other 60&#37; are unsuccessful trades with good risk management, meaning very very small losses.
and in return, I will send you 400 ETH!
I'm going to try and guess the scenario here, these past few months you've probably lost a portion of your stack/fiat, came on here and saw people posting stuff about successful trades, and in your own mind you are saying "that's bullshit, I've lost so much, there is no way people are doing well in this environment" so you post this comment.
Successful traders don't need your 4 Eth...
What proof do you want? 
[deleted]
Firstly, I don’t believe you’ll send the 4 ETH... and if I’m wrong and you’re being sincere ... please don’t send the 4 ETH.  There is no possible way for you to verify people’s track record through screen shots, personal testimony or anecdotal evidence. 

You’d need a 3rd party auditor or accountant to verify transactions and no individual trader has someone like this ... 
( I'm Crazy But ) It's getting more Crazy Here!!!..

Sure... LoL.
I was going to remove this, but I couldn't understand what you were trying to say. Maybe edit it into a cohesive thought?
They added Dent, not Dentacoin.


Dent (DENT) actually isn’t all that bad, (but I don’t know a huge amount about it, it seems alright though).


Dentacoin (DCN) is the dentist one that is basically a joke with how dumb it is.
Posts like this make me think that it is time to stop reading this sub as often as I do. 
That would be unusual for Bitcoin 
Yeah, short term I'm getting mixed indicators considering alts have been declining for days now and the short/long ratio indicates more room for downside. However, bitmex seems to be at about at parity, and typically bitcoin trends hard before it reverses and I still believe we are in the middle of a short-term bullish cycle (for the next few weeks).

Trading counter to Bitmex funding fees is typically profitable though, at least eventually if you're on low leverage.
Do you mean accumulating? Consolidation just means a period of indecision where trading happens in a small price range for an extended period of time before it swings one way or another. Accumulation or distribution could be happening here, and I think everyone here is just trying to figure out which it is.
Maybe because the price is too low to distribute? Usually the distribution time happen near the top, not near the 6 months bottom like this. Not likely.

1. I just found the website a few weeks ago, like many of these websites, I can't say with 100% certainty it is legitimate (I don't run it). 


2. No I said that "it is apparent that every time we break above the midline, we see a short-term bull movement" which we are still above. I was referring to the 20-Day MA. I also still think it is bullish until we drop below the 20-Day MA. 



Come at my analysis or whatever but I can legitimately say I'd never try to deceive people here. That's fucked. 
Dude chill out, it was an honest mistake. I went back and put in strikethroughs. Didn't mean for this website to turn into some huge debate, fuck. 
You probably don't need the /s. Its likely been banned and unbanned several times today.
its every other day
Yeah,this is a looooong wick :/.
h&s are reversal patterns. In this case you would need an iH&S to signal a trend change.
Yeah I expect that fakeout might happen. Good luck mate :)
Solid response! Thanks for the insight!
People need to stop spreading this myth. The Gox coins were stolen and sold off in 2011-2012. It was hidden from the public until 2014.
IF you want to revenge trade, do it with a very downsized position. Let's say you did 1 BTC long, do now a maximum 0.1-.15 BTC short to try your strategy and get the nice feeling of being right, but limiting the financial risk
Way to go bro! This is a very mature attitude and i wish I could’ve control my feelings like that. It’s very easy to give an advice but it’s very hard for me to follow my own when emotions take control. Tons of respect from here
Keep in mind the overwhelming majority of people are net negative if they try to trading in the long term.

If you believe in Bitcoin long-term you're buying at 70% off the high. If you want to see if you can make it trading you might want to consider just paper trading until you start really getting a feel for it. As the guy above pointed out you literally traded that backwards

> It's not just you this game feels rigged right now.

And yet it is playing out exactly as I thought it would.   


Check my post from the other day. I described the current market action and it's playing out as I said thus far. 
there is a bit of "confusion". more info

https://twitter.com/OscarWGrut/status/1015235294038315009

"I've just heard this from the press rep: "The exact functions are yet to be clarified but we have been told that it is going to be a platform that will serve as both a cryptocurrency and securities token exchange over time.""
Not h&s just forming a swing high, indicating that market will take a fall. And the 5700 was my original entry that I recently exited. Looking around 6100 now for longs and on a 1x short to lock in my fiat value. 
Fiat meaning Forex ? That's a really difficult Market. That eurotrade recently ran in so many people. The bond market is behaving wonky. I mean with full unemployment it's pretty likely the FED is going to stay on schedule and we have the 10-year selling off . that caught a ton of people off guard. If you have pulled 50% in the past 6 months that is absolutely Stellar for Bitcoin. Were you selling rallies?
I'm not. That's kind of crazy that two people asked the same question on the same day though. I would probably think that was suspect as well
So I just caught on to what I think you guys mean by down on Fiat up in Bitcoin. You mean you have more optional Bitcoin but your dollar amount in USD or EUR is down. I would be in the exact same boat trading and the only reason I'm up on Fiat is because of mining. I was thinking down on Fiat meant you made bad Forex trades when I was talking to the other guy
What's alts do you have your eye on now?
I wasn't watching live during the spike to $6,800. 

Had I been, I probably would have exited then. 

Like I said in my edit, the market is indecisive, and it's not very worthwhile to speculate until a clearer direction presents itself. 
That jump made me nervous, so I opted to exit around breakeven. 

I'd been thinking about it all day yesterday and all this morning as well. 

The market had ample opportunity to drop, but sellers just couldn't get it done. 
[the network hashrate grew almost 7x in 1 year](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate?timespan=1year), if you watch the growth on that chart, I would assume all hardware bought before 6 months already made a ROI. 
even if as a hobby miner you buy an Antminer S9 today ([the retail price for 1 unit is $608](https://shop.bitmain.com/product/detail?pid=000201806281743005275bf20LAJ062E), big farms get way better deals) [you would still be profitable at $0.10 kWh](https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/calculator/btc?HashingPower=14&HashingUnit=TH%2Fs&PowerConsumption=1300&CostPerkWh=0.10&MiningPoolFee=1), break-even would be longer though.

No one mines Bitcoin at home, so I am just assuming the worst case scenarios.
Out of the top 100 coins by market cap only 12 are up against BTC in the last 24 hours. 1 of those is Tether. Only one coin is up over 5% on BTC in the last 24 hours.
It really wouldn't. It would be a lower high and in the declining channel we have been forming all year. 

What I would like to see is different behavior. Get on the right side of the 200. Take a crack at 11 7. At least get the market moving horizontal. If we go to 7800 and fall again all eyes are going to be on the bottom. Are we going to hold at the same place or possibly slightly higher or are we going to chip away at a multi-prong bottom going down a few hundred more dollars each time it happens. 

Personally I really don't get the downside because of the news overall is really bullish. What's bearish are the people. The prevailing thought with a lot of comments I hear is that no one wants to be the first guy in. Everyone is scared and thinks it's going lower so the buying power is for the most part sitting on the sidelines. Get people fired up and get the market in the northern hemisphere and I bet we're going to see a lot of money flow in. Definitely would like to see you an established support Channel above the $6,000 range we have been playing in all year
Thanks! I'll pop in once in awhile. Not actively trading though.
people forget that the mt gox hack, where 850k BTC and 450mill$ in value was lost.

Happened in February 2014 
2014 wasn’t that scary. I was still up like 20x at least.

I think it all comes down to where you bought. Obv if you bought at sub 1k, then this is a walk in the prk

Just like buying sub 10 was a walk in the park for 2014ers
I hope so buddy, I'm short :)

Yes... if price is going to make a run for it... it'll happen here in the next 24-48. 

edit: post-BGD, I'm looking at 4/12 - 4/19
Bitcoin's issuance is **capped at 21 million coins** (this is written into the code and consensus rules that governs the creation of valid blocks on a singular chain). That's the hard cap on supply. **Right now there are about 17.1 million** coins in existence (some portion of these are lost or destroyed [maybe 15%-25%?]). 

The **bitcoin issuance halves every four years**, though **technically it halves every 210,000 *blocks***. If these blocks get mined every 10 minutes on average, with minimal variance, then 210,000 = ~4 years. The next block reward halvening is in 2020 and reduces the mining reward from 12.5 to 6.25. This slowly tapers off until a certain block height (not sure of the exact number), after which no new coins are ever created. This will be around year 2150. 

However, my point is that inflation after 2030 or so is so negligible that it needn't even be called inflation. The last 1 million coins or so will be mined between 2030 and 2150 and the trickle will slowly decrease.

Do you mean the bar patterns?  I'm overlaying the run up in April/May and then constraining the price to match the current volatility (lower than in April).  Currently they are similar in terms of price/RSI.  Charts are full of repeating patterns and so I'm measuring this current uptick against the one in April... it doesn't mean it'll play out... but it's interesting to compare. 
Yup... moving stops on my $6460 long to break even and letting this one ride

He actually gave several reasons in his previous post
I know, right? 

It looked too ridiculous not to share haha.
Seriously though. I remember when I heard the “HODL gang” song and immediately realized that it was a mantra that 17 year old kids were living by haha.
True, but there have been a handful of occasions during this bear market when ETH lead a dump. 

I wouldn't personally consider ETH a low value alt though. It's second by market cap at nearly $50m.
Away from the comp at the moment but I think it's a CCMI.. When I'm back at the desk Monday I'll send you the actual name! 
That makes sense, although would require a much harder commitment than the fork contention and wildly differing difficulty levels of late 2017. 

Although if LN was working and seeing a high enough rate of adoption, the key selling point of BCH (more on-chain txs) would be moot, no?
>LN seems about as popular as sitting on a cactus 

Oh yeah? Time to get out of the echo-chamber buddy.
People can already use it, especially to send large value payments like house purchases.

Lightning doesn't introduce any additional counterparty risk, so doesn't increase centralization in that way, but does arguably introduce censorship risk. But if the network topology ends up being scale free, this should be insignificant.

If the network topology ends up being star and hub, this probably looks a bit more like what you're suggesting is a preferable alternative - with more centralized payment hubs with correspondingly higher (but still nowhere near absolute) censorship power
Yes, I realised how overpriced the Bitmex options are. The Deribit options seem way more reasonably priced.

But I don’t agree that setting SL is necessarily wiser. It’s a completely different risk profile. With a SL you can get “stopped out” and market can still turn against you.

With options you take way more calculated risks. You know the fixed cost, and you have a potential upside.
You have an analytical mind instead of just accepting things as presented to you. Must be a math major

Welcome aboard, Greg!
It means that the average price in the last 10 days was higher than the average of the last 20 days. This has typically been a bullish indicator for the BTCUSD pairing (downside slowing down, and ramping up for a bullish movement), go have a look at historic charts. This isn't the only indicator I use, but works well for opening longs.
Its the candle paradox. On one hand candles are an important sumarization tool so that you don't have to scroll through the thousands of individual transactions that happened all day.

On the other had is establishes some artificial start and end points because... well we have to be able to draw the candle.

On "legacy" markets the close is important because there is an actual close of the sock exchange, so certain strategies used than discontinuity to their advantage. Some traders look for such movements do discern intentions of bigger market players.

On "crypto" with 24h markets the close is virtual. Despite this, you need some kind of decision trigger to enter or exit the market. A candle close is as good as any other trigger. The daily candle close just so happens to be a favorite for humans and bots alike.
It's only as important as the fraction of the market that thinks it's important.

In reality, dynamic offsets are your friend.
There is nothing scientific about it. People find indicators for trades they want to make. 
I sort of agree with you, but there's something to be said for discipline and patience. He has a strategy and some indicators he's looking at. 

Discipline pays.
It's arbitrary. But it comes down to laziness mainly and my own strategy... I don't really care about intraday movements so much because I don't want to always be looking at price and charts, I just want to open and close trades and make sure that I am buying in at the right time.

I use several indicators on the daily charts (10&20 MA crossover, MACD and 2 others) to decide whether it makes sense to open or close a long position. Right now things are looking good to open a position if there is this cross-over, given my risk tolerance. 

Sometimes you get a good trade, sometimes you lose some money, but overall you make money.
Thank you for saying what I have been thinking for a while now. I'm VERY new at trading, but not so new @ crypto. The trading never stops and starts at a specific time. Someone is waking up somewhere every hour and checking the exchange!
The close prices being arbitrary in a 24/7 market doesn't mean you can disregard them as unimportant. One doesn't imply the other. Most charting is done in the UTC timezone and many indicators are calculated on the close price. For example, anytime someone mentions a daily RSI value/divergence or a MACD cross, it is entirely based on the UTC daily close price and nothing else. Close price is *arbitrary and important*, similar to how someone's 18th birthday is.
I think this bearish div is more obvious

FUD
Thanks, I appreciate all these answers. I'm ashamed to go into too much detail, but I fomoed into one of the alts three days ago. Alt is tanking and I'm looking at about 15% loss. (Edit: Shortened.)  

Looking for a chance to get out, maybe at a 15% loss. Otherwise, I expect the market to turn up within a few months, so I could just wait it out. My current intention is something in between: To sell about a third, and use that to trade for the next few months. I'm pretty confident that the cryptomarket will go up for another wave at least by the end of the year. 

Edit: Yes, I'm interested in reading material about risk management. That would be great.
That's definitely something to think about. Now I have seen some proponents of the "HODL" strategy raising counter-arguments to that, but it seems that from a pure trading viewpoint the need to free up capital is more important than anticipated future price targets. 

When I got caught underwater I had one extra chance to get out at a relatively low loss (two days ago I could have cut my losses by two thirds), but I assumed that we on a roll and I would just let it ride.

After 7 years of watching charts and correlating almost a decades worth of data its basically just my ass talking. I love reading TA around here though it's very interesting and entertaining but when those BGDs pop up and start going parabolic I don't want to miss the train. As a longterm holder that would be devastating.
FOMO hits fast.
Retail investors - I meant Joe schmoe buying bitcoin to invest..not retail transactions. However, I'm missing those as well 
Oh another site that takes crypto? Crap I’m not gonna have any BTC left! 
> There is plenty of value in the tech

What do you mean? Be specific.

When I see articles online that are talking about "the value of blockchain", they're mostly talking about Ethereum.
Legitimate question: why spend so much time in here shitposting? What do you get out of it? I'd think the thrill of lame trolling would get old quick. 

The fact that you literally think this is the best use of your precious, limited time on earth is actually depressing. Hope things improve in your life soon. 
Pokemon is the highest grossing franchise hardly a 90s fad..
I show 6784 2 days ago.  June 10th was 6899 which is the reference point I was referring to.  
However more recently on the 19th we were just above 6800 in that range. 
I will edit my initial comment to reflect the 6900 marker that I was trying to more heavily emphasize. 
I’m neutral but my guess is randomly cutting wicks 
Why... are we negative?. 
Look at longer term instead daily in out
>based on average electricity costs

The average would include *all* consumer electricity rates of the country. Miners don't pay anything near these rates. Plus China makes the hardware. I'm yet to see a sensible quote for mining costs.
Well, when the price was $1k then network hashrate was probably 5-10% if what it currently.
Or you could google the answer and get something closer to accurate rather than making up numbers that are incorrect.
I shouldn't have to invest in some BS stock/ company or "productive investment" to not have my capital lose value. If people invest because they have to to not lose value, not because they believe in the business model of said _stock_ _treasury_ or whatever shitbond they are encouraged to buy, the resultant economy is a sham.
Really? So saving is no longer a virtue? It's certainly a losing proposition now because the dollars you keep in a Monopoly bank become more and more worthless over time. Money in the bank = dumbest money there is.

Sorry, but some of us are prudent and don't spend every dime. It's funny because the money I use to buy Bitcoin is pretty much money that would be sitting in a savings account losing value otherwise. Yes, I invest in stocks, bonds and real estate. No, none of these has given me 1/10 the returns Bitcoin has over time.

Oh, and by the way: I spend Bitcoin too. Recently took a vacation that cost one whole Bitcoin... that I bought a few years ago for ~$250. Yes, I paid for flight and accommodations in Bitcoin.

I hope everyone figures this out and pulls their savings out of the scam banks before they collapse again because there won't be a bailout for those slimy fuckers next time.
Your not supposed to hold your money? What kinda YOLO mindset is that?  Any currency that's lost 60% of it's buying power is no better than a train going full speed off the tracks. 

Your the conductor of that train telling everyone YOLO and keep calm right before they go flying off a cliff. Get back to printing more magic money and calling it "quanitive easing." I'm on to you. -_-
> BTC is deflationary for now 

Objectively false, bitcoin is currently inflating more than the USD.  New coins are printed every 10 minutes.
In the grand scheme of things BTC is deflationary, I was not referencing the amount of newly mined coins at this moment. I am quite aware that when you look at the schema of BTC you have early dilution of the existing pool of mined coins by newly mined coins and that monthly dilution drops over time, yes, it is inflationary in that sense, however over time the reward rate drops until eventually all coins are mined. Over time it is a deflationary project. That is, of course, the opposite of cash which has newly minted amounts printed all the time. 
Agreed. They still our tech. They’re building their military up to take over the world. Their people are slaves with no freedom under an ever intrusive eye of the commies. Yes. Fuck China where they breath. 

That’s a bit of a harsh way of saying it, but yeah. I don’t find it very tradeable. Phil with Pro_Indicators is my favorite EW trader on TV, and his general sentiment is still typically correct, but his targets are almost always wrong. I find that he often over-predicts targets and ignores significant support/resistance levels. You really have to use low leverage (<3x) to trade EW and be willing to cut on big losses imo or you’re gonna get yourself rekt quick.
You have a way with words Gypsy.

I generally agree on the 15 minutes timeframes, but it can also be used for finding good entry point. E.g. you decide you want to go long after looking at 1d and then place your limit based on the action you see on 1h, but yeah 15 minutes is prety low. Then again I've decided to go long based on 1d and 4h charts and this was just a trigger.
   
I disagree about "mixing" indicators from different timeframes though. When they converge it makes an even better entry. If you have a support on 1 day, 4h and 1h just below the spot that's a great entry imo.   
   
Also that IH&S has played out perfectly.
There can be other bots saving all the comments on these threads and storing them in databases. Even if you delete all your history here they still have it on their side.

What are the reasons behind this behavior i don't know, but i know such bots exist and are running here.
Watch out - THEY track you.

Ciao
Crypto making people loco!
I am not sure what the post said that you were replying to, but the US has seen the slowest post recession growth since WW2, and post recession growth after financial crisis are usually the strongest. 

Until late 2016, the economy has been propped up by extremely easy monitory policy that included artificially lowering long term interest rates. 
RemindMe! 31 Jul 2018
OK, so you go Short at these levels.???
i am just testing a small amount that i am willing to lose
And then go to x10 leverage and get rich
ok thanks for the tips~ will test it out
no reason just a gut feeling lol
I'd just like confirmation on "revenge trading is Mkay" haha, Its a 1% loss, but I was trading with smaller amounts, so the bad trades compounded, and viola, here I am. 

--- I mean, I've traded in the last year, *but* I haven't actively day-traded to gain on my position** , Rather just taken positions on different coins I like 

Thanks for your advice anyway. 
Do we call them Barts because they look like Bart Simpson's hair?
Ok let me rephrase. If someone can provide proof that they have made more money than they started with 6 months ago consistently trading they win the prize. 
Great... I'm not in the list

SLoppy... ??? You are?
Nice
I can see why you’d think that but no. I traded a little and didn’t really lose or make money and have since held mostly BTC for the past 4 months. I read this sub all the time though because the quality of comments is higher than other crypto subs. What strikes me though is people constantly providing contradictory evidence for why they chose their position. I’ve seen a lot of regular posters here give trading advice or post positions that turned out to be very very bad decisions. I am honestly very curious to see if anyone in this community can provide proof that they make consistent money doing this, not just like one big trade. It really does seem like a lot of people staring at screens making 10 trades a day and breaking even after fees to me but please someone prove me wrong. 
Mostly just doing this to see if anyone can provide proof that they know what they’re doing 
Idk, a list of successful trades in the form of a screenshot with dates
Why do you believe it without proof
I think he's saying binance added dente coin to their exchange. This causes him to believe crypto is a giant joke. 
> I was today years old

I think it's their birthday?
It was a combination of a meme and a wild disbelief.  The meme was “I was today years old when...” and the wild disbelief was the fact that Dent has been the gauge for how speculatory is the market and that shit is mainstream now.
Wtf is the difference
It has been for the past weeks
exactly. 
"too low" is relative, distributing at 66xx is much better than distributing at 58xx, and so on. 
6 months bottom is all relative, is it 6 mos bottom or is it 6 mos out of 8 mos, 10 mos, 24 mos?
I edited the part about the BBands, I thought you'd said the upper band was breached.

The website looks sketchy and doesn't provide any sort of information on the data set they're using. And they repeatedly beg you to make a username and sign up and presumably pay them money. Plus, the writing and design is unprofessional. Looks scammy af and the line is probably false. Your comment sort of reads like "This is super important guys" and then you link to that website. Seems a little uh...
I don't see how you can think that site looks reputable at all. It looks just like a typical scam/cryptoscam website that wants you to 'sign up' for some "secret to success". Anything that is instantly trying to sell you a product without any sort of good-faith inbound content is likely a deception. 

Don't be so naive, brother. No offense. 
Yes, the overall market is still in a bear market, but the short term trend is up right? 
Thats never been confirmed, at least not that I've ever been able to tell. Do you have a source for this?
I think that’s my current trading issue, I tend to justify my positions by going deeper short or long rather than mitigate risk. I think I’m too emotional/hot headed for the quick trade game. I’ll have take colder decisions. 
https://vlipsy.com/vlip/7th-heaven-im-getting-revenge-Ok7g3RFP
I was doing really well up until earlier this week. Took a break.
It is a h&s though? Your plan is very similar to mine, nice analysis.
Errrr no, not fiat as forex. Fiat as USD. I was saying how most people, if they hold, are down in USD this year. However I'm up in BTC since December from trading (though I am not a professional - just do it for fun). I imagine it's the same for a lot of people.

Edit: to answer your strategy question, I mostly take out margin longs when everyone here is whining and shorts when everyone here is celebrating.
Haha no worries just curious if it's your alt. only asked cause you basically phrased it the same exact way 
Yes. Not taking my ontology trades into account, i have more btc now than when year began, but the fiat value of this amount is less than the lesser amount of the btc i had when the year began.
Read your edit after you posted.

Seeing myself how I try to find a position in this range I'm not really surprised that you exited.
I know many here, look at BTCUSDLONGS/SHORTS

But what do you think about the ETHUSDSHORTS/ETHUSDLONGS ratio moving closer to 1:1 as opposed to 0.7:1 from a few days ago. The ratio did something similar too during the weeks of June 8th and June 18th before our drops as well.

 Additionally do you think the price action is different then June 2-8?  

Edit: u/SloppySynapses maybe you might have some more insight in this? 
> I'd been thinking about it all day yesterday and all this morning as well.


This has been one of my primary indicators; whatever I'm (absent mindedly) thinking about is what I need to do/investigate. Has this been your experience?
If we go below $6500 will you short?
Thx
You aren't working off the same chart as me, best of luck
Good time to hold imo, or sit on a small long just for something to look at. 
There wasn’t one hack. The whole thing was insolvent and insecure by design.

Go watch the Wiz Sec presentation at Breaking Bitcoin Paris on Youtube.

Mt Gox halted wothdrawals in Feb 2014, there was no hack in 2014 as far as I remember, but I could be wrong
I meant more in lines of uncertainty... in 2014 it wasn’t clear if Bitcoin would go mainstream, or die as a niche market, or if Willy bot was really the only reason it ever hit $1000. Now bitcoin has cemented its position as an asset class that isn’t going away 


Btw— if you were up 20X in 2014 why the fuck do you need a job right now? 😭 

Nailed it 
Thank you so much for the detailed clarification.
How do you see the risk / reward ratio for this one? 
Nah, that was just foreplay. 

>I wouldn't personally consider ETH a low value alt though. It's second by market cap at nearly $50m.

You're missing a few zeroes. The market cap of ethereum is closer to $50 *billion*. 
ETH is second. OK. I mean other ALTS
Thanks Richy!
I'm not in one at all, the only people I see excited about LN are hardcore BTC maximalists and there really aren't that many of them.  Most of the people I meet in crypto want the direct peer to peer aspect of bitcoin.
The deribit options are not "reasonably" priced. The deribit options are "market" priced. They are real prices and at good volume imply "implied" volatility.
I know what you mean but in order for the option to be better than longing now with SL < 5%, it basically has to drop more than 5% as a fakeout and then go above 6750. The trajectory seems a bit too specific to justify the price
Can confirm, don't remember why but had him tagged with "rolling safe" in green, the rarest and most valuable of tags.
Please link me to this sock exchange. I have many odd socks which I can't find the pair for.
You all get upvotes for these replies. I needed that today :)
a pair of socks for cyptoe
Good point actually, is there a way to do those dynamic offsets on TradingView? 
I see, I think that already played out.
Why do you think the market is going to turn up in a couple of months?
that's not why. no one, not even tether haters care if you  *use* tether. they just think you'll be fucked eventually. he was downvoted because he sold
Why would a trading sub hate Tether? 

As a trader you can only secure profit through traditional USD, Tether, or short BitMEX futures to stay in synthetic USD... 
Not really, look at the upvotes now. You can't jump to conclusions with a post that's only some minutes old, let it sit for a while.
Its been like that for a long time.  
Possibly. I’m just pointing out that those with exchange coins have more a vested interest to do so. Hard for me to tell if all exchanges are wash trading. Btc flowing into altcoin market has increased greatly, and I’m not sure how much is wash trading vs retail and VC interest in new altcoin projects. 
Even if they were right, it's still a total waste of time. It's like going to r/vegan and talking about how much you love bacon. Nobody cares.  
I am interested in knowing your source for the claim "Pokemon is the highest grossing franchise"
Ahhh, sorry my bad. I did not check high volume markets. I definitely remember that we jumped above 6,800 in bitmex though.
I cut that first wick since it was the first reaction low. Usually more violent and tend to penetrate through support and close above in most cases. It's not too far off though in my opinion. 
[https://www.tradingview.com/x/bE1CCmuf/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/bE1CCmuf/)

Here you go, no wicks being cut down :)
The link above asked "experts" in the energy field who claimed bitcoin was nearly at break even.  The price has since halved since the article came out.  Good job, sounds legit.  Great google searching.
>I shouldn't have to invest in some BS stock/ company or "productive investment"

Coming from a bitcoiner... Top jej.
> I shouldn't have to invest in some BS stock/ company 

The economy doesn't operate on your feelings, tough it up snow flake.

> the resultant economy is a sham.

Poverty levels across every country in the world over the last 100 years disagree with you.
> Recently took a vacation that cost one whole Bitcoin

Hopefully not through Expedia.  They stopped accepting bitcoin along with most other major companies over the last year.  You might have to trade your next bitcoin for cash in a men's restroom next year before buying that vacation...
You tell 'em, man! Fuck this compulsory consumerism. 
BTC inflation is currently at about 4.2% per year.
If there are better and less subjective alternatives that get you to the same place, you're probably better off using those. Maybe I just don't know enough about Elliot Waves, but from what I gather it's not all that different from a Rorschach test.  
Ah gotcha. Its a nasty game, but don't downvote a dude for being indecisive.
I read the article an hour earlier.
You didn’t phrase your comment like it was about an entry. You phrased it like that was the justification for your trade. 

Your mixing of time frames never mentioned a confluence of moving averages on multiple time frames. It seems you are looking to rebut my statements and justify what you said. 

The h&s can play out sure I didn’t say I couldn’t. I said that you normally don’t use that formation on that time frame because that would be more about random chance.  One trades on historical consistency over time and that isn’t what you’re doing. You’re looking for justification to go long. 

None of this really matters though your asking why people downvoted you. I personally didn’t I was just trying to help you out with an answer. It seems after your last response you weren’t really looking for an answer you are looking for an adversary. 


This is the case for all of reddit! It's to be able to see old edits/deleted comments. I made my own version of this a while back for fun! It's really useful to see comments that have been edited/deleted
Make sure you collect your complimentary tin-foil hat on the way out!
Who is tracking? What is going on?
Ahhh, sorry. You are the one who needs /s at the end of the sentence to understand the joke.
Well, nevertheless real money is real money.. good luck to you! 
That's probably why you lost 25% of your stack 
Sorry dude you are posting in wrong sub and against sub rules...This sub is 90% talking only about BTC not other coins or tokens. There's one thread where they allow that. 

Revenge trading is ok if you think the price is going to go up. Each trade is new and independent on your past. You are sounding a lot like an addicted gambler at a casino instead of a trader. "I'm down this much so I gotta double down and go big"...Good luck but people like you I'd suggest holding. Too emotionally attached to trade without thinking of the past.
yes. And head.

Yup haha

It's crypto only as well because it's the way Bitcoin has been moving for about a year now
That would require a near audit of all of the exchanges they're on. I've used Gdax and bitmex but if I just showed you bitmex my profits would be higher since I made net losses on GDAX because I used it mainly when I started trading. 

Anyway are you actually looking for this? or are you just shit posting

I've basically made two trades on btc in the past 4 months though. so I probably don't qualify for "frequent trades" which I agree that  most people will fail miserably in the long run with 

You can see my eth and ltc ratio shorts on the position bot too
Do you honestly think there are no people that have made money in the past 6 months?
The list on the front page are traders with open positions only.
I feel like the position bot is your best bet, otherwise, I'd just take people's names down and link their post history to call them out on this stuff.


Check inbox, i send you some graphs
cuz i have been profitable myself
How does one become today's years old, though? What does that have to do with an arbitrarily observed shitcoin?
I think this is a special feature that's unique to his ICO.
What is a "today's years old?"
The only similarity is the name really.
DENT has a working product being used and has apps on the app stores. Something to do with sharing your unused mobile data allowance with others. It's one of the shitcoins that is actually pretty feasible. 
Gotcha. You do make a good point. Like I said, I just was going through my tools and came upon that coincidence regarding the same % "market bought" at approximately the same price and wanted to put it here. For what it is worth, I do give it value.  
A H&S would mean that the price would fall from the shoulders line an amount corresponding to the head height, so it's a bearish pattern.


You could be right, I'm not sure my source.

But all the coins were stollen mostly in 2011. Btc-e was founded in 2011 and at least 500,000 stolen BTC went through one of the admins accounts on Gox and btc-e.
Usually also if you are too emotional, you are probably overinvested , since emotions are irrational fears or hope for something to happen. If you trade with let's say 10 dollars that LITERALLY doesn't mean anything at all to you, you will not  care about what happens. Read this nice book about emotions and hormones in trading

r/ReactionClips
technically not h&s till pattern completes, but yeah all the ingredients are there for one
Lol as much as that is making me laugh it is absolutely the winning strategy this year. It's literally the 2017 equivalent of buy the dips
I think u got it the other way around:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/y3aDQoLo/

The ETHUSDSHORTS/ETHUSDLONGS ratio increased after the drop, not before. (I have indicated the point right before the drop in blue dotted line)

Not sure what to make of it since the ratio is already close to 1. Maybe not so meaningful
I'll wait for a lower local low below $6,400 most likely. 
[removed]
yeah they were compromised for along time before.

But you are 100% right that is when everyone found out

Then gox was liquidated in April if i remember right  
hahaha, I like to work
2013 = willybot mtgox  fake money

2017 = tether bitfinex fake money

the big difference is mtgox fake money stayed on mtgox, whereas bitfinex fake money was spread all over the entire cryptomarkers on countless exchanges.

they basically created their own federal reserve, people wising up slowly now that tether is under criminal investigation by US department of justice

remember that friedman llp was also sent cftc subpoenas and the university of texas didnt investigate tether just because of some asshole on twitter 
Yea now we have concrete analysis that willy bot was responsible for that price rise.  Just like once Tether collapses we'll have proof that fraud was responsible for this latest rise.  

> Now bitcoin has cemented its position as an asset class that isn’t going away 

Yup, right there with fidget spinners.
This is one reason why the 2013 bull run was so much crazier than 2017. Not only was the run-up massive over a short period of time, it also occurred when **inflation was a whopping 30%**. Tons of additional coins were being mined each day but buyers and hodlers weren't fucking around.
Lightning is still P2P payments, in some cases direct, in some cases routed.

Would you call Tor non-P2P? What about Firechat?
LN is peer to peer.
Hmm, I don't see any tags. What/where is it? Is it like that trophy that /u/ibankbtc has?

What does "rolling safe" mean?
But does the sock exchange have feet pairs or just cryptoe pairs?

EDIT: Better
I giggled like a girl. Still am. 
Lol. That reply made me to leave in all the typos of my post.
Yeah that's possible too. But, just looking at the overall context, I don't think the last pump was so convincing

At the very least, I think we can break 6800 after dropping a bit and gaining momentum
From taking in as much of others' analysis as I can and trying to see what makes sense. I also assume that the wave form (2-3 months wavelength) will continue at least for one more iteration. 

Edit: What do you think? 
Because they did not have official audit and still a bit shady. I personally don't mind tether if you don't hold 100% of your assets in it. 
Exactly. At first I was just annoyed, but then when I thought about someone sitting at a computer, selecting a subreddit they dislike, and spending hours attempting to taunt and bait random strangers, the image became very sad. What a life. 
Well if you thought people were wasting their lives being vegan and that it was a scam/waste of money then it makes a little more sense. 
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_highest-grossing_media_franchises
No worries at all, I don't often think about checking in with Bitmex. I do most of my charting off of USD - Bitfinex or USDT - Binance
Thanks for the comment though got me to rework my initial comment to be more precise.
I didn't post the link you jackass. But if you knew anything about it, I am sure you would have typed it. Go read about hashrate, difficulty adjusting and something else useful, if you want to comment. 

Also, how has the price halved since the article dated May 11?
I'd say it is a little different, at least. After price broke out of the bottom range in the end of 2015, the EW crowd was *ecstatic* and many of them [called 10k](https://ip.bitcointalk.org/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fpp.vk.me%2Fc638319%2Fv638319561%2F3c3a%2FIsLkNUA7z8g.jpg&t=590&c=vtB4WJU-BhW7kA) before the former ATH was even broken. Have a look at the old bitcointalk threads by [chessnut](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=812637.0) and [masterluc](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=274613.0). After 200 pages of his thread masterluc stopped posting in November 2015 saying the [historical third wave](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=274613.msg12886887#msg12886887) started and went all-in around $500. Some EW analysts have made spectacularly good long-term calls. Nothing to trade off in the short-term or on high leverage, but I wouldn't dismiss it entirely for being non-technical. The structure of macro cycles is partly based on mass psychology and human minds tend to be rather messy.
Lol you must be new, you'll come to know u/diydude over time 
If you look at  [u/diydude](https://www.reddit.com/u/diydude) comment history you will see he deserves rudeness in return...
Sorry if you've got that impression, which wasn't my intent. I agree with most of what you said apart from the part of not using multiple time frames for analysis. I will try to phrase my comments better in the future. Thanks for the feedback.
I agree with you, its all over reddit. The information itself is neutral, the people using it make it good or bad depending on their motivation. 
Bucky is freaking out because he doesn't understand Positionbot.

Bucky, Positionbot is updated only by the person who wants to make their trades public knowledge, and only keeps records of those trades. There is no "they".
I'm a simple guy. 
I can relate to some of what your saying. I definitely think this is the wrong time for me to be trading. I've had near catastrophes in the past, and thankfully I took a month off & got myself into a better position from there on out. This sorta feels like that again for me, but nowhere near as bad in reality.  

** I came here for advice on how I should treat this situation (as you say I sound like a gambler).. and I'm not normally like this...
Damn I just realized the double meaning of eat my shorts when the Bart finishes 
I am actually looking for this. I would love to find someone on this sub who regularly posts their positions that can validate their trades with a history of success. 
I think there is a high probability that the people constantly posting in this sub making frequent trades have lost money. I’m sure there are people that got lucky with a massive short from 20k. 
Did you ask all the names on the list to make this public???
That’s a ton of work that I’d rather not do. If someone has their trading records and thinks they can prove me wrong I’d prefer that
Ok prove it
lol @ the mod trolling the troll
I guess it was a drunk observation.

Sorry for the shit post.  I don’t think think this is a big joke.  I should have preceded it with:

Sorry I’m on mobile, but this is what I see now:

The weekly RSI(Binance) is turning positive, and broke above 30,  the daily is at 55 ( which can go either way),   If we want to be presumptive you snould look for the right shoulder of the IH&S to bottom at 6100 ( the conservative bet is 6150; look for a target after completion of 7686...7500 is the safe bet).  
Yeah, that's the confusing part for sure. 
a meme.
It’s the years from today that you are old...

> For what it is worth, I do give it value.

Why? What makes you think that data is accurate? It doesn't describe *anything* about the data set, so far as I can see. 
Yeah, I think I just misunderstood your sentence.

I'm still holding my short from days ago :D
I'm willing to change my mind with some new info but I've looked many times over the years and haven't found anything super convincing. There was a hack in 2011 but from what I've been able to tell the 2014 plummet was separate from that. Until MK tells the full story (which will probably never happen), it's pretty much all conjecture.
That looks like a good book! I'll give it a read!

I think the irrational hope I have is that when I make a calculated discussion, the market will move the way I want. The worse emotions come when I remember I was actually in profit for the position and get cocky on it rather than taking it. For that trade I was up 0.5&#37; at one point. which is my usual close, but I got cocky and was like yessss lets see where this goes and I'll make more. I did not make more. I lost more. That's what screws with me the most!

I think I get cocky in those moments as the profit I'm taking is relatively small profits (usually $30 a trade) which is like you said, doesn't mean as much to me as a three figure sum would so that's why I tend to override sense and leave it :(

I think I need to set hard limits and understand that 5 x 0.5&#37; would be safer to get rather that push for a 2.5&#37;. Its easier said than done! I need a system that forces me to put those limits on when a trade is made I think!
I was more referring to the 12-18 of June and feel like some of it gets lost in the Bart noise, but I feel like what you are referring to are people shorting the big drop (probably a lot of people waiting for the market to make a decision) or people reshorting the mini bounces on the shorter time frames. It also looks like some of these larger bounces correlate somewhat with people closing these shorts as well.

This is just what I've observed so who knows if any of it means anything. I just noticed larger fluctuations in ETHSHORTS/LONGS compared to BTCSHORTS/LONGS
How about a short from here, stops above 6900.  Seems right up your alley.  
we got it
/u/_chewtoy_ Any plans to open a short here,  or soonish?
I'm not trying to argue. Take care
That last line was kind of uncalled for.

Yeah, fidget spinners have CME futures. Check this dullards history:  he’s just a fat chud from suburban IL.  His insulin pump runs on posting.  
Yup, and you’re gonna stay broke regardless 
What is your price predictions for the future? I really believe 1 million in 2021 will definitely will happen. 
It's not a public tag. Through addons like RES ("reddit enhancement suite") it's possible to tag users for yourself.

They said their business is so legally risky auditors won’t touch them.


Still selling tethers like hotcakes though 
For those of you who won't touch Tether because they don't have an audit, TrueUSD is a good alternative.
Haha schooled
but everyone was calling for $10k. literally people who were just guessing...this doesn't really mean a whole lot. $10k was moon for everybody and getting back to $500 was bullish. So idk...You're kinda proving gypsy's point - mainly just a rorschach test 
not exactly new but thanks for the info. 8 year verified account and posts dating back to 2014 in /r/Bitcoin but I don't exactly keep up with the drama here.

Edit: lol typed /r/BTC at first been shitposting there since it was created though
gotcha thanks for the heads up.
Idk if anyone deserves rudeness, I actually like u/diydude , but it doesn't mean he doesn't annoy me.
oh. LOL.
lol love you bucky
Yeah you're fine right now  1% loss is nothing. Many people here lose way more than that on one trade. I'm just saying be careful in the future.
It's hard to verify because you can just alter data in screenshots though. Could export bitmex dep/withdraw/pnl data but like I said you can just alter it. I can maybe show you mine if you want, although the beginning is kind of embarrassing...lol
These are traders that post their positions on this sub using the `!short XXX` or `!long XXX` syntax in their posts. For example, like I did here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8vfq9u/daily\_discussion\_monday\_july\_02\_2018/e1olkdk/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8vfq9u/daily_discussion_monday_july_02_2018/e1olkdk/)
Need to blow off some steam; so many shitposts.
Or 7818 of we take the height of the right shoulder.  But I’m too much of a nance to actually bet money on it so I’d rather just leave my shekles where they lie.
And then when that’s not enough the 7ma just confirmed a cross above the 25 ma for the first time since April 13th (and we all know what happened then)...and it looks like it might curl back down but it also looked like is was curling up before it rode underneath the 25ma for several weeks.

Edit: Spelling.
Whale theory here: Everyone seems to keep trying to buy the dips here, so if I were a whale, I would let this bleed for a bit til people started to get bearish and close their longs/open shorts. Then I would squeeze the price back up either over the weekend on low volume or on Monday when trading volume picks back up and get everyone to FOMO back in. I think a low somewhere between $6100-$6300 would set up for a beautiful IH&S if that plays out as well.

Either way, we’re at the 50 yd line here, and I’m done scalping until some bigger movement happens from here because it looks like we’re coiling up for a bigger move soon.

(I can’t believe I posted a legit reply to a Dentacoin troll post)
Ahhh... Like that thing that's mentioned in rule 3. I get it!
We can still say TIL, right?
Under "tools" it does list prices on Binance Bittrex and Polo, so I am assuming those are the exchanges which it tracks. Also under the FAQ section as well as a few others the grammar does not seem unreasonably flawed. ~~Also it is run by a man named "Richard Dennis" if you look under "how to use" --> "keys to success".~~


~~He has a fucking Wiki page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dennis~~ 


EDIT: It is based off Richard Dennis's strategy, not run by him.

People hope of losses to turn away but protect profits in good markets, leading to bad risk reward
Apparently, because you can't. You're just another piece of shit troll from the looks of things

Too difficult to form an opinion and articulate it ? 

Daddy not give you any crayons today?

I remember when you took pictures of your low end apartment with stacks of cash on your cheaply made desk like you're a baller.  That was fun.  Too bad people who actually have money don't brag about it.  Nor do they call other people broke over the internet.

Btw 10 years in, 0 use cases for bitcoin outside of crime.  Fidget spinners of finance.
I would say one million by 2021 is doable, but I'd put it closer to 2025. 

Ultimately, I think should Bitcoin become *the* reserve currency (stronger than the USD), then it won't really make sense to denominate Bitcoin in USD. But I believe the value of strong digital store of value (and extensional use cases) is massive and would greatly eclipse the value of gold and other stores of value. 

In my view, something like Bitcoin is good for hedging against the failures and bust cycles of capitalism. It's not going to solve world hunger or peace, but it does offer a vehicle off of the perpetuity of non-stop capitalism and central banking, which I personally think is is a good thing. 

And this comes from someone who is *not* at all a believer in Austrian economics (because it's bullshit and not based on actual research or math) and buys fully into Keynesian economics (because it *is* based on rigorous statistical analysis and modeling). I just think that it's useful to have a hedge against central banks and that a paradigm-shifting digital currency has the power to mitigate some of the damage of caused to labor markets by capital markets. Not to get all Marxy in here, but Bitcoin seems (to me, someone who is *not* an actual economist or political scientist) to serve the interests of the proletariat, should it remain decentralized and accessible to anyone. I could be totally wrong though and Bitcoin could just make problems of inequality worse. I've heard varying arguments regarding this.

Anyway, I think Bitcoin's market cap should be worth at least ~50T or so in today's USD, if it actually succeeds in becoming the reigning reserve currency. Good chance that it happens too. Hence, justifiable Bitcoin maximalism.
It's more simple. A full audit will expose their bank accounts including bank names which means the US correspondent banks will instantly bully those banks to close the accounts like they did already with bitfinex, so they are forced to keep their accounts secret.
Less frequent visitor then (meant no disrespect by the comment)
😉😉💪👍. Sloppy
Thanks for the advice anyway. :) I think life would be less expensive if I just lit a joint and enjoyed the candles. Good day, kind sir! 
If you are open to sharing it I would appreciate it
Well.... 

I'm not in your list and never disclosure my trade or investment ( only that I'm a buyer and not how many / much $$)

But it is scary for me that persons keep track what they say /state here...... 

I do not like.

Sorry for the shitpost.
It seriously wasn’t a troll post.  I catch flak everyday from people I know that I actually believe in the tech and whatnot and then I see stuff like this.

Edit: Removed swearing.
only if you're older than today years old
Lol that wikipedia article looks equally sketchy.

Obviously written by one person, likely himself. 

I stand by the website looking sketchy af.

That’s when I wasn’t a baller actually, it was meant as joke 


>Too bad people who actually have money don’t brag about it. Nor do they call other people broke over the internet. 


Well I do, go eat a dick and enjoy being a broke little bitch


>Btw 10 years in, 0 use cases for bitcoin outside of crime.

Actually the best use case for bitcoin is getting retards like you upset over it for years and years  
Your first two sentences were off to a good start. Your third sentence is naiive. As is the 4th. Some do.

5th sentence? Totally false. As for your last bit? Fidget spinners have had use cases for years and they will continue having use cases after the fad has died.  

Based on all of this, I think you're just a hater.
As if crime isn't a big market? 
We already know the banks, noble bank and the custodian is ny melon.


Noble also scrub parts of the website after the fake audit report 


The founders of the bank created tether and thats the real reason they tried to hide it
none taken, thanks for the info again
Sure, will try to remember later. But you also said "not one big trade" and mine havw been two big shorts over 4 months. So I might not qualify 

For what it's worth I agree that 99% of people who make more than 1 trade a day are going to eventually lose money in the long run. 

Honestly more than 1 a week and I'm kind of skeptical. But that's partly because btc takes forever to move now. 1 a day now is just scalping noise...
Just keep doing what you’re doing and you won’t end up on ‘the list.’ The people that use the bot choose to do so by posting their positions in a format that the bot picks up. Those users are well aware that the positions are tracked publicly.
Is this a thing people know about?
I wouldn’t pay any attention to someone who truly believes in the future of dental blockchain technology. They’re clearly either shilling or stupid. No offense.
/troll

You win.

bitcoin has created the saltiest community in human history - /r/buttcoin. like who the fuck gets so upset over some emerging asset class. i guarantee 99% of them are just butthurt that others made easy money and the rest are just too retarded to jump in the market themselves that they hate on those that actually have balls.

> That’s when I wasn’t a baller actually,

A couple hundred grand in e-pogs doesn't make you baller. 
Fidget Spinners are actually a variation of gyroscopes, and gyroscopes have tons of use cases. So the dude got lawyered
That was just a speculation made by bitmex in their mailing list, certainly not enough grounds for a correspondent banks to go against them, plus they have at least two bank accounts in different banks.
Oh ok yeah then nvm. I’m more referring to the people who are making multiple trades a week on this sub. Congrats on the shorts btw
Well... Goodbye!!
Idk...I know about it and I’m thirty so I figure other people probably do.
I should have said edit(x2)...I had already violated rule 3 twice which is why I had to come back with a post that had some substance to it


Edit: I meant to post this as a response and not as a comment.

Okay, now you're just sounding more and more like a shill. The above appears to be a quote. It doesn't say that Dennis runs the site, it says that he developed the method. Two very different things.

If it didn't look sketchy enough as is, the fact that you're passionately defending it and dismissing skepticism just leads me to believe that you are somehow affiliated or for some reason depending on people relying on the data or using the site otherwise for some reason.

*Skepticism increases*
Yup, just like u/AK47HighCapMag ....plenty of regular folks missed Bitcoin, that’s fine, but this guy knew about it for years and failed to capitalize on it. Years later still gets triggered over it and calls it a ponzi.... that’s a special kind of retard 
shit bot
Being a baller is a state of mind. I can confirm u/YRuAfraid is a baller and I have a super funny anecdote to back it up. Takes one to know one, ya feel?

Hence, you ain’t
So it’s just a coininkadink that noble scrubs section of their website after fake audit 
thanks I'll congratulate myself when I close at the bottom 😄😅
He posted the same thing on the Slack chat.. I'm pretty skeptical too
He's such a baller he has to get laid via sex tourism to destitute Asian countries.  That's not baller, that's pathetic.  More pathetic than taking pictures of him making it rain.  A loser through and through.
Maybe, maybe not, just something circumstantial that belongs on a mailing list or forum but isn't enough for a correspondent bank to initiate such a process.
Oh shit ok nvm I take back my congrats if you haven’t closed yet lol
Yeah, I'm becoming increasingly disillusioned with this sub. A majority of accounts here are either stupid or compromised. There's no way I should be getting slammed like this for pointing out some obvious red flags. Almost everytime I'm critical of something sketchy, I get insta-attacked and brigaded. Rational people don't disregard skepticism and new information like that. Something else is going on, clearly. 
Have you ever been to Illusion Nightclub in Phuket? I have...  it’s pretty sick
I’ve banged hookers in non-Asian countries too... give me some credit 
and it's just a coininkadink that the part of the noble website scrubbed had the name of the partner of the law firm that did the fake audit?

the same partner who was an advisor to imperial pacific which was a casino the FBI raided back in march?
Well it'd be hard to close this one at a loss at this point- and I already closed my short in March at a large profit. Just could've been much larger lol
He's clearly bull-biased. I mean, just look at his ID and previous posts lol
Maybe, maybe not, just something circumstantial that belongs on a mailing list or forum but isn't enough for a correspondent bank to initiate such a process.
Yeah, true. That's not really my concern though. My concern is that the sub as a whole is entirely nonplussed by bad TA and fake information being passed around. I would think people would be more interested in getting to some facet of *truth*, instead of rubber stamping everything that comes through the daily. 

I should lower my expectations. 
I have stated plenty of times that I am bullish currently, so I'm not trying to hide that. Funnily enough, this account was made some time before I got into crypto. It was just a random name
Just value the opinions of the users with a good track record. You can always use the others as sentiments indicator :D
