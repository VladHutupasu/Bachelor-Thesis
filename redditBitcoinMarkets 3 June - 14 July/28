What a *beautiful* $20 pump! This market is showing some formidable strength and dynamic movements like that are a sign of great things to come.
Someone dumped 1.3k BTC on finex in a minute and market just absorbed it. Strange

Could this be the failed bart down and now we go up? Saw failed upward barts in eth at 545 last week after which price collapsed. 
This chop is disgusting
My shot at Wyckoff. Timeframe: Beginning of the "dip" -> now

This would suggest we may be indeed in the middle of "Phase B/Accumulation". Things to note:

* The "jump" has become flatter, i.e. the Trading Range within Phase B becomes tighter (6300-6735). This would suggest selling pressure is becoming weaker. 
* Note that there was no solid Spring or Shakeout yet. If there is a Spring, e.g. a sudden dip to at least Selling Climax (= 6150), or even below it (<6150), and it is *repelled*, at that point the model becomes likely validated and we enter Phase C so the actual *testing phase*. Note that Phase C is not "mandatory", i.e. it may not happen and/or be really mellow.
* If we see breakouts above Trading Range within Phase B (>6735) and/or further above the current Automatic Rally (> 6900), which may be retraced downward, we will arrive at Phase D, so the beginning of the end of Accumulation, and as the textbook states, "evidenced by a pattern of advances (Signals Of Strength) on widening spreads and increasing volume, and reactions (Last Points of Support) on smaller spreads and diminished volumes". According to the textbook, this would be a good moment to open fairly safe longs.

Edit: Added numbers
Edit #2: Improved chart.
**Position bot**

(on mobile so no error checking, ignore any errors)

Ok guys, the bot has been stable and working fine. This means i can work on more advanced features like statistics and such.

Today i come with a controversial topic, back logging.

I have some requests about inserting old trades to the bot.

When i thought about creating the bot i had 2 main goals:
*allow users to quickly check other users open positions to help decide their own trades
*allow users to track their trade history with ease

This means i always had in mind allowing users to enter commands on old posts so they could enter old trades. Although this is working, ut can be cumbersome to go through the posts history to enter the commands and also because that could trigger unwanted notifications in case someone is following your trades.

This brings me to the reasons of the post, allowing users to send me Excel files (with a given template) with their trade history so i can inject them in the database.

These records will be marked as an log entry so that users can judge by themselves whether to trust them or not.
ALL the trades must be sent, this means that i might refuse requests with only successful trades if i don't find evidence on the users posts that those trades really existed and no trades were suppressed. 

I'll limit this feature for users that post here frequently and already have trades on record. 

I'm open to discussion whether this feature should be allowed or no, so drop in your opinion on the matter. 


Tldr: should back logging be allowed in the bot

Feels slightly wrong but I stuck to the plan I made 3 days ago that if the daily held and closed above 6400 I would start scaling back in. No stops this time, at least not yet.

Some anecdotal theories around ‘institutional order flow’ tells me this pennant / inverted H&S should break up. Reasoning:

- Order books are leaning more liquid on the ask side. Excellent opportunity to buy large amounts with smaller slippage.

- Ratio between long/short is at the lowest in the past month. This means that there’s more short stops to hunt.

Edit: In these scenarios a fake-out in the opposite direction is very common to squeeze a bit more liquidity out of the market. So look out for a downward fake-out followed by a big move up.

Edit: For me this a no trade zone. I’m out of position (100% fiat) since I flip-flopped at 6600. So I’m not putting my money where my mouth is on this one.
the virgin bart vs the chad stophunt
Volume on GDAX is very very low - the lowest I can remember seeing. A few other exchanges seem low as well. But I don't know much about all of those different exchanges - can some of you guys that use them chime in? Is volume just really low across the board?
Anyone else of the opinion that the best thing to do right now is to wait it out on the sidelines until directional momentum starts to become a bit more clear? 
Haven’t really seen anyone talk about the **descending triangle on the 4H** ,but I have also barely been checking the price/on Reddit.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/5uWbnPOL/

Terrifies me just a tad 
Feels like playing lottery here, waiting for the big move and everybody can decide to buy a ticket or to miss one turn.
1h bbands incredible tight!
Sym triangle intact still, hidden bearish div maybe playing out currently.

Nothing has changed in the last couple of days. Either this goes to 6800 or breaks 6100 for some fireworks. Shorts and longs almost to parity.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/5GpPIz27/

Good luck, and if you are waiting to trade the breakout be extra careful for these weird ass wicks.

Edit: a word.
Good time to lose patience.
So my theory is that after breaking 6500-6600 with relative ease, the downtrend is taking a breather, but will continue nevertheless. The target for the big wedge breaking down is lower anyway.

Been trying to very patiently open shorts around 6600-6700. There have already been some drops, but it really feels like patience pays off here - the main drop will probably come right after everyone starts to feel like "hey, maybe this will go up instead". We are not there yet.


It seems that everyone is anticipating a big move in one way or the other, desperately looking for signs of reversal or continuation, but aren't the regular markets actually trending like 30% of the time? What if Bitcoin just decides to do nothing for a few months?
There's a part of me that wants to put in small contract limit buys every $5 from $6500 to $6300 just to catch these absurd wick movements. But the one time I do, we'll just plummet. Would be pretty amusing to play with, though. 
Hey guys, noob here. Practicing my charting, did I do this [fib retracement](https://imgur.com/wiFwShO) correctly? If so, am I correct in saying that 50% area is resisting pretty steadily? If I'm wrong, pls let me know. Thanks for all your help as usual.

edit: I'm going off hourly; do I need to switch to daily? 
Closed half my 3x shorts from 6700 btcusd, 524 ethusd. Looks like we just bought more time in the wedge with some dotted line support: https://www.tradingview.com/x/yGNFZdIP/. Will be re-shorting again from ~6500/505.
Hello all,

Here the latest analysis on Bitcoin futures on the CBOE and CME markets from their Commitment of Traders reports, updated to June 12:

**CBOE Futures - each contract is 1 BTC**

Order | Asset Managers/Institutional | Leveraged Funds | Other Reportable  | Non Reportable
---|---|---|---|---|
Long positions | 159 | 1,420 | 1,239 | 2,580
Net change since last week - Long | 6 | -35 | 130 | 97
Short positions | 72 |  3,746 | 1,000 | 635
Net change since last week - Short | 44 | -169 | 300 | 78 



**CME Futures - each contract is 5 BTC**

Order | Asset Managers/Institutional | Leveraged Funds | Other Reportable | Non Reportable
---|---|---|---|---|
Long positions | 0 | 1,349 | 427 | 819
Net change since last week - Long | -47 | 233 | -113 | 3
Short positions | 108 |  1,634 | 440 | 442
Net change since last week - Short | 79 | -211 | 135 | 92 

Source: https://www.cftc.gov/dea/futures/financial_lf.htm

The categories by CFTC are broken down as following as per their site:

>* Asset Manager/Institutional. - These are institutional investors, including pension funds, endowments, insurance companies, mutual funds and those portfolio/investment managers whose clients are predominantly institutional.

>* Leveraged Funds. These are typically hedge funds and various types of money managers, including registered commodity trading advisors (CTAs); registered commodity pool operators
(CPOs) or unregistered funds identified by CFTC. The strategies may involve taking outright positions or arbitrage within and across markets. The traders may be engaged in managing and conducting proprietary futures trading and trading on behalf of speculative clients. 

>* Other Reportables - Reportable traders that are not placed into one of the first three categories are placed into the “other reportables” category.

>* Non-Reportable - Everyone else who isn't required to report to the CFTC. Usually small traders and non-institutional positions.

The "smart money" would be the first 2 categories (especially "levered funds" which is basically hedge funds). These are the investment professionals in this category.

The Other Reportable would other large traders whose position size is over CFTC reporting limit but are not "managed money". My guess is that most of this would include miners who want to hedge and others large traders taking positions on their own behalf. On the other hand the "non-reportable" category is the small speculators, the retail trader who take up smaller positions.


--------

Summary of the Bitcoin futures market:

* CBOE: The total professional trader long positions are 1,579 BTC and short positions are 3,819 BTC

* CME: The total professional trader long positions are 6,745 BTC and short positions are 8,710 BTC.

* On both exchanges, the retail traders are overwhelmingly still long, but shorts are slightly increasing on CME

* The asset manager/institutional investors on CME unloaded their entire long positions and added 395 BTC to the short side

* Leveraged funds are adding to their longs and reducing shorts on CME


I'm thinking of trying to do some analysis in terms of looking at price correlations with the weekly positions on the Bitcoin futures markets. Finally have some data to answer the question on whether the futures market and prices move in tandem. 

Maybe downloading the historical positions for both CME and CBOE for each week and then correlating to the price change in the following week, ie. trying to see if the increase in shorts and longs each week leads to a price increase/decrease in the following week. But the futures expire on the 3rd Friday of the month and we don't have daily ideas, so I'm not sure how else to do it except on a weekly basis. Maybe compare the weekly futures positions changes to 1,2 and 3 week change in price....any ideas?
Happy Father's day everyone!

Just wanted to take a moment to remind everyone about rules 1 and 4. I'm trying to stay off Reddit this weekend, but on Monday I'd love to see that everyone has found a way to resolve their conflicts without help from the mods.
Who's the hero dumping at this price. That's the sound of limp wrists being broken. 
here's a dumb question on a topic that I haven't seen mentioned very much.  Does anyone know exactly how much BTC that BitConnect had when they exit-scammed?
Despite other indicators, considering a small long here 'cause there seems to be enough room for one more up bart without breaching the 1 standard deviation lower Bollinger band on the daily. Target $6650. I like to look for buy/sell signals based on mean reversion. My assumption here being that the price is ranging between LBB1 and LBB2.
1 month of shrimpy.

So a month ago I started to experiment with shitcoin bot trading, shrimpy is a simple rebalancer that doesn't charge fees, so I gave it a small amount that I found in a back pocket of a old ~~pair of pants~~ exchange I hadn't used in a while. Under the theory that the success their back tester showed was unintentional siphoning off pump and dump groups.

So I picked 50 of the shittyest shitcoin, under my "unit insanity" thoery, and a patent pending algorium.

And drum roll please:

https://imgur.com/a/OYY9R57

conclusion: WHAT THE FUCK SHRIMPY, ARE YOU OK, ARE YOU OK SHRIMPY. I would under the impression diversification decreased risk.

**EDIT// shrimpy apparently only rebalences when it feels like it, anyone else using it should probably check that history tab**. see what undocumented behavior it actually does with your money -__-
GDAX down for scheduled maintenance in 4 minutes 
I think this is the lowest volume for Bitcoin in 2018 so far.
We keep coming back to test that 10k descending resistance: https://www.tradingview.com/x/feEXOy1B/

At the moment we would break this trend line around 6600. That’s also the neckline for the inverted ‘head and shoulders’ that we’re seeing (although it’s sloping very bearish).

If we can break 6600 and subsequently take out 6700 as the previous local high, then I think there’s a decent possibility we’ll test the bottom of the big triangle around 7200. However, I see no reason why we would break above 7200. So that should present a good shorting opportunity.

Edit: Here’s a zoomed in version of the same 10k trend line and the inverted H&S: https://www.tradingview.com/x/SiDF8RKx/
!short BTCUSD 6500 add 10X

**Taking a leap of faith** and adding some to my short here, although my leverage is getting high AF its **go big or go home time** so here goes nothing.

We are nearing completion of the bear pennant and mid to high time frames are all pointing down. MACD and RSI is somewhat cooled off
one minute maddness
Wyckoff iH&S cup and handle recovery???
My current set up: https://www.tradingview.com/x/zww4OeL5/

Been planning different snippets of this for a little while but ive finally put it together.

Looking for longs if: bull div confirmation on OBV (confirmed by breaking above the red line on OBV) or a potential bottom fishing play in the liquidity pool in the first green box.

Not looking to short tbh but ill be a lot more compelled to do it if we move up toward the first red box without confirming the div or we have a significant candle close in or below the first green box.

Opinions?
Am I the only one surprised we’re still above $6000?
Here's what I'm seeing.

GDAX Daily: https://i.imgur.com/nHEFHZs.png

Medium term: the bear continues. The yellow line was our support that broke down on high volume. Volume right now is again tapering off which isn't a good sign. When something gets marked down, volume should increase but we are pretty much at the same level as in the 7k's so that definitely implies this isn't over.

Short term, though, R/R favors a long. Blue line would be a great buy with tight stops under 6k and red line would be the target/great short entry. Red line was also support so it should now be resistance and it's also the midpoint of the BB's. This usually happens when we are riding the daily BB's down. We'll dip under them, go sideways, head up toward the midpoint, get rejected, then come back down to ride them down a little further. This will probably be the trend for the next month or so, just like after the double top at 11.7k. 

Any long term goals people throw around are absolute speculation. No one can predict the price of this thing 6 months down the road other than just getting lucky, but my guess (as that all it is) is that we'll bottom out around 4k. Historically, which actually isn't much since we have only been at these price levels for a year, 4k has provided good support. I wouldn't be surprised if we take another trip down to 3k, though.

This article would scare me if i hadn't seen what the big man behind BIS looks like a few months ago.  He is this gigantically fat guy who clearly never gets off his ass to do anything.  In fact, I never heard of the Bank For International Settlements until bitcoin hit 20k.  So apparently Bitcoin is making him have to get off his fat ass.  In addition the article is misleading cause Bitcoin is not designed to process everyday payment, so it sways you into believing something that is false.

support of the pennant turned resistance
Seeing two parallel channels (black and purple). Expecting a similar movement we had between 7k and 7.7k (see fractal)

The green areas are where I will short

https://www.tradingview.com/x/jCKl8NsS/
We are reaching the end of the pennant: [https://ibb.co/hMwmqJ](https://ibb.co/hMwmqJ)

If we break up I see 6.9k as target, if we break down we could go directly to 5.8k.
I keep an eye on this triangle right now, looks like it can breakout anytime soon.

Bitcoin is worth exactly 6500 it seems, nice 9 year price discovery to find this out :)
Curious beginner question: when opening a short and assuming it's not underwater, do you hold that position open for hours or days/weeks ? What's a good moment to close or does it all depend on the market and personal preference/expectations ?
4 hour chart https://www.tradingview.com/x/eNL8p41A/  So mainly today I am watching for a break of this pink line here for us to move up to the original break down area and volume node (as discussed [yesterday's point and figure](https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8rgy73/daily_discussion_saturday_june_16_2018/e0s3w8y/)).  A short could be taken risked off the pink line here, but I am not convinced the r:r is there.  I think a better short opportunity will present itself.

Shorts almost higher than longs on Bitfinex.
[Here](https://imgur.com/a/avFfWx4)'s some hopium: A tiny, tiny bull div on the 4H charts. From June 15-16, price displayed lower lows while RSI14 was flat. Probably not significant.
!long XBTUSD 6418 2x

Stop loss @ 6360

Looks like good r/r and the price action is suspicious. Seems like everyone is scared of going long here (Counter-intuitive)

Oh please god :D
I generally refuse to post or even look at this sub in an obvious bear market because of the vitrol behavior. I decided to come look tonight because I was bored.

Let me say, this sub looks pretty good tonight! The attitude has broken from price and the insights are great! Thanks for all the work guys! Fun to read!

I am a long term trader and am a long term realist. I do however, acknowledge that bear markets can exist for many months and even years. At this point I think we are somewhere between a quarter or half way through the current bear, at least. I'm prepared for anything, but have sold 3/4 of my 2015 buys and have no intention to buy or resell at this very moment. I'm considering getting back into bitmex for some short term plays which I will undoubtedly short for a month long period. Any thoughts?

All in all thanks for the updates on a market which I've been actively avoiding. Reasons for that include people who are on the extremes of either thinking this experiment is a failure and doomed. or that it will succeed and eventually be the only currency that will ever exist. 

Hope you all have a great night and thanks again!
Can't help but read this as accumulation and got out of my short at breakeven. The way it broke out of the triangle slowly says they're very cautiously accumulating while trying to get more shorts to open. Longing this 80% trade stack 5x
every bbands below 6h is ready for a move. in the 7k range we waited even for the 1d to close, I doubt that our next move will be the big move everybody is waiting for...

also we have a new weekly candle in an hour. if somebody wants to paint the chart, it might happen before. 
Reshorted 6508, this looks weaaaak and probably Barts down soon. Stops above 6600 but will be moving them down if in profit
what's up with funding rate on mex? Swaps are consistently in line with stamp and Dax but next period is 0.17% shorts paying longs..?

What is this shit 

I been paying longs out the ass for no reason -_- 

!short xbtusd 6440 5x 100%
What could be some possible catalysts to reignite interest like Japan did last year to kick off the bull?

1. Disappearance or legitimization of tether + finalization of trading legalities in major countries

2. Real world profit generating adoption of 3+ crypto projects

3. Maybe another fiat to crypto exchange? This would shake things up, but I'm not sure this would inspire new money to get in.

 
Does anyone have a good list of daily bitcoin prices since the beginning of its existence? since the first time it was ever actually sold publicly? 
This chop is just so damn boring, we need a big move to indicate direction
Still shorting. Haven't seen anything that indicates a price increase is warranted. Greedy speculators and the tether printer are no longer the dominant force in the market and I suspect it to have educated itself about what really happened. Breaking down soon I think. 
I'll be travelling for business today. Currently all fiat and setting limit buys from 5800-5500 in case we have another bloody sunday like last week. RSI has reset on the mid-to lower time frames.

As many have commented, the market is in a funk right now and could break in either direction with relatively little effort by a large holder. I'm bearish long term, so if it breaks upward, I'm secure that it will be revisiting this level again relatively soon. 
It's normal for it to be slow it's Father's day and Sunday. A lot of people are starting to go on vacations now anyways.
I wonder if those guys from the Crypto cities take huge vacations. I know money never sleeps but in those cities it seems pretty weird.
https://www.coinstaker.com/south-korea-switzerland-crypto-city/
Volume heading to 0. What does that mean? Nobody wants to sell and nobody wants to buy, but the miners have to sell at a constant rate to pay a constant amount of electricity (if the price is fixed and difficulty too) to keep their operations up, so the lower the average volume we get, the worse for BTC's price (it's also bad the increase of difficulty too, since that increases the average cost to mine 1 BTC).

Also, it's important to notice that the higher the price of BTC is, the higher is the cost to maintain it's network, since the cost of producing 1 BTC is related to it's price because of the difficulty adjustment, therefore the higher the price the higher the natural demand for BTC has to be to maintain it's price. If the price of BTC goes down, the neccesary demand to maintain it's price should go down too. You got to think of BTC's blockchain as a company that has a cost of operation to keep working , and the influx of new money is paying it's costs.
If the price reaches 6490 im adding another 20X leverage to my short i have zero faith in a bounce above the pennant previous support now turned resistance. As far as I can tell were beein supported by the lower bands and maybe a one last bulltrap trying to go inside the pennant/ or above. 
I'm bearish now, see you guys at 5k.

>The Bank of International Settlements just told the cryptocurrency world it’s not ready for prime time -- and as far as mainstream financial services go, may never be.

>In a withering 24-page article released Sunday as part of its annual economic report, the BIS said Bitcoin and its ilk suffered from “a range of shortcomings” that would prevent cryptocurrencies from ever fulfilling the lofty expectations that prompted an explosion of interest -- and investment -- in the would-be asset class.

>The BIS, an 88-year-old institution in Basel, Switzerland, that serves as a central bank for other central banks, said cryptocurrencies are too unstable, consume too much electricity, and are subject to too much manipulation and fraud to ever serve as bona fide mediums of exchange in the global economy. It cited the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies -- Bitcoin and its imitators are created, transacted, and accounted for on a distributed network of computers -- as a fundamental flaw rather than a key strength.

>In one of its most poignant findings, the BIS analyzed what it would take for the blockchain software underpinning Bitcoin to process the digital retail transactions currently handled by national payment systems. As the size of so many ledgers swell, the researchers found, it would eventually overwhelm everything from individual smartphones to servers.

>“The associated communication volumes could bring the Internet to a halt,” the report said.

The banks are scared of Bitcoin.

Rising wedge broke & turned resistance? https://www.tradingview.com/x/SKqhJfEK/
ETH ratio has been static for nearly 2 days. Everybody waiting for a direction
Feels like market makers have left the building.

Only little fish trying to break resistances and supports that leads nowhere.
Feeling like the inertia of the bear is bound to take over this indecision.
Pretty sure BTC is just lulling people to sleep before the next 15% day. This feels quite a bit like 8500 and 7500. 
Feels like no one really wants Bitcoin anymore, just a few hodlers who hope they have a lottery ticket to the moon. I've never experienced this kind of apathy regarding crypto currencies before. Even most of my crypto-enthusiastic friends have abandoned ship.

If you ask me, developers are doing a lousy job with developing use-cases for crypto. It's like nothing's happening. So boring...
if Bitcoin does turn out to be a paradigm shift in history, then buying it at the price of 6500 is mortgage your house kind of decision
If you post a position for positionbot on a previous day's thread, will it update the page accordingly and show it as a day old? Or add it to the top of the list and start the timer from actual time of posting?
BBs getting intensely tight on the 1 hr 
Looking for some advice, just been having a look at a chart I did earlier this week and noticed I had the trend lines extended past today. What's odd is the price seems to be loosely respecting them. Is this valid or just a fluke?

Cheers
weekly bbands stoped tightening with new weekly candle. 
Bear pennant on the 4 hour looking pretty well defined in my opinion: https://imgur.com/YaYqHqt

Expecting this to break down in the near future for another proper test of 6000. I think there’s nothing to stop us from breaking down this time, no bullish SEC ether news and no old buy orders waiting to be filled.

Hey guys! I have been trading alts for the past 4-5 months and have made a good stack out of it. Now i want to  start shorting btc on bitmex with a target of 2.5k over 4-5 months. I want to ask some questions regarding it if anyone of you would be kind enough to help.

Also what leverage is ideal for a new trader? 5-10x?
Gear up for two weeks of sideways as we punish underwater shorts with ludicrous funding rates before the next leg down.
Getting some decent downward movement now.
BTC is really holding up well.  Should hold above 5k, and could easily be over 7k by year end.
breaking down from the pennant, slowly painfull bleed
I will give these big bears credit for one thing: they have a lot of soon-worthless grandpa money to waste trying to kill Bitcoin. :D

I mean, wouldn't it be hilarious if they got caught with their pants down owing a bunch of shorted Bitcoin as they watched helplessly while the price mooned (again)?  Holding a bag, if you will?! :D totally delusional, looking Goblin Town in the face in the form of their own bankruptcy in the face of having to cover a bunch of Bitcoin? Wouldn't that be a perfect end to the first chapter of Bitcoin, literally killing the banks through their own hubris? Like, "GENESIS BLOCK: "Bankers are scumbags stealing our money." [battle ensues] "OH NOEZ! WE SHORTED BITCOIN FOR SIX MONTHS, and now we can't pay back the coins we owe!"

Shakespeare had nothing on Satoshi, man.

Word to the wise: Deutschebank is already bankrupt.  If you own that stock, dump it pronto.  It's going to zero.

Asian work week starts with thwarted attempt at Bart. Bullish.  
 Bitcoin more like buttcoin haha. poopcoin  


pee pee poo poo coin 
Step 1) 19k spike down to 10k
Step 2) Quick Bounce from 10k to 17k
Step 3) Slow bleed back to 10k and break

Step 1) 10k spike down to 6k
Step 2) Quick Bounce from 6k to 12k
Step 3) slow bleed back to 6k and.....

*Figures rounded for simplicity
Exactly. Ugh
Big money in Asia re-enters the game in a few hours.  Who thinks they will be selling?  I'm thinking they will be buying because $6K was clearly the bottom.

Edit: by the way, I'm long from 6530.
Please tell me, what way would you _like_ the price to move over the next 3 days? If I get at least 5 responses I will tell you a joke (by way of an edit to this comment).

Edit:

Q: Why did the duck _not_ cross the road?

A: Because the chicken said to him “Don’t do it! You won’t hear the end of it!”
Yup, noticed that too. This indeed starts to look like a broader accumulation. This is the 3rd major attempt at a dip since Friday and we are still within 6400-6600. Everything stays within this range.

https://i.imgur.com/zvoesAg.png

If this isn't accumulation, what is it then? I am puzzled.
not a failed down bart, there was a wall, someone dumped with purpose into that wall

looks like those 1k were all shorts. +1.6k today.
My tired eyes read this as “1.3 BTC” and i thought it was a shitpost. Then it was serious all the way through to the end and my brain exploded.
Somebody could be moving their Fiat from a verified BFX account to an unverified account by selling to themselves.
We actually need low volatility before we can start a sustained upward rally. I'm titillated personally.
Boring 
Does this even qualify as chop? This is like the noise in between.
This it well-written, backed up by evidence, *and* confirms my bias. 3/3 thanks, bud!
Thanks for your Wyckoff attempt!

*However* I have some important criticism. Alright so let me preface I just [read this real quick] (http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:market_analysis:the_wyckoff_method) and haven't done extensive research on Wyckoff.

* Phase A: The first flaw I see is a lack of PS (preliminary support). To me, your "automatic rally" is nothing more than a PS. That was barely a $100 rally, truly laughable. In the Wyckoff accumulation schematic, you can clearly see the automatic rally is **after** the *selling climax*. You did correctly identify the selling climax though. Thus, the *correct* automatic rally is at 6500.


How does the low volume add up with Wyckoff accumulation theory? There was widespread suspicion this happened in early April prior to the BGD mark-up. I don't know about that but at least volume was much bigger than now.
It's up to you, but it'll take some time with the verification work. I think, it'd be ok to just leave it, the record will grown through time

So you have an opinion which even you don't really believe. Excellent opportunity but you won't do it. 
I agree. It seems just too "easy" to go straight down to sub 6k from here. There will be one more short squeeze / trap to fuck up both some new long positions and current short positions, imo
Gdax volume is always lower than the rest but is a solid indicator of major market moves

Blockfolio says bitfinex exploded in volume. https://i.imgur.com/AFAxWuq.jpg
bitcoin is old news.. its just get limp along until it crashes to 0 when the miners sell

That's what I'm doing, at least until volume picks up. I was successful Friday playing the trading channels, but this low volume takes forever to get my order filled that it's not worth it  (I use Gdax). 

I might hop back in at BTC, or I may hop in on BCH or LTC which has pretty low ratios, but still setting higher lows.
Looks good to pop up to 8k then fall to 3k 
on kraken the majority of buy orders are just bots buying super small orders (for most of the top 10 coins). Literally no one is buying anything right now (never seen the market like this, crazy). 
Yup, we will break one way or the other.. Have no idea which direction.

High volatility is just around the corner and will spread those bands apart
Why can't it go to 6100 and bounce?
Shorts/longs scares me a lot. We've very nearly recreated April 11.
maybe that feeling will be around 6.9k where we test/fail to break resistance. 
Entirely possible.
if you look at btc's historical charts there's rarely a period of time where it's not trending over the course of 6-9 months. The volatility over 3 months has probably never been lower than like a 50-100% spread. then again volatility isn't necessarily a trend. But I don't think btc has ever gone sideways for more than like 6 months.
People said the same thing a week ago...
The float is so low that I can't see it doing nothing for that long. You'd need a concerted effort of people deciding to simply not trade it. 
Since we also have some nice wicks upwards, i try to go the opposite path in placing some limit sells upwards to try and catch a wick (based on my bearish bias)..
Been out whole weekend, checking the price every couple hours. Wtf, we're still here? Chop City it is...
I've been doing exactly this yesterday and today, building what I think will be a pretty nice long from around $6,400. I do worry about a quick dump, but those 1000+ that were sold earlier barely had any effect (other than to give me some more entries below $6,500)

Are retailers people trading contracts at $30k? I thought retailers people buying $100-2500.
clearly you hacked the CFTC website to create fake data and cause us to lose money.

In all seriousness though, if the data you are referring to is available in CSV format, I can try to throw something together using Catalyst and/or Zipline.  If Quantopian would add Bitcoin futures data already, it would be so much easier, but that isn't an option yet.
Re any ideas: Maybe just the table info on futures & done in a separate post outside the daily.

Edit: might be helpful to edit the cme/cboe headers to indicate 1 contract is the price* of 1 or 5 btc rather than 1 contract is 1 or 5 btc.

*where price is calculated as X.
Nice report. Thank you.
Great information, thanks. Pros vs retailers difference in longs/shorts is new information for me, but it does make sense. 
Very good info, and then a good summary at the end because I was too lazy to add them up myself. 

My summary of your summary: **Institutional Traders have significant more shorts than longs. They may thus try to dump it. However, Retail traders are mostly longs. Battle continues**

This reminds me of that great article on WSJ about how futures traders may be using them to profit off manipulation in spot prices:

>Investors upset that bitcoin has crashed more than 50% since December could now have someone to blame: Chicago futures markets.

>That’s the conclusion of a new research note from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. It finds that the Dec. 17 launch of bitcoin futures at exchange giant CME Group, owner of the venerable Chicago Mercantile Exchange, triggered a collapse in the digital currency by making it easier to “short” bitcoin–or bet on its price falling.

>“The rapid run-up and subsequent fall in the price after the introduction of futures does not appear to be a coincidence,” a group of researchers from the San Francisco Fed and the Stanford Graduate School of Business write in the note, released online Monday. 

>Futures are a tool for betting on whether the price of something–such as gold, pork bellies, or Treasury bonds–will rise or fall. The San Francisco Fed is essentially saying that launching a futures market on an asset that’s never had its own futures market could add downward pressure to the prices of the asset. Until the launch of bitcoin futures, there were few easy ways to short it.

>But that’s not how things played out when CME revealed its plan to list bitcoin futures. That announcement, on Oct. 31, was widely seen as a vote of confidence in bitcoin and a huge step forward in its evolution from a niche product favored by hackers and libertarians into a mainstream investing fad.

>According to research site CoinDesk, bitcoin more than tripled from $6447.67 on Oct. 31 to its record intraday high of $19,783.21 on Dec. 17–the same day bitcoin futures began trading at CME. Bitcoin was trading at around $9,400 late Monday afternoon.

>Bitcoin futures actually started trading on Dec. 10, at CME’s cross-town rival, Cboe Global Markets But the researchers say trading was thin until CME’s launch a week later. They compare the post-Dec. 17 price drop in bitcoin to two other bitcoin price declines in 2017, and they find that the drop after the CME launch was much deeper and longer-lasting.

>CME disputed the idea that its futures caused the bitcoin crash. “Many factors influence price, and it is worth noting that the futures market is still trading a fraction of the cash bitcoin market each day,” a CME spokeswoman said.

>That isn’t the first time the introduction of a derivative contract has been blamed for a big price drop. In a 2012 paper, a pair of economists at George Washington University and Yale University argued that the 2005-06 introduction of credit default swaps, or CDS, on certain mortgage-backed securities eventually caused a drastic drop in the price of those securities. That’s because the CDS allowed bearish traders to express their view on an overvalued market, as anyone who has watched “The Big Short” can attest.

>Something similar happened with bitcoin, according to the San Francisco Fed’s note. “Once derivatives markets become sufficiently deep,” it says, “short-selling pressure from pessimists leads to a sharp decline in value.”

https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2018/05/08/debut-of-bitcoin-futures-triggered-crash-in-price/

There was this CFTC request to hand over data, it sounds like they may have found some manipulation in the futures markets:

>WASHINGTON—Government investigators have demanded that several bitcoin exchanges hand over comprehensive trading data to assist a probe into whether manipulation is distorting prices in markets linked to the cryptocurrency, according to people familiar with the matter.

>The investigation followed the launch of bitcoin futures on CME Group Inc.’s CME 0.57% exchange six months ago. CME’s bitcoin futures derive their final value from prices at four bitcoin exchanges: Bitstamp, Coinbase, itBit and Kraken. Manipulative trading in those markets could skew the price of bitcoin futures that the government directly regulates.

>CME, which launched bitcoin futures in December, asked the four exchanges to share reams of trading data after its first contract settled in January, people familiar with the matter said. But several of the exchanges declined to comply, arguing the request was intrusive, the people said. The exchanges ultimately provided some data, but only after CME limited its request to a few hours of activity, instead of a full day, and restricted to a few market participants, the people added.

>The dispute frustrated CME’s regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, these people said. In response, the commission subpoenaed the exchanges for the data. CFTC officials backed the launch of bitcoin futures, saying they viewed it as a risky but worthwhile project.

>The CFTC was upset CME didn’t have in place agreements that would compel bitcoin markets to share trading data tied to futures contracts, these people said. Such agreements would detail what information the cryptocurrency venues would have to provide to CME, including the time of trades, unfilled or canceled orders, the size of orders, and traders’ identities.

>CME initially sought the data through a third-party firm that calculates the bitcoin index price it uses for its futures contract, a person familiar with the matter said.

>The bitcoin exchanges were opposed to handing over so much sensitive trading data to the London company, which also operates a platform for trading cryptocurrencies, the people said.
>  shrimpy apparently only rebalences when it feels like it, anyone else using it should probably check that history tab

If using Shrimpy with Binance for example, it rarely rebalances with a small investment due to Binances minimum trade restrictions (about $9?). A maximum of 3 or 4 shitcoins per $1000 investment is needed for it to work properly. Do you know how your results would've compared to just holding?
I'm also using shrimpy and it's hard to blame shrimpy when the market has gone so low in the past month
You mean the scheduled dump 😂
400 comments in the last daily came as a bit of a shock (as someone who is infrequently here)
I just can't see us retracing nearly all the dumping we did last weekend. Think we will have more resistance before we approach that, but that would be an excellent shorting opportunity

Got em! What is it *designed* for btw?
Now it's just riding along the ascending resistance from the bottom of the pennant. This sideways action is positively enthralling.
We spent more time in the upper channels of the pennant than lower. Does that mean something?
Anytime soon I'm always right 90% of the time.
What timeframe are you thinking? Soon is vague.
break up?
We did this already at 9 and 7.5...
RemindMe! 9 months
-depends on the market and personal preference/expectations

What is your risk tolerance? Where are major support and resistance levels? Is there anything on the fundamentals side coming up? etc. etc.
Look up risk reward, technical analysis and use a system like kelly betting so you limit your risk(or develop your own but thats a good example of a system). Ffs dont start on margin thinking its a quick way to being rich. If your really lucky it may make yoy quick but its equally as likely to ruin any money you made and more
If you don't know the answer to this, honestly you should not be margin trading. And I'm not trolling you.

> I'm considering getting back into bitmex for some short term plays which I will undoubtedly short for a month long period. Any thoughts?

Bitmex is pretty great. Though you just won't be able to get in market orders a lot of the time during high volatility so plan accordingly if you trade there. 

If you're wanting to try margin trading... As someone that started using margin for the first time after 5 years of not I'd highly recommend starting with a small percentage of what you want to actually trade to play around with margin to get a feel for it. 
It only takes 5 seconds to check that shorts fell this weekend. 


https://www.tradingview.com/x/3nuWYbKb/
Or it says that ta is useless but you're trying to find a justification for the triangle breakout not working?
Too many short order on Bitmex, maybe? The rate is around 0.1% per 8 hours these last 2-3 days, crazy rate.
Spot price is consistently trading under the mark price which is consistently under the index, hence the negative funding and the shorts paying the longs. 
Ever since I started shorting futures for longer term plays, I've wondered why the liquidity chooses mostly perps.

I mean, seriously, is there any reason to play perps other than short-term scalps? If you're trading the trend, you're almost always going to be paying out the ass for fees. I had a medium-sized perp position open earlier this week and paid about 0.05btc in one day...insane.
i see swap price below index?
I completely empathize with you. This is fking BS.

There isn't even much of a difference between swap price and spot price.
The bubble needs to fully deflate before it kicks off again. Nothing will stop or change its progress. It's a natural cycle that treats individual crumbs of news as an irrelevance.

Patience. We were at 7500 for 2 weeks.
Agree with you. As soon as the price goes up a bit buyers are hesitant. While going down is no problem and goes fast.

Billions of people are watching the world cup..

I don't think miners are living hand to mouth, what is it with miners having to sell a certain amount every single day.

The big miners will be rich enough to cover their costs, probably for weeks if not months.
> Volume heading to 0. What does that mean?

Sunday evening in a market that is not exciting. Gosh, not so hard, or?
maybe the miners need to start a marketing campaign to convince people that newly minted/"fresh" Bitcoins are somehow worth more than used ones.
Why? 
you will be more bearish at 5k and say see you at 3k. etc.
The reason bull flags and bear flags don't work on lower time frames lately are because it's probably just 1 guy buying/selling half of the time. 

Some dude dumps or buys 1000 btc in 5 minutes and it fucks up the charts.

Then people keep buying and selling like nothing happened. So it's not really representative of the real psychology of a bull/bear flag. 


You might want to switch to 1HR or higher interval, as 3min is very short term.  And yes, also on the 1HR there is a bull flag/pennant with flying colours. How it plays out, nobody knows with these pathetic volumes. 
The whole thing is nothing but one big proud bull flag and bear trap. Has been since block one. Don't you guys see that yet with all your fancy charts?
I'm not sure if I ever personally believed that Bitcoin or the current wave of cryptocurrencies was going to replace the current financial system.

Augment and change some aspects of it maybe, but definitely not replace any time in the near future. But that being said, if you don't see the value of sending money to someone anywhere in the world without relying on a centralized 3rd party, then I doubt anything is going to change your mind on the matter. And that's just ONE use case of crypto that's actively being used today.

The electricity thing being a "disaster" just sounds like FUD. EDIT: It's an issue worth paying attention too but I'd still hesitate to call it an environmental "disaster" like the that report claims. Interesting article on the electricity issue here: https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/study-claims-bitcoin-uses-much-energy-ireland-not-so-fast-n875211

And transaction volumes is something that pretty much every cryptocurrency worth its salt is working on. We know Bitcoin has issues with tons of transactions. That's why we have proposed solutions like Lightning Network coming.
"It’s simply too risky on a number of levels to try and run the global economy on a network with no center."

Okey dokey. I kind of thought it was thousands of 'centers' instead. Anyway fiat is not going anywhere as long as there are governments and countries that charge tax to live in them. 

Much more fun from here - https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/06/17/bitcoin-useless-unsafe-dirty-finds-withering-bis-report/

"That bubble has now definitively burst. Bitcoin has crashed from $19,187 to $6,474 since peaking in December. Most of the leading cryptos have dropped by two-thirds or more, slashing their notional value by at least half a trillion dollars. There is no obvious floor. These currencies are not redeemable. Nothing stands behind most of them. **The BIS report is the final authoritative nail in the coffin**."
No, they provided valid points regarding why bitcoin is inefficient as a global payment system... that's not being "scared"
Just another dinosaur wondering what that bright light in the sky is.
> The banks are scared of Bitcoin.

No shit.  Who do you think has been manipulating the price down for the last six months at a cost of billions?  The same people that are about to bring you the bankruptcy of Deutschebank and a bunch of its creditors!

You would have to be incredibly stupid and/or desperate to be selling Bitcoin right now.
Do you have any arguments against what they said? Those are not exactly baseless criticisms. Thanks for posting an interesting article though

Dude, it's the weekend. If you were a whale, would you waste a beautiful weekend in the glorious month of June actively trading Bitcoin?

I've pretty much stepped away from watching it. You don't realize how boring it is until you do that. Just letting my long from 6600 ride, expecting to close with a nice profit next week, but not about to waste my weekend staring at a screen.

With that, Happy Father's Day to all the dads. Diydude out.
> I've never experienced this kind of apathy regarding crypto currencies before

For those who lurked during 2014/15 then this is still like goddamn Mardi Gras all day, every day. 
I'm not a developer, but I'm sure it's not as fast as what think it is to code something that has 0 bugs. Since money is involved, they want to be extra sure things won't go wrong. Example, Fair that was being built on Stellar platform was hinting at a Feb then Mar release. Never happened.

Anyways, this doesn't really have much to do with trading bitcoin though.It just sounds like you've given up and want to rant. Which is ok, but I think this daily should stick to trading bitcoin....
Honestly - this is going to continue until either Lightening starts working, or people get fed up and return to original Bitcoin protocol being run by Bitcoin Cash.

This is why I hate Core.... they've killed Bitcoin.  Nobody gives a crap anymore - but even though they are sinking into the abyss, they still refuse to stop trying to kill everything else too.  "If we can't have it - no one else can".

Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin, just doesn't own the name anymore.  But technically it IS Bitcoin.  If people want to rediscover the vision, the drive, the energy, the potential, and that old "to da moon" feeling again..... then return to the technical Bitcoin.  BITCOIN F#%KING CASH!


Wtf don't mortgage your house to invest in a highly speculative market lmfao
And if it doesn't, don't worry, lots of people do okay under bridges. 
Thx just bought 100k
And if it turns out to be a dud and fizzles out, then mortgaging your hose to buy at $6500 is off yourself kind of decision. Nobody knows which of the 'ifs' it is (or maybe something in between), that's why there's both buyers and sellers here, and that's why not many people are running to mortgage their houses.

Damnit man, can’t you just post some TA or something instead of this bullshit? Nobody but you cares about this pointless drama. 
Leverage doesn't matter, it's mainly your position size that matters. Are you going to go balls to the wall and put your entire crypto allocated funds into a short? Then I'd say be careful of shorting more than 2-3x. 

If you're shorting a small amount or your trade stack, 5-10x should be fine. Keep in mind a bad entry will easily get you liquidated though. 
IMO stick to 10x until you're super comfortable with the platform. 25x is a lot more fun. Only use 100x when you're shit faced so you can blame your degeneracy on your alcoholism. 
How can I make an account on there I live in America

50$?
Lol.
this could certainly break down, however someone who is accumulating might just be giving the appearance of a breakdown to encourage people to sell/short so that they can buy into your sells with better liquidity and less slippage. 

edit: I should mention that I'm long currently
Could be the fakeout before the BGD.

Who knows any more?
Let's hope so! I got a sell order at $40k just incase we get a 1min wick up around that level. 
fakeout?
Shorting, at least on bitmex, is a defined risk. You'll never owe money. you can lose your position if you get liquidated but that's about worst case scenario. It's a lot less spooky when you understand what it is. 
interesting, can you elaborate a little more
Who say? Why $1000? Why it would trigger a reversal? So many questions 😱 🤷🏻‍♂️ 
In China at least, the work week doesn't start until tomorrow. Today's the Dragon Boat Festival.
Best contribution of the day.
So the idea here is that bitcoin is going to do the same thing again based on literally one datapoint of doing that thing? Ok..
The term spike would be clearer for describing upward movements, drop would make more sense for downward movements. 
sounds about right.  If it bounces to 10/12k tons of bag holders who don't understand the technology will prob sell
Cool, I wanna try...

Step 1): rise from $1800 to 20k in six months

Other step 1) slow bleed down to the 6k region over the next six months

I think we all know what's coming next with this irrefutable pattern!

http://www.cryptocanvas.com

Their volume isn't the best but you never know, it needs to increase IMO. 
> $6K was clearly the bottom.

At this point it is very clear that 6k is not the bottom. I advise you to treat that long as a scalp and close at 6800-6900. I think we will test the bottom of the triangle as resistance on the 1day/3day and then plunge.
Sideways. +-$1
Up to 50k+ over the next few days would be fine 
I would _like_ us to test 6k with a very strong rejection and a high volume move upwards.

Edit: Although that’s not looking very likely.
I'd like it to flash crash and hit all my low low bids and rebound. That's the only game I'm playing in this market right now. Otherwise I can't find a compelling reason to go short or long.

This joke better be good, you racked up quite the negative karma so you at least need the comedic return ratio value...
Up
Hotsoccermom is still bullish? Bottom is not yet in.
This is valid criticism. However, I think that Preliminary Support should the actual *support*. Automatic Rally would be here resistance, so it cannot be a PS as you suggest. The textbook defines Preliminary Support as *"(PS) preliminary Support is where substantial buying begins to provide pronounced support after a prolonged downmove Volume and spread widen and provide a signal that the downmove may be approaching its end"*. So it needs be support. Initially, I simply ignored it since there's no clear indication when PS could be. But if we add it the way the "manual" suggests, it would be here at (PS). 

It is also logical to look for AR after SC, as you suggest. This said, the "manual" defines AR as the "highest high" defining the boundaries of the Trading Rage. So it needs to be the highest point, I'd say. Quoting the source directly, *"The lows of the Selling Climax (SC) and the Secondary Test, and the high of the Automatic Rally (AR) initially set the boundaries of the trading range."* Also I couldn't find any specific instruction to look for AR after SC anywhere. It doesn't say anywhere that's the principle there.

An improved chart, with two proposed positions for AR, one unlikely (perhaps anomalous, this is a model after all, can't always be 1:1) and one likely:

https://i.imgur.com/p5lfVUL.png

The effect is the same. Trading Range remains 6150-6900. The narrowed down trading range within Phase B remains 6300-6735.

While I’m not putting my money behind it, I am putting the reputation of my name somewhat on the line. I am publishing most of my observations and trades publicly here with the intention to become a better trader.

The main reason I don’t put my money behind this (and openly admitting that) is because I’ve been chopped up a bit recently and this zone in general is very uncertain. That said, I can (and will) publish my observations nevertheless ;)
Thanks! GDAX had a spike as well, but it returned to normal and now is even lower - Bitfinex has held up better. More interestingly, Bitfinex looks to have a much higher "baseline" volume - it's down 20% from the spike, but GDAX is down like 75%.
What's the motivation for that belief?

It's a wedge, it closes eventually. Also trying to check my bias  - better than 'we broke down conclusively'.
Wow thanks for this, amazing perspective dude. 
Turns out everyone's favorite scammer made a crucial mistake the other night and then someone linked to him being banned in rCryptoCurrency for the same exact rookie mistake, forgetting to log into the right account.

Sock puppets abound!

Also, /u/arsonbunny is not going to be able to contend with what you wrote above because he's just a pretend expert, which is part of my point. This guy copied a fucking table and wrote some hand wavy nonsense and yet he thinks he's the most well respected and smartest person in the room, always. In reality he's running a huge campaign of soc puppets and vote manipulation. 

FRAUD.
I assume you mean CME Non-Reportable? It's relative to the actual professional markets, nobody buys $100 positions on the CME. Its a cash settlement also, you can't compare it to someone buying Bitcoin on Coinbase.
It actually is available in CSV Format and Excel too:

https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/CommitmentsofTraders/HistoricalCompressed/index.htm

The "Traders in Financial Futures" report the BTC info. I would love if someone with programming experience could do this, or someone who knows r-studio. I was planning just to do it in Excel with the Data Analysis Toolkit addin.

The only problem is that the data is only aggregated weekly, on Tuesday and futures expire on the 3rd Friday. If we had daily data we could do more accurate looks at how it behaves around expiration.
Btw, turns out OP's analysis was [debunked by a much smarter trader](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ronjo/daily_discussion_sunday_june_17_2018/e0u59eg/)

Turns out OP is a big phony. Who could have guessed?
No problem, take care and trade well.
Turns out OP is pushing bad analysis, [once again debunked by a more intelligent and honest trader](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ronjo/daily_discussion_sunday_june_17_2018/e0u59eg/).

Who would have guess that arson was blowing smoke up people's asses? Did I say something along these lines earlier? Did I link to all the scamming arson has done previously?

Hmmm, yeah looks like OP is a phony and a fraud, just like I said.
I don't think it's that clear cut. If I had a lot of investment in mining equipment, I'd set up a short to hedge my risk during a potential bear market.

Are you a sock puppet account? I don't recall ever seeing you post in BitcoinMarkets and your post history doesn't reveal any activity here. 

It's interesting that you show up to congratulate and give praise to arsonbunny, isn't it. Just like all the other times when some rando shows up just at the right time to do the same.

hmm, guy who just posted detailed information regarding possible trading strategies, or the guy who chases people around Reddit trying to act like the authority on who can post here and why.  Tough call.

I really don't understand how you haven't been permanently banned for your recent shenanigans.
Bye.

Hey look, another sock puppet account. Same one that was deleting comments [here](https://www.removeddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7osoap/i_created_a_fundamental_quantitative_valuation/).

Isn't it nice that you just decided to show up in BitcoinMarkets again today? 

/u/the_ops_mommy /u/sloppysynapses  /u/jarederaj 

Look guys, it's another account that just happened to show up with praise for Arson. And look! It also happens to be the same account that was praising and deleting comments in the CC thread. 

Hmmmm... All of these coincidences are turning quite strange. There's something to this but I can't quite put my finger on it....

Yeah, 7200 is certainly a tall order.  But a move up to 6900 isn’t out of reach I think.
Hahaha wow. Now that's what I call rational trading
That's a pretty good entry, I don't think you have to worry about it if you keep SLs around 7K.
haha so true
store of value - it stays in the vault.  anchored down.  stuff like lightning or other coins do the rest
speculation is just a part of life.  People speculate on stocks and everything. There is much more to Bitcoin than speculation.  early adopters take on the risk and gain the financial reward while late adopters simply use the technology because it enhances their lives
I've got a similar pennant. It's encouraging the price has been pushing on the upper end of the limit. However, this could break up, down, or continue sideways from here. Either way, the point for my pennant ends around the end of the day tomorrow. I doubt it takes that long though, or else it'll likely just continue sideways since it's getting pretty compressed already.

(Edit: Looking more pennant-like after that drop. We may still be in action!)
right now.
that's a bear pennant, he left out the part where we dumped before that

I see, good points. When looking at some open positions from people here, some have shorts open more than 30 days, since 8 or 9K. They're doing it pretty well. :-) 
Well, I do understand it of course. Closing when you're in the green and try to avoid getting liquidated.

Actually, I was more curious if people here open/close positions every day or open and close after days/weeks. Personally I like to interact (doing trades) every day because it's fun.  
https://www.tradingview.com/x/3CZdyyyn/

I personally don't trust this blatant weakness. It's like poker, imo. The bottom of the trendline is still holding, ignoring the wicks.

I think whales are going to make one more push towards 7k before dragging this thing to sub 6k

Nonsense! There is no better teacher than watching your position get liquidated via a stop hunt and then watching a huge candle in the direction you need one minute later. 

t. 100x short with my whole stack at 8450 on 5/19 
??? How is it "not working"? It doesn't all happen in a day. we'd have to move up like 20-25% before you could really say it failed, although revisiting $7k+ would certainly weaken the move downwards
It's just that swaps price should be below mark for funding to be in favor of longs. 

It's usually perfectly even lately. So I'm confused...

e: nvm i see that its under 
You mean swap price? Spot price is what swaps would have to be trading under.

And every time I look, swaps are pretty much even or over mark. 

I mean gdax is 6505 and bitstamp 6513 for like an hour or two now. And funding rate is still almost -0.1%?

technically 0.1% is $6.5 but I always thought funding had a bit more leeway than that. I didn't realize it was so strict. Swaps are just slightly under the combination of gdax + Stamp. So I don't get why funding is so bad
This is also very strange, also OKEX used to have the highest volume on weekly, but slowly over the course of a year, quarterly gained the highest open interest and volume. I do think the funding is used to correct over and under spot price because it doesn't expire, but the funding rate is very high in cases during the major bull/bear markets.
For whatever reason I was getting a ton of funding in $7ks so I was fine holding it. Then this shit shafted me and now I'm at a net loss from funding over the past few weeks. 

And I hate shorting futures when they're at a discount, but it looks like that might be what I should do if funding keeps fucking me over.

I think it's kind of a cyclical thing. Liquidity goes to liquidity :/ Swaps funding really is pretty silly. Especially now that bitmex has insane liquidity. 

I was talking to dush about this earlier today and he said he's not even sure why there is funding- bitmex is so liquid now it could just keep liquidations on mark and that should be enough.

But not sure if that'd actually work 
It is now, I wasn't watching it carefully and happened to see it at the same price like 5 times in a row.

But now  I see bitmex being bearish...which is probably bullish -_-
This can't be repeated enough. For the price to go up again, first all hope of it doing so must be lost.
No, there is absolutely nothing to indicate that a new bull run will ever happen spontaneously. This is not stock market which is rigged to go up forever by the government. 
Thank you!
and then we saw the 6's

The volume is low therefore any rise is untrustworthy atm imo. Also its just noice as long as we are inside the 6-12h bear pennant which has decreasing volume signaling further downside
It depends on how quickly we find the bottom. From what I've seen and read, the popular psychological bottom would be in the 4000 range. If we bounce back up to the 7000s, it would only delay the inevitable in my opinion and drag out the bear market longer. If the price reaches that range in the next week or two, the recovery will be significantly sooner.
Well said. That is what many forget - miners have been hoarding coin AND cash for a long time during the runup.
the only miner I know personally sells his coins on a daily basis (I think).  That being said, he's also not a trader/investor, bur rather a fairly tech savvy person who has the space and cheap electricity in his business space (which is also completely unrelated to crypto).
Uh is this not how they work? I don't think miners are hodlers my man. Gotta pay the bills. Companies don't stop selling inventory and wait when demand goes down 
Weeks not months
Also World Cup™ 
You could make the argument that they are... If given a choice, do you think institutional money would prefer freshly minted coins or, for example,  coins that could be easily traced back to the dark web? Just risk mitigation. 
Fungible.
Was expecting bulls to buy on this new weekly candle, I guess there's still a week but it's make or break this week. 
Bull flags have a 2 out of 3 chance to break upwards. I'm not sure I buy the conspiracy of one person dumping tons of coins, when a bull flag is more likely to break up than down.

I think the barts are fake flags. They're created due to high leverage stop-loss Cascade on low liquidity. They create the appearance of a flag, but really didnt garner any support to back it up so then it Cascades the other direction. In our current environment, it's safe to assume most Low TF flags are barts unless you have evidence of the contrary (expanding bbands, new high/low on the 4Hour, etc)

Flags have historically worked pretty well on lower TFs

Could you actually explain to me how it's just FUD? I personally don't understand how bitcoin could scale to any sort of huge number of users without using an exorbitant amount of power. 

I genuinely would be receptive to someone refuting this point
> The electricity thing being a "disaster" just sounds like FUD.

Satoshi's elegant solution to network security:

Holy mother of FUD batman
only problem is institutional money doesn't give a shii about decentralization, in fact they dont trust it. This report doesn't help alleviate those issues.


THere's no need for the BIS in a world where Bitcoin === money
sloppy, why are you so bearish but said last time you voted the price will go up?
i believe that Bitcoin is not designed to be a payment system so the article misleads people that don't understand the technology yet and potentially turns them away from investing/particpating.  In some ways it makes you not think for yourself and remain a sheep.  IMO Bitcoin is best used as a store of value that stays in the vault.  Things like lightning, bcash, litecoin, ether and whatever else will take over from there
At least the manipulation thing is rather baseless.  At least nothing moreso than the stock market has been shown. Even that tether manipulation study was shown to be baseless and only correlative at best.
What do you mean by "what they want"?

If each side are getting trapped are you implying they want a stable price? Doesn't seem good for a trader. 
True.
You seem like a nice guy. 
No it's the Worldcup. Felt in e-commerce around the world 
I can imagine. I wasn't into crypto yet back then, started investing in 2016.
My point is that interest is waning, not only with investors but with developers and businesses as well. Yeah it was a bit of a rant but the topic seems very relevant to me.
Bitcoin is whatever we agree is Bitcoin. It is not whatever you (few) agree is Bitcoin. It's based on consensus, kind of like how Bitcoin is also based on consensus. It is not based on how particularly you decide to interpret a decade-old whitepaper.
Guy named AnusBeer is the voice of reason.  I love it
yes i agree bad idea, but the thinking is logical.  if i were just discovering bitcoin and became a believer, now is a great time to make a serious investment.  Even if it goes down to 5k.  You Can't time the bottom but the odds are in your favor that you are closer to the bottom than the top.  Mathematically speaking it makes sense to start buying big down here - high risk high reward
In Hawaii.
Yes I agree only buy if you can manage the financial risk and don't go bigger than you can comfortably handle.  Make sure you can at least pay all your bills for the next 2-4 years.  Other than that, going all in on Bitcoin and a few others is a great high risk high reward bet.  Although You must understand and believe in the technology to survive
ill up you 1k  - 101k
good point but problem is they only go to mortgage their house once it starts booming again where as now is the best time to do that if things pick up - even if we get one more drop down to 5k or wherever 
haha, that's alright. Better be warned twice, that's one helluva pinch on the 1 hr.

Just so everyone know. This account is also being sock puppeted by /u/arsonbunny.

Seen [here](https://i.imgur.com/q38HO8l.png).

This guy is a scammer and uses various accounts and purchases upvotes and gold for his own posts. 
https://i.imgur.com/q38HO8l.png

https://www.removeddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7osoap/i_created_a_fundamental_quantitative_valuation/

It seems Arson is using alts, though. Unless removeddit is unreliable (not sure why it would be- in any case, what are the chances the maker of removeddit is conspiring with gypsy to make arson look bad? lol) then he's clearly alt-ing and Arson literally just commented with an alt about 10 minutes on Pirate_Key.

I get that Gypsy is coming off as paranoid and overzealous but really, are we all just okay with some dude using who knows how many sock puppet accounts to facilitate fake discussion here?

Makes me feel kinda weird about the sub 

Reminds me of Unidan. Clearly Arson is a smart guy, just like Unidan, but I would personally prefer to see genuine discussion rather than some guy talking to himself. 

There's nothing inherently wrong with posting with an alt account, but *pretending* you're not the same person is...weird. 

edit: I do agree that there's a better place to be posting this though 
This isn't personal. This is sub housekeeping. 

Sorry that you're so defensive about arson for whatever reason. Should I add you to the growing list of accounts associated with him?
Mods, can we please ban GyspyToy. Not necessarily a perma-ban, but maybe say a month in the sin bin? He is wasting all of our time.    
Paging [u/jaderaj](https://www.reddit.com/user/jaderaj)
Just stop. This dirty laundry needs to be aired out.

Like I said, this is happening **currently**. In other words, if you scroll down a bit, you'll see this is happening in real time.

A of people care to know, including /u/jrice1515 and others who inquired earlier today.

Stop defending a scammer.

Even [Sloppy agrees](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ronjo/daily_discussion_sunday_june_17_2018/e0uevcu/?context=3).
[Looks like you got it wrong, dummy](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ronjo/daily_discussion_sunday_june_17_2018/e0uy8z2/). Mods don't care about the drama, they care about the sock puppets.
Considering that /u/jarederaj posted earlier that he asked gypsytoy not to engage with arson (which he blatantly ignored earlier today and now again)... Yeah. 
/u/the_ops_mommy & /u/sloppysynapses & /u/jarederaj 

Check this out. *Another* apparent sock puppet account. Have you ever seen this guy in this sub before? Does his history show any recent activity in this sub before this comment?

Does /u/arsonbunny not understand how obvious this behavior is? I guess he doesn't really have a choice. 

:/
They still haven't banned me! Can you believe that?
For pointing out **current** manipulation. i.e. happening right this second, further down this thread?

Get a clue, buddy. Mods have explicitly said that this type of sock puppetry is *definitely* not allowed.

edit: LMAO this is another rando account that just happened to wander into /r/BitcoinMarkets. Flag this one too, boys!

edit 2: when was the last time you posted in this sub? Never?


Actually a lot of people care. It's not drama. This sub is **overrun** with sock puppets. Some of us care about that. Even Sloppy cares at this point. 

I'm surprised you don't think this is highly relevant discussion for this sub. This is needed housekeeping. 
I get your point. I am starting with 1&#37; of my stack per short until i get used to it, so i think 5-10x would be fine for me. 

Which exchanges should i monitor to see orders and price fluctuations?

How to play around CME expiry date? like how many days before the expiry date it starts showing effects on the price.
i been reading up on quant theory and other f delights, you're supposed to size for worst case volatility then continue to reallocate your wins and deallocate as you lose, so you never risk ruin.

good luck doing that with bmex fees/spreads though

Yeah, i have been betting on sports for years now. I know 100x is straight gambling. :)
I have had a good share of moonbois and cheerleaders. Just fade them.
I assume you are one of said underwater shorts paying out the ass to stay in position. Good job.
On Mex its -.1% right now. 
More than it's moved in 2 days.
Why accumulate here when they can easily push this to <6k and buy there.
Yep we had this kind of downward movement yesterday too. I'm not convinced till we break 6300. Until then we're still in chop-chop land
Amateurs.  I have mine at $999999 because $1M just seems ridiculous, plus there's a huge sell wall at 1M which I'm undercutting. 
Ah yes, the sell 0.00000001 BTC at 40000 strategy. Because we can't really afford much more at those prices!
maybe, sub 6.3k we are out of fakeout zone
He's awesome and predicted tether, the awesome news. They released news of being awesome and everyone agreed it's awesome.
[deleted]
seems to be exactly what's happening...Ok....Next stop is 3k with a quick bounce to 7k and a slow bleed from then on to god knows where. 
Haha "bag holders." 

I'm being forced to hold a bunch of bags of traditional financial instruments that I know are about to go down the tubes until I'm 59.5 years old.  The Bitcoin bags? Well, the ones I held through the last bear market turned out to have great wealth in them.  
lol this was supposed to be a reply, not top-level. Sorry folks
How do you know it's not the bottom?
Haha that's totally fair. Where have you been, Topsy, I've missed you?
I'm highly skeptical of the possibility a AR could occur before a SC so I did some googling, and [*The climax is followed by an “automatic rally” (AR)*](http://ritholtz.com/2008/11/revisiting-the-wyckoff-spring/), or [*automatic rally (AR) follows the selling climax*](https://www.readtheticker.com/Pages/IndLibrary.aspx?jh65=MjAw&su23=Ng==&65tf=84), or [*Automatic rally After a selling climax, the market mounts a sharp snap-back rally.*](http://www.financial-spread-betting.com/trading/trendline-triggers.html). I could not find one case study of a AR preceding a SC though.

Moving on, placing the AR at the 6700 sure doesn't look bad, but I still have my doubts about it. Mainly because it comes right after the ST at 6300. Being above the AR resistance is not anomalous. Perhaps it's just better to ignore that first ST though, as that was just a wick, to establish the 6700 high as AR. 

Trading ranges are good. I concur we're well in phase B, but phase C is pretty likely to have springs imo because I doubt our bear market is over soon. In that case, I hope our springs won't really dip below 6k, because that'd be scary even if we're truly in a accumulation phase.
I'm not even implying someone should not publish whatever they want. It's a forum, it's obvious. And good luck with your trades. Just that you make some claims about an excellent opportunity but you also say the area is uncertain etc. Well, the market is always uncertain. And if it's excellent nothing should stop you from going for it. Are you waiting for someone to refute it or just make conversation about it?   
First, anecdotal theories is something... not good enough. Liquidity: can you substantiate it? Or are you just looking at one order book in one pair? Long/Short ratio: Shorts are still pumping, although I agree this can't last forever. And Longs don't look exactly bullish on the daily.  


When you are a good trader, you won't need opinions. There is only one measure: am I making money consistently and am I avoiding big losses when i'm wrong? if yes, you made it!
obviously noone's buying, miners keep mining, X% will hold 100-X% will sell, creating a net selling pressure until we reach cost of mining which is 600$.  At that point miners will close shop, sell inventory, crashing it to 0.



What's the difference? It always bugs me to update, but I know Gdax pretty well.
thank u for the explanation. This is my first “bear market” and yeah the orders going through on kraken look super weird from 1-2 months ago. Best of luck 
Waiting for 11K to confirm double bottom still. This is just noise. 
I meant parity, or shorts>longs, after a heavy dump and a bounce to lure greedy shorts (me).
I'm thinking I'll probably off myself if the same exact thing happens again. I really doubt it will, I would hope shorts would be more willing to defend $7k this time around 
So were longs then. The number is basically just open interest. The important part is the ratio. 
You can just set orders and wait my dude. I almost always have orders way out on both sides 
That's why I'm not adding. It's getting really tight between here and the bottom, rather not be caught with pants off.
Myself, I usually use a daily chart and go from the most recent swing high to the most swing recent low. 

Edit: And DO include the wicks!
I have no idea why. I just know that you normally draw them from a major top.
Better yet, click the camera icon in Tradingview (bottom of the screen).

Recently I used the April 1 bottom to the May 6 top as we appeared to be going to bottom again on first week of June. Since then there is no clear direction up so I'm not using FIB on any charts, BTC, BCH or ETH.

Edit: Since Friday I am all in fiat. Chart is just proven trendlines, Bollinger bands, Swing high/low resistance/support indicator by Patternsmart on Trading View.
Thanks.  I'll take a look at it and see what I can throw together.
Curious to see the institutional growth over time and with/against trends.
Thanks for your thoughts. They would be under the non institutional group. But I think they wouldn't short that much because even though it's a win-win situation for them no matter where the market goes, if market goes up their short would be liquidated right? So it seems like it would just be a small short.
"but there often exists a not-insignificant negative correlation between the direction of the price and the net positioning of large traders."


My summary of this new post you linked: **Having more shorts than longs or vice versa may not mean anything. Sometimes negative correlation.**
Looks like it might be another sock puppet account. Never seen this name and don't see any recent activity in BM. It's amazing that someone always shows up to congratulate arson. Never ceases to amaze me how much gold and praise this guy gets.

Seems. A. Little. Fishy. 

No...if you look through my post history I posted 4 times in the last 3 weeks ish. But I usually focus on the CC sub since I'm a noob to technical anaylsis...So usually post there.
This.
Fuck off. I'm not chasing anyone around reddit. I frequent this sub the same as anyone else. 

He's a phony and I've already proved it to mods. He was banned for the same behavior elsewhere. 

But go ahead and plug your ears and pretend that doesn't matter. That the integrity of this sub is in jeopardy with fuckheads like this one. This guy is a liar, shill and spreads **mis**information. Yet you don't seem to give af.
Ask Jared, he can post the logs about it if he wants. But I'm guessing he won't. 

inb4 sock puppets and vote brigades on *this* thread.
Ask /u/jarederaj. I gave him specifically all the details. He's welcome to post all of our chat logs about it. I'm washing my hands of this. This is absurd negligence on the part of the mods. I provided more than enough evidence *plus* this guy was already banned for doing the same exact thing in /r/CryptoCurrency. He is using sock puppet accounts, vote manipulation and even gilding himself. It's egregious and mods dgaf.

Fuck this place.


I never falsified any data or did any vote manipulation. I was temp banned for one day from /r/CC for something that happened 5 months ago after VeChain shills attacked me in a thread where I provided a relatively pessimistic valuation during peak bubble time.

Gypsy is a deranged individual who was banned for a month for doing this to me before:

https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8qyvqh/daily_discussion_thursday_june_14_2018/e0oqak0/

He trying to incite downvotes and getting people like you to add me to your "personal shitlist",  thus disregard when I provide sourced insightful data like in this post. This is what he does, he harasses and attacks people with ad hominems and conspiracies to try and erode trust in what they post, even if they fully sourced the post from a reputable site (CFTC) like I have here. He doesn't actually engage in discussion with good faith, just tries to slander.


edit: BTW  /u/jarederaj this is getting ricidulous.

Now in this very thread he is accusing a 7 year old account (older than mine for petes sake!) at being my alt

He is now going around accusing me of being endless accounts, and everyone who calls him out on his bullshit. I would love to be able to ignore him, but I can't ignore him if he attacks me and tries to get people to tag me ("add him to my personal shitlist" as this user says) and thus instantly downvote me in the future.

If removeddit is to be trusted (no reason why it shouldn't be?) then that is very clearly arson.  Basically 0% chance that's someone else. 
I feel like I’m sitting on the pot and straining really hard. 
I mean it's a very clear bear pennant since it formed after the move down 
thanks sloppy, good to have your insight
$250?  Why not $350?
Bear (ah) in mind if you're on Bitmex that they charge a fee every eight hours if you're in a perpetual contract, which can start to pile up after a while. Quarterlies don't have any fees
I’d say 8k ish then down. 
I’m long swaps that’s how to make easy money
Read the FAQ
> also OKEX used to have the highest volume on weekly

I don't think there was ever a period I'm aware of where the weekly contracts ever sustained higher volume than the quarterly contracts. Looking at the daily chart quarterlies have 2-3x the volume compared to weeklies.
Oh right, I was shorting when there was nice premiums lol.

I heard funding was good for shorts so I opened a perp position right at the break of the triangle and I guess that's when funding reversed hard. Saw the fees after one day and noped right out.

The fees make perps worthless to me. Especially when it starts to go sideways. I'm not a fan of the funding aspect of perps.
If there was no funding there is no reason why the perps would trade near bitcoin spot price: it could trade at 100usd or 100000usd
they take the average not what you see on a row. unless you did exact calculations then i'd trust the bitmex ones.
Why do you think that all hope must be lost before it goes up? Isn’t what makes the price go up is hope? I get it that we need some sort of a bottom but the sentiment that everything must go to toilet and BTC need to die before we go up is beyond me
There is Demand and Supply , S-curve adoption, 2020 halving! 
Okay guys, keep encouraging eachother and short the market. The only way is down, we all know that right?
Why would you hoard coins in a bullrun? You need to sell them.
You know you're making a bullish argument here, right? The higher the % of new coins that are being sold on a daily basis, the higher the "actual" value of BTC is since the supply is not being "artificially" restricted by miners hodling. 
Okay think about it like this. 

From a business point of view getting the best price for your product is always the best way, no matter what is being sold.

Why would they keep selling and drive the price down whilst flooding the market with more and more BTC, the very product they are working to create. 

Supply and demand my friend, why are diamonds so expensive? Because DeBeers and Co control the market supply.
Im sure i saw a video of jihan saying he never sold a btc he has mined(not sure if that includes his companies). Not sure if true or exactly what that means but i believe the footage is there if you want me to find a link. Other miners it makes 100% sense but im not sure how jihans business is structured. Hes really not a force to reckon with in the space unlesss they know what their doing.
Even weeks in Bitcoin could mean the difference between 100s and 1000s in the selling price.

Bitmain have income other than just selling BTC.
Think you jumped the gun a bit by a few days imo. Just check again.
I can't tell if you're agreeing or disagreeing with me :P we basically said the same thing.

I also think most of these flags aren't actual flags. The volume drop off in relation to the pole volume is extremely disproportionate and flatlines IMMEDIATELY rather than slowly tapers off, which is more of what a flag should be like, I think. 
> But the fact that the rest of the ecosystem is respecting this particular bart up and not dragging it down... still represents a pretty strong bull flag, right?

That's the thing, I don't really get it. No one is really respecting the price movements. They just buy and sell like they did 10 minutes before it happened. Makes 0 sense to me.

And clearly the barts don't matter because the success rate of flags on shorter time frames is probably somewhere around 20% lately. 

I would thing "the fact that the price did not decrease" is a misleading indication. Sellers show up en masse randomly after climbing for a while. They figure, well if people will keep buying why not wait to sell higher? So they do. And then they all show up at the same time and scramble to sell high and then it just tanks. 

It's done that the entire way down from $9k
He's getting nervous about his posiition I think. The more cock sure he gets the closer he is to capitulating
Zero to $6500 in less than ten years. I'm serious, bro, and if you had been in this game half as long as I, so would you be. 

That being said, thank you for your attempt at TA, but you will quickly learn that traditional TA is pretty much worthless in this market at this point. What you need to be looking for is actual coin flows. Understanding what's happening in the chain will make you a lot richer than any head and shoulders ichimoku cloud bullshit in this market. Sorry to be harsh, but that's just how it is.
The amount of power used isn't a function of the number of transactions processed.

If the whole network was just your laptop it could still process the same amount of transactions as the current network.

Scaling for more uses is unrelated to power used. (It does take done more power for more transactions but it's a very very very minor part of the power used)
1) energy sources are quickly turning entirely renewable.

2) mining is likely to be regulated

3) mining rewards decrease over time

4) mining needs to stay just power and decentralized enough to stave off issues

5) the current mining trajectory is partly due to ASIC manufacturing improves and more widespread availability. I remember in 2013 when ASICs first came out. It was a massive jolt to the system and video cards were shit out of luck (hence pressure to pump alts). ASICs are still improving and being distributed. I would expect this to plateau.

All of those issues mitigate at least *some* of the concern. Don't forget also, that PoW is the security mechanism. The fact that it's built on the expenditure of actual resources is the whole point. Ideally all hashing power is aimed at one coin. Enough power where anything close to a 51% attack is not feasible and unprofitable. This provides the most durable chain, with the least possible vectors for attack. One PoW chain to rule them all.
As ever it's bursting with so many comments that are so cookie cutter you could feed the Chinese army for a month if you baked 'em. 
>only problem is ~~institutional money~~ the average consumer doesn't give a shii about decentralization

FTFY
Mainly thought there could be a fakeout upwards or a relief rally. There still could be, too, but it's beginning to look less likely to me.

Also, that article in general sums up most of my bearishness on btc, which is why I would really genuinely love to hear anyone who can present any argument against it
It builds a solid floor from which to launch.
Uh they want the stop losses? Nothing else to conclude for now.
You've been outrageously spoilt. One day you will be again. 

My first buy was a few weeks before the 2013 bubble. I started off thinking 'fuck me, does it do this *all* the time?

How little I knew...
Theymos fucked up, Bitcoin Core fucked up.  The visionaries and builders have been disenfranchised and kicked out.  However, this is a another topic for an other place.
It's logical if the decision to become a believer is logical. And for most people, it's not. The rest of your logic really isn't logical at all. You're assuming that it'll go higher than it is now, regardless of how low it falls.  That's a tremendous assumption.  How are you over 50% certain that it's closer to a bottom than a top, regardless of what level that bottom is?
Plenty of room between the start and end of the race.
The real problem would be if you went to mortgage your house and then the whole thing crashed to literally zero -- which is, believe it or not, not impossible -- however unlikely you might think it is. 
Just thought it was odd it seems to be respecting both trends but haven't touched it since Friday 
Heads up, you're talking to arson.
Regardless of whether or not arson is guilty - if he is, sure, go ahead and ban him - gypsy's behaviour is not okay. It's childish, petty, ridiculous and pretty much a vendetta/witch hunt at this point. The mods have said that they've told him not to engage with arson *and* they've taken it to the admins, what more does he fucking want at this point? I come here to read what people have to say about the market, not to see gypsy posting every few hours because he can't behave like an adult. 
Who cares man. Let the mods sort it out, as far as I'm concerned the guy made a very interresting post in this sub, what happens elsewhere is none of my concern, I'm not from the internet police.

What's next, public shaming and asking to get /u/randombtcguy banned because he made a racist or anti-abortion post somewhere else?

None of our business.
Posting from alt accounts is a violation of TOS if vote manipulation is involved. That seems likely to be the case here.
> There's nothing inherently wrong with posting with an alt account, but pretending you're not the same person is...weird.
> 
> 

It's immoral actually. Purposefully misleading people is not okay. When it's this egregious it needs to be taken out like the trash.
Lol, now you're getting downvoted too. Welcome to the brigade, son!
>This isn't personal. This is sub housekeeping. 

Doesn't seem to be directly relevant to daily trading discussion. Please use another thread. 
You are not responsible for the sub "housekeeping"."No accusations of rule violations . . Calling out other users for breaking our rules is not allowed. . . Instead, please report rule violations" that is written in the sidebar. If you reported him then drop it. Almost every time he posts, you answer with this crap. That IS stalking. Act like an adult and get over it. 
u/jarederaj
Lmao, you didn't even tag Jared properly *and* Jared already said that the behavior I documented from arsonbunny is completely unacceptable. It's now been proven many times over and I'd expect arson to receive the ban.
No, *you* fucking stop. The mods have heard your complaints. They've taken it to the admins. One of the mods says *right* in that comment that you've been told to knock it off. This right here is you blatantly ignoring the mods for the sake of your little witch-hunt. Nobody here is defending arson - to be 100% clear, if he's using alts then I am *perfectly fine* with him being banned - I'm just calling out your ludicrously childish behaviour. 
They told you not to engage with arson, you still did. The fact that they aren’t doing anything about their own instructions to you is on them and their decision. 
Still not banned though. 

:/


Hmmmm, I wonder why...

and it looks like arson's account is suspended.... Hmmm

Was I right all along?

Look! The same exact people are defending arsonbunny again! I wonder why??

Also, look at this poster's history. Looks like it's his first visit to BM. What a surprise!!!
Mods, while you are here I suggest you consider sin-binning gypsy for a week or so.
This is my first visit here so I must obviously be someone's soc poppet right? Honestly this level of drama is not needed and turns new visitors off from returning. But hey if this sub's mods are OK with you having your own lil witch hunt who am I to judge?
Judging by all the downvotes, and people saying that they don't care, I'm gonna say that most people don't care. 


And if you really think it's that big of a deal then talk to the mod directly. You aren't making it any better by spamming the sub.
> Which exchanges should i monitor to see orders and price fluctuations?

I pretty much primarily watch bitfinex.

That's a (weak) theory in my opinion, and I'm sure you can find some more info by googling it. I don't have any available because I don't believe it has any/much of an effect 
reallocate as in de-risk/move assets out? 

What do you mean by re/deallocate, both of them seem like they could be used to mean "move funds out" :p
Did you just hacked me?
[deleted]
Can they? We haven't seen anyone "easily push it below 6k" this year. Also, they may want to accumulate without threatening avg investor confidence in order to be able to distribute higher.
Well, it's possible that when we got close to $6k last time, the hypothetical accumulator saw that the buying pressure from the rest of the market was too high and would have messed up their buys since they would have had to compete with people trying to catch the bottom. It would be in an accumulator's best interest to make you think that under $6k is inevitable, but then we just won't get there (in the short-mid term)
Easily? 
Brilliant haha
The last few dips into this rsi on the 15min seem to have bounced pretty well. May be a quick long scalp opportunity.
What am I reading lol
No, no it doesn’t seem like there is a trend when there is literally one data point you are basing this on. 
Only in your mind does that seem to be the case.
Yeah because in the event of a stock market crash, BTC will fly won't it.

I mean investors will be flocking to cash out their >50&#37; losses from stocks to throw it into the most speculative market on earth.
this is the type of thinking i respect.  seriously great perspective and most ppl have never thought this way  
!short test 6600

Hijacking this post to check why your positions aren't being sent as notification
Because all bounces from the 6 range have been fully retraced and we have gotten close to 6 too many times. If we had broken 11.7 on the first bounce then it could very well have been the bottom. Now, it is weaker and weaker support every time we bounce from it, it will break on the next 1 or 2 tests. Also, we broke a 5 month triangle to the downside with targets well below 6k. 
I lost interest in this sub because it turned into a bulltard circlejerk of zero value. Looks like the sentiment is slowly becoming a little more balanced.
No no, I concur. The second AR "actual" makes more sense. The first one marked as "anomalous" simply didn't do anything for the range. And "Actual" defined it.

I'll post an 'evolved' chart later today. Many thanks for your input. Little coop always feels encouraging, especially in this market.
That's completely dependent on what 'X' is. Net selling pressure doesn't mean crashing to 0.
They look identical to me
Yeah. Now it's just like...either situation will loook obvious in the end. 

Dump? "oh duh they made former shorts scared so they could dump on em" 

Pump? "Idiots got shorts squeezed again" 
I would hope so, IF they are watching.
But say it moves one direction and the orders get filled. You would want to repopulate them after it rebounds. I've got it all automated so I don't have to sit watching GDAX.
If started assembling a long on swaps on wicks down for funding and to hedge against the underwater short. Still 3:1 short though. 
That would be interesting to see as well, I'll make a post on it soon. 

Maybe create a graph of longs/shorts spread among the categories to get a view of the trend. The only thing is the CME Commitment of Traders reports only go back to like March on the CFTC site :( 
More sock puppetry. Arson does this in all his posts. 

"Wow, sir, you're a genius! Can I stroke your ego more, mister?"

Something along these lines never fails to show up. Whether it's /u/g0nnagetya, /u/MissReal, /u/scyrim or any of the other ones. Pathetic. 

I'm talking about mining warehouses where their entire operation is mining. But yeah probably still a small percentage. 
Dude I didn't even look at this guy's name before I posted. I mainly post in dota 2 subreddit because I play that game....look at my name it literally has the game dota in it.
Don't mean to jump on everyone in this thread, but pretty skeptical of people giving arson praise, given that I've noted about 20 sock puppet accounts of his at this point.

Really? I have no horse in the race, but would like to better understand what is happening. /u/jarederaj, something worth addressing as time allows?

Happy Father's day to all as well, for whom it applies. 
Wow look at all this evidence I'm convinced guys
I enjoy your analysis, but I did just want to try and get a straight answer from you: Did you at one point reply to your own comment in an attempt to make it look like someone else did?
Well, that was almost as much of a rabbit hole as learning blockchain and an hour that I am not sure how I feel about spending.

I guess a bear market and tough trading environments lead to this kind of shit. 
> Now in this very thread he is accusing a 7 year old account (older than mine for petes sake!) at being my alt

Right, because buying karma'd accounts isn't a thing right?

You are a bullshitter and you know it. Actually, everyone with a head on their shoulders know it. Only the lowest hanging fruit could be fooled by you at this point. 

You have made so many rookie mistakes (messaging from the wrong accounts. lmao!) that you're an embarrassment even as a liar. Even the liars would be ashamed to have you.

Stop trying to scam and manipulate people.

DERP.

Calling /u/arsonbunny  to explain and /u/jarederaj to shake his head in disappointment. 
[deleted]
Oh for sure. What I meant was I'm not sure I really trust it at this point anyway. It's mostly been flagging sideways for a day now without even touching support, and we're almost to the end of the pennant. So I doubt we'll get a violent push one way or the other on a breakout, maybe a couple hundred bucks at most.
because that's not the average price of every day in its existence..? I mean I don't agree with his analysis but he explained it right there, haha 
I'm on Bitfinex. Currently not using funding, just my own balance (so no funding costs).
Too much resistance between here and 8k IMO
Could you explain more about this?
nah I know how they work it's just every time I looked, swaps were even with index. 
It's nice when it goes my direction but I wonder if it's worth it. If we do continue to go down from here swaps will probably be bearish as fuck and funding will still suck, so I am very close to closing it. I'm thankful I put like 80% of my positions on futures. 
You could just base liquidation off of mark price though nah?


nah I was mainly just bitching and happened to look at the wrong times is all 
There is demand? You need to do some research. Who's adopting cryptocurrency? Retail is dropping it. When was the last time you saw a big name adopt any crypto as a payment option? Pornhub and Verge comes to mind as the only thing this year, but Verge paid Pornhub to do this...Basically a scam/publicity stunt in my opinion. 1000+ projects and a huge empty chamber of exactly zero adoption in 2018.

China is into the supply chain coins and they really are trying to integrate those in their cities. We'll see how that goes in a few years, but it will do nothing for crypto market on its own. Also excited for OmiseGo prospects. A few success stories together could jump start the bull for everyone.
The only way is up. Though not this week.
If the only way was down we wouldn't need a trading sub
Ah, really? YOu are aware that there are miners that have been collecting coins since when they wre like a dollar a piece? Why would you sell the coins DURING a substantial run? Do not assume miners are idiots.
And why sell them in a bear market with low liquidity when the price can be moved down so easily. 
???

Miners will never be incentivized to hold. That is the entire point of rewards from mining. 

Electricity costs money- it will never be free to mine. There's nothing *potentially* bullish about it. It only has the potential to drag prices down.

It's bullish that the price has largely increased over the past few years despite miners selling coins.

But if money stops flowing into the space, prices will naturally drop. Either people have to be paying lots of fees from transactions or people have to be buying bitcoin. 

You kind of have it backwards I think- it's been bullish that we've overcome the selling pressure. But it's not indicative of the future. there's no guarantee new money will keep flowing into the space 
>Supply and demand my friend, why are diamonds so expensive? Because DeBeers and Co control the market supply.

That would make sense if everyone could only buy their Bitcoin from miners. Miners own only a fraction of what is potentially up for sale and buying a second-hand Bitcoin is not inherently different than a freshly minted one nor does it have any negative social stigma. I think the miners are more at the whim of the market than the other way around. If every miner in the world refused to sell, it won't end a bear market and new highs are not a guarantee, unlike their operation costs.
~~Shovel salesmen~~ Miners don't have the ludicrous ~~sunken cost~~ HODL mentality of reddit gamblers.
>Why would they keep selling

Because mining is not free? It's using some 1% of the entire world's electricity right now. 

I don't get why people seem to think miners could just mine forever without selling. 

even so, if miners "hodl" that supply is still there, waiting overhead. They could only wait for a certain amount of time and hope for a new bubble cycle. 

There'd still be a massive supply of coins ready to be dumped on the market in the end. 
Yeah, we'll have to see how this week goes.  We could just  range for a while before a breakup. 
Yeah; douche bag attitude going to leave you rekt
Do you post anything here that doesn't show how completely clueless you are?
A decent chunk of posters here have "been in this game" longer than you, and most share your long-term bullish outlook...we just don't share your myopic view and piss-poor commenting style. It's possible to be uber-bullish on a yearly time frame while being bearish or neutral on the 1H, 1D, etc.

Also traditional TA has done exceptionally well in Bitcoin (though maybe less so this year due to the inevitable rise of HFT algos, etc.), more so than for traditional markets, because the Bitcoin price has been primarily psychologically/speculatively driven. Ask anyone that's been actively trading Bitcoin for more than a couple of years, and I'm sure they'll agree.
Right, okay, thanks. So the power used is mainly a matter of network security right? As in, the more miners the more secure the network, yea? And as price goes up, more people mine because it becomes more profitable to do so.

If bitcoin's price continues to soar, does the difficulty ever catch up? It doesn't linearly increase so as to maintain *true* pure equilibrium right/ As in, there's nothing to stop the network from growing quicker than the price grows?

Are there any models or predictions on what power consumption would look like if bitcoin did eventually see widespread global usage? As in, if the price really did reflect largescale real world usage and miners followed suit? 

This comment may be kind of a mess, sorry if it doesn't make sense. Thank you for your response. 
Thanks man. Does the mining difficulty increase linearly with price? As in, if the price increases exponentially is there an exponential growth in miners/power consumption? 

Say, if we rocketed to $50k, would mining power consumption increase with that? 

But I do get that that would specifically be mitigated by mining rewards decreasing over time 
you said somewhere else that you are back in Bitcoin, and have more Bitcoin than ever before, why does this go together with your bearishness, risk a long for a potential relief rally, which might or might not happen?
Thanks. The stop losses/stop limit on both bearish/bull side then.
my opinion is based on my experience since i started in this space a little over a year ago.  There were two significant corrections i went through and now this is the third.  This one being the most serious.  Based on what the first two corrections were like, it would make sense that we are at or close to the bottom. Maybe it hits 5k but i doubt any lower.  i remember buying in at like 2900 and being so pissed when it corrected to 1900.  then it stayed down close to 2k for awhile and i was too scared to buy more...i learned that lesson the hard way.  Right now is a great time to go in with a heavier position if history will repeat itself.  I do think though that the recovery could be confusing and take  a longer time frame, up to 6months to 4 years.  So any money i put in is prepared for the worst case scenario of holding for 4 years
id be able to transfer 0 value to anybody in the world 
His behavior is very confusing. Why pretend to be a bullish noob? I don't get it 
That's pretty fair, and basically what I've told him as well
A witch hunt for a proven fraud? 

Lol, you realize that term is only applied to innocent people, right?

Arson isn't innocent, it's been proven many times over at this point.

It's super interesting that here you are defending arson from being lambasted *again*, and vehemently so.

Why do you feel the need to defend arson like this? 

/u/sloppysynapses Notice that the same people who jumped in last time are jumping in again this time.


Hmmmmm....
Mods are not all knowing, and the impact of alt accounts is an issue that the sub seems to be trying to ignore. Even if it's not an issue with ArsonBunny (which it is to some degree), it's still happening and it's relevant to observe. We should at least talk about it instead of shutting down people who are negatively affected.
[removed]
It relates to other comments made in this daily and a scammer who is making a fool of many in this sub. 

It's pertinent.
Here we go again. Same people stepping up to defend arson. Why?

Why is it always the same accounts? Why do these accounts want to remain willfully ignorant of repugnant manipulative behavior aimed at deceiving crypto reddit. 

Give me a break. Go after the bad guy, you fool.
Thanks.
Lol, you want me to be banned for pointing out manipulation and fraud?

Some people... I tell ya... they just have their priorities totally backwards. 
Haha, I never noticed that he was Jared, I have always read that as Jaderaj. How funny to only notice it now. I prefer Jaderaj so I think I'll keep using that.

I don't know or care about arsonbunny, if they deserved a ban then I'm glad they're gone. I care about your behaviour, which is also ban worthy.
Then report it. I'm going to say what needs to be said. If mods want to ban me over that then that's fine. 

People in this sub need to understand what's happening and the level at which it's happening.

Don't be so willfully ignorant. This is valuable information according to many in the sub. Just because it doesn't interest *you*, doesn't mean it doesn't interest others.

Go spend your time complaining about something else. Report this and move on if it doesn't interest you.

Also, I don't care if it's childish. Fight fire with fire.

Are you really trying to allege that the thirty-something woman from Canada who also posts in relationships in her spare time is also arson, who mostly posts here? 

By the way, [nice try](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/7t22tt/daily_discussion_friday_january_26_2018/dtaz35g/). [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/7vc6bs/daily_discussion_monday_february_05_2018/dtt1oda/) as well. Took me thirty seconds on google to show you that I've been here for months, that's why I'm familiar with your aggressive commenting. 
Gypsy, this doesn't help your case. Codeverity is a prolific commenter in various subs, look at their comment karma. I've spoken with them before in here months ago.

I've seen them active on other random subs in the wild, too. Definitely not an arson account. Codeverity does have a point that there's no *real* need to air this out in public. 
Firstly, I don't care.

Secondly, *why*? I did this sub a solid by discovering and revealing this.
Just stop, this has already been proven way beyond a reasonable doubt. If you're new here then you don't understand any of the context and you just shouldn't comment on it. 

Good day, sir.
Yeah, duh, it's at least partly because arson sends his downvote brigades and sock puppets to do his bidding. That's kinda my whole point.

I've already tried taking this to the mods directly. It didn't get handled the first hundred times I reported it to them and it hasn't been handled yet.

Sorry you don't agree with it but I think this is extremely valuable information for people to be aware of. As much as any TA or anything else. This relates to the health of the sub that most of us want to remain as genuine and honest as possible.

Perhaps you're just not aware of the whole story when it comes to arson.

Either way, sorry you think people don't care. I know for a fact many that do. 
[Mods seem to care](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ronjo/daily_discussion_sunday_june_17_2018/e0uus6b/). 

:/
if you make gains you're suppose to buy more because your stack can now assume more risk, if you lose you're supposed to downsize your position (taking a loss).  
"have hacked"

but:

"did hack"
I'm aware it changes you just said funding is cheap for shorts when its currently expensive as fuck
Keeping the price up during a slow bleed could also be to play with the psychological effect ?

For example: if the price drops from 10K to 5K in 1 week, that would probably result in a big shock and panic selling all over. If you do it in smaller steps (slow bleeding) during the year, psychologically, it may feel less bad. Now, if during this slow bleeding the price sometimes pushes back up, most people will hold and believe that it will reach a new all time high soon. However, the slow bleeding could go on for many months, with now-and-then some pushbacks, but at the end resulting in lower prices every month. 

Eventually it will probably go up again but the question is: are people willing to wait many months or years?

Disclaimer: i'm pretty bearish at the moment. :-)


Pretty sure average investor confidence is very threatened right now.

In all fairness, you will never see a trend if you don't collect data.
Yes there is no trend here. You are correct. Now runoff and play little fella.
Is my test position making any money?

Any my positions specifically aren't being sent as notification?
Nice. U shorting?
fair enough, you in a position currently?
I look forward to see your new chart today! Especially with the BGD we just got, it's going to be interesting.

Cheers
Oh does coinbase pro work in app too?
I think we can safely say that in either case, there will be tons of people posting  on reddit about how obvious it was.
Oh yeah that's cool dude I don't have a life so i just relog into bitmex every time it signs me out  
That's not such a bad idea. I'm basically not trading on weekends but those $100 moves would be perfect for scalps.
Fake accounts.
Fair enough, like I said, I don't mean to falsely accuse anyone. I'm just highly skeptical given what's going on with arsonbunny at the moment (massive manipulation and sock puppet campaign being uncovered).
I have seen his post before removed on CC but that was months ago and maybe people change? I honestly didn't look at this name just the content. Although looks like another reply showed there may be negative correlation so this info is just that, info. No correlation possible to use for trading. Anyways, I think just move on. If he does it again then sure, but I'm not a sock puppet. 
This whole thing us overly complex. I've been trying to avoid taking any action at all. At one point an account jumped in with hate speech and harrasment against gypsy. That account attempted to cover it up. When gypsy pointed it out I immediately perma banned then.

The conflict goes way back. GypsyToy was specifically asked to not engage with ArsonBunny. Admins have already been brought in to sniff out alt accounts. They may or may not be in process with that still.

If there is an issue with systemic alts being used in the sub I want that resolved. What Gypsy is describing is possible. I'm not sure how to prove it.
[and even his analysis in this very post was debunked](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ronjo/daily_discussion_sunday_june_17_2018/e0u59eg/)

OP is a big ol' phony, just like I said.
I would implore /u/jarederaj to share *all* of the evidence I provided to him. It's overwhelming and there are several smoking guns and yet mods don't act. I can only imagine either conflicts of interests or complete ineptitude.

If Jared doesn't respond, I'll PM everything to you guys or just make a public post elsewhere complaining.
Here is just some or arson's many flubs. This doesn't even get into all the fake screenshots he was posting before I put an end to that. 

Regardless, here's a sampling.

A look. Another random account shows up to defend arsonbunny. How fitting!

When was the last time you visited BM, if I may ask?

/u/jarederaj can provide the info that I provided him. He doesn't want me posting it publicly he said.
Real talk, when was the last time you were on BitcoinMarkets? Why did you suddenly decide to show up on arson's behalf? 

Seems that you haven't stepped foot in this sub in... I dunno. Look at that history of yours /u/Tritez 

Who are you?
https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8qyvqh/daily_discussion_thursday_june_14_2018/e0p4h6r/

I've already gone through this.

At one point? No, at *many* points. This guy buys accounts and votes. He's a fucking liar. He was also the same person who used to post faked BitMEX screenshots. 

You're a smart fellow, Soccer Man. Don't believe this bumbling retard who PM threatened me from the wrong account and then deleted the account entirely. Fuck this moron.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6VjPM5CeWs


And now you're latest attack is that I'm buying 7 year old accounts just because that person questioned your asinine conspiracies with no evidence. You're unhinged.

>Actually, everyone with a head on their shoulders know it. Only the lowest hanging fruit could be fooled by you at this point.

Then why must you follow me everywhere? If its so clear and obvious I'm scamming people here, why do you spend so much effort and time on making up conspiracies and baseless attacks?

>You have made so many rookie mistakes (messaging from the wrong accounts. lmao!) that you're an embarrassment even as a liar. Even the liars would be ashamed to have you.

You messaged yourself with an account you used to mock my arguement a few months ago, then deleted the account when I called you out on it. Stop lying.

>Stop trying to scam

What scam exactly am I running here by posting information from the CFTC site? What big secret do you think you've uncovered gypsy? I'm your "Moby Dick" right, and you deserve a "Pulitzer" for this right?
lol yea I'm genuinely starting to wonder how many people here are actually Arson. 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/VkPl6WsW/

this is one of the very few patterns I would actually trust- it's on a very high time frame compared to the 15m charts people around here use :P

volume profile is nearly perfect - it has been an organic taper instead of a bart with massive volume -> sideways  no volume
It's a three fifty joke.
can you not do that with Bitmex?
You are not thinking daily. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2711461.msg39999176#msg39999176
It’s an average over 8 hours

If you peep only once in a while then it doesnt mean anything

You could easily see on a chart the difference between swaps and index
You don't use a lot of leverage right? So why not use Bitfinex? Shorting is cheap there. 
No. Because there is no guarantee there would be convergence at all times. If there is no big leverage the situation could persist for a while and the market would lose confidence in the product
Speaking of BTC only, retail are lemmings that buy high at the peak of adoption curve.Unlike 2014, where sellers were cashing out for 'good', Cash is now sitting on the sidelines, most sellers looking to buy back in cheaper at some point, once supply of btc is absorbed at a certain price range (TBD), demand starts outpacing supply, the bubble will start again.
I was being sarcastic... 
Because the bills ain't gonna pay themselves.
Sorry for the confusion, that's what I meant. It's bullish that we've overcome the constant selling pressure.
> buying a second-hand Bitcoin is not inherently different than a freshly minted one nor does it have any negative social stigma

That's not entirely true. Bitcoin isn't fungible and second-hand coins have a history. That can carry risk for certain buyers (the ones with the most money like regulated investment funds). Some buyers specifically seek out virgin coins directly from miners.
True, but they do have control on the supply of new coins in to the market.

I still think that the amount of people that are holding will be increasing; 3rd world countries etc

And this is the organic growth we need to keep going up, be it slower than we'd like but still.
Lol, this is a perfect example of how fake news works.

You take a tiny part of the paragraph and turn it in to an entire question with no substance that tangents off without the rest of it.

I obviously know why they sell that isn't that hard to understand, the point I'm making is that its just driving the price down for themselves as well as others.
Same. However things are getting pretty tight on the 1d so I can see your point. Good luck buddy. 
Yup he basically called me a dipshit just cause I asked about funding. Never even said much to the dude...
Yes even when the earth is desolate and depleted and a crypto-mining dyson sphere obscures the sun, BTC will be doing 3-4 transfers/second. HODL!
It's tricky because of 

1) reward halvenings 

2) manufacturing delays/bottlenecks 

2a) manufacturing centralization / control

3) energy arbitrage / mining centralization

4) Bitcoin dominance (and sha-256 mining percentage)

6) Fee markets, especially as block rewards dwindle

5) a lot of other variables

I don't honestly have a good answer, I just know that miners follow the market and there are many factors to consider when trying to predict how hashing power is likely to grow and what equilibrium looks like.
I only have more bitcoin than ever because I been shorting it a lot :P

The main reason I don't want to long is because there's a decent chance this falls through the floor- but if it goes up I believe it will be a slow grind/arduous way up. 

It's possible I Could be wrong but I'm fairly sure if it does go up I will have ample time to exit my short and reconsider 
> my opinion is based on my experience since i started in this space a little over a year ago. 

Do you not feel embarassed typing this shit out? I cringed.

You're trading on feels. You have close to no experience. Your assumptions are literal guesses not any better than gambling on blackjack.

At least you know the odds when you hit up the casino. What you're trying to do is literally inferior to a coinflip.

I would suggest reading what the smarter people have to say here and researching deeper the concepts they bring up.
Even if bitcoin is the 'best' solution to something, does not mean it will do what you think it will do. And it being the best at anything is debatable to say the least. 

Betamax was considered better quality than VHS, but even with Sony backing it, Beta ultimately lost.

There is no single investment, at all, that anyone should go all in on.

But yes, I'm long term bullish, just not in a house mortgage kind of way. 
This correction is nothing like any corrections in 2017. It's not comparable in any way whatsoever, so careful with the comparisons and thinking that it'll get back up any moment now since blah blah. I'm medium (EOY) and long-term (next halving+) bullish myself, but it's for a whole bunch of other factors rather than hoping that 'history will repeat itself' with 2017 in mind. 
Honestly, isn't it a bit worrisome that you aren't thinking about transactions, cryptography, adoption, or fundamentals of any sort? Please don't mortgage your house.
[deleted]
Not sure but likely it's part of a broader strategy that is hard to see by looking at individual components. Make things seem mildly *this* way, upvote *that*, comment positively regarding *this*, etc. 

Remember, the 10-15 accounts I've confidently outed so far are just the obvious ones. Who knows how many more and what exactly the network of participants looks like. As I've already noted though, arson has bought and puppeted his way to fame on /r/CryptoCurrency. Don't think for one minute that any of that is legitimate. He gets the ball rolling in the first hour or so and then lets the votes and support snowball into something more. 

It's not like most of us didn't know this was going on but here is a clear case with multiple accounts linked directly to arson and many more that look suspicious. 

If mods don't act after *this*, my head will explode. I already sent all of this to CC mods too. Hopefully both subs crack down heavily.

edit: also, is arson going to delete these comments and account when he realizes that he made a big mistake? Or is he going to leave it up and make up some excuse? "uh I wasn't feeling so great at work, so I decided to launch an extensive sock puppet campaign. I've never ever done anything like this before, I'm just having a bad day."
The thing that's funny is that if he'd just say 'hey, I have these issues', give them to the mods and then shut up about it, I wouldn't have an issue. But I don't come here to read threads that are 80 comments long with the two of them bickering, you know? And anytime anyone disagrees with him he accuses them of being a sockpuppet, which is hardly mature. It's been sent to the admins and he should just leave it at that.
Did you even read my comment? I'm not here to defend arson, I just said that I'd be fine with him being banned if he's proven to have broken the rules. I'm here to point out that you are ignoring what the mods have told you to do, and seem to not get that at this point you have to wait for the mods or admins to make a decision. It's not up to you and incessantly posting about it doesn't change that fact. 
Again, beware that you might very well be talking to an arson associate, so to speak. Look at how vehemently some of the posters defend arson. "Who cares" "Gypsy is the bad one here". It sounds like a bunch of bullshit. 

To characterize what arson has already been caught doing, and *only* the stuff he's been caught doing, as "to some extent" is a huge understatement. The fact that we only know what he stupidly let be know is extremely troubling. This guy runs game over on /r/cc and has manipulated and deceived who knows how many people. Pretending your someone else and manipulating votes is so beyond the pale, especially of crypto (skin in the game) subreddits. This guy appears to do it to wide effect. 

This is some shameful shit.
[removed]
*how* are his posts *in this forum* (specifically, the ones you have been commenting on) scamming and making a fool out of people?  Did somebody lose $10,000 because of CME trade data earlier today?  

If he is pushing alts and trying to back up his case using throwaway accounts, then sure, call him out on it *in that particular thread*, but there is **zero** need to create drama in every single post.  Maybe someday UNICEF will get into the crypto scene, but until then, it is each individual's responsibility to DYOR and decide what is credible and what is not.
No I was correcting his spelling
I don't see how you can think that outing scammers for what they are is ban-worthy. 

I'm doing people on this sub a big favor by putting together all the evidence and letting everyone know that Arson is scamming people and the various accounts that are associated with him (are him).

Many people on this sub think this is a public service... because it is. Fraudsters and manipulators have no business in this sub and have no business taking advantage of people.
[removed]
 *[shaking the magic 8 ball](/r/Magic8Ball2k7/)*  

 Well, obviously, yes.
Fair enough. I'm a bit trigger happy at the moment and didn't mean to actually accuse you. Though I still find it interesting that you repeatedly show up to tell me to stop pointing out that Arson is a scammer.

Why? Just downvote, report and move on? Why would you defend a scammer to whatever degree you are by trying to stifle conversation?
Fair enough on the point of being a legitimate poster, I wasn't actually leveling that accusation.

However, there is good reason to air this publicly. This is how I came to learn of all the other examples of him being caught through other posters comment. Hell, you just provided me with that screenshot because we were airing this in the daily. 

This is a much needed discussion / post that needs to take place. People need to understand that this guy is actively trying to manipulate and scam people across various crypto subs.

NOT OKAY.
I don't need to be a long time participant in a sub to know when someone is making a fool of themselves.
Good day 
I downvoted you, and I'm not a sock.  


Trust me, there's more than enough real users who don't want to see this kind of childish bullshit that sock puppet explanations are not really required. Occam's razor.
That's...very interesting. It's an interesting counterpoint to people who think you should double down on losses and reduce risk on wins. It also probably helps that it's better for your mental state to double down on wins and reduce risk on losses, too, although that's not quant stuff. 

Where'd you read about this? 
This feels more like denial 
I know you can't defend it, you don't have keep digging yourself into this hole. You don't have to keep making it more and more obvious with silly comments. Please just stop replying. 
I'll delete that position in a bit.
There were a few channels that were messed up but now all should be fine.
I'm short from 7500 of which I closed about half at 6200 and I'm going to add it all back on a bounce to 6800-6900.
Short as a white man’s penis.
Yup lol 
No, OP is a [serial phony](https://www.removeddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8qr0fd/new_york_times_university_of_texas_at_austin/e0opb9m/). The admins and mods are currently looking into it. This is no one-off thing.
I have already taken many steps to demonstrate this and it still goes on. Not only that but [arson's hand waving has been debunked yet again](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ronjo/daily_discussion_sunday_june_17_2018/e0u59eg/). 

Still, several random comments from random individuals like /u/Tritez (never seen previously, random ass account)  never fail to show up to praise, thank and gild arson and try to gaslight gypsy. Who could these random strangers be? 

The *mystery* continues.
[More](https://www.removeddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7osoap/i_created_a_fundamental_quantitative_valuation/)

Look at these comments from u/pirate_key. Guess which account just started posting in BM again today in support of arson? Yep you [guessed it](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ronjo/daily_discussion_sunday_june_17_2018/e0ucjt5/).


FFS, Jared, seek assistance and advice from the likes of /u/bashco or someone else who's dealt with this before. The list of sock puppets just keeps growing. Ban this fucker already.

In fairness to you, I know you were trying to be a bit more hands off recently and as a volunteer mod of this group of misfits (whom I all appreciate), not an easy gig.

After looking through the posts (who doesn't spend two hours doing that on fathers day?), it does seem like Mr. Bunny has multiple accounts. To what end? I have no idea since they obviously put some time into many of the comments. 

At least it was more interesting in watching the price today.
Fair enough 
I've been active on this account for 7 years...waiting for this very moment
In the time between my last comment you've edited your reply twice and posted a second reply once again targeting me as a puppet account...Truly take my advice to step back to heart, you will be much happier.
Yeah you made a terrible fucking excuse and it's not like you stopped there as I've already proven. Ms. /u/missreal.
I see. Well, we all make mistakes, and I appreciate you coming clean and admitting it.
I appreciate the kind words gypsy. Truthfully, your approach and style here does remind me of how I can be sometimes (I have obsessive tendencies, especially in perceived 'me against the world scenarios' which only makes it worse) Just a friendly reminder to try and take a breath and step back once and a while, brotha! ;) I'm saying this as a reminder to myself, too.
Unbelievably appropriate, love that movie. 

What a shit show. I think it worked out? Glad you did not have to ban Gypsy again....

Did Mr. Bunny get perma banned? Did not have a chance to dig through the weeds. 
Just report his comments to the mods. Both of you need to stop getting into huge long bickering comment threads with each other
> Then why must you follow me everywhere? If its so clear and obvious I'm scamming people here, why do you spend so much effort and time on making up conspiracies and baseless attacks?
> 
> 

People know because others point it out. In fact, this is exactly how I came to know about your shenanigans. Several others pointed it out.

Very similar to how the poster linked the /r/CryptoCurrency fiasco the other night. I had no idea that you were already banned for this over there. I'm indebted to that poster for providing me with the juicy story.


>You messaged yourself with an account you used to mock my arguement a few months ago, then deleted the account when I called you out on it. Stop lying.

I would never do this and everyone here knows that. I've never been accused of doing something so stupid by anyone else and there's absolutely no evidence that what you're saying is true. It doesn't even make sense. Why would I make accounts that support *you*?!

>What scam exactly am I running here by posting information from the CFTC site? What big secret do you think you've uncovered gypsy? I'm your "Moby Dick" right, and you deserve a "Pulitzer" for this right?

Like I said, I didn't say that the content of *all* your posts is fake, just a significant portion of it. You are attempting to build legitimacy with posts like this, so that dunces follow your opinions on shitcoins and such.

Fuck off already. You've been caught way too many times. Go start over with a fresh account or something. 
Better question, how many people in here are NOT Arson. Black Mirror episode, this whole time the sub has just been you and him(me). Talking in circles about shapes, the moon and goblintown.....Think about that for a minute.
Please start a thread for this. If it's a cluster fuck then I trust you'll take it down. I haven't looked at much over the weekend but I trust you'll make a reasonable post about what you've found.
Come on Sloppy, now's the time to return a bit of my sanity. 

I told you I wasn't paranoid and overreacting. 

If mods don't take action now, I don't even know....
[deleted]
Yeah, I'm charting on the 30m timeframe at the moment and I can definitely see that. You know I'm slightly bullishly biased for the next 2-3 days, but I'm just not sure this pennant is gonna break down to form new lows until we get another small short squeeze. I see a fakeout at most, but I know this isn't really supported by traditional TA. I'm a contrarian by nature, so I'll short with you once shorts stop gaining on longs.

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/BaGfG6Sz/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/BaGfG6Sz/)

EDIT: Ignore the non-purple lines, those are charted on the macro time-scale. (The pink like is a bit interesting I will say though. That was the ascending support we broke through at $7k. I still think it's possible we re-test that, even if it's not on the way down.)
lol that was a pretty far fetched attempt at a tree fiddy joke
I know I was just bitching tbh 
in the US :/
I just realized u can't arb unless there's a funding rate because there isn't a fiat pair
> retail

When I say retail  I don't mean the people, but the actual businesses. If you can't use Bitcoin to buy shit, it doesn't really matter too much whether a couple randoms buy it or not. It will only be a shortlived spike at best until people figure out they can't spend their currency.
Think you missed the point I was making, scroll back up the comments and read again. 
This is very true. I had considered it and I should've left that part out, but you're right. What I was kind of going for is that digital items aren't going to have the pitfalls of pysical goods - it's the same code no matter how many hands it passes through.
My bad. You're right. Miners will hodl until bitcoin recovers.
The worst part is, he might show up in August 2019 when things start bubbling again (assuming he doesn't get margin called and rage quit before then) and will loudly and obnoxiously tell everyone "I told ya so!" Doesn't matter that he might be wrong for a year straight, that BTC might hit $3K or lower, or that others might have tripled their BTC stack shorting or simply exiting the markets for a while and buying in lower. The guy writes his posts by hammering the button on one of those old-school one-button mice, and that button is labeled "up, up, UP!"
Thanks man. 

Also, for anyone reading this, I know gypsy seems paranoid lately but the parent commenter here is actually ArsonBunny. I don't really know why he's using this account to pretend to be bullish

who knows how many people here are Arson o_O
I did a bit of digging into this awhile back and there a number or good articles talking about legacy systems in the context of bitcoin and energy comsumption. Of all bitcoins potential scaling issues, this is one that does not bother me much. 

One reasonable example is [here](https://hackernoon.com/the-bitcoin-vs-visa-electricity-consumption-fallacy-8cf194987a50)
I've done a lot of research since i got involved and all i can say is that i believe we are close to the bottom.  although it could be a really slow and dramatic rise back to the top.  Bitcoin is either going to succeed or fail IMO, my bet is at the very least it will surpass last ATH's within 1-4 years.
valid points 
i agree its not as comparable because it correcting from the biggest ATH, as well as biggest introduction to mainstream.  However, I'm optimistic and see this correction as more of a premonition for things to come and as long as you can handle a 1-4year time horizon you will at the very least have an opportunity to sell at where you bought in
i don't have the balls to mortgage my house, but if i did now would probably be a descent time
The term is thrown around lots, but Dunning Kruger anyone?

*Okay, honey, hope you feel better! Love you...*
Yea agreed on that. I don't mean to encourage gypsy's commenting about him (because at this point people clearly don't care, just wanna talk shop which is entirely understandable) but mainly just want to expedite this whole process so we can get it over with and move on. 
That's fine. That's between the mods and themselves (and me to whatever degree). If they want to ban me or punish me. That's fine. 

It's incredibly hypocritical to tell me not to do the mods' work and then yourself try to play the role of mod.

Leave me alone, bro-ess.

If you don't like the comment, downvote, report and move on to move important things.
I am his brother. I've been debunked, game over.
[removed]
Unreal, here you are again defending him. If you look at his comment below, /u/the_ops_mommy debunked it. This guy is not only a scammer, he's also a clueless egotist. He's a fake. A fake genius, fake accounts, fake BitMEX screenshots.

Fuck this asshole. Stop defending him.
\>  Many people on this sub think this is a public service

Name one (in this case).
[removed]
I showed up the other day because arson tagged me and I got a notification about it. I saw your enormous thread earlier today and jared's comment that you'd been told not to engage with arson, so when you posted about it yet again I wanted to highlight that fact for others. 

I could say the same thing to you at this point - you've taken it to the mods and they took it to the admins. I'm not sure whether you actually think that posting about it over and over again gains you anything, but imo it doesn't. It just irritates people and detracts the daily from what we're actually supposed to be discussing. But on that note I'm going to leave this thread here because you're right, I don't want to be guilty of the same things.
Lol, you either are a sock or have no clue what you're talking about. Note that the mods are on top of this and have already contacted the admins. A handful of his alts already got banned.

Get a clue, dummy.
Lol, that's not proper employment of Occam's razor. 

AND how do you even know which accounts are real and which are soc puppets? I just demonstrated over the past 48 hours that *many* of the accounts people assume are real are in-fact fake. 

Sorry it pisses you off so much for someone to publicly out a scammer. 

It's kind of hard to believe an infrequent poster shows up out of nowhere and starts criticizing me for outing arson as a scammer. 

Are you sure you're not a sock? This is pretty strange behavior, tbh.
[deleted]
Dig myself into what hole? I have been shorting since 15k and continue to advocate it here. If digging myself into this hole means making money, then I'm all for more digging :) Keep hoping for this miraculous turn around that will never happen. 
Ugh... Not happy about this situation. There's still the issue of admins not confirming  that one way or the other. Really don't want to ban someone because of a witch hunt that's wrong. I'd feel really shitty about that.
I'll PM all of you asking for the info if he doesn't come through. 

I just don't have the patience to deal with this right now and I'm sure they're going to ban me for sounding the alarm again.
Convenient how many people show up just at the right time to defend arsonbunny. Random folks never fail to immediately take his side.
Seems that others in this thread have taken an objective look and come to the same conclusion.

Nice try, arson and/or arson associate! :p
Cheers, take care.

But now wait I'm a big shill, you see I actually hacked the CFTC site to falsify that data, all so you would lose money! Good thing we have gypsytoy here to protect you and cause you to disregard my evil shill analysis.
Yes, thank you. I appreciate you're analysis and humor as well. My votes indicate that I probably consider you the funniest poster other than my own dank memes.

You are right though. I am too emotionally invested at this point because I feel personally wronged and slandered by this whole situation. Which is why I'm going to leave the sub (possibly in a forceful manner) if this isn't better addressed by the mods, who I feel are acting extremely negligent in this regard. As I said elsewhere, I implore /u/jarederaj to make the case I made to the sub somehow. People deserve better than this. It shouldn't be okay to behavior like this with impunity. 

That's my take at least. If the sub disagrees then I don't belong here anyhow.
Seems like we're through it. What's amazing is that I have done absolutely nothing. Guaranteed this shit blows back on me somehow.
Actually he needs to be perma-banned from all major crypto subs. That's the solution to this persistent problem.
Lmao yes this but unironically 
actually lmao
I mean that's fine I know it's not 100% but there isn't really any particularly higher time frame TA that supports that this was a fakeout. At least I haven't seen any. The closest I've seen to anything legitimate are charts with wicks cut off (descending wedge, which are also not strong reversal patterns and the volume at the end has increased rather than tapered) and charts that assume the price will go up again (accumulation - guessing where the charts will go to fill out a potential pattern literally goes against the point of charting)

It's fine if you use your own stuff n all but contrarian trading would have gotten you completely rekt in 2017. Or at the very least you would've missed out on incredibly easy gains. Contrarian trading is good for ranging/symmetrical triangle consolidations. But right now the charts are indicating the market is likely to move down and a potentially strong trend is forming.

I think people got too used to contrarian trading lately- when btc finally makes a move it's likely going to trend hard like it *always* has. 
bitmex not for US either?
Lololol again, who is saying that's what they do???

The initial argument was about why people think that miners have such a huge impact that it is always brought up when the price is dumping or stagnant.

I was saying that not all miners will be selling as they can survive a certain amount of time weeks/months before they run out of money, bitcoin value can fluctuate a lot in this time.

The people controlling the price are the whales trading it no one else.
The prodigal son returns. Nice to have reasonable people in my corner again. 
I really dont see what kind of research you could have possibly done based on your analysis
Yes, the descent of your net worth!

If you do not understand something intimately, don't put all of your eggs into that basket. I point to Mark Cuban, successful entrepreneur. His mantra is to NOT diversify. Pick 1 investment and run with it.  Getting rich slow is for suckers - getting rich fast is what happens when your 1 investment works out.  But the key is that you REALLY know what you're buying. Like, many months, even years of research.  The kind of research that takes you on this progression:

"I know nothing about this investment" -> "This investment is great! I'll get rich!" -> "This is way more complicated than I expected it to be." -> "Ok, now I've done my due diligence and I understand it now" -> "Wait. There's all this other stuff to learn too? I need to know all of this to fully get it?" -> [Lots of time here] -> "OK. Now I'm ready".

You haven't done all of that, and if you HAVE, then it doesn't show in your comments. I think you're trading on emotion - you want it all to work out like any sane person would.  To support that hope, you're making a bunch of classic investing mistakes. The biggest being the most common - that past performance (Bitcoin always goes up!) guarantees future results.
Yeah, exactly. Btw thanks for pointing out that you'd spoken to me before, wasn't sure if you'd remember or not. I do still read through things here, just haven't been commenting much while the market figures out what the hell it's up to. :P
"If you don't like the comment, downvote, report and move on to move important things" . . . this is good advice for yourself.
Again, same snarky sarcasm as /u/g0nnagetya's latest comment.

Hmmm... 
[removed]
but I was hoping to get top dollar for a 4,811 karma account.  :(
I would wager both /u/sloppysynapses and /u/the_ops_mommy think it's something along those lines.

In fact, these two deputies both played a role in the action. 

/u/jarederaj also has preemptively thanked me for bringing evidence to his attention. 
I don't think people are taking what /u/GypsyToy is saying seriously enough. I'm not convinced that /u/ArsonBunny is running around using alts, but alts are an issue that seems to be getting ignored by this sub. It makes me uncomfortable that Gypsy is being targeted and harrased over this, too.

I'm generally upset with how everyone has handled this issue. I expected our sub to be more rational about all this. I'm especially disappointed with everyone who jumped to conclusions and started pointing fingers. The overt harrasment is unacceptable. Not sure what to do.

My position remains unconvinced and disappointed with everyone. I expect to feel the same tomorrow.
[removed]
I see. 

Well I disagree that this conversation isn't valuable to have in public. This guy should be publicly shamed, humiliated and tagged as such. His account should be suspended but it hasn't yet. Furthermore, people should take note of his writing style so that when he inevitability pops up again, people will know.

Sorry *you* don't think that's a good use of discussion. *I* think it is. If the mods disagree, then let them act. You're not a mod though. So please bug off.
If the Mods are on top of this then why exactly are you throwing a fit about it. Most normal rational folks will post commenting on the situation then shoot the mods a pm stating what's going on.
From what I can tell you have commented and contacted the mods also from what I can tell the mods told you to stop these posts. So you can see how this looks like a crusade against one person and his sock puppets as well as anyone who you think is defending them. Please seek professional help, the world is not out to get you.
Occam's razor suggests that if you have two explanations that have equal explanatory power for an observed state/phenomenon, you should pick the least complex of the two (I could talk about Kolmogorov complexity if you wanted to formalize this last part, but that's the substance of it).

The observed state was you having lots of downvotes. The modal reddit user on this sub not liking your posts is a simpler explanation than there being lots of sock puppets here specifically to downvote you, so it takes precedence.

Feel free to read my post history, I'm clearly not a sock, and your accusations that I am basically strengthen my case that the problem here is your paranoia and subsequent need to shout about it, cluttering up the daily with crap.
Thanks, reading this now. Does this all fall under quantitative analysis? What kind of academic background does this fall under by the way? 

This is interesting, I've always wondered what kind of strategy someone should use after winning a bunch/having a probabilistic edge when betting. The complexities of such a situation seem simple at first but thinking about the possibilities kind of blows my mind 
As what point did I mention some kind of miraculous turnaround? Show me the comment where I said I'm expecting that. Who are you talking to? Seek some help, you are hearing voices. 
Unreal that you can't see clear and incontrovertible evidence right in front of your eyes. How many smoking guns are there now? At least 5 by my count. **One** of those should be enough to lock up and throw away the key. 

Not to mention that even [his hand wavy pseudo-analysis has been debunked by one of our own](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ronjo/daily_discussion_sunday_june_17_2018/e0u59eg/).

Come on, Jared. This is not a witch hunt, this is a fair trial and he *lost* easily. The time to act was forever ago. This really demonstrates a clear failing on the part of the mods, no offense. Look how quickly this was acted on in the CryptoCurrency sub. Do you really want to be worse than r/CC?

Holy Christ, this place needs attentive mods with spines, not inattentive and ineffective ones.
Real talk though this seems like a really unhealthy obsession, no one should be obsessing over another random person on the internet like this. I suggest you take a step back for a bit in the interest of your mental health.
I've been moderately active for 7 years my man, if you'd actually look at my history you'd know I do mostly one thing when I comment: Talk shit and get into meaningless arguments on the internet, but then reading your other comments  things just got pretty sad real quick. Take the advice in this thread and cool down
Well, to be fair, the fact that gypsy has been vocal about you doesn't change the fact that you lied and tried to deceive people. For me, it will frankly be tough to trust you going forward but it's good that you admitted wrongdoing and are trying to move forward. 
Or... The sub just self governed? 
Okay, I'll start working through the first 200,000 accounts. /u/The_OPs_Mommy and Sloppy, you start dividing up the rest amongst yourselves.

Meet back here in 24 hours.
Yeah, I'm not staying in this long for more than a few days. I shorted at $9.9k, $8.4k, $7.6k, and I'll short again if it gets up to $6.8k. I just don't want to get greedy and assume it'll go down forever and miss the opportunity to short on a solid bounce. I don't see how people think this is accumulation for a new bull run here, but I doubt we'll never see $7k again this year just because we broke through that one support line.
It’s definitely looking more pennant-like after another bounce on support. You're probably right.
you can VPN on registering.. Bitfinex will freeze your funds if it finds out. Bitmex isn't nearly as strict cause they're  not working with fiat 
Not all miners, but a lot will. And honestly I don't know if it's a good thing that only early adoption/big miners will survive.. Doesn't seem much like decentralization to me

Either way, your argument was basically that they'd hold off until bitcoin recovers. The hash rate has increased substantially over the past year, there are lots of new miners who will be desperate to make a profit and sell their supply before they get out entirely. 

Not everyone invested in btc to hodl, they did it on the bet that it'd go up or sideways. If it doesn't, those new miners are fucked and will absolutely sell
Lol well consider this a prediction.  within the next 6month to at most 4 years bitcoin will be comfortably over 20k
Its not showing in my comments then.  I've done insane amounts of research.  I was buying big between 2k-3k which is because i finally understood the technology.  Unfortunately kept buying (not as much but significant amounts)   Im not a bitcoin maximilist and hold ether and some others.  My time horizon is 1-4 years and at worst case lets say i hold for 10years, i don't think this is going to zero but if it does ill still be able to cover my house payments and lifestyle.  
Haha no problem! I remember seeing you out in the wild :P Think it was an askreddit thread

Yea I've got like +49 on you on RES but you never comment anymore :(
I'm trying to sound the alarm about an active scammer. What exactly is your excuse?
It has nothing to do with total karma. Old accounts get sold for these purposes all the time. See all the other examples I laid out. 

I'm certainly not claiming *everyone* is arson, but at this point it'd probably be easier to make a list of those who *aren't* arson.

Again, it's unreal that some of you are defending him. [He's literally attempting to sway people with incorrect info **~20 comments below**](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ronjo/daily_discussion_sunday_june_17_2018/e0u59eg/?context=3). Wake up, you sheep.
Nobody harassed Gypsy in today's daily, which is all I've been talking about. Go and read the comments from eg Codeverity, LotsaMozz, MikeXBT. They were level headed and addressed the tone and substance of his posts, and did not attack him/her personally. Compare gypsy's responses which were all very aggressive, practically snarling.

I'm in favour of excluding scammers from the sub, and support the ends, but not the means Gypsy has employed. His/her response was immature, and the fact that s/he was heavily downvoted is evidence not of brigading but that people didn't like what s/he was serving.

It may well be that Arsonbunny is using some sock puppets, is a scammer, etc. In which case sure, ban them. But I know nothing about all that, and it has no bearing on whether I want large chunks of the sub being occupied with the unravelling of some ridiculous conflict (Hint: I don't), which is what this boils down to.

I mean what is Gypsy hoping to achieve by blasting this out in every second daily? Only mods can ban, so there's no advantage over just taking it directly to mods via PM, other than some ridiculous public popularity contest aspect to this.
Un-fucking-believable. Did you not see the latest round of evidence?

You are out of your mind if this doesn't satisfy the burden of truth enough. Are you kidding me?

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ronjo/daily_discussion_sunday_june_17_2018/e0uevcu/

This person is the same person who came to talk up arson today.

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ronjo/daily_discussion_sunday_june_17_2018/e0ucjt5/?context=3


You have to be completely blind not to see it. Even /u/SloppySynapses  sees it clearly now. /u/the_ops_mommy has always seen it clearly.

What is wrong with you, Jared? 
/u/the_ops_mommy /u/SloppySynapses /u/hotsoccerman /u/jrice1515 

Can someone with sanity please explain that the latest round of evidence is just yet another nail in this coffin? Jared why don't you accept incontrovertible evidence? I've demonstrated dozens of plausible shadiness and brought you several **smoking guns**. The latest is just /u/pirate_key being **the same exact account that was used previously by /u/arsonbunny (guess what, he forgot to change accounts again! Yet another instance of this happening [his kryptonite]).**

Please for the love of God, Jared, look at the facts as they are right in front of your face. It is obscene for you not to see each additional piece of evidence for what it is.

**Holy shit, man. Open your eyes.**

*and someone else please speak up*
[removed]
You don't need to gaslight me, I've already been proven right on this.

Thanks for your concern though.
Do you not understand that the behavior I'm pointing out includes downvote brigades from arson and his alts and whatever associates he has? I don't think you understand what I've already documented up until this point. This person is using **vote manipulation** as well as sock puppet accounts to facilitate his bidding (not to mention this clown also gilds himself).

Again, sorry you don't care or care to understand the issue. 

It is of great benefit to the sub and crpyto community at large to out and banish scammers (Faketoshi anyone?). Arsonbunny is a scammer/liar/shill/sockpuppet/manipulator/fraud/idiot/etc. I'm not paranoid, he was already banned from CC for doing the same and I've shown several examples over the past few days of this. 

It sounds like you're just 'out of the loop' and I'm not surprised. It's not paranoia, you can ever refer to what [the mod said](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ronjo/daily_discussion_sunday_june_17_2018/e0u7y9f/?context=3). 


Also, just watch what happens in the coming days. Arson has been found out. Action will take place, I assure you.

yes.. but keep in mind too much quant talk makes you light in the loafers.. and it makes you a shit trader.  
You ask a lot of nonsensical questions. I’m assuming you’re a stuck long by all your anger. I hope for your own sake you sell your BTC now before we see some real blood. 
I'm taking my time to evaluate this and I'm going to continue taking my time. I'm not going to ban someone because of pressure from anyone. I'll look again at what you've shown when I have time and on my own terms, but I'm not your puppet.
Hey man, I'm on your side on this one. But just communication wise, my 2 cents, take it back one notch. The mods do this out of passion for the sub and likely in conflict with their own personal lives in regards to time commitment. 

It is fathers day and I don't know anyone's personal situation, but likely some mods have bigger things to think about today and lets respect that.

Like I said, I agree with you, but maybe just take a break and let the sub runs its course a bit. No offense, just like, my opinion man. 
Duly noted.

I'm still amazed at how convenient your timing is. When was the last time you visited BitcoinMarkets? /u/jarederaj might want to view your history.
Just stop. You're only embarrassing yourself more. Nobody just prances into BitcoinMarkets at just the right time to take one random stranger's side versus another. 

You're arson, or acting on behalf of arson. Everyone can easily see this. 

Caught lying *again*! Who would have thought?
Yeah that's exactly my point, people should beware of **all** of the history regarding /u/arsonbunny, not just one incident.

Don't forget that this all started with faked BitMEX screenshots months ago. This guy is a compulsive liar. I'm **not** saying that he's making up CME and CBOE data or anything else specifically. I didn't even read the post, I just assume everything he says would need to be independently verified anyhow, so it's useless even when it's not overtly malicious. Don't trust, verify.
It was more me trying to cheer myself up that really deceive and shill as he claims. It was a dumb thing to do and I'll never do it again. I never falsified data and never shill anything. If I say something or bring some number, I source it. 

I don't want you to trust me, I want you to trust the CFTC site I sourced. Don't trust any anonymous user on the internet.
No, I had to walk people back from the edge... Just didn't use mod powers.
That's pretty fair, I can't blame anyone for not wanting to short here
Maybe, we'll see. It'd be incredible if I just keep being right by being a stubborn asshole about it 
49, whoa! Thanks! My RES reset at some point so I don't have my accurate vote count :( You know, I think I saw you somewhere but I don't remember where... Might be askreddit, though, I do go there pretty often. 

Yeah, at some point I decided to just sit tight and wait things out so I stopped coming by here as much. It's stressful actively trading as opposed to holding and seeing what's going to happen. 
The harrasment I saw was mixed with homophobia and hate speech, so I don't think we're talking about the same thing in that regard. You couldn't have seen that anyway, as AutoMod would have removed it or it would have been in a DM. Part of the issue is that most of this stuff goes unseen and unnoticed. That it's hidden, coordinated, and targeted is part of the problem.

I haven't read everything, but the most level headed response I've seen has been from sloppy. Generally, I'm disappointed in the lack of critical engagement I've seen from the vast majority of people who have come to a conclusion about all this without showing they understand the issues.

I've probably been more engaged with this than anyone except Gypsy and I haven't come to solid conclusions yet. I at least know that I owe it to everyone to look in to this more, which is part of the reason no action is being taken.
Gypsy, chill, jared is approaching this like someone who doesn't want to start a witch hunt which is completely rational. No need to say stuff like "What is wrong with you" and "You are out of your mind"

It's not 100% rock solid evidence that Arson is *vote manipulating* which is how they get banned. I think it's fine to have alts. In this case it's clear Arson uses his alts to defend himself, but I'm not sure if that's a bannable offense. It's definitely something that's nice to know, but I don't think it's like perma-ban worthy. 

I think Jared's just taking a slow, rational approach to this and doesn't want to overstep his duties as mod. 


[removed]
Good-o, I'm in favour of said "action" taking place.

My application of Occam's razor is sound. Your posts in today's daily are heavy negative because they are shit, not because of brigading. That's not a refutation that brigading can and does happen, it's just pointing out that shit posts are and should be downvoted, by everyone.  


Think of it as a public service.
[deleted]
Who said anything about puppets? I'm calling on your integrity and responsibility. I don't doubt that you have good intentions but something here is clouding your judgement. There are now several irrefutable pieces of evidence. Previous bans, **multiple** accidental posts/messages from wrong accounts, 100% faked BitMEX screenshots. Like, what more are you looking for?  All of these plainly obvious 100% irrefutable examples are coupled with plenty of "circumstantial" evidence to make it look even more shady.

The fact that /u/sloppysynapses (one of the most trustful, gullible  and naive people I've ever come across [no offense]) has seen the light and you haven't is just boggling. 

 
Ok, but this has been going on for far too long at this point, in my view. I want to be respectful to the mods and I understand that it's the weekend, father's day and that this is a volunteer job, but I can't help but be frustrated with how this is being dealt with thus-far. 

There's also the backstory that *I* was perma-banned several months ago for making this same ruckus about arson then. Back then he was posting fake screenshots of BitMEX positions he didn't actually hold (forgetting edit all the appropriate fields). Several people pointed this out but he always deleted the post, lied or used sock puppets to slip away from criticism and accountability. Finally, I called him out and re-posted the screenshots, showing that they were fake. A big ordeal ensued (very similar to this) and somehow I got banned for causing drama and he got off scott free. The fact that this same guy up to even worse tricks now and has been caught multiple times but the mods have done nothing is shitty. I had to work hard to get the mods to rescind my ban and provided much in the evidence *then* in an effort to do so. 

At this point, there is just so much evidence and so much of it is 100% rock solid, that it's absurd to think that the mods are waiting on admins to do something. He made lots of mistakes and I (and sloppy and op's mommy) found and documented those mistakes. There's no way to explain any of these, let alone several.

Anyway, I'll heed your advice. 
I don't know what to think. It is very strange that an old account suddenly jumps into this disagreement.

Either way, you should probably just ignore each other and focus on what you can control, trading and making $$. You'll probably be happier? Good luck though, man. 
I was eyeing this discussion and this right here turned it in your favor.

The account r/Tritez has like just a dozen posts or so in the last year, none of them on this sub.  And just now he happens to show up here to defend the honor of some random guy. Hmm....
Yeah I'm just having a hard time keeping track of all these accounts ya know
So what, there are many kind of people on the internet worth or not worth our attention, some bad people post relevant stuff, some good people irrelevant stuff, just leave him alone and stop sperging this is embarassing.
When I say trust you, I mean trust your intentions, not your content. Anyone can post factual information, but then it's important to ask "why" that person is posting that information. For you, the intent part of it is unfortunately clouded by your admitted dishonesty. I hope that makes sense.
Lol, you are such a liar. You've already been caught doing this many more times.

Don't pretend like you reformed yourself just because mods in *that* sub made you look like a complete fool and liar.

Anyone with a head on their shoulders doesn't trust you at all, not even at face value. You're a compulsive liar and most people know it.
Well, worked for now.

I had never thought with any seriousness that this sub was really worth manipulation in whale world with socks, puppets or otherwise. But I am reconsidering that assumption. 
Yeah, I'm jealous your short is still open if I'm being honest. Just trying to ride the waves til it gives me a nice new position. Hope we can both profit from these moves!
I just went and read through arson's post history and there doesn't seem to be anything much to be concerned about there. Is there evidence of sock puppeteering other than the admitted case from five months ago? 

I don't have a huge amount of time to delve into this. But if anything it seems more like gypsy is harassing arson? Calling him scammer etc, responding aggressively even to what appear to be good faith posts, etc.

Can you point me to what all the fuss is about? 
[removed]
Actually I've gained about 80 karma over the course of the day posting here, so I don't think that's an accurate assessment. Also, [mods are getting on top of it as we speak](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ronjo/daily_discussion_sunday_june_17_2018/e0uus6b/). 

Uh oh, you look like kind of a dummy now, don't you? :p
I did my mining with radeon's - I left before antminers started to dominate.  AI does treat problems like games.  It's iterative, uses reward functions, and eschews formulaic analysis.  Sounds like a turn-based game with a high score to me.

I've met countless quants.  They're poor.  The HFT algo guys are rich.





I haven't looked at much over the weekend, just responded to a few people based on what I observed last week. I'll look again on Monday.

If there's something substantial then I'll take action, I just haven't looked at the latest. 

I asked sloppy to post a thread to communicate what he has discovered. My hope is that we can use that to have a rational and public conversation about alt accounts and their impact on this sub, regardless of what it may also show about ArsonBunny.

If mods determine that ArsonBunny is using alts then we'll ban him. At this time I am uncomfortable making that determination myself because I am bias against ArsonBunny.
No worries at all, I took some time off and missed round one of this fight, so playing catch up I guess. Also, it seems pretty clear some shenanigans have occurred (read post thread for far too long) and sorry that you got sin binned previously.

At any rate, my advice is only what I would give in any heated situation. Take a step back, stop typing or saying whatever you are currently expressing, and see if it is still feels like a fight worth having tomorrow. Maybe a good use of 5% of your reddit/trading time or 90%. Your call. 

Peace out for the night and good luck sorting out this fairly dramatic piece in this subs history. 


Yeah I might be better of just ignoring, but others wouldn't be. This guy has scammed and manipulated his way all through the crypto subs and has been caught red handed before. Two nights ago, [I caught him red handed **again**](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8qr0fd/new_york_times_university_of_texas_at_austin/e0opb9m/). This is the same idiot who was posting faked BitMEX screenshots months ago pretending he was holding positions he wasn't actually holding. This guy is a straight up sociopathic manipulator and folks need to take notice, imo.
Yep, dude, this is the least of it. Hopefully /u/jarederaj adds this to the **fucking stack** of info I already provided. Including the fact that he messaged me a threatening message from the wrong account the other night. /u/jarederaj has all this info and much more. Maybe this will be enough to tip the scales, but who knows.

Fuck this guy and his dozens (hundreds) of other accounts. He is a complete liar and manipulator. Should've been gone a long time ago.

edit: people might think I'm being an asshole or over reactive about this but there's really no other way to deal with this at this point. If mods aren't going to ban him then they should ban me because I'm not going to stop pointing this shit out.

Who gives a fuck that he posted a table with futures data in it? He's a fake and a manipulator and should be permanently banished to whatever degree is possible. 
I glanced at your post history and I don't see you "talking shit" or getting into "meaningless argument". 

So, lo and behold, looks like you're lying once again.

You're just digging yourself deeper.

edit: [here](https://imgur.com/a/hWGlePu) is the last several comments you made prior to your intrusion today. Can you circle the comments that were "talking shit" and getting into "meaningless arguments" with strangers?

I'm not seeing any such thing in your post history. It's almost like you're just making the whole thing up. Who would do such a thing?
Fuck off. Many people in just this thread alone have expressed interest. 

Most of us don't want manipulators and sock puppets running a muck. It's mod's job to handle this but they aren't doing a good job. Therefore it's incumbent on individuals to speak up.

This is morally abhorrent behavior and if this were real life, this guy would be shamed. Sorry that you can't seem to understand why this type of behavior is highly destructive and immoral.
Okay, fair enough. I am not an angel, I tried to sheer myself up 5 months ago during a shitty time. Nobody is perfect. If you don't want to trust me because of the "intentions" of posting facts, I couldn't care less. What I do care is that people are informed about the reality of the Bitcoin markets and are aware of things like how many professional traders are shorting vs longing. And far too many try to hide and downvote information they don't like here or attack the person posting it.
[deleted]
My spider sense is telling me that you're still basically right. My guess is that it's more about ego and less about profit.
Post history can be procured. The issues I'm most concerned about are alt account usage and harrasment.

 The sub needs to decide how it feels about alt accounts. It's a TOS issue that admins may have failed to handle. Generally, this sub isn't questioning the existence and impact of alt accounts.

I care much less about annoying drama posts. Read past the drama and look at the cause.

I asked sloppy to make a self post about this. If he posts that I will add my own comments if it seems called for. I don't believe I will have to do that.
https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ronjo/z/e0uhanw
 *[shakes the magic 8 ball](/r/Magic8Ball2k7/)* 

 Only time will tell.
/u/jarederaj /u/sloppysynapses /u/the_ops_mommy 

This appears to be yet another sock puppet account. This is the exact language these accounts use every time:

"arson appears to be a good guy, gypsy seems like he's harassing, I looked and I didn't see anything, btw did you notice that he has a bunch of gold and a low of karma? He must be awesome."

Always some slight variant of this. This is extremely similar to what /u/missreal was saying way back when, you know before she started messaging out of nowhere calling me a faggot and acting like she was responding to a comment I left for arson. Strange!

Anyway, this is the same exact thing, from a poster who just happened to show up after not being on reddit for a while and angrily barge into a conversation they know nothing about. 

[Completely disregarding what I'm saying and downvoting me](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ronjo/daily_discussion_sunday_june_17_2018/e0uy18x/).

Sock puppet.


edit: also, his original message:

>Mods, can we please ban GyspyToy. Not necessarily a perma-ban, but maybe say a month in the sin bin? He is wasting all of our time.
Paging u/jaderaj

lmao, again, this is deja vu. Why is this guy so eager to have me banned for a month. /u/missreal was threatening to get me banned for longer than a month. Why is this random person who knows nothing about the situation so confident that I'm wasting everyone's time? Why?

Also, this sociopath might be misspelling your name on purpose. This is exactly what /u/MissReal did when defending those screenshots. [Spelled his name "arsonbunnie".](https://imgur.com/a/uusVkgD) 

Wow such clever.

Okay, fair enough. I know you have a lot on your plate as probably *the* primary mod and I know it's weekend and you have other things to do. (Isn't it Monday today though? Aren't you in Europe?)

>I asked sloppy to post a thread to communicate what he has discovered. My hope is that we can use that to have a rational and public conversation about alt accounts and their impact on this sub, regardless of what it may also show about ArsonBunny.

Yes. This is a good idea. Thank you.

>If mods determine that ArsonBunny is using alts then we'll ban him. At this time I am uncomfortable making that determination myself because I am bias against ArsonBunny.

Okay, then it's just a matter of time before that happens. Like I said, *one* of these incidents should suffice, but there are now several undeniable examples to choose from. 

Hopefully Sloppy makes a nice detailed post and I'll add whatever he's missing. 

It's compelling advice. I'm a bit shell shocked at this point. 

Cheers, mate.
Yeah, I hear you. You'll probably make more money by refocusing that energy though. But it's your call on what fights to have. 
I understand the frustration but you can't let yourself get mad at shills and sockpuppets, because they're everywhere and you'll never be at peace.

Fake news, sockpuppet circle-jerks and voting bots brigading discussions are the bread and butter of the modern world, doubly true in crypto. Just tag them and move along.
Looks like Mr Whiteknight could need a day or two of vacation.
I can appreciate that, however I'm not sure I understand how faking a positive comment reply to yourself would cheer you up. *You* know it's fake, so how does that help?
> I'm literally one of the most upvoted users in /r/Cryptocurrency.

**BECAUSE YOU BUY UPVOTES AND GOLD FOR YOURSELF**

>The CC mods even came and defended me the last time you tried this, on June 14.

No they didn't. They explained that you faked it and lied. They didn't defend you on shit.

Thanks. Seems fairly convincing.

I still think gypsy has been overall more disruptive, plus ins't it only vote manip that gets you in trouble for having alts? Sock puppetry gives me the shits, but having multiple accounts is not always sock puppetry.
This is exactly the kind of shit I was talking about when I said gypsy was paranoid. I'm very clearly not arsonbunny. The kinds of connections you need to draw to be convinced that I am require a kind of paranoid thinking.

I stand behind my identity, and would even be willing to reveal it to mods in PM (though a real sleuth could figure it out anyway by careful analysis of past posts plus smart use of public search engines).

I wanted to get gypsy banned because I wanted to cease seeing his rants in the daily (remember the "keep up the facade" nonsense too?). I realise that a much simpler solution would have been to just block him, so I'll simply opt for that. Problem solved.

That said I still think the most productive way forward for the forum would be to ban both arsonbunny (plus confirmed alts) and gypsytoy.
> "arson appears to be a good guy, gypsy seems like he's harassing, I looked and I didn't see anything, btw did you notice that he has a bunch of gold and a low of karma? He must be awesome."

You're once again failing to apply occam's razor. The reason that is a common response is that it's what most reasonable people would arrive at after a cursory investigation. On average people aren't going to invest a lot of time to get to the bottom of your petty squabble.

After going and looking at more of the linked evidence, I agree that it looks like arson is using alts. But you know what, I still like him more than your annoying ass.
Careful with linking to comments. If you are telling people to take some kind of action it is a brigade.

So you're just another sock puppet, is that it?

Here's another [respected dude on the sub caring](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8qyvqh/daily_discussion_thursday_june_14_2018/e0p53go/)

You're not doing a very good job doing arson's bidding. You're supposed to be calling me a cuck, faggot, etc. 

Did I stave off most of arson's accounts or something?

Bring the heat, arson! Call me dirty words!
then you are a genius. damn.  Sorry.  I edit a lot because I try to reduce everything i say to under 50 words.  Forces me to think.



Cheers to you as well. Netflix and chill. 
Yeah, I'm sure there are better uses of my times but I feel this is important and mods have totally dropped the ball. 

Either mods are going to ban me making a scene or they're going to ban him for being a fraud. Either way, I'd rather not deal with this individual or any of his shell accounts any longer.
Normally I do. This is a bit beyond the level of normal shill/sockpuppet/whatever. This is orchestrated manipulation on a relatively large scale and I've demonstrated this, in depth, to the mod team. They went to the admins and the admins shut down some of the accounts already, but the main issue persists. 

I shouldn't have to be so vocal, but the mod team is acting completely inept in this situation. 

Perhaps there is more to the situation that you don't understand. I hope mods weigh in because I already said more than enough a few dailies ago. I'm not a mod, so all I can do is be vocal about it (and get myself banned if mods can't open their eyes).
Looks like someone is perfectly a-ok with vote manipulation and sock puppets.

Good job, bro!
I know, its a dumb emotional thing. It was a really really shitty day at work and I wasn't in the right state of mind. 
Is that going to be your next narative? That I bought years of gold for myself and hundreds of thousands of upvotes? 

Maybe just maybe I get so many upvotes because I post indepth insightful content and source it like I did here? 

Maybe, just maybe you get so many people telling you to STFU not because everyone who tells you this is army of alts, but are telling you that because you are an insufferable witchhunting asshole (as many have already told you) claiming some sort of moral police status and trying to incite downvotes and slander with a new attack every week? 

We seem to basically be on the same page about this.

Still in the process of coming to a conclusion about what to do.
Yeah this has been just about the most thankless task I've ever taken upon myself. It's not possible that all the attacks I'm getting are legitimate. Sure, JustSomeBadAdvice and several others accounts *are* legitimate and the criticism leveled at me isn't entirely unwarranted, but what is with all these accounts showing up at just the right time, out of nowhere to say "*wow gypsy is paranoid, arson seems like a good guy, mods should ban gypsy. By the way, great analysis, arson. You are extremely smart.*" All of these account follow the same structure and several of them have never posted in BM previous and/or almost never log into reddit. Normal, intelligent folks don't look at glaring evidence of wrongdoing and then turn around and attack the whistleblower. The fact that people are saying "gypsy is wrong, the downvotes prove that nobody cares. Look at all the downvotes" is absurd when the vote manipulation and sock puppets are the very thing I'm pointing out.

Either a portion of this sub is extremely misguided as to where to direct their pitchforks *or* even more of these accounts are puppets. 

Either way, it's good to have several irrefutable examples at this point. I think arson's best days are behind him... until he buys another account and starts doing the same thing... next week.
I agree that Gypsy is disruptive. I'm curious if the sub cares enough about the issues this points at to look past the disruption and start looking at the real issues, which are harrasment and the use of alt accounts to manipulate sentiment. You might think this is a small issue, but it's rampant. I suspect that a significant percentage of accounts are fake, but only a small percentage of users believe it's happening in a case where there's fairly clear evidence.
Lol, unreal that you can still this *I'm* the bigger issue here. This person has dozens of accounts and is going around manipulating this sub and the CC sub to a high degree.

Unbelievable that you're still upset about me and not them. Get your priorities straight.
i just thought it was strange that you would defend someone so ardently when you don't even understand anything about the context. Wasn't saying you were or weren't. Just noting that it's very odd, or 'disappointing' as Jared puts it.

I don't care, mods can ban me. I don't see why they would at this point, since I brought something serious to light but I don't care if they do. 

>(remember the "keep up the facade" nonsense too?)

Lol, that wasn't me. That was /u/psyrev_ . I may have been egging him on but that was his doing. It was also "keep up the *charade*", not facade.
> I agree that it looks like arson is using alts. But you know what, I still like him more than your annoying ass.

Lol, that's a smart move, brother. Good choice.

Go ahead and praise a scammer even more. Tell me all about how you'd rather have his children than mine and how he's got a bigger dick and why should we even care that he's a fraud. He's the man, right?

Good grief. Didn't you say you were going to block me? Get on with it already.
I never asked anyone to take any sort of action. I was just pointing out that a certain someone had returned. 
Also, OP's mommy was the one adding his votes to that discussion. I was PMing with him when arsonbunny showed back up. I just told him "guess who's back" and the rest was his own doing. I didn't brigade or manipulate or anything else. You can verify this with him.

Also, his suggestion (lol) is to see how much of a bribe arson is willing to put up. I don't want to lose credibility and integrity by even discussing the matter but how funny is *that*? I don't need or want his VeChain but it would be pretty funny to accept a bribe and ignore my end of the deal *or* if mods just man-handled his account regardless. That's all OPs_mommy's thinking though, not mine. I'm not bribe-able, I just want to see how much I could get him up to.

This is dumb.
Could we use Augur to bet on who gets banned? =) 
He posted a well-structured, informative post, don't see any bias in it. 
You have never posted anything interesting, sorry.
Everything is verifiable, what about you counter-argument him instead of ad-hominem childish attacks?
You are such a terrible liar. Don't pretend like you only did it once. You got caught and you can't do anything *except* apologize. You employ these same tactics **all the time**. You're a phony, bro. Most people already know this. Time for the mods to send you on your way. This type of behavior is completely repugnant. 

Nothing of what you say can be taken at face value because you've been caught lying and manipulating so many times. There's no excuse for doing this once, let alone innumerable times.

> Is that going to be your next narative? That I bought years of gold for myself and hundreds of thousands of upvotes?

I've already demonstrated this behavior extensively. This is not a "new narrative".

>Maybe just maybe I get so many upvotes because I post indepth insightful content and source it like I did here?

All you did here was post a table? I'm not claiming that you're buying *all of your* upvotes. I'm claiming that you're using manipulation on this sub, just like you got caught doing on /r/CC.

>Maybe, just maybe you get so many people telling you to STFU aren't all my army of alts, but are telling you that because you are an insufferable witchhunting claiming some sort of moral police status and trying to incite downvotes and slander with a new attack every week?

Yeah, the person who's already been caught doing this multiple times is probably telling the truth, right? You're so believable, arson.
Just wanted to say I couldn't draw any conclusion other than what was posted above. Arson seems like he craves upvotes for one reason or another. Gypsy lacks social skills but has plenty of time. Either way I don't envy you here because whatever you decide will be wrong to someone. 
You don't forgive disruption because there is a worthwhile topic underneath all the crap. You deal with both separately - curtail and punish the disruption, whilst allowing a discussion to take place about the substantive issue.

I obviously don't see harassment as much as you do, because you and the AutoMods are cleaning it up as it arises, but I think it's an issue. As for alts, it's also clearly an issue but I haven't seen any concrete proposals for what we should do about it.

Do you have suggestions? If so, float them.
> I may have been egging him on but that was his doing.

It was my doing? What is it you believe I did, exactly?
Thanks, yeh I wasn't sure if it was you that instantiated, I just remembered you prolonging it. Tried searching to confirm but of course I had the wrong word, so couldn't find it.
Scammer?
Glad to hear that you're not brigading. Seems like a reasonable explanation for the votes.

No, barging into a conflict that you don't understand in the slightest and taking one side is dumb and rather suspect. You don't even understand what's going on here and you're lecturing mods about how they've got it all backwards. 
I've already provided ample evidence, which jared asked me not too post publicly again. 

I'm not referring to this post in particular. I referring to the individual on a whole. He is a manipulate and malicious liar. 

Believe what you want but most of the regulars here wouldn't trust anything he says as being worth a dime. 

Who gives a shit that he copied a CME/CBOE table and made some hand wavy claims? This guy is a **FRAUD**.

Sorry you don't seem to care about that. 
If everyone is unhappy then I'll probably have done something right.
Disruption doesn't violate a rule. It's a good way to protest, too.
You repeated the same stupid phrase ("keep up the charade") ad nauseum because you couldn't handle the fact that BCash processes half the number of transactions as Dogecoin. You threw a complete temper tantrum, which was pretty amusing.
It wasn't me who instigated it.
I think it's a pretty useful exercise. I've gotten people banned from subs before for repeating the same thing over and over. It a demonstration of how stupid and pathetic shills are and mods typically don't like the look of someone shouting the same thing over and over. 

Sorry you don't like my content, really. Report it, downvote it and move on if it's not valuable to you. Plenty of other ways to occupy your time.
See. This is exactly what I'm talking about. You don't even understand the context of this conflict. You're just inserting yourself with vitriol into something you don't understand. Maybe if you understood the context, you wouldn't sound like such an ignoramus.

Yeah, news flash, Arson is a known scammer. 

Go back to drawing lines are charts, this is above your pay grade, I think.
He can confirm this, I'm sure. At least I assume it's him. I only sent messages to you and him regarding his arrival. He said he was reading (and laughing) in real time at most of it. 

In any case, I would never do something so stupid. I wear my downvotes with pride and dignity. Not all of us are trying to reach 133K karma. Some of us just don't give a shit.

Mate, I didn't take a side. I didn't even realise there were opposing sides. I assumed arson had already been dealt with at the point I waded in. I just wanted your annoying paranoid shit out of the fucken daily. 
Oh I see you're from the internet police.
Well, you certainly haven't motivated me to not be disruptive.   


What about rules #2 and #7?    
Hahaha, keep up the charade.

Edit: for anyone reading, he keeps lying through his teeth and using intentional fallacies, it's beyond any point of reason and all he's doing is playing a charade. There's no reasoning with him, so I ignore my want to even try, and I suggest you do the same.
[removed]
This hasn't been lost on the mod team. We are discussing it.
See, /u/arsonbunny! I wasn't vote manipulating anything. Unlike you, I'm not so vain as to find such an activity worthwhile. I couldn't care less about my karma. 

**When are you going to tell us all, including mod /u/jarederaj, which alt you are admitting to using?**

We would love to start to whittle this list of names down, one by one. Please enlighten us.

It's not paranoid, that much has already been determined. Just because *you're* not a sock puppet, doesn't mean that sock puppets aren't running game on these comments. 

Really, if you don't understand what's going on and you don't like the comments, downvote, report, complain and move on already.

Get a clue. Or are you also a scammer? What should I tag you as? Enabler or scammer?
Moderation is nuanced. If you feel the need to protest something, go ahead and be disruptive.
