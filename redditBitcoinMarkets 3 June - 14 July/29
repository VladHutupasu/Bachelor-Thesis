We're back in the triangle I've been watching.

https://imgur.com/a/68L4k49

Keeping my short open for now.

Edit: maybe I spoke to soon. May be acting as support now

Edit 2: I don't fucking know
When will the MOFOs FOMO back in?
Point and Figure Chart https://i.imgur.com/dCnhosE.png  We have broken down from our range 3 days ago.  Our new range is between 4,454 and 7,776.  We have recently resolved a long pole of 12 O's from 6/13.  A pullback to $4,499 would complete unresolved long pole dating back over 8 months ago and is our next likely long-term target. Short term, we have a recent unresolved long pole of 16 O's from 6/10, a move above 7,040 would resolve 50% of the pole. 

A look at trendlines and regular RSI divergence https://www.tradingview.com/x/HlUTT6wV/  These are what I am watching as far as major trends go.  We are in a downward trend with great risk of breaking into an even steeper downward trend.  But for now, the Risk:Reward is on the bulls side.  Despite being near support, longs should be extremely careful: we are in a downward trend on weekly, daily, and 4 hour timeframes.  Shorters should wait for a better entry, ideally risking off previous support trendlines (7230) or volume node (7550), but in this environment we just might not reach that entry point.

Since this the price of Bitcoin is stagnant at the moment, and this forum by extension, I thought we could have a quick discussion of your favorite resources outside of TV for useful trading indicators. I'll start:

Datamish: Shows the total number of margin shorts/longs at any given time. Nice indicator of whether buyers/sellers are overextended in order to watch for potential upcoming squeezes. I swear by this.

Bitcoinity: I occasionally enjoy tracking the combined order book to see where buy/sell walls are appearing. Great for tracking support/resistance levels and/or spoofing.

TensorCharts: Just a beautiful, very customizable website, though I honestly don't use it as much as I feel I should. Allows you to track volume profiles and support levels, as well as filter by order size in case you want to compare the actions of "whales, dolphins, and minnows" at certain price points.

Finally, these Twitter resources are more for fun:

@BitmexWhale: Tracks market buys/sells of at least $3mil

@BitmexREKT: For the pain (RIP to my fallen brothers)
Always a blast watching Bitmex in times like this. Huge rekts and insane $200 pump in under 2 minutes.
It's fascinating that in a bear market the collective psychology finds a way to be bullish at each level:

\- At 9k's is was Adam and Eve double bottom, which was presented as a bullish argument even before it got validated (it would only be confirmed at 12k, but nobody cared about that small detail).

\- At 7k's it was the giant triangle and the triple bottom, which was again put forward without validation.

\- And right now, just when I thought all hell would broke loose after the support got broken, the market found another hopium: [the Wyckoff accumulation](https://twitter.com/LandM_Marius/status/1007835842159599617)

I really wonder what the brand new argument at 5k will be, as we are slowly running out of trading patterns in the book.
The market is really weird right now. Sudden spike, then super low volume. Shorts are decreasing fast, but so are longs.

Anyone knows what is happening?
Price is nearing the end of the triangle formed by the resistance of the downward channel since 10K - in *yellow* (that line was once violated, though, and the price was above it for seven days before falling back in), and the diagonal support of the channel we're in for the last four days (in *pink*).

The same triangle zoomed in (background in *blue*):

A break on either side might produce some volatility.

I don't think 6400 will hold much longer if bulls can't get this over 6600 in the next day.
How to check interest on Bitmex? Is an account necessary? Tradingview covers shorts/longs on Bitfinex, but I can't find anywhere Bitmex data. Thanks.
Adding to my short here. Pretty straightforward descending triangle forming: https://www.tradingview.com/x/Svvv8ndW/

Opened a scalp short at the top of this triangle.

 Looking to buy back a bit lower before the formation completes.
Is this what the market has come too? Big 15m candles that make each other undone?
**Just a quick question:**

Is it possible to set alerts for techincal indicators using tradeview?

To for example get an alert when MACD turns negative or when RSI is below 30
Behaving like 6700 again.. should dump sooner or later.

Edit: sorry, meant support.
**Position Bot Update**


New channels were created for those who still use the **Pushed** app to overcome limitations of the site. 

Users must subscribe to the new channels since the old channel will only be used for system messages. 

The new channels were sent by notification through the Pushed system. Any questions just PM me.


The new [user stats page](http://anotherbot.info/show_stats.php) had several fixes and updates during the day, including a new column to show the Win Rate of each user (% of trades with PnL above 0%). It's interesting to compare this column with the Avg. PnL as not always being right most of the times results in a Avg. PnL greater than 0%.

Added a link in the stats page to the Weekly Statistics. This page has trade statistics groups by the week they were created.

Any other ideas for stats just let me know.

Looks like the bart has returned. It will go sideways here and bart down again in a day or two. LOL
https://www.tradingview.com/x/ue5ikudh/

This seems like a pretty strong candidate for a descending triangle:
- We were in a strong downtrend prior to this triangle.

- Triangle downtrend line confirmed by 4 points.

- Triangle support line confirmed by 3 points.

- Volume contracting.

- Technical target lines up with the bottom of the channel around 5910

- RSIs cooled off now and we haven't followed through with this last pump. 

TLDR: Probably heading down soon but that doesn't mean I'm not scared of the BGD.

EDIT: Just realised that puts us below the Feb 6th low so perhaps we'll just bounce at 6000 and then moon? :/
So no one is going to talk about the inverse H&S on the 4h? Should confirm at 6.6k
We have made higher lows for 4 hour straight, we have exited the 1hour cloud and are about to exit the 2hr cloud. We are at about to test the resistance of the triangle everyone is watching.

Im going long here. The setup is too good for a pop
Retest of this descending IH&S neckline

https://www.tradingview.com/x/zkj0mSQT/

I apologize for drawing this IH&S prematurely the other day (before the right shoulder formed).. but hey, it worked out :D
Flag sloping in the wrong direction does often play out as a Bart formation (i.e. full retrace incoming). I have a feeling we’re looking at the same thing here...

https://www.tradingview.com/x/QEjWOaPO/
Daily and 12hr closed slightly bullish, thoughts? 
what's up with funding rate on mex? Swaps are consistently in line with stamp and Dax but next period is 0.17% shorts paying longs..?

What is this shit 

I been paying longs out the ass for no reason -_- 

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSDT/wMv2tRqY-Pump-it-pt-2/

got the text on the chart this time. 
!short BTCUSD add 6400 4X  


Things are looking more bearish for every time I look at the charts, I see bearish signs everywhere. I think that even Chad is becoming bearish / insane. Mostly looking at the bear pennant on the daily.
My long was stopped out exactly on the drop just before this huge green candle after carefully dcaing it down on each drop, and derisking it at next break even, scalp style, for a couple days.  I was mostly away from the PC today but worst part is that I actually moved the stops up.   Even had nice profit taking orders that would have filled.

Even worst part is that the SL flipped short which also took a SL.

Oh FML I should take a break, what a fucking waste of time.

Edit: btw I just 100x revenge longed on september @ 6417 when I got the alarm.  SL is at 6392 and I don't even care if the stop fills, the loss is nothing relativly.

Edit 2:  Took some profits off that at 6500, market stopped at 6435.  
Huhm, rarely I see this low volume on Bitfinex. Everybody withdraw money to bet on World Cup?
Opened a long at 6372, did not sell at 6.6k+ (because of news, my inital plan was to sell at 6.7k), went down and down and down, thought shit, this is not a good trade, closed at 6450 for a small profit, went down to sub 6.4k, thought I am so smart that I closed and now we shoot back up... one day in BTC land (or better two days).
Did 3K leveraged longs on bitfinex really close earlier? Seems like the price barely moved
The battle for 6.4k is real. Flatlining like my heart
Mid term things do look quite bottomlike https://www.tradingview.com/x/NVl1HjHt

one could argue BTC now has retraced the whole move from the plateau  around November has been retraced and the 6500 area is the horizontal bottom/support.  It's also interesting to see if this downtrend line that was broken will hold around 6k or something 
Really we're just [ranging](https://snag.gy/1tkqTB.jpg) right now, the real movement will happen out of the box, waiting until then.  I want to short at the top but the [MACD](https://snag.gy/HlzTas.jpg) just turned up so a little hesitant, will watch the candles. 
After 2h BitmexRekt started tweeting again. Action and liqudations incoming
Not much of a trader, not that I don't understand how to trade, just not very good at TBH. I do come here for the conversation though, both sides, I find it interesting. My take on Bitcoin is both the useable tech behind it and the amount of supply. In my mind (as crazy as that might be) not everyone in the world can own one whole Bitcoin (21mil÷7+bil-(all the morons losing cold storage drives) = not enough. So...In that sense, whether it like be a novelty or a finite commodity such as gold, silver or for the moon bois..."limited lambo" I'm down for a piece. In any case my trading advice  is get all the damn coins you can get, whether it be short, long it don't matter. In ten years I doubt it will be in this range, so get dem coin homies while they last!

*Disclaimer* I'm heavily under the influence Japanese whiskey, so everything above maybe complete bullshit.
**Position bot update**

Added a [statistics page](https://www.anotherbot.info/show_stats.php)

Will be working on it a bit more on it, possibly adding a column with the number of positive trades vs negative trades

The average considers stack % and leverage to give a more real result, so a trade with 1% PnL and 50% stack has the same weight as a 0.5% PnL and 100% stack.


Any suggestions are welcome 
~~I'm seeing a bullish div on the daily leading back to the end of the June 10th dump if I'm not mistaken~~. However, there's not a lot of buying pressure here and I'm not seeing the shorts pile up like I'd to see before a squeeze, so I'm lowering my profit-taking targets slightly. I still expect this to chop upwards toward $6.8k at a minimum before continuing to dump similar to the chop from $7k to $7.8k, as $6k is heavy historical support to break through in one fell swoop. However, I still seriously doubt this is the bottom.  I closed another 10&#37; of my $6427 September futures long at $6501 to lock in some profits. Not as profitable as my $6615 close from yesterday, but I hope to DCA if it drops further down and I want to slowly reduce my exposure so I can hopefully knife catch on the next dump.

TL;DR: Still expecting some bart movements up to $6800 before continuing to dump. I still doubt this is the bottom though, so trying to DCA on the way down if it drops further.

!long XBTU18 profit 6501 5x 10&#37;
Every spike that is bought up is sold off! In the 6.6 range it happend so often and now again. Some whale does not agree that we go higher.

This is what I mean: [https://ibb.co/gVSxxy](https://ibb.co/gVSxxy) (imgur not working somehow)
To people who are adding shorts now: whales are very unpredictable and will f*** both longs and shorts. If this thing goes up, more than likely it will pump more than you would expect.

I am going to be DCA'ing between high 6700's and low 7000's. Stop-loss 7350

Quite funny that each month had it's own meme reversal word so far. I wonder what it will be in July, double pin bar bottom 5800 ?
Went to a bar last night to watch Spain - Portugal. Met up with some mates, one of them (Fred) I've not seen in like 3 years. Frist half we're just watching the game and having beers. At the start of the second half, Fred's dad and his work mates joined us. Turns out they're bankers so I started chatting to them. Now, bear in mind that I hardly ever drink so I was pretty fucked already and got progressively worse during the night so I don’t remember everything. Kinda annoyed tbh, missed the better half of the game chatting to them and I only remember snippets of the convos. Also, I was so hyped by the fact that I got to chat to bankers that I forgot to ask what sort of bankers they actually are and what they do… so take this with a kilo of salt, could be really well-dressed janitors.

Fred's dad said German and EU governments probably won't let deutche bank collapse and they’ll probably get bailed out. I asked him what he thought of cryptos and he had no clue what I was talking about… I said cryptocurrencies and he was like, "oh yeah, I only see them as a means of transfer" underestimating much? I don’t know, we'll see. He said banks will always be there as a finance and liquidity provider, which tbh I agree with. I see people saying that cryptos will take banks down, it makes me laugh.

One of Fred's dad's mates, who also happened to be the youngest one out of them, went to the same uni im going to. Quite weird cos it’s a small uni at the other side of the country so he just kept gassing about that.

Fred's dad's other mate was retiring today/yesterday (yesterday was his last day after working in banking for 44 yrs). He was really emphasizing that psychology, understanding people, how they work, think and incentives were key. Something along the lines of psychology makes people, people make money, money makes the world spin.

So yeah, that was mad exciting for me. In terms of BTC, im still on sidelines plotting and planning. Looking for setups. One that im really starting to like is going hard long below feb swing low. Why? We fall below there, people start to short and those who longed 6000-6300 will likely have stops there. A load of sells means plenty of long liquidity. Also could be a nice max pain scenario, make half the market shit itself into thinking we're going to 3k and then bam, V shape bounce from the long liquidity. That way both longs and shorts would get wrecked.
Looks about ready to dump again.  
4 hr tenkan + middle band holding us down, 12 hr tenkan pushing is down.   
4 hour macd turning red.    
Daily looks like a bear flag and bullish volume seems to have dried up completely, so expecting a bigger dump today or tomorrow.   
1d/3d looks very extended/steep though, so think there will be good money for long scalps coming up. Alts will probably crash hard the next week, since they're not as extended as bitcoin
This Wyckoff comparison is going to be another meme that's gonna fuck up so many naive people.

meme 6th, meme triangle, double/triple bottom. And also look at [this guy](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/6JK8fXOc-Everyone-got-fooled)
I walk away for a day and nothing has happened. Will add to my 6600 long at some point if this goes down a bit more. Until then, I'm getting on with my life and just not paying much attention to the price.
# Sub $2,000?

Honest question here: Anyone have a target of sub $2,000? I’ve been seeing some talk of this low “since it was the last peak of 2014.”

Is there any validity to this? I know anything is possible (even $0) but that seems a bit exaggerated, no? 

Charts if you got em
Many degenerate gamblers just got rekt.  Max pain for everyone!  Was there any news or is this "just cus?"
Remember guys. Just because it has done something in the past does not automatically mean that will happen again. Everyone seems to think it will bull run again. It could just linger on here and bleed all the way to sub 1000 where things will get really interesting. Don't fall for all the 100k by 2020 BS. Those are the same people trying to offload their coins to you. Billionaires didn't become billionaires (novogratz) by trying to "help" others make money. 
My first time posting a chart. Using 5 min candles, I'm seeing a bull flag. Wouldn't barts more likely tend to go upwards before the dump?

When registering to bitmex where do I put my place of residence? And what vpn should I use? I already have one from my ad block but should I use something special?
I have the feeling this will come down just as hard. A stophunt before the freefall.

Doesn't have much volume. I'm not convinced yet.
Slow bleed is the paradigm for the next few months it seems. Lack of interest is telling.... there will need to be something truly spectacular to spur the next run on. 

Good time for accumulating (repeating myself) ...

Where is the other cool one with pictures on it ?
the classical 1 comment per 30 min. Big move incoming
Wex has held a premium of ~5% over mainstream exchanges since its establishment and despite its improvements with banking partners.

BTC-e used to be the opposite, with prices regularly below competitors, presumably because of the influx of coins from non-KYC accounts.

Why so?
Seems to be a some kind of div on the hourly ([Bitstamp data](https://imgur.com/a/GCgkYtX)). 

EDIT: From what I can understand, this is a bearish divergence on an assumed uptrend, which means that momentum is slowing down on the apparent uptrend after the June 13 "reversal". 

It's **not** a hidden bull div, from what I can see. 
Shorted 6530, bart-slanted flag is always bad. Imo this can't be the bottom as it makes no sense (6100? what's up with 6100? nothing). We're headed at least to 5.8k, might bounce hard there, if not 4.2-4.8 probably.
How do you post your positions - someone should pin a link to instructions on the useful links bar or something. Also is there someway to verify these positions?
People who are short, are you viewing this rise as a nice entry/place to add to your short? 

I'm long and have been adding/averaging down on the drops.
First bad sign of a DownBart appears, a 15m moving average to the downside. In this market, if the volume dies of and the bull flag like formation fails to push upward, I assume the psychological reaction "time to get out when I can" + people placing stop loss in the flag pole is what fuels them. still have my 6520 short

Shorting is my life. Shorting is in my blood. I open my garage. What do I see? Three lambos. How did I acquire them? Through shorting. Shorting is constructive. It makes the world better. I don't believe in shitcoins. Shorting helps us reach their true price: zero. Long live the US dollar. I don't believe in a decentralized world. I only bow to God, family, and country. That's why I short. Shorting runs through my veins. Shorting is my hobby, my life, my love. You should short too. Let's short together. Together we can make this world a better place. Short now, short tomorrow, short forever.
Very smart article talking about technology overtaking itself ie bitcoin compared to alt coins. Uses the example of Myspace coming before Facebook.

What do you think of this post

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8rnibp/fixed_the_bitcoin_market_cycle_chart_with/?utm_source=reddit-android

Look at this guys idea of where we are and then look at the Silver XAG weekly chart.

I hope it's not the same but if it is...

They both dropped when futures went live. 
Failed breakout from that bullflag. Here comes the bart!
This goes outside of crypto to the rich getting richer. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apjNfkysjbM&feature=youtu.be&t=2264

But if that old man isn't lying then the rich go to the bank and get a 4 billion dollar loan. the quote "but in 2 seconds they would give me whatever I wanted" when talking about a big bank.

So many bubbles (housing, medical, education, credit card, auto) thanks to everyone borrowing money.

When no is is left on the other side it comes crashing down.

But with blockchains and crypto this time around things will be different. 

For anyone with young kids by the time they are teens things are going to be so different. 

America really is the piggy bank. 
I think we will break 6k in the next 10 days. I think we get to 5.3 range and then bounce..
The people who are buying now are not strong hands. They have no reason to invest other than believing they will get 10x returns. Obviously thats not a strong hand.

A strong hand believes in the technology and understands it. He understands about the economics and sound money. Obviously these people have already bought. A while ago too. And they are not in a rush to buy more.
Where's the tether pumping manipulation when you need it.  In my opinion we're going to range between 6200-6900 for a few days.
Predicting more downside until at least $2k and then it will just go lower after that. Shorting strategy is the only successful strategy in my opinion. Really no argument for an increase in value. Charts have very little bearing on reality.

F to all the liquidations
I commented on this Wyckoff comparison before. Nobody seems to realise that the second low of the Wyckoff is lower than the first low. For BTC this is not the case. The second low was a higher low. It's all about details.

Wyckoff second lower low:
- This means another longflush of the previous low. Long traders are pulled out of the market and stopped out. This so that they will have to buy back later at a higher price. If then they buy back, and price falls again (third low) below the second low, they will be flushed out again. In the big picture, 3 lower lows that have little followthrough, is seen as seller exhaustion. The two latest lows provide a longflush for the whales to accumulate.

BTC second higher low:
-With a higher low you give the long traders the idea that they are right. You reward them for staying long and they will load up more in the beliefs of a possible double bottom aswell. A higher low gives you the ideal breakdown pattern, because once you crack the first low, not only those long traders will get flushed, but the ones from the second low will bail aswell. It's a double longflush. This is called a big liquidity pool. If you create a liquidity pool in the charts that is big enough, then you can profitably force the price to go there. In this case whales are able to short x amount because they know there will be x amount of sellers once they crush that liquidity pool at 6k, just to be able to buy back their shorts.

With 3 lower failed lows the chance is highly likely that there is accumulation in place. But with two lows forming the breakdown target for the third low, it's less likely. Something to consider.

Markets are all about details and about psychology. There is always the bullish and the bearish scenario, and most of the time they are both quite likely. The difference between a successful trader and a losing trader is not being right or wrong about the direction, but mastering risk- and moneymanagement.
It's the same way a pessimist is on the way up. There were a ton of people that sold $1,000 at the start of last year.

Besides if you believe in the long term of Bitcoin and what it is doing, why wouldn't you buy? If I look at a lot of the Traders on YouTube or tradingview that have a lot of followers. They are wrong an awful lot. 

If you pull emotion out of this we are 70% off the high. Show me any other Market that corrected 70% that you believe in that you would not buy 

Think about that last part for a second
Is it really that surprising? The fundmentals are extremely bullish while price continues down...

*  Regulatory institutions (PBOC) clean the markets
*  ETF's in the making
*  Coinbase offers investments above $250k
*  Institutional investors show serious interest
*  Financial moguls create trading desks
*  Interesting new cryptographic innovations ahead
*  Lightning network seems to work a little bit and gains adoption
*  BTC probably not a security according to SEC

The only thing going down is the price. But that is manipulation.
You are being selective. Havent seen a more bearish forum than this one. 
Probably miners wont let price go down as they wont accept negative profit or the occational short squeeze argument
A&e was mentioned a lot of time as a possibility, not as a fact, we knew that confirmation is above the top.

Triangle was a continuation pattern, but they also indicate reversal, we knew if it won't break the top we're gonna have more down.

Now we just have another unknown situation, but the lower we get the bigger possibility that we're near the bottom.
Inverse head & shoulder ?????
That's the power of ta mate
Preach brother, but they won't listen.
don't forget the hidden the hidden bull divs

Myself is waiting patiently for a 1D cross here https://www.tradingview.com/x/nGPOm9G7 
Permabulls and and whales that want to off load their bags use bad TA and bad analysis of fundamentals to pump their positions. But there are always some buyers at each price level, that's why you get bear flags and short term rallies. 5K is a support, that's all the bulls need to prematurely call a bottom. I've already seen some calling for 5.5k if 6k breaks, as if we'll break a 5 month consolidation to move down only a few hundred dollars.
No not yet. They got an ace up the sleeve. The market cycle chart and also the chart of a bubble is now a sign that recovery is imminent. 
Just some whale pumping and 0 followup
I remember drawing the same thing at 7.5k a couple weeks ago.  An upward channel, making a triangle leading into a different 10k resistance line, all as part of a larger scale bear flag.

Looking good man.
we will be back to 6450 in like 4 hours or less

Edit: i was wrong... This can still Bart down but the formation i was tracking was invalidated. Back to the drawing board. 
Personally I lost my faith in H&S. They never break out the way they are supposed to do...
*The slope of the neckline will affect the pattern's degree of bullishness: an upward slope is more bullish than a downward slope.*

I don't think that really qualifies as a valid iH&S with such a slope.
Here it is https://www.tradingview.com/x/cqLwWgAn/

You have to choose between playing the trendline break (pink) or playing the higher high (orange).  To me, playing a long on the trendline break is the only way to go because a. Shoulders aren't flat enough to play higher high and b. higher high is right at the long term (thick blue) trendline that a lot of people will be looking to open a short off of.

I think it would be better considered a trendline break out than a H&S break out at that point.
good move, I think. looks like this has one or two more legs. Having said that, btc is currently right under trendline resistance but I would bet on long.

personally am waiting for short entry around 6800~7100
Not even out of the range of the bullish engulfing the other day, so it doesn't make me bullish.
I'm gonna convert to long at 6450. This funding is fucking ridiculous

Are you an investor or a gambler?
Chop city feeds on stop hunts. 

The time is for quick scalps, in and out quickly for 1 or 2%. If that's small, increase the size of your position. If it's not enough, open the same positions but in ETH and enjoy double the volatility.

But for greater rewards comes greater risks, so as soon as you go underwater you better close. And by as soon, i mean after a consolidated move that doesn't retrace immediately.

Edit: On your edit, i would put the SL on the profit zone or even 6500. Lock in profits while you can.
Wait until it's over and they pour their gains back in super useful cryptocorns
Trailing stop losses should be your new friend 👍
Patience is a virtue.  I'm currently riding the long train from 6530.  The key is to use low leverage so you can afford to wait.  I don't see this going down much.  Dumps are getting bought up, and pumps take very little volume.
For what it's worth, if open interest decreases while price flattens out it's a sign of a potential reversal. 

The only issue is technically bitmex open interest is up like 300% in terms of btc since February ish. 

Although price is half of what it was there (I have a screenshot at $13k with open interest at 25,000 xbt I think) 

So maybe only 150%.

aaaaand bitmex open interest is now increasing. 95k at $7.6k, 70k at its lowest I saw after dump, now 75k. So bitmex is preparing for a move while bfx is flattening out. 

Most of this price decline really is longs getting liquidated. The thing  is as long as longs keep increasing its just more fodder for downwards movement if new money isn't entering for spot to carry longs higher. 
[deleted]
time for the final plunge.

BTC isn't really useable tech right now. Thousands of backlogged transactions, rising fees (up to $50) and stagnant development for years. It's good as a speculative toy, nothing else.
That average PnL should tell most players they're better off waiting for clear signals rather than making moves at this point.
Did you ever analyze the PnL for short positions, which I mentioned several days ago?

Someone with a short entry at 9860 should have (9860-6450) / 9860 = 34.6% and not (9860-6450) / 6450 = 52.9%
the sorting feature doesn't seem to work properly, unless im doing something wrong? other than that, nice work 
This is awesome and exactly what’s been missing! :)
Divergence needs to be with successive highs/lows, skipping isn't really kosher.

And it's not replicated on OBV. Agree overall though, wouldn't be surprised by a return to confirm the log support/triangle bottom as support turned resistance
Can you post a chart?

I’m having a hard time seeing it.

Could also interprete these as someone wanting to ignite some FOMO with some middle sized market buys, which failed in these cases.
Yes, that is the logical place to open a short. But I think a lot of people here, myself included, have no hope of a better entry and rather position themselves before this breaks. 6500 is a great entry if you think 6100 is going to break and we'll see high 5K before a bounce.

I might be proven wrong in the next couple of days, but I see this and I see a failure to make higher highs
https://www.tradingview.com/x/An9QV261/

Also, the trend being down, patience for an underwater short could pay off if this shoots up to 6800. At least that's my reasoning. Better than shorting 6200.

EDIT: In my case, I have half a position right now, if we do go higher then I can add there. Just playing with probabilities here.
Ya I’m scared to position anything right now. Every time I do a theoretical short in my head I get fukt
Fireworks for the Fourth of July. It will be a new formation where Bitcoin shoots into the sky to the delight of everyone... again and again and again until the grand finale -- a new ATH.
I don't know why, but I was expecting an Undertaker reference at the end there.
Crypto taking out banks is such a cliche.. there's tons of other uses beside edgy "i'm 14 and this is deep" attitude  
Alright Bitcoin, let's get this over with!!
I swear i see this post every day when i come in here. This is so repetitive. If this wasn't a no trade zone for me i would so go long based on this perma bear sub. You guys sound like moon bois lately 

Edit: and no we haven't uber crashed hard into the depth of the goblin town, this is all just noise until you all get squeezed 
It's times like these when everything is pointing down that I start to suspect there might be a random pump
Yep, and it probably takes one crazy buy order of 2K BTC to hit those short stops and end up in the 6800 7000 regions again. 
I shared a similar figure yesterday, but I honestly find it highly unlikely. It’s amazing that I’m seeing more people share this bullish wedge model lately, because nothing about the current market conditions seems to indicate this as a likelihood.
$15k in two months in current circumstance sounds ridiculous.

The only way that could happen is a China unban to increase demand, ETF approval that is btc backed or something else like that. 

Super unlikely, but I guess if i found out in 2 months that insiders knew something I did not and screwed me out of a ton of money, I guess that would not be surprising at all. 
Will you start paying more attention when you start making money instead of losing it?
Considering the value of btc is largely correlated with the amount of users I find it difficult to believe the price would go anywhere lower than 5k. That being said, I would not be surprised at all if we see mid 5k in the coming months
as a big "this time is the same" guy, the main argument would be that 2014 wicked down to 10% of ATH a few times before flattening out. so 10% of ATH would be $2k.

That being said, I don't particularly expect $2k anytime soon. 
Only through some sort of a black swan event, or possibly if altcoin trading steps away from BTC pairs. Just a slow grind down to 2k without anything big to bring us there? Meh. 
Last bullrun/ bullmarket topped out at 1.2K so I expect that to be the absolute low but everyone are waiting to buy there so i guess 2K is a good target for a capitulation wick
The peak of the 2013 bubble was around 1100, and thus that level is strong support and bitcoin could still be considered long term bullish if that level holds. That does not mean the price has to fall there. The only valid technical reason I know of to target somewhere around 2k right now is because that is the measured move target of the large pennant that broke down. It would take a really long time to get down there though, so most likely the trend will change before that target gets hit imo.
Miners won't allow it to happen 
Just another Bart in the making, let it settle and short it for profit
Uhh most of us are just staring at the 1 minute chart.
The whole point of barts is you can't predict them. They are entirely random and inconsistent.

Chart on 4h and above, 15m and lower charts are for Dec-February. Can't use em anymore 

I mean you can do it if you want...but you're likely gonna short low and long high. You're better off just waiting for the position to come to you in this chop. 
If we're using barts as an actual TA indicator, the "face" will sometimes form a forehead and nose before dropping back down. It doesn't have to be straight up and straight back down.

I'm not sure we can accurately make a bart vs. bull flags comparison though. Just look at volume and whether it's due to buying/selling or longs/shorts closing. The barts are simply a result of leverage trading and stop losses combined with low liquidity.
bogdangrad

i can't believe people are still signing up, this shit is so boring lately. there's hardly anything to trade in between the 3 days of movement 

Anyway, I used private internet access. Selected south Korea as my ip location. Said I was in SK on bitmex.. Never used VPN again.

I talk like a complete burger in chat. English n everything.. transferred btc from Gdax.. Don't think bitmex gives a shit 
 TunnelBear-ed my way to Canada and back. Haven't visited since. 
you say you are from Arthur Hayes' natal town to get special treatment.
Ran right into the slope of the descending triangle and created a new point of contact for it.
things will speed up below 6k imo, we'll find a new bottom then a new top and then get boring again.
I agree. But you never know when insane news like “China allows crypto” will pop up. I guess just hope you aren’t shorting when that happens 
Last weekend was immensely slow, but there was good volatility this week.
If I understand correctly, it should pump soon, because there are two "thumbs up" in the chart. Or are there any other reasons?
I don't think you can look at it that way yet. I think these kinds of charts need to be shown in fiat rather than BTC.
Because they are charted in BTC which rose by a magnitude in 2017
The huge volume in 2016 is from the time when the chinese exchanges had zero fee trading and hence a lot of fake volume.
https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/ClyXqInO-The-One-Coin-to-Rule-Them-All-Chapter-I/ 
Or because it is Saturday and people spend time with family rather than with charts :)
The amount of longs seems to be [falling like a rock](https://www.tradingview.com/x/MlY8Rr9w/) atm could continue to do a wick then bounce.Meanwhile shorts remain the same and we are forming a [bearflag](https://www.tradingview.com/x/dle7eCAH) ish on the daily
If i remember correctly, BTC-e was used for money laundering by some russian guy.
That's a hidden bull div but I wouldn't read too much into it
That would be a hidden bull div
Interesting observation
Can’t this be interpreted as a bull flag? Looks like it’s almost about to break. 
So you're shorting based on a higher low being "nothing" and disregarding 5900 and 5k levels?
Yea!!! 6100 cant possibly be bottom because I said so! And it has nothing to do with the fact that I have a short position. /s
There's a few on the right sidebar, for example "Position Bot by u/justanotherlogin". For verification someone built a bot to pull data from bitmex with a read api key, but I don't see it now.
I shorted 6520 on this pump, stops above 6600 
will wait a bit more. If the pump doesn't continue i might short 6500 or so with manual stops if it goes above 6550
That wick on the sept futs missed my short entry by 4$, I am an expert in putting these limit orders :/. Let's see if we get another leg up, however, then i am not quite sure if i want to get it filled this time :-D.
Amen brother, you're not a true believer unless you have faith in the divine to make bitcoin only ever go up.

It is a matter of personal values and integrity- of courage and honor. 

There are no good men on the short side of bitcoin. Only heathens. Heathens who shall incur the wrath of Satoshi himself. 

---

Only the greediest of men look at charts, clasp their hands and pray to Satoshi to say: "But your divine happiness, it looks like it may go down. Please let me short. Just 1x, your Holiness. I just want more."

Satoshi says unto them: "There is but one way to acquire more of the coin of bit, my misguided child."

"Sir, please...I have spent my last penny on the Holy Token. I can assure you it will go down soon."

"My son, to doubt is to not believe. To doubt the coin of bit is to doubt life itself. Now, please buy. The coin is waiting. Go, before I hard fork the ownership of your coins to my own wallet."
SFYL
Lmfao, quality shitpost. 
Longing is my life. Longing is in my blood. I open my garage. What do I see? Negative three lambos. How did I acquire them? Through longing. Longing is destructive. It makes the world better. I believe in shitcoins. Longing helps us reach their true price: infinity. Long live the Internet dollar. I believe in a decentralized world. That's why I long. Longing runs through my veins. Longing is my hobby, my life, my love.

Huh, it's like I'm the opposite of you. 
Lmao. No. Bitcoin is not going sub 500
It's possible, but seems unlikely. BTC is just getting started.
Why do you think so? 
How do you know who is buying and who isnt? Ridiculous unfounded statement. 
Yeah it’s stupid to buy when the market is down, now it’s the time to sell and buy again at the top of the next bubble. 

/s

Edit: u/cyoreligion you see what I’m talking about? I had 3 retarded posts to back mine in like 20 minutes
What about the people who are buying for Dream market purchases, never forget the deep web is 200 bitcoins per day in revolving purchases. 
I'm still dollar cost averaging in daily
Look, it seems you do not believe in cryptocurrencies as future money or in the potential of the DApps that is built on various blockchains as we are speaking. If you believed cryptocurrencies have any role to play at all in the future of the world economy you would not suggest Bitcoin go below $1000.
Remember to post pictures of your lambos once you close your shorts at $50 👌
Bad bot
Sounds either like a highly speculative shitcoin. Or Nano.
[deleted]
17k is probably a safe bet. I'm going all in if it drops below 3k though. YOLO.
those guys in the video, i recognize bogdanovs, bill gates, buffet, rothschild, soros, ronald mcdonald, who's the other one?  I see him in a lot of memes.

u/Merlin560

He posted a few weeks ago, but some of the newer members were not terribly nice and did not show the proper respect, IMO. 
Literally had to short the bottom on like 40x or higher leverage to get rekt. High stakes gambling. 
Last sentence is the key. A lot of people don't understand that.
> If you create a liquidity pool in the charts that is big enough, then you can profitably force the price to go there. In this case whales are able to short x amount because they know there will be x amount of sellers once they crush that liquidity pool at 6k, just to be able to buy back their shorts.

bro can you dumb it down for me? I dont really understand this part
Thanks for this. Super quality learning for us plebs. 

What are you referring to at the second to last paragraph "with 3 lower failed lows"? Lower *failed* lows as in BTC failed to be: low lower lowest?
Thanks for today's astrology reading. 
Doesn't really matter how often you're wrong. Chewy was trying to short the top since 8k, a lot of failed attempts but managed to short 19k and made a lot on it. It's the % of profit what counts.
I absolutely believe in the future of Bitcoin. But I also believe that 70% correction and beyond is pretty expected for an asset that went 20X within a year without widespread adoption. I will absolutely go all-in at some point, but I want to see at least a proper accumulation period.
I sometimes go through those shit youtube channels to countertrade them. It's often very successful! 
But the comparison is not valid, in other markets you own something of value beyond rampant speculation, precious metals, stocks etc

BTC has arguably a better comparison with beanie babies...and no I would not buy when beanie babies crashed 
I don't think so at all, I think it's fear. We have low volume. A lot of retail investors selling. I mean look at the order books. You have all of these $20 + $100 + $1,000 trades. We are 70% off the high. As I mentioned in another comment. show me another Market you believe in that you would not buy if it was 70% off the high.

That of course brings me to one conclusion. A lot of you guys don't believe in Bitcoin and are just in it to try and make a quick buck

The masses are often wrong at turning points. It was pretty hard to find bearish people at the end of last year. Well except professional Traders. I remember chatting with one that was telling me that he was selling everything he had. Also worth mentioning that same person is buying right now. I mean we are 70% off the high and you guys are bearish. That's just hard for me to rationalize
the problem is  'fundamentals' has a different meaning in investing, and it's related to accounting and cash flows.  Bitcoins fundamentals in this sense are horrible.

Fundamental analysis might be earnings outlooks, etc.. which for bitcoin is 0, meanwhile t bill returns continue to increase. Gross transaction volume would be close.  Which is rapidly declining.

Having an exchange that doesnt regularly lose or steal all your investment isn't a 'fundamental'
A trading desk isn't a 'fundamental' neither is 'famous dude bought some'.  Neither is 'john mcafee said he'd eat something gross'

The bitcoin shine will wear off, as all new things do, and people will start to judge it more and more harshly.  









It is an inevitable correction. Yes there're all these good news but smart money ain't gonna buy high. They want a discount and play safe. A 70% correction from ATH seems about right.
And a verifiable lack of interest month by month since January... Remove your tin foil hat, this is what happens in speculative bubbles

By the way, BTCs 'fundamentals' in a traditional investing sense are absolutely awful
>Havent seen a more bearish forum than this one.

Until we pump $300 then it flips into the most bullish place ever.
When it’s going down and everyone here is shorting they’re bears to suit their positions. You think if they’re shorting they’re going to be bullish? They’re praying it goes down. 
They did accept low price back in 2015-16, some were switching the rigs off to cut losses on electricity
I think many people didn't know that A&E wasn't confirmed. Many Twitter gurus simply presented it as a fact.
But what about the longs and shorts? Maybe everybody just closed their position before going into the weekend...
It depends on how far you start, I have both formations like this
https://www.tradingview.com/x/1zKPP5qk/

I think I'll give more credence to the ascending triangle if it makes another point of contact. Like OP said, a break on either side is going to be violent.

On a side note, it's still early to tell but there's also a hidden bearish div forming on the 4H, in red. But it's still early and it can be invalidated if price goes higher.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/mHX9oHJb/
he's cutting off a wick but a flat bottom is a descending triangle

a descending wedge has a sloped bottom at a shallower angle than the top
Not as I drew it, but it certainly behaved like one. I read the timing wrong, but I'm okay holding here. I added a bit more.

!short XBTU18 add 6490 25%
so its time to counter-trade the "most alerted signal" then ? XD
This is your version of people "celebrating" BTC dropping? 
Difficult to say if the lack of a more violent response means the line wasn't important, or weekend malaise making moves small.
Yeah I'm also targeting the major trendline that we broke downward a couple days ago as a resistance.

I'm currently longing NEO on Bitfinex. NEOUSD Shorts have increased by 400% in the last 10 days so a BTC push can really brings some liquidity to NEO
I'm exiting this trade.

Really feel like whales are the one shorting this market and speculators are the one buying because they think whales are accumulating. We are dancing with the resistance line and had many chance make a good breakout and it is not happening.
Well I'm just paying you back for earlier...I'm still up a 5% on the position since I opened it just from funding...
[removed]
Good question.
You're totally right.  Had my head up my ass.  Was getting greedy too.

Even each DCA I had done would have been better to have cut it off on the drop, and reenter lower.  And I had so many chances to close for a small profit.

Thanks for that point on the SL.  Needed your wakeup call on that one, I was about to make a stupid mistake there, what was I thinking, that trade went instantly into 50% profit and I was SL at a loss, what the fucking fuck.  I changed it earlier today to within profit when I got your reply but I didn't have time to reply here.  (really tough to balance personal life and trade life lately)

It's in decent profit now... though I can't bring myself to close it in case this goes further (that's delusional isn't it)

Anyway, thanks for your reply today!  Been frustrated and it was relieving and helpful to read.
first come; first served
yes, could also go the previous months low 
FYI, I just made a transaction for $0.14c There also aren’t any backlogged transactions. 

Not sure if you’re trolling, but thought I’d reply in case you’re genuinely interested.
Stagnant development? Lightning network been the main focus for these years you are talking about. Actually It has been quite successful so far.
That seems to be the formula i use, do you have any example already in the database so i can check it? 
Isn't PnL a little difficult when on bitmex since it's settled in USD. My short has grown in value in terms of BTC on bitmex but my BFX retains it's original BTC value. Same as if when you went long, your leverage is reduced as you go up and profits(in btc) are less and less on the same contract the higher you go where as they are consistent on BFX. a 100K short at 10K is 10 BTC but 20 BTC at 5K for example
Will check it later, any special column or all? 
Ohh I see, yeah I'm honestly a bit new to using divs in my analysis, and that was the part I was unsure about. I guess there aren't really bull divs since the low on the 13th then.
He skipped the lower low in between :P He's new to divs he said 
Gonna need more than a couple hundred bucks near the bottom to incite fomo. 
I hate the feeling of being underwater. I have learned that better entries always come if I wait :(
You know that fireworks explode in the end right? 
You just called Satoshi cliche...
The whole reason I'm interested in this tech at all is because it takes control away from the powerful. Yes there will still be banks, but they won't be able to counterfeit more money for themselves by issuing credit.
i gave reasoning why i think its going to dump soon, thats far from any 'moon boi' post?    
we're down pretty much every single day, you expect the sentiment to be bullish?
perma bear sub?

It would have been retarded to be bullish between 8/9k and now. Would you rather go to a sub where the majority is incorrect and longing the top and shorting the bottom?
I agree. The energy and momentum is totally gone. 
I agree, although the decrease in price is incredibly frustrati g due to good news everywhere. This is the only reason im still bullish for 2018. 
My reason for price decrease is consumers selling, and actual real money buying. Once this reaches an equilibrium we can aim for new highs. I do have the feeling we are approaching equilibrium here.
How about a very big short covering?
[deleted]
You're underestimating the fear of all the noobs that got in after $1400
I can't deny its a possibility. In 2011, everyone panic dumped at $2, thinking it was going below 1.00. In 2014, everyone panic dumped at $200, thinking it was going below $100. In 2018, its possible that we'll see our capitulation panic dump when everyone freaks out about it going below $1000. 

A wick down to $2k *can* happen, pretty easily I think honestly. But I think if we spend any time below $3k, it should be pretty short-lived. A bearish Bitcoin is very scary and goes a lot lower than anyone thinks is possible.
You don't need bad news for lower prices. Its a bubble-popping bear market ..the price will fall with or without news.

That said, theres plenty of reasons the price will grind down:

* Tether

* Many ICOs go belly-up or pull exit scams due to SEC clamp-down, hurting the ecosystem, causing fear and a reason to sell

* Recession hits, people liquidate their coins for cheap

* People were promised $50k at the EOY by their prophets in Twitter, but we can't even get back above $5k, they get fed up and say fuck it.
[deleted]
And how will they do that? Miners are at the whims of the market, not the other way around. Less efficient miners will quit, that's it.

Pretty sure the cost for bitmain and co to mine is like $600/btc. So they could stomach a pretty hefty bear market. 
How would they prevent it from happening? Isn’t this a function of difficulty adjustments? Wouldn’t they be able to still be profitable as difficulty decreases even with super low prices?
Oh ok you mean gambling? Gotcha.
Yup. Added at 6520 after it turned around. 
Or Amazon opens for BTC, ETH and XRP payments. Lots of things can happen.
It started crashing this past Saturday night and all day Sunday
Did you not see the *2 arrows* pointing **upwards**?

Jokes aside, his reasons are written on the chart. The red area at the bottom represents a 4 HR Bullish OB. In our recent dump we've just barely touched it (as you can see by the smiley face drawn on chart). The green area is a 1 HR Bullish Breaker, and we've broke through it. From this point the bounce we're engaging it will hit resistence at the D1 resistance (6638) but breaking through it we'd enter a 1 HR Bearish OB. The next upwards resistance, D1 Bearish OB is just under 6800.

But instead of reading my text you could read the chart though. Thanks for the insightful TA catpizzas32!
so only 1 month left to moon journey, nice
r/BitcoinMarkets is my family
what do you mean
If so, where is the concept 'hidden bull div' explained? I can't find it on investopedia.com. They explain the general principles of a divergence. It's when an indicator shows a different (diverging) trend than the price. Lower lows on price but higher lows on an indicator, such as RSI. Or higher highs on price but lower highs on RSI. That's how I understand it. In the chart I posted, there are two higher lows on price but lower lows on RSI. To me, that shows that the momentum is weakening as the price falls. That's considered a hidden bull div? 
It is not, according to [this](https://www.fxdayjob.com/hidden-divergence-vs-regular-divergence): "Hidden divergence is measured off of the lows of price and the indicator during an uptrend, and off of the highs of price and the indicator during a downtrend (the opposite of regular divergence)."
Yeah it can be. However, in the last month, it wasnt quite profitable to trade them due to fakeouts to the top side and then break down, aka BART.
Failed to make a higher high and just went lower than the April "bottom". We had a symmetrical triangle that broke to the downside with A LOT of strength. Thinking that this is going lower before going higher is the more likely scenario.
higher low where?
It has absolutely nothing to do. My position is purely based on r/r, putting the odds in my favor (shorting the top of a bear pennant, will put a stop a breakeven in case it bounces off the bottom to break up)
cool thanks for the response mate - will keep an eye out. 
yeah that does seem like there's pretty good r/r with your trade, make the market prove it really wants to go up with a pump past $6,600 and if so, not a big deal and take a 1.X% loss.
I agree, this does seem possible.
Cause we were in a bubble. 
Because every time someone says hes buying hes just giving the reason "It will give 10x". There is no fundamental reason given other than that.

For example, what is your elevator pitch for Bitcoin?
200 BTC is volume that gets lost in Bitcoin's couch
Are they strong hands, especially in a bear market? I was asked about BTC for a DNM purchase the other day and it was a bit of a pain in the arse because you wern't quite sure when it would drop 5% or more below what you need (and there's the fees for certain services some friends were using). Granted they may be a consistent source of buyers but maybe not strong hands 
Lambos are for suckers. I'm getting a Tesla.
to be honest even if it sounds retarded that's kinda smart, when bitcoin breaches an ATH it gains a lot of momentum from the hype alone.
Great r/r play as once it breaks ATH it's probably going up much more from there. That's actually a legit strategy I've read about and am starting to try out with stocks. (but we're so far from $20k now that waiting that long leaves a LOT of money on the table if he's looking to build a position)
Me too but a simple buy with no lev to cold-storage, will go on with my life and come back when it moves again.
Sminem?  http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/340/725/2e6.jpg
Nah...I have pretty thick skin.  Its more a work/life thing.  Work is consuming too much of my life.  And at home, there have been some elder issues that have become "chronic", so by the time I get to sit down I am beat.  I've been doing the chart.  Let me see if I can put two sentences together.....
Yea that irritated me a bit...-_- 

plus the dude posted like every day in 2014, he probably doesn't want to go through that all aga
Thanks. That's awful, I loved the detail he would go into whenever he posted.

Edit: I just remembered back in November around 8K he said he hit his "F*** you money" point, and if he converted to fiat wouldn't have to work again. Maybe he got out.

Let's take the example of a double top in the charts.

Double top #1 : The second high is a lower high. For example: 1st high is 1000usd, 2nd high is 995usd. 

Double top #2 : The second high is a higher high. For example: 1st high is 1000usd, 2nd high is 1005usd.

No problem right? Both are double tops. Price is going down in both cases. Well, not always. That small detail means a BIG difference in terms of market participants.

Case #1: There are more short traders with an open position, because they did not get stopped out on the second top. The first high combined with the second high is therefor a liquidity pool. A place where a lot of shorts will buy back and get stopped out. 

Case #2 : There are not many shorts with an open position, because they got stopped out on the second high. The second higher high also lured in more long traders, that fomo bought their position on the high breach.

So as you can see, both cases are double tops, but the underlying participation of retail is totally different. Whales and smart traders make money by winning it from the dumb traders. That is legit the only way how they do it. This strategy is even more effective if you create traps for the dumb traders. If you create traps they will lose more money, and this means more money to the smart traders. 

In the cases that I presented, it's a possibility that case #1 is a trap. Whales are bullish and are filling long beneath the double top. They can fill more long because at a price of 1000usd they know that they will have more buyers to sell their long to than in case #2. Case #2 could be a legitimate double top, because the dumb money has been smoked out. There are less shorts open from retail, and there are more longs open aswell. If it drops down, then dumb money will lose more than in case #1. 

To summarize: Case #1 is more likely to go up and Case #2 is more likely to go down. This when, at first sight, they are both seen as identical double tops.

A simple example of the battle between smart and dumb money. The only objective smart money has, is to create traps for the dumb money. Because the money they lose, will go into the pockets of the smart traders.
Yes indeed low lower lowest. 3 new lows, but all of them bounce back immediately after they hit the new low. So first low, big bounce, second low (slightly under first), big bounce, then third low (slightly under second low), big bounce.

Then why are you here?

I mean your username is arguably laughable. Crypto investor? You have no interest in investing. 

Also  with stocks you don't really own Jack.  If you read the fine print or even look at historical examples the bondholders are who get what's left if the company fails. 

Bitcoin works as a payment system. That's not all speculation unless you don't use it which it sounds like you don't. Think for a minute what life is like and some country in the middle of nowhere that has really inflationary currency. The wild swings of Bitcoin look mild compared to that. That's also a right now case and doesn't consider the lightning Network or any of the other altcoins that may have a bright future. 

Statistically the majority of people don't see the value in a new creation until it's blatantly obvious. That's happened with pretty much every revolutionary example in the past hundred years. 
As someone who wants to enter the cryptospace with some savings I appreciate reading your posts. Makes me consider all the arguments. So many bull dreamers.  Once you are in crypto , you want to drag others in. That is the mechanics of the game.

I have to ask you though. What about fiat and precious metals is actually valuable? They are both abstractions.  Both the value of gold and fiat are social constructions, and not directly derived from  use cases, just like Bitcoin and vintage MTG. Socially agreed upon value and scarcity seem pretty sufficient as value drivers.
When I first started browsing the crypto subs late last year, everyone was jumping for joy and heaping praise on BTC. Now that we've had 6 months of decline from ATH, people are acting like BTC is doomed. This market really gets to people's heads.      
>  that same person is buying right now

I agree. It is fear, but I think as a result of manipulation of the price and narrative around the asset.
Because it doesn't have to stop at 70%, cast your mind back to BTCs price just last summer 
>A lot of you guys don't believe in Bitcoin and are just in it to try and make a quick buck

you must be kidding right? That's like 98&#37; of the retails buyers.
You are right. What I truly believe though is that these prices have not a lot to do with investing. It is more like an adoption curve that spikes and crashes. Like adoption curves of facebook and amazon in their VC phases, before they went public. In those early periods the fundamentals you mention of course are all over the place in any asset. With Bitcoin it is the exchanges and in twitter it was the stability of the datastore. Maybe it it too soon to take Bitcoin seriously and submit it to earnings outlooks etc. It is just tech atm.
But then it was a 300-500 petahash hobby, vs now 40 exahash business. That's a very different situation.
I'm saying here, not on Twitter.
Yup 
Definitely. I'm not taking any action until I see which way it goes. In this current climate, I don't really trust ascending/ descending triangles, to break the way they should.

Edit: really sucks trying to trade breakouts too when there's zero follow through on either direction.

No. This is my version of retarded moon boi posts just in the opposite direction

Edit: The upvotes are the celebrations 
Seems to be acting as resistance now. These sellers aren't messing around...

Edit: And we are back in. Fake out? Now ready to move up maybe ?
Def looking like it was a fakeout shakeout now. Hope you weren't short
Thanks for pointing this out. Definitely going to grab some for the anticipated BTC run-up.
Thanks for letting me know! could easily be another fakeout though :(
As long as it's in profit you can risk a bit more. I'm not so sure its coming down so soon, it held very good above 6500 and even retested 6550.

It's amazing how well we can give good advices when its someone else's position and not our own :)

I think the only difference is that the greed factor is removed and it makes it easier to balance potential profits versus potential risks.

Although i had a great week, i could have won a lot more simply by closing the positions once they got 2% profit and just reopen them again. Most of the times i could even open them higher instead of getting worried for being underwater and having to DCA just in case...

Glad i could help. 
I transact for less than 0.3 cents (0.003 USD). How? BCH.

Now look at this chart here:

https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#1,1y

And tell me that the Core devs fixed the issue. It's only a matter of time until it happens again.
Well technically there literally are thousands of backlogged transactions ([~4k at time of writing, and rising](https://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions)). They won't stay backlogged for very long with current network conditions, and I'm being pedantic and generally think your assessment is more fair than the commenter above for the general user experience, but that particular statement taken at face value is true.  
Please elaborate how the Lightning Network is working perfectly fine so far and solved the routing issue among others
https://i.imgur.com/6bwSWKX.png

Look at the one I highlighted in Yellow
Not exactly sure what you mean but

keeping BTC at Bitmex is implicitly 1x long already. Going 1x long on top of that is implicitly 2x long.

Going 1x short is same as tethering (well, except the funding fees), so your profit is 0% always. One would have to go 2x short at least to make some profits in terms of USD
all, seems like lower numbers sort fine but bigger numbers don't sort like they should
All. You got one of these going on:

4,4,4,3,3,3,27,25,25,25,24,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,1

Maybe values being stored as text? I dunno.
Yeah that isn't a bull div since both RSI and price made a lower low.
Edit made, whoops. Haven't traded off this indicator yet obviously, just figured I would start testing it out since it seems so commonly used lately.

(Also, I was curious if you still play Overwatch hahah. It keeps me occupied during these dead trading periods.)
Ohh haha. I remember those days...

When every divergence post I would make would be corrected by the entirety of this sub haha. 
If you have patience then there’s a lot you’re going to do right in life. But being underwater should not bother you though, just like losing a trade. It’s part of the game. 
At this point of time he is. BTC isn’t gonna ruin the banking system, deal with it. It’s still amazing technology and have a lot of uses and will never go away. 
Some bulls just want to be held and told it's eventually going to be okay
It's not specifically you but there are many stupid "we gonna crash tonight" posts in here and even while i type there is a new one a few comments above this. Every bullish post in here even with fair reasoning is getting down voted to hell and eventually people stopped posting them here. I don't say it about to go up but the celebration of BTC going to the shitter disgust me and it became a bearville which will eventually get you guys rekt. It won't go down forever just like it won't go up forever but you guys can't see anything else beside the next short. 
that guy is a litecoin moonboi. refugees from ltc and eth are super against TA that is bearish 
I would like to go to a sub with a fair discussion about the future on the market not a short celebration only. Maybe it won't go up today or tomorrow(and maybe it will) but it will eventually and i promise you this- the same bear posts will be posted before it will. Just like before the BGD in April. 
This scenario would likely point toward the bullish wedge as a possibility, though I’m not sure if we’re seeing the buying pressure yet that should be showing up near the bottom of the wedge. I’m not outright excluding it as an option. The problem is, the more this model gets shared/believed, the more likely it will dump hard if invalidated.
How big is that short?? I mean the original BGD would look like a French tickler compared to that. 
Is it not trading and hoarding that gives things value? What would be more bullish for price? Less hoarding?
I use it regularly for sending funds to websites that my banks don't allow. 
[deleted]
Agreed. It doesn't take a lot of money to push BTC up by $1000 in a week (by my back-of-the-envelope calculation, $4 billion), so sub $1000 seems pretty impossible this year without something fundamental breaking, and most of us will see the light under 2k and turn bull just like we turned bear at 19k. 
That's not a black swan, that's an elephant in the room
Yes, that's how it ideally works. If price falls, then some miners will stop mining because it would no longer be profitable. Less miners means a lower hashrate, which means that the difficulty will decrease after a while. But it doesn't have to always work that way. Some miners may decide to continue mining, even at a loss, because they anticipate that the Bitcoin that they mine will eventually be worth enough to cover their costs. 
No gamble no future.
Precisely ^

Sorry my labels got chopped off the chart.... zoom out a bit and you'll see WhyDontYouTryIt. 
Thanks. What does "OB" mean?
Never mind, wrong sub
This is quite nice

https://www.fxdayjob.com/hidden-divergence-vs-regular-divergence
Yeah I agree, what he wrote makes little sense
Shorting the top in a 7 month Bear market is the equivalent of buying the dip in a Bull market, so people who complain about this must have quite a strange mindset or trend bias
with 15x lev of course too ;D but small position 
i tryed to send my Brother 3.000 Euro for rent and planetickets to China in 2016. i had to give a Statement to my Bank where the Money comes from, who recieves it, what he will do with it. still took 3 weeks. Second Pitch: you cant take it from me. ever. and there is a Limited Supply wich is very good, humans are collectors.
Most secure trustless network of the world.
Its still buying pressyre for other than speculation.

And dealers hold crypto.
Strong... Cant actually sell your coins all in one place most of the time.

The big global market dealers do all their expenses in crypto.
Yeah sure bunch of Teslas then! Meanwhile can you post a screenshot of your shorts? How big is it 6 figures? How much leverage? You know to show you put your money where your mouth is to those who think you were full of shit.
I can understand the logic behind it, even if I don't agree.  Once a coin/stock/whatever hits an ATH and goes into uncharted territory, it can seem like the potential returns will be much more lucrative.
no the other old guy. he has an open face.

I value your posts.
Thanks man! No worries, life happens, you are doing us a favor after all. 

Just know that although there are lots of new names, a bunch of us remember your valuable and consistent contributions in the past. 
Yeah, him, yolotrades and Joyrider were my first reddit crushes here. 
I'd estimate getting rekt to the tune of 5 BTC or so.
First off, thank you for such a detailed response!

> because they know there will be x amount of sellers once they crush that liquidity pool at 6k, just to be able to buy back their shorts.

Did you mean **to cover their longs** instead of buying back shorts?

I think it's very tricky because the double top at 11700 was actually a lower high. Now the low at 6100 is a triple "middle" bottom :(
?

70% of 20 = 6
101% agree.


That's how you know no one is actually "investing"
Says I must be kidding, then agrees with me

I'm short from 6700 so not worried. Wish I could have sold lower, but still bearish so will hold.
Took 25% of the profit at 6500ish. Looks like the rest is about to stop out at 6450ish, we'll see. 

> It's amazing how well we can give good advices when its someone else's position and not our own 

True that!

I've also accepted that the position was just too large for me to manage with a level head.
Thanks for the link.

I must admit, 68 transactions a second is way higher than when I last looked a few weeks ago. So I was wrong to make my comment based on old data.

So yes, I'll change my comment to being that for general users it's perfectly usable and cost effective atm.

You make a good distinction though.

Edit: Just watching that backlog, seems to be 100&#37; are getting confirmed within the 1st block after broadcasting, so all good!
I didn't say it was working perfectly fine.  But it's working just as good as every other coin out there and it's built on the most secure network we have so far so... It's not right to discount the  tech when it's still the best we have to date.
Thanks, 
it was the real time formula that was wrong. The one i use to calculate the profits and closing position were correct.

Should be fixed now
What I mean is that if you 50X hedged at 20K (for the sake of argument) for 100 btc so your contract size would be 20,000,00 your leverage is reduced but you keep the USD contract size so by the time the price hits 10K your actually shorting 200 BTC because the positions are in USD. The reverse is true on a winning position on the upside. I shorted at 8500 on leverage and the BTC value has increased so for every 1K we go down I get more return. On BFX I have a position around 9.2K but I'm still only earning the same amount of $ every $1000 BTC goes down because my position is in BTC.

I think this has an effect on PnL, can't see why it wont unless I'm missing something EDIT: because it definitely seems it would have an effect on PNL unless its my mind playing tricks
Fixed. 
Like /u/mstrmoo pointed out i was using the text sorting function instead of the numeric one.
I must have used the text ordering function, just need to switch to the numeric one 
Sometimes I do :) switched over to fortnite for a while and then trying realm Royale out lately. it's kind of a combo of overwatch and fortnite in a way. 

You mainly play OW?
/u/nor3g Exhibit B
I think youre being a little extreme but ye those posts are a bit annoying, but its the same when we go up. Just noise just ignore it
Ive noticed an influx of those kinds lately. Getting annoying to be attacked for whatever when you try to be neutral in your analysis/posts
This is a *daily* discussion about the **days** price events. It's that simple. The forecast lately is *bearish*. Other subs are better suited for longer-term speculation, but usually just a bullish echo-chamber always telling you to buy no matter what.
Then why are you in this sub? This isn't /r/cryptocurrency.
I've been here since 2012, and experienced that fear along with my friends during the first crash or two so 🤷‍♂️
Orderblock. Watch ICT videos on youtube. 

They are essentially levels of market maker interest where they are filling orders. All price does is bounce between levels and for now we have rejected further downside off the 4HR OB.
If this is correct, it's not a hidden bull div, because I measured the lows. 

"Hidden divergence is measured off of the lows of price and the indicator during an uptrend, and off of the highs of price and the indicator during a downtrend (the opposite of regular divergence)."

I would suggest that what I indicated is a bearish divergence in an assumed uptrend (following June 13 reversal). I.e. the apparent 6/13 reversal is running out of steam. Which we knew already.
It's just that 276 BTC were bought/sold on the most recent 15m wick on Finex. Moved the price from 6350 to 6390
I agree and I I guess for the actual vendors I cant argue. Just maybe not for the people who are dabbling and may see BTC as a pain in the arse to get to their drugs when the price is going down when they are trying to get their drugs. Vendors are probably the bigger market fore though
I'm not one to brag and show off really.
Lol what's wrong with you 
Well said. Do not forget OracleSeven.
No. They could possibly be shorting above 6k to bring the price down to 6k. Once 6k breaks, there will be enough dumb money selling their longs on which they can cover their shorts that they used to force it down.

You are right on 11700, this was a tricky one. However if you compare that double top to futures (like Okex), they did crush the high.
you made in in an uncertain tone. I told you it is certain and not just a lot of guys but almost everyone retailing here.
I would put it around 6480. It's a 1% profit point and it can easily wick 6450.
On bitstamp it seems to match the low bband also so 6475 to give it just a little wiggle room.
At 100x each bit you risk so you don't get stopped is a lot of profits lost 
To be clear, bitcoin's tps is still only ~7 per second on the base chain. I believe the "transactions per second" in my link is just the the rate of transactions being added to the backlog at the moment you check, not representative of tx rate on chain.
Can you send your buddy who's never used Bitcoin a dollar via the Lightning Network? If so, how?
Looking goooood :D
It can have some impact like you say, but to be fair and treat all positions the same i think it's better to use the current formula
I'm not familiar with Bitfinex shorting.

On Bitmex, if you shorted at 10k, each thousand $ drop gives you the exact same profit every time in USD terms. (10%. maxed at 100% when BTC reaches $0) I don't know why you're making it so complicated measuring profits in BTC unit.
I mainly play Rocket League actually, though I started getting into OW lately with some FortniteBR sprinkled in on the side. Let me know if you wanna play sometime, though I'm sure you're much better at OW than I am at this point.

(jarederaj, please ignore ;))
My post is purely a comment on you and other bulls who are apparently hypersensitive to bearish information. You are perceiving a celebratory mood when, outside of a very small amount of trolls, is not happening. Not knowing you except from what I've read right now, you are letting your emotions color your perception both of this sub and the charts. 

Solid bullish analysis has been welcomed, and if it's truly substantial, will generally get upvoted more than bearish posts.
This and litecoinmarkets are the only subs i like. The rest are just unbearable for me

Edit: when i said future I ment short term future. Sorry for being unclear
Seriously? Why would i go to a sub full of 16 years old moon bois? They are much worse than bearville. I post my opinions on this sub because i like it here and I don’t want this to become r/cryptocurrency2
It might be a younger charlie munger, I don't know.  I'm just frustrated can't figure it out.


Yeah that actually would have been perfect!

It closed it at 6435 (sept prices).  

Price went down to 6400.  Then Bitfinex had a stronger bounce before bitmex fut, so then I reentered at the same 6435 as it bounced up, but with a position only as large as the amount of contracts I had taken as profits earlier higher up.  Then as it went back down I got scared and closed it at break even (minus fees, didn't cover).  And now it's frozen above that.

I'm going to walk away from this before I do something stupid!  I'm way, way too tempted to try to reclaim this long.  Edit: really, just to tempted to force myself into any position in general, not just a long, looks juicy to short but it's not the good moment for me.
Cool, thanks!

Looking at the past few blocks there seems to be around 5-6 per second actually going through, so based on what you say it is *close* to capacity.
Yeah you can just set him up with a wallet like the eclair wallet and then you open a channel and send him funds.  Bitcoin has the fundamentals and UI and user-friendly apps will come. Look at the long term vision... It's much bigger than a fancy wallet to send digital numbers for coffee.
Not quite because your locking in the BTC at that value. If 50K is the contract size stays the same if your short and BTC drops 50% from 10K to 5K then your position is changed from your effectively double the short BTC position. So if you drop from 5K to 4K then your additional profits is somewhere in the region of 10K instead of 5K for the 5>4K move.

If you where short 1BTC on BFX at 10K and the same thing happened an btc dropped to 5K then 4K your gain would only be 1K from the 5K>4K move because your locking in the value of BTC not USD. At least this is how it appear to be. It's a lot more noticeable on longer term trades (or maybe I'm using more leverage than I think maybe)
haha sure man. PM me for account details. 
Your post justify my opposite moon bois feeling i have for this sub lately. When we were going up and people were posting MOON TONIGHT it was retarded regardless the direction of the market and this posts are retarded as well. 

PS: I don't have any position open right now and my cold storage is well in the green and i already forgot about the money i invested because it was years ago so i have no reason to be sensitive about bears. 
Well yeah, the short-term future is bearish.
David Rockefeller
We should know better than to revenge trade, but its stronger than us :)

This is way too strange for me, i'm glad i took the day off from trading.

Would be around break even and would have spent all day glued to the charts afraid of setting stop losses and watching for BGDs.

Can't even see any formation clear enough to bet on. And tomorrow should be the same.

Just sleep out of position and tomorrow you'll have a clearer picture on what to do. 
How do you open a channel without funds on his side?
**ASSUMING BITMEX AND ASSUMING ONE DOESN'T BUY/SELL ADDITIONAL CONTRACTS AT ANY POINT IN TIME EVEN THOUGH HE CAN AS HE STARTS TO GET INTO PROFIT RANGE**, 

If I shorted $10,000 at BTC 10k and BTC drops later to 5k, I make $5,000. If BTC drops more to 4k, I make additional $1,000. If BTC drops again to 3k, I make additional $1,000.

I really don't know what you're saying. It's very straightforward % calculation

I agree that it can't go straight down, which is why I closed my short at 6200 and opened a long, which I have now closed and reopened a short.

>PS: I don't have any position open right now and my cold storage is well in the green and i already forgot about the money i invested because it was years ago so i have no reason to be sensitive about bears.

So you wouldn't want your cold storage value to increase instead of getting reduced further from your paper gains? I don't buy it

Regardless these types of discussions never get anywhere, I'm just going to agree to disagree
You're so right about every point there.  Thanks man, have a good one :)

Honestly setting up a wallet is best to do on chain anyways.  If you expect to continuously be swapping money with somebody is when you set up a payment channel. 
I kinda look at it as a cloudy day savings. I don't need the money and hopefully won't need it in the upcoming years. It's true i want BTC to go up for many reasons beside my cold storage but it's definitely doesn't get me hypersensitive. I hate moonbois equally for that matter
Why not do everything on chain? You can download an app in mere seconds, pay a fraction of a cent as transaction fee (Ilike 0.2 cents right now) and spend it wherever you like. So much more convenient and you don't support centralized payment hubs. Besides, not using SegWit is an obvious advantage as it is a dangerous attack vector (anyone can spend outputs can be spent by literally anyone with a lot of hash power).
Because scaling and latency issues. Larger blocks take longer to download and confirm. This increases the chance of somebody mining on an orphan block which also is a dangerous attack vector. Ethereum tried this (extremely large blocks) and got rekt with crypto kitties... on chain scaling doesn't work and it has been proven. 
Internet speeds increase exponentially, as well as storage capacities. There's providers in Norway and Singapore (among others) which provide 1 Gbit per second speeds. 1 megabyte per 10 minutes is absolutely insufficient. A global payment network must not be congested due to insufficient hardware of end users.

Use an SPV wallet and download the UTXO sets (about 12 kilobytes per day) instead of entire blocks. This fixes the "bandwith issue" and keeps the network free of centralized hubs monitoring and/or censoring transactions.

First sentence of the Bitcoin white paper:

> A  purely   peer-to-peer   version   of   electronic   cash   would   allow   online payments   to   be   sent   directly   from   one   party   to   another   without   going   through   a financial institution.
