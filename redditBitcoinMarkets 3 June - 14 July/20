[Daily Discussion] Monday, June 25, 2018 -- TITLE
#New post: [\[Daily Discussion\] Tuesday, June 26, 2018 →](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8tx0m2/daily_discussion_tuesday_june_26_2018/)
2014 man. I got into Bitcoin. I loved it. I told everyone about it. First coins were purchased for ~350$ and then later 600. Then 200... I learned that Bitcoin liked going down. I tried margin trading but I was bad. I told myself it was learning fees and I should get better. I studied more and read more but found out I pretty much just liked gambling.


By 2015 I'd lost like 400$ for like the 6th time on okcoin and their 20x futures I stopped going to the whaleclub teamspeak and talking to traders and I stopped thinking about Bitcoin pretty much. I stopped coming to this Reddit. All the money I made working at McDonald's and saving up was pretty much gone but I wasn't broke or anything. I lived with my parents and shit was cheap and I found a new hobby in poker. 


I went deap down that rabbit hole. And I got really really fucking good. In fact I played something like 400,000 hands studying in 2016 and then 1.3million hands in 2017 netting me something in the mid 5 figure range of profit. Which is hard to do man. Especially online. I took the knowledge, the risk management, And the money I learned from poker  and got back into Bitcoin when a lot of the people here did. The rally up to 20k. Luckily for me though I only ever knew bear markets. I was born a bear in this world. 


I put in some money. Watched it go up as we went from 4k to 5k to like 10 then to fucking 20. And I held. Then we dropped hard and I'm like oh... Oh I'm ready. We hit 17k and I booted up the old margin trading account and have pretty much been opening shorts whenever I can. Trading primarily on 1D charts. I've knocked out about 10-15 pretty rediculous trades on anywhere from 2.5x to 10x leverage. 



Anyways... The real reason I'm typing this up in my bed at 2 am on a Sunday night is because when monday comes around and I've got to go into work. I'm gonna be putting in my two week notice. I'm gonna be done putting up with my shitty coworkers and I'm gonna be done driving an hour to work both ways every day. Somehow... I got lucky man. I know the variance aspect from poker. I ran good... Really. Really good. I've never had so much btc and it's crazy to me that I do now. All from what I learned these passed few years. I sold. I'm set. For a good, Longgg while. And my life's gonna be changed forever. All thanks to you guys. I'm 95% out and I'll be continuing the trading grind with that 5% and see what I can do with it as a hobby. Cheers guys, the learner's fees paid off for me. This is still gentlemen 🤙

Why do people keep bringing up the Gox three year bear market?  It bears no relation to now.  We haven't had an exchange that processed almost all BTC trades fail.  Wouldn't a better thing to compare to be the $290 bubble burst in 4/2013 that lasted 7 months until 11/2013 when ATH was exceeded again?  It seems that people just want to throw out a narrative that supports what they want it to support, even though the conditions don't remotely match.
Protests are reigniting in Iran again, this time it's from the merchant class, who were a significant contributing factors to the 1978 revolution. Things are pretty heated as IRR value against USD depreciated about 30% within one week. 

I was talking with several of my crypto enthusiast in Iran, we're converting most of our fiat into BTC and other crypto as gold is becoming increasingly expensive due to high demand and government has curbed the supply due to rapid increase in price. Family members and friend are also asking us how this process works. Don't know what the future holds for us but the banking system and local fiat market is becoming very unreliable. Maybe expect a slight increase in demand for BTC and crypto as the government and economy becomes even more unstable. Previously more than 2 billion dollars were sent out of Iran to purchase cryptocurrencies:

https://news.bitcoin.com/billion-iran-purchase-cryptocurrencies/

And yes, bitcoin works as intended. We're escaping a corrupt and failing financial system into a decentralized trustless global economy. Case in point for those who think bitcoin is useless. For the first worlders maybe, for now. FOR NOW. 
Alright, I guess I'll stick to my plan and close my short, since we went above 6250.

!short XBTUSD close 6285.3
Some sound advice for many of you if your first reaction is to start blaming things when your trade goes bad: tether, whales, news, Jesus....

You're not being rationale. You're not being objective. You're not doing it right.

Always consider the market might move in the opposite direction, always have a plan, don't go crossing your fingers, telling yourself that you're right and getting mad and lashing out on r/bitcoinmarkets when shit goes south. That is a great way to lose money constantly and to never learn from your mistakes.  


Don't be that guy. 
Some nice perspective to think about!

Bitcoin will turn 10 years in about 6 months. We all know that crypto markets are much faster than regular markets mainly because they are:

* world wide
* traded 24/7/365
* easily accessible to retail investors

All of these factors provide knowledge to the market that is shared and processed faster than in every other market. Opening hours alone make it **more than 5 times "faster"** than regular markets bound to regular business hours.

That means we almost created an **"equivalent history" of half a century** of market data, market signals and processed information.
Com'on bull, dont let me down
Some people never learn, do they.

BTC is basically an abusive partner at this stage, telling us he’s changed and this time will be different. Then he goes out for a few beers and we are greeted with this.
just realized our bounce was perfectly on breaking below $100b market cap, ha
Closed my $500k long @ $6211 posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8sydvj/z/e151wib), at an average price of $6310 for a gain of 1.6%. Including trading and funding fees, I earned approx 1.75xbt, or $11000.

I had set tight trailing stops as am unable to babysit the position. 
Yesterday someone said "Don't miss the train!".

I was indecisive if i should close my short. I'm happy i didn't. Don't get me wrong, the support @6k seems strong (right now) but the market is unable to create a short-term bullrun after weeks of downtrend nor a real reversal.
Damn that long stop hunt down to $6,070 before the Tether issuance was straight dirty.

Edit: Still holding my underwater long from $6,600, down 5% never felt so good.
Why are there so many .001000 bitcoin transactions on Gdax right now?
I wonder if these tether prints are self fulfilling, if just the news of the printing causes a pump because people think it will pump.

Oh my god. Let this poor boy break out !
A few days ago I asked the traders in this sub about their trading debut. The results are quite interesting.

* More than 50% joined since last year.

* More then 2/3 joined *after* the last capitulation event in early 2015

* Less than 10% are actual early adopters (2009-2012)

* Around 15% entered the market during the last bear market (2014-2015)

* More than 50% are likely "get-rich quick" traders who are in for the money*, more than the tech and entered during bubble years 2017 (41%), 2013 (14%) and 2011 (4%)

(*)assumption

Sauce: https://www.strawpoll.me/15931531/r
20th march: 300 m$ worth tether granted. result: 8900$ -> 6800$ dump

18th may: 250 m$ worth tether granted. result: 8250$ -> 5750$ dump

25th june: 250 m$ worth tether granted. result: ???

i guess they are granting tether to dump bitcoin? but is it even possible?

Someone's bot has been fucking up on GDAX the past several days lmao 
Anyone else showing 0 balance on Binance?
I got scared and wanted to protect my profits. We're forming a bearish wedge, with longs closing and the price failing to move up, and we're sitting right below resistance at $6300. I will probably regret this if we move further up from here, but whatever. I figure I can just buy back in for another long if this starts looking bullish again. I'm 9 for 9 on trades so far over the past two months, and I'd like to keep this streak alive as long as possible.

!long xbtu18 close 6200
I hate to say it, but I don't think the big green candle from yesterday changes anything (analysis below). We've punctured the very crucial support at 6000, and considering that the general despair and capitulation is only *starting* now, I don't see a reason for the market to suddenly turn around *right now*.

The green candles that's frequently showing up is probably some big player that is dollar-cost-averaging (DCA) into a position with bigger (higher volume) buys the further down we go. We can see the DCA pattern on this micro-level chart:

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/sG6dvDYv/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/sG6dvDYv/)

On a macro-level, I think the market will continue a slow bleed since the overall volume is still decreasing. Gravity is doing its thing:

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/oxpQMrLj/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/oxpQMrLj/)

We'll probably continue seeing the occasional big green candles from big players doing DCA, which will stop people out and cause some false/unconfirmed bull divs along the way.

I'm planning to hold my latest hedge from 6600 until at least 6900 (a small loss), unless we confirm some major support anywhere between 3000-5500.
Funny how accurate this was https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/8tgt2d/the_amount_of_memes_here_vs_on_bitcoin_subs_is_a/

and how accurate the reverse on bitcoin sub is :D Ed Seykota knew this  a long time ago

Just watching the big buys/sells, saw two market sells at $6,100 for ~200 BTC each during that last dump which accounted for a substantial portion of the volume. Maybe a long closing, thoughts?

edit: could have easily been a stop hunt too, tons of longs probably put stops just below $6,100 to protect profit/break even depending on entry.
Global markecap only just dipped below 250bil. The level of panic I saw and partially felt, specially over the weekend, now feels way out of proportion.

BTC dominance been going up since start of May but the clear BTC - alt correlation remains. Assuming the correlation is still there and assuming this was at least a temporary bottom, I think a lot of altcoins are really juicy for a little flip but BTC accumulation is still my primary goal.

Starting on the weekly, it really doesn’t look bad. I mean, more than a full retrace of April gains and taking out Feb low isn’t fantastic… BUT (heres the hopium), the weekly ended up closing above Feb lows and looking at the weekly RSI, it has been chopping around 50 (I could be very wrong on this but doesn’t RSI chop around 50 imply consolidation?) https://www.tradingview.com/x/8F0VYnjn/

More hopium on the daily, I believe the Sunday dip was a 6k SFP, liquidity pool dip, stop hunt, whatever you want to call it. Some decent volume on the bounce back a very nice, long lower wick and bull div on the extreme side of RSI. Not bad. https://www.tradingview.com/x/F4Rlupy2/

1H is a bit mixed. A nice volume bar on yesterdays pump and a low volume consolidation but 6160 is proving to be tougher to break. That being said, we're still in the range I drew for myself on Saturday so that’s encouraging. https://www.tradingview.com/x/G1DoMd3W/

What I would love to see play out but doubt it will: slow consolidation in low 6xxx and then slowly working our way up. That being said, this would be a perfect scenario imo, both for alts and btc but perfect rarely happens so I wouldn’t count on it. A slow rise like that would give alts more than enough time to establish some decent support and start pumping. Again though, this is hopeful thinking. https://www.tradingview.com/x/4JDxavnl/

My only current position is 5820 long September futures. Don’t have a clear plan for this one yet. Got stops but im considering riding them out until September. If we climb just hedge short spot near resistances but still nothing concrete for now.

As I said at the start, alts are dumped heavily, the weekend dip wasn’t that bad (in hindsight) and the correlation between alts and btc is still very strong. Im most likely going to be playing mostly alts on this bounce but because this market mugged me off too many times, im gonna use really, really tight stops on this and move slowly, rather buy after a breakout as it comes down and tests a solid support rather than try to bet on a break out.

Interesting to see how London open in an hour is gonna react to what happened over the weekend.

Because my post was overly bullish, heres some bear hopium: this gent has been writing abou Cartel price surpression since the CBOE and CME futures came out and hes been on point so far. hes calling the bottom at 95% from 20k so around 1k. https://blog.goodaudience.com/cartel-strike-3-bitcoin-drops-10k-to-8k-next-stop-15k-or-5k-4b9d697e5675

TLDR: VERY cautiously bullish, still in a bear market so very tight stops and only looking for small - medium flips. Hopefully we slowly consolidate and start climbing with a bit of volume but im not expecting crazy parabolic growth until the ETF is 100% confirmed. 

Good luck
Thank you based Tether

We will forever honor your name as we remember the V reversal and start of the Golden Bull
I'm not saying this is reversal, just remember that we will know about a reversal after price spikes 30-50% and a lot of people will lose a lot of money trying to short it.

Just watch out and have your stops tight.
A brief moment in the sun. For a moment there I thought this hell might be over. But alas, Bears seem to be here to stay.
Time for some bullish comments:

- We have 4h and 1d Bullish RSI div, 1d bullish MACD div. All confirmed.
- The pattern we failed to breakout 5 times ago, now we finally broke it 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/2TQ4h4MS/

- The selling pressure looks fade away, just now I notice 500 Long order was closed when Bull try to push the price higher than $6200  1 hour ago, at least short term profit taker was out (most that long probably open when we are around 5k8-5k9)

Sigh well we know what happens next.... the push to 6300 got rejected... BART down imminent.
Jesus. The daily discussion on /r/cryptocurrency definitely makes me think we’ve hit the depression phase. It ain’t what it was when we were hovering in the 6k - 8k range (I.e memes about the bear market, people saying fuck it I’m not selling, etc). There’s a real vibe of melancholy now 
I was about to fomo in.  bogdanoff was a bit too quick with this call.
Can someone explain the current state of GBTC, which trades at 10.03 as of writing this?  Does it currently hold 0.00100231 BTC/share?  AKA pricing BTC @ $9,976.  Or am I missing something ie them selling BCH and BTG?
I don't really want to go to bed with a position open tonight, unless it's clearly in profit and I can set b/e or profit stops. Hopefully we get a resolution soon. I imagine most people are watching this or some version of this: https://www.tradingview.com/x/KhlIh2Wb/
I don’t day trade simply because I couldn’t be able to short emerging-revolutionary asset which we all (mostly) believe it will worth much more one day in the future.

Sincerely, congratulations to all the bears for having a balls of steel to short Bitcoin, especially on this prices 60-70% lower from ATH.
The bull market hasn't stopped for even a second, and we're seeing conclusive evidence of that. What we experienced was merely a gentle correction from $20k to $6k. Carry on as usual people, nothing to see here, things going according to Satoshi's masterplan.
Still all fiat and completely empty exchange accounts since 7k fell. Still no plans to buy back in any time soon.

Taking this time out has made me realise I was mostly trading "noise" previously. When I do buy back in, I'll be making much longer term trades.

If I had a position (or was looking to open one) around the time of the recent green dildo, I may have closed my short early or FOMO'd in long. Sitting on the sidelines it's much easier for me to see that it was a totally insignificant event and shouldn't really change my bearish/bullish bias.

TLDR; not trading is making me a better trader.
Bailed on my short. Will reshort after people realize tether won't save us.
bitflyer wicked to $6700 on that pump lol:

Welcome guys and gals, I hope you had a wonderfully volatile weekend  with us in the Crypto-Space. Bitcoin bounced quite strongly after  dropping below $6000, but only when the support level mentioned in my  previous report failed. Personally I think many main stream investors  had their confidence shaken with the exchange hacks, EOS trouble and not  to forget the Tether printing press.

While some exited the markets, surely other market participants  jumped at the chance to get some discounted Crypto coins this weekend.  If this weekend’s action made your stomach turn, maybe you should  consider safer investments such as metals, ie silver or gold. For those  of you that are having fun hodling and experiencing 1st class  volatility, you are a part of history, what goes down ….

Lets take a look at the [1 Candle Bitcoin vs US Dollar charts](https://cryptosignals.trade/forums/topic/bitcoin-btc-price-analysis-june-2018/#post-17846).

I know there is a lot of fear out there in the market at this point,  rightfully so, the market is still in a clear down trend. Any buys here,  like I mentioned in previous reports, should be considered HIGH RISK.  For the higher risk players, we are looking towards the 6k level acting  as support for a third, and possibly a fourth time, as a good sign.

We can notice that the volume has decreased significantly since  December last year, and the MACD is confirming that the price action and  momentum are coiling tighter together, getting squeezed as the market  nears its decision. Notice that despite the bloody weekend the massive  triangle is still in tact. This is another positive signal for the  higher risk trader, looking to take the risks to get maximum rewards.

The good news about this triangle is that we should see some action  before or after the 4th of July. Even though no candlestick formation  has a 100&#37; success rate, in the past traders have found that descending  triangles have quite a high chance of a bullish breakout.

On the flip side, $6000 is now a critical support zone, should the  market consolidate below here, the triangle will be invalidated and we  could see Willy Woo’s price prediction of low $5k come true.

Resistance is around $6800 – $7000 for me personally at this point,  and I am expecting some bulls to show up to the party should we  consolidate above those levels this week. Safe trades.

Trading Tip: Be sure to set up your OWN RULES for your OWN TRADES,  BEFORE YOU ENTER THEM. This will help you to make the right decisions  quite a lot faster, such as, should I take a loss?, should I take  profit?.

Fortune favors the prepared.
As always: Slow pump then dump. Boring.
We are only ~$500 away from seeing some real blood on the street. 

$5,500 was the support point that held during the bull run after it was rejected from $8,000. If that goes, the next support would be at $3,060

Back into my short this morning.

!short XBTU18 6140 5x 25%

Mostly just a hedge short for now.

I had said yesterday that if we couldn't crack 6300 I'd be looking to reshort. This appears to have no intention to break out. If it does, I'll definitely look to exit after a break of 6500, where I'd take a 6% hit.

I'm watching this descending channel / wedge play out: https://www.tradingview.com/x/m9NvSTsM/  

At this stage, the trend is clearly down. New lows, little follow through on the bounce, alts not recovering, etc. I'm looking bigger picture, which is why my stop zone is so high.

Good luck all.
Trace says it's a good time to buy:

The current Mayer Multiple is 0.63 with a $BTC price of $USD 6,282.50 and a 200 day moving average of $10,036.61 USD. The @TIPMayerMultple has historically been higher 94.66% of the time with an average of 1.55.

what is the best book for technical analysis for cryptocurrency? 
So what’s with this every day there’s a 50-60 sell wall on gdax a lot of the time? Any guesses as to why? It’s like always 50-60
That 1Month MACD bearish crossover is pretty scary. I wonder if there's going to be enough juice in these bull thrusters to break even on this month (about 7500$).

This coincide perfectly with the 1.618 extension from the 6850$-5750$ drop and the weekly 50EMA.

Let's see how this develops in the second act.
This is the dump (Target between 5900-6100) where you go long if you didn't do so at 5.8k. 
Rescaling into a short here.

First entry is $6334

This pump should provide some great entires for a short 

I’m also going to start using position bot 

!short XBTUSD 6334 5X 25%
This resistance test was felt as pretty critical by the market. This explains the over reaction. On the bigger picture it's just a 100 dollar dump following a 500 dollar pump. It seems it found support at 6130. 

This was spectacular but not that bad looking at the bigger picture. We probably won't retest the resistance today but I feel anything can still happen.

Edit : support broken. Am I deloosunnal ?
I'm seeing crazy stuff on GDAX, buying and selling .001 over and over.

Closed underwater shorts at $6139 for a small loss

The Bitmex DOWN option contract is currently sitting at ~0.0045 BTC per contract (0.1 BTC). With a strike price at 6000 that seems like a decent price.

Would someone check me on the below calculations? I’m curious if I’ve understood this right...

If I believe that the market will close below 6000 (the strike price) before contract expiry it would “only” cost me 0.45 BTC to hedge 10 BTC (100 contracts).

If we close at 5500 by expiry, I would also have earned about 0.9 BTC on those 100 contracts.

People say there's still no despair. Meanwhile i noticed many self claimed long term holders (pre - 2015) stating doubts about btc's future.   


Can you imagine losing faith as a long term holder? Can you fucking imagine losing faith as a long term holder when you're actually still up well over 200&#37;?  


BTFD...
Damn, every little spike in the price there’s a spike of salty bears posting here their deluded theories about why this can’t be real and that everyone lost interest. BTC is not going anywhere and you should probably forget about your fictional goblin town. we just had a 7 months bear market which 20,000 to 5800 is the equivalent of a bull run in the opposite direction. Deal with it
Waiting for Bart again. I'm sure there are coins easier to trade than BTC nowadays.
Is bitmex down for anyone else right now?
This market is now evolving at such speed that it may not have the time to organically find an absolute bottom. Institutional money is not going to be a meme for much longer. It's happening right now, although it's just at the very beginning.

Novogratz estimated that there's 20% chance to see the flood gates opening in 2018, 60% in 2019 and 20% in 2020.

I read some comments here the past weeks that $6000 is the bottom, because that's down 70 percent from the all-time-high. I'm not an expert at all but let me share a quote from the dot.com crash [1]:

> Of the 280 stocks in the index, 79 are down 90 percent or more from their 52-week high. Another 72 are down 80-89 percent. Only five are down less than 5 percent.

I'm not trying to state or convince anyone that Bitcoin will crash or correct this far. But I do find it a bit annoying to read some people calling $6000 "the bottom". Don't fool yourself. Nobody knows where it stops. This slow bleeding and sideways moving can go on for a very long time.

longs adding more and more, shorts closing and price is going sideways...even if we were to break 6250 this run wouldn't last very long before bulls are exhausted. we really need to break these longs before we can rally again.
How long do you market sleuths think this bear is going to last? What’s the general sentiment? Are we closing on bottom soon?

Tether printing is a leading bearish indicator as of late in my opinion. People about to offload BTC and move into USDT?
When peak to peak volatility between bubbles begins to tempur then that is when the maximum potential for Bitcoin/ Fiat valuation will finally begin to come into perspective. Until then it is an untethered beast with unknowable potential. This volatility is a testament to the maturity, or lack thereof, of the beast.
price action is very similiar to previous price action before dumps. complete failure to follow through with pumps. Also got 5k less shorts from less than 2 days ago and more longs. doesn't really bode well for bulls, very low risk to short here with a <$100 stop
Buy wall moved lower on Finex, never a good sign.
If we can keep it ~1.5% above 24 hours ago for the next week, I'll be pleased. That would set up a nice run.

Massive hidden buy wall on BFX at $6,245 - over 400 coins sold into it just now, didn't budge. Hmmm interesting.

edit: second attempt selling into at as I type this, let's see what happens.
The longer and lower we go with the slow drooping bart style of price action, the bigger the final capitulation will be. The pressure will just keep building until it finally happens. Nothing we have seen so far indicates a bottom, its just a steady downtrend with the occasion spurt of impulsive buying, then some sideways testing resistance, and eventually another drop to lower lows. My original prediction for the bottom was 5400 but the fact that we are just repeating this same style of price action so close to it leads me to below that the V bottom will be much lower.

Soooo, failed squeeze attempt above $6300 to start some covering, is that what I just woke up to see?

Hard to be optimistic about this bounce given how many shorts have covered and longs opened.

I've been in a *very slow* DCA mode on some alts since 7k broke (I'm a Bitcoin sceptic using BTC price as an overall crypto sentiment gauge for the time being, don't judge me), and so far the market action isn't giving me any sense of urgency to speed up my buy-ins. Which is sad cus I miss the moon memes but oh well.
Funny.... when we drop 100 or 400$, we all see  4k and even 3K. Messages from...??

When Up a few dollars the same people show up here with the same message.

And these are not the same persons when we were at 600$ or 1200$.
Added 25% more to short at $6265 

Tether pump ran out of steam and for other reasons 
6250 resistance.... this market is doing the most predictable stuff right now. Bleh
All the shorts closed during the sideways yesterday. We have no fuel to go up and more underwater longs.
How is this sub feeling today - bullish or bearish?

I'm cautiously bullish as personally believe that we test bottom of the triangle (6900-7000) before we go down to lower 5s.. a big roadblock to that view is futures expiration this week.. may be it all can happen in this week, considering the volatile price movements.

July futures open next Monday..

Sitting on the edge. 
Never heard of Bit-Z and now there's a huge ETH/BTC volume on that exchange. It's accounting for huge spike in BTC trading volume 
Let’s see how [this potential rising wedge](https://www.tradingview.com/x/qzOGutsS/) completes.
No Shorts now ?
Hoepse floepsie...

When that $250 mil of tether going to pump this market? 
People like to compare this bear market with past bear markets because it provides them with hope and support. But the truth is, any comparison with past bear markets is silly. Back then, crypto was new and the possibilities seemed endless. It was an interesting speculative investment because the public had no idea what was brewing. When the market legitimately crashed it was because of real events like the Gox hack.

Now, there is no one single event that causes this bear market. We are coming down from an unrivaled bull run. The lack of follow-through of the hype is making investors wary. The endless possibilities people were fantasizing about don't appear to be happening. Investors are rapidly losing faith in the market and are discovering crypto has been substantially overvalued.

What is happening is now is that the market is shrinking organically, and I don't think it will grow again before there's some real adoption. We need *real* use cases, not potential ones.
How do I interpret the fair basis rates for the (ALT)M18 and (ALT)U18 contracts on BitMEX?   If EOSM18 has a fair basis rate of -94&#37;, does this mean that shorts will pay longs -94&#37; of the value of their position per year?

I am aware that it changes.
Model price based on tx rate: 7-day average: $4082, 28-day average: $4570.

 Model price = 10^-0.638 \* (tx per day)^2.181 / # total coins.

Explanation is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2hyl9c/daily_discussion_wednesday_october_01_2014/ckxhy9y) with [historical graphs of price vs. model](https://i.imgur.com/KOzbcx6.png) (last updated 2018-06-25) and [graphs of other correlations](http://imgur.com/a/7koaG) (last updated 2017-01-30). The code is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2oyrfq/code_for_tx_model/) if you want to improve on it.


**Accuracy of model and recent bearishness**

 Note, that this model has been doing relatively well if it is within *the same order of magnitude* of the price. That is to say, it is not a very accurate predictor of price, and to be within a factor of two of the market price (as recently) is effectively no strong signal. However, the prediction did dip just before the recent pop.

**Batching, UTXO count and so on.**

I have seen no convincing evidence that batching is currently a major effect to reduce the daily tx rate, and a cursory examination shows a similar dip in the UTXO network measure.
I am interested, long term, in alternatives to tx rate (given lightning etc) but I do not think UTXO count is a convincing alternative over, for example, unique addresses.
Parsing the blockchain directly for outputs per block is one possible alternative to deal with batching, payment channels notwithstanding.

and thats how a day of buying is wiped out in mere seconds :)  
its not pretty, but its pretty effective.  

Here we go. Inverse h&s.
This is looking and feeling so much like the 6.8k bull flag from June 18th.
I'm curious to know how the halting of Mt. Gox coins being sold, for now, will affect this market, if at all.

Why the down votes, this is a legitimate question / potential discussion?
I’m making the move from Kraken to Mex tonight.

The UI and everything on Mex is a hell of a lot more confusing. Tons of more stuff too 

- Fees, futures, Yada Yada Yada

Anything in particular I should know about mex prior to transferring over? Besides the fact it shits the bed during any violent market move 
This guy Trump gonna start an all out trade war. US Equities getting squashed today. 
So.... we about to Bart or Bart up? Asking for a friend. 
There have to be so many noobs here, I just can't tell why anyone is surprised by this behavior if you've been following bitcoin beyond the last 18 months. 

This is exactly what bitcoin has always done and will continue to do. It's human nature to try and find patterns, but damn, it is quite random to a large degree, some of y'all are like a few bad decisions from being a crazy bag lady out on the streets thinking the CIA is poisoning your coffee to keep you down
I am confused... short positions still declining, What am I missing here? Three days ago sorts were rallying on this level - what changed?
We are about to witness a drop or pop up. 
Ah so that 8% pump was pure tether move. Pretty sad news for bulls.
Bull market confirmed. Tether just printed 250 million more 
This level is the turning point between a bottom + sideways + potential bullish market in the future from here, or a massive crash in the next days, it was a pleasure regardless of the outcome to trade this :)
Am I the one who is stupid? Why do I keep seeing stuff about tether being printed to ensure sell side liquidity to make sure its value stays at 1:1 USD? Like bro, tether is owned by bitfinex, not Kraken, and kraken is only USD - USDT market (tether itself gives you USD when you give them USDT, why would they care about krakens market, let alone be in control of it). What the flying fuck is this idea based on? I've heard a few other ridiculous explanations on tether.


Either tether is legit, and they print it as a fiat onramp, or its a scam and they print it whenever they want to buy bitcoin with it and sell it for fiat. Legit is more likely, IMO, although it could still get shut down (good bitmex research article on this). 


But either way, what reason could there possibly for that scenario I keep seeing mentioned?
On the 15 min you can see a clear bulltrap.
Please stay this low till Friday when I get paid! I'm trying to scoop more Btc/eth/ltc up!
Alts are getting hammered.  I think we are ready to drop again.

You're living the dream man. I have nearly the same journey as yours, instead I didn't short the top. I'm in the process of losing everything. Taxes here will soon finish the job. You did everything right. Congrats, I mean it. I envy you!! Enjoy your life :)
Well done. Looks like your obsession with gambling and  the prior regret lined up perfectly with the market.

Buy some property so you don't blow it all on silly stuff.

Poker changed my life as well. This game represents so many aspects of life, it’s astonishing
Woah, its been such a long time since I saw this username. I've also posted my story when I lost it all, multiple times. I have it on my blog which is down. This is the first part. But here it is:

Posted by ibankbitcoins on Tuesday, 27 January 2015
Last week when bitcoin dropped to $160, many traders lost their shirts or quit. I empathize with you all. I said I would go over a few short stories of my past.  I have personally lost fortunes trading the stock/futures market, multiple times. I would not be the person I am today if I hadn't paid the most expensive tuition of all.

First, I can tell you I am no different than any one of you. I understand the feeling of losing it all, it hurts so much that I've adapted and become more disciplined as a trader. So here is my first bust of the series.

I first started trading during the 2008 crash. The young and naïve version of ibankbitcoins bought his first share of a stock, read up on technical analysis, and visited forums and blogs to search up “good” trade ideas (for the record, my blog is legit).

With a gain of 30% in 6 month, I was confident as fuck (the usage of language here is to describe my sentiment and confidence at the time). I bought and shorted stocks like nobody’s business, increased my leverage, trading in and out all the time. I was buying up FAZ (3x leverage of the inverse financial sector index). General market was tumbling, so shorting the bounces was the way to go. It was good times until 2009 march, when market bottomed.

My account went bust in less than a month shorting an unprecedented rally in the finance sector. I smoked too much hopium and was too prideful. What is interesting about this bust is this: While I was holding on to shorts during market rally, I knew I was wrong and I should get out. But, I didn’t. I was too stubborn to admit my paper losses; I became a holder of my stock rather than a trader. Every day I hoped that market would fall back down so I can exit. I did exactly what Jesse Livermore described. God, I wish I had read his book the first time around.

> "When the market goes against you, you hope that every day will be the last day – and you lose more than you should had you not listened to hope. And when the market goes your way, you become fearful that the next day will take away your profit and you get out – too soon. The successful trader has to fight these two deep-seated instincts." --J.Livermore

The pain was so great because I lost an unfathomable amount of money for my age. Only when the pain is great do I seek help and change. Because my first bust, I had learned to put my pride aside and stop revenge trading.
Cheers man, best wishes in life. Congratulations on making it on your own sheer will and persistence.

Any reason why you're picking now as a point to cash out? Is it more to do with bitcoin or just your personal life in general?

Also, how'd you get a best of 2014 trophy if you were so bad at margin trading? Haha you must've contributed something! 
If true, that's awesome, all the best!
Good work on moving to trading crypto, the odds are far better (:   

Whats your risk management like these days? Do you use fixed fractional?
Good opportunity for me to ask..is there an online poker sub you could point me to? 
which exchange did you use for shorting? I mainly trade on gdax...can't short.
All to buy more Doge.
Is that another print?
Thank you based Tether
Why do they always seem to do these things in giant lump sums? One would have thought that 1:1 backed stable coin, which is apparently used as a gateway to/from fiat, would require daily adjustments.

As a side note, has anyone here ever redeemed tether for USD (or vice versa) directly? 
THAR SHE BLOWS
Are the institutions finally coming to save us? 
They bring up 2014, because it bears many similarities to 2018.
Unfortunately, *both* 2013 bubbles were created by the Mt. Gox Willy/Marcus buying bots...
Then again... people lost faith after two artificial bubbles and seeing we could *organically* bubble ~15x in 2017 is pretty reassuring, at least for me.
> $290 bubble burst in 4/2013

That may well have been entirely Gox's doing too as nothing quite like it has happened before or since. 

Wherever you look and wherever you go, Gox is with you. 
Exactly right. Any comparisons to 2014 are silly. 2015, maybe since the Gox dumpers were starting to run out of coins by then. 

You'll never hear a solid bear argument because there are none. They say, "2k's gonna be epic, dude!" Then the upvotes pile up, and a few hoorahs are added to the chorus. Reddit is becoming almost unusable due to the trolling and shilling. Fortunately, Honeybadger still fails to GAF.

Where can i short IRR?  /s
[deleted]
In relation to this post, another two countries that I'm keeping my eye on in terms off people running from fiat to crypto are Argentina and Turkey.

Both currencies are loosing value quickly but i believe the political situations are bit different with Turkey being a bit more like Iran

edit: forgot Venezuela
Why don't you convert to a stable crypto coin instead of BTC? 

If protecting your funds is the main driver instead of speculating, that would do a much better job.
Wish you good luck buddy. 
...very bad moment for them to lose their savings with BTC.

No, mostly it's your fault.
I mean.. 

You short from $6090 after being rejected at $6300 for now a second time.

Tether prints $250 million and a green candle comes out of no where.

You have every right to blame tether for that bad trade. You can only blame yourself for not closing when the news was released 
One thing that does sort of concern me is something /u/SloppySynapses pointed out a week or two back. In 10 years there hasn't been a real, bona fide use case established - at least not as far as I've been able to determine. SoV is compelling, as is potentially a hedge against fiat inflation, but they're not what excited me about this whole thing in the beginning.

I am excited to see what second layer solutions bring to the market as I don't see any blockchain truly scaling without them, but not getting there in 10 years does make me at least a little bit sad.
Shouldn't this be in Bitcoin newbies thread?   It doesn't have anything to do with the market.
Except all the other things important to the price aren't running 24/7 - like app develpers, fintech, etc. Just because you can buy a computer 24/7 now instead of when retail stores were open doesn't mean it's undergoing innovation or market testing any faster...
Yeah, 50 years of market action in 10 years...fits bubble chart perfectly, “this time it’s different!”
what? Those are some very random claims and conclusions. 
Youve been tricked, that was no bull, that was a bear taking a deep breath...
We're already up 5% since yesterday. Very rare for it to pump again in this bear market. That was a good trap and ez short for anyone realized that.
Yeah, very coincidental. I've looked it up, but can't seem to find any substantial proof, is it true that futures can't be traded on markets under 100B?... or do you think it's just a psychological marker for the market?
Ok, messed this up... Going to fix it in the database.
The averaging got a bit off according to the bot's calculations but i'll trust your input

Edit: i managed to screw both the updates i did on your position... Not only i suck at trading i also suck at reading... Sorry about that.

Should be all fixed on the database now.
how the heck did you have the balls to sit through the drop yesterday to $57xx range without closing? nice + trade
[deleted]
always do the opposite of this sub
patience. 

It will be
>  the support @6k seems strong

Broke under twice. Hanging out in $60xx range. No V-bounce. I don't think it's strong. My current thought is another ugly leg down to Goblin town. Around Labor Day, maybe things turn around.
got me good
This market is really full of manipulation, poor trader who got liquided just now
bots 
Same as when we went down
Was just about to come and ask this myself.
Never seen buying action like that. It's like someone's bot just blew a gasket and his in a loop of buying and selling .001 BTC.
it happened the other day, bot did not takes its Ritalin or something.
Someone has a broken bot :O

Fees are going to eat up his entire bankroll.
Agree with you but thinking it as self fulfilling could be self fulfilling too - inception!
It is at least somewhat. There are bots that automatically buy on tether printing news. 
It's probably a high frequency market making bot fucking with another high frequency trading bot. Someone is going to wake up to an empty account, and it's not going to be the market maker.
i think it would do the opposite..real people would see that bs and just won't be sure what to do. Most real people trade by seeing what the market sentiment is...oh look lots of big buys and small sells? buy...lots of big sells and small buys? sell 
can someone explain whats happening on gdax currently and when this started?

bad coded bots?

there is no follow through because in a bear market there is no FOMO from the buyers 

oh noes the price went up $200. Meh, just wait a few hours and the price will come down to where you are comfortable at. And then you decide, well if its not able to break through, better lower my buys for when it takes another leg down. 

sellers its quite the opposite, as the price goes up, stop losses get moved up. And once the price starts dumping again, there is FOMO to sell because every dumping just goes straight down without revisting the old levels. i.e. the last dump started at $6,700 
What about "get moderately wealthy slow traders who are in for the money" ?
> More than 50% are likely "get-rich quick" traders who are in for the money*, more than the tech and entered during bubble years 2017 (41%), 2013 (14%) and 2011 (4%)

You can tell this from all the pro-regulation comments.  Go back to 2014 or earlier and you find very few of those.  What they don't get is that regulation is a big reason why the price falls, not rises.
Class of '11 here.   Wasn't able to turn a profit until '17, though!
I dont fall into any od these categories
This pretty much answers the whole "who is selling!?" question. Noobs caused this bear market, and will continue to. It's the same every cycle.
Everything is selling into tether to wait this out. Most/all that tether will flood into coins that weather this bear market the best. You know that because nobody ever sells tether for actual cash.

https://www.moonmath.win/alt.html

Switch that chart to show 30d performance.
Its a strange one. You would expect a massive pump but the 300m and 250m ones caused dumps. I dont get it myself. Maybe there accumulating and a massive pump at once?
[deleted]
Yes, it's possible to use tether to short, as well as go long.
20/3 and 18/5 to fuel the first bull trap at 9k and 8k5? Buy bitcoin and dump later I think. For this time, we already had 3 bull trap at 8k5, 7k7 and 6k8 so I am not sure if they do it again.
Yea, I just noticed this continuous stream of alternating buys and sells for .001 bitcoin. I told GDAX to go home, you're drunk, but that didn't see to help. Maybe it's a Garz, er I mean, off-by-one error?
It's also inflating the volume on GDAX. I wonder if this will affect other bots that respond to volume spikes. This could get interesting.
Most likely due to the update. Look under show balance your coins should show there.

> I'm 9 for 9 on trades so far over the past two months, and I'd like to keep this streak alive as long as possible.

This is what every trader should aspire to say. Not "I'm 2392 for 6492 in the last week"
> On a macro-level, I think the market will continue a slow bleed since the overall volume is still decreasing. Gravity is doing its thing:

Theoretically volume could be 0 and all it would mean is we weren't moving.  If it were 100K per day and it was 50/50 buy/sell we still wouldn't be moving.  Why does low volume necessitate a crash?  Wouldn't low volume just mean for the moment Bitcoin found its price? It only seems we crash when someone decides to do a high volume dump such as 7K --> 6K and 6K --> 5.8K.
Sounds reasonable.

lol I don't know why you post there when all they do is harass you. 
What I would do just to be able to spend an hour talking to Ed Seykota. The man is truly a mind. My favorite interview from Market Wizards.
Only a ~ 50 BTC long closed during the initial dump. However since then, margin longs increased again by ~ 800 BTC compared to before the dump while shorts decreased. Imo bearish sign but i guess we will find out soon.
Thanks for the “Cartel Link”... quite the interesting read. Still near 250 Billion Market Cap & they are literally “Rat Poisoning” the public & the cryptosphere. I’ve never seen the sentiment so negative, unbelivable & great post, Thanks!
That could of been short bots seeing Tether print and closing?
The price wont spike 30-50% out of nowhere. That type of upward volatility would likely come after a swift move down or a period of consolidation within a range...maybe we could slowly grinding up for a few weeks and then get a move like that.
brb forgot to set my new catastrophic stop
the good news is that the break out will be swift. we have about ~$400 worth of resistance, and then the order books are pretty thin. So when someone wants to pump it, they'll be able to paint a pretty massive BGD and shorts closing will do the rest

the bad news, is that a few thousand coins spread through a few hundred dollars worth of resistance has been pushing this thing down since $8500. 
Nothing but whales that alternate between bear masks and bull masks
I think we can have another push. It usually tests resistance 2-3 times before barting down.
People were saying "fucking I am not selling" at 12k too. The real depression is when even really true hodlers start to sell.
GBTC usually trades at a hefty premium over the BTC price.  This is because they provide ease of investing, where people can use IRA accounts to trade, without the need for understanding bitcoin wallets etc.
They know btc pump soon
Eyes balls deep in the charts watching this, essentially in same position as you. 

Ideally I would like to short where the 2 blue lines intersect around $6450

Sleep is for weak ;-)
same boat. i'm in a large position myself and don't trust a minute of sleeping on this. hoping for a swift move downward in the next hour or so.
One day in the future does not prevent you from making a short term bet against price. Why should it? And many traders go long/short according to their forecast, there is no such thing as bear (at all times).
You don't need to day trade simply open a small short position as a hedge to protect yourself(gain more bitcoin) during the bear market. Or dont. It's your investment.

Yup. Did the same.

Or slow pump then fast pump. It happens. A lot. But you're right: it is boring to sit around watching the charts all day every day. Just take your position and walk away. I'm long from 6300 currently. What's your position?
Historically, sure, but I would expect we find some support off ATH downtrend resistance (potentially as support; blue) and/or the longer term uptrend line/zone (pink): https://www.tradingview.com/x/NjCCNRRI/
kinda bearish post? Auto downvoted (not by me). That's ridic as he's only making a statement based on TA. If you check my history, I'm always cheering longs, but holy shit don't just downvote what you don't want to hear. At least offer some counter reasons to add to the discussion. I for one didn't come here only for mindless bulls vs bears rallies.
While I agree with what you are pointing out, "only 500" is almost 10% so we are not that close.
Crap
they were actually dumping into an invisible buy wall at $6,245, haven't seen any selling into the visible wall at 6200 yet

edit: a word
Why did you just absolutely murder the $5750 BGD wick??

You have your line drawn ( Red ) why not just draw it blue? 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/3LOZCHX0/
If I may ask, where are you looking to close that short? 
Been watching this, waiting on it to dip below 0.5, along with BTC to have a higher total market dominance.  
I think you could probably get away with waiting for an oversold RSI on the weekly to buy.   Disclaimer: am currently short

Time to look the other way mate
Yep... You keep shorting.

Its a Casino.
Lol, I'm sure there's a bot downvoting posts with bearish/rational sentiment. I guess people just don't want to hear stuff like "be careful", "watch your cholesterol", "do your homework" and shit
They are losing about 15$ a minute.  See how long until the well goes dry. 
Someone’s bot is malfunctioning again 
yea.. thats crazy. someone is going to wake up with an empty account

That's probably an arbitrage bot from GDAX.

Bitfinex also have these kinds of bots to maintain the price at a level similar to other exchanges.
there are no bears "on the ropes". this has tanked nonstop for like 5 weeks man. 
>  The bulls are starting to believe

They start to believe every time there is a 5% rise.  Then it drops 15% and they start to doubt.  Then it rises 5% again and they believe.  

Rinse and repeat.
Tether?

just go and trade on deribit if you want to trade options. Bitmex options are overpriced.
After every crash, the floor is higher than the previous floor, of course this could change but so far it hasn't. If there is one thing to remember about the dynamics of the market, and forget all the rest, that would be the one. Many reasons for that, finite supply, halvening, wallets getting lost, etc. As long as this doesn't change, long term holders will not lose faith.
> long term holder... 200%

If your a long term holder your up at LEAST 500 to 600% but more probably in the multiple 1000's of %


As a long term hodler (since 2013, my ROI today is 3443%, or 116% per year), I haven't lost faith in crypto but I have lost it in Bitcoin Segwit/Core/OrHoweverYouWannaCallIt. I don't expect LN's routing problem to be solved any time soon, so the basic p2p-cash market is up for grabs for Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin.
I'm long term hold, I haven't lost faith :) helps that I cashed out my principle at the top we can go all the way down to $800 
The run from 5800 to 20000 didn't take seven months. It took about four months. It will probably take less than that this time since everything is easier the second time around.

You're right though, we're not going to Goblin Town, and it's going to be funny to watch these guys melt down, assuming most of them don't just disappear from this sub somewhere north of $10K.
Lol- the bull run went from approx 1.1k to 20k and you think 20k to 5.8k is the "equivalent"? In log terms they are not even close to the same thing...

From my perspective, we're still in slow bleed territory- tons of buy orders in the upper 5ks but nobody seriously showing they want to buy BTC for more than 6.5k, much less 7k.

Will take a lot more time for this to play out.
You can replace bears with bulls and the same would apply.
Actually the bull run was from 1000 to 20,000, so the equivalent will be 20,000 to 1000.

Price just hit a new 6 month low in the last couple of days.  Sadly, there is no indication that likely will not drop even lower on the next leg down.
Yes? Which ones?
No
Novogratz is buying jets from ETH gains, you shouldn't follow his advice, as he leads the herd to slaughter.
Uh none of that makes sense
For “flood gates to open” you need a mechanism to catalyze that, which is not present.

Most alts are down about that much or are you comparing BTC to pets.com?

$6000 is not the bottom, because the price already dropped significantly below $6000. 
I for sure don't know, but I'll say this.  Some of the largest players, the whales with huge wallets, including miners and even small countries, could easily muster an effort to keep the value up for a very long time.  Especially considering leverage etc.

If the largest miners got together they could figure out where they need to keep the price low enough to keep mining at a reasonable profit but also prohibitive for new players to enter.  Then keep us there for a nice long time, accumulate as much as possible, then when they feel like it they can use their significant share to push the value right back up.

I will admit most if this is by gut, but in time I would like to look into the numbers a bit to be more specific, but my bet is that what we consider a whale in regards to the market is a small fry compared to the holdings for many of the largest wallets.
which were the five that was down less than 5%?
thanks for the link
The fact that you have a voice right now makes me confident we are near bottom.
People gang-down-voting common sense, proven history, and basic mathematical concepts. Doesn't sound like the end of the post-bull-run drop is anywhere close.
If you don't trust it, don't hold it. It's pretty much that simple. If it's discovered to be a scam, a bunch of people will lose money they have in tether, BTC price will have a flash crash, many people will say "I told you so", and it will be old news in a month. It has absolutely no effect on long term BTC adoption, development, or price. 
I really am not too worried about USDT, but does anyone know the answer to this (or have a thought) of what I cannot figure out?

So I buy $1m tether (true story) and I buy a bunch of BTC. Now, eventually I sell my BTC and the $1m tether sits on the market (it is a top ten coin now). Then I convert my $1.2m in profits back to fiat (average trade for me).

Once I withdraw those funds to fiat, then it is technically no longer back 1:1 by USD, unless there is another buyer or they 'burn' them, which we don't think is happening. 

New printing would occur then when new fiat hits the market for USDT that they do not have ready for transfer. So Tether has a stack of non-circulating reserve Tether and a stack of (extra, non-backing) fiat. They'll only print new Tether when their reserve runs low.

However, this makes the total market cap hard to comprehend, I will say that. I mean in theory, ALL of it could be cashed out and it would be in the top ten total market cap with hundreds of billions in 'valuation'.

Seems like burning them would make so much more sense? Or am I missing something obvious?
I thought your post was pretty good. Not sure why the downvote bots are out to get you/us.
> fuck you, that's why

The crypto way.  I mean, Bitcoin was born out of a fuck you to the sub-prime crash, right?
"The cash is all there 1:1."

I think it's probably there, but without a legit audit, I'll stick to crypto that trust-less.
Many people who are long BTC have their head in the sand with anything and everything negative.  There can be a major exchange hack and they will say "This is Good for Bitcoin".   They are perpetually desperate and scared and live their lives in denial.
It could also find horizontal support at 6k and turn into an iH&S on the 4H pretty quickly

The volume profile is inconsistent with a wedge.
Everyone's too distracted by the pump ;)
I wouldn’t stress just yet. We may be heading back down by the looks of it.
let me know when you're going to buy back in so I can sell please
What if people opening longs are actually prople who are gradually closing their shorts from Jan-March

You need to be creative in this market. 
Hello im new and studyign technical analysis and everything. What does “we really need to break these longs before we can rally again?” Thanks in advacne
6-12 months. need a proper mentality reset of the market. Remember the way up? People here were shitting themselves everytime we did a 40% dump, thinking its over. Now we're down 70% or whatever and people are still dreaming about 100k++..
Plenty of posts here going over that, but no one knows.

I’m no expert but I can’t see a proper recovery any time soon. Either we go up a bit, sideways for a long time, or down a lot. Let’s hope for sideways, as it seems to offer the best hope for the longer term.
I believe it will last until the next halving or if there's a new application that will actually create demand for Bitcoin apart from price speculation.
Two Weeks^^TM.
Tether creation is at least *supposed* to mean new fiat entering the ecosystem. You don't need tether to sell BTC. 
I read this in Jack Black’s voice
>untethered

heh, way to sneak that in there
It just seems too easy. If we dump/move down from here it's just like...what. It'd be quite literally the same exact pattern over and over for weeks now

Ok... So short then!!!

So we're back to hidden walls... That's interesting.
forgive me my noobness, what is a way to detect a hidden wall ?
At this point everyones prediction is 5400$.

Imagine all the money waiting on the side. But no sellers to go there.

Now imagine whales accumulating just above that level and create FOMO when everyone wakes up in about 2 months with a 50% markup
There may not be a V bottom.

Nope. Longs arnt even really closing. Longs currently outnumber Shorts by around 20% If we break below 6k again could see a real nice Long squeeze.
Or a failed dump? :-p
I decided to roll the dice. 

!short XBTU18 add 6220 50% 

Hovering over market close if it flips red. 
don't trade on the tether pump nonsense, it's a bunch of noise. although I don't think that's a bad entry or anything 
There may be another BGD taking us to about $6500, but that is where we hit that descending wedge from ATH and I doubt we will now break the trend. That $6.5 short entry would be ideal.
looks that way to me too.
Don't underestimate the power of the Tether Pump.  If it stalls out, they can just create more imaginary money and pump it higher.  How do you think we got to $20K last year?
If you don't accept the premise that someone could be accumulating as a possibility then you can disregard the next thought. If you think it it is possible however, then this is the scenario they would want. Too much open short interest is bad for someone who is accumulating because when the shorts cover, they have to buy which "crowds the trade", and means less available supply for the accumulator to buy.
I'm not bullish, because I'd rather mentally brace for disappointment.

That said... I would be very nervous about opening a short. 
Honestly my sentiment is that this is another bounce that's setting me up for disappointment. A sucker's rally, if you will. 
I'm bullish on a moderate swing to 6.7, and then maybe 7.8 if we make a higher low on a retrace from 6.7. We're extremely far from the 1D 200ma and it doesn't look too right imo.

good sign, that we soon dump to test support.
Well. Adding again when it will pass the 6200. 
[removed]
Well that was short lived.
Guess where the market is headed then? haha
If the past is to be believed, price will pump over the next two days to two weeks, followed by a drop below the current price. 


My thinking is that the printed tethers are used by bitfinex et. al to buy up cryptos with USDT trading pairs, which are then sold back to retail buyers, causing the price to dip below the price at the time the tethers were issued. The tether launderers don't care though, because tether doesn't cost anything to print. 

Honestly I don't see any reason why tether couldn't actually be backed 1:1 with real dollars, considering that printing tethers and buying BTC and ETH with them is straight profit. If they've been saving even 1% of the BTC/ETH/other alts they buy from each printing since 2014, they would have made rediculous amounts of real money in January and February alone.
>We are coming down from an unrivaled bull run.

Percentage wise this is similar to other runs

>The lack of follow-through of the hype is making investors wary. The endless possibilities people were fantasizing about don't appear to be happening.

No one who even did the smallest amount of research into cryptocurrency thought there are any projects near adoption or widescale consumer use. You make it sound like projects switched gears and didn't meet goals/timetables and deceived consumers. There are quite a few great projects out there, moving slowly but steadily toward their goals. 

> Investors are rapidly losing faith in the market and are discovering crypto has been substantially overvalued.

That sentence could verbatim be used to talk about the last bull/bear cycle.

>I don't think it will grow again before there's some real adoption.

Growth will occur upon substantial further development in the space in anticipation of that adoption. There's a reason for these boom and bust cycles, speculators aren't going to wait for the "real" demand to kick in. That's not how markets generally work.

>We need real use cases, not potential ones.

I agree, but nothing has changed on this front. There's been no deception. Give the space a few more years. 
The mcap is half facebooks value with 1000x its significance. Sovereignless remittance alone is a multi trillion usd sector. 

I think you are way off with your endless bear chat. 
> weary

Wary means nervous. Weary means tired. 
> ~~Investors~~ Speculators are rapidly losing faith in the market and are discovering crypto has been substantially overvalued.

FTFY.

Actual investors aren't losing faith in anything. Read up on any serious 'shitcoin', there is a steadily increasing amount of money, developer interest, and corporate (and sometimes even government) collaboration in this space.
Nice try, that is nonsense.  Mt. Gox total collapse is so much more significant and damaging than what we are experiencing now, which is just a natural correction from the bull run you mention.  We actually have major institutional interest in crypto now.  Back then, it was just some silly internet money that could have easily failed and oops oh yeah the exchange everyone was trading on just went bankrupt/got hacked.  Investing after that took some real brass balls. 

Investing now actually can be construed as a wise decision since NYSE, NASDAQ, Coinbase Custody services are getting involved.  Back then, it was just faith and hope and a whitepaper.
Thanks for projecting your worldview onto the rest of us. This is your world and yours only.
>We are coming down from an unrivaled bull run.

I can understand how a newcomer could come to that conclusion, but really it's not. In 2017 price was breaking 1k in January and 10k somewhere in November, so 10x in ~10 months. In 2013 price did 10x, from 100 to 1k, in 3 months.
The market has been manipulated down at great cost. There's nothing organic about this little dip, nor is it a big deal. The gargantuan bull pennant (drawn from seven months ago) is in full effect.
shorts don't pay longs any funding/money; you lose/win btc w.r.t. to price you close position, or w.r.t. price during settlment date;

future prices can be below or above spot price

EOSM18 now is 'cheaper' than price on poloniex [-0.82%], so technically you could long bitmex, short it on finex/poloniex, wait 4 days, close position on finex/poloniex, cash difference. Minus fees it's probably not worth the effort, also note that market buying alts on bitmex is really expensive 0.25%; also alts have bad liquidity, so if for whatever reason you need to close your positon fast, you are screwed.

premiums fluctuates + and - very heavily, I don't think expressing it in yearly terms is meaningful... new contracts are opened every 3 months anyway

so, in short, you should not worry too much about Fair Basis rate, just compare future price to mark price (and take into account that both will converge during the end of the contract, so additonal win/loss = dissepearing premium).
The rate usually changes every 8 hours, but if you want to annualize it, just take it and multiply by 3 x 365.
>Number is up to date, just not graph. I'll update before next week.


Why, is the crossover happening several times on different directions?

Dude, are you looking at the 1D chart?
What happened then? 
A lot of those people have gotten pretty good at holding so maybe they will keep doing that ; D

No doubt some short-term selling pressure though 
There wasn't any halting.  There weren't plans to sell any more of them that were halted.
Well, the fact that many traders watch those BTC addresses for movement has bearing if there won't be any more coins sold.

That being said, it's fair to say that the transfer of coins to beneficiaries once this law suit is over could have the same effect since the recipients are likely to sell their winnings.
Be sure you understand: that Mex is a futures exchange, not a traditional exchange; how the futures products work; how leverage and liquidation works; and that the margin (collateral) that you use to enter positions is in btc (not dollars, which means that when long positions go against you, not only do you lose on the trade amount but the value of your margin also goes down) .
I lost about $8K by taking too long to switch to Bitmex from Bitfinex.  

There is a steep learning curve on BitMEX if you are about as smart/dumb as I am or dumber.  

My main tip is don't cut it too tight with liquidation price.

The sentiment is bearish despite today's BGD.
Over the last 24 hours the shorts have been falling, possibly contributing to the mini-BGD.  Now the shorts are still falling and longs are increasing.  The weird thing is the price isn't really reacting, which is surprising to me (which isn't saying much), I would figure all that buying pressure would push it up.
It's in everyone's interest for Tether to maintain USDUSDT parity and liquidity on any exchange they can access. *Regardless of whether it's a scam or not.*

The entire "money" idea is just made up. Crypto is just an extension of that. 

Pieces of paper have no integral value. 

As to the second half of your rambling, it makes little to no sense. 


So you are quoting There Will Be Blood? How bored are you?
We're still up like 600% in the past 12 months... A year ago I would have been absolutely ecstatic with $6000. 

This is no worse than 2013 when it went from $1100 down to $250
Bitcoin’s up over 10 -15 times it’s price from the bull run and you’re saying we failed?  

How do you not see how ridiculous that sounds?
I  actually like Reading your Posts, they are intriguing
You realize 18 months ago from today we were at around $900, and the most optimistic outlook for 2017 was around $2500? You really gonna pretend you can see 18 months into the future? 
A full beartard posts like this make me think we actually did find the bottom. We didn’t had those until lately. It was the same when we topped
[removed]
I've been considering property since I actually started making money for sure. 😁 Thanks for the little tip, I intend to
Couldn't agree more man. Changed who I am. Understanding variance is a journey on it's own. And the mental fortitude that comes with that shit. I know we're a rare breed with that alone. 
It was a bit childish and I find it funny now, but, as a hodler, I used to get mad at you a couple years ago every time you posted you were shorting, as if you were personally moving the market against me. Then I tried shorting myself at the wrong time and got rekt. That taught me some respect for shorters and bears. XD
...now I am actually grateful to you for all the good and honest posting of the years past. That taught me a great deal.
Ibank! I was stoked when I saw you still posted here every now and then. I used to follow you all the time. You were seriously like the only person doing good at that time haha. You seriously helped teach me. Even if I didn't message you directly. I owe you for part of this. Seeing a successful trader... Man it helps motivate. Also I re read your story and realized ive read it before too. Cheers mate. 😂😂😁
Oh mostly to do with just personal life. Poker taught me to realize money as money. Not poker chips. Bitcoin was kind of just something I used to make money not btc. However I don't really have to follow any rules. I'll probably enter back in eventually with a percentage just for holdings on some ledgers. Maybe 10-15% of what I made. I like ripple. Eth. Stellar. And iota. I kept holdings in those and Bitcoin.  There's gonna be another rally. The halvening is 1 year 10 months away. I'll need some coins when we moon ;)
Lol well I probably hid how bad I was. Idk, something about mostly posting the winners and not the losers. Naaa.. I didn't really pretend to be good. I was like 18-19. I just contributed a funny comment. I said " this is gentlemen" when a technical indicator went my way and alot of people had their eye on it too. It started like the only rally we ever saw back then. Bitcoin went from 300 to 450 in like a Friday night. Everyone mememed it up and was stoked they made money and kind of attributed it to my stupid quote 
Very very true. And the people are happier. Took a trip to Vegas and I could not take the poker players in those poker rooms. Didn't wanna end up like them so I quit
not super familar with fixed fractional but i'm probably gonna do a seperate write up of the actual way i ended up trading using risk management. i think its useful and ive been preaching it around the trading discord servers where i have a pretty solid repuation and people have been thanking me for it. 
Yeah man. Just /r/poker. They taught me almost everything I know. Also twitch. 
I heard doge is the next big pupper.
No a transfer to finex of 100M that they have already printed.
250m just printed today! Bull market confirmed
They probably just over print once they hit a low enough amount left. They dont print it for every deposit.
I’ve been wondering that too. Wouldn’t they need to continually create new Tether and burn old Tether in order to make sure the price stays at $1.00? 
"BEARS many similarities" ha ha I see what u did there.
[deleted]
There are no solid bear arguments?

Dude are you actually delusional? I mean we know you're wrong about pretty much wrong about every trade ie continually longing before the price drops further, saying we're about to fly through $10k with no resistance, and we drop $2.5k 

But that statement is actually beyond delusional

Funny how you come out of the woodwork for every little pump though, waving the flag as if you predicted it
Dropping to 4k isn't out of the question and is supported by TA and many knowledgeable traders. Looking at the all time log chart it's not very far down from where we are ATM.
Believe me, If we could we would have shorted it to oblivion. Useless shitcoin lol
It's a fake out. The IRR whales are just tanking the market and looking to force a short squeeze in time for Chinese new year and get those wall street bonuses!
I regret not reading more about how to FX and how to short TRY. Would have loved to had an open position from since the coup. 

Weirdly enough, I feel like now, with one-man rule, a lot of ME money and business will flow there.
We don't use local bitcoin much. 
No direct access to USDT or TrueUSD, some convert BTC to them in exchanges but I personally don't trust bitfinex or other stable coins. BTC is much more trustworthy imo and with the falling economy these ups and down in BTC prices are jokes. My car just doubled in price from 6 months ago. Imagine that.
Thanks!
Very bad moment? IRR depreciated for 50% within one month and sanctions are on the way. I'm actually in profit despite the downtrend. and they could lose all their money when the government or economy collapses. Already real estate and gold prices are soaring through the roof. We take our chances with bitcoin, thank you.
Here are things that happened recently: Tether prints more coins. Mt. Gox is going through rehab. Japan regulates exchanges. SEC makes announcements. The market fluctuates naturally. What you have is a bad case of Post hoc ergo propter hoc.

I mean... you short after a fall of 4000$ without any retrace.

Consider learning risk management maybe, or stick to "sell high" that will do.
When you realize that smartphones have only existed for 10 years, the same amount of time as bitcoin, it kinda makes you wonder what the heck bitcoin has been doing
There are app developers all over the planet. That piece is definitely 24/4. 
I looked it up to check but couldn't find much. think that's just a rumor- I saw someone say that futures *require* a $100b market cap to be listed, after that it can go under.

Not sure tho
I do know that many of the major trust funds require a minimum of $100B market cap in order for an asset to be eligable as an investment.

So if we go below 100B market cap, we might lose some of the major trust funds.
MikeXBT is the Chuck Norris of bitcoin trading. He actually market sold 1000 coins to get to that price, just so he could add fiat to his position.

You got this wrong. Noobs caused the bull market and gave enough money to the older players to cash out and gtfo from this market, and are now waiting for new noobs to give them the money to do the same. 
nope
Okay whew! Was like wtf for a moment there...
Definitely something I need to work on. I’ve been doing amazing on the trades that do play out which could just be luck, but I feel like the ones I lose on shouldn’t have been as rushed. I just feel like I have to babysit the market more when I’m out of a position than when I am.. is that weird?
It's funny you mention that, because I have been feeling like I was very impatient on these trades, slowly adding to losing trades until they reverse, then selling once they turn green. If I had ridden my $10k short down to here, I could have closed for massive gains, but instead I turned it into multiple shorts on the way down.

I'm running into the same issue here, as I wouldn't be surprised to see this pump higher from here either, but I guess I'm just happy as long as my BTC stack keeps increasing.
I think he's using it as a gauge of interest, but I'm not sure. Using volume alone to correlate with up or down is kind of odd unless he's just trying to measure interest. 
I see it as a good way to gain exposer to thoughts not biased towards crypto and improve my trading

I used to argue with them 3 years ago, what's amazing is that some of the people I used to argue with are still posting in there... Kinda sad really. Also pretty funny as they kept calling me an idiot for going long @ 300ish USD/BTC.
For me he feels a bit boring from what I remember, I like the more big trade guys like Stanley Druckenmiller or Bill Lippschutz
Or just in general the market do meta-speculation , like me. Just bought futures at 6240
Bad wording... I had in mind that we will slowly move up and a lot of people will be shorting those moves expecting continuation of bear trend until we'll reach at least 10k.
> The price wont spike 30-50% out of nowhere. 

Bitcoin: hold my beer.
I didn't mean 50% candle :-P
Neh, order books being thin up there is actually a bad sign. If it really is a sign of anything at all, having 'only' $400 up of sells filled out likely means sellers simply don't expect the price to go that high -- and they will surely show up if we somehow do make it higher.

A 'bullish' looking orderbook should be a lot more balanced, with a good number of sells gradually added all the way up to like 10-20%+
this is the reality
The depression now is real. We've been dumping and bear flagging for nearly 7 weeks straight. The last time and only  other time Bitcoin did this, was the final capitulation before the all time low of the 2014 bear market. I don't think you realize just how bad it has been the past 2 months in the context of bitcoin's entire history. If this week closes red too, it will be officially the longest, and most consistent and relentless capitulation in Bitcoin's history without any significant consolidation or breather. When is it going to get to you people that this has been a capitulation. Maybe not the final capitulation. Maybe bitcoin is going to 2000 dollars. I don't know, but this is real depression, its real anger and its a real capitulation. The market sentiment will not be at its lowest, when the price meets its lowest point in the bear market. That is not how it works. That's not how it worked in 2014, that's not how it was in the dot com bubble or the Nikkei crash. I'm speaking as a long term hodler, It is taking everything within me not to get rid of my long term holdings at this point. It's been absolutely brutal, like historically brutal. Maybe if we get a real good bounce to 7000 range I will legitimately leave this market and wait. 

I am sick of these posts. 

"wait till we get maximum pain at 2k"

"wait for the real depression"

"wait for the real capitulation"

Like you know better.
When the real one happens, you won't even know it. You'll still be saying this shit and it'll only confirm in hindsight. This is bearish exuberance and arrogance.
Agreed. I didn't mean to make any reference to whether or not we've bottomed out - I'm just shocked by the daily discussion now. 

I'm totally over-invested but I can't imagine being in that phase unless we're lower than this price a year from now. I suppose the main demographic of a cryptocurrency investor is short-term thinking though (i.e. got in cause mad gains in low timeframe)
wouldn't it have just been easier to say eyeballs deep?
On higher timeframes it doesn't look like an unresolved wedge at all.

I highly doubt you'll get that. I'll be surprised if this breaks 6300. I'll look to re-enter around 6250. I just saw an opportunity to close my short in profit into a sell wall at 6080 (on Sept) so I took it.

thank you!
Looks like a properly good suggestion. Just went through the contents and it seems to cover **everything**. Many thanks!
what's your take on the next few hours Sloppy? if you don't mind
Does that mean making liquidity for buyers to bring the price up a bit? I’m somewhat a newb. And if that IS what it means, I’m wondering bigger picture... why would that happen?
5700 is probably going to be the temporary bottom, likely going to be a bit of a rally. I planned to trade this as an inverse H&S forming so expected a second pump back to 6250. We would get almost the same pattern on different timeframes which is neat. We never go straight from dumping to pumping, I didn't expect another pump after 6250 yesterday because the April big candle had a lot of previous consolidation before that. So a fakeout to the downside now is even more confusion, people start shorting again, longs get afraid etc. It's a good setup. 
Already did that before it started dumping because you can never be sure.
Because scaling means scaling. You sacrifice a little bit of entry position in exchange for making sure you get an entry at all.
I hate waiting for “ The Perfect Entry “. So scaling in 25% of it per entry from here to the top of the wedge is the ideal play.

I’ll bail over blue line 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/oZn6CyEb/
What falling wedge? Do you have a chart?
You could have said that about almost every little rally from the entire drop to 10k.

The 3x $8600 Bounce

The bounce of $8200

Bounce off $7200

Bounce off $7050

Bounce off our first stop at $6100

And now... bounce off $5700?

If tether didn’t print we wouldn’t be at $6300 right now. Not falling for this BS again. We are still in a heavy bear market 
I shorted all the way down from $9k, only opening 2 Longs on the way. 

I’ve made over 200% of my BTC stack strictly from shorting since then.

Your point? 
It's easy to brag once the action is done. I would have liked to hear your sentiment when price was 6250 millimeters away. Not so relaxed I guess.
there are 60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours in a day = $21,600 a day

pretty much peanuts for a market maker 
I never doubt. Never. 

Bears are scared, and they should be. Somebody wasted a billion bucks trying to dump the price down and was not successful. Now let's just hope they borrowed those coins because it will cost them a lot more than a billion to buy back.

Thanks, I did not know about them. Cheers!
Yep
And others - nano, etc. Not sure why LTC would be a contender... don’t think they’re too innovative.
Would that mean that Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin will likely phase out and cease to trail Bitcoin should Bitcoin climb?
It's impossible for it to ever be the same thing as it can't go down more than 100%.
During bull run BitCoin gain much more users, brand recognition, better services, businesses that create infrastructure earned millions which they will reinvest... legislation is more clear... more on/off ramps etc.

No way this baby will go much lower than this.
Reality is months/years to play out.  Most here want a bull run tomorrow.
It is not a ridiculous idea to think that BTC fair price went up 5x from January 2017 to today. The industry have been growing in some huge proportions.
It's almost like those are the driving factors of a market... weird how that works.
That’s right and y’all sound like retarded moon bois calling another 50% down after 70-80% down
BTC in 2012. One could read the chart like a book. Nice slope upwards and you could see a Wall Street guy put a million in, letting it double, and take it out again. 
The site comes up for me but I just keep getting "reconnecting to Bitmex..."
we should've all listened to charlie lee :) people hate him but that dude is so nice for telling us all the future
~~It just has to~~ All that is required is for the price to start going up. Eventually, us investors will outpower the short term speculators. And I also believe that once things start moving, there will be a lot of money sitting on the sidelines just waiting to jump in. It will be a FOMO of epic proportions.

The most complacency I see is people assuming we are in 2014 again.
[removed]
I'm deaf and I'm hearing it.
Next thing you know those bears have god mode. Or worse; a (buy) wallhack.
Nah, I'm not comparing anything to pets.com (although Doge might fit here ;-)). I just saw some people calling the bottom at 6K, probably comparing it with the of 2013-2014 price (which went down ~70%).
Sorry for having my voice. ;-) I hope you're right! Long-term it will probably be ok.
OP is concerned whales and exchanges using tether will end up holding bags of imaginary money. He is doing his due diligence of warning them to do their own research.
I think they are burned in batches IIRC. Because crypto has done nothing but grow up until this year exchanges (most the major exchanges use tether) probably stuggled to keep up with the printing so they get marked for burned and then reallocated when money comes into the system instead of issuing more . Pretty sure that was how I've heard it explained a few times. I think the biggest issue with tether is if the US or another country decide to go after them as opposed to solvency (because you now have polo, now backed by circle, kraken etc would have all done their due diligence as it would put their whole business in the shit if it wasn't legit. I think the process is all explained in the whitepaper IIRC.
only $30 million tethers have ever been burned.  Can you believe that?  
Do you ever tire of this quest of yours?  Why not just set up a nice short and walk away?  For someone so confident, you sure feel the need to convince everybody that you're right.

On top of the 31k Longs...

Oh man 
make them close so we get more buying power in a rally
When we were at $230 some people were also dreaming of $10,000. Nothing wrong with having a dream. ;)
When the bull comes back, and it will, it's going to  put the last bull to shame.
Do you mean 6-12 months MORE, or just 6-12 months total?
If institution money is about to hit the scene than it could be much sooner. They don’t have to forget anything and they are not emotional. They will probably simply insider buy on some positive news and start a new rally.
Bitcoin succeeds via price speculation. It's an ouroboros. The higher the prices the more use it gets (see transaction rates vs price - highly correlated).
LOL that is perfect 
Bulls finally beginning to understand the concept “bear market”
usually is like this when we trend, very easy to trade, the hard part is to not get overconfident/rekt when it turns around
Why change a winning system?
Be sure you have $ to cover. /bucky :P
yep it's def there, getting sold into again right now
check this out brotha, https://trading.gear54.me/tradeflow/

one way to see the large transactions and filter through some of the noise. if you notice a bunch of decent size buys/sells around the same time at the same price and there isn't a visible buy/sell wall in the order book, then you can assume there is a hidden wall.
when you see .1 BTC absorb hundreds of sells
Orderbook doesn't have an open position, but the order history shows a high amount of transactions (more than the open order book) without price movement.
This is how one part ways with dear coins. Selling at  RSI < 30 convinced of more bear and fomo buying when RSI > 80, recipe for financial disaster..
You realize nothing we say, feel or do is going to move the market, right?

Unless you're moving around 1,000+ btc. but I'm going to guess most of us aren't
In order for us to transition from bear to bull there needs to be a reversal. How do you expect it to be bull if this price action keeps up?

Funny how we never seem to mind how high the longs get :-p
the dump didn't fail. It painted a lower low on the daily chart. 

It always comes back to fill the gap..
I going to go ahead and assume that camel-ish look of the chart played a small role in this decision.

Where u putting ur stops 
When was the last time we saw big hidden buy wall?
Tether pump is noise on a 1month chart, but not on the 1d , imo.
Just one of the many things contributing to my entry.

Ripping up the golf course right now so don’t have time to post Chart/ reasons.

why don't you build you own exchange and print your  imaginary USDPH money. You won't even need a printer, just MS access/excel, and a keyboard.
>How do you think we got to $20K last year?

Low volume and noobs tapping their 401's?
Glad to see this place is still such a bastion of quality posting.

What does /u/olesentv have to say I wonder?

sounds like another currency i know $
People are accumulating but there is way more selling pressure. Every rally being sold by people looking to exit. Most shorts in profit, most longs super rekt.  No higher highs on daily in 6 months. Long term moving averages curling down. We're going to 5k minimum and most likely 3.5-4k.  
For what it's worth, the 250m in Tether will have a positive impact of 10&#37; on the current market cap putting \~6750 within easy reach. Look to short from there if bearish, or ride the speculative wave higher.
Thanks for your contribution

up, down, flat all around 
These bigger buywalls are like spoilers. Until they are not :-D.
that might be what "they" want you to think...there's a hidden buy wall at $6,245 that's absorbed over 400 BTC. if the owners of the walls are the same person, wouldn't be a stretch to think they put the visible one there to attract sell pressure which gets absorbed right into their invisible wall. we shall see...
> Honestly I don't see any reason why tether couldn't actually be backed 1:1 with real dollars

It is.

Enthusiasm over alts is the thing that's drying up. We're in a bear market because alt speculators don't know where to put their money long-term. It's slowly dawning on the market that bitcoin is first to market and best in class. When that's eventually solidified for an extended period we'll see the alt market go through a final phase of consolidation.

https://www.moonmath.win/alt.html
I think the difference being that everyone’s grandma knows what Facebook is and what it does. That may happen with BTC eventually. 
Why would 99.999% of legitimate persons and businesses care about "sovereignless remittance", whatever that is?
Thanks.
You are 100% correct.  ALL the _investors_ are going ape shit getting into crypto in every form and there are a huge number of stats to support that.  But that also means they arent putting money into bitcoin b/c it has nothing to do with crypto's current phase of development.
There is interest, but you can’t conflate that with the short term value. The trend last year was spiked by a certain subset of the population, and of those involved it appears many have left, and the general public sentiment seems to reflect a largely negative view of crypto. 

You need new dollars to reproduce what we had before, and when you look at the all time trend like we could go to the 2000s and still be in an all time uptrend if it increased from there. 

So while those facts could be considered either bullish, or desperate, depending on your perspective they aren’t happening right now and as such we aren’t getting flooded with new money...so it isn’t a foregone conclusion that this is the bottom or not since the underlying factors that gave us this continued downtrend haven’t substantially changed based on actual real world happenings.
Yeah, that's kinda my point...

Evidence of where you're getting these claims?
I guess the fortunate part is that it wouldn't be all at once, or in such large quantities, so the market will be able to absorb the volume over time.
> [...] the recipients are likely to sell their winnings.

I see a lot of people saying this, but I doubt it. For a huge majority of the people who had BTC in '13, converting back to fiat would be a step backwards, regardless of the price.

> US been losing the “Trade War” for a long time.

Uh yes, the world is so abusive with the US...
LOL...Dont really understand economics huh?  US has gotten a disproportionate amount of benefit from the trade agreements since they have been a global power (post wwII).   The US people have not gotten the good end of that stick, but if you think what Trump is doing is going to change that for the better, I got some property to sell you in FL.
One could argue it started before the Chinese globalization movement as you call it. I.e. the US globalization movement. But surely it didn't start with Trump but he and his backers tend to throw oil on the fire to get a piece of the pie.
Maybe
Yeah, so it does not look bearish as 3 days ago
Sounds plausible, and contrarian to this sub I would say

>Zero correlation

That seems a bit unlikely.  I would say zero correlation to things like which team wins the world cup (although, hell, there could still be something there, looking at you Venezuela).
The NY Times disagrees:

Bruh, none of these "jokes" are funny. Maybe don't try so hard. 
We're still very much in a bear market, BGD or not. 
It's because they hardly influence the price if they close and open slowly...
Not in everyone's interest.  Not in the interest of anyone who is shorting the market.
So what are you saying, they monitor the kraken USD/USDT market and print tethers when it's not close to 1:1? Lol

Tether, claims to, allow customers to trade their USDT in for USD at 1:1 ratio. If, this is indeed legit, the kraken market is none of their responsibility and the free market would ensure near 1:1 at all times. I remember during the tether fud months ago when tether was down like 4% to USD, and also a few instances where it pumped quite a bit above. There was no tether printing or burning of tethers going on to coincide with these price divergences.


They no longer claim that you can do this.  They just say is it "backed by USD", even though you can't redeem for USD...seems pointless, but that's just me.
[deleted]
you payed: 3.394 sat/B fees. this is not much. you have to wait that miners put your transaction in a block. miners want to maximize profit so they will put first the trasnactions that pay more fee and occupy less space (sat/Byte ratio).

Why does that not fill me with a sense of happiness.
this is my understanding 
I was actually thinking about this over the weekend, I am not sure I fully get it.

So I buy $1m tether (true story) and I buy a bunch of BTC. Now, eventually I sell my BTC and the $1m tether sits on the market (it is a top ten coin now). Then I convert my $1.2m in profits back to fiat (average trade for me).

Once I withdraw those funds to fiat, then it is technically no longer back 1:1 by USD, unless there is another buyer or they 'burn' them. New printing would occur then when new fiat hits the market for USDT that they do not have ready for transfer.

This is very confusing, I wish I knew how this worked better. 
All the tether in the world couldnt've accounted for the rise in 2017. Also all the new customers and subscribers - can't tether them.
The 2017 rise was in line with the millions of people registering on exchanges. 
How do you buy? Localbitcoin?
Why not just hedge it on futures or something? There you go, perfect stable coin. Well. I guess you run the risk of a premium or discount. but that's like...1-3% variance instead of...ya know...30-40% variance over a few weeks
I shored $6700 and closed for over a 9% profit :)
Without a retrace?

How about the retrace from 7050 to 7800? Or retrace from 6100-6800? Or retrace from 8600-9800? Or retrace from 8600 - 9500? Or retrace from 7900-8500? 

What kinda retrace are you looking for? Those are all pretty significant retraces, mate. 
I vividly remember when my perspective of clunky mobile phones of the 80s and 90s changed as they became smart phones -- it was unexpected but revolutionary. We could be in the Nokia brick phase and in ten more years will have memes about 10 minute confirmations for most transactions. We could also be putting the cart before the horse and baked way too much of that into the price
Android has existed for 10 years, smartphones (symbian OS)  has been around for longer and PDAs for 10 years before that and PCs for even longer than that with Calculators having existed for thousands of years prior to PCs.

each stage is an evolution of the previous and it is disingenuous to claim that the prior stage had no effect on the first.

Cryptos have a bona fide use cases of international money transfer , gambling and ponzi schemes (last 2 are /s).

seriously though, If I wanted to move 10k it might cost me a few hundy give or take exchange rates. using bitcoin it is much cheaper (100+ at most) and is significantly faster
and including my answer to your comment
I miss the libertarian days of bitcoin.  At least, it was fun chatting with all the techy hippie anti-establishment cyberpunk types back then.
Because it removes much of the utility of Bitcoin.  It becomes less useful to people, so it becomes less valuable to them.   Before, you could freely buy and sell digital tokens.  Just like you can buy and sell comic books or bottlecaps or chairs or most anything else.  

Now it is illegal to sell $1 of BTC in many places without giving the gov't thousands of dollars first and doing a huge stack of paperwork.   

You also can not buy it anonymously nearly as easily as before, so its utility as a way to have some financial privacy has been eroded.

You also can't spend it as easily as before, because now you have to do paperwork even if you buy a coffee for $2.00.  

It's all because of regulation and that's why they did the regulation to begin with...to hurt cryptocurrency adoption and protect their legacy banking cartel monopoly.
must be the classic buy high sell low.
That and noobs are fearful and want to gtfo. I remember when I first experienced my crash several years ago.. I was hella scared at the price I got in, and sold a bit.
Reminder to spread your counter-party risk around.
FOMO works in both directions. 

Patience is a virtue that's helpful in all aspects of life. Market trading is no different. 


> If I had ridden my $10k short down to here, I could have closed for massive gains, but instead I turned it into multiple shorts on the way down.

But if it had bounced earlier, you would have made less profit...sounds like good risk management to me, congrats on your streak!
Not sure how much experience you have, but most professional traders have a rule to not add to losing trades. 
I'm actually somewhat irked by having low volume and then someone coming along and actually dumping or pumping the crap out of BTC.  Can this thing never, ever rest and be allowed to equilibrate and trade sideways for a couple of months?  Let it breath and let other things in the space develop around it?  Would for sure facilitate real-world adoption of crypto generally.  I know all you traders love it but as a holder who reluctantly swing trades I find the rampant manipulation depressing as it ruins the use cases.
I mostly mean that clearly there’s been more selling pressure in the past months. And as it currently stands, if the volume trend continues like this, I think it’s more likely that the price will continue to drop as well.

Low volume doesn’t by itself correlate to declining price. I just think for us to truly turn this around there would at least have to be a period of increasing buying volume.
Yeah but they generally offer no insight when you communicate with them directly, like if you try to argue with them or tell them anything. So I don't get why you do it. 

I visit there too but I know better than trying to say anything other than "lol buttcoin sucky sucky"

They're the inverse of the hodl club with even more conviction
ya know I get doubting bitcoin and being skeptical but watching it go from $300 to $20000 is kind of stupid. Like at some point might as well throw a few hundred in or something. Just kinda silly not to 
>That type of upward volatility would likely come after a swift move down or a period of consolidation within a range

Could also come after a slow grind up over several weeks. But, yeah, not out of no where.
stokinator deleted so the bottom's gotta be near.
Problem is that its going to be followed by a long, dull period of accumulation and low volatility.

Sentiment did get a bit worse in 2014.
Maybe I’ll catch a nice Kraken wick or something.

Potential “ Bottom “ In ( I dont think so ) and tether printing could have some people thinking we are gonna pump high and some fomo May kick in, never know. 

May just scale into short 25% each entry from $6250-$6400

these spoofy buy walls are making it obvious which way they expect this to go

although people moving their sells up to $6500 means we could at least see that first.

not expecting much more out of this bounce anymore though- market looks like it's teetering on the edge of the cliff, ready to jump lol
$4500-$5000 should provide significant support should we get there, IMO. If we break back under the downtrend line again, I'll be a bit more concerned. 
if it's the same person, wonder why someone would put a visible buy wall at $6,200 and an invisible buy wall at $6,245. almost as if they *want* people to sell into it...we shall see.

you get stopped out during that stop hunt? I remember you said your stops were around $6,090
heh, all joking aside, there really was an invisible buy wall there
It's unorthodox thinking but the idea is not entirely without merit.
Pretty Low R:R no? Or do you see it as the probability to go to 5.6 more likely than to your stoploss? 
2700-4700 depending on when the ratio gets there, along with total crypto dominance.

Don't leave us hanging OP!

I'm interested as to *why* if he means the former. 
Editions 1-6. I should have just stated it that way. Peter Brandt recommended this textbook but only editions 1-6, because those editions were still from the original authors. Apparently the newer editions have been “updated” by another author. I assume Peter Brandt believes these revisions have tainted the work by Edwards and Magee.
Technical Analysis and Stock Market Profits by Richard W. Schabacker. Good luck!
I'm a bit lost sometimes when it comes to shorter time frames so I could be wrong but my feeling is if we're not above $6250 in 4h then we are going to start testing ~$6050 within the next 12-24h. could be 12h of $6100-6200 before that

if we are above $6250 then I would expect either meandering between $6200-6350 for another 12h and a potential test of $6400+ within the next day

this is pretty much 100% pulled out of my ass though. I'm basing it off of former periods of chop. So it doesn't have to play out like this at all.

It could totally just go sideways and be confusing and boring
ayyy I got this one pretty good huh?
A market maker is someone who provides liquidity. Liquidity is how easy it is to convert an asset to money or vice versa without affecting the price.

If the order book is thin, there's low liquidity, and larger orders will move the price significantly. in a highly liquid environment, large players (people with lots of funds/supply of an asset) can freely buy and sell without worrying about slippage: slippage is moving the price too much while buying or selling- that is, they get a worse price because they bought/sold so much that it cleared the books. 

So big players rely on liquidity to participate in markets. Market makers provide liquidity in exchange for either maker fees (they get paid when their limit orders are filled for a % of the size of the fill) or simply through market making bots.

Market making bots set limit orders above or below current ask/bid prices based on complex quantitative algorithms. Even without maker fees, these bots can make money through these complex algorithms. 

Market makers encourage big players to participate while also reaping the rewards through fees + complex HFT algorithms that net them money over time. 

In summary: That 60 btc is a market making bot that provides liquidity in exchange for making money over time through quantitative algorithms that attempt to buy low and sell high on a micro level. 

You can even market make yourself: Set a buy order at $6200 and a sell order at $6201. You've effectively made the market more liquid and you will profit $1 if both get filled. That is, essentially, what a market making bot does. Over and over and over. 
Thank you sir! As always :D

fuck Nano, biggest scam I ever got involved with. Lost 35 BTC on those dev shilling that mtgox 2.0 exchange. Never touching it again, never trust those devs.
No, but it works and it's very reliable (ETH has had capacity issues a few times). I haven't seen people pay with nanos, are there merchants that accept them?
No, Bitcoin (Core) can still go up if the digital gold paradigm sticks. I tend to doubt that if there are competing coins that are very similar that can be used as p2p cash. It just makes little sense to me to use one coin as cash, and another as gold. But who knows, I might be wrong.

Anyway, Bitcoin (Core) going up doesn't mean the other need to go down because of that. Ethereum has other applications, too. And Bitcoin Cash is developing those as well (colored coins, memo.cash,  re-activating old OP_RETURN codes).
Unless it had a start value of zero, yes, it can go down more than 100&#37;.  
Since OP is counting from "start of bull run to end", and "start of bull run" > 0, then price for sure can go down over 100&#37;. Not what I think will happen though, personally.
Good luck
Reality is that crypto move faster than you assume
Exactly, so OP's comment is unnecessary
You sound upset that anyone else is trying to talk sense about the current situation.
75% or 80% down from the high is not "retarded".  It is a logical and rational calculation of what is likely.

> after 70-80% down

You are bad at math.
Really?? It was easier to trade all the way back then? 
meaning we all should of sold when he did?  funny how he used the excuse that he doesn't want to stir the market too much by being the leader of lite coin, so he conveniently sells at the top
> Eventually, us investors will outpower the short term speculators.

the down trend is very likely caused by investors cashing out, not short term speculators. 
“It just has to start going up”, sounds more like gambling than investing. I have a long term position, but I can’t help that feel without a serious underlying shift in the manner in which new money is onboarded, and without producing actual value, crypto will continue to behave like a speculative. 

It seems likely to me, just not yet.

sorry, not sure what you just said, I don't understand sign language 
Not attacking you or your arguments by the way :) Just pointing out in a raging bull market you would be downvoted hard for being rational. I think you're wrong though, I think a reversal will catch most by surprise sooner rather than later.
OK, maybe this is all right. 

I guess my googling has run into a temporary roadblock on this issue to confirm. At any rate, not a spot for further discussion on the daily.  
Well, considering I did not know that any had been burnt, I guess I can? 

Just wish I understood.
Setting up a short and walking away would be almost as dumb as setting up a long and walking away. You are incredibly confused...not a surprise.  
Or a text book bull flag breaks up with the target above that wedge.
Yes if the price drops $300, that does erase all the gains from $300 below the current price.  Thank you for that amazing insight.
Shorts are at the same amount as the 11th.  Plenty of room for new ones to open.

I'm scaling into a short too.  But I also have half of a yolo long still open from the bottom of the tether pump, which I'll close on the way down, like so many other longs out there.

If this goes down soon without the current context changing, I feel it's gonna go down hard and steady, with little interim pauses and practically no relief.

/u/nor3g just kind of made me have a "d'oh" moment when he reminded me that what I am describing is a trend.

I guess we'll see how long the trend lasts though.

I mean, we've all gotten so used to ranging and going down after going up and going up after going down.

I've kinda forgotten what it's like to just...not stop moving in the same direction, ya know? It's weird. Kinda like december in reverse
Bullish.
Yea you just made me realize I basically said we're trending...like I said I thought we would a few weeks ago after breaking down from the triangle...lol
Well at some point it won't be profitable. but yea, it's possible btc does it's trend-y thing and surprises people with how strong it can trend for a while. 
Im not shorting.. just replied to NOR3G.

I'm a buyer / adding when it is above 6200 for 4 -6 hours
That hidden wall is built my Mr. D. Trump himself. Jesus how much can it absorb?
At the time of this comment, the price is up about 1.5% since this time yesterday. If it does this every day for a week (which it won't) we will be up over 10 percent in a week. Not every reversal starts with a BGD. Most start slowly and gain steam over a period of weeks.

My old buddy Cameron the Camel. 

Just waiting for the vomit: https://www.tradingview.com/x/HQZMyQFO/
Just over 6300. Also happens to be basically break even for me.
lots of times. there was a few at like $6600-6700. I wouldn't put my faith into a big buy or sell wall unless it was like...1000+ btc or something. but even then I've seen bigger right before we tanked.

At $13580 someone accumulated some 1500 coins with the biggest hidden buy wall i've ever seen. next few days we were at $9k
You're doing too well, more beer.
Hope you placed some stops

If you don't understand it, not my problem. Take it constructively to see the meaning.
Where is more Tether when you need it.

*Bears cease to care*

*As you open up your chart to stare*

*Only shorting can ever repair*

*The tears caused by despair*
It really depends- as much as everyone likes to counter trade the shorts/longs on bitfinex, they're not always wrong. That is, shorts closing and longs opening doesn't mean the price is going to go down.

But yes, a decent amount of this is shorts closing

It's hard to tell if someone is distributing or someone is accumulating. You can use the top of our short term range (5800-6200) as a case for distribution but you could use this as the bottom of our longer term range (5800- say, 7800) and call it accumulation.

I think lots of traders are expecting a bounce/short term bottom here. 
If the visible wall attracts the market, they'd have little incentive to do that. Another entity would make way more sense to put one there to "juke" the buyer. Still, we had a high volume V bottom that provided a 10% bounce, then this tether pump that rallied another 3% just as we were dropping off the bounce, and we *still* couldn't break and hold 6300. Doesn't instill much confidence.  
I think some alts that improve on bitcoin in some meaningful way (like Monero with privacy) will also see large gains. 
If you don’t know what it is how can you begin to speculate how much “legitimate persons and businesses” care about it?


actually that is ridiculously huge and only reason its not already a big thing is cause people haven't figured it out
this use case will be lost on most people who live in the first world who have never experienced hyperinflation/corrupt government seizing one's bank account. the rest of the world doesn't need to be convinced of the utility of a mechanism that allows people to control their own wealth independently of a fiat currency or a nationstate. it's pretty fucking revolutionary my dude.
I guess it's remittance without middleman. Like https://www.mobileworldlive.com/asia/asia-news/alipay-claims-global-first-with-blockchain-remittance/
People care about freedom. It's hard to stomach for bureocrats and statists but it's something that's always been true, people will naturally gravitate to technology which facilitates decentralization of power and the expression of their own individual freedoms.
Retail investors will not invest until it is already going up fast again, that's just how they work, they only FOMO.  But if you wait until then, you miss lots of the gains you can get by starting down here.  Many are waiting for 10k to be breached, but holy shit waiting and watching from 6k to 10k is 40% gains you are watching fly by.
sorry, they use Binance for underlying EOS price, 

I assumed they used polo standard for their altcoins (all the others alt-contracts use polo for underlying price)
You are thinking of swaps. OP is asking about futures.
from my understanding, for futures nobody pays anybody else anything 'directly'

"the bitmex book keeping system" settles all outstanding debts at expiry date: losses&wins are in 1:1 relation, so some people lose/win, but bitmex is the mediator for this... on a normal exchange person 1 sells to, or buys from, person 2 (they "exchange" the thing they buy/sell), for bitmex futures nobody is 'exchanging' anything directly

negative/positive premiums are additional losses/wins incorporated in the "bitmex book keeping system," even though person 1 will not pay person 2 directly for this; it is incorporated indirectly in the book-keeping, and settled on expiry date -- as I understand it.

for perpetual swaps, since there is no expiry date where bitmex "settles the book keeping" the mechanism is probably different, I assume money/funding is immediately transfered from account 1 to account 2 in this case, but I don't know how exactly they implemented this
Great, thanks!
People can't be that stupid can they?

Wish I could upvote this more than once.
thank you for disabusing me of my underdeveloped brain (and my sandy vagina!) 🙏
With the new ruling they won't be selling anymore, they still have to credit everyone who had funds on Gox but that won't happen until 2019 now

Why do you say that? I mean, considering the price of BTC is so much higher than in '13.

He is making America Great Again, but allowing companies to dump toxic sludge into our rivers and selling national parks to miners and drillers.
China needs to be dealt with, their predatory trade practices and out right theft of intellectual property is not only costing the US billions, but other countries as well.

The thing is, I wouldn't be starting any fights with my actual allies considering we need as much economic pressure as possible to deal with China 
Haha could be, but the idea that BTC should go up in value by 5% because Tether got printed is genuinely laughable :P

That said, I did bail on my short in profit as soon as I saw the tweet, then re-short $200 higher lol
If the NY Times said the sky was blue I'd go out and check.
ok
Bullish.
The bearish outlook prevails, the earlier BGD notwithstanding.
They would have enough USDT on hand to provide liquidity to tiny markets which are also served by other MMs, when it's in the interest of everyone involved. Maybe third parties are providing sufficient liquidity on their own, maybe Tether itself is intervening occasionally, or continuously. Whatever it is, it doesn't relate to the alleged scam in any way, which is what you seem to suggest in your post.
Oh. Even better!!
3 sat/byte generally isn't bad. Just be patient. You can orient yourself by this: https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/

Worse???? You are kidding right? We are in the fucking moon compared to that. Jesus I remember after the mt gox implosion around the time of the slashing of the bearwhale when our little nerd project was on the brink of fading into irrelevance dreaming that sometime we will reach the price of gold again and retiring which sounded ludicrous to even say aloud. To think that some years later people will be depressed at 6000 sounds so surreal...
I've been here since 2011.  This is just bitcoin being bitcoin, nothing out of the ordinary.
I was here in 2013. Bought bitcoin right before the first run to $250 or so. Went through two crahes back to back. This doesn't feel worse to me. 

I sold half my coins during this bubble, and am holding the other half. Gonna wait and see what happens in the next couple of years.
bitcoin has had so many blow-off tops already- there's no way anyone who's been around since 2011 (like he has) is fazed* by the price action. the only way someone from 2011 could be depressed by this is if they were sitting on millions and never cashed out or if they don't like the direction of the tech

the blow-off top is nothing new. that dude probably went through the $32 to $2 crash. would be like going to $1250 now
Fair enough, at least you have your reasons
Doesn’t matter. Mentally wise we are there
Absolutely. Gonna be waiting for next recession on entering the stock market and buying some property
Jump in dude. I'll blow the lid on it. Global poker is the easiest games on Earth. Still gonna need some studying but mannn America's card room and bovada/ignition are alot harder. Go to the /r/poker Reddit and watch poker pros live on twitch every day. You'll learn. Quickly too I bet
Online is fucking ridiculous. Don’t even think about attempting without tracking software. 

I remember the amount of effort I had to put in just to break even once I reached a bankroll size large enough to tackle 10nl... lol
yeah i quit playing for a living back in january after that trip to vegas. however i've gone up to my local casino maybe 3-4 times since then just to spend a day back at the tables and its still a ton of fun. especially now that its just for fun and not for money to live off of. i played a tournament for 8 hours just a few days ago. chopped for first. only like 1500$ but was still just fun to be back at it. 

as for traveling... ugh id love to man. i've just got this reallllly intense fear with flying. gonna have to get over it. i'll scoop up some drugs for the flights
Seems like a candidate for a big cash out. That's probably 100M that's not going back into crypto. We should see the market cap of tether drop by that much, though. 

100M is about 5% of all tether. We need to see about 5 more of those before it even moves position in list of alt market caps. I think we'd see a proportionate drop in alts if that happened, though.
I assume there's a difference between printed and circulating tether.

So Tether has a stack of non-circulating reserve Tether and a stack of (extra, non-backing) fiat. They'll only print new Tether when their reserve runs low.
that and from miners, and there are several local exchanges and websites. OTC is also a popular alternative.
Exchanges have a history of blocking and confiscating Iranian accounts and you can't expect non-trading average people to do that. And we're very much used to 30% variance within a few weeks, but for every day items. So that is just daily business, nothing big. 
Very good then (:
Load the weekly chart, 0 retrace from 10k to 5.8k
I'm primarily talking about the software evolution. Bitcoin will generally not see hardware improvements because, well, it's not a hardware thing. Unless I'm mistaken...

But smart phone software has improved exponentially (to be fair, this is primarily because of the hardware capabilities improving) while bitcoin has largely remained stagnant. LN is of course an improvement but there is generally a lot that is left to be desired after 10 years of existence 

I do agree in general that cryptos have a bona fide use case- it's just that I'm sort of unsure if it will be bitcoin. 
Wasn't this sort of shift to be expected once more players entered the game? Also it's not like bitcoin itself changed or anything. I think it'll find its best use-case organically anyway, which is why I like it so much. Maybe I'm just naive. 
Or, buy a bunch at 10, and then buy enough at 1000 that you are at a loss for years in the ensuing bear market.  The moments in (paper)profit between 10 and 1000 are fleeting in comparison.
Where'd you buy and sell? Just curious. Back then, I mean
Are you no longer afraid?
I never knew how patient I could be until I started losing money by being impatient :P
I can't say I'm a professional trader, but I've been rekt enough times getting greedy and trying to maximize my gains that I feel I've learned a more appropriate risk management strategy. I generally only enter trades on more extreme price extensions as they begin to look overextended, and add in small portions if it manages to go further up/down, then buy/sell on the bounce up/down. If it happens that the trade continues to go the wrong way, I'm sure I'll have to close at a loss, but I keep my liquidation considerably outside the likely range just to be safe. I'm sure it may get me rekt eventually, but I'm continuing to get more conservative as my stack increases to protect my stack.

(Edit: You're right though, and I'm definitely trying to be more careful in this approach in case a major breakout happens one way or another.)
It'd definitely be good to have bitcoin be tamed a bit. Tbqh there's a possibility it does end up being tamed like gold or something. Gold made its huge run and then futures opened and it tanked and then evened out. 

It'd be funny to see btc range between $3-12k for the rest of its existence :P
Increased volume happens as a result of a price breakout, not the other way around. Buying and selling doesn't happen much when the price stays the same other than market makers trying to scalp the spread. 
>They're the inverse of the hodl club with even more conviction



That's exactly why I like to read there. They also go through all the drama for free for like 20 different subs 
Who is Stokinator and why is this significant? I personally believe we're not near the bottom price wise but we should find the bottom before September.
Perhaps, but certainly not near the bottom or at the bottom. Most of the posts around 300-167 dollars still seem hopeful, or discussing the tech, or buying more bitcoin. There are bears as well.
I may set a crazy one on September to see if I get lucky haha
I think we stall under 6400, personally. We'll see if there's another 2% fomo pump in this thing, though. 
Got stuck with my dick in my hand from a short from $8060 when tether printed 300 mil last month.  I think pump got to $8400 
Indeed. So tell me, soros, do I be aggressive at the beginning of this trade right here? haha
yeah but I got back in at $6,150

so it didn't affect the position too much 
> Or do you see it as the probability to go to 5.6 more likely than to your stoploss

I do. Also keep in mind my entry is @ 6140 on September futures, which are currently at about a $60 discount ($6075 vs $6131 spot), so my entry is really closer to $6200 spot.

I chart by hand with pencil and paper. I get a text to my old nokia with the current price every 5 minutes and then I just draw the candlesticks. Isn't this how everyone does it?


iPhone 8+ and small hands does the trick lol

Too much of a hassle  to go to my laptop every time i want to throw up some lines, been doing it on mobile for 2 months now :) 
Looks more like a channel than a wedge. 
The trend never 'has' to reverse 
Nope. You?

I short. don't worry but mainly long... And I have the time.

Since BTC was at  600$ and 1200$
Perhaps being innovative isn't the most important thing for a crypto. Reliablity on the other hand, is. 

Last week, a customer of mine got into trouble paying for his server with BTC. The transaction fees suddenly mushroomed, and his payment got stuck. And his wallet didn't support CPFP. I asked him to check if his hosting provider also accepted BCH. They did, and next time he'll pay with BCH. (His BTC payment went through after almost a day.) These kind of experiences are a real turn off for users.
The BCH team - CSW, nChain etc is \*extremely\* innovative.

Yes that’s why the guy who posted that comment is literally a billionaire from all of the easy trading he did
yea. I mean there were a lot of smart people who cashed out at the top because they could recognize a blow-off top when they saw it. He may have just been one of them

We can call him a dirtbag for selling his bags to other people but I mean he literally publicly advertised that he sold. He was probably genuinely trying to be nice
I may have worded it badly. I don't mean it is bound to happen. I mean to say is all that is required is for the price to start ticking upwards.
any blind person will help you out interpret it.
I am confused by your time commitment to this forum, given that you're essentially a broken record and do not appear to have dynamic thought process.

Bitcoin is broke and it sucks.  We get it, bud.
You’re a terrible troll 
A drop here would be extremely violent, especially if 6k is  obliterated. Ide be looking to start scaling out of short around $5750-$5500.

What’s your current entry? 
Oh alright. I’d be fine with that, I’ve already gotten this far.
You got it... Shorting this low seems as foolish as buying at 15k, but then again we expect the trend to continue and have no solid idea how low the price can actually go. (Aside from zero...)

Then the question becomes, what signs are you looking for to indicate a proper reversal? Do you trust wizardry like MACD and RSI divergence? Do you wait for support levels to hold on the way up?
whats a market?
> Well at some point it won't be profitable.

What could stop a whale to dump on exchanges and buy back more OTC, then repeat?
I know you would never short, that's why i wrote /bucky. Should have replied to nor3g though :-D.
That's how a new bull run starts. A reversal starts with a BRD, a capitulation, and then a bounce. We will have that reversal and then we will have a slow upward grind which will lead to the next ATH.

If we know that large visible buy walls tend to drag the market down toward the wall, and we want to accumulate coins, then one could set up a large visible wall and then put an invisible wall slightly higher to catch coins on the way down. It's possible that the person who put the wall up at $6,200 doesn't think/want the price will/to get that low from here, so to force sell pressure, create a wall that attracts sell pressure, and catch the sold coins right into your hidden wall, then move up. we shall see... (I'm probably overthinking it, as usual)
"Improvements" are mostly a fantasy scenario. They're all a semi-trivial to implement edge that these projects create. Effectively, all the "improvements" I've see are solutions in search of a problem. I can't think of a broad and legitimate market force that really cares about full privacy.

I do think that the top 5 crypto by market cap are going to be the big winners, behind Bitcoin.

Re privacy coins: implementations are going to fail against quantum computers in the next 10 years, anyway.
Monero has gone up 15% in the past 24h. Not surprising, it's as secure as Bitcoin but with solid privacy on top of that.
So define it and then explain why they would care. 
heh yeah, when it finally clicks for people it's going to be beautiful 
Yeah they have. People have heard of bitcoin and people choose not to use it. I have held bitcoin for 4 years and have yet to make any transaction that wasn't trading. 
This, 100%. 
And you think the third world, which owns a tiny faction of the world's wealth,  adopting bitcoin will somehow make it rocket up in price... why?
There is a middleman in bitcoin, though. The miners and on ramps. 

What's more, if neither of us own bitcoin it's impossible to transfer bitcoin without first passing through an intermediary. 
Is Bitcoin decentralized still? It's secured by huge centralized mining farms. The on ramps are centralized third parties which increasingly kowtow to government pressure.
I think that is an interesting assumption about a specific price.

I would argue that 10k would still be irrelevant to everyone except those already in the space.
Ok I was talking about the funding fee for swaps and was told by Bitmex that those with short positions pay longs and vice versa.

Bullish
Let's say you sold off your extensive Beanie Baby collection for a classic Lambo, only to have it stolen from you just a year or two later. Five years after that, not only is your stolen Lambo returned to you, but it's in even better condition than when it was stolen, and the valuation has drastically increased. Would you then sell that car for an even bigger Beanie Baby collection?

Now that these people are getting their BTC back, I don't see them willingly getting rid of it all over again.
Back then, the price wasn't why they got into crypto in the first place. These are the people who really mean it when they say that they're in it for the tech. They don't think of the valuation of BTC in terms of fiat any more than you or I think of the valuation of Lambos in terms of Ford Focus's.
Didn’t catch your ninja edit you 10 fingered speed freak. 

When you closing your short from 7.6?
0.3x long Sept 6.1...
I'm long and don't think it's very wise, if 6.3 breaks it will be a swift move to 6.7-6.8 (which I'll be a seller of as it's heavy resistance on multiple timeframes, ema, ma, horizontal, kijun and whatnot). That being said if 6.3 fails to break, it's bad and you have a good entry.
The truth hurts, I get it.
if true
Also a simple trick you can try if you have control over the receiving address and are in a hurry (not sure if your Binance wallet will allow that), is to make another transaction using unconfirmed input. If you set fees for such TX high enough, a miner will pick it regardless of unconfirmed parent, confirming both. That's the so-called Child-Pays-For-Parent (CPFP) scheme.
Yup. This crash has been much easier on me than the 2013 one actually. I feel I expected it and have gotten used to it. The 2013 crash sucked, but I held most, and it paid off.

There will be many pump and dump cycles on the way to mass adoption. Either that or it will fail completely. 
that guy has been posting that same comment for like 5 weeks now mate...probably not the best sentiment indicator. 
What does the tracking software do?
Oh that kinda sucks. There's no way to play unaugmented (as in, no tracking software) poker online then probably, huh?

I kind of want to just learn poker in general- if it's anything like trading I think I'd enjoy it

And you should totally just take some Valium for your flight. Out of curiosity though, where does the fear come from? It's statistically safe AF to fly these days. Then again, I doubt the fear is logical... So I probably can't help you with throwing logic at ya ; D
>That's probably 100M that's not going back into crypto

Does that make sense though?  Are you suggesting that a whale contacted Bitfinex to let them know that they are planning on cashing out?  I would think it is them getting low on tether, which could be anticipating cashing out if we drop or could be anticipating a bull run and more external interest.  Maybe they are just thinking that one of these two possibilities could occur and they want to be ready?
Someone cashing out big would increase the amount of tether on finex not vice-versa.
OK, I am just thinking out loud here. If a stack of non-circulating reserve Tether exists, then it will not be guaranteed to be 1:1 backed for all of Tether, which is fine as long as circulating tether is backed.

However, this makes the total market cap hard to comprehend, I will say that. I mean in theory, ALL of it could be cashed out and it would be in the total market cap with hundreds of billions in valuation. 

Seems like burning them would make so much more sense.
Interesting. It's easy to buy? From vendors and exchanges?
Bitcoin itself did change.  Because what you can use it for changed quite a bit.  Not to mention the $50 mining fees last year that were a major change fora while as well.
Yeah not saying it's surprising or even necessarily a bad thing.  Just being nostalgic.
I've been in crypto since 2012 or so, so I'm actually wishing it goes down even more so that I can buy.
[deleted]
I think some "taming" would come about naturally as distribution increases and the whales become less of an influence.  Of course that would never stop someone from making enormous OTC buys for 1 day dumpathons or anyone from running P&Ds.  All of this would become harder with distribution though.  I don't think we need secondary markets for taming and I actually don't think the advent of it has helped that situation very much.  I actually thought $7500 was going to be the price for a while due to the major volume drop. but Mr. Bear Whale wasn't having any of that and just couldn't resist. 
The thing about gold being 'tamed' is a silly meme with no grounding in reality. The price movements around the futures bubble were the largest, but it's not as if it just went flat afterwards.
Well yes, I like to read there too. But you try to talk to them about trading and stuff and all they do is laugh at you lol
Do you have a sub set I can visit to get a 40+ individual up to speed on today's youth?  Is think outside the box still a buzzword?  or paradigm shift?


only the most bullish guy ever who just would not stop going long over and over again. 

He deleted his account last night and I noticed it, thought it was kinda funny, so I commented about it. I think btcqq is kinda joking but I mean...it's also possible a legitimate "bottom is near" signal lol
I suggest you check out the non-bottom dailies as well. like 2014. You mainly looked at 2015 I think. the sentiment is confusing in 2014- it's frequently very depressing with some 1/3 people not believing in the bounces, being despondent, etc and the other 2/3 being extraordinarily bullish and hopeful 
You catch any entry?

I did 
if I were trying to re-enter a short I would've put some limit orders at around $6300-6350. now I would be wary to add a bunch here vs just watching n waiting personally. 

you could try to get filled near the top but it may not happen, idk. like I said, could still go to $6400-6500. past that and color me a bit skeptical 

personally I think we're at the "reprieve" section of the dump where shorts close because they assume it's dumped enough. and then it goes lower somehow

Same thing happened $12k to $6k. of those 17k shorts that opened $10-12k, 11k of them closed at like $8k. and then the price continued to tank
Back in to another quick long?
I swear someone is stop hunting you. Your stops have been within like +/- $30 of every fakeout lately :P

think there was another where we dipped to $6470 and you had stops at like $6490 or something
Seems reasonable. I don't know anything about futures tho, I trade on kraken. 
that's definitely a joke gypsy would make though :P
The joke would've been clearer had I quoted OP's "buy" remark. The joke being that Trav always thinks Bitcoin can only go up.

Poorly executed, but Parabolic Trav material is well worth mining. Lots of humor to be had memeing individuals like those in bear markets such as these.
Np, sorry if it's confusing at all
Some said the same thing at 20k. And yes it does, I don't know what to say about such a baseless claim. 
Why would I be jealous? I’m happy for the person making money, but sad thinking about all the taxes they’ll have to pay.

He was not trying to be nice. He sold his coins while claiming it has nothing to do with prices or what he expects the markets to do, but rather because he doesn't want there to be a conflict of interests or some such bullshit. 

Charlie Lee is many things, but a nice guy who cares about his twitter flock he is not. 
very true.  now that I'm going through this bear market, its obvious in hindsight that anybody who's been in bitcoin and buying pre-1k would of probably sold at least some of their stash.  But then again there are ppl here who say they have never sold?  which is unbelievable to me. At the same time its difficult to time the top .  I imagine a lot of people sold at 10k only to watch it hit 19k-ish.  There was also people who sold when it hit 5k the first time thinking we'd have a massive correction then.  I think when it eventually passes last ATH its going to be impossible to predict what will happen.  Hopefully we don't have to wait many years
Sure, I understand. I am saying that there aren’t enough hands in the space to drive it to a point whereby a new ATH is a reasonable probability, and without a new take on the space it seems unsustainable. 
Yes you are confused.  And Bitcoin has failed to live up to the hype...few reasonable people would honestly dispute that.    But go ahead and open a long or short position and walk away...good luck with that.
> If this violently breaks down it could erase all gains from pump.
Short is 6265 on swaps (bleh), long is 6125 on sept (also bleh, added a bit on that big drop (*the weird drop at 19h UTC on sept) and brought its ca a tad close for comfort, the add had extra weight since I had already taken some profits).

I'll take profits next on the long around 6400 and then reevaluate whatever happens around the horizontal line I have there for the bitfinex april low.

Short is currently only 10% the size of the long.  Short grows until 6500.  No plan on profit targets for the short, it's more for safety.   Maybe I'd put some profit orders on it near the ATH resistance around 5400 just in case we do a V somewhere, as that is a likely bounce point.  Otherwise I'll evaluate later, relatively uncharted territory after all.
> A drop here would be extremely violent

Maybe, but probably not.
Why would a drop be extremely violent? Because you say so? What about a nice little pump? Would that also be violent? The last one sure was.
limited supply?
Nothing would be stopping anyone from doing that. I'm sure that's going on somewhere 
Go it... No problem.
A reversal starts with a meme, a meme, and then a meme. The price went sideways for HALF A YEAR in 2015. Rounded / flat bottoms are a thing, in fact a far more likely thing than the blood on the streets memes people keep memeing about after an extended downtrend such as this. For a capitulation wick down to actually happen, there has to be an overwhelming supply that swiftly overpowers the demand -- an unlikely story somewhere in, say, 3ks or whatever bear dreams. Down under $5000, there simply aren't any magical price levels where some random shrimps are going to panic en masse to overwhelm the orderbooks, and no one with serious liquidity is going to be dumping thousands of coins to try and paint the charts or whatever all the way down because there's too much risk someone even bigger than you calls bullshit on your plays.

oh I didn't realize it was that big. Yea, idk. I try to just ignore them either way, although it's hard not to get excited about it when it's in your favor.

Seen too many dudes put up huge walls just to have the market completely obliterate them a few days later. That guy who bought 400 btc at $8600 on gdax...went to $6.4k a week later

guy who bought thousands at $13500...price was $9k a few days later.

half the time I just assume it's wash trading because I've probably seen those hidden walls be wrong more often than not

Go to bed.
Not all privacy coins should be put in the same bag. Monero has a track record of adapting to new challenges, and its devs will upgrade the algorithms to make them quantum resistant, whenever quantum computing becomes a reality.
There is so much nonsense in your post I don’t know where to begin. 

Which part of ringCT, stealth addressing and ringSigs will be broken by quantum?

Fungibility is a **serious** issue for Bitcoin, and it cannot be fixed as a layer two bolt on. It needs to be in the protocol. 


Monero got fucking rekt the last weeks that's the only reason it bounced 15%. 
Why hasn't it clicked in nearly 10 years?
> somehow make it rocket up in price... 

did I say that?
Bitcoin is neither the miners it hires to secure the network nor is it the platforms that include it in their trading services. Those can't interrupt protocol, can't censor transactions and can't change the supply.
Soo wait is this guy even aware what's going on?
can't upvote this even though it's funny. i'll be tracked down
[deleted]
I have 3 positions open, swaps will close first since the funding rates will probably go to shit again. have limit orders at $5555 rn.

For june/sept sort of unsure, targets are $5k and $4.5k, but that could potentially be weeks away

I have a feeling we are going to be re-entering this lower range soon (~$5.3-$5.9) and the "big dump" I'm waiting for won't happen until we move below that new range

if it goes higher? Possibly $6.4-6.5 for swaps. I'm sort of unsure where I want to close if it goes higher. I might wait through a push to $7k even. If it's a slow measured move up I will probably be more hesitant. If it's a large dildo that peters out, I will wait for $7k. If it's a large, panic buying massive candle, I will likely close it quickly.

Not expecting that since there simply aren't enough shorts to squeeze 
Wouldn't that be 1.3x long, or are you 0.66x short?
Oh ok, didn’t noticed. All is canceled 
just guessing but with poker keeping track of the cards in play is a huge advantage- with tracking software you have access to information a normal person would never be able to hold in their heads for any extended period of time
Yeah what sloppy said. Basically you can track any stat you want and use it to profile players. Some of the essentials are VPIP and PFR which are Voluntary Put In Pot and PreFlop aggression Rate. 

Use this to instantly profile a player (say sub 50-100 hands). Once you’ve built a more extensive sample size you can start getting a bit more complicated, including stats such as the opponent’s chance of c-betting, 3-betting or 4-betting. You can start to get fancy by checking their chances of making plays when in position too.

The tracking software compiles this data in an easy-to-read, customisable HUD that appears on screen.
You will need at least a few years and probably experience some bad shit before you will learn how to play Poker. After 15 years of actively playing i still feel i have a lot to improve, it’s fucking mental
Yeah yeah. I know it's illogical and I know the numbers haha. I can't. I'll work on it though. Only flown twice and both were in my adult life. 21 and 23. Just gotta do it more to get over it. The turbulence in my first trip had me shaking and squeezing my fists until I had white knuckles. Rough landing. Rough take off. Just terrifying to me haha. If I wanna do anything cool in my life I'm sure I'll make myself get over it. Valium can help 😂
I'm privately speculating that it's an exchange getting their 100 million USD because they have an excess of USDT on hand and not enough USD. Maybe it's a whale. It could be anything. I don't know why you'd send USDT to Bitfinex if you're not planning to cash it out.
>100M that they have already printed

The USDT is being returned to Bitfinex.

Edit: If it's truly returned, then it will eventually be destroyed. [Less: Quarantined Tether](https://wallet.tether.to/transparency) should increase by 100M
Yeah, if they were aiming for an image of legitimacy and transparency, daily adjustments by burning or printing would make more sense.
yes, direct bank access to vendors and exchanges. Because the banking system is local and does not follow any international rules, it is very easy to use intermediaries to link your bank account to exchanges. Many local internet services use such intermediary services. 

And there is a thriving OTC market in social media and mining groups. 
The fees last year were absurd for sure. However, I think that was adoption and use getting ahead of the tech. I'm speculating the fee structure will be sorted out in due time, hopefully by the time the next bull run begins.

If it becomes apparent that scaling while maintaining a decentralized structure is impossible, I'll jump ship.
I envy you. I feel 99.999% certain your wish will be granted. I wish I was in a position to hope for downward price action. As someone who has only been in this space for around 18 months, this feels absolutely terrible. 
Tether hasn't taken over yet but /u/Wardser is absolutely right - why not?  No futures were necessary there to make Tether work. It meets the basic use case of a stable digital currency.
Interesting, thanks. It's late and I read that stupid medium article...probably should have refrained from taking it seriously...

I do find it funny that we bounced perfectly off of $100b market cap though. Is there any truth to the $100b market cap meme? Did bitcoin require a $100b market cap to be listed on CME?

"SFYL" is their favorite expression.  You can be up 1000% and they will still say "sorry for your loss".  They are a bunch of bitter losers who missed out on the crypto gold rush.

There are many outright morons in that sub, but of course still good to have a different perspective from some of the posts that are less unreasonable.
That's one of the more annoying things about r/Buttcoin tbh, they don't understand the trading side of things.

Like I understand the reasons why most wont trade it (risk adverse, don't trust exchanges, too manipulated etc.) but the annoying thing is they wont acknowledge why people would trade BTC/altcoins in the first place. Its pretty clear that this is the most volatile asset class on the planet right now so the incentive is clearly there and for some people who can pull off a consistent trading strategy it just makes sense to try and play it, Most people on r/Buttcoin don't understand this.

That being said, I still hang there frequently and shitpost from time to time, I try to be informative when trading talk comes up, although most of the time it falls of deaf ears. I hope that some of the other people in that sub change their mindset in the future.
Yeah, snagged one. 

!short XBTU18 6284 5x 10%
Oh man, I almost had a really bad time. I had entries in from 6284-6390 (on september), but I had a de-risking stop in at 6311 from my previous short that I forgot to cancel. Luckily Sept topped at 6294 for now and I noticed. Aye yi, amateur hour. 
I'm already short. My average on Sept is around 6260, so on spot it should be equivalent to >6300. I meant I could double my position here at 6200 (on sept) and take a 6230 entry (around 6290ish spot), or I could wait for more air. 
yes, those hidden buy walls are a signal to me that we'll start pushing up soon
I keep my stop losses very tight in this market, so it does happen from time to time. 

But I'd rather get stopped out and eat half a percent loss/lock in tiny profit vs getting caught in a big move down. In this market, the moves down tend to be massive, so if it breaks down, the 4-5% stop losses still gets hit. 

So I can get stopped out 10 times before my losses would match a single "safe" stop loss getting triggered
Futures have no funding fees, but market sentiment is built into pricing. Yesterday when spot dropped to 5755, futures went to 5622, or about 2.5% under spot. After the bounce, the "discount" recovered to about 1%, where it is now. If we drop below $6K again, I'll likely benefit from an increase in the discount again. In other words, when I opened:

$6200 spot = $6140  

On a breakdown of $5800:  

$5750 spot = $5600 futures (estimated)  

Spot price has fallen $450, futures price has fallen $540, so I've done 2% better by shorting futures rather than spot.  

Now, if we fly upwards, that discount might disappear entirely or even flip to a premium, in which case I've lost more than I would have if I'd shorted spot.
I can't handle this nonsense, I'm going to Ripple.
Read his comment again 
maybe I am misremembering. Didn't he basically say "don't be surprised if prices go back to shit and we endure another bear market"?

Or was that later on?

Maybe you're right. Either way, people should have listened to him

Why did he even feel the need to announce it then?
Is the consensus that people are looking for a double bottom at 5400 now? Shouldn't we be looking at 5K since 5400 has been tested once and 5K is a previous ATH with weekly support just below (4650). Don't you think if we go down to say 4.4(bypassing 4.65 say for panic) and 5 is more likely than 5400+? Genuinely curious because everyone seems to be concentrating on 5.4 but my eventual target has been 5K for about a 7 months now.
Breaking down from a large wedge is generally violent.

On top of the large amount of longs open + failure to break up + if 6k is broken i expect it to go lower


Also, you tend to just say things without any backup to your arguments. So you have no right to say “ because you said so” because that’s what you live by
>  Because you say so?

Yes of course.  He is so sure, because he has magical powers to see the future with certainty.  Many who post in this sub do...although they still manage to lose money on trades..quite remarkable.
Well the 2014 bear market ended with a capitulation down under $200 which bounced back 100% immediately and *then* we went sideways for a year and up. I'm not saying  that a capitulation will immediately lead to a new bull, but it has to happen at some point for this bear market to end. I don't know what price it will be, it might not be much lower than now, but we need that high volume crash and immediate bounce.

And of course "the market" in many cases is the person who put up the wall...just buying or selling to themselves with wash trading.
I remember the one at 13. It's just I didn't see that big hidden wall that's actually not being pulled for a very long time.

There's just something that keeps bugging me. But NVM, I'll probably gonna keep looking for a bottom until I find it ;-)
I think there's low probability that an efficient quantum proof algorithm will be found in the next decade. I'm not sure the market is demanding one exist.

I'm not sure what properties you expect bitcoin to have related to this, or why it matters.

Anonymity will be broken. I'm not suggesting tokens will be created.
This. Monero is down 22.1% over the last 30 days vs Bitcoin's 16.6%. That's after their 8% bounce today.

because people hate change, it's very human of us
Then will it go down?
.....pretty sure they can if they choose to. 
agree. deleted.creepy ramifications. better focus on the invisible flags
> maybe some of them just don't make enough money to save for e.g. a new washer, new car, own condo or whatever they like in their life... so then they will probably cash out at least a part.

There's always going to be a few outliers, sure. It would be absurd to suggest that not one single person will sell any of their BTC. That doesn't mean it will happen in any significant amount.

> others could be rich and don't like this big volatility and buy stocks/indices to have a chill life.

This is completely missing the point. You're making assumptions about the motivations of the extreme early adopters.
Trading BTC/BTC is confusing. 0.3x position, 1.3x net.
I figure it'll take a while :) just seems fun 
If they wanted USD then they would send the USDT to one of the depository banks wouldn't they ? 
The 100M is being sent from the address the 250M was just printed to. Safe to assume they haven't acquired 250M to just sell 100M.
What is quarantined tether?
Are there lots of people converting to other fiat currencies? Or is it easier to acquire btc
I don't know how much you put in, but I hear you - I experienced anxiety for few months (the cycles were shorter then, with less people)

I can't really give advice, but back then when I was really into BTC tech (pre Segwit), I trusted that it would eventually go up. I also realized I put in way more than I could afford (just graduated, shitty job).. that was a good lesson.
only if you value stability over security.

life is not stable. that's imo one of the big flaws of the current financial system. having competing currencies will have net stabilizing effects over the long run.

if i want to use a stable coin i rather use cash, which is anonymous.
Wealthy people don't keep their wealth in fiat. They own property, equities, bonds, precious metals and other commodities.
Yea, I have a feeling a large portion of them got liquidated/sold the bottom or something. Some of them are clearly unemotional and just simply do not believe in the tech which is fine and that's why I visit. But others are clearly obsessed with "manipulation" and stuff like that.

Which, of course, I'm sure there is, but they seem to have a pretty "you're completely fucked no matter what" stance on crypto most of the time and it's kinda obnoxious.

Like I get it...but some of them just take it too far
Some missed out, some cashed in, some intentionally avoided it because they saw it as a joke.

Also I personally see the "Lol you missed the boat and you're all just salty losers" talk as a cheap way of deflecting the still very relevant criticisms of Bitcoin which r/Buttcoin has thrown at Bitcoin for years. 

I also wouldn't call them morons, there are some pretty smart people on there (ones who understand the tech more than most in this sub) however have overtime in response to the craziness of BTC taken on a stubborn cynical approach which comes off the wrong way.

Anyways me coming in here and writing this response probably wont make a difference to how you think, I mean the r/BitcoinMarkets Vs r/Buttcoin rivalry is as old Bitcoin itself, I just hope I can chime in some perspective :)

eh I wouldn't waste time on em. I'm sure most of them got liquidated or just give 0 shits about ever touching BTC. Can't really blame em, it's a pretty risky asset to put money into.

Some people are just super risk averse, and that's okay
Right, that makes sense. I mean clearly you have good stops, they're just on the verge of *too tight* and *perfect*. 
Ooh ok, thanks! 
Good luck with Ripple Inc.
he's saying you could watch someone, supposedly from wall street, buy a bunch of bitcoin and follow his trade and then cash out after letting it double.

I'm assuming he basically meant the trends were very obvious and distinct back then...which isn't particularly hard to believe considering it was pretty illiquid and generally just moving up all the time 
Yeah he wrote some stuff about how prices could tank again yadda yadda but it's not like he was telling people, 'guys take profits, market is too bubbly' or anything even remotely like that. 
> double bottom at 5400, 5400 has been tested once

Hmm not sure what you are talking about?  I see lows around 5.75

Heh, last *november*, around 10k fever, I wrote in my notebook "bitcoin will correct to 5k", so I feel you on that one ;)

If this starts to go down, if I do my normal thing, I'll probably put profit taking orders for 50% total of the position every hundred or so starting from 5.7, down to 5.  I don't like trying to call tops/bottoms so precisely, particularly if parabolic price action is involved.  Guess if we do go down I should just go ahead and allocate the whole position in profit ladders down to 4k in case there is a wick to be caught.
It must be extremely frustrating for you. My sympathies.
Literally any of the recent 10%+ dump days would fit the narrative of a 'capitulation' dump to establish a new bottom to crawl along and we wouldn't even know it before getting back into 5 digits. It takes a massively larger amount of money to move the price even 1% now than it did back then, we're just not going to see 100%+ flash crashes on Bitcoin again, unless / until it goes into absolute dumpster and all the serious traders / market makers give up on it and move on to trading harvested baby brains or some other rat poison. 

The idea that some kind of a huge capitulation 'has' to happen is ridiculous, plenty of post-bubble corrections have managed to turn around without one, more commonly than not in emerging tech fields, as retail gets disillusioned and slowly gets out, while more dedicated investors are continuing to build their positions. 
[removed]
Yup, edited that in a bit before you commented, I really wouldn't doubt most of that is wash trading to inspire confidence in people. I know people like to avoid thinking like that but like I said, more often than not I see those huge hidden walls be wrong 
> There's just something that keeps bugging me.

What's that?

and yea I mean this could be the bottom, I obviously personally do not think so. think this is starting to trend and people are too used to ranging between overbought and oversold. seems like everyone expects a bounce "because it just has to" at some point. I mean yes, it generally will, but from what I've seen it happens later than everyone expects it to. Like, right when people stop expecting it 

"this has to X at some point" seen this a few times the past few days. usually this is when there's one last leg down/up
A little knowledge sure is a dangerous thing. 
I don’t think you understand what you’re talking about. 


Tainting and fungibility issues are serious. Bitcoin can be tainted. 

Are you an applied cryptographer?

How do you propose that prime factorisation in a quantum context (which is probabilistic) will erode anonymity as implemented in RingCT/Stealth addressing/RingSigs?
Then why would it finally click?

I have no idea what the purpose of sending that 100M back would be if it's not to cash out... maybe they just want Bitfinex to hold on to it until they plan to use it?
Tether that has been proven destroyed.
It's illegal to carry or trade more than 5000 USD or equivalent of other foreign currencies. The government crackdown on fiat market aggravated the situation. Now USD is "smuggled" inside Iran through borders such as Iraq and Afghanistan. And there is rampant forgeries. BTC is much more easier and safer to acquire compared to these. For the younger generation and the tech savvy, crypto hedging is becoming a very attractive option. Shit is starting to hit the fan in Iran and therefore in the Middle East and the world. Expect a ripple effect soon in every economy in the world, if things continue down this road.

I thought that's basically exactly what he did :P I swear I remember him saying something crazy like "LTC could go back to $30" or something and people were like "lolwat" 
It wouldn't even be a double bottom I guess. 5.4 is from the 8K correction right before we went to 20K. I'm just saying that shouldn't 5.4 be comparatively weak in comparison to 5 which has additional strong support 5% down and is untested support.

Maybe it's just people trying to catch a falling knife and be one step ahead again... I'm not playing that game here got cut too many times last year.
It's not like I've done nothing while waiting for that number, I've traded in between but that's the number where I think the market makes a longer term decision. That's the target for my short right now which is from the 9Ks (well lower because I've added).
[removed]
A lot of people expected reversal at 25, that's why a lot didn't believe in drop. This may be the same.

You know that there were many times that I actually hoped for reversal or traded in case of reversal. Hard to explain what I feel now. This is just one of those feelings that I usually don't trade and regret it later. Worth a shot. Been wrong so many times that one more won't kill me :-P
Have you turned your chart upside down to check your bias? There's an awful lot of room beneath us. 
I think you're focused on a solution to a non problem that is irrelevant because after you've shown that there is no way to objectively prove anonymity, you still have to deal with remaining environmental data that can be used to observe the flow of funds. 

You can trace cash, but you can't observe its transactions. Instead of following the value of currency discretely one observes the overall system. Analyzing large seemingly random systems is where quantum analysis shines.
You're saying that fungibility is an issue that matters, that "taint" matters, and I don't know why. I simply don't care about those properties and I don't know why the market should care.

I'm saying quantum modeling will produce algorithms that make transaction obfuscation irrelevant. I'm not saying that RingCT will be broken. You brought up RingCT which changes what I'm talking about. It is possible that some method will evolve that compromises RingCT, it's just much less likely to happen.

I'm saying that obfuscating transactions doesn't matter. It will all be proven pseudo anonymous eventually (likely using methods that don't directly attack the chain or it's implementation directly), and probably in the next decade.

I'll take that "I have no reasonable arguments for my position"
I'm thinking about doubling here and bail if 6250 falls, but not convinced that much.
Thing is, don't blame it on tether and whatnot. Zoom out, we have a 1D bull div on the 1D, are extremely far from the 1D 200 ma, and had no retrace at all from 10 to 5.8, buyers stepped in we have a 1D pin bar candle, not a good place to short imo.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/Ewp6L9vR
I'm either about to get some of my profits rekted or watch this thingy really make me some money.

I'm justifying this based on a few things. We broke down from the consolidation triangle and are finally making new lows. This is not in any way bullish- there is no "need" for a retrace since we've spent time in every single one of these "zones" so far. There is no necessary price discovery from $6-12k anymore, we've done it all.

Secondly:

> The speculator's chief enemies are always boring from within. It is inseparable from human nature to hope and to fear. In speculation when the market goes against you you hope that every day will be the last day and you lose more than you should had you not listened to hope to the same ally that is so potent a success-bringer to empire builders and pioneers, big and little. And when the market goes your way you become fearful that the next day will take away your profit, and you get out too soon. Fear keeps you from making as much money as you ought to. The successful trader has to fight these two deep-seated instincts. He has to reverse what you might call his natural impulses. Instead of hoping he must fear; instead of fearing he must hope. He must fear that his loss may develop into a much bigger loss, and hope that his profit may become a big profit. It is absolutely wrong to gamble in stocks the way the average man does.

It's possible the market is finally continuing its downward trend and people are going to get rekt thinking that this is still ranging/consolidation instead of trending
Sounds incredibly fun 8) I don't think I have a genius IQ or anything but I am decently smart. can read people like a book generally

Tether Limited has a bank account which will receive and send fiat currency to users who
purchase/redeem tethers directly with us.  

page 9.  

Step 2:​
 ­ Tether Limited generates and credits the user's tether account. 

page 7.


So users (not just exchanges) can deposit USD and then get Tether issued directly to them it appears. The same thing in reverse when redeeming.
Huh ? Somebody deposited 250M USD and bought 250M worth of USD with it. Now they are sending 100M of it to BFX, presumably to buy BTC. Are you suggesting that they will then send that BTC to another exchange and cash it out ? What would be the point of that ?

Im not sure what the Bitfinex wallet is used for exactly so not sure. Maybe they can trade with the tether from there.
Yea, been needing to read more about it lately. Thanks for taking the time to explain it to me.

Sounds like shit's a mess over there. I hope things are okay and wish you the best, brother! I'm glad you have BTC at least to escape from your shitcoin IRR :P

Do your thing, I don't want to scare anyone out of a long. Like I said, I am trying to aggressively trade what I think will be the strongest part of the downtrend. I can't blame anyone for not wanting to short here or something

Wait what do you mean 25?
of course I have :) I've been checking my bias for the past 4 months :P

and I understand I could be wrong. I am going for a pretty aggressive trade, my prediction is that this is beginning to trend finally. It seems like most have forgotten about the large consolidation triangle. 

I am keeping in mind what happened the last time we broke down from a large symmetrical triangle:

You could argue that this is the "fakeout" downwards before upwards movement just like there was a fakeout upwards. But I remember that "Breakout". it was finex pushing to $12.2k with gdax at $11.6k...during that tether FUD. It was a completely impotent "breakout" and nothing at all like the intensity with which we've seen the market break down recently, although this breakdown hasn't exactly been extremely swift/intense

People like to trade on shorter time frames but I am not going for a 10% bounce, I'm going for the mofuckin slam dunk man. I wouldn't even be too phased if this went to $6600-6700, really, although I might close some for a better entry or something.

But who knows, maybe I'll learn a lesson in being stubborn about sticking too diligently to my targets ($4.5, $5, and $5.5k)

I don’t know what to say. I cannot believe you think that Bitcoin doesn’t need fungibility. 

There is no point debating more complex topics. 
Very convincing. 
Heh, I actually doubled short just few minutes ago. Sitting about $20 below my entry right now, hovering over the market close button. 
While I am a fan of technical indicators, I don't think they're enough to reverse the market. Bounce, sure, and we did just bounce 10% (5750-6325). Nothing else has changed. I also disagree that we've had no retrace from 10 to 5.8. We went 10 > 9.1 > 9.4 > 8.2 > 8.8 > 7.1 > 7.8 > 6.1 > 6.8 > 5.7 > 6.3. That's all *sorts* of retracing, but also a very clear trend. If we break 6500, I'll be getting out of the way (15% "bounce" may not be a bounce after all), but I think we had a strong technical bounce yesterday that was about to peter out when the tether pump happened. I think this extra leg up is nothing more than a gift to shorters and an ugly bull trap, but I could be wrong.

I'm not leveraged out the wazoo or anything either. I'm 5x with 35% of my account, or 1.65x. Keeping in mind that 1x on MEX is basically fiat, I'm only lightly effective short.
You need a decent (and maybe paid?) fortune-telling sub then. "A decently smart guy will read you like a book" ...and save all of your problems! Whaaaaat? ;-P
You would be good at it, Sloppy. It has a lot of similarities with trading - 90% of the battle is with yourself, managing emotions, understanding risk management, and accepting that variance is very real and can be absolutely brutal. You can be unlucky for longer than you’d expect possible in poker, and during that run you’ll be fighting a constant battle against an inner voice telling you you’re doing something wrong, and to change your methods - those who can win these inner battles will profit over those who can’t. Just like trading.

I was nicely profitable at lower stakes and I’m far from a genius, and it took me under a year to get there. Tracking software will improve your ROI but is not necessary at lower stakes.
game selection then.  at the highest stake tables i knew the regulars and we all tried to be 'normal'.  But private conversation would always reveal perfect SATs, math PHDs, child chess prodigies.  Plenty of room to run in lower stakes live.




It looks like that's not happening in practice (yet?).
Yeah, it's confusing.

Now I'm speculating that it's an arbitrage bot and they're just being sloppy with the setup... 100M of slop. weird.
You can't trade with tether at Bitfinex. It's treated exactly like USD. So, the USDT goes in and becomes USD immediately available for withdrawal or trading as USD. Maybe they're setting up a scheme for arbitrage with Bitfinex and they're sloppy about it? Really strange.

You'd think you'd see a lot more quarantined Tether in the balance sheet, but they almost certainly manage all internal transactions using a private database that has access to a hot wallet. The fact that you don't see more quarantined tether is an indication that liquidity of CC markets hasn't dropped during this bear market. I can't look at this without thinking it's very bullish.
Yes it's a mess, more like a gundpowder warehouse ready to explode, and there are lots of sparks! Thank you dude, I hope things work out in the end for everyone.
This is the current use case that is lost on so many first world redditors, glad to see you’re not one of them, bud. 
I don’t know😩
He tweeted something about it. I'll have to find it later - I promise you he said something about us enduring a bear market and going back to really low prices in Jan-Feb. It may have been *after* the dump though.

also:

>Fun fact: I have more LTC than the founder of litecoin

Lol
What I'm trying to explain to you is 

1) I AM open minded. Always. I open to hearing any argument and change my stance on Bitcoin or anything else.

2) Ripple does **not**, as far as I can tell, have a viable economic model. You're talking about liquidity pools and such, but you haven't actually demonstrated why XRP itself should have **rent seeking** properties. The claims your making, so far as I can tell, don't hold up to basic economic scrutiny. It simply doesn't make sense when you add up all the pieces. 

All such economic rent is unsustainable in the world of open source protocols. All of this will be out-competed by other systems, centralized or decentralized. Network velocities will approach infinity and friction costs will approach zero. The only exception to this rule is SoV.

This is written about at some length [here](https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/john-pfeffer/An+Investor%27s+Take+on+Cryptoassets+v6.pdf). FWIW.

Don't believe the shitcoin hype.


25k. A lot of people thought that will be the top, when we bounced off 20k still a lot of people waited for 25 ;-)

I'll go short if 6k falls again. Gonna lose nice entry here...
[deleted]
I like to look at the line chart sometimes, because it shows marginally lower lows every time we dumped on higher timeframes , so it is kind of trending. We just made a new low and many time based indicators are showing that it's time for a reversal, psychologically it's also getting time for a short lived FOMO moment to crush some more illusions. 8 Weeks straight down, that's brutal. Sooner than later you'll get mean reversion and set another clear lower high before downward continuation.

We are dropping faster than 2014 and that also had a very quick FOMO bounce relative to where we are and that got slapped down hard eventually. 

https://www.coinigy.com/s/i/5b3150847d469/ 
Also about 8 weeks downtrend here. 

Nothing wrong with being aggressive :D I've 8x my entire stack in two weeks and I know have a godlike x25 long entry on September futures wicks and been taking profit and re longing on these very predictable dumps (and shorting the pumps just to be sure). I'm way too active to be able to sit on my hands for weeks with no trading lol. 

Market is showing the first signs of real strength in a long time for me and the way the previous weekly close is setup, combined with how our 3D close will likely be, so close to a monthly close is nice MM chart painting. Couldn't do it better myself. 

https://www.coinigy.com/s/i/5b31517313954/
https://www.coinigy.com/s/i/5b3151e62d08d/

It also dropped right to where I expected this to go: https://www.coinigy.com/s/i/5b31519f7a965/

Really impressive example. 

btw, your targets are not aggressive. By no means. Taking in consideration that large triangle spans ~$5k, and and exit point was around $7k, the target of breakdown is somewhere ~$2k. 


u/yolotrades would be proud of you, he almost talked me into the most profitable long of my life last year, but I was too new (and lacking some balls) to do it.

Just remember, in this crazy news driven cycle, would could happen if, huge if, some golden swan event came up, how much fomo could happen and how much of your profit could get eaten up. Only you know man. But I admire your conviction. Good luck!
Bitcoin has fungibility. Individual units are essentially interchangeable. I don't know how you argue that 1 BTC is not equal to 1BTC.

There are some added properties around fungibility like "taint" that seem to matter to you, and I don't know what all those are or why they matter.
!short XBTU18 add 25% 6260
Don't ask me. I'd rather sacrifice some profit trying to catch the bottom even with small entry than wait until it'll be clear.

I may be wrong here.
I'm not talking about that kind of retrace, more like 20-6 -> 11.7, and 11.7-6.3 -> 10.

10-5.8 -> 7.8?

Weekly chart

Doesn't seem to have a lot of steam tho for now
Hahahaha I'm not even sure what you mean by this but I'm laughing.  Are you suggesting I make a subreddit and shill it by advertising that line? Lmao
Sounds really fun, I'll genuinely look into it. It sounds like I'd enjoy it a lot.

Thanks for the encouragement :) 
sounds fun, you make any decent money off it?

so you're telling me you're a real genius? :P
Any good reads, online, a book, or even a Reddit post that goes into the smarts and mindsets of this type of poker? Very interesting.
Hmm ? How can you tell that ? I presume you have to be accredited to do so, but groups other than exchanges are allowed.

Yea, it's interesting hearing about that. Makes me at least think about the usefulness from that perspective. While I'm  a bit skeptical that that many Iranians are just pouring money into bitcoin, I can definitely see why they would want to and why the ones who have access to it would
How can you say that using XRP over using USD 'doesn't hold up to basic economic scrutiny' with a straight face? It's both cheaper and more efficient. It has disadvantages and risk factors of its own, of course, but if correctly implemented, it's huge improvement over the status quo. It might not be the 'best' alternative -- but that might not matter for a long time if it gains a significant enough early adopter advantage.

It's also 2 am here so I'm going to bed instead of going through the same tired discussion about 'rent seeking' and the 'superiority' of SOV, but just a gentle reminder in closing, the guy you're quoting as some sort of an expert on the subject, is making McAfee level predictions on BTC price without even the added excitement of genital consumption. Pretty weak, if you ask me. 
the thing is, it was pretty obvious (well now that I'm more experienced) that the blow-off top was the $13k to $19.2k day on gdax. After that, any bounce/run-up should have been seen as a gift from god to get out/short.

I am expecting the opposite here- we will see an incredibly strong downtrend, a bounce, then meandering at the bottom with a weak push to even lower prices and then a recovery/mini bull run.
I think there will be a lot of people who disagree and if the move does happen like I expect it to- a lot of people will be in disbelief. We'll just have to see I guess.

If I'm wrong, oh well, I learn a lesson. Lose some potential profits. if I'm right then I am very right :D
Yea, I can't disagree with most of what you said. I'm still doing some thinking and I'm wavering between closing this all on a strong push past $6400 or just YOLO "fuck it"ing this and not closing until we break back above $7800 or something. 

For what it's worth, most good traders I'm watching seem to expect a relief rally/bounce here. 
Yes, it really is pretty "safe" considering the charting targets. I just like to factor in a little bit of "How ridiculous would this be?" into my targets. 

Really, I would not be surprised to see $3-4k within a few months, though. but if I say that around here, people start harassing me, they say I'm shilling/scaring people and start calling me a crashkid lol, so I avoid mentioning those as some of my longer term targets.

Plus, I'm trying to close some just to lock in profits. Don't want to sit on this one for too long and watch 50% of profits disappear.

I just want to see a capitulation dump- after that I will be happy to reduce size/go long. 
Yes I worry about that every day.. And then I remember the Livermore quote about how you have to fight the fear of losing your profits when the market moves in your direction (conversely, also fighting the hope of gaining back losses when underwater) 

Let's just say I hope I'll be awake if some magical news pops up :P 

I do worry that I'm getting  more bearish at the bottom.. But it's not like I'm adding. I'm just thinking it will continue to move down 
Because UTXOs can become dirty. 

WannaCry BTC is now worth less than clean BTC. 

People already pay to ensure BTC is from a coinbase Tx. 

Poisoning propagates.

We were consolidating on the weekly chart, narrowing our highs and lows. We broke out of that pattern, and we broke down. I'm not sure why we'd see a 50% retrace of the most bearish move the market has seen since 2014. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/boq40axP/
there is no real "need" to retrace when we've spent 5 months in this range and now broke down below it. We've retraced some of these price ranges 3-4 times now. 

At some point people learn and they do not need to be convinced that bitcoin should be that expensive and they don't need to be told again. 
I am just pulling your leg. Good job, though, you were supposed to have a laugh. ;)
I didn't have a perfect SAT, math PHD, or chess GM status, or true child prodigy, or an IQ over 150.

I made a lot of money and flushed it on one hand.  In the grand scheme, I don't think it was time well spent, because I had other options.

I spent hours coming up with a system like that years ago.  Before when people would just read super system or something, lol.  I had an enormous edge.  If that stuff is public knowledge now, thats scary.

I see a lot of people coming out with stuff, educating the sheep, in all areas, now.  Makes me mad. 




We should see a lot more tether being destroyed and created if it were a fully open and transparent market and people are withdrawing USD regularly.
> How can you say that using XRP over using USD 'doesn't hold up to basic economic scrutiny' with a straight face? 

How can you *not*? It's not money FFS. If its value is relegated to transactions and providing "liquidity pools" (which is ultimately denominated in actual currency like USD) then I don't see why it should have value superfluous of that. If its utility is its only value and its utility doesn't include SoV (and it doesn't), then why why why would its value not approach and equilibrium with the speed of its network and in a broader ecosystem of competing technologies.

The answer is, of course, it won't.

The one exception is actual money, regardless of whether you believe that or not. If Ripple is not attempting to be a form of digital reserve *money*, then its superfluous value will ultimately be driven to zero.

I wrote that all with a straight, somewhat inebriated, face.
I read that paper a couple weeks ago. One of the best texts I read on the possible future and economics of a global currency. His reason for giving such a high value is totally justified. You clearly misunderstood it if you think that rent seeking and store of value are meme words with no real meaning here. 
Everything is obvious after the fact ;-)

There's not much room to go down, there will be more and more people who will start to buy just to buy at those prices. I'm just saying that the strong down trend may be over and we'll hover around the bottom now.
This looks like a solution in search of a problem.

Ever heard of a blood diamond? Yeah, when you acquire funds illicitly they are devalued. You're saying that a property is a bug when it can just as easily be described as a feature, depending on the values you have when you evaluate it.

Why should the market care about taint? It seems to make the token even more rare.
Full bias. I haven't said the bottom is in, nor that we're bullish, but if you trade based on "people don't need" speaking for everyone it's shit.
For me high stakes multi day tournaments is where the magic happen. It bring me to such a focused state of mind that honestly I wouldn’t even know i can get there without Poker
Is that a pretty common thing lol
I didn't say people, I said certain accredited groups.

I honestly don't know how veterans saw $13k to $19.2k in one day and thought "this is sustainable"/"we are going higher".

It must have been all emotion. 

There's plenty of room to fall :P Like I said in another comment, keep in mind we broke down from the triangle- the largest pattern bitcoin has formed in probably years. I've actually never seen a larger pattern form. 

I don't doubt that anyone will be buying. It's just that I think more people will be selling. 
I see why you don’t think this is important now. 

Let's assume that a Bitcoin was used in a shady transaction (drugs, stolen goods, ...). When that coin lands in your wallet, it would be possible to look into the transaction history of that coin and detect that said shady transaction was carried out, so the Bitcoin that landed in your wallet is not equal anymore to a 'fresh' Bitcoin without transaction history. So that Bitcoin is now tainted... Now that Bitcoin/address could be blacklisted so it can't be used anymore.


This will hurt bitcoin users. 

Coinbase already would not let me sell Bitcoin that I inadvertently received that was tainted historically. 

Privacy is important.


Imagine trying to use your 50usd bill only to find out it’s being rejected by your local shop. 

You might think you can avoid this by carefully accepting inputs. That won’t work on a ubiquitous scale. 
>but if you trade based on "people don't need"

then why are you assuming we are going to retrace? Lol
flushing? yeah.  Everyone at the table was sitting with their entire bankroll in front of them.  3 pros were crushed that day.  Dumb, lacking judgement and self-control.





> I honestly don't know how veterans saw $13k to $19.2k in one day and thought "this is sustainable"/"we are going higher".
> 
> It must have been all emotion.

Yes, but keep in mind what people have been saying about the stock market, literally for years. Markets can stay irrational longer than we can stay solvent OR markets can be right even when we sure they are wrong.

Check out this [gem](http://time.com/money/5001194/stock-market-signs-tech-bubble-crash/) from October 2017, getting close to a year old. 

Some of my favorites about why the market is about to destroy us all again. "Over the longer term, things look even crazier. Shares of the streaming video company Netflix have soared 2,500% over the past five years, despite the fact that the company generated fewer profits last year than the comfort-food restaurant Cracker Barrel Old Country Store. The electric automaker Tesla has seen its stock soar nearly 1,500% since the early days of this bull market, despite still being profitless. And the online travel site Priceline is up more than 5,000% since late 2006."

Netflix since October of last year +200%
Tesla is about net even, not great but not taking down the market.
Priceline is up about 20%

Point is hindsight is hindsight and people will be quoting a ton of hindsight after the next major stock market correction. But it has been called for for years.
Do you understand how this comes off as condescending?

You just told me that I was too stupid to understand you;  provided a paragraph long illustration of what I've already shown I understand--tainted coins; and then proceed to tell me that your personal experience and values are the most valid and important using a personal anecdote.
I don't assume I contemplate the possibility with an open mind.
I meant is flushing it all on one hand a common thing.

Damn, tho. So you played professionally?
Yes but those aren't blow off tops, those are strong trends with people trying to call the top. It's more like people calling the top at $3k, $5k, $10k etc 

$13k to $19.2k in one day and $5.5k to $19.2k in a month are both absolutely bonkers and the melt up should have been worrisome for people 

For what it's worth, I called the ETH top the day it happened ($1440) and called the ripple top at about $3.00.. I wasn't into shorting back then so I didn't do anything about it.

but I wrote up a long comment on an alt account encouraging eth trader to take profits because I had already learned what a melt up felt and looked like. So if I, some dumb moon boy, could learn in a month then I don't get how some people here didn't learn :P


Not trying to be condescending.
there are possibilities for anything. You must have a reason to think it's going to retrace and I'm going to guess that reason eventually boils down to something like some people still think bitcoin is worth more than the current price but that it'll go down eventually.

what I'm saying is I don't think people need to get burned for the 5th time- I think most of those people have learned their lesson. 

Of course it's all speculation. But the basis behind your reasoning probably isn't far off from mine
No, but at high stakes there's always 1-2 pros at the table in the famous casinos.  Many world champions, famous businessmen, high ranking government people, actors, criminals, etc.





That blow off top was one exchange. Mex went to 50k when spot was at 7k. The 20k run was unsustainable but has anyone thought it'll bounce back to 5k again?

Every market is speculative. That triangle was huge but how many times BTC hits those targets?

We're trading, using TA to count our r/r and sometimes just go with gut or beliefs. A lot of people do that and we make money in crypto only by outsmarting others. Those who see it moon will end like those who see it go to 0, with not realized millions of profit going into huge loss.
If it trends then there will be a lot of people making "free money". People will be in disbelief in the opposite direction. 

Also it was Gdax *and* mex...mex $50k, Gdax $19.2k with bfx at $17.2k. 

it was an incredibly clear blow off top. when eth mooned a few weeks later it was super obvious to me that the exuberance was too much and it was melting up just like btc. Don't get how people go thru that and don't remember what it's like

Certainly it could reverse here but nothing about the price action is incredible or exuberant. We went 3% under 6 month low...there's a lot of room to move down if it does. if it doesn't, oh well, will meander for  bit 
Mex was actually different story. A lot of stop loses hit there.

The hype then was something like the selling now. Hard to say when exactly it'll end. Chewy was trying to short the run since 8k... Now we're more experienced.

It's not I'm disagreeing with you. It's just I think there's more money to make in next bull run than in shorting this (still made a ton on the way down), so I can take couple hits trying to long the bottom every 30% and still get it back if I fail.
