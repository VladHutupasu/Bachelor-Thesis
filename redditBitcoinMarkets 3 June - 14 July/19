Facebook lifts the ban on crypto ads (except ICO-s)

How much of the recent market weirdness is from EOS trying to keep their price afloat on the sinking burning EOS ship?  They are almost out of ETH to sell as far as I know.
I was looking at search data and found out there's a band called Moonmath that released their first album in December of 2017.

Which one of you jokers started a band last year?

Been here for 6 years.

I go numb when this happens. I don't sell, I just go numb.
Hi folks. Been a somewhat decent amount of time since I made a longform post, so here we go.

First, short(ish) term: [https://www.tradingview.com/i/vMLUJuKj/](https://www.tradingview.com/i/vMLUJuKj/)

In red is everyone's favorite meme triangle we broke down from, in blue is the log ATH descending resistance turned hopefully support, in yellow are bull divs and my target, and in light blue is a bear div at the most recent major local high.

Overall, I'm of the mind that the breakdown from the triangle was significant, especially as it was accompanied by an expansion of volume . See the green trendline - volume was trending heavily downwards and on break of that line we've had noticeably higher volume .

Looking back, you can also see that normal bull divs/bear divs have signified the local low/local high of the last couple trend reversals. If that holds up, we've just recently had another and I think it's fair to expect this one to somewhat play out as well. However, that triangle support will have likely turned into significant resistance; given that, I don't expect it this div to play out with nearly the strength of the other bull div. The blue line is just one I don't expect to ever fall below again; that's not really saying much though given the rate it's descending, while the upper meme triangle resistance is just the line I'll be watching if we \*DO\* break back through the former triangle support line.

On the very short term, notice (magenta arrow) the LVN around 6.3k. I think it's fair to expect this is showing the resistance we're current;y dealing with. LVNs are a place the price hasn't spent a significant amount of time, meaning it's a place of resistance we either get thrown back from quickly or, when we break it, we just really blow through it.

Verdict: Possibly a short term recovery (for the next \~1-2 weeks maybe?). Medium term (1-2 months?) I think we'll still be searching for more lower lows unless bitcoin does bitcoin things and just blows up; always a possibility. If you're shorting do it at resistance on the time frame you're trading and with smart stops.

Now let's go long term: [https://www.tradingview.com/i/krvW5wQA/](https://www.tradingview.com/i/krvW5wQA/) (Bitstamp as BFX chart wasn't useful in early 2014)

First, that cyan line? That's the meme triangle line, slightly adjusted given the time scale and greatly extended to show why I give it such a high importance - it extends all the way back to the ATH before the 2014 bear market. I've drawn red arrows where it was tested as resistance and then green arrows where we've found support from it. I expect it to return as resistance now.

Otherwise, I wanted to show what's happened previously when a long term parabolic advance gets violated (dotted yellow lines). Sample size is only N=1, but that's all we got. If we take the 2016 halvening as a significant event with a run-up beforehand as it begins getting priced in and pretend the 2020 one (green dotted line) will go similarly, we could possibly see something like the projected yellow dotted line.

I don't think it'll play out that way. Maybe the halvening gets priced in sooner or more accurately, resulting in a run-up sooner and muted bull market afterwards. Maybe it's already priced in. Who knows. The fact remains we've violated a parabolic advance and fallen below significant support - no two bear markets are ever exactly the same, but some form of rounded bottom wouldn't be surprising whether it bottoms at 1.5k, 2.5k, 4k, 5k, or even here at 6k.

I also really like u/jarederaj's observations on stability. I didn't go into it here as to not steal ideas or clutter the chart, but definitely check out his charts as well for long term views. (Edit: see his comment below)

Lastly, a note on my status. I'm using leverage now! Finally got around to verifying on Kraken, though I still hate the fees. My trading stack is \~33&#37; of my holdings. I opened a long at 6.125k, closed at a loss at 5.975k, and reopened the same long at 5.9k. Essentially making me long from 6.05k. Holding until break back below 6k on high volume or my target range on the daily, maybe taking some profit before then.

!long btcusd 6050 4X 100&#37;
Exiting my short here. Mostly just trade exhaustion, and I can't watch it for the rest of the day. 

edit to add: Not really based off indicators or charts, and probably premature. We are in a super long bull flag of sorts, but I still think we're going lower. Just going to be away for several hours and 6150 seems to be holding. Figure'd I'd take my 6% win (with leverage) and take a few hours away. 

edit 2: heh, watch us plummet to 6000 now.
I usually deal with logarithmic scale on long timeframes, but I ventured in the linear world today. 

Found out a not so unfamiliar formation that could cause fireworks in the next couple of days.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/SUhfQa6E/

I'm long biased.
Those stairs on 4h are looking unbelievable. Can't imagine how this won't end up with a big move soon.

Going to sleep, hope I won't get rekt.
I’m trying to build a strong bull narrative at the moment, but I’m failing.

The bounce at 6020 is looking weak and we’re on the path to invalidating the main bull case at the moment – the bull divergences on 12H and 1D charts. It hasn’t happened yet, and we might even end up _confirming_ bullishness with a new higher low on RSI, in which case I’m happy to reconsider things. But IMO it’s looking weak.

We’ve also broken below the high volume node at 6150 on the chart:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/ytDcJGJi/

If we invalidate the bull divs then even 5500 might not be as attractive as I initially thought for closing a short/hedge. I might just close 1/3 of my hedge in that case, depending on what things look like.
Btc formed a nice descending channel (looking at 4h), which, as I've regularly noticed, are tend to be broken upwards.

I'm a believer in 57XX bottom. Put almost all of my trading fiat in alts and planning to hold till btc will form a double top at 10K. 

Edit: the similarity to the previous short cycle is so similar that it hurts https://imgur.com/a/oBopW7o, so i'd stopped saying "market doesn't repeat itself" because it clearly does. The reason behind 10K double top is the similarity to 2014, thats how it played out back then, and chances are it will repeat itself again. Wouldn't think the bear market will last for as long though.
Tether is now on place 9!
Alts bleeding and didn't recover as much as they did in the past.. I don't know I feel this is bearish but so many people go long here.. why ? 
Have we ever seen such a "perfect" staircase pattern in recent times like the last 7 candles on the 4h? I tried to check the charts but could not find similiar market behaviour.
ahhh this is the BTC I love
Binancians are still locked out, maintenance 3 hours longer than the 4 hours scheduled.

Funds are safu.

But yeah.

Edit: and we're back.
Sorry guys, we are fucked, can't see 6k holding... everything points to more down, if not today very soon. But then, Bitcoin is tricky so who knows!  I usually don't trade but I'm gonna do something stupid and sell 12btc @ 6070 to pick them back up at 5K. Inb4 REKT
Time for my daily dose of TA bullshit

- For the first time since 10th October 2016, we are now sitting inside the weekly Ichimoku Cloud - http://imgur.com/ymqEgA6
Now this is shit or bust time for me. Should be break firmly under it, it's the first time since August 2014 that we'd have done so. No way to sugarcoat that i'm afraid.

Looking at the way the cloud is formed in terms of shape, it all but inevitable that we'll be under it next week. So take that however you want to. Top of the weekly is currently at 10750, so that's the number we need to break above again.

- We are now currently sitting just under the 2 hour and 4 hour Kijun lines on the Ichimoku Cloud. Both appear to be forming decent resistance for us at the moment. The Kijuns are sitting at 6294 (4hour) and 6272 (2hour).
http://imgur.com/8cKIJKl - 4 hour

- We are sitting in the 1 hour cloud with the top of the cloud also sitting at the same area, a price of 6285. All three of these are pretty damn good resistance, it would be very nice in the short term if we could finally get strongly into the 6300s and break through.
http://imgur.com/CzK7Vdq - 1 hour

- In terms of downward targets, I'm currently looking at the 1st target around 5300 (Binance) in and around the 1st week of July. This is the meeting point of out original ATH trend line down and our support line from 12th November/25th October 
http://imgur.com/0gOfOrg

I'm also looking at the 2nd target should that break at around 4900, in and around 2nd week of July. This is the meeting point of the ATH line and the, what I believe to be the start of the insane bubble run on 12th October.

- The daily Wavetrend is now crossing positive from a pretty low position, this could signal some short term upside or at the least some sideways action, 4 hour wavetrend is firmly aiming up so this could be a prelude to a positive daily 

- Daily RSI continues to make lower highs and currently...higher lows. If RSI reaches about 40, it would mean we would have broken out of our downward RSI trend which started on 24th April

- 4 hour MACD is just beginning to slow as it were, with the daily completely intertwined.. so no real trend to show there at all

- 2 hour MACD is now aiming for a cross to the negative with the 1 hour already crossed negative. Simply following that we should be watching for the 2 hour to cross within the next 4 to 6 hours best guess but of course that's really just a shot in the dark

$$$Finally for the sake of being positive. End of the bear market to me would be a break above the daily Ichimoku Cloud currently sitting at 8900... This would also see us smash through the ATH high trend. 


[deleted]
so I'm thinking with all these hidden buy walls and random spikes up/down that we are due for a relief rally pretty soon...probably to about $8,500 or so over the next month or two.

we've been going down without any rallies since May 6th, so kinda due for one. then this will decide if it decides to turn bullish or if it'll go back down again. 

now this will might still go down from here over the next day or two, maybe $5,900, mabye $5,450, maybe $4,950...but personally I've decided to hold here, so I'm removing my stop losses and going to ride this thing out from here. 
Is there any funny business to watch out for at BitMEX contract expiration?  I've been using the platform for some time, but I've never actually held anything to expiration before -- and never bothered to pay much attention to the little details.   

I have a nice short position in the money on Cardano June Futures that I'm thinking I might just let ride the 3 days till contract expiration so I can get it closed at spot price for no fees.  Is there any reason to believe that the contract expiration actually affects the underlying price one way or another during the 30 minute close window?
Somewhat unorthodox I guess but I'm watching this right now...
http://imgur.com/qGuuR2S

granted we fell through the support line before but after breaking back up through it, we have touched it again as support.

Whether that holds who knows, doubt it to be honest. 

We did just fail to break up again out of the downtrend line...that makes 5 attempts to break it since yesterday. Granted it's not a long chart structure as it were, we really do seem to be lacking some buying strength of any kind at the moment. So I guess now i've said that it's time for the upward Bart 
big hidden buy wall on bfx absorbing a lot of sells but I doubt it'll last
Volume profile shows very little volume traded in the 4700-5500 range. If we drop below 5500, 47XX may be absolute bottom. Long BTC but interest in BTC has dropped to last summer levels, not surprised to see this market correction/gap fill. Should start a bull run to new highs once we hit bottom. I dont think we see bottom till around Mid july. Will be interesting too if tariffs go into effect on july 6 and we do have a trade war. Might help BTC more too.
I’m actually trading a BART setup back to the 6750-6800 range on the 1D...I’ve gone full retard.  
Like clockwork Asia provide us some FUD from their endless supply: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exchange-leak-puts-620k-worth-060021445.html?.tsrc=applewf&guccounter=1

Edit: The weekly Asia FUD is getting weak though 
[That's ](https://i.imgur.com/pwP63KS.jpg) good news for... Canadian!
Wake me up for the inevitable retest of 10k please
I frequently hear 'I'll diversify into crypto once it stabilizes.'

What such folks are surprise to hear: 

Amazon lost 94% of its market cap from December 1999 to October 2001. Yes, ~94%.

Bezos' net worth went with it.

Volatility is not unique to crypto.

What is unique:

'Pure' playgound for economic mechanisms, easy of testing & deploying permissionlessly, new class of applications, more financially-aligned global dev brainpower around value provision than ever imaginable.

Long term, capital flows toward freedom.


Looks like some whales are having some fun
The market looks like its sitting on the edge of a cliff. I think Bitcoin is about to go through what Litecoin Justwent through.
Alts are dumping... guess r/cryptocurrency is getting their wish, alts are decoupling from BTC.
This volatility today has me 100% confused, looks like it could break into either direction & be a fake out. Sitting out with no regrets.
I was gonna buy this at 6100, but that fake pump to 6261 (short fill, I presume) is very alarming
Down we go again 
Could see a small bounce on ETH at $420 (currently $426) where it bounced earlier as it coincides with $6k BTC

edit: on the other hand, the ratio is also riding 2 month old support at .07...if the ratio breaks as ETH breaks $420 AND BTC breaks $6k, could see a sell off to retest $360 ETH from March as our next big support level. With a .065-.069 ratio that would be at ~$5.2-5.5k 
Throwaway for obvious reasons and, of course, the following is 100&#37; my opinion.

Some background on me: I am currently a senior software engineer at a well-known company in SF Bay Area. I first learned about Bitcoin in late 2012 and it was love at first read.

I've since watched the price go from $12 --> $260 --> $50 --> $1200 --> $180 --> $20k --> ???? in what can only be described as the most thrilling, horrifying, terrifying, amazing experience of my life.

In times like this, I like to ask myself the following questions to put things in perspective and remind myself of the original reason I got on this wild ride:

\- Is the BTC protocol broken?  
\- Has a vulnerability been uncovered in SHA-256 ?  
\- Does 1+1 != 2 (ie: Is math broken)?  
\- Is the original whitepaper no longer applicable; has Bitcoin morphed into something else entirely?

As long as none of these answers are "Yes", then nothing has changed and I will continue to HODL. I am a proud member of the "21-Club" (will sign messages as proof) and plan to continue to be so for a long, long time.

I believe Bitcoin will change the world. I did in 2012 and I believe it more and more every day.
I still think we will go much lower, the weekly bbands just started to expand to the downside.

Thats something i wasnt expecting checking cmc right now, ETH nearly at the volume of BTC?  

Looking pretty similar as the drop from $6.7k
Most impactful developments you foresee increasing BTC [& ETH] liquidity* over the 2nd half of 2018?

It's about as cumbersome & daunting now as ever entering fiat->crypto in Canada for instance. 
Someone seems to be trying the absurd 15m bart up and down on ETH/BTC this time lol
* BTC price went down and is stable at a range again
* Longs went up while shorts went down
* Alts are continuing to tank in the ratio while BTC is stable at the 6000 to 6100 range

Yeah Im feeling bearish. Its like whales are just trying to keep BTC stable as usual while they unload their alts to BTC then tether up afterwards.
Stated yesterday that if we stay 6+ hours above the 6200 I will add.

This morning I added some Juicy BTC's. Thanks. 

Have them / added them on my ledger - long term - let's see.
What a joke this market has become.
I went ahead and re-hedged here. 

!short XBTUSD 6185 2x 50%

I am actually on swaps this time. I'll flip to futures on a breakdown of 6000. I'm happy to see BTC's market dominance increasing, but I don't think alt wreckage will lead to an immediate BTC spike. 

Let's see how this goes. 
it'd be really funny if we don't break 6k.  traders would be confused
I think im gonna do something similar to u/wearingpajamas . 

Seems like alts are finding support after their bounce back from BTC low, im seriously considering going heavy on alts with stops at their lows from the weekend.

Im not getting married to these alts, i dont give a fuck about any of them, just want to flip them for more BTC.

Thoughts?
I never forget the words: " *We will regulate, make bitcoin not wild, nor wilder. We'll* ***tame*** *it into a regular type instrument of trade with rules."*

Ballsy old dude but he did what he said - respect!

Welcome to tamed Bitcoin, my friends.
Just found out i had a stop loss buy on ETH forgotten @470 for 80% stack that got filled... 

This one is going to destroy my stack... My bad trades weren't enough that i had to mess up even more...



Shorters are thinking - this is the big short until 5.2 or sub 5

Longers are thinking - 6000 is the local bottom, let's now proceed to at least bottom of the triangle aka 7-7.1K

Easier resolution could be to meet midway, but, no one fucking wants to listen..
[deleted]
Think the goal is to close the daily in 4 minutes below 6K.. let's see
Bitwise Investments...wonder how long before they're forced to shutdown and return investor money..at least what's left... Once their liquidity dries up and their fee income can't support their operations, they'll have no choice but to close the fund.
If you look at the volume bars for BTC/USD Bitfinex on BitcoinWisdom.com......the volume amounts don't seem to match Bitfinex's actual volume over the last couple of days... does anyone else see this?
Poll time: Have we seen the bottom?

Been through MtGox and 2013-2015 bear market and this one honestly feels like the shittiest. Maybe because stakes are higher. I don't know. Fuck dis shit, I'll be hodling. Even though I honestly think Tether will blow up at some point.
Do you guys have a set goal for the amount of BTC you want to accumulate before you stop trading?

From a realistic standpoint what’s a realistic amount of BTC you would like to achieve from trading and put in cold storage?

My goal is 5 BitCorns 
Alts are crashing even bigger ones like BCash and ethereum. Bitcoin is holding up somehow tho
This dump started after the Mt Gox news came out saying people shouldn't be worried now that he can't sell anymore.

Looks like good news is driving liquidity in to the market then dumping on them.

It's not just FUD that causes the market to dump.

ETH/BTC ratio made new lows for June and approaching its May 1st bottom at .0706. Next horizontal support not til .066 which goes back to late April
it almost seems too easy to just counter trade these random sideways -> pump/dump movements.

Yetserday it was sideways...then dump to $6060 then pump to $6350...now sideways -> $6250 -> complete rejection. o_O

I guess you have like a 30 second window, though, so not much time to actually place an order

Margin longs are in pain for a some time already, shorts have celebrations almost every day. This week longs are added at this level, shorts are declining in number. To me this looks like bulls are confident that this is the bottom, and bears are cautious - as it might actually be the bottom. 
[deleted]
This is the bottom. There, I said it.
Historical snapshot time again. On 10/22/17, BTC was priced at $5933. Total market cap now is $244b, on that same date in 10/17, market cap was $170b. XRP is STILL 2.5x from that date. Cardano is 6x from that date. Still some purging required, me thinks.

Interesting side note, Tether was $437 million, now $2.7 billion.
Anyone have any idea of why this exchange has so much USDT volume? (check USDT pairs) [https://www.bit-z.com/](https://www.bit-z.com/)

It's a lot higher than bifinex. Wash trading?

EDIT: It might be important to notice it pumped to 6500 USDT/BTC in that exchange with the tether print of yesterday.

Bought 4k at 15k. Held through 20. Now that I'm down 2500 or so I'll just hold through the end of this year and see what happens. Cheers.
Looks like Japan may change its crypto tax: [https://news.bitcoin.com/japan-revise-crypto-tax/](https://news.bitcoin.com/japan-revise-crypto-tax/)  France's setup would still be way better.  But at least as far as I can tell it wouldn't turn into the US's setup where each individual trade is a taxable event, and you are only taxed on the gains that are realized in fiat as a grand total at the end of each tax year.

I just realized though that the current tax on crypto in Japan, which is criticized by the community, is actually not so bad for small fish who are supplementing their income.   And honestly it seems fair enough to me for you to be taxed in general on income as your particular income bracket is taxed.
Purging of the alts... please yes.
where does this small green dildo come form?
LOL
Started shorting today. Hope I did something good 
effing Ether can't bounce for the life of it - dragging the whole market down.. I longed the ETHBTC ratio on this dip, considering 0.071 was holding, but looks like a bad idea.
Finally BTC is raping the alts ratios. I've waited 6 months for this moment. Tears in my eyes....
ETHBTC ratio is in freefall, BTC dominance continues to increase.  Will BTC steadily creep past 50 percent at some point? Hopefully, many of the shitcoins die off by end of year - then ICO laws will prevent new ones from sprouting up.
I think the short is temporary and caused - by all people - bitmain. they havent developed any new real technology gains in 2 years and own a huge portion of the market. This dip coincided right along with the introduction of the coolysis anteater 17.4tb/s hash rate miner that runs cool, uses way less power and extends the customer the longest warranty ever offered. It's indestructible to boot. Sound stupid? It would unless you knew that coolysis (dpw holdings) was leveraged to the gills, used BCT to secure a 500k loan payment 2'weeks.ago. They used all their money to buy the company enterech to get the power technology to make this dream possible about six months ago. Bitmain is now in a do or die situation. They either kill the price of BTC until DPW creditors get nervous and call their loans in, or face a miner thats gonna be generating BTC for DPW holdings at a far faster and cheaper rate while they await shipment, so it doesn't even matter if they sell one unit. They will be eroding the Chinese monopoly. Bitmain has 4 weeks before the first anteater ships out to kill DPW, then their goose is cooked.
[deleted]
If I'd have known it was due to tether, I might not have closed my last short.

Anyways, these weak pumps aren't impressing me, so I'm going to reopen.

I'll probably close if it goes above 6350.

So I'm certainly not on the Tether fud train, but what I'd love to know is who is using it. And why would you put $250 mil into Tether, rather than just going through USD on Gemini or something? And, Ive never even heard anecdotally of anyone using it. Does anyone have any idea where all this buy power is coming from?
Coolysis anteater will hash 17.4tb/s using half the juice of the ant miner 9. They are in financial trouble because they made a 500k debt payment secured by bitcoin 2 weeks ago. You dont think bitmain used its influence to drive this better competitor out of business before the anteater reaches market in 4 weeks? Dpw holdings (coolysis parent company) lenders will make a call on that debt if bitcoin drops too far. Stay the.course, dont sell. If you need money buy DPW stock, it's gonna skyrocket
It's that a bull flag forming on the monthly?

I dont think I’ve ever seen it that low. 

I’m not sure how anyone could be bullish at this point. 

Considering adding another 25% to short here. 

Edit: Added 15% at $6182, stops above $6300
Still long at 6300 and not the least bit worried. I'm more concerned that the people buying up this dip are good people because they're going to be incredibly rich and powerful in a few years. I mean, $6000 is cheap? $4000 is Goblin Town? If you had told me that a year ago, I'd have laughed.
at what price do miners keep mining but don't sell and hold onto the coins?  I imagine we are right around that level.  That'd be a cool news article, would probably bump the price

For those that want 5 minute data of bitcoin I've created a site posting it for free.  Also, it forecasts bitcoin price movement based solely on 5 minute data.  let me know what you think 

cryptoweatherforecast.com

Are stop losses even worth using when the volume is this low? Serious question, how many of you guys have been using it?
The early adopters have the most experience w/ these crashes, wouldn’t one think they’ve sold their cons by now if this is truly heading down to goblin town? Any “old timers” still hodling? If so, why?
Yep, totally serious, new to it all and loving it... but playing catch up is a bitch lol!
Will do some research, cheers ;)
Panic mode incoming: someone just crashed WAVES BTC pair on Binance with a big sell

[https://www.binance.com/en/trade/WAVES\_BTC](https://www.binance.com/en/trade/WAVES_BTC)

Tone Vays is beaming today..
Feel like you're getting played? The market makers are forcing you to pick a side or entirely out of the market.

MM's follow the money, they need the volatility. When people don't act as predictable as they expect they get trapped. Staying long, slowly accumulating during a correction, destroys market makers.

There is no fundamental reason the BTC market dominance should rally right now, so I think that is exactly what is going to happen.
Possible scenario: 

Stocks continue to tank while Bitcoin holds its own or goes up a bit.

You think that might attract some big money? Right at this moment we're up 2 percent vs. 24 hours ago. Suppose we stay even or go up a bit while people watch the value of their IRAs and 401Ks evaporate. 

While it pains me to see people's retirement accounts dwindle (mine included) this seems to be a pretty bullish setup for Bitcoin.

Thoughts?

i have a noob question.
is it a good idea to have both short and long position and maybe add another position for scalping? 
[deleted]
Very good point, two weeks ago they made a 500k loan payment backed by BTC. their balance sheet looks like warm doo doo. Their stock is below a dollar. Thing is, it took off when they acquired enterech from mocronet-enterech, then tanked right off. Micronet makes indestructible electronic de used for the military. Entrrech alternative energy sources coolysis makes cooling systems. If bitmain can make their financial backers nervous, they might call their money back in.time before dpw takes the whole place by storm with the ant eater in 4 weeks
when it broke 6k last weekend i was feeling pretty pissed off.  but if it breaks 5k, then ill be really pissed off.  I was in the two corrections previous to this one and because of that experience i don't think it is realistic.  Maybe it touches 4800, 4900 for a few hours, but at the same time 6k could easily be the new floor.
That fakeout to 6220 hahahaha. Spit out my coffee and couldnt stop laughing even though im in public. RIP to the bitmexicans that got baited.
my triple bottom dream became a race to the bottom

JUST
I keep seeing all these posts about banks and whales keeping the price down. Whales, maybe but the banks would be even more retarded than they are to force the price down considering they had to block transactions for the amount of people cc advancing and using bank loans for crypto. 

I wake up everyday smiling a huge grin thinking about all the loaned money out for crypto and how the price keeps tanking from December lol. Fuck the banks

How was the activity within this sub and trading in bitcoin during the last World Cup?
[deleted]
I have feeling that last 1-2-3k we were going down on pure negativity & FUD in reddit posts.

My “tin foil hat theory” is that FUD is coordinated by Bitcoin Core PR team simply because at this point Bitcoin is not ready for mass adoption. On chain transactions are expensive and slow compared to other crypto and LN is not ready yet. They need to suffocate interest in crypto until LN is ready so that some other alt don’t expose their weaknesses to broad public and grab market share and merchant adoption.

I literally don’t see any reason for this market to be so bearish what so ever. 

* Crypto Fundamentals are stronger than ever. 

* Fiat is still shit

* Banksters are still stealing 

* Crypto infrastructure is more solid

* Regulations are favorable

What’s not to like?

EDIT: Yikes, this place really has gone to the bears.
looks like I did the right thing end of April/May and sell a portion of my stack and put it towards my first car (bmw, e46, convertible from 2005).  

Ever since I bought the car, I am not caring about btc price. I can't remember the last time I haven't looked into blockfolio for more than a week.

TL;DR: Concentrate on other things at the moment and let this bitch do what he wants. BTC will come back with a vengeance, I am sure about that. I feel great even though the price is shit.
Sub 1k this year is still my call. I am certain of it too. I've been around markets too long...
I honestly believe The bull market was cuz of tether. Don't think BTC is truly worth more than what it was before it jumped to 20k. Maybe like 2k. It has no use case right now still..
Two dump attempts in last 4 hours for stopped right in their tracks at 6162.1 each time.

Edit: 3rd attempt went through it
How bout you all stop shorting and actually go long. Stop being a part of the problem, be a part of the solution. 
I'm thinking of selling my kidney to scoop more Btc while waiting to get paid Friday. I guess many are choosing to snooze now and will FOMO in when we eventually start going up. Risky move in my opinion because that's how you get in and get dumped on.

FB waited for the dip.

Optimistic outcome: Less ponzi, altucher-esque bullshit displayed to non-technical retail pleb, more substance.

“So starting June 26, we’ll be updating our policy to allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we’ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.

**Advertisers wanting to run ads for cryptocurrency products and services must submit an application to help us assess their eligibility** — including any licenses they have obtained, whether they are traded on a public stock exchange, and other relevant public background on their business. Given these restrictions, not everyone who wants to advertise will be able to do so. But we’ll listen to feedback, look at how well this policy works and continue to study this technology so that, if necessary, we can revise it over time.”

;)
I think as soon as they’re done selling the scam ICO earnings it will sink into oblivion and hopefully the money will float back to BTC. It’s been a while since i saw so much hate towards a coin
Eth has this issue where people use their systems to create complicated schemes that swindle their users. I wonder if anyone catches on this time.

I'm falling in love already 
they must really like butts and numbers
I don't know if we can assume things like this but 750,000 btc back then was the equivalent of 41,000 btc now in terms of fiat value. 

It's interesting that that is close to the # the gox trustee sold :P


This is a cool chart though, thanks. I wish there was a more detailed chart of major btc events laid over price
Why would you be numb if you've been in this space for 6 years?
It's recovered to a newer high every time this happens...... Hope it will too this time.......
Teach me your ways senpai.
best move is to try and get move fiat and buy more....probably when we've gone a bit lower.

Glad to see you posting again!
Great medium/macro term TA - blends well with the historic cycles and is really the only reasonable takeaway from the information we have.  Getting exciting here, because we'll soon learn if 6k was really the bottom or if there's more blood to be bled.
Great writeup and analysis thanks
Gut call here but I think we may have more downside, forming a lower low and creating a different bull div. The daily close today did not inspire confidence that the low I was drawing the bull div to was a true local low.

View on my TA changes = position switch at break even after fees

!long btcusd close 6080
Many thank yous for an excellent writeup.

What's an LVN, though?
Is your non-trading stack held in BTC or fiat?
!short close XBTU18 6160
Damn, just realized that 1% is $60...
Why would you be long biased from that? I'm confused. That looks just like the ltc chart just 4 days behind 
I'm on mobile so hard to draw but it looks like it's going through a lot of candles. Tried couple versions, looks stretched.
The trend line is bad.. way too much white space. Good horizontal though, looks like a big move down is brewing.
Bears take the stairs, while bulls take the night train 
You all with your bullish sentiment... don't excite me while I am in a short :P 
Why do stairs indicate big price movement soon potentially? Is there a name for that pattern?
I'm itching to sell before we drop another 2k, and this usually indicates a sharp reversal of the bear trend to the upside, so you are probably right
It's gunning for top 3!
Cognitive dissonance, primarily. 
1) The desire to make the "hero" play, make a bet against all odds and have it succeed

2) Several traders have had success counter-trading reddit/twitter, as they think the market movers act to trick the general market into doing X while whales do Y.  
Hope it's bottom and sell to FOMO chasers if it bounces. The problem is, I don't think there are many FOMO chasers left. They're either all broke or stuck holding bags. I'm also not liking the BTCUSDSHORTS to BTCUSDLONGS change over the past few days. The shorts dropped off quite a bit (from \~30K to <25K) while longs remained intact (\~31K), and yet the price remains low. This means there's hardly any new money coming in crypto. And since there's hardly any new money coming in right now, the only ones left to game are the traders themselves. And that's when things really become a gamble. Capitulation involves everyone and not just the hodlers.
So I sold my REQ tokens at an average of $0.80. Since then, the project reached several development milestones (and managed a few fuckups along the way, but hey). I've been adding increasing DCA buys every time it dipped under $0.20, with the eventual goal of having double position size at a cost around 30% of what I sold it for. I sold my AE tokens around ~$4 on average, slowly starting to DCA those back in as well, would be happy to double my position size with no fiat left to spare given how well their development is going. All my ETH was sold at an average of ~$2000 (Korean premium + some shorts on the way down). Goal is double position size at 50% the cost which is already achievable so really, not going 'all in' here is just greed. And so on.

The point here isn't to brag; but anyone who sold their alts anywhere remotely near the top is in an incredibly comfortable position to be buying back in. I don't even really care if all crypto were to die completely after all my DCA buys are fully in place -- I'd still be up significantly in terms of fiat; and if at any point in future my alts come back to ATH levels, I'll be loaded enough to not give a damn about not having even more stuff to sell. I might make more money if I wait longer and get in lower, but the stress and time spent catching the bottoms simply isn't worth it at this point. I imagine I am not the only one who managed to actually hit sell sometime between December and February.
If the futures & paper market cartel are truly going to “tame Btc” w/ price suppression as they’ve done w/ Precious Metals the last several years, perhaps folks are going to figure that out and move to other coins. A ton of PM buyers moved over to crypto.
I am having trouble with trezor, anyone see any issue? it cannot locate bitcoin server.

if YRuafraid is turning bearish, that's a pretty massive indicator that permabulls are capitulating 
If we are testing 5k, its going to be a while and definitely not guaranteed. I think we will linger at support levels for a while if we do indeed head to 5k. In that case, it may be better to rebuy at those support levels and sell if it appears that it wont hold. Just my .02
Whoooaaaa!!!!!! Up is down, left is right, XRP useful token for banking micropayments? 

YRuafraid is selling? Wow dude, never thought I'd see it. However, taking some well earned profit at +600% ROI? Not too bad, you'll sleep better at least. 
I gotcha bro. I shall pickup the baton.
Of course it's not holding. Why oh why is everyone looking for long setups in a brutal bear market? It's lunacy..complete lunacy. It's like climbing up an escalator that is going down. Makes no sense...
Dude, you did the same thing at $930 and lost your shirt.

That's when we diverged. I have started to ease into a small long here.
top post is cloud TA? cool
What does this imply
Good stuff, thanks for sharing!
I agree. We are about to witness a good old Kansas City Shuffle.

The BTCUSDSHORTS has failed to break out of the cup and handle formation with a big bearish divergence: https://www.tradingview.com/x/fAheiYIk/

And now the BTCUSDLONGS are pilling in: https://www.tradingview.com/x/oNKAkt7V/

Not to mention 6k$ is an important support.
I feel bad for the suckers that buy into any relief rallies thinking the bear market is over. My only goal now, and only goal for some time, will be to find fools greater than me.
When close to expiry, traders and hedgers will be adjusting their position , aka rolling over or adjusting spot position. So it is likely you see a lot of spikes on either direction. Also settlement fee is 0.05%
Settlement is actually .05% fees. 
The contract generally settles near spot on expiration. That's why June futures (XBTM18) is losing its discount.
I try to paint all the major trends on my tradingview. What I see is, that the downtrends are getting steeper and steeper...

This can mean two things: Either it's going to break up very violently or the other way around.

And yes, in short: It's either going up, or down. ;-)

But we are closing in to *massive* shift.

Worst alt imo is SALT, r/SaltTrader is completely dead after the price dumped from $17 to the current price of $0.98. It definitely decoupled lol.
zoom out, down trend intact. Expect new lows soon.
We seem to be skidding along the upper boundary of a [falling channel](https://imgur.com/a/h5JKYnN). Could we break out (up)? Does anyone think so? It sounds like the sentiment in this sub is that we still have a long way to go (down).

Update (4 hours later): Good thing I stayed out. Fakeout up bart, then halfass dump. 
The problem today, is there is no volatility. We are just going sideways, on low volume. 
Yep, shows how much power people have to move the market  in either direction. That looked like it could have easily gone up another $100-150.
Longs still increasing and price refuses to go up

Not looking so good 
EOS selling their remaining stash of ETH is driving this dump just as they did in April/March...

Volume is gone again we will most certainly make lower low this week.

And it's almost all on CoinBene and Bit-Z

I haven't heard of those exchanges before.

Bit-Z's eth/btc trading volume is especially hilarious, because it's a couple of orders of magnitude greater than anything else traded on there.
You implying you think it’ll drop hard? 
If that's the case, we'll probably go up a bit more then drop hard.
4800 is the target, right? But I'm inclined to believe it will never quite get there bc so many are poised to scoop it up.

There are a number of ICOs working on easy fiat on ramps, Ethos and Request are probably nearest live implementations although both are still potentially 6+ months away. *IF* all goes well, Ethos should make buying any supported crypto as easy as charging your google playstore balance. 

I would imagine Coinbase getting a banking license will help too, as well as paving the way for other exchanges to do the same, don't have many details on that one though.
Came here after a long time and first thing I see is Buckyboy, just like the old times LoL
Well, we're still trapped in a large downtrend. If we stay on this level, it would take another 4-5 days until we reach the trendline.

If we manage to break through there, I will start to get bullish. But not before that.

My main thought is the best way to lose your capital quickly is to go long any alt at most any point during a bear market.

Surely you can hit a few lucky scalps where you boink the bottom just perfectly, but eventually you are going to give it back when the bottom drops out of the thing and there is no liquidity for anybody.
This might be a good strategy, I increased my alt positions on weekend when they reached some all time lows. I am going to sell them in first bounce, not interested in holding anything except ether and btc for long term.
I'm really not sure if alts are going to bounce back as hard. I am of the belief that alts are going to generally tank harder than BTC and with btc in such a heavy downtrend, they are going to have a hard time bouncing back.

LTC already basically fell off the edge of a cliff with support at around ~$50-60 and ETH is hovering around a critical ratio level with basically air between .07 and .05. 

I guess it depends which alts you want to snatch up, though. From what I've seen lately it seems more like alts are even more bearish than btc 

If BTC bounces I am expecting dominance to rise pretty quickly actually. 

I am relatively new to trading alts though so I have no idea what the other alts are doing. Just assume they all kinda move together.

I also haven't really "lived through" a bounce. I know a few people are closing alt shorts around here so I could totally be wrong about what's gonna happen next. 

In fact, you might want to disregard my entire comment because I really rarely trade alts and don't have a firm grasp on how they act on a bounce. Lol. Most of my speculation is based on the fact that in general the alt sphere will deflate at some point and lots of gains form January will be lost- and I basically think that it's going to happen soon. I think alts will capitulate a lot harder than btc (as they already have...which could mean they won't anymore, from here. like I said. Maybe I'm clueless)
Fron what I have seen 10-20% seems to be a good profit to aim for if you can hit the bottom.
Rather easy to claim that when you launch at the tippy top of the tippy toppiest bubble. 
Boring bitcoin.

God forbid they will apply futures upon ETH so it will become boring too.

Welcome to 5% profit a year, just like the stock or PM market.
Destroy & supress price discovery like precious metals, so banks & countries can load up cheap for when their Fiat turns worthless. How do we beat these people?
Yes. Buying ETH at 1/3rd of ATH price and < 3 years since launch will most definately 'destroy your stack'.

Bizarrely contrived comment.
Well, if it's a big short, it's going to have to be covered. I'm guessing it gets covered at 5.8 if that and a huge engulfing green candle ensues.
Usually at weekends
Damn, with those three choices, it makes it trickier to countertrade the sentiment here ;)  (and it's pretty evenly divided results so far too)
This is useless 
Great poll, good to gauge the sentiment of this sub...
Stakes are indeed higher. The chances of absolute doom feel vastly lower to me at least. 

At certain points in 2015 it really felt believable it could dwindle to zilch. No matter what, that's not how it feels now no matter how much pooier it becomes. 
Why does this one feel shittiest to you?  What do you mean stakes are higher?
As long as you r not a tether hodler, you will be fine.
Bitcoin would need to sit at this price for another year and half and you would see what the 2 year 2014 bear market was like. People stopped caring even long term HODLers when out of nowhere it started rallying to 20k. I don't think it will take that long this time so many things have changed since then.
Mt Gox was great for trading, because the price would drop literally 50% in a couple of hours and then rebound 35% in the next hour.   I wish I had more money and skillz back then and could have cleaned up, and would have been so easy.
>Even though I honestly think Tether will blow up at some point.

Lol and why is that? If you still think its not backed 1:1 then you obviously have not been paying attention on how much money Bitfinex has made and is making. They are just not doing an "official" audit because frankly, they dont have to.
Why does it feel the shittiest?
My goal is 0.5 BTC over the number in my head, so I can throw that number into cold storage and screw around with the 0.5 BTC when I want to trade. 
Good question - it is based on the perceived future value as well - this is one time in my life where I can't wait to be 3 years ahead of my current age.. 2021-22, we shall see..

My goal is 10.. 
21, of course ;)
Can't stop, won't stop
Trying to grind to 4 right now, but got caught in position after the crash. Would have put me at 4.5 :(
Everytime I reach my goal, I double it and start again

>This one is going to destroy my stack... My bad trades wer

Dominance is trending up - 42.5&#37;
It's far from positive. It means a part of the alts are converted to btc, which keeps it a bit floating for some time, but eventually it will go down too.
....yeah I noticed that! 
Friend in finance said he thinks it’s going to crash like the rest.... obviously brilliant time to buy then.... but it’s not going down! 

Bloody stubborn coins!
Have you heard about the bcash stress test?


Doesn't sound good for them, would be a decent short if they actually go through with it. 
Btc led the alts down, alts still higher than april lows. There should be real alt carnage if btc breaks down.
saurce?
People are interpreting this compltely backwards. It might be good for the claim holders that they are getting their coins back, but its bad for the price. 

Instead of having 1 larger holder that would have sold the coins OTC, you will now have thousands of smaller holders that will sell the coins individually on the market. This is gauranteed sell pressure in the future. This is why we dropped as soon as the news came out. It didn't bring confidence back, it removed confidence, it's not good news, its bad news.
Thoughts... 
Let's start first with your thoughts?
Looks like a double team effort...
Short it ;)
> it almost seems too easy to just counter trade these random sideways -> pump/dump movements

Maybe the pumps, but the problem with buying the dumps is if it is "The Big One" that time and the price drops 10% very quickly.  Then you are in big trouble, especially if you can't get quickly out on Bitmex.
This move broke up from the flag, and just a minute later it broke down the flag support. Now it' back in again. Trying to trade short time frames will probably get you rekt. 
Mr. Nachos at it again. 
How can anyone be confident this is the bottom?
Sorry but that seems like confirmation bias to me. Longs going up is not a positive signal. Indeed the biggest movement in recent months was a massive move up when too many shorts opened.
Where do you get this from? 
You should be careful with BFX trading volume as the are a lot of arbitrage bots to keep the price steady with other exchanges. 

This means BFX trades with itself to keep the price leveled, but this also creates fake volume.
> ill face the repercussions later

story of my life, no regrets 
Aaaaand now we will dump. Good work.
Bottom of the hour maybe 
I am as bearish as they come right now but this logic makes no sense.
Ah yes, the old never enough purging meme, classic.
Look, Cardano was a new project at that time. XRP had not announced any of the news about payment providers starting to use XRP in 2018 and 2019 either.
Sounds like a bitcoin maximalist if I've ever heard one.  New projects will keep coming into the space and bitcoins market dominance will continue to fall.
Interestingly that clocks in at just over 19 million tether per day. If only we knew average BFX trade commission.
There's been a bunch of new tokens released since then, and a lot of milestones achieved on various projects. And it's not as if every coin since then is in green -- we are seeing less popular / successful projects dwindling. There's not going to be some kind of a marketwide wipeout on alts unless overall downtrend continues much lower than this. Heck if anything, certain alts are likely closer to their absolute floors than BTC is. 
It is wash trading, yes. They 'refund' trading fees in their own exchange token. I assume people are trying to hoard the tokens by spamming trades there.

"He stated that as the funds are hitting the end of their 1-year lockup, investors are realizing that the price is down by 50% in the year. This, in turn, leads to the redemption of the fund, which means force selling in the market. This indicates a continuation of the current bearish trend."
> I don’t think trying to hit the bottom is a good strategy. Don’t time the market and average into it. That’s what I’m doing.

To be a whale, you gotta think like one.



longevity pills
Hope you're not trading with too much, man. It's really easy to lose money on bitmex with leverage.

What do you mean, though? You can short futures, which last until the expiration date. The contract details are on the left when you click on them.

Perpetual swaps last forever (hence the name perpetual) but incur funding fees every 8 hours. They have the highest liquidity. 
This is a pretty high level humblebrag, nice. 
Yeah can relate, it's weird how seeing a negative pnl feels worse than watching profits evaporate from a winning position.  Even though it's the same bottom line in the end.
best of luck :)
Of course progressive taxes are great for the lowest earners. Taxing your wealthiest 55!!!% on their investment gains is fucking theft. 
Yes, purge all Alt/Btc pairs and see how that works out for you...
usually it comes from 1 exchange starting a push and other exchanges following. possibly a single person opening or closing a large position.

I really don't personally understand it myself because it seems like exchanges follow too closely with each other when it happens while other times, 1 exchange will try to push and others will ignore.

It's confusing.

these dumps/pumps happen right before the opposite direction a lot of the time, too, just like that dump to $6070 before moving up to $6350
Fakeout

Keep an eye on the alt charts as well as BTC.

They have dropped back down already. 
Took your sweet time getting warmed up to the idea, non?
You did - thanks for the dip..

Longing ETH when EOS is still afloat is a bad idea.
On the flipside eth was one of the main reasons why the last major bull run lasted as ling as it did. Eth bull eun was delayed compared to the rest of the major cryptos but when it ran bull, it went crazy and picked everything else up aling with it or kept them high for awhile. 
I call bullshit on the 493 ETH buy wall at 0.071 sats in binance right now lol
You can watch it in real time at Moon Math now!

if you think about it in a bear market bitcoin should be doing much better than alts. it's actually performing quite bad , since most of them trade on the btc/alt pair when people sell the alts not only are they dropping the ratio but at the same time they are losing value since bitcoin is dumping as well , so obviously in a bear market bitcoin MUST  outperform them.

 What we need to see is how well bitcoin performs against alts in the next bull run that's the real indicator
Just remember while you’re celebrating, BTC’s price rise can be directly attributed to the need to BUY Btc to fund ICO’s & to purchase those ALT’s on most exchanges. Btw/ Dentacoin is one of the few in the green today 🤢
Tears of joy ... indeed.
Agreed.  Can't wait to see this get above 60%.
ETH is falling because EOS is selling the last 100k of the ETH it owns.  After that, I expect quite a surge in the market and quite the falling down an elevator shaft for EOS.

Common monopolist tactic. It's feasible.
Why aren't you short then?
Could also be the shakeout before the breakout, we dont know. Staying in my hedge short but closed naked shprt for now...
I read your user name as "stfulong".
noone is doing a direct purchase of $250 mill tether. Bitfinex buys batches of $250 mill USDT from Tether which they give to their customers when they do a bank deposit. When they run out of tether they buy $100/250 mill more.
A lot of exchanges use USDt since they struggle to get banking relationships. Gemini, Kraken etc are exceptions that only caters to a very specific market, in the world of shady/smaller altcoin exchanges they don't even bother trying to get licenses and banks to work with them, here Tether is king. Look at Binance.
Maybe they want to buy a coin that doesn’t have a fiat pairing? Something on Binance or whatever. Bitcoin isn’t everything you know :)
Why is everyone suddenly talking about tether again? the tether injection?
here’s one example of how demand for Tether work:

I bought BTC at local small exchange, moved it to Binance, changed to Tether and just holding it now incase we drop further and i want to buy instantly.
lots of claims, no finished product to verify and financial trouble. Where can I send them my money?
If they had a product there wouldn't be financial troubles
At first I was thinking, yes, bring on some hopium please.

Then I noticed that the other two "bull flags" are twice as long at that scale. 
The entire thing from 2013 to present is a giant fucking cup and handle. /s
It could be. Just be ready for it to flag to $3500.
Yep. I’m out. Got caught both ways in that wipeout. 
 I'd just like to say thank you, we need more posts like this in the sub.

I genuinely want to know: you believe that BCash will eventually become THE bitcoin? I’m not saying this in a confrontational way: but why? What’s the entire rational behind it? 
Binance had some maintenance issues. This likely influenced their volume data: https://ethereumworldnews.com/binance-extends-system-maintenance-postpones-trading-and-withdrawals-due-to-a-risk-warning/

Kinda, don't FUD yourself boss.
Binance was down for a few hours yesterday for updates. Might be why the 24hr volume is so low...
What’s your exit plan _if_ BTC should drop below 4000? When are you going to cut your losses?
5000 is gonna be the bottom.
Presumably many of them are having a dabble in futures to hedge? 
Large-scale miners have to sell to pay for their business (electricity, rent, insurance, maintenance, etc). I'm sure some mine more than they *have* to sell, but I don't think this is really a possible scenario. 
Last believable stat I saw said between $4 and $6k, lower bounds coming from some sort of natural gas based style of elecricity for larger farms.  I know next to nothing about it tho, and have no connections to the industry.
Mining is an *income* generating activity, both fundamentally and from a tax perspective in most places.  The miner who creates a new bitcoin has no particular advantages or enticement to buy/sell/hold it over the speculator on an exchange.   
   
   So any given miner would choose to sell or hold coins the same way any given speculator would choose to sell or hold coins (with a possible slight difference being that the speculator might be concerned about length of holding for capital gains tax reasons).  The fact that they were mined instead of bought has essentially zero relevance.

This is more bullish long term than the news itself. When they start running those ads. 
I think we'll get a bounce from this tonight/tomorrow, then more blood
At least as of a couple days ago they had stopped BTC withdrawals
Rolling it over means you close your position on the contract that is about to expire and open it on the new contract. If you do nothing then the position is settled at the mark price at the time of expiration.
Nice idea but i don't get the numbers. Maybe you could clean it up a bit.
What are the time values and percentages representing?
As a buyer from 2011, I hedl for a long time, buying more along the way at sub $300 prices. After the parabolic run up, I sold over half my stack over the last 7 months. [Life changing figures.] Some $ went to buy property and income producing assets, and some $ is set aside to cover the cap gains taxes which will be due next year. The remaining coins, I'm just letting ride. I have no idea how low this will go, and have no need to add to my stack no matter where it goes. I believed in the technology 7 years ago and have watched the crypto space explode in creativity. Long term, I believe it's going to be a big win. Short term (next 1/2 year), I don't have a clue. Either way, I'm set.
Old timer, still hodling. Hopefully it stays low for another month or so, I've got bonus check coming up and I'd like to accumulate more.
Holding from $10.  I'll sell when we get close to a $1T market cap.  Everything in between is just noise.
I imagine their rationale so far has been: if I didn't sell between 2014-2015 why would I sell now 

or something along those lines

Anyone who held through 2014-2015 is obviously inclined to hold rather than sell 
> wouldn’t one think they’ve sold their cons by now if this is truly heading down to goblin town?

You realize people had to sell for the price to go from 20k to 6k right?
One OG just sold his 12 BTC -  see below.. user name - Yruafraid

Jesus.. some people probably got lucky on some limit Buys super low 
When people don't act as predictable as they expect they get trapped. Staying in **fiat** , slowly **waiting on the sidelines** during a **crash**, destroys market makers.


Do MMs exist in bitcoin? I had presumed all trades are direct on the relevant exchange. 
Just be smart money and all your dumb money problems are solved
No fundamental reason to downvote you ...
I don't think people will move funds from the stock market (down 5% in the last month) to bitcoin (down 15% in the last month) just because BTC happened to go up 2% yesterday when stocks went down 1.5%. 

Market corrections create a flight to safety (money markets, CDs, t-bills), not a flight to wildly speculative assets with marginal paths to success.

Honestly, considering a load of people dumped their savings in to bitcoin in December and the bad wrap it's getting as a result I'd be highly surprised if they did.
You can always stop guessing and just calculate the correlation coefficient for Bitcoin against the common exchange index s&p500 etc 
Hold its own? Its gone down over 10&#37; in a week.
Bitcoin could be a leading indicator. And honestly, the idea that funds will move to a riskier asset class which is also in bear market is.... ARE YOU STOKINATOR?

When BTC crashed from 1k+ after Gox and it was @ $200, I seriously considered putting in 10k Speculating that if it hit 1k again I’d 5x my money... Unfortuantely, I didn’t pull the trigger then. Just sayin’, there’s likely many out there considering the same scenario after this crash.
BTC will moon when nobody has money to invest.

Buy and sell BTC at the same time for maximum profit
It's more useful when transitioning between positions.  EG, scaling into a long while scaling out of a short, and both positions CA has a decent spread between them.
Why? It will cancel each other depending on the size of both positions.Just open position for scalping. 
No, that is the same thing as not having a position at all, unless you're doing it on two different contracts for the funding  rate + discount/premium play.

Banks would rather the price be lower.  Cryptocurrency is their competition or at least has potential be competition in the future.  Lower price means crypto looks like a failure and less likely to pose a serious threat to them anytime soon.
>  Whales, maybe but the banks would be even more retarded than they are  to force the price down considering they had to block transactions for  the amount of people cc advancing and using bank loans for crypto. 

So which person in the Bank is keeping the price of Bitcoin down? Is it my bank teller? Is it the personal banker? Is it the branch manager? The district manager? Is it the FA? Or is it just a company wide policy to buy high sell low, because that's what you're essentially accusing them of. Nobody is manipulating the price down, it's overvalued because people are greedy. That's all. No vast conspiracy. It's like if you said the employees at the electric company are smashing solar panels in their free time, get real.

I can ensure you that relatively speaking, big BTC players have been stealing/stopping-out people on their money more than banksters are stealing from normal people.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m intellectually long BTC and believe in the tech. I just don’t think it’s as “fair” and “democratic” that people believe it is. It’s a fucking Wild West and many people have lost a shit ton of money in the past 8 months.

you lost all credibility when you said "I am certain"
six months ago you said it was going to 100k.  You have no credibility, you just latch on to whatever the current trend is and act like you were right the whole time.    
Just like it was going to 100k in December, right? I know things looks grim but 1k is a pretty steep target. Hell, 2k would be a ~90% reduction from ATH. Just don't see that happening.
So you are suggesting a larger cycle bear? because going under the previous high (2014) seems unlikely otherwise.
Why do you think we'll see <$1k this year when 2014 had a bottom that would be the equivalent of $3000?

It took 2014 until like what, early 2015 to hit the bottom? 

We would have to sell off faster than we climbed o_O
[Just saw this chart](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tradingview/snapshots/y/y2nZvEO6.png) someone posted on TradingView. A fairly compelling case for sub $1,000 actually.

Exponential rise meets exponential fall with support at the previous bull market peak years back.

Got me thinking...
Have you transferred $ recently? Boarded a plane with cash? Privately made a purchase globally? Incurred forex fees? could go on.

Uh, yeah. That's what a bubble eventually rams home with extreme prejudice. 
Have u had your money seized or devalued by a corrupt, incompetent government?
Not sure if your serious or not. But the market doesnt give a damn what r/bitcoinmarkets does. You need to learn to go with the trend and accept when you are wrong. 

Disclaimer: I have lost a little bit of money over the last few days thinking we were beginning a reversal. I am now sitting back waiting to see what happens.

Thanks, just bought 100k
What I'm reading is: " I had a terrible entry for my position that I'm now underwater with. You guys need to go against the clear trend so that I can pass my bags to you. And if you don't then you are a dumb idiot"
This is hilarious. All the people going long create a path of least resistance to the way down as long as nobody's buying real coins. You should wish for everybody shorting, it would go up quick.

Ps exited my long for a small loss, creating further downard pressure. Doesn't look too great here.
How about you learn how market mechanics work. Stop being a part of the problem, be a part of the solution. 
This is why you will always lose money as a retail investor.

Big money will just game you. You need to follow trends, you will never be able to create one. 
I dont see the problem if I'm making moneys

Eh, any time the past 7 months, buying at 6K was a huge win.

And any time the past 7 months, shorting or selling 6K was a huge loss.

Could it dip a bit from here, sure, and it could also easily jump to 8.5K, we are due for a move up, even if the overall bear trend continues- just like we jumped from 6K to 12K in Feb/March, and 6K to 10K in April/May.

Altucher may have a punchable face but he is saying at least partially sensible things to his mainstream investor readers.

I think people who heed his advice will do well in the next year or two.

Invest in hookers. Thats what i did when i bought BTC with half my inheritance money at $2800 then it tanked sub $1900 in July 2017. I was able to cope and HODL thanks to them.

Ever wonder why people always tell you to have cash ready in bear markets? Its not so you can use 100&#37; to buy the dip silly.... you need some coping™ funds too.

Best part was reading the Antshares whitepaper in the brothel's lobby at 3am while drinking coffee to remove my sleepiness then making a killing a month after during the NEO rebrand.
Being numb and paralyzed to act doesn't seem like something you would want to learn how to emulate. 

And I have fallen into that trap before as well, and cost me quite a bit.
The best move right now is to conserve and protect capital.  Not risk more.  Unless $5700 is an approximate bottom and then you could potentially clean up.  But just know you are betting on a lower probability outcome.

That's bearish...a bunch of shorts closed and we barely had a bounce, now more longs are adding...its setting up nicely for a big dump. Almost all longs are underwater right now and if we start rolling over again that's a lot of sell pressure.

Yes, that's what it has come down to.  You have to pick long or short bias and then just short every pump or buy every dump.  Or just sit in your short and positions and not play their manipulated games, where they have a huge advantage.

Looks like youre a step ahead of me :D
Would you also agree that in part the hypothesis of your cautioning of an alt correction is based on - what I view at least - as your expectation of a sharp BTC capitulation in the short/medium term?
Since about April, the correlation in price movements between BTC and alts has been very high imo. think of alts as btc on leverage.

when btc climbed in April, alts climbed too but harder and when it dumped in May alts did too. but harder.

Like to look at XRP as a guide for the general alt market, ETH to an extent too.

this is a pretty neat site https://cointrading.ninja/correlation

dont get me wrong though, i could to be soooo wrong on this its unreal. thats why stops and moving slowly. not just gonna dump my whole portfolio into alts but slowly creep in. safer that way and gives me more time to do research. theres so much shit you can analyse to look for confluence, spent a while looking at OCN richlist to see if theyre adding or dumping
If I remember right you had a nice LTC short. Still have it open or re-opened?
I am scouting for LTC/BTC ratio at high 0.009s, there seems to be major support, would be a great entry if we fell that low.
Some of the Kucoin gems will easily go 2x-3x from here if we stabilize in 6ks for a few days and have a rally up to 7-8k levels. If you can't/ don't want to trade on leverage, it's the next best thing -- just have to know which coins to trade.
Yeah, all depends on btc tbh. the correlation atm is insane, alts are just btc with leverage tbh, the lower the market cap (liquidity), the bigger the leverage i think.

That being said, as long as 57xx was a temporary bottom and we move sideways/ slowly up, dont see why btc dominance wouldnt drop and alts fly up like in April

but if btc dumps... therell be pain, considering using BTC crossing below 6k as another potential stop on alts
The “Cartel” bought early, ran the price up, initiated mainstream hype, sold the top, initiated Fud galore @ key points, crashed the price, even trotted out Warren Buffett to call it “rat poison”... this was all a plan initiated in early 2016 to turn the public agianst crypto driving them from the market.
If bitcoin is boring then so is everything else.

Eth has been just as boring as bitcoin today and that's without futures.

The only moves you are going to see in this current market are the pump and dumps on binance.
Nothing is boring at x100 leverage.
It won't grow like that if it's going to live up to any sort of expectations of people who understand bitcoin. This is a new asset class with properties never seen before and traded like never seen before. 

Buy BTC when its cheap ?
Well he did lose some ETH in that trade.... hence the stack destruction
It does when it's 5X leverage and it only takes 20% loss to liquidate me.

Going to hold till 420 and hope for a bounce from there but i highly doubt it.
ETH is a joke coin tbh. Could easily fade away back to the $40-$50 range. 
With shorts being the same level as the 11th, and currently increasing longs not raising the price, I don't think shorts covering is going to trigger a reversal.  Just a small relief.
Well whoever initiated that BGD @ $6800 Jumpstarted the entire Crypto Market which took Us to 10k... I’m sure it paid off, and that’s what we need to right this ship & cancel this funeral march.
Yeah, its not that simple :-( But its interesting to see. 
I think people who haven’t experienced 2014/2015 find it impossible to empathise with those who did. Personally I can’t imagine the level of despair, although it wouldn’t surprise me to see this bear market play out much worse than people are anticipating.
Well if he bought in 2013 he probably has way, *way* more money on the line than he used to.
I can do many stupid things, but I'm not touching Tether or Finex.
Not really. If US law enforcement decided to shut down Tether and confiscate the funds, then there would be a whole lot less buy pressure.

They probably wouldn't do this, but... it's a possibility. Just remember Liberty Dollars.
I think you might be right. We overestimated the potential buyer's enthusiasm. To buy BTC, people need to feel the pain of using fiat. That's #1 that lured me in.
The absolute same thing has been said about MtGox. They're making so much money, they cannot be insolvent.
They not doing an audit because no audit firm will touch USDT. Auditing (IAS) and accounting standards (IFRS) simply hasnt caught up to crypto yet. The risk of providing reasonable assurance that the numbers are free of material misstatements is simply too high for any firm to risk their reputation on. Period. 
> then you obviously have not been paying attention on how much money Bitfinex has made and is making.

You have not been following that data either.  Because the data doesn't exist and you just made that up.
Imagine if you bought $1000 worth of BTC at $10 a piece. Watching you 1k go to 100k then crash to a measly 15k sucks, sure. Watching 2mil crash to 500k.. prob sucks more xd
Because feels, man.
I generally only mess with .5 BTC. Sometimes I’ll get ballsy and go a little more. But I like the small and steady gains so I dont take too fat of a hit to my stack 
That’s the issue.

When you achieve your goal do you have the self will to put a stop to trading and follow your plan? 
To make this viable it would have to be done by an objective 3rd party. In late 2017/early spring 2018 50-60% or so of their nodes were run by the core personnel behind Bcash, ie. very much centralised if not faked, mostly on Amazon AWS, as investigated e.g. by Lopp and other people: https://twitter.com/lopp/status/943479553829343232 This was a bigger story about that back then. 

So the outcome of any "in-house" stress test is already known: Ver will hire his shills to fake up some shit numbers, which will prove their ops are so fast are actually bending time, and then won't shut up about it for another 6 months.
Tell me 
It's the news that came out a few days ago.

It brought a bit of confidence back in to the market. 
Ha. My thoughts are -  

Bearish: we will continue to slide, CMOE will go Short as well.

1. Weekly is going to go down below the ichimoku cloud and soon the moving averages will turn downward as currently 30 week MA is accounting for ATH prices (2-2.5 weeks from Dec.)
2. We just experienced capitulation and in July, we will experience fear and loathing, and panic sell-off

Bullish:

1. Demand zone in 5400-5800 range
2. FOMO of missing the bottom causing people to start buying as soon as the price plays in that range

In short, idk.
Shorted ETH so I basically did
Yea, I think the only safe time to do it is after we've already made a large move down and price will likely go sideways for a bit. But in general yes it seems riskier lately 
oh yea definitely- doesn't mean I won't waste my time trying to figure them out. :P

I don't trade on shorter time frames exactly because of this. if bitmex's engine were lightning fast and I could execute an order precisely when I wanted to I totally would though. 
fakebearmarket
Confidence is just another feeling - simple as that
Was trying to be neutral... and yes, the increasing amount of longs is a concern - as they will slow/block a potential rally upward (take-profit) and they can accelerate a potential downfall (stop-loss). In a few weeks from now we will know if this is the smart money.
its my personal bot. i pm'd you the blog link where i link the dashboard. dont wanna share it out here in public in case it gets ddosed
Arbitrage keeps all exchanges at parity, it is nothing specific to finex
this is the bottom... is this how i get cheap coins?
Depends no? How many coins make it through this cycle? Dotcom esq man. 
I disagree. The alts still need to shed quite a bit market cap and that money will flow from alt to BTC to fiat putting even more pressure on the BTC/fiat pair. 
The economic incentives for buying /holding which coins, are valuable?

I mean lets say email costs an etoken for $. 0001 per email. There are so many projects that cannot state any basic value prop for holding /trading like that. It has to be a dividend or something that someone will paye for access to. 
purge is a little harsh. let's talk about castrating some of the shettiest coins
Pick other coins then.... 
Dotcom bubble, not everyone made it man. 
> New projects will keep coming into the space

and exit-scamming. Wasn't biiitconneeeect a new project that took few % from BTC dominance?
That's exactly the amount of new coins mined per day @10kBTCUSD
A lot alts, sure, I'm sure some are near their floor. But many should really be worth nearly nothing now. Their is literally nothing backing many of them. 
If you check the BTC/USDT pair you will notice the massive volume began to take place around the same time Tether printed the 250 millions yesterday. I believe the timing is too precise. Why the wash trading didn't happen before? This doesn't refute your theory, but it should be important to notice.

EDIT: To be more precise, the massive volume began to happen 1 hour after Tether printed 250 millions.

EDIT2: mistakes.

Same topic. Relevant quote, Bogart:

> “Most people that are going to wait for lower prices will end up paying higher prices than they are today. So I think the right move is to not try and time the market and try and average into it.”
Im only do small leverage like 4X I won’t do anymore than 5 probably. But yeah I hear people who have held for awhile but I can only hold for 2 days
Taxes are theft, period
Japan is like that tho. They all work together as a community. The CEO's salary is normally about 13 times that of the lowest paid. Its 150 times in the US/UK
Ya called it.

Fake out before a dump. 
Last time we we hit 6000, alts were at about 20% lower. This is just alts bleeding back down to their spot since there are overvalued at the current btc price 
I did. I was the one waiting on the dips to buy stupidly not knowing it was just gonna keep crashing, am I bear now?
Well it says my contract will be up in 2 days how can I make it longer 
With all the trouble with EOS, hope the market realizes that it is choosing best of the worst here.
Jared, nice website. How did you get that css figured out? Very fancy.

Gotta get dem teeth gold plated what.
Wow, wish I had known this.  Price action makes quite a bit more sense now on that front.  I wonder if this will co-coincide with the crypto market making a bottom soon.  Maybe this wallet is a better indicator right now of when a pop can be expected than charts.

I know it's a possibility, not a probability. But thank you for not calling me insane
[deleted]
That could be an explanation but then again, if they already have the money in real USD, why even buy USDT then? USDT only makes sense for altcoin-only exchanges.
Yeh. But I've been wondering this for ages too. Also read a FUD piece lately saying it was Colombian drug money, which also got me thinking about it again.
In which case no new Tethers would need to be printed since no new USD got into the ecosystem.
That does not explain how they can print tether backed by USD at all.
Don't forget the conspiracy aspect to add legitimacy. Bitmain deliberately driving down BTC price to cause financial difficulties to a potential competitor with a  $500k (80 BTC) loan. LMAO!
> Like a beautiful star collapsing in on itself. A vacuous black hole.

gypsy hates bch
Last thing I’m doing is Fuding myself 
Roughly 9hrs they where down.
Thanks wasn’t aware of that.

It’s still low AF
They don't cut losses, they go down with the ship.
Exit?  that's when I start dollar cost averaging back in the market. 
Well, for the past five months it has looked like ~6K is the bottom. So I'm sticking with that until something shows me otherwise. Of course, I'd be happy to buy at 5K but it just doesn't seem realistic at this point.
Are you sure it's not going to be 4,998?
4000 is gonna be the bottom.
You will not buy more BTC than you can afford knowing that you have a big electricity bill coming up.  So you can hold that BTC since you probably have a job.  Same with some of these large miners, Bitmain makes a ton of money selling ASICs.  Because of this extra revenue source they have a window to sell their coins and i'm sure they have a BTC market expert to best time their sells within the window.
I believe I saw stats that stated the same $6K, but since bitmain and China is a huge % of hashpower; I think it's way less than $4K. I found an article stating more of $3K-$4K for china. There's no way to accurately know.

https://www.trustnodes.com/2018/04/26/bitcoin-mining-costs-just-3000-china-500-venezuela-4700-usa
This is wrong. The dynamics of the decision taking of a miner consider the cost of operation of the miner. 

Mining a coin creates debt in the form of electricity (plus some others) the miner has to pay. Instead, when you buy a coin with your own money, you don't get into debt. The exception for the last would be when you take a loan. 

So, no, it's a lot different.

A miner can choose to not sell his coins if the debt is equal to the money we would get from selling, but he has a deadline, so he has to sell anyway, unless he decides to become a speculator and use his own money to pay his debt hoping the price of bitcoin will increase. 

I do say, a lot of miner at this range are breaking even, so they'd prefer to hold the coins hoping the price will increase, but there is still the deadline. However, there are a lot of miners who are a lot more efficient, and would be breaking even even at 4k USD/BTC. 
this is so stupidly wrong.

unless these miners have massive fiat cash reserves or their electric company accepted bitcoin they're 100&#37; selling their bitcoins to pay for the electricity.

>The fact that they were mined instead of bought has essentially zero relevance. 

Yeah - just how Exxon Mobil just holds billions of barrels of oil indefinitely and doesn't sell them because hey, is has essentially zero relevance that they drilled the oil.
> The miner who creates a new bitcoin has no particular advantages or enticement to buy/sell/hold it over the speculator on an exchange.

How? They totally have an incentive to sell over a speculator...
So short it 
Yup.

I bet they're really only doing this because crypto ads pay more. And people looooove easy money. 
well - not that. just many requests timing out, much more than normal, and there's not very much volume.
Much appreciated...thanks!
The time values are the intervals when bitcoin has increase/decrerased. Green means that the price has increased between that interval and red means that it decreased between that interval.  The percentages represent the chance of increase. A green 65% means it has increased 65% of the time in the green time intervals. A red 45% means it has increased only 45% in the red intervals.  This probably wasn't the best explanation, but check out the excel link on the page and the short version of 5 minute data will explain it better.  Here's the link again

Congrats & happy for you!
Congratulations dude, sounds like you absolutely crushed it. 
Doesn't it make you sick to pay $6k for something that you paid much, much less for before?
Yes, I’m assuming most already cashed out... which would relieve more sell pressure.
I think he sold 12 BTC, not his only 12 BTC. 
dude had ~100 btc tho
You believe that shillbait at face value? lol
sometimes I want to go on random sketchy exchanges and be the *Wick Maker*^TM where I just set limit orders extraordinarily high and low to catch those ridiculous wicks.

ETH wicked to like .077 yesterday on mex and is .072 rn lol

No, they forced you out of the market. It's easier to make with fewer participants.
Indeed they do (I do it myself, albeit, I'm a small fish in the grand scheme of things). That's one of the bigger pieces of the 2018 market people are missing. We're willing to assume the risk (sometimes, very large amounts) for very short periods, which, inherently creates among other things, stability and opportunity.

Check out this podcast https://blog.nomics.com/flippening/worlds-1st-interview-crypto-liquidity-provider-episode-0005/
Funny af. Have a gold.
I don't know. I think awareness of Bitcoin is high enough now that it's not unreasonable to expect a million new people to hedge a bit over the next week. These prices are pretty attractive, and a cursory look at the chart shows 6k as a reliable floor. 

So if a million people throw in a thousand bucks apiece over the next week, that's a billion dollars in new buying in addition to all of us who buy every dip anyway. I think we could see a slow run up over the next week or two, accelerating with panic buying after that.
Flight to safety is right, Altho I was surprise to see Gold continuous to trickle down. Defensive and safety stocks do okay too.
Maybe you don't have any retirement accounts. I have a couple. Yes, their value is evaporating lately.
Some of those people will DCA. That was still a tiny percentage of people though. What if nearly a decade of the best returns of any financial instrument starts to look attractive to three percent of people instead of the one percent who FOMOED in in December?

See, that's the thing: so far we've come up pretty far with only a miniscule number of people participating. This financial turmoil could bring a lot of new people in.
Last time I checked it was a -.14 which does indeed represent a "Weak negative correlation" (gold was a -.07, so even weaker). If I'm understanding correctly, a -1.0 would be a mirror image meaning stock market goes down 5%, BTC goes up 5%. (might not be understanding this last part correctly)

edit: thanks to Brighteyes, forgot the -
That's not a reliable metric at this point. We need a big dip in stocks before the data mean anything. It will be interesting to see if Bitcoin works as intended (see genesis block) when the next "Holy shit!" Lehman Brothers moment happens, probably when Deutschebank can no longer keep its shell game going.
Maybe his charts dont go back any further than 24 hours
Who the fuck is that? No.

Riskier? What asset has outperformed bitcoin in the past one year, let alone nine? Please, tell me. I'll buy some.
Man I feel you. How many times I'm like 'why the fuck did i not do that' ... a traders life story.
I did pull the trigger at that time, and I'm damn glad I did. Others will pull the trigger now.
[deleted]
BTC is money. It already mooned for me, but it definitely has a lot further up to go, and the people I'm talking about are people who have a few thousand bucks in a savings account doing nothing for them. There are a lot of those people. The smart ones will hedge by pulling the trigger and buying a little BTC.

>No, that is the same thing as not having a position at all, unless you're doing it on two different contracts for the funding  rate + discount/premium play. 

You're forgetting those sweet sweet maker fees. Mmm
I think it would take a lot of skill to trade without at least some emotion. 
haha well i would have to buy some if it happens, but still it doesn't feel right down there
No i won't sell.  after going through the correction down to 1800 and the next one before this current one, it doesn't feel right for it revisit those levels  They were substantial 40% corrections that took time to sort out.  And under that thesis it makes perfect sense that bitcoin went from 6k to 20 back to 6k.  So if history is any guide we are close to the bottom here
it's actually kind of funny if you just realize how absurd it is. also like he said- watching the trollbox chat explode is pretty damn entertaining and actual, laugh out loud funny 
did you just laugh out loud
Its funnier if you were browsing the Bitmex chat during that time lol
Yes I have actually. And I mean more of the cc advancing, but I remember the news talking shit about those using refis for crypto
I never said the banks were. I said I see posts saying the banks are. And in my belief it's whales not banks.

Yeah. This shit needs a fix.
Ohh yeah, capital gains taxes on coffee purchases... You are right we shouldn’t use Crypto until we figure out is it FIFO or LIFO.

BitPay now supports BTC and BCH. 
BCH works fast and cheap. Everyone would soon enough change BTC to BCH to buy coffee and other relatively small purchases. They would hardly be back to BTC.

Also, ETH has life of its own with ICOs, Crypto Games / collectibles...

Interesting projects popping left-and-right... And what BitCoin has to offer? 15$ + transactions?

Core wants to have usable product during crypto boom so I’m thinking they simply suffocate momentum as things got out of hands.

They are buying time with FUD
> I wouldn't even know where to begin.

Ask OP if he believes earth is flat. fin.
Dude you are so wrong. I’m sidelined on bitcoin right now but I have a bag of litecoin I’m holding. 
Umad?
And those people will see big gains if they hold on, just like people who were accumulating at $800, $500, $300 and so on back in the day. There's no need to freak out. Ever.
Plot twist: he's short
to the center of the earth!
yes and if you read it again, I pretty much gave my thoughts on prices and trading. 

Do not trade this, leave crypto for a while, enjoy your life and come back in a few months.

I sold some and I am happy I did so as I can now enjoy other things in life.
It's just a 318, 330ci is a beast. I am mostly using it to enjoy my ride in the city. Not too fed up with not having a 330 as insurance and gas will cost more and I am not driving that lot.

I think with all these ups and downs coming, I realized that you should spent some btc-money and just enjoy your life more. I have only started trading in August 2017 but the first few months, I didn't want to do anything else except looking at numbers. Now I am getting more and more away from them but if trading makes sense again, I'll get back it. For the time being, I am now relaxing and not caring about prices at all.
The only question is how far below 1k we go.
Yep. It’s called making money by trend following. Try it sometime.
Exponential moves higher are usually met with equal exponential moves lower. Basically the speculation overshoots to the downside just like it did to the upside. Prices look low from a distance until we get there. When we were at 12k, 6k looked insane to people. "We could never go that low"....we'll we're here...It's all perception. 
Hmm, you guys realize that $1k would be an 84% move down from here?

We haven't even moved down 84% in 7 months...
Wow, I would normally say nothing falls like that. Enron maybe. But if it did, that might be amazing to watch and one hell of a bounce to play. 
What &#37; of people do any of those things regularly?
You can buy $100,000 worth of gold from Apmex in a private transaction, legally & not reported to the government. Plus my Auto Mechanic excepts BTC...
Someone got ...Merked
Wrong buddy. I’m just sitting on the side waiting for some action. It’s been how many weeks since no action?

Based on comments here at least lots of folks have a holding stack and a trading stack, so that might not really be the case.
You're probably right. Facebook's advertising network is huge. This could lead to an influx of new BTC traders.
Haha made my day

Odds are pretty good it will, since it has since its started, math whoopies.
Luckily for me I can cope by buying the dip
Yes a naked young lady can brighten your spirits quite a bit.   I paid for their services in the past sometimes.  It was extra special when they would accept BTC or gift cards (that you could easily buy with BTC).  But I'm old and tired now and not enough bang for my buck for the most part with those girls.  It's a good thing I didn't have my crypto fortune when I was younger or would have gotten in a lot more trouble.

That depends on your initial outlook/plan/timeline of your investment and knowing whether or not you think you can time the market. I do get what you mean though.
Settling at around 3k until 2020 kinda sucks, IMO. That would invalidate /u/azop 's rainbow chart.
Yeah I'm also trading longer time frames and taking days off when I lose a trade
Thanks for being transparent. I trade spot like you (did), so I found your posts to be helpful.
Or down 8% :-P
Yup... Trading $50 move doesn't feel stupid.
I'm kind of surprised tbh 

$6200-6300 is not strong resistance...there's no reason we should be struggling so much here unless market is very, very bearish still. I really expected $6400-6600 at least 

Part of that is it seems most smart traders I follow expect that as well. It's been hard sitting in this one knowing most people I follow are going long or closing shorts. Well except for chew but he seems busy with his personal life lately lol 
maybe it's one of those "darkest before dawn" type deals

or maybe I'll get to meet those goblins everyone has been talking about
It's indicative of the trend. In the bull market the bulls took the stairs with the occasional quick drop. In the bear market the bears are taking the stairs with the occasional BGD. 
You traded on that 6. Meme? 😅
INB4 6th July bottom.
Isn't funding fucking you until then? 
If there is large enough volume on REQ transactions, the price will reflect that. If I'm wrong, oh well I'm only up 700% instead of 1000% on what I put into it originally. I can live with that. On the other hand if it gets back to $1 on some mad fomo run in future, I'll be up like 3000%. I think the r/r here aint't bad, and it takes basically no effort at this point.


well seeing as you directly referred to a tweet, stating "safu", then yes...you were referring to a tweet.

Here's a tip, don't ever become a lawyer. Attention to detail isn't your strong point
The reply to the most recent tweet is from a fake account.

With the same safu line.

That's the one I'm taking about 
you are selling to buy back lower. That makes you a short term bear, because you expect the price to go even lower. 

hence permabull getting out of position just to scalp a little 

I figured I was high on average entry...

No worries man, cash in some profits, you should. 
Or someone was closing his short.
What is an iceberg? Tia
not only do they expect it to go up, they also don't want to broadcast their position to the market as they are paying more for a hidden wall
two sides to a trade, though.
That would imply a sell wall on the sept futures not a buy wall.
Well, we didn't go straight down, we bounced off 6000 on Feb 5.
Ah cool, I didn't realize.

Actually, a good chunk of those profits *came* from AWS, but revenues came elsewhere. Nevertheless, they're a textbook example of how low profits don't always mean a business is failing.
I’m heavily invested in alts, plz don’t hurt my feelings 
So, that's the reason of the Tether issuance yesterday. Brock & friends cashing out.
We only know that ETH was moved from that wallet to a hot wallet – we don’t know how much they have sold. Could move them to other unknown wallets instead of dumping?
How much more ETH do these bastards have?
Trading ratio is like guessing which one will dump harder :/
Might try to trade that instead of BTC or ETH... Been chopped to bits lately and having little time to check charts i'm mostly gambling now...

This could be a longer safer trade for me.
lol!

People agree with you, it's just that that's a good answer to the question. I think an ETF would be amazing for BTC but that doesn't mean I think it's going to happen. 
Futures have never been a good thing for any market it touches. See PM, for example.
ETF won't happen until the space is fully regulated. That means all exchanges fully kyc/aml compliant, which means no anonymous accounts.

Is it normal for futures to trade first followed by an ETF soon after?
The source is Kraken themselves from an email they sent out to clients directly.

I thought they just pushed fiat integration date further down the roadmap, not scrap the idea completely?

Original timeline was way too optimistic on that, clearly.
Literally came to post the same thing. Is /u/oracleseven still trolling here? What about Azop's stability charts? Good times. Who was it that posted the bubble watch back in 14/15?
I'm long from around 6240 and held through 5800, 100$ is just noise the big picture calls for a relief rally imo
Nope. But i was around when it was put on coinbase. 

That was just stupid
All i remember is being traumatized because people sold off out of fear of the first bitcoin fork in july.  Stopped looking at the charts back then.
That's only when EVERYONE knows, everything you need is right there.

It just depends on how you use the information. 
Then again, if it dumps, funding rate goes to shit again and you miss the discount :P which is a mere $40 now. 
It's more about those bots that are cancelling orders right after big move. Suddenly all the walls disappear :-\ market order of 5k contracts can be spread $50
> I had a market stop execute across $90 dollars not 3 days ago

I had my stop execute over $300 higher back when we got that BGD in April. That was not a good day for me :(

Bitfinex has by far the highest volume and is considered the market leader. It went to 5755. 
Yes

was gonna write like 3 different long answers but basically yes- that is pretty much the reason, although I sort of do expect dominance to rise for a bit in general. 
It could definitely work. I think most alts are going to stop following btc and just kerplunk at some point here pretty soon though. 
Yes 0.01597 entry! Liquidation was 0.017 and it hit 0.0166 lol 
Yea that's a pretty good target, I think if it dips below 0.012 it'll get there 
Yea I actually realized I've never traded alts during a btc bounce/rally, so I could *totally* be wrong. I realized that and was like maybe I should shut up before I even experience a real alt bounce while I'm in a trade. I have primarily been looking at LTC and ETH lately. and only a bit
eth has been significantly less boring than btc today, it's tankin man
Sprinkle some nose beers in there, by gah you've got yourself a party.
:)
hedge it with an offsetting position
Your understanding of this market is a joke tbh. 
Yeah it only has actual use cases while btc is a “store of value” lol.  
I give up on the alts... Maybe I'm wrong about them, I highly doubt it but maybe. I'm not going to try and convince people not to throw money at them though anymore because WTF do I know? It went up 10x after saying that(right before it drops 90%)... The life of alts
What's your much worse scenario?
It will affect EVERYTHING
What funds? tether has no banking in USA. The reason no audit is to keep their banking relations private. Shady/NotShady, just don't use!
\>MtGox

Lol other exchanges like binance etc have to be in cahoots with Bitfinex then if Tether is truly insolvent. Its not just one exchange we are talking about here that uses Tether.

Tbh i think Tether FUD caused a lot of people profits not because it tanked the price but because people refused to Tether up and staying in BTC or alts instead.
Are your cryptos in any exchange with Tether? Its as simple as that. If you distrust Tether you might as well distrust exchanges allowing USDT trading in their platform. That includes binance, kraken, etc.
PwC and E&Y both offer auditing services for crypto businesses. 
Can't you estimate it based on how much binance etc have earned? Binance reported a $200m on its second quarter alone.
I mean he's probably got *way* more money in this than he used to
No
Set SL’s tighter for me.  Over the last couple years I’ve gained the zen to sit in cash and not revenge trade.  That itself has been a major win.  
Bitpico sound like they are a pretty objective 3rd party. 
Supposedly a group that did a stress test on the lightning network plan to do one on bcash.

And then they are going to launch a 51% attack on the network to "make Roger Ver cry"

good data, upvoted. can u PM me too, thnx
I've noticed altcoin people are even more stubborn than bitcoin people when it comes to telling them that their coin might not make it. I might get railed for this sentiment but that, to me, is indicative of what you're saying coming true pretty soon here.

It seems a lot of people like to "blame" btc as well, which is - sorry to use the word - truly delusional. There is absolutely no denying it, some of these coins will go to extremely low values. Lower than they already are. there's nothing to get emotional over about it, it's just what will happen. They are the highly speculative of the already highly speculative
No it's not comparable, these are not stocks. The projects wont go bankrupt with the value of their tokens.
Did apple continue to gain market share of the tech space throughout the 2000's? No they continuously lost market dominance as the stock skyrocketed.
Took over three years for the  Dot Com Bubble to pop....most of these ICO projects launched last year. But Crypto does move fast.
Not many. I'd guess 20 with significant market caps. 
NEO should go to 12 cents because that's what it was at the start of 2017.
Well tron is going to bitmex because of “demand” so clearly there are a lot of people who don’t share your sentiment about shitcoins. 
No shit.
They released their token just yesterday, that is why the wash trading started then. Their orderbooks are empty, not correlated with volume at all. 
Why can you only hold for 2 days? Did you short june futures?
Truth
TBH I don't think the ratio changes the fact that Alts are still a good indicator to the movement of BTC.

Before I get downvoted, I know BTC can affect the alt price too but at this moment in time alts are moving first.

In the bull market BTC led the way, but in this bear market alts are the ones to watch. 
sell low buy high... classic

>I'm waiting for the perfect entry for a long-term position. I'm not a day tarder 

Historically, investors perform better when not attempting to time the market. Looking for the perfect entry is more commonly attributed to day traders. 
I suppose I could have gone about pointing out that "predictable" is relatively uncouth here in a more amicable way.
I'm guessing they want liquidity? Money laundering? Chinese ? Duno
Dope
Lmao lemme see
The amount of Tethers available on Binance is finite. If the number of traders that enter Binance with crypto and want to go to fiat increases the number of tethers must increase to meet that new demand. Tether investors deposit USD on Tether bank accounts, Tether issues an equal number of USDt tokens which those investors can now deposit at Binance to meet the new demand.
I deposited to Binance new BTC’s that I bought OTC in exchange for Tether, they can change it right away to fiat and my Tether is backed. 
What part don't you get? Tether investors deposit USD on Tether bank accounts, Tether issues an equal number of USDt tokens as the USD amount that was deposited, those investors can now move those tokens and deposit at whatever exchange they want to provide USDt liquidity. Most likely those investors are other exchanges that support USDt and struggle with getting banking relationships.
I only answered OP question about who’s actually use it.. does it matter if I deposit to Binance USD or BTC? I still deposit money to get Tether 
Thanks for clarifying. Totally confused now as to who I thought she was. Is there someone super pro BCash here?
I would also DCA in at that point. But I’m currently short (and I’m guessing you are too). But for someone who’s already long from 6300 it would be a 40% drop to 4000.
Wtf...have you forgotten the past few days? 6k was already broken, 5755 is the new "bottom" for maybe another day or so until new lows
3000 is gonna be the bottom.


Agreed, probably even as low as 2500-3k in parts of China.
> I do say, a lot of miner at this range are breaking even, so they'd prefer to hold the coins hoping the price will increase,

A miner who chooses to hold a mined coin here is effectively identical to someone who buys a coin on an exchange right here.  Either party could choose to have $6200 or a bitcoin -- the way they got the coin isn't particularly relevant to their decision on what to do with it now.  Just ask the IRS if you're in the US, because that's exactly how they see it;  the instant a coin (or part of a coin) is mined, that is an income generating event and needs to be reported in USD value as such.  Any capitol gain or loss *after* the income generating event is not related to the mining at all. 
Person A mined one BTC, and has a $1000 electric bill due at the end of the month as a result of the mining.    
 Person B bought one BTC at some point, and has a $1000 electric bill due at the end of the month because he runs a disco in his garage.   
   
   How is the decision on what to do with that one BTC different for person A and person B, assuming that neither has any actual predictive information about the future price?   

   Yes basically all miners just sell right away, just like Exxon sells its oil right away -- because they don't *want* to be speculators at all.  But if a miner holds his BTC for even a minute after it is mined he **is a speculator** and it no longer matters how the coin was obtained.  This is exactly how the IRS sees it in the US; literally the instant the bitcoin comes into existence you have generated income (that you must report in USD at that moment), and anything that happens to it afterward is a capitol gain/loss identical to that of a trader who bought it at that price.
I did with a part of my stack with stop losses.
thank you! 
Not at all, it's still way undervalued (long term) in my opinion.
Well, if everyone thought this way we’d never see any levels of adoption. 

At some point there will obviously need to be a reason to buy BTC other than the greater fool theory, and that’s what we’re all banking on regardless of the level we bought at, no?
No, the lowest I've bought is 10, the highest 15k.

\> that you paid much, much less for before?

There's enough stories in between that it's not as simple as that.

Here’s another one on a different alt on Binance.

A few months ago someone flash crashed some alt ( Ripple maybe ?) down like 300% or something. 

It’s honestly not a terrible idea you could get lucky 
In a bear market, market movers are out to dump bags on you.  This is why you'll often see prices rise up quickly before a large move downward.  They want to offload on you at peaks & have you panic sell at the bottom (where they rebuy).  It's also a big part of the "bart".  Holding and buying permanently is a fool's move.  Wait for the signs of the bottom.
Oh, I didn't realize that once someone sells bitcoin at a higher price, they could no longer ever buy it at a lower price and have more bitcoin.  Guess I'll need to change my plans...
Cheers, I'll give it a listen 
Not you who gave gold.
Are you trying to take credit for the gold I gave him?
I can't tell if you're serious or not.

A million new people? A billion dollars?

You're out of your mind, man. No one is going to watch their 401K/IRA drop and decide to throw money at another asset that's down 60% YTD, not to mention the fact that they can't just take money out of their IRA/401K. They could allocate some to GBTC, but they won't.

This is grasping at straws bullish hopium right here.
I can't see another parabolic fomo-buy. Many people got tricked twice this year by a small rally... they will not buy it again. All what we should hope for is a slow and steady growth over the next years.
Also: I hear it over and over. "100k by end of the year" because the 3rd world will buy a 100k bitcoin. lol.
> So if a million people throw in a thousand bucks apiece over the next week

This has never happened, why the hell would you expect it to happen now? You realize $1 billion of cash coming into this market in 1 week would take us to like $25,000? 
Maybe you're right...once Bitcoin is on an upwards trend again and at the same time stocks are dropping. Right now stocks are down slightly, but Bitcoin for sure isn't trending upwards. Only once people see Bitcoin drop to 3-4k and then again reach 5k or so they'll start to maybe think it's trending upwards due to those people thinking the 3-4k was really the bottom. We're still a ways off...
If I remember my college calculus, 0.14 is a weak positive correlation. 0 is no correlation. -1 is perfect negative correlation.

And there are two main types of correlation factors. I don't know which one you are talking about but 1.0 correlation does not mean 5% change in one will result in exact 5% in the other. It just shows if they are in the same direction or not. And there's another type of correlation factor where the magnitude is important. In that 1.0 will basically mean the same graph . 
Historically people dont move from high risk to higher risk, you don't need more data to form that conclusion. They move to durable commodities like gold. 
I think you underestimate just how severe next 'big dip in stocks' might turn out to be. Magic Internet Moneys are gonna be pretty far down the list of priorities when shit really goes down.
My charts go back years, and they say we're going up. Just a question of when.
1) LOL.

2) Bitcoin is highly volatile, hence risky. Do you understand?
I don't think you understand the concept of risk. You clearly don't understand how to use time frames either. Please stay quiet until you educate yourself.
2014's?
I really have no idea why you think people are going to invest in a highly volatile asset while they are being laid off and their retirement funds dropping. 
[removed]
I always forget about that! You're right, that is a nice bonus to opening multiple positions
I always wondered how this works. Your position may never be filled fully so in the end you'll lose more than you collected by maker fees.

I mean if you don't want to trade, only collect maker fees, setting up two opposite positions at the same price may end up in having one in bad direction.
sweat maker indeed!

Ah so you're a shill. And you completely missed my point. You'd have the exact same problem with any crypto.

BTC is fine. It's the regulatory and tax environment that's squelching progress. 
Buy right this second then and help the move up with bitcoin 
So mad I could poop myself! Nah I just love calling people out, especially hypocrites 😆
You can't say that, past performance is irrelevant. There is a significant chance that we will never ever see 10k ever again. Just because it happened before doesn't mean its going to happen again.

try what, making outlandish claims and then changing course and acting like you never said it after the fact?

IIRC, you also argued against trading/trying to time the market a few months back too.
> 6k looked insane to people

Can you name names? You'd have to be utterly blind to history not to have anticipated a big ass fall on the other side. 
Sure I get that, it's just $1k seems exorbitantly low for such a short time frame. But, you may be right. The sell-off in 2014 became even more aggressive towards the end. Can't really say I expect $1k but hey what do I know
Yeah I realize it’s extreme. Taking it with a grain of salt. Honestly I’m not touching this until some *serious* signs of longer term trend reversal appear. Until then I will assume we will keep dropping.
Boarded a plane for an international flight? I bet a few people have done that today.
That's no reflection on BTC itself. Its price however became a silly sausage at the end of last year. 
So much for being part of the solution
Yeah okay, suuuuurrrreee

Edit: also the fact that you are saying you are sitting on the sidelines (which I'm still skeptical about), you are in fact ALSO part of the problem.

Why not buy and help move this thing up? Is it because you are looking to get a better long entry, like sayyyyyy the majority of shorters?

You won't buy because you want others to do the hard work in moving the price up.

Get off your high horse bud
We've gone down more than 40% over the past 7 weeks. the fuck do you mean no action? You could have made a fortune shorting.

Dont spend it all on crypto my friend. Remember, the difference between a Rich Dad and Poor Dad meme is that the Rich dad probably spends some of his money on hookers.
\>Hookers and BTC

Oh made a mistake of mentioning my crypto holdings once. Midway through the session i couldnt my dick up because I got paranoid when i realized that she might tell someone and try to mug me.

Never got mugged though, probably because it was a high class brothel. Still didnt stop me from getting paranoid though whenever i see that particular hooker.
[deleted]
Yep. Honestly was hoping I'd get a better/more comfy long term entry by now (not trading just holding for long term cap gains). Didn't happen so due to tax reasons I decided to move to leverage so I can at least hold everything but my now trading stack.
That's getting caught, not catching ;)

Chewy is hedged from 6.6, we're not even 10% lower, he said he can take this to 7k break. I'll bet he has alarms around 6.6 and not following the market now.
The tether pump couldn't even hold us above 6300 for more than half a minute, and my entry was from just over 6300 assuming a 1% discount on Sept. Probably shouldn't have given that one up, but now I'd rather not re-enter lower. 
Strange, yesterday you were saying the opposite, totally overvalued no reason to go anywhere but down etc.
Right, I get that it's like "the opposite" but why would the phrase exist as "bears take window bulls take stairs" if it just swaps during a bear market? lol

I thought it was kind of a universal statement
Not long from 7k, but holding onto an underwater at a small loss. The unusually high -.2% and -.1% we had a few rounds ago has off set any funding losses for at least the next few days unless things get really bonkers. And if they do get that bonkers, it would be... quite the shake out for funding to get high enough to turn back to a loss without the market recovering to where I can exit for at least break even. Right now, funding credits have off set ~10% of my unrealized loss.
I suggest you go to a casino and play roulette instead

Relying solely on token burning there will be no appreciation in price as there will be no external buying from pressure, people are waking up to how worthless these tokens are

yeah which is why I don't put a whole lot of stock into that kind of stuff. the idea is that someone with $1,000,000 is smarter than the people with < than that that sold into it, generally tend to avoid that kind of thinking
I mean a proper bounce, like the bounce on 2/6 and 4/12...basically U shaped on the daily 
the market can stay longer full retard than you can stay full retard :-)
Coming from a self described gym rat ;)
Thick skull.
Wait, there are 2 different Chads? loool
Genuinely curious, ive noticed you are shorting BTC but you're heavily invested in alts as well? Wont alts tank hard when BTC plummets haha whats the rationale?
sorry.  the good stuff will rebound, it'll just take time.
Cashing out to tether? What's the point of that? Unless they are using the tether to buy EOS on multiple exchanges.

Yeah, there is no way to know if they have actually sold it. But moving it from a multi sig wallet to a hotwallet and then into an exchange carries a bit of risk. Holding large amounts on exchange for an extended period of time wouldn't make sense.  


I think also it coincides well with the uptick in volume as well.. Maybe?
Not much more I believe. Over at /r/ethtrader I think I read something about 200k ETH.  
Which is of course a lot but keeping in mind they have been dumping around 70k -250k ETH a day sometimes its almost over with the selling pressure from them atleast.  

Edit: 100k left
About a month ago they had over 1.3 ETH million in that wallet. 

I'm not sure how much they collected in total, but it seems to me that the contract received about 7 million ETH during its lifetime.
Well yes that's exactly what it is haha 

I already did this with LTC and it worked out really well. The ratios are almost easier to trade than BTC itself o_O

https://www.tradingview.com/x/4cvWsLEX/

https://www.tradingview.com/x/YNbFPrCE/

LTC in massive descending triangle since January.

I shorted that bottom support line on the ratio with stops above the top line.  Just waited til it fell through. Finally did and bada bing bada boom ratio tanked like a motherf'er, now I'm short from .01597 and it's .01308. Like shorting BTC from $16k to $13k :)

https://www.tradingview.com/x/6PHue0Zw/

ETH is doing the same thing. Generally being more bearish than BTC.

Gotta remember BTC is way more liquid than these alts and ETH and LTC went up so much in 2017 that there's *way* more gains to throw up. I'm expecting LTC $55 and ETH ~$300-330.

Could be wrong on this ETH ratio move but if it falls below that line there's basically generally no support until 0.05, and even then, 0.05 is the top of that range, it tends to hover between 0.04-0.05 when entering that range 

Short from 0.08 on that one, it's .07245 now


I rarely trade alts though and haven't really "lived through" a bounce though. I know a few people are closing alt shorts around here so I could totally be wrong about what's gonna happen next. 
Yea, I wrote my setup to v4mpyre in another comment, here's what I'm thinking on ETH and LTC:

It's normal to have futures first, but ETF is not 6 -12 months after futures. It usually takes a decent amount of time (hint: years). 
This ^
For instance: I'm aquatinted with one Montreal & one Toronto company doing so.

I don't feel impelled to disclose anything further on reddit to be frank.


Not sure
Oracleseven... I have not seen much here any more.
I remember! The price went absolutely crazy within a few minutes of the market opening. I remember watching it and think "who the fuck just market bought bcash at $4000!" I think they reversed some of these trades though?
Welp, I guess I should start looking for a chance to move to futures haha
Just got back to the charts. I was out with the wife and got the alert it hit 6250. Quite surprised to come home to this haha 
i was referring to yesterday's price action.  are you referring to that or last weekend?
also an option.

given it some thought, if correlations are high then it might be smarter to heavy on two-three alts since theyll all move in the same direction anyway. going in on fewer rather than more limits risk a little bit too i think
for this to happen, btc needs to hold a value.  

e.g. btc is worth between 6k and 6.3k for a month. Then you can expect the alts to somehow live on their own until the next 10&#37; btc dump.
Sweet! Close call but very nice payout my friend
Honestly, you are missing out if you haven't traded shitcoins in a bull market, so many 3-10x left and right, man 2017 was crazy.
Yeah I know what you mean but the ups and downs are in sync with BTC albeit on a larger percentage, maybe selling ETH into BTC?

What I have noticed is that they both have 1000+ buy and sell walls keeping them in this range. I don't think they are fake walls, seen enough of them in the last 12 months to spot a fake. 

1 of 2 things.

Someone is trying to keep the price in this range to paint the daily candle, just like yesterday the it was pretty steady until it closed.

Or someone actually wants to accumulate BTC at the 6000-6150 level

That's my theory. 
never heard it called nose beers before, that's hilarious 
Not enough margin for that, would have to close half of it to hedge it
Haha. The price might not reflect it due to speculation but what I said is true. I've traded ETH both long and short for profit I have no problem with its price going up. But in my eyes there is zero fundamental value.
Well one could argue that why one would hodl a useage privilege of a data base..... but who knows what the future will bring 

Edit: I am a fan of eth and Btc just to remind the folks here 
Really the main things that make crypto valuable are decentralization and immutability. ETH has proven to have neither of those qualities, along with 99% of other alts.
1.5k would feel similar.
My “much worse” scenario is based on time and not price levels. I don’t expect the price to go much lower than this, but it wouldn’t surprise me to see the price at this level or lower by next year.
> tether has no banking in USA.

We don't know that, do we? In fact, isn't their bank rumored to be in Puerto Rico?
> Lol other exchanges like binance etc have to be in cahoots with Bitfinex then if Tether is truly insolvent. Its not just one exchange we are talking about here that uses Tether.

ceo of binance privately admitted he knows tether is probably fraud but doesnt care as long as he can get his funds out
75% of my stack is in USDT on binance since Feb. Rest i have been to trading on Bitmex. I should mention I also used to work as a audit manager for a big 4 firm.  Ive been keeping a close eye on tether and for the minute it quite obvious to me why exchanges are opting for tether rather than fiat pairs. Not losing any sleep - but dyor.  
Which means distrusting pretty much all exchanges except Gdax/Stamp.

Nope they offer advisory services to assist in business development etc. PwC even holds a small investment in vechain for example but they certainly do not offer “audit” aka assurance services.

They seem to be. That's what I meant. That's the right way to do this.

And this is what I meant about possible Bcash shenaginans and their rhetoric: They already started to skew the story to their advantage. bitcoin.com (aligned with Bcash) is already trying to frame the whole thing as a very welcome initiative, if not internally started: https://news.bitcoin.com/can-bitcoin-cash-live-up-to-its-hype-real-world-stress-test-is-coming/ coming up with their own "tests". Even came up with a date. Ffs.

Edit: If Roger Ver cry 2018 will be the best year of Bitcoin despite the bear market
Yup, that's what I meant above. An external test proper.
i added the link to my original post
Seriously man, people are weird.

I mean just state the value of your coin, not that hard. It will provide x for value y, which makes economic sense.

My Uber token is the only way to get uber rides, thus it has value based on total ride share/ Uber tokens.... Not that hard to imagine 
I have no idea what you mean. 
What is the value of their tokens? 
Agreed man, it cycles fast AF
I don't know about neo, but xrp should find a price between a penny and 25 cents by the time this market finds it's bottom.  
tron the movie or the plagiarized joke wp?
so you agree that a lot of coins have a lot further to go down...? This isn't a btc maximalism thing, even. 

I am nowhere near a bitcoin maximalist and it seems pretty obvious to me that not every coin will succeed...some of them will go to very low values, just like they did in 2014 
Yeah you are right. They opened the constest to get BZ tokens from trading at june 25 20:00 GMT+08:00  and tether printed 250 millions at june 25 19:00 GMT+08:00. Nothing conclusive though.

EDIT: typos.

EDIT: nvm, I got the timing wrong cause of my computer. Tether printed at 22:00 GMT+08:00 and contest began at 20:00 GMT+08:00.
But what if they don't deposit new USDs? The amount if Tether issued doesn't simply go up due to the increased demand of people wanting to sell a coin for Tether! It simply goes up if people deposit USD.
there are several bch supporters here- they generally keep quiet because this sub is largely anti-bch. not even just pro-btc, just anti-bch lol
2000 is gonna be the bottom.  
Why are you so focused on how the irs sees it...no one cares 

The point is miners have to pay for costs generally. They regularly sell. This is not a new concept 
Your example falls under "unless they have massive fiat cash reserves".

And you just proved the point that miners are selling, not holding.

You claimed they have no "enticement to buy/hold/sell over the speculator" but that's simply not true. They have huge electricity bills they have to pay that other speculators, like myself, don't have. If they don't have fiat cash to pay for them they *must* sell their bitcoin, or else face the wrath of the utility company
I bought mine to use it, and had change.

Then came the bubbles.
Who asked you?
Personally, I'm ok to miss the bottom as long as I can get in the asc tri before break out/markup/price discovery.

Here's the previous bear market bottom, aka "accumulation period" shown in weekly candles.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/sW063Y3h/

And here is how wyckoff followers view things:

http://d.stockcharts.com/school/data/media/chart_school/market_analysis/wyckoff3/wyckoffaccumulation.png

You can see this is almost exactly what happened.  It's my intention to hit the SPRING if possible, but worst case I'll be able to get into that ascending triangle.
If no one ever buys and holds bitcoin the project has failed.  It would become a worthless medium of exchange due to never ending volatility.
Well, a) this isn't a bear market. b) Market Makers (not movers) use short, mid, and long term strategies, they don't care about price.

c) you won't know where bottom is/was, until weeks, perhaps months later.
You missed the point.

What kind of money do you think people will use when their ATMs and credit cards stop working? Yeah, it's gonna be that bad.

I tried that once in the beginning of my trading life, thinking i was smart af. On high leverage. Made 10% profit, then lost 20% in a single candle. Never again :D
yea but I mean even without the trollbox the sheer absurdity of the market moving so randomly is kinda funny
My point is not to shill any particular alt.

I’m saying that BitCoin had market dominance of 30-40% during major bull run with tendency to go even lower.

Bitcoin is not fine. It is expensive and slow. In this state usable only for speculation.

I still do believe that Bitcoin will turn thing around in next couple of months there for that is (by far) largest coin in my portfolio.
We would need a combined effort to get the price moving up. If I had more money to afford to lose then I would buy right now, believe me. 
Why terrible advice? You think it makes more sense trading at this time? To me personally, who knows where btc is headed. Better not trade and wait it out and keep your btc.
There will be plenty of other possibilities to increase your stash.

But please let us know why its a bad advice to not care about it for the time being. There is much more to do (esp. In summer) than looking after btc.

If you‘re attached to your investment, i think you are doing it wrong.

And please, my bmw is not beat. Despite being 13years old, it runs hella smooth. Not sure why my „bad advice“ has anything to do with my bmw.


You should setup a remindme on my post. It will be awesome to rub it in... "buddy"
I want to see crypto succeed. The speculation was just so crazy. There is so much borrowed money invested in Crypto. People were hating on the banks for blocking credit card purchases...they called the banks evil..they don't realize the banks were just protecting themselves from the lunacy that was going on. I have a friend who audits wire transfers for a large bank. The amount of crypto wires going to Coinbase was insane. Everyday millions upon millions. All that money has to come out before we will see a trend change. 
Your short will appreciate 1K 
Yeah that's totally what he said and not at all intellectually dishonest.

Boarded a plane with cash? Yeah. That's fucking easy. Why would I use bitcoin?

Boarded a plane with a lot of cash, say $10,000? Who the fuck does that?
Just another "bull" hoping to get rich by doing nothing

[I took a poll earlier](https://imgur.com/a/xCBIeXB) and 10 people said that BTC was a shitcoin. Even more (33 people) said that BCash was a shitcoin.

The only version of Bitcoin that got **zero votes** was Bitcoin Diamond.

Yes good point and that is probably a downside of paying with BTC.  I've had a couple of chicks rob me, but more grab and dash type of thing.  It is dangerous dealing with that element of society sometimes...many of those girls are cool, but others are cold and calculating and plain dangerous.  


Expecting volatility to go so low when there's 3 billion in Tether looking for an entrance, and when transactions at LBC are growing exponentially... I think we're just waiting for compression at an ideal price point for a couple or a few months, not a couple years.
Yeah, I barely go 2x here with a short. Don't want to get 1k green dildo ;-)
Fair enough, just kinda expected him to close 
This is either the fake bearish accumulation stage or market is ready to make a big move lower 
no I wasn't??? you're not only confusing my time frames (I can expect it to go up in the short term while down in the long term) but I never said "it can only go down" 

I just said that that's what I was guessing would happen based on what's already happened. 

plus I can always ya know change my mind 

Also i never said I personally thought it was overvalued but that I thought the market was "realizing" it was overvalued. hence the strong downtrend 

You are putting a lot of words into my mouth.

I also try to brace for the worst so I don't get emotional when the market tries to push me out of position. 
Well its cause the big capitulations downwards are usually faster than the parabolic moves up. Cuz fear is stronger than greed?
ah sweet. good strategy
Let me get this straight. 6 months ago, at ATH price levels, you were going around posting hodl memes and telling everyone how your picks in alts are totes going higher soon. Now, with prices down 90%+, you're on the same subs, telling everyone crypto be ded, no utility, sell before it's too late.

Meanwhile 6 months ago, I was unloading my bags ( to people like you), and am now buying them back (from people like you) at 90% discounts. 

I appreciate your concern for my financial well being immensely, but... to quote yourself, "this is why you don't take advice from randoms on reddit."
Are you a pre teen? 
Are you denying you quoted that tweet?
Why did you say 'safu' then. 

Where did you get that particular spelling from...

Bears take the stairs and bulls take the elevator, isn't that how the saying goes?
Yup, I was long because I thought this bull flag breaks up, now I'm short and still think this may break up...
All good brotha. As as aside, we're at $6,163 rn on BFX, between you and me, I think this is kind of the dip before some violent upward movement, just a gut feel, been seeing larger market buys than usual in past couple hours.
The market is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get!

Alts are my HODL stack. They are annoying to trade and I’ve been burned on them many times trying to trade so I’m just holding onto them long term.

I’ll buy the rumor sell the news stuff but other than that II’ll let them sit there for a few years.

I trade with my BTC stack to increase my BTC stack, not USD 
If you're a corporate customer (and block.one is close to Bitfinex) you can cash out from Tether to dollars on Bitfinex.
You may be right, I used to trade alts, don't have time now to follow multiple charts.
What levels are you looking for LTC/BTC ratio? I think 0.0095-0.01 is totally possible, would be a great entry.

I know :( I was only trading btc when I saw alts do 10-20x in January. I was very envious. And too scared to trade back then -_-
> Or someone actually wants to accumulate BTC at the 6000-6150 level
 
that's what I'm thinking


I wouldn't be surprised to see this have been an accumulation phase or something. Just seems volume is too low to be real meaning accumulation on larger time frames
that sounds like an improvement?
Zero fundamental value? Are you insane? The fact that 94 of the top 100 tokens/projects use Ethereum, more developers than any other platform including BTC, it also does everything bitcoin does and more but better, is somehow a JOKE?
In my eyes, Facebook has zero fundamental value. I'm still not stupid enough to go around telling people it just might go crash 90%+ cus y'know, no value.

[deleted]
Your logic that bitcoin needs to gain market dominance for the market to recover is terrible.
When the amount of Tethers is running low (low liquidity) on an exchange because the demand of people that want to sell a coin for Tether increases then the exchange is incentivized to source more Tether tokens to continue working normally and ear trading fees, since many exchanges are also institutional investors on Tether the exchange itself or some investors deposit USD on Tether bank accounts and send the new issued USDt tokens fast to the exchange that is running low on Tether to meet the new demand.

So in practical terms the amount of issued Tether actually does go up due to the increased demand:

Increased demand for Tethers by traders = Exchanges forced to get new Tethers to stay liquid = New Tethers being created by investors or the exchanges themselves by depositing USD on Tether bank accounts.

It was a rational scaling debate at one point. Then, well, last summer happened and some disagreements were had, there may have been a hostile takeover attempt during a holiday weekend, a cancelled fork. It as a bit of a tussle. 
Most of the rest of the cryptosphere is anti-bch. That shitcoin brings the whole space down to a new level of propagandized argument. Before BCash, the worst type of shill was mostly just a bagholding evangelists of one type or the other. Now, we have a sect of cryptotards that are spending all their time worshiping an anonymous and notably-absent personality and dreaming up conspiracies and redefining words, meanings and logic itself.

I would do anything to bring back ETH shills.
As a neutral user that hodl neither. I find bch to be superior in real use. Not pro anti anything. And that dumbass jumps on me for being a shill. Its pretty obvious who the shills really are.

Now back to being a trading sub
China fud was intense & 3k didn’t break, nor did $200 ETH.
According to your view, the Spring was last week, we should be in the Supply-Test phase now. The 3 low of last bear market is 167 - 213 - 161. The 3 low of this bear market is 6000 - 6425 - 5750. The 1st and 3rd bottom is pretty similar.
*rolls eyes* well obiously I'm not saying "no one" will buy and hold, but reality is price is going down because more people are selling than buying.  There's tricks and whale games going on too, for sure, but on a macro time period, there's simply not enough new buyers than sellers.  Right now enough BTC has to change hands (from weak to strong) to give $BTC a "floor", essential before any new price discovery can take place.

As a side note, i recently learned of a indicator called "bitcoin days destroyed", which is a way to monitor when OG collectors sell.  A shitload of them came out to sell around $20k, which resulted in the cascade selloff, kicking off the bear market we're currently sitting in.  There's still millions of BTC sitting idle for the next run, but all that matters right now is finding that equilibrium point between sellers and buyers.
>  a) this isn't a bear market

yea... i guess we're done here.

Not bitcoin. 

"Losing money hand over first on your investments in tangible, producing companies? Try throwing your money at a completely digital "currency" that has fallen 80% in value from its peak and has murky intrinsic value, very difficult paths to entry, and a tax environment that will make your CPA's head spin! Buy now!"

I'm sure the $1bn will come flowing right in.
Literally nobody considers bitcoin a low risk investment. "invest only what you can afford to lose" is the dang community mantra
Oh yes, the global economic system collapses, dollar finds new application as toilet paper, chaos in the streets as looters fight for bread... and above all, Bitcoin paves the way for a new and better life.

Yeah, totes gonna happen.
Did you read the comment chain? He's suggesting if the stock market continues to slide people will invest more into bitcoin. If companies start performing worse there will be lay offs. 
High leverage is the pain factor here, high nominal amounts properly backed is fine. I keep a private tracker of the previous odds that a position doesn't return to break even (with and without maker fees) under the next X time period. The odds that a position will be able to close out in the green is high. The hard thing is that you need to set your stops higher than your profit targets. For some, that's both psychologically taxing, and mathematically, it means one big loss undoes many small wins. 
Its the market "gently caressing" the bears and bulls lol
We all want the price to move up, but you got to do what's most profitable based on market conditions. Complaining about shorters and bears won't turn the market around 
You're advising people on a trading sub not to trade..if you know where bitcoin is heading why aren't you actively trading?? You're in the wrong place dude we're all shorting/taking longs daily here 
I was one of those moonboiz who wired to coinbase so I totally believe it. 

I bought with my debit cared + credit card on coinbase and when I realized how exorbitant the fees were I wired it over.

that was a tiny amount, then when I wired, it was a small amount, then a moderate amount, then a huge amount a few weeks later when I was in profit
I will be out of it way before that lol. Would own quite a bit of bitcoin at that point though...

These guys have access to shit we don't even know exists.
I go 5x on ETH, so multiply that movement by 2x at least...
Last green candle of 2% on BTC made me eat a 4% loss on ETH (and of course 2 days later i would be in profit, but it could just kept going and destroy me completely)

It's more gambling than trading....
my thoughts exactly, well said
I put in orders to hedge again between 6175-6200. 
but it's not if you actually look at the big picture. we did $5.5k to $20k in literally ~33 days.

it's taken like 160 days to get back down there. ~40 days if you count the $6k dump, but that's *still* slower

I think the phrase mainly refers to markets being able to be overbought for extended periods of time while remaining oversold for long periods of time is very rare
it's a meme at this point brother

What's the point of issuing the tether in the first place? Bitfinex has relationships with banks now. They could just send the money to their account without involving tether as a middleman.

It's not about maximalism - it's about recognizing the reality that not every coin will succeed. If you agree with that, then you agree that some will be pushed out and deemed irrelevant- no one will buy them. 
my original comment was about 

> castrating some of the shettiest coins

Why in the effing hell you think you or tron is concerned?

I'm a different commenter, sorry. I don't really have feelings one way or the other about it- I won't write off some of the larger coins so I can see btc remaining at 30-50% dominance for a long time or even going lower.

The main reason I think btc dominance would go up is that alt coins have more gains to throw up. So unless ETH or XRP or BCH or whatever big coin decides to tank less than BTC while the entire market dumps, I can't see btc dominance continuing to go down in the case of another 6 bearish months
the whole thing is completely ridiculous- there's no need for things to be so hostile
Don't you sympathize at all with the fact that BCH supporters are generally OG bitcoiners?

At least they're not the /r/cryptocurrency kids who shill their random coins and stuff. They just disagree on what "bitcoin" is


Sometimes I wonder if gypsy realizes that he comes off as even more of a shill to neutral people lol.

This is going to sound pretty stupid, but the BCH tipprbot makes me jealous. Like out of all the things I think are awesome about BTC, it was that you could tip people on reddit. Now ya can't. And that makes me sad
noncoiners/butthurts are known to favor and shill centralized coins.
As I've stated on Twitter, this is *possible*  but the problem is timing. The last cycle took ~9 months to find the bottom floor and then another ~9 months of sideways before breaking up and out (starting the new bull market). So that's 1.5 years roughly. We're only 6 months from the ATH. Either time has accelerated x 3 or we still have a ways to go. I have bags in case we last off, but I'm primarily in fiat atm.
For retail plebs, sure. They won't touch until 10k ... but not market makers.

I know haha, just making a joke about the stairs down.
Bulls stole Iron Man's suit to propel them like a rocket to the top (BGD) and Bears are old school and stick to jumping from windows (BRD).

Sometimes Bears bounce around some balconies on the way down creating large stairs :)
They have no real USD trading pairs, only USDT.
PeaceHere was shorting xrp like 3 or 4 times on this run up to $3 but finally he managed to catch the top ;)
it might- half the reason funding was so bad (imo) is because finex was wayyy lower than dax/stamp and swaps were following finex. they're in lockstep again finally 

small theory of mine- there are a few very large arbitrage groups that make sure exchanges are kept in lockstep. this has occurred since futures opened (spreads were *much* larger before futures opened) and over the weekends sometimes spreads get kind of wide, possibly because the groups running the arbitration do not operate or have access to funds over the weekends.

Not sure if that's plausible or not though. I will backtest spreads between finex/stamp/dax sometime soon and see if it's worse on weekends. if you look at one of the worst spreads we had since December, it was on the 28th/29th when finex hit $12.2k and gdax was at $11.6k (right before the big dump). this was a weekend as well

guess it's just 1 data point though 
Sorry but the whole "code is law" mentality is ridiculous and throws human psychology completely out the window. Its a poor and silly viewpoint to have. 

Blockchain technology is more than just a program, its an entire community of people, and if the community decides to move a certain way, then that's a GOOD thing. 

The Dao reversal isn't much different than the segwit hardfork that occurred. Community decided. Those that were against it were free to follow ETC. 
The rest of the world doesn't give a flying fuck about your religious problems with the rollback.

Scan ICOs are on ETH, smart contract ponzies are on ETH and so on. They don't care about the rollback.
Couldn’t care less about It.  
Of course we can. 

What would make it even better is if bitcoin skyrockets to 100k once he has finished eating.

Ofcourse I agree with that, there have been many failed projects throughout the years that used to be in the top 20. But people here are generalizing the entire altcoin space. They don't speak about specific alts that need to shed a lot more value or need to fail, they speak about "Alts" in general. That's maximalism.

Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent. 

I think it's sometimes difficult to remember that not only did each public party have hundreds of millions of dollars on the line but they also had years of agreements (and broken agreements) that built up to almost unfathomable levels of intensity. Ideological schisms exacerbated in such fashion rarely end peacefully.
Have you ever been part of a housing association? This was that *10000x. And housing associations are impossible. 
> Don't you sympathize at all with the fact that BCH supporters are generally OG bitcoiners?

What do you mean? That's mostly a myth/propaganda as far as I can tell. There are a bunch of users in r/btc who claim to be from 2011 but their accounts are only a year or less old. I pressed several of them to prove that were old schoolers and none of them obliged. In terms of devs, both Mike Hearn and Gavin aren't BCashers, they've just taken a dubious (and unhelpful) stance as to which is which.

Much like the "Satoshi meant *this*" and "Satoshi would have done *this*" nonsense (speaking on behalf of an effectively-non-existent person), BCashers love to make unfalsifiable claims about how great they and their shitcoin are. There's no good way to measure the portion of OG's are biased towards project, so it's a dumb claim to make. For certain all the good devs are still with Bitcoin, as far as I can tell. Nick Szabo (who plausibly could be Satoshi) hates BCash, as do many other "original" devs. Gavin and Mike have both embarrassed themselves badly in public and it's not surprising why they're not exactly embraced by Bitcoiners anymore. 

>They just disagree on what "bitcoin" is

But you can't. You can't simultaneously reference the white paper *and* say that the non-consensus (shorter chain) "version" (i.e. contentious fork) is somehow Bitcoin. BCash shills want to pretend like that section of the WP doesn't exist. 

Consensus is everything in this experiment. They could've potentially worked to build consensus, but they didn't. Sharing the blockchain prior to Aug 1st means nothing, a separate chain is a separate chain. BCash is an alt, which is why it would be better off embracing the shorthand name, BCash. In all honesty, it's pretty clear they would be better off finally dropping this silly argument after a year in existence. If the network followed them on Aug 1 or 2nd, or even by Sept 1st. They would be able to lay claim to the name, but the network/userbase *didn't* follow, so it was fairly relegated to the *basket of deplorable alts*. 

I'm surprised you sympathize with them. You don't strike me as someone who would confuse this 'what is bitcoin?' question. 


> Don't you sympathize at all with the fact that BCH supporters are generally OG bitcoiners?

I don't think so. Prior to the actual fork taking place, the r/btc sub was mostly a place to shill ETH and other shitcoins. Hardly anyone there "liked" BTC. I think most people there are mostly diversified into altcoins.
Fees are low enough again that you could if they brought the bot back
It also requires looking at 9.2k as the ST in phase A which isn't nearly low enough imo. If this IS accumulation this is likely just the first ST of phase B and we're about to range for quite a long time.
Interesting posts - many thanks - I'm quite new to Wyckoff and so on. 

My worry is that the "bottom" is still going to be very uncertain so I'm looking to enter at a point when the recovery looks as though it has some legs. 

Just wondering what sort of indicators you will be looking at to determine when that is and whether you could point me in the right direction to read up on any useful information?

many thanks in advance :)

The markets also valued bitconnect at billions of dollars. Markets aren't very smart. 

The ratio was due for a correction, and also EOS dumped so much ETH over the past month but they are almost out. The ratio will rebound soon. 
I was trying to recover until breakeven to reduce leverage then.
Might just stick to BTC, smaller gains but also smaller losses...
REEEEEE
boo hoo richyboy ;((( 
That hasn't been the case for a while. Your balance shows up as "USD" on their database and you can either withdraw that as fiat to your bank account or as USDT.
Yea, he was wild for that one. I remember that lol

That's fair. I don't think every coin will die personally. I think a lot will. :P like 8 or 9 out of 10
You're allowed to state your argument in which coins will survive and why, there will be some no doubt. But a lot less than today. 
What community? I'm confused. You mean I'm underestimating alts?

Here's how I justify my prediction that most alts will die:

dotcom bubble is similar to the altcoin bubble in almost every single way. pets.com -> dentacoin, long island blockchain. quite literally just throwing "coin" and "blockchain" onto coin names and company names and making a shit ton of money for 0 reason at all. That exemplifies the extreme speculation that occupies the alt space

look at 2014 coinmarketcap historical archives. You will recognize today about 2-3 coins on the top 50. every single other one is basically dead now.

it's never "different" this time. hype around these bubbles is the same exact thing in every single bubble throughout history. People get overexuberant and speculate with massive greed. It all comes crashing down and people eventually realize they're investing in something that has 0 real world value, they just bought because FOMO/greater fool. 

Most of these coins don't actually do anything- some literally don't even have mainnets. It's all hype. that stuff dies out with a whimper

ofc not every alt will die. just most of them
Lol what do you mean? Why so bad
> But you can't. You can't simultaneously reference the white paper and say that the non-consensus (shorter chain) "version" (i.e. contentious fork) is somehow Bitcoin. BCash shills want to pretend like that section of the WP doesn't exist.

Well, I mean what it *should* be. Not what it is. I agree that calling it bitcoin when it has the shorter chain is patently false- but disagreeing on its direction and structure is fair game, nah?

and you're gonna think I've been brainwashed or something but from what I've seen most of the BCH people have been around far longer than the average BTC proponent. I mean, totally anecdotal...but just from what I've noticed it has seemed that way generally.

I get the disruption, the attempt to take the name, etc, is all ridiculous and misleading- but my main question was why don't you sympathize with BCH supporters when they seem to simply have a different idea of what BTC is. 

I guess it's a lot more complicated than that. I've not done a whole lot of research on the history between the two. Seems like the whole thing is a big mess 

Not to mention the individuals associated with BCH tend to be...a bit ridiculous. I don't like Ver, Wright, etc, they're clearly snakes 
I would love it. Like I said, sounds stupid but I would genuinely be a bit more into btc if that happened. It's the little things with me...
I'm looking for signs of accumulation tbh.  I'm looking for a "spring event" after a period of relative sideways, potentially in Q3 or 4 of this year.  I want to see massive selling pressure outside of our standard trade range, with the market resisting further lows and pushing price back up and into the trade range.  This is my ideal setup.

Who cares about EOS?

You realized that ETH can't be all things it wants to be right? Utility tokens are subject to competition. ETH can't maintain its monopoly. 

I hope you realize that.

Right not its only use case is ICO's. That should tell you quite about about what its fundamental value is. 
Yes, it show as USD but it's not.
> you can either withdraw that as fiat to your bank account or as USDT.

Exactly, but the exchange only holds Tether. If you want to withdraw USD you first have to either deposit tether or sell crypto for tether. Than you can withdraw the tether as USD.
I still feel salty that I didn't long that 350% LTC run when LN went public ;) When I found out it was already up 30% and I thought it's the top :(

Yes, so long as you don't erroneously refer to it as Bitcoin. As soon as they start describing it under the pretense that it's "the real" or "a version" of Bitcoin, they've cross the line into fraud. Even by the very white paper they cite as "the original vision", BCash is not Bitcoin. By their logic, Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond, Litecoin, Dogecoin and so on are *all* "Bitcoin candidates". It's a nonsense idea. The whole point of Bitcoin is to build on a *single + unified* chain. Minority chains are attacks on the main network and should be avoided and rebuked. 

>and you're gonna think I've been brainwashed or something but from what I've seen most of the BCH people have been around far longer than the average BTC proponent. I mean, totally anecdotal...but just from what I've noticed it has seemed that way generally.

As in their accounts have been around for longer (highly doubt that) or they're just *claiming* to be old schoolers? If the latter, be careful what you believe. 

>I get the disruption, the attempt to take the name, etc, is all ridiculous and misleading- but my main question was why don't you sympathize with BCH supporters when they seem to simply have a different idea of what BTC is.

Because it's not arbitrarily defined. The white paper (which they hold dear to their hearts) is explicit in this regard. BCH is just another alt. They had their chance and they didn't capture the network. Now their 3x shorter and same time next year they'll be 10x-20x shorter. Would you concede that *at some point* they are relegated to being just another alt? Right?

>I guess it's a lot more complicated than that. I've not done a whole lot of research on the history between the two. Seems like the whole thing is a big mess

Not really. BCashers just make everything into a big scene. The unrest in Bitcoin was a fringe, which is why their coin is barely treading water above 10%. They describe the Bitcoin community as "divided" and there being a "civil war". That's just melodrama. Bitcoin is designed to be slow moving and changes facilitated by large-majority consensus. What BCash did was radical and if not for Jihan and the EDA they would have immediately collapsed. After 2X was canceled, BCash was hijacked by opportunists. 

>Not to mention the individuals associated with BCH tend to be...a bit ridiculous. I don't like Ver, Wright, etc, they're clearly snakes

Literally the worst of the worst people are readily embraced by the BCash community. What does that tell you? Faketoshi, for crying out loud, is still a main figurehead. That alone is a massive red flag. Beyond that, Roger (asshole/liar/scumbag), Falkvinge (Complete blowhard ignoramus), Jihan (ruthless monopolist), DeadalNix (HF dictator) and Ryan X. Charles (serial/compulsive liar and idiot) are the people putting on theatrics and leading the shill army. Peter Rizun and *maybe* Chris Pacia are the somewhat reasonable guys who're at the forefront of that project. Pretty much everyone else that I can think of is just a straight-up scumbag.

----

I've said it many times before, the only reason that BCash has *any* value is because it was freely distributed to Bitcoiners and, naturally, a market emerged. Notice how every subsequent fork was less and less relevant. Just like so much of this space, BCash carved out its little pump and dump niche and exists purely for speculative purposes. Obviously, there are some legit (confused) fan-bois out there, but these people are merely being taken for a ride to provide liquidity for Roger, Jihan and whoever else has that kind of stake.

The whole thing is annoying af and people (me) are right to openly mock them for openly lying. Fight fire with fire. 


Many thanks! Will watch your posts with interest.
The fact that EOS dumped nearly 1 million ETH over the past month is a big deal and part of the reason ETH has dropped in ratio and USD lately. 

And yeah, I'm aware Eth won't have always have a monopoly on tokens, but its already the biggest and best blockchain out there right now with the most users - the market just hasn't caught up in valuation yet. Takes time for these sorts of things.

I bought LTC at $135 :P 

sold it at like $160...went to $340 looooooool

I would concede that they are an alt until they have the longer chain- kind of seems like a no brainer to me. Just sympathizing with the people who are frustrated with the direction the devs have taken bitcoin is all.

Huh, yeah, I guess I need to do more reading about it. The whole thing is way too complex of a holy war for me to get into. I guess it comes across as harmless to me because I missed all the politics and manipulation and stuff 
Cool.  On another note, another sign of a "bottom" is when bad news gets worse but the price doesn't really react.  "Tether discovered to be fraudulent!" type stuff and market kind of shrugs it off.  "China bans bitcoin!" and price rebounds after a day.  These are good sentiment indicators.

So my IDEAL entry will be in the midst of terrible news, friends calling it a scam, price falling lower than $5k (1.2k to 4k would be great), alt's bleeding and dying horrible deaths, and all this during or after a noticable period of sideways.

What's really happening in that situation is there's a sort of economiic floor - the crypto economy simply operates at that price with or without any help from whales or CO's.  It's what daily business and usage for btc averages out at.  The big picture is for the whales to push prices down to that level and find the price floor, before they begin a new run up again.
> The fact that EOS dumped nearly 1 million ETH over the past month is a big deal and part of the reason ETH has dropped in ratio and USD lately.

That's my point. The only use case is ICO's. That's not a sustainable model.

>And yeah, I'm aware Eth won't have always have a monopoly on tokens, but its already the biggest and best blockchain out there right now with the most users - the market just hasn't caught up in valuation yet. Takes time for these sorts of things.

That doesn't make any sense. Where does ETH value come from? Why should people hold it instead of spend it to run the network? Ether can't continuously collect economic rent from its users. Its value should match the costs to process transactions, which is MUCH lower than where its value currently is today. It doesn't have store of value properties, even Vitalik admits that its not trying to supplant Bitcoin in this regard and its centralized. 

The markets haven't caught up the fact that its just another worthless shitcoin. Rent-seeking utility coins are *incredibly* overvalued at their moment. Like I said, the price should match their utility and network velocity.

It's a house of cards that will fall to basically zero within the next 10 years. Mark my words.
The fact they have a banking relation has nothing to do with the fact the balance on your Bitfinex account, although shown as USD, is USDT.

I was heavily trading LTC year ago when it was at 50 :-P
One more point I wanted to make is that Big Block v. Core is not the same thing as BCash vs. Bitcoin. 

Big blockers are welcome to build consensus around their proposal **on Bitcoin**. They're welcome to write a HF proposal called *Bitcoin Cash 2* and convince people to switch over at a certain block height. *This* would be a legitimate way for Roger and Faketoshi and whoever else to legitimately claim Bitcoin as their own Big Block^TM vision. This would also be much more likely to happen at this point, imo, than it would be for BCash to overthrow Bitcoin.

Contentious forks just *do not make sense* and weaken the network. In fact, the weaken the sum of *both* networks. So it's a lose-lose scenario. 

Metcalfe's law is self-fulfilling in that consensus PoW networks are inherently self organizing around one chain, or at least they should be (they *will be*, long term). 

Consensus begets decentralization begets value begets consensus perpetuity.
> I would concede that they are an alt until they have the longer chain- kind of seems like a no brainer to me.

Even if they (by some miracle from God) manage to flip Bitcoin *and* accumulate more total work, it would be a strange argument to say that Bitcoin was *one thing* during one period and *a different thing* after a certain date. In my view, it's a one-shot kind of deal. If a fork can't flip Bitcoin *quickly* then it's permanently deemed something else.

Not that BCash will ever even come close to flipping.

>Huh, yeah, I guess I need to do more reading about it. The whole thing is way too complex of a holy war for me to get into. I guess it comes across as harmless to me because I missed all the politics and manipulation and stuff

It's a smoke show. Bitcoiners wouldn't even be bothering to address this nonsense if it weren't for the whole naming fiasco. I think part of the reason they fight over the title is because it draws more attention and they can cry foul when people are mean to them. 

In reality, nobody gives a shit, it's just annoying af in the short term to have to deal with so many puppets who can't wrap their heads around basic facts (such as the longest chain rule). At least with ETH shills, they argue that Bitcoin sucks because of A, B and C and (while they're wrong about the sucking part) they're usually not wrong about A, B and C. BCashers try to claim Bitcoin is X, Y and Z, but they're wrong about their premises. Then they dig a hole in the ground and stick their head deep inside. There's no rhyme or reason to their irrationality, they'll just say *anything* to reinforce and justify the narrative. It's just theatrics (similar to, but more extreme than, other alts).
Saved! Thanks again :)
You'll see. The biggest companies of the last few decades have always been those that build a platform for others to build on. Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Google, Uber, Airbnb - the list goes on and on. Ethereum and other platforms will be no different. 
It's a number on a database until you withdraw, you can withdraw in USD.
How was consensus achieved for all of this anyway? Who decides how to move forward in terms of where the development team expends their efforts? What was the process of saying "no, we don't need bigger blocks, we need a second layer solution"
Makes sense, can understand why you get so frustrated then. The naming fiasco does seem ridiculous...clearly a publicity thing
None of that matters. The token value should match the velocity and value of the network. Any additional value cannot be justified, as the market will arbitrage this cost down to effectively zero. Even other competing Ethereum forks, like ETC (or any others) will drive this cost down to zero.

I think you're pretty confused as to the economics of Ethereum. The whole thing doesn't make much sense, even more-so if they're trying to move away from PoW. Only a PoW, decentralized SoV coin is an exception to this rule. 

You're in for a rude awakening, I think.

RemindMe! 10 years "Is ETH worth a lot or a little?" 
Only if you're a corporate customer. I suggest you try it.
That's the ~~100 Billion~~ 90 Billion dollar question. Up until last year it didn't boil over. That doesn't mean that 90% of people don't agree on what Bitcoin is at this point. But we now know what contentious hard forks look like and we've probably already seen the most damage in BCH. Each subsequent fork has been less meaningful in every way possible. 

HF Consensus need emerge from the market. Miner / Devs can't control the market through something like the New York Agreement. Users must push back against this. 

There's a working theory in BCash that miners are going to flip Bitcoin suddenly, because they're miners... This doesn't add up. Users control Bitcoin. Miners can start mining another chain (ex: Bitcoin Uranium [block size change to 420 Mb]) but if the users don't want that, then they stay with a **temporarily** shorter chain (Bitcoin Legacy - BTC). Very quickly, the attackers, who are unprofitably mining Bitcoin Uranium would run out of money and succumb market forces. 

This is why awareness of is pretty important here. Users need to understand the value and not be fooled into buying a centralized minority chain. I have faith in markets but crypto is *highly* irrational. Even now that law makers and regulators are somewhat familiar with what crypto is, it's still cringeworthy to hear most of them explain the tech or economic principles. My fear is that people are by and large to stupid to understand technology and they end up serving *it* instead of it serving *them*. 

Users [supply holders and corresponding demand FOMOers] need (and do) control Bitcoin.
Yeah there's no good way to deal with it. If you play nice, they don't. If you play dirty, they accuse you of being unfair/lying/deceptive and play victim/innocent. 

By and large the worst crypto sect. I would take Buttcoiners, Ether-nuts, Ripple apologists, Litecoin futurists and all other types of shills over your average BCasher. 

If they were admittedly an alt, then people would stop caring (and the price would almost certainly decline significantly [it's doing 2012-level Bitcoin TX's FFS]). Their whole shtick depends on this narrative of being the *VISION*. It's so absurd and getting more-so with each passing day.
You're right in the fact that the token price may be more than its currently worth, but if that's true for ETH then it's twice as true for bitcoin. ETH will always have value due to a few things, one : simple supply and demand. Projects running on the network will need to buy gas in order to run their dapps and projects. The more dapps, the more valuable ETH is. Two, there will always be those who use it as a transfer of value like bitcoin. Three, at some point there may be a governance system which gives it value. (way farther down the line) Four, PoS will be great for receiving dividends and passive income that some people like to have. Five, with PoS, inflation will grind to a halt. Also, we may see token burning happen and therefore we may actually see DEFLATION start to occur. 
Unfortunately (and fortunately) it's a relatively complex, unique technology so naturally there's going to be a lot of confusion and misleading going on.

Another question- doesn't bitmain have a massive amount of mining power? Like 40%+? 

And that's Jihan, right? What's stopping him from a 51% attack if he/his group has so much mining power? Because it would essentially delegitimize the entire network and essentially be self-sabotage?
Bitcoin is specifically designed to not function like a utility token. That's not what it's meant for. It's meant to be money.

ETH is *trying* to be a utility token. If it succeeds, it's value will match its utility, which will be competed to a non rent seeking value. This value of ETH should be matched to the cost to *access its network* for whatever purpose and capacity you need to use it for. Rent seeking doesn't work unless you have a SoV use case, which ETH doesn't have because its a minority PoW chain (compared with Bitcoin) and is centralized (plus its moving away from PoW anyway).

He doesn't have to 51% attack, and it wouldn't make any sense to. Simply sponsoring an alternative project that he believes is actually better than BTC and will eventually pull hashrate away from BTC will necessarily inevitably result in the collapse of BTC due to hashpower starvaration, requiring a hardfork to fix, and that hardfork will be necessarily less secure than the BCH chain.

There are many reasons why Jihan can't/won't do that. The primary reason is that it's literally throwing money down the drain. Unless he can actually have an impact and get people and exchanges to switch to a 51% attacked chain (or just take BCash for another valid example). If users don't bite the chain, then it will ultimately prove unprofitable. This is why nodes *do* protect the network. Independent verification of the chain is how you detect 51% attacks. If an attack occurs, then users, exchanges, wallets, nodes, and non-attacking miners need to re-org around the correct chain (the temporarily shorter one). This is true *economic* consensus because buyers and sellers are calling the shots, not miners. Bitcoin *must* remain this way in order to succeed. Apparently most people still barely understand this, but people should be much *more* aware of how shitty contentious and attacked forks are. It's bad business and the goal should be to avoid splitting the chain as much as possible. 

There are some good projects underway, like, I don't know if you saw that video from a few weeks ago of Jimmy Song interviewing that guy from Blockstream (yes *the* Blockstream, evil banking corp). He redesigned the mining protocol to allow *individual miners* (not pools) to make the blocks. This is a **massive step forward** in decentralization. This means that, so long as the miner has the whole blockchain (must keep it lightweight), mining pools don't have authority/ability to structure blocks. That alone takes a huge amount of power away from Jihan and *all the pools*, which is I why you can expect Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin ABC to avoid making the same changes. 

edit: another reason Jihan wouldn't 51% attack (presumably) is that he lowers his total income when SHA-256 ASICS demand goes down. Jihan's goals are to maintain his monopoly and restrict supply of ASICS as the value of SHA-256 mining increases (the market slowly goes up). Luckily other manufacturers are taking note and the monopoly will hopefully be dismantled sooner rather than later.

thx for always explaining :) 

honestly don't understand a few things still, just because it's a bit above my depth of knowledge...like the last part.

why would demand for SHA-256 ASICS decrease if he 51% attacked?
[removed]
I'm just saying that damaging Bitcoin demand and price by attacking it has negative repercussions for miners and ASICS manufacturers. Jihan is both. He wants ASICS demand to be high (control supply) but he also wants mining profitability to be high (high crypto prices) so that the miners that he controls are as profitable as possible. 

He's making money selling the equipment *and* making money running the equipment when supply is constricted. It's a double edge sword but his profits would be in jeopardy if he attacked Bitcoin and the price declined.
