When I think about selling my remaining BTC cold storage I just remember there were 13 great opportunities to sell that I ignored.  

13 Great Places to Have Sold BTC Instead of Selling it Now (like a pleb):

Hindsight is 20/20- this is just for fun :-)

Lots of bullish MACD divergence on several time frames, I went all in w/trade stack @ 6300.  Found so many divergences, I could not believe it.  I know it's risky but man I cannot say no when so many time frames are telling me to deep dive here. I am trusting the process, had to do it, could be a tad early but there's no reason to wait if I am sure about this setup now.  Stops at 6150.

Edit: Whew sold 1/2 on pop to 6420

Edit: Here's the weekly MACD divergence I saw:

https://imgur.com/a/Doz8n8P
Point and Figure https://i.imgur.com/pEnG2ZG.png  We have broken down below our range when we took out $6,373.  A pullback to $4,499 would complete unresolved long pole dating back over 8 months ago and is our next likely target.  We have a recent unresolved long pole of 16 O's from 6/10, a move above 7,040 would resolve 50% of the pole.  We have a new unresolved long pole of 12 O's from today, a move above 6,373 would resolve 50% of the pole.

New lower low and weekly closing below wedge are the two pieces of confirmation we needed to know that this is a break down from weekly wedge: https://www.tradingview.com/x/HhG2G3bF/  Target for a successful break down would be $4,100.  This corresponds with 80% pullback from $20,000 top & touch down on monthly trendline.  Short entry ideally would be between $7,000-$7,300.  If we moved up to $7,040 we would find resistance at the break down point of the wedge and would resolve both our recent long poles.  This is the best place to risk a short off of, but there's no guarantee we'll get that high any time soon with this weekly bearish trend in full force.
Seeing a green candle feels foreign after so many days of falling.
those Jabroni Twins baiting big money to short bitcoin better have an answer for this market action or so help me god I’ll angrily tweet at them until they block me.  
The daily discussion here are so much better then the daily discussions on the cryptocurrency sub. They are so in denial over there that it’s comical. 
Previous long\-term assessment of price based on Volume RSI: [https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8oxl82/daily\_discussion\_wednesday\_june\_06\_2018/e07cjbi/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8oxl82/daily_discussion_wednesday_june_06_2018/e07cjbi/)

[VRSI as an indicator](https://www.marketvolume.com/technicalanalysis/volumersi.asp)

Maximum goblin town exploration:

[https://imgur.com/a/mpCKq3F](https://imgur.com/a/mpCKq3F)

Observations (against previous statements):

* Jesus Christ the weekly VRSI is just insanely low. For reference [https://imgur.com/a/I1D0l0i](https://imgur.com/a/I1D0l0i)
* Monthly still isn't into oversold. I said before that maybe we need to go into the oversold on the monthly before we turn around this bear market.
* Getting the VRSI lower than this on the weekly is harder and harder, and seems to be slowly down by a factor of 1.75.
* The 28 week MA is accelerating towards our current level as we move away from that peak of 80\+.
* Said MA is about to move under 50, which is an apparent bullish signal.
* Market sentiment has me thinking this'll be slow as hell. Extrapolating the drop in VRSI (bar a reversal) shows us not reverting till as late as November. Bleurgh.

All of the above changes if there's a sudden modal shift in the volume and direction of volume. IMO if it drags we're going down. If we're going to get out of this bear market the volume is going to need to be violent and I don't see that happening right now. As I said in my meme\-post, welcome to goblin town.
Guys at the end of the day moons and lambos dont mean anything compared to the amazing community we've built here. We got each others backs. When the market gives us a bag of dicks, we give each other a bag of fives. Lets have toast to each other-- no more crying in our pillows! 
Goblin town here we come.

Anyone else pointedly not going to mention the current crypto market/BTC price to their other half? I'm wondering how long I can get away with it before they ask and I have to mumble some sort of value that'll make them brick themselves.
long time lurker and first time poster here:  I noticed that BTC almost perfectly bounced off the 200 day EMA line on the 3D chart (gdax).

If it tests this line again I was thinking of going long with a tight SL, anyone care to tell me why I shouldn't do that?
!short XBTU18 close 6230

Plan was to keep it open and close the Jun one. But if this reverses Sept can skyrocket in premium. Closing with good enough profit. We bounced hard from close to ATH line, dropped like a stone lately and I think I'll get a chance to reopen higher. Just seeing all those new-to-shorting people is making me a bit scared.

Leaving my bit-more-than-a-hedge from 6.8 open without stops. Still don't believe this will go too much up but not convicted enough to keep both now. And I'm going to sleep and don't want to babysit whole night.

If you have short open from high above then keep it open, but it's never bad time to take profits.
Interesting to note that while Bitfinex's open interest has gone from 52,000 to 59,000 btc over the past week, bitmex has gone from 93,000 to 78,000. 

Are noobs really flocking to bitmex? Or are we seeing people quit? Or did a ton of longs get liquidated? 


I've never seen so much negative press from mainstream media. This is even worse than in 2011 \- 2015 in that regard. Even on reddit every single sub you visit everyone's trash talking Bitcoin when the subject comes up. I feel like I went back in time. I guess people are salty they lost money. Don't even get me started how many people are saying Bitcoin will literally consume the whole planet's energy and fuck everything up.
I was drunk at the bar a few weeks ago and was showing my friend how to buy bitcoin on the coinbase app. I bought $5 worth. It's worth $3.48 now. I'm not selling.
Quick reminder that ~~shit~~lowquality-posting does not measurably improve your trading position. 
The bounce here off of $6100 looks pretty healthy and has the makeup of a short-term capitulation formation.  We'll need to break the local downtrend line if we're to expect any kind of short-term reversal, otherwise it's likely price will continue to move down to the log resistance from ATH currently sitting at ~$6k.

Many are speculating that we'll see brand new lows in the short term (next few days) and I personally don't think we will.. this downtrend has been ongoing since about $10k, 1D RSI is starting to dip under 30, we're near previous ATL which converges with the support line from ATH. Price would have to move below the log support line from ATH which would be unprecedented.  Of course it can still happen... and if so I'll be the first to short it, but this seems unlikely to me. 

[Chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/SZAA3HiA/) 

I think more likely we get a technical bounce either here or off of $6k/log support which will move price back into the mid 6's - low 7's before the next leg down. 

I do tend to think we're going to see lower lows.  Fib and support metrics put this potential capitulation event in the $4300-$4900 range.  If we expect log support to be respected then we won't see these numbers until mid-July at the earliest. 

Long from $6250.  Will add at $6k if we get there.  Will cut loose just below $5900.

Safe trades.

The Wyckoff accumulation chart is gonna be the thing for the next two weeks isn't it? I will sell this meme when McAfee posts it on twitter 
Another day, another low. We've continued taking the stairs downwards, but I'm beginning to watch for a large-scale technical bounce. There's still room to fall, but the biggest formation I'm currently watching is the falling wedge on the 1H: https://www.tradingview.com/x/BBNtpGeA/  

Pair that in with 5/6 red candles on the daily with the one green being a minor bounce right at the wire on UTC, along with low RSI across the medium time frames, and the r/r is definitely swinging towards the long side, or closing shorts. 

I'm still holding my June futures short from 7505, but I closed out of swaps. I got too clever for my own good last night with my stops/profit-taking. I closed out 25% of my entry (from 6680) at 6540, set 50% stops at 6610 (hit overnight) and 25% at b/e (didn't hit). I closed that this morning at 6410. I was looking to move that position to September anyway. I'm going to open 20% of my September position here while the premium is narrow. If we do drop, I expect it to widen significantly. If we pop up, I don't expect a premium, and I'll add more up to 6600. I'll look to bail on a break of 6650. 

!short XBTU18 6445 10% 5x

Good luck all. 

edit to add: I recognize I'm shorting the bottom here at the same time as calling for a bounce. It's a small position, and I'm only taking it as insurance in case we drop through 6400. Shorting a breakdown of 6400 would be significantly better, but I don't trust the mex engine. 
My Mom just sent me a CNN article about the ~~WSJ~~ NYT article and said she is selling.  This is how the manipulation works and how you get retail investors to sell at the bottom, bravo Bogs, well played.

the untethered paper guy is even on fastmoney lol
Normal people won't buy btc in a bear market. Only smart money and those who believe in the tech will buy. So forget about google trend and retail sentiment, the bottom is determined by smart money and believers.

There are 2 camps of traders:

Those who trade purely by TA believe that there is still a large empty space under 6k to fall into.

Those who believe in fundamental believe that a 70% fall from ATH at 6k is a good enough price to enter.

The bottom will be where those 2 camps find equilibrium.
so my first shit yourself target of 6430 has just been destroyed.

So now it's only 6000 left before blood in your stools

My text post didn't do so well in this sub, so I'll post here:

Been lurking awhile, and I have a decent understanding of trading basics. I've learned how to read charts (hopefully well enough to get by), and picked up the lingo from this sub. I'd like to start trading, but I want to know what your favorite exchanges are and why. I purchased my initial BTC through coinbase, but I know it's shit for trading. I've heard gdax is a good transition from CB to the trading world, but I know you can't short. I'd like the option to short, so idk if I want to go the gdax route (unless y'all think it'd be good for me to start there). Right now I've seen Binance, Bitstamp, and Bittrex as good options. Thoughts? 
Thanks my dudes

I come on this site a lot to figure out where the price of Bitcoin is probably heading (you guys are actually a lot of help), and today at work I decided to try to figure out where I shouldn’t be surprised to see the price of Bitcoin end up.  I could be way off base but I figure a lot of the people on here know more than me and could set me straight if I’m wrong.

I looked at 8 commodites that had big run-ups and retracements over the past couple of decades, and I compared their most recent ATH to their most recent low and came up with the following high/low - percent of - estimated low Bitcoin value based on rounded ATH of 20k:

Oil 160 / 30.24 - 0.19 - 3800....
Gold 2200 / 370.4 - 0.17 - 3400....
Silver 113.2 / 5.95 - 0.05 - 1000....
Platinum 2180 / 787.2 - 0.36 - 7200....
Nat Gas 18.79 / 2.19 - 0.12 - 2400....
Wheat 12.8 / 3.88 - 0.30 - 6000....
Cotton 2.13 / 0.57 - 0.27 - 5400....
Copper 4.58 / 1.94 - 0.42 - 8400....

Some of these are either massive outliers or have already been invalidated (Silver - Platinum/Copper).

I used CMCs available data to look at the lowest low before the 2013 ATH: 1122.87 (11/30/13) / 76.89 (7/8/13), and the 0.2 fib retracement should have been 209.12...the actual retracement was 0.18 at 203.86 on 8/24/15.

If I set 203.86 as the 0 point and 20k as the top, my rough estimation puts the 0.2 fib at about 3959 which is about gold/oil.

Sorry for the crappy formatting and rough date/price estimations as I’m on mobile.  I got all of my data from macrotrends.net and CMC.  I also probably should have found 0 values for the commodities listed (to set 0.2 fib level) but I figured the percents of were good enough.

TL;DR-Based on other commodities’ retracements and 2014/2015, 4k doesn’t seem at all unreasonable to me.

Edit:  I think the TL;DR is earning me downvotes.  If you could provide direction as to why I’m wrong it would be appreciated.  I’m still trying to learn.
For those who like to follow ETF progress, CBOE did [file for a rule change]( http://cdn.batstrading.com/resources/regulation/rule_filings/pending/2018/SR-CboeBZX-2018-040.pdf) for that SolidX/VanEck BTC ETF few days ago (not yet on [SEC site](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/cboebzx.htm).) The amendment to the S1 registration itself didn't change much (see [these comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8p43rs/lets_discuss_the_new_bitcoin_etf_filed_by_vaneck/e08b78f/)), but at least there is a new rule change filing :) (so we can enjoy waiting a year of delays.)
Someone mentioned it earlier, the 6k range we are in now has basically been normalised. 

Last time we were there was mass panic at such a low number. Now today, well... it's just a lot calmer. We are used to it a hell of a lot more. 

And that ladies and gents is why this ain't bottom. Let's wait for that horrible panic moment again and see where the price ends up. 

I can see the first real panic stations if 5k breaks, then utter carnage should 4k go

First real bounce I am leaving the market and waiting a few months. There's no hope left. 
One huge indicator for when the long is good is mass panic.

When we were here the first and second times there was panic but now there isn’t panic. Now it feels like most of us are at acceptance which means lower is becoming the norm. That’s my strongest case for this going and staying lower. Stagnation feels like the new norm.

I commented that the only way BTC gets near 3.5k (or even the midpoint between 3.5k - 7.5k) is a slow bleed. The lack of panic here means there’s no bounce it seems.

With that said the lack of panic also means that buyers here are in it for the long haul. Most of us I would imagine are low to no leverage longing. That’s is most certainly the play here (so my call hasn’t changed) but you truly have to be willing to be patient now.

Shorters cant win forever but it seems as though they will for the time being.

Cool calm and collected accumulate here and below. Close your eyes and wait. You’ll end up owning coins that are super valuable in the coming future. There aren’t enough coins to continuously sell. The top addresses still hold about the same amounts and the die hards will rather own $1 BTC than sell it.

As an aside if we are dipping on shrinking volume can someone explain why selling volume would increase? Just a mass of longs closing? That will require a huge increase in selling pressure no?

Everyone here feels super rational in the grand scheme which makes me happy. We understand that the price going down is out of our control and it’s totally fine. 

EDIT: I will add also that sub 3k is not unreasonable if you consider the price compared to one year ago. My point overall though is the right answer here is to start layering in buys. I am fairly confident that if we dip into the 1k-5k range that’s it will be the last time*** BTC does this. Unless the thing breaks. So given that it is really a grand opportunity.
I have a feeling we're getting close to just breaking support and dropping off a cliff, indicators be damned.  Alts are plummeting, we're not getting remotely decent bounces anywhere... I think we're going to be hunting out a new low pretty soon.
Open shorts dropped 5% today with price not increasing longs back above 30k. That combined with us dicking around 6400 all day leads me to believe that we arn't getting a relief bounce and instead will be on a collision course with 6k within a day or two at most.
4hr candle about to close and give divergence similar to late May...lends creedence to another bear flag here

edit : on RSI 4Hr
I noticed this thread says there are weekly threads: [Newbie Mondays](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/search?q=newbie+monday&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all) and [Fundamental Fridays] (https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/search?q=fundamentals+friday&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all) but they don't actually exist :( Does this sub not really welcome newbies like me anymore?
Looks a bit like an Adam & Eve bottom on the 15m chart. A bit narrow of a timeframe, but still. Interesting. Mobile currently, but I'm babysitting my short as best I can.
This is obviously no Bart movement, this time it's different.
On the bright side, I have a lot more crypto than I did a month ago. 

On the not so bright side, I have a lot less fiat and my job hunt is taking much longer than expected lol.
Bids filled, bitcoins on the way to cold storage and they won't see exchanges until end of September.

Thanks bears!  


EDIT: How can anyone sell with RSI at 26? Read some investment/trading books.
Here is an analysis of price using the Wyckoff Method: https://i.imgur.com/mGYH6Az.png

Ignoring my 'you are here', this is phase B until proven otherwise.  ;)  What we want to see is a bounce here without major red volume. Then we can long support and risk off a lower low. Right now we've made lower lows without a large amount of volume, which is good sign. But there's no bounce yet. For all we know, tomorrow could be a high volume bear day.

Here is a tutorial on the Wyckoff Method: http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:market_analysis:the_wyckoff_method

For fun, here is a look at the bear market in 2013-2014 using Wyckoff: https://www.tradingview.com/x/IcSwLkZI/

Here is a look at a possible descending triangle in making:  https://www.tradingview.com/x/UQbhpXv5/

Here is my Point and Figure Chart, posted earlier today: https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8qphc3/daily_discussion_wednesday_june_13_2018/e0ly0v8/

By the way, I am /u/joyrider5, proof on my twitter: https://twitter.com/joyrider50/status/999774124259004416 Sadly I lost control over my account so will be posting on this one for now on.
A majority of my portfolio is from 2017. Going to have to drop Btc to 1000, Eth to 120, and ltc to 45 from me to get scared. If that happens, I'll be so scared that my life savings will go into Btc, eth, and ltc equally. 

Put it to you this way, all of this short-mid term action is all noise to me. Occasionally when there is more bloodshed than usual, like lately this week, I add more to portfolio.  I'm not selling for 1-3 years minimum. 

The reason I hodl is because I'm not smart enough to trade daily, I tried bitmex testnet and did awful. I felt like I was up against a AI that was always one step ahead. Also, check out bitmex reckt twitter stream. Good luck to ya brave traders.
Closed my 25x revenge long with 2% loss instead of losing 75% capital after flag break reading the comments of people who replied to my post. Thanks all who replied. Clearly I am not in right mindset, a trading break it is. Good luck all! 
So, like, what happens is this holds? 
Adding to my short here, short term target of 5800, then 5200 - S/L above 7k.

EDIT:

Reasons being lack of upwards movement despite shorts closing, RSI being over double on the 4 hour from what it was on Sundays dump. Not seeing any zip in buying here.
Holy cow. Shorted hard from 6400 right before the drop and almost set stops at break even. What is going on? Gonna hold on tight.
Wow this Market is a thrill
Closed my shorts from this morning and managed to catch a couple of 10x longs at ~6150, totally lucky that my orders hit just as I was entering them...it looked kind of intense on the selling so i took a shot
Good luck out there
Reentered the falling wedge and ran into its resistance. Breakout could take us up to 6700

https://www.tradingview.com/x/rQ6JqdJs/

edit: broke out
I know i will get crushed for this but i have to say it.  People selling in this range in the spot market are really stupid. This is just as ridiculous as buying when it was $19k ..  What it is we are now a species of FOLLOWERS .. that's why people don't buy low sell high they are usually just following. I kid you not volatility is caused by the sheep effect.
The coming months will be hard for all those who entered Q3/Q4 2017 and Q1 2018 and are not experienced with BTC bear markets. 
**Are you not entertained!!?**

Now as we are breaking the 6.4K support that I see as a point of no return for the bulls I think capitulation is near.
[deleted]
Believe it or not, a chart posted on /r/cryptocurrency today actually caught my eye.

It's possible to view the entire market from the initial crash to 6k and on as wyckoff accumulation. May do a longer write up on the possibility once I'm free, also touching on it as redistribution. At a quick glance both fit pretty well.
Wow, the volume we just had on a recent hourly candle was even bigger than what we saw during our big drop from a couple of days ago: https://imgur.com/1iqxSEw

We haven't seen a volume spike like that since early April.
[deleted]
Almost 29k shorts now... 6k+ in just a few days..seriously what is wrong with people -- the fomo is fucking unreal in crypto, completely driven by emotions..we're probably just gonna end up rocketing up to 7-8k again then sideways for another month before we die for real, again :/   
Not going to 5k like this for sure, this fomo is really annoying because its going to take the recovery way longer when everyone is fomoing in each direction

I am long for a further bounce, but just how much of a bounce am I even going for?   I just don't see it bouncing that far.  

But the chart says oversold, so I will make the same mistake I have made repeatedly over the past couple of months.  I can't help it.
Few thoughts. 1 - the price would not drop if people didn't think it would drop. 2 - once everybody believes it will drop, there is nobody left selling. 3 - the price changes direction the balance of buyers and sellers tilts.

As a LTH, never thought I'd be buying at $6.5k. But here I am, week after week, adding something like 1% to my crypto stack every couple weeks. I'm losing money, that's for sure. But then again, I also did when BTC ATH'd at $1200 and I kept buying all the way down.

I think the bears are wrong, and I'm not here to convince you of it either. I'm speaking with my money. Don't upvote this post because I don't want newbs to throw caution to the wind. But I believe in the fundamentals just as much as I did in December, if not more. I love that we are over $5k while nobody is buying.


Just wait till they do. Until then, thanks for the opportunity to fix my only regret from December, which was not buying enough before December.
As far as I can see people are divided into two sides: those who say it will directly continue downwards, and those who wait for a short squeeze. I'm in the short squeeze camp here. Yeah it's too obvious yadda yadda, but still. What will decide between these two pathways is whether the shorts that opened after the breakdown are "smart" shorts or "stupid" FOMO shorts. I'm inclined towards the latter as smart shorts could have opened while we were still inside the triangle.

Also as it's a bear market I find it likely that the market will want to test the former support as resistance before continuing downward. There is a great liquidity pool up there and BTC love those liquidity pools.

And if you're into fractals, someone in Twitter has posted [this](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DeXn2EPWkAEgSii.jpg:large) and [this](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DeKWiC1W4AAUFaY.jpg:large). Note the similarity with the current situation with BTC, and also note that in each case except silver the support gets retested after the breakdown. But of course maybe this will proceed like silver, who knows.

As a side note, from a Wyckoffian point of view I think right now it's neither accumulation nor distribution. Just middle of nowhere.
Guess I'm getting nothing more done today at work.
Some volatility is nice to see but these aren’t fireworks...

Summer of pain isn’t here yet. 

The fact that I’m talking bearish (for now) is probably enough. This is set up to keep bleeding and bleeding. 
[CRAB-17 Stage II](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8qt5sd/crab17_stage_ii/) has been initiated. 

Wojak Index is indicating General Sentiment: Suicidal
What do you think caused BTC to rise from the bottom in mid September 2015 at around $228?
Friendly reminder that the kraken 2k BTC wall is still on 5250EUR (6142,5$), so the chances of bouncing around there are high.
We just saw a 4.8 on the RSI. Some guys are panicking
This is like watching Hollyfield and Ali fight. Exciting!
Got wrecked on September liquidity. That wick was insane.

!short close xbtu18 6418

I also FOMO 25x'd the 6400 breakdown on swaps and set a stop at 6350 after 6300 fell, which also executed. Went from +0% to +18% to +3% stack, which was my final gain on those two. Shit is way to volatile here, and I'm not going to touch September again. 

My June position is untouched. I'll look to re-short 6300-6350 on on swaps, assuming it gets there in any sort of a sane way.


Lol, I just checked the results of the poll, we are at break even: [https://imgur.com/a/Aev7cNl](https://imgur.com/a/Aev7cNl)
https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/

I was surprised to see the index isn't as low as in Feb. and April.  I guess you just kind of get numb to it after a while.


With coinbase index fund just starting and other  bitcoin/crypto infrastructure investments being made.... doesn't it seem like a coincidence that bitcoin is dropping to make people panic and sell.... ...i'm not saying it won't go lower,  the lower it goes the better deal the big investors can get.  
If this chops sideways and stays under $7000 for a few days that's one of the worst things for the bulls in my mind.

The most bullish setup would be a steep dive below support and then a rapid markup in price on volume but I don't see that happening through my goblin town\-colored glasses.
Re-openining here.

!short XBTUSD 6300 5x 20%

I'll add at 6400ish and bail over 6500. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/IbgrGgJj/
If this actually climbs back up I will never trade again, fuck me. 
Alts about to take BTC to goblin town. I’m not in any leveraged position and my cold storage is not feeling well but I’m entertained and have fiat ready for special circumstances. Bring it on crypto gods!
The previous low of 6425 made in late March was breached earlier today.  6k is the absolute local low since ATHs, it is almost a foregone conclusion that it will be tested before any kind of serious rise will happen.  I will look to add a small long position for a bounce at 6k when this inevitably occurs, this will be the true double bottom test.
You can basically justify booth long and short at this point,


Long: Based on the last months it is the bottom and will reverse somewhere above 6000

Short: Its a new low and will continue going down based on the last weeks and the bad news.

Choose one..

16k BTC have moved from this account. 
So this may or may not be pertinent, but current round of Cboe XBT Futures expire [*today*](https://cryptocalendar.pro/event/4211).
If this bounce is legit, I'll be looking to close my long and open up short around 6.8\-7k.

It all comes down to two numbers... (Binance)

- 6430 
- 6000

for all our collective talk of oh 9k is the big one or, 8200 or 7750.. it really just comes down to those two now, not much else matters.

Our big supports have come and gone, our TA lines have been munched through and forgotten. All eyes on the prize now, should those two break then it's goblin town and that brand new low hardly anyone really wants to see is going to happen and likely hard.

Seeing as there is room on the daily RSI and room on practically all indicators to fall further in price, I would love to see that big bounce from 6k and then through the big resistance to end the bear market but realism must take hold. 

It's more likely now we'll break below 6k to find that new low. How low? well i'd hazard a guess at the upper 4k range based on support but I don't really know. Optimism in this market has been a killer so i'll just take it as it comes. 

We have been above the weekly Ichimoku Cloud since 17th October 2016, we are now getting dangerously close to crossing under it, current Ichimoku support is at 5k however a few more weeks of slow bleed and that moves to roughly 6k. I do not want us under that cloud, it would be fucking grim and a terrible sign.

Are we going to be sitting here in 2 months looking up at 6k like it's some heady dream whilst we languish at 2.5k bemoaning the death of Bitcoin as the bear market continues a pace? Fair chance perhaps, although God I hope not. Talk about a depressing summer.

Anywho, playing the positive hand...the important optimistic numbers for the future in terms of getting out of the bear market for me, 

- TA line resistance from ATH sitting in and around 8300 currently
- Breaking above the Ichimoku Daily cloud around 9300 currently

At least those numbers will go down with us if we fall through the floor :)


more great news for tether... now on bloomberg. 

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-13/professor-who-rang-vix-alarm-says-tether-used-to-boost-bitcoin


Was very tempted to close my shorts there, but looking at the [volume](https://i.imgur.com/AfbbKE7.png) I'm not convinced this is **the** bottom. It also still hasn't re-tested the $5800 area.

Maybe I'm being greedy and I'll regret it, but I'm going to be patient a while longer.
This morning I kept myself busy reading back the r/BitcoinMarkets dailies from April 1 to April 12. The resemblance is astonishing. Bears talking the price down with exotic predictions and convincing charts, bulls struggling to keep faith holding their coins. Most posts were about short positions, bear flags, sell walls, crosses of death, sub\-zero levels and even the suicide hotline was mentioned for the fun of it. In the meantime the short selling continued as if the only way was down... until the shorts exceeded the longs. That is where we saw the bottom and the run\-up to the short\-squeeze started.
Tether fud is here again, idiots showing up and calling for 1k, signs of short term trend exhaustion, finex shorts closing out, we're getting close to a relief rally of some sorts imo.
hey guys I was telling you [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8qfytx/daily_discussion_tuesday_june_12_2018/e0kg1vw/) about some new good news for tether... here it is as promised in the new york times.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/13/technology/bitcoin-price-manipulation.html?partner=IFTTT


Most likely looks like its goin down again. Dont fall for it. Waiting for 6100
Is this a triple bottom i'm seing on the 1D chart ?
The only thing that’s exciting at the moment is that /u/Sloppysynapses ‘s poll of 5999 vs 10k is closing in on a resolution 
My best guess is yet another multi-day bearflag before another push down...hard to say how high we can get in the short-term but I am keeping my longs open just in case...

Peace and good trading 
All I have to say is be very careful shorters. Dont forget tesla. 
Crazy...[we retraced the whole candle and now back in the wedge.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/5v0DY8EG/) 
Don't we need a 500\-1000$ bounce in 15 minutes to call it the traditional bitcoin bounce.. or may be this is the new way of being.
My guess is that the volume came from bulls defending this trend channel. We smashed through the bottom so I think this is futile and buyers will let go if this continue down.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/jHhOr9mO/
https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/gTC450GM-Wyckoff-accumulation-and-Phases-Update/

Hopium maybe but I like it. Thoughts?
Hammer time!
Is anybody here shorting at this point?
anyone members FUD waves making rounds after gox crash? we're only good when we get immune to FUD. it just doesn't seem to be the case. i think this is going to be a long one. 
Again, same pattern like the last 4 huge dumps. Falling wedge and spike up a little, then few hours later it gets dumped on. Will revisit 6k4 again and break straight through and test 6k2. expecting anothor 3% to 4% drop today or tomorrow.
so much for that descending wedge
[Fell off the wedge](https://www.tradingview.com/x/oWLW4Dpb/)... target is $5.9k which is good r:r for a long.  If $5.9 falls, I'll reverse trade. 
what a rollercoaster, today is going to be interesting 
closing my short here (along with a lot of folks I'm guessing) after that bounce to retrace the entire last dump. Closed around 6275 from 6550 with 100% 5x leverage. 
Any clues as to why ETH would recover so quickly from that last drop and not BTC?
If the daily rsi won't bounce from 30 maybe the 2 day will.
Another dip, another poll:  [https://strawpoll.com/fy229cgz](https://strawpoll.com/fy229cgz)

I would like to know what you are into at the moment. Fiat, crypto or both?
Crazy to think that you could hve shorted anywhere between mid November to now and unless you shorted on Feb 6th in a (maybe) 12 hour time frame, you would have more Bitcoin than you have now
Someone already mentioned the wyckoff similarities. Worth paying attention to now.

Current range we're in since the original 6k crash looks similar to the range we were in after the crash to $1XX.

No guarantees it plays out this way, ^(but the next few days are critical TM) and bulls could have a nice long opportunity on the post\-spring test.

Charts: [https://imgur.com/a/LYbag69](https://imgur.com/a/LYbag69)
With everyone seemingly in a deep hole, it's time to start looking up again ;) 
Just entered a short position on BTC at 6500. 5x with half the stack. I figure if we get rejected here it's bearish as fuck, and I can stop loss at 6700. 

Don't forget the overall trend is down, and 6500 has been pretty important historically. One green candle isn't going to change my outlook here. 
 Lost my entire trading stack in this downswing because of poor risk management. Decided to sell some of my shitcoins on binance and use them to long 25x as the final gamble. The reason being bullish div on 4hr and April low support. If this breaks through 6400, goblin town is confirmed and I will take a long trading break. 

!long XBTUSD 25x 6570 5%

Stops around 6400
Wow \- this thing has no legs, really. My buy order got filled at 6410 and was hoping to wake up to testing 6500 rn..Will hold.. 

I'm a buyer and I'm loyal to you, BTC.. I don't have enough money to push you up :( Sorry, my love.. I've never seen you, but I love you..
Finex has printed a lower low (barely) from its April 1st bottom.

Edit--we now have a lower high and a lower low coming from the 11.7k double top
I have BTC bouncing from the [20k downtrend](https://imgur.com/a/u1rJTh2)

Can someone confirm on their charts?

This puts us in a descending wedge between the 20k downtrend and the 10k downtrend. Apex should be around 5500, but i doubt it gets there, and since this wedge is so steep, it can only break upward somewhere until 5500
Well this is interesting 
what a show haha, i love bitcoin 
Opened a long here. ETH ratio reversing after double bottoming, the rebound volume and follow up higher lows coupled with how long we've been dumping and still being roughly at  historical support levels makes the r/r worth it to me here. Target isn't anything insane, 6.6k with an outside chance of retouching 7k to test the support turned resistance of the old big triangle.  CA 6250 with SL at 6135 (we make a lower post-rebound low).
[deleted]
I just started using Bitmex and need some help understanding it. I did a short sell and my PNL Unrealized showed +20% ROE. I closed it at market price right then but my wallet still shows the same amount of XBT as before the trade.. why?
Time to long this is when we take out all the stops and liquidations sub 6k. That's the best place if you guys want to catch the knife. But it's gonna take some balls to press that buy button at those levels.
I can't take this anymore, I'm going full fiat. I'll buy back at 4k, I don't care if that takes a month or 5 months to get there. Done with this for now, time to relax for the first time in weeks. 
I think people are realising that NEO is not a decentralized blockchain. 
Bring on the firesale already. I'm ready to go catching knives. 


I'm sitting on the sidelines since March waiting for this moment. Going to give it one more week before going all in. I had set myself a Target and it's almost there.

If then it goes down, fuck it. I go down with it.
Is it possible to identify which exchanges lead selling and which follow? Kraken?
i'm sensing that new drop incoming.. getting ready.

Eurgh
Wow. Great time to get locked out of GDAX for 24 hours because I was switching between computers and clicked the wrong authorization link. Anyone know if it's even worth it to submit a ticket, or will that take a week to get a response?
Has anyone else gone from long term bullish to long term perma bear? Am I being too emotional about it or are these just not good signs in general.
Meh, we all know that at some point the low price will adapt to everyone. Asap it goes up again near EOY, fomo will kick in again. It hasn't been different any other year. 

Al-tough this year might rise and drop on different time frames since so many people knows about the January sell off now. I don't think we've reached true capitalisation yet. Entering is too hard for the "normal" people. We've only just begun.


Opened a scalp long from $6368

This line held for now ( or bottom of wedge support) 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/tZYzEJQq/

Don’t plan on holding this for very long, unless we just blast through $6600. Otherwise in an out like Flynn for a quick profit 
so close to 6k\- it's hard for me to believe that we can have a genuine rally upwards without breaking below it at least a little bit. impressive bounce for now off of 6100 though...
Closed short from 6400 at 6280, can't sleep with this fuckery. 
Rebound was over 1.5k longs opening coupled with some shorts (likely scalps opened on the breakdown) closing, we'll see how confident those bad boys are. 

Some of those longs are already closing again. 
Last few days reminds of this, IF.

...

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!

...


5 out of the last 6 weekly candles have been red. The last time that happened was in 2015, when the price dipped down to 163 on Bitfinex, which is the lowest price in the last 4+ years.  

So maybe another DCB is called for soon, but could go lower before that.
After today, it wouldn't be a bad trade to try and scalp a long. More recently, after a TD buy 5 count on the daily, selling pressure has eased back to test buying power. Regardless of the magnitude, we *should* see a bounce here.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/S4mEMkNm/
Traders closing your shorts, why? Is it just because you feel a bounce is impending? I feel after 6400 broke, and even after the bounce from 6100-6300 we’re destined to retest 6k very soon. 
So, the daily RSI has reached its lowest point this year if I'm not mistaken. Its obvious this is going down further, but how much can the RSI take before producing a bounce. Got stopped out of my long last night and am waiting before i set up another position. Still bearish but entering a short now seems like a bad idea.
300 btc sell wall (real) on Binance at 6350 \- That's massive for Binance.

Update, nibbled away and now the price is on the up. I guess there's buyers....
Crazy resist at 6.6k. It was serving as fairly strong support for a couple of days, so it makes sense that it's turning into stiff resistance now.. I said I wouldn't be surprised waking up to 6.7-6.8k, but we may range from 6.45-6.6 for a bit longer it seems.

I joined cryptotwitter just a few months ago. It's the only social media platform I've ever been on. There's been an abundance of 'influencers' who made 'great calls' during the bull run and capitalized on it by reeling in newbs and suckers into their paid groups. Now a few of them are saying to "refrain off the suicide jokes because they are getting DMs from people in really bad situations" Oh boy, if this market completely tanks, a lot of these 'influencers' are going to have some blood on their hands. 
So did the triple bottom fail? At what price can we conclusively say that the triple bottom is not a triple bottom?
6.3k is long term (1week graph) major support. We're in for a very hard bounce if it drops lower than that. Otherwise we'll just be sideways at the current price for a few more days
Closed long for a small loss.

That’s just annoying. 

Apparently BTC gives 0 fucks for wedge support and divergents 
As I was typing shit went down.

This is my target since falling wedge broke to the downside. Purple box.

Good luck everyone.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/VmzFFZph/

Well, the logic move here is to long @5251 on BTCEUR on kraken with stops below 5249
Lots of hard\-core buy\-side support going down to 6k but not an insubstantial amount of coins for sale up to $6400 either. Let's see if the price can rally above there for starters. If not, looks like we'll have to endure some more trench\-warfare style grind out as we slowly head lower. So many were bought on the original 6k bounce from ATH\- I think the longer we linger in this price area, the more anxious and uneasy they will become. Will be interesting to see if all holders can stand firm in this area or will they start falling out of ranks as the panic/fear increase...
Daily SRSI just hit the "oversold" level.  Not a great reversal signal in itself though, as last time it was oversold it stayed there for almost 2 weeks.  Also, this recent drop made a sizable new low from the previous April low.  Lastly, we got within ~$200 of the previous low for this entire bear market.  I wonder if we break a new low in the coming days/weeks to properly shake out people...
From my gut feeling I think it is very likly we see a V\-Bottom if we go sub 6k. Maybe below 5k, maybe to 5.5k or just to 5.7k or so. The best might be to just place orders now and to hope they get filled and price does not declines much more. In the end it is luck..
Here's an interesting one for the bulls that I could possibly see playing out but I need to read up more on hyperwave. If anyone has been following them it would be interesting to get your input.

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/yGGnFaHS-BTC-Hyperwave-2020/
I correctly anticipated shakeout. But I expected something like 6200 max.. not of this magnitude..

https://www.tradingview.com/x/FLqP8ytW/

I'm expecting a short-term bounce here. 3m OBV keeps going up.. Long avg entry aruond 6240


imagine if it doesn't break 6k?  That'd be awesome
I expected a much more violent drop. Guess people’s buy orders are getting filled. Just a bit more time and then we’ll see the plummet. 
Can everyone please just stop with the FUD? Even coinmarketcap is spreading FUD showing the price in the 6000s when anyone who isn't a moron knows the actual price is 20,000.

Had enough of all this FUD.
In the Daily mail bitcoin article today people were commenting bitcoin is a Ponzi, tulip bulbs and a scam. This could mean we're near a bottom. So I'm accumulating these dips. 
MOON
Are you a man or a mouse?

Long now.
BCash idiots now think that [Bitcoin Markets has been compromised](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8qqcbr/mods_at_rcryptocurrency_have_censored_the_post/e0lgjxg/). The conspiracies never end! :)
Don't worry Wall Street gets their bonuses next week. Shits gonna pump
In trading, most of the time, the ideal course of action to take is completely unclear.     However, there are rare moments in which the correct position is readily apparent, and *then you must strike.*  
Bear flags until we get a capitulation. When you see $400 15m candles that's when it's time to get positioned long (short time frame)

Edit: and a great time to buy and hold spot if u r looking to add to your position. DCA out on the way up, DCA in on the way down. 
looks like someone has started stop loss hunting 
Some Hopium for the Bulls:



The volume on the hourly suggest that 6.2-6.3 range has much stronger support than all previous levels. This looks like it could be a great long entry. If I wasn't fully in position already (to go long) this would be the range where I'd be re-entering all positions. 
A little bounce from the heavy support at 6k1 and a bit of Fomo is driving the price atm. No still major buy, expecting this to sideways until tomorrow before another major drop and probably break 6k1 this time.
2014: https://www.tradingview.com/x/hpebJA2v/

2018: https://www.tradingview.com/x/QBDTkx3n/

I tried to be jokeful, saying that I came from the future and got downvoted to oblivion.

If you look at 2014 chart, you will see that after rejection from 200DMA (PURPLE), it broke the low, went down A LOT without making much of a bounce before making a huge dead cat bounce. I projected the same for 2018, making use of the ratio of the red rectangle. (So I think it's a possibility that we might not see much of a bounce even in 5k range) The deadcat bounce is about 70% from bottom to top, which coincides with 8200~8300 resistance.

As for the absolute bottom, I also made use of the ratio in red. (It should be around 2900's to be exact, but give me a break. Maybe it will make an instant wick)

I don't think the actual playout will be that much different from this chart. Whales have to accumulate. And they need this sort of graph..
!short BTCUSD 7600 add  10X

!short BTCUSD 6600 add  10X

I seem to have forgotten to update previous added leverage. But anyways adding leverage to my short here and will add more if we go up. I just dont belive in any bounce here above 7K so up till then I will be adding every 100$ and will reevaluate at 7K.
Another gut feeling.

Market behaves like it's about to drop. No buying pressure, just some buy orders just because we're at 6.5, 15m bband were tight and are stretching down.

The 'feeling' says down soon. But don't trade on this.
Expecting this evil wick before finally bouncing a bit:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/FLqP8ytW/

because.. whales are evil. Placing long order at 6260
How much pop does this 4h bull div have to it, gents? Is it going to bang or fizzle?
Due to a previous request I've turned off my miners as apparently it's going to cause a bounce like the last time I did it.

I'm willing to entertain anything tbh.
price will begin to go up when there are about 30% of the amount of comments here and cryptotwitter stops tweeting and crypto youtubers stop making videos and paid chat groups are empty. 
ascending wedge on the 15m
Damn, it feels good to be back in.  Been sitting in fiat for far too long.
Sentiment in this sub is as bearish as I've seen in a while. Guess it's time to update my flair ;). 
Literally calling family, friends, and even neighbors to jump in right now at these prices! Wonderful opportunity nab up as much crypto as possible for a long term investment. I want more Btc, eth, and ltc but I've already added as much as I can in expendable fiat multiple times this week.

/u/haserfauld

Did that little pump break through the descending resistance line you had drawn or just wick above it? Can't check at the moment but I remember it sitting around 6320.
I expect one or two more little ten-minute dumps, largely bought up like the last one, then a lightly green bull phallus on Friday, not unlike the one we saw in April, possibly even bigger.
I did like 3 fib trend retracements from the 3 highs, using the corrective waves as reference and came up with three major support levels 4,9k, 3,5k and 1,2k and i think we gonna hit first of those end of this month and last some time later this year

Short term bounce from 6k (smaller top retracement level) seems likely
Major pain and despair these days= smart money now buying
There's no buying pressure at all. 6.4k will break, which will bring us much, much lower. Shorting now is basically free money.
Sounds like everyone is agreeing that we're going lower. That makes me wary... the permabulls' spirits around here sound broken. Anyone short right now might want to take profits and be careful in the coming days - shorts just had a steep runup, and historically that's usually been followed by a squeeze. I don't think we'll see a BGD quite like we did in April, but a short-lived pop is what I'm watching for. Finex BTCUSDSHORTS isn't quite to all time high but there are about 30k shortsold now. 40k shortsold is the record there. Longs/Shorts ratio is 1.1057; when we see that dip below 1, the odds of a squeeze get higher as market sentiment piles on the sell-side. I think it'll be a weak squeeze since fewer people are playing, but I think there will be some sort of up-move soon.

Longs are still paying shorts on BitMex but that's flipped a couple times in the past couple days, which indicates that we might be near an inflection point for the stop hunters.

1D RSI is showing oversold on BTCUSD as well - while that doesn't mean there isn't more downside, it does mean the end of this dip is in sight and we're due for a temporary up-correction. *Daytraders who buy on indicators will likely give this some temporary life.* The question is how much. I'm guessing we'll see a pullback up to maybe 6800-7200 range in the coming week (assuming we hold above the February low of 5990 for now). That would have the effect of shaking out the 6600 shorters who piled on after the big move this weekend, and would make a short a lot more attractive to me. Based on how the buying action cools off if we get up there, I'll probably short again with intent to hold that until we've had a real capitulation event and breached the February low.
Well sympathies with anyone still in BTC/crypto in general.

This is pretty spectacular to watch.
Hey guys just moved all my Bitcoin to BitMEX and I'm about to open a cross-margin 100x short for all that free money, but I have a couple of questions.   
   
JK, I have moved a little bit to do some hedging but never used BitMEX before. My questions are these:   
   
1. I don't quite get where the funding of leveraged contracts come from.   
Let's say there are two traders on the exchange: me and Joe. I move 1 BTC to the exchange and open a 5 BTC short with 5x leverage. On the other side of the trade is Joe who opened a 5 BTC long with his 1 BTC. Bitcoin goes 10% down. I cover my position with 50% profit of 0.5 BTC and Joe ends up with 0.5 BTC left. That's fine.   
Now lets say I let it ride and Bitcoin keep going down, say 30%. At 20% Joe gets liquidated to pay my 1 BTC profit, but I keep my position opened and Bitcoin keeps dropping. I close at 30% to get 1.5 BTC. Where does the remaining 0.5 BTC come from? All that was ever deposited on the exchange by me and Joe is 2 BTC, how do I end up with 2.5 BTC?   
   
2. What contracts do you guys trade on BitMEX? I get an impression that most people use perpetual, but to me, especially for longer time frame swing trading, futures make more sense as there is no interest. Am I missing something here? (I know about premium which is sort of like a hidden interest, but in a longer time frame futures should still be cheaper right?)
At what price do you Guys think some miners will start shutting down? 4k?
closed out underwater spot long here at break even, may rebuy on a test of 6280 or if 6400 is support
Pardon the noob question, but is there a way to include referenced values in tradingview alert emails? For example, if I setup an email for when a MACD crosses over, is there a away to include the value of one of the signal lines in the alert email?
...bottom shorters, you guys are too late to the party. I suggest you put that really tight stop loss.
I wonder why the news of tether+manipulation is exactly out the same day BTC is going to break the weekly support?

Some people want cheap BTC ?
Ahahaha, the google trends chart was the one to watch !
Some hopium

[https://imgur.com/a/3qm6zxN](https://imgur.com/a/3qm6zxN)
I just dont think bears give up so close to a new low! they will make this sub 6k dip and then we see if we get a panic or if we dip back up! buying now is not wise imho. RSIs blabla, look on the way up where they went, 3d RSI to 95 etc. 
I'm strangely excited about the market although my stack is worth less every day. Just received 'the bitcoin standard' book. So better exclude me from your market sentiment analysis - there will be no despair for me, only a new possible buying opportunity. Have a nice day, folks!

Edit:typo
I don't get how people can close their shorts here. Market Makers are bleeding this market, probably even using leverage position, because they know this will tank and cool down much lower.

Look at every chart on CMC, bottoms are not made of wicks. It's a slow bleed and stagnation, Why would BTC be different?

Right now market makers are emptying the bulls before pushing the price down and letting the market below the 6k support. At this point people will not know where the bottom is and the slowbleed will start until we hit that stagnation phase. 

Right now is the time to short. People longing are basically hoping for a BGD to save their asses, and that's not coming.

We destroyed the previous low with no volume and no bounce. I mean what other sign do we need.
[deleted]
ETH doesn't look good and is dragging btc down 
Thank goodness we have interested parties attempting to prop BTC up.
I keep getting burned trying to time these bounces, but just have to try again with a small long here.  It's just been too steep and fast of a fall from $7700 and this would be a natural place for a solid bounce up to near $7000 at least.
This sub is slowly degenerating like ethtrader a whole back:/
Hey everyone, I've been reading and watching videos on how to use Bitmex. I figured I should learn how to open short/long positions as it'll be another tool to use.

Anyway, are there people on Trading View etc who I should follow? I am using the Testnet until I get competent at this. 
Daily RSI is below 30 for the first time since FEB 6 (Bitfinex).
I'm surprised nobody is discussing the SEC discussion going on right now. Bitcoin is not a security, but ICOs or Ethereum being considered security will significantly impact BTC as well. It is a cause for concern, and it's not looking good to be frank.
Ok so here's where we are at, this is the moment of truth. We need to hold above 6500. Also we need to see a BGD with good volume very soon. This will confirm the triple bottom and actually be quite bullish. Otherwise it will break down. My first target is 5k. Then who knows after that 4k? 3k? 1k? All possibilities of a new bottom. Also it could take a while to hit the actual bottom. We may not see 7k again until next year.
Going full\-fiat. SO expect price to stop dropping.
Closed my short at 6574. 6 hour and lower timeframes are looking alright now and I think we could go up against the trend so holding the short feels risky. Not going long yet though.  
Edit: You know what maybe just a small long. 
I feel like it's time for a large upwards Bart.
How can I create a bitmex 'Sell Market' order and set a stop loss of x%?

How can I set a stop loss at all with Bitmex?
Are we going to have a bounce (even if tiny) before crashing, or just a flatline?
Serious question... Where are the buyers waiting at? We keep getting these sell/short the bounce type of action, but not quite any sustained buying for awhile.  Is it just a trader's market now or something?

EOSBTC and ETHBTC (and some other alts) are breaking through some old downtrends right now. 

BTCUSD might follow.
I believe for any faith to be restored it needs to go sideways for a while .. I don’t even think a bgd will invoke fomo ..in fact - it will be signs of a bull trap as we’re down $1000 in the passed week almost.  If we fall right now we will fall hard.. thankfully I’m getting better at trading *touches wood so I’m out for now waiting to get back in. 
everyone is expecting a BGD... something tells me they may not happen if everyone expects them.

the last big short squeeze was fake, the shorts were all wash traded to make it look like a short squeeze (like what happened just before BCH distribution in august 2017 when shorts went from like 8k to 40k in 3 days when prices were flat)

not so sure if they will do the same exact thing again because everyone is expecting it this time. 


Whales are shorting the market. They will bleed everyone dry until their target is reached.

Whatever your plan is, I think using indicators such as shorts volume and oversold RSI is what will burn people until speculators are out of money.
Well, on the bright side, my net worth calculated in BTC is now more BTC than I originally bought.

See you at 3500 in August.
Can someone explain to me exactly how we will ever get back to 10K or 15K??  Seriously.. if everyone here is looking to make there money back, they are going to not hold and sell way before 10K...  i just cant see new money coming in at those prices.. and without new money, the price will never rise.   I mean, here we are talking about it one day hitting 20K, 30K and so forth, which at one point i was as hopeful as the rest of you, but i dipped out when it dropped to 7700 a few weeks ago, which was my break even point, and don't plan to get back in.   It was a nice, hopeful run, but I am really starting to believe the doubters that it's just a ponzi scheme. I HATE to use that term, and I was always telling people, you don't know what you are talking about, and I was defending btc left and right, but my sentiment has changed completely about btc.  I just can't see a reason why it would ever get to those levels again.  Look, If you are a holder, then I really wish you the best of luck.  I may be completely wrong, and if I am, then you will make money, and I won't see those profits.  The only thing I am happy about is that I sold at my break even point.  Good luck getting to your moon <-- I'm serious about that!!

Curious if we'll bounce off 6k hard
Hmmmmm guys.... Where is the kraken wall?

Someone remembered they had it laying there and removed it?
Still holding my shorts, for those looking to short: [if this breaks](https://i.imgur.com/q5A81kH.png) this is probably a good moment to jump in.
[removed]
ITT: people that need to zoom out. Even if the price goes to 3k, bitcoin has still seen ridiculous growth over the past 3 years let alone its entire existence. I know this is a trading sub, so no one really cares about the longer term proposition, but yeah... lots of doom and gloom lately.

This is a great time to accumulate more before the next bull market. 

Sometimes patience is the greatest trade strategy you can have.
what, no suicide line sticky yet? too early to rebuy i figure. 
In case anyone was wondering if I'm worried about my long from 6600, the answer is a resounding no. I smell bearwhale blubber simmering in a tasty stew of capitulation. If you thought the dip was big, wait until this guy buys back.
Going long here, we're at good support and I see the [trend changing](https://snag.gy/XBM45n.jpg).  Not a real tight stop, I'll let it breath a little but I see it going up soon. 
Everyone is just waiting for a eventual drop below 6k at this point, before even considering to rebuy (including me). So it's likely we will now see a slow bleed to 6k (or below) and once we go there \- a strong bounce.

Its really not surprising we dont have any buying pressure at this point.
I'm going to begin scaling into a small short-term long as we approach $6k.  While this is definitely going lower in my mind in the mid-term, our prior low as it intersects with the log line should provide some real price support.  1D RSI will approach ~25 range.

[Chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/z61zw14N/)  

It's interesting to note that there hasn't been one instance in BTC history where price moved back under ATH log support... not to say it's impossible this go around, but I suspect we'll get some kind of a bounce here. 

Safe trades
Call me crazy! temporary bottom coming in soon. 4hr oscilators  looks like it wants to diverge. Off course , price needs to reverse first. imo soon it will happen with even maybe a wick on  the next  4hr reversal candle. While major timeframes are still bearish, i believe a bounce is upon us to at least 6800. ( disclaimer) Don't take this extremely risky trade of mine as advice.

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/kmqBeUDm/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/kmqBeUDm/)
nice mini capitulation with the falling wedge breakdown. i got in too early (6350), but this looks like the start of the relief rally to me. i think 6750 looks like a nice target, we'll have to see though
Can you short on Binance? 
Going long here-- we need a retrace to at least 6700 (if not higher) before any chance of any downside. 
DAE get delirious looking at the order books and pretend a battle is going on? Like Total War Rome. 
Bitcoin, it was fun while it lasted. RIP and good bye

Interesting point about shift in BTC distribution between holders and short term speculators.. the lower the price goes, the higher the shift?
This drop makes me wish I liquidated more coins, but then I think I would have FOMO bought and been worse off

I don't feel so shit its dropping anymore though :)
Hello, I came from the future:

Just as everyone feared, the "unbreakable" 6k breaks, a massive panic sell ensues, and the price free-falls to 4800 at lightning speed. Then at that point, BTC makes a strong bounce to 7200. Then it retraces to 5500, confirming it as support, and ends up bouncing to 8300. Just when everyone is filled with elation that the bear market is over, BTC fails to break the resistance and there is a selling climax all the way down to 3k. After that, there is a 5-month range bound accumulation between 3500 and 5500, after which 1 year of dreadful bear market finally ends and a new bull market ensues.

I'm noticing a lot of noobs in this thread today. This is making me want to switch my short to a long. What do you guys think of this thread today?
Zoom out on the one-day candles. It is readily apparent that this is the weakest dump yet both in terms of trade volume and price amplitude.  This is the best opportunity to buy Bitcoin since May of last year.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/M0jmepwa/

Slightly bullish on the 4hr. I plan to short at .236 and the .382. 

Let’s see how the rest of the week goes.
Out of position since my stop hit at 6499. I'm giving this 3 days. If we close and stay above 6400 I'll re-enter.

The position bot paints a very interesting picture. Every short is in the green & all real longs are in the red. Which takes hold first - longs capitulating or shorts getting too greedy?
This has much more to drop. Don't try to catch the bottom. The odds are stacked against you. We are in a full blown bear that could last months or even years for all we know..uncharted territory. You look for short setups in bear markets...not long setups...looking for long setups in bear markets is a good way empty your account.
I know this is bad for saying but It will pleasure me greatly when people who sold out and went to fiat get trapped in that shit. Bitcoin haters (worthless going to zero fudster permashort whores ) Not to be mean but there is a price to pay for obtaining freedom and that is courage and vision. Only few have this and should be rewarded over the long haul.
At this rate, bulls should count closing anywhere above 5k as a good day. Lol
someone is hungry of these cheap coins
Don't think even a hulk dick will save us now.

It will just get sold in to.

Dimon and Buffet have won this round.

Think we found it, bottom that is. Def reminds me of Feb.
You guys talk about guessing trends, and no one cares to point out btc has been dropping a perfectly solid 4&#37; every 24 hours for almost a week now with 0 signs of reversal. This is a constant slow bleed, anyone still hodling is a masochist. Your money is literally better in a checkings account with .05&#37; interest.
If you’re retarded like me, and believed in the “this time is different” narrative, the way I see you have two choices, the bubble popped already and you list your money, you can either:

Cash out now and move on with your life, take it as a lesson and try not to get caught in scams like this again.

Wait for the next bubble and cashout on the way up, cause if you wait for the descent you know it’s brutal.

Apprently nothing changes, bitcoin is useless to the core, a pure shitcoin, it is only a manipulation tool to centralize money even more.

And don’t believe people saying this is the bottom.
Based on the walls he's flashing, it looks like this guy has 2-3 more tantrums left before he has to start to cover.  Bitcoin is strong and he doesn't afraid of anything.  I smell a $1000 daily green candle nearby.

Hard to believe we were at ~$2K a year ago.
Don't you guys feel like the resistance in 6500s and 6400s is in overall stronger than expected?
Somebody's burning through a lot of coins and not really dropping the price much.  I might enter a little long after the next "big" red candle.
Huge move incoming to 7k plus right now.
Are we going up?! Have a feeling!
[removed]
Ah, another lovely morning, another impotent dump by our friends the bears! Still holding my long from 6600, no stops, confident that it will be quite green in a few days. 
If Tether systematically pumped the price using fake money, who knows what the real price should be once the fraud is removed. Possibly under $1000. Scary thought.

The latest move looks like an adjustment in leveraged positions to me.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/IJKOAmme/

It doesn't look that earth shattering to me, though. I saw some people talking about over-extended shorts. To me, it looks like were seeing less leverage overall.

For six months longs have oscillated significantly more than shorts. [[Continued...]](https://www.resavr.com/comment/daily-discussion-wednesday-june-10649021)

Just bounced off bottom trend line (in current falling wedge \- can see on hourly, sorry no chart). Have been gone last few weeks bc that $7k range just got too boring and was frankly just a no trade zone imo, but happy to be back! Looks like the volatility should pick up some as well as we broke down from the multi\-month converging triangle. Probably not a bad spot to scale into a long to play the bounce (esp some of the alts \- LTC), as long as this wedge holds... smarter/safer play would be to trade the breakout (about $6480 for me rn).

Edit: aaaand broke down
So I guess, there is no triple bottom? Unless we count the tip of the wick from the bounce in February at \~6k. Then we could still get a double bottom as of now.
Gentlemen, how we test 6300 will decide whether we bounce into the 7000s for good, or if we go sub 6. That last major drop in shorts was smart money closing, shorting or longing here is gambling with the market and smart money dont gamble. I would have closed too if I had shorts entered above 7k TO close (got out of shorts on wicks in upper 6.8s), but I'm a ramblin gamblin helluva gambler so I opened shorts yesterday betting on sub 6k within next 24 hr. Ejection button if we aren't under 6.1k by this time tomorrow.

Edit: 6.3 is place to watch cuz that's where I have my descending wedge drawn plus some give for spring.
How sweet it is to be short these past few days :D 
Bulls WTF another wedge! inviting a break, Just market break out or let it sink!
This is goin sub 6k within the next 12 hrs, possibly within this 4hr candle. Not because of weak bounce, not because of wedge, purely bc number of downvotes to my last comment. Psyops heavy in this sub right now says they want us to do something. 

Short 80% stack 5x 6390 entry.

A huge upward move is about to happen because of price action that is happening.  The moves are starting to be in the 100 dollar range per tick which is extremely unusual.  Within 2 hours.  
The Barts are back! 
Time to go up now?

Ether has started to dump \- bears are back in town, oh wait, they never left, were just taking a joint break
How come mods are allowing bears to take over the thread and down vote posts from people that think the price might go up?  
Life's not about how hard you can hit, it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. - Rocky Balboa

It's only foolish if you don't learn from it in the future
Breaking off the 6k support and returning under the previous log trendline is probably the best time ever to sell. We are about 500$ from there.

But playing it safe is always cool
Thanks for coming back, these posts were missed. 
That's a really tight stop. Edit: sorry I'm drunk and read 6250
Gl bro, always wish the best for all ins. I don't trust it tho, might be early.
I think we can go up to 6600-6700 over the next 1-2 days then come back down. The "crash" is happening slowly on the weekly timeframe, there's plenty of opportunity to scalp. You should be fine as long as you don't get married to the position and actually close at resistance. I'm not long but I closed a big chunk of my short at 6200, gonna reshort later.
Thanks bro and is that on Excel manually charted? That is hard.core. if so.

What is the time interval you use for closes?
Give it an hour.
I bet that green candle will be followed by a bigger red candle, 1 step up and 2 steps back
yeah it's painful to read, reminds me of xvg sub
I’ve been all over reddit. This daily thread is the ONLY useful section of crypto on reddit. I just hope this never gets over run with moonboyz
Still feel like goblin town is one exit away. Until 6400 officially falls I don’t feel like it can be called juuuuust yet. Bears seem absolutely relentless though. Not saying we won’t get there but you just never know with bitcoin. That BGD is still fairly fresh in a lot of bears minds. 
Though it makes me weep, thank you for sharing and excellent post.

Damn, guys, what sort of relationship you have...?

My initial trades were down 20%, she didn't say a word, she believed in me.

I lost 50% of my stack on a series of bad trades, she didn't say a word, she believed in me.

I cashed out 400% of my initial lately after making back all of my loses, she said 'i believed you'll make it work'.

If you don't have it you should honestly think wtf is wrong.
Maybe try to be open with her about it, show here some of the better aantonop talks together on the couch ?  
Teach her why you like this space, other then the xxx&#37; gains.  
My better halve is probably the stronger hodler then i am, because she doesnt watch the price and hangs around here all the time :)  

hardest part for me is to convince her that I'm ready to buy more anytime soon... 
Well, its best not to mention it to your other half. But if you do do it when you have fucked up something worse that can take the focus away from your (lost) savings

Honey! you wont believe this our bitcoin's at 25k again lets quit our jobs LOOOL jk 4.5 :(

long term indicators are notorious for being broken just to bounce above them right after

Seen a bunch of noobs in here and twitter asking how to short lol Asking basic futures questions.
The latter. Since the breakdown from 7600 there have been well over $100 million liquidated on Bitmex alone, not to mention OKEX
I've actually never looked into it, are the addresses for Bitmex wallets known? Would be curious to see how many actual coins are held there, and how much of that volume is traders passing make-believe money around. 
There's a huge trend these days of people reading a headline and then creating their own reality. Not just in crypto, but also politics etc.

There's a \*lot\* of people (inc. journalists) who don't know jack shit but assume they are experts.

The energy issue also annoys me. For what you are getting it seems way more efficient than banking, actual mining (for oil, metals), car production, mobile phone production, the internet (by a magnitude), food packaging / shipping etc. but a lot don't care about actual facts.

Also, nobody has ever \*actually\* calculated the energy use with proof of accuracy.

It's the blind leading the blind.
The energy consumption thing used to bother me until I realized how much environmental damage is done to the earth (and the people enslaved to do it) to mine actual gold. With solar, hydro, and other clean means of generating energy expanding, I don't see crypto mining as that big a hurdle.
It's funny because somebody did a conservative estimate on how much power the banking industry uses and they calculated that banks use roughly 200% more than bitcoin. Now you should take that with a grain of salt due to this being based off of several different factors rather than raw power consumption data
Holy shit bro balls of fucking STEEL

JK, thanks for the sticky.
Haha xD
:D
Solid plan. I think longing a retest of the low or a slightly lower low is a good entry, stops under 5900 is good for protection against the chance of a big capitulation event to 5k, which is possible at these levels when testing the lows.
great analysis, although why not take your own advice? the dust has not yet settled, it's either a break at the downtrend line or bounce at log line where to go long.. why here in no-mans-land at 6250?
The halving is still too far off to be a decent fantasy narrative, so this is going to have to suffice for awhile.
fingers crossed for a self-fulfilling prophecy...
Ugh this is what the current state of crypto trading devolves into; hopes of meme-fueled pumps espoused by dick eating bombastic geniuses.  Thank goodness crypto has a lot of legit developments going on underneath all this bizarre stuff and news cycles because at the end of the day the merits of the technology will win out.
This whole Wyckoff will have been put in to circulation to give a little bit of hope to buyers.

Maybe to entice them back in as no one wants to buy now.

Then it will just dump again, we aren't going to see any upside soon unless 1 of 2 things happen.

1. China unbans crypto trading
2. Tether shows proof of 1:1 backing by USD

Even then this isn't guaranteed to help. 
I was expecting a technical bounce but potential divergent RSIs just seem to melt away.

Starting to wonder whether we're in the opening / middle chapter of a capitulation move.

Do you spread out your stop loss orders or use a single order price?
I got the falling wedge with the resistance going down from $7.600:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/NEZMM7hu/


> I recognize I'm shorting the bottom here at the same time as calling for a bounce.

After getting rekt on a (totally neglected fml) long last weekend, I feel that having a comparable short to hedge this is the best way to go long right now.  To either be able to close the long at a loss without being sickened, or to be able to dca it a bit with more peace of mind.

Edit: wait, your sept is another short?  I'm confused.
I'll take over this :)

Did something stupid, wanted to move my position to Sep and add, so opened 2.5x short before we dropped, so that I can make some more money on both and close Jun lower.

Now I'm in 2 positions and being greedy so can't stick to the plan of closing Jun. But after this wedge... I think I should take some profits, but somehow can't manage to do this.

!short XBTU18 6520 2.5x 100%
Thank your mom for selling the bottom. That's how I know we're close. 
What WSJ article? The only major article I have seen today is the NYT article 
Yeah, they're really pulling out all the stops on this one.  Won't work.  Never does.
I'm surprised people aren't talking about the WSJ article more in here, but I'm sure the delusional crowd sees it as "FUD".   But of course more people will sell when they realize that $20K was all a sham and scam.
Or rekt
No. Close that shit and reset. Time is WAYYYY more valuablr than money. Time is a real, scarce asset. 
Melissa Lee never accepts any FUD
yeah wait til they trot out roubini and the gang

there's zero information in that interview, just some dork speculating.  That's 'news' nowadays.

To get real news they're going to need subpoenas.


Bingo.
“Smart” money lol 😂 
Your convinced we’ve bottomed out?
looks like we are going up a bit, I agree, but so far wedge support still holds as resistance. could end also as a double top from the rebounce. 
Try bitmex's testnet to figure out the UI.

Trade on GDAX for the time being
Here's what I use: Coinbase as a fiat gateway. Binance to buy and sell alts. BitMEX to trade. Bitfinex on TradingView for checking charts.
The right exchange depends on your base currency. In my case it is EUR, so I use Kraken as they have most BTCEUR volume with low spread. I you use USD you have more options, but Bitfinex has most volume. 

Edit: and yes, Gdax is a good second step from coinbase. 
Next ATH any minute now.
As an avid Wyckoff user I can tell you this much, the model is terrible at indicating when the Phase B ends. It tells you all about Phase A, and C, but you need to figure out yourself when the breach from B to C happens. Usually following a more violent Spring, which is supposed to be much more violent than the one on the picture. That one on the picture looks like a Secondary Test.

IMO where we are now, is *not* the Spring. From the source I read, "The extent of supply,
or the strength of the sellers, can be judged by the depth of the price move to new lows and the relative level of volume on that penetration. Until this testing process, we cannot be sure the TR is accumulation and must wait to take a position until there is sufficient evidence that mark-up is about to begin. [...] With supply apparently exhausted and our danger point pinpointed, our likelihood of success is good and our reward/ risk ratio favourable."

The last dip and rebound between 6150 and 6300 was rather a sharper Secondary Test. 
my thoughts is ive seen this been posted 3 million times but for different price ranges in the past few months and it means nothing except people are grasping at straws
Target of that spring is in the ~$4's tho, just fyi (something ive been watching a while)
I can tell, reading the comments, and volume, we are not at bottom. So red arrow is wrong. We got lower to go.
what site/app is that?
What indicator are you using for the order flow analysis? Thanks in advance.
Hi, this stuff is fascinating!

Where do you get this kind of data ?
Love your posts. Thanks.
What's the reasoning behind grouping x<5 vs x>5, i.e. between whales and midrange? Why 5? Thanks.
Thanks man. If we ever meet IRL beers on me. 
Thanks for taking the time to do the research. Cheers.
I did a similar analysis and came up with similar results.  I believe there is an extremely small chance that we could see ~1k again, but 3-5k seems to be a much more reasonable floor.  There's also a nontrivial chance of a >5k floor.
Check out data for "Wyckoff parabolic distribution" or "Wyckoff parabolic advance" - this is a study of what you're looking at. And yes, typically these parabolic runs retrace between 80 and 90%.
Interesting data!
Wow very nice analysis. 
Interesting. The only thing is looking at charts is - get your tinfoil hat ready - if there are large rich groups manipulating the market, there is more control in dumping the market bc you can always pump more money in you can't create more btc though. Right now there is no interest in the public for btc after this massive crash, so with less money coming in it makes the whales more powerful. Btc is becoming a rollercoaster of value, it doesn't even get used to buy stuff as much anymore. What do I know though, my guess is that as long as money is being printed and the average Joe isn't using and buying btc, it will keep dumping. 
I told myself that when it hit 200 after the fall from 1k+.  I almost sold at 400.  I'm so thankful I was just patient and let it ride.
Everyone thinks the low volume means bears are running out of ammo. Whereas in fact it just means (as you correctly mentioned) the real panic hasn’t even started yet.
Panic from who? The ones here dont make the market. Maybe the masses and they are allready out.
**"You’ll end up owning coins that are super valuable in the coming future."**

No guarantee

**"the die hards will rather own $1 BTC than sell it."**

That's a good thing?

**"Everyone here feels super rational in the grand scheme which makes me happy. We understand that the price going down is out of our control and it’s totally fine."**

Sounds very much like you are incredibly scared and trying to reassure yourself
Hello capitulation my old friend. 
finally got realistic ya'll
seems accurate. Buyers still no where to found.
Yep, noticed the same short term situation... Shorts taken nice profits today, longs fighting uphill battle, adding more long. Price action is weak. Guess the direction needs to come from somewhere else; fundamental news or big whale buy/sell orders. 
Feel free to ask anything you want by PM or mentioning my username in a comment. I like to help anyone new that I can.

kudos for trying to learn how to trade in this market environment...bear markets are where you learn.

This is the off season baby. 
Only if they are interested in shorting and actually hate bitcoin.
Join us at /r/btc, we're very noob-friendly (:
Just a bear flag if you ask me. A lot of shorts have been closing as well.
Why
This is me. Graduating sucks 

good luck hunting!
Stop job hunting and only trade crypto. At least if you have a big enough stack...
Perfect move. You will be rewarded
Interesting analysis, thanks for sharing.  Sorry you lost your old account.
Curious to hear /u/sloppysynapses take on this as he comments on wyckoff from time to time. 
Your PnF charts have been sorely missed, welcome back
What are you basing your wyckoff BTC price action on?  All exchanges I've used show we have yet to make a new low, yet your image shows us in the spring already.
That's great but by that time you've wasted one of the biggest bulls in human history by doing nothing. Long term strategies like this are reasonable only on equities that dont bring you a 10x in under a year.

Impressive self control, but you're dead wrong if you think you're being smart
lmao...good luck bagholding to 0
When I had rough time I used to trade with 1% of stack without lev.

Basically no loss or gain but also no stress and lets you follow the market until you feel that it's time to trade for real.
We've all been there, at least you didn't lose the majority of your stack
Chad will remain sane a bit longer
The common opinion that I've seen around the Webs is that there will be a V-shaped bounce in the $6000 range that will take us back in the 7000s for a dead cat bounce, then a likely return to sub $5000 prices.

edit: Aside from the initial bounce, this will likely take weeks to play out.


it won't I think

But monthly is bullish, just need to wait 4-5 months & then it will resume probably

Crypto is here to stay
Dude.. that's completely result-driven. We can't see how far the dark gaping hole lies beneath us
This is why people talking about how many shorts vs longs there are is pointless.  Longs were out of control at 19k.  All it means is people don’t know anything and most crypto traders are degenerate gamblers, which we already know.
exactly! I was thinking the exact same thing. It was over bought before. Now it is oversold.
Said this about every price point above this too 
in the the not too distant future this place and subsequent boards will be awash with post after post of 'all crypto is dead'

Might spend some time over at /r/ripple to see the reaction
It sounds like you are confusing guessing recent price action correctly with knowing the future.
Agree. Anyone who bought over 8100 is gonna have to wait a while.
Reshorted, entertained
And you guys all down voted me for saying that 6k support was still there...
Very! Looked away for a second and got a better entry on my long than expected -- 6360 3x.

[edit -- oh, and look at that! i'm up already! who says you can't make money longing in a "bear market?"]
6k still remains
Alright, inverse chart it is!
Just smoke some green
I wouldn't call this bullish, necessarily, but it might provide some guidance on when to panic and what to expect for the next 45 days or so:

The lower lines are the upper and lower boundaries of the OG ascending bull channel that kicked off the bull market from $300 to $20,000. 

As long as the market remains above the channel resistance-turned-support, then there's still hope that this too will pass soon.

And even if that line falls, there's still some wiggle room for the market to bounce off the lower support line instead.

If both lines fail though, I'd be a bit concerned for the foreseeable future.

Continuing to remain above the resistance line from $20K is also (technically) bullish. 

Unfortunately the market could remain above that line and still continue to drop (while also respecting the OG channel) until around August 4th.
You can also see the moon from Goblintown.

If we continue with that trend, we reach $0 before the end of August, so I can guarantee you that there will be a hard floor before that, which is pretty soon. Does it make you feel better?

Bulls showing up to defend the 6.2 support. Sign that this might be a stronger support for bears to sell through
For today....
no way... this is not over by a long shot and I say this as a long term holder.

WHY would a bounce to 6400 be good when we opened yesterday at 6800. 

Shorters are loading up now trust me. Need them to get washed away for a while to even think of a reversal.

Golbin town etc.. 
Double bottom even.
> Not going to 5k like this for sure

What? You are saying that it isn't correct trading when people short after the convincing break down of the 4 months long symmetrical triangle? How is this in any way fomo?
Why do you believe we need to go to 5k first before a recovery?

Darko reference. Very nice.

Lol.
Bless you. 
I’ve seen you continuously long time after time and get pwned the majority of the time. 

Might be time to switch that mindset to short.

I know it’s hard to bring yourself to short in the low 6k’s. I for sure am having trouble doing it. 
You're post basically says you didn't learn anything from 2014.

I bought all my coins all throughout 2014, but I'll only add to my holdings at these much higher prices if there's any confidence for a bottom. I don't think we're going to be at that point for a little while. It makes much more sense to buy at $6k on the way up than it does on the way down.
On #2 \- did you intend to say "once everybody believes it will drop, there is nobody left ~~selling~~ buying"? 

Can you share if you sold any coins during the bull run? If you're continuing to buy, do you've a target price in mind? 

I've gone from a long\-term holder to a swing trader with the primary goal of increasing the BTC stack and given the state of the market \-  of course I didn't sell the top or anything as always been in the HODLer mindset and kind of kick myself for it. 
Person who bought in at the worst moment gives trading advice!

Sadly, it's a different world now.  Crypto got too big and and gov'ts are stomping it out.  It's like if the dinosaurs did not go extinct and the mammals tried to evolve and take over the ecosystem...just not going to happen.   Even in Venezuela and Zimbabwe where the currency collapses and you have runaway fiat inflation...they just make crypto illegal and pretty much game over.

They are just too powerful.  Crypto is being smothered in its cradle.
Why would "Smart" Shorts open above a tested and confirmed resistance line?
I don't normally like to "predict" what's going to happen any more than up or down one move ahead but if I had to guess where we were going, it'd be something like what you said. Break down below line to $4.5-5.5k, big correction bounce to $7.5-7.8k which is where the support line would be, then continue down. 
>short squeeze

On Bitfinex you can only leverage x3, to get margin called on Finex with the opend shorts price would need to go to at least 8400 USD with opened x3 shorts in this range. And how do you know these people leveraged their short and just did not only hedge, or tat these numbers are not just manipulated? 
We have been in freefall since 10k with no retrace, it's due imo. 7.2, 7.8 or 8.2

IMO, after capitulation, came a period of true usage and adoption, while continuous improvements were made technically.

Personally, that is around the period I *spent* 90% of my btc because "well, I better get *some* use out of this fucking shit".

I wasn't alone in doing this.  Through actually spending it, there was true grassroots adoption and organic growth.  It was just a matter of time before hitting another threshold of big exposure, though at the time it seemed impossible.
Prosperity
Gamblers progressively left the game, leaving only hodlers, when that happened, price rose and gamblers came back.

As we’ve seen, long periods of sideways chop result in eventual sharp breakdowns. Completely agree with you
Depends. Trading? Yes. Investing? Stay there for some months, please, so I can keep buying.
Wow ballsy call. The buy vol in the 6.2-6.3 range is definitely stronger than the past few days. Bulls aren't giving up 6.2 easily. 
My guess is if it goes above $6500 here on this pretty pitiful bounce it'll be a great short entry for another dump. 

Don't blow your load too fast, this could go sideways for a few days 


You are ruining bitcoin!

Tempted to up my leverage here, current CA is 6600. In it until at least 5900.
risky
Possible \- that drop was to clear out so many stops.. 6370 \- plenty of traders in my group had 6390..
Lmao the battle for 6400! This is intense...
Alts should have never been able to climb out of goblin town.  The fact that they did makes me very nervous about the whole market.  It signals to me too many are trading emotionally  with a get rich mentality and not buying and holding because they feel the network is under valued.  
Good, the alts are all scams. The sooner the market realizes that the better.
And it's big possibility that without big leverage you'll be in profit in near future.
The pattern of the "monthly cycle" is there, up down, then up and then down. Over last 5 months. So going long here (truly long) probably carries less risk than just a binary gamble (50/50). Long term chances are in your favor, especially as due to the pattern we are at the "down" position.
[deleted]
that a gox address i assume?

When did this happen?
dump is over when people stop sending btc to exchanges to sell. This is what happened last time at $6k. 

We're in for another extended dump, seems pretty obvious to me.

$6k bottom is too obvious, we could see a bounce but this looks like it's making a new low pretty soon 

Haven't been watching closely though so could be wrong about strength of bounce so far 
Does that mean price will go up after futures end? They manipulated the price so their futures contract is more valuable?

More coordinated FUD
Why does there need to be high volume for the bottom? Aren't double bottoms declining volume on the second dip, for example?
I added new shorts a 6240 so same here 
I'm fairly certain we'll retest $5800 as well (and I think move below it eventually), but be aware that moving to $5800 in [this intersection would actually push us below the log support from ATH.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/2rZ3XFOZ/).  This seems unlikely to me despite how bearish things are currently.  I personally think the R:R is really good for buys off $6k with stops just below it. 
I think the important part of your statement is that you looked at 12 days of threads at basically the same price range,  refusing to drop.  We have been at this range for only 2 days so it is hard to draw similarities yet. Right now we can only hope it repeats April.
You do know we are at $6550, don't you?   

Is your point that we could have another DCB here?   Sure that is possible.  Not likely....but possible.
Where exactly do you read the Tether fud?

Goblintown is when people stop making posts like this and people stop responding and just start talking in past tense about crypto. 
Too early to call this a bottom?
Sure. Any evidence of hope is accepted these days 
no, you need to break the midpoint high to make a triple bottom. a bounce here makes a flat bottom triangle.
We don't know that this is the bottom, but it's a good time to buy if you can afford to wait.
Think im getting back in here, it's looking like a solid diamond bottom right now so maybe we can keep pushing
Can you ELI5 what's a bear flag and how to read one?
I’m watching the 12 and 26 day EMA on each time frame. Currently just above the 26 on the 15m chart. If that holds then I’ll be watching the 1H chart and see how it responds. 

But like you said, although we’ve gone from 6140 to above 6300, this is far from the ‘V’ shaped bounce that we’ve been watching for.

I cant recall the last time I’ve seen a bounce like that So much volume in that candle.


And I got down voted for saying there was support at 6K...
You're correct in that this ain't no bounce. This is bots pausing so their human masters can double check everything before going down again. RSI, MACD, all oscillators are pretty much useless in the next few days. 
We actually bounced from the old resistance line, that never really confirmed as a support before. It's pretty steep and in a few days it'd be under $6000, but hey, this might actually be good. A lot of traders (myself included) were hoping for a retest on this line long time ago when it was a good deal higher, and worried that a deeper drive might come to reconfirm it, potentially leading to a scary panic dump and crash through.

None of those answers apply to me. Am I special?
Only if you shorted with very low leverage, otherwise you would have been liquidated multiple times
I see a lot of big runs up between mid-November and now, dude.  Shorting in mid-November would have been dumb AF.  Shorting on April 8 or even on multiple days during the big dump of January would have left you rekt.  Shorting now would be slightly insane, as would longing with any kind of leverage.
If you really want to compare it to wyckoff, then you should notice that our second low was a higher low instead of a lower low. It seems like a minor difference but it plays a huge role when trying to analyse the bigger picture. 

All eyes are on 6k right now. If we break down to the 5000s and then settle back above 6k, then I don't think anyone would need this wyckoff chart to realise that we might have bottomed.
Will this turn into the new 6th meme?
https://twitter.com/joyrider50/status/1006994391322357760?s=19
I agree! It may still go down further... but it will recover.   
One green candle that should cause concern to shorters is the rejection from 6100. It has 11k btc bought in 30 minutes. You know what else had 11k btc volume? The candle that dropped us from 70xx to 6698. 

I am not trading so I have no bias or blinders. Good luck! 
Looks like a pretty solid entry.
Could a BGD happen after a small bounce? How was April's BGD, it was after a dip right? I'm just speaking hypothetically 
Why not just trade with the trend? 
Hopefully, you have some cold storage and can just start another trading stack if you need to.  

I have done some incredibly dumb trading earlier this year, so I cannot judge, and just take a break and try harder if you need to.

You lost because you used excessive leverage.   "25x" is not a strategy that reflects a level of certainty.   Position size as a fraction of your net worth reflects a level of certainty.   25x is just weakness due to undercapitalization.   Why would you have a position that gets liquidated with a 4% move against you when this market makes random 5% moves all the time?
Did you get stopped?
Hey this could potentially be the bottom and you may have caught it.  Time will tell.
Get out bud. Save for the incoming drop.

On my Bitfinex chart that 20k downtrend line is around 5900 usd today, so haven't bounced off it yet.
I have that line at 5950 roughtly
It doesn't seem like you are using the log scale?  We will probably see a bigger bounce if we go down to touch the line at around 6.1k
Indeed. Just watching the charts :) 
I think you have shorts and longs mixed up
> When they do, buy pressure will find them selling into a bull market at a substantial premium.

You're saying that we'll see a bull market soon?
First of all your chart don't make no sense. Either im stupid or you're cherry picking.

Second the shorts have been getting paid all this time. Which exchange are you referring to where shorts are net negative on interest?

Third, I think being mod has gotten to your head. This shit is headed down and we're months away from capitulation. I only say this to wake you up, you're obviously a responsible playa in the ecosystem but don't get rekt so hard that you're out. We need good players in this space, it being so young.
bullish
Anyone realize an increase in these new shorting comments?? Very close to a local bottom here. To answer your question: your ROE is calculated from the mark price and it's your return from the margin you posted not the position's total size.
Your UPnL is displayed at the mark price. If you hover the mouse over it, it shows you your UPnL if you would close the positions according to the order book atm. Also: if you market close, it costs you some fees (0.075%). Same if you market open a position.
What was your position size?

Long term bullish as ever on crypto / blockchain based shit in general, Bitcoin... it depends. Exchanges pushing fiat / alt or whatever own token (like BNB) / alt trading pairs will likely be a big blow to BTC prices.

Dangerous amount of longs opening, adding even more to my short as a result of this development. I could easily be wrong but I think we are in for a epic long squeeze.
Didn’t the 5 month MA cross 10 month MA a couple weeks back for the first time since 2014? Bears are fully out of hibernation. This will get ugly here soon...
Volume has been low enough that i'm not sure we'd believe one if we saw it.

11k on the 30M is substantial. Compare to past DCBs.

We shot way past the target for the iC&H... sure doesn't look like much of a recovery, though.
Boy I wish the price was 163 again. I can only dream of all the coins I would have. 
to be fair, you could have asked the same question about people closing longs at 19k.  I'm on the sidelines with no position or opinion, but just my thought regarding the subject.
> Traders closing your shorts, why?

to take profit.

by the tone of this and  the next post, looks like someone is getting nervous.
I'm sticking to my target unless something changes. I already took some nice profits on the way down though, so it's fine.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/AY3f7E9P/
No one wants to be Melvin the Bottom Shorter...it's a badge of honor to long the top here. It's a mark of shame to sell/short the bottom.

 in general people are super scared to short. Seeing parabolic gains week after week that punishes you for selling will drill into you a fear of shorting and selling that is hard to get rid of.

also because people forget what happens when BTC likes to trend. If we were at $11.4k, 3% below local top, no one would be closing. It'd be a huge party in here.

I get the r/r aspect but we've heard the "long is a better r/r" since like $7.3k...

To be fair, it's unlikely we stay oversold that long. but shorts taking profits can reset this to 30+ rsi on every time frame pretty quickly without a substantial move up. 

But mainly people who short are quick to take profits and not be greedy because of btc's history and the BGD etc. 

Personally I see the inability to stay above a 3 month low as pretty bearish. 

I really don't blame people for knife catching and I could totally be very wrong but...really looks ready to go down. People are being Uber technical, respecting RSI religiously with the bounce. Sometimes you gotta realize RSI is just telling you that btc is trending really fucking hard


It can probably go sub 20, not saying it will, but in the past when weekly RSI was around these levels and trending down, the daily RSI got into the high teens. Look at august to september in 2014.
Buyers are actually arbitrage bots.
Jokes on them they got Tethers 
Not really a resistance, volume is so low because no bulls are trying
Yeah, idiots.

Bitcoin is an investment where you drop in what you would be willing to lose on a crazy weekend in Vegas, then just forget about it for a year or two. 
[deleted]
The triple bottom technically confirms once we print a higher high, meaning >10k.
4800 euros mur . kraken
I'd say that if 6200 fails (excluding some random wick) then it's not a triple bottom. Anyway triple bottoms are traded when they break the trend line resistance that is around 9k at the moment.
>Apparently BTC gives 0 fucks for wedge support and divergents

You know how the RSI was above like 90 for almost all of december and nobody could understand it? . Yup, expect the same in reverse with single digit RSI but BTC giving zero fucks.
Divergents can go on for awhile before they kick in, I wouldn't count on them instantly helping. 
Too soon? 

That Kraken wall is a badass
ok x20
Of course we will
The sudden decline from 7600 to 6600 made my balls descend and now I'm afraid to put buy orders anywhere.
But to what end though? We've seen DCBs after DCBs.  Even this price which would be considered a bargain a couple of months ago, no one is touching.  To me it feels like the party is over for a bit.
We dropped 4k in 5 weeks. Yet we're still expecting 5? 
"The best way to trade a hyperwave is to be long all the up and short all the way down."

I'll try that one 
Hyperwaves are nothing more than bubble prediction speculation. I wish I would have saved the comments / links from a couple months back when someone here introduced me to the concept but alas I didn't and I can't find them. Do some searching though. Whereas some TA is questionable, hyperwaves take it to another level. My opinion at least.
$16k next month, sold. I will mainline as much hyper wave as i can get my hands on to make this happen. 
I like some hopium every now and again but I think I just overdosed.
Hmmm, I don't know. Could he be family of John Mcafee? I generally don't feel that good with this long-term graphs pointing to 1MUSD and the only way is up.
That's a good call, looks like we're in the early stages of an actual bounce. Definitely not longing here though...I'll just short into weakness.
your expectations will be crushed under my boot heel
That would be the complete opposite of what everyone expects
Bullish.

looks like it's mostly shorts closing.
Not sure if serious or sarcastic
Yes but the LiveLeak and Yelp comment sections are still pretty neutral on it, I'd wait until 4chan confirmation IMO
People commenting like that all the time at heise.de
People have been commenting that for the last three years.
Same old clueless people who we'll have to hire in a couple years after the bankers screw things up again.  This is proof that demand has not even started, and this was never a bubble.

I'm really starting to see how this market repeats itself. Big up, big down (but not as big as the up) then flat, then bigger up, big down (but not as big as the up), then flat... rinse and repeat. Buy the dips and put your coins in a safe place off-market.  Make fun of moon boys and hodlers all you want, but they've been right so far.
If a (self-confessed?) daily mail reader says we are near a bottom, then that is highly bearish indeed. On the other hand being called a tulip ponzi scheme in said publication would be bullish (if this is indeed what their readers are commenting). Such conflicting information. Better odds for England in Russia, then any of this suspect sentiment analysis, I'm afraid.
No when the majority of normies all agree that bitcoin is a ponzi and tulips that's not good for adoption.

at some point it's a really bad thing that bitcoin is seen as a scam/ponzi.

Like when the majority of the first world knows what it is and thinks it's a scam...it's not a good thing. Imo

Broke from our downtrend line, mostly just break out traders 
Thanks for the short entry Mr. Whale!

Edit: watch another one come destroy me now...
the stop hunting was don on that major down move.
Don't forget that a lot of shorts took profits / closed here. The next time there won't be that much firepower left.

Shorts are down about 8% and longs are up 2% from their relative extremes. We're oversold on all the medium time frames. Daily RSI is the lowest since the February 2018 low. Weekly RSI is lower than its been since 2015. Just as a few data points. 
Based on nothing. Thank you for that. 
Take a look at the volume dude, 2014 volume is almost equal, 2018 volume is decreasing for each hard dumb, in both USD and BTC value. History does repeat, but it does not repeat exactly 100%.

Dream on. But if this does play out like 2014-2018, I'll be totally cool with it.  And, actually, this looks more like 2015 anyway.

Where does your gut tell you to catch the bounce?
Your gut is pretty good lately, damn dude O_O
thank you, Gilfoyle.
it's just a bear flag
Would you go as far as to call it a rising wedge?
Thats what I came here to ask. So we're all seeing the rising wedge? I'm doing some daytrading (for once) Its been a year! 
Descending wedge on the 1h-4h > ascending wedge on the 15m
Yea it won’t feel good in a day or so 
good luck lol
Yep, it is a Bearfest over here. Who is/has the shortest and dares to go even shorter :D 
Can't tell if sarcastic.
I would not ask family to buy something that has no potential bottom. Regret would be painful.
Prepare to be disowned by your family
Oh, boy. We've got a long way to go down
Still too many bulls. More pain. Don't suggest investments to friends and family.
Yeah....I would hold off on that my friend....
I'm glad someone is buying.
Sounds like you're trying to get your friends, family, and neighbors to beat your ass haha
it's a good time to start building positions  (dca) but it will be years before we are over 10k again

It wicked far above, and we're sitting right on it at the moment. 

You're correct. It's about 6320
As i have it, the support of the former wedge is acting as resistance now.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/gaDvl548/
One can hope. But the whales have failed in rebooting crypto and now it will continue into it's deep slumber.
1.2k would be a 94% correction.  A 94% drop in 2014 would have been $70 bitcoin.  I don't think there is a chance in hell of this happening when considering the length of price discovery we had in 2017-2018 between $1000 and $6000, in comparison to the price discovery between $300 and $800 in 2014 which lasted only a couple weeks.
eh, personally doubt we'll see 1.2k...the amount of buying down to that number will be insane, only considering the fact that btc hit $20k so $1.2k will be seen as dirt fucking cheap.
Bad news: The chances of hitting 4.9 are miniscule, and the other two levels are just ridiculous.
If we seriously hit $1.2k I'm going to go on the biggest "I told you so" campaign ever.  
I dont see no buying...
Gotta love when people say I'm buying, when they're sitting behind their computers stressing out about the price 
Been hearing that for a couple of months now.
Sold everything, changed my flair, was hoping for a reversal but bulls have lost any will to live so screw that. It feels a lot better to watch the price when you have no more skin on the game.

Wish I knew how to short it.
Then short it 50x.
I just can’t decide whether to go long or not

I dont really care if we go lower as long as I’m not in a long position

I deff aint shorting at 6400 though, reality be damned!
their spirits are broken but they have not experienced FEAR yet.
That comes later.

People were saying the same back in 2014/2015.
>All that was ever deposited on the exchange by me and Joe is 2 BTC, how do I end up with 2.5 BTC?   

From Chad, who keeps adding margin to his underwater long. 
Read the contract details carefully read them over and over until you fully understand them if you do not fully understand them don't use the product.

All info is there to get a good understanding it just takes time
Futures can go from -5% to +5%. But when we were at 20k the newly opened march futs were trading at 24k. You can lose a lot closing at the same 'spot' price cause futs went the other way.
according to https://fork.lol/ we still have 6 blocks per hour in the last 24 hours and even more in the last two weeks, so it looks like miners are adding hardware instead of shutting them down.

24 hours 	144 (6.00/hr)
2 weeks 	2162 (6.43/hr)
Some already have.
6k for me (I'm in the UK)

But, I said this before and then it hit 6k, I went to flip the switch and it went to 11k. So.....
if some shut down at 4k difficulty goes down making it profitable for others to continue mining, we can play this game indefinitely, remember bitcoin had miners at less that $1 per coin. The only hiccup being the difficulty adjusting times. 
On one hand you could argue that they can wait out the dip, so mining here is still a good idea.  On the other hand you could argue that they could shut down, use the money they would have spent on operations and buy BTC directly, so shutting down makes sense, even if they want to start up again later.  On the third hand I have to believe that the sheer amount of coins they have will allow them (possibly as a group) to easily push this back up, not allowing it to go too far down.  On my fourth hand I could imagine the largest and most efficient miners allowing it to go to goblin town to capitulate their competition, then bring it back...
I get free electricity so I will continue mining, though i am mining ETH, keeping the mining profit is a great way to build a stack for the next bullrun/market. That said i think they will probably shutdown some when profitability turns negative
some miners already have most likely. Or they shorted heavily in the 10k range and are now claiming their shorts 
I guess it depends how much candy you give them....oh wait
Not too late.  The price will likely be well below $6000 in the next few weeks.  But may have to deal with a spike upwards first.


Lol at the downvotes. Everybody thinks its going to zero. Time to long. 
I think they were also told they were late to the party at $14k, $12k, $10k, $8k and now..... $6.5k

This place is funny, BTC crashing through the floor, it goes up a few % in a day and it's a bull market again apparently haha
Bloomberg always does this when times are critical for bitcoin. Don't know what's their agenda.
Cue the Big Banking conspiracy theories.
Bears need to overcome the 1700 coins buy wall on Kraken, so far only nibbled like 100 coins before this bounce.

Lets see if there is enough conviction
You must not be much of a daytrader if you don't understand why anyone would close a short here, or at any other time really.
The charts sure look like shit on BTC right now, but this is *exactly* the kind of stuff people were saying around 17-20k. "I don't get how people can take profits here, whales and institutional money wants all your coins, because they know this is going to 7 figures any day now."

> Right now is the time to short.

The time to short was $3000 back, when we were rejected from 10k, or on the way down as we fell through supports and failed to break back above resistance. Opening a short right here and now is just greed, and asking to get burned. 
I totally agree. However, devils advocate, could shorters be running out of steam/as far in as they'll bet on this going down more?

I think this attempt at a bounce is pitiful so I think we're going downtown soon... But there's hope in the back of my mind for us to make another bounce before going more south.

TLDR: idfk looks like it's goin down, hope it may go up 
You seem really concerned about this.
Not sure if you were implying this, but a lot of bear markets I've looked at don't have a deep wick when the true bottom is finally found.  Some do like 2014, but others don't.  Just something I noticed, maybe that wasn't what you were implying though
Did you see the price spike, this is begging for massive short squeeze
but I heard on the news that even the owner of Bitcoin sold all his coins!!!
Hmm, It doesn't look too bad though, I have the lower boundary for the major pennant it's in at about $420, which would coincide with previous resistance turned support. Will double down on my long there. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/Jfv55CJf/

As for it's effect on BTC, alts always overcorrect, and I don't *think* BTC will correct another 15% anytime soon as indicators are too  oversold and the number of shorts open will but the bears in a bit of a hot-seat, and I assume they'll be taking profit as the slightest hint of reversal. 
Eth is really strong, one of the rare coins which are not in lower low
If you keep getting burned, doesn't it make more sense to wait for confirmation of a trend reversal? Or wait for a bounce and follow the medium and long term trends and short?

I've found the usefulness of this thread to be greater than following Joe Shmoe on trading view.  
Feb 3rd was the low point on the RSI back then, and if you bought on the 3rd, you likely got shaken out on the 6th. 
Bullish! True if huge! We can all rest, RSI oversold - expect the pump like the last time, short squeze inc. How to get rich? Buy when rsi below 30 on daily /s
Ok, lets discuss it.  You go first!
eli5 what this implies?
> It is a cause for concern, and it's not looking good to be frank.

Give one source for this subjective editorialization. lol
I dont see how any bullish reversal can be confirmed without breaking 10k at this point. A rally from here just paints a large descending triangle, not a triple bottom.
That’s a bit dramatic given we’re $500 from 7k. 6 months is a long time... 
It's hard to think it will drop below 3k but...
You know fiat is generally used for money laundering, drug lords, assassin's and bank ponzi schemes right :D
Alright I take it back. This is either parody or I'm about to get green dildo'd again. Literally preparing my butthole right now. 

---

Did you sign up with bitmex solely to short? 

I would highly advise you use testnet.bitmex.com and literally just click things to test it out. 
Place order -> Stop market. I recommend you to test on BitMEX testnet first.
6370 (low) to 6491 (high since) is a tiny bounce. I don't really expect we'll bounce above that before the next leg down at this stage. A relief/technical bounce *should* come before 6K falls (if it does), but it may not go much higher than here. 6200ish to 6800ish wouldn't surprise me. All conjecture, obviously. 
Flatline with minimal bounce.
There are several strong candidates below $6,000:

1. $5,000 (a previous ATH that served as strong resistance)

2. $3,000 (another previous ATH that served as strong resistance)

3. $1,160 (the OG ATH)

$5,000 falling would be a very tough blow to the market. $3,000 falling would be a disaster. $1,160 falling would be absolutely catastrophic.
It's a speculative asset. It's always been a trader's market.
Why not wait a little longer with buying.   I don't think anyone is in a rush!
World cup is starting soon, other priorities than buying bitcoin. 

[removed]
Not to dig too far into alt talk, but most are suffering against BTC right now, which means even as BTC drops the BTC-dominance ratio is increasing. I haven't done any real analysis, but my sense is that before BTC goes up, it consolidates while extracting blood sacrifice from alts. Maybe a little hopium to put in your pipe and smoke.
ETH long-term chart looks so much better and more ... normal, I guess, than BTC right now. I'd be pretty happy to be in a long around this level on ETH if I was trading it in a vacuum. BTC though? I don't know, the horizontal double bottom-ish thing is pretty much the only hope for anything positive, I guess. 

https://imgur.com/a/UhfSgaA

Clear higher lows, far less ridiculous bubble top bullshit (if you ignore that left side at $10 anyway lolol), and generally a much more sane looking chart, imo. 
I'm not so sure. When you perform basic TA with only candles, volume and trend, sideway candles only lead to trend continuation. If we go sideways for a few days, probably the downtrend will resume. IMHO we need a candle reversal pattern with a bullish engulfing candle and volume.
> I believe for any faith to be restored it needs to go sideways for a while

Yeah people have been saying this for months now. But it goes up and down for a bit, then sideways, then drops. Repeat, repeat. 
Frankly, I wouldn't mind a spike upwards, since it's printing a bear flag now. 
If a BGD does rock up it'll be when nobody is really expecting it for maximum wreckage.
well if they do then i'm standing by with fiat for the following levels 

5k
4k
3k and drumroll please...
2k

scaling in of course
so they are going to give me the opportunity to buy more at 5k or lower?  id imagine they wouldn't want the price to get too low otherwise they will give too great a buying opportunity to too many ppl
A lot of people think that big traders profit just the same on price movements regardless what the price is. That is actually not true. Perhaps the biggest reason the price grew as much as it did in 2017 was that there was a need for liquidity to accommodate all the big traders, because at prices around $1k, $3k, $5k etc there simply weren't enough coins changing hands for all the money to move around. For a hodler, yes, price going from $500 to $1000 or $5000 to $10,000 is just the same. For traders playing with multi-million orders, there needs to be far more supply available on the books at lower price levels, slippage becomes more severe, etc. 

That's actually one of the reasons why Bitmex is probably a negative influence on the market overall -- it provides liquidity out of 'thin air' -- beyond what actual available supply of coins at given price can. 
YES, let the desperation flow. This is how we get back
This is why most people are not cut out for this game. This is exactly what happened in 2014 after a crazy run up in 2013 from $10 to $1200. The price took over a year to find the bottom and settle to I think it was around $200, which then preceded to stay around there for many months. Around the start of 2015 is when we started to see some crazy moves in ethereum from 50 cent to about $15 and by mid 2015 the price started to slowly rise with it being around $500 by the end of 2015. This continued steady rise took us to around $1k by the end of 2016, which was the year of the last halving (about June 2016), and set us up for a crazy 2017 with a dwindling supply of bitcoin and a growing interest in crypto due to price rises, news, ETF talks (winkleboss twins looked like they might have secured one early 2017), mainstream media paying more attention, bitcoin segwit fork creating bitcoin cash, plus many others.

The truth is we are still in early speculation phase and not many usecase's are being used yet. 

The lightening network seems promising, but it may take another year to see how well it scales up, how secure it is and how well it is adopted. 

Factom has just rolled out M3 and has bussinesses testing their system with the idea of adopting it for hashing and timestamping important documents. 

Maidsafe, one of the oldest and ambitious projects out there, have recently claimed to have solved one the last hard pieces of the puzzle, which for a 10+ year project is a big claim, and their system should have many instant usecase's, but will take time to grow trust and apps / websites. 

An ETF seems inevitable one day, but I don't think it will be this year. I think they want more regulations and the space cleaned up until they allow it.

Nasdaq sounds like they are going to get heavily involved at some point which should bring a lot of liquidity, but again will take time. 

If you've been around since the early days you would probably have the opinion that all-in-all the space now is hugely bullish long-term with how well it has hit the mainstream, but after a crazy year like last year we have to have a major correction until investors are confident to start piling money in again. 

If we keep following a similar trend like 2014 / 2015 we will find the bottom sometime in the next 6 months, so then would be a good time to buy back in. Like most you got caught up in the hype, so you either pull out like you did and walk away, or buy back lower, or ride it out and buy more if it goes lower. If we follow the last trend we should hit $10k again and stay above it by the end of 2019. 2020 is halving year, so should keep rising nicely seeing $20k by the end of the year, then 2021 will be blow off year with supply drying up and the hype train returning. Some huge news before this could see a break in the trend (ETF, some crazy adoption or some big financial crisis). We'll see.... But whichever way it happens it will surely be interesting. 

An asset that moves up 2000% in one year will just as easily drop 50% or more in the same time or less. You either learn to deal with them swings or you won't last a year and never see the profits guys have seen from sub $1k days. 

What you definitely should be doing is trying to understand the tech more, the fundamentals and usecase's. From that understanding you should be able to take the swings a little better, but experience in the swings helps a lot, as well, of course not investing more than you can afford to lose. 
It is so funny to see history repeat itself over and over... Dude, if you understand bitcoin, why would you think its a ponzi sheme? do you know what a ponzi scheme is ? first you were defending it (wihout understanding it aparently) and now, because the prize drops, you think its bad yourself?  


Invest in your education about Bitcoin first next time, and when you are really sure you know what you are doing, read it all again. and after that, debate your friends when they call it a ponzi.
"How could we ever get back to where we were 35 days ago?"
There’s needs to be a catalyst to bring in new money, such as a bitcoin ETF.
the thing that keeps my head straight during these times and something that you didn't mention is whether or not you believe in the technology, like the technology and see the long term value in the technology.  I may take a few years to come back though
There are many reasons why I believe it will rise exponentially again, here are a few:

* BTC has all the characteristics of sound money (durability, portability, divisibility, uniformity, limited supply, and acceptability) and does many of these things better than any other form.
* Development of bitcoin and LN continue at a feverish pace.
* The next financial crisis is right around the corner (is it always with FIAT systems?)
* Mining centralization is beginning to see the first signs of re\-decentralization with several new major ASIC manufacturers coming online.
* The worlds needs/wants/is hungry for a global currency free from any single governments control.
* History tends to repeat itself, this is not our first bubble, and short of a major undiscovered technical bug will not be our last, welcome to the hype cycle.

>***The  growth of adoption of Bitcoin and therefore bitcoin price is following  an S\-Curve of Technological Adoption, which is itself characterized by  fractally repeating, exponentially increasing Gartner Hype Cycles.***
> Can someone explain to me exactly how we will ever get back to 10K or 15K??

Doubtful, you need to do your own research, not line drawing or chart gazing, actual research about Bitcoin itself --the technical ins and outs, the infrastructure sprouting up around it, the numerous reports issued by Finance giants describing macro trends and the like etc. If you can get through all that and be a Bear well, fair enough. Most bears I know are clueless tho.
What did you believe in when it was at those levels? 

 Just because the price is so volatile doesn't mean it is finished.   It's hard to imagine it going back up when you feel low.  

When you have big companies investing hundreds of million in people,  infrastructure etc. They have done their homework.   Coinbase just opened their index fund today.   

The total market cap of crypto at its peak wasn't that high in terms of a sector (finance,  tech,  communication)   Bitcoin will be the 
 go-to medium in the near term for most crypto related projects and there's some very eager people who missed the boat this past year... just waiting for a good opportunity. Could be at 6k, 5k or 2k who knows... but it will go back up.  
Only adoption can help. Otherwise gambling.
We'll get there the same way we got there before. It's a lot closer than it was this time last year. 
>> 7700... break even point

I had to stop here, when even my mom got into crypto a few thousand dollars ahead of you, I don't expect you to understand much at all. 

Just to elaborate a bit more, I consider myself a crypto noob and I've been in the market since 2012 and following the space before that. You expect your understanding after only a few months is full enough to say that the sky is falling? Give me a break lol
I think its getting overly likely that this will be similar to the 2013\-14 bear market, but hopefully not for as long. 

We need to see interest decline further, proper capitulation, but it will likely be slow, with many fake\-outs and dead cat bounces on the way. Then we'd probably need a catalyst\-like event. My guesses are hype about the next halving, I know thats years away but people will probably buy in early in anticipation. Also a bitcoin ETF as someone already said would probably add more hype, similar to how futures brought us to 19k.

That being said it could be completely different to last time, and take off whenever we least expect it to (but i doubt this).
Do what everyone else does.  Look at its history and apply it to the future.  That's where people get these ridiculous price targets.  In all seriousness i think the whole space is screwed up.  BTC isn't the best at what it does but if the industry rallied around it and improved it (without hard forking it) and created a layer 2 for it so that dapps could be created for it utilizing ONLY BTC, then you'd see adoption increasing.  But what we have now is everyone wanting their own token or mainnet or both.  In comparison during the birth of the internet, you had the world wide web and then you had AOL and Compuserve, etc.. The AOLs are like the Ethereum/EOSs, where they try to create their own little space and content.  We know how this ended up, websites starting popping up everywhere and eventually the WWW won out.  One of the reasons was that the development environment encompassed everyone.  People with no previous programming experience now became website designers, teenagers could put up websites.  Similar to the mobile industry, everyone rallied around making apps for iOS and Android, again the development environment encompassed everyone.  12 year olds could make a game and become a millionaire.  Look what happened to Blackberry, windowsOS, Tizen, development stalled for these platforms so they faded.  Right now in crypto you only have AOLs (Ethereum/EOSs) and everyone wants their own token (their own little page within the AOL space).  Imagine every company wanting to sell their own proprietary hw/sw mobile phone?  Well, that's the situation in crypto now.  Can anyone name three widely adopted dapps not named cryptokitties?  Right now everyone is trying to get rich with ICOs but there's no incentive to get wealthy writing a dapp.  if you can write your own dapp might as well create your own ERC20 token and do an ICO and create more of a mess.  Are we there yet where art majors or teenagers are pumping out dapps? No, not even close.  Look at the mess you have to sort out to vote in this EOS mainnet launch.  Anyhow, once people realize that the way to go is to rally around BTC (or any other coin) and develop that, then you might see some of these ridiculous million dollar price projections that people pull out of their ass.  And no, BTC is not a ponzi scheme, it doesn't fit the definition of a ponzi scheme so i don't know why people keep referring to it as such.  It's just a speculative asset.  
Bounce of 6130, bounce of 6000, same thing.
Guess folks didn't want to wait, nice bounce off 6135 on gdax
it is still on 5250EUR (6142,5$). like 100BTC got eaten.

TL;DR, Short
Have you studied the project at all? Did you realize they are owned by a public company? that they have CEO and executives with 50 plus years in public companies between NASDAQ and LON? That they have 11 strategic alliances with long lasting software devs? That they have top optics and scientists with reputation on the line on that projects, including renowned professors, lead inventor of patents, and amazon engineer? There is literally no better, faster, more cost efficient way to build than with blockchain. Name one better mechanism where you can automate incentivization for best apps creation for devs like with blockchain via mining tokens for best reviewed apps for example. Gotta love ppl who opine on something without reading shit in the first place. This is the most legitimate project out there. Name other with 13 patents, 9 top scientists and backed by a public company
Who is the btc CEO again?
pretty much every comment in here nowadays; the longs dont want to be shamed
> Shorting is the only way to make money in Crypto now. 

Yes for the dumb and dimwitted.  For those who are better than that, traders will continue to profit from both the long and short side.
Well, that escalated quickly
Keep zooming out till it's all ok bb.
As we fell from 19k I kept hearing the same dumb argument:

If we hit 12k BTC is still up X.
If we hit 10k BTC is still up X.
If we hit 7k BTC is still up X.
If we hit 5k BTC is still up X.

The desperation is real.
Everyone has already jumped 
No one was wondering
Walmart has snorkel's on sale, might want to pick a bunch up for your underwater longs.

Delusional as always
Your novice is showing if you think this is just some guy dumping. 
Nice elaborate fantasy narrative there.  I hope things work out for you, in spite of it.
Cool story bro
I'm not.
You must be wealthy beyond belief if you know what buying/selling strategy 'everyone' is going to use.
Could've just been shorts taking profit expecting support at 6k
Bears - is this not an indicator for you yet? Here, let me add another one?

Guys - if bitcoin goes to 0, do I make infinity if I short it?

time to long
No
lol no.
I wish. (not that I would want to at this point though).
If you already own an asset, you can effectively 1x short it.
Why are you under this bizarre illusion that anything "needs" to happen, it doesn't.

BTC isn't some magical living being which needs to reach certain prices before moving again. 
[deleted]
That's only been said a million times, my man.  Honeybadger still don't give a fuck.  The only thing that changes in the Bitcoin market is the size of the bear rugs.
Paywalled
The sentiment would be that weak hands sell their coins without rebuying them later (as in a short). This also invalidates the premise Bitcoin is going completely down, else, why would bigger players be accumulating it? The standard model likely prevails: Scoop the coins cheap now, sell the same coins to the same people expensive later.
Brb, mortgaging everything to follow your prophecy.
All you downvotes. I guess the present-time earthlings aren't prepared to accept the future
Reasoning behind your prediction?
That might be fun to imagine and would certainly be fun to watch if true, but I think your post has little basis in fact and presents zero evidence to backup your prediction. 
What are you asking the noobs for?
Are you the noob shorting? 😁
[deleted]
Lol what? Daily volume jumped by ~70% with the previous dump
Short term there could be a rally to like 7k, but we havent even started the new correction yet, that happens when 6k breaks.
Every short is in the green because the market is currently at the lowest price it's been since the position bot was created.

I wouldn't read too much into it.
Every short is in the green at a local bottom. You could've said that at $7000
Now how the fuck do you know that dude? 
The fact that you're being downvoted to hell while giving sound advice is another nice bear indicator.
wow 3% and we're talking courage and vision huh 
can everyone chill the hell out with the taking their positions so personally

this is a trading sub
People that short/sell don't hate bitcoin, they just think its overvalued and want to re\-buy lower to increase their stack. Stop taking it all so personally.
Lolololollllll
How about the people who sold out >$14k and aren't holding bags like you?

We can still buy in now if we wanted and more than double our stack... 
Salty bears will downvote but you just spoke pure, distilled truth.
>worthless going to zero fudster permashort whores


>Not to be mean
SFYL
I’m with you man.  Fuck the downvotes.  Bitcoin has a way of teaching very hard lessons, don’t worry.
Permabears rekt
Hi5
Lol, just wait until we find out that some holding company under Buffet is accumulating BTC and is coming out with ETF products.
Dimon was obviously right from the start, and I laughed at everyone who laughed at him in these Bitcoin subs.
LOL not even close man....
2.1% a day if you calculate using closing price.

I've seen worse.
Checkings account? Is that like a paper wallet with interest? Which exchange offers that?
You know that a lot of those who are guessing the trend are short and making money?
No reversal? So you think it might go bellow $0 ? Or Bitcoin will declare bankrupcy?
Are you mad ?
 You either learn from your mistakes and do it right the next time, or you end up selling the bottom and keep calling bitcoin a Ponzi for the rest of your life.
Delicious salt. Thanks Mr Bagholder!
Nice, we need more of these for bottom confirmation 
The worst thing are all these incredibly jealous people crawl out of the woodwork. We get it, you missed out. Maybe someday you'll too become a millionaire.

I felt the same about 6700 so nope
Are you really going to tempt fate again after you did it yesterday and got it so wrong? Then you longed from 6730 afterwards...


It seems like the knife catchers are burning more coins here. Still, targeting a long in the 6100 range should give you a pretty good risk/reward position for a retest of 6400 or (potentially) 6800. 

Shorts are actually down 10%. We're likely seeing profit taking prop the price here, and the last batch of knife catchers hovering over the sell button on a breakdown of 6400. 
Lol they aren't unloading coins to try and force the price down. Similar to when we were at 7500, thesee people are merely holding price steady so that they can unload before another price drop to buy back cheaper.

If someone really wanted to tank the price, they would just do a giant market sell.
Dead on. I swear the downvoted comments are more valuable than the upvoted ones on the new, improved heavily astroturfed Reddit.

Can you name a few of the reasons why you are so confident in the green ahead? 
Your entries suck and your exits are even worse, and yet here you are acting like you are the next Warren buffet.

You were also confident only about a week ago that we would fly through $10k with no resistance...
If a large enough asteroid hits the Earth, who knows if any life would survive at all. Scary thought. 
Mtgox pumped the market with fake volume and orders during 2013.

I'm seeing a similar pattern in 2015. We tested the $200-$150 bottom about three times, peaking at ~$320 three times before breaking through that resistance. I'm hoping that $6000 is the bottom we see this year... No way to tell if it will be.

To be honest, I'm on the edge of my seat, waiting to see if 2018 is more analogous to 2015 or 2014. Just 6-ish more months to know for sure.

Too many big words for the simpletons.  You are talking about shorting and covering and then reshorting higher.  Many of them do not comprehend that.
Since this wedge was very clear on a weekly interval, i consider that interval first and foremost when charting it.  So weekly closed outside of wedge 3 days ago is confirm #1 of break down, lower low made yesterday is confirm #2 of break down.  A shorter could take their entry at confirm 1, confirm 2, or wait for a bounce to the break down point (approx $7,040) before entering a short position.  Or all 3.
Oh absolutely. If we bounced here, that's a double bottom.

I just don't see the buying volume here. There's room enough on conventional RSI (4hr/1d) but we could just as easily hover here till RSI 'heats up' (that's the opposite of cool down I suppose?) and drop to kobold village.
If it's any consolation, it makes me weep too. I'm convinced in a year we'll be laughing about these times though.
Nice one.
You just described my life.

Honestly I think I've got till the end of 2018. In Feb when they were telling me to sell (eep) I said wait till at least end of 2018. *If you can't handle me at my 80\% corrections you don't deserve my two year bear mark\- fuck wait sorry come back it'll go up I swear*
You should frame it as a sign of strength :/
This is really nice to see. This is how my wife is. She believes in me. Period. Regardless of where the price is.

On that same note, I also wouldn't let her down. I bought in in late December. I'm sure you can imagine how that turned out.

But because I'd never let her down or hurt that belief in me, I learned TA and started trading, and took up a gig writing crypto articles and getting paid in crypto.

Despite buying in at the absolute worst possible time, I'm up from my initial investment, albeit only slightly.

It's that belief in me that drives me to succeed no matter what. I wish more people had that in life.
In their defense, my SO worries because I vocalized my concerns *allllll* the time when I was new. Am I buying at the right time, should I trade with x&#37; or y&#37; of my holdings, should I time the market based on TA or sentiment etc. When you hear about all this without really understanding it (or the crypto space in general) I think it leads to them worrying that it's all goblin town.

I'm the one doing the risky young\-adult investment, my SO has the sensible saving down. It's all my own money and it's money we could afford to lose. 

That all said, it's perfectly normal for someone's SO to be worried when your portfolio has dumped potentially 80&#37; in half a year (disregarding your entry point) as that's you know, 80&#37; of the way to zero.
Everyone who talks about their SO here is whipped I've noticed. Probably just a sign of the times than anything specific to this sub.
Cool, its obviously been awhile since that line has been tested (since before I started trading BTC). Just trying to see if anyone could speak to how reliable of a resistance it might be.
Not op but, why not GDAX? I don't day trade but i use gdax since Coinbase already has my identity info. They have lower fees than coinbase so i figured why not. For any BTC gain focused trading I use wex.nz since they allow anonymous traders.
I guess it doesn't matter if it's GDAX or not.....the bounce off the 200 day EMA line of the 3 day chart is pretty similiar across all exchanges from what I see (using cryptowat.ch).
Yea...Lil scary. 

I'm not worried til they actually figure out how to do it though. 

Someone here shorted like 10 contracts lol

It'll take them a week before they understand the difference between leverage and contract size so we at least have a week before the bottom. 
I'm not sure. For what it's worth the average leverage is under 10x, at least of Arthur is to be believed 
This is a pretty good attempt at an accurate calculation. Although it is over a year old, it does highlight the inaccuracies of many estimations of Bitcoin mining energy consumption.
Hey, I'll take a rise like 2011-2015 over the next three years! That would put us at, what, a half mil per coin?

> Even on reddit every single sub you visit everyone's trash talking Bitcoin when the subject comes up.

This was true even during the run up to 20K.  It is simply proof that this is not a bubble any more than it was at 1K. During the dotcom bubble, everyone was rah rah rah.
> There's a huge trend these days of people reading a headline and then creating their own reality.

Yeah because this used to be different in the good old days
There is alot of other shady shit beeing done and I dont think crypto mining qualifies as "shady shit" atm.  
Also the negative impact of say emissions from cars or plastic into the oceans is waaaaaaaaay more important than complaining about more enegry consumtion, even though some might come from coal power plants.
Just use it in cold climate and turn it into heat  or hook up heat to a sterling engine and recapture the HEAT WASTE! prob solved for the most part.
Think about the current usefulness of banks Vs Bitcoin and then read what you wrote again. If the bitcoin network collapsed tomorrow, society would move on and no one would give a shit. If all banks collapsed at the same time, society would be in deep shit. Bitcoin is not providing any fundamental utility that is necessary for society at the moment.
So banking is 200% more energy but how many people are using banks vs crypto. 
I'm scaling into a long as my assumption is $6k won't break this go around... it's also possible that $6.1k was the low before a short term uptrend.  If resistance at $6.4k looks like it will kick price down then I'll reverse and go short. 
Sounds good!

Wyckoff Accumulation, then “The Recovery:Is Bitcoin Bouncing Back?”, China and India regulate instead of banning, ETF gets closer, halving.

All with a sprinkling of Institutional Money ;)
Good news in bear markets do nothing. Bad news in bull markets do nothing. The price will reverse when there are more buyer than sellers. Today's excess of sellers is primarily those trying to buy coins cheaper. I don't think everybody will get what they're aiming for, and the price will slowly creep away from folks when they finally capitulate and buy back at a loss. Only a very few will actually profit I think.
>China unbans crypto trading

Speaking of, rumour has it that CN might be relaxing the death grip on BTC trading.  If so, what are the odds that the market is being brought back down to where it was when places like OKCoin BTC/CNY market went dark ($6185 USD as shown on Bitcoinwisdom)?
My stop loss is always a single order price. I will spread out stops in profit, though. 
That gives us lower a breakout point. Three points of contact on each line--looks good.

edit: are you on log or linear? 
He's double shorting, basically he alone is the one ruining BTC.
The long:short ratio is also widening again as shorts are closing. I think we're seeing profit-taking pushing the price up here more than anything else. Probably watching the wedge, though, and the potential double bottom of 6400 from April. 
imo, if I were you I would just let the shorts run. Close a short if you consider taking a long. *Would* you take a long now? Just my 2 cents
Yep she held all year, I think it is probably a definite sign, the whales always know how to bring people right to that breaking point, make them sell, and then go up.

Because anyone that has been in the space for awhile is not at all surprised by market manipulation. So tether was probably used to pump? No real surprise there, people have been saying that since it's inception. 

Has anything actually changed? No. Is tether still being used? Yes. Are whales manipulating the price? Yes.

It's inevitable, don't you know.  
A spring by definition is a new low, so we'd be in the 5's (or lower) before we could even consider it that.

There are patterns that could play out without a spring tho, to be fair - essentially an extended sideways around the time a spring would normally take place.
Thanks for this. I agree. I'm puttin my spring near 5500, if 5500 breaches then paradigm shift and need to reanalyze
It's basically the bulls version of the bear's bubble chart. Readjust and repost as necessary.
Straws are all they have left at this point.
The only difference is, this isn’t specific to a certain price range.

Maybe I was hybridizing the two (fib and Wyckoff) in my head, but I definitely have a lot more research to do about a lot of things.  Thanks for the direction though!
I agree it could go lower...but somewhere I read that once you get to the 0.2 level most people have given up or just don’t give a damn anymore, which supports the 2014/2015 narrative of stagnant prices once the bottom was discovered.

If you want to get the tinfoil hat out, you could apply that to any of the commodities I listed, but they average out to 0.24 (0.21 if you remove the extreme outlier or the invalidated values) which is close enough to support that argument.
Nahhh
True I cannot guarantee that BTC will be more valuable in the long run. Just as you can't say they will be less valuable. I guess I will own speaking with conviction as my mistake there.

I am just going off of my experience and my belief in what the asset class represents. I personally can't see a world in even a medium term time frame where BTC is worth less than it is. 

>**"the die hards will rather own $1 BTC than sell it."**  
>  
>That's a good thing?

Most certainly, it establishes a price floor. $1 was an exaggeration because I can't tell you what the price floor is but it is likely above $1.

> **"Everyone here feels super rational in the grand scheme which makes me happy. We understand that the price going down is out of our control and it’s totally fine."**  
>  
>Sounds very much like you are incredibly scared and trying to reassure yourself

Nope :).

Again just comparing the comments and behavior to when we were at 6.2k last to now. 

My point here is that volatility comes from excess buying and selling beyond what our liquidity controls. This is a finite asset afterall. If (and I say IF) folks remain calm and buy (OR not panic sell) we will stabilize.

\-\-\-\-\-\-

I've given observations, you have written 3 sentences. Please state your rationale and what you believe if you want to have a discussion.

I genuinely have no desire to sell and will not be motivated to sell \- I've seen this countless times over the past few years. I'm sure at some point my conviction will be put to the test which I KNOW is the biggest indicator to buy. So yeah I'll be the one buying if we get to $1 (or $1000, $5000 and also right now).

Haha that'd be way stressful. Especially if this is a bear market. I don't do margin trading. Plus if you're on the wrong side of a pump or dump can wipe off weeks of progress.


BTC is rewarding me since 2013 ;) People who are selling when daily RSI is sub 30 usually don't win, so taking advantage of that.
I sort of initially wrote it off but it's worth looking at. Unfortunately this is one of those things that will look true until it isn't. 

Also I'm not a *huge* Wyckoff guy, need to read more about it still tbh. 

In a weird way I do sort of hope it is accumulation and think it is possible. But this is one of those things that will only look wrong in a month or two.

Hate comments like this. You sit on your high horse acting like the rise to 20k and subsequent drop to 6k was obvious only because you’re stating it after the fact. Examine your own biases.
That’s solid advice. I will try it! 
This makes the most sense without a doubt. The resistances above will be brutal.

More like shorts profit taking and buying for bounce. 
Some Finex shorts closed out on the bounce so far. I imagine if it stalls here they will rise again
[deleted]
Because we already had the big move? People longing BTC @ 18k after 6 months of price increases was FOMO. People shorting BTC @ 6k after 6 months of price decrease is also FOMO.
IMO its a descending triangle and they're shorting the bottom of it. 6k added at basically the same price level is crazy(especially after a 1k dump), its fear of missing out of the dump, greed, whale food, rarely ends well. Also it removes sell pressure from the ~15% dump we need to have after 6k with already oversold RSI. Sure we might get there without a bounce but its going to take a while.
I didn't say that.  
5k is the next main support if this breaks and everyone shorting is assuming we go there, but since "everyone" is shorting, we're not going to go there because that removes sell pressure. Which means we have to go sideways/up for a while until we get more sell pressure to push us down. For whales its very profitable to push us up and down and trap us, so they wait until it stops working before they start buying. For accumulators its not interesting to buy resistance/expensive, so they wait for lower prices(2-5k) before they buy bigger amounts, hence removing any buy pressure higher up. Which means unless we see complete market capitulation (i.e. the price is unable to go lower because buyers outweigh sellers) we're not going to see a recovery. Shorter said it just means that when the price is bouncing around like crazy this high up its simply too profitable for whales to buy and hold and its too expensive for accumulators to start buying bigger amounts.

I've had a hedge short, continuously, for the last three months, but sometimes I reduce some of it so I am net long.   I haven't been continuously long more than a day at the time, max.  I am usually net short.
PeaceHere is the ultimate contrary indicator. When you see him getting long, you short. When you see him short, you long. It is the ultimate way to make money. I am not even saying this to be mean to him or discredit him in any way. I am being totally serious here. 
Yeah didn't wanna say that but...he's doing the same exact thing again. o_O 


I meant selling. People sell if they think the price is going down. Once everybody thinks that, my assumption is all the selling has been done already.  For example, I believe with fairly high confidence we will see a reversal to over $7k within the week. I am saying this precicely when it is at peak unpopularity to say. If people *thought* this was a fakeout, they would not have sold. Thus here we are, about to go up, regardless of what lines on graphs say, IMO. Whether it continues after that I haven't the faintest idea.

I sold 10% of my stack between $10k and $19k on the way up. Added back half that at half price, or thereabouts.
The only reason I have a "landslide top post" is because I am admitting that I am dumb and in the minority.
How can they sell it to 0 if they don't yet have my coins? Trust me, the price on them is quite high.
What a load of bullshit, exchanges, Coinbase and the ecosystem are healthier than ever not to mention CME futures this is a dream compared to what we had in 2013 with mt gox imploding, China bans and only the tiny (at the time) Serbia bitstamp. 

I mean I think it was clear that the "support" would be broken while we were inside the triangle.

I think you need to maintain a certain % of equity, I remember an all in short from 9.2 had a liquidation point of 10.3
Last time it wasn't technically a squeeze, it was just stops. No one got squeezed from $6.5 to $8k. They just had tight stops and apparently someone knew it...
Personally I don't think usage and adoption need to necessarily go hand in hand. I believe adoption is really the more important of the two. If referring to usage in the sense that Bitcoin is used to make day to day purchases and accepted by merchants worldwide, although I don't rule it out, I don't think this is its strength. To me at least the digital gold scenario is a far more attractive use case.
Not to kick you in the balls but I bought BTC at $160-180 on the 20th January 2015. The very bottom.  :P

September has wrecked me way too often. I shorted the breakdown from 6.4 hard on swaps, set b-e stops and removed them when I saw the rally back, looking to close manually, held my breath and made it through. But now that it looks like it might climb again I might close to make a tiny scalp profit. Not sure if I want to hold all the way back to 6.4.
Stopped. 
🙋🏼‍♀️
Exactly. Who waits 6 months until we are 70% down to decide to sell. Everybody calling for lower prices is already short.
Feb was lower. The lower it is, the more fear there is.
Feb 6 hit 8, which is not surprising since people thought the price would never stop dropping. It just seems more squished because the capitulation and rebound was much quicker then.

April is a bit surprising though, considering it seemed everyone was setting buy orders around $6k for a double bottom. Meanwhile, it seems everyone is expecting mid-to-low $5ks here.
Feb was going straight down. Everyone saw that. Now we're slowly bleeding. Nobody sees cause everyone waiting for BGD.
Occam's Razor at its finest
Probably not a good call. Had one add hit already. I might just bail.

!short XBTUSD add 6350 10%
If we bounce to over 6500, that's not a pitiful bounce.
Heh, that went quickly. 
I hit that short bottom exactly when 6400 fell, thought all the stops around this previous low would take us to at least 6200 :(
I was one of them :(, longed again tho.
IMO LTC and ETH are valid. The rest is garbage 
Hopefully this crash will be the final purge. Edit: well.. at least until the next fomo cycle (if)
I've been saying it for 6 months now than we won't find a bottom until 99.99&#37; of alts are completely dead. I get down\-voted every single time.

Edit: don't really have a point.

Edit 2: I guess the point was they could leverage a long.
And you thought you'll wake up to 6.9 ;-)
Yeah that's a theory but impossible to prove. But we also saw irregular selloff [ealier this year](https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-exchange-okex-denies-manipulation-claims-futures-rollback/) conveniently at the day of Futures closing. But keep in mind this is partially a *whales! boogeyman!* meme.
When is it? 
to be fair, it seems like no one listens when the price is up/exploding. it take a sobering dump or bear market for this stuff to gain traction because that's when people care
Yeah it really seem like they always time it impeccably.
Well we've been in a downward spiral since January, so when would you like them to release the articles?
But the intention of printing Tether is to buy bitcoin, so the correlation is normal. The question should be whether those Tether are backed.
The question, Watson, is who is doing the buying and when. 

If it's traders, we'd expect to see a balance of selling into tether when the price drops and buying back BTC on the upswing, organically distributed. Instead, we see huge buys immediately after a new batch of USDT has been created. 

One entity (call them a whale) using trades to impact price in huge ways is the definition of manipulation. How is it even a question for this sub that this is going on?
A double bottom is a "safe" long play. It's very obvious. The aggressive trade us assuming it will break, which he's doing. 

The total lack of a strong bounce here suggests to me it's going  down further 
The technical target from that triangle break is something like $1300, see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8qfytx/daily_discussion_tuesday_june_12_2018/e0k7d1r/) for details. If we'd hit massive support on high volume here I would have re-evaluated that, but there's no reason to yet.

Bitcoin really likes blow-off tops and blow-off bottoms before it reverses.
interesting place to short
That's risky, hope you have a tight stop. I'm letting shorts from $7250 ride. There's likely to be a lot of turbulence going forwards.
Correct, the run\-up to the short squeeze took about 12 days.
First 2 weeks of April we were hovering same 6500\-7000 levels sideways, while adding more and more shorts. The anticipated breakout downward never happend.

A bear flag is sort of a parallel channel that has an upward angle before ultimately breaking down (more often than not in theory)...like an upside-down flag at the bottom of a flagpole which is the big drop candle(s)

It's nothing new to bounce off the other side of a trendline as a continuation pattern. It's if we get below that trendline then we have unexplored territory. Even 2014 bounced off (but didn't go below) the trendline that was broken 6 months from the start of the retrace. It also took 6 months from breaking that trendline and 6 months again to bounce off the otherside of it (~$140ish).
Yeah I see it now.

If this trendline breaks and we break the previous low. This will be the true capitulation test.

I think at this point this is where the market wants to go
I have the line slightly lower on the chart I have but I know there were a few different ways to draw it that gave different results. Thing is I'm actually getting more bearish as we approach it because the market doesn't look ready for these prices but then bitcoin usually looks dead right before it dildos up just I'm aware that during a capitulation we'll probably be oversold massively on the daily TF and I would like to catch the majority of that candle if I can.

I hedged 8500 on the assumption that we wouldn't break 9.1 (IIRC). We did but OBV was showing growing divergence on the 12 hour chart so I thought I'd keep the hedge open. I didn't really expect 10K to be much of a resistance point but it makes sense that it would in a downtrend being the last of the 5 digit BTC (I don't think 5 digits was a big deal in the bull run because so many people were legit waiting for 6 digits). Turned that hedge into a full balance BFX(in BTC so 2.3x) short when it started to look really likely to at least correct around 9.7 and I expected a test of this line at least, which is why I let the hedge run so long and I'm not really ready to give up my long term short since my target was 4.65\-5K anyway but I'm skeptical if it will even bounce enough for me to get an entry in the high 8K or low 9K range before the market changes direction at which point I wanna be long and not short (which is why I'm trying to hedge my position rather than TP so I get the both of best worlds with a  market stop in profit on both after a day or two in the black)

Thing is my position is nice and comfortable now so at best I'm going to take off my short and leave a full hedge (incl the 15x I done of my monthly bitmex gambling money that I bought around 0.045 @ the 10K top and shorted down and I almost have a full BTC currently at 0.65btc incl the unrealized gains and any further gains I may have in this downtrend) until I see signs of a trend change. If I keep that money in mex and have another 10\-15x month I'd be on my way to making back my losses from last year which is my goal, it's an ambitious goal but achievable especially if I can get a decent enough stack before it bottoms out and wait for the market to establish an uptrend and only scale in (low) leverage positions during a correction. I can use my BFX position to essentially pre\-hedge my potential profits and buys lower down.

There's probably a lot of survivorship bias because the only rule to not getting liquidated was not go over 2x leverage long (using cash not btc) and only hedge your BTC you wouldn't have gotten liquidated but that rule no longer applies. I think the majority of long term holders(of which a minority own the majority of BTC most likely) are probably at the level of wealth that they are no longer happy to lose no matter how much they may think differently on the rise up.

This is partly why I think we may be more bearish now than 2014 even though the rise in 2013 was insane because we had 2 bubbles(and this bull run has attracted people who want to take up trading but know little about BTC). I think part of the HODL mentality is because people know they can't sell the top so they'd rather sell the final bottom at very least which is a great strategy if bitcoin was a sure thing but it really isn't and a tiny bit of doubt goes a long way in a market dominated by fear and greed. I'd like to believe that people actually believed the whole 1BTC=1BTC thing (I used to \- I now have a nuanced view of bitcoin that isn't 'it's going to take over the world' or 'its totally going to fail' ) but the focus on price instead of tech in r/bitcoin clearly shows that not to be the case. It goes to show how much the community has shifted towards the price instead of the tech when you notice there's actually more tech conversations going on in r/buttcoin than r/bitcoin (that's a little hyperbolic but you get the idea \- the break of 9K was like 25 vegeta posts on the front page of r/Bitcoin)... 

The level of tech talk is probably directly inversely correlated to price so I guess it is understandable since it did have an insane gain and this is probably good for bitcoin in the sense that in a bear market the people who got in for the price will hopefully get captivated by the tech thus allowing the cycle to start over.
Previous low and intersection with log support from ATH
First bottom horizontal from ATH, current S2 pivot point AND close to the ATH down trand line could be support now.
Seeing this a lot on the lower timeframes but when back-testing it's quite rare on the 2 day. This could be like august/september 2014 though.
> I have more money in bitcoin 

I thought you are short at the moment?
why? decribe your position(s)...
\>Shorting now would be slightly insane

Dude you [told that to me at \>$9k a month ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8e0z4r/daily_discussion_sunday_april_22_2018/dxwzodp/) saying I wouldn't make any money by shorting. Why should we listen to you if you say shorting is insane since the top?

Maybe the r/r for a short here isn't actually the best. Maybe we test the breakout of the triangle or bounce to the high 6k range. But shorting has been the play all year. I do think we'll cool off for a bit before breaking $6k though
Already being posted about 6 times in the past few hours. So yes. And unlike the 6th we won't know if it's true for about 1-2 months 
Many a truth are said in meme 
I mean didn't we only get to $6800 after that? 

I agree that that's the closest thing we've gotten to a strong bounce in a while though 
April's BGD bounced up and down in the 64-69 range for a while.  The alt/btc ratio started recovering around this time.  Shorts started greatly outweighing longs.
The trend is your end.
Reversal trades is more my style. Usually can manage risk well with enough patience and strategy. Messed it up bad this time. 
Shorting right now is dangerous, this is setting up for another push up (just set tight stops on my short).
Unless he waits for a bounce to short.

If he has tight stops this is a good place to long (in theory) 
Nobody knows the trend.
I do have. But this week put a noticeable dent in it. 
Because a 4% drop here breaks the April low and goblin town is confirmed if we break April low 
If he has a reasonable stop and manage risk properly then he should be good, man. No need to FUD anyone.
Bear Market confirmed. 
Missed his post, as usual [/u/\_chewtoy\_](/u/\_chewtoy\_) seems to have nailed it once again.
You are cutting a bit at the 17K top, if you adjust it slightly it should match my line no? 

It's too much of a coincidence that the slope of this current dump matches almost perfectly with that line
Yes, on bitfinex it appears to be lower, but if you move the line a bit to the right it appears to match the support of this dump. 

I'll leave it like this for now until it gets invalidated
It's Log scale
checking
Yep

Need to rethink this now. I'll get back to you tomorrow.

tldr; bulls are in a bad position with leverage


I'm saying that shorts have been so over-leveraged for so long that if they start closing they have a long way to drop... and the willingness to pay fees to wait it out probably aren't there.

The definition of a "bull market" is vague, unlike the conditions I showed and described.
It's the last 7 months of data. Is that cherry picking?

I didn't say they're net negative on interest.

What does this post have to do with being a mod?
>  im stupid

I wouldn't go that far, but you clearly don't understand /u/jarederaj 's recent posts if you think they have been "overwhelmingly toward price heading up"

Maybe give them another read to be fair?
straight up. dear lord guys my butt is not ready


actually it's only bullish when he makes a profit and adds a bigger position size closer to the bottom 
But would he end up with exactly the same amount like before? That would be a huge coincidence
i don't know that's probably the problem. the quantity was 72 and 50x leverage... does that answer the question.. i don't see any fields for position or contract "size"
Or maybe he wants some peace after months of bear market. That's what I did too. 1000 bitcoin could not pay for my mental wellbeing.

Well, actually it could, but you get my point.
Never go full Fiat because inflation is theft.
lol don’t screw with the man’s head damnit. Stick to your plan ol’ chap!
Then I wait till it reaches my target. I'm not going to just crap the bed because it goes up and entertain the fear of missing out and make a stupid mistake. I've waited few months, another few won't really drive me nuts.

I've been here everyday since I set a Target and have paid close attention to people who are pragmatic in their approach and set myself reasonable targets to get in based on their experience, charts, knowledge and research and combined that with mine to give myself the X target where I'm comfortable with.

It's just that sweet spot I want it to hit so I can sit back and ride the choo choo train! 

End of the day, no one knows what's going to happen. So then I just buckle up and enjoy the ride. 
That's actually my intention. I have an X amount to go in with. Once there I'm mentally ready to DCA and play around with certain percentage of extra fiat that I've already kept aside to use incase things decide to not go the way I want them to go. 

I don't want the moon right away. I want to wet my feet here and get the feel of things before letting crypto throw me totally off.

It's a thrill and I want this thrill to be a meaningful one. 
I switched to my laptop, had to click the "authorize new device" link they email, then switched back later and clicked the old email link again on accident. Then I got a message saying I exceeded my daily attempts and my account would be locked for 24hrs.
Except $50K is 150% above the ATH formed during a blow-off top. $1200 is the technical target for the breakdown of the daily pennant.

That said, I'm bearish, but I don't think we're going down nearly that far. I'd be shocked if we broke $4K. 
Well said.  We're almost there
For me and a lot of friends it has become indifference to this market.  I have buys in for some things I like if they dump, but I’m not taking large bets.  I don’t see despair because none of my friends are in above their heads.  Bring on the blood.  The more bloody it gets the more likely I’ll dump some cash into the market.  The thing is I just don’t really care.  Bitcoin explodes to 15k next week I don’t really care.  It dumps to 3k, fine with me.  Indifference.  
For me despair was the best thing ever in 2015. But I didn't sell. I wrote it off, stashed my wallet and lived my life. I don't think I even checked the price for over a year. Next time I paid attention to Bitcoin, it was nice to see that it had made me richer. Pretty sure it will work out that way for a lot of people this time too.
I'm even *depressed* bullish.
Except they still have to manage their wallet/keys safely.
It has to bounce at some point .. i hope 
Yea which I have around $6327 right now.

Would probably just bail under $6300. Worth the 27$ difference instead of getting stopped out prematurely 
Honestly I think you are right.

Time will tell.
There's about a dozen indicators that haven't been crossed or hit since 2014 that recently crossed/hit

no one wanted to listen to ol sloppy though 😞 

The one worrying me most lately is that the "embarrassment" is back. People are seeing bitcoin/crypto as a scam and it's going to be like 2014/2015 where people don't enter because there's a huge stigma
I don't know....I never pay attention to MAs, which is probably dumb and lazy of me, but I don't.
You may get that wish in the future.   And you probably won't buy then, because it will on its way even lower.

I was there at $163 and it was not a fun day.
If we go sub 6k I am quite sure we do not rebounce just a few USD lower. At least we should see 5.8k. Dont get why you have your target at 5995.
Sloppy says it much more eloquently than most. Or me at least. 

Sell yo wife sell yo kids....
*"I'm not convinced on the triple bottom narrative seeing how the double bottom played out"*

The double bottom had to have played out that way, in order for a triple bottom to happen.
me neither. i was up watching gdax 5800 and you had seconds to buy the bottom before it roared up
If we count triple then 11.7 was highest, double bottom is above 10k.
Holy fucking bounce 
Order in place @5X, that's the maximum kraken handles.
Will lose at most 0.5%.

Now i just have to wait and see if we get there again... That could be the tricky part
"path of most pain"
yes I think most people are afraid, and that is why I think there will be just this one chance where the brave ones get rewarded. its a one shot, if you dont buy you might end up buying at the range where we are now. (Disclaimer: This might be 100&#37; wrong what I am writing.)
If we pumped to above $11k recently I don't think it'd be unreasonable to be expecting $12k+. 
Wow, i gotta try that sometime
Lmao is that an actual quote
Theres a channel dedicated to the theory(called hyperwave) he's appeared on Tone Vays trading show and his partner is actually Tone Vays host Leah. He seems pretty legit and he's been pretty spot on with his calls on bitcoin on longer(weekly-monthly) timeframes. They are pretty much bubble predictions and I'm not sure if this guys system is as refined as the guy on the hyperwave channel. We did have a bubble like this in 2013 that corrected and then went full retard. It's possible if anything we've heard about big money getting in is true even if I think the tech isn't there yet. Alts are still a thing and very little have a use case so the crypto bubble has yet  to pop.

I disagree with it but I see it as a possibility(maybe not $1M but continuation of the 2017 bubble which would likely take us to 6 figures)  especially if 5K does end up being the bottom, maybe this is what the longs are hoping for on finex... I think we're on track for sub 3K eventually even if only for a short while (the author says would invalidate the hyperwave theory below with a weekly close below 4K and is not even valid until 5K is reached)
Ye 1M is a bit OTT but I think it could play out into 6 figure if 5K holds. That's my most optimistic outlook and I've been pretty bearish since we had that 4K 4 hour candle on the way up warning people that it's going to correct and of course was told that I was stupid when I said 12K was my target.... Not saying this will play out, I'm actually expecting sub 3K for at least a brief period but it's always good to remember just how bullish BTC can be in a downtrend. This market sentiment changes so damn quickly you'd swear everyone involved in crypto was bipolar.
Yeah this is probably nothing more than a DCB.. It's looking pretty weak
How nice of you <3
eggsactly
i think its really risky for a whale type person to drive the price much lower.  They could easily get smoked by another whale 
Which is even more bearish, as shorts are actively going down pretty fast and the price remains static lol
Indeed, shorts have dropped by 2k on finex
> Make fun of moon boys and hodlers all you want, but they've been right so far.

No they've repeatedly been wrong, especially this year.  And right and wrong other years.
To be fair, the majority of the first world has heard of bitcoin but I would bet my hodl stack that when pressed, most have no clue what it actually is and wouldn’t be able to explain it. Misunderstandings often lead to misinterpretations. 

Edit: you are absolutely right though that if people remain ignorant about what bitcoin is and what it isn’t, it’s def not good. 
This board really started looking like a lot of zombie stocks i used to trade.  The communities are all traders, not even bulls.  We still have bulls, though.  Really we should be scouting out the next fad.



I'm genuinely curious. What will / would it take for you to actually change your sentiment?
(°◡°) ♡
Lol 
If we find bottom in the 6000 range, 6300 is still a good entry\-point by bitcoin standards.    Rarely, if ever, do you buy the very bottom.

Remember, it is extremely unlikely that oversold RSIs hang around on longer time frames, empirically speaking.    If I lose my bet, at least I bet on something that's positive EV, statistically speaking.
I'm not calling $400 lol you misunderstood. When u see $400 swings in 15 minutes consecutively  that's when the bottom is in.
Welcome back mate 
called it
Weekly RSI is at 41, but dipped down to about 28 in 2015, so certainly could go much lower.
what if i told you there has not been a hard dump since the feb lows

thats a good point. thanks for pointing it out!
So the dollar collapses completely and the yuan takes over?  3000 yuan will be worth like a million dollars in 2022 according to your chart.
Bro.. when, of all people, you start having doubts, maybe I will start buying
Thanks for the note, will do :)
LOL **should be between 0 and 6624.45**
Lol. :)

It's not like that. I'd be a millionaire if I could predict that :P

But tbh it's not looking good if you want go long.
>Your gut is pretty good lately, damn dude O_O

Bearish sentiment, when accurate, is often indistinguishable from food poisoning. 
It was always pretty good, never traded on it though.

But thanks :)
yes 
They can both play out
Sure, maybe.  I have been waiting for that last push down.  Descending wedge formation with channel support, handle support, and horizontal support there was bound to be a bounce.  Damn good odds of reversal here.  Now I wait again.  
No potential bottom?  There is a clearly defined potential bottom - 0.

I'll buy all the way down to 0, but I do agree that advising family is not wise.


There were people advising relatives to buy when we were dropping to 3k last year so I am not sure this is much of an indicator.

A new bagholder is born everyday. 
lol years 
> Price for btcusd should be between 0 and 6624.45

That's comical.
Thanks! You still planning on adding to your short at 6.4?

I opened a cheeky little long at 6230 earlier so for the first time in awhile my trade is in opposition to yours - so curious to know your plans.
$3500 would be my target for this year and $2200 for early 2019.  This is just based on the chart and trend lines.

$1200 is certain possible, just not tomorrow.  But if the price bleeds down there over the next 18 months, it won't seem "cheap" at all at that point.
Are you shorting this?

If not then it doesn't count.
Cuz that’s what mature people do
For every seller there is a buyer.
> when they're sitting behind their computers stressing out about the price

Speak for yourself, a lot of us here can see the big picture and not too caught up in the moment, remember kids only invest what you can afford to lose and you won't have your problem. 
So? Smart money doesn’t buy all at once. They’ve likely been dollar cost averaging 
Send BTC to Bitmex. Then sell contracts using leverage of 2 or higher
Nah he should go short 1000x
even though I agree with you... the lack of buying pressure really is amazing.

I remember when we hit 6400 the first time in Feb and there were bounces galore.

It all feels pretty fucked at this point
Would've worked pretty well 
Don't. Just don't. You lost enough. Let it settle for a bit.
I went long. 

I’ll let u know in an hour or 2 if my anus is rekt 
I'm scaling into longs and alts
Just hope it plays out faster. 
February 2015 was so depressing
And if Chad opened the long a bit too late, the difference will be paid from the [insurance fund](https://www.bitmex.com/app/insuranceFund). And if the insurance fund is empty, then OP would be "[auto deleveraging](https://www.bitmex.com/app/autoDeleveraging)" (ADL) and indeed only get 2 BTC. 

ADL was an initial reason for me to stop using Bitmex some time ago (got ADL with ETF denial on like a 5-10% drop), but these days it barely happens AFAIK.
What if there is no Chad or he runs out of money?
The hashrate remains unchanged, https://fork.lol/pow/hashrate, i.e. the variation is within standard limits. 
What are you waiting for, go flip the switch again!
I'm interested. How do you have free electricity? 
Im sure as well. I meant only short term
Everybody thinks it's going to moon.
Lololol i love it.  
Divorcing from a position and switching to a opposite one is too difficult for some.
Never said that, im a bear. But it was not the moment to go short . For the short term.
>1700 

lol that is not very much for the real market makers. 
Unless he just moves it again like he has every time it's been attacked. 
Well of course I understand why people would close their shorts. I see the same indicators as everyone. 

But this is not a bull market, this is a bear market. How many times in 2017 did we get a severely overbought RSI and the market kept on going up. Closing your longs there would have burned you.

But people are scared to hold shorts in bear market.

Anyway, like the other guy said I'm probably taking this to hard. I'm keeping my positions and I'll let people decide what's their positions.
If it falls through where do you short/sell then? 

You'll likely end up doing it lower.

There's a huge difference between selling the local low after visiting the same price point 3 times over 5 months and not selling a parabolic blow off top after seeing new ATHs every week for 5 weeks straight. 

You could use this justification at every single new low. But we're not even seeing new lows. 

I'm not exactly telling anyone to short or sell here, but people acting like it's crazy are seeing this in a strange way. People are talking about this price point like it's a new low and they're shorting the bottom of the bottom like it's $2k or something
I am. Maybe I should not. 
As you pointed out, I was implying that there are no wicks, only slow grind till bottom.

My comment about wicks was because I see a lot of people putting limit order to try to catch bottom. But I don't think this is useful unless you want to catch a knife.
Yeah have broken a resistance and got a nice push. I'm not sure this will end in a short squeeze though. Whales have the capital to push for a true short squeeze, but I don't see why they would do that at the moment. 

I'm only adding to my shorts right now.
I have the same support. I'm shorting ETH expecting an overcorrection, but if eth falls 20%, btc should fall at least 5%.
Or it just over corrected before and gone lower than the rest.

My target is 420 or so because that's where support should be.

Even so i might close it sooner and re short any bounces. Don't see it just droping to 420 in one move 
I tried to get the top from $9.3k to $11.7k like 4 times. Lost a lot of money..Made sure I didn't lose it all though. Pays off in the end if you get the big move. Just can't blow your load too fast. Longing near the bottom really isn't stupid at all. 


It'll look stupid until it looks genius. and it will look genius at some point 
Never meant to say that. Just stated something to have in mind.
Lots of regulations, exchanges not wanting to be fucked with registering for securities 
Christmas is going to be rough this year

edit: my bullish bias finds a way to spin this into a positive: essentially if other coins are going to be called securities, then they could be subject to stricter regulation, and could be taxed differently. Therefore, it's possible that people who hold those coins who don't want to be subject to those regulations (or the possibility of regulations) could move money to BTC to avoid regulatory exposure/risk. 
We need sideways for like 3 months then up.
I'm saying that may happen if we break down from here. This is our last level of support. But if we recover soon, it will be bullish.
Ya but I like selling at the bottom of a drop and being forced to watch horizontal movement for 12 - 18 hours

is down, and yes of course. I want to hedge against the loss of my coins with a short
Time. To. Go. Long....
Yikes 6.4k support broke again. All aboard the goblin village bandwagon! Next stop: Goblin town
[deleted]
Cool, thanks Chewy.  Pretty much exactly what I was looking for.
Well, that's true. I guess I'm trying to get a general consensus of when it becomes too cheap to pass up.  I had a feeling we will get a bounce off of 6.1k, so that seems to be playing out now.  But I would've expect the bounce to be muchstrongly if it is indeed the bottom.

BTC > 50% marketcap by August imo
That's the thing: You can't watch them in isolation. All the cryptos are very closely connected, because trading between them is so easy.
ETH was dragging BTC down yesterday. I was short on ETH so i was watching both at the same time. LTC also was dumping hard and took a while to BTC drop below 6500 and speed up the drop.

My advice is don't long ETH before the support line is tested. I have it around 410$ now. Since ETH is crashing harder than BTC i expect it to reach that value when BTC is around 5k8 - 5k9

Everyone has a different view on the charts. 
I was bearish about ETH when it was still above 600. [See what i posted here](https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8p79tb/daily_discussion_thursday_june_07_2018/e0a21vp/)

If you check the comments people also disagreed with me, saying the chart looked bullish to them. I'm no TA expert and this could just have been a lucky guess but so far it's been spot on.

Both ETH and LTC broke strong long time supports in this dump, so expect some heavy resistance going past 500 on ETH and 100 on LTC. 
You have a good point bro. It has been like that for a few months - we’re at a crucial stage though and I feel that it may be different this time, and a true reversal will mean eventually pushing passed that darn 12k mark
If we go to 2k, Imma move some serious coin to Mex Okex and Finex
Target is 4200$. But this could potentially go as low as 3400$. 


yes exactly
There is a sense in which price matters for the SoV argument. If BTC does lose 95% of its value, I think most SoV arguments would be pretty meaningless. 50%, 75%, even, these can be explained by BTC's high volatility and low market cap. But another 90-95% loss would essentially be it for the SoV argument.

It's called concern trolling. I'd guess he's a pr shill though who would be paying the bill I have no clue
Halving \+ LN adoption (maybe) \+ ETFs. 

I see many reasons why we will see new all time highs in the coming years. Thats why I trade, and thats why I don't really mind how long we drop, it just gives me more time to try and build my stack.
i "like" this reply
That doesn't mean he bought at 7700.
You read the rest.. admit it!  :)    Look. as i said before, i will say it again.  Good luck.  i am not wishing for it to crash, i am just out.  The only positive thing is that i broke even.   too much time each day looking at the screen..  and it got boring.    Best of luck buddy!!
"Years away" isn't it like 18 months away?
Can't see it on the order book, must be some glitch on my part then.

Ah there it is, price must be near 5300 for it to be seen i guess. 

Carry on :)
I mean, yeah... it is. Considering the price of Bitcoin 1 year ago was less then 1/3 the price right now. But I do recognize lots of folks are here for *the mad gainz yo*
>yeah... when BTC is at $2 they'll say, zoom out man... it's still up 100&#37; from 2010!
The point is if you would have told someone 1 year ago that Bitcoin would be at 6k a year from now, they likely would have laughed at you. 

We've all lived through a ridiculous bubble that was never sustainable. I'm not sure why folks normalized bitcoin's price being 17,000 dollars in a 3 month run up. It's just ridiculous.

It’s just their bots left trading
I was. I don't know why I expected him to say anything other than he's not worried
I've been underwater on Bitcoin buys for literally a year at a time or more. By now I'm like the creature from The Shape of Water, no need for a snorkel.

What I've learned over the years is that Bitcoin will always become more expensive than it was when you bought it. Time is money, and I have plenty of time to wait for this dingus to cover.
One player. Definitely. Would bet on it.  How else do you explain massive market sells over 10-minute periods? Flash panic?  No. It's clearly one player, and he's almost out of ammo.  The guy you're responding to probably has better returns than 90 percent of the people on this sub.  I follow him. He's right a lot more often than he's wrong.
Is that supposed to hurt my feelings or something? 
Cool cliche, no coiner.
Everyone knows what everyone is doing at this point 
It's what i BELIEVE and it lines up with the fact we didnt see any kind of bounce since we dropped from 7,8k.

The only potential to the upside are the increasing shorts who may get rekt once again. 
Yeah I probably called it too early, really need to get over ~6430 at minimum before you can consider this a local bottom.
>Guys \- if bitcoin goes to 0, do I make infinity if I short it?

:D
You make infinity bitcoin :D

It's not a prediction for him, Its history. I'm just not sure when he has come back now. If he had come back in time to us in say late November it would of been much more useful.

The best time to buy Bitcoin was three years ago. The third best time is right now. The second best time is tomorrow.
Possibly, but if I didn't already have a bunch of Bitcoin, I'd be buying now so as to not miss out just in case.  It's very plain to see that the dumpers are pretty desperate.  If they weren't, they wouldn't have started this round with a sucker punch on a low volume Sunday (it shows that they are just trying to drive the price down, not get the best price for coins that they actually want to sell).  They'll be out of coins by Friday.
The correction will be in the upward direction, and the only ones capitulating will be the bears.  Bulls "capitulate" by walking away from it for a year, not by selling our coins.

Can you guys not see that this is artificial? Who market dumps into low volume?  There's no other reason to do that than to artificially suppress the price.  The market is still bullish.  The price can be temporarily manipulated as it has been for the past six months.
I understand this of course. It is still interesting though.

As I said, I'm out of position. Up on my cold storage and down on my trading stack (that I really only use to increase my BTC holdings for the most part). I took sizable profits in December and January though.

At this point I'm watching for the reversal. When? Who knows, but I don't think I'm alone in this sub in thinking that I don't see any real signs right now of a possible BTC death. At least we're finally seeing movement instead of a slow bleed.

Maybe this will also help shake off some of the alt dander and increase BTC dominance.

Yeah, I lost on that one, but not much.  Would have come out ahead on it if I had held on to it until, say, Friday.  Will make more taking that loss and longing from 6400.

This dump has been weak, and they'll run out of coins in a couple days.
Haha auch 
We will smash through $10K again, and next time, we will leave it in the dust forever. 

Some of us are thinking beyond a week because time has taught us many lessons, among them that Bitcoin is super tough over the long haul. It's actually quite funny to hear people talking about $4k being Goblin Town if you've been in this for over a year.
Bitcoin would survive an asteroid. Who needs life when you have bitcoin 
Yes, totally the same thing.

Forget about trading the bear - just order some drugs, sell them and buy more corn. 
It seems lately that that's what happens actually. $7.3k to $9k a while backed looked like it was gonna tank. But it shot up to $7.8k in 30 minutes and then crawled up to $9k in a few days. 

Buyers n sellers just kinda appear out of nowhere.

Thank god you're here.
Oh absolutely. Volume has always been one of the best indicators and as of right now, it’s just not there...and hasn’t been in quite a while haha As we know though, with such low volume that all it takes is one big market order which is why I’m waiting for a clear break. It’ll be violent and once people realize no BGD is coming then I’ll be waving to you as we, and everyone else, all enters goblin town

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/13/technology/bitcoin-price-manipulation.html

It is based on a 66 pages long paper by a finance professor at the University of Texas. You can download the PDF of the paper via link on the NYT website. I started reading it, it seems very well researched, but I didn't have the time to read all of it today. If you're bullish, I think there is a chance it won't sit well with you during these hard times. 

> Because anyone that has been in the space for awhile is not at all surprised by market manipulation.

Well over 75% people who posted in here last year denied there was any manipulation similar to this.

Some of the more thickheaded ones are finally accepting the obvious reality, but some are still in denial about it.
erm...I would give a shit 
> There is never something like 100% sure

There is to many people here, which is why they lose so much of their money unless they just hold and pray (in which case they still lose their money this year).
I have that we just wicked it an are basically right on the line now at 6320.
take the lower yellow line and the upper blue line... than you have it
Try ProtonVPN. Or rent own VPS and install OpenVPN on it. This way also you end up with a dedicated private IP which never changes (e.g. Gdax won't bitch about device confirmations). NordVPN is generally considered shady due to their 3-day trials which get abused. If you need help, feel free to direct message me. I'm a Unix guy.
Well obviously the best VPNs require you to pay for them. I've heard NordVPN was good, but I haven't tried it. I decided to take the risk and use a free VPN, called Betternet, which is a chrome extension. It did its job well and then I uninstalled it. 
I use black VPN and I like it
You just report it normally. I think it's a misconception that it's the US government that blocks US citizens from using BitMEX. It's BitMEX themselves that stop US citizens. It has to do with some certain regulations or whatever and BitMEX just doesn't want to deal with it. 


Trust me, if the US government was really determined to stop it's people from using BitMEX, a simple VPN wouldn't be able to overcome that.
If no one would sell we would all be millionaires!
Yup, a Spring is not mandatory.
We made a new low on the line chart, which is traditionally what is used for wyckoff (no wicks).

Here is my assessment: https://i.imgur.com/mGYH6Az.png  This uses a line chart so you can see the new low.

I definitely agree with /u/cryptosecrecy that this is phase B until proven otherwise.  What we want to see is a bounce here without major red volume.  Then we can long support and risk off a lower low.  Right now we've made lower lows without a large amount of volume, which is good sign.  But theres no bounce.  For all we know, tomorrow could be a high volume bear day.
I think the trick is to find good supportive methods to be able to actually tell when the Phase B ends. I've been working with Volume, EMA-12 15m/1h/1d, RSI and now following /u/arsonbunny watching Trader and Book Counters at tensorcharts.com on Bitfinex.
You're talking about the bears, I assume?
It also fits the beginning of every major bubble pop in all of history. 

Go overlay the Wyckoff accumulation chart on early to mid 2014, just make sure the lines turn up at the end instead of down. 

unfortunately, this is one of those things like "higher lows" that will work until it doesn't 
Many thanks. Reproduced your model. That's a great hint.
So you're saying with no buyers it will settle at around 0.2?
Go to Bitmex, short with maximum leverage, then come back here and tell us BTC will go to at least 3k and insult anyone who hints otherwise.  If they don't listen, just keep lowering the numbers.  Talk about how long it took to recover after Mt. Gox, predict a bear market of at least 3 years, any less and your short is at great risk on Bitmex!  Downvote anyone that disagrees with you and you are there, you are no longer a noob!  If you really care, make or buy multiple burner accounts to really get those downvotes going.
Can confirm. I hate exams much more than looking for a job, mostly because you get more than one chance when looking for a job. With an exam, you ether pass or fail and depending on the professor, it can range from easy to very difficult.
Agree completely. I made the switch to only crypto as I wasn't able to find a job here in the Denver market. It is stressful and it is even worse because the market never closes like traditional markets. I'm pretty much on the clock 24/7.
Smart man. Always diversify.

>  People who are selling when daily RSI is sub 30 usually don't win, so taking advantage of that.

Fact. 

I'm still waiting to buy this but getting an itchy finger. I've been here multiple times before... Sucks if you miss the bottom. 
> one of those things that will look true until it isn't.

like the comparison to 2014? :p
IMO (I'm not that well versed but understand the basic principles) it makes sense because big players need volume so it makes sense that they make moves based on market sentiment data like shorts/longs, liquidity and other things that can help them gauge market sentiment. I think it's one of those things that works better when the market cap is low enough and the player is large enough to push it in a direction against the trend temporarily which is perfectly plausible in BTC. Last time we were here it played out perfectly(and I got burned), not so sure it will a second time because we haven't got the short fuel needed imo in proportion to longs open that are  in danger and the majority of shorts being in profit with a possible capitulation event near I think it would be a hard, risky squeeze in an asset that is fairly dangerous to short at the best of times. 

We could see a capitulation candle this weekly or the next down to 4Ks which would be about 35&#37; from here which wouldn't be unheard of for BTC to correct 60&#37; during those (10K\>4K and it still may not be the bottom but it could be a few weeks of upward movement to maybe 7\-7.5ish would be my guess, 8.2 HVN on the volume profile I would probably turn cautiously bullish if we get past that but I'm expecting a new low of 5K or less before then. I'll probably look for a TD trade w/ divergence that possibly aligns with my targets and hopefully leads into a potential longer TF bullish Ichimoku trade if I'm lucky(the weekly ichi TF isn't going to produce a bullish case for a while by the looks of it) but I may just keep this position open and add on bounces above 7K with profits from mex and just leverage up my mex trades to make me essentially 1x long again when I feel it's time but the uptrend is not yet confirmed. 

A close where we are now is the lowest close we've had in 7 months which I'm not sure anyone in their right mind would really consider bullish but it does lend itself to the possibility of wyckoff especially if we don't close lower(or too much lower) than 6K. I think 6K breaks and shorts really pile on which could give the right incentive to accumulate here(since plenty of selling is happening and we've propped a fair bit) if you think you can push the price up 15\-20&#37; by closing positions and a few strategic buys to let the market do it's thing. 

I think 6K breaks it could quite easily turn real nasty quickly so if wyckoff theory turns out to be correct in this instance they must have balls of steel and deserve whatever markup they can get, a BGD large enough to trigger TPs on shorts needs to be triggered which may actually be fairly easy if there are many that are 10\-30&#37; 3x leveraged in the money and expect a bounce soon(I expect opinion to be too split on this for wyckoff to be viable but I was wrong as fuck last time and a 10&#37; 5 minute green candle changes minds quickly). The psychological scarring of the last BGD  to the bears adds to the probability of closes of shorts but a lot of the shorts that could actually be squeezed would be a push to liquidate since high leverage isn't available to spot. If it does happen again though my outlook will probably become even more bearish if it drags out like the last one as less shorts when your going down is bad for price and I would expect a significantly lower highs (and after a massive bull run and a massive short squeeze the careless bears have been violated to say the least over the last 3 years whereas careless longs have been largely rewarded).

That said u/automox is a better trader than me with more experience so if he's seeing it as a possibility it really is something to consider. Although I think he generally has a bullish disposition I think he remains remarkably neutral in his TA and always provides the resources and cheat sheets to back up his TA which is always appreciated especially when your still learning. (Tagged you to say welcome back, you analysis has been missed!)
Haha all good I bet he’ll be the first to tell you he’s not an expert either. We’re all just a bunch of biased and flawed individuals trying to figure this shit out. I know I am, anyway. 
Hah you definitely know more than me on Wyckoff. And in general, but thanks :) 
Care to respond to what I wrote, not to what you think I wrote?

> That's great but BY THAT TIME you've wasted one

Letting a 10x slip through your hands and hope for another bull market which absolutely does not have to happen is not smart. Nobody knows what are the odds we get another bull.

It's just poor portfolio management even from the most basic and standard investing pov that does assume that things go up in long term. 

Examine your fucking greed.


Just keep to the rules. 1%, no lev. Give it a week or two, clear your mind, be 100% sure you can get back to trading before you'll make real trade.
it's solid stuff like that that just sometimes makes all this pain worth it.

This guys gonna have a fun summer

Probably. But at least we have exciting memories right?
> after 6 months of price decrease

We haven't made a new low. So really there hasn't been much of a price decrease. I don't know why people keep saying this. The majority of the downwards movement happened in the first two months after ATH. the rest was ranging.

Really guys, it's not crazy to think the price could go below $6k after testing it 3 times over 5 months. 

It's like a bunch of longs opening at $11k after hitting $11.7, $11k, then $10k and breaking upwards finally.

There is nothing particularly wild about it, if that happened I would really be thinking it's very possibly going to make a large move up. 
The only way you can even call the two scenarios you have provided as being the same is if, for some reason, you are able to predict accurately that the bottom is at or near 6k. 

If that's not the case, then here's the reality for you: We started out in 2017 at 750, we topped out at near 20k through several big moves. There's nothing to suggest, and in fact you haven't provided any reasons to justify, that the move from 20k to 6k is the only big move downwards this year. 
Lmao your emotions don't make it FOMO to short when it's very likely going down to goblin town.
I've said this elsewhere but you really don't know if it's random traders or whales. Given the hesitation most people here in this thread have expressed with regards to shorting $6.4-6.6k, I'd say that those 8000 btc aren't lil fishies. Someone is building a large short position imo
The so called ‘main support’ has been said so many times: 11k, 10k, 7.8, 7.2, 6.5... 5k. etc. :-)

New money just doesn’t seem to come in at these prices. At least, that’s what the market tells us? The constantly lowering price on the 6-month graphs is probably not attractive for buyers.

When looking at the (down)trend the last 6 months: why would new people/money buy at 6K if in a few weeks or months it could be back at 3K ?
Or maybe it's still not hot enough?
Alright, let's get em easy lambos then
Because he doesn’t think this is going to be the same situation as 2014
We've been in this area twice this year, what makes you think it'll break down this time instead of bouncing back up?
We're all afraid of the BGD from the last time we were in this zone
>People sell if they think the price is going down. Once everybody thinks that, my assumption is all the selling has been done already

This would have been true in a normal market, but, in crypto multiple emotions are at play which makes this statement incorrect. Reasons: 1) In crypto if the price is going down, majority think that it will come back up soon and continue to go up, 2) the rags to riches story is so compelling that everyone thinks all they need to do is hold, 3) almost all the bag holders have entered the space in previous 9 months or so and significant number of them don't have any financial markets / trading experience. 

So, while you're thinking that most of the sellers have sold their coin, I think the opposite is true as 99&#37; are hoping for a reversal \- here, at 6000, etc. you'll see real selling if we break the Feb. low.. with that said, don't know what will happen in the next 48\-72 hours, but the trend is down.
One thing you should account for is the fact that ~1800 new coins (equivalent to roughly $12m USD at current price) will still be mined every day (for the next ~2 years). If everybody is thinking it'll go down, those miners will be selling right away, which means that the demand from buyers (amount of money coming) will still need to exceed that supply in order for the price to go up.
> I'm sure no one thought 2014 would go down either. 

Peak unpopularity yet your post is at the top. Last year making a bearish post would be downvoted into oblivion. THAT is unpopularity.

When the popular conception is "bitcoin is dead" that could make a really really good bottom. 
The price will never be 0, although then again if you can't legally sell them, then what is their true value?   
It isn't bullshit...is the obvious truth.  Plus in 2014, Twitter, Facebook and Google hadn't banned all crypto ads.

I think you are splitting hairs, and I didn't intend to put any limitations on the definition of usage.

Yes, digital gold is certainly a use case, and it doesn't require the adoption of merchants, though there is other adoption in that case.

But when it was tanking or stagnant in value, that particular use case was for fools!
Newb.
Lol
I've gotten burned on that a number of times. 

Bitmex defaults to "Last," so you need to make a conscious effort to switch it to "Mark" every time. 
Oh man, I feel for you. If I had remembered to do this, I wouldn't have been knocked out of a great short at the very top of that stupid $350 1-minute wick on June futures last week. 

FWIW, I got back into a short on Monday, but rolling without a hard stop at the moment. 
:-(

I completely missed that action but glad I didn't close earlier. I probably should now
People who long the tops and short the bottom 
Sounds right to me, I don't see nearly the same fear, although it's sort of getting close. My internal sentiment indicator is pretty good. I'm seriously astonished at how accurate sentiment is at trading these swings

Considering we have gone almost straight down since $10000 I would call anything under a 15% retrace pretty weak. Second time from $11.7k to $6k we retraced $9.3k to $11.7k, $8.3k tk to $9.9k, and $7.3k to $9k.

I didn't say $6500 would be pitiful but so far *this* looks weak. As in i don't think it's the capitulation wick I'm looking for for the bottom for a month

$6500 would be a 6% bounce...really it's not that much :P 

It depends how it gets there. If it does another move that looks like $7k to $7750 again...I will probably add to my short like a degen. 
lol everything is extremely oversold. i don't have the balls to short right now but it could pay off.
Problem with going long here is that nobody knows where stops should be. I guess somewhere below 6k... And that's poor rr

Hah. Unfortunately now I'm fairly sure this is going lower. Too many longs opening. Knife catchers will just make the bottom lower, they'll provide resistance on any bounce. The bottom will be when everyone runs out of fiat for the obvious trade and panic sellers are done moving btc to exchanges. Gonna watch more carefully here but gonna put buy orders in at $4.5-5.5k
Already happened, started yesterday. I didn't make it to today's sessions. Good talks, but I don't see how it will affect the market.

However, it did raise my personal sentiment about the ecosystem as a whole. Nobody who's actually doing stuff in this space gives a shit about what traders think about price. It's easy to get wrapped up in negativity if your only source of contact with crypto people is online.
Exactly. Sounds really like "bitcoin going up when people send money to exchanges" otherwise. Yeah.
FFS, you dont know when tether is used to buy crypto. The only thing they can correlate is tether creation with bitcoin price dynamics. Cryptos were bubbling -> money flowed into tether as interest rose -> tether minted -> cryptos purchased -> Price up.


No. Fucking. Shit.
From what I can tell everyone is assuming that it does break. Meaning the "safe" obvious play is short? 
That's great.  But we are at $6550 now and the odds of a breakdown are pretty significant, and probably higher than last time.
We weren't after failed attempt to break 10k then and another lower high.

You can't look at the market by 'we were here x time ago and we bounced, so we will this time'. We bounced from 11k to 17k after drop from ATH and it didn't mean we'll never break down 11k...
that shit is controlled by the Establishment and big money players. Who have a vested interest in seeing btc fail. See where I'm going? 
All the ~~news~~ propaganda that ~~is fit to print~~ heaps of fiat can buy
Thanks! So isn't that kinda like a bull trap? I could see that injecting hopium into ever-optimistic bulls before throwing them off a cliff...

Wait for it!
Yea but all the money is in the bitcoin I'm shorting lol

on bitmex 

I probably need to rebalance my trading stack at some point 
Approx 50/50 fiat crypto. 
So you held on to a short for a month? Kudos to you. 

This isn't a bull market... yet.  The next big dump or two will undoubtedly produce little $100 red candles. Enjoy them.

The trick is to buy before the bull run starts, not after.
you guys killed the 6th. we had a good thing then you meme'd us out of millions. curse this site.


Yeah we did. But that 11k btc sell signalled the strong downtrend. We ran till 6.1k. Everything else in between was lower volume. Now that same volume was bought and it could at least  signal a reversal to test resistance till 6.8-6.9? So 6.5 short entry is risky imo. 
We got to 6900, for just a blip. 
Gotcha, good luck mate, last few weeks have been brutal for longs, can't blame you for trying to get the bottom 
If you want to catch knives and look for potential reversals at least do it right and long the bottom instead of 120 above it and hedge yourself with a short and tight stops.. We are forming the same bear flag as every other time and last dump was way too soft for this to be the end. I wouldn't call what you are doing strategy, it's more like revenge trading and gambling especially on that x25 leverage. If you get stopped out you lose about 75% of your money... I catch knives on every drop and scalp them all the time but I never take a position that's higher than my short and I close about 50% of my position in profit and let the other 50% get taken out by the market. It's not very profitable but it guarantees a good entry if it would really be a reversal. The real profits come from trading the trend. 
I try to catch reversals too...very bloody from these past few weeks trying to catch those knives.
Yes shorting is dangerous, but going long is more dangerous.  I have mostly been short this year, but longed some bounces and it backfired on me most every time. 

 The trend is down...don't fight the trend....or at least just understand you are swimming upstream to do so.  I shorted a bunch last year and usually didn't work out, so I am not one to preach.
I really don't think it's as dangerous as people think. Yet another reason why I'm not afraid of a BGD:

We had never undergone price discovery in $7k. That is why we zoomed through  it.. We just recently spent 2 weeks there. The longest unbroken period of time we've spent in any range since 2015 I think. 

there is now overhead resistance from our support line from the triangle and a range of resistances from $6.8-7.6k. 

It's not nearly as dangerous as people are making it out to be the imo. Maybe on high leverage, yes, but this is not the same market conditions as last time.. 

Last time I was telling people it was dangerous to short under $7k. This time I don't feel that way 
If you take a look at the past few weeks it's fairly clear that it is down  🤨
I have crapped out so many times with investing/trading in my life, but it beats working for a living, so I will always keep trying.  Plus, there is just such opportunity there and I know I can always do better in the future (even if I don't).
I hear this word "confirmed" used around here a lot. I think it makes people feel safer in their beliefs. Nothing is ever confirmed until it HAPPENS. A lot of things were "confirmed" right before that BGD hit in April. Then they suddenly weren't, and people were complaining about being out of position.

Any trade is a gamble. Limit your losses, stay smart. If you make a mistake, take a break, smell the roses outside.

All the best.
To me that was at 11.7 double tops even if it was technically premature
https://www.tradingview.com/x/si8CLxvk/

it changes slightly but it's still between 6 and 6.1k!
Ah, okay. This is what I have - [chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/KMvnqA7a/).  I think you are more experienced than me though, so I think yours should be right.  Plus, mine is charted for Binance. 
I don't think shorts care about fees if they're exorbitantly in profit. I know  I don't 
Your posts have been overwhelmingly towards price heading up. If anyone followed your advice they'd probably be liquidated by now.

Perhaps you're more proud of being a mod than a trader. Who doesn't want to be mod of a bitcoin that's going to $1m rather than $1k? Maybe you've let that bias subconsciously taint your analysis and view of the corn.
Nah, we'll leave it at im stupid.
Mex shows only 4 digits after leading 0, of you buy 10 contracts then you won't even see profit.
What maybe also was the problem (also happened to me in the beginning): he was on high leverage but forget to adjust the contract size. Gives you a good looking ROE, but very negliable actual profit. 
I'm assuming you're trading the XBTUSD contract? If this is the case, its important to keep in mind that your order will be a position size denominated by the XBTUSD contracts, which are equivalent to $1 of value. If you're leveraging 50x, then a position size of 72 contracts will cost you .0002 to place. 20% ROE isn't going to move the meter much at all.
Your contract size is too small to be noticeable.  Use the calculator near the top left of the page to calculate your contract size and ROE. Also 50x is way too high for leverage, most people keep it around 5x.  Finally, shorting when the daily rsi is oversold is not exactly a pro trading move, be careful and expect to lose shirt when leverage trading (most do).

I think the fastest way is to go to their reddit and either call their hotline or message one of their mods, whoever was here most recently. You will wait for a support reply for days, likely.
I'm more like *whatever* bullish.
Most will just trust coinbase enough to keep it on there. Even if they want to be extra secure they’ll just buy a hardware wallet. Which comes with simple instructions.
Or they simply keep it on coinbase. A lot of newbies do that untill they do some more research and decide to invest in a hardware wallet. 
Great r/r, easy to cut bait if it drops below 6.3
Hope you bailed.
The early adopters are no longer genius.. we got lucky with crypto and maybe even a con artist.

I used to shill bitcoin and get ignored and now my friends are into it and i'm telling them to get out but they're ignoring me again.  When it all crashes I'll be blamed and my name will be mud.

It's like when charlie lee publicly dumped litecoin, abandoned the project, and screamed it's way overvalued on national TV.  All the followers just kept buying..  It's like a trance.  And in 1 year they will all sue him, claiming they were conned. 

 


There's one indicator that I'm afraid of. 'this won't go any lower, time to buy'. We're bleeding slowly, doesn't mean won't reverse hard.
We had the cross of death... actually I think you pointed out the double cross of death. Fun times ahead.
However, in this case, most everyone has heard of it and everyone will see it as a scam, when in 2014/2015, that was still a small minority of the general population.

There's no recovering from this...not to $20K at least.  

And of course if there is global economic fiat collapse, then anything is possible, but the world will be such a mess then, that will be a Pyrrhic victory.   BTC can go up to $25K, but USD hyperinflation will mean you can buy a roll of toilet paper with that amount.
I don't know if we'll go sub 5.8k, that's why my target is a wide area: 5.9 to 5.8K. Depending on if I can baby sit it I might set more conservative profit stops and try to catch a wick. I think the log ATH trend line is the place for a bounce right now. So I'm getting out around there. Or you know, this bounces before that and I get stopped out at break even.
AFAIR the feeling of panic was much stronger than it is now. I mean, that was actual panic. 
Could have been just a stop hunt for longs and to trap some shorts.

The fight for 6300 is on
> Will lose at most 0.5%.

kraken only has stop-market sell, so it can drop fast very hard (imagine kraken is laggin +200 USD behind all other exchanges, you are sleeping, wall gets eaten, insta-drops 200 USD, you sell the 3% lower bottom at 5x leverage).

I wouldn't risk it via stop-losses, handling situation manually is probably more advised (you can try to eat/sell-into last piece of the wall)
My problem is two folds. I caught the knife in Dec 2013 and waited over 2 years to be back in the green. I DCA'd all the way down to $500 until I realized it was futile. Most recently, after sitting on my hands for weeks patiently, I thought I bought the breakout at 7600 with 60% of my fiat thinking I've wised up by not going all in only to see it all collapse a few days later. Yeah so I'm shell shocked but not selling until I am back in the green. I mean it's mostly profits I am investing with but I don't want to get reckless. The bottom does not feel near yet that is why my 40% still awaits to be put in. If this skyrockets past 7600 it will take every bit to not sell at break even and preserve my profit. BTW I don't do any leveraged trading.
It is but I think he means like trading a parabola going long is dangerous after a certain period (especially with leverage). I was not using any sort of leverage beyond 2x in that final stage of the bullrun because it would take basically tiny amounts of BTC to sell it down and the momentum was up so quickly because everyone was pulling their sells and market buying because they could no longer get fills. Weirdly enough I was more comfortable in a short in that last 6k and struggled to trust the 50D MA which was perfect for entries but we broke below on every other correction.

Not sure if this guys system is any good(in that link) but if you check out the YT channel hyperwave it's actually a pretty interesting system that has performed well historically in bitcoin and other assets from what I can gather. I know there's so many different systems but this guy has been working on them for 40 years so he seems to know his stuff.
"I've been pretty bearish since we had that 4K 4 hour candle on the way up warning people that it's going to correct and of course was told that I was stupid when I said 12K was my target"

What is hilarious is how quickly sentiment around here changes, we've crashed significantly, then gone up a few % and all is good in the world again, $12k here we come LOL
Yeah lmao. As I've said once before, the only thing more volatile than Bitcoin is this sub's sentiment. And I wouldn't really think too much about the guys calling you dumb for saying that 12k was your target. I have a feeling most of those people are gone now. 
the reverse could be true as well. If I was a whale i would liquidate all the new shorters with a pump, then catch all the fomo'ers that think the bottom is in. Expect this, it will happen several times on the way down, up, and side ways until volume returns. We'll basically be in market fuckery for the next couple of months. Only the ETF and maybe the SEC can save us.
Edit: word
debatable IMO, shows that shorts are ready to close and will likely be providing additional support soon as we get closer to 6k
Yes, but I mainly just mean the latter part. Bitcoin isn't an underground libertarian secrecy anymore- it's extremely well known- a household name. My mom has even heard of it although she doesn't understand it. 

When the majority of people believe it's a scam/ponzi scheme, I don't think that's a good thing. I would much rather people actually believe irs a legitimate financial asset 
I'm genuinely starting to look into trading stocks, seems like more fun. The volatility here is gone anyway 

r/wsb looks like a fun degenerate community lol 
Well this isn't necessarily a reflection of my sentiment- it's just the truth that it's not a good thing that bitcoin being seen as a scam still. 

At some point bitcoin has to cross over into "legitimate financial asset" rather than "fun ponzi beanie baby token." 

There are a select few who take it seriously but I don't think it's bullish for it to be scoffed at this late in its existence.

To answer your question though, when we see widespread adoption and a genuine demand for its usage that's not related to trading and/or pure speculation. 
:P
Tell that to my dog, he has been on dry food lately and they're all over the garden.
I would say you are exactly correct. The dumps have been getting softer and softer. Were you implying that someone is going to dump like that again? Fine.  You got Bitcoin down to 5.5k. Yay you. Bitcoin ded, right?
I will just look at the number. Here we all can see volume is decreasing for each bottom, so it means seller has less supply comparing with the last 2 bottom. It means we MAY bounce soon, but who knows. BTW I set my buy limit at 6050, take profit at 8450 if possible. 
Just an exchange with API problems, nothing more. Will fix it tomorrow 
> 
> But tbh it's not looking good if you want go long.

Dat daily RSI is saying buy to me, but I'm waiting for a proper blood on the streets bottom. ETA 24-48 hours. 
I think over time your "gut" turns into being able to read the market based on order flow and shit. But I don't know. 

It's not crazy to think dozens of hours spent staring at charts and order histories might help you get better at it

Anyway, so much for higher lows. Guess we got 1 more to take out...
is it the all\-seeing rising wedge though?
I think the majority knew what I meant mate. Stating 0 is obvious.
That's funny. Could be two months from now.
Just an exchange having API problems, i'll fix it tomorrow 
I had layered adds in. One hit at 6350, but I pulled the rest for now. I might just exit here, but haven't decided yet. 
If it hits $3500 I'll sell my lambo at a loss and buy back in to try and get 2 lambos next time around. 
I'm shorting 1x by being in fiat since ~$17 or 18k.  I'm not confident enough to margin short against it.  This is my first full market cycle, only got into btc last year.
Calling $1.2k when price was at ~$18k is a big deal, and I'll probably gloat at least a lil.  Never said I was mature.
Yup, it's not a bunch of house moms at this point, it's smart whales scaling their money back in at whatever price panic sellers are willing to go down to.
False
> For every seller there is a buyer....

....at a lower and lower price.
I want crypto as much as the next dude but people love money 
Smart money sold above $15K and shorted.
Will look into it. Thanks.
Can someone explain shorting please?
Perfect time to put a buy order and let retail fill it

I only lost 1 BTC 😂

But yeah, maybe not good to revenge trade as I’m thinking about doubling the pos

>ADL was an initial reason for me to stop using Bitmex some time ago (got ADL with ETF denial on like a 5-10% drop), but these days it barely happens AFAIK.

I have very large hedge for my cold storage. Usually try to keep it in the red so as to avoid ADL... Lost $50k+ while I slept due to this a couple of months ago. Hoping tonight isn't a repeat performance. 
Insurance fund if he runs out of money. Chad doesn't run out of money though, you may be thinking of Melvin the Bottom Shorter

If the insurance fund is empty then people get auto deleveraged, which means bitmex would reduce your position size due to a lack of available funds to pay you. This is fair because you're borrowing money from them and they're basically saying sorry, you can't borrow right now because the other guys who borrowed borrowed too much and lost it all like a bunch of fuckin idiots

afaik this is how it works I believe
>What if there is no Chad or he runs out of money?

Bob takes over. If everyone runs out of money, they have an insurance fund. 
Haha Chad that gave me a giggle
Haha, thanks.
Solar, wind, river?
Fixed price for rent, if I use zero I pay the same amount as when I use alot on feks mining thus free ish electricity
Yea? Ok then post that in this thread and see what happens 
Comment below yours is bullish and long and upvoted. You were downvoted for being a goob 
Every post saying it's going lower gets instant upvotes.
I know, but so far from the initial 2500, only 700 were bought the last time. And that time everyone thought it was just another spoof wall and weren't worried. 

The high number of shorts might have helped that time so it could bounce with enough strength that it wasn't tested again. Let's see what happens this time (if we get there again)
That’s true, but selling 1700 BTC at $6,000 is very different than selling 1700 BTC at $8,000 for example. Maybe a good idea to take into consideration the $ value of the dumps not just the BTC quantity. 

I’m loving your contributions recently btw man, thanks. 
I have so much trust on it that my stop loss for a long @5251€ is 5249

:) 
> Closing your longs there would have burned you.

No, because some people are DAYTRADERS and understand how to close a long and reopen another long if the market moves in that direction.  There were plenty of times in 2017 to short profitably.


> If it falls through where do you short/sell then? 

Somewhere higher on a real bounce, or when the support actually does break through? It's really not a bad thing to be out of position instead of trying and grasping for an entry when there really isn't a clear signal either way. 

I mean, shorting somewhere in 6ks isn't crazy. Shorting in 6ks a couple percent from the lowest point we've been at in the last 4 months while pretty much every indicator is oversold and starting to curl up is. 
Ah.  Yes, solid point then.  :D
Also good to keep an eye on the eth longs/shorts ratio. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/zUylEd3z/

Currently, quite a few more shorts open. I don't think it can drop down very aggresively. 
Would you do it again? I mean I get the risk/reward tolerance for everybody is different. But if you keep getting burned then might be time to rethink your strategy, no?
It's very likely a good thing for BTC long term. Short to medium term could drag btc down quite a bit since lots of its value is inherently in alts
We could also break down and make a slightly lower low than 6k (like 5.4 or 5.7) and reverse from there. There are no absolutes, breaking 6500 or 6000 does not automatically mean we are going to 3 or 4. Actually, some of the strongest horizontal support we have is around 5500. Personally, I believe this chart will prove accurate: [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/tlo0V1AE-BTC-Capitulation-still-ahead-potential-reversal-soon/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/tlo0V1AE-BTC-Capitulation-still-ahead-potential-reversal-soon/)
Alright, keep faith and have fun watching coming 18 hours
Down? Just type in testnet bitmex on Google. Idk the exact link.

Gotcha. Was just teasing. 
On Bitstamp it didn't. Already "bounced" from it
Psychology is only part of it. Some of these low prices start calling into question Network strength and the mining
Despite the major corrections from $1,160 to $160 and from $20,000 to $6,000, the bitcoin market has actually skewed bullish since 2012 when it was still valued at around $25. And arguably longer than that.

The lower boundary of the ascending channel has been respected as support since 2014. Once the market stops respecting it, there's a strong possibility that the market will enter into a true, extended bear market. Think years of steady decline punctuated by prolonged periods of sideways stagnation, instead of the typical weeks to months the market has become accustomed to.

So realistically, things start to look quite bleak long before $1,160 falls. $2,500 or below in the immediate future is problematic, as it would mean the market has decided that bitcoin is overvalued and it's time to re-explore lower price points.
Yeah, I know. And another leg down on BTC will almost certainly crush that support line for ETH as well.
What makes this a crucial point? 
Why? We're going to 1m/BTC, don't you see the signals?

713 days right now
Around that timeframe, not sure mate didn't check, sooner the better i guess.
No, a lot of folks are here since the bull run, 3k is disaster for them.
But it was totally normal at the time right? 50k in 2018!!
Yes, that's true and nobody cares.  When BTC is back down to $800, you could say the same thing about it getting there from $0.01 in 2009
Nobody here thinks btc won't recover, but the very least you need to be objective and know when to hodl and know when to sodl.
You two are the most permanent of permabulls and have been resoundingly wrong for months now. "The one guy" has been "almost out of ammo" for a few thousand dollars and counting now. "He" might actually "run out of ammo" at $5K or $3K and then, like a broken clock, you guys might be right for a change. But if you actually wanted to be right, you'd give up the "one guy" theory and realize this is all part of a larger market cycle driven by overall trader psychology instead of nefarious supervillain forces.
Nope, just calling it the way it is.  It didn't occur to me to care about your feelings.
Yes, I sold all my coins months ago at a higher price. U mad bro?
>Everyone knows what everyone is doing at this point

Totally. It's as if at points like this the sub fills with soothsayers and time travellers. Nobody knows what the hell is going to happen or what anyone is truly doing.
Got it! What if I just open a leveraged long at the same time? So if it goes up, I'm okay. But if it goes to 0, I make 100% of the downside to infinity, but only lose the long?


Ty
lol
Your private keys show up as asterisks, unless you own them. Mine are \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* and \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
Unless the big dump you seem to be expecting today gets bought up.
Anyone who wants to sell some coins will market sell into low volume because there is no volume to get their asks filled. Gotta get the price down to where there is enough liquidity and trading interest to exit. Price is trending down from ATHs, there's been no indication of a reversal yet. Market is breaking significant supports, has a bearish geometric structure, moving averages are becoming more bearish, and candles are closing at new lows on higher timeframes. Lot's of us saw this bear market coming, it's a natural part of the market cycle.
I'm far from knowledgeable and don't believe conspiracies.... but find it very strange that today coinbase is offering ETFs with minimum 250k investment... so this, or lower,  is much more attractive to sell as a product
I guess being a major bear since 14k and being right all this time makes me a troll.
It's so funny, it's 2018 and people still think they are visionaries and freedom fighters for buying bitcoin.
Who cares if it's a bubble? We're here to trade, if you can't trade for shit, and if you fell for the "hodl" meme, then you only have yourself to blame.
how do you know we'll be above 6730 by Friday?
Just waiting for my 401k cash out to get wired to coinbase.  The tax hit sucks, but MOON, AMIRITE!
But the panic of the price going down will convert more and more bears generating more and more coins? 
What happened to your thoughts on flying through 10k? Or did I tag the wrong user?
Well I've been in BTC for well over a year and I sure as hell wouldn't be buying now.  I've been out for a while now watching this unfold.

Why would you when in all likelihood you can buy for a lower price...instead you just keep buying lol
What's funny is how much money you keep losing
Fundusu are seyfu?
What's fear of death by an asteroid apocalypse got to do with holding bags, dude?

I'll settle for a Tesla.
That's fair, I don't disagree. I was invested prior to us meeting and slowly revealed how much I was invested after some time into our relationship. 

In fairness, the main reason for me not saying anything (unless asked) is that my SO knows their reaction is more emotional than my own, and I also don't believe we'll be sitting in a 4/5k range for too long if/when it does happen. Ultimately I can save them the angst of knowing it went down to that by saying 'Yes but now we're hopefully done with the correction' ^unless ^we ^go ^to ^zero...


Seems like you guys have a healthy relationship. :)
No worries, good to know!  I'll start using finex and I really appreciate the info!
I understand what you're saying as well, although I think the main difference is banks would use what's necessary and their processes are not inherently anti-efficient in terms of energy usage. Every sane tech gets more efficient with scale and time, but Bitcoin is hard coded to be anti-efficient, the more power you throw at it trying to win the RNG lottery, the harder it gets to do it and the more computing power gets used to make the network work just as slow as when it was on a few hobbyist pcs years ago. This is the issue that most people have.
Ah, I chart log. Doesn't quite give 3 points of contact there. A 15% range is certainly enough for log/liner to diverge. 
Anything under 6800 is mostly noise, IMO.
oh yeah that... i saw it on coindesk. I guess i'm not too surprised by the research results. Everyone last year seemed to be in agreement that tether made market frothy and likely conducted a crypto version of fractional lending. Guess its good some one did the math.

On a side note: It will be an absolute disaster if Tether collapses, like 1.3k and lower disaster.  However, the only way it falls is if Bitfinix gets raided, and i dont think thats very likely.
Do you really care if you're still trading and taking money from those in denial?
> Well over 75% people who posted in here last year denied there was any manipulation similar to this.

Fair enough then. 
Why exactly? How will that knowledge change your trades? 


Thank you very much. I am literally asking for a friend. I would never do leveraged trading. I will let you know if he has any questions. Appreciate the offer
I pay for NordVPN. I love it and use it on all my devices. 
Thank you very much!
thank you!
Only the dumb money is selling.  The smart money is scooping up all these Cheap Coinz.
Seeing this reply just now, forget my previous question.  Thanks for the input.

As a side note to both you and /u/cryptosecrecy , Wyckoff notes that often times Phase B is one of the hardest to identify until C has been made clear.  So you come into it guessing at A, being confused in B, clarify everything during C (now you know A,B,C), then have a higher % chance of playing out D and E.  E is the all in signal, if you care to wait that long and prefer a higher % success trade, or bottom of trade range during C if lucky/observant.
Tensorcharts is awesome, but I think it's only meant to be used for short term trades. The wyckoff structures are multiweek long even in crypto. The past few major structures after the 20k top have all looked like distribution, not necessarily all conforming to any particular wyckoff model but definitely distributing. Long term obv confirms that.

Edit: interesting you noted you follow the Bitfinex volume on tensor. Doesn't that exchange allow wash trading and therefore its volume data is compromised?
The bears have BTC down $14,000 in the last few months. 

 The bulls have their straws...and a $100 bounce.
People can hold gold in their hands and it settled around 0.2 before coming back.  Almost every other comment I’ve seen here over the past several weeks was critiquing the lack of volume.  The equilateral triangle breakdown on lack of volume was almost textbook based on the Investopedia and searching of triangle characteristics.

If it breaks up too early it will come back down, if it breaks up past ~75% of the length of the triangle on low volume it will probably break down.  It broke up very very late in the length on low volume and failed ( I don’t have exact length on the triangle).

The problem isn’t the leverage or tether or FUD to me, it’s the lack of people investing in the space.

To answer your question in my own novice opinion, yes...If nobody(relative term) buys the thing then the price won’t go up.
And the last step...buy your lambo with your profits.
you're bold! We're so close to following 2014's technicals that it's hard to argue it's even different anymore. A drop below $5.8k would all but confirm it
Wut.
Instructions unclear:  100%, ALL leverage.
[deleted]
What makes it even more justifiable is it's not even a new low. People are acting like we've just gone down all year. We made the majority of the downwards move in two months. The rest has been ranging/lower highs. 

It's really not particularly crazy to think the market looks ready to move down from here now. 

If the market smashed its head against $11.7k, $11k, and $10k and then broke upwards finally to $11k over 5 months I think we would all assume it's going to go up. 

I think people are just in denial about what could happen, really. 
you seem to think that i believe 5k will be 'the bottom'?  
no im simply saying its the next, strong, support. at least on paper. i think we are going lower than that, but its "the" target for a short up here
Ok good point there.
Well of course he doesn't. I'm sure no one thought 2014 would go down either. I mean 2014 was even worse, they were at $11.7k right now. Until like August

He even says it himself. It doesn't go down when everyone finally agrees it's going down. Yet he thinks it's going up so he buys...?

He's doing the same exact thing he did before which left him with heavy bags for two years. I don't really understand the strategy there
Because we've been in this area twice this year 

I mean and a dozen other reasons. but that's basically the jist of it 
I believe we're in an S-adoption curve which is starting to go parabolic. Namely, I believe average monthly demand is accelerating. $12m is peanuts.
Yes, agree. This is the biggest risk IMO.

I believe there's two approaches they can take. Hard handed, just ban it.

Or western society's favored approach: regulate the shit out of it and bring it under their control - not dissimilar to the virtual prohibition of any material amount of cash in today's society.

How do you control the world's supply of gold? When you control the subjects, just make it illegal (ie what happened domestically in the US in the 1930's). If you do not control them however, such as the case with non-citizens, you can only acquire their property by increasing the price.

I just happen to believe this second approach is already underway. I think we're going to see new ways for big money to easily buy crypto, while making it easy for the little guy to sell. Something like a bank for cryptos. Fully insured so long as they hold onto your coins. This itself will fuel a huge rally because ma and pa can get in. Which is fine because 99% of what is bought will remain under control. And the increased price will attract the wandering coins back into the sandbox.

So yes, they are going to take steps to reign in cryptos, but I believe that process will make many rich.
hahah xD
Do you use mark on swaps too? Any reason you prefer it over index?
There's not going to be as much fear as there was in February even if we go to like $5000 next week. All the crazy longs from 5 digit prices are dead by now and all the longterm "neversell" types have likely accepted that they might have to wait a while until next moon. The idea that there's a whole lot of people holding a whole lot of BTC from last spring or before, who hadn't taken sufficient profits yet, and will panic and dump everything once price moves closer to breakeven for them, is pretty ridiculous. 
I agree; I think there was more fear in February.
I know you're quite bearish, and congrats on your excellent entries for your shorts. What I would like to know is, do you have targets set in place for them - any idea where the bottom might be? Old man Brandt, for instance, called $4.135 as the target for downward break of the triangle a few days ago. Thoughts? 
There's a part of me that wants to exit all positions here and re-evaluate. 
It is. Probably premature entry.
You mean the BTC companion and the only alt that is not trying to take over BTC(aka Btrash) but instead help develop the technology and with LN atomic swaps it will get clearer 

Edit: Should be $14.4b market instead of Btrash
First time i hear the name Factom and beside the fact that it sound like rectum the first time i hear about it is from Reddit shilling. Not a good sign
Erm, how do you come to that conclusion...

That's why they're on their 3rd funding round with the DHS using them then right?
Bogs?
during the 20k bubble pop the network slowed down so much panicking whales couldn't get their money into exchanges.  I think it would have gone to 2k right there and then otherwise.

I wonder if the one big pot guy from batman has sold yet


Yes, but when you short is the question ;)
I wouldn't say shorting a local bottom without a retrace of more than 10% after a 40% dump is safe at all. 

Just because everyone expects it doesn't mean it's safe. 
Hmmm, did you copy/paste this comment from the period I mention? ;)
Yea but dont you feel like it always does the opposite of what you think is gonna happen?
This is something I said before, there's been a consistent pattern of DCB'ing out of a range really high just to fall straight back down to it. Chop around for a week or two. Then dump.

That's pretty much what just happened with $6.5-8k. 
Yep, fully aligned on that. I am just observing the same symptoms, outcome can be different.
so you are on bitmex shorting the amount of Bitcoin you have in your cold wallet or you are levereged short? :D I am just curious.
I closed and reopened it a few times, but essentially yes (there was a wedge break in the 8s that went nowhere and a little bullish engulfing candle in the 7s that I thought might push back to the top of the triangle but it went nowhere).

The next bull run? Do you mean another counter\-trend rally? Or a new bull run to ATHs? Because shifting to a bull market is not binary \- we need a capitulation dump with a super strong rebound or we need to go sideways for a long time. That ends the bear market.

>\>The trick is to buy before the bull run starts, not after.

You could've bought Bitcoin at $500 in 2014 and watched it fall another 50&#37;. Or you could've bought Bitcoin at $500 in 2016 and watch it go 40x. You can buy early in the bull market. Calling bottoms in a bear market is a fools errand.
Oh I see what you mean. 

Tbh it's no man's land. This could chop, pump, dump, etc. I really got no clue on short term movements. I'm fairly sure it will go down eventually though. Unless we get past $7.2/$7.6. Those price points will give me pause
Brutal indeed :(
Yes it is a bit of revenge trade. I missed my 6500 target entry by the time I sold on binance and transferred. But opened anyway because this is last bullish support level. 
So when people brag about shorting being easy money you think it's not scary to go short ? lol 
If you take a look at everything since December, it's clearly down
> Plus, there is just such opportunity there

This is key. The next huge opportunity will always be there in BTC, whether its a short or a long. If you feel out of tune with the market or feel like you are gambling or chasing losses, don't trade. Save your coin so that when the right trade comes you maximize your profit. Trust me, I have made the same mistakes.
>  A lot of things were "confirmed" right before that BGD hit in April

Really? Like what? Genuinely don't remember there being any significant patterns or MAs or whatever that we confirmed. It was all pretty nebulous
the day we hit $10.8k I said "the bubble popped" and people said I was just being a pussy and wasn't used to crypto lol. Which was totally true, but I mean...55% retrace in like 3 weeks was...pretty wild 
I'll assume it's acting as support until it's invalidated. Then i'll redraw like most of you guys have it.

Since my bias now is shorting, i prefer to have a higher support line to expect possible bounces and set profits / close. 

I tend to adapt the lines (within reason) to have the most contact points i can get, this is one of those cases.

Maybe that's a big no no for TA, but it's not working to badly for me.
Noob also, i just drew the support line a bit differently and we bounced from that line today.

From exchange to exchange there are differences, Bitstamp and Bitfinex seems to display better patterns. 

I chart in BitStamp and then adjust the values to Kraken when opening/closing positions. 
That's true until it's not. Shorts are paying substantially more in fees overall. That has an impact over months and years that's substantial.
I haven't been calling for the price to go up. I've been saying that I think it will go sideways the rest of the year and that the thing to do is DCA until the end of the year with small amounts of cash. One doesn't DCA with leverage.

I'm not sure why you need to make personal attacks against me and misrepresent what I've said, but it's a little creepy and annoying.

How about you go your way and I go mine?
Yeah, probably this.  Especially for high leverage.  I messed that up the first time too.
I think you are right but I don't know how to adjust the contract size. I sold a quantity of 72 at 50x leverage
Ok thank u. Are u able to tell me what I need to change to fix it...?
5250-5500. 
> You will wait for a support reply for days,

Months in my experience.  No exaggeration.
Thanks, will give it a shot! I figured going the conventional support ticket route wouldn't help much.

Edit: Update - I spoke with customer service, and they said there's no way around the automated lockout...just have to ride out the clock.  Let this be a PSA to not be an idiot like me, and make sure you click the right authentication link to authorize new devices.
We could touch the line and bounce up and then continue to go down and follow it cow  for weeks to months without ever breaking below it 
MUCH MORE. Back then there were many people, including myself, that thought Bitcoin was going to zero and become worthless. 

My concern is as I stated earlier is that last rise was a manipulated anomaly and we are going through price discovery which could land us much lower with little volatility.
Judging from the last time, the difference from kraken to other exchanges never got above 50$ if i'm not mistaken.

If it trigger my position i'll be watching the wall and can close before it's all eaten (hopefully, since it can be pulled or a massive sell order goes through the wall)

For now it actually looks like it will not get there.

Thanks for the heads up
You know you can open shorts as a hedge and make more bitcoin while the price drops right?

One million next month or I'll eat my dick
12K was my target when we were at correcting at 20K not now... I'm looking sub 4.65-5K now(and have been for months I think I've been pretty clear on that).
I didn't worry too much that I caught the majority of major correction 3x short of the bubble don't worry... I'm sure I've been called a dumb bear plenty since we hit 20K and never recovered after the subsequent bulltrap but after that parabola broke it was time to short the market the million dollar question is just when to close and reopen and when to keep the position. People like /u/fuckharvey were right and as much shit as people here give him because he's bearish I'm like 90% sure he has either some qualification in finance/econ or at least works in the industry with a sound understanding of economics so people would do well to listen to people who give reasonably bearish arguments. The majority of the BTC crowd is stuck in an echo chamber of bullishness and most have little to no understanding of actual economics despite claiming that bitcoin will 100% take over the world. It's become a little embarrassing... I don't claim to know everything but if someone is offering their expertise on the subject I'm damn sure going to take what they say seriously to at least consider the possibility that they offer something I don't know.
good point..
Me too, but that takes time. By default, people are very resistant to change and operate with a herd mentality so shouldn’t be a surprise. We’re still early adopters as weird as that sounds. 
Part of that is to keep it from goblin town and keep it from moon.  Both are a no-go for legitimate use.
Thanks. Could you further define your definition of "widespread adoption"? Also, how would one actually measure / gauge it?
We've had two bottoms, one was a hard dump with high volume over 2 days, the other was low volume over 2 weeks. The total volume for the that second bottom was actually higher than the first.
Daily RSI says that 'we had a lot of selling lately'. That's about it. If there are no buyers daily RSI in couple of days can say 'we had freaking lot of selling lately'.

Wanna gamble - go long. This probably should retest higher 6k in some time, but I won't bet on it, we just broke my 6.5 support line after couple hours of grinding over it.
> I think over time your "gut" turns into being able to read the market based on order flow and shit

Exactly. When I can see charts live I can almost always see that 'this gonna move fast within next hour' and at least 75% of the time I can 'see' the direction.

On the other hand that was $100 move. Nothing big. But if I'd want to scalp all of those moves that would be nice profits.
Have you read Trading in the Zone? Among other things it describes this feeling. Like any other discipline, you will get better at getting in the zone/in flow with the market over time, but you will always be liable to getting out of flow, just like any pro athlete still can
Yeah, was just being pedantic. :)
*Could* be today. It won't be though.
That's the way to do it.
so dont make stupid calls then please....
If you're not confident enough then you can't say I told you so.
Ya, but you also can't control the market so either play the bear market/accept it or walk away and comeback when it goes up if you're at your computer stressing about the price. 
borrow the asset, sell it, buy it back at a lower price. Give the asset back, pocket the difference. 

> know a guy who has a watch worth $5? Borrow it

> "hey other guy want this watch for $5?"

> "Sure"

>Sell it for $5

>Watches go out of style, they are now worth $1

>"Hey other guy I'll buy that watch back for $1

>"sure man fuck this thing"

>Buy back watch for $1.

>"Hey original guy, here's your watch back"

>Just made $4 by shorting a fukin watch
Lmao here we go again
just google. investopedia 
This is my thinking, create the appearance of no buying pressure to accumulate and let shorts stack up. Though I'm not convinced we'll rocket up like the OG BGD this time, as people are likely to be more cautious, the fact that we're seeing such an explosive increase in shorts seems to indicate the herd has very short memory. 
I have no words for anyone considering selling

I mean, if you’re trading, fine. But people who sell at sub 7k make very little sense to me

Of course, I say this in every single dip, and sometimes it is extremely worth selling, but I have no other way to rationalize it at this point.

I dont sell Bitcoin. Ill trade and cut losses if Imm wrong, but I wont be seling
This is like the 3rd time we hit 6k and we just made a new local low.  I would be pretty surprise if we make any significant bounce due to low confidence.
It's so poor rr right now for any position. Just let it be more clear about direction.
Well, nice long it would be, right? ;-)
ADL?
Probably water/river although Norway imports from Germany and Sweden so i guess nuclear power plant
generally there is a "no commercial use" clause for electricity on rents like this in your contract. If you landlord catches you doing it there will likely be consequences .. but I understand your logic = Most electricity goes to mining, although nobody can tell because its about the same I would use If I didn't care about it. Amirite?

Edit - I recommend you get a smart metre to know 100% if your playing it safe or not.
It's going to the moon 
That's one way to play it haha
Allrigth then. Good day
"Out of position" would be selling for most people though. 

Or short 1x. I'm not saying go degen 10x short here, just that selling here isn't particularly wild. 

People are completely baffled anyone's selling here in the same way they were baffled at every price point above here. 

If we do go below $6k, a $6.3k sell really won't look bad at all. 

And I guess. To me I just see us breaking out of our consolidation range as an indication of a trend and when BTC trends it tends to burn anyone who gets in the way. 

Selling/shorting overbought RSI at almost any point in 2017 would have gotten you burned dozens of times.

Like I said, oversold is a bit different, but like we saw in the $7ks, every single time frame could reset in a 7 day 10% move up. We could go to $6.6k and dump another 20%.

Also somewhere higher on a real bounce isn't a guaranteed thing, plus it means checking charts daily, watching for tops and then trying to time the top. 

Lots of people here would rather say fuck it, this looks awful, I'm out. Don't care if it goes a little higher

Again, I don't really want to say I'm suggesting shorting here, it's a pretty aggressive trade, I just think people are detecting that there may be a trend forming and they want out.. It's not about getting  the best price sometimes
Ltc is also dumping. I'm setting tight stops and moving them as price lowers. It's already a great trade for me, just need to lock in profits.

6500 is holding like a rock so far, but if it breaks it will be a shit show... 
I get you, I do, but I had a line. If we passed $11.7k I wasn't gonna try anymore. 

If we go below $5.5k then yea I'd say those guys should give up and start trading the trend and just short a bounce. 

But the truth is that they will eventually get a bounce. Btc won't go straight to 0. Just depends how long and if they hold on a bounce for too long 
I think you're right. However, what happens if a lot of people get the same idea around the same time to proactively "exit" from their alts into bitcoin? Obviously some of the value would be lost from the economy as a non-zero percentage would exit to fiat, but would the increase in demand for bitcoin negate the loss in inherent value due to being dragged down by alts?
That's not a good fractal. Its comparing a very volatile and bullish environment to a bleeding bear market. Doesn't make sense. A 6 month bear market is not reversed at a flip of a switch \- its not binary. It'll be a gradual shift, as we consolidat and all the moving averages flatten out instead of pointing straight down like they are now.
We're Sorry...
We are currently experiencing a server error. We have been notified.

BitMEX will be back up very shortly. Please try again soon.


didn't on finex either, probably just a premature post
You know that every time you're starting to talk about catastrophic scenarios we're actually close to reversal?
Why aren’t you shorting right now? Or protecting your cold storage by a hedge short?
The triple bottom
I mean to go long!!!!
I too don't like buying the top of a highly speculative, new asset class.
You're overthinking it. If you shorted $10000 contracts and then longed $12000, you would be net long $2000 contracts. You would benefit from increase in price.

It's that easy.
Those strings are way too short. You're trying to trick us! :P
lol 
Yea it's just a little goofy...what's interesting is in 2014 shorting was extremely popular actually. Lots of people discussing short squeezes and stuff (right before the price tanked of course) but there was no animosity towards those who did it. 

At least not from what I saw. It seems that there's a new wave of btc people from 2017 who are more emotional about it.

It seems like it's becoming a bit of a trigger word for people 
For me, it was true financial freedom
Obviously I don't know that, but what I see is someone dumping a lot of coins to very little effect.  I have seen this before.  We saw it in April, just before the BGD at right about this price level.  The way they started the dump on a Sunday just stinks of desperation to me.  I think they run out of coins tomorrow after a few more tantrums, then we go up.  If they have to cover some borrowed coins, we go up hard.

I will be entering a long at 6400 if we go there, which I'm pretty sure we will.
That people actually did this makes me very sad.
Nope you have the right guy pegged. Just ignore him, by far the worse trade advice on this sub
What makes you think we won't fly through 10K?  We've done it before. We'll do it again.  This time last year we were in "goblin town" according to some of you guys because 2K is goblin town now, I guess.
We will fly through 10K. Zoom out. If you don't have any BTC, now is a great time to get some. Thank me in six months (or sooner).
Yup. I've been buying since 2014. Never once regretted buying over time. Have regretted selling a couple of times. It has a funny way of running up just when you start waiting for the dip.
There is no divergence on the weekly 
Divergence is divergence, you need to compare local lows to each other for bull divergence and it's very much undecided if we've made any kind of local low on that time scale. Want to talk shorter time scales I think you have an argument just really disagree with the weekly.
What if it really goes down? Basically losing all your investment?

Mine knew where are my stop loses and agreed that everything beyond that is my call. I've cashed enough that I can basically lose the rest that is invested and we both don't have problem with that.

Those posts here suggest 'I've took our savings without asking and are afraid to say how much I've lost'.
You always chart log, even on shorter term patterns? The falling wedge I have drawn is only three days old. Do you think log is the way to go here? I'm asking because of the difference in the breakout point.
I think the 6.5 break was important, yesterday we just wicked below, now we're holding it. Shorts taking profit and price doesn't change much.
Yes I do care a little...I care when a gnat is buzzing around my face too.  It is irritating and annoying.
It depends to the extent which it was manipulated.

I would rather not hold an asset that's largely propped up by malicious actors looking to get exorbitantly rich. 

Don't really care if it keeps going up- there are plenty of ways for me to make money without holding an asset that has fake value. 
Yes, exactly.  Just like in 2014-2015.  Only difference is the size of the bearwhale (this one is bigger but he doesn't have 400,000 coins to sell, just lots of dollars to waste which totally warms my heart).
I actually switched from Gdax some time ago. Bitfinex seems to lead the situation, i.e. be relatively reflective of what is going on in general and is closer to the actual market situation, i.e. to sketch the general pattern. Gdax had these weird "overheads" at times, and much lower volume. 
definitely. It's going to hurt a lot of people that's for sure. 

However some of the tripe on /r/ripple is hysterical. They essentially blame all of the Ripple downturn on Bitcoin. Let's see where they end up in a year and how many of them still hold the wonderful Cripple
Didn't mean it that way. It's more like I just don't think a real 'main support' exists in the market when looking at the last 6 months.
When you get burned, your nerves actually die so quickly that shortly after, you can't feel the pain. 

It takes several hours for your nerves to begin to grow back before you can feel the pain because you literally have no nerves to feel it. 

This happened to me when I got burned with an iron once. It's really odd having it hurt a lot for 10 seconds, having it not hurt for an hour, then having it come back with a vengeance 2 hours later. 
I actually believe it is more likely to go down than go up short term. 5k likely. 3k probable.

However I follow Jeff Bezo's regret minimization principle. I won't regret losing what I've invested if it goes to 0. But I would regret if it took off tomorrow because I believe we are staring a once in a century opportunity in the face, playing chicken with each other trying to get cheaper coins.

For traders its valid. For me I am going balls deep regardless of short term technical factors.

The part that you don't touch on is that I don't regret my decision in 2014. It could not have been any other way. I'm either in or out. 
I don't generally trade swaps, but I'd use it there as well.

I prefer mark over index because liquidation is based on mark price. 

If the premium suddenly jumps from 0% to 3% in the span of a few hours (which it has before), I want to exit based on Mark price rather than index price to avoid liquidation. 

For example, let's say you were 10x short from $6,300 with a liquidation price of around $6,900. 

When you entered, mark and index were both at $6,300. 

Index drops to $6,000 and then pumps to $6,700. While mark drops to $6,000 and then pumps to $6,900. 

If you based your stops on index, you'd be liquidated. If you based your stops on mark, you'd be saved from liquidation. 
Well I mean we're all guessing. That WolfofBinance guy said he's cashing out on the next bounce and he is my ideal candidate for 2017 crypto investors who got rich and haven't realized much profits.


I don't think people need to be scared so much as they just need to be exhausted now. Of course not everyone will cash out and lots will hold because they know they've seen the brunt of it. But some people are holding onto so much money and they see $3-5k as inevitable so they will cash out  

This is all pure speculation of course. 
It's an unfortunate circumstance. The more "okay" people are with the price the more it seems to gravitate downwards. Fear is a huge springboard for this market, just like greed is in the opposite direction.

people becoming complacent with low $6k is bearish not bullish
Anything below $5k will very likely be in profit at some point after, even if we do go to $3k eventually  

My targets are $4.5-5.5k depending on how we get there. The faster we get there without retracing, the higher the target, generally.

thanks by the way :) 
Didn't mean to scare you. This could go two ways: shitty bounce and chop to $6.6-6.8k then dump to new lows.

or hover around here for a few hours-a day or so before miraculously bouncing to $6.9k in 1 hour. then slow climb to anywhere from $7.2-7.8 and everyone thinks bull market is on. Double bottom memes abound.

Then we tank even lower than we would've in the first situation 

In other words, this will either slow crawl up or pop the fuck up in 1-2 hours. In a slow crawl case, shorting seems good. Pop up means you could probably get a better entry.

My point either way is your short is very aggressive. It could totally work but if it doesn't, there's a chance you will get stopped out right at the top. 
Explain to me why you’ll need ltc if BTC has lightning
From the documentation:
>The policy and reward mechanism in Factom is similar to Proof of Stake (PoS). Factom differs from most PoS systems in that only a subset of users' stake is recognized. Only value which has been committed to the system has a voting share. The transferable Factoid value does not have a voting share.

Proof of stake means it is necessarily a trusted centralized system.
You need a quick rundown?
A couple of days ago 
Not at all.  I am usually right (well over 50.0% of the time), even though I still manage to lose money.
Yup.

But it'll end some day. I said that this is scrape time. I don't play too much with it but this is really the time when you should just open 100 positions and close them with small wins if you want to trade.
>DCB'ing

Serious question: How many time can a dead cat bounce?
I actually don't have cold storage. All the bitcoin I own is on bitmex. It used to not be a lot but now it's more bitcoin than I ever had by like 2x 

Most if it is unrealized profits so maybe I should shut up before declaring  it mine :) 
Yeah eventually breaking 6k looks more likely. Maybe a final bull trap to 7k+ 
Stay solvent and don't get liquidated. The bounce will come.. Make sure you have money for it  

Best of luck, really, even though I'm betting against you I wouldn't mind holding through a pump so you could score a win 😜
Who is bragging about shorting being easy money? I really don't see many people here shorting. I would actually say it's been somewhat difficult and uncomfortable to short since below $7.8k. 

Also, I would much rather go with the trend once it presents itself. For now, the market is showing with the relatively high volume breakdown of our tightening range that it is likely going to be a downwards trend. 

Everyone keeps saying "it's already gone down so far!" but...we've been here 2 times already. It hasn't gone down farther in *five months*. Is 5 months really that fast to make a new low?

If we were banging on the upside of the triangle three times, wouldn't you want to long if we broke upwards out of the triangle above $10k and were hanging around $11k?
Actually longing from Feb to May was pretty smart. You could've made basically just as much money as a short could've. We were ranging that entire time 

Now? I think it's a little different. But I understand that I could be wrong 
Perhaps I'm wrong. I recall the big run down from 11k -> 6.5k as being pretty steep, and then suddenly the BGD hit.

My main concern is for people that trade with 25X leverage using their last reserves. It's dangerous and no TA can predict bitcoin, as much as people wish it would.
Looks so obvious in hindsight now, great call. So many crypto investors are in their first rodeo, myself included, and you don't get educated investing at the beginning of a massive bull run, you just get hubris.
Oh I though you meant on the scale of days to weeks. My bad 
Not making attacks of any kind, just pointing out your analysis didn't make sense. 
You have to multiply 72 by the leverage you want so 72 * 50. 
Increase your position size. The 'Quantity' field is where you'll enter that how big of an order you want to place. Think of it this way... Your Quantity (in the case of the Bitcoin swap and futures contracts) is like buying x amount of USD worth of Bitcoin. If you've bought 10000 XBTUSD contracts at $6250, that's kinda like getting into a long on Bitcoin at $6250 with $10000.

I highly suggest playing with it on testnet until you understand it thoroughly, in case you aren't already.
More leverage = smaller position to fix it you should've opened like 7400 contracts. Change your settings to satoshis(top right) and you'll see a slightly different number. Also 50x is not to be used lightly highly recommend sticking to 10x and less until you understand the platform. 
Yeah that’s something chewtoy brought up. Hopefully there is a bounce and make another nice entry. 
I don't think so. A single whale with 1000 coins can turn the tide, as it were happening during the 'barting period'. I don't expect any 'escape' from the volatility any time soon. I mean, just a moment ago we were creeping up on 7800 already drooling at at least mid 8000s.

But if we do, stable price and limited volatility leads to more adoption (which in the first place volatility prevents), institutional acceptance and in the long term higher price, e.g. ETF getting approved.

I don't want to sound naively bullshit, but there's no bad option here. The question is only about the timeframe and if it works for you.
Yes I am aware but shorting and doing leveraged trades is not something I want to get involved in.
Yes that is why I am not good at crypto but I've been lucky ;)
Trying to learn from past mistakes and get better.
I only took microecon 101. I have no finance or econ background and I'm about as much in the finance industry as Kanye is in Washington politics.
Seeing it picked up and used by a major company would be a big green flag for me :) 

Unfortunately it seems lately it's mainly dropped by merchants. 

Or a bitcoin ETF. 
I think the low volume over 2 weeks can be called as consolidating period. I do not think we count the active selling volume like that.
It's been working pretty well for me the past 5 years. I'd recommend looking at it more closely. Daily RSI below 29 always signals a local market bottom. Feel free to point out when it hasn't... 

>Daily RSI says that 'we had a lot of selling lately'. 

Well yeah... It shows when it's oversold. 
Yea, I really do feel like I can sense when a big push or dump is coming. Hard to act on it though. Confirmation bias until I put it to the test though :P
:)
As a matter of probability, that's the least likely.
You call it stupid, I call it lucrative. Loving days like today.
Disagree, I am shorting it.  Just not with a multiple.
Isn't it pretty clear that the direction is down?
would have been pretty shitty eh ;)
Right, Already got a Amp/Volt meter for checking how much power it uses. But it shouldt be a problem unless I draw more than the max safe thoughput of the cables so they get hot and maybe catch fire. 
As it happens, the moon is on the opposite side of the Earth right now, so it has to go down to get there.
Order is set, now i just have to make sure the wall is still there if the price gets there 
>I'm not saying go degen 10x short here

Woah I’m triggered now
Not sure what are you trying to argue here. :p

If someone is feeling like they're done with this crypto gig and just wants out, or to hedge their holdings for peace of mind with an 1x short, sure, fair enough. Doesn't mean 'the time to short is now' like op is implying. 
It depends. Just another thing to speculate on. If you'd been burned by alts and your favorite pet coin just got listed as a security and can't be traded on your favorite exchange anymore would you cash out to bitcoin or go to fiat and leave the space? 
Lmao. There are no rules here you realize that? It can be gradual, it can be sudden. The whole point of a fractal is to compare similar repeating structures on different timeframes - if we did it once, it can happen again. 
Oof. Not sure. 
ETH and LTC getting heavy again... This is not looking good. 

Specially because i already closed my short on ETH :)
Because I missed the far better shorting opportunity in the $7,000s. 

I've laid out the strong possibilities that price will decline, but there's never a guarantee that's how it will unfold. 
It's not what I'm talking about. It's just saying to people to look back 3 years if they're here for 3 months is stupid. A bit too late for that.
Yeah but I think I've figured a way to basically make free money. I would just short $10,000 contracts, but only long $1000 contracts with *10x leverage.* So if it goes down, I can make $10,000 to infinity. But if it goes up, at most I lose is $1000.
Haha, got me :) 
that's an awful lot of supposition and conspiracy theory isn't it though. You have no facts to back that up, just a hunch.

Also you say to little effect, well it's brought us back down to 6.4k hasn't it this year so i'd say it's had a very decent effect on the price.

and I have no doubt after we break under 6k, we'll continue to fall
TBH I'm still considering if it would be possible to do a self directed IRA and put a LITTLE into a BTC trading fund.  Saving the taxes could be nice, assuming conservative trading and after we finish this bear market and get bullish again.
It's not even trade advice (I have him ignored with RES at this point, but expanded the comment), all his posts are literally just him projecting/coping and lying about his positions or railing on the bears.
Well, I am a winner in five out of my last six trades and up thousands of percent over the long term so, yeah...

Perhaps we see 10k some day but no way it's in 2018 unless we see some massive event spark a rise. The bitter taste of the quick buck population having to sell at a massive loss is too recent to forget. 

We still have a while down to go, 4k minimum. Atleast that's where I start to look for 2yr long term entry 
Delusional, always wrong
Any supporting evidence?

God, I truly hope no one has done that. They were/are my savings/crypto and I've said to my SO that I'm prepared for the crypto to go to zero. 

Obviously we're considering a future together, so they want me to be successful in this endeavor, hence the worry, but it's my venture to make the mistake on. 

Ultimately I think the entire crypto space (even with the glaring flaws, scams, difficulties and regulation) will be the next 'world wide web'\-esque product revolution, so my only annoyance with a 99&#37; drop will be that I could've bought an awful lot more at that level than I did buying higher.
I do. I think moving between log and linear is even more confusing than just picking one. I chart a number of daily/weekly patterns, and occasionally monthly/yearly, so I just use log 100% of the time. The difference on short term on log isn't nearly the same as long term on linear. That said, the breakout point isn't vastly different unless you're on very high leverage. The way this market fakes/wicks, I'd want to wait for confirmation of both. 
Holding under 6500 would be very bearish. What I'd *like* to see is a breakdown of this wedge to 6000-6100 and a technical bounce to retest 6400 as resistance. What I'm expecting to see though is a retest of 6600.

You know that if everybody would know this then it would be untradable?
If you sincerely believe that why didn't you quit after Mt.Gox? Everything you just said has been true for years yet apparently you're still trading BTC? This isn't new, nothing has changed. 
There are many other differences and many of them make 2018 much, much worse.
I know what you mean, I'm the same with charts, bfx seems to follow TA more precisely. Maybe bot action on there drives most price action anyway. Bitstamp seems allaround better for volume and price tho
That's totally fair. I forget sometimes that you guys have way longer time frames and don't try to catch the exact bottom.

That does make a little more sense, then.

That's not even accounting for the fact that I could be horribly wrong. 

Investing is a totally different game so I should've seen it that way
I had one add hit at 6350, so I'm near b/e currently. I think it's mostly just trade exhaustion at this point, especially after the bullshit wicks catching me. It doesn't seem like there's steam to drive us higher right now, but we are so massively oversold, it's ridiculous. 
After LN and atomic swaps become reality they will basically be the same coin so instead of becoming useless like the rest of the alts it will become part of BTC which is awesome IMO
pls
I actually think this is a great time to start aligning yourself with the trend. We've been waiting to break out of this triangle for months. Now that we are close to entering a new range the trend will have presented itself and it will be clear which way the market wants to go for a bit.

It really sucks shorting when 1d rsi is negative, but I just can't say I'd be comfortable longing here considering the strength of the downtrend. I really do think this will end in a capitulation wick and then it'll be time to long for a bit and then switch to short 2-4 weeks after
Are you suggesting that these bounces aren't DCBs but ... well what else would they be?

If you notice, each bounce is smaller. :P like a dead cat, haha

When we bounced to $17.2k I called it a DCB and someone said there was no way a DCB could bounce that high. Yea...remember what happened after...

Anyway, if we do go high from here I wouldn't call it a DCB, I'd be confused and would adjust my strategy. Up until now though, I believe every bounce has generally been of the dead cat variety
Thanks man :) 
People are very much underestimating the effect of what a breakdown of a 17 week triangle has lol. This is a new shift in market dynamics or a new trend. We have basically gone from sideways/tightening to down. Almost makes me afraid to close my shorts and go full long at 6k but I do expect us to retest the triangle first before really breaking down to new lows. 
Fair point, there have definitely been periods where we've had uptrends, past few weeks have not been one of them
It was terrifying and a very aggressive sell-off, but I don't remember any large patterns or anything confirming. It was just simply a very low price and people were scared to buy. 

I think this time around is a bit different, although I do agree that us breaking down below $6k will have some people upset they didn't simply wait because I believe the bounce will happen not too far under that. It would be pretty "bitcoin" to bounce really fucking hard at $5.5k, get people to FOMO in at $7-7.5k and then just tank again. 
I mean I really was totally emotional about it because I hadn't cashed out then. so I was just watching my net worth fluctuate a fuck ton (I'm young and put too much money in)

I sold at $12.8k on the way back up. It went back up to $16k but I wanted out. Was too stressful and couldn't be fucked to deal with the insanity 

Wasn't a bad exit point in hindsight. But it seemed very low at the time since we eventually went back up to $17.2k...
Okay, thanks for the feedback. I'll try to do something better next time.
Thank you sir much appreciated.
Yes but I don't want it to stabilize at $2K and go up 15% every year while Wall St and Main St applaud at it beating the traditional markets.
No need to add leverage but alright man.  I guess I'm just too big a pussy to embrace the risk 🤣 Hedged to death. 
Fair enough... but you look at facts instead of the moon.
I know the technicals. I just have a problem in believing that it can bounce anywhere high right now. We can go sideways for longer time to cool it off.
Go look at 2014 

If you think it was gox or something I guarantee you in 2 years there'll be some "definitive" reason for why the bear market of 2018 occurred 
That's why I'm not trading on gut feeling. But I think I should start putting those 10% bets on it.

Got worse case now. Did what I said. Moved my short to sept futs... But... I didn't close the june one. Now don't know what to do :D 
I'm basically like 4.5x short now from 6650...
have you guys read Trading In The Zone? It's basically that, like when an athlete is at the top of his game and just reacts without doubts or hesitation.
No, you're just out, watching from sidelines, too afraid to play the game.
Are you shorting or just in fiat?
We lost 20%, this may test 6.8 or 7.2 or just drop more, that's why rr is bad now.
You're welcome ;-)
> unless I draw more than the max safe thoughput of the cables so they get hot and maybe catch fire.

I'm getting flashbacks to mining in my bedroom now :() Fire waiting to happen 
Shorting = new paradigm confirmed
Hah, I guess you're right. 

my main point is that this sub would show absolutely 0 restraint if it came to longing the top but everyone here is scared to short the bottom- which is what he's confused about. I'm just trying to explain why it's not as crazy as it seems. 


Well that probably begs the question of why people get into alts and what their motivations are. Is it due to an emotional attachment, or is it more to make quick money and moon? If it's more about gambling and making money, then I would think that many people would want to move to BTC to ride the potential wave.
The environment is completely different than last year. Diminishing buy pressure, low volatility, zero public hype. If you really think a 7 month trend will shift to bullish by some mega BGD from nowhere, I don't know what to say.

Bubble. Is. Over dude.
Interesting watching the ETH ratio mirror BTC's movement (not ETH mirroring BTC creating a flat ratio, but the ratio itself is bear flagging along with BTC)
R/r for a long at 6100 with stop loss that converts to short at 5900 looks good. Thoughts?

(I know it’s 6500 now but if it goes down to 6100)
Going to take a position anytime soon?
Which is why I said most likely don't care about the longer term.. I know this is a trading sub, and a ton of people FOMOed thinking they could swing trade and get rich fast.

I guess the question you'd have to ask yourself is do you believe bitcoin will hit or breach the ATH in 3 years? And are you willing to wait that long. 

If you are, then this is a great time to accumulate. 
No. Everything about that is just *wrong*.
You do not seem to understand the PnL of a short contract. Shorts can technically lose an infinite amount of money if BTC goes to + infinity. In your example, your net position is zero, so you have basically Tethered (technically you're just holding Bitcoin, not tethered)

And there is no such way to make free money dude..
Yeah okay buddy, literally nobody here believes you
Oh my bad I thought you meant RSI 
No, that's literally just what divergence is. You compare well defined local lows to each other or well defined local highs to each other.

You don't compare an indicator in the middle of a drop to it in the middle of a different drop or whatever.
Ok. Thanks. Let's see what she does then. 
I'm afraid that if we see 6.6 we might see 6.8.

Shorts are closing cause we dropped a lot and this may play at least a bit as double bottom. 6.6 isn't much of an entry on that short, that's the problem.

On the other hand it's been a while since I saw negative on sept. And it's barely negative. If we continue down...
I am talking about the real world, not your fantasy world where everyone knows something that they don't.
I haven't been around that long lmao.. And I sort of naively figured that manipulation to that extent had been purged. If it turns out we got another willy bot type situation I will be hesitant to hold any large amount of coins. 
Yep, you got it.

To also be fair, I visit this thread every single day, and look forward to the comments and analyses by yourself and others. I use it to get a general sense of the market and find it extremely valuable. Cheers.
It really doesn't, but that's exactly what $7.3k looked like in March. then it blew the fuck up to $7.8k in one hour and climbed to $9.1k over the next few days. 

however if we don't see that "pop", it could slow crawl up and then dump again.

But it's possible we just continue dumping while holders from 2017 finally get all their shit out and capitulate. It's beginning to happen. 

Could be $7.5k in February again. Where everyone said there's no way this goes lower. And then it does 
I actually think you will get to close this in profit. But I'm not sure if it'll bounce or dump after. 
Still doesn’t make any sense to me other then a speculative coin that will (hopefully) gain in value
Yup.

I'm going with what I have until we break the trend and gonna scalp some on bounces. I think we are too low to go with big short. This could bounce anywhere between here and 5k with really strong push. Don't believe it but I got rekt'couple times by trading what I believe ;-)
My guess is that a dead cat keeps bouncing, as long as you lower the floor every bounce.
Like a dead cat?

Last time I saw a dead cat it didn't bounce. Was just lying there. Completely flat.

... Just like 7k range...
Yea I wouldn't really be surprised either way, but I think people have gotten way too used to either up or ranging/consolidation. If a downward trend appears it will really take a lot of people by surprise.

I think people forget how hard BTC trends when it trends. The biggest indicators are the 50ma weekly crossing down, our tightening range finally breaking down, and 1d rsi not bouncing high off oversold. Haven't done any of those since 2014, and the weekly 50MA crossdown hasn't happened since August 2014 which is when it just tanked for months, riding the ATH -> DCB downtrend line all the way down just like we are now.
Yea, last few weeks have been brutal. But February and April were brutal for shorts, too. It's funny how it's easy to remember which months were up and down because they just alternated...lol
I agree with your suggestion, and that very scenario would be the opposite of what the Op here suggested would be the confirmation of "goblin town", which I presume is the expected continual downward movement.

I'd hate to see them lose the remainder of their stack because they expect the market to do something that it doesn't. Because we all know that it'll often do the opposite of what you actually expect. So gamble with caution is my advice.
I think you made a ton of money with your shorts afterwards? I made an x3 after I cashed out from the first time. I am quite risk\-adverse, dont want to loose what I have, so never traded margin again, got burned too many times some years back...
Trade together. Learn together. Bad boys fo life.
Don't forget there are big players' interests here at stake too, miners, exchanges, whales, those futures cunts and so on. I don't see the price falling below 5000 long term. Likely not even 6000. Can we visit those places? Sure. Will we stay there? I wouldn't say so. I mean, that's my perception. 

See: https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8qfytx/daily_discussion_tuesday_june_12_2018/e0kky8d/
> I just have a problem in believing that it can bounce anywhere high right now. 

Which is exactly what it always feels like at times like these. Which is why it's a great time to buy. Because it's so counter intuitive and everyone is freaking out thinking the end is nigh. 

I'm just waiting for a large volume spike and the fear to kick in properly. 
Lol I originally opened a big sept short to move my swaps over at $7.7k. But then it tanked and I was like well...I guess I'll just hold it. It was an unintentional increase. worked out quite nicely
To be fair it's very risky to short. Some people don't trust non fiat exchanges and you can't really 100% trust most that allow margin trading
Nope. Being in fiat is a choice. I can buy more btc with my cash at a later. My ~10 btc is now almost 30. That is intentionally shorting.  I am fine with that and dont need to pile on margin, take on counter party risk and stop hunts to make 30 into 40. I'm happy with a 3x (so far) by just holding cash with relatively minimal risk.
Fiat is shorting
This is technical analysis - I don't care about any of that. I am looking at the charts and sharing what I see, you can choose to ignore it use it. But just because you disagree with it doesn't mean its not a good fractal.
Probably not until $6,000 breaks down or I have a better opportunity in the upper $6,000s or lower $7000s
I don't care if it will. But I'm aware it may not be higher than now ever again.
Your sarcasm indicator needs a service. 
no u
Agreed. The hardest part to me is figuring out where to bail on my Sept position. If this falling wedge breaks up, I'd put the target around 6800. I don't particularly want to hold it that far, so I think I have to set it just outside the top of the wedge. I'm worst as closing positions in profit. I almost always hold too long, not close too early. There's a definite part of me that wants to exit everything on a break of 6500 and re-assess. 

edit: side note--the downvote brigade seems to have an issue with you and me.
I know. We're at the same side here.
> that manipulation to that extent had been purged. 

Crypto and manipulation go hand in hand. 

And if you're worried about tether... Just take a minute to think what everyone losing faith in it would look like... How are they going to exit? 

[deleted]
I'm holding it for now. If it goes green, I'll be setting b/e stops and looking to manually close around 6120. We're skirting right along a downward resistance line from our wedge above: https://www.tradingview.com/x/bSz5BmTe/

I'm hoping we just drop here and make my life easier. 
Glad I'm holding it (for now). Started knife catching orders from 6265-6100 on Sept (basically profit taking my shorts without having to close the entries). 
> Don't believe it but I got rekt'couple times by trading what I believe ;-)

yes but we have been ranging and the market hasn't been particularly aggressive in either direction...until now.

Anyway, I agree. Could probably get a better short entry by waiting. 
I agree. I thought you were expecting a short squeeze though o_O
Lol everything bounces if you drop it from high enough! That's where the term came from :P
There's also the 200 D MA sloping down and a bear cross between the 100 3D MA & 50 3D MA about to happen (in the next 3-6 days). It's not a question if there's going to be new lows, it's more about when. It's almost impossible to gain enough momentum for them to turn back up if the price isn't flat for months like how it happened in 2014. 

A rally to 7.4k would be one hell of a short opportunity. 
That's awesome.

Yes lately my shorts have been doing pretty well but I took an incredible hit from when I first started margin trading and was extreme emotional and overleveraged and basically clueless. 

I learned pretty quickly after that. 

But took me about 4 months to make up for the losses I made in like. 2 weeks...
Aside from miners, I think Coinbase opening up their institutional investor program is bullish. You think CB is going to let big money fail especially when it's just rolling the program out? I don't think so. Unless it was a hail mary to save the prices..haha
> I'm just waiting for a large volume spike and the fear to kick in. 

That's the problem. I don't see this coming soon. 30k longs still in disbelief and probably hugely underwater. Scalp a long on small bounce - yes, going long heavily - no f.ing way.
You still have it?

I think this should bounce back up a bit, we basically dropped from 7.8 to 6.4 without a bounce, so taking profits here from june futs shouldn't be so stupid.
I understand. But how can he say 'told you' if he's just watching from the sides?  There's enough people who don't touch it and say that. If /u/fuckharvey would come here every hour and say that, then I could say 'yes, you did'.
So you're gonna make 2 successful trades in a year. You were lucky, not right.
Watching closely now to enter a short?  Or not so closely?  (after a 6850 spike today)
Upper 6000s now... any plans/ thoughts /u/_chewtoy_
Absolutely. Which is the risk we're all taking. Bitcoin is a fickle beast.
Is that guy just trolling me?
No you both
That's always biggest problem of trading, where to take profits. I don't like having two open, especially when I just wanted to scalp a bit.

I saw downvotes but really don't care, I'm here for the money and have a lot of upvotes as side effect ;-)
I'm surprised to see you're not building a larger September position here (or at 6800), or keeping it until (or if) we break below 6000. My strategy is to pyramid my trades larger here, I have both XBTUSD and XBTU18 positions here, I'm trying to build larger size on the September futures which I feel more comfortable holding for longer. I'm just not as skittish here as everyone else, in part because we did breakdown convincingly from the symmetrical triangle.
Aren't you from before 2017? :P 
I'm 1.5x from 6.8 on June. I'm leaving that and gonna scalp on the way down if it chooses this way. Probably gonna move this to Sept somewhere and won't close until we break hard above 7 or I see reversal coming (like chewy going long :-D)
I wish I knew... the cat bounced 3rd time on same level \- could be the floor is not willing to give \- increasing confidence level of the bulls.
What if it was a feather?
They announced they were working on it some time ago, so I don't think so, i.e. this is not a ruse.
> Scalp a long on small bounce

I figure it's the best way to enter a long... As to what comes after... That depends on the market, I try not to make assumptions too far out. Entering a long this way gives you options though, and I always like having options. 

What site do you use to track longs/shorts by the way? 
Yea, you're probably right. Going to sleep for now. Will probably wake up to higher price but oh well, just wanna sleep for now. Man Im gonna wake up to like $6.9 watch lol
whatever you need to tell yourself
That's why people should zoom out before they buy, not after.
Based on their first comment I'd say absolutely. 
I do think $7K is a pretty safe ceiling, but I don't really want to open at 6450 and hold that far. If I bail, it will probably be on a clear break upwards through 6500, with the intention of re-opening higher. I had an add to my position hit at 6470, but it's still smaller than my swaps position was. At this point, I'm expecting I'll hold my June position to settlement. We'll see. 
haha, I actually think it will be somewhat clear when to go long. It will very likely be a capitulation wick. But I would likely go short fairly quickly after.

If this really does go below $6k I can imagine it will be fairly profitable to short September...especially since June will close soon and Sept will take on its discount
Best TA indicator there is 😂😂😂
It'd bounce on the moon :D right? I don't know. 
Tradingview.

Got burned on lot of longs lately, will stick to shorts for now.
That's why I'm looking for nice entry on Sept now, to ride both couple bucks lower and close Jun.
Can imagine the discount will get pretty big, like -4-5% big
Want sept in case this don't go back up before end of june ;)
BTW, you know we stopped exactly at the line drawn from nov low and feb low? We're just bouncing on it and that 6.4 wicked below.
