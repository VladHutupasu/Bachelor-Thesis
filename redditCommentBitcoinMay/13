Daily Discussion, May 21, 2018 -- TITLE
It looks like ~$8.5K is the consensus price. 

We keep coming back to around $8.5k, and we may stay in that area for a while, at least until there's a major change in the market or a very significant news. 
Dishonest "game" always pops up.
Ah BTC you are such a luring temptress.

If BTC was an equity, I would say that BTC has hit a floor, but BTC is not an equity, so I am not sure.

It sure seems like it though.
Two things keep bugging me. 
No one really wants to be responsible for having their life savings on a ledger. 
This won't be widely adopted until the wallet on your phone is an nfc tap and pay type scenario and one that allows on the fly conversion to local fiat. 
Ver is literally paying news outlets to interview him so he can trash Bitcoin.  The singular method of their attacks are to change Bitcoin's name to "Bitcoin Core".  
So what's the situation with fees? I just sent like 10 bucks between segwit addresses for like 4 cents and it got confirmed in 2 minutes...
Bitcoin chart on google trends looks awful.
is it possible to send less than 1 satoshi via LN ? or 1 satoshi is the minimum requirement?
Bitcoin is going the way it should be going. 
Can we make $8750 today?
The small correction is over. Now moon!
**Come On The Bulls, lets go for $8900 today and then have a great week where we go for $10k.**
Lower.
so, this was the bullshit pump and dump weekend
Been thinking about this for awhile, gonna sell my entire position at 9k. Take my profits and go.

Consensus took away my confidence in the market. Reddit hates Bitcoin, people who want quick money like Bitcoin. I don't like that. 

Open to hearing reasons to stay in the market but I'm afraid the technology isn't progressing. Anyone feeling the same way?
Can't believe I've got nearly ¬£400 squirrelled away in crypto. I've never saved in my adult life before! It's not as easy to spend and 2‚Äîstep security makes it more of an effort to access. I may make it harder and get a ledger on payday...

In other words.....HODL
Okay;  you guys won me over with the Peter Joseph. I changed my mind:  I'm starting to like the pussy on his face.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HwFOo5rbZA

Where my moon at fam?
Sitting back in a lawn chair laughing at the sellers at this 24hr time here comes a huge buy!
When moon
Is this it? The new norm of price will be what it‚Äôs hovering around or below. I feel this bitcoin fad is dying and we‚Äôll all be left in the red. Sad, wanted my lambo.
Ah, it's good to be back! How's everyone doing?
 How goes the Bitcoin on this fine Monday morning boys?
fuck, I lowkey want bitcoin to not rise this fast so I can buy more
Hey yall. I have some super small BitcoinX and superbitcoin balances on Binance and I'm wondering how to get rid of them. Anybody have an address for either of these that I could send them to? 
Ok Bitcoin, that's enough pumping, now go back to the abyss you belong to.
We touched bottom. Several times. First time 6k, second time 6.8k, then 7.9k and now 8.4k. Lower lows. Next stop: 10k to 1. of June. You‚Äôre welcome.
I feel like even significant news doesn't affect the price anymore like it used to. And I agree that we're going to hover around \~$8.5k.
What was the major change or significant news in nov/dec last year?

Do we honestly think the markets are that rational? When was the last time you saw any correlation between good news and price increases, or bad news and price decreases?

Looks like it's us vs them. Let's show them.
Better than in the bank. 
What is having multiple addresses?

Yeah, I'm a fan of letting the two co\-exist peacefully and letting the market decide, if Ver wasn't going around trashing Bitcoin, saying it's Legacy or Core, etc.. not to mention all the other shady shit on [bitcoin.com](https://bitcoin.com), etc..  but because he is, fuck Bcash/Ver. I am definitely ready to see that dickhead fade into obscurity.
Are any babies being harmed during these interviews?
That's still not great.
Google trends reflects new interest, half of the world knows about bitcoin already they don't go on google everyday and type bitcoin you know.
Technically possible, yes, how that gets handled when you close a channel, I don't know. 
To the moon?
Today we can hodl
Possibly.  50/50.
I rather we see this as a fresh start.

Saying it's a correction from a crash 5 months ago is not being realistic.
yes we ill be very happy if starting to climb. hud'lers just be ready for the take 0ff
If you want to get a better idea of what's going on in experienced traders heads and their predictions, head on over to r Bitcoin markets. 
BitcoinAlways can you just shut up for a effing day? It‚Äôs always come on bullshit with you
Higher
There were people that felt that way here 4 years ago.  I bet they wish they could go back in time and tell their younger selves to HODL. 
What makes you think it‚Äôs going to 9k anytime soon?
You're bummed that Consensus didn't pump as hyped? Do you have any actual fear that Bitcoin doesn't have an absurdly bright future? My recommendation is to not trade on emotion, but rather keep educating yourself. Read books, not Reddit. Research development, not hourly price movements. If you don't have faith in the future and were just looking to make tons of money, you're better off pulling out.
You might be waiting quite a while before you can sell at 9k.
Why do you say ¬´Reddit hates Bitcoin¬ª? 
You are a hypocrite.
I'm shorting BTC after a year or so of thoroughly believing it. I've absorbed as much of the high quality literature, followed all the dramas and remained as open-minded as I can, and I still feel the same way. There are, and will be more, better alternatives.

Using Bitcoin at the cost of significantly higher fees, much slower confirmation times, the enormous amount of wasted energy to achieve 3-7 transactions per second and the increased inconvenience of managing your own keys, isn't enough to convince me or really most people that it will be used for mass adoption. I know all the counter-arguments of "lightning will fix this", "but freedom" and "all the energy used would otherwise be wasted", but I'm not convinced.

Kindly feel free to try and change my mind, but at this point it's far easier to argue against BTC than it is to argue for the benefits of it in its current state.
Okay, let's ignore lightning completely and say technology isn't progressing.
There were people that felt that way here 4 years ago.  I bet they wish they could go back in time and tell their younger selves to HODL. 
I agree, nice one.
good for you!  crypto is a great way to save, especially given low interest rates and depreciation in fiat.
Nice man!! May I ask how old you are?
is this good or bad for btc? your post confuses me
Anti free market... Pro bitcoin... What a childish hypocrisy. 
Or saggytitcoin
The ride will be trying but fun 
Sell all your bitcoin and go on with your life then?
Not sure if serious
 Cool doom and gloom buddy 
Invest it all in alts 
the lack of patience here is astonishing...
We're reaching capitulation :) 
Go check the halvening calendar and the future effect on supply, it should pump you up. Unless you're in for the short term, in which case I cannot help.
i'm good and you?  bitcoin is going sideways...
Me too but I wouldn‚Äôt exactly call this rising fast.  It‚Äôs been bargain price under 10k now for months. 
hm I actually want bitcoin to rise a bit honestly, I'm looking forward to the price of alts going up
Its not confirmed yet that this is the lowest point tho
Higher lows perhaps? 
Technically, you just described lower highs...
It could either go up or down from here
lower highs as well mate
The market was significantly different last novermber and december, it was a full on wild FOMO market. We are in a very different market now, that's why we're hovering around this price. Unless there's a significant shift, it's gonna be more of the same.
Why?

We keep hearing all these rhetorics.
Every day
"Half the world" is a bit of a guess. Regardless, no new interest isn't an ideal scenario either.
Floor rounding
You got it!
yes and when this happen many hud'lers will be very happy
But here it's more fun. üòÅ
Ok cheers :)
What's your problem? 
Ligher
Nothing at all. May never reach 9k again. Maybe I should just take the leap now. It's hard though, been in this market for years.
What books do you suggest us to read?
I wouldn't say I'm bumbed that consensus didn't lead to a pump. I'm bumbed at the quality of the talks and presentations. 

I want to protect my investment, that's all.

Edit: One other thing, I wouldn't discard Reddit's opinion on Bitcoin. If Bitcoin is to succeed, it's young people who need to be willing to adopt it. 
I've always been confused that the scaling solution to BTC is to not use BTC. It's still over a year away from being production ready, realistically. 
Lightning is cool, and when implemented for commerce perhaps I'll use it. I don't need to have money invested in the market to use Bitcoin in the future.
Conversely, there are many people who wish they sold in December. 
Well, that's a strange statement given that crypto delivers %0 interest and has depreciated 60% this year against fiat.
30-40 is all I'm giving you! 
Good for price. I'm HODL. Bad for adoption, I'm not spending. 
Go read a book dummy.
Doing great! That Bitcoin is always doing something isn't it?

Also, who TF downvoted me? Lmao u/bitcoinalways that was you wasn't it?
Bargain price being many multiplies higher than it was 12 months ago and above where it has been for 97% of its existence? 
How is it ever confirmed 
yeah, lower highs as well, but with low lows it makes a triangle and breaking point
Price stability sounds nice to me. I'm all for it. 
Yeah go put all your money in Wells Fargo;  ask for extra accounts lol
[deleted]
:(

Roger will not be happy
It is my dude, glad to see you're still buying the dip btw!
have you really been in this market for years? As in more than 2 years? And you think now is the time to sell? When noone talked about bitcoin, no press, no media, only darknetmarkets and some cyberpunks you thought it was good to keep, now with all the mainstream attention and institutional money you think it is the right time to sell?
Cant understand it. 
Well I'm older than 40. I'm on Reddit and heavily invested in Bitcoin. Sorry, you lose. ;-)
L2 Summit actually seemed more interesting in terms of both technical philosophical discussion.  Less hype, more content.
Haha, yes it's the broke young people driving the price, not all us retiring middle agers with thousands of dollars to invest and diversify. Oh, yes and we remember the dot com boom, us useless middle agers. 
Untill it goes to 30k and they wish they didnt sell in december
just zoom out.  bitcoin is up 400% over a year ago today.
I'm in this boat too
No it wasn't. 
When it hits zero
Did any Wells Fargo customer lose their deposit or not paid his interest?
Of course.  That's exactly what the Fed do.
Institutional money has been here for a very long time.... They know how to profit from FOMO...
Haha fair enough. But anyway, what exactly am I losing?
It's the broke young people who have been responsible for Bitcoin's adoption and continued development.

But sure, speak about the price as if that some how validates anything.
Sudden spikes in Bitcoin price work against adoption. 
Bubble is over.  Deflating since Dec.
Lol someone hates me. I know it couldn't be you, you're good people BA. Bro fist ‚úä

Where are you from?

Your preconceptions about Bitcoin and Reddit.
This is what discourages me, is so few are thinking long term..
Adoption is a joke.

BTC as a currency died with exchanges and the speculation that they encouraged.  
Correction is nearly over. New market cycle is about to begin.
sure.  obviously if you believe that bitcoin has peaked, then it would be stupid to buy it now, at least for speculative reasons.  i don't believe that it has peaked.
:) 
Redditors man. They're the types that dont give the acknowledgment nod or "hi" back when you walk by them. 

Most of these people literally have nothing to do but shit on one another. Funny thing is they never defend their views or discuss why they disagree. They simply neg and run away. 
You are an anomaly in Reddit's demographics, so I don't think I am.

Regarding Bitcoin, perhaps.
The vast majority here are just trying to get rich quick. 
50/50 and frankly, I would like to believe you.

I cashed out at 8.2, deciding when to re-enter.
correct. new cycle down to 2k
I believe that both 2013 and 2017 peaks were price manipulated.

So, while it is possible, I think a 3rd peak when all the regulators' eyes are now watching is going to be a tough act.
I feel like who ever downvoted you, confirmed your assertion.
I'm 40 this year...   and on reddit. wife is 43 and on reddit. are we anomalies? that's sick.
You could be an "anomaly" too if your IQ was a bit higher ;D
Welcome to the Free-market.
Well, you might get another chance a little below 8k, but I wouldn't bet on it.
You don't know what a market cycle is, do you?
no doubt that the price of bitcoin has been manipulated.  and that market manipulation will become more difficult as regulation increases.  but bitcoin's steady climb since its inception can't be attributed solely to manipulation.

anyway if you don't think it will go up then don't buy it.  are you trying to convince me of your viewpoint?  i'm not trying to convince you of mine.
Statistically, yes. 
If I really think it's going to go below 8k, I will be shorting it now.

At 8.5, it's most dangerous as my take is that it really is 50/50.
No, not trying to convince you.  

Just deciding for myself whether to short/long or just wait it out.
