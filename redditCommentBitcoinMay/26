Daily Discussion, May 08, 2018 -- TITLE
Yesterday we issued a couple temporary bans to accounts who were spreading fake news about a supposed SEC meeting, apparently in a widespread attempt to manipulate markets. Those accounts have been labeled and will be banned permanently if caught doing anything similar. 
Does anyone else have a wife that gets mad every time you buy bitcoin or is it just mine? 
For those calling this a sell off. Take a look at the 30 day chart: https://prnt.sc/jf8wyg

This is a bullish chart: Higher lows, higher highs... If it breaks significantly down then you might have the start of a point but until then this is still a promising chart in the mid term. 

Hate to use the cliche but zoom out and don't panic over short term moves
I just bought the dip at $9100, any buyers with me? 
Hodl the dickline!
"Hold the dickline !"

same procedure every sunday-tuesday. will go up again from tomorrow on
We're below the dickline! Now's the time to buy - we'll be back above it in no time. Buy when everybody is selling and sell when everybody is buying, right?
What is the "dickline" i keep reading about? Im kinda new to crypto
Did my part. Added another dollar cost average buy in =)

what's wrong with rats? I like rats. A friend of mine has one as a pet and they are super friends!

I hate that Buffet guy.  Why did he say that crap??  Other than Margaritaville, his songs all suck.

I just bought the dip @ $9,120

Now i can go to eat with that warm feeling in my heart i get when i'm doing my part.

ARE YOU DOING YOURS??
Not many shorts on Bitfinex over the last few days, but an increase of shorting this morning. Something to keep an eye on.
Meanwhile exchanges and whales use these stupid dinosaurs Warren Buffett and Bill Gates sentiment on the BTC market to short it for their own personal benefit. Next day, CNBC: "Bitcoin drops $600 after leading investors call it rat poison"
**Keep fighting Bulls!**
Hey now! Cheap coins 
Bullishhhhh
FUD cann't keep us under $10k forever guys :D HODL and be patient 
**Keep going Bulls!**
Up 2% since last week
It's ok Bitcoin, you can do this...
Is the Iran news good for crypto?
This fight back from the depths... How long will it last 
I don't know shit for TA but I said eff it and bought another one. Got 2 bitcoin. When can I expect to order my lambo, you guys?
To the Mo.......Ocean!!! Aw yea getting me some more.
all this crying....Buffet has nothing to do with this simple correction,,,,buy more btc...we shall overcome
Would it be wise to have a hardware wallet and an Android wallet at the same time?  I just bought a Ledger Nano S and am planning to store almost all of my Bitcoins on that, and then maybe around $500 to $1000 worth of Bitcoin on Mycelium for spending. I was thinking that if my software wallet gets hacked, then my hardware wallet would still be secured.

Quick question, if I transfer btc between my hardware and software wallet, the chances of my hardware wallet bring hacked is pretty low, right?

Sorry for being long winded but I'd be super grateful for any answers. Thank you!
I'm of course bullish on BTC long\-term but I have a feeling that Mr McAfee will be eating a sausage dinner come the end of 2020
Now the NYSE wants to sell Bitcoin.. is this a good thing or bad thing?? Look what happened the bitcoin on December when the futures started..

The 9k memes are getting stale now
Next week is consensus conference. Every year after the conference BTC has gone up between 10/70%.  So there‚Äôs that 
mcafee is a lunatic he needs to stay away from crypto. give it a bad name
Back down to 8k we go
[deleted]
Any recommendations for bitcoin exchanges? I had to sell everything I had(which wasn't much) at Coinbase since Xfers will stop supporting Singapore due to legal reasons.
lol got so close to 10k and now we might be heading right back to 8.8k 3 days later, sighh. here‚Äôs to hoping this week is better 
whuds ma bitcoin werf?
I'd be all over these prices if I had the money, sadly my student loans are due for this paycheck so can't take advantage
We could use some more volume...

Whelp so much for a strong weekend
Today I want to drink poison rat... some sugestions? Thanks
Ready for 5k. I dont think we are out of this bear market yet. We need more pain for a sustainable growth after. Too many kids still in the game.
6k here we come
Here we go back down to 8k in the next week then back up 
Back down to sub 9k hahaha
[removed]
Back to sub 9k. possibly 8k if it doesn‚Äôt hold at 8.8k
Berkshire Hathaway wants to destroy cryptocurrency. 
The fight for the anal depths of 9k is back on again. Back to 8.8k and if it breaks that then 8k is easily attainable.
And straight down...

 Guys I have question if I understand it correctly, If for example vechain goes to 7 dollars, and I bough it at 3.5 dollars, and then I trade it with etherum which is for example 700, it is logical then to trade it to USDT on binance and leave it there for a while while vechain probably goes down, or should I trade for etherum and send it to GDAX and trade it to eur and wait? what is better option? 
I hope you all realize that McAfee's $1,000,000 prediction is backed up by nothing. It's simply an exponential function applied to the price of bitcoin. An exponential function can be applied to anything. Will it follow it? Possibly. Is it a guarantee? Absolutely not.

Thank you for that.  Keep up the good work... it‚Äôs the wild west with cryptocurrencies and we need some good sheriffs like yourself.  
Thanks. 
Thanks. 

Edit.  I‚Äôd like to make a suggestion. Please consider assigning a ‚Äúknown troll‚Äù badge (if possible) to known trolls who consistently just post FUD all the time. They come out of the woodwork whenever bitcoin price comes down and it would be helpful for newbs to know who they are so they can make an informed decision on whether to listen to them. 
why didn't that happen last week? this sub was blowing up last week about the sec meeting and all it was going to do for the weekend pump.

Pump and Dump her

Yeah mine doesn‚Äôt get crypto at all. I just don‚Äôt bring it up. 
Exactly, this thread is flooded by officially-tagged fud-trolls.
9100 is not the dip but almost the top of the last few months
Yep, I bought a little bit in the recent dip, not very much, but all I could swing at the moment. It‚Äôs like when the price goes down, you win: you can buy cheaper BTC. When the price goes up, you win, higher value.

Union Maj. Gen. John Pope became convinced that he had trapped Jackson and concentrated the bulk of his army against him. On August 29, Pope launched a series of assaults against Jackson's position along an unfinished railroad grade. The attacks were repulsed with heavy casualties on both sides. At noon, Longstreet arrived on the field from Thoroughfare Gap and took position on Jackson's right flank. On August 30, Pope renewed his attacks, seemingly unaware that Longstreet was on the field. When massed Confederate artillery devastated a Union assault by Maj. Gen. Fitz John Porter's V Corps, Longstreet's wing of 25,000 men in five divisions counterattacked in the largest simultaneous mass assault of the war. The Union left flank was crushed and the army was driven back to Bull Run. Only an effective Union rear guard action prevented a replay of the First Manassas defeat. Pope's retreat to Centreville was nonetheless precipitous.
I notice that too

Do the opposite of the sheeple and you will make dough. 
Buy when cock's on the line? 
Its just few percent, check time ago at 2018\-april\-06 it was 17.2&#37; bellow line ;\)

It means literally nothing :D

But if it goes down it will goes up ;\)
If yours goes up on the morning you know you have to buy. Otherwise you sell. That is dickline.

Everything is on dickline.info
Its a way to find comfort for the people that bought at ath
Wow look at the Mr. Moneybags over here.
They did, British origins via language. 
I did miss that, thanks.


how could you not like Cheeseburger in Paradise 
you sound like a mormon
Good Good you bought the hight :D :D Now lets dip moore and more :D :D
Yes. I sold them to you. Good luck!
It's gonna be a bumpy ride this time. :)
buliish???? right now?
You want bulls to ... keep on losing versus selling pressure?
and Iran

Iran so far away
What Iran news?
Who cares? If it doubles will you get out? Not me. That's not even low earth orbit territory for me.
Looking good bulls.  Keep it up 
Till 2020.
I want to buy right now so badly. I just had to invest an unexpected amount of money into my business and I‚Äôm out of funds for a couple weeks. Agghhhhh
Hell yeah
That's where the whale s are
It's hangover tax selling pressure.  If it plays out like '01 the next bottom will be lowest bottom ever since ATH, going forward.

TL;DR  if you want to pick a bottom,  this is the one to pick.

good luck!






no but it gives big stakeholders a reason to short and then blame it on them.

fuck those old dinosaurs. Who says "worse than trading baby brains"? They have an agenda regardless
Yes.

However. Mycelium still doesn't support segwit. I suggest you look into android wallets that do support it - like Samourai for example. 
I have the nano and it's great, very intuitive. So far, they remain to be very secure as long as it wasn't already initialized with a passphrase when you boot it up. Yup, some keeps spending amounts on software wallets or on exchanges for spending/trading.
Yes and yes.

This is exactly the way you should do it.
McAfee will literally tweet about any coin as long as he‚Äôs paid enough. I have no faith that that bet was serious, but I‚Äôd love to see the loon eat his own dick either way. 
If his word is as good as the Anti-Virus, I highly doubt it...
He doesn't quite believe what he said, he just wants media attention. But I do believe it will be higher than it is now by 2020.
Good as it will eventually lend some credibility to BTC.

But to get there, expect the journey to be really rocky.
For the love of god it wasn't the farking futures !! If you do 2000&#37; in a year in a parabolic move it's going to crash. For farks sake. 
considering how hard people were bashing the nyse and stocks in general on this sub, I'd say it's a bad thing. but this such a bipolar place, the logic just gets twisted into whatever narrative fits that hour. so it's probably great.
How old are you... guessing you are 12 or something. If comments from one person hurts bitcoin then it deserves it. If you actually believe in BTC then just keep holding and stop complaining.
they are preparing it right now
That'd be nice.  Who knows if it will happen again, though. 
good to have that conference and I think everyone here will be waiting how it will go.

Watch YouTube videos of interviews of him with the mainstream media. He presents himself quite formally (when necessary) and makes a great case for crypto.  Very different from his alleged private persona. I was very impressed anyway. 
what‚Äôd he do this time 
But he is an entertaining lunatic. Bitcoin would be less exciting without him.
Some blockchain sites aren't segwit compatible.  Make sure the one you are using is.
Only wertcha willin ta sell it for 
Kraken support has been shit since the beginning of time. 
It‚Äôs only Tuesday dude. Things can turn around really fast in Crypto Land
Just a reversion to the dickline
It could either go up or down from here
No, don't do that
have spinach near by, in case you change your mind after you swallow it.
Do you want to be Pickle-Rat like rick. 

kids are the demo. can't lose them.
The same person theee days earlier pointing his tail to sky while moaning ‚Äúmooooon‚Äù
We're not seeing 6K ever again.

There, i said it.
Why do you even do that ?
Or we go up to 12k and then back down...
The concern trolls are back.
Enjoy your money markets and CD's pleb
yup.....so buy now!!

Why doesn't Anne Hathaway like Bitcoin?
I'm gonna start reporting your ass every day for spam
Are you gonna post this every day?
Going to start reporting these as spam. 
Wrong forum
I'd say USDT because of the withdrawal fees of Ethereum to GDAX from Binance
Trade it for USD, not USDT.

Hello Captain Obvious! I hope you're fine.
Bitcoin is backed up by nothing. The dickline is backed up by a promise to eat a dick.
What did you think we thought it was that you needed to clarify it for us? 
No Shit!
Wait! This shit aint guaranteed? Stop the fucking boat. I need to get off.
It's just a marketing gimmick.
hey, you were the ones asking ‚ÄúI wonder where the 10k never again guy is?‚Äù Well, here he is! lol 
Why do you keep spamming this? Piss off if it happens it happens it doesn't take a genius making a guess if it either goes up or down. I would love this to pass 10K so we can all give you your own Hashtag # nobend 
Lmao this dude is back 
Whats the next title if btc breaks 10k?
Also FYI it hit 10k on binance, and Bithumb, so you‚Äôre wrong :)

We typically just ban those 'known trolls' if mods think it's gotten out of hand. 
You are probably thinking of a different sub. Search results for 'SEC' don't return anything pertaining to this supposed meeting. First time I started hearing this meeting rumor was only about 48 hours ago. 
She'll probably spend it all on fillers and new titties. Profit will be gone before you know it.
Hard Fork.
just like it's filled with newly minted fomo trolls.
but but.. aren't you a physicist? :D
What is port? 
Pope was born in Louisville, Kentucky, the son of Nathaniel Pope, a prominent Federal judge in early Illinois Territory and a friend of lawyer Abraham Lincoln. He was the brother-in-law of Manning Force, and a distant cousin married the sister of Mary Todd Lincoln. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1842, and was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the Corps of Topographical Engineers. He served in Florida and then helped survey the northeastern border between the United States and Canada. He fought under Zachary Taylor in the Battle of Monterrey and Battle of Buena Vista during the Mexican-American War, for which he was appointed a brevet first lieutenant and captain, respectively. After the war Pope worked as a surveyor in Minnesota. In 1850 he demonstrated the navigability of the Red River. He served as the chief engineer of the Department of New Mexico from 1851 to 1853 and spent the remainder of the antebellum years surveying a route for the Pacific Railroad.
And buying April 6th would've meant big gains if you bought and then sold once it reached the line again right?
what if it goes up cause I have to pee? buy?
holy shit they changed the url, 10/10 
we don't know how much or how little he invested.  the fact that he is using dollar cost averaging says nothing about the magnitude of his purchase.
$9k held...in theory we go back to test $10k now...
He posts this everyday a few times, this is a sign that bitcoin causes people to go mental talking to themselves 
Dunno... they went so fast...
Donald is trying to start WW3 again, which hardly counts as new anymore. It just means higher oil & gasoline prices, which is good for Don's friends in Saudi Arabia & United Arab Emirates. They'll probably use the extra money to buy more shares of Goldman Sachs and/or bomb Yemen some more, which means they won't be spending it on bitcoin an driving the price up.
If we constantly keep rejecting 8000 it's going to go super bullish 
I bought that last dip at around 6800 so I got a little wiggle room
But Samourai doesn't support ledger nano s.. AFAIK


Thank you for the suggestion, will do! Cheers.
Thank you for your answer. I think that's what I will do. Buying my first couple of Bitcoins from an exchange today. Super nervous.
no need to sudo swear ;)
Warren Buffet's comments probably didn't have that much bearing on Bitcoin's price this week: but the point still remains that the words of successful investors carry weight that affects how people invest their money. It is therefore implausible that his words are entirely free from self-interest.
there‚Äôs a documentary about him on Netflix, you should watch it lol. Dudes insane 
He's ridiculous when predicting prices, but the dude understands the tech like it's his dick.
Yeah things always turn on a dime around here but not really worried, still gotta get those sub 9k buys in üòÜ
almost 4% below the dickline now. We may have crossed it for the last time.
Hope that's not true; I'm not planning on buying till it's sub 6k.
It's had two attempts; third time lucky?
If a short, I will regret it. If I don‚Äôt short, I will regret it. Whatever I do, market will acr opposite.
or we just keep moving to the right
This doesnt even make sense
ummm yeah, you do diversify, don't you? I have a good number of cds and a couple mm accounts. just a small portion of my port >5%... I like like fixed rates sometimes. and staggered cds for my kid. you never put all your eggs in one basket. very bad plan.
I'm following you !
Will go for usdt :)
5 wheels in a car makes perfect sense. You use 4 and have a fifth as backup.

Always have a plan-B!
Thanks! You too.
Let me hop off with you. Unbelievable. I feel fucking conned. I thought I was going to be a millionaire on Dec 31, 2020. Fuck this.
Probably not "I was wrong". He only postdicts. 
Even better.  But for those trolls that fall into a grey area such as the ‚Äú10k never again‚Äù guy, or the guys who consistently post ‚Äúnext stop 6k‚Äù when we only move down a few % in an effort to scare people, perhaps the ‚Äúknown troll‚Äù badge could help.  Either way we appreciate the mods here getting involved as it can get out of control  at times. 
go to any of the daily discussions from last week. in this sub
"depreciating assets"
Amateur only, unfortunately.  However, if bitcoin moons that may change. Or at least I‚Äôll have more time.  That‚Äôs my dream anyway. 
Portfolio 
The Pacific Railroad was a railroad based in the U.S. state of Missouri. It was a predecessor of both the Missouri Pacific Railroad and St. Louis\-San Francisco Railway.

The Pacific was chartered by Missouri in 1849 to extend "from St. Louis to the western boundary of Missouri and thence to the Pacific Ocean."\[1\] Due to a cholera epidemic in 1849, which was a citywide disaster, and other delays, groundbreaking did not occur until July 4, 1851.

In 1865, it became the first railroad to serve Kansas City, after construction was interrupted by the American Civil War. In 1872, the Pacific Railroad was reorganized as the Missouri Pacific Railway by new investors after a railroad debt crisis
yup :D
I think bet the 9 to 10 k bitcoin will roam around
Bitcoin madness. 
He just wants to distract from Stormy. It will be forgotten in a few days.
The question is, is it strong support or just low volume?
It doesn't need to.
You're right, it doesn't. But OP wasn't planning on using his nano with his phone, - he wants two separate wallets (AFAIK). 
Good timing! 
Pseudo
Can I just swear ? It frustrates the hell out of me. Obviously if your asset does 2000&#37; it's going to crash.  I don't understand this search for a reason. The reason is known. It went parabolic. And that's that. 
Yes, he was bearish on Amazon and look at them now. Completely destroyed the company. 
Errrrrrr......ooook....

But life lesson 1, don't try short something that does 2000&#37; a year. That was always going to hurt. 
stop spreading FUD 
Noice, all they do is plug their channel. It's become spam at this point. 
I would be pretty amazed if events in this sub, could bend the market to its knees. 


Kinda sounds like you are concern trolling which in itself is a banable offense in other subs.   
Under your rules, you'd ban yourself. 
What are your picks? 
A crisis (from the Greek Œ∫œÅŒØœÉŒπœÇ - krisis;[1] plural: "crises"; adjectival form: "critical") is any event that is going (or is expected) to lead to an unstable and dangerous situation affecting an individual, group, community, or whole society. Crises are deemed to be negative changes in the security, economic, political, societal, or environmental affairs, especially when they occur abruptly, with little or no warning. More loosely, it is a term meaning "a testing time" or an "emergency event".
Ja I don't know. I wasn't expecting this at all. There goes my Lambo in it's tjops. 
part of this community is the madness like that haha
The Stormy story is good for Trump, even if it causes his impeachment. It distracts from his terrible policies and more serious crimes, and makes his base rally around him even more. Trump's approval rating is going up because of the Story story, just as Clinton's approval rating went up because of the Monica Lewinsky story and impeachment. There will never be 67 Senators willing to remove a President that is still popular with his base, so it's all political theater.
It's low volume. It will eventually run out of buyers.

To go up, it needs a lot of money constantly flowing in. That is not happening and that is why Bitcoin is and will be well behind the ATH for some time.
Thanks, It‚Äôs the programmer in me :)
My point's flown way over your head - regardless of whether or not he succeeded in devaluing Bitcoin, his intentions matter. Calling it "rat poison squared" comes across far more self-interested in warning people off investing than sincere.
You'd think a potential 2000% increase in 1-2 years would be worth* the long hold, especially with tax incentive. Even if it drops down sub 7k, so what. Wait.
Yep, 2000% is clearly not a bubble.
Lol piker!  You just don't learn.
did 2000% . not does 2000%. it's currently down about 50% from eoy 2017, right? I am looking at this chart right? right?
diversify your portfolio is fud now? wtf?
No doubt :)

Went from $1000 to $20 000 in less than a year before it crashed. I wouldn't bet against something that does that.
There are similar lunatics in power in many countries in Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Africa. The US only seems weird if you expect it to behave like a developed country, rather than a banana republic.
and on the flip side, I wouldn't bet on something that does that. I mean, I wouldn't bet it all. I'd bet a little.
