Who else is hodling despite the dump on the weekend? Raise your hand -_-/
I mined 100BTC back in the day because I was a nerd and it was cool. 

It was 50BTC after a few days, then another 50BTC after 3 more weeks. It wasn't worth it at the time, and it was only worth a few dollars.

I wiped the drive, and I no longer have the computer...

Damnit.
I find Buffet and Munger calling it scumball activity particularly offensive in that it’s pointed not towards the technology itself but directly to it’s users. Like countless others I use it for buying on Newegg and Overstock, I trade it regularly for investing in other assets, and firmly believe in it’s potential. Am I therefore entitled to be insulted by someone who invested in companies like Monsanto or Procter&Gamble? How do you call activity like investing in companies who have no sense of moral or ethical values?
Here we are now. Hung up at the Macafee dick line again.
There is no SEC meeting today, Its just the wall street journal spreading fud   https://www.msn.com/en-us/finance/news/ethereum-price-takes-a-knock-ahead-of-rumored-us-regulators-meeting/ar-AAwT5yi
when i was at school in the uk, i used to do payed surveys online & PPC. done it for about 3 months ended up wit £12 and 3.1(ish) bitcoin never bothered transferring the bitcoin out the account. used to get like 0.05 BTC per survey etc.


If the price drops below the dickline, all hell will break loose. https://dickline.info/ 

I am100% certain of my prediction because of my fool proof dickline based technical analysis system.
I heard there is no SEC meeting today. Actually I also didnt find any such official statement. 
Is it a FUD?
So with the revelation that the alleged SEC meeting today is fake news, can we all relax a bit?     I’d like to get the balloon 🎈 ready for our upcoming weekend voyage to 10k. 
The elevator is going *up*!
Gdax charts looking good. Up we go 
I have respect for Warren Buffet, but he really shouldn't comment about a technology he doesn't fully understand. His two cents easily sway a large number of people who buy or sell based on his personal opinion. He already [admitted](http://fortune.com/2018/05/06/why-warren-buffet-was-wrong-about-google-amazon/) that he was wrong about Amazon and Google.
morning everyone！

Some news about Bitcoin Ore? The date realising or coming updates?
Good Moo(r)ning Asia!
Hi I'm Greg, and I'm a **HODLoholic.** 
Just bought my first on coinbase, happy to be a part of it. I kinda wish I had pulled the trigger a few years ago when one of my friends talked about it. Better late than never right?? Right guys? 

Anyways, only 50$ in atm so im low risk
7,245 users here now

This is getting lower and lower
if all goes well with the SEC meeting see you in 10k :P 
Should I buy or should I sell....
10k tonight ... Life on the dickline..
10.2 k this week
anyone got any pied piper coin? only 7 cents!
If you want to know how much money would have you made if you had invested in bitcoin, visit http://cryptofrustrator.com/


lol pied piper coin is out today
Is there somewhere that I can sell an amazon gift card for btc via lightning?

We're good! Come on back guys.
Bulls

Alrighty friends, let's do some live Bitcoin Analysis! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqHCk4JBzCU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqHCk4JBzCU)
Almost 1 million to sell in 9400$ \(Bitstamp\). A big wall, where is the zombie dragon when is needed?
I have a theory. Big investors know that 10k+ means fomo from the small time investors and therefore will continue to dump and accumulate in the 8-10k region until it’s squeezed dry then we will see a new high 
Will we dump under 9000 ?
I've only been invested with Bitcoin now for about a week, so this is my first major dip. I didn't panic sell, I've all but got the panic screams under control. Onwards and upwards!
Bill Gates: "As an asset class, you're not producing anything and so you shouldn't expect it to go up. It's kind of a pure 'greater fool theory' type of investment," Gates said. "I would short it if there was an easy way to do it."

Wow, gates knows so much about bitcoin! He doesn't even realize you can short it on CBOE.


I'm looking for any opinions on what effect the BTC wealth distribution might have on the markets should BTC reach anything like what is predicted (say US$50k +). I think this wealth distribution is the elephant in the room myself, but would like to hear any opinion on the matter. Any links to known articles discussing this would be appreciated. 

https://btc.com/stats/rich-list
I prayed there would be a pullback before my fiat cleared and here it is :') stock up people!
**Keep going Bulls!**
Even the government knows that it was the beginning of the futures that had the biggest impact on The 70% fall in Dec 17'.       https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/07/launch-of-bitcoin-futures-dragged-down-prices-fed-paper-shows.html
...btc rising from the ashes :) 
Buffet and Gates are some of the biggest Frauds and liars in history.  I wouldn't be concerned about their opinions on Bitcoin.  The SEC meeting is way more relevant
$9k memes ready to go!
So what do we think will still be around in 5 years, Bitcoin or that breathing corpse Charlie Munger? What a complete joke of a human being. 

Warren Buffett is the real satoshi...
Eff is everyone?

I am Hodling in the uk until Mcafee s correct prediction gives me a hard on Come on Btc !!!!!
👐
I knew the dump was going to happen just like I’m predicting the next few days will be a surge. It’s pure whale manipulation. That’s what they do. Anybody who could not see that dump is an idiot. The whales perform heavy dumps every 4-5 days at the most. That dump was well overdue.. since there wasn’t a dump since last Monday.
Thats almost 1 million $$$ at the moment. Sorry man. That story even makes me hurt!
I wonder what percentage of total BTC have had the same fate of format c:\
OUCH! 
Wow so sorry 😐 
P.S.  this reminds me of a recent Big Bang theory episode 
This is a really good point that I haven't really considered before. And that's saying something because I've been in this space for quite some time.
Totally agree.  
To their credit, I use it for drugs.

I mean, I use it for legal things as well, but also drugs.
countless others that buy on Newegg and overstock? nope, there's a number, it's not that many.
there was just a whole article, right here on reddit, about the nightmare experience buying on Newegg and overstock with crypto. are you guys that forgetful?
Stop worrying about being offended and live your life.  You're insulted by a headline?  Don't take it so personally.
Plus these are two guys on their death beds so out of touch with the future it isn’t even funny.
So McAfee and Tom Lee throwing wild projections are not offensive?


The *biggest* indickator
the only time to short BTC is in January it seems
Apparently there is no scheduled meeting on SEC website either, they are just trying to crash the markets
Fake news strikes again 
Why didn't you hodl?
he's going to have to eat about 0.6% of his dick it forecasts.

is self-circumcision a thing and how does one add it to myfitnesspal?
it can go down 20&#37; bellow line, another day \+40&#37; above so not really a good line, just a dickline :D
The dump yesterday wasn't about sec and when it is above 10k it won't be because of some news.

people took profits

and we are back in action

I heard it’s a rumor too
I also could not find any proper info.
Link?

Beam me up Scotty!
So Buffett was against Bitcoin, and said he didn't see any value in it. And yet, later in the conversation, Buffett admitted to missing out on being an early bird investor on two tech companies: Amazon and Google.  Buffett admitted he didn't understand them as tech companies, so he never bothered investing in them even though he saw the numbers they were doing.  That just tells me he doesn't understand anything about Bitcoin.
Of course he's trying to sway people, he knows his power. He's apart of the system that crypto is trying to beat.
He understands bitcoin (as in the thing you can buy with fiat) well enough. He doesn't understand the blockchain, but bitcoin is not the blockchain.
The omission of the word good from your greeting feels apt 
bonjour :)
Good day.
What time is the meeting ?
[deleted]
> delivering to get BTC as a deserved reward?

Drug Dealer IMO. 


Hi Greg.
That's the only addiction I regret dropping. 
It’s a start.  If you are buying small amounts like that (or any amounts for that matter) a tip to avoid paying fees is to fund your Coinbase account with usd first. Takes about a week for ach transfer. Then move the funds to their sister exchange GDAX.  buy your crypto there with no fees.  😎

Edit:   To get no fees you use limit buy/sell orders.  Not market orders as those have fees. 
Don't worry about user activity getting lower and lower, Just live your life.
when does it start?
When is the meeting ? 
Yes, sell everything you own and buy BTC
Booth. 
Should I stay or should I go ?
Buyyyyy, rally coming :)
[deleted]
?   The dickline has us under 10k
Maybe by Friday night if we’re lucky
Well, no point in looking back. No need to be sad. I know of a stock that I could have bought for literally forty cents which is now at $400 and pays an annual dividend of $50 as well. So. If only 
Why can't he just multiply 10k x 100?

1 mil bitcoins or $1 mil worth of Bitcoins? Big difference.  
Maybe
Don't think that's gonna happen, the price seems to be recovering already slowly.
This isn't even a proper dip tbh.

Welcome to the rodeo tho!

Warren Buffett thinks he knows bitcoin. Here is what he says now about making the wrong call on Google and Amazon. He said, “I made the mistake in not being able to come to a conclusion where I really felt that at the present prices that the prospects were far better than the prices indicated."

He might want to save that quote. He may need it again, once he’s gained 20/20 vision on bitcoin.
I too would be interested in reading more on this. Though...couldn't some of these addresses be from institutions?
bitcoin is a free market, when no one wants to buy at 20k, the price must go down until it finds buyers.

Thats all.
Well, most of you want institutional money, ETFs, NASDAQ, etc, claiming that it will drive up price.

BTC's price is high because of speculation and lack of governance.  Gemini working with NASDAQ is the start.  It will only get worse before it gets better.
The natural conclusion of a parabolic move dragged Bitcoin down. Nothing else. There is no other reason and no  point in looking for one. If something goes parabolic it is going to crash. End of story. 
Hahaha yeah what could two of the richest men on the planet possibly know about finance
Will it be a list? (if they are declared securities).
the sec meeting?!?!? lol

If you knew, did you sell and rebuy after the dip? 
We make higher lows every 6 days at the moment. 
Meh I am not upset haha.
Probably quite a few. I had a few Bitcoin in highschool from some goofing with mining and BTC gambling. 

That was 3 desktops and about 12 hard drives ago... 


About 30%

It doesn't hurt too bad. I know it was less than about $10-15 at the time because I remmeber thinking "Should I get my bitcoin off?" and remembering it would take about an hour to get, but not worth it.
It doesn't hurt that much. It's like not guessing the winning lottery numbers. It doesn't hurt because who would have known?

There were no real exchanges to buy and sell on, and the 100 total was probably less than $10, because I remember thinking "Should I back it up? Nah, it's worth less than the time.
That episode was hilarious 🤣
I would as well but it's a little too sketchy for me getting something shipped to my house. So. Same. 
Sure, if that’s what you’re into. Better than to show up with cash on the corner of a street waiting for a dealer. Governments will never admit it but since you can buy it on the deep web you now have the possibility to buy stuff from the underground market without getting stabbed and to have a better product.
Stay safe.
Well some people us USD for drugs and legal things as well. What are you saying.
So what.  Don't buy then.  Leave the rest of us idiots alone.
It certainly won’t affect my opinion about digital currencies and am definitely not worried.
I believe these men are comparable to those 2 on the balcony of the muppet show, so whatever they say is meaningless to me. Their behaviour nonetheless confirms the animosity they have toward a groundbreaking concept, and are willing to blindly insult anyone considering it’s potential. I do get irritated I must admit to see the same people constantly reappearing all over the news commenting about stuff they don’t and never will understand. Journalism at it’s best...
Thanks for your comment anyway.

Makes sense 
Pretty sure he’s intelligent enough to understand as much as most people. He’s entitled to an opinion just like anyone else
I'm seeing 15:00 GMT﻿ here and there, but I don't know how reliable this info is, sorry. Maybe just keep checking twitter, or here.
he thought it would go down, but then it didn't and now he thinks it will go up
Hey thanks bro good tip! 
Is it possible to move btc from coin base to gdax? I don't want to make the mistake twice
I figured out buying with no fees Limit orders.  Every once and a while still pay fees on sells and the Stop Limits...I'm still a noob
BTC price has always been directly correlated to public interest
3PM GMT 
Now the question is: Would you buy everything I own? Or would you sell me your bitcoins?
Yeahp, you got it!!  :)
What makes you think so?
"Want I buy or want I sell".   That doesn't make much sense.
Being a pessimist. 8.8k this week.
What stock is that?
\+1000 BTC in a single order. So almost 1.000.000$. 
I can imagine. Not like I expected an exponential upward curve and to be a bitcoin billionaire over night. I'm more invested for the technology and the ideology, so whatever happens happens. 😎
Perfect comment. Have a wee upvote.
Buffet is an old fool who hasn’t got a clue about crypto he’s living in the last century
And he won’t be around when crypto takes over not even from he’s nursing home buffet and he’s side kick are like the two old guys from the muppets!!!!!!!
Absolutely. 
Institutions, exchanges, and some no doubt owned by holders who can't access them for whatever reason (lost wallets, deceased, incarcerated), some of which will never be touched. 
However, there are quite a few large balances in wallets held by long time hodlers. I think it would be naive to think someone with a balance of 50,000 coins won't realise their profit at some stage. How many of these people are there? Sure, if these people are well intentioned and are aware of the damage they could cause then it doesn't need to be a problem. Coins can be dripped into the market, or sold OTC. 
But there is still a massive imbalance in the distribution and I can see it being a problem sooner or later. I actually think this issue could be the eventual downfall of Bitcoin and a more fairly distributed coin could replace it as the standard. 
And everybody knows that Buffet didn't invest in most of the biggest Tech companies that currently dominate. 
They know a lot about Gaming the legacy system.  Crypto is a different game - new rules
as far as i read today is just a meeting.  So the market is just going to move based on the sentiment.  Im really optimistic as they've had over two years to make a decision and they've done nothing so far
Thank God. I thought everyone else was raptured.
this guy got a new name, so he could post his address daily
Yeah I understand, life would be easy if we all had the power of hindsight.
"Should I back it up? Nah, it's worth less than the time."

I get this.  I tried to buy some bitcoin when it was around 50 cents.  I spent about an hour trying to figure out how to do it.  Mt GOX was the only way I knew of and i couldn't figure out what I was doing.  So I thought this wasn't worth my time.

I don't feel too bad about it.  Because odds are I would have kept it in Mt GOX, and we know how that ended.
Are you sure your drive never got backed up on anything automatically like time machine or cloud?


And then it would not go up then he thinks it would go down and up and down...
Yeah and it’s free to move it. 
Yeah try not to use market buy/sell unless emergency.  Use no fee limit orders. 
Just keep buying Bitcoin and making more and more scarce by keeping it off the market. And the rest will do its magic. 
Tingly feeling in me balls :) 

Also sma on 30min, 1h and 4h almost 2 be breached and come on were overdue for a big rally

It's a oil marketing company stock in my country 
Normal mate. Nothing strange there. 
That's the perfect way to think about it!
Does that matter? He is still insanely successful financially, his strategy is clearly working.
Bitcoin is not the blockchain.
lol no
I just find it ironical that there are people who thinks that it's different and that they know better.
Dunno why he bothers. That address has only had 2 transaction so obviously it doesn't work. Bit strange, one has to question the motive. Or is it just pure stupidity ? 
Hindsight is 20/20
Yeah, if it was worth that much to me I would have spent the $10 to save 2 hours. At $5 per hour, it's worth my time to just buy again.
I'm 1000% sure.
not likely in 2010
Oh, you brighted my day, thank you! 
arnt you just taking it from someone else? you will need to keep MINING to make it less and less as you said...
That's just plain stupidity.  

BTC's price is 100% speculated and when there's no longer any interest, it will plunge.  This is the problem investing in an asset that generates zero returns.
Damn right. I started my research five days ago into Bitcoin, altcoins and blockchain technology. Pretty much fell in love immediately. This isn't some shitty get rich quick scheme, it's something to change the world.
His fund has been underperforming the S&P 500 index for the last 10 years. His strategy is not working anymore.
Do they have almost 8 bitcoins?
Yep.  
people are doing this and selling to people like me. Creating a Market. 
Every asset is speculation.
Tell that to these people: 

https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=silver+stacking

Bitcoin's price is based on scarcity at the exchanges. 
agreed. at least for bitcoin. as far as i’m concerned, the jury is still out as to what the future holds for altcoins.
No it's 7.704 with 5 zero's in front of it if I read that correctly, so 0.00007704, so about 0.77 cents
Yes, all Im saying is that its the act of mining that reduces the supply, because of the act of buying (ie a transaction needs to take place), So its not the buying that reduces supply although it instigates mining
All these months wasted posting and they could have easily mined those nickels and dimes their self!
