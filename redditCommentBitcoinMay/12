Daily Discussion, May 22, 2018 -- TITLE
Anyone else notice that their daily mood directly correlates with the price of bitcoin?  I think I need a vaca. 
Predictions in this thread are brought to you by the Institute for Rectal Extraction^TM .
God damm fucking bitcoin 
Btc to 10.5k by the end of the year or I'll eat a hotdog 
Bought at 17k AMA
Interesting story. I own a credit card processing company. I accidentally forgot my wallet at home with an empty tank of gas like a moron.

Anyway I went to three different gas stations figuring one of them will have Apple Pay so I could just use my phone. Not a single one of them could do it. Not even one. Think about that. EVERYBODY knows what apple pay is but nobody is using it. I wonder what this says about the eventuality of accepting Bitcoin for a business?


What we should all do is group together and target a business hardcore. Have it so that they get asked by different people all month if they accept Bitcoin. Then after a month of two have a guy offer to set them up to accept Bitcoin. Merchants are not going to Adopt otherwise. 
Going down - good for Bitcoin.
The market is being manipulated by McAfees friends. They just want to see that dick eaten.
[Gapclose](http://up.picr.de/32762666pl.jpg) 

Never think of Bullrun or Crash without looking at the chart from Stockmarket perspective!
Odds are that the second I sell, prices will explode. If you wanna pay me off, feel free and I‚Äôll jump ship. 
This sub has become toxic af. All the speculation is bogus. No one knows where BTC is going. But all this and fuckery is fud-ery is redonkulous. Time to unsub for a while. For those of you with nads I'll see you on the moon. 
Dude, we were on the way to 10 k what in the hell happened? Bears are having a field day -_-
dooomp it..
How long does everybody think the LN will be in Beta? I mean are we still talking years here?
The market's current situation has got me wondering when it will once again cost 10,000BTC for 2 pizzas :'\) I kid of course. HODLers will prevail!
I keep hearing that decentralization is the way to go and that‚Äôs what Blockchain is all about so why then are most if not all exchanges centralized? Is there a DEX up and running? I know several folks are working on them right? Any idea how long until roll out?
can anyone explain to me why bitcoin is extremely unstable?
Inverse head & shoulders on the weekly?

I wanted to enjoy the summer, but after looking at the price movement I feel much more like going into hibernation.
[deleted]
(In july) "Guys the price falling to 4k is good for bitcoin don't even worry how much you've lost."
We've recently had some of the lowest trading volume, and are seeing the price plateauing. This means we're about to see something dramatic. Bitcoin has a rollercoaster-like volatility nature. What's happening is causing tension in its nature, like a spring or rubber band. Bitcoin traders are still there on the sideline, it's the same people with the same habits and the same wildness. The longer they stay idle, the more tension builds in that spring. And when they return, it's gonna be with a bang.

We're about to see either a dramatic rise or a dramatic drop. Historically, Bitcoin has had these stagnant periods right after a crash and a bear market. Typically followed by a very dramatic skyrocketing rise in price when the spring is released.

Like McAfee said, I don't care what the fucking price is whether it's 8k or $8, The motherfucker is going to have 2 commas on it in 2 years.
I'm scared...hold me.
Hi all, not looking too clever at the moment is it!?

:(
Load ze dip
Don't  worry guys, Bitcoin is just trying to get down to pizza levels again.
#Bullish! üêÇ
"it's manipulated"

If you feel manipulated,  look in the mirror,  YOUR greed, naivety,  laziness is what manipulated you.  You and NOBODY else are responsible for any money lost in crypto.



#Run, Bitcoin! Run! üèÉ
where did all the regulars from this daily go ): 
*activate "double bottom"*
under 8k and here we gooooooOo
Can someone give me a link for a webpage from one of the exchanges that has a candlestick plot plus a live view of the order book?  I've seen them here before.
I'm so sick of pizza right now.
I would love to hear someone explain why this sort of long term volatility is anything but extremely damaging to the future prospects of bitcoin.

For example I think a lot more people now know about bitcoin but don't hold any. That is a bad thing as reputation is what movements like this live and die on.

The post December crash when Bitcoin was at the height of it's popularity and subsequent insane volatility is surely doing absolutely no good for it's reputation and thus ability to bring in further adopters.
Buy the dips baby! Time to buy today!
I just bought more Bitcoin. üòÄ
Hodl your dickcoin
down down down 
Can we defend $8k do you think?
well, there goes support
It needs to jump to 10k tomorrow to get back on the dickline
7.7k here we go
Relax, we hit the bottom. Lots of ppl were calling 7800, now that we‚Äôre there all the noobs and nocoiners flood this sub with FUD - that‚Äôs a buy signal. Time to fill those shorts and get us up to the next wave, Ez. 
I know... let‚Äôs all think positively and will bitcoin back up to 10,000.... maybe 11,000 through positive energy.  Stop the negativity brahs and grahs (grah is a female brah).
How much do you think i can mine with my pc? [pic](https://i.imgur.com/rQFdMdT.jpg)
FTSE hit record highs yesterday, how is the American Stock Exchange doing at the moment?
7999 weeeeeeeeee
i love when someone says that im a bitcoin maximalist, but i love more when people says that bitcoin must be ditched because is slow and too old.



Thank you %)
Captain FUD is back!!!
This is the 2nd time; one more after this then people are so scared and exit. Mission accomplished (not my mission tho).

Double touch on 78 this shit is So predictable 
Keep the cool guys, we've come too far to rage quit now. 

I wouldn't put too much value into the sentiment on here, there is some really solid analysis coming out of Concensus this past week, especially from the likes of Carter Thomas and Chris Dunn on the long term outlook. If your not a day trader forget about the micro movements and focus on the long term
Well, just got in and looked at the charts.

Oops!

Well, at least something is finally happening.

And BTC is bearing up extremely well *in comparison* to other coins, which is always a good sign.
Back at the point which we hit after the short squeeze on April 12th. Looks like everything since was just FOMO from people expecting a reversal that didn't happen.
That entire short squeeze happened in a matter of minutes so dont be surprised if we see another massive bart and drop to 6xxx or so in a matter of minutes at some point this week
[deleted]
Only few signals left before we take off.  Bear trend is showing weakness.

Is the Mt. Gox trustee fucking dumping?
jump on the train, we're going up to 10k

I found yall's coin: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/mooncoin/ If you want to moon instantly, haha.
Bitcoin and Dow really took a hit today
I'm happy with prices today made more Bitcoin but lost more Fiat from trading 
Cryptocurrency is a ponzi sheme controlled by very intelligent people that are taking your hard earned money. Blockchain is a legit science... end of story.
Lower.
Is it possible that we could get a crash like we did last year? Bitcoin back to around 2k?
I won‚Äôt be surprised if this drops to 5000 or below.....
[deleted]
I would say the party is over now. Huge dump about to come. We will likely go to the depths of $6000 before this is all said and done. The zombie predictions of $25,000 by year's end is a total pie in the sky pump prediction.  The honest truth is, no one cares about bitcoin anymore.  And, the powers that be will keep it that way to maintain their fiat dream. This is truly an ongoing war for many years to come. Someday Bitcoin will be the currency of choice, but it's not happening for many more years. 
[removed]
Bounced exactly at 8139, May 19 low. There's a massive amount of orders to 8k, but I thought we wouldn't go below 8.4k the last time it looked like that, so I won't open another long position here.
The BTCUSD exchange rate is boring. It doesn't really matter. Let's not talk about it anymore.

Who's with me?
"Let's make this super volitale speculative asset backed by nothing our new currency." -No one ever 
Surely, this is a bear flag isn't it?  The highest peak has been decreasing gradually since January.  Its bound to drop more first week of June then spike up again but nothing above 9k I reckon.  It will be a while for bitcoin to hit 10k again, probably not until end of the year or next year

No, I'm always miserable.

Oh, wait... yes.
yup, quite cheerful today
I've put a pause on buying for the time being. Other things have come up that need my financial attention. I may regret this when Bitcoin moons later on.. whenever that is. 
I know that place! I love coming there.
This makes it sound like a place that extracts rectums
You wouldn't.
Hold yourself back! Don't be too risky!
Me too. Like this guy does

Seems reasonable tbh
Someone draw the hotdog line 
Surely that wasn't Maffee's original vision.

Hey, how about you eat 32 to compensate?
i dont man\- that 10k is a big hurdle
Have you learned your lesson?  :-(
Shit son ! 
all the memes and ramen jokes going around on crypto twitter and reddit can still make me laugh so I guess I'm not rekt enough 
how much?, was a debt?, also buy buy some btc at 18k but with cash.
Do you think you will cash out in time to afford rope?
Have you not bought since to offset 
Another question. Do you know how much does Apple Pay charge to the retailer to use their payment system?
What if, next time, you forget your cellphone at home?
Give me the telegram group chat link or discord server link or whatever you got going on and I'll be a soldier for this cause.
Where do you live? In Canadian cities Apple Pay and tap-to-pay is everywhere. I never need to pull my card out anymore. I have my debit and credit card also many club cards all on my phone. 

And yes, it does cost the merchant more to use tap. But they (think they) have no option
What's Apple pay? I'm European and never heard of it.
Nob business will adopt Bitcoin except people into Bitcoin. Just like Apple Pay. 

And, last time I checked, if you lose your phone, you can't pay with bitcoin or Apple Pay.
Nobody gonna use their bitcoins, people buying it to hold , thinking its going to go up. 
EVERYBODY knows what Apple pay is? Wow, talk about having an insulated mindset:\) So let me have mine now: ONLY Americans use and care about Apple! Think I'm closer to the truth than you:\)
damn what kind of friends does this guy has.
>What did you expect from Bullrun and Crash?
there is no such thing as a gap close in crypto since the market never close
> All the speculation is bogus. No one knows where BTC is going

that's going to be true no matter where you go for discussion
You're better off not participating in something that makes you feel upset
Up on the weekend down during the week tells me what is going on. 
Tested the resistance and failed to push up through. Back to 7k then 9.5k then 8k ....
aaaaaaaaaaaah
load the binance hack
Poooosheet
Development has made huge steps the past 3 months. I doubt it will take longer than a year from now.
Because decentralised exchanges are hard to use for non-techies. We need better ux for one to get traction
Because there is no basis to it's price other than speculated.

It really is that simple and anyone who says this is untrue is just bull shitting.
Because it's too young. Cryptocurrency as a whole is too young to maintain stability. It's seen as primarily a means to acquire more fiat right now. Once it becomes more integrated with consumer level purchasing (ala the lightning network) it will stabilize gradually.
Nobody knows. 
Humans are unstable and are having difficulties adjusting to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is extremely stable since it's creation.
because it consumes a mad amount of energy and thats a problem.
because bitcoin until 2140 is designed to need more and more buyers to keep the price. Isnt like like gold that adapt to buyers or sellers or stocks that have a limited number.

If people stop buying, then price will drop until find a price that buyers can support.


Because it likes to be until it is all grown up (at least 250k+).  üòâ

Welcome to the üé¢ 
Sir, I pronounce your vapid ramblings as hogwash. Away with Yee this very day.
"We're about to see either a dramatic rise or a dramatic drop." 
wow you should really fill in my lottery form... :)
drama
I agree. We're also finishing the last wave of a huge correction pattern. Look in my comment history for a description. (sorry, I'm on the phone atm)

This thing will make a huge blast very soon... üöÄ

Edit: Here is the link: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ky3fx/daily_discussion_monday_may_21_2018/dzbpwj2/
Or we could see total stagnancy. Saying dramatic rise or drop means nothing. It‚Äôs as pointless as saying tomorrow will rise and it drop. Thank for telling me nothing.
Who TF downvotes row row row your boat?  You sir have no soul. 
I know that if Bitcoin dies, it will die alone Jim.
8$.00,000,001 thanks to satoshi lmao
One thousand, two hundred, and five dollars per coin.
*hodl me
I don‚Äôt know why people had their hopes up with volume so low. Way to risky to bet into
I'm pretty relaxed right now. This will only change if we break through 7800. But I very much doubt that we will.

We might even bounce before and create a higher low. That would have to happen right about now...
I read r/darkjokes and r/bitcoin
they are more or less the same :)
**More bullish than a bull in a minotaur costume winning the bull of the year competition**

What an idiotic post. Manipulation is obviously rampant in Bitcoin. Nobody is saying that others are responsible for their losses because of the manipulation. Show me one post where somebody claims this. 
Personally, I've been lurking to raise my levels of inscrutability and mystery.
They all had hoped they'd be up 1000&#37; by now, but once they realized that wasn't going to happen in the near future, they all packed up their memes and left. My reverse Bart formation analysis is that this sub is going to continue to be a relative ghost town until bitcoin is back above 15000.

have you tried one with pineapple?
In a few years from now, when there are more (even institutional) market participants, volatility *will* be much lower.

We are still in the "Wild West" phase. 

When gold was first traded on open markets its volatility was also very high.

https://i.imgur.com/GhBxQv4.png
It happened in 2014 and it didn't stop the last run, why would it stop the next?

Sure, future could surprise us all, but no one buying bitcoin in the first half of 2017 and any of the previous years can complain about volatility. When people look at past performance, they look at the big picture. They will do the same again on the next rise.
No gracias
Great move

Yes, we can!
Not a chance
It's not going below 8k.

We're a bit stuck with 8k+ at the moment.
Look at your name. Can you really call yourself a Bitcoin supporter? Why are you even concerned with the price like this? You are not planning on selling, are you? :)
It‚Äôs 4% lol 
All it has to do tonight is hold 8k and that‚Äôd be bullish af. 
Not much. Maybe .1 bitcoin a week at the most
cc @verge
Those shorts don't magically reappear, neither has there been a spike in longs which would be closed at that point.  
https://datamish.com/d/000000004/btcusd?refresh=20s&orgId=1&from=now-60d&to=now
This guy gets it
Because stability is the only thing stopping average people from using Bitcoin? Not the fact that transactions are much slower and more expensive compared to centralized systems, that they are irreversible, and that in most cases they would have to manage their own private keys which is a massive hassle?
Wished that stable price was a bit higher :)
It's either mass adoption or stability. I don't think that we can have both at the same time.
The highs and lows are getting less extreme, but that doesn't suggest stability. It suggests that there's a massive breakout around the corner.
They said the same in 2015-16 for a while (look, volatility is down, it‚Äôs a sign of its maturity). Then the price exploded again
[deleted]
Your dog telling you rumors now?
I seriously question if this is just fud. Why would the mount gox trustee dump on the open market when he could easily make OTC deals? I've seriously never understood that. Dumping on the market is going to drive the price down especially now when volume has been low and people are somewhat skittish.
ow jesus not that bullshit again
looooooooool 6k by end of the week
DON'T DO IT
Similar slide too, very interesting. Must be a coincidence right? I don't see Bitcoin being affected by international trade talks
This reads like satire
ahh. first comment on reddit. Welcome.
Fed now posts on reddit.
Blockchain without the currency is just a database.
> very intelligent people

ahahahahah
Thank you for the insight, Redditor for a day 
sure its very manipulated just as anything else in life.. you can play along with it as well...
Correct 
I don't think that word means what you think it means.
looool
That was a short story.  C'mon, there but be just a *little* bit more to it than that :)
How's the quality of the blockchain dust you are snorting?
Hi Russia
Are there other words in your vocabulary or is this the only one?
The party is over, smart money is getting out. 
Something about you makes me make the face like I just smelled something bad. Hot garbage maybe 
i bough at 18K... :\( they said it will go to the moon, it will hit 35k....
Yes, it‚Äôll probably hit between $2500-$3500 based on previous parabolic BTC price movements. Oh and I wouldn‚Äôt call it a crash though. 
Well, it won't, Rookie...
I'm keeping quiet because when I say something positive it usually does the opposite.  Maybe I should say we are going to $6k and we will then go to $10k or $12k   :)
I am not a fan of that scenario
Yet you can't even construct a simple argument on why that is.
Great. When every second post on here is like that, it's when I'll know it's time to buy.
The big mistake you make it assuming a high price is important. Stability is more important.
Dude. Get some fresh air..enjoy Life and forget that you invested more than you can afford at ath..or cash out and gtfo. Youre not made for any spekulative Investments.
Don't worry. We will reach the green support line soon. It's going up from there...

https://i.imgur.com/zJKXW90.png
Bitcoin is not going anywhere, the love for bitcoin is just as strong. The lost of credit cards and most banks support destroyed the volume. Simple 
You could like cut and paste this from the past 9 years. Just alter the price a little bit. One of two things is going on here either just a pessimistic person. Highly possible since the internet is full of exactly that. The other one is you're just full of despair. This is exactly how you clean people out of their Holdings. The more people feel like you do the more coins that will get sold and the more people can buy them on sale. You let some time pass maybe a year to 18 months and then when it goes on a run again you will probably buy somewhere near the top and if you don't personally someone just like you will
You forgot the \s

:)
I think there‚Äôs a good chance we will double bounce off 8k for a reversal or at least next wave. That‚Äôs just my 2 satoshis. 
I'm pretty much just buying gradually and hodling for a future fiat blowout at this point. Got my fireproof safe and a cold wallet on the way. Even if the market has a major dip, it will always come back. BTC is the inevitable future of economics.
Shame shame shorter 
you mean cumming ;)
Omg! Lol
It's happening! He's going viral!!!
they never do.... that's why it always works ;)
10k USD. It wasn't more than I could afford to lose, though.
Damn.. ha
Lol, I'm not at pink wojack level yet
Yes. Not as much as I'd like to yet though.
Who forgets their cell phone?...... Or at least doesn't realize it within two blocks from the house. 
I guess you can't pay with Bitcoin either if you leave your phone at home.
ha.ha. lets be positive it either way...
Did you even read my post?

Nearly all investments are speculative by nature. That doesn't mean some information is more or less analytically sound. Ppl running here screaming that the sky is falling with no legitimate rational for why is pretty worthless imo. 
Doesn't really have anything to do with being upset.  It's irrational to pay attention to idiots on the internet trying to predict something I don't believe most of them even understand. I used to come here for news, but there are other, more balanced places to obtain information. 
The network looks great. I am just eager to use this shit. 
So many people don't read all the way to the end. 
I basically said it will skyrocket soon. 
It's your voice :(
üòÜ   But, Bones, bitcoin will never die because we will never abandon her. 
as if people here would look at volume or how the overall trend progresses . 

As soon as the price goes 200$ up the hodler see the moon and the 20 k in a month. 
I do not understand either. The idea is to build false hopes, when there are tools that allow you to earn 2\-3 Btc per month at arbitration.
 New ATH soon!
It's Bullish challenge time: write something more bullish than that, especially for The Independent (*cough*) Newspaper (UK) ...
What the fuck is 'manipulation' ?  It's the exact same thing that happens regularly in every conventional market that trades assets.   When I listed my home for slightly under market in an attempt to spark a bidding war,  I was manipulating the real estate market.

 
Is there a SPECIAL kind of manipulation that happens ONLY to the crypto investor?

NO

It the exact same thing,  except that due to lack of regulation and lack of transparency,  it's easy for regular old manipulation to work on the unsuspecting/naive.

I'm just sick of people using 'manipulation' as an excuse for why their investment is failing them. 

What do you mean by manipulation?
Daddy's back
depends on what you consider regular.
Awesome, thanks!
i have also bought bitcoin today. 
Thanks for my first laugh of the day
Where do you see it going?
Aaand it's gone
ay lmao so much for that
watch it..... :)
Not for long. Bullrun starts soon.
I am 100% a Bitcoin supporter.  I have no plans to sell in the near future.
Well...
No way 
wait really? that's 800 dollars a week (providing it doesn't drop anymore) i'd think it'd be much much less
I forgot to say that i dont plan to mine 24/7. I can leave it mining for around 12 hours.

Everyone getting Goxxed has become part of the DNA of bitcoin. 
Yeah right, in your wildest dreams 
Hit IT Frankie!!!
tottaly uncorrelated. dow didnt take that much of a hit 
I read r/darkjokes and r/bitcoin; they're more or less the same.
Yes, and a centralized one at that. The underlying currency and transaction fees are literally required in order for a blockchain to exist in any meaningful way. 
The sound of one database clapping in the woods, er  ?
There are plenty of other words in my vernacular.
again?
I got out. :D
Good.
how much did you buy?, was a debt?.

18k for now is gone, so let focus on 7/8k, if you buy at this price, when we reach 20k your gains will be around x3. So get some money and buy more, buy every dip-
[deleted]
Lol!  Almost everyone who said "it won't" have been proven wrong :)
Nate is one of our resident trolls. He‚Äôs just trying really hard lately to sound reasonable.  


Hehe. What exactly do you know about my situation? Oh wait, you mean that is your situation you are trying to project onto me?  Sorry the truth hurts. Hang tight. It'll get better in 10 years. 
LMAO, it's like clouds in the sky.  Someone sees a rabbit, another a dog, another person sees a horse, then finally a frog.

For a lot of people drawing their so called, analytical charts, it's as if this is the first burst bubble that's ever happened.  You guys are coming  up with your criss cross graphs, with support lines of last resort, the hopes and fears trembling in your mouse hand, as you cleft those divides.....
what the fuck even is that graph. Im guessing its a joke?
Strong hands.  I do expect dumps. No, I will not guess to what level but those buy orders are going up.  Everyone knows we‚Äôre stalled out right now.  Meanwhile the technology and necessary regulatory issues are being ironed out.  

I‚Äôll wait 
The loss of people buying with money they did not have destroyed it? If that's the case it doesn't deserve to exist.

Then again I think your post is simply fud but that's just me
Did you read my entire post? Clearly not. It's comically obvious that those who claim I am full of desperation, despair, pessimism, and bought at ATH are indeed that themselves. Stating a very sound statement that the price could go down is far healthier than being blindly optimistic in hope of making a quick buck. 
/∆ß ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ) - "Sir I believe this is yours"
i think it will ,because of the positive outlook of the community, we can expect it to bounce back
I'd like to say yes but this is more realistic
The same people who forget their wallet with their driving license and debit card inside. 
yes, did you even read mine?
Software is always in Beta; at least that's what I tell my customers.
Wasn't it Spock I paraphrased?
True.
and kids are crying....when moon when moon when moon
How? 
Pretty bullish.
Headline: "McAfee surprised: 'I never expected the Bitcoin price to rise so fast!'"
Are you really that dense? You do know that there are laws against manipulation when it comes to trading assets be it stocks and bonds, currencies, commodities, or anything else?

Do you know whythose laws even exist? Painting the tape? Front Running? Pump and Dump? Insider Trading? Etc....

It is NOT even remotely the same as pricing a home below market value which is PUBLIC information.


Also I asked you a question you chose to ignore which is the crux of your entire post. Where did somebody claim that they lost money because of this manipulation and take no responsibility for it? Still waiting. 
Time for bed kids.
thank you for all the laugh and all the meme's in this thread. just be positive ha.ha.
Steadily down and staying there until a slight rise at the end of the year back to where we were recently hovering over 9k before eventually breaking 10k and beyond sometime next year. It's going to take a while to get past that hurdle.
again?
Bulls are still fighting to keep it over the 8k line.  Let‚Äôs see what happens. Still higher than the 5/17 low. 
I think OP was being sarcastic as the PC has shit specs. Probably would never successfully mine any Bitcoin.

That's a five year old CPU and integrated GPU. Probably does not even have HDD space to run a node (currently you need about 210 GB)
you will be losing money on electricity. just buy bitcoin, its cheaper for you
That ati 4250 GPU has a killer reputation for mining Bitcoin. You should be able to mine 0,000000000000000000006 BTC a year when you turn it on 12 hours a day!
Like Yahoo search
DO NOT BE DISTRACTED BY THE BEAUTIFUL CELEBRITIES 
And it's far cheaper, faster, more accurate and secure than the centralized alternative. Less friction, lower fees. Crypto gonna be HUGE!
sigh
"when"
Stop dragging more people into debt and losses.
Ffs... this is the third parabolic price movement in Bitcoin history. Looking at the previous two parabolic patterns and current trend lines, do you really think it is wise to advice people to buy more dips? Be real dude... Wait for this bear market to wear out and then start buying your way back up! 
"when we reach 20k", lol
Not sure what regs you are speaking of. Regulation will only help the price in the long run. Plus, the regulations have been positive here in the USA. Plus, wasn't stricter regulations the FUD used during January? That's old news....
Err from where I stand I see more positive regulation, where do you live?
Dude your just posting a wall of emotional bullshit. Think again what youve invested in.  But you rather should get out of this market, your post indicates that youre not able to handle it.
50k within 2 years. 100k within 3 years.  4-5 years 250k+    That‚Äôs my prediction. 
well played
I check my phone every few minutes. I only check my wallet when I need it
Don't slaughter a good idea.
Well you‚Äôre wrong about the current situation being discussed
I Said you have to look at the Chart from stockmarket perspective. You can also click on my link. I never said that crypto has gaps, just that these things happen on the stockmarket and you have to know that before making a dessicion.

Mcafee‚Äôs latest prediction is bitcoin will reach 15k in June 2018.  Not kidding. 
>You do know that there are laws against manipulation when it comes to trading assets be it stocks and bonds, currencies, commodities, or anything else?

Yes,  and it's the lack of those laws in the crypto space that people attribute to 'manipulation'

https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/search?q=manipulation&restrict_sr=on
But papa that's when the Korean FUD is loaded by the Bogdanoff's
I think you might be right.  Do you see us getting over $20k in 2019?
Yes!
Well...
Oh I think bitcoin is dying. I was just interested in this thread
Do you know a real way for calculating it?
Welcome to the party Zoolander!!!
I actually own a legacy electronic payments company and deal mostly in processing credit cards. I cant even begin to explain to you just how complex the system is. Bitcoin wins by a VERY wide margin.

There are serious challenges though. Customers like rewards. Customers like the ability to chargeback. Merchants hate fees, merchants hate that a customer can chargeback. You have to ask yourself which one drives the market? The consumer or the merchant? I honestly do not know and im in the business.
they do really want you to get as many bags as they can sell ya ;)
Your advice is even worse. Buying on the way back up means losing the opportunity when the price was lower. You have to buy the dip.
Tighter regulation = more institutional money = price goes up. Just a matter of when.
 This is exactly how markets get manipulated. If you have a Syndicate of smart people that are well-funded. You can play the emotional decision makers like a fiddle and it's working right now. It's probably the best way to clean the week hands out of holding. Smarter people can then buy up the supply and when the price starts to go up again the same people who were full of despair will start to fomo and buy. 
I'm sorry you feel that way. My post actually was trying to relay my aptitude for holding long as I have been doing for some time. Plus mining daily to boot. Just because a post is negative doesn't mean it's not realistic.  I have no intention of selling, probably forever...
well indeed

he got my vote
It's not a good idea if it does not survive a simple question.
I'm wrong about what exactly?
i clicked on your link , it just shows a gap on a broker platform which closes each friday means nothing as crypto never closes so you cant look at it like stockmarket
Well we've finally sorted that out :)  Great movie IMO.
Thx! 
Bullish!

link?
Literally what causes the manipulation. 
Don't worry, I'll send up Uncle Ver to tuck you in and tell you a nice story about crypto price pumping instead.
No idea that far out
With what volume?
Looks bad short term. If it goes below 7.8k I‚Äôll be selling my my trade stack.  Still hodling 90% because I know it will bounce back eventually. 
Yeah... you cant. You need real mining equipment and a lot of power to mine Bitcoin and make it profitable. Google Antminer.
No its not. After the previous parabolic price runs, btc price retracted between 80%-90% from its ath. In this situation this means you should start buying at around $2500-$3500. You can still buy the dips while doing so as btc price will always be volatile...  PS: your username says enough.
But if institutions want to get in on the crypto market why wouldn't they just mint their own coin instead of buying into Bitcoin? They're trying to make themselves rich, not early Bitcoin adopters. 
Nope.

BTC's price is supported mostly through trades that would be considered illegal when regulation steps in.  E.g., take out Tether and BTC price will collapse.
You‚Äôre replying to someone asking who forgets their phone. You said someone that forgets their wallet. The thread is about OP forgetting his wallet but not his phone. 
ST5 was underrated in my opinion. The scene with Kirk climbing the mountain was one of my favorites 

The music was good too

allows it to happen to an extreme,  to the detriment of the market.

greed and human nature cause one to 'manipulate' the situation to ones advantage. 

laws and regulations exists to make sure no one can unfairly manipulate,  so the strong can't exploit the weak in society.

to think that manipulation is unique to the crypto ecosystem is naive

when someone thinks their investments were unfairly 'manipulated' in crypto markets,  they are fooling themselves.

the crypto markets lack regulation,  allowing extreme manipulation

but it's the fact you invested in an unregulated market that caused your investments to fail, if you need something to blame

end of thesis

"from the future" Looks bad short term. If it goes below 7.6k I‚Äôll be selling my my trade stack.
Well...
You make the assumption that btc will drop that low. Do not say things based on nothing. Following your advice a lot of people will buy back in high.
Because bitcoin has the most secure network. Anyone can make a coin, but to make it resistant to 51% attacks is another thing.
Actually, I'm that kind of guy. The kind that forgets his wallet and his phone at home and doesn't notice when he is well far away from home.

True story.

For the third time. Find me somebody saying they lost money because of the manipulation and not their own choice. You keep attacking your own strawman argument. 
Well what?  I told you the short term looks bad.  My trade stack got stopped out. 
You make the assumption that btc will go that high again. Do not say things based on nothing. Following your advice a lot of people will buy back in high.
I posted it already
Just joking :D
What? You make no sense whatsoever. Following my advice at least you dollar cost average because you took the chance when the price kept going low and bought. Everyone is expecting bitcoin to drop below 6k and for that reason it just won't happen but good luck to you and your great strategy of buying as the price recovers.
Nope you sure didnt. Back to bed young man.
üòù. It‚Äôs so much more fun here when it‚Äôs going up 
eh... yes, I did,  but in case you can't find it,  all I did was search 'manipulation'  in /r/cryptocurrency and posted a link to the results page,  so you can simply recreate that search and see for yourself.

You just cant manage to post anything here to support your narrative. No matter how much its asked of you. Now you want me to search a keyword in another sub to prove your point with no specific example.

This is what is wrong with the world.
I posted more than enough to support my narrative.
