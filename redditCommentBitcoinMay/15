Let the HODLing begin. 
Why isnt meghan wearing a bitcoin wedding dress. Thats the attention we need
Volume very low, what are we thinking is going to happen today?
We're off.

Powering up my orbital Lambo and zipping up my spacesuit.
Anyone have any idea the last time 24 hour volumes were this low?  This is crazy. I guess weve all decided to stop buying or selling.
Sorry for the drop today, guys; that's my fault. I bought more btc.
I think I already know my answer but just want to double check. There's currently no way to receive funds via the lightning network without running a full node correct?
What happened to the volume?
I'm getting my spacesuit on..

:)

Cheer up chaps!
Don't worry, this is a healthy temporary correction. Bitcoin is still on path to be $20K \+ by the end of this year.
What a sad, sick dump fest this past week has been. With all the hype about the future of BTC, the present sure looks grim. 
What is the best resources to get up-to-date news about Bitcoin, its community and developments? (other than the good people of reddit.) I'd like to be able to wake up and read the bitcoin newspaper if you will
How much would Bitcoin be worth now if there were no other coins on the market?
volume on GDAX is saaaaaad, never seen it this low before 
I'm looking for a graph that shows the total amount of BTC miners earned for completing a new block (subsidy + fees). I can only find graphs that output the value in a real world currency (e.g. https://blockchain.info/en/charts/miners-revenue?timespan=30days).
Isn't this relative stability over the last 6 months a better scenario for Bitcoin since it should encourage actually using Bitcoin as as a currency? 
When will get back to 9k?!

What are you predictions for the highest price for the rest of 2018?
There is one bitcoin hidden in the puzzle below.  If you can find it, it is yours!

svijnadlvjnf;jbjibnijnbjnkebkmmlmbk!onebitcoin!ydvlkndfkj
good jump, but volume not rising
Dammit.  Cmon. 8500. LEGO 
Its over
O.K.  Im depressurising my space Lambo and unzipping my space suit.

Maybe next week :)

(and if ANY OTHER mindless, barely literate, poster would like to opine about my precise and accurate spelling and grammar, read a fucking dictionary first - you ignorant tosser.   Love and peace :)
We will see a massive breakout in the next 6 hours (or before).

Just not sure about the direction. Buckle up!

No users= useless technology. Where’s the creativity with innovative user interface wallets. The internet innovation moved faster. Sorry to be downer but it might take 20 years more. Gotta be a realist at this point. Maybe it’s too far ahead of its time that even the younger generation is ready for it. 
Where is best place to buy bitcoin online at?
Fellow redditors as we are the bitcoin community, not much of the percentage. In this thread be careful what you say never let the other person know your next move. Don’t say what you bought in at how much you have or anything to that extent it give people the upper hand. Suck on that! 
I've talked with a handful of people in their 20s this weekend, mentioned bitcoin in passing, every one of them kinda shuddered and said things ranging from "omg Id never get involved with that stuff" to "blockchain is a scam"  SAD 
all those printed tethers eventually have to go somewhere
What could be the factors that would affect the gains/lows of btc for the rest of 3rd and 4th qtr of 2018?
Hey guys, new here and looking for an answer / help \- Just got my Nano S Set up and moving coins off exchanges, etc and I noticed that my BTC balance on my Ledger Wallet App on desktop has a $500\+ more than what my apps track it as... Curious to know why my Ledger Wallet says I have $500 more BTC. 

Thanks for the help. 
I thought yall said moon! Now I’m losing all my damn money. Fuck bitcoin and fuck the moon.
I’ve got a very important question!

I’m from Pakistan, but currently living in the UK. I want to buy bitcoins from my pakistani bank account from the exchanges that support pakistani banks. However, I’m already registered to many exchanges with my UK as my current country.

I would like to know if it is still possible to buy from my pakistani accounts from those already registered exchanges. If so, would I be charged the conversion fees to usd as well?

Is there any alternative to this to save fees?

I’m trying to avoid the high banking fees that incur while transferring money internationally.

Thank you
Still narrowing in a wedge/triangle. I honestly thought it was a breakout a couple of weeks ago.  Although there is no criteria other than what it looks like, the year long chart is a classic monster wedge. If so, volume will continue to drop and highs and lows will continue to narrow. A breakout can be declared at a price greater than $20k or lower than $6k. It will hit one or the other but not both.
She's sponsored by Ver.  The wedding coach has Bcash tags all over it.
Well..  thousands of people will die.  There will be turmoil and violence in half the World's nations.  And

There will be a royal wedding in Windsor UK.  Ahhhh!

And a Royal knob will make its way up a newly royal lady.  Ahhh!
In a few hours - takes time to pressurise etc.  :)
usually a sign before a massive breakout to either side
This is the lowest I have seen in the last 7 or so months.
What’s wild is there is more marketing, and advertising for it but NOBODY I talk to know literally anything about it.  Of course I tell them lol
If you bought then it would have gone up.
yep  
edit: although perhaps there are some custodial services that I'm not aware of at the moment
Was just coming to post the same thing.  I don’t think I’ve ever seen it this low 
If 20k was a certainty, the price would not be 8000. 
Dont worry guys bitconnect is going to be 50k by January 2019. 
When do you think it will go above $10k?
like all your previous predictions, this one is wrong too.
Look who's back!
No adoption/users= a pointless technology. 
cryptoyum is a good reader and I like the devs.
The total market capitalization of all coins is $378.980.099.757.

There have been about 17.000.000 Bitcoins mined, so far.

That would make about $22293 per Bitcoin.

Of course there are many other factors at play. What I did here is just a numbers game.
Take total maket cap of all coins and divide by present number of Bitcoin would be my guess.  However more coins did help with interest in crypto.
Altcoins add significant value to bitcoin. One of the use values of BTC is that you can use it to invest in other virtual currencies. I believe without them its vakue would either be the same or lower.
over 100k
What do you think it means? Price too low or too high?
i blame royal wedding.


4066 BTC 24 hour volume is the lowest I've seen. 
Everything that’s happening is a good scenario for BTC. 
Yes, but but the stability seems to be due to low volume of trading rather than BTC being any more robust. 
\~100k year 2020 :\)
1 BTC.
1 Doge🐕
30k if regulations kick in, and institutional money starts pouring in. 
4k
18k
That's very generous. Hope someone figures it out!
> svijnadlvjnf;jbjibnijnbjnkebkmmlmbk!**onebitcoin**!ydvlkndfkj

Found it. Can you pay me on PayPal? ;)
I found 2 bitcoin, 253 lite coin, 1 Doge, and 4 Charizards
Whos over?
Not so fast. We might be forming an inverse h&s. This could break out any time...
It might rain. But it could just be cloudy ?  
That picture is crystal clear!
goes down to 8k bounce to 8.1k
then 7.9k after which it heads for the moon!
I could be off of course. (just a little)
Exodus.io
To avoid any fees:  Open account with coinbase and get verified.  Ach transfer money from your bank account to there (takes about a week).  Then log into gdax using your coinbase login (affiliated with coinbase) and place a limit buy order (no fees).  If you do a market buy instead, there are fees. 

If you don’t want to wait a week then you can just buy on coinbase right away and pay fees.  Gemini is another option. 
ignore accounts that just appeared during the spike.
Eh?

Crikey, that is some butterfly effect paranoia you've developed there :)
Must have all been very unintelligent people 
Millennial reporting in. bitcoin rocks!
Well that handful of people def proves bitcoin is shit I guess. /s
How many did you buy?
Clarity in regulation, institutional money coming in (or not).
Lightning Network: first consumer uses, publicity.

Atomic swaps.
Your wallet only contains crypto - that is the absolute value.

If the fiat (e.g. dollar value) is displayed in the wallet, that is really just supposed to be helpful, and a current price based on one or more exchanges.
It won’t stay above your cost basis initially.  Too much volatility, and there’s no way to guess which way it will go.  Eventually though, there will be a time when the price never goes below the price you bought at.  That is, unless you sell for a loss.
Don't take investment advice from people on reddit.
You only lose money if you sell now. Bitcoin will be up in the long term.
start by trying to make small purchases with your account Pakistan, and check if it goes well
Some people say the only reason the Royal Family are happy to accept Meghan into the family is because Harry is not part of the actual Royal blood line, he was the son of Diana and James Hewitt. 
wedding days are stessful enough, may not be any royal slogging tonight. maybe in the morning.
spot on my man
I think it's spelled pressurice.  Anyways, I got my seat belt on.
Definitely a very unsettling calm before the storm. 
Is it though? To me it's just a sign that interest is low. I also notice that there has been a huge decline in articles about crypto in the big papers here in Norway, for example. Crypto is just boring atm, but I'm still pretty sure that we are in an early phase. Think it'll be a boring summer and we'll hopefully see a similar rise as last year.

Sorry for my English. 
In my case I'm simply broke as shit.
DIRKA DURRR
If it was a certainty, the price would be $20k
Still a long way to go before the end of 2018.
When is Coinbase Custody open for business? 
thanks
Yep, I think it could be that much.  
Yes.
30k? lololololololol.... it's at 8k now, so another 22k in 6 months. so about 3.75k per month, or about 1k per week
.... good luck out there.
I’ll raise you to 35k under those conditions 
Sure.  Send me your private key :)
Not so clear to me. But nice to know that you've got it all figured out.
Ok i'll check it out. Cheers.
seems like a complicated way to use a currency.
another. agreed. 
Of course it doesn't... but if that's the prevailing attitude among a majority of young people that will be a major barrier to mass adoption. Need to find ways of making the whole thing less scary for n00bs
so many
Totally agree. Pretty sure this will drive much of what we see in the coming months. Disappointed we didn't hear much about regulatory direction at consensus. 
Ok thanks for the clarification. I have been reading things online this am trying to reset my wallet or update it firmware I guess - IDK - but was concerned. $500 does seem like a bit much of a difference from EX to EX doesn't it? I guess this is why regulation is needed??? Still trying to learn all this. Much appreciated!!! 
I’m hodling.
Isn’t that itself investment advice?!
there all small coiners peoples here with bullshit advice, crying out when moon when moon
look out for the FUD comments. sounds advice is frowned upon in these parts.
Or you know... not
Well.  He's a very fine and honourable man.  

As a soldier he was, and is, loved by his troops.   There is no better commendation.

And she is pretty as hell.

So good luck to them  :)
I've been watching it.  Very impressed.  Harry is probably our best Royal.  She seems absolutely charming.


*pressurize*

Thx Elon.

z in USA, s in UK.  Never c.
from my experience it is not because the interest is low. ive seen this many times , usually before breakout up or down no one knows
Not sure.
you have 10 million laying around? wow. must be nice.
How long have you been in crypto? Bitcoin was under $1000 in January 17'. Some alts like strat (99mil supply) went from $.07 to $36, Verge went from like $.00001 to $.30. Bitcoin moving $3000 a month isn't  impossible. 
Look at december.
remember not to invest more than you can afford to lose.  Don’t listen to the bears 🐻.  Be prepared to hold through the ups and downs of the market for the long term.  Bitcoin is not a safe short term investment  
It sounds worse than it is. It's really a simple process that takes a matter of minutes once you get the hang of it.
How would you open a regular bank account? Nobrainers
It is complicated, but that's the way USD works, unfortunately. The good news is you only have to do it a few times, then you're all set to use BTC!
Who said anything about the majority? You have a tiny sample size.
All that really matters is that your wallet accurately displays the number of coins it should contain.

If it doesn't, then that is a matter for concern.

DO use a decent wallet.  online is fine, as long as your holdings aren't huge.  Use 2 factor etc.
good man.
I think that's advice advice
I wish them the best too  :)
she is gorgious. he is, interesting to look at. he definitely out kicked his coverage.
In Asia definitely with a C.
Well, at some point it needs to go up or down with this low volume. It just feels like regular people are careful with their money atm and that it's bots buying/selling. Then someone with a lot of money dumps or pumps the price. The pumps/dumps are so sudden that it can't be organic imo. But then again, I don't know shit. 
You make a good point and I hope you are right 

We all will, once it starts raining lambos.
alts are trash for trading and getting more btc if you are lucky enough to not loose your ass.
and? look at january... you are saying that december (a total anomaly) is going to be the norm. holy crap, biggest lol this morning. better put all your chips in now, if you believe that. good luck our there.
The first two times I bought bitcoin it dropped like crazy but always goes up higher. Now is no exception
What do i have to do for verification on coinbase?

Do i need photo ID? cause i don't have any.
cause this is totally the same thing. lol. come on
why would I need to jump through hoops to use money I can already use without jumping through hoops. and pay fees on top of that? no way. i haven't paid a bank any fees in over a decade, don't plan on doing it now.
Yeah the coin amount is correct but it's USD amount that is $500 off.. Oh well...  I am using the Google Chrome Wallet app with Nano S - Not sure if there was 2FA on - will have to check - again I'm new and still learning. Thanks again for the help and taking the time to comment back!!! Happy weekend!!! 
Advice about investment advice
Awwwww :)
Well it fucking helps your opportunities if you're the queen's grandson - and I don't mean Freddy Mercury  :)
It's USAz, UKs, and ASIAc
No, moron. December is an example of the price going up more than 1k per week. More than 1k a day even. It will probably happen again. Then there will be a correction again.
Yes. Fotoid. Passport or drivers license
... “to use money I can already use”....

 Bitcoin != fiat mate. 

That was is a good way to do things. It’s the same process as opening a bank account. You need to first fund your account which will take some time but once you get into coinbase, I would suggest going through GDAX to buy or sell using limit orders. I generate day trading profits through GDAX using limit orders and then transfer those profits over to a coinbase wallet and have that wallet hooked up to a debit card I can use anywhere.... essentially buying things with bitcoin.
Do you use credit cards to purchase things?  Guess what, they charge your merchant fees every time.    You think the merchant doesn’t pass those extra fees onto the customers through higher prices?  Of course they do.  It used to be obvious when buying gas.  Now many have same price cash/credit advertising. Doesn’t matter since everyone pays more. Cash users end up subsidizing credit users.    

Crypto fees will become more and more competitive with credit card fees and as more people switch to paying with crypto, prices of goods  will adjust downwards accordingly.  Merchants may even offer discounts initially for crypto users.   Bright future ahead boys. 
As long as the coin amount is ok, that's fine.

If you hold some alt / shitcoins - be aware that in many cases no-one actually knows the value of them  :)

Good luck.

If you're using a nano, prob no need for 2 factor, as your private key is stored on the nano.

Make sure you have the recovery seed written down somewhere.
Cheers
Whatever it is don't listen to it
Death to the royal family <3
well of course. how does divorce work in this case?
HOW CAN IT BE C IN ASIA?  FFS  ?   :)

As an expert English speaker and published writer, I wrote, quite correctly, 'pressurise'.  In the USA, where English is also the official language, it is spelt with a 'z'.

How can it be spelt with a c in some **other** language - that is just misspelling an English word.  FFS!!!

Literally lost for words.
so then why look at December, if there will be a correction like you said?
not at all... btc is far from = fiat.
Wait what? Explain more about the debit thing at the end pls.
yes, and get points year around, then use those to take free vacations. bitcoin doing that? and yes I understand that fees are built in. you think they will lower costs just for crypto? no, they will just make more money off you. they may even charge you more, because of volitility. keep thinking that all sellers are looking out for your bottom line, they aren't. adjust downwards accordingly, that's a pipe dream.
Yes, it came with these cards ya know and I wrote them down on there. Making a copy and taking to the bank to put in safe deposit box. Hard to know what's a shit coin and what's not. That's where I am at now. I have dabbled around a little bit but am looking to plunk down some serious ( for me ) $ in this and want to do my due diligence. So much hype and FUD it's hard to sift threw it all.  
Don't be horrible
Just like any other, except MI5 bumps you off (only kidding!)
!= not equal
You are not really getting those points for free.  Nothing is free. You are paying for them in higher prices overall on goods and services. 
They will have to adjust downwards to remain competitive with the next guy who accepts crypto.      In the future as adoption increases the volatility will decrease and become almost nonexistent 
Bcash is a shitcoin, many others are up to debate and speculation
[deleted]
Their execution could only be a great blessing to humanity. <3
and so is everyone else. but I'm getting free hotels and airfare. what's your point?
keep believing that they will just drop prices for the consumers sake. good luck out there.
[removed]
Easy for you to say that, sitting in front of your computer in your underpants in your bedroom, watching conspiracy videos on Youtube and scratching your arse at your Mum's house, waiting for her to bring you another sandwich and cola to feed your fat inactive face.
Not for the consumers’ sake, for their (merchant) sake.  If the next guy is charging less to attract customers using crypto he’ll get more customers.  Merchant wins. Customer wins.  The merchant that doesn’t adapt loses.  The transaction fees for some crypto right now are almost 0.   Hopefully they’ll figure out how to get bitcoin fees that low, or we’ll probably be using an altcoin for buying coffee. 
Lol if only that were true, I would be happy.
