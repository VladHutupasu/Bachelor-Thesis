Silence of the lambos
BTC, I trust.

HODL, I must.
$15k by the end of June according to McAfee.
Wallets need to step up big time and use SEGWIT and better user interfaces. The Steve Jobs view of simplicity is true. Make it so easy, they have to use it. 
Gravity sucks. But is necessary. I've worked with stocks for decades. Nothing to see here. 
I sold some last night and it didn't go up.
I think the most damaging thing about the price manipulation is that people will lose faith in crypto.
Rate my TA 😂

Bitcoin is better than what's on TV
Don't worry we are still heading up.
Get ready for this weekend!
Not everyone can own a full bitcoin, get them while they last. 😃
Do we need to move coins off GDAX before coinbase pro?
Bitcoin is freedom. Fight for her. 
This sub is more than dead right now. I miss all those memes. Come on, let's have some fun at least.
Wen Bart?
Friday pump? .. no?
Does anyone think that there wasn't a pump in Bitcoin after consensus because those on the inside knew the DOJ was going to start a criminal investigation?
Cryptically bored
is a whale someone with 10,000+ btc?
Kinda hoping that prices stay for a bit so I can buy more with the starting bonus from my new job. Would be pretty cool to own 1 whole coin. 

Bounce.
Houston, we have liftoff!
Get your green dick paint ready.

Damn, run out, only enough to paint my left ball.

Luckily I have only one left ball.
**No Pain!, No Gain!**
looking at the charts today and ive noticed that all alt coins are up 5&#37;\+ while bitcoin is up 1&#37;  


this doesnt make sense to me, can anyone explain?

normally i see bitcoin gos up and alts follow
bull bears bull bears bull bears bull bears bull bears bull bears bull bears  tired of this shit!
I invested in these alt coins i suggest everyone get them as soon as possible. Buttcoin, Crapcoin,   shitcoin, saggytitcoin, dickcoin, and last but not least openwidebuttholesowecanfuckyounolubecoin
I'm still waiting for that 3k pump
BTC price goes up for utterly no reason, and it goes down for utterly no reason. Folks, it is far too easy to short the pumps and cover the dumps; free money.
bought at 18k2 by all the money i have...because they said to the moon. they said lambo. they said bitcoin will hit 1M$ or McAffee eats his dick.... and now, falldown from 20k to 7k....
By the way.... the general public doesn’t concern me nearly as much as corporations and big business adoption.  Joe smith who invests .2 BTC is very popular. But eBay, Starbucks, and McDonald’s adoption is far more substantial. And as technology grows to meet the needs of those entities...  you take your guess at the value 
I can't wait to see some fresh HQ gifs when the new 15-20K. 
The general public is losing interest in bitcoin, you can see it in the google search trends and popular crypto sites dropped in alexa ratings. 

Edit:
View alexa rankings here:
[Bitfinex](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/bitfinex.com), [Coinbase](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/coinbase.com), [Binance](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/binance.com), [bitcoin.org](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/bitcoin.org), [coinmarketcap](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/coinmarketcap.com), [Blockchain.info](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/blockchain.info), 
how worried are you guys about this tether situation with bitfinex. i'm not sure if it's just rumors or guessing or even what the difference is between those two words but the chatter about regulators looking into things then the possibility they are playing bitfinex-fed2.0 printing their own tether without the same amount of usd to back it up. this makes tether a bitcoin funnel and mtgox 2.0 a possibility if the worst theories are true {not a fud comment. general curiosity} 
I got to the bottom comment in less than 10 minutes..... ;( 
Guess a whale got tired of seeing stable prices
Onward and upward!..winkleboss
John McAfee urges us to free ourselves:

Now is the moment. 

*The next few minutes are critical!*
Buy buy shorts, cover quick.
to da moon
Haha buttcoin 
First? I guess so...
Weekend sale. Time to buy.
We need Soros to start pumping bitcoin again
Small pennant forming, with low volume.  It's often a sign of overall continuation.  "Down periscope."
 In need of some info from the community 📷  
Hey guys, sorry to barge in like this, but I would just need a few minutes of your time. I'm doing a bit of research with my friend about an idea we have, and I would be immensely grateful if you could fill out this little survey for me?  


Thank you everyone in advance!  


Here is the link: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1q9foXhQPd\-a\_FNpFGuO62Xa8i1l2pIofmjHWuj5tMrM/edit](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1q9foXhQPd-a_FNpFGuO62Xa8i1l2pIofmjHWuj5tMrM/edit) 
i wonder what the price of bitcoin will be going into the weekend
5/29 coinbase maintenance for one hour 8PT
On a slightly unrelated note:

Short skirt or high heels to start expressing my feminine side?
last chance to buy under 8k!!!!! lol 
tell me more about what you predict ravencoin will do? 
Is Bitcoin dead yet or nah? 
[removed]
Bart incomplete.... BULLISH!!!
Is today a good day for growth?
Another weak try, bart pattern today evening
Whoa - that's gone as flat at my girlfriend's tits.

(as I amusingly say to her 'you could land a fucking aircraft on your chest' - that's why she loves me - sense of humor.)
Sell now buy later noob! 
Gains, you lust
Im sick of these kind of predictions. Same for tom lee. So annoying.
He prolly actually hopes for 12k at max
John McAfee is a psycho egotistical conman
I agree with you but actually think you're going to see companies like coinbase bring this to Market before wallets. Coinbase is looking into a banking license and if they do that it means debit cards. If you think really big picture it might even mean something like allowing businesses to take any of the cryptocurrencies they have and either keep that payment in cryptocurrency or immediately transfer it to USD.
You must have been really good and that's why you stopped, right? 
Still working?..
I thought gravity pulls?
Returning to the mean....
It *will* soon...
And when all faith is lost, the price makes a reversal, leaving the ones who lost faith, with nothing but defeat.
Yup, i believe in crypto, but whats going on \(not meaning just few days...\) is really bad, people loose faith thats it.
Reminds me of a particle accelerator collision: https://www.popsci.com/sites/popsci.com/files/styles/1000_1x_/public/import/2013/images/2010/06/650px-Higgs-boson.jpg?itok=IMjC3hS2
Thank you for your graph! I think it makes it crystal clear that, as you say, they're critical.

I can see us break up above $7.7k, giving bulls some moderate gains, and setting us in a good path to start the weekend from a solid position that could grow even further (unless it's a bull trap that bounces back down before most traders, especially those without robust TA, can realize their gains).

However, looking at the RSI and MACD, there's also the danger that we could retrace back down under current support levels to below $6.9k or even further down (even crashing under the next Fibonacci support level), with the bears burning the moderate sell walls around the $7k price point, in which case we'll be at a worse position than right now and I'd then posit it'd be wise of savvy traders to revisit the different scenarios.
I really like the yellow lasers, nicer than blue ones.  Lower energy of course, but they make space combat so much prettier.

Cdr Teabag a.k.a BcashBtrash
21 BTC club is the goal!
Sure I'll buy them at $6800 per pop.
Bitcoin is a token speculated on exchanges for profit.  

Let's stop being hypocrites to call it otherwise.
Agreed, but Brasil is our friend. 
It's not dead...

The memes will return when the price moves..
**BART'D!!**
no, consensus was a money grab. $2K tickets, fiat only. can't get that $$ back. well done boys.
no
It is a huge fish that breathes nitrogen instead of water.
Nope
Nope
Maybe someone is trying to free us. 
Suggested intermediary meme: https://youtu.be/9SE222v1eyM?t=85
Because alts also dropped harder.
Tether redistrabution
Don't worry about alts - most are wanky and strange and shite in the medium to long term.

Buying a shitcoin is like promising the ugliest girl in the bar that you will marry her, so you can get a shag that night.  There is no serious intent in the transaction.

Alts go up purely for gambling reasons, and down just as rapidly for the same reason.
Maybe we are starting to see the decoupling of bitcoin-alts.

Bitcoin finally found right price (as suggested 2 months ago to be 7-8k) Others still havent found it and they are conected by spring system, so every disturbance in bitcoin price, other will be multiplyed.
**Plot twist:** They're the same!
I prefer Buttplugcoin XL blockchain

One year ago today Bitcoin was around 2.5k.  For it to fall down 3k and to hold around 4k\-5k is more likely. That would be about a 100&#37; increase from last year and Bitcoin would still be moving in the right direction.
Yes.  But don't announce it here ..... 

This forum is filled with hodlers who don't like the fact that other people are making solid profits while they wait for their moon.
Easy until you get burned. Easy as $1000 on black at a casino. 
Oh man. I always wondered what I would ask if I ever met the richest man in the world. How about telling us what trades you made and how you knew? 
Don't waste time posting here genius - get back to your amazing money-making plan based on random short-term price changes.


I think McAffee needs to be uninstalled from the discourse
I bought at 17400,  I have down cost averaged on these numerous dips.   I'll be in the green at $11250.  Hang in there  for 4 years,  it'll all work out. 
you listened to idiots trying to get rich quick. comes with the territory.
McAfee now says $15k in June so we will soon see.
'They' 
> ...because they said to the moon. 

Who is "they"? And why do you listen to them? Learn how to invest, use the DCA strategy (proven to be the smartest) and Hodl long term.

Bubbles burst like the bs that get spread
It's your fault for listening.
If you really did that then I'm very glad, because nobody this stupid deserves to have money.
Better set your clock to December 2017 then 😂
>The general public is losing interest in bitcoin

Good.  No problem.

So now the technology will win; not the hype.

Anyone buying into BTC for short-term gains is taking a huge risk.

Buy into what you believe in.
and from the low volume lately
Google trends said +18% last week 
Typical response with no dog in the fight.
We're still here :*
Two whale pumps and it’s “ohh my gaawwddd!!!!  We gotta jump in”.  Cmon. Everyone knows that 
The 'general public' know jack-shit about crypto.  

In fact, with an average IQ of a worrying, but definitional, 100, the public are rather jack-shitless generally.

Your 'general public' pumped the price to an unsustainable level in a state of pure ignorance at the end of 2017 - but more importantly, at an unsustainable rate.

Hold on to your crypto - but for heaven's sake - hold onto something with potential value.

No shitcoins.

In order for this to mean anything you need a nine-year history. I would bet pretty heavily that the search traffic went up one hell of a lot in 2013. Then it probably fell off a cliff and started going up again sometime late 2016. Then it continued to go up and started to decline around January of 2018. I wonder why that might be?
Yeah because even when I know everything about crypto's I still keep entering bitcoin in Google. Get real, everyone knows what bitcoins are nowadays. Theres no need to Google anymore.
Scandals lower the prices, that's good for cryptos lol
I stopped worrying in 1944.  Which is kind of strange, as I hadn't been born.
Let's say you have been buying and selling apples for $10 each and believe that's the price everyone else is buying/selling.

One fine morning, the whole world discovers that a huge group of people have been actually paying only 50 cents for a very long time.  

Do you still think you can sell your apple for $5 to the next buyer?

Noone knows if tether is backed by usd but it doesnt keep me busy. Not much we can do about it anyway.
Personally, I 'slave labored' to buy his spamware antivirus back in the day, that put more dollars in his pocket, fucked up my computer and could only be uninstalled with a gallon of petrol and a sledgehammer to the hard drive.

McAffee and Ver should really get together and have a love child.  They could call it Craig.
P.S.: he wears glasses, that's also a successful slavery tool widely used.

Haha HAHA_ButtCoin
Who cares.... I wonder what the technology is becoming. We need to make it easy to use and no fees while staying decentralized. 


p.s.  Real news: 

Jihan Wu https://twitter.com/JihanWu/status/1000052724954578944

Wu feels the need to forcefully deny claims his BCash shitcoin miners were behind the 51% attack on fellow shitcoin Bitcoin Gold.

Next week: Maybe 51% attack on BCash - how will you shill that Roger?
1 more wave to 6800 before we moon, so close!
beep beep beep beep
I'm thinking it's going to go the way of no longer exist coin in a few years. If that. Isn't the whole idea behind these pump coins just a method to acquire more Bitcoin?
It's not a ponzi scheme. No one promised everyone would make money 100% guaranteed. If you invested in Bitcoin BECAUSE someone absolutely guaranteed you profit and you did no research. Then that's on you, and maybe the person who lied to you. The technology is not to blame for any bad decisions you or your loved ones may have made in ignorance.

Unless you haven't invested and/or lost, in which case, why so salty? 
Is this our indicator that despair has set in?
Someone lost money^
Lol how much u lost bro
Still bearish on charts
Your sense of humor is lacking
My savings, to dust
McAfee, we trust.
Lost
Especially when they keep getting them wrong.
I sorta laugh because everyone takes these predictions seriously but scoff at randoms in this thread making sorter term predictions 
Don't forget: neighbor-murderer.
where did he say he stopped?

Lol
Never stopped. I hold. And like everything, they go up, they go down. Then up and so on and so on.
Lol, not negative pressure suck, just stuff falling sucks... 
treu, and defeat will impact the way people communicate about crypto to their surroundings and will definitely have an impact on the adoption rate.
It is impossible to lose faith in something you truly believe in. If you lose faith you are not a true believer. 
Bitcoin has gone **nuclear**!
This sounds like every analysis on every crypto news site ever. 'Could go up, could go down.'
BTW, the curved yellow laser is the *dickline*.

https://dickline.info/
You probably right. 
Your perception of Bitcoin is not other people's perception of what Bitcoin is. Stop forcing your views onto others.
Wow, that's an oldie!
yeah obviously a money grab. But considering the pump from last years event youd think there would be another one this year. but instead a week later we get a DOJ investigation. just seems odd to me. Obviously conspiracy but worse has gone on behind closed doors

some of you people are way too optimistic. you'll say anything to convince yourself bitcoin is going up!
Its tested 6600, 7000, 7300, 6500, numerous times this year. See a pattern? 

That's the new low.
Thanks! And be sure to let me know when BTC gets back into 19,000 territory.
Where does he say that?
use DCA?!?!? the term was only created to instill confidence in buyers that are buying dying assets. holding long term when you are supposed to be using it to create confidence does nothing for btc. all you are doing is holding bags.
I'll believe it when the exchanges start taking back top spots for web traffic. Until then its dead in the water
Cherry picking doesn't change the trend. Bitcoin is up 25% from its low, doesn't change the fact its down 50% from peak
Just pointing out the obvious, do with that information what you will
As George Carlin says... "think how stupid the average person is, and half the people are dumber then that."

I can't tell if you're serious or if you're trolling.  Well done.
Hold on to your unabashed, unwarranted confidence
Without popularity it'll drop like a rock
you may think they’re idiots, but bitcoin and crypto as a whole needs those idiots to get to the point the people in this sub are expecting it to 
Because people start losing interest when there is no money to be made. Simple as that
Crypto sites are dropping in alexa ratings.. bitcoin.org took a complete nosedive in rankings along with all the exchange sites and crypto news sites. Less traffic = less interest = drop in bitcoin price.
Bitcoooooonect. That was definitely a scandal. I don't know why that didn't pop in my mind yesterday. That particular place most likely had a huge impact with all of their shenanigans
Lol point taken though. I've spent the past 3 hours doing research on this and I see why some of the old-timers kind of blow it off. this has literally been going on for over 5 years. Maybe something will happen. Maybe it won't. In fact the odds are it probably won't because bitfinex has had ample time to get everything straight so it's not at all a direct correlation to mount gox which had major problems the first of which was mismanagement. 
As in a two-to-one [or less] tether ratio? If so it's fraud . The whole idea behind that was a direct one-to-one correlation .I just wonder where the evidence for any of this is? Some people who apparently don't comment and don't want to make their opinions known feel that everything is fine? This is probably the most bizarre reaction I have gotten to a comment in this entire subreddit. I mean the most peculiar part is the fact they keep pushing away auditors. If that were to happen on a regulated Bank the stock would be dropping well... a lot. Now I realize bitfinex is only one exchange but it is a very large part of the market. Remind me again why you guys don't want them audited?
The last evidence I can find of an actual audit was in September. It really is starting to make sense why some of the Doom and Gloom crowd is saying Bitcoin 4000 because really that's the worst case scenario. It's a technical repeat of 2014 and at the same time it's when the last audit of tether was actually done. On that last part it seems a little crazy unless they just went to town printing it because more people are involved in crypto now then there were in September of 2017. It does however help me understand the bearish argument a little. Then again I'm not sure how many of these bears actually realize  all of this
Moon straight to 4k!
It's relates to Rover Ver and his gang or what. Any news from ver side, when the next pump will happen and I will dump all my digital gold . 
All his shit lol 
Still bearish on charts.... BULLISH!
She doesn't land him HA HA HA
Rammstein, du hast
You may go bust
I don't take any crypto guru seriously, on the opposite
Well, not everyone can win.
*"Congratulations boys and girls, we are now considered a nuclear threat."*
That dick must have some serious mass to curve a light beam like that.
Oh?  

So saying that "Bitcoin is freedom" is not trying to force a view?
I wouldn't take anything off the table. it really looks like the wild west out there. I trust it less today then I did 2 years ago.
That's why they get stranded on beaches.  

You need flip flops - not thousands of microscopic legs - to walk on sand.

That is SCIENCE you know.
Free Willy!
People should just go to tradingview -> BTCUSD symbol and read what market expert analysis. Everyone is saying it's going sub $7k before we hit $8k again.
This is what a passive investor may think lmao
> Where does he say that?

https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/999004273794002944
You said Google trends shows a decrease in interest and it doesn't. That's not cherry picking, that's just stating facts. 
As Frank Zappa once said:

Hydrogen is thought to be the most abundant substance in the universe,  I say it's stupidity


I love that statement 
Then what?
I shall.
The people in this sub *are* those idiots.
If we truly thought there was no money to be made. I mean truly. No one would be here. There were a lot of get rich quick schemes. Bitcooooonect.  You also had the market on the right side of the moving averages all of 2017. Technically the market looks absolutely terrible right now. When that flattens out and we eventually get an uptrend to begin the traffic will pick right back up
I think it's more of a lagging indicator. Like I said in the other comment about this internet search traffic most likely follows price pretty closely. When the market is in an uptrend and exploding you have everyone searching for it. When it's in a bear market like it currently is you have very little interest. New people are brought into the space because they think about making money. Some of them only care about that and some of them really get into the technology and probably are the ones that stick around for quite a while and actually make some money
Their time is almost up.

https://modernconsensus.com/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin/bitfinex-tether-investigation/

Most of the people here are in denial.

Anyway, it's a matter of time before bitfinex/Tether is publicly exposed and that will be the trigger for a full crash.
Still nowhere near the amounts of printed usd :) I rather hold btc than usd.
Still on the charts.... BULLISH-ish!!!!
Your girlfriend lands me.  

When she sees you and looks a bit sweaty - that was me!

Sorry  :)

This joke you forced it, with thrust
Exactly that mcafee is a loon 
Maybe that will get the koreans attention
No. He is just expressing his view of what Bitcoin is to him. There's is no binary right or wrong answer to what Bitcoin is. It is up to each individual to consider what Bitcoin is for themselves.
I'm not trying to force a view, but I have a deep desire to suggest, educate and hopefully open your minds to see Bitcoin's true value.  It can be so much more than just a speculative vehicle.

I mean.. you could zoom out to a longer time period than 7 days and it'll become clear
exactly

I wouldn't call it a lagging indicator.. search traffic increased steadily with price from july to january even with major drops in the way it still went up. For the first time in awhile the sites start to drop in traffic while price is down.

If the price went down, but traffic continued to climb.. it would be an easy time to buy. Not the case.
It depends on the extent of how bad things are. That exchange has a lot of money the question is do they have enough to cover their obligation. I mean even if we assume the worst is true I don't see how this Compares with mount gox. That exchange was straight-up burglarized and collapsed. With bitfinex the worst case scenario appears to be a few people going to prison and confidence shaken along with a potential forced liquidation from the exchanges assets.. The thing is Bitcoin was around 3 to $4,000 before all of this began. We're coming up on one more year of growth. A lot of new people to the space. If anything to me that explains why we are at 7500. People are already nervous. Granted it may fall further if all this comes out in a news article but undercutting the price before all this began? Not even Mount gox did that. The parallel to 2014 however would be blatantly obvious
That's kind of an off argument though because USD is backed by American GDP and the trust in the fed and American government which everyone if they are not a fridge libertarian has some degree of trust in. The tether situation is concerning simply because each tether token is supposed to be backed by exactly the same amount of USD. Regardless of anyone's opinion on the US dollar if it is not exactly this it's some degree of fraud
Sure.  Until the regulators discover and announce to the whole world that bitfinex has been selling Tether for US$0.10 each the whole time and allowing it to be traded on it's exchange.

Guess what will happen to the price of BTC?
Anyone so medicated you don't know what is human anymore
And likewise, I'm expressing my view of what Bitcoin is to me.

It is a token speculated on exchanges for profit.  Otherwise, why would 90% of the posts on this forum be about price on the exchanges?

Anyway, since when have you been appointed to be the moral police? 
Thanks, I hope he's right.
Ok, let's try a year? 
Lulz.

You're quite the brainiac, sparky.

Swooooooooosh......
Not sure if you're trolling or not
The important point is not whether bitfinex is solvent.

What is more important is how much each Tether was actually sold for.  Do not forget that Tether trades are at least 4-5 times more than USD.

If it's discovered that each Tether was sold for only 10 cents, the price of BTC will collapse.
There's no way to know if Tether will honour their word and provide 1USD per USDT. But the most amazing thing is, if you buy 100 USDT in the market, you will have to spend more than $100 USD. 

Btw, Bitfinex does not distinguish USD from USDT. Those pumps at Bitfinex may very well be powered by USDT. 

Since Bitfinex is an unregulated market, they may very well be providing inside information to whalers, in order for them to manipulate the price value. 

There's a lot of shady stuff in the crypto world and such subject is still Tabu in this sub. Few have the balls to speak about it in public.

If*


And like I said, it doesnt keep me busy. Go doom and gloom all you like.
>Let's stop being hypocrites to call it otherwise.

You imply that all other views of Bitcoin is wrong and only yours is right.
 While that might be the first thought that comes to your mind is it really the only one? Not many people buy things they don't believe in or have some kind of thought about. In fact the only real bubble I can think of was the Dutch tulip bulb run up. Even the NASDAQ in 1999 which famously gets called a bubble really had a lot of Merit behind it. It's what's responsible for modern society. Time will tell if Bitcoin has an impact like that but you might be buying a part of History
Freedom to be your own bank and fully control your own financial destiny.  I have a strong libertarian bent, so Bitcoin resonates with me.  Sure I want to be rich as a result of my price speculation, but it is more than that to me.

Edit:  Just adding one more thing:

Freedom to transact business privately/anonymously.  It is nobody's f\-ing business what I'm doing with my money as long as I am not harming anyone else.
Gottem
Do you mean like if insiders were able to buy usdt for $0.10 each? I suppose anything is possible in an unregulated Market. I still don't see how you figure the price will collapse though because when Mount gox actually did collapse and all those Bitcoins were actually stolen the price still didn't collapse it merely dropped from 1000 to 200 which is an 80% drawdown. We already had a 70% draw down with the $6,000 bottom. 80% puts us at 4000. I realize a lot of people use tether to buy Bitcoin but someone holds those keys so worst case scenario if things are like that what you had was a lot of theft. Someone owns those Bitcoins. Back in September of 2017 they actually did have a one-to-one ratio from what's been printed. I have no idea I guess we just have to wait and see because there's just not enough evidence to come to a rational conclusion. Is there stuff we don't know? Probably. Do we have any idea what it is? You also have to wonder how much of this is already baked into the market price because we fell in January pretty hard and no one is really sure why. One thing that has been bouncing around in my head is the people at bitfinex really don't have any interest in prison and have been unwinding all this. That's why the drop has been so substantial. 
Not doing so is dishonest like whoever the idiot was that voted down that last post I made. If you disagree with honest transparency it makes you a shill and a pump and dumper. I mean seriously if they are too stupid to argue their own Point why are they even here? Is it some tribal religious thing to them?
If you believe the bullshit that their customers are paying US$1 for each Tether.

For all we know, it's sold only for 10 cents.
Let's say Tether was sold for 10 cents.

That means even as I write this, each BTC is still being traded for $750 on Bitfinex, not $7,500.  

If this is the case and made public, would you still pay US$7,500 for a BTC?  Or are you more like to be willing to pay only $750?
Well it definitely wasn't sold for $0.10 to everyone and it's also what? 30% of the market. I mean Bitcoin was nearly 4,000 before this whole tether thing even started. As late as September of last year they had verified reserves on that 1:1 ratio. It's since then they have been stonewalling everyone and if they have sense they have probably been working to accumulate as much money as possible so they can call in an auditor when they are ready and say look everything is fine. That's a really big exchange and they have had ample warning that heat is coming. I mean there is an absolute ton of cash flowing in there they could use to repair the books even if they were doing Shady things in November and December. There's yet another thing I'm looking for. Insiders people like the Winklevoss twins. Mr wu from bitmain. Those guys. If there was truly a meltdown risk you would see high-volume liquidation and that's not happening right now. In fact the volume is disgustingly low. I share your concern that something is definitely not right. I just don't see any evidence for it being a world-ending scenario
Let's get one fact straight - they have NEVER been audited.

September audit?  Here's that it is

There are two main things about that article and I have read it before. Number one they actually had money in an account. That would prevent a meltdown . number 2 there's probably something we don't know. Even if your theory is true that some people were able to buy tether at massive discounts it was definitely not widespread. They also have had ample time to repair these books even if they were cooking them. Lastly it's in their best interest to stay solvent. Think about how many millions of dollars they make a year, like legitimately. Collapsing the market would not only send most of them to prison most likely it would end their Cash Cow
Yes, they are still trying to continue operations.  Hence, fleeing from Hong Kong to the Caribbean.  Totally legit of course (haha).

Most of us seems to think that people will not do things that will land them in prison.  No offence but that has been proven time and again to be rather naive.
