*guy who wrote 10k never again article panic intensifies*

10k today
What stage of Cryptocurrency adoption are we in?


Innovators (2.5%) - I think this was between 2009 - spring of 2017


Early Adopters (13.5%)  - summer 2017 to present.   I think we are still in this stage.  Do you agree?


Early Majority (34%) - maybe begins when price breaks 75k.  Early adopters finally got their family members to invest.  To the moon!!! 


Late Majority (34%) - price breaks 300k. People start to use it regularly as currency. 


Laggards (16%) - price breaks 1 million. Almost everyone knows about bitcoin and many are actively using it.

How is the SEC meeting on monday going to affect the price this weekend?
It's almost time .... for the Friday afternoon pump sesh
Have anyone thought about the fact that the first government issued crypto currency is a fraud?

Bitcoin is supreme 
So we happily got the balloon over an altitude of 9,700 feet.  For this flight I took the liberty to paint a giant green dildo and a message “10k or bust” on it.   Let’s do this!
10k incoming 
FOMO hitting hard!  
Ok my Daily Discussion is this.

I sold 2.5 BCash for FIAT.

Actually that's it.
May the 4th be with us all.

10kneveragain my arse. To the moon!
Good morning Europe!! ❤️🇪🇺
Let's see if the bulls can push us over 10K!
Where are the fudder dudders recently? Btrashers are given vacations from their shillfarms on rallies or what?
Where's the Kaboom? There was supposed to be an Earth shattering KABOOM!
**Keep Fighting Bulls!**
May the 4th be with Bitcoin! 10k today?
Price won't fall. If you want cheap Bitcoins, better buy now. Before it's too late. 😄

Remember that time when I said: "This is your last chance to buy below 8k". And people got all angry with me? Where are they now?
Real noob here sorry,  but I'm looking to buy some Bitcoin. I have a (software?) wallet - Electrum. If my PC is turned off, and I send Bitcoin to the wallet address, where does the money go until I turn on the PC, surely my wallet is inaccessible if I'm offline?
Still early in the day, I expect later this evening we will have an attempt at $10k
Bitcone ! 
http://bitcointicker.co just popped up a message that bitcoin just had a 24 hour low of $0 on bitfinex! I missed it, but did anyone else get to buy in at that price :)
Ready up your 10k memes bois
Flying high now baby!!
Got my big green dildo out for tonight! 
Steady now, steady does it 
10k, 10k, 10k!!!!
The lotion is ready.....
Paint dick, green paint..
Next stop 10k
Good morning.
Love me some Bitcone...
Now look here chaps.

There's a shallow woman who won't fuck me until my BTC portfolio is worth over 50k.

Just a few k off.

Could some unselfish bastard push the price over 10k for the sake of my knob?
When Bitcoin hits $1 million will people still buy? At that point the price would have to climb to $2m just for someones $20 dollar investment to double to $40. 
Assuming we hit $1m Bitcoin in 2023, thats 15 yrs from genesis to $1m. So will it take an additional 15 years to go from $1m to $2m? 
...And have to wait 15 yrs for that $
20 dollar investment to become $40?
..Thoughts??
My personal portfolio is at -0.93%

Hasn't looked that nice in a long time. But there's a very strong resistance at my break even. 

It's as if the market *knows*... 

*spooky*
Hello there.
Toying with the Goyim. Get used to it. #goldmansachs 
What's funny is that everything after 4/20 has been sideways price action lol.
Stand by Europe for a day when BTC will slip her panties up and down around 9800, but never *quite* take them off.

As Europeans you are probably used to that.
If bitcoin hits 10K this weekend, what would happen in the next 7 days after that?
BTC vs Gold:  Much discussion about this, and a great deal of misunderstanding I suspect:

1)  Does the usability of a store of value affect its price?  

There's actually very little evidence of that.  That's a starting point.

2)  Is Gold or BTC a better store of value or a better means of exchange?

Well, BTC is very volatile - but the volatility trends upwards - so that's part of the appeal :)

Regarding means of exchange: 

Consider this: if you have 10k's worth of gold under your bed, and wish to sell it - at the current 'market price' - How do you do that?  Think about it.  Where do you take it to sell it?  Fact is, you can't.  (Except maybe at a Cash for Gold type place, or some Gold scrap dealer, or on the black market, where you will lose 30-50% of its 'value.')

If you have 10k worth of BTC in your wallet, where can you exchange that? - hundreds of places, for a small percentage fee.

Sermon over.


Question:
What is the best way/site... To convert Visa/MC gift cards to Bitcoin?
Long lower shadow on previous day candlestick is a bullish sign. :)
Come on 10k!
The past few hours on the gdax 5min view (for GBP or USD) seem to be showing violent rises and falls. Does anyone have any theories on it? Don't think I've seen that sort of patterns before! 
Go, go, go!!!

OK.  We are over 9.8 and volumes are good.

Get the 10k memes out.
Europe wants some Bitcoins for brunch.
quick sell and rebuy bause its going up for too long?
Here we go! 
Bitstamp just hit 9.9 

TA: pumpy wumpy time.
May the 4th be with us all
HODL!
Poor shorters.
Bitcoin likes edging me slowly...
10k never again, clearly.

A little data for anyone who may want some insight: My last four bitcoin purchases (from most recent to least recent) were at $9060, at $7200, at $6700 and at $6350.

Around $500 equivelent purchased each time. I consider myself a casual buyer.
**Bitcoin Sets Sights Above $10K After Bull Breakout**

https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-sets-sights-10k-bull-breakout/

Following a bull breakout last night, bitcoin (BTC) looks set to test $10,000 and could possibly move higher over the weekend.

Bitcoin closed yesterday (as per UTC) at $9,759 on Bitfinex - the highest daily close since March 7 - signaling the upside break of the week-long narrowing price range we've been anticipating.

The cryptocurrency also clocked a two-month high of $9,875 yesterday. At time of writing, BTC is changing hands at $9,776 and remains on the hunt for a big break above the $10,000 mark, as indicated by the bullish setup in the technical charts below.

View

BTC looks set to test the 200-day MA resistance of $10,015. A close (as per UTC) above that level would strengthen the bull grip and could yield a sustained rally to $10,455 and above.

The outlook remains bullish as long as prices hold above the ascending 10-day MA, located at $9,290.

An unexpected close (as per UTC) below $8,652 (April 26 low, pennant low) would signal a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change.

I've been waiting for the #10kneveragain guy too lol. 
Yeah where is that guy? 
^^^^^ LOLOL
We're definitely still in the innovator stage. Despite the huge market cap, there's really not many people who actually own crypto, even less who own a significant amount. There's some adoption in retail, but in the financial world is still practically inexistent. How many financial institutions use Bitcoin?


https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html

According to that website, there are roughly 22 million wallets with over 0.001 bitcoin in them.

Do the math. Roughly 22,000,000 wallets and 7 billion people on earth = 0.3% of the world actually holds real value in Bitcoin.

Buy more!!!
so true with the "Finally got their family members to invest" took me forever to convince some family members...but now they are in!
No, still in innovators phase
Alright, so now you gotta go all the way with your prediction.  What year will we see the Laggards?
\*affect
The Goldman-Sachs news means that it will likely hit 10k shortly.

What interests me - purely as a matter of fun and speculation - is its price behaviour when it breaches 10k.

Any thoughts?  

Short period of mad exponential growth?  > 10k then levelling at 10k; >>10k then a major correction; dicking around 10k forever :)
it's almost like bitcoin is the only crypto worth buying
Strange shit happening around Bcash.  

It is completely discredited, and widely distrusted.  

Day trader friends of mine are extremely cautious of it.  But it pumps.  A relatively cheap coin, so more easy to manipulate than BTC I guess.  ASIC miners hold hundreds of thousands of this shitcoin that they can't release to the market.  If they all sold, the price would crash to its real value - 100 USD.

I don't like to sound like one of the Bcash conspiratorial sock-puppets, but I honestly believe that the entire crypto space would be healthier if that nasty lying coin died - but someone is keeping it alive.

*edit: I made some grammatical changes*
A am feeling I spike coming too.
which direction you feeling
Will he show his face here again when proven wrong?
Nah, I SODL'd some. Down to $7k pls so I can re-buy. Then up to $1m
Fuckin shillfarms, for some reason that makes me laugh.
The Kaboom was yesterday. Didn't you hear it?
No we weren't. High resistance at 10k is not that easy to break. But we will soon, my friend.
Stop fighting the bulls!, let them do their thing man.
What makes you believe we will NEVER see the price down under 8k EVER again so strongly?
Can't blame them, it's kinda retarded to say the price will never go below 8k again. We've bounced to 12k before y'know?
You’re an idiot. It will hit 8k again!
Its never too late :D But you cant really predict the unpredictable, it will g up, then will go mass selloff, then go up and again mass selloff, its just that xD but the price will still goes up, dunno how much ;\)
You tell’em bubu
That was you? Nice.
It's unfathomable how you can be in this space for more than 5 months and believe the idiocy you're spewing.
It lives on every copy of the blockchain so not a problem. 
It's on the decentralized distributed ledger on thousands of computers all around the world.

With electrum you connect to one copy of that ledger (a node).
Your electrum wallet doesn't store it, the Bitcoin network does, so it matters not if you are connected when the coins are sent to your wallet address.  The only time you need your software wallet is when you want to spend the balance.
You in fact don't "possess" Bitcoin. What you possess is a secret key that entitles you to spend the amount that's on an address in the network. If that address has an amount of Bitcoin assigned to it, and you possess the secret key to that address, you can spend that amount. It's as simple as that.
As boring as it is, a few days of consolidation at this level would be good in the long run. I’m expecting that or a drop and hoping to be pleasantly surprised!
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeccccccccccctttttttttttttt
I was looking at the btrash, 1 GB blocks... 

For shits and giggles look at the node/'server specs': https://gist.github.com/gavinandresen/f209a02ee559905aa69bf56e3b41040c


Bitcone ! I gots me some thurrm to man  
Sorry mate - what is this Bitcone?
How is she shallow if shes interested in bitcoin?
next time
I feel like bitcoin could go into the hundreds of millions. Once big players start accepting it (Amazon, alibaba etc) there's no reason for people to trade it for fiat which will increase the value drastically. I think it could honestly go well beyond even the highest expectations.

No one has ever seen this before and likely won't again until we can do away with the concept of money altogether.

Edit: 

What will be really interesting though is what kind of price discovery happens when 1/1000 Satoshi payments are possible through lightning, and when price discovery stops being against fiat and actually happens against goods and services.

I think that it could result in a crazy dynamic where goods become cheaper year over year, but people are also paid less year over year.

This could lead society away from over indulgence, to a more sharing focused and less wasteful mindset as we collectively realize everyone should have the opportunity to be wealthy, but not at the expense of one another.


Bitcoin won't be an *investment* long before that. It will be a usable currency.

So, yes, people would still buy it. Not for gains, but to use it. I doubt, that it will ever reach $1m. But wouldn't it be nice?
Probably....they don't need to buy a whole btc, just fractions.
Yes. We will just speak of it in smaller denominations.
For bitcoin to be worth $1 million, it would be nearly equal in value to all the stocks listed on the NYSE.

17,000,000 x $1,000,000 = $17 trillion

Value of NYSE stocks (google + facebook + apple + microsoft + etc     =  $21.3 Trillion.

Not gonna happen anytime soon, probably not in our lifetime.

100K is very possible, though, in the next few years/ decade. That's still an enormous return compared to stocks.
Hej med dig :D
Too many Goyim millionaires, SHUT IT DOWN
We could see the rocket effect and we might zoom past $11k
The collapse of the banking system.
Go to $12k.
Massive selloffs 
The following weekend....duh
Whales would sell then buy back in at 9k just like they did on the 30th.
>but the volatility trends upwards

Why do you think that is? Because people have expectations for its future utility.

Now ask yourself where the value of gold originates. It's not just scarcity. It's history, too. Gold once *had* utility as a means of exchange, in daily business. You cannot just replace it with something else that is scarce and maybe more easy to exchange and expect people to value it in the same way.

No. Bitcoin will only have real value, if it achieves a status as a kind of currency. Like gold did before. 

I'm betting a lot of money that it *will*. I believe that it will.

But if it won't, then it won't have any value at all.
gold is stable-ish because its physical and has been known for over 500 years, everyone knows what that is as a pretty & malleable metal. that gold chain can be melted into a statue still or vice versa when bought or sold that is why it is by weight. 
BTC is volatility is because people are still learning / adopting it, and its new. most people here are trying to make money off of it buying and selling it as it is trying becomes a stable currency.
It will be a currency! > but 1millon or 1oo? ; only the future knows. that's why it is still a risk, and you can still lose everything. but the greater the risk also greater reward if you are a holder. 

If you had gold under your bed it will still be gold everyone still knows what that is and it will still buy you rice! 
 if BTC fails or is just a FAD can you buy rice ? IDK #1920's  -5555-
Any ideas?
gdax seems to be lagging behind on the bitfinex price movement so it's likely just arbitrage bots trying to catch up. Volume is very thin on gdax in comparison

No, I've got a headache.  Maybe in the morning.
You've done well! Coinbase had by account blocked while Bitcoin was in the 6k range. 
Bit of an odd comment? Revealing how much you own and kind of irrelevant to everyone?

Yes.  You keep posting about it.  It is like Laundromat, but a coin that washes away your money.
You must REALLY like Paytomat...  15 posts about it.  You don't seem like a shill at all.  
That post doesn't read like an advertisement at all.
What an idiotic comment
Tea leaves or crystal ball?

British Telecom Casino?
Goldman Sachs just signed up to be involved !
Interesting. It excites me that most people in this thread seem to agree with you that we are in the innovators stage.   Alot of upside potential ahead then. 
what, in your opinion, is a "significant amount"
Because people can't hold multiple wallets?
Definitely!
This number is way lower. I alone have 4 separate bitcoin wallets. 
Sounds like they are early adopters.  My family is going to be the laggards for sure unfortunately. 
Probably in another 7 years or so. 
Correct. Believe it or not I just got an A+ in my honors literature class. 
It’s a good question but would take a fortune teller to answer.

It could hit 10k and stay there. It could hit 10k and drop. It could hit 10k and 🌙!!!

Here is some food for thought. Although past actions are not always indicative of future actions, the last time BTC hit 10k, it took about 2 weeks for it blaze past 20k. Ask me what the price is in a year and I imagine it will be higher but who knows for sure?!
I’m not making any precise predictions, but I think that every day more people get in to bitcoin than get out. We are slowly moving forward no matter what. There will most likely be mad peaks and dips, but in the end it will just continue to grow. That’s why I HODL. We are not going backwards in the long term.
Exactly my point 
It doesn't go anywhere though right?  1500 tops and it kicks around there constantly.  1600 hit and I sold.
Same thing with eth. When you look around, all eyes seem to be on bitcoin. But for some reason eth is out perfoming btc. It's baffling.

I like being called "retarded". Call me names! Uh, oh!
I would rephrase his/her above statement: "Price won't fall for now. If you want relatively cheap Bitcoins, buying now is a good choice". 
Okay I'm not going to be able to understand this. But it should just work simply enough?

Yep, I would rather nice and slow to hopefully avoid any crashes.
Stopped reading at half baked thoughts. Kinda expect more :) Is that wrong?

For what it's worth, John McAfee once said that Bitcoin will hit 100 billion in 25 years. 
I agree. Right now it is a really great investment opportunity. After it gets above 100k territory I think it becomes only a good investment opportunity.  The higher it goes above that number the greater the mass adoption.  It will become more and more stable as we get closer to one million and people will be more comfortable spending it knowing the value will not fluctuate much in the short term.   It will continue to increase in value above one million but it will be a more gradual process.   
At this point many people will most likely be earning it and not *buying* it.
bitcoin will be usable, but it will never be a currency, just like gold is not a currency checks or debit cards will never be a currency but bitcoin will be another form of payment.
Think through this math though. 
If the value of a fiat currency, let's say the peso, drops radically relative to BTC, then it might be $100,000,000 pesos to one BTC. 
A stock of an important company, say Google, will not really be worth any more or less than it did before. Google is still as big as Google is. But that share of Google stock might now cost $100,000,000 pesos. 

So the value of a peso can go way down relative to a BTC, and as a result a house, a share of stock, a Lambo etc. will be a low number of BTC and a high number of pesos. Dig?
Hey everyone, this guy can see into the future!

Seriously though. How are you so sure that millennials won't decide to put most of their money into crypto assets vs corporations that have fucked them over time and time again? Doesn't seem like that much of a stretch to me.
What happens 7 days after that?
Still waiting for you to tell me how many hours until bitcoin hits 10k.
That would be so dumb.
Why? Didn't the people that really wanted to sell, already sell at about $9700  the last 2 times it hit that?

Wouldn't someone rather hold for 11K or 12 K ?
I respectfully disagree, people buy BTC for several reasons.

Utility is only one element of that, and also only a part of its value.
Are you from Thailand? 5555
Sure - I could exchange my gold for rice in an emergency at a 90% loss in 'value'.  Equally I could exchange my kidney for a car!  

Extremis arguments such as yours are fun, but not necessarily instructive.
Maybe I'm thick, but I cant really see any sexy graphs on bitfinex website, only a price. Considered seeing if it was in the members area, but apparently they only accept rich kids with over 10,000!

Only problem is - does it work?  Probably not :)

It's below 10k right now.
Please!

Bit of an odd comment.  Kind of irrelevant to everyone.
I haven't revealed how much I own, my intention was to help those wondering if they should buy or not, I noticed quite a bunch of people are having that dilemma

"but to buy your coin you only take bitcoin? so you're really just taking bitcoin...?"
I would rather BCash died but it did in the past get above $4k
I want it hit $2K before I sell but who knows if it actually can 
You may want a crash - but it is simply not going to happen ever again.  

It is too late now to buy into a crash mate.  

Buy now, or forever kick your own arse up and down the street  :)
>having enough trouble staying over 96k..

holy shit I knew Bitcoin was high but THIS high!?
Yes. 

Simply put: the Bitcoins are never on your computer (at least not with a wallet like electrum). They are stored on a global computer network. 

(not 100% accurate, but a good enough for your case. Actually there are no Bitcoins, it's just a history of all transaction... Bitcoins don't really exist)

So, you don't need to be online to receive bitcoins.
My understanding is a bit limited on this, but I believe what happens is a request is sent from your wallet to the ledger. This request is recorded and tracked by the ledger. 

So when you make a request for say $100 worth of bitcoin to your offline wallet, a request is sent for that amount, and when successful, a response is sent (also recorded and tracked by the ledger) to your wallet. Once your wallet is reconnected and updates with the current ledger, you will see a pending/completed transaction in your wallet.
wat?
Vid OK, but seriously, when you write Bitcone - what do you mean?  You've posted that several times.
That guy is a bloody plonker
What about alts when bitcoin is $1m? If bitcoin is a stable currency at that point, will alts (with a much less mcap) still be a good investment until they reach their $1m bitcoin equivalent? Or will bitcoin render most alts useless at that point?
The whole "gold metaphor" is flawed in my opinion. 

Most people are making a *bet* that bitcoin *will* be usable as a currency (or equal form of payment) in the not too distant future.

*If* Bitcoin fails to provide real utility, the price will drop like a stone.


Probably $10.5k again. I think we'll consolidate at $12k for a while. I hope we don't, but it's likely we will. 
depends on your position.
5 numbers is better than 4. It's a mental hurdle. 
> I respectfully disagree, people buy BTC for several reasons.

Sure. But watch the price fall when it doesn't provide the expected utility and half of those people sell it.
Here's a nice *extremis* argument surrounding scarcity: a Van Gogh painting sold at 24,000,000  USD.

Sure, Van Gogh was a unique painter, but what is the utility of that painting?

Second, let's assume it **does** have utility as a work of beauty and history; is its 24 million price tag worth 240,000 times that of a perfect 100 dollar reproduction?

It's value is partly emotional - but mainly due to scarcity.  He had a meagre output.  If Van Gogh had painted 100,000 works, they would each be worth jack-shit :)

*Edit: arithmetic*
search sell gold on any browser your not going to lose 90%. 
also that is not an extreme argument the likely hood of all the worlds gold losing value is very very low, but the btc chances still low are much higher 
You mean 10k cereal soon ?

Nope, just that one. And it's referencing to how he spelled Bitcoin...
I think there will be many coins in the future like there is currently the Euro, Dollar, Yen, etc. Many coins and tokens, for various token economies. 
Altcoins with  unique useful features that can’t be duplicated by bitcoin will survive.  The useful ones with a relatively low fixed max supply (like bitcoin) will do better than others in terms of price appreciation. None of them will ever reach the price heights of bitcoin though.  I hold some alts that i think will do well long term.  
Nobody knows...
I think a lot of people see Bitcoin as Gold Version 2. 
As I've said, utility is only a part of it.  

I am extremely optimistic about BTC's capability to scale and become a highly convenient means of payment.  

Nevertheless, economically, I think it is a mistake to assume that its value (price, if you wish) is *directly* related to, and dependent upon, utility.

Gold has almost no utility.
> the likely hood of all the worlds gold losing value is very very low, but the btc chances still low are much higher

Agreed.

But you can't take your physical kilogram of gold to an exchange and say 'hey buy it' - it really only works virtually!

Look, I'm a chap who likes to write 'Lambo', 'To the Moon', and 'Bullish'.  

I do have a background in economics - but I'm much happier doing that. So - there you go.  See my top post :)
Thanks for your insight
Tea leaves or crystal ball?
Yep that was the day.
So if I spelt Bitcoin, Bitfuck - would you keep posting about it, as if it were interesting or relevant?

Just stop.  It is not interesting, funny, or anything.

Thunks

(That is how I spell thanks)
Which Alts do you hold?
Yes, and they're wrong.
> Gold has almost no utility.

But it *had*. And its value is directly related to its history. It is nostalgic.

Entrails of chickens.
Man, go wear a tampon...

Your estrogen level is too high...
Not sure if I’m allowed to say here. I’ll pm you. 
Time will tell.
Nations moved off the gold standard in the early 20th century; technologically it was no longer needed, its value - based mainly upon scarcity - remains. 

In the same way, nations may well move off the fiat standard in the 21st century.

But value is not, and never has been, directly tied to utility. 

Gold (and silver's) utility was already failing when people realised you could trim coins back in Roman times.  You can't 'trim' BTC.

Anyway, this is worthy of a discussion much longer than can be conducted here.  So all I shall say is: Hodl, and to the Moooon!!!
