Daily Discussion, May 05, 2018 -- TITLE
Hopefully I’m wrong but I suspect it may take all weekend to really break 10k. The amount of people who are going to sell every time it gets close has to be massive. It’ll take time to get through all of them is my guess 
Another stack of shorts just got rekt on bitfinex. Nice to watch. 😄
No cheating now, hodl your memes. 
Crossed 10K on binance
Guy who wrote 10k never again deletes articles, changes name*
ring ring.... 
A- they bought it at 9959.00..
B - send it sideways and then domp it.. put Vitalik on the line..
So close to 10k
I have just hit break even. Feels good! 😊
so much edging
Buffet and his demented friends' comments is having little effect, people are slowly realizing they're off the hook. The conferences in May will give real insight to people still new to btc, enough with ignorant craptalk.
Puuusssshhh
10k come at me bro
So close...
For everyone watching 10k it has never been hard to break in the past. All we're missing this time is massive fomo.
[deleted]
question: what kind of really cool and crazy things will bitcoin specifically enable in the future when it's truly adopted by everyone on the planet?

i get micropayments but what else?
Hodl the line!

It's all good guys, Mongolian new year sell off... buy the dip...
I’m not Bcash supporter at all. I actually know people working with the Japanese embassy to have Ver come before a house sub-committee to answer questions on bait and switch tactics which defrauded a lot of the older generations. (Allegedly)

I am all in for Bitcoin but scale ability isn’t we’re we need it now. The market never lies. Once it’s ready, the sky is the limit. We all play out part. I am relying on the devs to hopefully have bitcoin retail ready by end of year. I will do my part in keeping confusion out of the market and the likes of Roger Ver will not be part of this technology’s future if he continues his tactics. That is guaranteed. 
You will hear about it soon around July what the investigation has turned up. For the devs, please keep doing what you do best and we are year to support you. 
Dat 10k hole is about to be penetrated
About $100 to go on GDAX. Itshappening.gif
What do you guys reckon will happen when we touch 10K ? FOMO or big sell off ? 
*Don't breathe...*
Big 10K sell wall for BTC on Bitfinex
Can I pay an online retailer by using a GDAX withdraw? Is that a safe way to do it? I've been trading for almost a year, but never actually bought anything with btc...yikes I know
Will we breach 10k today?
yes [  ]   no [  ]
If bitcoin hits 12k alts are gonna go insane
*Obliterate* that sell wall at 10k, bois.
This market manipulation is giving me a strange form of blue balls..

It’s as if J.P. Morgan himself is keeping Bitcoin from “climaxing” to 10k.
Su Su na - Keep fighting !
Here we go!!
C'mon, PUNCH IT CHEWIE!!!
When 1 BTC = 10 M?
bought some more at 9480 ish - this is got to be close to the bottom!
Some whale is having none of this. Bidding thousands just below market. 
**Keep going Bulls.**
Time to dust off those $10k memes
[deleted]
can you please explain to a noob - isn't Bitmain capable of pulling a 51% attack if they dominate the mining market with their ASICs and own majority of nodes?
one more short squeeze then fomo cream all over the bears mouth 
Hello 👋 
10k come come :D
It's pumping.
only $75 more and we are at $10k.
today is the dayy
Noooooooooooooooo   :)
Are we waiting for the American markets to be in full swing before we try for $10k?
Yo Yo...my t-food is poppin!
We are making a meal of this this 10k ... Come on bitcone !!
wow my uncle posted some BTC jam on Facebag, anyway if he is ^^^^ old fashion guy

I take get a gold plated jeep instead of the lambo
wondering how the wankers at r/buttcoin feel now
Hello. I come to tell a problem about "kraken". I placed a purchase at 9530 lever 5 . FOR 0.5 BTC, when the price hit the target, the order was automatically canceled by 
 kraken for a false reason. I think I change my platform for this reason.  when the US will be at 10K dollars, I hope that Europe will push for 10 K euros;
lame
The end of the weekend pump?
My body is ready.
Looking for suggestions. What is the best simple phone wallet for small daily transactions
Hope this is those bots/ppl who were gonna offload at 10k and we can retest is later 
January correction has made me so skeptical that I just sold all my btc at 9580 USDT. Now, it's back up :| 


FML
Is this all just the build up to go for $10k again today or maybe we will have to wait a few more days?
Just used crypto to buy some stuff online. Just a matter of time before credit cards are not used anymore.
I’m thinking about taking some profits guys....argghhh
Don't like where this is going.
We're very close to reaching the Golden Cross (counterpart to the Death Cross that occurred 1 month ago). I consider this to be very bullish because I expected the bear trend to last longer. Some people think the 2017 bull run is still in play.

Approaching singularity...
We’ll pass 10k it’s just going to be a tough go at first.  Psychological factors and the fact that there are probably a number of people looking to sell in the 10k ballpark.  Momentum is there though and will continue to roll on soon enough.

*in before the dog pile - yes this is just my opinion and my statement is based on nothing more
Here we go. Sunday pump. It's a thing now.
Time for a dip
doooomp it...
Wont make me popular here :)

Sold the lot at 9600k

Want this sucker to drop

Fuck hodling take profits and get back in lower
She's about to squirt...
Maybe we hit 10K and 10am EST?
Big walls, will fall. 
Technically we are still in a wedge. However there are some faint indications of a possible upward break out beginning to form. Volume is increasing while price us rising. Any large investor will have lost out on discounted prices if this pans to be true. 
My VERY GOOD source says 12k in 2 weeks (Friday the 18th to be specific) then dip of about 10-15%. Privileged information so y’all should feel lucky
Looks like the balloon is out of fuel this trip. We’ll have to set her down for a while.  Maybe next weekend 💪

Watching someone buy 1 BTC every four seconds on GDAX... XD
Good morning fellas zombies of crypto, about to go live with some new ideas on good ol' Bitcoin! [https://www.twitch.tv/krowncrypto](https://www.twitch.tv/krowncrypto)
If you know that you need burn 24hours * 6/h * 12,5btc * 10000 usd = 18M dollars/day just to maintain same price as yesterday... Then you know that today price is just too high. Maybe about 8-9k is right one. Now you buy it for too much...

Watch this carefully. If fees go up as we approach $10,000; it’s not sustainable. 
SELL SELL SELL!!! - it is going to crash to one dollar!

Hi again, r/Bitcoin! This is the last chance to fill in the quarterly reddit cryptocurrency survey. (yes that means no more seeing this post in the daily every couple of days!) The survey where every 3 months I collect responses from the reddit crypto community to see how the community has changed since the last few surveys.

**If you would like to fill in the survey, you can do that [here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfhkUsvWO4xAHnXQ1kjOl9tvmubEw_NquQNb3gwCMQN7LJLVA/viewform?usp=sf_link)**

Thanks for your time!
Roughly 1,800 BTCs more to be sold before it hits $10k on bitfinex.
Hello fellow holders, how much BTC are you holdin' rn?
Bitcoin won't go above the 200 DMA until the death cross is reversed. Bet.
I agree it will be a battle...
Yep gets close and massive sell offs. 10k is gonna be a big wall to overcome imo. It's a nice round I'm out number for the weak hands. 
Squeezed out
and.. why more longs got "rect".. 

you should focus on your own portfolio  :\) and care less if other random people lose money.
But binance doesn't trade BTCUSD? Where do they pull this price from?
Binance doesn't count
I was waiting to flame the shit out of him lol
gzz!
Sell the lot and buy back in later

I have a feeling we are gonna dip slightly once we hit 10k

Tea leaves of course
Me too :)
Most Rich people have no need for BTC's existence. They are already "on the moon". That is why they don't like it. 
I frankly don't think he cares much about what BTC supporters think.
Buffet's comments are very disappointing, but when I think about it, I don't blame him given he's been the top beneficiary of the very economy Bitcoin/crypto attacks. He's too old to change and has this old school mentality that the current system is running just fine.  And why should he otherwise given he's made billions from it? I still like Buffet, but I do NOT believe for one second he doesn't understand cryotocurrencies and their inherent value. He's simply spreading massive FUD because it directly threatens his very own system of creating wealth. But also, I do NOT believe for one second that he doesn't own any Bitcoin...maybe he's not directly trading it, but someone at Berkshire quietly is for him.
people won't get burned twice.
No, I would presume they're going to create derivatives based on the price of BTC that have nothing to do with the underlying coins.  Nobody will own any BTC, or even need to purchase any, they're literally just betting on the price going up/down and exchanging fiat.  Hence why people saying this is institutional money flooding in are all kinds of wrong (at this stage), but it does indicate a certain degree of legitimacy (if you call investment banking parasites legitimate...).
I'm really smart.  But I don't know.  Does that help?

I like the idea of a universal currency where we always have the currency to pay for goods wherever we travel- instead of having to exchange at airports. Also, fighting against I inflation depending on currency. Other speculative ideas as well- that's the beauty of it imo
Streaming payments, which is a special form of micropayments.

Let's say you watch a movie, and every second a tiny payment will be made for that, automatically, as long as you watch. 
It's more the blockchain tech not Bitcoin itself that will enable cool and crazy stuff...
Yes, buy. Spread the word. 
I'm confident that 1 BTC \> 10k USD by the end of the year. On the other hand, I'm not so confident that there will be a dip big enough to make waiting \(and the risk\) worth it.
Offset by rising quilt sales tho.
yeah :D fnally :D we need to keep fighting till 10k :D
Everyone gets to ride a unicorn, with little rainbow trails behind it as it runs.
$10k doesn't matter, $11k Doesn't matter. $12k matters. It's about how long it takes to get there that matters. 
80% chance it bounces down off 10k I'd guess. 
selloff probably xD
Sell off
More like FOMO in media.
Of course, there is. 

Question is: How many hidden buy orders are there?
Just don't buy drugs that way. Your account will be blocked.

It hit 10k today already
How can an alt go insane?  It has a number value called its price.  

What do you mean?
> bois

I am a man.  Don't gender misidentify me please.  

I am proud of my cock.  

When BTC reaches 10k, it is traditional for us binaries to paint our dicks green in celebration.

Please allow us this safe space to do that.
How is this market manipulation? Low volume = market manipulation? Enlighten me. 
[deleted]
Jing lor... tammai 
That’s what I keep repeating lol 
Shortly after BTC = 9.99999 M
15 years?
2025
I would say 10 - 30 years. If is sooner than that the dollar would have to crash.
I BTC is currently worth 140 million Indonesian Rupiah. It will probably take a couple years to get back down to 10 M.
Meanwhile, the most openly dishonest and dicredited coin in the cryptoworld is pumping.

Whatever next :)
Roger Ver isn't.
Only if they were actually running 51% of them, but they are not. They manufacture and sell their equipment. Also, even if it was possible I doubt bitmain would want to do this because they make a killing out of manufacturing and selling mining equipment. To do a 51% attack a mining collective would need to be controlling 51% of the active miners at a given time. Not the same as a manufacturer responsible for building 51%+ of the miners currently running 
Oh Hai Mark!
Wait! Scooter in nz! I have a Vespa 🛵 in Auckland 😊
Hey, you, with your crazy arithmetic!!!
yes 10k will happen soon. We need dat 12k though
butthurt?
we sure feel good as always - collecting comedy gold...
What was the price before you placed the order?
Samourai
You might want to look into Wirex. They will soon support the generation of virtual+physical pseudo-credit (debit) cards for many countries (currently just uk after they changed systems). Their wallet is good enough for small amounts. 
how several people here panic selling on the low. Even if you think it drops you wait until the next high to sell. It doesn't just drop.

It is like buying in when it just pumped up. Buy in a dip, sell on a pump
[deleted]
I suspect it will go quickly. So will $11k. Just week\-end. Bit much to expect things to just carry on 7 days a week. 
sounds like bias options but as long as you don't trade it sounds fine :\)
Um credit cards give float time lol generally a month after purchase is when that money is due for payment. that’s the entire point of credit. Crypto will never replace that. Until banks start integrating them together, people will always continue to use credit to buy things. 
Been using overstock for a while now, biggest item so far was a sofa, although delivery was 2 days later than promised. Newegg works great too for computers etc... and their catalogue is rapidly expanding. Ditched my Visa card 2 months ago. If amazon and co don't follow they may regret it soon.
This will become the standard. 
Couldn't there still be credit cards for crypto? There is still gonna be a need for borrowing regardless
Commenting so I can find you when it hits $20k
Yeah, go for it.  SELL SELL SELL

(Heh)
The market wasn't ready, yet. No worries, we'll get through eventually. Might take a few tries...
So the death cross didn't work. I would expect we can safely presume to golden cross is also bullshit ? 
...initiating quantum immortality....
How do you know when its time to sell?  Are you selling all your assets or just part?
You are, an idiot.
Your buttocks?
k thx bye
Do you think there's a possibility  people are holding back over weekends now there is so obviously institutional work-hours involvement or influence?
mm hmm
Probably an arbitrage trading bot.
2advancedmath4me
"18M dollars/day" - that is significant amount of $, however - they are doing it with USDT and they cant print as much as they want ;)
When the price is higher, LESS BTC need to be sold to pay the electricity bills, not more.  Not all of the mined coins are immediately sold. 
We are discussing it. Right here in the DAILY DISCUSSION thread. 
Bullshit
Bcash army up to their usual tricks. I smell a rat 
I think what is important is to keep bitcoins ... if you win $ 500 with bitcoin you will be sad to give $ 5? me no ..
I’m not Bcash supporter at all. I actually know people working with the Japanese embassy to have Ver come before a house sub-committee to answer questions on bait and switch tactics which defrauded a lot of the older generations. (Allegedly)

I am all in for Bitcoin but scale ability isn’t we’re we need it now. The market never lies. Once it’s ready, the sky is the limit. We all play our part.

The book at one stage yesterday was 6000 sells and 1 000 buys and it went to $10k anyway.
Increased to 2,000 BTCs.  Hmm.

Looks like sellers are lowering their expectations.
Never ask, never reveal.
Well after DCAing and buy the dips, I finally have ONE whole dogecoin
are you Treasury ?
**BOLLOCKS.**

My FUD detector twitches when I hear the words 'death cross' combined with BTC approaching 10,000 USD.

*Edit: I clarified my stance by writing BOLLOCKS.*
Whenever I've seen someone betting here, he was wrong...
USDT - crossed at 10,020 now down to 9940

Binance USDT/BTC pair mostly is number 1 or 2 in 24H trade volume. That doesnt count ? 
I didn't hold for over a year, yet, so I'd have to pay tax on some of the gains.

I'm holding! I ride the waves.

Anyway, it could just as well be, that 10k initiates a bull run. Nobody really knows...
Then you understand very little about his investment philosophies.  

If you do, you will understand why he will not invest in cryptos.

Not suggesting he's right or wrong, only that he's consistent in practising what he preaches.
Buffet likes buying into companies which produce value at reasonable prices.

Bitcoin produces nothing.

Why would he buy into bitcoin?
Sure but this still provides a massive incentive for those longing / shorting to buy and sell BTC on the side which on its own means a large possibility of seeing new money hitting the space 
Yes, thanks so much!!! Cheers. 
Saved for future reference. You better be right about the whales.
Cool.  Would have cost me 20c to watch Ghostbusters II.
This guy knows how it works /s
Eh?  
Ok so what will happen when we touch 12K ? Final make or break ? 
Trying to buy kratom actually...
I am not an English native, but with that said, I still believe my usage of "breach" in the above phrase was correct. I would however REALLY LOVE IT if a charming and cute English native like yourself would gallantly correct my possible mistake. It would - in fact - be something of the highest degree of honor for a non-native plebeian such as my poor self.

"MARKET MANIPULATION"
The entire crypto market is manipulated in plain sight if you open your eyes.

BTC trades using real money (fiat) accounts for only a small fraction of daily volume.  Rest are pump'ed using alts.  

You think the alt volumes are 'real' substitutes like Tether and TRUE?  Look closely:

a.  Tether - $3.8B traded in 24 hours but total Tether is only $2.4B.

b.  TRUE - $250M traded in 24 hours but total TRUE is only $65M.

These are fake wash trades to pump up BTC's price.

So it means very little if BTC hits $10k or $20k - it's all based predominantly on fake trades.
I'm up to my eyebrows in them. Amazing what happens if you just let the noise and opinions fade away and position yourself where the volume and interest is.

Everything is manipulated. There are no more open free markets, no more price discovery. This is true for gold, LIBOR , Bitcoin and anything else you can think off. Our job is to be on the right side of the manipulation. That's what we do.

And for Bitcoin now, that's long.
Roger, oVer and out
What about AntBleed?
What is so significant about the $12K mark?
9800 $ .an idea ?
Pamp eet
Yeah weekends recently have been fairly quiet.
They won't regret it "soon" because there is no way btc will replace credit cards "soon."
[deleted]
Lol ... crypto is a rounding error where real world trading is concerned.  

And anyway, most of volume in crypto is trading on the exchanges, not spending it in the real world.
Maybe one day when price is stable.  

But when you are running a credit business on single digit fees and collecting on a monthly basis, it's hard to manage your risk when price is fluctuating 5-10% daily.

This is the fourth time lol.
What do you mean, "the death cross didn't work"? It obviously happened. Do you mean, "the death cross didn't cause Bitcoin to literally die"? Well no shit! These are just names for well-known technical indicators. When you hear "cup-and-handle" it doesn't mean Bitcoin is going to turn into a teacup. 
I don't just like everyone else its a guessing game

Just had a feeling we would not sustain 10k right now

I could be massively wrong then you can all laugh at me

I am ready to buy back in as I sold the lot 
I have put, a comma there.
His dad is Mr. B.T. Coin and he runs this here operation, see?  If he says it’ll be 12k on a date it’s gonna be 12k on that date 
Not sure. It looks like we made several attempts at 10k Friday and Saturday. Just didn’t have the juice yet.  We’re still over the mcafee dick line though, so all is well. 
Imagine glass of water with a hole in bottom. This is bitcoin. If you have water in glass, without intervention its level goes to 0 with time. If you are pouring exactly the same amount as its exiting through the hole in the bottom then the level of water stays the same. If you pour more water, level goes higher, if less, it gets lower.... LEVEL OF WATER = PRICE OF BTC.... Hole in the bottom = mined coins .... pouring water = burning dollars to buy btc... Its easy if you imagine it... 
Yeap, anything can happen.  

Some big whale might just step in and sweep up 3,000 BTCs in one shot.
Now 2,300 BTCs.

Ok, nothing to see, come back tomorrow.
I bet you the fight is boring tonight
well  around 1200 btc been bought in 15mins but still didnt go over 10000k came back very quick
Well its being tested today.... could go either way

You have done well to stay strong so well done

If I was even I would get my fiat back and start again
Just going to have to figure it out mate. 
Nope. Just need to know how quickly we get there so I can decide if I need to take profit or not. We're going to $20k plus. But we can pause at $12k and come off 15&#37; or so. If we get there slowly I'll TP out a percentage and buy in lower again, if we get there fast it's not worth an attempt at TP and I'll just hold.

$10k and $11k are non events, we're just going to cut through them like they don't exist.

Absolutely: Breach is perfect English - it stands for something to overcome.  Militarily, a gap or weak point in a wall.

It DID hit 10,020 creep 
OK.  Explain to me.  How does a number, which is a rather abstract concept, go 'insane'?

Are you trying to state, incompetently, that the priced will rise?
You should have used permanent green paint.
You need to leave your computer and get some green paint from somewhere.  
This is Reddit you are not safe with them words
Yep. It's gotten a bit annoying, cause you can always tell that people like this don't know how anything works. Price manipulation probably happens, but this guy doesn't know how, when, where, who or why. 
[deleted]
Agreed.  There is short term and long term.

Would any serious investor put substantial money or resources, long term, into something that is provably dishonest, with a track record of deception?

What BTC has, with its history, decentralisation and technological momentum is trust.  Bcash investors are surely just opportunistic at this moment in time.


Bingo.  
Good for you hope you make lots of green

Never let emotions sway your decisions trade smart

Nope
Bezos is sending rockets into space. I doubt he cares about a small footnote in the "financial history books."
Did we enter a prolonged bear market ? No, it did 33&#37; for the month. Worst bearish signal I've ever seen. 
You sold during the dip? Okay good luck
you still don't sell on the local low. It is the same rules as buy in . Buy in dips, sell in pumps. Even if it drops it won't just crash down else it would have here already.
I think it's a good move.  

But you should have sold at 9.9K+ if you believe it won't go above 10k (I don't).
Ah, in that case...
Well FUCK me - you just invented differential equations!

400 years after they were first described.
Except it's raining so much it's starting a flood
Orderbooks can change within seconds. They are deceiving.
Hi there. Please could you explain how you work out how much needs to be sold to reach a set price? Excuse my ignorance :)
... aaand you lost.
The question was about what happens when it touches 10k.  The question was entirely independent of time.
TP?
You know your shit, please keep posting here I am interested in your opinion. :p
For example, what would you call fast?
**Cryptocurrency tumbler**

Cryptocurrency tumbler or cryptocurrency mixing service is a service offered to mix potentially identifiable or 'tainted' cryptocurrency funds with others, so as to obscure the trail back to the fund's original source. Tumblers have arisen to improve the anonymity of cryptocurrencies, usually bitcoin (hence Bitcoin mixer), since the currencies provide a public ledger of all transactions.

That's really bad advice. 

The blockchain keeps a public ledger of all transactions. 

If you transfer from GDAX to a wallet and then use this wallet on the darknet, the transactions can be traced back to you.
Ha, no, I'm serious. I'm just trying to buy some kratom from a legitimate online vendor. They stopped credit card payments temporarily for some reason. Thanks for the info though.

Yep. Iambic pentameter.

Well, Bitfinex.
[removed]
No it didn't. USDT doesn't count.
Exactly
The issue is not with alt trading per se.  It's the blatant wash trading that is happening.  

The challenge to regulation is that exchanges are dispersed and can't be done without cooperation among governments.  Yes - when that happens, prices of all cryptos will crash.
C'mon man, moment you took a bond on your house you put it into dishonest. Whole worlds financial system is dishonest. 

Bitcoin is also openly manipulated. It's no different to BCash. 
Really ? 
you tell me?
[deleted]
Thanks about to buy back in at a lower price

Buy high sell low?
Shhhh .... don't say such things.  It's bad luck.
I know sort of ruing that decision

But as you know in this game forget what happened yesterday....
Agree.  For me, it's just a snapshot of the sentiments.
Fight has not started yet haye v bellew


$10k and $11K went on Thursday. Only $12k matters now. 
Take profit. 
I've got a whole pile of people on my six who expects prophecies . It's not really worth it to post here. 
5 or 7 days.

Ok just to be clear here, I am not trying to buy illegal drugs on the darknet. No sarcasm or wink wink nudge nudge. I am trying to buy a legal product from a legitimate website whose credit card processing is temporarily down


Brilliant - thank you!

I wondered if it was to do with word stress.

Fantastic.

I have to say, the stress on the connector 'with' seems a bit unnatural.

But a market without shorting does? Why?
Ah.  OK.
And there your logic fails and comes crashing down.

Think about it.
I'm not doubting Amazon will get into Bitcoin, I'm doubting your part (which you have since edited out) where you implied his reason for doing so would be to make some kind of name for himself, or that bitcoin would take over credit cards "soon."
The dip is the lower price. You sold at the lower price
But it's not. It's used by whales to manipulate sentiments or to send signals. 

It's best not to look at them at all.
Us earthlings work on standard time.
You did call 12k on the 5th
Send me a PM then :D
The public ledger is there forever. If they didn't catch you now, they might catch you later.

They might never. But why take the risk, when there are ways to protect your anonymity?

Dude, 90% of BTC's trade volume is through alts.

Therefore it's silly to say that alt prices are manipulated and BTC is not.  The wash trading is happening right in front of our eyes. 
I said 15th to 20th. And it might not be $12k, it could 11.8 k or something that will greatly offend some "people" and it's likely we get there earlier which will offend a whole bunch of other arseholes...sorry meant "people".
He's called it multiple times. Ten days ago he said we would hit 10k last week and "To me it looks like $12k by Friday or Saturday." He loves making super aggressive calls that never materialize and then shaming others who don't make calls (because they rightfully have no idea what BTC will do, just like him). 

Best thing to do is tag Mr_P in RES so you don't fall into his BS. Go back and look at his old posts and you will see how often he is wrong. 
Not going to go there, sorry.  This whole reddit thing is taking waaaay to much of my time. Should be on my bicycle in the jungle.

No you said the 5th lol

As I said then I hope you are right
Looks like...

I might be a bit to aggressive, but I also know how far behind we are this year.
As far as I can remember and I'm definitely not going to go look it up, I said the breakout pattern closes 5th of May. We'll break out before then and from there it's hopefully about 10 days to $12k. 
You can't estimate the future value of bitcoin by "how far behind we are." Just three days ago you were saying 10k is a non event and only 12k matters, One day again you were saying the climb back up from 9.1 would happen "any moment now." Your calls are no more accurate than flipping a quarter in the air.  You have no idea what you're talking about. 

Recent quotes by you within the last week:

* "Wasn't wrong. We're at $10k. Going to $12k. NAV says I nailed it. All that counts."
* "Battle for $10k was over Thursday already."
* "If we don't make $12k I'll also be wrong."
* "we're a whisker away from $10k and it's likely to go this week-end"
* "$10k won't last long. It doesn't matter anymore."
* "I'm just wondering why people who can't make calls criticise people who do make quite accurate calls ?"
* "$12k is a week away if it is even that slow."
* "We're not going to $10k tonight, we're going well past."
It has been a disappointing week. When we broke out of that pennant it should have left the same way it came in. Instead the breakout failed and went to test support again, which so far has held. 

So now we wait for the next up leg and hopefully it will behave like I was expecting it to behave. 

Not a major crises. But disappointing none the less.
