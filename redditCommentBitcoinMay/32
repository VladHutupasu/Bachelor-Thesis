Daily Discussion, May 02, 2018 -- TITLE
Lol remember yesterday when it dropped to like 8.9k and everyone in here immediately starts spreading FUD that next stop 8k here comes the crash, etc. What’s the deal with that?  Such doom and gloom when btc has done nothing but defy expectations over and over. People in here are either bad actors doing it on purpose or are just children basically. 
My tea leaves this mornin said,consolidation is almost complete, rocket is 90% refueled, prepare for takeoff. 

I drink out of a large bowl
Rambling. I've been lurking on btc and bitcoin for a while and I feel like this subreddit tends to be more relevant to me. rBTC has more or less scared me off from contributing at all.

I've purchased computer parts, batteries and traded services where btc was a key transaction component (both direct and indirect transactions) and a lot of that stems from information I gleaned from lurking here, so thanks for being a positive influence for me. Maybe someday I can return the favor.


Slow and steady! It's been 3 months since we hit bottom. Onward and upward!
Need hookers and blow. Bitcoin, RISE!
Guys, think with me. Are we not witnessing the Wyckoff events in action?  Are we not entering phase E of the Wyckoff events?   What do you think?  Go to:    [http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart\_school:market\_analysis:the\_wyckoff\_method#accumulationwyckoff\_phases](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:market_analysis:the_wyckoff_method#accumulationwyckoff_phases)
Pay day this Friday, which will also be may 4th, should see a big jump on Friday, and likely a jump tomorrow as well in anticipation of said jump, so get ahead of them all and buy btc today, I just bought $800 worth.
This is what you call a well-rounded  argument... Bitcoin style. A proper, old-skool Twitter shitstorm

Gotta say, I'm actually really grateful there's been substantial support at 9k.
Hope it picks up soon. I want a Nissan.
Here we go ladies and gentlemen, hope y'all listened to my comment earlier and bought more while you still can
Looks like bitcoin just woke up. Rise and shine my friend. 
that was a good support line @ 9k. Time to get back on track to amili.
Told myself I wasn't going to buy any more and just wait a few months but I got a little bit more when it dipped under 9k
If you notice, anytime bitcoin approaches $9500 or close to $10,000; fees increase slowly.  If we haven’t learned anything from December 2017 and fees, we won’t get back to ATH.  Please adopt segwit and Lightning. The market will not give 4th chance.

What’s up with BCash?
Get the green dick paint out.
I accidentally bought too much bitcoin on gdax. Is there anyway that I can flip my purchase and make some money back? I went full retard on this one boys ):
Good morning all. 
Claymore, I like a lot of what you have to say but you need to stop saying “in my opinion.” I’m here to speak objectively on this matter and that may sound contradictory since this can be a very speculative subject. Are whales and institutional investors the same thing? Yes and no. There are several whales who bought large volumes of Bitcoin in its infant days and scored big. The Winklevoss twins are the perfect example of this. There are many whales who aren’t as savvy as you’d expect; they just own a lot of Bitcoin. They don’t have any connection to corporations and institutional investors like hedge fund managers, investment banks, mutual funds etc. This is what separates the typical notion of whales with institutional investors. They share many similarities and institutional investors can become whales but whales typically do not become institutional investors. Whales have been around since the beginning, institutional investors are new to BTC. When institutional investors fully mobilize with Bitcoin, we will see its largest gains ever because Bitcoin will finally have a keen sense of legitimacy. However, even today, Bitcoin is still being questioned and associated with labels like “pyramid scheme”, “black market”and “money laundering.” This is the biggest challenge for Bitcoin (and definitely not mining or hashrate as you unnecessarily brought up). Bitcoin was founded as an alternative to the greedy practices of banks and investment managers like Goldman Sachs, but it’s still perceived to be a get rich quick scheme.

Institutional investors will help bring credence to this asset class (the irony being that institutional investors are very shady people). Your remark about HODLers wasn’t necessary. I agree with you in the grand scheme of things, HODLers have very little influence over BTC’s price...but they do control their own wealth through personal decisions. Overall, you do have some good things to say; you’re just misinformed on institutional investors relationship with Bitcoin.
fun fact : in hungarian language the word "hold" means "moon" 
Switch BTC denomination to mBTC... The current state is causing price bias. That is, seeing 9000+ price causes people to have an aversion to buying BTC.

Big names really should start denominating the price in mBTC.
Looks like Bitcoin's working out at the gym for the next big match. $10k is suddenly looking like a fair shot. Other alts are taking much of the limelight for now, which isn't a bad thing *per se.* A lot of give and take between Bitcoin and the alts right now. At this rate, this rising tide just means we can all celebrate once we hit the next milestone of $500b market cap. Then it's party time going into summer!

Exciting times ahead.
**Bitcoin Bulls Seek Breakout to $10K or Higher**

https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-bulls-seek-breakout-10k-higher/

Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading in a narrowing price range over the past week, but a bullish breakout is looking likely, the technical charts suggest.

The cryptocurrency created a bearish outside-day candle last Wednesday, signaling the rally from the low of $6,425 had run out of steam. However, the bitcoin bulls ensured there was no negative follow-through on Thursday and defended $8,800 over the weekend.

While a convincing break above $9,500 has remained elusive so far, the charts suggest the bulls have the stronger hand going forward.

View

Bitcoin will likely witness a bull-pennant breakout and rise towards $9,975 (200-day MA) and $10,000 (psychological hurdle).

A daily close (as per UTC) above $10,000 could bring a stronger rally to $11,306 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from $19,891 to $6,000).

A downside break of the pennant pattern would weaken the bulls and expose support lined up at $8,490 and $8,104 (50-day MA).

Only a daily close below $7,823 (April 17 low) would signal bear revival.
Looking at all the moving averages and the recent "lower high", I'm afraid we're in for another downward correction soon.

I hope I'm wrong. I know I'll get downvotes for this, because it's so easy to downvote the messenger. I only try to be realistic...
Murica ruining the show again. Could you please not.
How good is investopedia for learning how to trade crypto? 
I would love to setup a mainnet Lightning node on my mac, but I do not know how to do command line codes, access hidden folders, or know what Ubuntu is.  

Is there a guide out there for people who aren't too tech savvy?  I know its alpha grade software and I may lose btc.
If we do go to phase E it is lambo time

I don’t get why the Daily Discussion exists. If the purpose of it is to filter out repetitive content from the main page, it’s allowing too many topics to be effective. What kind of posts are expected to make it to the main page that wouldn’t be appropriate for daily discussion? It seems redundant to me.
[removed]
I think most of it right now is because those people are shorters and they want it to go their way.    If you think it’s bad here, other trading focused subreddits are worse.   It is annoying though I agree. 
Arnt you doing the same thing with this post?
Look at the rise and fall in the 2013-2014 and compare to this rise and fall. Sure there are some differences but the fear is real.
It is one of the first falcon 9 rocket technologies we are using? Might be not too much fun at the takeoff then.
i think it will recover all that lost during the dip.
Looks like it.  But then again, I've seen it follow patterns until completely going to opposite way of prediction.  We shall see.
Once it became clear we're in an accumulation phase, trading has been as easy as looking at volume.
Unfolding of downtrend?

we are clearly in a pennant. You can call that a Accumulation Phase but it is not a classic Wyckoff reversal Accumulation pattern

Yeah.  It's real support, but somewhat artificial.  The price of the major coin is being fucked with big time.

But you can't manipulate forever - let's just hope the fucking around folks run out of money soon.

Bcash volatility is a scary thing right now especially if you’re a day trader like me. It’s not a good idea to daytrade Bcash, week trade may suit you much better (one trade a week). BCash has been stuck in the $1200-$1500 range for over a weeks. It’s pure whale manipulation via buy-sell walls maneuvering in forward and reverse directions. The whole concept from the whales is to psychologically test inexperienced traders and day traders using emotions and fear. The whales are being very spontaneous and confusing to get you to panic-buy and panic-sell. Of course the Bitcoin ABC fork is less than 2 weeks away which is the primary catalyst from our lows in early April. This is why BCash will not dip below $1200. The whales themselves fear institutional investors beating them at the own game, so they will not allow Bcash to crash until the fork is released. Also, the whales are challenging the Bcash market to see how ordinary traders respond within every surge. This far, they have been very disappointed which is why they continue to fluctuate Bcash in hope the market reacts differently. 
They have the potential for bigger blocks, they don't have them yet, just the potential.  Its like if we have a small boat that holds four people, and its always full.  Now johnny rides up with a 20 person pontoon boat, but its just him and his dog, Rusty.  If johnny ever gets into the ferry business, we'll need a bigger boat to compete.
You called it!
There is no such thing as "too much bitcoin"
Just hodl. You're gonna get back some gains when it reaches close to 10k
Set a limit sell at or above your purchase price if you absolutely must get some cash back. 
Well, that back and forth market depth is fun to watch on gdax at the moment. Got my pop corn and drink. 
Depends on when you bought it. You can just sell if you bought recently. If you bought in december and don't want to lose money id suggest holding on to it.
I just checked with the translator and it's correct lol
Fun fact: in australian language the word 'cunt' is a stand-in for any other word as well as an intensifier, and should be used at least twice in every sentence.
Hit em with the Hungarian Hold lol
On top of this.....I think the "Really Big Money Guys" will soon increase their allotment action.
Especially as more resistance levels fall.
This could happen rather quickly.
Consolidation zone usually means price will go up or down soon. The longer the consolidation zone, the more drastic movement will be. As the setup suggests, we will probably continue a bull run close to 10k
It seems I was wrong. Another great example of why I don't do daytrading. I would lose so much money... I hodl, buy the dips and wait. 
The price doesn't look all that promising to me either but w/e, its mostly gambling anyway.
If we all upvote you, would that be ironic?
I believe the correction just happened and it's why we've had sideways movement for a while. Just my 2 satoshis.
File under; comments that can apply to both bitcoin and global politics
I like profit tho.
Doesn't Roger Ver live in Japan ?
'Random' fluctuations in crypto are too common for there to be a real pattern that emerges that you can reliably trade on. The TA people will try to tell you otherwise but they are full of shit.  TA absolutely works in a mature and involitile market.  Crypto is neither for now.

The only pattern is 'randomness' (or what appears to be random to us, it's not really random), and the only certainty is that some coins are better off trading than others in case you get bags- don't trade coins you wouldn't also hold.  That being said, swing trading crytpo is *extremely* profitable if you know what you are doing.  
Bitcoin is more like flipping a coin than anything else if you plan on day trading.
The LND how-to's are very accurate and provide all the command line references you should need.

Ubuntu is a Linux Distrubution (Operating System superior to Windows or MacOS), but is similar to MacOS in that they share a common history and thus a command-line type. 

You can download LND binaries however without needing to compile, it's more stable this way generally anyhow. You can simply download, setup the config file to your liking, and run on Windows so should you desire.

Only do this on testnet of course until you've gotten your head around everything.
Alright I'll bight, What is phase E?

You can use a wallet like electrum, which connects to a remote node. Then you don't need to download the whole blockchain.

Bcash is pumping hard and it's worrying me
Yesterday to today, Bitcoin went up from ~$9000 to $9100, about 1.1%. Meaning in order to have made $300-$500 during this time, you would have needed $27,273 (~3.03 bitcoins) - $45,454 (~5.05 bitcoins).
if it wwere that easy nobody would work and they'd be on a beach making 200k per year doing nothing.
If you follow the McAfee dickline (https://fnordprefekt.de/), then you would currently need about 9 to 10 BTC to make 200-300 USD/day.
It all depends on your picks really. Trading altcoins can be kind of a crapshoot. It order to steadily make a predictable profit every day, you would really need to be picking winners every day. For example, if you put in 1 BTC into an altcoin you're confident is going to go up 5% that day and you hit that mark and you have a limit sell order set so you can immediately get out, there's your $500 right there. 
Scary AF, but in 2014 it was a lot less accepted or covered in the media.
Which exchange is getting hacked this time? Oh wait the markets are decided by random events so they can't be predicted by history.
market was tiny in 2014 and most people lost interest during that year due to the immense amount of fud
We know exactly where it's going. It's going to $12k and will break out before 5th of May or so. It's doing a consolidation pattern which is almost complete. It's how markets move. Any market. They sprint from consolidation to consolidation unless they are going parabolic.  Then they just sprint.

Am I spreading FUD by claiming I know that a small dip indicates a larger downward trend?  No. Decidedly no. 
Well yeah no shit. It's not a matter of 'if' it's a matter of 'when'.
Sorry for being dumb, but does this TA suggest that we will drop to ~$7,400?
Because star wars... duh.

They're cheaper for everyone due to blocks now allowing higher than 1mb through segwit (signatures not counted in block size limit) but you as an individual won't be paying less than the community as a whole simply for using a segwit address. 
Yes they are. I don’t know what you were doing but segwit is cheaper.  Miners don’t like segwit. 
Fascinating.  Please continue to contribute.

And this is how pigs get slaughtered. The margin funding is the sauce that gives that extra kick in the flavour!

> The whales themselves fear institutional investors beating them at the own game, so they will not allow Bcash to crash until the fork is released.

Assuming the institutional investors aren't already in the game, which I believe they are. It's just too easy to take the money away for them to just ignore.
Yeah, except that instead of letting 20 people on the boat each trip there’s nothing stopping 2 people with all their belongings (data) from getting on Johnny’s boat and using it to move house. He has no way of stopping them doing that, because all he cared about was having a bigger boat and didn’t invest in any kind of ticketing system.
Bullshit, its the pump before the fork. 
Heh :)  Thx mate.
I’m not stressing out at all 😅
Just bought $340 on accident 2 days ago. 
Lotta rumors I'm hearing that they've been in Bitcoin since last year. Regardless which story is true, they're a huge source of support. We just need to break that damn $10k resistance and start generating more headlines to bring back the normal joes and janes.
I was so very wrong. :-)
On the other hand, I don't believe that the correction will be drastic. The price seems to be gravitating around the "dickline". Would be fine with me...

If we manage to keep a higher low (higher than 8870) we'd still be in a general uptrend.

On the other hand, if we go up now to at least 9180, we'd have a higher high. That would be great!
Already got enough downvotes. Reddit is quick and ruthless. ;-)
We're still in a kind of extended bear flag. We need to get above 9350 to break free of that.

So bulls, here's your chance! Get us there!
lol
yes we had nothing to do with the Korean War ending
TA still works it is all just probability. 

In no market you can predict a events to 100&#37;. In normal markets you have repeating pattern, which are 70\-80&#37; reliable. In Cypto you have more like 60&#37; . Which is totally fine as long as you have good entry/exit points.   

In crypto you can setup trades a lot. Because getting stopped out even 5 times with a 1&#37; loss. Doesn't matter as long as you catch the 10&#37; jump.  

So you have higher uncertainty in the market but you can have a high risk to reward ratio in crypto. Which makes up for it. 
Hhmm what do you mean by “know what you are doing”? I’m asking because you said that the fluctuations are ‘random’ (to us) so isn’t it just like gambling?
I’m not looking into day trading I thought something more like swing trading or trying to time the market if I think an opportunity is coming 
i think it is best to hold it for a while right now. Maybe it will comeback in the top

That's so much better. Thanks I'm using it.
Why they hijacked it, why everyone is a paid shill / retarded spreader of retarded news and false hope.
Relax bra, enjoy it. 
It only takes a few million to pump it right now. It will become more and more expensive to do so. Plus there is hype around the hf right now. 
So.  You're saying that - if you invest in something that is going up.  And then sell when it is up.  You make money?

Well FFS.  **This is why I am on these boards!**
Tea leaves or crystal ball?

Plus I hope you are right
And before it does that... and I'm just asking for a friend... will it drop to a significant level, say 8700$ were one could board the train again, having exited said train a bit prematurely?  Again, asking for a friend!
And then? Let’s say you’re right, do you believe the price will drop after it reaches $12k? 
This is actually very true. Especially with assets that are non productive. Like bitcoin silver gold or even oil. It has no inherent value by itself

You aren't even using segwit address. Segwit address start with 3. Please start using segwit addresses. And set up LN channel so I can send you payment. Sending 500 sats to non-segwith address and not using LN doesn't make sense. 

Sorry bro. I doing this main for promoting LN. You set up an LN wallet/channel, then I can send 500 satoshis with 1 satoshi cost.

It's like Laundromat, but it washes your funds virtually.
This ^
Of course everyone here always talk about the prices of coins whether it is going dip or mooning. That's the priority of all traders here
More like the corner of a rehab center where they have throw away the key.
Your bot needs to stop responding to beggars.
No, the oposite. Just because it went up the day after does not mean it's out of the downwards trend yet. Might as well drop 300 tomorrow. 
My tea leaves say 9.5k.
It does but only when we fail the breakout here. We are in a pig pennant and inside that pennant formed a smaller pennant right now. If we fail here we will test the other end of the big pennant. somewhere around 7200\-7400$.

I am still hopeful we can break out to the top here but it is more like 55\-60&#37; since volume in the last moves was still low compared to the volume in the downmoves when we crashed.
My gf wears a cap.  

Looks kind of funny through an endoscope.
Of course, some institutional investors are already in but most are involved minimally. Institutional investors are still observing Bitcoin trends and waiting for it to hit rock bottom which it still hasn’t. Most institutional investors will not buy Bitcoin at rock bottom but at a more convincing bottom than $5900 (once the $6000 BTC resistance is broken, a new hell will break loose and the whales will be directing that crash course). Most institutional investors will actually buy when they see far more bullish trends and not the back-and-forth volatility we’ve been accustomed to the past few months. Institutional investors don’t like volatility. Once they see stability and bullish trends after Bitcoin bottoms at the $75 billion market cap ($4400/bitcoin) and recovers to $200 billion ($12K/coin)...that will regain confidence with institutional investors. From that point on, Bitcoin will soar to new highs $60k/BTC and a crypto market in the trillions. This is an inevitability but it will take time. That’s why those who HODL will be rewarded exponentially. But, most people grow anxiously impatient. Just like we have many slow Bitcoin days ahead, we will also have days when you can make thousands of $$ overnight. I made about $6K last night.
How you gonna fit all that LN in a tiny boat?
Fork doesn't change shit
Price has gone up just now. Try selling a portion.
or starting
Correct
There is a lot to that question.  Short answer is that no, it's not like gambling at all.  Doesn't mean it's not risky though. However you can minimize your risk if you look big picture.  If you are serious about swing trading or day trading you can message me and I'll DM you back.
Asking how to learn to trade crypto is like asking how to play the slots. There are some minor strategies you can use to maximize your chances but you're playing a losing game, you're going to eat every bull and bear trap that signals.
There is some market indication and trends that you can look for if you want to find the best time to buy bitcoin on that day. If your interested check out Krown's Krypto Cave. He does a 2 streams a day going over the technical analysis of the bitcoin/usd chart along with other coins. None of it's certain, but you can increase your chances a bit of buying at the right time with his techniques.
Holy crap, that's literally exactly what we're going through! That person developed a rock-solid analysis.
No, I said if you can pick a 5%, then you can get $500 with one Bitcoin. If it sounds like an obvious answer, then blame the question, not the answer.

Chances of it staying at 9k in the next month - 0%.  Chances of it dumping or pumping -100%.  And even then it could always get back to 9k when the run is finished.
Like 3 day from now, no it's not going to drop significantly. It will either bounce around resistance or support and that range is getting very narrow. 
I think it will drop from 12 k to 11 or 10 k but It will bounce back again
Probably about \-10&#37; maybe \-15&#37;. Like we just did. $12k is a significant level. If we go through that all hell will break loose. Going to be a tough one to trade. I'm still idling over what to do myself. I will see how it behaves when we get there. I have a week or so to figure it out.

It would probably be prudent to take some profits, but leave some exposure in the market, so if it goes apeshit you're still in and if it comes off you can buy more. Something like that. 
Ja....I'm not onboard with this no inherent value thing.

These are massive distributed networks. At some point they'll have more users than Facebook. There must be value there.

I also use these networks to move money around the world. Often. And the banks just can't compete. There's value there as well.

Interest rates on FIAT are near 0 anyway. Physical gold you have to pay to store and it can be confiscated at will.  So how does say USD or gold have more value than a network like this ? I just don't see it.

Oil ok maybe, but I drive a scooter and quite frankly can distill a potato or three into pure alcohol for that.  Fusion is coming anyway so even that has a declining value. 
Oh ok 😀👍

I love you, you fucking tickle me at times lol
^ That
How do you want it to differentiate?
Well I mean look at the 1 day. We’re out of the down trend
Well I’m not spreading...anti-FUD that I think it’s going up either. I always maintain I have absolutely no clue what it’ll do next. 
Oh, thank god.  I was worried for a second there.
Cool.  Looks like we're on a breakout!  Hopefully it holds.  Thank you for the info.
I'm sorry, but your assumptions are hard to bite.

> Most institutional investors will not buy Bitcoin at rock bottom but at a more convincing bottom than $5900 (once the $6000 BTC resistance is broken, a new hell will break loose and the whales will be directing that crash course).

Institutional investors are there to make money. 2K, 6K, 10K... it doesn't matter. For those who have access to billions, those prices are peanuts.

But there's one thing institutional investors like, and it's assurances. They like to make sure they will get their profit, one way or another. This is where Bitcoin still could fail.

I agree with you in the sense that Whalers will control the next crash, but in my opinion, the whalers are the institutional investors. In my opinion, they are already in the market, making money and moving their pieces into key places of this massive crypto-game. 

Why am I certain of this? Ask yourself. If institutional investors likes assurances, wouldn't they want to have control of the game? They will do what they have been doing in every market. Controlling it. 

Bitcoin is a scarce currency right? Control a large piece of the currency, and you will control the direction of the market. 

HODLER's don't control shit. They are out of the market. They have no influence on the bitcoin market value. Yes, some of them will probably get rich, but not that many.

> From that point on, Bitcoin will soar to new highs $60k/BTC and a crypto market in the trillions. 

Billions would need to enter the market for that and institutional investors are not there to inject value. They are there to profit. To take value out of the market.


>  I made about $6K last night.

Maybe yes, maybe not. Good for you, if true. 

Edit: At 4,4K, there's a large piece of the network hashrate which will disappear, since it will no longer be profitable to mine for a large portion of miners.

Yes, that's the strange thing.
how can you increase your chances if nothing is certain?
Fair cop.

Thanks, I'll be... I mean... I'll tell my friend to be on the lookout! He should had re-entered yesterday at 8900$! 
You just proved my point. Like Facebook their servers are simply worth what they cost to make. But since they are used to employ facebooks network on they become infinitely more valuable. But it does not have any inherent value so to speak.

Same goes with Bitcoin, it is just like fiat in a way. It has value because we, the network say it has value. And when we compare the two it is very clear what is the best money. Therefore our network will grow, and so will its value.

In truth it is the consensual agreement between the people in the network that gives bitcoin its value. As you probably know a UTXO is simply a piece of data that proves you can make it appear inside a different box essentially.

The same thing goes for a lot of different things too. For example government, there is no inherent value in it. It is the people's coercion or agreement that gives it value. One may have a collective agreement on taxing the people to provide a police force through the government, because the people think that safety is valuable (yet still that too is just an opinion). And some people disagree with the concept other people have of safety, for example is it safety to have a armed guy take plants from people who pose no threat to others, is that valuable? Probably not to the people who just want to be physically safe. But for some reason the police are tasked to do this.

Why? Because a network of people with the power to task them with it, holds the power to say that it is valuable.

Like we hold the power to buy Bitcoin and say it is valuable.
I'm sorry to disappoint you, fam. But I did ask for LN invoice/payment request. Man I feel like a shitty person now to make you sad. I'm so sorry. Please forgive me.
I love you both
^ The other thing ^
Options might include checking karma score and account age, as well as 'drive-by' address drops. 
Yeah the one day chart is very bullish 
As per usual the tea leaves were correct.
see today we have the breakout 5&#37; already. Yesterday was just the move to the top of the pennant.
Just reach the top of the pennant again. With "here" I did mean here in this move. You usually work yourself to the edges and then when you break the pennant you get the strong move\(compared to the moves in the pennant\). TA doesn't let you predict the future to 100&#37; but you can stay more relaxed because you can classify the moves. Which prevents panic buy and sell. \(FOMO/FUD\)
Knowledge of the market and how to read the charts. Rather than just blindly guessing based on gut feelings.
You trade the most likely outcome and having good entry point so you have a good risk reward ratio.  

If you only make trades where you risk to reward is 1:5. You can fail fail 80&#37; of the time and still earn money. 

You can sometimes have points which are 70&#37; \- 80&#37; to work out . There is no 100&#37; sure trade. Technically trading is mostly math. How you can fail a lot and still earn money.  TA isn't scam but traders who tell you that and that will 100&#37; happen based on TA  are scammers.
keep in mind they can also break down. They are just break out more often to the top.  Trading is a game of probability. yes we broke the strong downtrend channel with the last push up and yes this is a pennant which is usually a bullish sign. but when someone tells you

>We know exactly that that and that happens

you know he is full of shit.

As a trader you trade the most likely outcome and you have to be prepared for EVERY outcome because no one can tell the future. Else there would not be some poor CEO from amazon the richest person on earth. 
Never be able to call it exactly mate. Don't beat yourself or your friend up about it. But it is going to break out soon, if you want the ride get in.
BGD's always lighten the mood till they get shorted 
I love all of you.
I don't really think it's that big of a deal if it replies to someone posting an address. Why does it matter?
True indeed!
Some of the wealthiest people on the planet are traders. That pattern has something like a 75&#37; success rate. Especially on that time frame. They know it. You should know it. And it's in the direction on the fundamentals. 

It's a question of knowing your craft.
and wouldn't you say another good advise is :

"don't make trades based on 3 comments of a guy on reddit" sounds like pretty good financial advice too me.

At least on trading view you can check out the history of the calls people make. and how are we not at the top of the pennant where do you see 12k?

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/aRCmwczG/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/aRCmwczG/)
GROUP HUGLE.
That's not the problem. Beggars are the problem. Their comments get removed. Your bot makes that more complicated.
>Some of the wealthiest people on the planet are traders.

I don't say traders can't make money mate. I am a trader myself

but they would be by FAR richer then everyone else if it was that easy like you claim. If every trade of you has 75&#37; success rate. You just go 100 x on 10 trades with all your account. Again and again Billionaire in a month. richest person in the world in a year mate. 

If you read quotes about these top traders. They never make stupid claims like you do. 

>It's a question of knowing your bullshit.

would be a better slogan for you
I couldn't care less what other people say. This is my view. If you knew anything about pennants you'd be able to work out we're going to $12k.  We are indeed in the middle of the pennant. Your powers of observation is astounding. 
Top traders don't make claims at all. I didn't say all trades are 75&#37;. I said this pattern has a 75&#37; success rate.

This trade is about as sure as it gets. Take it don't take it,. Doesn't matter. I took it. 
If you mean that 12k is the target for the pennant if the pennant is valid. Ye but for that the pennant has  to have a valid breakout first. 
They don't make calls for you to trade but they do speak about trading a lot\(and write books\).  and you know there are 10000 assets and you find these patterns a lot. So you have enough opportunities. don't claim that this is a 1 in a million pennant.

Just become a billionaire in a year when normal rules of capital preservation and probability trading don't apply to you.
I didn't say you can't trade this. I am still long since 6450 with the rest of my position I have a problem how you make stupid "we all know what happens" claims. People like you give TAs the bad name. To show only one possibly and don't even mention what else can happen. Even your 75&#37; number came later up.
Lordy Lordy.  1 in a million pennant ? Looks like farking normal run of the mill pennant where I'm sitting . 

I swear, people are their own worst enemies. K, don't buy it. Sell all your shit. It's doomed to failure. Bitcoin going to zero folks. Heard it hear first. Bad pennant rising.
I said it isn't. It is just a normal pennant which you find every day in some asset since there are 10000\+ to choose from. 

Like I said in the other post I am still long but since I am not trying to mislead people on reddit. If you don't have a good grasp where you have to enter your position here and where you have to set your stoop loss. Then this is a pretty shitty point to enter the trade. 

better say nothing then telling people to "buy here we all know what happens" . 
He's just a piker talking big.  

You can ignore him.
