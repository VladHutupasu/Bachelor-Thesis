>Korea: Been in contact with source. Upbit was visited this morning by authorities and records were seized. **No finding of any suspicious activities. Investigation continues.**

Nothing like some news FUD after 1 weeks of gains 



Congratulations to myself.  I've successfully bought every Bull Trap since the ATH.  I bet if i wrote a book about my trading strategy it'd be a best seller.  One of these days i will be right!
Does anybody know what the school and transport system is like in Goblin Town? Also anywhere good to eat?
If this cascade of drops had started 24 hours later, and we didn't have the korea news, there'd be 10 "weekend dump" posts in this thread.  (And the dump started before the korea news, no?)

Sorry for the kind of shitpost, but just trying to remind everyone about confirmation bias, and retro-fitting news explanations.
Maybe I'm crazy but I'm filling my bags all the way down...  The deeper we drop, the more aggressively I'll buy. Every time I have eased up on my buying during times like this, I have regretted it.

Looks like the whole “Wyckoff Distribution” meme wasn’t just a meme. It’s real life. Oh well. I’m a long term holder so I will hold through anything. 
This gonna be low effort comment.

!long XBTM18 8460 1.5x

Just f*k it, it'll bounce somewhere. Good night, will revaluate in the morning.
Mtgox coins moved? Upbit raided? Hmmm.... [so it begins](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8h53jf/daily_discussion_saturday_may_05_2018/dyhmgza/)


I don't feel so good mr satoshi
Long position from $9290 a few days ago converted to cold storage.

There's really no way to lose as a patient bull.
!short btcusd close 8618

Probably gonna regret closing so early and trying to time that bounce, but this is my biggest win yet so gotta take that profit.
Finally bailing out of my underwater long from 9.2k. I accepted that I was most likely going to close at a sizeable loss, but I was hoping to exit on a decent bounce. 

I'm not entering a margin position until the dust settles now. It feels too latr to enter a short, and premature to enter a long. Just going to keep DCA'ing additions to my HODL stack on the way down. 

Longing 8550 on swaps, a technical bounce and all panic sellers are gone I expect it to move a bit and then it's better than not to have a position instead of fighting the bitmex 200 mhz server
Sometimes I wonder why I put myself through the stress of trading this market. Is the frustration and despair worth the fleeting moments of elation you get when things go your way? Overall I’ve done very well but today I’m just having one of those days...
So we dropped 5 hours ago, chopped around since then, and have an hour until we hit resistance again. Eerily familiar. 

RSI is between 30-50 on all time frames 1H and under, and also on the 1D. 2H-4H are still oversold.

Shorts have dropped since we dumped to 8400ish (buy pressure).
Longs are basically flat.

We've had a couple pump attempts that have petered out. I'm expecting another drop here, but 8200 should hold. We might even launch off of it, who knows.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/ABknjL7l/

I'm still holding my short. Stops are 1.5% above resistance.

I got skittish seeing longs opening up here by experienced traders, but I didn't want to give up my position prematurely. I opened a hedge long (20x @ 8430) and will stop out around 8300. I risk getting chopped both ways, but such is life.

Kobayashi is licking his chops. The one guy in the world who wants to sell lower. 
Nice dump. We reached the horizontal support at 8700 and the bottom of the downtrend channel we have been in since we failed to break 10k. RSI is oversold on everything except 12h and above. I could see a small bounce to 8.9-9k in the form of a bear flag. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/XcQHThPu/

Another possibility would be a h&s on the daily: https://www.tradingview.com/x/iHUyXZO9/

I am honestly confused about everyone talking about a bounce here \- doesn't this look like a bear flag on BFX 1h chart?

[https://imgur.com/a/VPqEKBd](https://imgur.com/a/VPqEKBd)

I think a bounce around 8.2k is more likely given volume profiles \- or down to the old log downtrend line...

EDIT: 1D chart to support likely bounce areas

Overall - not looking good.

Unless there is a drastic rebound by the end of today, a bull-trap will be painted into everyone's mind and then it will be a self-fulfilling prophecy.
If it looks like a bear flag and quacks like a bear flag, it's probably another bear flag
[https://imgur.com/a/0OStYFM](https://imgur.com/a/0OStYFM) 

How long has it been like this lmao 

accurate for today?
This isn't the "bottom" of this dump yet. How do i know? Kraken hasn't went down yet.
Ok who brought the bearwhale to the party? 5 periodic dumps of equal timing and volume? I've been watching these charts closely since 2013 and this is unusual, not your normal breakdowns.
Over the past few months I have made some of the best trades of my life thanks to the TA this sub made me aware to. I just want to say thanks. Good luck everyone, I hope you find peace. 


Best advice by far trading: make a plan and stick to it, and don't overtrade if it isn't in your plan. 
The last time I was this underwater was on the drop from 11.7 where I closed at about this point of negative PnL.

I also made the same mistake at that time about trying to relong every couple of plateaus.

[Still holding on](https://www.anotherbot.info/), have DCA'd down a bit but blew my load too early on that and can't lower it more or sink in any more funds.  But really, it's stupid to hold on isn't it.  (all you fresh longs at least make me feel less crappy)

When we broke the previous level of support I opened another small high leverage short, to at least re-lubricate my asshole.

!short xbtusd 8615 25x 5%
Sell in May and go away
though 8.5 is in theory a strong and super important support level.  BTC tends to overshoot to trigger the stop losses (stop hunt) before it will create a violent wick back through 8.5, so don't be surprised or overly shook when this happens.  This is in fact the best time to long-up if you happen to believe in this recovery in the first place.
Bear flag breakdown starting to look like a fakeout... it [broke down and then climbed right back on the support line](https://www.tradingview.com/x/4wFIEwcQ/)
Right now it's time for both longs and shorts to be cautious.

This will be likely bounce now or at $8,400, and it's either going to bounce a little or bounce a lot.

Sellers holding $8,650 would be incredibly bearish, but they really just need to hold $8,800 or even $9,000 in order to continue the downward trend.

Still holding my short and moving my stops to breakeven at $9,076 or so. 
CNBC Fast Money saying Bitcoin was a buy. That was your sell signal.

Haven't seen this many red dildo's together since I peeked in my mother's nightstand. Good lord.
Jesus, I don't have the heart for this shit anymore. I was getting so happy when we pumped to 9600. I'll see you guys in a few months.
Whats the fud? I been out the loop for a while

you know if the longs were not this retarded i'd totally long the shit out of 8.4-8.5k. this is weekly support and bottom of the daily cloud, but with the longs being this dumb i think we won't see more than $300 bounce at the most before we continue down.   
Shorts are actually closing and longs are opening while we're falling more and more, how much sense does that make ??
[deleted]
I was playing around with fractals and it looks like we're mirroring the downtrend from 11.8 to 6.5k (which itself was a mirror of the descend from 19.8k to 6k). 

The descent is currently stopped at the 0.382 fib, which is also the area were we bounced after the first attempt to the high 9k. I'm expecting a bounce to 8800+ before resuming the downtrend. 

I wonder how the consensus is going to play into this though... 


https://www.tradingview.com/x/E4p4R1rX/
Seems like a good time for a little snapshot analysis of the market.

We're pretty much on the resistance line from our descent starting yesterday. The range is getting really tight, with anything below 600 getting bought up very quickly, and anything up to 650 getting sold into extremely quick. The fact that we haven't dropped yet, and with everything oversold on pretty much every timeframe I think that'll we'll actually bounce here, and I have a target of about 8.7k

What are you guys/girls(?) thinking?
Eh, this is close enough for me. I'm buying a solid chunk now based on how hard this shit sold over the last few days. I'm looking to sell it from 8.8-9k.

Isn't this forming some massive down pole that should resolve itself half way? Merlin and Joyrider know what's up with that.

BTC: “I’m going to make you rich but first I’m going to make you strong” 
I want to go long, but it seems everybody else already had that idea... So I guess I'm holding my short for now.  

On another note, my XRP long from a few weeks ago just went red for the first time since I opened it. Despite losing money, I still get some sick satisfaction out of watching that coin burn.
Waiting patiently for a capitulation entry point.
I think we will go to the deeper depths now that $8,600 has gone down, changing my direction.

!short XBTUSD 8600 3.33X 100%
1h RSI below 20. 4h is @21 Long @8535

Edit: Target is around 8800 for support turned resistance

Edit: Exited early again @8610
Still in my underwater long from 9180. I generally trade longer timeframes though. I've become pretty hardened over the years, though the numbness does bite me in the ass sometimes. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
Well, Im down 50k from last night :/
No real bounce happening here that many are waiting for... which is worrying. Would be surprising if this keeps going further down without any reasonable retrace. Can someone confirm how the RSI is looking (sorry I am not much familiar with charts)?
We've retraced 40 percent of the five week bull run. Matches the retrace of the multi week bull that ended November 6 2017
There goes the ascending triangle theory..

https://www.tradingview.com/x/pubVv2xM/

Bear flag confirmed?
eh, this is just so weak. honestly just expecting another bear flag.  closed longs i opened because i need sleep and i dont trust this at all. ill re-long at 7.5k or re-short higher tomorrow
Well rip that was fun my alts portfolio is completely being demolished right now, unless we get back into the next bull run I'm not exactly sure how I'm going to ever get my money back from alts 
So in evaluating other crash cycles, it was interesting to see how similarly our most recent break from the log resistance in late April matches up with the first bubble of 2013.

In late July 2013, when log resistance broke at $87, price moved to $100 and then experienced a similar failed reattempt at $100 only to make a full retrace back to log level break in the high $80's.  This is exactly what we're experiencing currently - price has reverted all the way back to $8.5k where log broke.  In July 2013, price then recovered to make higher highs and we entered the second bubble phase.

While I'm *not be any means suggesting we're bound to repeat this*, it is interesting to look at the overlay of July 2013 and the current situation.

[Chart with overlay](https://www.tradingview.com/x/q2UJH99I/)
But I already bought the dip ☹️
!short XBTUSD close 8420

Edit: in the spirit of avoiding shitposting entries and exits, I closed my short because the selling pressure has risen to ludicrous levels and RSI is stupid oversold on medium timeframes. 

There should be a bounce sooner rather than later. 
At the risk of shitposting

Greetings from Munich. Been drinking all day and now walking into Munich’s sickest nightclub.

Sold all my futs, swaps, just HODLing now.

Gonna get laid and forget about Crypto for 12 hours
Closed my short at $8,420. Oversold RSI mostly. 

Edit: opened a long at the same price point. 

I'll sort out the bot stuff in a bit. 
Well, after sitting out a bit and missing the worst times and making a nice entry before the original BGD, I'm out. Said I'd hold unless we broke $8500, which we did. Taking my smaller than anticipated profits and taking a break while the market does what it does. Losing years off my life watching this shit. 

Those advocating for the repeat of 2014 are looking smart right now. I hope that this is not the case as I cannot handle Tone Vays I told you so's. 

Good luck everyone, I'll probably be back tomorrow.... 
Second red hourly candle was bigger (vol 5400), but the drop smaller than first one (300vs 200usd). Resistance getting stronger around 8800 as expected. 1h RSI is now finally oversold, so at least a moderate bounce is to be expected.

1h macd making a cross, but long way of flipping to upside. We've also made a clear lower low in both price and RSI, indicating we didn't get here on "fumes". Everybody is ready for the 8800 test.

Targeting 9050 to add to my short. 
No support whatsoever, apparently bulls were only joking with their 10k+ memes.
BRD just dropped. Wow.
How were we at 10k 6 days ago???
I'm just happy interest rates are flat so I'm not paying out the nose on my short (yet anyway). 
Well it was nice being rich for like seven hours
Very interesting few days heading into the possible "weekend dip". Touched 9k but had very few buyers. This is a crossfire boys 
my stop losses got triggered, so I'm out for now

8600 was a pretty heavy support point, with it down this can go a lot lower
EURUSD at it again fucking up BTCEUR longs. I swear trading anything but BTCUSD is suicide
Closed my short, expect a bounce here. we have a very steep descending wedge.
Rumor mill rn, but interesting nonetheless

It looked like this was more of the usual dithering and bear flag painting, so I closed my long at 8625. This might have been too early, but anyway I was up 1% - my personal daily goal.

!long xbtusd close 8625
Just noticed that the market broke back into the old wedge from a few days ago and actually dropped down through the bottom:

https://imgur.com/a/71sp71k

The market is currently struggling with the old support line that could prove to be resistance now. 
Opened a long earlier at 8480. Closed at 8650. Will re open if we can break through 8700 convincingly. Will short if we fall back to 8500.It’s looking like no mans land currently. Both buyers and sellers seem to be nervous.

Edit : Short at 8570, looks like this will break down. Stop loss at 8730. 
For anyone just logging on and not in the loop, we're about to paint a bear flag for the next 6 hours and then dump to $8250.  It's our favorite thing to do today. 
Update: Well we broke 8.8k pretty fast, we'll see if that stays broken or turns to resistance.

Been a little awhile. Still holding my "short" (80% in fiat) because I'll be really happy with my position if we continue this retrace.

https://www.tradingview.com/i/8S8nTtJy/

Here, I'm looking somewhat medium term. Key supports/resistances are solid yellow lines, confirmed both by price in the medium term and high volume nodes on VPVR. In blue, the diagonal support we've had since breaking the log ATH resistance. Takeaways are 8.8-8.9k is a place to look for short term support (as we just bounced off it recently), 9.4k short term resistance (with 9.2k another resistance, not pictured here on a line though).

Past that, if we fall off, the yellow dotted line could be a place to look for at least a bounce as well as it's a local high volume node and could be horizontal resistance turned support from the descending ATH log resistance.

My bias is towards further downward movement("trend is friend"). I chose OBV (orange lines) instead of RSI because RSI isn't incredibly useful in strong trend, though I do like it as a trend continuance sign though hidden divergence. Reasoning for that is that as a momentum indicator, many normal divergences, like bulls becoming stronger while bears still make new lows, could just be a normal pullback from crazy strong momentum to only strong momentum. So in that respect they can happen many times before the true reversal, and I try to mostly ignore them at the start of trends. OBV, on the other hand, basically gives a good view on which "team" has the volume on their side. This entire trend post BGD has been in an uptrend for OBV with relatively small fall offs; this period post 10k high has been the first time the OBV has been trending down for any significant period of time. The bears are the ones with volume currently, so my bias is also shifting bearish. Maybe 8.8k will hold though, and in that case this will just be a very short term trend.

One thing is if anyone is tempted to draw a H&S with that line I drew, volume doesn't really fit the pattern so I'm a skeptic. But I do think a break down of the support would obviously be a bearish development.

Theoretically (mostly as a complete guess - showing my bias here), it'd be plausible for us to form a flag here almost all the way up to 9.2k, so I'm choosing to wait for that to break before I'd really be comfortable with 8.8k holding. And even then I may wait for 9.4k. If we do keep falling, I'll be watching 8.5-8.6k closely, and following that 8.2k and 7.8k. Falling below those would be a pretty bad sign for the market *really* having bottomed out.
This is good for Bitcoin.
Shorts are covering: https://www.tradingview.com/x/1YXtLtc1/

Longs are climbing: https://www.tradingview.com/x/AdtGKDVo/

And we can't even break the absurdly steep downtrend line: https://www.tradingview.com/x/qsOCWkdx/

RSI is cooled off on the 15m-1h. 2h+ is still oversold, but the pieces for continuation are certainly there. Not a great place to open any position, but we should get another somewhat dynamic move shortly. I'm leaning down, and I don't think that's position bias. Break-even stops on my short from 9050ish.

Here's a chart comparing the drops after each macd crossover on the daily.

35&#37; \(2 Candles\)

36&#37; \(8 Candles\)

41&#37; \(7 Candles\)

22&#37; \(10 Candles\)

17&#37; \(5 Candles\)

The drop right now has reached 7&#37; and we're on the third candle.

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/mMm6GQjP/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/mMm6GQjP/)

8.2k or 7.8k would be good places for a reversal. I'll buy at both with tight stops.

Retesting the triangle breakout makes little sense now as we might as well reach the support. It'll be reaching the rising line even if it continues along the descending line.

Edit: Forgot to mention the bullish scenario in which it continues back up making another crossover. That would mean a clear resumption of the bull market. I personally believed that we were starting a new uptrend when we broke out from that descending line but I'm not that sure right now.
!long xbtusd 8520 1x 100%

let try again
Each day that goes by I have a harder time discerning the daily from a thread on /r/buttcoin.

Still more quality posts obviously but the sentiment and pessimism is real.
!long xbtusd 8430 add 2x 100%

Adding to my long originally from 8888. Average entry is now 8650 and I feel somewhat confident I should be able to close at break even from this shitty entry.

I’ve learned a few things during this drop.

First, keep plenty of available margin to protect bad entries and don’t panic close (hope I won’t regret this).

Second, controlling your emotions is just so important. My original entry was emotional greed and I was clearly not looking at the signals.

Third, I really appreciate you all in this sub for sharing your insights. Trading can be tough, but aside from it, I feel I’m growing as a person, learning to control my emotions.

Thank you all.

Well, I've chosen bad day to take a break...
I think this could bearflag up to 8900, so I'm going to close the short here to lock profits, I've not been good at locking in profits lately.  I might short again soon though depending on how things play out from here.

!short xbtusd close 8753

Have a new long visible on the [test site](https://www.anotherbot.info/).  Fucking risky and a little bit in the red. (btw it's ca on june is 8907, but the position bot doesn't seem to be getting my update)

During the cascading drops, I also had [opened and closed a long for a medium loss](http://bitcoinmarkets.atwebpages.com/history.php?user=veltrop), trying to buy bottoms.  It was stupid, but on the other hand, if I had held on to it and added to it, my margin would be in worse shape than where I am now.  At least the short more than covered that.  

Edit: well I opened a new little short when we broke down again.  Still have that underwater long.  Too busy to deal with the bot right now.
hi guys first post in here, quick question: next supports are?

about 8500
and 7800 
and the log trend line (around 7400) ?

or am I mistaken ? 

thank you for the help :)
CNBC or something picked up Korea news yet? Then it's time to buy some physical BTC again
8 consecutive red candles on the 4h - quite the psychological trigger (this hasn't happened in almost 4 months). Of course, this still doesn't mean that the price is going up from here. But I'll take it!

https://www.tradingview.com/x/S63MXUCj/
Anyone else have limit buys set around 7.8\-7.9k? 
https://imgur.com/a/vAvuFve

So this is a fun resistance line...
Long opened at 8350 an hour ago. The 50 day SMA always puts up a fight. All RSI are also oversold.
[deleted]
I'm just blindly ragebuying
I wouldn't go long here , i think that FUD is just starting and panic sellers will continue selling no matter what the exchange says but i suck at trading so what do i know

good luck
Slept through 8800. Kind of glad I did. Now it's just a question of going long with a bit of leverage or just adding to my hodl stack. If I long with lev, it will be at 8200. Will add to hodl at 8000 if I wuss out on that (assuming we even get there).

By the way, only a total newb would think this dump is anything but a buying opportunity. On April 24-25 we dumped from 9600 to 8500 which was $300 more than this current dump. What happened shortly thereafter? We tested $10K. This is nothing, dudes. Have seen much worse. Suspect this guy is short too, selling borrowed coins, in which case we will get a mega BGD when he covers.
First time checking in on price/ sub in 24 hours now that I’ve returned from vacation. 

##What The Fuck Is Happening  
well... moment of truth boys and girls. let's see if this 8.8k number is the bounce that so many have predicted
When will bitmex get their shit together. I can't even place limit orders their system is constantly overloaded.

Long here at $8530

RSI is totally exhausted on almost all time frames... will buy down into $8400 if we get there. 

Expecting an actual bounce and some equilibrium in the coming couple days
I know there's an altcoin thread and all, but I hope as many people as possible get to appreciate the whimsical hilarity of this thing:

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BITFINEX:EOSUSDLONGS

At least we're not *those* guys, right...?
If we go up to 8465 from here we would have an inverse H&S on the 15m.
Orite lads, your friendly neighbourhood druggo with a message to the ones that are currently shitting themsen.


Comme des fuckdown and zoom out lads. Come on, we've had five weeks green. One red week and it’s the apocalypse. Sorry but if youre panicking right now then you're either a pussy or too exposed to the market, i.e., you’ve invested more than you can afford to lose so either get a grip or scale down.


Personally, fucking loving life right now. Just had my last exam for the year, went better than it should’ve and now its summer lads. Gonna buy this dip and enjoy a weekend of guilt free fucking around. After that its back to hustling but with a sprinkle of summer fun, travelling, girls, weed and bikes. Lifes a fucking gift so live it and enjoy it.


EDIT; okay so i just saw this https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8im0o3/im_actually_considering_suicide/ and i thought id change my tone.

if you are panicking, call a friend or realtive or anyone. drop us a dm if you want. just remember, THIS IS TEMPORARY.

Also, on a slightly more cruel note (sorry...) link above is a buy signal for me.
I have to say I've always admired the courage of those who sell after huge red candles. 

Me personally I'm still feeling a strong fomo on the whole crypto market.
Well I said if 9200 broke, it wasn't far from 9k and once 9k broke, 8.8 would bust hard and 8.6 was just right behind it. Sorry to say but it looks like the floodgates may very well open.

So I thought I'd say this, I've been holding a 13M short (part of the same short I started in December) for a while now and that rise up to just under 10k was extremely painful but vindication of your idea always makes you feel amazing.
So we hit 8.5 which is good enough for me.

My shorts are 15, 17, 10, 11, 7.7, and 8 with an average entry of 10.2. We sure as shit got close to my average entry and you can now see why I wasn't sharing due to stop loss hunters on one of the largest positions on MEX.

Today feels great for the first time in a month of shitty days. At the top, I was down almost 40% and it sucked hard. So please everyone understand to play the big wins, you have to risk everything. :s

Edit: I mentioned it this morning but my position is 13M.
Is anyone else thinking about an orchastrated dump? With the potential good news / statements from NY crypto week, it just seems to be so "coincidental" that we get some major FUD right before this event and some big guys accumulating with "real" walls around 8700~~. I will try scaling into a long here. Might get rekt here but i think it's good r/r. 
Sky is falling, exit all the crypto
[January 11](https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/01/11/panic-selling-south-korean-exchange-raids/)

Time is a flat circle and they just switch out which exchange they raid.  I'm sure they [sell first though](https://news.bitcoin.com/south-korean-officials-caught-trading-on-insider-knowledge-of-crypto-regulations/).
Any ideas on what the cause of this drop is? Can't all be the Upbit Korea FUD. These audits have happened to several exchanges in the past and nothing generally comes out of it. 
Had been sitting in fiat since 9.6K, but we were way oversold on all time frames. Bought back in. Unclear if we'll see a deadcat bounce or longterm bounce into next week, but we will see a bounce.  Thanks panic sellers ; )
Sold off my long again right as we dropped off the line... I should be shorting at this point, no?

It's just so *completely oversold* here that I can't help but attempt one more long position to catch the upside once this turns directions.  I'm convinced at this point that we're due to visit $7400, but not without some temporary relief first from this massive sell off.

I managed to catch $8400 on the nose which isn't terrible... I'll scale additional buys down to $8200.  Leverage isn't crazy so can wait out the bounce.

Safe trades everyone... lots of red on the charts these last few days...definitely a seller's market right now.

the tight 1d bbands everyone was talking about has finally been breached on the lower line by the way. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/3ACySGrF/

I am now watching this big symmetrical triangle along with the downtrend log line to see where they converge. I suspect a breakdown below $6k will happen *if* we break below the triangle and begin to follow the log downtrend line again (even if we're above it the whole time)

https://www.tradingview.com/x/pmtHMSdj/

edit: this sell pressure is just insane.

edit2: edited for clarity- not calling for $6k breakdown just yet. Just saying that's how I think it will happen if it does.

Anyone take a particular non-obvious step to manage risk?
Surely 8600 is the number we should be watching no? This was the last major support after the blowoff from 9.8k. If we drop below 8.6, then we’d have problems.
What is your trading strategy? Anyone expecting it to go sub 8k, especially if 8.7k does not hold?
1000+ buy wall eaten on Bitfinex.
any courageous dip buyers today?
Downtrend [resistance lines to watch](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Eem5ZGyH/) in this recovery attempt.
I’m long from 8800 40k contracts (a little premature I’ll admit), and I don’t see this bouncing tbh.

I’ve got a long in place with a tight stop, but one weekend dump seems to be in the cards before whatever happens next week.

I would however like to understand who’s long and who’s short. So if you would care to share your position and sl, I think it would give a good market sentiment for those who are scratching their heads.

I personally don’t believe anyone will be stop hunting based on this, but if you think so, I guess omit your sl

Also, is 0.01% the lowest that funding can go or is lower possible?
If any of you mega whales (10,000+ coin) holders that lost it all, even early on,  and you want to make some of that fortune back...write a book about it...I will buy the shit out of it.
To anyone short from between 8.8-9.anything - are you closing your short here or holding on? I'm a bit worried about how big a bounce we might get and debating whether I should set stops at break even or to take some profit at around 8.7/8.8.
Us dude here that enjoyed lending out some BTC on finex last year to margin traders. Any other exchange I can do that from US that has decent liquidity?

Anyone banking on a short squeeze to bail us out of this drop is not reading the charts.
It's fairly obvious now that little run was just a mini bull in an overall bear market. I think we'll test the 2018 lows and most likely break down. 
Possibly confirming the descending trend line as support here around 8700. That would be quite bullish.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/45ZXgvhw/

Might consider to add to my long from 8888 here. But will watch this a bit more.
very convenient time for exchange FUD , i won't be suprised if it will trigger futher sell\-off just like that binance BS we had in march.
I posted about a H&S on the daily but i think there was one on the 4h and the neckline already broke down. It's not symmetrical and the slope is up (so usually it performs less well) but the volume profile fits. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/endvToZo/

I will wait for a retest of the neckline (around 9k) to open a short.
For around the last 4 hours we've been testing the 8650 mark. Is there anything significant about this number, Seems an odd one to find support, if you can call it that.

Edit - I'm cursed. Obvs.
Too much fud. Sitting on sidelines until this clears
Wtf is going on? Is Bill Gates shorting?
The drop is currently at 12% from our 9.4k high which equates to our initial drop of 12% from our 10k attempt. Unfortunately, my buy didn't trigger, but I'd say a bounce here is highly likely of at least 200 points or so. For people buying the dip, the trend is clearly down, so use tight stops. 

Good luck, and don't forget to use vaseline!
The EthBtc ratio continues to hang in there through these dumps. Makes me wonder if things are going to unexpectedly break upwards shorly.
6th leg down anyone? :( wtf
So I didn't want to admit it at first, but it looks like the CME futures market is driving this movement. CME runs on normal market hours, and when the their market re-opens it tries to "fill" the gaps left in the price while the CME wasn't open.

@ParabolicTrav who is famously bullish long term has been calling these pullbacks to the penny using this method. He has been saying we would pull back to 8550 for a few days now.

Sold all again, not worth it. Seems too dumpy dump to me. Might actually drop to $6k.
Hey. At least we’re seeing some volatility.
I've been doing calculations on wallet growth for Coinbase.  By my estimates at the current rate of growth coinbase will have 32 million users and 120 million total wallets by the end of July.

In the past they doubled their user count every year.  Now it is happening at a pace of every six months and that rate is still accelerating.  If we get to a pace of doubling every 3 months they will add more users in a quarter than the total users they have right now every single quarter in about a year.


Is that double top that was being talked about confirmed?

If so, we broke the neckline at $8,800 and the target would be around $7,800.

Edit: 

Volume profile also matches up nicely. 

First peak had higher spikes in red volume than green. Second peak had declining green volume.

Wtf is bitcoin legacy? We got enough FUD already. I guess Ver just couldn't resist sending sock puppets to make silly comments like that. Bcash is a cancer.
What does oversold mean?

I heard it bandied about here a lot over the past few days, specifically at $9100, $8800, $8600 and $8400. 

Does it mean that people aren't finished selling just yet (i.e. aren't over it yet), and plan to sell a lot more? Because that's what's been happening relentlessly for the past several days...
!long xbtusd 8888.1 3x 100%

Missed the whole shorting party since being out of position for a while. And opening a short here seems reckless. I think the only sensible thing to do is going long here considering it’s a fairly major order block, and we’re more oversold than we’ve been in quite a while.

Edit: Stops below 8.6k
So apparently last years conference produced some significant price movements. Can it be assumed that if this year is different, that other references to 2017 etc are valid? In other words, would it mean that this year in entirety, things are now different. I ask because there are so many references to past and many say things are always the same? Are we expecting a surge again?
At least we are seeing walls are real.
Some huge fills for whales. 2000btc being eaten into on finex
So much emotion.... I’m going long. Can’t see this dropping past our first major S/R level around 8400 without a bounce. 
Scalping. I expect a modest bounce now. We have seen too rapid price drop and it's showing on the RSI. Hands-on (manual) "stop-loss" though.

scaling in a new long between 8.1-8.4k. 8.2k should be solid support and we're already very extended so expecting a decent bounce
Someone call Thomas Lee
Thanks to Upbit I added some BTC's and some ETH.

Fast down but also fast Up.


Thanks!
This should bounce hard off of the 8.5 support range shortly which corresponds to the S3 support pivot I mentioned before on the weekly chart.  I am scaling in long from here down to 8.3k.  I have been watching ETH for it to complete some of its own consolidation before I felt comfortable expanding my long here, which it has -- PSAR on daily went to sell, which in a bull market means 'ready to buy the dip'.
Remember when some tool in here called u/MikeXBT a contrarian indicator for his short.

lol

I wish people could resist FOMO better
Looking exceedingly bearish. Not buying anytime soon.
The 1%'ers did not get to where they are by playing fair. Far from it actually. When you got people like Soros, Rothchild, Rockefeller, and Goldman sacks involved, how could you expect anything less than HUGE bulltraps and short squeezes. 

How convenient, a Korean exchange was raided and we are getting goxed for like the 10th time if feels like. Your puppetmasters who you folks insist on serving are flexing their ability to show why they are in charge. 

The wealthy minority rule us because they feel as though we are incapable of living without their influence. Satan really is the ruler of this planet. 

TlDR: go ahead and sell if you must. Your overlords thank you for doing exactly what they wanted. Hand off your coins at a discount while they continue to store BILLIONS in BTC in underground bunkers.

Edit: If this article doesn't inspire ya to HODL, than your likely doomed to keep falling for the elites tricks. I'll HODL till moon or BTC hits zero. Everything else is just noise to distract and manipulate those who are easily influenced.

here comes the bears screaming "i told you so" when just 2 weeks ago it was the bulls screaming "i told you so" when we were tapping $10k....

love the polarity of this sub keep it up boys
[deleted]
Adding 100% more stack to my original long position.
Long @8682. Simple reasoning. Price level here is horizontal support on the daily. If that gives up it looks quiet bearish and I expect this to test 8200 if 8.6k breaks. I put a stop @8500. 
We filled the most recent CME gap at 8550 (gaps are the yellow lines). We are free to move up now.

https://imgur.com/a/OINSlII
according to the 1D bbands this might be just the start of the real big drop most of us expected to happen. 

4h and 6h RSI indicate that a technical bounce must happen soon... but I am quite sure we have not seen the bottom yet. 
Pretty happy with my trading today. Already had one previous successful short. 

Just closed my short from 8570 posted an hour ago at 8380. Opened a long at 8390. Saw it drop to 8350, almost paniced but I’m holding on & seeing what happens. A thousand dollar dip in one day is A lot for BTC. I expect a move up to 8500-8600
Those of you selling right now are cannon fodder to the big boys.
Gave you before anyone else info about MtGox / Kobayashi on this thread and got downvoted for it by idiots

Now it’s all news in the media on CCN

LOL who is laughing today

I was just trying to help you guys



Today's new candle on the 3d is pulling the chikou into full bearish territory on this chart. Provided we stay above 7.7k, a weak bullish TK cross is due with a recovery target for this candle of approx 9.5k. 

3d: https://www.tradingview.com/x/Oj5QBooR

That close will coincide with the weekly, ie this Sunday. There's space for a few candles on this chart to drop back to 6k levels without entering bearish territory, but the lower it goes the further the recovery target gets. In absolute terms, however, the kumo targets seem reasonable as do chikou-kijun targets, just not chikou-price.

1w: https://www.tradingview.com/x/1nieRioc


Given that we're not at 5k rn, I'm beginning to think the bear market is currently experiencing its death throes and that the weekly will proceed to jump off the kumo shoulder. On these higher time frames and after the Q1 price action, the bearish and price discovery scenarios are hard to distinguish. Monthly recovery target is 10k by Jan 2020.

Woah, rough prices to wake up too. Good thing I put some S/L's up.

Yesterday I was flirting with the idea that our bounce up towards 9.3k was potentially a bear flag as a contingency plan (I thought we'd go up more, but alas, such is life.)

We are currently bouncing from the lower support line of our descent from 10k once again. I'm curious to see where we bounce from here, but I wouldn't be surprised if we're just developing another large falling wedge. The upper boundary of your downwards channel is at 9.1k-ish, though I don't think we'll get back above 9k and I see multiple resistances around 8.90-8.95k as a target for the bounce. I have the target of the bear flag at around 8.5-8.4k. I'm not buying any dips until we get anywhere near those levels, or if we manage to break the upside of your channel. 

To be honest, the bullish argument has substantially weakened with this drop, and whilst there's no case for a sustained bear market before we make a new low, I'd advise caution as the price is looking pretty heavy, and there's still a substantial amount of longs open which could get squeezed. 

Good luck all!
So I've been short since 8900, not as good an entry as some but not bad. I think this has really got some room to drop here, buyers seem a bit spooked by this recent move down. The longer we stay below 8800 the more confident I am that the short term direction is down. I will be watching 8200 and 7600 closely. Be careful out there everyone, this is a difficult situation to read. Still bullish long term but otherwise pretty bearish. 
At least the measurement of low comments vs big move coming soon still works super well
5x long at 8.4k, thinking there will be a quick bounce here for a scalp, RSI is pretty oversold on shorter timeframes.
what is crazy is that the weekly RSI never got below 43.7 in this whole bear market...
Just entered a long at 8443 with a SL at 8349. 4 hour and 2 hour RSI is sitting at low 20s so I'm assuming that it'll go up a few hundred at least for a bounce. Let's see what happens
that 3500 btc wall at $8200 is most likely there to get raped to cause panic 
I shorted at 9900, but covered most of my short on the way down, and it was also a hedging short against my cold storage alts.  So considering alts dropped 15-20%, while BTC dropped less than 10, I still got massacred.

It's tough to be right about the market direction, but not manage the trade well.  I just expected a bounce much higher than we are now.  I tried to scalp some bounces and instead too some significant losses.  Oh well, them are the breaks.
Panic Sellers never cease to amaze me. Some poor soul thought it was a good idea to sell at 8680 on this dip.

lol
This drop is pretty ugly and will certainly fuck up a lot of people's strategy. I have been out of position since shorting 9.3k and closing @9k. And now I just sold my non-cold storage coins on the exchange since I was still in profit. I definitely plan on re-buying at some point, but I'm looking where this is going first.

IMO this down trend is just a consequence of failing to break 10k and than failing again and again to break 9.4k. The resistance there was crazy and I'm guessing the people who pushed us up in the first place were the same that filled the sell book there, aka taking profit because the bulls ran out of steam.
The lack of support at 8,800 is really worrisome. All eyes on 8,650, if that fails to hold this entire run up from the last month was just a huge bull trap. 7,800 will be our last support line before falling back to a continuation of the harsh bear season.

I'm not touching this with a ten foot pole until we get a clear signal that bulls still have faith.
Smell of blood is rising. I feel its closer and closer for me to make my move. 😍😍
Can't help but feel this is going back to 9k soon.

FUD was fake and badly timed which exaggerated a sharp move down.
I think bear market is far from over.

Long in case I’m wrong, but if we don’t push above 10k in the next 2-3 weeks, get ready for sub 6k over the summer. Remember the traders limmerrick

[“Sell in May and go away”](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sell_in_May)

Last year we dipped from 2700 all the way to 1750 over the course of the summer before resuming 3k in August and busting to 5k in September
Damn, many of the alts are down 15-20%.  This is such a crazy market.  Such bullshit...and yes the same is true when they are up 15% on nothing.
Another 2000 coins @8700. Someone is really accumulating here.

Maybe I'm wrong, but feels good man ...
The last time the hourly rsi got this low was April 4 around $6600. The bounce off 8800 is ready to go.

edit: in the last hour the 4 hour rsi is now back to april 4 levels as well. With all the news about to come out tomorrow and continue on through the week it is perfect timing for the rsi to low, more room to run.
Upbit may or may not have the coins they claim & are being investigated under suspicion. 

Panic.
Tether is your friend.
Opinions on this now qualifying as a double top reversal?
Going long at 8530 here. We've been red for most of 5 days. I don't see this getting much lower. 8200 seems possible but too optimistic.
Long term Hodlr here, been taking some profit over the last few days. I think we haven't had the true boredom of a true bottom. Market will retest 6k and wont rally until October, as is tradition.

I was just looking at the site of positions and realized a long close / stop trigger that I thought I posted didn't actually go through. I think I was in a bad signal area at the time so there's a good chance it was on my end. I don't see the comment in my history either. Anyway, hopefully it works this time.

It's really just a question of when, not if, Big Shorty covers and how much of a loss he eats when he does.  I expect a BGD sometime today, but I'm not trading on it.  Still hoping to buy cheap.
This is the thing, I fully understand why people got optimistic in the last few weeks ok. After months and months of downside seeing any surge upwards in price was nice to see. 

But the amount of people openly stating that they think the bull market has returned or that the bear market is finally over has been ridiculous. So many people just seemingly running out of patience and using that as the reason why they think the bear is over. 

It just looks like people got bored of it and decided for the sake of their own mental well being, that we are back to a bull market. 

Now i'm not saying anything about today's price action but we are most certainly not out of the bear market yet. We went short term bullish that's for sure, however anyone who thinks it's the next bull run right now is sadly delusional. 

I want the bull market to return as much as the next man but can we please try and keep emotions in check here. Best case scenario right now is bear/neutral market. 

Maybe this weekend really will be the important marker for the direction we go in the next few months. Blow down to the low 8s by Monday morning and we'll soon find out how strong this apparent bull market really is. 
I'm not surprised to see us heading back towards 8k. 8k is a magnet. Big news is going to need to happen to break out of the 6k to 10k range. I'll buy below 8k and sell the shit above 8k. That's my only n00b plan I can muster.
Adding to long... on support level now and bull div showing on 1hr... I think we've found a short term bottom
I think this is related to Upbit.

If true, I think it's actually good news, with a bad headline.

Tis the Bitcoin way ...
Looks like a dead cat bounce.
Shorts are Happy with this " surprise " Upbit news.

I'm happy to add at these levels.

Thx
Longs on BFX haven't really started closing, and shorts haven't really been opening. A lot of unleveraged sells, read into that however you want. This seems like an Alt led crash, maybe in response to Upbit but that might be just looking for something to cause it.

Binance has already wicked below 8.7k.
the Upbit news seem like FUD that was placed right in time to get BTC below 8700. It sounds stupid, stealing money from users accounts? This is the dumbest way to make money from the largest Korean exchange. 
That buy wall at 8500 on GDAX will probably be sold into. A lot of liquidity for someone wanting to exit a big position. More or less these days I have no hope for buy walls.
we are breaking out of the wedge, expect an incoming bounce now!
Guys, it's my fault. Whenever I open gdax it drops, so I'm going to hang out in /r/aww for a bit. Let me know how it goes.
So what do charts and resistance/support levels matter if everything is driven by some guy who wants to unload every 6 hours?  I guess all it could tell you is when all the chart watchers might start to panic even if the breach of a critical support level was completely artificial and not reflective of most players in the market.

 So let's say i am shorting 1 btc it drops 50%, am I supposed to sell my short position, and then short again now that afford to short 2btc(assuming I still believe it will still drop), or does the short gains come out the same regardless?

I know this is probably a dumb question but for some reason I can't make sense of the math in my head lolol

I used the numbers that I did to try make math easy, don't believe it's gonna drop that far.
Hoping we can get under 7k by Monday. 
don't worry we are consolidating: https://imgur.com/a/UmRXumf

also alts took a good chunk of bitcoin in the last couple weeks. bitcoin taking back by blood.
You guys have too much faith in buy walls.
So we might finally get the 8600 test I was hoping for, if this turns into support things looks good for bulls.
If there is something that I know about crypto and news panic is that either of you sell directly or not at all and wait it out 
Shorts are starting to close.  I wonder if there might be a significant bounce on the 1 min where open shorts try to capture profits.

Some tips at mex since they changed the servers or some other shit, I tried open several positions with no change in the UI, and no warning whatsoever and I refreshed the page to see if it was some bug and man, when I looked at the orders I had like 10 orders at the same price, if I didn't look that I would had lost a lot of money in this play, so be careful.

My theory about the price drop: hashrate is down as the network is adjusting to dragonmint miners. The hashrate has been correlated to price.
Are we gonna break through the 7k support line into the confirmed bear cage?

If so what is the next psychological bear market support? 6k? 5k? 4k? or even 3k? Surely can't go lower than 3k.

Does the fact that this bear flag is ascending triangle make it more likely that it will break upward?
[removed]
Here's how I see it playing out:

One more big, grand dump, possibly dropping the price a hundred bucks.  Then covering.  Big covering.

The sell walls are getting smaller which tells me somebody is running out of ammo, but I'm sure they have enough to go out in a blaze of glory, temporarily dropping the price.

It's easy to move the price if you have enough money to waste.  Very difficult to move the market, however.

Hoping to buy at $8250.
This place is funny.

2 days ago I was downvoted to oblivion for stating that the price will likely continue to drop as interest in crypto in general has been declining month on month now since year start.  No need for TA and drawing lines on a chart, you can't argue with facts i.e. no media hype, search trends down, twitter activity down, many in january being burnt and never coming back to crypto, viewing it as a scam now.

And what is happening now...down and down we go.

If I were the shorting type, I would do it right now.  The big dumps have been 5-6 hours apart.  Last one was about five hours ago.
this wedge is gonna break down in 2 hours. 

Edit: could break up as i just saw an ascending triangle. still a move is gonna happen within 2 hours.
Must be really frustrating for the big dumpers to waste hundreds of millions of dollars and not even drive the price down a thousand bucks. 

Does anyone really think these dumps are not manufactured? 

So I'm in this trade now, and it will probably be a loser, but it's OK. I'll buy back the lunch money I lose... not giving up yet though. This could go right back up in a hurry.

So I havent done the math of computing how much one needs ish to break even on mining this Bitcorn^TM but someone said it was just below 6K ish last dip so I imagine alot of miners will shutdown as mining is no longer profitable after going under that price (which will adjust ??). So transaction time and queue might stack up and this thing dropped like a hot potato. 

So my guess is that when this gets as cheap as people feel that they just have to buy this corn then we might bottom out. But for sure going under 6K will be bearish AF and a doomsday target of 1.2K to 3K ish is achievable, but were not there yet but I think we will se soon if it all holds up. 
[deleted]
Think we can see a temporary reversal here, the rsi is so low and we're at the lower daily bands. Wouldn't go long here, but I'd wait for the bounce to short. This broke down way too hard for me to believe its going back up over 10k.  
I'm 100% out as of 9.1k and I've hedged my bitmex stack
People are really selling before the Consensus? The balls on these guys. Everything point to a bullish crypto scenario and suddenly everything dumps for no reason? Manipulation at its finest. 
Are we retesting 6k or are we gonna break through that?

What's the latest news with tether?

So this is a bear market and how do we know those temporary rises to 10k are not bull traps?

Are the a whales gods punishing me for pretending to be a bch shrill last night and/or thinking of botting up into shitcoins? Cause it sure does feel that way.

If a profit from the core would like to 6-conf I'll happily change may ways and we can break 10k.

To keep the mods happy, the 5 red dildos volume spikes I see(4k,4k,7k,5k,4k) I believe are comparable to the 21k volume of the apr 12 green dildo; Don't know what to make of it besides "whale games" but it seemed to be a reverse of that as both were roughly 1k price moves that where fairly sudden; 20k x 1k profit for a month of holding maybe, for a very very happy whale?

Just went all in. Time to stop being a beartard and become a bulltard. Entry has not looked this juicy for a vey long time. Expecting at least 50% up within the next 10 days. Suddenly, everything Tom Lee stated starts to make look sense. Also;

I’d not long this. While it might be a panic drop, it is possible we correct 10-15% further. Margin traders are at serious risk here. I’d short term long alts if they correct 30-40%
Wasn't it Luuc Meester who said BTC never ever below $10k again in May? Lololol. And the other one, whats his name, Tom Lee, predicted 70%+ up before the end of next sunday. Lololol.

I'm wondering if Iran evading US sanctions with bitcoin has finally turned the government against it and in order to gain support has tipped off the US megawhales to start selling because they gonna shut it down.


This is just the beginning of the big crash that is about to destroy and crush souls who thought they were going to be rich. No, plebs, bitcoin wont make u rich. The elite wont allow it.

It look like.  A lot of Bitcoins has been dumped since the evening of May 10 2018 and bought. It look like one party is dumping and other party is buying. They could have negotiate and sell and bought through brokers rather going through Crypto exchanges. 
So let's get the word out and we'll be back at 9k+ before we know it. The same happened with the fake SEC FUD, went down quite furiously but when people realised there was no meeting at all we went back up quite quickly.

All you eat in Goblin Town is red dildos
The bitcorn for $10 is pretty good 
There are no schools in Goblin Town, cus nobody ever wants to learn. As for food, I heard there's a pretty upscale place that actually serves water with their stale bread, but mostly it's just dry ramen noodle joints. 
I can recommend the bull steak.
The school is open only to blind HODLers and the transport system consists mainly of lifts (elevators) that only go down.

Food is dogshit sandwiches.
I've been watching this space long enough to know that general sentiment posted closely mirrors the current price action. Everyone is bullish as the price goes up, and bearish as it drops. As we cross over from one to the other, anyone who was bullish will downvote the heck out of the bears and vice versa. Everything is an excuse why it isn't going their way - Whales usually, but then its chinese new year, koreans, etc. Sometimes the news is enough to give the market a shove in a general direction, so its not always invalid, but most of it seems to be grasping at straws.

Furthermore, most of the TA charts are bullshit. We have Japanese clouds, astrology picks, giant shapes that look like nutsacks and bras. That said, some indicators are pretty good. RSI, MACD, etc work well if you can apply them correctly. Problem is, people are using TA to justify their recent buy/sells instead of buying and selling based on valid TA.

tldr: You really can't trade based on advice posted here. But if you do, do the opposite. When everyone in here was taking out long positions in the last few days, I exited most of my holdings (on the 8th). 

if the CEO of your exchange was investigated for fraud and raided by the police what would you do?  Look at a chart before deciding to withdraw?
Just be prepared and set expectations. Nice-n-slow ... don't blow the load.
if your target is end of year, you'll be pretty happy.

Something something getting off Mr. Satoshi's Wild Ride.
Too soon. 
don't worry, Mr Satoshi love you long time
Really nothing against you or your decision here, but seeing " There's really no way to lose as a patient bull" just gives me chills. Past performance does not indicate future results, this mentality could *really* hurt a lot of people in this space \(despite this obviously not being what I want\). 
Here's a good way to think of it:

If $8,500 does break down, it's not likely to be the last time that price point is seen: even in the near future. 

A drop to $8,000 or $7,800 would likely bounce back up to $8,500. And if you find yourself nostalgic for your short at that point, you could always re-short the next major bounce and probably wind up only a little worse for the wear on your entry.

On the other hand, if the market does bounce hard here (which is honestly more likely than the alternative) then you've locked in your profits and saved yourself some anxiety as well.
Hard to regret a $1200/14% trade, even if we do continue. Well done, sir. 
1k+ trade. Savor it. 
No one regrets taking profits. 
With trades like that i feel the bot should do the opposite of the comments on the BtmexRekt. 
Your trade should classify as "Master", above 20% something like "Genius", above 30% "Balls of steel" (although this one should be reserved by someone that has held underwater and came out on top)

!short BTCUSD 9300 3X 100%           

Keepining the above postition because this feels like its going further down but this could bounce. But things are different this time, im trusting my gut which says hold while the emotions say close.
When did they upgrade the server?
learning how to cope with losses is part of the game. No one will ever be consistently successful. If you're still up then you're winning- don't let it get to you
Wasn't bragging about it but I was down $2K on a very bad short (not BTC). You need to keep some good nerves sometime. I've chosen to not close this short but freeze it (on Finex, reducing the pos. to almost nothing) and added to it yesterday when things when south. Almost made everything back.

It's sometime really depressing, but removing feelings is what everyone say. And it's true. My first months of trading I've been liquidated twice. Was super tough, like I had dark thoughts to be honest. Since that I don't trade with what I can't afford to lose and I think those 2 liquidation triggered something in my brain somehow and honestly, it's annoying to have losses but I kind of don't care anymore and it's all better for my life. Just trying to focus and do the right trade that will reverse my losses into wins.

Of course I'm a bad trader, still learning a lot. But yeah, the hard part is how to manage losses and sometime accept them completely and move on or take a break from trading to clear up your mind.
Just quit. 

Seriously, if it's bad for you, don't do it. Just stick your coin in cold storage and HODL, or cash out. Then get a hobby you can enjoy.

edit: or maybe it's just a frustrating day. Every job is like that, man. Hang in there.  
im not even happy when i make a winning trade.. doesnt feel like real money to me

Like others have said, you win some, you lose some. As long as you keep a grip you'll be fine. Maybe take a break, maybe just re-evaluate your positions, that's up to you, but I don't think anyone will deny that it's a rough market, but the emotional rollercoaster is part of the game. 

I'm sure things will turn in a favorable way for you again soon enough ! :)
Here's my take:

You've probably got one more leg down before a moderate bounce, but perhaps 0 more legs down. 

Worst case scenario if you take profit now is I'm wrong and this keeps dropping for two or even three more legs down. 

In which case you short the bounce and reenter close to (or perhaps even higher) than your exit here.

This is a very good piece of information. On how to trade with less emotions.
Go back to sleep.
Why does he want to sell lower?
Any other potential scenarios you want to throw out there?  Then later you can come back and make the narrative fit.
Nearly every bounce starts out looking like a bear flag or a pennant before it breaks out to the upside:

https://imgur.com/a/XSI22Qc

When most people say "the market is due for a bounce," what they're really saying is, "RSI (or other technical indicators) are suggesting that sellers are running out of momentum. This should stop moving down and start moving up, at least for a little while."

There isn't no bounce its all noise.

> I think a bounce around 8.2k is more likely

Yes.
It's most probably a bear flag, but we're oversold on most timeframes, and there seems to be a lack of selling below 8550 for now... it could really be nudged either way.
Or a small [ascending triangle](https://imgur.com/a/jYEmjpi)


its a bear flag and it's on the bull to be buying on a bear flag, not the bears.  no volume here = bad.

volume on bear flag(past the pole) = accumulation = bear flag break down eventually,

no volume is just a typical continuation of downtrend, soon as enough time passes for oversold condition to leave, it usually dumps again.



still think this is distribution :P. technically we should have a low volume rally here soon, and then the next move will be "mark down"

we are following this perfectly now. volume profile even fits the sell-off now /u/midnightocean :D

Just did some quick research. The biggest daily price range on a negative day after the 11.7k rejection was 17%, and closed about -10.3%  (9.3k -> 8k) . We're currently at about 9-10% in the negative. so we might drop a bit more here, but odds are we bounce somehwere soon. 
Like last year right?
I think we'll see some more fireworks with 8.5 stop losses. I do agree that we'll probably try to break it, though I'm not sure about recovery and what the target of that would be. 
i bought that fake out but sold.. i give up on .. just going to wait for the crash and all in




When I looked 15 minutes ago, it seems like longs are closing but shorts are closing faster. Longs still significantly outweigh shorts. I think this may have been the bounce you were talking about. 

I was a bit timid in my entry, but I've now added on 3 straight bounces (9000, 8810, 8720) to be 100% 7x just over 9050, but that's June, not spot, and my original opening was 9200. It's hit or miss whether scaling into positions is a good idea, but your trades offer a pretty tangible counterpoint to it. If this premium flips to a discount, though, oooh boy. 
But what if instead of bouncing we just continue to dump man?
If you watch he calls pull back to 8200 - 8800 
Someone also posted a Ny Times article 2 days ago "is bitcoin back". Then I thought the same...
Lol, Fast Money is a joke:

1. They say Tom Lee's done an interesting "study", which amounts to nothing besides him plotting the dates for previous Consensus.

2. Guy says price is pulling back to 40 week moving average as he proceeds to draw a big fat line with his finger underneath the price.

3. "There's really a bull/bear scenario developing..."

4. They referred to it as Bitcoin instead of Bitcoin Legacy


Tell her I said hi.
If you thought those were big, you should take a look in her closet
The amount getting dumped is crazy.
Give yourself a mental slap every time you have an emotional reaction to price movements. 

I agree though, this market is insane and absolutely draining.


Likewise - holding 11.6% loss on my USDBTC position, and a 6.3% loss on my USDEUR position

Liquidation at $2700. I'm hoping I don't get liquidation-hunted at this point - but if I do - I'd be happy to declare Bitcoin dead for several years if it ever sees that price level.

Saving up some money now to dump in at $6k.
why'd it go up?
Upbit. It's actually good news, with a bad headline.
Honestly I feel like opening a long another 10% down is risky. The fact that there's no capitulation yet frightens me.
Squeeze out all the shorts, then squeeze out all the longs. Circle of life.


So exactly the same like Bitfinex FUD, WHO could have guessed this turn of events pushed by old media 
Based on this I'd guess you'd target lower 7ks?
how is consensus gonna factor in?  Put a point at around 50k on your chart and draw a line connecting the current price point to that point.  That's how it's gonna factor in.

We aren't actually oversold except on the 2h-4h. 15m-1H are all between 30-50, and 1D is also near the centerline. The case could be made that the market is just cooling off ahead of the next leg down. We've bled upward on low volume, and a break under 8550 would probably cascade. We just saw a run up to 8675 that stalled and then returned to 8600. To me this feels more like we're about to drop than about to pump. Neither would surprise me, though. 
I'm a little more liberal in thinking it'll go to a piss taking 9k max with a turn down in the direction of Goblin Town. Target 8k(ish), not below.

That being said, I get a bit funny about weekends. It might go on a run through Saturday.

Thinking this is a bear flag and its rolling over. Also thinking you have to be completely insane to long this. 32K longs vs 20k shorts ????? Anyone wanted to buy in and long already did. Get the fuck out is what I think
Should be a smart move based on RSI oversold territory.
You might set your bounce targets a little lower.  Concept is probably sound, but gotta remember that bears take the window, not the stairs.  Good luck!
I've got a line of resistance you can snort.

When their leverage runs out they'll get margin called and be forced to sell, thats when the panic sets in

 WTF high leverage?
4hr rsi is 23 which is oversold as fuck, but you can't really depend on it in a strong trend. IIRC we reached like 96 in december on the daily.

On the hourly, the RSI14 has been lower but just passed 30 from below, which is the [recommended](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/042114/overbought-or-oversold-use-relative-strength-index-find-out.asp) time to buy in an uptrend in order to avoid a false buy signal. Arguably this isn't an uptrend, but a small bounce, and I leave it up to the TA experts to correct / complete this picture, as I'm not too familiar with it either.
so all in?
The November 6 retrace kicked off a week\-long Bitcoin\-Bcash battle that was one of the most toxic events of the entire cryptospace that year.    I never want to see that again.

I abandoned 50% of mine at a meagre profit point again. It's looking heavy as hell. 

capitulation.

This is a long term game, if you have invested in good, valuable projects, then you will get your money back
In the midst of this slaughter REP so far has doubled within the last 30 minutes and its still going.
Very interesting. If we double bubble from here shit would get wild.
Be careful about timeframes. What you laid over 2017 bubble doesn't show the 1.5 years to hit bottom and 1.5 years to recover.

https://i.imgur.com/0empVZ5.jpg

Crypto time is faster than normal markets, so compare how ours looked to microsoft:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/JO5zgrvZ

If we invalidate the low we hit twice so far, our chart will mirror microsoft's, with a bigger dip that goes below 6k.

I noticed that the 2013 bubble ended and we hit its neckline twice to verify bottom. Where is the 2017 neckline? Will we double verify it too? Depending on how you view it, I think you could make a case for 3k or 6k. 

https://i.imgur.com/KAYWPqZ.jpg

I don't make any claims to predict the future, but its interesting to speculate.
That's a great find!
This is interesting to read from someone else. I was just reminiscing this morning about a trade I was deliberating a while back at $84 after selling some at $110. Did I wait for $80 or see if it dropped to $77? I finally said fuck it and re-bought at $85. This feels eerily similar.

What about this bear flag painting some speak about?

The daily RSI has quite some room but maybe you want to re-short from higher?
FINALLY - I'd all in but the cme is closed.  dammit.

Hi Chew, I just want to thank you again for sharing your trades and analysis. I'm following you with the remaining 25% of my stack to add to my under water long. When the path seems to pretty bleak it's good to have a bit of light to guide you. I think you are that light to a lot of us here. Sorry for being sentimental and thanks again.
Any guess what the bounce will reach? 8.7k maybe? 
I'm not surprised by the close, but a little by the long. Still, excellent trade. Well done as usual.
Pleasure doing business with you jrice. Good luck!
No... No joke. Upbit news is the surprise.

It was exhausting watching the bear flag being painted for so long... (in crypto time)
the selling pressure is through the roof now, I don't understand it at all. 
6 days from now ... sitting at 12k.

"How were we at 8k 6 days ago???"
Good for bitcoin....?
A whole week of blockchain events in new york kicks off today so hopefully there should be more than enough good news to counter the weekend low volume bears.
Feel like this is a sell the news event
These support areas are all too familiar right? We just went thru this 6-7 weeks ago.
Where is this descending wedge? I'm not seeing it. 
How do you have that wedge drawn?  Any way I have it drawn shows that we have to break out right *now*, which I don't really believe (but maybe I am dead inside), and there's not really any space remaining to iterate within the wedge anymore.   I think wedges/channels that are this steep are not usable for trading signals, though I'm not an expert.
It's the streaming services debacle being played out in the crypto space. 

Rather than try to figure out how they could leverage established streaming services like Netflix and Hulu, many major studios tried to create their own streaming services. With limited success.

We'll likely see a lot of companies, banks, and even governments try to create their own cryptocurrencies, rather than working with established coin offerings. I imagine there will be limited success here as well.
If they want to make some Erc20 or equivalent token to do stuff on their platform, then sure. If they want to attempt to compete with decentralized currencies meant to be global payment solutions, with their reputation good fucking luck.
Facebook ico to raise 1000 Billion ?
My cousin is on the team who is working on this as a side project at the moment.  The concept is truly in the idea phase but my cousin has managed to develop a dapp for messaging that runs on the ethereum network.  Their main goal/idea for running a blockchain is to provide transparency to both users and advertisers.  Enable both the user to see who has tapped into their information stream and then also allow for advertisers to search/target more effectively on the blockchain.  By having a visible connection of who is being influenced by advertisers, it will allow for the next unthought levels of targeted advertisements which advertisers will pay big $$$ for.  Hope that made sense, ask away I can ask my cousin more questions. 
I think Facebook is losing its relevance.  I have a hard time staying on it for more than 2 minutes these days.  Besides the whole privacy thing.  They could get myspaced by the next viral social media platform built on Ethereum perhaps - problem is FB has SO MUCH MONEY
what's that.... Facebook. 
Imagine making payments via Facebook, integrated seamlessly into the UI. It'd be a game changer for local services.

would you long here?
That's a pretty solid scalp and plan. We're skirting the bottom of the bear flag and approaching the downward resistance line, so you should get an indication of direction soon. 
And we who are in the 'loop' would really like to get out of this Groudhog Day of stepwise bear flags and drops.
The lack of a bounce is frightening. As always it'll likely happen at the least expected moment, but since we're still up from the bottom, I'm not even sure 8.2 will bring respite. 


NO.  FIVE dumps is the limit.  SIX is impossible!

I'm so confused by this price action. Is this free money on a plate if I hold my long just a little or has this market lost all sense (and i'm poorer).
I'd say this is actually a great place to open a position with a tight stop loss. If you pick right you have a lot to gain, if you don't you won't lose much.
I closed 75% of my short along the way (also from 9050ish).
I'm watching now to see if i close the rest and scalp a long or if i add again right below 8500
this is literally going straight down.  It's amazing.  And on no real news.  I've been trapped this entire time.  No bounces.



Compelling theory tbh. Even during the (end of) 2017 bull run the cross was a bad sign if I didn't misread my tiny chart.
You do know that the recent MACD evolves and what is a crossover now might not be a crossover later, right?

MACD shows drops perfectly in the far past because that is what it is supposed to do.

Drunk trading

The best game after Russian roulette (or third best after Drunk Russian roulette)
Nice play... despair in here is palpable... RSI guttered across the board.  I re-opened a long and sleeping on it.  Cheers
F yea, buddy.
drunk long with you.... lessgetit

daily candle looks like poo poo so I'll probably open a short on the bounce but long or flat is the only logical play here. 
You god damn fool!  Better be hitting the good shit.
:P

Mate not to be a dick but I think trading whilst drunk is possibly the worst thing you could ever do. I mean, I've done it before, and it lead to me typing in numbers pretty wildly incorrectly, if nothing else. 

Take a break mate. If you've had some bad luck the last few days (completely understandable) then take a break, come back when your mind is clearer.

Nice trade, with such leverage i don't blame you for locking in profits. I'm thinking on scaling out a bit here but might just close it all if we get above 8800.
Yeah probably a good call. I still remember how I did not close my +15% short around 6500 despite MANY offered possibilities to do so, and ended up losing most of the profit. 

Even tho I'm pretty sure this will drop more, I'm gonna try to do a layered limit buy around 8550-8670. Trying to follow my own rule that a successeful trade is closed by a limit order, not a stop order... 

edit: a layered limit buy around 8550-8670 to close my short and exit my position, is what I meant.. 
Horizontal support minor around 8200-8300 then 7800-7900.
Yeah that's about right. We're dropping pretty hard right now though so I'd just wait and see what happens at those levels.
does CNBC still move the market?

I was triggered by it.  Slept like shit.

Closed my earlier long for a loss, and re-entering from lower. It's now absurdly oversold on the 4h RSI (more so than during the 6k bottoms).

!long XBTUSD 8403 50X 50%
[/u/justanotherlogin](https://www.reddit.com/user/justanotherlogin) any idea why my position wasn't updated by the bot, based on the comments from here?

- I opened a long at 8590, which the bot registered ok
- I closed that long at 8480 - **not** registered
- I opened another long at 8403 - **not** registered
!long XBTUSD close 8595

Anywhere between 7.8 and 8.4 is a good area for at least a short term reversal
Yep, that's where they start for me, although I'm tempted to try to scalp a short term rally this weekend.
I have 7764 as my entry point.  May force it in earlier but even that has me worried about coming back in "too early" at the current moment. 
When will it reach goblin town?
> All RSI are also oversold

No. And previous dumps showed that the market doesn't care until the Daily hits oversold.
Since *february, I see the 50 day SMA offering resistance but not support.
Daily RSI still has room to go down..
Make a plan, stick to the plan. If your trade fails, look back at how / why you made that specific plan and what made it fail, then figure out how you can avoid making the same mistakes in future. 

A planned and executed trade that brings you a loss isn't necessarily a 'bad' trade, as long as you have a clear idea of what you were trying to do and why you had to close it at a loss. It's an extra datapoint for you to learn from and use as reference for future trading. 

Also, if you're having trouble with being emotional while trading, have a rule to never make two trades in a row. Win or lose, once you close a position, walk away. Give it an hour (or a day, or a week, really depends on market conditions and your personality and how difficult / stressful the trade was), then re-assess and start thinking about your next position. Don't fall into the 'I have to recover my losses' trap -- bouncing in and out of positions rarely leads to anything good; it *can* be a decent way to trade, but you've gotta be an experienced trader to navigate the line between searching for good entries and overtrading into stupid losses like that. 

Last but not least, remember that there's nothing wrong with not being in a position. You don't have to always be long or short, and you don't have to try and trade every move. You don't have to catch the perfect bottom or sell the perfect top to be profitable, either. Just try to make sure risk / reward is in your favor. 
> What do you do to try and eliminate emotion from your trading decisions?

Do it enough times. You’ll cycle thru every emotion known to mankind along with several that aren’t. By the time that’s finished you’ll be bankrupt. In which case, problem solved.  

If you aren’t, well then hell, welcome to the VIP room, I guess. 
You’ve been baptized by fire and reborn as a machine for whom the term emotion is no longer in your vocabulary and you share little in common with most people. You think of yourself as a “nice guy” but everyone who knows you thinks you’re an eccentric asshole. 

You eventually blow up. Emotion returns. Briefly. You double down and get better. By this time you’ve read everything known to man about trading and arcane equations from game theory begin to fill your field of view during your waking hours and often follow you into your dreams. You become successful, humbled. People no longer think you’re an asshole, but you still find normal people difficult to relate to.  

You eventually blow up again. And make it back. Less emotion each time. The losses smaller. The wins bigger.  

Now you realize that the game is not what you thought it was.  
There’s levels to this shit. You have an intense appreciation for the role of chance, the great philosophical mind fuck that makes the market by and large untamable. God’s Casino.  

Now that you recognize what you’re up against, you’re even more humbled, mostly inclined towards introspection, and don’t really care much for what’s going on around you, you’re too busy refining your edge. By this point you can quantify such things 8 ways to Sunday, but are still at the mercy of Chance. By this time you’re fine with this. None of it is bad or good. It just is.  

Realize that in some ways it’s a strange profession (almost as if you were to take gladiatorial combat and juxtapose it with math somehow), but in other ways it’s a profession like any other. So  patience with oneself should go without saying. You’re competing in a realm occupied by true apex predators who’ve been thru ups and downs that most could scarcely conceive. 

Eventually if enough time goes by, the question of emotion is no more applicable than that of a pilot speaking about the emotion of flying a plane. It just won’t compute. 

In which case, you’ll be pleased to learn that thanks to your obsessive nature and dogged determination over the years, you’ve now been granted admittance to a new, even more prestigious club: where there’s no real prize except that of lighting up a cigar and bearing silent witness to the “survivorship” (selection) bias that people were always talking about. 

Hold on, do I mean to suggest that success isn’t 100% due to one’s own hard work? 

Yes. Actually I am.  

Somewhere out there, in another part of the conceptual multiverse, there’s another version of you who did everything the same exact way, but due to market conditions beyond their control, failed. No matter the nature of the risk management being employed, there’s a black swan out there with your name on it, metaphorically speaking.  

It’s a chilling thought and will take some time to become at peace with. 

In the end that’s the duality to the market that I think is what’s most intriguing. The binary nature of chance itself: heads versus tails, up versus down, short and long, right & wrong, rich/poor, yin and yang.


Fascinating that in a deep mathematical sense, all of one’s efforts and time very much come down to a particular, singular filtration^1

That is to say, in the long run, from a payoff POV, the outcome will have no more grand meaning than if you were to never spend any time trading at all, but instead simply took out a dozen loans, got 10 credit cards, sold all of one’s possessions, house, car, 401K, liquidated all savings, and caught a bus to Vegas. 

Walked in the door of Caesars and bet it all on one turn of the wheel.

—wish you more than luck.

that way its out of your hands, if it gets triggered, it means its the right time to sell. That way you won't keep holding on hoping for a bounce
think about how much people's estimation of their own wealth has fluctuated in this space over the past year. There's been too much  daydreaming for emotions not to set in when you start to doubt "it will always go up forever"
What fud is just starting? This has 10 upvotes? That's the fud. 
agree - i think it's just the beginning.
Yeah smart.  I've been preparing for a drop for a few days and had small buys down to 7600.  Woke up and saw the first few had hit, boy was I angry.  Luckily they were small enough that I am not in danger unless there is a reversal today.  

Disagree with the "only a newb" part.  Whole thing is a mess in the aggregate over the past half year and any decision is hard especially if someone is in a bad place with their prior trades and $.  

Good luck out there. 
Asia, just ignore.
Bear market as per usual.
Zoom out. Look at weekly candles. The bull market prior to December did the exact same.
Not much. Baseless FUD but the shit refuses to bounce. 
Doesn't look like it. Sadly. There were a load of buys at 8800 buy the book is currently empty there.
The system overloading at key times is actually pretty beneficial for bitmex profits, that is the only reason they havn't fixed their servers imo - they are making more than enough cash to fix it if they want to.
Probably never.  Their system just can't handle the volume and they can't seem to expand the capacity.
That's some brave knife-catching.
Nice entry
You'll be fine longer term, but I think this is definitely visiting within a few percent of $7500
I just went long as well.  Just too much of a steep, fast drop and a reasonable bounce is in order at some point before long..maybe.  Or could be a relentless dump like the first one down to $6000.
*nervous chuckle*
Wow.

For a moment though I thought this was BTC and I got my hopes up about capitulation.
> *My* Lifes a fucking gift so live it and enjoy it.

FTFY.

Seriously though, you're right. Joy and misery are just part of the ebb and flow of life's ocean. Just make sure you wear water wings!

Ah, I remember my GCSE's.

Enjoy your summer lad, because I tell you now, you won't get many more long summers.

> just remember, THIS IS TEMPORARY.

You don't know that. Look at 2014 crash, looks almost identical. Took 2 years before that started to recover.
Well done on that last exam dude, great feeling eh!
What's your average entry? don't have to give specifics...could give a $1k range. 

And it's leveraged now right? As in you're not just flat, but 2-#x short?

anyway I have a feeling you don't want to give specifics. But thanks for your input here, always nice reading your comments and being a bear is a bit easier with you around :P

Why mention it now?
Nice trade. It appears the market is heading into a tailspin for a bit. I think all of our sideways movement over the past month has helped keep us afloat above $9k. It will be interesting to see where the bottom is. BTC (and ETH for that matter) both appear to be in freefall for the moment. I expect a quick bounce then moving below $8,500. 
*slow clap*
One man's loss is another man's profit. Glad you are feeling good after this long.:) fuck harvey!
[deleted]
Congrats on the close. Can you please share what kind of lessons you 
 have learned while managing this position over time?
Not sure why you added on ~8. Or was it when we were on the way to 6k?
Well played sir!
Willing to share what sort of leverage that was at?  

I can't imagine being down 40% with that kind of range and being able to sleep if it was above 5x.
Congrats and thanks for keeping us up to date!
Bitcoin is trivially dead long term, has a chance at another bubble cycle in a few years, will have to run through this bear market cycle for another few years currently.

Yet, it is well within chart history and overall behavior for a bounce to even 12k on this round 2 trap. Did you feel 12 was impossible or were/are you planning to hold through 12-13 until the bear proceeds?
So I'm going to just assume that $100 bounce was you taking profits.
People like you make this sub worth reading.

edit: and downvoted for a sincere comment.
Seriously, a diversity of clear-eyed, articulated views is valuable.

Or they want to make you think it is the bottom. Why not put a hidden buywall to accumulate?

Edit: And they are gone. What a surprise.
99% of news is insignificant compared to the existing market forces in such an emotional market, barring black swan events. 
Mtgox moved 8000 coins to dump?
The bears time the sells to coincide with the FUD.  Did you notice that when the news came out an hour ago that the [Upbit thing was a misunderstanding](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8iq207/korea_upbit_the_irregularity_being_investigated/) is when they pulled out all the stops and sold very hard again?  There's no rational reason the price would dip then.
As usual it is an over reaction to a non event.
In my opinion we are "overbought" since April the 13th if you know what i mean. I still think this bull run was/is a fakeout /P&D driven by 1 super smart move (the huge short squeeze) and subsequent FOMO fueled by smart market buys aimed to sustain growth. The whole move lead to a nice cash out at the first occasion. I would have expected a stronger bounce here at 8.7 but, so far, it did not happen and buying pressure is, well, inexistent (since 9900)?
Curious why you keep trading against the trend. 
if you're trying to scalp a long then you might as well keep trying. This thing has to bounce at some point, assets don't stay oversold nearly as long as they stay overbought. market is still bullish so there will be at least a 3-4% bounce here at some point, you just have to wonder when it's gonna happen
Combined with a market that had a nice run-up, along with some shorts noticing it.  Agreed.
Might be, wow the have so much ammo
and how many more coins does the trustee have? over 100,000 or something crazy like that?

Edit: trustee still has 137891 BTC 

If 72 million USD worth of BTC can cause a market to dump 60 billion in value in 1 day something is not right with said market...
This sell pressure really has me considering adding to my short - RSI says hell no but I think some indicators are about to get thrown off the top floor of a building. Prior to this whole sell off I was thinking that I would short if 8.2 broke - but now it looks like it could even break today, at which point I would have to expect a bounce there rather than a continued sell off - it would just be too much to handle for 24 hrs.
RSI's got hard support at 0
all in RSI if it gets under 5 stops at -1
A small backlog of transactions formed in the last few hours too.  Coinbase complaints about transaction times went up too.  Probably a result of / part of this selling pressure too.

Not as bad as it once was - I remember once or twice before (because I was trying to beat the rush too) watching the price visibly move every time a block was found.  Hopefully won't reach that level of fear again though.
Idk how obvious it is to some people but managing your emotions is a massive one that people don't do. People have trouble managing their emotions in every day life...when money is on the line they're even worse
Zoom out and look at the weekly trend. I used to get too hung up on trading the short term timeframes, and panic if the market moved $50 against me. Looking at the weekly gives a perspective of the bigger picture.

>Anyone take a particular non-obvious step to manage risk?

I often sell covered calls to reduce risk. Not sure what other steps you're thinking of? 
A retest of the downtrend line would not-not be bullish, which is now in the low 7Ks. It would have to be a strong bounce though. Otherwise we'll just as well break under it again or follow the top of it down, not unlike 2014.
What are the regulars repeating: There are no *lines*, merely areas or *fuzzy* lines.

I think the big horizontal support lies between 8.6-8.8k given the bounces over the last month.
$8.5k is the last big wall on bfx. Once those bids are filled we will see a bounce to around $8.8-8.9k.

The trend will likely be decided by where the market goes after that
yeah, if 8.7k does not hold, goblin town, here we come
50ma around 8.4k on the way down to 8k horizontal support. Not sure why people moved from the 8.8k just yesterday to 8.7k today.
Support somewhere between 5 and 7. I flipped short when we broke 9.
A few of my buy orders were hit today. Do I count as a dip buyer if I bought using limit orders I placed a week ago? In any case, I'm hoping that we test $8000, and that it holds. I'm looking to recharge a longterm long I have. Best of luck trading. 
I’ve made a double of my DCA buys, if it counts.
Zoom out a bit and there's this one as well:

https://imgur.com/a/rD1a17W

There's nothing compelling with more than 2 points of contact for now, unfortunately, as this movement is still young. 

The lines that are descending most rapidly aren't likely to be long for this world, but the one I posted above has some promise for a few days or weeks in its lifecycle.
Short from $9,095ish. Stop loss at breakeven. 
I'm short from just over 9K. stops at break even. 
I’m out of position right now, but have opened and closed several shorts since 9.6k.

I will go short again if we drop below 8.5 with conviction, or long above 8.9 with conviction.

My perception is that we’re in the midst of another dead cat bounce right now, but am long term bullish.

Only 30% of my stack left.

Rest out of position. 
short from 9088.

If there's evidence of a bounce around 8000, I'll close there. Otherwise, who knows?
I am short 12% of my trading stack BTCUSD and sold some alts for cash. But I am too heavy BTC so happy to be rid.

I think this is bot-driven / technical (daily EMA cross / 200D SMA) selling. I don't know how long it will last. The secular trend is up. Short term down.
I lost a little over 13000 BTC since 2011 doing really stupid things
a short from $8.9 is at risk of only being stopped out at breakeven...you don't have to worry about being underwater. at least for a while

1. there are no shorts to squeeze
2. futures are STILL at a premium despite the fact that they were at a discount here last time we were here
3. and sentiment is actually still "devastated bullish" instead of "hesitantly bearish", which means lots of underwater longs that people will close on the way up (30k+)
RSI is sub 30 on many time frames. I would close my short at 8400, but who knows.

Best is to close short and set stops to reshort at 8200 imo
Polo
That is the only thing what really concerns me in my underwater long. All timeframe RSIs scream for at least a smallbounce...but jesus...this is depressing :(
There is more than one way to spin it, I think. Either these longs are held by complete newbies who just didn't know any better and didn't have stops in place, or they're actually super comfy with non-existent liquidation levels, or even straight up just < 1x positions to bait out sellers. Not nearly as clear of a sign as overloaded short side, as shorts are inherently more risky / have potentially more to lose. 

Another thing that *could* be more concerning than these margin positions (and lead to much further dumping) is the fact that alts are actually holding up pretty well through this drop. A lot of coins that lost 5% or even less on the ratio -- with a Bitcoin drop as drastic as this one has been, that's very uncanny. Further pressure down *could* eventually see massive capitulations and a sharp 'panic' spike down as alts are trying to cash out into fiat. Ethereum was barely above $500 last time BTC was in this price range, EOS was under $10 (and it still has over 10million longs hanging too, lol), BCH was well under a thousand. 

edit: Come to think of it, this is very similar to the doubletop under $12k. A run up from a big dump where alts gain more than BTC, then in the trough alts didn't lose all that much on ratio while BTC was dumping. Alts just didn't recover as much towards the second peak, and then everything dumped hard forever. Let's see what happens next. 
I personally believe it was a "correction". i mean, 1D RSI just touched overbought. In corrections during  a bull market 1D RSI hits oversold and then bounces
Duh. People who stated this were never seen as they were downvoted to oblivion. And now the price to pay is now. C'est la vie :)
A longer consolidation phase would be healthy.
We'll know better after the weekend, as weekend price dynamics amplify smaller trends
What is all this about a bear market? One down week punctuated by two bad days is not a bear market. 
what exchange fud?

That peak before the left shoulder doesn't invalidate it? If not, in this is targeting almost a 1000$ drop no?
Going completely from memory here, I can't view charts at the moment, but I recall 8,650 acting as support/resistance fairly often. 

It also might just be the bottom of the bear flag while RSI cools off etc.
Resistance from March turned support late in April.
Copy and paste from coin desk.  The cryptocurrency looks set to test the gradually ascending (mildly bullish) 200-candle MA located just above the $8,628 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement, seen in the daily chart). However, the moving average support may hold ground for a few hours as the relative strength index (RSI) shows oversold conditions
thx dawg 
Still short :)
> So I didn't want to admit it at first, but it looks like the CME futures market is driving this movement

- CME US$10.7 billion (Since inception) 

- CBOE US$6.5 billion (Since inception) 

- BitMEX US$2.3 billion (Last 24 hours)

https://twitter.com/BitMEXResearch/status/994424448349495296

volume is still negligible
huh? his analysis is that since CME was closed during the last $8500 that that's our target? lol

I would really not listen to that guy, btw. One of the morons of the space, although he seems nice enough.
Yes... sure... and Young guy knows / knew about Upbit
It sounds like he's getting whatever the fuck he's talking about (tbh it sounds like total shit) with PnF charts. Lmao. Someone please tell me I'm wrong
Pretty interesting the 25% increase in volume at CME over the past two months. 
what about that 1k+ move when it shot from 6800 to 8k a few weeks ago?  if the CME futures are driving the market then does that mean every bull move has to be retraced?  
I don't get this theory, and why wasn't the gap filled in late April ? Did parabolic trav predicted it or just came with this theory today.
pretty sure we’ll drop quite a bit

Comments like this indicate you are not a rational person. Bitcoin cash is just an experiment to scale bitcoin on chain like Satoshi designed. 

It’s an experiment to continue the project without influence from an outside corporation that has investors who want to get returns on their money. 

I see nothing wrong with that. Cancer isn’t even remotely an accurate description. The new additions, the changes, the conflict of interest, is all coming from the core side.
 Who down votes someone for trying to learn? Pathetic.
http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:relative_strength_index_rsi

then search in that page for oversold
'oversold' and 'overbought' are indicators used in technical analysis.

https://crypto.chartguys.com/indicators
It refers to selling being very strong and the RSI indicator shows that condition as being under 30. The general range of the RSI is 30 to 70. Seventy being overbought. The oversold condition means you can expect the price to go up sometime soon. I'm sure someone else can explain this better.
RIP Long

7:49 UTC May 11th - 8:28 UTC May 11th

Depending on how things look, I might even top up this long at around 8.7k.

Bitcoin was also up about 60% from the previous ATH at that time. 

It was also up about 200% from the lowest price of the year up until that point. 
I saw that chart going around Twitter. Didn't look like it was correlated with surges per se.

Also, what is likely to come out of Consensus this year? What type of news would give Bitcoin Legacy thrusting power? 

Imo, Bitcoin Legacy needs LN to be built out a bit more before its ready for a significant boost in confidence that will lead to new ATHs. Things are looking good right now (for Bitcoin Legacy) but we really need watchtowers, AMP and software that isn't in beta. I predict that by end of year we'll have some significant milestones and news regarding LN and that'll be a catalyst ties into upcoming hype over the 2020 halvening.

As in...up? Off a bear flag? Why?
another rising wedge/bear flag..  this is when the dumps occur.
lets hope for some support this time.

Breakdown you mean?

Edit to comment on your edit: I'd say it looks more like a bear flag than an ascending triangle, but we could very well break up. either way, as we're approaching the resistance line, a move will become more likely and imminent. 
At least there is another of those 2000 coins wall
Doing the same. Nearing the “this is getting ridiculous” point of oversold/overbought market conditions.
I also bought the dip. We perfectly hit the bottom of the bear flag we've made at 9.4k from our descent from 10k. Bit risky maybe, but I'm expecting a bounce here. 

Edit: https://www.tradingview.com/x/TQd4u1E3/

Using coinbase because my finex chart is a disaster atm. 
Doing the same, more targeting 8k-8.3k though; will make me more comfortable with a SL below 7.8. If it doesn't ever get down there and bounces significantly here I'd be somewhat surprised but I'm very willing to buy back above 8.6; still decent profit crypto wise.
I also expect a bounce, maybe at around $8200.
Damn it Tommie! 
Yes this could be a sweet entry for a long...too early to call, but time will tell..
Wasn't his latest trade a long though?
Anyone here talking about a larger drop or seriously talking about a short was downvotes into oblivion the past week. Also called stupid. Common trend here. Folks just want to go up up up and draw lines to get there. 
[deleted]
That tool was me, and we moved up ~$700 before this drop. 
I still think it's a coin flip short term. 
Or sell and buy in at a probably lower price. Whatever, you know.
We aren't getting Gox'd, some wallets moved.  People are Gox-ing themselves or allowing the planted fear of it to work.

"I plan to consult with the court and determine further sale of BTC and BCC," -Gox Trustee, March 2018

He doesn't meet with the court again until September.
I don't believe in Satan or anything like that, but I will say that Bitcoin sort of forces them to play fair.  The blockchain is a level playing field.  They can't do the funny stuff they do in other markets because there's a perfect record of everything.

Also, they're not all on the same side.  Some of the big boys are not fighting the future and are accumulating.
It is incredibly steep. I'd say avoid any rash decisions if / when we get near it just in case we do dump back down, but I wouldn't expect such a sharp downtrend to hold for long, especially given the amount of crypto-positive news recently. 
Two points of contact and unsustainable, but it's "valid" just in that it hasn't been broken. Another dump off the line would be pretty crazy, and definitely lend it credibility. I have the line drawn as well, but I'm not putting much stock in it until we have more data around it.  

It intersects the log line on 5/14 down at $7300. That would be pretty significantly bad. 
Yeah I'd say it's valid, though it probably won't be sustained the more we go down into resistance. If you're scalping, that's a good place to take profits to be safe.
Sunday is the start of Consensus. It's the x-factor on this IMO. If we get rekt heading into the biggest annual crypto conference....lol ouch. 
automod caught your comment somehow, I've manually approved it
Lol I really want this to happen now 
GDAX just wicked into $8,386
The support i'm seeing is more in the 8250-8300 range

Edit: I can't tell the difference between an 8 and a 9
upbit apparently has been listing new coins and 'selling' these new coins themselves while pretending to be users of Upbit but they're not ACTUALLY holding any of these new coins that they're 'selling' to the REAL customers of Upbit. This is what I read from the korean forums.
Edit: and so, their withdrawals are disables currently because they don't actually hold coins that customers can withdraw
maybe this, maybe gox trustee, who knows. but it's surely fascinating how market turned on a dime while everyone was bullish. just shows how little 99% of people know. 
Why don't you at least paraphrase this.  No one here can read korean.
One of the things that might get them in trouble is when they add new coins.  You think BitcoinCash with Coinbase was bad.  It happens with every new coin added.  Sometimes the coins reach 10X their initial price within the first day and then crash down.  There was one coin that reached almost 20X.  Definite insider trading.
Nobody can read this
they will be screaming sub $3,000 soon and that bitcoin has no redeeming value what so fkn ever. lol
I really don't want to come across as dismissive, and the problems you encountered early on in the environment are real and something that should be dealt with. 

That being said, I do think the discussion of semantics on bitcoin is beyond the scope of the subreddit. I'm not saying you shouldn't be vocal about it, however I do think in this instance it might be better to message one of the mods ( /u/jarederaj , /u/joyrider5 , /u/jenninsea are all quite active) to inform them of your issue with certain individuals' behaviour. In that way we can keep this thread free from the drama that is seen in the other threads. (aside from the occasional jest of poetry, lyrical improvisations of strife, and occasional memes)


Who?
who is her?
Yeah ban speech you don’t like because people shouldn’t be expected to actually understand what they are buying. /s


I agree with you and dont know why you are getting downvoted.

However, words do not have intrinsic meaning. Words have usages and language requires people to have the same definition of a word in order to communicate efficiently. Calling Bitcoin Cash "Bitcoin" is really a pathetic attempt by people to claim a name. If Bitcoin Cash was superior it would be able to stand on its own without resorting to childish and dishonest practices.


Asia loves BCH. When they see the big picture and stop gambling, it's done, IMO.

Do you think we have bounced enough from 8.7k to confirm a reversal? From what I am reading, there may be further decline to 8.4-8.6 range... but well maybe!
ballsy , good luck!
Good entry, is this long term or scalp? I'm seeing a minor bullish div on the hourly, but it's a very aggresive trade. 
Trav is that you?
Again in the most excellent way possible, this is a busted theory that will lose you more money in the long run fo sho, possibly in the short run too. That nigga is straight retarded.
just buy after every dump and sell before the next.. this is gonna climb up again for the next dump in 5-8 hours

Or profit takers.  Or folks cutting a bit of a loss to buy back later.  Which of the 3 do you think is the biggest or "most right."  Im guessing your expecting a bounce to the moon? 
The market sentiment is very bearish...contrarian investing has proven very profitable for me in the past.  I am buying more with every drop. 
I can't explain why you were downvoted on the post in question, but I can explain why you're going to get downvoted this time if you'd like.

Hint: You're an asshole.
sometimes it's not what you say, it's how you say it
It was only 8200. The majority of it was the Koreans dumping like mad from the upbit news.
That was only 8500 coins. This dump was a lot bigger than that, but you're right about the downvotes.  Sometimes the best analysis gets downvoted to oblivion in this sub for some reason.
don't like the gloat but still upvoted, info is info, keep up the good work
7800 should be more significant than 7600, acted as strong support multiple times after our BGD from sub $7k
[deleted]
Good move 
probably because we were in a crazy two years run and never consolidated long enough?
bear market may not the over yet
42.10 is the lowest.
Maybe the weekly RSI is too slow to be useful in the new crypto.
> Just entered a long

Good luck.
It is a matter of hours, perhaps minutes from my experience.
When you feel the most urge to sell, buy. And opposite. 

Easy to say hard to do :) 
How about we let this play out before counting your chickens.  You never know the bottom until you have recovered.
Problem is that you said the same about $9100 earlier.  (or if you didn't, certainly someone else did).
Let 'em Burn
Emotion never learns.
I think it might be.
Well, almost. Could spike down to $7k with a wick. So long as it bounces up over $7400 ish (or doesn’t fall through it to begin with) I’m not considering it bearish.
I posted this yesterday after the first drop, but it appears to be playing out. 

>From a macro perspective, we still have all they way to 8831 to set a new higher low on the Daily time frame and maintain healthy consolidation. The last 5 days have been part of the same bear move. Breaking that level (8831) would likely lead to a retest of 8600 and if that fails, the next support is all the way down to 7800. This would benefit a break out on the Weekly time frame as well as it would provide continuation for equilibrium on that time frame.

I'm currently targeting a limit buy at 7950 as I think we'll bounce in the 7600-7800 range.
About to go sub $8650. Hasn't look this bad for bulls in quite some time. Looks like the conference will have no positive impact on the price. In fact, one might wonder; maybe this year will be different and actual bad news will be announced for a change (and some insiders are already acting on it). 

Sub $6k coming? 
a big dump here would cut the jugular... 30k underwater longs would panic close and shorts who are now rich with fiat and on the sidelines would eagerly jump in.  Even the large buyers at 6600 would be tempted to dump and take their profits.

just need a catalyst. 

[deleted]
Well FUD or not, it obviously scared the shit out of (potential) buyers.
The UpBit news being the FUD?
Yeah, it is. And we're going to test 10K again next week with the conference, this latest dumper having to cover, and so on.
That's approx a 35% drop. Would leave us around 6.5k you really think we'll see the 5's?
>I think bear market is far from over.
>
>Long in case I’m wrong, 

This is funny, I do the same thing.... opening longs to hedge against not being able to buy more BTC at a lower price later.
Wasn't bullshit when they pumped 25\+&#37; in a day?
Why is it bullshit?
Decred is still up
I remember when BTC was below 1000 dollars and the price was stable for a long time, probably because there was less manipulation. Those were good times.. cryptocurrency markets have become insane and toxic in my opinion.
Expecting some big quotations and appearances in NY next week at the week long conference. Could see some big players make statements on the space. I'd expect next week to be bullish on the market-sentiment side from the US
Is that on bitfinex?

Were not going lower than 8500 you should exit that position now.
I've changed my chart from a rising wedge to as ascending triangle, so you may be right
It’s likely we go up from here a bit to test the 1200 EMA as resistance. If we get rejected there, it will be particularly bearish and an excellent opportunity to short.

Edit: target of just under $8800.
http://news.cryptoofkorea.com/2018/05/11/upbit-suspected-of-fraud/

Ok at least this dump makes more sense if bad news is behind it.
A double top from ~$9900 with the valley around ~$8800 would have ~$7800 as the target; anything between ~$7500 and ~$8200 would paint a perfect higher low on a very steady, measured long-term uptrend from the February dump. 

Given the amount of positive news, the fact that the latest Korea FUD seems to be a nothingburger, and Consensus coming up, I could see us reverse a little higher than this supposed double top should take us (the bottom might already be in, or maybe we go a little further to like $8200-$8400 levels), but either way I think this is a place to start considering buys rather than adding to shorts, double top or not. People talking about this being 'the beginning of a dump to $5k' are insane, IMO. 

edit: The only thing that gives me serious pause are the stupidass 30k open BTC longs. Whether they're a sign of market resilience or a time bomb waiting to blow a hole under our feet, who knows.

We will bounce from $8.5k back to $8.7-8.9k and then continue down if we follow this
Well GOX coins clearly moved yesterday. I dont know why this info gets downvoted tho. 
Someone is clearly dumping and wants the price to be lower.  It is probably the Mt Gox trustee, but could be other parties.
wait til wall st wakes up 
What? Alts fleeing to BTC would more cause a drop in this case, not a bounce, as that btc would then likely be immediately sold for fiat, increasing supply.
This is why I think that the position bot is a neat thing but easily exploited. You can open and close positions that have nothing to do with actual market price.
That way everyone is a pro trader...
Maybe, but also lack of follow through of buyers above 9.3k, big move was bound to happen, and since resistance was too great to move up, down is the path of least resistance.
ask yourself, who is buying bitcoin? It sure as heck isn't average Joe......and that's the problem

I am ashamed, embarrassed and angry at myself for being naive enough to think "but this time it's REALLY different, as BTC was kinda obscure in 2014, and you can't draw parallels".

Get outta here with your sense and reason!
Funny how these comments start flooding the board after we dump. Weren’t too many around when we were pushing on 10k.

Post hoc bs.
If you look at the longer timeframes (weekly), it seemed like a DCB to me. It was clearer after the top blew off 9.8 and the second rejection at 9.9.

My feeling now, and it’s only a feeling, is that the BGD at 6.7 was merely an attempt to kickstart the market and avoid a prolonged bear market. Several BGDs pushed the price upwards with a little volume from others. However, this started to run out of steam around 9.5k, and big accumulators from 6.5 and under realised this. So now, they’re taking profits. If the price ends up below 8.4/8.5, I suspect we could be heading for that prolonged bear. That’s ok though, as it would provide a longer accumulation period for the next run up. Perhaps the halvening coupled with an expansion of LN and Rootstock would trigger that.
Check Upbit news. You statement is useless.

Its what i tell my friends. Sideways action between 8 & 10k for probably most of summer. 

September will be verry important aswell.

My long term vision didn't change either.  current price is still a verry verry good entry.  Long term traders are getting another chance at decent discount.

Also, don't even think about a sub 6k bottom. it's. not. going. to. happen.
Not a bad plan ... we may range in this [pennant throughout the summer](https://www.tradingview.com/x/7s9431U7/)... center point of the pennant is $8k
real adoption is going to be needed to sustain real price increase not just fluffy goody good news from the sector

look at Google trends..... no one is interested in Bitcoin
We found a bottom?

Did upbit got hacked? What happened? Just woke up
ETH/BTC ratio plummeted nearly 3% in 3 hours
Link to Upbit?
We'll see if true or not. 

In the mean time:

Kindly keep selling.
And even if they are later charged and convicted of that, it doesn't mean that they did it.  Gov'ts are playing all kinds of games in the War on Crypto.  Simple bans like in India and China are one way...Pressuring exchanges not to offer certain coins (like in Japan) is another...plus their 55% crypto tax.  The USA has all kinds of tricks and draconian regulations as well.  This could just be another tactic they are using.
I'm not even going to try to draw a support line here, because there's not much that I can draw to support a wedge or a channel. 

But regardless, the market is a bit away from breaking through resistance formed during this dump:

https://imgur.com/a/y1d0Khc

Resistance is at around $8,760 at the moment.
~~How'd you draw the wedge? On mine we're not even close yet, haha.~~

Your wedge starts at 9k doesn't it? I took mine from 9.4k
300 btc bough so far, only 30000 more to go to show that dump who's boss ;)
use a vpn.
Maybe because the market isn't driven by one guy wanting to unload every 6 hours?
Play around on bitmex testnet  to get a feel.
When you short you are essentially borrowing and selling at the current price. If it drops you buy back the shares you borrowed for a lower price than what you sold them for so you pocket the difference. The amount realized is the same if you had longed and it went up. Hope this helps. 
when do you project bitcoin hits 0?  or are you going to long after it hits fair value around 3k (actually wait for the oversold bounce around 2k)


The only thing I see bitcoin taking from alts right now is dispair.
How exactly is a continued downward trend from January and a \>7&#37; drop in less than 24 hours possibly "good for bulls"...remarkable
yeah, you never short something like this. You either shorted yesterday or wait for your long entry
I want to believe^TM
He is using it as a Hedge for his cold storage. Take that into consideration if you are trying to swing trade and following his positions on his shorts. 

Since he said he had no targets when entering should indicate he is still trying to figure out where this thing is going, and when he does he usually posts it here.
He added at 9040, his average is higher, and looking what's happening I don't think he's gonna close it soon...

I’d say something like [this](https://twitter.com/peterlbrandt/status/993461137847959552?s=21) isn’t far from what we can expect if there’s more downturn. 
How long till we get to 3k though? Would it be something that happens over a few days, weeks, months?

At a price of even $5k, investment in Bitcoin will be at disgracefully low levels. It would only cost $9m per day to organically buy ALL coins mined that day...
3k would be really low. If we get there then 7k should give some action, especially lower 7k. below that then higher 6k as a horizontal support, below that we're in goblin town, but it'll be really interesting for big money to make a play, so I don't think we'll spend a lot of time there. 
Somewhere between 2.7k and 4.8k. I've have staggered buys between yhose level. Under 2k isn't out of the question though. 
It didn't last time.
it's more of a very tight pennant. This could just bleed indefinitely, really. I mean the main reason anyone is buying here is for technicals. If it  doesn't bounce I can see people just continuing to sell 
No you arent. You are the biggest troll and choose to use your time in the most pathetic way imaginable. 
If people actually want to sell rather than just suppressing the price, wouldn't they post hidden walls? Or ladder their sells.
Heres how i see this playing out :

We bounce to 8800 at most, continue downwards. toy with 8200 for a while then capitulate down to 7300.
Why are there so many glory hunters on this sub? When they make a prediction and it goes right they immediately want praise for making the call. When it goes wrong it's total silence.
bla bla 

If you really think this market is driven by the average joe googling 'how to buy bitcoin', spending 500 bucks and having his news from cnbc while following all the twitter self proclaimed crypto gurus you really are financially illiterate. The massive blow off top run that lasted two weeks was indeed largely fueled by retail buyers market buying. The steady YOY increase in price and trading volumes are all capital management firms/hedge funds and crypto maximalists that will trade BTC hype or not. There's plenty of money waiting to enter (mine is) and everyone that's serious about his risk management should have plenty of cash waiting for a clear break the coming weeks/months. 

The longer term charts are showing decreasing volume, decreasing volatility. That's exactly what you want to see when a market is taking a breather and yes it is just a breather because 6k was the price in november lol. If we were to drop to 6k from here on volumes that rival those in february or december that would be extremely bearish. But it won't, we will likely 'slowly' bleed the coming two weeks to 7xxx. The weekly range will continue to tighten and it will break eventually. If it's down, it's going to be on very high bear volume, if it's up, it's likely ATH's this year. 

Learning to read charts and TA and general knowledge about how markets go up and down longer term would spare us all of these comments that don't mean anything.

Yeah praying that BitMEX buttons work.
Put your money where your mouth is.

Risk reward is not there to short near the bottom right now. We could bounce up easily anytime.
Yeah, but over the last several weeks Fridays have ended relatively stable.  It may not dump this time, and if we haven't dumped by 5pm EST, it's probably done for the day.

Further, I've noticed over the last several weeks that Friday nights (EST) and Saturdays tend to see a small rise in price, followed by a decrease on Sundays.  Doesn't always hold, of course, just a trend I've noticed for the last ~1.5 months.
only asians panic dump americans dont care if bithumb was hacked

And that is why I do not short.

As frustrating as the opposite, buying millions to drive the price up just to hit 10K and all comes tumbling down.

Most likely we are talking about the same people just playing all of us.
It’s likely the same people driving you to FOMO buy into their pumps are now the same who are taking profit at your expense....if these dumps are indeed manufactured, it’s only because they are taking profit. Nobody dumps at a loss ...it’s likely they are selling at FOMO buyers expense AND also profiting from buying back coins when they are significantly cheaper than they are today. 
1h rsi is at 27...it's gotten to 15 before. I mean it could definitely bounce but I really think all those bids will be filled on finex before we have a meaningful bounce. those things r just yearning for someone to sell into

This exactly. I don't know how to explain it logically, but not enough time has elapsed since so many people became insanely rich off of 5000%+ gains. People that got in once the rocket already left (any time in 2017) don't realize how much others have already made and still hold.

It's different for different miners. For some it's 9k, for some it's under 6k. 

If some miners leave that will make it more profitable for those that stay.

Large miners can definitely afford to work at a loss for a while.

Miners can hedge with shorts.
It just means less efficient miners will stop mining. Miners will never stop, it's always finding equilibrium. If was profitable enough at $100 it can be profitable now. 
By looking at the charts in a year or two.
Seems to me like we're making a descending triangle at the end of this dump. I'm genuinely curious to see how it plays out and if we can break up instead of just meandering sideways in a falling wedge. 
When moon and when lambos?
Weirdly the same pre-Consensus drop happened last year.
Or...people just want to sell...
Why would a yearly summit have a dramatic effect on price? Also, Vitalik and Charles H are both boycotting Consensus so I don't think it gives much reason for bullishness anyway
Maybe bullish crypo scenario means raise BTC for your ICO. Then what comes next is selling to get Fiat. Because Fiat is useful. Cannot pay for a business with BTC.

Not a bad thing if it holds.

Moved stop to 8380 just in case it doesnt hold
Tom Lee might be right. Looks like somebody is starting to cover, less than 24 hours after they began their dump. These big bears are getting weak. They need to find some garbage cans to tip over soon or they'll surely starve.

I am with you on this one although its confusing to her about bitcoin and bitcoin legacy but its kind of intuitive and not like the imposter bitcoin c(r)ash.
I guess this drop finally got to some people.
Are you asking if some of us are degenerate gamblers who ignorantly overlook counterparty risk?

Yes.
90% of my BTC is on MEX. 10% is in a bot.

I had to liquidate my cold storage in March (fortunately executed at 11.3K), but my sole purpose of trading is to rebuild it.

lol @ calling it legacy.

edit to add: I'm almost to the point I will pull some into cold storage and keep trading with a the stack. If we'd popped over 10200, I would have, but I took some hits to my goals on the failure to break it. If we keep dropping, there's not much point moving this to cold storage if I can be short instead.
What's Bitcoin Legacy?
i keep more, simply because i made all of my stack on bitmex
Depends on how long you are.  I'm still far above water, even just accounting for buys this year, though I'm down for the moment on the most recent one at 9150.
It hadnt held 3 times before, but we never got below 8700. The “line” is more of a range imo 8700-8800

Here here.
I meant that the dump started before.  We can't blame that news for starting it.  

It probably fed it though.
No, not really. The mentality is what made Warren Buffett a billionaire.

Whether it's the stock market, crypto, real estate...whatever. Pick something you think has value, invest, and bide your time while it appreciates over the course of decades.

Prove me wrong.
Well base on historical performance a holder always come out positive in the end, although that could mean years depending on when they bought in.  Now the question is, does being a long term holder make you a bull in the current market? Not necessarily so
all in long then?  I think this is the fibo retrace of the 6.5k-10k move
stop at 8500.
ah fuckit if this is an overvalued ponzi coin ill just cover on the boucne and look to short like all the other smart people on here.


You are right of course. Taking profits is, somewhat surprisingly, one of the hardest lessons so far.


on the other hand, no one got rich taking early profits ;D
Cool idea! And over 40% should be called "SloppyStyle", since only u/SloppySynapses seems to be holding positions that long :D
A few days ago https://blog.bitmex.com/bitmex-technology-scaling-part-1/
This exactly.

And if you're not winning then go rest, get a grip and come back.

I'm on a losing streak 50% of the time but still manage to get good profit.
How do I cope with loosing a lot of money(for me)? All those could've would've should've really get me ;(
I only swing trade. That has been the most profitable for me with the least amount of head pains. Though yeah, like yourself, I get hella aggravated when there's a dump outta nowhere. 
I am numb to all but the largest losses now.  It has made me a better trader, with very little emotion involved.
I have no plans of selling what I have in cold storage, so no I wouldn’t be all that pissed 
Appreciate it, thanks chewy. I've moved stops on my short down a bit closer but still over resistance. If they trigger, I'll lower leverage on my 50% long and set 1% stops. I'm not particularly confident in much of a long scalp opportunity off this price point given the length of time we've consolidated/cooled off here. I wouldn't want to be holding this long much underwater. If we do leg down here, I'll be taking profit on my short at 82xx, as we should bounce before 8K. 
I'm thinking the same, I have a support line drawn from 6480 which was also the launching point for the first BGD. Currently it sits at 8300. I think we either go up here, or a quick leg down just like the first BGD followed by a significant bounce.
Historically, I err on the side of emotional trading when push comes to shove. I've made significant improvements in not doing that by setting entries/exits/targets and profit stops. Chewy is the resident master at *not* trading emotionally, so seeing him close short and open long forced me to re-evaluate whether I was married to my position and just seeing $$$. 

My target hadn't been met so I decided to hold, but I realized I should at least take some profits or hedge the position, which I did. 
I'm tempted to. Going back to sleep and pretending it was all just a bad dream D:
Chill out
This is very helpful, Chewy, thanks a lot!
What is the main argument for a bounce here from a technical indicator perspective \- the bullish divergence in the 1h MACD? Or just oversold RSI \(because I don't see a divergence there\)?

[https://imgur.com/a/c9902oP](https://imgur.com/a/c9902oP)
Hey Chew

I see that we keep making higher lows on 15m, is it a good idea to rely on it as on an indicator that we will go up for quite some time now? 
Good point, definitely a possibility \- we'll see :\-\) 
I still think Adam and Eve is in play but they're not gonna make it easy.

The recent volume (4/6 hr charts) is more indicative to me that this IS markdown.
Yes, yes it does. Nice prediction. I'm going to try and get free this afternoon to type up some thoughts, might be tomorrow morning however. It's interesting, yesterday I predicted a BGD, but in retrospect, the same metrics that indicate a BGD are very similar to the ones that indicate a BRD are inbound.

FWIW, several of my stops were triggered on the way down early yesterday as I like to measure moves by standard deviation.
that does look pretty good
Yeah I feel we'll see one more leg down by day's out, which could come very close to liquidation for me.  

Lock in losing almost half my trading stack now, or gamble that I don't lose almost all of it.  Even if I hold on, I think breaking even would still be pretty lucky.  PnL would probably say to let go now, but the thought of a bounce is powerful...
Actually, yeah! I remember a 40% dip in May and June. They recovered obviously. We only started to shoot for the stars once the Segwit/BCH fork unfolded from August onwards.
I'm still looking for that third higher low before a parabolic rise. I have 6k, 6.6k and now (maybe) 8.2 but that seems high. We might get as low as 7.5 so if you're looking for a crash, that would probably be a good point to buy.
This is not the bounce I'm talking about. 

RSI is ridiculously overheated on the 1h through the 6h and is approaching oversold on the 1d. 

I'd expect to see at least a 3% bounce at some point to cool things down a bit followed by a day or so of sideways in the mid to upper $8,000s. 

Sellers *shouldn't* be able to sustain this degree of selling pressure for much longer.

That doesn't mean they won't, but it would be unexpected.

Then he's already hedged...
Then hold your short and enjoy the ride or close your long. 

I'm not suggesting anybody take any action here based on a bounce that may or may not occur. 

But if you are out of position, it's a pretty shitty time to suddenly decide to enter one.
We might, we might not, nobody can say what's gonna happen with 100% probability, but in general shorting or exiting an underwater long position at this RSI level is not smart
Why bother watching when heuristics will suffice? /s
Will do
speaking from experience?
I think you'll have ample time to exit before you will approach the liquidation price. 
yeah im keeping a close eye on the longs. when they capitulate i will buy in
yes that would be my guess, after going up and down the fib stairs. But the fact that fractals are not very reliable and with the consensus coming up this "prediction" will probably fail. 

But if we reach 8800-9000 I think I will go short with a target in the low 8k
I think you added a zero friend.
I stand corrected. Seems like we're falling out currently, and I'm excited for the fireworks. 
I fully support your liberal mindset, though I'm confused, you think 8k is goblin town? 
Yea I'm sure the 4 hour rsi about to dump down to 5 right?
Yep, it seems to be happening. tighten those britches, could get bumpy.
Thanks. Gotta stay vigilant for sure
Resistance?

Snort?

Short? Short! He said Short!!!
Apparently everything seems ballsy today. Anyhow, I think we will be heading down heavily, just like we got rejected from 11.7K the second time. Lets see. 
Until last night I was, I was up by 4%. But wasn't happy with the gains. That same 4% now became -4%.

I think from here it is really difficult to go back up. Thus I joined the shorting boat.
No Panic here... All Bought with Cash!!!
you know max leverage on bitfinex is 3.3x right?

You close the position?
Poor... poor Mike. How will you get by now...
Overbought RSIs hang around longer than oversold RSIs.
Seems like we'll only balance out the RSI a bit through a bearflag and then likely more downside. Feels like the drop from 11.7k imo. Resistance building up substantially.
Whale manipulators don't give a shit about your TA.
> RSI isn't oversold yet on the 1D, but its getting close

We're at 44 (down from around 50 yesterday). We aren't close to Oversold on the Daily at all from my point of view.
Want to go all in so bad...
Lol no. That is a textbook bear flag.

Even if you cut the pole, that is more of an ascending channel than a rising wedge...
theres no capitulation with 31k longs open where probably at least 10k of those are underwater

$8,650 is the first level to look out for. Then $8,800, and finally $9,000. 

I'm probably going to exit 50% at $8,650 and 50% at $8,800. 
Do I think this is going to reverse back into the $9,000s? No, probably not. 

Do I think I can scalp 3% - 5% off of a bounce here? Probably. 
You still holding yours? I set layered stop losses at 8600 and breakeven.
This started much before Upbit news.
I hope we bounce out of this and get back in the 9k zone again, sooner rather than later.
People want their money.
the seller's obviously not on bitfinex.. shorts/longs relatively the same

lol ya right
Agreed, that and those NYC bonuses along with Chinese New Year and we should definitely rally past 11700 soon.
Contrarian take: when the talking heads are parroting [to dumb retail investors] you should long crypto simply "[because conferences](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-bitcoin-could-rally-more-than-70-in-the-coming-week-fundstrats-lee-says-2018-05-08)", you should sell. Just because this strategy (which is no different than "buy the rumor...") somewhat worked the past couple of years doesn't mean it'll work this year.

The smart money saw the calendar months ago.
Wow that is really great to know. Thanks for the info. Don't know how I missed this on the horizon. Don't mean to be greedy with your time, just working late at night, can you link me by chance? 
exactly

plus this time around the support is way worse. I think this time around we'll be seeing $5,000
I wonder why they wouldn't buy/invest in an existing company just like what they did with Oculus. Oculus was also the first few in VR space even before there was a market.
they're just creating a market for bitcoin.. the only way most people can buy an ICO token is with BTC or USDT.

As with Venezuela, I hope Facebook tries their hand at crypto. If they try and compete with bitcoin they will have to make it freely exchangeable, so it will make the rest of crypto that much easier for the masses to access. 
So basically... Basic Attention Token.

Got it.
Ethereum is way too slow to be a social media platform.    It got overwhelmed by a virtual pet app.
WeChat is way ahead of this shit. Kinda weird how Facebook are so far behind, but then I guess they operate in so many countries it's probably harder.
How do you get around fees eating into your profit margins? Or do you just always have limit orders set up?
Nope. Not personally. 

I can make a very compelling argument for doing so from a TA perspective, but my general rule of thumb is to trade what the market **is** doing. Not what I **want** it to do. 

The market is declining, and won't break through the resistance line for that decline for another $100 or so to the upside. 

The market also made a lower low below support at $8,650 or so and is grappling with that area of interest as I'm typing. 

It *could* reestablish that zone as support, but at least at this second it's too early to tell if that's what's happening here.
I'm also not liking the denial of longs.. shorts already covered, longs still mostly underwater and even growing in position.

A sharp drop could force margin calls which could force an avalanche of longs to liquidate involuntarily or panic sell.  That's a 'crowded trade'.

Probably best to wait for a double bottom/higher low or a break of the steep resistance. This could easily be another little bulltrap or bearflag as was the case after the 8850 low couple of hours ago.
no joke... usually I get excited about buys when 4hr is in the gutter.. this sell off has been relentless... it'll turn around eventually but I've given up guessing as to when... tired of walking the tight rope and abandoning positions at the last minute so I'm not underwater


Yeah I already ditched my long here for a small profit.. looks to be the same formation playing out.  I don't think we'll reverse until there's either a capitulation event or we walk down so low that underwater longs give up and cut loses

I've only survived by getting in and out of position several times today which means being glued to the screen and suffering the tedium/anxiety 
tell me when is your least expected moment?
Worst case? We went through 7k range too fast and going to revisit there for some sideways chop.
What about SEVEN??

I think we're close... in fact I feel more certain because I've given up.. which is usually when it reverses :p
Check out the weekly candles. Look at the multi week bull runs prior to December. The price action since early April fits the same pattern
This market never really had 'sense'.
When is that statement not true though?  :P
Yes, there is merit to that approach. For a very tight stop position, I'd be inclined to open short at 8650 and bail at 8725. It should be clear which way this is going in the next 2 hours. 
Hey, that's a solid short and always good to take profits. Adding on a breakdown from 8500 is good, if you can do it with the unreliable mex engine. I hope I don't regret break-even stops. 
It went up on no real news, as well. Are you liking the post december craze phase of Bitcoin?
No News?? Upbit is one of the largest exchanges in the world by volume...
>what is a crossover now might not be a crossover later, right?

What do you mean?

The crossover which already occurred with the close of the daily candle isn't going to change. But yeah, it's possible that it might cross up again.
Those threads were hard to read, but to be fair most of the low effort bearish stuff was perpetuated by 3-4 very active users. Feels a bit more spread out recently.

When are you going to stop betting against the trend
the other traders made me do it
Not drunk enough to type in wrong numbers. Just bought back the same pos I closed.

All good. I don’t really care anyways. This is my trading stack. Stop loss seems fine
Thanks, a nice trade but in the midst of potentially chopping myself up though trying to buy a local bottom ;)

High leverage but only 5% stake.  It was a micro hedge to only capture such a largish move, it was worth almost nothing until now.  If the price goes back up at all the profit would be inconsequential.

If it was a normal position for me, I'd have been like 40% of the stack at 5x (it was about half that at 5% 25x), and I would have taken profits on a portion of it here, probably for the second time.

I opened it because a tiny voice was telling me I would fuckup relonging dips and should at least cover a little.  Then chewy opened up his short and pushed me over the edge of decision. 
Yeah I wish I had setup some long entries with little 2% stakes spread around the full range of the 8000s, with the ability to bail sub 8000 for small loss, rather than having what I have now, where I am letting myself get a little chopped up each plateau or two.

I had done that before the BGD for the 6k range.  But that was different, we were maxed out on RSI, *and* shorts already outnumbered longs, and people were still opening shorts on each bottom failed attempt to go much lower.  Futures were at a discount.

We're no where near that sort of long capitulation yet.
thank you :)
will listen to your advice, thought about selling a bit of my portfolio between 8500-8400 but i changed my mind, will wait if 7800 holds if it gets that low
No but then the market has been reacting long enough to the news and it's time to think of a reversal
That would be something like a 30 min livestreamed show with Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, Ben Bernanke and Roger Ver saying how BTC sucks, that Dow Jones is down requires more quantitative easings and BTC has nothing to offer in terms of countering inflation
I read BTC BBQ everytime I see your username
The last time (15-17 January) it... umm... continued to drop another 1000. There was a strong bounce after that, eventually making it worth even for a long from 1000 above the bottom on Jan. 17.
It's the express line, man. If we don't get off this train soon, couple days, max. 
I think the single most important lesson I've learned trading is that whilst trend analysis and indicators are useful, the fact is that ultimately what the market does is down to people, and people are irrational. 

Consider the recent bullrun even - RSI was considerably overbought for much of it on many timeframes, and people kept trying to call a bounce down which didn't come. Many, many people on here lost money as a result. 

I'm not saying that we won't see a bounce - I think it's fairly likely in the nearish future, but what I am saying is that whilst market indicators can be useful, you absolutely should not be making decisions based solely on them.
Because the spot price has been under the 50 day SMA, so it's become a strong resistance. It can't act as a support because we didn't go over it until last month.

In TA, all strong resistances become strong supports. I think this is the best support we have left in the 8000s, It's also an amazing risk/reward ratio play.
That was oddly specific
dude i lost so much money on Xanax. just been trying to make it back...completely liquidated my trading stack lol and had to start over because I started leveraging like a retard and trading like an idiot 
i went long after binance FUD , the announcement was made that everything is ok and it wasn't a hack but the price still fucking plummeted and i got fucked
To me it looks just like another wild and whacky year in the Bitcoin market, just with bigger numbers. Not like we haven't seen bearwhales trying to manipulate it down. It hasn't worked out for them over time, and I don't see any reason for it to be any different this time. We're still dealing with a commodity that has a limited supply. Anybody dumping will run out of coins at some point.
sadly I think you're right. Next stop shityourpantsville
As Damon said do you really think $7500 is hit today or tomorrow? No breather even though we're oversold on medium timeframes and have had 3 red dailies in a row? I mean it's BTC but you're talking altcoin pump and dump.
You think it'll hit $7500 in one straight shot?
Why?
touche, ill admit, i am privileged so skewed perception but imo, if you cant find at least a glimmer of happiness in your life or future possibilities then you got some changes to make.

Joy does come and go, for me its about remembering those happy times, treasuring them and looking forward to them when things get shitty.

There have been some pretty crazy times but then I just thought about the one or two moments in my life that were absolute bliss and perfection. That always makes it a little bit easier. 

Hahaha, wish these were GCSE's, I'd have another shot at not fucking college up.

Will do sir, packing the vape as we speak, happy days
2 years is also temporary...

its long. but temporary. id gladly wait 5 years if i had to.
Im now more wealthy than I've ever been because of that 2 year down trend.  PLEASE bring it on.

There is no way this is 'the end' as GS and so many others are seriously jumping in the game.  They play out decades long strategies and have the money to stay solvent longer than anyone else.  So... get perspective and trade on it.
yessir, fantastic feeling, so much relief and the thought of guilt free procrastination makes it even better
I'll give entry once we get lower. Don't need to be wrong and have people try to buy up fast or anyone get any ideas with stop loss hunting.
I said I would when it got here and I keep my promises.
>fuck Harvey!

My thoughts exactly.
> Are you one of the biggest positions on Mex?

As best as I know I am. I know of one position larger for sure that's 2x what I have but I'm sure I there are at least a couple others.
I didn't close. I still have it.

Close your position if interest rates are too high and killing you.
I didn't think it'd keep going and break through 8.6. Was a bad call but oh well, nobody's perfect.
He's also on swaps which was paying funding out the butt so that was nice for him, I'm sure. It probably helped quite a bit. I accumulated 5% from swaps the past few weeks which is no small amount. 
That's barely 2% of cumulative BTC daily trading volume on exchanges, without even considering things like Bitmex, OTC trading, or alt/BTC trades.  
its korea they have all kinds of plots and schemes involving the police/politicians/businesses/whales  they all talk to each other
same with a lot of countries the upper class has lots of free time so they just spend all of it thinking of scams.


Truthfully I didn't think the sell off would be this aggressive and was looking for the turn around... at this point, I know there will be a bounce but because price has demonstrably moved below $8600 I'll switch to a majority shorting strategy after this trade.
And how much more it will drop after the bounce too... 
This is basically it... if you can catch price near the bottom, then you can wait for the small bounce.. set stops at break even and then monitor development in case you need to cut it loose.  This is how I've done it all the way down and chipped away with small profits... but obviously it would have been more profitable to setup a massive short at $9300... really didn't think we'd fall this far.  In any case, this is my last attempt looking for a bounce as it seems buyers have vanished. 
If there really are that many, I can see continued pumps/fakeouts to drive the price up, only to allow them to unload in batches.

Only when these coins are fully redistributed to true hodlers will the price be able to truly fly.
Wait for a bounce, you're asking to get rekt shorting here imo
I could bust a load if I saw RSI get to negative numbers, it'd be hilarious
Uh oh, that usually indicates people moving from cold storage to exchanges to sell more. last time the $6k selling let up finally only when the backlog cleared
What strategies do you use to manage your emotions?
Just read the animosity, degenerate racism and plain, good old fashioned bitching throughout this place yesterday for proof of your statement.  .. Amusing as a spectacle though. Hope a better day ahead for all. 
I have learned to love that phrase.. Goblin Town lol. FYI in no trade.. waited and fought my FOMO all day yesterday as I was uncertain how the outcome would pan out. For once as a noob I'm proud as now may look to get a nice long entry.. 
I'm optimistic that we've already bottomed today
Definitely .. if price manages to poke through both shorter term resistances, I'll re-frame to the longer one you've got here... still very early however to make any kind of call
if you think RSI is oversold then why arent you taking profit right now?
What would it take to go back to 9095 at this point? That would be hilarious if there was a BGD that retraced all the way to 9400.
I feel a lot better about losing 0.5 BTC since December through shitty trades now. 
What? Was this like a million dollar pizza kind of thing?
I tried loans there 4 months ago and there were no takers on paltry interest compared to what I was getting on finex. Will look again
Good points. I'm not expecting a long squeeze any time soon (if ever), barring a 30% 1h red candle which I doubt can happen at this stage. Most just that a lot of people assume shorts are piling on here when they really aren't. 
Possible. We'll see. I don't think we've had the "everyone throws in the towel, crypto is dead" moment yet. 
Upbit neglecting it’s fiduciary responsibilities
Bitmex does their combined volume in 9 days.  
That's why I said "I didn't want to admit it". He has been calling every pullback almost perfectly for 2 weeks. The gaps left in the CME are getting filled every time. 
I miss the guy who used to do the regular PnF charts. Don't remember his name though. 
All my stops hit last night...entire trading stack in cash.  Longed BTC 7926-9276 and ETH 426-716 at 1x.  Unless things get lively over the next week I may just pay off all my short term debt and go back to weekly DCA buys for the long term.  
welcome.
I kinda miss that guy to be honest

Satoshi talks about payment channels which are not on chain. I'm on mobile so having a hard time finding the quote. 
"Like satoshi designed"

Assuming that Satoshi actually did say that, which you provided no basis for, he is NOT some divine entity. You think that the conflict of interest is coming from the Bitcoin side? You mean like how CONSENSUS ruled that the blocksize not be increased while second layer permanent solutions were worked on and a few pissed off people that stood to make a ton of money forked it on their own? Where is most of the hashrate? Where are most of the transactions? Where is Bcash's 1MB blocks that it cant even fill before scaling larger? Looks like only about 10% of people that used Bitcoin now use Bcash. It already lost. 

Like with any business. You need scale to have scaling issues and Bcash does not have any scale.

it is possible people think his question is disingenuous 
Just tried finding some data, and 1D, 3D & 1W scale aren't even close to RSI 30 yet (they range from the low to high 40s).

So I'm guessing this means much more pain to come around the corner until those ones pop below 30.

And with that said, here comes the pain

EDIT: At time of posting, price was $8380 having dropped from $8450 in a matter of seconds.
Still holding on to that long for dear life. I still got plenty of margin to add and I'm ready to average down this position.

In hindsight, I should obviously have read the trend signals better and continued staying out of position.
So not the same at all then? Fair enough... and suggests references to past are invalid? 
Very obvious isn't it. 
good bot
I think,  after a sharp drop  every up move that raises the high and low will form a bear flag. I'm still in fiat, but preparing for the possibility of an up move
You're right. Possibly just another bull trap. This is driving me crazy :(
So do people think its a decent time to enter a long given the reasonable bounce from 8.7k? Or the general feeling is that this will go further down?
Been waiting a month to add to my pile.  Was surprised it took this long.
Im saying when he shorted at 8800 a couple weeks ago
And we've read the inverse of this same point just as many times in recent months.
weren't we in a fall before the Upbit news? 
> So you are saying Mike knew about Upbit situation?

Lol, that's quite a jump.
You mean a *bit*coin flip?
>probably

Heh. 
Aren't exchanges not on the chain so to say?
Wasn't planning on longing there. Was more of a "exit or hedge if we get there" question. Thanks for the input. Kinda conflicted on what to do when we meet that line.
Testing the log line now would be incredibly bearish. I would imagine we would see something similar to 2014 if that were to happen where we follow the log line and turn it into support, but because of it being a descending line we slowly drift lower and lower. 6k could turn into hard horizontal support if we're lucky though.
Yeah that was gonna be my "at least hedge point". Hope that works out. Thanks for the input.
There was a little dump leading up to this conference last year and the year before. I don't think it's anything but coincidence though.
Is this Consensus something other than a cheer-leading thing and in what way would it affect price movement?
I don't see how consensus could not help
That fell yesterday 
If that's true, that's actually really shady. 4th highest volume exchange, but bodes worse for Alts (but people fleeing alts is bad for bitcoin too - they flee to bitcoin then fiat).
From what I gather from google translate, it seems to be saying Upbit is being investigated for fraud of some sort. Can't quite figure out what "According to the prosecution, Upbeat is suspected of deceiving investors as if they were in computerized form without holding virtual money" means. And no idea if it's a reliable source.
something about Upbit being fraudulent... anyway we know how Korea fud works 24 hours from now we will learn it is fake and get pamped to 9.5k after everyone panic sells into these massive buy orders
Then you know its time to buy 
Thank you, I totally agree. Its always best to report posts and/or message the mods.  

> Rule #4:  No accusations of rule violations. Calling out other users for breaking our rules is not allowed.  Instead, please report rule violations.

I speculate the rule #4 was made to keep the subreddit drama down and the content isolated to relevant information for traders.
Fully agree with this.

Regardless of anyone's position on the matter, I (and many others I expect) deal with more than enough shit about BCH vs BTC naming from the other 3 subreddits.  This sub doesn't need any of that garbage, for or against.  I think entire conversations discussing it should be removed from here and those involved - on both sides - warned to not start that shit again.
You're asking because he said she was cute, aren't you! Don't worry, I did the same thing.
> Calling Bitcoin Cash "Bitcoin" is really a pathetic attempt by people to claim a name. 


This is factually incorrect. It is a fork of bitcoin. Therefore it is a legitimate contender for the name. By very definition. There is no “pathetic attempt“. This is a technological concept in open source projects. There is no room for this kind of childish insulting.


> If Bitcoin Cash was superior it would be able to stand on its own 


It has stood on its own. It didn’t die.  And it just got added by the largest bitcoin merchant processing company in the world, to their 100,000 Bitcoin merchants. Out of over 2,500 coins, after having serviced only BTC for seven years, they add BCH. 

It’s also being added by every major company in the space. How you can claim it’s not “standing on its own” is bewildering.  

But it is also a new project. Barely 10 months old. It’s going to take time for usership to increase. The project is just about to expand its block capacity this week. It’s a process. It’s an ongoing evolution. And at any point in the future, BCH can become bitcoin if the market so decides. 

Anyone who disagrees with anything I’ve just written, is denying fact to cater to bias. 
The closest it's ever been was being listed as Bitcoin (BCH) next to BTC on bitcoin.com though..
I think it's important we see how cute you are before passing judgement. 
You're turning into a piece of shit, and that's too bad.
if that Upbit bs won't resolve itself quickly and positively  then i don't think 8.7k was the bottom
Zoom out - $7500 area is the linear support.
The bounce wasn't that strong. But there has been a lot of panic selling in the last few hours, a lot of it!

RSI is too heated up on all charts. So long we are holding $8,700, I do not think I will start to worry yet. 
Thanks! :)
I would say mid term but for me to hold a trade longer than the time between lunch and dinner would need me to be under anesthesia LMAO. I am seeing some horizontal resistance @8800 at the moment so unsure if I will hold this one for longer and not exit there for a quick and easy scalp.

Edit: Yeah already exited lmao sry for that but 110$ profit per BTC in 15 min is too good to pass up.
No but I am a disciple! Didn't believe his CME gap theory until I looked myself on tradingview...
Absolutely, you and me both. Once this sub starts calling for capitulation it’s time to start buying.
Going long here I don’t think mr Kobayashi works on weekends

If someone hits you over the head with a bag of money and spits in your face you take the money and thank him.  Or you're not cut out for this shit.


I would agree, but a lot times it is just what you say due to people's confirmation bias
The fact that eludes so many posters here leads me to believe we're dealing with people too young to have been taught that lesson.
If you cannot profit from my hints I’m sorry for you
Not planning on holding this long at all
still too early
according to this chart [https://bitcoinwisdom.com/markets/bitfinex/btcusd](https://bitcoinwisdom.com/markets/bitfinex/btcusd)

it is actually 44.39, so just slightly below 50.
very hard to do. Especially when you get burned very often doing just this
Agree. For best results you have to sell when you don’t really want to. By the time you panic it’s way too late.
I’m just saying selling during dips is stupid.

Could short now and have a better entry that 8680
I didn’t, but 9100 how does someone look at 8680 and consider it the same scnario as 9100.
then sell now, because the price is 8800
An even larger dip happened right before Consensus last year. The price then started shooting up after the conference
% long is still over 60%: https://imgur.com/a/f68vbLX

Insanity. Bulls are not giving up. Haven't seen a cascading liquidation candle yet -- more down incoming IMHO.
Yup. Waiting for this.
This is exactly what I did. 

I had three positions in the 6k range. Typically I hold a bit longer but as you said, almost doubling, that was too attractive and I took profits. 

I’m laddering in new positions though. 
Some of us measure our profits in Bitcoin.
yeah, they arent long and strong like the original hodlrs, just daytraders with more 0's

problem is shorts are the lowest i've seen in forever.  First time under 20k.


yeah, if we go down hard again, I really think we will see 5s. But what do I know? Im just gambling at this point. Dont nothing make too much sense anymore to me
Yeah, it’s worth a shot. RSI on most time frames is pretty low, so not bad r/r

Also, I anticipate consensus will lead to some kind of pump

I just have no idea what is going on, but I closed my last short at 8800, so makes sense to go long with tight stops.

If BTC does go lower, then Ill just reopen a fresh new long
They didn't pump 25% in a day since December and of course it was bullshit back then as well.
Let's be honest - it wasn't stable. Small dollar moves as a percentage of current prices but at the time it was as volatile as ever.
stable ?  when?
Yes, already had 2 walls of the same size bought today so this is at least the third one. 
'bad' lol
Everyone withdraw and find out. Exchanges adding fake supply suppress prices.
Perma bears are perma bears regardless, they just come out to talk trash during dumps. Not buying in to this oversold bounce about to happen would be crazy.
I'm operating under the assumption that the bear market from January was ended and this is a typical pullback in a bull-ish market. Could certainly be wrong but I think this pullback is enough for me to hop back in on.
I just drew them so they converge in October around 6k to bolster my prediction with some sudo TA. As is tradition.
That screen cap is a week old actually. Waited until after my selling to post it. The lines are just there to console me as I part with my precious Bitcoins.
I suppose it might bounce quite hard at some moment. RSI are quite hot, but the downtrend is too strong... No actual stops. Planting alarms @ 8800 for reevaluation
Have you backtested this at all on Bitcoin Legacy?
The low-volume sell off actually has only slight less volume than the more recent sell off.
Source?
Or it's just the guy(s) who accumulated between $6.5-7k. 
Panic sells will be real then, I can already imagine the news saying that this Bitcorn is ded
yeah, that's that I meant, a small fake bounce and then a further drop  to follow. I suppose we'll see soon enough :)
I was using it to make my positions transparent.

There’s not much by way of TA I can offer the sub, but I’d like to participate and was testing out “logging” my positions on the bot for others to see.

Maybe I’m using it incorrectly. 
The open and close dates are registered for anyone to check. If someone does this often then it's probably not safe to trust the results, if its the exception i see no problem with that.

If we start to see users abusing this then they can be blocked from the site. Until then the focus is on getting it to work without glitches and add features.
You and slayer are correct . . no volume. Average Joe isn't buying because the biggest news to the general population since the ATH is the crash from the ATH and the associated pain/dissapointment etc. Can't get away from this. People in general don't give a damn about tech/future use. 
Depends who you buy it from.
At which point they'll just start offering $10bn cash to the 22-year-old MIT kid who actually made one. 
Wtf is Bitcoin Legacy?
How is Ripple third on CMC?

Stop! You can not afford to feed yourself. Must rationize. One slice of bread per day.
anxiety - you're an anxious eater.

disqualified.. lack of emotional affect.

happy + bullish on future = optimism,

angry + bullish on future = denial

I'd say optimism for you then



i'd say thats optimism

June 2018? I think you're putting too much hope in what news may come out from the NY Bitcoin Week.

Here's a headline I expect from that conference: "Lighting Network is going to take over the fucking world! Coming soon to a usable public app / interface in 2020! Just a tiny bit more testing left to do, and besides, we don't want to make it accessible / easy for anyone who holds less than a PhD in computer science / software engineering"
Because the market wants to go up.  If he waits, he'll take a bigger loss.  He's going to take a loss anyway.
Unless I'm mistaken, he gravitates to the perpetual swaps. Where liquidity is rarely a problem.

He could market-close a 40,000,000 contract position on perps and only move the price about 2%. 
He closed it earlier this morning, fwiw
shorting $9990 was so obvious and easy. Just like $19.8k...you could literally have 100x shorted and not even been that uncomfortable 

Should've shorted the shit out of $9.9k. So many chances. So many hours spent up there and we were all fuckin pussies
It’s after the fact. Completely pointless and useless. What was the purpose of the post?
actually if you check back I think you'll find i've always stated that the bear market is still here and that this is all just over optimism. 

So I disagree with your statement. 
It is largely irrelevant, bulls are just desperate to find a reason for the sell off. Now it is clear that fluctuation above 9k was Wyckoff distribution phase.
Why? 
I don't know why I'm so angry whenever I read idiotic analysis like this one. No offense dude, I honestly believe you have the best intention, even uploaded a graph, but this is not the way markets work. Market trends move prices to major price zones, ranges keep them in the zone. Time in range usually > time trending. If your scenario happened it would mean that giant ass penant is a range, which obviously it's too big to be considered a range. 

Noobs beware, you'll likely lose more money reading this sub than reading a published website or book on TA because 90% of the comments are like this one, best of intentions, completely uneducated bullshit. Reading too much bs can really fuck up the goggles you're wearing to analyze the markets. (hint: you're not suppose to wear any goggles. Much harder than it sounds)

You must be new.
The first bounce was weak, we bounced again on a double bottom a lot weaker. 
Conculsion: Dead cat bounce till now.
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-11/cryptocurrency-exchange-upbit-raided-by-south-korean-authorities
They're being investigated for fraud
Yep, the vast majority of alts are down quite a bit in BTC ratio over just the last hour. Could be creating sell pressure as those people flee to fiat.
See other comments in this discussion. Some Korean source is saying Upbit has been caught or raided or something for fraud by selling coins they didn't have to customers. It doesn't have a ton of BTC volume, but its got a lot of Alt volume.
The Korean government is not in a war against crypto so this is not some tactic.  Corruption is rampant in Korea, just look at what happens to all their presidents.  
"And even if they are later charged and convicted of that, it doesn't mean that they did it."

\- Time to remove your tin foil hat
Yeah, I tried to get a wedge formation here and there's no case for it. All we've got is an absurdly steep resistance line that puts us down at the log line by Monday. Doubting that holds. 
what about something like this?
https://www.tradingview.com/x/VDgW65Ox/
I got NORD. Gdax just knows me.
But what if... it is? 
precision : the gain is the same in USD value, not in btc quantity if it's an inverse contract (like bitmex)
It'll likely never hit zero. It's always going to have a very niche use that is nonzero. 
Are you serious? Are we back to "It's going to $3K!!" or were you being ironic? I hope the latter because $3K is just the impossible dream at this point. So many people would load up way before that.
Can you read whole sentences and not only three words ?
>yeah, you never short something like this.

I'm not the biggest maximalist here? Uh, anyone who's witnessed one of my rants want to chime in here? 
What please is a "hidden wall"?
yes, that's distribution.  When a whale really wants to sell thats what he does.  But i've seen panic dumping after hacks and stuff, sometimes you dont have the luxury of time.

Yes, they would.  If they actually wanted to sell, they would not do it with these big market dumps which is how we know this is a childish outburst, not a real dip from the perspective of the market writ large.  Hoping to take advantage at $8250, personally.
You could be right, and I hope you are. That would represent a lot of wealth changing hands from the old guard to the new. We shall see. 

I will tell you this, though: In the end, it will be the bears capitulating.  People seldom regret buying Bitcoin (over time), but they do regret selling it.  These guys are selling a fuckton.
probably because most people trying to make short term predictions are losing money and the one time they make money (or don't lose it) they are very happy and need to gloat about it
I already knew what bitcoin was and googled it before I bought
How exactly do you think we hit $19k in December:

- Media frenzy
- Mass hysteria
- Every man and their dog buying crypto

So yes, to a large extent, this massively speculative market is reliant on average Joe's buying in and being the greater fool.

Still enjoy watching the bleed, it appears it is you who is the illiterate one.

But you do sound like another TA "google" expert, you realise that in the real financial world, the one in which I come from, TA is taken with a VERY LARGE pinch of salt, yet yourself and many other "experts" here seem to take it as gospel on a daily basis, it's quite hilarious to watch.
It's Technical Analysis. 
> We could bounce up easily anytime.

Based on what? We dumped straight through 9K, 8800, and 8600, then consolidated long enough to refill the orderbook with shorts/sells above and cool short and mid-term RSI. Bouncing up would be far from easy. 
Again, not bounces in 2018
Like I said, I'm not the shorting type.  If we don't get one more big dump by NY market close today, I'm going to say this dump is over, and bears will resume getting gored.
I'm leaning fakeout until I see 84xx. 
was watching that channel too, could dump again. sigh.

I'm watching the [descending channel](https://imgur.com/AWqZjMQ) also, broke out of it and has been grinding it as support.
It's now back inside the channel and the wedge now , but strugling.
These posts are more annoying than OPs. He made a prediction which is that it will break within 2 hours, not a lot of information, but it's obviously more than "it will either go up or down"
I agree with this
I am newbie feel free to teach me.  
I dont think that  8770 wall ever gonna get fill, either pull or never touch.
I know, I meant I'm buying a ton right now 
Yep, this has really made for a great correction for alts. A lot are down 15-20% on the daily. Great buying opportunity. I don't think 8.5 will give up as easily as most think, but only time will tell. Either way, I'm just looking to gain more of the alts I value currently  
Maybe
How do you do that?
https://imgur.com/a/5qZYjXW
This.
Its all good, not concerned, worth it for the fun alone. Comment below made me laugh but i guess there is a point behind it. I mean everthing benefits from a little context. It is a big event. So many good technical, experienced people here so no offence intended. Sometimes a little "creative delivery", re-direction/distraction helps re-focus the mind :)
I like it.
difficulty adjusts every 2016. blocks
where do you see a descending triangle? i just see a downtrend channel
Yeaah this bounce is disapointing. Still wouldnt short though
Timing is too perfect to be a coincidence 
Yes, suddenly everyone need to buy something so they sell all at once.
Past years it always led to a pump. 7000 are participating this year. More awareness, industry leaders talking etc. Positive news and developments. I think this a dump to accumulate at lower prices to sell at post consensus pump. Timing is almost too perfect and lack of no apparent reason for the dump increases this probability. 
Despite a few indicators e.g. (4 hours macd and stoch rsi, 1 day stoch rsi) suggesting we are generally oversold, the 1 day macd suggests we are going to fall further and it always correlates with a drop looking back in time.  I can't see any convincing chartable support until 7400.. then 7000. Does anyone have some convincing lines between 8700 and 7400?
edit: on even longer timescales, the 4 hour and 1 day macd are reducing in volatility (from ath) to a point in the not to distant future suggesting a big move/genuine reversal is coming, it just hasn't happened yet.
Lol. I'm not drunk or rampaging.

If Tom Lee's right I will voluntarily retire from this subreddit, lolol.
Yup, my bearish comments always get downvoted no matter how substantiated they are. However, a bulltard comment saying "moon soon" will get upvotes.
Lol, what? That's how chain upgrades work, dummy. They work on new transactions, not old ones.

There were 1700 coins there when I was writing my post - after I was done writing that one sentence, it was down to 400, then disappeared soon thereafter
would be impressive since their prose is very different. I talk to dush in discord and he's not commenting here lately 

btcqq has a slightly different sense of humor- his sarcasm is directed towards the bitcoin frenzy/mania itself, not its proponents. Dushman's criticisms are leveled more at the people "falling" for it
Pretty similar, right /u/btcqq ?

Liked that guy because he was always harsh truth. Really would like to know if it's him.
he's a minnow

I'm thinking about it. Keep reporting. Try not to engage. If you think the mods aren't seeing it then DM us about the issue and make your case. This isn't the place to do that.
How about not banning people because of their opinions or their way of formulating their thoughts? If you don't like it, ignore me, you whiny, close-minded baby. Go do something useful with your time!

True, but I'm gambling on this time being different than that time. If it breaks 8.6k I'll exit though haha.

Didn't realize slurs were allowed in this sub. FFS have some respekt. Booyakasha!
I agree fake bitcoin lies need to be gone, its great to know there is a follow rational thinker here. Don't worry we will hit 2k soon.
Segwit is an evil core invention to push their centralized banking system called the lightning network on everyone.

As opposed to the original bitcoin design which have uncapped blocks in satoshis infinite wisdom knowing we could have infinite potential for growth.

By making fees go up too push people back into the banks arms core caused the december crash and slowed bitcoins growth by rough 200%, if we all just swapped over to the real bitcoin during the crushed flippening we would be at 1 million right now as those 32 mb blocks would be full and we could start preparing for the 1 gb blocks

In a few years, people won't be able to imagine buying them this low.
There was a time those were high friggin prices and you felt like a fool for giving all your money away to the early adopters.
There's no arguing with this mentality as a winning long term strategy. But it has limits. 

I believed in Blockbuster in 1995. A lot of people did. Holding that stock for 23 years was not a sound investment, and there's pretty much 0 chance of that investment ever becoming a winning investment again for someone holding it from the 90s. 
(A lot of people think that buy and hold is a crypto philosophy and don't realize it's a finance fundamental)


Don’t forget you’ll have to outpace inflation! 
Historical performance.. again, not indicative of future results. At some point down the road BTC *will* peak, that might be at $100k or $1m OR it already happened at $20k and it's a slow bleed out from here on. Nobody knows. 

I'm a huge believer in BTC's potential to act as a decentralized global currency, but at some point adoption and utility will need to actually occur, speculation won't prop the price up forever. 
Actually, "taking early profits over and over again" is a great way to get rich.
Hahaha I appreciate the thought, although fuckharvey and someone else here who PM'd me in private have been holding a short out longer.

Fuckharvey has been holding out the longest but a guy PM'd me thanking me for my comments and he actually said he shorted $19k. Amazing. He said he was adding from $9-10k, too, so the guy clearly knows how to call a top
A thousand times this. I was having a pretty awful losing streak, so I took two weeks off. I’m feeling a lot better now. Would absolutely suggest anyone else who is stressed by all this do the same. 
Determine if you really enjoy trading or not and if you're willing to work at disciplining yourself and managing your emotions to make it back.

Trust me, it screws us all over. Even the best traders here cut big winners too early and cut big losses too late. 

The best thing you can do is separate your personal feelings from your trading strategy- figure out your signals, and do a lot of self-evaluation. Understand your weaknesses and work at them

Write down your trades- keep a journal. It helps a lot. Trading is much more about self-discovery than people realize.

Write down each trade and when you look back at it ask yourself "even if this was a loss, can I feel comfortable having made this trade? Was it a good trade?"
Did you actually lose money or lost possibilities that would get you money?

Been through both. You need to learn how to deal with it. It took me a lot of time but I'm finally there.

Just don't rush it.
That's a smarter approach than I've taken. 

Good plan. 
Got that drawn? Not seeing it.

Reminds of my short $8,735 from a couple weeks back, which got liquidated..
Chewy's fuckin awesome
The only really compelling argument I can make from a technical standpoint is oversold RSI.

Although, to be fair, that could also be resolved by some considerable sideways chop.
The market is indeed making higher lows (and also higher highs) on the 15m. 

The wedge that others have been concerned about is more of an ascending channel now:

https://imgur.com/a/p2CJBcY

This channel could hold until the end of time, since it's parallel. 

But I'd say with near 100% confidence that it will break one way or the other before the end of time.

All kidding aside, I'd just wait for it to break one way or the other if you aren't in position currently. Long an upside break or short a downside break.
Either way its a coin toss, so anyone can pick which pattern worked and brag :D

it definitely could be, and I will be watching what happens after we finally bounce. 
I'm not sure, I had it drawn on my chart, but even extending the right side of the rounded bottom, this still fell out. Not saying it's not possible, but it's becoming increasingly construed. 
It’s looking less likely but yeah I guess it’s still in play
I suspect we will get only as low as ~$7.8k before bouncing significantly, to the point where bears will start asking themselves "are we going to goblin town or not?"

what happens after that will determine if we continue to dump or not.

The trend overall since Jan has been down so I personally predict more downwards movement- and this run-up has really been the "maximum pain" meme necessary to push us downwards through $6k.

$6k is a wall of spirit- the spirit of the bulls has to be broken for people to sell through it. Reaching $10k and getting rejected incredibly hard was the only thing that would weaken the $6k wall enough for us to dump through

edit: although I will say that, if we get there, a triple bottom off of $6k would be about the most bullish thing that's happened since the triple bottom in 2015/2016, whenever it was.

Yeah, your thoughts about the indication for BGD/BRD is true. this movement is actually really odd, the way it's moving down is similar to the way an asset/BTC moves up, not down. Downward moves are usually not sustained- they are dumps with capitulation wicks. This is a sustained move.

It's really odd
just look at the chart man

Willing to hold upwards of 3 months like I did with my last position. I'm just going to have to live with my "buy low" price, and wait until it becomes a "sell high".
Same. 
Being right is fun haha. Unfortunately it doesn't happen to me too often :P
sub 6k is goblin town
Locally speaking yes. The old Goblin Town of 6k has been refurbed, the local council has invested time into it's development and made it more attractive to younger and more affluent people....so 8k.

Rekt Chad valley is at 6k.

Stinky Bell End is at 4k.


Well it's moving aggressively that's for sure. 
rsi doesn't matter when its rekt
This is why u csnt rely on that bruh 
Yeah, not saying you're wrong, just saying I'm out. Was late to the party, won't be going in here.
That's the main problem, we set our goals too high, and after being in profit we just don't content for less, "just a retrace, no problem", "ok breakeven, not closing now" and then we are forced to pull the plug or just go all in and hope to not getting liquidated.

I think i'll start to move my stops lower to like 8769 or so, just in case a BGD appears i still keep some profits. Already cashed out 25% @8689 so my fees are paid and now all is profit.
>Holy fuck.
>
>You close the position?

That's from my cold storage portfolio, not from a trade. I'm hodling some alts. 
probably. its looking pretty rekt. would be nice to bounce here though and not fuck the bands up completely on the daily
Wasn't super clear TA, but a breakdown was pretty obvious.
Ah shit, 3rd time this happen today - I'm not German :D I live here since 5 years but barely speaks it :p working for an international company, only speaking English; I know the basic rude part of German language though

Cool, clearly you don't think we are going to go sub 8k without a bounce given your position but could it happen? Thanks for the reply 👍
I haven't closed mine, but I opened a 20x long for 50% of the short position here at 8430 with stops under 8300, and I set stops on the short just past the downtrend resistance line. Basically hedging my short (lol)? I have to get a little creative as I have no cold storage. 

I know odds are decent that we dump below 8300 and bounce off 8200, but I'll be moving my stop down as we move along our trendline.
Where will you cut and run if things go south? I entered at 8450, and I feel like the bounce may not come (after all, minor support turned resistance at 8500?)
I am, I set my stop just above resistance line, roughly here: https://www.tradingview.com/x/TOnUQ6FL/
Ya never know man. BTC crazy like that ...

Yes, possible. Buyer interest hasn't been the same since Feb. no matter what the cheerleaders seem to think.
FaceBux would probably implement their own credit card based gateway.  Their whole goal would be to keep full control.
The ICO market has driven ETH more than anything.
Yup pretty much. 
What can you do with it? Pay friends? Companies? I could almost envision a weird new barter society cropping up if people could seamlessly pay people who they're only slightly familiar with.
He probably is just closing above 1&#37; to compensate for the fees. The bot also compensates 0.125&#37; in the PnL calculations \(should be 0.25&#37; but i messed it up in the last update\). 
thanks , always useful.
chewtoy as soon as you see something positive, ive been waiting since 9k for an opportunity to get my main stack in good, and just hodl for a year.  I think this is our last correction before the major bull run (if the bull case plays out).

Max leverage for Bitfinex is something like 3.3x 

A cascade of long margin calls on Bitfinex is an incredibly rare event. I'm struggling to recall one since the drop from $300 to $160. 

Most will either continue to add and avoid liquidation, or capitulate long before they're margin called. 
Yeah the longs/shorts have me worried too. I'm happy I decreased my exposure a bit and will probably wait out what happens over the next few days. Too risky for me. 
We're expecting a bounce, so probably not now? 
Borrowing this from /u/beastly_beast's [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8bnetl/daily_discussion_thursday_april_12_2018/dx968n9/) after the BGC which I think is very accurate:

https://i.imgur.com/bM6dLsH.png
https://i.imgur.com/tFgvUYU.png

Price discovery happening in the near future between $7.2k and $7.8k seems completely plausible.
I'm not the person to make predictions about a worst case because I have no clue. But I think the 7k is a good area to re-evaluate the scenario. To be fair, I was most afraid of another slow-bleed scenario, but this really isn't slow bleeding, so I guess that's good in a way.
In the center of a ranged channel, at least for me.  May as well wait in that case. 
You don't always have such a narrow trading range with imminent breakout, which makes placing stop orders more tricky.
I just took profits because i really needed the confidence boost. If i was in profit above my initial investment i might have done the same with stops at breakeven.

My last stop is @8769 just in case a BGD appears without warning.

our 3 basic fundamentals - 'some dude bought/sold a lot'  'some dude said btc is shit/moon' and 'exchange X opened /got hacked'

Then we wonder why our market is dominated utterly by TA.  There are no fundamentals.




> It went up on no real news

What? Nov/Dec were months were media (news) talked a lot of BTC which amplified the hype by a lot. It's not necessarily news like "new technology" It's also just coverage.
the CEO is corrupt like many CEO/leader in korea.. just scamming investors by overrpresenting his numbers.  No hack.

Next time ;)
this is how it kinda meandered down last time. tons of little bounces as traders kept trying to get the bottom and they kept selling back at a loss when it didn't bounce 
i read the news.  OK mt gox 8k coins.. big deal that's a 1hr candle on binance.  Why the freak out?

the extra B is for BYOBB.
I didn't, but I will now.
> the fact is that ultimately what the market does is down to people, and people are irrational.

But TA is supposed to be a reflection of this irrational human behavior.  So it is "baked in" to the indicators.


Yes indeed, had my head in my ass on that.

Just not feeling confident since we blasted through it in march on the way down from 11.7
Yeah, I wasn't being serious. I don't think I've ever actually had benzos, and when I read stories like yours, I'm glad I haven't.

I'm a pretty neurotic person, so they'd probably help, but I'd rather meditate.
Certainty is the path to the broke side.  
My pants are already full sir.
I don't know if it will hit today or tomorrow. Best I can say is that within a few days it seems very likely. That may not be of much help to daytraders though. I'd be more confident of seeing $8k ish today or tomorrow since that would be a completion of the H&S ($10k top, $9k neckline)
Sure it could do - or it might take a few more days. If it happens very quickly then it risks spiking a bit lower, i.e. 7k on the tail, but I'd expect a BGD from there.
It might eventually hit $7,500 or even lower slowly.
> Why?

Just too much of a steep, fast drop and a reasonable bounce is in order at some point before long


this kind of thinking is how people lose all their money in the first place. nothing is guaranteed, especially with alts...
Yea, I figured that's probably safer. do you short futures or swaps? if it's been on swaps this whole time, how has the funding been since December? Have you overall profited? 
Fair enough.
Yeah fuck harvey. Fucking douchebag won't ever shut up about his position.
You were on swaps that whole time?

edit: If you had entries at 15 and 17 then I assume you'd have to have been. No liquidity on anything else for 13M either. Damn. 
Oh, you added after we bounced from 6k already?

Well, really nice and very long position, but I don't get why you didn't close it when we were at 6k for second time.

Right, nobody's perfect, I'm not criticizing here, just curious about resoning of decisions you made.
[deleted]
2% volume but only in sell direction has big impact. Remember Willy?
"I know there will be a bounce "

As someone who has been trading for over 8 years I can tell you I have fallen prey to this type of thinking many a time and lost several accounts along the way. 
This does not have to bounce. It doesn't matter how oversold it is it can keep going. Not saying what it will or won't do but don't trade asumming it HAS to do something.
Yea this is that thing I was talking about why I don't feel comfortable scalping. The 1d bbands have now been breached too, which is pretty bearish, so I'm just watching carefully for what happens next. 

I really don't think we can break anywhere below $7950 without a relatively significant bounce, so scaling into a long here isn't a bad idea. But I guess the market can always go full retard. 
And you still short from 10 I assume?

And I thought hedging at 9.4 is stupid cause I can get rekt by BGD...
Do you know of any site that has a graph or table showing the total output size (in BTC) of each block?  I can find it on blockchain.info but for all but the latest 5 blocks I have to click through each block manually.

Trying to see if that theory holds - if so, total outputs probably rose a lot as cold storage coins moved.
Wanking furiously 
20 minutes of daily meditation (Zazen) 
The main one for me has been separating my personal feelings and judgments on bitcoin from my positions. I am still working on it- but even if you think bitcoin is a piece of shit you should still long or expect upwards movement sometimes. And if you think it's the best thing in the world you should not expect it to go up forever.

Separate your personal feelings from the market- the market will consistently disagree with you.

Another one is constantly re-evaluating if you'd open or close a position here. If your short is underwater, ask yourself- would I open a short here? If not, then you should probably cut losses. If yes, then ask yourself if you can stomach an even larger loss if the trade continues to not go your way. 

Set a line in the sand for how much money you're willing to lose and don't cross it. 

If you *EVER* find yourself asking "Why the fuck are people buying here?" or "Why would anyone sell their coins here?" especially while you're underwater, you are looking at the market the wrong way.  The market doesn't give a shit what *you* would do. It just does whatever it wants. It can make absolutely 0 sense for a very long time. You have to work with what it gives you, don't try to make too much sense of it. 

The most important thing is simply separating your trades from your emotions. Ask yourself "Am I doing this because I'm upset/euphoric/desperate/greedy? Or am I doing this because I really believe that this trade will be profitable?"
Naturally chilled plus cynical of human rationality in general keeps me nice and aloof. If that fails... go rock climbing to gain perspective :)

Do the opposite of your inclination.
Indica. 
I didn't notice any racism.  Someone said "nigga" in a joking way, but that isn't necessary racist.  Maybe you are talking about something else, but I missed it if so.   

Of course when you have people of different opinions...and vastly different IQ levels, you are going to have some arguing and animosity.  Dumb people get easily frustrated when presented with something that they can't understand.  And smart people can be a bit arrogant at times.

But if BTC keeps dropping, tempers will flare even more.  Most people have long positions, especially the holders, who have given up control of their financial well being to everyone else who trades in the market.
you run the risk of getting chopped up from either chop or high volatility. I suspect he will eventually close it when things get truly retarded though.

but RSI isn't at "this is fucking stupid" levels yet. It's just getting there. 
I just did.
I lost 0.5 BTC since April through shitty trades, no worries

I didnt lose the BTC trading though (at least not a lot of trading). Im up from my trading somewhat, but not much
More like blew a fuckton on silk road kinda thing.

Lost old wallet.dat files (formatted hard drives), got hacked, malware stuff, spent a lot on weed, shifted a ton to Litecoin in 2013 and shifted back to BTC in 2015/2016.

Just a lot of stupid shit

A lot of people forget that back in the day we didn’t hve mnemonic seeds. You hd to store every private key individually. And let’s just say over the years, you forget about some of the private keys. I had a bunch of computers sonce I started, and it’s not trivial to keep track of all of em
How many btc does it take to make it worth it to loan out? Is there any chance of losing it when you loan? 
Yeah, I don't know why people are talking about a short squeeze. That's not really on the cards (although a random green dildo could certainly happen anyway, shrug).
me neither, futures still at a premium. Honestly I'm just looking for real capitulation. We could triple bottom off $6k 
Didn't feel that when it was down to 6400-6500. Never even felt absolute panic.
Share your sources / links ?
Whenever I go back to xbtusd and see the orderbook activity after using any other instrument for awhile, I feel like I'm going to have a seizure.
Can you maybe give some links to his pullback predictions?
Merlin or something. IIRC back in 2015 with price around $200 he called the bottom of the 18 month bear market and called for a big bull run. Still one of the best predictions ever seen on this sub.
joyrider5 or merlin560 probably
as in also done trading this insanity?

I have lost a little over 0.5 BTC.

Which in the absolute worst possible case cost me a little over 800 bucks. Not that I actually give a shit, but I spend way too much time worrying about totally irrelevant sums of money.

Done wasting my time trying to trade when moves always happen when I am least willing to watch the charts. Life is too short to worry about money.

Back to HODLing for me
Me too. Even his shitposts had a bit of quality. And he was a nice balance to the full bulltardation we get here after a 2% rise.
Simply because you're flipping the vernacular to what the BCH shills are clamoring for, despite not being a BCH shill. 
I swear at this point I could just copy and paste the same stuff over and over. So here goes again: nobody has a problem with layer two in the bitcoin cash camp. The problem is strangling layer one in the meantime. Strangling it indefinitely. It was supposed to be both. 

Nobody has ever claimed the layer two should never exist. You’re getting confused. You’re biased, and you’re going too far with it and demonizing BCH. 

They are going to do both. You guys are going to strangle layer one because it’s not financially profitable to the corporation that currently runs Bitcoin Core. Blockstream has already stated publicly they plan to charge for everything. That’s not the bitcoin I signed up for.  

The Market will decide which one wins.
Wait what, is Btrash called Legacy now or is that the spork?

What next, Bcash Apocalypse
Nothing wrong with payment channels. 

There is something wrong with preventing on-chain growth in an attempt to force users to use payment channels. 
I think you miss the point of bigger blocks.

Bitcoins blocks were never supposed to fill up.

Look at the average fee right now. Anytime there's a major price shift everyone floods the network and fills the blocks.

BCH is going to a 32MB cap so the blocks never fill up so fees never rise above a penny.
So now you call BTC "Bitcoin Legacy" and Bcash "Bitcoin". You are literally the most pathetic person on this sub. 
Yeah. You guys have been saying BCH is going to die for about 10 months now. 

Still waiting.  Watching literally every major player in the industry add support for it in the meantime.

You’re delusional. 

You can come on Reddit and type your own reality as much as you like. I just saw a bitpay add BCH to 100,000 merchants. 

You know.  In the real world. That place that you don’t reside. 

The biggest BITCOIN merchant processing company in the entire industry just added bitcoin cash. 

Yet you’re on here talking like a maniac about how it’s bullshit and going to fail.

Do you realize how delusional you are?

Blockstream publicly announced that they plan to make money off of every one of their products they’ve coopted bitcoin for. Yet you say “that’s just a conspiracy”. 

Go read the transcript from the interview with their CTO. 🙄

You literally ignore reality happening all around you, while hurling insults at everyone like they’re the idiots. It’s fascinating watching people like you function. You would be a psychologists wet dream.

Make sure you specify that when you call it a cancer then. Or you’re going to get corrected.  Also: glad to see you’re finally coming around on the project itself.
As someone said yesterday, the downvote option is ridiculous. 
I agree, this does seem possible.
Normally that means it's possible. Under the last 24 hours conditions  . . it's very likely.
This bubble popped. 

It would make more sense to compare bubbles than it would to compare a bear market to a two year long bull market. 

The psychology driving the market is totally different. 

For reference you should look up major announcements in 2014 and see how the market reacted. 
The important bit will be what happens here: https://www.tradingview.com/x/fTzfYY2P/  

We dropped about 10% from yesterday, and have retraced about 2% of it. Normally I'd expect that technical bounce to be over 3%, but we'll see if the downtrend holds with a dump off the trend line. 
we bounced off daily horizontal support so this would be a good entry around 8750.

breaking below 8600 would be bearish af
i don't think it about TA at this point , remember "binance hack"? it was good from TA standpoint but the price still plummeted like crazy even after the announcment was made that it's all OK 

be careful 
Of course they think both and every other combination, but I am not longing here yet even though a bounce is likely.  Too much downside risk.
And we went to $9900??? So being wrong by 15% only to now be in the green by 6% is why some of you will never make money trading...
agreed
Upbit? What happend? Link?
Edit: k just saw it
That is true, and I think some of them probably lend out more than they actually have.  This is why I send most of mine to cold storage and strongly recommend others do the same.
How and when we get there are important questions to consider when deciding what to do there. Does the line coincide with another significant number (say, $9000) as we are approaching it? What's the volume like? How far up have we moved prior to meeting it, or are we just drifting sideways through? Are there any significant news being announced as we approach it? A lot of things to consider. 
Agreed. Honestly, breaking below 8K would be incredibly bearish, as we've been over it a solid 4 weeks. I might see a dip to 7800 but we'd almost have to get a technical bounce there. It doesn't seem like 8500 is going to put up much of a fight, so it's up to the 8200-8000 range for now. 
All I'm thinking of it as is heightened media coverage and public awareness, as well as a mass gathering / echo chamber for people bullish on crypto. I don't think it amounts to any fundamental market change, but I could absolutely see it translate into a "summer camp high" short-term pump. If we'd held above 9200 and that pump pushed us over 10K, it could have continued the upward trend. This 10% drop significantly lowers the odds on that occurring, though. 
consensus gonna be a buncha ico shills talking about how bitcoin is trash and they're the new future

it's gone corporate

Nice catch, too much time in the 9's
You would expect some level of quality from Upbit because of their partnership with Kakao and Bittrex but they are definitely shady.  Worst customer service, or rather nonexistent customer service.  Non-functional phone number, non-responsive email, and no one responds on kakao customer service either.   They are the lone exchange that caused all the talk about banning exchanges back in January.  The government had to issue a statement that if any exchanges are not willing to self-regulate (cough cough Upbit) we will ban that exchange.  They were indirectly relaying that message to Upbit in my opinion but it got totally blown out of proportion for the whole industry here.
Name doesn't check out.
Not really. There was a rule change with minority accumulated POW. So it's an alt.
I say that as someone relatively pro-BCH.
Alright. Lets just call every coin Bitcoin now since they are all open source. Hey, did you see how Bitcoin did the other day? Much better than Bitcoin, if they just did what Bitcoin did then Bitcoin would be perfect. 

Sounds pretty fucking retarded doesnt it?
despite the ~~ban~~ I think this comment is brilliant. Thanks for a good laugh. 
Can you link me the upbit news? I'm looking on cryptopanic but I can't find anything...
How do you know this is panic selling and not taking profit/stop loss?

Wait, what? Some guy assaults you and spits in your face, your advice is to rob and thank him? 
exactly this, I'd rather get early information than losing money, my feelings have no say in it
I mean I was short anyway.  The market was due for correction and entered a temporary bear trend, long before the MtGox movement.  We're due for a reversal back to bullish trend in the next day or two.

By the way, I don't think people downvoted you because they're idiots.  They downvoted you because you're a braggart ass in the way that you talk.  Learn to be civil and you'll do alright.
Liquidation price?
I'd like to agree with you, but then we'd both be wrong.
trying to time the market is always stupid.... hodlers make way more
Well that's all well and good...until it keeps on dipping.

Would selling during the dip from $19,000 to $18,000 have been "stupid"....Nope.
tbf I closed a short at like $9850 and that's possibly just as retarded
All selling as the price drops is not "panic selling".  Much of it is risk management.   And you never know where the price is going to bounce or find support.  So saying it is dumb to sell at 8680 is an absurd thing to say, just like it was said at 9100 before the price dropped another $400 in a few hours.
I have to agree with you.
I did, about ten hours ago, went short against 10% of my stack and started dumping some alts.
Past performance indicative future now not same results
What price would trigger this? Or is it just a matter of time?
Yeah honestly now it’s just a wait and see game

Watch this charts , looks pretty stable to me , yes you can see 10 percent drops but the long term line shows less volatility and a more straight line.
May as well throw my long in with that as well.. good enough for a whale..
The market says it is very bad.  A glance at the chart shows that.  If you think it's good news, then that's great, but no one cares.
Well, there's conflicting signals here. 

I'll definitely grant you that technicals are screaming for a bounce here. Particularly medium timeframe RSI. 

However, sellers also pushed through 3 critical horizontal support zones in rapid succession at $9,000, $8,800 and $8,600.

If we were to invert the market behavior, somebody suggesting not to open a long here would be roughly equivalent to somebody warning to avoid a short had the market jumped from $9,300 to $10,200 instead.

RSI would be outrageously overbought in that scenario (as it is outrageously oversold now), but I know I'd be particularly skittish opening a short in that scenario. 
lol you keep making me laugh with that shiz. And no, I haven't. It just looked like accumulation to me at $6.5-7k and now it looks like distribution $9k+.

I looked up the wyckoff phases to see if it matched and it is pretty close
Ya I mean it's not perfect by any means. It could also be re-accumulation. I just found the failure to break $10k pretty bearish and don't see it coming back around and trying again. 

But this sell-off has been filling some pretty thick bids- the volatility isn't high so volume isn't up, but I mean we've chewed through like 6k worth of bids down here 
https://www.reddit.com/r/mtgoxinsolvency/comments/8ida8d/mor_coins_are_on_the_move_may_10th_2018/
They would have likely sold long ago and wouldn't be dumping like this anyway if they did want to get out.  
Maybe this time theyre right

love me some bitcorn
That makes sense. Thanks for the insight. 

I had been sitting in a few positions from 6k and used that one to test publishing one to the bot.

I’ll keep that accuracy and trust you mentioned in mind in the future. I didn’t intend any malice. 

Thanks again. 
Lol I’m watching Big Bang theory right now, made me laugh haha

These bear flags might provide enough range to scalp a kebab with some risk.
I made a meatball sub, all is good
No, not because of that. Bitcoin never seems to have much movement on good news. It's just that the monthly trends have been alternating up and down inside a triangle since January. And I think we'll break up out of the triangle sometime in June. Or we'll crash to 1.3k :P
2% on Mex might be more than enough to cause a cascading of liquidations, coupled with people spamming the market buy button.

I always wonder if Mex ever leads the market, or if it's even really possible given the nature of the exchange.
13MM position isnt that much on bitmex, wtf lol
I thought he was 100MM+

He explicitly said he didn't close it, see his 2nd last post.
Yes and many people did both.  Not saying I did well with those shorts, but it was right over the plate.  Smarter traders than I cleaned up on both of those.
I know. I was asleep. Saw futs at 10250 and thought I should start building a short, but decided against it because I wanted to have a good weekend. A very expensive weekend at that
Are you trying to say that people shouldn’t comment retrospectively on events that have already happened? The best way to learn is to retrospectively analyse what happened historically to avoid the same mistakes in the future. Are you saying you’re only allowed to predict the future here?

Alright then Nostradamus.
Well good for you, but I still hate these kinds of posts that amount to little more than shaking your own dick.

Had we pumped over 12k I don’t think it likely you’d have dedicated a post explaining how wrong you were.

There is no actual TA here or indeed in your other statements that we are still in a bear.
A lot of alts would be crashing at the news that Upbit was selling coins they didn't have. Alt -> Btc, crashing the Alt/Btc ratio. Then Btc -> Fiat, dropping Btc's value. I think that's pretty fair to assume right now, but you'd have to compare aggregate alt volume (minus aggregate alt/fiat volume) to btc fiat volume if you wanted to have some kind of evidence confirming that.

Not to say I think the market wouldn't have gotten down to these levels eventually, but I certainly didn't expect it to go down through 8.8k so *fast*.
Transaction volume is down below early 2017 levels.  When the price was under 2k.
obviously you haven't looked at Google tends for Bitcoin

https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=bitcoin
That's not a divergence yet, too early as the local low isn't confirmed/well defined yet. Go read up on baby pips.

Also use extreme caution with a bull div in a strong bear trend, especially one thats as slight as that one *would* be on the hourly. Sure, maybe the bears are losing a bit of momentum as they keep pushing down, but as it stands they still seem to have plenty left.
That's a subtle one. Didn't notice.
Which bounces? From where to where?

Corruption is rampant everywhere.  It is called "humanity".

Time to face reality...although ignorance is bliss, so won't blame you completely.
For it to fit the profile of a wedge, the resistance line has to be steeper than the support line.

For it to fit the profile of a channel, both lines need to be parallel. 

 
Try different browser?
If it were, then I’d be shorting every 6 hours lol
But what if Harry Potter is real and it's actually Dumbledore creating magical bitcoins and selling them?

I have just as much evidence for that as you do for this being one dude (or small group, even) selling every 6 hrs.

This is not one single player moving the market. This is just a lot of people with a lot of money that did a lot of buying in the 7/6ks deciding the r/r favors selling and taking their profits now.
3k is the fair value, and people tend to overshoot fair value in panic selling, so i figure 2k is the bargain-hunting stage to accumulate a position long term

I honestly don't think BTC will hit 3K. That seems a bit too low to me but honestly anything is possible. No one would have guessed ETH would drop from $1450 to $350. Nothing is impossible in crypto. 

I'm going to call a bottom around 4.5K - 5.5K
Can you comprehend what is happening in the world around you, that's probably a better question?

You said this drop was positive for bulls...I have summarised what has happened...
Shorting in a dip almost never works out

Most exchanges allow you to post limit buys/sells which are hidden from the order book.
A limit order that doesn't show on the order book.  A feature usually granted to institutional investors so they can make very large trades without spooking the market.
There were massive idiotic dumps all the way down to 200 after the last bubble, it doesn't mean anything.
yeah a lot of money going to shorts.

Short covering on a massive scale and value buying.  We're still up 25% over the past month.  This is not a bear market by any stretch of the imagination.
Ya, it's really not that shitty of a post. 

It's just missing a chart explaining that [the resistance and support lines converge in approximately 12 hours](https://imgur.com/a/X5JO7nj), but he thinks it will actually break out within two hours because x.
Big players love liquidity. There is literally 5,000 bitcoins on the way down to $8500. I have a feeling they will be filled. 

the 1h rsi can go lower or it can muck around and go back above 30 and then come back down

but this is just my feeling. I am fairly sure you will end up in profit if you are willing to wait 24-48 hours
do what?
right which is part of the equilibrium yeah?? 
It’s on the 30m so super small timeframe but lower highs on pump attempts with lower support around 8675.  Just something I’m keeping an eye on to see if we’ll go down more or bear flag up a bit again. 
Yeah I agree, the risk of shorting here is definitely too high. 
Passed years we've been in a bull market. It's just an excuse to pump, if anything.
But you realise that when everyone starts to expect a pump........there will be no pump
Horizontal support in the 8.65-8.6k area, but really not convincing. It will really depend on if, and then where, we bounce. 
What are you thinking?

If 8500 holds, that would be a very good sign no?
yeah but spreading adoption takes time

Your opinion adds nothing to the discussion because it is idiotic, unsubstantiated bullshit. Im for the ban.
Rule 1 and 3 may apply in this situation. I'm thinking about it. The quality and focus of your thoughts are relevant in this sub. I'm struggling with the idea that there's some minimum level of logic and reason required for each post, though. There isn't a rubric, but if I were to make one I'd spend a lot of time looking at your post history.

tl;dr; please improve the quality of thought that goes into your posts so I don't have to figure out how to enforce that. I don't want to see users complaining about irrational, illogical, or fallacious posts/comments.
There were more longs than shorts for the entire oct-dec bullrun.
You'll probably get a bounce to $8.7-8.9k after $8.5k before continuing down.
A long with an entry of 0$ is the best. Too bad he used 0% stack and no leverage.

Such entry deserved and All In 100X at least
Because ze is young, and when you're young and dumb, you do dumb things regardless of whether you're intelligent or not.

Ok, so you have no idea what SegWit is. I too can regurgitate what Ver told you, but the reality is that SegWit is pretty great from a technical perspective.

Here’s the [BIP](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki), its a pretty good read

If you know what you were talking about, I would totally respect your opinion. u/JustSomeBadAdvice and I had a pretty interesting debate on SegWit and he brought some very good points to argue against SegWit.

Do better, troll

also, “researchers” test first gigabit blockchain. I can literally do that on my own in seconds by forking core and setting blockweight to 4gb.

You’re just so ridiculously uninformed, its insane
>Great amounts of BTC are flowing into the ICO market. 

Not exactly. The market caps for these projects are greatly inflated and dominance is not quite as low as it appears. 

ICOs are scam. Worthless pet projects without any real tangible exceptions. There may be a few exceptions but the vast majority of the ICO and alt space is a giant pump-n-dump trading scheme. The valuations for some of these projects are absolutely absurd and there's no chance in hell that any alt has the liquidity to withstand large dumps. Not even Bitcoin has that type of liquidity and alts are orders of magnitude worse. 

>If you want a copy of the final paper leave your e-mail in the final question of the survey! Thank you!!

Sounds like you're getting ready to promote your own ICO... *fantastic*

ok so you're advising me to sell my house? LOL  
hopefully my buy at 16800 will feel that way LOL
Do you even understand historical performance? For the long term holder Bitcoin has always gone up and will always continue to make new ATH's! It will never be surpassed by another coin because it has a history of being the king. It will continue climbing in value until the heat death of the universe. Historically bitcoin has never died. So the universe will die but bitcoin will live on.
yeah but it can also easily lead to overtrading
Thanks for the reply but I can't learn how to cope with regrets , like I knew I should have took profits but didn't and all those thoughts are really killing me from inside , maybe I am not suited for trading 
I worry too much 
I lost money by not locking in profits
and being greedy , should have took profits but wanted more so ended up fucked 
Well shit. I guess I'm going to retire now. lol

Good luck to us both. 
Not related to your post but bitcoin movement in general. 

If I long $1k worth of btc at price of $10k and long $1k worth of btc at $2k then the avg price is $6k. If btc reaches $4k then I’m in profit overall even though it is below the average purchase price of $6k. 

I don’t understand what’s happening in the above scenario. How is this possible. 
Here's a not well tested line that gives support at 8220, maybe he means that.  https://imgur.com/j4TEu6y

You can tilt it up if you want by connecting to the more left candles.
The way it's described (from 6480, launching point for the first BGD), I think it would look something like this:

Yes, like I said it recovered well. But I remember clearly a dip in mid May. I'd just bought a decent chunk and the price dropped right afterwards :\-D

There was a drop in late June too.

Haha, you're a sick fuck. I like it. Guess it runs in the family.
Shit mate. haha. 
I'm really curious to see how this weekend plays out... 
Can't wait to see the improvements. my current dump target to the steep trend in 8.2k. Audacious, I know, but BTC never ceases to impress. Let's see if we take the express train or we have to go by bus. 
We will see. Not complaining that my 8400 buy order was filled.
Yeah yeah I know mate. :) I  saw it all unfolding, but when greed takes over, it isn't a good sign. Turned out to be just the case. lol. 

I literally woke up in the middle of my sleep to see the price at break even, went back to sleep. 

Will be targeting to clear up the mess with this short now. 
I tend to set SMART goals yet sometimes I fail to achieve them due to the psychological and emotional influences.

You definitely should. From what I can see, this thing will keep going down. Already seen multiple thousand BTC walls getting chewed up. As said before, monitor it and when you feel the time is right, close the position. You are doing well. :)
Ah ok.

Business as usual then ;)
Did you close your long?


did you short?
aiight, my bad ;)
danke!
Ah shit. Bin Sonntag da. Sonst kommste mal Zürich homie. Ich bin voll oft in Mingga wegen Eisbach surfen

Anything can happen. 

If it were to drop below $8,000 without a bounce though, I'd be very surprised if it didn't bounce off $7,800. 

$8,000 is pretty meaningless in the grand scheme of things, but $7,800 has served as strong support in recent history. 
Interesting move, I might follow it, though I'm very scared to open a long lol. But think I'll move stops to about 8.6. I followed Chew on opening the short (albeit at a lower price point) but I'm feeling a bit too greedy to close it here. Historically my greed has blown up in my face every time so can't say I'll be surprised if the same happens here and I just miss out on profits. 

I'm short from around 8.9/9 and sitting at about 180% ROE with 50% of my trading stack right now (I didn't use the bot so I don't expect anyone to believe it) but it's not as absurd as it sounds - not a huge amount of money and I also lost 90% of my stack in my first two weeks of trading, so been trying desperately to make it back (desperation which has led to further losses in some instances). While closing it here would be a very nice profit, I figure the positioning in case we go lower is too good to give up so easily. My trades have been getting better as I've started mimicking a few people here, and also taking time to cool off between trades and letting the market choose directions. 

My short is on June fut so maybe I'll hold out for a little dip and long swaps.

Edit: Seems like I might've missed the dip.
I'll probably give up at $8,150 or so. 

For the r/r to be worth it, I should really exit a little sooner though. 
it's not gonna be 12k in 6 days.

(you're making idiotic predictions)
if there's no exchange between facebux and other cryptos, why bother having a crypto

just sell facebook cards at the gas station

> FaceBux would probably implement their own credit card based gateway. Their whole goal would be to keep full control.

True, but that may work in their favour.

Being able easily to send money to your friends through Facebook is something a lot of people would use.

Package it all up in an idiot-proof UI, get some retailers/restaurants on board - could make Facebook a *lot* of money.
most markets trade eth in eth/btc pairs tho, you want eth you gotta deposit btc first.  People buy btc as a currency then spend it as they choose on alts.

Anyone pretty much, even in person. WeChat user #1 opens their QR code, WeChat user #2 scans it. Simple as that. The joys of living in a totalitarian state I guess!
Well, if $8,650 holds as support-turned-resistance, then the ultimate target for this decline should be the log resistance line:

https://imgur.com/a/fzTAMnp

It's currently at around $7,400 and will be near $7,000 around May 20th. 

That might be a good long opportunity, provided the market doesn't plow right back through it. 

Even if it holds as support though, there's still a possibility of [a repeat of the 2014 bubble pop](https://imgur.com/a/zFUxj) when buyers pushed price above the log resistance line, but continued to hug it from the upside for several months before finally bottoming out at $160.
im worried they're adding more to avoid liquidation now, and will capitulate later.

What about stop losses, i can see a lot of longs opened above 8500 to close if 8000 or 7800 falls no? It could cascade in the same fashion, just not triggered by liquidations.

Spot or futures? Either way that's a good stop location. Good trade and enjoy the profits. I'm really pulling for a break down on this formation so I can move my stops into profit comfortably. That would probably surrender more of the futures premium as well. 
IMO, the issue is, while fundamentals are important, there is so much volatility in crypto that TA tends to override it.
Crypto fundamentals are as different from stock fundamentals as heaven and earth, but they do exist. I have made millions on them and beat best performers several times over while completely disregarding TA.
I think he’s talking only about the last month, April.
I’m very humble in front of that reality indeed. As I said, I’ve learned a lot here.

I really wasn't even on much but I was just watching my btc tank on bitmex and was like "heh, whatever." it wore off and I panic closed and then the market turned around.  Lol

And yeah I prefer not to use it either 
Well, I'm far from broke, but OK.

Two things are certain: anybody market selling large blocks of coins:: 1) will run out of coins at some point 2) is acting in an irrational way, not looking to get the highest price for their coins.
OK thanks. Not looking bad so far. 
Funding during the last dip was *exceedingly* expensive. Like 10% of the value of the position expensive.

It's come back enough to just break even on funding in the past couple of days but that's *with* what I added in April.
He doesn't seem to trade technicals, so he probably saw 2nd $6k as a confirmation we were going to goblin town. 
I asked him actually and he said these past few weeks made him finally break even. He said the funding rates did have him significantly in the red during the $6-7k shenanigans. 
So, you think someone selling ~$7,000,000 worth of BTC is sufficient to drive the total crypto market cap down ~$50,000,000,000? That makes perfect sense!
I appreciate what you're saying here.. and I've seen BTC move up seemingly indefinitely and drop the same way.  I'm not over-leveraged however and will bail on this position if we don't see any convincing upwards price movement in the coming hours.  I don't hold losing positions very long and always use sensible stops.
why do you lose the account? cant you just redeposit?

This is already the market going full retard at this point. 
not $10k :( I wish. I closed that one and reopened it lower like a goober. I am short 2x on swaps from $9650 and short 1.667x on june futures from $9400. 

I know right...I wanted to add at $9.4k but was too scared. Lame. 

oh and I have a small eth short I made with dush in discord from 0.083 lol. just for fun
I'm not sure actually. /u/l14dy any ideas?
Great advice!
Thanks a lot!
The best advice ever.
Because people with more experience are playing against those inclinations. 
All true. Just agreeing with upper comment is all. Plenty examples of said from yesterday however. As i said... hope a better day for all ;)
if he sold say 1000 contracts at 9100 and takes say 200 contracts profit right now at 8400 and price goes to 8500 then he can profit from the chop be opening the 200 contract short that he closed at 8400
I find it interesting - I've had times where from trading I've done really rather well, and other times where I've done spectacularly badly.

The main thing I've noticed is that, primarily, I do well when I don't overtrade and when I just let a position ride. 

Admittedly I panicked earlier and closed a short when the price wicked up a bit but I've already made that back from the drop just now. 
The only risk would be if the price coons so fast that the exchange can't liquidate the short fast enough and you end up losing some BTC. I lent for a couple months and even when shorts got liquidated I still got my BTC back plus interest. 
Short squeeze??? Lol, maybe a long squeeze 
We only hit 6k once, then a higher low of 6.6. I know because I bought them both.

Lol.... Send me all your BTC, I'll worry for you ;-)

False. The BTC sub does nothing but talk shit about Bitcoin and the Lightning Network. No problem with second layer? If that was the case then why is nobody talking about it over there unless its to bash the LN.

Also, when will the market decide which one wins? Seems to me that the time in which BCH should have gained traction was right after the split if a majority of people wanted it. Instead you find the complete opposite happened and it has not managed to gain at all. It also does not do anything that other alts already do.

So what happens when the mining reward halves and its far less profitable to mine Bcash? What happens if large blocks start coming through and full nodes cant be run by anybody other than big companies with high bandwidth? High Bandwidth requirement and Low Fees GUARANTEES centralization. Show me otherwise.

No I'm not coming around the to the project. I think it's a bad project with bad leadership but the coin itself is not a scam, it's just a piece of code. The scam is in the promotion/marketing.
it is possible this is the worst bot on reddit

Thanks... good advice. I was only seeking opinion,  thanks for yours :)
How botje11 from tradingview is looking at it: heavy resistance

https://www.tradingview.com/x/h5FaR6HS
He shorted at 8800, we went to 9400, blew off at 9750 then dropped and he closed at break even.

Don’t get cheeky with me

I’m just saying people in here vindicate others to defend the positions they are married to
Yes of course there are plenty of things to consider in every trade. We have plenty of HVNs around the support areas and are only moving up on low volume while we are dumping on high volume. That will make it harder to get up. Also every support zone could have turned resistance. 

I don't follow news much. I trade market conditions. News just produce those.
Yeah agreed, but I do think we may see a technical bounce here first. RSI is already in the trash can, 8.5k is MUH DIVISIBLE BY 500 number, 5 red 1hs in a row, 5 4hs in a row and a resistance line steeper than an erect penis. The perfect mix for a a weak bounce that will find resistance @8.8k or 8.7k depending on buyers.

7.8k is a key level but 7.6k is extremly important too. Since the BGD we never revisited a level below it.
Thank you for responding. It seems like the term "catch-22" applies . . can't reach 10K for lack of volume and can't get volume because we can't reach 10K. 
Interesting, thanks for the context. So maybe somewhat expected, still could be bad if it's confirmed.
If you don’t already understand the difference between a coin fork like BTC/BCH and actual alt coins like LTC and ETH then you should step back until you have a better grasp of the technicalities.

Certainly refrain from the insults, you’ve embarrassed yourself.
https://mobile.twitter.com/hashtag/upbit
They're technically not any different, yet selling here is selling into severe weakness, and as /u/TheEchonomist stated most indicators are overheated. 

Personally, though I don't think the rewards for a scalp on a small bounce outweighs the risk of a further drop. 
Sorry mate can't answer your question now, I am busy planning my position at the moment. 
No stops, manually monitoring the market. Yet to add the last 50%.
I think its just that the gap must be filled, not necessarily a reversal. 

In this case the gap that required filling happened in the middle of a upswing, so It makes sense the price would want to continue up after reaching down to fill the gap.
Trying my luck I think the chart support on 4H chart is more like 8500 because the highs of may16th was 8420 on BitMex. But it’s still close enough 4H is oversold 1h is diverging

We had a lot of liquidations on OkeX futures and the valuations are more reasonable. We’ve had a fast short term move

I think the sellers will dry up in the coming hours and then we can have a decent bounce 

Why not ? I feel better buying here than at 9500 or above
Anyway my stoploss is tight don’t wanna baghold
each downvote probably cost this forum, in aggregate, around 100k each.

liq is 7k, not worried about that.  Will close if it gets down below 8.2 or if RSI (4h and shorter) resets without any headway on a bounce.

Mostly looking to snag a quick profit if it creeps up closer to 8.5 unless the bounce is violent, in which case I'll just set a trailing stop (which isn't looking likely)
incorrect

I have been HODLing for 7 years and started trading in 2017. I have more Bitcoin now than at the beginning of 2017
don’t be ridiculous. 19k to 18k is a no dip

19k to 10.5k was that dip, and it took 5 days
dont you have one open from 10074?  http://bitcoinmarkets.atwebpages.com/

wanted to ask you about that actually, are you once again in the indefinite short holding mode, or is it different this time and you close @ very oversold RSIs?
Exactly, if you'd have "panic sold" at the end of that drop at $9.6k you'd be in decent profit right now.
Everybody's liquidation price is different. 

For somebody on ~3x leverage with 100% of their account balance from $9,000, a drop below ~$6,000 would liquidate them. 

But there are numerous traders who never yolo long with 100% of their account balance. 

So they'll add to their positions as price declines. Or close them preemptively. 

Honestly, even if the market dropped to $5,000 in a single 1d candle, you probably wouldn't see any noticeable liquidations.
Depends on entry point, leverage and risk management.
Some people can hold on to being underwater for long time, others not so much.
And its a mix of liquidations and stop losses. Most people won't wait to be liquidated and will bail sooner.

7k8 is a very important level. It held as support several times before this last rise to 10K. If it falls with conviction get out of the way.
(in my opinion)
matter of time, i recall 10,000 of those longs came in from 8k-9k 2 weeks ago.

given that the max leverage on BFX is 3.3, I think it would probably need to get somewhere in the $6,000's
MM just use any news as an excuse to make big movements.
Let's not confuse correlation & causation.
I'm not predicting how far its going up. Just that there will be a substantial bounce here regardless of what happens afterwards. Show me a time on the 4h chart where rsi was this low without a significant bounce following it.
Why's that? Look at bfx bids, this is the perfect time to get the f out. $10k is a pretty natural top for the run-up
[deleted]
If you set your stop losses to trigger on "last" instead of "mark" then you're just asking to get abused by a scenario exactly like this. 

Ahh, thoroughly confused by this post then but ok

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ikz1u/daily_discussion_friday_may_11_2018/dyt2hl4/
Yea, I was very close to it but was slightly underwater and had just taken a loss from futures premium and some risk management stuff. I should've re-opened a big futures short there.

Would've been fun to spam the trollbox with a 5-digit entry position
Hahahaha yup me too man. I knew the r/r was worth it but I was underwater from $9700 so I figured I shouldn't add. :'(
 Not without analysis. He was hand waving and now he’s dick shaking. I don’t see the purpose of any of it.
Jesus you don't listen to do. I don't believe the bear market has ended, i've been saying for it a while now. If we'd have gone over 12k then many of the resistances and moving averages which I use to determine the market would have likely switched to bull market. 

Therefore I would be fine saying ...Bull Market. I have no problem saying bull market if the evidence points to it.. the evidence right now does not point to a bull market. At all

No need to get your massive vag in a twist is there
"There is no actual TA here or indeed in your other statements that we are still in a bear."

\- Because TA \(I mean random predictions\), is the be all and end all isn't it.
Before a lot of altcoins appeared. 
Now show me the correlation with price. 

There is not.

There is correlation with news, and price its the most common news. Use your head a little. 
If you look back subtle divs are common when we are ridiculously oversold into the 20s and below and they like to play out.
1. 8690 -> 8831

2. 8675 -> 8790

Yes, it is definitely myself who is the ignorant one.  

With you throwing around wild accusations insinuating a government will falsely prosecute and convict people and corrupt the judicial process to attack the feared beast which is crypto.  The beast so feared that the G20 openly said they didn't need regulation as it was so insignificant!

Time for a trip to the hospital for you, you probably also believe that the Earth is flat.
Lol should’ve done that the past 3 days 
The best response to these questions is to just call it the CO- composite operator in Wyckoff theory. 

It doesn't matter if it's one guy or a bunch of guys. It just matters that that's what the market is doing

The fact that a massive wallet is dumping is much more likely than whatever bullshit you just typed out 
No I said 
>**, if this turns into support**

Note the if. Referring to the long trendline from december
Ahh. not good for minnows. Thank you.
Thank you.
Different market.
Sure, some of them will make money.  Most won't.  
Shorts are covering: https://www.tradingview.com/x/1YXtLtc1/  

Longs are climbing: https://www.tradingview.com/x/AdtGKDVo/  

And we can't even break the absurdly steep downtrend line: https://www.tradingview.com/x/qsOCWkdx/  

RSI is cooled off on the 15m-1h. 2h+ is still oversold, but the pieces for continuation are certainly there. 
I think he's looking at this: https://www.tradingview.com/x/bnD0PVcX/  

That's basically 2 hours until forced resolution. Pretty short-term lines, but I'm still watching it. 
you are right. lesson learn i guess  
!long XBTUSD close 8750
yep
Oh I see, indeed it looks like a small falling wedge.
I said last night I didn't expect this to stop dumping before a meaningful bounce until at least $8500. and that I'd expect a bounce to around $8.8-8.9k after that.

plus it falls in line with that wyckoff distribution phase thing. According to that we'll have a low volume rally to where the drop and new low started, around $8.8-8.9k and then the mark down will occur.

So I think we will bounce to $8.7-8.9 which is where I'll add to my short. If we get past, say, $9050 I will likely close my shorts. at $9400 I will go long. 

This really is not a bad place for a long. but it is definitely trending now and it might be better to be on the new trend (shorting the bounce) than trying to catch the bottom. 

Catching this bottom though would set someone up very, very nicely if we do end up getting past low $9ks again
IF $8500 holds and we close this or next hourly candle above $8600, that'd make a retest of $9000 over the weekend very likely imo. Then moon the fuck up alongside Consensus? I don't know, maybe that would be a bit too obvious -- but then waiting for a drop to ~$8000 is too obvious here too from a bearish point of view. 
Yeah that's the whole point of a SF. Nodes don't need to upgrade if they don't want to.
Can you get me his new username? Would like to know if I bump into him.
Please don't do this. Fucking, please don't do this anymore.
This is untrue and bull bullying of bears.

If you read my comment history, I have placed similar comments, but in a bullish tone, and all of those comments were highly upvoted and nobody complained.

Bear-discrimination is pretty obvious and I have documented it very well. Mods can go through my comment history and compare my bearish vs bullish comments; bearish are always met with hate and racism (especially by people like and the close-minded whiny baby "Lady"), while bullish comments are upvoted and NEVER criticised - however unsubstantiated they are.

Furthermore, you are no one to decide whether my opinion adds to the discussion or not. I believe your opinions add nothing to the discussion and are idiotic, unsubstantiated bullshit - however, I don't think you should be banned for that. Looks like bulls are not just bullies, but also close-minded and pro-limiting of free thought!
Valid, but at that time the market kept increasing, yet many longs that opened now are close to Break even or already underwater. A much less favourable positions for a long to be in, instead of a market that keeps increasing perpetually. 
Oh also by bottom out I meant flatline, hasn’t happened since Sept. 13th, hasn’t happened yet either but go down any further and it will. A bounce would be fun, keep people guessing haha.
at an entry price of $0 i'd invest all my savings (also nonexistent)

I have no intention to promote any ICO. I'm just doing my master's degree thesis. I'm just willing to share the results.

I had to pick a topic related to crowdfunding so I chose the one that interests me the most and I believe it's more relevant at the moment. ICOs besides what you highlighted, present a great opportunity for a new form of external funding. But exactly because of what you commented it makes a very interesting topic. 

I'm posting this in order to get a representative sample and run an econometric model to understand what people value the most when making investment decisions regarding ICOs. 


The company that did the research that you just shared is called Statis Group and claims to be a premier ICO advisory firm (token design, marketing, book building and issuance). It does not say that ICOs should vanish, or else the company has no reason of existence. 

Also, the article suggests that the term scam is on the loose from the researchers. However, I can see that it expressing a very important opinion that only makes my research topic more relevant and interesting.
you have to let it go and move on. Trust me, I took a massive, massive loss from a day of emotional overtrading before my big short from $11k and I was completely broken over it. I cried a few times at work even- it was really devastating. But you have to learn how to lose before you can win. 

there's nothing wrong with *having* emotions, it's whether or not you act on them that determines whether or not you're profitable

Do yourself a **huge** favor and read chewtoy's comment on emotional trading and how to come back from it.

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/80t3g1/daily_discussion_wednesday_february_28_2018/duyzufz/

We tend to all have that "crying in bathtub" moment
I have that problem too and it can be very demoralizing.  But it's not really a logical way to think, because if you made bad decisions, it's because it's the best you could have done at the time.  It's the only thing you could have done, because that's what happened.  Making the same mistakes repeatedly is what is maddening and I do that as well, but trading can be very confusing.

You can do one thing five times in a row and it goes against you and you figure you screwed up and then the sixth time, you do the opposite and it still goes against you.  But it's better than working a regular wageslave job, so I will soldier on.
You lost profits. That's different thing. Understand that you'll get another shot.

If I'd took all profits in right moments I'd be a millionaire already... I've shorted at 19.5, closed with a loss at 19.6. I'm still here.
This is the type of discussion that keeps bringing me back to this sub. Thanks both for the quality analysis. 
Lol no. The average purchase price is $3,333⅓ 

Buying a grand worth of BTC @ 10k means that you bought 1,000/10,000 = 0.1 BTC. 

Buying a grand worth of BTC @ 2k means you bought:  

1,000/2,000 = 0.5 BTC  

In other words, you own 0.6 BTC at an average price of:  

    (0.1×10,000 + 0.5×2,000)/(0.1+0.5)  
      = 2000/0.6
         = $3,333.33.

That is why you’d be $400 in profit if the price of Bitcoin was $4k.   
You have to think about it as how much did you buy each bitcoin you own for. 

You own 0.6 btc and spent $2000 on it. So your average price is (1/0.6)*$2000= 1.667*2000= $3333.33/btc. 
Thanks. Feels forced to me. I think 8200 as a historical high volume node + resistance/support makes a lot of sense, though. Don't particularly need a trend line to tell us that.
I knew if I could add only a little and increase my liquidation to just over $10,000, this thing will sooner or later come back down. Yet I hesitated and never added. Blame my past experiences and fear to loose more gains?!
I'm still in 25% in my short from 9k. 
If it went up i had tight stops. 

My day is already made. Now i'm just enjoying the fireworks.
You didn't buy back in right? You sold at like $9k? That's a great trade so far man. Nice job. 
all in good fun, amigo
Took 25% profit @8530 with stops @8769. I'll keep an eye on it but will try and let it ride some more. This should bounce or at least go sideways to cool of a bit. 
I have now 50% free so i might hedge the short if i see a strong bounce to lock in profits.

Thanks for your tips, they helped a lot.
Sehr cool, meld dich dann wenn du wieder da bist!
was tempted to all in the CME before the close but im lucky i didnt, it dumped right after.  And I hate being stuck long over the weekened when it could drop even more.  Horrible feeling.

Agreed. I closed my short at 8500 from 8950, just working out what to do next. I'm going to sit in fiat and then short the bounce I think. Good luck with your long! (Hope that doesn't trigger the bot lol)
This is exactly what I did. I didn't want to give up my entry prematurely. My long is basically where we are. 
Oh look, a new Oracle.
I imagine that that's pretty much what this will amount to.

We'll be able to buy emojis and other features on FB.  Maybe give tips.  Maybe eventually order pizzas or make purchases with other companies willing to do a joint marketing campaign with them.

I expect complete shit.
> True, but that may work in their favour.

No buts about it.  That's the whole point.
V interesting, thanks 
so you seem pretty bearish in general.  There's still a lot of froth.  There's no denying a collapse of public interest from alexa rankings, google trends, blockchain transaction volume.  Theres a lot of 'insitutional buying' rumors and hype.. but I fear many funds and insitutions were buying last year hoping to get in on 'crypto' with corporate herd-think.  Now they desperately need someone to sell it to.

The fact that bithumb had to fudge the numbers on his exchange is telling me he was looking to exit the space, dumping one last final bag onto an investor.  CEO's tend to do this when they're trying to hide some worrying trend from their perspective buyers.


I think the same scenario is playing out like in 2014, hugging the log line on the way down. It's why we couldn't break 10k. Just a gut feeling
I guess one difference is that we have the rising support from the Nov low through 6k that's been tested a few times.  That would intersect with the log resistance line in a couple of weeks, and could cut off any further downturn at around $6800.
Spot. But will probably close it if we break out of the descending channel (9k4 - 9k) when it gets there (around 8660).
The position is now so small its not worth risking an extra 1% just to see if it goes down. 

Should decide pretty soon, i'm betting in less than an hour 
AKA you lucked in to buy in some cheap coins that blew up?
You're right. :)
Not saying you won't close in profit or that it'll happen the same way again. I just think there's only so many times btc will range before making a decisive move and steamrolling scalpers/day traders
That's a typo
3) opening a huge short on bitmex, market dumping on finex, gg wp 
Yeesh. Why didn't you switch to futures? 

Do you like swaps for the liquidity? Or what 

The funding the past few weeks has been wonderful 
[deleted]
Sure . Just mean I lost a lot learning to trade (not on crypto) and it nearly always was because I got it in my head that the market has to do something (because hey, it did the last 10 out of 10 times, or it's very overdue , or whatever) and gambling the lot on it doing so; and then it didn't. 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/pmtHMSdj/

if you look at the sell off after $11.7k the selling can continue to be very aggressive for a while. 

RSI is definitely indicating a bounce but there are always new records to be made...
I took a small break yesterday just before it dropped, decided at 9 that it's a bit too late to enter. Well... Now need to wait it out. Hope it won't get to 6k again.
No clue outside of checking the blockchain
amen
I didn't say he wasn't a troll, just not a shill. I actually said he's metatrolling. He's trolling the trolls? Still a troll. 
Lol yeah is that so?

You prefer full blocks then Mr. Programmer?
Well if we fill up these big blocks then mining fees will dwarf the mining reward. The sheer scale of the transactions and its fees will be huge - and if that is achieved well we'd be well on our way to a world currency.

OK I'll give you benefit of the doubt for less people being able to run nodes. But define centralization for me. If only data centers can run nodes, But these thousands of centers are all over the world in different countries and different jurisdictions, can a centralizing force really affect the network?
Ok Roger. Get a life. 
I agree, this does seem possible.
Possible. I think we've held at 8500-8600 too long to get that technical bounce here, as RSI is already beginning to cool. Could still happen though. Happy in my short from 9050 (Jun futures) with b/e stops. 
That's a pretty succinct distilling of the current environment, yes. 
Thanks!
Agree, looking for a quick scalp then yes, any bounce may be A bounce and you don't care the difference. Also i agree i would not sell before 8.8 is tested again, just not sure there has been a "lot" of panic selling yet. If you look at the weekly, so far we just had a (small) correction of the overall movement.
Thanks! :)
Despite my scepticism, I think you have a great entry here. Hope you catch a nice bounce :)!
Thanks for sharing your thoughts.

> highs of may16th was 8420 on BitMex

Think you meant apr 16th.

But funny thing is, it could potentially ring true for may 16th too!

I think you will be fine. Would look for 8550 and close at 8180
then your lucky cause its a fact
Genuine question, what did trigger the switch in mentality for you? How do you emotionally manage sudden/strong moves (like the short squeeze) when you are out of position (e.g. not hodling)? :)


Congratulations on your trading success!

Would you like to share the main principles that have guided your trading? Do you do much TA or do you think it's basically the same as astrology? Do you trade from btc to Fiat or also to altcoins? Etc. I think it'd be interesting for us to read. :-)
no I meant to close that one but I messed up the syntax and was too lazy to figure out how to close it lol. That's the short I was talking about. 

I left it up cause I still left my larger swaps position open. 

I am basically in indefinite short holding mode again, unless we pass, say, ~$9050. $9450 would have me going long.

My strategy for this market will be to hold open shorts as long as I can. That being said my larger position is on swaps now and I will need to look for an opening to add on futures, especially while the premium is still there. September is still at a $300 premium...so I may add on that. 

> more disciplined traders 

What % of the leveraged money in bitcoin do you think fits this description?
> But more disciplined traders never yolo long with 100% of their account balance.

Sorry that is not correct.
No confusion here.  This savage dump is likely highly correlated to the bad Upbit news.
Sure:

https://imgur.com/a/B4wRwpZ

4h RSI was at about 27 at $7,000 and the market dumped an additional 14% to $6,000 before there was a strong bounce.

EDIT: I'm not saying there won't be a bounce. It's not like BTC is going to drop to $1 straight from $8,570. 

I'm saying that the bounce could just as easily be from $7,500 to $8,200 than it could be from $8,500 to $9,200.
last time 4h rsi was this low we jumped $400 before dumping again. Same with the time before that. Note the second to last time was $9500...we went from $9900 to $7300 to $9100 to $6500 after that...
Because if you think $10K is a likely top (which I said at $9900), you don't sit there and watch 12% of your money disappear before you press the sell button.  Or maybe I'm just giving too much credit to other traders. 

And if you do want to sell at $9000, you don't dump it all in a market order unless you want less money than scaling out of it.
when he says "good enough for me" he means good enough to share more details about the position he currently holds. he also said he would close on "the next major drop" but when I asked what that meant he didn't answer. if I were him, I too would be very careful about what I shared
Yes sometimes bad trading can mess with your head and then difficult to take full advantage of opportunities.  I've been there many times.
hope you still hve the 9700 short open
[deleted]
He’s explained what he was using to measure market flipping and you’ve ignored it. Reality is that unless and until we:

1. Break $12k.
2. Set a higher high.
3. Dip back and set a higher low above $12k before pushing back up.

This is just another dead cat bounce.
What evidence? Where did you provide any?
What else is there? What did he provide at any point to support his assertions?
Oh they were there.  Just no one paid attention to them.

Ethereum's tx volume was much less than bitcoin's at that time.  Ethereum transaction volume isn't doipping as far in relative terms compared to the history
if you see no correlation between lack of interest in Bitcoin and price movements, ok
Fair that.
What I said is above and not "wild accusations".  It is unlikely the accusations of Upbit are false, but it is certainly possible.
Thinking it's one person or small groups is a complete copout made by people who don't want to put any kind of actual rational thought into analyzing the market. I just like calling it out as it's a pet peeve of mine that's completely counterproductive to the goal of this sub (sharing actual thoughtful analysis).

 Calling the market manipulation by a small group of people means literally any kind of analysis you do has no meaning and you're better off flipping a coin every day on whether to buy or sell. The reality is there's plenty of valid analysis you can do to garner some semblance of the likelihood of various possible outcomes of the market given current/previous behavior and how markets generally tend to act.

Wyckoff is nowhere near the same thing and is actual analysis used to indicate what action the collective market is taking.

Yup I'm not sure if you saw my comments but I said a few days ago I thought this was distribution and the bump to $9390 was the test. This is beginning to look like mark down instead of just the "break the ice"

https://www.tradingview.com/x/1Wt3O9cS/

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dcl8YZPW0AA25N-.jpg:large

What's the general move *after* mark down? 
Sure, wyckoff is good analysis. It's TA.

Saying "this is one person selling so TA doesn't work" is different than saying "using wyckoff analysis this looks like smart money is distributing their gains from buying in he 6/7ks." One uses analysis, the other condemns its use. One allows room for other techniques to be used in conjunction with it (supports, resistances, momentum indicators, etc etc), the other rejects the notion that any of that is valid.
What massive wallet? The gox one? How do you know it's dumping/selling? Moving a tiny fraction of daily BTC volume does not equal selling.

You have no sources other than conspiracy. Do you believe the Earth is flat as well?
Same idiots...
It's not a "trend" line if it's not even a couple days old, IMO.  

The big short has not started covering yet.  When he does, we will get a very BGD.  

We're up 50% since the February low and have seen bigger dips than this even in the past month.  This is nothing.
I didn't mean to scare you out of your long. You are better off longing here than shorting as long as you're willing to wait. I just think we will touch $8.5-8.6k before bouncing a bit.

I feel bad for scaring you out of a long, especially if it bounces here.

Was it you who posted the wyckoff logic that were following to the T? Thanks for that. Didn't act on it but sure did get a real time education on it watching the charts these past few days
so they wont.. thats human nature

gypsy got his other alt banned lol so he's just not commenting here lately. 

I think we're going to try to appeal to the mods, I miss him here and so do quite a few people it seems. 
ok, promise
Dude, you're really fucking stupid. Just stop.
i dont really hold no, more like i have 1 bitmex stack and 1 super conservative trading stack. i transfer the profits from bitmex to a different exchange or my trezor and sell it if we're bearish on the daily/weekly
> I'm posting this in order to get a representative sample and run an econometric model to understand what people value the most when making investment decisions regarding ICOs.

How will that be a representative sample?

Like I said, people invest in alts to sell them for a higher price, there's not much more to it than that. ICOs are like sidequests in a game, they mean nothing except they can give you points to put towards real crypto if you play correctly. 

People will hype up whatever shit ICO they're holding but is anyone real passionate about the underlying? Probably not. Same thing goes for the founders. They're using a buzzword from a booming industry to drive the price up to make money.
So I guess what doesn't kill you makes you stronger just as they say
Thanks , very helpful.

I always try to think of NFL quarterbacks who throw an interception in the first quarter of a big game.  You just have to put it behind you and carry on.  Doing that increases your chances of success.
I guess it takes time to ignore those thoughts and move on , now I just keep spinning this situation over and over again in my head , thinking how I should'be done it etc.. 
thanks for the reply , I needed it.
Totally forced, and kind of arbitrary, could put it how you want.

25% is a big number. Congratulations! :) Yeah I too think you can let it ride further, despite heated RSI the traders doesn't really seem to care much, all they seem to care about is to get out of the market as early as possible.

You are most welcome and it makes me really happy to know that the tips helped. Cheers!
*cough*
way to go zuckerburg.. thanks for selling us out to the russians and making fake crypto.

he's making dave and busters bucks

I think you're mistaking my short-term sentiment for my extended outlook.

I'm a swing trader, and at all times my primary focus is on the next few days to weeks. 

I could be hyper bullish one day and hyper bearish the next if you went solely by my entries and targets at any given time. 

For example, a few weeks ago when the log resistance line broke I was calling for $11,700+ in the not-too-distant future. 

Prior to that I was calling for sub $6,000 coins. 

Now I'm more or less calling for $7,400ish coins and not offering much either way beyond that. 

EDIT: I'm quite adept at making short-to-medium term calls and relatively lousy at making extended predictions.

I'll often throw my hat into the ring regarding longer-term outlooks if somebody asks my opinion (and sometimes even when nobody's asking). But It's not my strong suit.


I wouldn't necessarily count out its value yet. I know this is a purely psychological thing, but having 25% up at 9040 could make adding a bounce off 8400 easier. Adding the 75% back at 8440 gives you an entry average of 8592. Much less nerve-wracking than having a CA under 8500. That might just be me, though, because it doesn't do you any favors in actual profitability. 
Of course there are fundamentals. If there were no fundamentals then coinmarketcap would be arranged completely randomly. As it stands, the rankings are roughly in line with Metcalfe's Law as well as community/developer size and actual technology.
I absolutely don't mind you looking at it that way, but I got "lucky" dozens of times in a row. My trading adventure started with nearly nothing.
Totally fair.
By in the red I meant on rpnl/funding rate part. Obviously he wasn't in the red on his trade
ive heard other people use that nomenclature though

A new record green monthly dildo after this weekly higher low is set. That is the sort of thing you are talking about right?
It'll continue to be confusing, possibly. I don't know actually. This move down is insanely strong

Uff great entry! I had a short @9945 that I closed @9760. Not being able to hold a position is a curse and a blessing lmao. 

We are not building a bear flag on shorter time frames yet. That has me kinda hopeful. I bought in 40% and will gladly add to it @8200.
Do you have any targets for that short? I went to sleep and hit a  target I set for 40% of my position at 8700. Now only have 60% in with a CA of 9076 (swaps). It's really hard to fight off the temptation of taking that 70% profit right now though. 

My pleasure.
Well its hard to say anything yet. But yeah, this is the very reason I am sticking to my position because I feel the same. Plus adding more stack to it to bring the average below  (in case of a further heavy break down) and also because I strongly feel we will see $9,000 again, perhaps.

Agreed, basically will just eat a loss if 8.2 support breaks but I think I should have good odds of closing in profit within the next couple of hours.  Gonna go for the quick win and actually close when if this one hits my target, I keep leaving trades open way too long (still holding a 3x LTC futures long that has gone from <10% to 50%+ profit and back multiple times in the last few weeks...)
I was holding during the short squeeze because I’m not retarded enough to short sub 7k.

I just try to buy bottoms and sell tops and use stops to make sure I dont have to deal with a big move
buy bottoms, sell tops and use motherfucking stops
No idea. 

For every 100 reckless trader going 3.3x with their entire $5,000 account balance, there's potentially 1 disciplined whale going 3.3x with 30% of their $15mm account balance. 

And 1 reckless whale going 3.3x with 100% of their 15mm account balance. 

So ya, no idea what the breakdown would be.
Changed to:

"But there are numerous traders who never yolo long with 100% of their account balance."

Better?
In your example the 4 hour rsi low happens at 7960 and bounces up to 9189 in less than 8 hours. Is that not a significant bounce? 
Well how do you know he/they didn't sell a lot up there? He/they could've set limit orders to sell a bunch at $9.5k+ but saved some more in case it blew past $10k. When it didn't and they didn't think their limit orders would get filled anymore, they started market selling. Makes sense to me
Ok yea gotcha. Just figured when he said he'd close on the next big drop and then said "good enough for me" that implied a close, that coupled with disclosing his position - which I also think he said he'd do once he closed. But w/e nbd
Yes :) I've had it open for like 16 days now. Funding has made me 5%...haha

I did have a futures short from $10075 that I am very annoyed I closed. but to be fair it went to $10300 before coming back down so 
Going back and reading his posts I see tons of assertions we are still in a bear market but very little actual analysis. He could be correct here but based on great insight, natural pessimism, or plain luck? Fuck knows because there’s no real analysis going on.

I swear most of what I witness here is John Edward types emphasising their correct calls and burying their incorrect ones.
I see no correlation in the interest on bitcoin and the people searching for it. I dont need to search for bitcoin. I dont need to search for bitcoin. 
I think it is pretty clear it is a single entity or group of entities acting in tight coordination to dump down the market.  Not that there is anything "wrong" with it - it is what it is.  But TA kinda goes out the window.

Yes, the Earth is flat. You didn't know? 
Are you calling me an idiot?  Wrong number.
nah i think i have to strict to my plan. I better get out of position and start new one rather than hang on to that.
Yes, no problem, I'm surprised it's following it so nicely. If I had listened to my own comment when I thought this was accumulation at $6.5-7k I'd be about 3x richer right now, too. So I need to start listening to this wyckoff guy :P
And that's fine. Duh. Don't you see that's the benefit of a SF, it's fully backwards compatible. No contention is created by those who don't upgrade versus those that do. That's literally the whole point and you're somehow spinning it like it's bad?
Yeah... Like wtf... Banning everyone isn't a solution...

It will be a representative sample of ICO investors hopefully. 

My aim is to contribute with some knowledge on how people make investments in ICOs. So in case my study proves you right you will have  a strong argument to use when you are making comments like this.
It is done, take the next step and don't look back. You've learned a lesson, use it in future.
I mean that's just like exiting at $8800, which is still a nice exit given we're at $8400. Don't beat yourself up over it. 

If I were you I would wait a few days to see what the market does before buying back in, personally. If you see a strong bounce past $9k you can feel comfortable getting back in and you only lose about $200/btc of movement.

If you see a bounce, subsequent rejection and then reversal again then you know not to buy in until lower.

But it's up to you. I say take some time away from charts and clear your head. You pulled off a win, so be happy! 
I meant reduced 25% on my position. Even so i already have 10% profit and should get another 7.5% if i get stopped. Above 15% profit is very good.

If i was above my initial value could probably risk a bit more, but for now, its increasing the stack the more important.

8600 seems to be holding so we might see another leg down.
Will be at work for some hours now so no charts. 
What wrong love, dick stuck in ya throat?
whats your lto


Not counting on entering all in again, at max add 50%. But i see your point. Lets see how it plays out and if it gets there with low or high volume.
(Since i have no BTC stack, i have more to lose than most of the users here that short to hedge their cold storages if this goes back up)
we're so far over the fundamental value that its almost irrelevant, though.  
1$ oil and you'd have most oil companies going bankrupt and 10,000$ oil and interstate trucking would collapse.

Bitcoin went from 1$ to 10,000$ and it really works the same.  
Lost an account ; blow an account. Just means you have a massive loss; not literally lose everything in an account necessarily. Just severely damage it. Nothing to do with literally losing as in not have access to  an account.
hahaha maybe. That would be cool. As bearish as I am I'd love to be in another bull run. 

A triple bottom off $6k would be stupid bullish, so I'm kind of secretly hoping for that
I don't know, it's just 15%, couple months ago this was normal retrace. We had problems to push through 9k range and we all knew it's either 10k soon or back to low 8 for some fuel.

If this gonna be pushed below 8 I'm gonna start worrying. I've actually just cashed out my whole USD stack and left only about 25% of it in BTC (my whole BTC trading stack) so I'll probably gonna go 1x short if 8k breaks and wait it out.
It's more like bcrash this week. amirite?
I understand Bitcoin and the scaling debate. Apparently I don't know where you stand as you're just saying I don't understand anything so whatever 
Nope.

People complain about reeee Bcash centralization but don't actually know what this 'centralization' entails.

I replied asking what he meant about centralization and he didn't reply sooo yeah I guess he didn't have an answer.

My goalposts remain a crypto currency that can scale to serve the entire world keeping tx fees under a cent.
I closed my longs from 6410 (small Sept) and 9300 (large Jun) at 9900 and 9800 respectively after passing through 10200 (futures). I was sitting there with my mouse over the close button on the Sept long at 10400 saying "I've *got* to short this" ...but obviously didn't. I've held so many good positions only to bail early ($11.3K short closed at $10.8K lol). I've also held through tons of profit just to close at b/e numerous times. It's brutal man.
I'd set break-even stops on the rest of it. If we hold 8650 as resistance, My close target it 7200. 
I just hope it’s not going to slow bleed over the next couple of weeks... that’s be terrible to sit through 
Ah yes well 50% is just getting greedy ;)
Yep that makes sense
[deleted]
Better! 
Like I said, it's not that a bounce isn't coming. It's that it could continue to fall significantly before bouncing. 

You could long here at $8,550, watch the market drop to $7,500 (get liquidated in the process trading on 10x leverage) and then see the market bounce from $7,500 to $9,000.
The problem is 4h rsi isn't an exact thing. So you could be getting in $300 above the bottom. And then the bounce barely gets you out of being underwater before we dump another 10%. 

You should probably be fine here, but there are no guarantees that you got a good entry with longer time frame RSI
I think that's an important point many people miss about RSI as an indicator. Heavily oversold doesn't necessarily mean it can't / won't go any lower, but it does in a vast majority of cases mean there WILL be a higher price 'soon', even if you don't catch the bottom perfectly. 
I think he is referencing the 7,000 indicated by the white square on the chart. Low RSI and it kept falling without a bounce. 
It doesn't make sense to me to dump large amounts of BTC at market price.  If you sell it slowly, you likely get higher sell prices.  Of course I don't have thousands of BTC, so can't say for sure, but tanking the market is not a great sell strategy most of the time.
People who are familiarizing themselves with the space definitely Google bitcoin. At least for the  price. 
How is it "pretty clear"? Seems pretty damn muddy to me.

Occam's razor, man. The simplest solution is generally the correct one. And that simple solution is that we've been long overdue for a retrace and people that were waiting for it to start were/are quick to jump on that train and take profits after a ~60% rise (even larger for alts).

Bear flags and ascending wedges have been breaking down. That's valid bearish TA. Horizontal supports/high volume nodes have been breaking down. That's bearish TA. OBV is trending down. That's bearish TA. MACD crosses, etc have occurred. Wyckoff distribution another valid bearish analysis. TA is still working.
Yep. 

And the danger with that kind of thought process - not using the correct tools or analysis to accurately and precisely explain your view - results in dangerous trading. Rather than looking at the market objectively and *recognizing* signs of accumulation/distribution, you start internalizing and accepting a bias one way or another. In turn, that makes you (general you, no you specifically) more likely to not only make a bad entry/decision, but then also hold that bad entry for far too long.

For instance, say we actually bounced off 8.8k and continued moving up. If you had a gut feeling this was distribution but had nothing to back up that idea other than "*can't you see?!!!??!*", your bias could have you keep thinking it's distribution long past when the wyckoff theory would have actually been invalidated.
Nah, all of us!
Wyckoff's fuckin awesome. 
> No contention is created by those who don't upgrade versus those that do.

Except all of the plebs and their pitchforks going after any service or wallet that doesn't use SW, as they demand.  So much for opt-in.  It's only opt-in if you opt-in, if you don't we'll try to ruin your business.

Top kek.
Saying bitcoin legacy in every post is super impressive. Dont you have anything better to do with your time? Its straight up pathetic.
Uh okay. Well yeah, we might see another leg down, or perhaps we will see some kind of a bounce here, there market looks like it want to go up but again there are a lot of traders dumping.

I think I will exit my position in the next few minutes depending on how market is behaving. Might open a long again.
Your dad thinks it's good luck. I *am* the Oracle.
This is phrased a bit nicer than your deleted post, lol. I was happy to respond to the previous one as well though.

You asked me how I could trade something 24-hours a day and not care about it, and I love that question so I'm going to answer it out of context here:

Because if bitcoin drops to $1, I'll be shorting it the whole way down and it won't matter to me.

If it pumps to $1 million I'll be longing it the whole way up and I also won't care. 

My trading style is divorced from the ultimate success or failure of BTC. I could quite literally be swing trading magic beans or plastic buttons with the same level of detachment. 

That said, I certainly hope that bitcoin has a bright and prosperous future ahead of it. If I didn't, I wouldn't have any cold storage. I'd simply have my trading stack and put the money I have invested in bitcoin into something less volatile.  

But I feel that speculating on $ amounts for "how much will 1 btc be worth by 2030" isn't super helpful. Because I have absolutely no idea. 

I could tell you $100K+, because that's what I hope it will be. But I have very little basis for that aside from the upcoming halving and *potential* mainstream adoption.

I generally agree with /u/fuckharvey that btc is more likely to be overvalued at current price levels than be undervalued at current price levels. I hope we're wrong there, but speculative interest can only push the price so high. 

Hey man, I have no cold storage presently either. With you there.

I mean hey as long as you are profitable great. I had a fucking huge run in 2017. Up over 1000x. Sounds crazy but got involved in early 2017 so it's great.

2018 has brought me 3x gains so far. Like fuck me what. Given the fact that I am much more careful with my capital and liquidity is a real problem for me now I think that's still great.  Also I don't trade alts anymore. Most turned out to be vaporware.

Don't look at what could've been. Look at what you got and realize that you have been profitable in the long run.
I hope the same. Well as of now, looks like there is still some good buying pressure around $8,700. In case it start to show signs of slow bleed, I think I will exit my position in time.
I'm not talking about short/long ratio. 

I'm talking about the ratio of overleveraged traders vs. traders with available margin to protect their positions. 

Which, unless I'm mistaken, is not possible to determine.
If we fall significantly here before bouncing the rsi will be even more ready for a bounce and ill average down, this is a pretty safe trade as long as I don't get greedy and lock in my profits with a stop.

edit: rode a long from 8800 to 9900 on the way up, I'd be happy for a trade even half as good from here.
Expecting more than a 300$ bounce over the next 24 hours, if it goes down 300$ from here id average down.
> but tanking the market is not a great sell strategy most of the time.

Well personally if I employed the above strategy, tanking the market is exactly what I'd do after I cashed most of my stack out with limit orders. Because then I get to buy back cheaper. If he bought at $6k, profit is profit. 

And, like I said, he could've been banking on the price going higher. If the market didn't want to push through $9k he may have realized that and can't wait for his limit orders to be filled.

So 1000s of people are just coordinating to sell at precisely the same moment out of the blue every 6 hours?  I could understand a series of small sells that turn into a cascade at irregular intervals but these are straight up dumps.
[removed]
Closed another 25%. That puts me at 16% profit already.
It doesn't seem to want to go up fast. If this drops below 8575 i'll probably add to the short a bit.

Might consider opening a long on ETHUSD if i see it rising more than BTC.

My week is already won, now i must be careful not to start losing it again.

Couldn't say this better. Tried to explained this to couple people here but I failed.

It doesn't matter if BTC is trading at $1k or $1m until it's tradeable.
 Ninjaedit cause I submitted too early and on mobile.

Please prove my logical fallacy wrong.

I think the biggest misconception people have against BCHers / big blockers is that we're completely against 2nd layers. This is wrong.

We're against constricting the 1st layer  in order to push the 2nd as the main payment processing layer. BTC fucked it up by making fees shoot through the roof in December.

Also, infinite growth? Nah. There's 7 billion people in the world. Only need to scale to that many people ;)
sorry i deleted that, i missed your point.
It's possible to determine, if you run an exchange, haha.

That's a good plan, but yea this is why i dont trust 4h rsi being oversold. This is insane. I doubt this can really go that much lower tho
Do you ask yourself the same thing when the price goes up?
Yeah? Its easier than typing out three letters? BTC?

You are completely full of shit and are doing it specifically to get a reaction. Seriously its pathetic. Nobody is trying to sensor you, you just really need to find something else to do with your time. 
Do you mean "untradeable"?

Sure.  It was clear for months last year (primarily the summer) that BTC would pump nearly daily around 8-9 am weekdays.
I mean that price doesn't really matter, what matters is that you can trade it still until somebody doesn't ban it or make it untradable or unprofitable.


That's more clear? Sorry, I'm a bit tired and having trouble in switching to proper English :-(
Well I have an opinion on 2nd layers and they work better with blocksize bigger than 1mb.

Not sure the rest of your post means. I have seem to hit a nerve.

Bigger blocks and 2nd layers will scale to serve the entire world. For now, the LN seems to have a huge liquidity problem.

It seems the people who are most worried about old hardware running the bitcoin network are the BTC folk.
Right, it doesn't matter to me as long as it's still volatile enough to be profitable. 

And as you pointed out, still legal to trade.

Your initial wording just had me confused, because you said, "until it's tradeable." Which implies it isn't tradeable currently. 

Like saying, "I'll keep working at this job until it's bearable"

When you meant to say, "I'll keep working at this job until it's unbearable"

Are they gonna increase the blocksize? I'd like to see where they said that. They didn't even do so with Segwit2x so I don't have much hope for bigger blocks on BTC.

Do a few people really own all the BCH? That's unfortunate that people were tricked into selling their Bcash so early. I mean, it was a Bitcoin fork so the distribution was extremely similar to BTC.
