*Cries manipulation*

*Opens another margin trade*
Time to go sideways for 16 hours. 
Oh my, too bad it won't be in the US but still a pretty major step.

Edit: Oh no it's going to have a trollbox lol "The platform also offers an internal chat, that will allow users to interact and exchange views, as well as an aggregated newsfeed and information on the coins."
Sure lots of people are disappointed now. Bulls for this very short euphoria and bears for getting stopped out of their shorts.

Welcome to bitcoin motherfuckers.
Still contemplating price stability. I'm trying to think about price stability as it relates to trading ranges.

Is it a wrong assumption that price stability anticipates new trading ranges? Is RSI relevant to that too? I updated the stability chart to see if I can find any relationships. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/7otpOPem/

Thinking back to 2016, if at any time someone told us that Bitcoin would be worth more than 5k in 2018 they'd have been branded a perma-bull and mocked. That wasn't a serious price target. When I started posting the [moon math tables](https://www.moonmath.win) in early 2017 it was showing projection that were absurd at the time. 10k by the end of 2018? impossible.

There seems to be a shifting perception of whats possible, and what's an appropriate range for the price. Sentiment is low, so an appropriate price range projects on the low end. In better times we get irrationally exuberant. However, at some point the perceptions of range flip to new levels.

2017 was a big pivot year for us. We flipped our perception of value in a way that hadn't happened in nearly four years. What I'm seeing in this chart is that we're moving from an old perception of value to a new one and we're hanging out at the bottom of that range and flirting with our previous perception.

Edit: One last chart https://www.tradingview.com/x/QsCraIAe/
You know you always hear "bulls take the stairs, bears take the window/elevator" 

But it took us 34 days to go from $5.5k to $20k. 

Now it's been 165 days and we haven't even managed to go below $5.9k. 

I've always thought that was interesting. Same as in  2013. 1 month for 1000% then like what, 18 months to get back down to 150%? 

O_O

anyway I can't believe I've spent almost 6 months since ATH with all of you beautiful fucks trying to make sense of this ridiculous game

MACD and Stoch RSI bearish (edit: or ready to turn bearish) on 2h, 3h, 4h, 6h. Bullish in 1h. Declining volume after pump. 

I got stopped out of my 3x short from 7150 at 7250, and am in a 3x short from 7525 again with stop at 7600. There's a [wedge in play](https://www.tradingview.com/x/BBQXoJo6/) with short term resistance at 7550, and simultaneously a big buy wall of btc below 7500 (normally I wouldn't care about that but it has seen some small chunks eaten and is still holding after several hours). Either breaking and holding will be a good indicator of direction. As you can tell my guess is downwards.
The SEC announced it's first meeting for the Investor Advisory Commission outside Washington. In the list of topics for breakout sessions is Bitcoin and ICOs.

* https://www.sec.gov/investing-america
* https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-95

> The IAC was established under Section 911 of the Dodd-Frank Act to advise the SEC on regulatory priorities, the regulation of securities products, trading strategies, fee structures, the effectiveness of disclosure, and on initiatives to protect investor interests and to promote investor confidence and the integrity of the securities marketplace.
It's doing that plateau on the 15m thing again. Brace!
Mexican standoff.

1k coins $50 down and $100 up.
Using Fib Extension, another leg down would target ~7160ish, and the pattern has then been to draw the endless flag instead of a third (wave 5) leg...we'll see what happens

peace
Opened a short here at $7371.

Dying volume slow creep up doesn’t have me feeling too confident the price will sky rocket up.Have some more sell orders between $7400-$7500 and will probably bail over $7550. 

Just have no clue where to set my take profits right now. Thinking below $7200 

Too add, longs are decreasing pretty rapidly, while shorts are climbing up slowly.

[I had posted this](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8fp2ur/daily_discussion_sunday_april_29_2018/dy6bna9/) in 9ks. I think it turned out to be accurate. Especially the price action between 8700-10000 was a textbook-perfect Wyckoff distribution.

It's important to note that it wasn't just BTC but also an alt distribution. Basically last month with low ratio on alts and record number of weak shorts, conditions became perfect for an exit pump and it was executed masterfully by whales.

I'm bearish for the medium term. I think we will see a series of redistributions all the way until we find the bottom. In fact we may be in one of them right now, and if so, around 8k seems to be a good candidate for the top of this redistribution zone. At that point Twitter gurus will be telling people that "triple bottom" held and market has reversed.

This triple bottom argument is important. Not in a TA sense, but because markets are anti-inductive (i.e. market usually reverses when "everybody" believes that the price will go one way), we need some degree of bullishness in order for the bear market to continue. The "triple bottom" can provide the necessary bullishness until down to 5ks.

About the actual bottom of this bear market, that I don't know either (although my gut tells me between 3k-4k). However a good way to determine it is looking at the sentiment. When BTC actually bottoms there won't be any Mariuses, 33kJulys, Parabolic Travs or Pomps around because there won't be anybody left to fool. At that point even r/bitcoin will give up. Posts that defend the fundamentals of BTC will be downvoted to oblivion. r/BitcoinMarkets will turn into a ghost town. And from that misery and despair the final march to 100k will start.
Seeing a lot of rule 2 and rule 3 violations today. I removed several and gave a little feedback in each case. 

I also saw a few rule 1 violations. Let's not stir up drama in this sub. If you don't like someone, this isn't the place to express those feelings. We're here to read and talk about the market.

We have rules for a reason and we, as a community, respect them enough to be the best trading sub on reddit, if not the entire internet. The rules preserve an environment where everyone feels they're able to share in a broad discussion about the market as it relates to **Bitcoin**.

Please don't post something that will get you reported. Do that by following the rules.
well piss on my tits and call me Susan... it was on the cards anyway I guess. The inability all day to really punch through 7.5k with conviction ended in a classic Bart.

Another day another kick in the bull nuts
The daily is far more interesting than the price action, tonight
**Position Bot Update**

Hey guys, made some optimizations on the [Open positions](https://www.anotherbot.info) and the bot itself.

Changes:

* Switched to real time ordering of the columns, this makes it order faster and allows for the PnL column to be also ordered

* Added a BTC address for donations (would like to thank whoever it was that already made a donation, it's good to see that my work is appreciated)

* On each user's history page there is a link for their **PushBullet** channel. 

* Since there seems to be some issues with PushBullet on iPhone i'll be leaving both systems running. I recommend trying PushBullet first and only resorting to Pushed as last resort since it has limitations

* There is a new column on the site that has a green check signaling that the position price was validated by the server. It checks the last 15m candle and checks if the value is between the minimum and maximum values of that candle. I saw already some examples of values not being validated by a few dollars, so i guess there is some room for improvement there. Probably is because of the averaging between exchanges.

* The decimal points are adjusted to the pairs value, allowing for alts to be shown correctly.

To Do:

* Improve spot validation mechanism 

* Calculate ROE (needs some analysis to see if it's possible)

* Calculate funding PnL (needs some analysis to see if it's possible)

* Clean list of old positions opened by users that don't reply to PMs.

* When the spot validation is stable i'll reject commands with values not validated. In this cases users will have to add **force** (or something like that) to make the bot accept the command. This will prevent errors when setting values (entering 8500 instead of 7500, for example)

As usual, suggestions and bug reports are welcome

Anyone else feel like the market/makers/whales aren't going to let those ETH shorts collect that easy money?  Have been holding off opening a BTC short because I can't unsee this: https://www.tradingview.com/x/g63UVteR/

An obscene amount opened about 5-10% up from where ETH currently sits. Seems like too big of a prize

Tin foil hat theory: Anyone think the EOS boys opened knowing they can market sell ETH into oblivion with their ICO stash?

EDIT: Grammar
[removed]
Closed my long. Lots of alts are double topping and getting a bit weird. Feeling too uncertain about everything to keep a position open.
I've been saying it for awhile now but I think we're still looking good at bottoming out here. I don't mean to imply that we will shoot up anytime soon but ranging in the 7k's definitely seems likely. We just fell about 50% from our pump so if there was any long pole warning (which I don't think there was) it would be gone and we have lost 1k longs in the past 12 hours and gained an equal amount of shorts and yet the price is holding steady above our previous low.

Edit: In the hour I posted this we lost another 50 longs and gained another 40 shorts, so it is still looking good in that regard. As long as we don't have a whale deciding to dump 1000 coins or something we should be good to hold here.
Short from $7,360

edit: This is likely to bounce at least a bit here, and my entry is not ideal.

That said, the r/r for a short anywhere between $7,300 and $7,600 is pretty strong assuming the market is about to breakdown in a major way.

And if it doesn't, then I can take a small loss here and reevaluate.

EDIT: My stops are set above $7,600
I'm no chartist but its easy to see the triple bottom with each bottom a little higher and solid trend line forming.  Guess its just a matter of if it holds. 
Here's the way I see it currently. Longs with tight stops from 7380-7420. Target 7700. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/JOTa0NAz/
!short xbtusd 7525

Going for a hedge of my long. I have a feeling this will push hard in one direction soon.

Will bail after higher high.
We're banging on the top of 15m bbands. 15m, 30m, 1h, 1w bbands are tight. RSI cooled off enough to let it ride any direction. This sideways move shouldn't take long.
I can't believe nobody is talking about this finex order book right now... Setting up for a dump? Or propping up price?

Edit: dump it is I guess
Ah the classic half bart. Perhaps it's not manipulation at all and it's just a cascade of stops being triggered. Perhaps we have more traders than usual? 
I still think we will hit 7700-7900 first before going 6200.
Weekly RSI almost as low as when we reversed from 6.5k and considerably lower than when we bounced hard off of 6k before that. 

[https://imgur.com/a/45CJVwX](https://imgur.com/a/45CJVwX)

Things would have to break down near or into oversold territory and that hasn't happened since 2014/15. Not saying it's off the table, but r/r I feel like shorting here would be an awful idea. 

Seems much more likely that we'll continue to bounce around in our symmetrical triangle range. Not entering a position here personally, but will consider a tight stop long around 7550 if we don't break down again.
I’m bullish. We are just a tad over my favorite price point... But I feel like this needs more steam. I’ll be looking at any wicks as a sign to short/long based on how quickly they get bought up or sold down on the 5min and 15min candle

We won’t be at my favorite price point for long

The last ~24 hours have been the time where the price of Bitcon traded at fair market prices!
Hey,

Not in a position atm, had some longs fill over the weekend (7220-7120) and ended up closing them yesterday at 7490.

Really not sure how i feel about this trade. On one hand, locked in profit (never a bad thing) on what i considered to be an overextended move. On the other hand, i disregarded my plan and essentially fomoed onto the sell side. also, that couldve potentially been a very nice entry that i sold.

Now that i've completely fucked up my original plan, I'm gonna have to adapt a new one.

Ref: https://www.tradingview.com/x/9MJjV7Sc/

If we go up -> potentially short 7700-7800 and possibly switch long if we break it and hold (take some profit at the top of "the" triangle and hope it breaks through, add on back test or take more profits on rejection)

If we go sideways -> accumulate alts and longs on drops (essentially betting on accumulation) (SL around 6700 BTC price)

If we go down (rsi still in downtrend, could have a final reset before "reversal") -> hunt for longs in 7100-6800 range and accumulate alts. SL around 6700 BTC price)

Bear in mind, im still really young and new to this but please tell me what you guys think and where should I improve. Part of me wants to do this at least part time in the future.

Amongst a load of other shit, I've been trying to analyse my bitmex trades. Ive done pretty good on alts and i want to compare that to mex. Problem is when i downloaded the CSV trade history from mex, it only went down to mid May. Anyone know how i can get all of it?

On mobile, can someone tell me where the 200ma for the daily is?
On my charts, bitstamp chart broke through the resistance turned support once more.
https://www.tradingview.com/x/BCJoycIc/

Not quite there yet on finex, but that one is lower and about to.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/y20J8Epl/

Added to my short and now all in, CA 7422. Should've gone all in when I saw no volume or follow through from buyers. Really gotta finish trading in the zone this week lol. Stops around 7600, if it turns it turns, but this is good R/R right now. Still holding same target as the end of last week, 6950.

Good luck everyone.


What if it's a Bart inside the Bart 
 Here’s a few observations on the 3d timeframe on Bitfinex. 

TD Sequential puts us currently on a ninth candle. It closes tonight and the run up from our last bottom also counted up nine greens before reversing to where we are now. 

This is a refreshing pattern because TD Sequential indicators have worked reasonably well on lower time frames and it’s fun to think that it playing out on the 3d might signal a maturing asset. A push from a larger institutions with different investment strategies. Advancements in regulations, custodial holding and awareness has put big money in the market. Bitcoin’s consequential nature with big money is contributing in efforts to reduce volatility and is a positive sign. If it doesn’t make a new count, I am hoping and expecting to see us closing a green candle next. The descending resistance line is a bull magnet so that’s where my first target is $7,700. 

RSI has a hidden bullish divergence because there seems to be a higher low in the making with upside potential.

As many have pointed out, the volume has been really low and looking at the profile on higher time frames, it evidently and positively has been more buying than selling since our previous low. Selling could continue here but as I’ve mentioned earlier, there is a modest chance of a temporary low with a satisfying bounce for us traders. My second target is $8,000. If we break $8,300 on a smaller span than it took us to go down from and on good volume, I'll be looking for more upside. 

I’m long from $7,370

https://www.tradingview.com/x/dLfgPLs1/

Edit: someone’s pointed out that there’s a flaw in my TA. There’s been a miss in the count where I have not taken account into it. There could be another week of down but I’m still sticking to my analysis and might add on any sell offs. 
[removed]
Who is feeling this smell of bear shit around the corner ?
[Did you know?](https://dailypriceaction.com/free-forex-trading-lessons/sloping-flag-pattern) A bull flag must have a downward sloping flag. An upward sloping flag "represent[s] trend exhaustion more so than a continuation of the current uptrend."

https://www.tradingview.com/x/hxwT3I85/
Ahh, the ole shakeout before the make out.
This reminds me so much of how we broke up the 10k downtrend channel at around 8,300 level few weeks ago. Everyone was so happy and calling 20k by the end of summer. But instead we headed to the goblintown.
[removed]
You're going to have to excuse the messy charts here guys but there is a lot of subtle information out there to convey.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/tS4IvGv5/

So we hit a valid reversal target so that *could* of been the bottom for now. In the same way that 8200 could have been the bottom. The price now fights it way upwards back through previous resistance and will need to prove itself by either moving very impulsively upwards (not happening) or retesting for support before moving upwards.

What moves are we looking for next, many people don't believe and are looking for the short already, even if only to scalp the return move. It is very tempting but the signals are not quite there, yet..

[4 HR TD is on an 8/9 and will give a sell in the next three hours](https://www.tradingview.com/x/KOyIjvor/) but with the daily potentially turning bullish caution should be taken holding it too much in the red.

[The volume analyses](https://www.tradingview.com/x/F5a4QNhq/) is also not giving sell signals at the moment either. 

I will be waiting for and looking to short the TD9 signal or another volume analyses signal. Stops will have to be defined depending on how good an entry I am able to take at the time. 
rub one out to Kendra Lust and we’ll be back at 10k in no time
Curious if this 400 corn buywall at 7490 on finex is real. Makes me a little bearish. 

Nvm: pulled or eaten in one piece (pulled more likely)

Peter gets beat up on a lot, but I've been watching him take abuse while he narrates the market for a while.
I’ll be writing a speech today about Bitcoin to present tomorrow to 100 college kids at my local university. 

Speech will be about 20 minutes long. 

Any fun facts or necessary content anyone can suggest to throw in there? 

Throw whatever knowledge of bitcoin you have at me. The more the merrier 
I'm using the performance of alts as an indicator that we still have more room to go up. I don't think we bart down yet until we test 7.7\-7.8k. Managed to snag a long at 7450.
I don't trust this slow grind up in price, low vol and slow grind up is no bueno.
Don't have a cow guys, sometimes you just got to say cowabunga and tell these Bart formations to eat your shorts.
!short XBTM18 add 7355 30%

I'll take this bounce. 

edit: I must have screwed up the math somewhere, as my CA is currently $7457 on June futs.

I've been expecting this move since yesterday afternoon when I opened this position. We broke back down through our former resistance line from $10K, which is good enough for me to move from hedge to actual short.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/6Mu8yqCN/

Stops over 7600 currently. 
Closed my short from $7350 @ $7318 for a minuscule gain.

Anything under $7300 gets bought up, buyers arent giving up quite yet. Also, $7350 isn’t a great entry.

Still have my short orders from $7650-$7760 open. Not quite sure they will ever get filled, but just going to sit out for now and wait for a better entry. 

Been on a hot streak due to being patient and not rushing into a position, and I rushed into this position on a bounce that’s actually maintained pretty well. 

 If we get rejected around $7600 again, may be an entry for a nice short position. Otherwise, sitting on my hands right now is best option 
Anyone attempting a long off the back of Bart's new pony ~~tale~~ tail? Seriously thinking about entering on a retest.

Or are you all shorting the shit out of it?

EDIT: Spelling

EDIT: My chart from yesterday showing that historical price action suggests we could get a nice rally if we get through the next area of resistance. https://www.tradingview.com/x/y4eNxe12/

If i do enter i'll be targeting the resistances circled to take profit
For once in our BTC lives we are actually painting some type of **Bear Flag** Instead of just a “ **Bart Flag** “

**Bart Flag**

#Rare

If our Bear flags meets the green line, I’ll open a small short 
FYI, we've been in a slow and steady bull market since 5th February. Shorters are delusional.
Notice how many people still had/have hope.


You have not felt max pain yet.
Surprised by the massive bearish bias here since attempting and failing 10k.

Fundamentally pretty much nothing has changed since $10k, except more good news being released during May. I am using these moments to buy some more for long term storage and adding some low leverage (2-3x) longs. 
Hmm, the price movement over the past 24 hours has been a little underwhelming, though the fact that it hasn't proven to be a short-term bart is promising. 

The current formation of our flag can be construed in many ways, Though I'm looking at two primary options: 

1) ascending triangle with heavy resistance at 7525-7550. A break up would put the price at a target of about 7650.

2) Ascending bart (see chart), slowgrind up to about 7600-7700 after which we bart back down though still making a higher low. This fractal was our last accumulation pump/dump before the BGD, though in this case I'd see it as a retrace to a higher low (potential target 7250), potentially allowing us to continue in an uptrend. 

I'm not taking a position here because, like everybody else, I'm expecting heavy resistance in the 7600-7800 region as multiple fractals and resistance converge in that region. Additionally, BTC shorts are low, and longs are high - even ETH shorts aren't overheated anymore - making any cascading up-move less likely and weakening it. 

Taking the above into account, r/r here simply isn't that good. I wouldn't be surprised by a slow grind up until 7700 max (+200pnts) though we'll probably at least retest the 7350 (-150) range as support first. From there I might open a long as the window of opportunity is greater (350+) though it'll still be quite risky/aggressive. Waiting for lower 7k's is definitely more enticing to take a position, as I'm quite disappointed by the already lacking volume and buying pressure, though I'm still somewhat hoping we're accumulation here.

Good luck everyone!

Edits: Numbers because I can't math. thanks /u/veltrop & /u/haserfauld



Volume candle pretty much exactly the same height as the one that pushed the price up.
This is going to sound a bit retarded but shall stick to my plan. Got bull trapped by eth’s third test of 560 and opened a small Long. Placed layered buys all the way down till 548 which was my target for retrace. All of them got hit and I am holding it. 550 was where the first big green candle closed. I am expecting it to hold. Stops near 540. Bought some btc longs based on this plan too and they are looking utter shit right now
How many people here are paying for pro TradingView or Coinigy accounts? Worth it? Which one is better?
On the 1 hour chart here, MACD just had a bearish crossover, and RSI making lower lows. i'm thinking we may get a drop here to 7300, or worst case a bart back down to 7k. [https://www.tradingview.com/x/G3OWvh7P/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/G3OWvh7P/)
Probably going to bart up soon, just my best guess based on previous trends.
Correct me if I'm wrong buy shouldn't we be dropping to 6,8-7,1?
Can't see too much buying pressure. Volumes are drying up. Massive shorts have been closed in last hour, but price barely moved up. Possible divergences are showing up. My guess about overall sentiment is that most bulls gonna take profits in next hours or already took them before. Therefore, we may have typical bart pattern today. 
If only we can get up over the new downward resistance line formed by the ATH and the failed attempt to take 10k a few weeks ago, we may start testing 10k again.  It would be nice if we could reach surpass 10k, if only by a little bit, so we can establish an upward channel.
!short BTCUSD 7500 X3 50%

!short ETHUSD  568 X3 50% 

Opened a short as I just didnt feel comfortable holding the long or that i would buy without leverage. Also this was prime for a bart down as the last days we have had slow rise/decline then BGD/BRD. Macd was turning bearish and we were stuck in the 3H cloud and loosing momentum. Bollinger bands have opened indicating a clear breakdown on the 1h chart

ETHUSD also had an H&S finishing at 557 ish.

**Shame on me for posting ETHUSD but i felt it relevant as its H&S might have contributed to the decline / lost faith in upwards momentum. i.e draggin BTCUSD down**

Any longs pulling out soon?
okay so i basically doubled my trading stack the past week,, now this is usually the point where i fuck it all up and overtrade it away.  
how did you learn to stop yourself from doing that?
Added a small short on this bounce at $7349.9 

We bounced perfectly off our former wedge resistance line ( **red** ) 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/qGEIJYg1/

If that line falls, I expect $7200 to be tested. And frankly, I don’t think it will hold. 

I’ll add more to my short if we bounce a little harder here 
[removed]
To the brave soul forcing us over 7350 on low volume... I acknowledge your valiant effort!

May we never see 7350 again!
So where can i buy a Bart swap, like XIV/VIX ?
What do you guys think will happen if we break through the line of the daily triangle? Goblin town? 
This could be the last shake out before MOABGC since the market was stalled. Or may be I am hallucinating. lol.
[deleted]
Im long at about 7100$, but still lost about 15k usd trading and trying to catch knife. At 7420 I was sure its bottom, huge volume on 6h, good RSI, MACD turning positive etc. and still bears could just push the price 400$ easily. We arent going up that easilym thats why im closing at 7700-8000 and shorting 8200+
[removed]
[https://i.imgur.com/cpGQDHG.png](https://i.imgur.com/cpGQDHG.png)

would this qualify as a rising wedge? if so, what would you target if it broke down? 7k?
I am still leaning toward a rally up to at least 7800 but if we go down from here it would be mega bearish to me.
Having said that I would not be surprised by a day of sideways, painting a daily doji and then maybe a few days of upside before return to lower levels
Good luck to all

200 BTC support at $7400 on Finex eaten through in an instant.
Aye caramba!
Seems it's not barting down as easily this time. If the pattern go sideways for a few hours it may draw an inverse H&S on the weekly, therefore a possible upward. Does anyone see it as well ?
Sometime last year this sub changed. It used to be for people who wanted to share ideas about increasing your Bitcoin stack. Now all the stuff that might help you do that is downvoted to Goblin Town. I guess that's the only Goblin Town they're getting. Let them have it. I'll take the money. Feeling really good about my long from 7340 today. This could make me a lot of money, and thanks to Bitcoin, it's a bet no bigger than I would plunk into a slot machine in AC on a dull night. No stops. Will close somewhere above 10K.
We seem to be in a channel here, touched the top of it earlier, but have boken back down. It would make sense for us to go back down here and test $6900\(where alot of buys are placed\) and hope to have a breakout going into June. Targets would be 7800 ,9200, 10,000. If we did manage to hit 10k\(I personally don't think we will\) I think we will break down again and test lower lows. Alternatively we lose $6900, and if we also lose $6000 this would be a very bad year for the bulls, but good long term for crypto IMO. [https://www.tradingview.com/x/EM79eVWd/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/EM79eVWd/)
I have great respect for everyone trading this, so much chip chop... i wouldnt touch a buy or a sell button right now, BTC Hodling feels just fine right now with a bit fiat on the side.
Closed my long at 7530. Opening a small short position.
[removed]
Totally not a bear trap
Longs still outpacing shorts over 3:2.  This rally should die out soon.
Support at 7.4 so still not a time to panic if you're long.

Edit: the line we broke yesterday is now at 7.4, until it holds we are in a break out and can't speak about reversal. If 7.4 breaks it will mean that this was a fake out and we'll probably go back to test support of triangle which I don't think will hold on next try.

Okay bitcoin. I got my paycheck hitting my account in 2 hours, don’t you go any higher than 7500 till then. 
Bull season starting in june. Bears getting desperate and bleeding dry and soon to be led to slaughter
As of writing ($7,350), we are sitting right above *10MA ($7,329) and 200MA ($7,321) on 30 minutes chart*; above *10MA ($7,331) and 50MA ($7,351) on 60 minutes chart*; and; slightly under *50MA ($7,381) and 10MA ($7,434) on 180 minutes chart.*
Honestly I think BTC needs to go down to 3/4K to so many people leave this space. only then will BTC go on a big bull run smashing ATH. 6k is not going to make people leave. 6K \- 10k \- 4k \- 6k \- 3k \- moon

The longer we delay the real bottom sub 6K, the longer the pain for the bulls.
I think we are going a lot lower with the weekend around the corner and the already low trading volume:

https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/volume/7d?c=e&t=b
1/ Payday checks rolling in

2/ very weak bear effort to drop us to 7300ish

3/ consolidating nicely and setting a floor at 7300ish

4/ Nasdaq powered crypto exchange for high profile investors launching soon

5/ entering a new month synonymous with bullish runs

6/ bears seemingly desperate downvoting every bullish post

All signs point to an epic BULLRUN INCOMING! Hold on to your panties girls
its going to head back towards $5K, the sooner people realize that the sooner we'll be able to buy around $5k instead of $7K. then it will make another move back towards $7,500 after dropping down to $5K before it drops AGAIN back down to $5K again and if the second $5K fails eventually towards $3K where it will finally bottom out IMO
Damn bears are getting slaughtered. No matter how hard they try there is always a bull to gobble up their low sells. Looks like the bull season will start with June
Shorts fired!
We are going down!
(Probably)
6000, 6425, and 7040

Notice a pattern here, guys?

End of the month coinciding with the end of the week... hmmm... lots of paychecks being cut. Can we expect a little payday rally? Bears seem weary. Today's dump was one of the weakest yet. Could be very expensive to suppress the price if people are in a buying mood. Something to think about.

Feeling good about my long from 7340 today.

Looks to me like Mr. Bearwhale is getting chewed up by little retail piranhas.  For what it's worth, this is familiar over the years:  Should see a nice upswing within a few months at latest, starting this weekend at earliest.
I'm short, but still not really looking that bad for longs:

Anyone feel this drop is almost desperation from the sellers? Lowering their sell prices just to maintain the down trend? Looking very bullish otherwise
Look at the volume on that punch!
Are there any hodlers left?  Last year they were posting in here constantly and preaching about DCA and saying holding is a smarter strategy than trading for 98% of people out there.

They all seemed to have disappeared, which is very odd.

What!?! Are you trying to tell me that Internet discussions about Bitcoin trading are "troll boxes!?!" Say it ain't so! Say it ain't so, Joe!
Yep and just like btc mining difficulty, it’s getting harder to make money in crypto which is fine since making money should have never been this easy. 
I just had an interesting conversation with a good friend.

Let’s just assume hypothetically that Bitcoin doesn’t go back to sub 1k. I mean... 1k was always pretty high for those who bought in 2014-2016, it was kind of always the target... last ATH.

Now let’s assume we never go to 1k ever again. Then it’s safe to say that Bitcoin will continue to thrive with use cases ranging from store of value (yes, for people like me who bought sub 1k... still a store of value, I beat the S&P quite a few tokes over), commerce etc

But what about the next bull run.

Let’s just assume there will be a next bull run. And if we’re at 7k now and possibly bottom at 3k or 2k or 4k (what do I know)

Holy shit the next bull run will be insane.
Have you just resurrected the bubble cycle?
Am I interpreting the chart right if i say; you think we are unlikely to move into a heavily oversold weekly RSI period next? You think we're sitting at similar place to summer 2015 atm?

Interesting idea with the value perception thing!
I am a firm believer in the fact that price consolidation prefaces price action, but the million dollar question is whether thats up or down.  There's lots of good arguments for both and I'm pretty neutral atm, and maybe slighlty bearish since so many people invested since last year are still ~~10 - 20~~ 3 - 5 X's up on their investment.  Just doesn't seem violent enough, but who knows.
The initial correction took ~50 days. We've really only gone sideways/up since then. We certainly haven't gone lower.
Hope you can cope with six months of us in a bull market (when the time comes)

I wish I had the time and patience to keep going ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
That's because whilst bubbles are primarily the result of technicals getting overextended, they typically tend to pop because some kind of majorly negative news acts as a catalyst, sending it plummeting.

There has been no such news for the crypto market - it has popped based on technical overextension alone. This could be taken to mean that it's merely in a secular bull market and we're currently seeing a walked-down correction not a crash. The fundamentals are bullish so there is no logical reason for significant panic selling.
Dont play with what you cant afford to lose. This trend seems legit bullish
Interesting.  It looks like it is a Town Hall type meeting where people can ask the SEC commissioners questions?   I don't get the point of this, because they would lie about anything important and anyone asking about crypto would likely be put on some list (facial recognition tech).    

Yes I am exaggerating a little, but not that much.
So consolidating for a breakout? But which way? Eth seems to be testing a few MAs as support atm

Edit: looks like BTC is testing the ma7 with the ma25 close under it
And the gringo will win as always.
>Too add, longs are decreasing pretty rapidly, while shorts are climbing up slowly.

How is that a bearish indicator?
I'm looking at the 2hr BFX BTCUSD chart and thinking "it's got to retest the 100u EMA at some point". I'm calling retest of $7700 followed by test of $7000 with a timeline of 6-7 days. Bold claim? Yes, but it's just a fun educated guess. Not sure the needed hype to raise price significantly is here right now.  
  
Think 7k'll get retested for sure though. And if it holds, might then be a good time to scoop up some btc.
I got a short open now too and agree with 7200 taking profits. I'm not sure we're going to see the big crash here that people are anticipating. Still think we see a big move back upwards in June at the end of which we may see some big profit taking and back down to consider goblin town
I think people are bullish because they see the crypto industry as bullish, unlike 2014-2015 when people thought crypto was dying. Even if btc drops to 3k people will remain bullish as long as their assessment of crypto future is the same.
if  BTC drops to 2k or 3k I don't expect to see 100k ever frankly 
maybe in 10 years 
Good to see you
Great write up. All these TA gurus online expect 7100 to be the bottom of a 6 month wedge. However, I think that's way too easy. I will need to see this bottom trendline tested atleast for a few more times before I will even consider a long.

For now, the obvious trend is still down. Too many bottom callers and knife catchers eager to snatch up 'cheap' bitcoins, when in reality, cheap was 1k a year ago. BTC needs more time to mature \- I agree this could go down to 2\-4k range too.
> When BTC actually bottoms there won't be any Mariuses, 33kJulys, Parabolic Travs or Pomps around because there won't be anybody left to fool. 

This is the part I am looking forward to most, the traders who are still around in 6 months will be the ones to follow
Good write up
Sorry, the price got me emotional. 
I think you could avoid some of the  criticisms of overmoderating (if you're still worried) if you simply changed some of the phrasing of your warnings: "stay off my radar" really sounds like a power trip :P 
Thanks sir. :)
Am I talking about ETH too much? (honest question)

Month of June is 6.

Price of bitcoin is the 6000’s?

666....Illuminati confirmed. 
that URL has the word "clit" in it.
What the fucking fuck, no way, wow.  That's odd.
6th is pocket money day here in the UK.  Most teenagers are given about £6 for the month by their parents, to spend on whatever they want.  I reckon they immediately long or short bitcoin depending on what Data Dash has said in his latest youtube video.
Yup june is the bull month
Good, we either form a strong base at 7k or we capitulate - sounds good to me.
Rule 2
I have a feeling they  *are* the eth shorts

keep in mind before btc went to $6k the first time, shorts went from abojt 8k to like 20k+ from $10k to $11k.

Some shorts know what they're doing 
I'd be inclined to go with the tin foil hat theory. I'd do exactly the same if I had to dump a load of ETH.

Welcome back to the fireworks 
Yep. We dropped from 8500 to 7100 in a little over a week with no significant bounce. I would be really surprise \(and rekt\), if we were to bart down from here.
Heh, I had that tight stop on my fomo long yesterday from 7380ish, which got stopped out at 7420ish.
/u/haserfauld this one is on you ;-)
Convinced of ascending triangle?  https://imgur.com/kJnFDkS

If so, it's tempting to go long.  But I think perhaps it doesn't fit volume profile, and its start is a bit wonky.

The last time I longed an ascending triangle after a small rise is the moment the previous uptrend officially ended and the cascading drops started.

Edit: the more the break up gets rejected the closer to its apex, the less confidence I have in it.  It's sort of in its last chance now.
I would argue that those are the same thing. 
It is half until it's whole...which may be incoming shortly.

It's just a meme
What speaks against going near oversold and then going sideways for a few weeks? Would help to tighten the weekly bbands and level out RSI as we descend. Also would mirror the 2014 pop a bit better.
You can't say it's considerably lower than when we bounced off 6k \- that RSI value is calculated based on the weekly close at 8k. When we were actually in the midst of the 6k crash it would've been much lower.
Does it make sense to consider mean reversion at such large time frames though
Sure about that? 
I posted this 2 weeks ago with the caption: "What happens next?"

https://www.tradingview.com/x/J6wZVoPe/

It was largely why I shorted so heavily from 8300. My biggest concern was ending up right here, actually. $7500 is an enigma. We blew past it on the BGD, and there's not much historical clarity here. It feels like the only two logical plays are to 1x short or simply hold until the market picks a direction, depending whether you value maintaining BTC or fiat levels. 
> if we go down, hunt for longs in 7100-6800

I feel just about everyone is doing this.  So I feel the only way to not miss this entry is some laddered knife catching.  But need a plan B if it falls through the floor.  I'd be afraid to dca it further because if we fall through 6800 I don't have faith enough to bet on any TA supports below that, which are all quite a bit further anyway.  So would have to be ready to eat a loss.  If we go up from there, I don't think it's going to rocket up so high from there, so I think you don't optimize the entry so much by catching those knives.  So I think it's really just a lost cause from an RR perspective to preplan this.

Best to hold off probably, and just be glad that your lower 7k orders paid off (but yeah, you let go of those too quickly if you were betting on a bottom and not looking for a scalp)

edit to comment the other 2 scenerios:

> If we go sideways

Yeah I already have some alts hedged back into btc to rebuy lower, their ratio is already bleeding during this formation.  Was a fickle one-shot alt pump as per the trend.  All it did was get the alt bag holders to take the rope off their neck.  Celebrate a 10% gain after 50% loss.

> If we go up

I'll just regret not having a long, and wait and see again, and resist to fomo.  Tho depending on how this sideways continues to play out, I could see trying to get back in before that happens.  But that's likely to lead to getting chopped up or locking in losses.

SMA 200: 10275
yeah, we are way under...
The classical Bart and Shoulders
You mean a potential inverse bart inside of a larger bart? Unlikely but possible. Technically we are still in the hairline of the bigger bart.
Ignoring all the speculative stuff about big money in your post, I'm going to focus on your TA.

I'm not very well versed in TD sequentials, but to my understanding, the buy setup you're talking about \(9 candles\) is not in and of itself a buy signal. You then wait for the countdown to be satisfied before actually buying \(13 candles closing below the 2 candle previous's low, where the 13 counts aren't necessarily in a row\).

Additionally, we aren't even on the ninth candle of the setup \- only the seventh closes today.

And I fail to see a hidden bullish divergence on RSI \- pretending this IS a higher low in the making, which is in no way confirmed as the current 3D is a red doji and we could just continue down over the next 3, RSI failed to make a lower low,

Edit: Also,

>As many have pointed out, the volume has been really low and looking at the profile on higher time frames, it evidently and positively has been more buying than selling since our previous low

Is just untrue. OBV, the best indicator for measuring volume on up periods vs down periods, is currently lower than it was at around 6.5k, indicating there's actually been more selling. That could be a hidden bullish divergence if we turn around here, but your statement that there's been more buying than selling isn't supported by the indicator.
Yes and the wallstreet bonuses coming anytime now!
Nice analysis!  When does the next 3 day candle open?

Noticed a similar divergence with Daily OBV.  Would take a close below 6600 to invalidate. https://www.tradingview.com/x/oLjWd3ZD/

I giggled

Chad said the bears were all killed out in the meadow...
The point is that we had a move up, bounced from resistance, then broke it and tested it as support. One will see flag in bad direction which is bearish, other will see break of resistance which is bullish.

That's the problem with choppy market. Mixed signals.
One of the key statistics of bull flag performance is the volatility with decreasing volume of the consolidation; by Tom bulwkawoski. The articles example of bull flags are wide in volatility. In addition, it is hard to argue that the flag is in a bull trend. A Pre condition for the pattern. Lots of typos, on mobile

EDIT: Was completely eaten, that was fun to watch
I find Peter's analysis helpful in that it's pure TA, as in you know he ain't shillin his position and he's an expert in reading tape for tape, no colored goggles. I don't expect him to speculate in whale motives and longer term speculation, he's just calling it like he sees it. 

Imo his approach works better in liquid markets. We all know BTC was illiquid at 20k and all the more so today, which means manipulation is that much cheaper. My concern is the chart painters are painting what experts like Peter recognize, they're painting for the Peters of this world. If this hypothesis is true, his analysis is best used as contrarian indicator.

Which is pretty fucked up if you think about it. 
He basically said that we won't go lower until we go lower :-\
I'm surprised he says the April low (6400) and not the YTD low trendline (6950ish). I would agree with the lack of low target until 6900 falls, but I don't think there's much case for a bullish scenario once that happens.

Focus on the how it removes the need for "trust" in transactions and you'll probably go over better than focusing on how it's a good hedge in event of WW3 or it's the anarchist solution to the free markets, etc.
Most people lose sight of the benefits of a trustless medium of exchange. I would mention the recent compromise of centralized data repositories like Equifax and anyone who has had customer payment details stored and subsequently leaked or hacked.

The difference is a push payment vs a pull payment. Think of how closed retailers would be to the idea of instead of you giving them your card info they gave you their bank account number and you made a deposit.

Both of those scenarios require trust. In a trustless scenario, you don't need to give them your account info nor do they need to give you theirs. They would provide a one-time payment code and you'd push the payment there. No risk of you getting your info stolen or an accidental debit of funds.

Sorry I can't right a detailed response right now, but it would be a good idea to bring up use cases that people new to crypto would appreciate and understand.
-Hedge against hyperinflation in 3rd world countries 
-Free from capital controls (could expand a bit on Italy's situation here)

Gold is great but could be useless in a digital age, so Bitcoin will be the new hedge to the centralized world's currency's that can shit the bed at any time, do you trust your government or a collective group of independent ledgers where you control your own money and can send it digitally to anyone in the world.   You can end with something controversial but gets them thinking, plenty of examples of governments in the past and current that screw people out of their own money, people always think it could never happen but it has repeatedly.

rent a lambo?
What's the context? Are they economists, science computer majors, information architects?

Personally I think it's interesting how Bitcoin short-term price fluctuation has become almost completely disconnected from its utility and adoption. I think people who say that fundamentals haven't changed don't understand fundamentals from a business perspective. It is evident that technical development can remain practically stagnant while fundamentals change greatly. 
The divergence really doesn’t look, and although I wanted to keep my long positions all the way up to 7700-7800, I just closed all of them. Would be nice though if btc dropped a hundred or two just to test 7800.

Edit: I’ve also noticed that when alts are going up it doesn’t always mean that btc will go up, too. Yet when btc is not going down and alts are, then it’s almost 99% that btc will drop, too.
Same thing for me. Most alts (BCH, OMG, Iota)  are still in upward channel. Longed btc at 7460 and eth at 563

Edit: The eth dumps on BFX are a swing Traders dream
It's not even grinding up over the last 24 hrs. It has stalled out.   So it either gets pumped higher by another BGD or it bleeds downwards on the low volume and a BRD finishes the job.

I'd actually say this was a pretty decent entry. Sure 7500 would have been way better but 7400 horizontal support has probably turned resistance. RSI still has room to go down. Putting stops around 7400-7500 would probably work out if this is the real deal. But I understand the decision.
I'm still short from 7490 with a sl moved to 7460 to account for fees and slippage, nothing else to do really. Bored to death. 
Would have proposed to just let it ride with break even stops at this point, since it seems we are also struggling to invalidate the current small bearflag. But profit is profit, nevertheless, and inverse bart is still possible.
Was holding on for as long as I could with the same entry but decided to close for a tiny gain as well. I’ll reevaluate once this sideways movement plays out and picks which way it wants to go. Felt confident we’d touch around 7200 by now but oh well. At least I can go back to getting things done at work now lol 
I think we hit resistance at 7380, unless we bart back up again.

Edit: That chart makes me think retest we 7.1k again a few times before moving to the upside.
Short a small position as a hedge 
long from 7300 but tight, tight stops 
Pony TAIL, you troglodyte. 

Long or fail.  That's what it looks like to me based on my proprietary time-considering algo.
What's the green line, bro?
Honestly barts are usually just flags that break against whatever they're biased to, sometimes after failed breakouts the other direction.
Bart flag ? I like these new flavours in the markets
the second one is more of a bear flag actually. 

the flag shouldn't be too sloped, it should just have a slight upwards angle and volume should taper off. the Bart flags are more like completely sideways/flat with no volume 
I guess we did not reach that green line and continue sideways? Or is it still too early to say?
> If our Bear flags meets the green line, I’ll open a small short

And you will get small-time rekt.
People who down vote Chad are missing the point. 
Bears charts go from ATH to now. Bulls zoom out. 
Yes, ironic, isn't it?
Nice, what new highs have we made? 
Sure we have, I mean volumes down, interest down, transactions down

Sure looks like a bull market to me
Hmm, funny looking bull market.  
Or....this barting/chop has been noise and will continue to be noise until lower lows or 10k breached.
Definitely. We know for sure bitcoin will never go up again to a new ATH unless everybody kills themselves. /s
Deelooozheenal
What is particularly funny are the celebrations which occur after a few &#37; pump.

The usual cries of "recovery", "we could test $10k"...

It's like the last few weeks didn't happen.
> Surprised by the massive bullish bias here since attempting and failing 6k.
> 
> 
> 
> Fundamentally pretty much nothing has changed since $6k

Perspective. 
Why are you surprised? Almost everybody in this sub is short and extremely bias towards a drop where they will make a return. They are happier than an undertaker during a plague. 
The technicals changed a lot. Majority people that bought since 6k bottom are under water now. A lot of coins changed hands at 8.2k and 9.2k. There's also none of the short fuel we had at 6.5k bottom.

I don't think it's a bad buy here because it is close to support and sellers are becoming exhausted (rally seems likely), but the overall market structure is bearish.
The bearish sentiment makes sense because the market tried and failed 10k and is down substantially since.  It's been a bear market since the ATH pop.  When it breaks 10k and shows a sustained upward trend over weeks, sentiment will change.  The only question is when that will happen, next month or next year (or never if you are a perma bear, but not many of those here except trolls). 
I think they feel smarter when they make money with a short position. Funny thing is almost nobody is making any money consistently.
>  by a slow grind up until 6700

7600?
Solid analysis. Im hedged short here, but I have adds up to 7700 to essentially make me 2x short. I'm not at all sure what we're going to do.
Stupid questions: what is bart and what is BGD?
I see up of 4.9k, and this down is two candles of 3k and 1.1k(still in progress), so I'm not sure what you are looking at.
Same here..
Worth it imo, I can get text alerts when we cross up or down a trend line on trading view. They're incredibly quick, too, I'll get alerts from TV faster than bitcoinity can update the price even. I believe they have direct access to some exchange prices or something cause it's hella fast sometimes 

and you can do price aggregates/averages, you can do alerts on indicators (RSI overbought etc) and all sorts of other stuff. 

it's pretty expensive, like $300 a year or something. I figure it's worth it if it ends up saving me or making me money in the end 

One trend line alert could save me much more than that in a single trade
Love tradingview.  Technically you can use it without paying, but I bought a pro subscription to support them.
I hate coinigy but I think tradingview is a must. If you're a serious trader 50 bucks a month shouldn't be a big deal.
Does this not mean its turning more into a bull flag?
sideways between 7.5 and 7.4 is more likely I think 
I was thinking 7360 is a good candidate since it's right above the resistance line that we broke and it's 0.382 retracement

https://www.tradingview.com/x/CQVPFLN9/
Closed my short thinking that could be possible. I just don't have a good feel for what's going on right now. Best for me to sit on the sidelines.
I like how you still managed to get the word "buy" in there.

And not yet: Fractals speak louder than bulls.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZhHUNSPk/

(I swear I can make this fractal fit any situation.)
Shouldn’t we be testing 7.8k? 
yep.
It can change fast ( either from the upside as downside )
Agree, But let's first pass this 7500 - 7600 area. Which is already difficult last 24 - 72 hours.

( when passed, I will ADD to my long Porto )
Too many "if"
Feeling like a retard now, have bought back in ETH at $573 yesterday.
Was in Fiat for nearly 3 weeks now..
What is your take on high number of ETHUSD shorts ?
nope, my entry is from $7080. If $7K is the bottom, I won't be able to get a better entry than that and I don't want to try timing this thing if it decides to really bounce after confirming $7K as the bottom.

I do have stop losses at $6880...for a max pain of 2.8% from the trade
Take profits out and start 'from scratch' instead of trading with the doubled amount.
take a breather and don’t trade for a week
Correct answer is to take your winnings and put it all in Black.
Stay disciplined and be humble about ur winnings. It takes practice, but not matter how big ur winning or losses, your state of mind stays neutral. Easier said then done. Start with a smaller stack and trade bigger when you understand your emotional self. 

I recommend the book, trading in the zone by mark douglas
Take a break and walk away from trading cryptos for a few days/longer, don't read about cryptos either.

You'll come back fresh with a better perspective.
remove your winnings from exchange, or convert into fiat. Turn off your computer. Enjoy the outdoors knowing you're X amount richer
"how to be the type of person who gambles, wins, then stop gambling"

You could try a support group.
Well done! 
Patience
If you doubled your stack, you were probably over-leveraged and risking too much capital per trade. Either that or you called every top and bottom perfectly.

Congrats, but it may be worth reducing the size of your trades and playing it safer from now on, to protect your profits 


Rule 3
A slow grind down the ATH downtrend log line as support (top dark blue) followed by a bounce off and crawl up the multi-year uptrend line (pink): https://www.tradingview.com/x/SZIx58nJ/

But who knows. 
Probably a slow ride down on weekly bbands
Though the concept of goblin town is subjective (where does it start, where does it end) I think it would be a slow grind to through the “suburbs” first. 

Overall it would be bearish if it’s a slow bleed, A more bullish scenario would I be a broad sell off to break through the downside.
The day we break 6k convincingly we'll be at 5k in 24 hours. The amount of people that are going to sell to reduce long term risk is huge. 
I think most believed it. Hopium is a hell of a drug, and while there's tribalism on both sides, the bullish side does seem the more militant believers. I think most "bears" here are actually just concerned about the current use case and environment surrounding BTC, but are still trying to acquire more in case of eventual adoption.

At the root, it seems like in many cases:  

Bulls want more BTC and will risk additional fiat to get it  
Bears want more BTC and will risk additional BTC to get it
I still do

I look at the # of buyers to gauge market sentiment. And right now there are 550 buyers waiting at $7200...which means on this leg down people are only willing to wait until $7200 before they fill up(and not $7000 like last time)

for the sell side, an concentration of sellers is at $7700 and $7800 where you have 300+ sellers. Which is where the resistance line is. 

So we are going to trade in this range and then we just keep track to see if its the buyers moving up their orders because they are losing patience or if its the sellers moving down their orders. 


I think it's very premature to start circlejerking that we're going to goblintown. We haven't even touched/tested the fib retrace or made any other attempt to set a trend (when you go up in a bart fashion any trendline you draw is an unrealistic slope until it attempts to make a low. *Normally* ascending barts provide a higher low that sees a second leg up. So far this seems like some stop hunting to shake out some traders with tights stops due to the uncertainty in the market.

I'm not flipping bear until 7250 breaks for an hour, which is very possible, or we see some massive volume on a dump. 
Reversal? Not fat chance with this volume. Except bulltards or maybe sudden rich investor buy 100k btc. 

But still happy if we go up.
[deleted]
If we pass 7800, and especially if we pass 8000, you have little incentive to close. 
Rule 3
A rising wedge is usually at the top of a run. We literally just bounced and then fell back to find support, so I would hardly call it a rising wedge. I'm thinking it will be hard to draw any kind of line in the near future as we'll just range here. Expect more chop.
I don't think the market is allowing much room to go down since the last 24 hours or so. Seems like the gates are locked at $7,400.
200 btc is nothing.
Whats your point? 200btc gone in instant then? What? 200 is nothing. 

Maybe your point is why it only needs 200 btc to easily push down btc price?
Yea I’m seeing it too 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/PgJO02uP/

Enough build up and it should blast to the moon 
Nearly everyone shorting wants more Bitcoin.
Can't tell if sarcastic.
shorting is the best way to make more btc though...

You and your ilk get downvoted because it's just moonboi talk. Your trading plan seems to revolve entirely around FOMO 

It's really not much different than people who were telling others to short $6.5k with no stops cause this ponzi scheme is going to $50 again
2 points of contact each and a fake out? That lines are irrelevant...
We will definitely hurdle over 10K again. It's just a question of when. I happen to think it will be fairly soon and will happen violently, like a couple of daily $1000 green candles in a row, followed by a week or two of steady retail FOMO to maybe $15K, followed by a pullback to 12 or so, then a run at ATH by the end of the year.
Respect, or sympathy?
Rule 3
~~Sarcasm?~~
A little panic is better than complacency if you are long.
Rule 2 - please use the alt thread for this.
Won't be a problem. 
Unbelievable shitpost. Bravo!
People have the tendency to think they are special, I agree with you but "people" might just mean you and I (and every lurker on this sub)
I don't think we'll ever see another bull run like 2017 ever again to be honest, save for someone like Amazon deciding to accept BTC as payment.
In this sub, it is only manipulation when it moves up. Ignore the fact that 90% of the huge 1 minute candles this past month have been market sells.
I mean the wall sat pretty at 7490 for a while, it was going to fall sooner or later, and everyone was watching it so I don't see how a continued sell off after breaking down is manipulation. Just my two cents, hehe!
Sounds like manipulation to pump the price up to $7.5k...keep price stable, wait for fresh buyers, and then market sell. No?
The entire chart is borne out of manipulation...at least over the last couple of years.
Gonna give a confident no on that one.
I think you dropped the cup
I see it more as an inverted h&s: https://imgur.com/a/5XwJaOY
The longer the bears wait to close their shorts in anticipation of sub 6k, the longer we will have to wait for a bounce

6k was the bottom until we make a lower low and break down out of the pennant.

Trade the chart, not your greed
remember the BGD? that happened on the 12th which was a Thursday and it then pumped the whole weekend.

so looking for the patterns with the days only works until it doesn't 
Shit post based on absolutely nothing but your short position hopes and dreams.
okay!
Hey u/Bedroid

You have NO CLUE what you are talking about.

your opinion is based on nothing and forces us to take it at face value.

don’t post here with your emotional bullshit.

I can do what you do:

Bitcorn is going to 6k, then it will bounce to 6500, then we will go sideways for a month before the bottom falls out.

None of this means anything. Stop posting horse shit

u/jarederaj? A ban is in order IMO
You are most likely generally correct, but anyone who posts overly detailed predictions of future price movements is usually clueless and /or dumb.
How do you figure bears are the ones getting slaughtered?  

The price is down 50% since the beginning of the year.  I think bulls have been the ones getting slaughtered.  
Edit: Sorry about that. I'll put myself on mute again.
Edit: Can't even edit.
You could have made this same comment several times in the past few weeks and replaced $7,040 with:

$8,100

$7,900

$7,250

$7,150 

You will likely be able to continue making this same comment even if there's a breakdown here at:

$6,800

$6,500 

You can't bloody call a higher low until there's been a lower high to continue the pattern...or a higher high to break the pattern.

You sound like a joke.
800 btc buy wall on finex stopped the drop. It didn't move.
Could you share some insights, I’m starting to believe it won’t drop before reaching 7700 - 7800 and to scared to take a position
Do yourself a favor and delete your own message.

Bitcoin dumping is part of the gay agenda 
Too early too tell, but I'm quite interested that this downbart didn't go below 7250, so if we manage to stay, creep up I'm quite happy. 

Edit: Oh I guess I'm having downdoots for dinner tonight.
The drop is good. We have held the support line for now. Let’s just make higher lows above 7k and we should be doing alright
Guy: Hey Guys do you think bullis...

Sub: NO! NO NO NO NO! Lower only so I can make money.
You don't need to construct elaborate fantasy narratives around price movements.  It is counter productive to good trading or good conversation.
Why would sellers be desperate? They are more in the money and less leveraged than the buyers.
You need some buying to look "very bullish". Floating around is not bullish.
I've been holding for years. Holders are going to post in trading threads less often than traders, but we're here. There's currently no excitement around BTC as it's in a bear market so us holders are just going about our lives and/or lurking here while waiting for the next run up to get excited again.
Hodler here. Cashed out a little bit in December and I’m still in the green. whatever the best strategy is, it doesn’t matter to me because HODLing worked out for me so far
Most traders I know have less BTC than they started with so...

The real OG hodlers don't visit crypto subs, they retire to the island they bought.
I'm a holder with 95% of holding stack and 5x short with the rest which is the trading stack.

I'll probably buy more for the hold in the 6ks.

There's many like me.

And yes, DCA is better for most people.  Any non-trader I've ever advised to tether up, waited, did it too late when everyone else capitulated, and sold the bottom for a loss.  Some bought back in higher for double loss.
I don't offer trading advice anymore in real life.

Edit:

> They all seemed to have disappeared, which is very odd. 

This place has just gotten a lot better about shitposts.  Partially thanks to the mods, and also the community becoming stronger.  And anyway the hodl gang seems too distracted preparing their nooses right now ;)
Most of the better traders here are also hodlers, trading a portion to build or increase their stacks. 

The strictly long-term holders don't really have any reason to be a in a trading sub. 
Yes. Why do holders need to come into a trading thread, particularly when this community is currently so bearish and is often derisive to those people?

What would be gained?

Note: Buy and hold, over a long period of time with assets you believe have long term value, beats most traders. Short term however, you are definitely at risk of losing money. 6 months is not a long time.
Yeah we're not here because shits boring. 

Drop in every now and again to shut down bullshit comments but aside from that I'm waiting for that big triangle to get all got. 
Of course there are. Some have been at it for so long there's no reason to talk about it any more. 

And if you'd held from any period other than the last few months you'd be far better off than most traders too. 
>preaching about DCA and saying holding is a smarter strategy than trading for 98% of people out there.

This is still probably true, regardless of price action.

Go to r/cryptocurrency or any top 50 alt sub and you will see some of the strongest titanium hands in the world DCA every week with their allowance money. 

People here are generally much smarter. 
I HODL all of my coins except my trading stack. First time I sold was in December. Bought back in Feb.

Not selling ever again
Yup im a big hodler from way back. Still made shiton more money hodling than I ever did trading using TA. This sub is full of bears now greedily gobbling up the low prices but the tides will turn as they always do. Bears are just the parasites whilst the bulls are the hosts. We will recover in due time
I’m 100% hodler no matter what. 

I only trade to increase my BTC/Alt stacks. As I strongly believe crypto has a bright future 
I realized a lot of profits in January and have been holding since, staggering my buys
hodler here.

2015 vintage. Still going strong.

Also bought at 12k down to 6k.

Hands are made of iron. never X sell
Mods banned them to reinforce the bear echo chamber.
My GOOD friend u/mdk72002 has been a long-term holder since $120 BUCKS and holds more Bitcoin than you will EVER see. Just 10% of his Bitcoin is worth more than your ENTIRE family. BACK OFF
I stopped holding any coins when I realized that there's no reason to hold them when they keep going down for several weeks. I only have BTC on Bitmex and I slowly start buying alts when they are bottoming (like now) but I always sell them all after a couple weeks.
You can't catch a falling knife during an uptrend or sideways trending market.  It has a specific definition, that you can either use correctly or incorrectly.  Your friend is using it incorrectly.
Catching a falling knife in recent context would have been an entry between 7040 and 7075.  But it doesn't really apply, a knife would go deeper.  It's a huge wick dominating the region of the local lowest lows.

Anything mentioning 9k has nothing to do with falling knives.
Technically speaking, going long just below 9k means by now you should be almost liquidated unless you are on very very low margin 
I will be able to answer when I know where is bottom.

Thank god for this post or we would never have know the of bitcoin...
You talk verbal diarrhoea non\-stop thats why you get downvoted.
Just let the bears be. If they want 6k, 4k, 2k, or even 1k BTC, let them drive the price down. Think about all the BTC we can get for those prices!

C'mon bears, you can do it!
Dont forget your towel.

Rule 2
Look up vomiting camel. :P
That's not a downtrend though. The $6.8 to $8k candle marked a reversal/uptrend. At least in the context of the size of the h&s

But I personally thought it looked much more like distribution + markdown. 
Nice observation.

 The price action topping structure (could call it h+s or double top if you felt inclined) shows the declining momentum managing to turn price. the continuation of that into this slanted h+s  shows momentum continues to fall. But now i might say we have a slanted double bottom and perhaps we will see momentum continue to build up and eventually turn price.
**Pattern:**

Bart up to right below resistance line. Give Bitcoinmarket Subreddit hope we are just consolidating below it to break through.

**Next:**

Bart back down, but not all the way.. just 25% to make bitcoinmarkets Subreddit think we found a higher low

**Next:**

Go sideways for 16 hours and complete the bart and make lower lows and all the perma bears come out of the dark saying “ i told you so “ 
I'm thinking people over 50k Euro monthly volume could probably afford some fees, but they are trying to cater to institutional investors so I'm guessing they worked the numbers.
Hmm 10 euros a month for zero fees sounds like a fair deal for trading.

50k wouldn't be much if they offered leverage though but looks like they won't be doing that sort of thing.
Yes it was way too easy the last five years, even though I managed to screw it up much of the time anyway.
I remember saying that in 2012. Before the Cyprus bullrun. 

There's always going to be a next, insane, bull run until everyone is already using bitcoin for their savings &/or commerce. That price will be well over $1m per coin, Perhaps even $3m per coin... But no one can possibly know when any of the runs will be.

It's a good bet the next will co-incide with the launch of a Wall street-ready bitcoin EFT, however.
I'm genuinely interested in your perspective in this.

comparing the *ecosystem* situation to the one in 2014, wouldn't you say much has changed?

There is much more buzz about bitcoin, and especially blockchain in a corporate environment. Now I will be the first one carrying the banner in saying this doesn't translate to sustaining a certain price point, don't you think the barriers to entry are now much more diminished for people to enter into the crypto environment?

I'm not speculating, curious for people to share their thoughts. 
There is no way in Hell we ever get close to $1000 again. We may never be under $7K again. February may have been the last chance to get Bitcoin under $6K, and only a few people were lucky enough to snag that (me among them).  

I think people fail to understand the basic arithmetic behind this market which is the reason we went from an idea to $7k with $20k as a glimpse of things to come just as $1k was in 2003. It's one big bear trap, mathematically. We're probably in a small bear trap right at this very moment. Fakeouts go both ways, fellas.
I think at some point people will look back on $50k or $100k predictions as laughably low as well. 
There's no way to be up 10-20 x if you bought last year. More likely you're up 50% or less... and that's if you bought at a good time.
That's true. So I guess it was pretty fast initially but since then it's largely been sideways. Ever since we've been ranging with lower highs and higher lows I've stopped calling this a big downtrend and have admitted it's much more of ranging/sideways. 

But I do think it'll make a big move soonish
I don't know how I'll survive making all that money...😅😜

I think bitcoin is a bubble in its purest sense. it didn't need terrible news to pop - bubbles pop no matter what, sometimes news pricks the bubble, but it only happens when there are no buyers left, not because of sellers. 

You can kind of notice this on a smaller scale every time we do a run up lately. It will seem like there are almost 0 sellers on the way up and then suddenly when the buy pressure fails to make a new high all the sellers show up en masse.

And I'll believe that we're still in a secular bull market if we can break up and out of this range with high volume, otherwise I think it's just that bubbles take a very long time to deflate. 
How are fundamentals bullish?

BTC like every other crypto is based solely on rampant speculation...and the hype has died for now

BTC and crypto is a giant bubble, which has well and truly popped since January. Time to go all the way back to before the hype began.
You mean the trend where we fell 30% in 3 weeks and then bounced 5% into a brick wall? 
> Dont play with what you cant afford to lose.

Thank you, I never do.

> This trend seems legit bullish

You're delusional if you think you're not already in some facial recognition database 
Pretty sure you'll find a MA fitting the current price if you try 1 to 365
But is it a bearish, bullish or bartish gringo ? You never know which flag they fly
McAfee?
It’s really not, just pointing it out lol 
I think this sentiment will change if early 2017 bagholders, especially the bigger ones who are still very much in the green, start capitulating. I bet the percentage of people in crypto still holding the same bags from 2014-2015 is minuscule so I don’t think there will be too many bullish people at $3k. It will be mostly either fresh blood or people who were foolish enough to baghold and DCA all the way down there. Not sure if I would even buy $3k btc. 
You could have written in 2014: If BTC drops to 200 USD I dont expect to see 20k USD.
Which is fine, if BTC drops to 2/3k and it even returns to 20k at some point that'd be a fantastic return.
The moment government and Wall Street took notice the party was destroyed by futures ;)
Why was 1k cheap? Surely it's all relative. 
Uh, some of us have been around for 5 years
Edited. Thanks for the feedback.
I think you hit it on the nail Sloppy. The moderating seems fantastic, it was just the *image* that seemed rougher

That said, I'd like to offer another approach to u/jarederaj which some of the mods of more controversial subs have taken. Essentially "We're good mods. Stick to trading. Point out when we mess up. But if you can shoot the shit in your posts once in a while, so can we."

Essentially, the mods themselves own the reputation of being wry / "witty" / dry / sarcastic or whatever you want to call the type of humor.  If the community, and especially the frequent posters buy into it, then the lurkers will too, and the newcomers will learn.

*I'm guessing, it has a side\-effect, of becoming a barrier of entry to root out the rigid, timid, or noobs. Though it may actually have the effect of increasing banter by those who remain, veterans and newbies alike. At least, that's what I've seen in other subs*
I have gotten banned a few times, but I still am in favor of overmoderating, vs undermoderating.  Of course a perfect balance is ideal, but would err on the side of removing too many borderline crappy posts.
You'd probably have feedback from me if you were.
If Bitcoin gets back above 20k you can piss in my eyes or wherever you want 
There was an influx of angry shitposts by some bulls but they kept getting deleted by the mods before anyone could read/respond.
I was thinking it confirmed Half-Life 6.
Kicking myself that no one has picked up on it until now.
I enjoy me some data dash. Learned my basic TA from his beginner videos and love how he uses his moving averages.
I did not get told about this 6th of the month pocket money day! Going to speak with my lawyer, no way I'm letting my parents get away with this.

On Social Trading Sites most people are still very and far too optimistic. Reddit is just a niche. ;) 
Most of the time I follow this threads sentiment it ends up backfiring. Hopefully this time is different, although i did manage to get out before this mini dump so its looking good for now.
Not bearish Here.... just Patience ... and not take decisions on an 1 or 3 hours price / behavior.

Well done essentially locking in profits at the top of that bounce. 
Position closed with success



* Position: long xbtm18

* Opening value: 7,225.00

* Average value: 7,225.00

Then close it. 
Like I said, this should bounce at least a bit here. Possibly even as high as $7,600. 

But buyers just don't seem to be in any rush to keep pressing onward. They're falling into the same pattern we all know and dread of making a single strong push up, but failing to continue that momentum.
This is really a bad place to put such a high wager if you're gonna get rekt.
Your stop goes below your entry silly :p 

You'd still be in had it been below.

*clinks glass*
I'm watching it too, doubtful but fully expectant of a pump out of nowhere because why not.
Doesn't look like ascending triangle.
The spoon does not bend.
What do these tea leaves say?
Sure, nothing prevents this. Although I'd suggest we're not very likely to go *much* further down.

I just don't think the r/r would warrant a trade here. With two recent examples of the weekly RSI reversing VS. a bear market \(in a very different overall market type/size\) with fairly unique qualities, I know where I'm putting my bets.
>I feel just about everyone is doing this. So I feel the only way to not miss this entry is some laddered knife catching. But need a plan B if it falls through the floor.

That was my first plan that i fucked up. had buys laddered from 7200-6800 and two out of four filled. I think falling through 6400 would be a nice short entry. that would make the 6750-6450 a no trade zone for me. The idea was to ride the longs to the top of the triangle at least but fomo happened...

>Was a fickle one-shot alt pump as per the trend

When the biggest dump happened and there were threads with suicide hotline number, i was considering buying alts and again riding them through to the top of the triangle but got greedy thinking theyd go lower. 

>I'll just regret not having a long

this is (along with not following the plan) is my biggest issue rn. knowing that i preplanned a pretty nice entry and then locked in way too early.

I guess we'll see as always. 
thx

When you've been staring at the screen for 72 hours... you're bound to go sometime!
This bart simpson thing it isn't a pattern. It is just noise in a very small market with low liquidity.
Why are there incels on this board lmao
You're right. I guess it's better to stay in fiat and go long only if price does happen to retrace down.
This Choppy market. Has this today with this EOS stuff ( Linked with ETH ) what I'm reading here and there?
No, what I mean that was a fake out few weeks ago and we successfully returned into a downtrend.  
I personally expect to see 6k before 8k.
If its the channel you are talking about then that is just how it projects. There are rules to projecting channels that give you ideas of time and price targets. That channel was projected from earlier pricing to give an idea of the bottom, notice the price rejected falling out of the channel.

Edit: I will add more detail here

[This is the details of the projection](https://www.tradingview.com/x/7Gc9FzpY/), its not a trend line which is important. More details on channelling and how to use them can be found [here](http://stocata.org/ta_en/elliott7.html).
The buyers need to follow through on the reversal, if they let the price sit here the sellers will come back in and force it down. 

Remember far more longs are underwater than shorts, the overhead supply needs to be convinced to not sellout at the first opportunity. Impulsively pushing through resistance levels will be the only way to do this.
On a downtrend they pull, on an uptrend they push ;-)

Really interesting viewpoint.  
His view seems to be neutral at this point. If tape readers are reading neutral then what is trying to be communicated (from your perspective and outlined framework).
Also, I think this is the kind of tape reader that's more common:

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/IOTUSD/p70C0eNh-Crypto-Review-May-30th-Don-t-trade-the-Dumb-Zone/
He said a little more than that. He changed his price target and made a specific contingent.
The man pivots. It's a dynamic world.


Also, 5,8 is the 70% he is referring to.
The low was around $6k.  70% drop from ATH instead of 80%.
Isn't he referencing the 6k bottom?
Lol TA estimates are like hand grenades, they lob them and hope they get close enough for people to call it "good."

It is encouraging he has finally seen the light at least.  I'm sure lots of people listen to this talking head.
Is there a target in Crypto world!!!???
This is awesome! People will eat this kind of shit up man.

You should do more 
Damn boy. You’re pretty fucking educated on BTC. Some cool facts in there.

Brilliant comment. Thank you
And then don't forget to mention the fees that the purchaser would be paying...

Oh and the fact that all your funds will be lost if you lose your private key
sauce?

Edit: A single address is significantly smaller than a grain of flour if the reference is a square with the diameter of the milky way as the length of each side

A grain of flour is between [1 and 100 microns](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/particle-sizes-d_934.html)

There are 2^256 possible private Keys in Bitcoin. Not sure how to compute unique addresses, but it should be in that ballpark since elliptic curves are over the same finite Galois field.

EDIT: See comment below, there are in fact only at most 2^160 unique addresses because pubkeys are hshed twice, once with SHA256 and then again woth RIPEMD160. Add the version bits and the checksum and you may just come down to the correct calculation woth the spec of
flour. Too lazy to do ot again, but 2^(256-160) = 2^96 = 7 x 10^28, so pretty close. Add that the Milky Way is apparently twice as large as I use here, and square the 100 microns for a big spec of flour and it should be spot on

[( 100 microns * 2^256 ) in lightyears = 1.2 x 10^57 light years](http://m.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2%5E256*100+microns+in+lightyears)

Milky way is 100 k lightyears in diameter = 10^5 light years

A rectangle with each side being that length is 10^10 light years squared.

Yes, we actually need to square the diameter of the spec of flour, lets just assume 10microns diameter and let 100 microns^2 be the area

So even if we used a spec of flour to be 1 micron, we would still be off by an order of magnitude of ~40

So more like trillions^2 of Milky Ways

Awesome points, definitely adding that to my list 
Do you trust a chinese cartel that owns over 51% of the hashrate, you can end with something controversial but gets them thinking.

There has been lots of technical development going on. Lighting 4.2 beta released today.
We also see hashrate rising steadily: https://bitcoinwisdom.com/bitcoin/difficulty
Business majors. So definitely want to focus more on the use case/ price side VS the technology behind it. 

I’ll write those points down on my list 
They don't always follow eachother, but since that BGD in April, alts have been a pretty good indication, like you said, when alts started correcting, bitcoin was soon to follow.
!long XBTM18 7460 5% 2x
BCH is not an altcoin
!short xbtusd close 7340


 I just had all day to short at $7500’s and shorted a little too much on the bounce, in a spot I’m not too comfortable with. 

The Bart’s have been acting weird so either waiting for 7650 to break or 7000 to hold/ break, seems like the smartest play 
Yea BTC has definitely been boring in this 7k range.

I cant wait to get out of this range even if it means going a lot lower. Whenever we move sideways i feel like it’s just gambling at this point. Like what number is $7300?? I expected to get to $7200 and maybe move sideways around there 
Same here.  Moved my stops up on a long from 7104 yesterday and they got hit on that mini dump.  Wasn’t to violent so I got 0 fee limit sells.  Fuck it, don’t want to miss a BGD so...long again from 7365 w/ 2% stops.  I know I’m prob gonna get stopped out in this chop but...whatever.  I’ve been profitable this bear cycle.  I don’t want to miss the party.  
Nice, whats your target(s)?
You're fine, hombre.  You picked a bottom.  Don't close too soon.
Im up-voting that.  I want some of whatever you've been sniffing tonight!

Is he like the Colbert Report?
Highs are just noise. Since Feb 5, the average price of bitcoin is up.
you fool, you don't realize the plan...we are going to sneak our way to ATH

if this was pumping full blast, people would catch on and FOMO in and make way too much profit for the crypto gods. Slow and steady with an occasional dump keeps them on the sidelines until they turn around and see the price at $12K...then you pump to $20,000 over 1 weekend(so they can't transfer money) and then force them to buy above the ATH to start the next pump
Only a mentally deficient newb with the attention span of a fruit fly thinks volume is down. We're double every day last year (minus December) on an average day and 50x greater than when this shit first started changing lives.
Looking on longer timescales, volumes are actually way up. Of course volumes aren't as high as the peak of the bubble in december/january, but that makes perfect sense.
> volumes down

Just lol. You perma bears are a joke
Kills their account, yes.

There is no free lunch in bitcoin....except for Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto of course.
It's amazing to see how many people are still getting liquidated for massive amounts of money...4 months into a bear market. So much hope, so much fear, so much panic...when that's all gone, then we can go up. When no one cares and have mostly forgotten about bitcoin. When this thread is down to 80 comments or something per day talking about how flat it is and how boring.
At $6k we had already dropped 70% from ATH though - which is in line with other previous big corrections - and painted a massive reversal candle. Very different from this example.
Yassss, edited. Thanks!
7700 seems really got r/r for shorts, though I'm a little on the fence about it seeming "too obvious." I'm keeping my eyes peeled in the event a lot of shorts add-on without pushing the price down. 
They are technical formations that you won't find in any technical guide outside of this forum. BGD = Big Green Dildo. Bart is a formation that looks like the outline of Bart Simpson's head. It goes up quickly, zigzagas sideways and then drops quickly. 
No worries!

Bears can't see the obvious now
Yes that's a very big possibility, but as it stands i'm expecting the breakout to be bearish. We will see though as charts can turn very fast.\(If we can trust charts and TA with bart manipulators\)
If I were you I would re-short as soon as you see a noticeable downtrend. But what do I know. haha
Or short @ 7400. Resistance probably.
Oh, that was a typo... I meant but. Silly me ...
I was so sure we wouldnt get above 7500 that I closed my long right before it.

Very strange to actually see it happen, but I anticipated a much larger bart back down.
Mikey ... when you gonna get bullish, bro!?

10k? What about 16k?
I hereby nominate you for Cpt.Obvious of this sub.
When 7600 falls, it will fall spectacularly, probably by lunchtime in NY. We may well blast through 8K today.
If we go up we're bullish, if we go down we're bearish. Who's with me ?
Eth is slowing down on the ethbtc ratio. Seems likely to revisit 6 or maybe even 5% again... And that means even if BTC holds this price, eth will be in the low 400s. 

Https://www.tradingview.com/x/dD1iQTtU
Before you go all doom & gloom, we're still in higher low territory. btc is still up about 300 from low, eth is still up 50 from its low (nearly 10%?) I'm not going to lie, it's not looking pretty, but until we make a new low nothing is said yet. 
They have been squeezed from yesterday now to return to adding on the way down. But the ratio of ethshorts vs longs is 1 ish so i dont think a new short squeeze will fuel another rally just yet
Even though I'm short, given your entry, this is a solid plan. You have a beautiful entry if our long-term support holds. 
> Easier said then done.     

understatement of the year. :D   
already read it but guess I should re-read it, thx for the tips

thanks, good idea. gonna take a few days break. good luck everyone !
That was the case in 2014/15 I think.. 
That's my theory too but I hope we don't get there 
Also wouldn't be surprised by a return to the thinner pink line to confirm it as resistance in the weeks following it breaking before really falling back to the multi year uptrend line.

I do agree though that the thin pink line breaking and staying broken for a week or two is truly the sign of a long term bear market for 2018.
God I love this sub for their names! Thanks 
> “suburbs”

I hear you can get a lot more for your money outside the city in Goblinville 
That could be good enough for some weeks of green imo.
Those last two points I think summarize really well most people's motives.
Good post 
Bulls are definitely much more delusional, and have been that way from the start.  Although BTC did go to $20K, so some of their absurd fantasies did come true and bears missed out on those gains.
That’s because we weren’t painting bear flags...
Seems a bit heavy for just being bearish, the bear flag(s) you mentioned probably weren't really bear flags or hard to identify. 
Except for max pain.

I said that last time and the trap never sprang.... 
Well, ok, NVM, we dropped.
What is this useless comment
Ok sorry
The volume on this little rise is awful. I'll be surprised if it doesn't completely fall apart in the next 15 minutes.
Good time to get my DCA lower
WHY?!
no,  it's an indicator,  'bears', 'bleed', 'slaughter' in one short post?  count the frequency,  we are only 30% there IMHO.
Haha xD Love this sub 
Extreme Bias because almost everybody is short in this sub. This is the shorters sub.
Volume of 30-50 BTC every 15 mins for since 11pm last night on GDAX. Huge drop just now 854 BTC. Tell me again how thats not manipulation.
Yes. Do you have a point you are making?
it's not pretty, but the concept is: resistance tested, falls to a bottom, same resistance tested again, fails and falls partly down, retests resistance again and breaks through.
Visually it looks like a stretch.  But I gotta admit that it fits the volume profile.
My chart seems to be a woman. Have no idea what she wants, don't want to say anything, I need to guess and in the end nobody will be happy.
The weekly chart is pretty in line with what i said.  Maybe you like to trade the 15min,... its fine. 
Your implying that this is dead cat bounce?
> ok at the chart history of 2018 and you will see a very clear pattern if you want

rather based on 2018 performance, just look at the 4 hr and 1 day charts
While I personally agree with your opinion, it's his right to post relative garbage. This only loosely qualifies as a violation of rule three. Similarly, the accusation that it's a ban worthy post falls into the realm of rule 4.

i guarantee i have spend more hours watching the charts live and studying historic carts than most people. maybe that makes me both dumb and clueless or maybe that gives me insight into what has happened and is happening
No, those numbers aren't important. It's just noise ...
can you give an example of a lower high and one of higher low?
How much value do you put in the original 6k low?

It could have trivially bounced off of 6500 or 7000 the first crash instead. 6425 could have been 6225 or 6025 without the Kraken whale giving the market room to breathe.

Well. During bull market the price would generally rise on Friday’s. People get paid on Friday’s. Coincidence? Yup.
Are we really that delusional with respect to cyclicality of the markets?
Wow, I got downvoted, and you got upvoted. Tells me everything I need to know. Thanks for the data, fellas.
No. We're looking at conditions in the real world and considering how they might affect the market. We're also looking at historical data when end of weeks coincided with end of months. Looks good.

Have a downvote for calling me desperate. 
This is exactly the market sentiment we need for a reversal.
yes I see it. But it seems not many want to buy here. If this wall want to see an higher price he needs to do it by himself.

Shorts are down 10% and longs are up 5%. Shorts opened during 42 of the last 46 days are in the green. But keep expecting that "squeeze" to occur.

u/gypsytoy... You may want to do your research beyond the whole CSW ordeal
Eh, is Gavin all that noteworthy other than because he was #2? He never struck me as particularly inspiring as a dev (though I'm not a dev, so I wouldn't really know) but he also got scammed easily by CSW and didn't know what to do afterwards. That puts him solidly in a dumb category for me. Add on top of that his recent support of BCash and you get a picture of someone who is way too idealistic and simplistic to be considered anywhere close to a top dev. There are much better devs, in addition to the ones listed above.

Ok thanks and was just curious if you guys still exist, and apparently you do.

Yes of course over 50% of people who try daytrading crypto, stocks, etc. do not succeed.  I think everyone knows that.
If you actively trade (especially with a short position), then you really aren't a holder.
> The strictly long-term holders don't really have any reason to be a in a trading sub.

No, they don't.  But that didn't stop them last year from contributing every other post.
They didn't "need" be in the trading thread last year either, but every other post was by a holder.
Doubtful.  You have to be a terrible trader to lose 50% of your money, YTD, although actually that can be done fairly easily.  But not by 98% of traders.
You are an active trader. You aren't a holder.  And you buy and sell often, as you state in this sub.
Would you consider buying more *if* $4k becomes a reality? Or got enough?
> the tides will turn as they always do.

They don't always turn.  The only thing that is constant is change, and some of those changes mean that some markets never come back..at least not in years or decades.
You aren't a holder if you sold some of your holdings in January, and are now buying back at lower prices.  That is called trading, just over longer time frames.
What is the point of having BTC though if you never sell it.  Do you plan to leave it to your relatives when you die as a family air loom type of thing?
Bulls had a whole year+ of fun. Now it's time for the bears to shine.
That's new. I usually get accused of the opposite. This is a nice change of pace.

Anyway, let's try to keep the bear/bull fight stuff on the DL. It's just a metaphor. There isn't a real fight.
if I could get $120 Bitcoin right now, I'd probably hold it too.  What's your point?
Many of the so called "hodlers" wisely sold some above $10K, which means they are no longer holders and became sellers/traders.
This.

Best "knife" I ever caught was my $62xx add on my sept futures long on 4/1. Too bad it was a tiny position lol
You have to be trolling right? 
I don't even know what to say to this. No.

No it's the opposite of that

">" means "is greater than"

remember when 1k was high as fuck?

I remember when BTC hit 750 and getting all giddy we might just actually make it back to ATH again

That was 18 months ago
Haha the negative votes are instant the moment a bullish message is written
Belows pls. Also that above comment aye caramba. Go downvote please bulltard
The volume still soo sooo little. And so many longs. 
Simple.
Yeah but I actually like Tone's analysis. He's pretty much retarded about everything else though. 

Rick is undeniable a tank of hot air inside of poorly fitted clothing. The video of him that [Roger retweeted](https://twitter.com/rogerkver/status/1001490943004979200) today is just a new low for stupidity and egotism. Worth watching for the laugh.

Dan is clearly an opportunist and a shilly businessman before he is a programmer. His tweet yesterday sheepishly offering $10K bounty for his multibillion dollar crowd-funded shitcoin qualifies him for this poll.

Hey hey heyyyyyy!
H&S is always a reversal at the top and we are in a downtrend from our ATH, the slope of the line shown is very representative for the average decline since then. 
until we go below 7k, I wont hang up my horns

If we go sub 7k... well I’ll be quiet then. Even if 6.8k holds... going sub 7k is bad news and I can’t imagine anything outside BGD will save us
I think analyzing the ecosystem is a very interesting approach. I think you can look at BTC as perceived by high finance, BTC's core tech, and BTC's market share in the crypto space to get the gist.


**Financial sector-wise**, there is a huge uptick in corporate interest. This is undeniable given the advent of sanctioned futures products, high profile execs leaving corporate finance positions for blockchain-related roles, and the murmurs of ETFs on the horizon. It's much easier for retail investors to get involved now too, with far greater numbers of fiat onramps. **VERDICT:** *Better off than 2014*


**Technology-wise**, I would say the BTC ecosystem is pretty similar now to then. The huge amount of time wasted in the "scaling debate" really set back meaningful development, and while the seeds of potential solutions have been sown, Bitcoin in its current state does not scale. This is probably only of limited importance given how speculative the market is, but just like the "BTC is used for buying drugs on the darkweb" narrative undermined the legitimacy of BTC back then, "blockchain doesn't scale" undermines its legitimacy now. **VERDICT:** *Similar to 2014*


**Market share-wise**, BTC has fallen off a cliff in the crypto space. It was THE cryptoasset that mattered in 2014, and since then the rise of significant altcoins (most notably Ethereum) has threatened its market-leading status. All altcoins combined are "worth" more than BTC nominally now, and the same was not the case in the past. The events of the past year have strongly undermined the BTC-maximalist narrative, but since it is still #1, how much that matters is an open question. Regardless, BTC has competitors now and they won't go away. **VERDICT:** *Worse off than 2014*


A final verdict comes down to how you weight the categories. Now seems very similar to 2014 if you weight the categories evenly. If you think the demonstrated interest of the financial sector supersedes the other two, things are certainly more promising than they were in 2014; if you think market share in the crypto space matters more, things look bleak for BTC.
Barriers are still really high. It's not socially acceptable to buy or own Bitcoin. I hide the fact that I have Bitcoin from everyone I know. I can count the number of people who I will have an honest conversation with on the subject, IRL, on one hand.

The corporate stuff is largely irrelevant, IMO. They don't really get it. It seems like they're still stuck on the narrative that the blockchain is the same thing as Bitcoin and that they can just integrate that into their existing business model. 

Established finance isn't going to understand that they missed the boat. At some point in the future it will be apparent that a majority of the world's supply chain operates better when transactions happen on Lightning in real time than it does with credit, weeks, months, or years after the fact. 

Banks allow large inefficient market participants to flourish because those players are the ones with access to debt (and can lean on their suppliers and contractors as yet another source of low/no interest debt, eg net 30, net 60 net 90). If their access to debt is effectively crushed, and market participants expect to be paid in real time, they aren't able to participate in the market at the same level of inefficiency. The market becomes a fair playing field.

Banks earn money from the inefficiency. If the inefficiency is gone then there is literally no reason for them to exist. They wont see that until they're out of business and scratching their heads.

So, the barriers are still very high. It's not normal to hold, recieve, or send Bitcoin. Most people don't have accounts, and if they do they don't want to share that they do. It's just starting to be available in markets internationally. LBC does less than 100k a day in Brazil and Brazil is the 8th largest economy in the world (and has a terribly unstable currency).

The infrastructure isn't there. When People think about contracts, they're thinking about the execution of debt over a long period of time. They're not  thinking about a broad supply chain that executes payments in real time. We're not thinking about the elimination of debt and we can't even comprehend a world without it.
Technology is mind blowing but BTC was, is and always will be speculative.. if crypto/blockchain will take over the world it won't be BTC.
I wouldn’t be so confident about that magic 6k bitcoin, at least not until the market stabilizes in price.  Volatility is still very high, which suggests that the current bear market is not coming to an end yet.  Historically, the transition from bear to bull market has been signaled by a period of very low volatility that lasts months.  We haven’t seen that yet, and until we do, I would be careful about assuming a bottom has already happened. 
Whoops that was 2 years back thats up 10-20 X's, 1 year back 3-5 X's depending on when you got in (May was ~$1,500).  My bad.
Have I shared this with you yet?

You capitulated into seeing it's been going sideways? Uh oh, now we go down lol :p
Yes only fools can think that having billions of marketcap for projects such as ADA, DASH, EOS is normal. Still we need these fools. So there's no need to repeat this over and over again. What do you gain from doing this ? I hope another run in the coming years, at least one. Let them pour the money in.
Let's do the math: 

First of all, it wasn't even close to 30 percent. More like 25 if we're generous, but we'll humor you.

30% in a month (OK we'll say 3wks to humor you) = 1.5% down per day, vs. 5% up in one day. 

Folks who have been in this for less than a year or -- worse -- are no coiners and not even in the game reveal themselves. If you've done your homework, you know that a drop like last month's is nothing more than a buying opportunity. Bitcoin explodes up more than it goes down which is why it's worth $7500 today.
You're delusional if you think I wrote above that I'm think I'm not.
I've found MAs to be mostly useless.  Other than perhaps to more quantitatively compare differing momentum of different periods. (like to confirm if the last week has really been going up faster than the last month, which you can already see by looking at the chart with a naked eye)  But using them as possible present/future support/resistance doesn't seem to be helpful.
aah, fair enough.
 *...I bet the percentage of people in crypto still holding the same bags from 2014-2015 is minuscule ...*

Don’t be so sure. There are more of us than perhaps thought and we’re happy to hold for a lot longer.
At 100k it will have a 1.5 trillion market cap , do you believe in it?
Somebody correct me on the number 
It's more of a psychological thing really. People tend to look at things year to year, and the fact is BTC was 1k just over a year ago. Most people still felt like they missed the train. The longer BTC maintains a certain price, the higher this 'cheap bitcoin' price will be.

Great example would be pick any stock and look at the 1 year chart.

Edit: I think by the time October rolls around. People will start to think sub 10k bitcoin is a bargain. (If bitcoin remains below 10k by October)
exactly, so those are the one to follow
Sloppy pointed example, we talked about it, that's what I meant.

While in mod mode you should be representative. There's no room for bad jokes and sentences that could be understand wrongly. That's the example of 'watch out guys, I have power'.

You should be respected, not feared of.
Np :) 
You've been banned a few times in the month since creating your account? I haven't seen that, I see you here almost every day. Are you talking about your alt accounts?

Crypto Twitter just did recently, so expect opposite now or some jumping the gun maybe. 
That's the most surprising part.  Especially with all the faith certain people put into periodic cycles such as times of day or days of the week.
Seems like a decent enough guy compared to alot of the Cryto Youtubers. Overly bullish IMO, but thats how he makes money I guess.  The whole SUB shilling thing puts a question mark over his head for me.
Seems like a no brainer.

Are you going to tell me you wouldn't do exactly the same?
I'd short the hell out of it with as much leverage as possible, probably spreading my shorts around multiple exchanges to make it easier to enter better positions.
Do you have some examples of those sites ?
Who cares... Social Media trading Sites... Must be facebook... which are for 65+ Grandma's and Dad's 
Almost closed that long there but going on a 2 way trip doesn't look for such a bad idea for now.

" I'm nervous to be short right now!" -- https://www.tradingview.com/x/qerVpGd3/
if you think it should bounce a bit\- even as high as 7600, why not set stop somewhere like 7700\+?
Yeah indeed, it was poorly done. (though it was the safe thing to do when the price had gone above 7500).  At least I covered fees and took no loss though.  And a long here is really just a shit gamble imo.

But the point is that now that we're above there, that stop range has a high chance to lock in a loss with this chop.
I think he's saying he followed your plan and it didn't work lol 
Wasn't sure, read some of your comments, decided to go both ways, thanks.
At this juncture I feel like nothing is expected yet nothing is surprising.
Whelp, I don't see any motivation to bet on this breaking up at this point.
That a drop was likely 
Depends on how long you wanna keep the position. We could easily break the symmetrical triangle to the downside and see 6400-6000 and still be kinda okay on the weekly before a significant bounce or sideways. Then there is also wick vs close. RSI is based on close.

A short from here would be definitely worth it. But I'm biased since I'm short around 7540 average.
> this is (along with not following the plan) is my biggest issue rn. knowing that i preplanned a pretty nice entry and then locked in way too early

Yeah gotta reset now and pretend it didn't happen and not let it influence the next move, not easy.
You’re only feeling this way because btc didn’t go down soonafter you sold. We ve all been there. Trust me had btc barted down after you sold you would be patting yourself on the back. I don’t do leveraged trades so really my only opportunity to make money is when the price goes up but I’ve been on both sides where I made a lot of money and lost a lot of money/potential gains. Don’t get too greedy and try to time the top and bottom and consider every trade where you make money a win. This is a no trade zone for a lot of people so I’d be happy if I made money. There will always be plenty more opportunities especially since you’re a leveraged trader. 
But we aren't even on the ninth candle of the setup. We're on the seventh.

To clarify, the first two candles you have listed as counts for the setup are NOT counts. Candle 2 did not close below the close four candles earlier \(green candle 7 in your chart\), so it starts over at the one you listed as candle 3.
"I'm just making convincing a convincing shitpost"
Eat my shorts!
I suspect you are right.

While they seem to have increased in volume in recent months... volume in general has decreased in recent months... which would explain moderately large buys/sells moving the market very noticeably...? Make sense?
People susceptible to The Cult of Bitcoin \(permabulls that insist the only way to make money is buying every dip and holding and that the price will go up forever; usually have this weird bulls vs bears tribal mentality\) are usually members of other subs that promote insular groupthink as well. If you poke through their history, you'll find a lot of incels, MGTOW, redpill, The\_Donald \(one of the most ironic because how can you be anti globalization yet desire a global currency?\), Anarchy101, socialism, etc. members. They tend to stay contained in r/Bitcoin or r/CryptoCurrency, but I guess some drama in r/ethtrader pushed more in here.
https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8mw5vt/daily_discussion_tuesday_may_29_2018/dzsu900/

You're as paranoid as actual incels.
I hear ya.  Both cases ended with something trying to look like an ascending triangle, after a small rise, too.
Buyers are waiting for a pingpong show perhaps before they follow through, lol.. About sellers, I wonder where are they right now and why are they not selling and dropping the price already...

May be it will need more than just impulsive buying to steer it further upwards.
I know what he said, but whatever the outcome you can't say he was wrong now. Generally speaking this really translates to 'we will go up if we won't go down'.
The low so far was around $6k.
I hVe WAY WAY WAY more. But I would probs dox myself eventually

Bravo on showing your work. FYI though, just a week or two ago it was announced the Milky Way is bigger than we thought, in the range of 150k-200k light years instead. Factor out a 2! xD
hey thanks for going through the calculation, i thought the address space was 2^160 but this could have changed since i last checked about 7 years ago.
I guess you haven't seen all the progress in mining and miner diversification, a 51% isn't possible anymore, so ya I do trust Bitcoins massive diverse ledger.
Yes, but make sure you use the referral link to get that sweet fee rebate though 
In the case of business majors I think you should also spend two minutes talking about the energy useage and externalities. It is fairly frequently brought up as a counter-point to blockchain and bitcoin sustainability in particular, and they've surely already heard one side of it. 

Edit: And probably another two minutes talking about compliance and why Wall Street is shying away from "money laundering" in crypto.
It’s a crapcoin
Shorting a break of 7k from an r/r perspective isn't amazing though if we don't go sideways to cool off indicators. Sure the symmetrical triangle would have broken down but any big drops to 6k for example are impossible for the daily to handle RSI wise and BBands wise except if we are going to throw history out of the window. I'd be inclined to say that we drop to 6.7k max and then multi-day bear flag up to the symmetrical triangle support. 

With the top I'd agree though. Anything above 7.8k could be considered slightly bullish though and above 8.2k seriously bullish.
What feels strange too is that x millions new dollars are needed everyday to keep the price up, yet it doesn't really tank. Something feels wrong, don't know what.
7700 but looking to ride this one potentially if we do go back up and just chase it with stops.. I have a gut feeling that 7100 is the bottom at least for now which would make a higher low on the weekly which is macro bullish
Agreed. I also consider time in my algo, but its not as big or as often as his. #timeconsideralgo
Gotcha! Thanks
That's not a bull market homie. That's delusion.... Or indecision at best.
didn't bch try this?
Yeah this is how it is going to happen. Pump so hard that everyone start praying the price to stop to go up !
And volume in late 2014 was up 1000x compared to when bitcoin was $0.50. 

You realize you can't just compare them like that, right? It doesn't make sense 

The volume should increase with price unless people are just buying and selling amongst themselves more expensive bitcoin 

But I think we're going to see higher volume here soon anyway. Been ranging on low volume for months now so next move will be explosive up or down.
Do you know how stupid you sound? That is the most ridiculous belief somebody could hold. You might as well be a theist. 
6 months Bear Market started in Jan
You are correct. We're nowhere near the bottom.
I've asked many times: "Under the current environmental circumstances, adoption, and use cases, why should BTC be worth $10K? Why $6K?"

I've yet to hear a compelling reason that does not include "Because it will be worth a lot more if all those things improve."

I already believe that. That's why I hold BTC and trade to get more. But I've yet to hear a justifiable reason why it should be worth $7500 right now. 
7700? +200 points haha
My adds are laddered on the way up, so I'll catch some of them even if we don't break 7600. I'm still not overly confident that's a good plan, but if we break through, there should be plenty of opportunity to flip positions, as we should be headed (via chop) to retest the pennant top around 9K. 
Ah, you are only comparing a single 15 minute leg of both events.

I'd suggest to look at a higher timeframe if you wanna compare the volume better.  The 2hr seems to contain the entirety of both movements.
Agreed, which is why I don't mind paying it. And they know their user base can afford it. 

If someone's trading with like $100 though idk if I'd suggest it lol
Just use your phone carriers email to sms gatewwy, so you get text alerts via email. Then it's unlimited.

E.g. most carriers will let you email a text via phonenumber@carrier.com 
Um I'm not sure. I can check in a bit if you want. 

Yes I do reach the limits, but only when I accidentally forget to turn off an alert though and set it  to trigger every 15m candle.

Like say I set an alert at crossing up $7.5k and set it to trigger once every 15m candle...I'll get like 30 alerts from that alone and over a week or two it adds up and I don't get alerts anymore.

I use cryptowat.ch for price alerts since it's unlimited and TV for trend line and indicator alerts. 
Yes! Which is why it's awesome. 

the 1.04 would be the "price" of that chart and you'd just set an indicator on the price being > 1.04
They never can. They're seemingly incapable of zooming out beyond December.
I'm long so I'm also biased, but usually the barts we have aren't really indicated by much TA, they just happen. 
Leave it, it's perfect. 
Yea this just seems like a giant dick tease. 

I’m short from $7350 and if we go sideways here for a while I’ll probably close because we painted a “ Higher low “.  

I see this barting back up. 
I wanna believe 4.7k will be the bottom, but my mind says we'll probably dip below 3k
Great. Thx
We are on the way... 

Thx
Nah, descending octagon and 804.3 macdaddy is over dojo’d on the 1 second chart so there’s little chance of that pal
Haha /u/haserfauld 's reply is much more descriptive. :)

Depends on the quality of your goods. 
Do you have any other adjectives to describe bulls than delusional?  It’s gotten pretty stale. 
if only the bulls/bears delusional sentimental "analysis" could be quantified objectively
Hard to plan for max pain (hence the name), but if we break 7800, I'd just ride stops up each support level (2 behind). 7600 > 7800 > 7950 > 8100 > 8300 etc. 

Of course, I'm short right now, so there's that. But if I had a long from 7100. That's a sweet entry.

And the chart will blame you for everything 
The weekly chart shows a huge pennant with lower highs 12.5k, 11.7k, 10k and higher lows 6k, 6.4k, 7k

Don’t get cocky kid. You’ve been charting for less than a year (most likely)
no, I think this a higher low(will be invalidated if it goes below $6800)
Hot hands logical fallacy. What has happened in the past will continue to happen forever. 
Please... with all due respect. Get off your high horse. You’re an amateur. We’re all amteurs. How long have you been charting? Think you got it all figures out?

Also, I have a shoddy resistance line from 10k that's been broken on the bounce to 8600, but still seems pretty good on resistance in the rest on the price movement that might've turned support. Also, the fib retrace 0.786 is exactly there on my chart. It's not great, but it's something. 
Thirdsies.
50% is incredibly optimistic, over 90% of traders lose money and I'd wager that a miniscule amount of retail traders beat the market over a long period of time.

That depends on what the definition of is is.  (since we're splitting semantic hairs here)
Here's a shocker. Holders can also do small-medium time trading. People often have a trading stack for fun.
If you cherry pick a date range you can make anything look good. Buying and holding is not a short term strategy.

Do you wan to use your same example starting 1 year ago at May 29, 2017?

NOTE: 1 year is not long term either, but you get my point, hopefully.
Maybe 80 to 90% of traders.

The amount of long-term profitable traders is likely far less than you would expect. 
You can be an active trader and hold some for the long term. I fail to see how it's a one or the other choice in your eyes.
I have enough.

I would consider opening longs though.

If we go below 2k I’m buying back any coins I lost by longing
Well that depends on if you believe in the blockchain as a revolutionary technology or btc as a real fiat contender or even a store of value. If you do, than the future is bullish and bright, if you dont, than its bearish and the entire CC industry will fizzle out in a few years.

So guys, let me tell you, I love, BIIIIIIIIIIIIITCOOONNNNNNNNECTTT!!!!!

(Obviously the biggest shitpost you'll find, however the biggest meme as well.)
First of all; Excellent post, and thank you for sharing!

Question 1: Don't you think the "issues" that BTC and ETH are trying to tackle are extremely dissimilar, and therefore even their role in the crypto environment should be evaluated as such? 

Question 2: kind of related to both your technology and financial sector perspective, I think that the (financial) services have improved substantially since 2014, based on market share is exchanged, and overall permeation into the financial environment. Moreover, from a technological perspective, there is somewhat of a roadmap of new innovations that will be implemented into BTC to enhance its scalability/functionality. (admittedly, they're not there yet, but it's highly likely they will be implemented within the foreseeable future.) Don't you think their considerations will be taken into account when looking into a viable store-of-value/means-of-transaction?  I also think the exchange ecosystem has become much more mature and capable of storing crypto's

Question 3: What do you think is the most important category for further value increase. What would you like to see happen as a catalyst for future price rise? Should it be institutional, or retail?

Thanks for your response! really detailed :) I appreciate it!
It's important to consider what other categories are there. Perhaps resilience and robustness, these being defining characteristics, and I think btc is somewhat ahead of ETH and the alts in this regard. And arguably more distributed and robust than four years ago.
> The corporate stuff is largely irrelevant, IMO. They don't really get it. It seems like they're still stuck on the narrative that the blockchain is the same thing as Bitcoin and that they can just integrate that into their existing business model.

I think the X factor in this perspective is if it turns out that bitcoin is non-correlated or inversely correlated to equities and other 'traditional' assets. If so, investing is diversification to their portfolios and then they are merely looking for custodianship. 

>  It's not socially acceptable to buy or own Bitcoin. I hide the fact that I have Bitcoin from everyone I know. I can count the number of people who I will have an honest conversation with on the subject, IRL, on one hand.

With all due respect, what's the demographic of your social circle?

I do consulting in the logistics industry. There's a wide range of VPs/managers/department heads/etc that I interact with. Every executive >50 years old has dismissed it as 'bah, bitcoin, the use case is money laundering'. Yet many of the middle managers, district and department heads are interested in it. I sat at a convention of 100+ people just a few weeks ago, and ended up spending an hour of the lunch break discussing the block chain. Of the nine people at the table, three of them knew what it was, and one of them admitted to privately funding altcoin mining for profit, to the amount of mid-five digits. It was a very, very interesting experience.
Wow, thanks for your reply! I'll go through my perspective step by step. 

>Barriers are still really high[..] on one hand.

I have no idea about your social environment, or even what an "average" social environment would entail, but I have a very different experience. Late last year the buzz was literally all around me (even from rando's that I was sitting near in restaurants were talking about crypto) and though the buzz has subsided somewhat (many people lost [a lot] of money) people are still interested in the phenomenon.

>The corporate stuff [..] business model.

Valid.

>Established finance isn't going to understand [..] after the fact.

I think missing the boat is subjective. I can speak from experience that the financial sector is actively researching and analyzing cryptographic/blockchain solutions to enhance their business performance. Their role as intermediary in financial transactions is something they're well aware is being challenged, therefore they're currently looking at other ways to monetize this new environment.

>Banks allow large inefficient market participants to flourish [..] fair playing field.

??? I'm sorry I don't think I understand your point.

> Banks earn money [..]business and scratching their heads.

Maybe true, but there are many elements of financial institutions that haven't been solved/optimized to function economically.

I do agree that the infrastructure really should still improve, but to go back to my initial question, wouldn't you agree that it has still drastically improved since 2014, with less monopolized behaviour of exchanges, development in security in individual as corporate security with crypto, and overall crypto exposure?


I strongly disagree.

Didn't expect this bit from you.
Yes, if you buy early and hold for a long time, then you win. That's how this works.

https://www.moonmath.win
I saw that! And it's very interesting. I really do agree that with these weekly bbands contracting we're in for a huge move.

Either way it  goes I'm excited to just get out of this range and possibly with higher volume for a bit. I'd be happy not seeing $7-11k for a while...
What's the takeaway here?
Good lord man. Since you like math so much:

9948 high on 5/5/18  
7027 low on 5/29/18  

Days: 24  
Percentage change: -29.36%  
Number of days with >-5% moves: 3  

We're up 7% (wait...no...6% now....erm...5% now) from the bottom.

Your argument is literally "it always goes up, watch" on a speculative asset crashing off a blow-off top and you have the stones to be condescending to me? EL OH FRIGGIN EL.


You should look as them as averages, not support or resistance. The further you are extended from them, the more chance you get you will cycle back towards them. 

Chart: https://www.coinigy.com/s/i/5b0eac7f9cbf0/
That's a good point. More useful for viewing acceleration / explosiveness. Anyways eth was testing the bottom bband on the 1hr too. Are bbands typically bad indicators for resistance / support too? (My understanding is their main use is predicting upcoming volatility) 
Yeah well I hope you took some profits on the way up.
I’m just a shit poster though
Yeah, drinking this feedback in, finally.
This isn't a good source for conversation.

I am trying to do my job as a mod and I do try to have a light touch.
When I'm saying things like "stay off my radar" I'm making a joke. I'm actually really lenient. If people ask to have their bans lifted I almost always comply. I hesitate a lot about banning people, too. My self-perception is that I'm not power hungry, at all. Pair that with my humor, which is, fundamentally, self deprecating sarcasm... All that doesn't translate well to text. I'm finding that I have to be humorless when I'm a mod because any trace of humor I use that's natural to me is criticized as the thing it's intended to mock.

I could be better about using /s ... but dry self-deprecating humor gets lost in that. It's better that I just learn to switch voices, I think.

You should check out one of his livestreams sometime. Much more personal and in depth than his regular daily updates. Definitely would agree he’s overly bullish but then again, he does think a bitcoin ETF is coming this year haha
eToro for example. Even most of the popular investors deny the bearish trend and are still praying Hodl to their followers.
We are struggling on our line yet again, it seems, but it feels inevitable: https://www.tradingview.com/x/U6QMeO3s/
That's funny but took me a while to get it. The moment you're getting nervous is the moment you should close or deleverage cause you're getting rekt sooner or later.
Because $7,600 would be a new local high, and potentially signal a strong reversal back above $7,800.

I'd just prefer to be out of the way sooner rather than later if I'm wrong here.

I honestly might exit even sooner, somewhere above $7,500. We'll see what happens.
It’s 1:15 risk reward so I don’t mind locking in a baby loss should the market turn, I’m already in a long from just under 7300 so my stop will actually put me at breakeven after adding. Zooming out i believe it’s a very conservative and reasonable target after the bullish engulfing candle on the daily. Just looking for a 12 ema touch.
I haven't been around for a while so I doubt it. :p
Yup, and was implying to take care to avoid locking in losses in this situation. 
I think that means we've achieved  Nirvana. 
Aye, im gonna try to be happy with the peanuts of profit and just forget about it.

One blessed thing in all this is my absolutely shite memory lol
Thats actually painfully true. If it dropped after i sold, id probably suck my own dick for a few days and then forget about it lol.

But yeah, any wins a win so in grand scheme, happy days.

although not sticking to my plan is really shitty. got quite a history of doing it as well. need to create a system for myself to limit "on the spot" decisions cos theyre usually not that great
Fair enough. It’s an early attempt at it and thank you for the clarification! I’m sticking to it and let’s see where it goes. 
To add, there are "beyond 9" patterns too, such as the 9-13-9 perfect buy setup.  It's not a guarantee that 9 sequentially lower candles = a new bull run, it's just an odds game TD players hope plays out.  Smart money will put a stop at the lowest point of the lowest 9 candle in the event the pattern continues downward.
Well the volume that we can see on bitcoin exchanges is very low so I would say that most of the trading happen otc and that exchanges are just a liquidity buffer for otc trades. Someone make a big deal and in the same time buy or sell everything on exchanges up to his price.
Holy crap. You just said an internal thought I've had for the longest time.
This place is also full of groupthink, the only difference is the entire group changes their outlook every 24-48 hours.
Fucking... burn...
https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8mw5vt/daily_discussion_tuesday_may_29_2018/dzsu900/
Yeah exactly mate! I don't even know now how should I now analyse ascending triangles in the future. Kind of losing trust in them breaking upwards...
Today's sellers are the buyers of the past 45 days. They're all underwater except for the past 3 days, and they're hoping against hope that we continue recovering. If we turn around here and start dropping, they may just accelerate it, thinking >7300 is better than <7000.

People who shorted in the last 45 days are all still in the green, except the last 3 days. Most people who shorted from >8K probably closed somewhere between 7500-7050, as well, and are looking to reshort a breakdown of 7400 or a continuation to 7800. If we go up, I see another stalemate up around 7800. If we drop below 7300, it's likely the express elevator down. 
I think it's more of a, "It's more likely that we go up from here than going lower, but if we pass X number, all bets are off".
It communicates a shifting perspective, not a price target. You're describing disappointment over a statement he's not trying to make.
The message was unsigned, plus the e-mail associated with that account is conformed to have been compromised.
Put that in! Looks like it comes out to be approx correct after all!!!
Because of RIPEMD160... you’re right! My bad. That should put the calc in the right ballpark for sure

EDIT: Added a comment about it
No. If 7k break will turn on panic mode then indicators and TA will be irrelevant for some time. For now people believe in higher low. If they stop you can forget about RSI.
yep, unless your believe that miners are withholding large amounts of BTC and are paying for expenses out of pocket, then, assuming a constant price, logic dictates that the market is collectively buying up all of the newly mined coins each day.
You need to short harder. Like ... 100x that shit, ya know!?
honest question, but wouldn't a higher low on the weekly be neutral, not bullish?
Are you saying the average price of BTC is not up since Feb 5?
and the exchanges shut down like the good ole days last year!  oh man nothing would make me happier Lol
¯_\__(ツ)_/¯
I agree, just threw a number out there. 
There are a lot of different reasons for Bitcoins value, so hard to answer.

One of the big reasons for the volatility in Bitcoin is that all of the things that give Bitcoin value are hard to measure for value. Thus it is hard to determine what 1 Bitcoin should be worth. This increases volatility caused by sentiment and speculation.

In my opinion some of the most important things that give Bitcoin it's value are:

- It's network effect (Basically the number of users of the Bitcoin network, the more it is used to more valuable Bitcoin becomes)
- Independance from fiat currencies (use as a hedge). Bitcoin can be used as a hedge because it is largely independent of other asset classes
- Use as a store of value - Still has to be proven over longer timescales. But Bitcoin provides an excellent store of value, where only YOU are in control of the money. No one has the possibility to restrict your access or control.
- Easy of use for international transfers (remittance) without controls
- Limited supply - Speaks for itself, no exposure to inflation like in fiat currencies
- Expectations on future use/increase in value - The future use of Bitcoin is also an important parameter to Bitcoin's price, the more it is used/spread out, the more valuable it becomes. Possibilities of a Bitcoin ETF, or just a large increase in retail/business use are a positive price component.

Typed this out quickly, so probably missing something. But key is, the value of all of these is hard to determine. Hence it is hard to determine Bitcoin's 'actual worth'.
That's a good idea. Thanks.
But cryptowatch won't wake up your phone, will it? What do you use to wake you up? Bitcoin Checker on Android has failed to go off too many times to rely on, I think because of the how it interacts with how the phone sleeps. SMS would be good but only if I was always running out of credits. 
Yes there are? There is no buying, look at rsi, volume etc.
I think so too. It should be lower... very strange
Congratulations!
Yeah that's a solid plan. I'll probably do the same IF we get there.
Where would you put your stops if we go down?
This post’s got some wrong to’it
your mother called you son?  Didn't you just say you were a lady?
But... Isn't it ***always*** after midnight? 
You're right. I failed calculus 3 twice.

BTC bounced 2 times off the bottom of the triangle...

guess what happened third time I took Calc 3? 

97.8%...

I thought it was your paycheck coming in man, shit 
Reddit is a universe of echo chambers, within the multiverse of the Internet. Welcome to the information super-highway!
This thread is completely filled with people now saying "see I knew it was going to go down" WHILE it is going down.

Reminds me of psychic readings. "Your dads name is Dave". OMG how did you know. The end. No new information, no testable prediction. 
what are you basing that on?
Oh without a doubt. Its not like somebody just sold 100s of BTC, BCH, LTC, ETH, Etc... at the same time. Oh wait.... 
Sorry for not sharing in detail my position.  Thats how i make money. You call me whatever you want. in 3 weeks from now... i will be reposting this for you lady.
true, a pattern is only good until it breaks
didn't mean to upset anyone. just posting my opinion based on observing the charts a lot.
correct, but IF the 2018 trend continues then this would be a likely path. that is a very big IF of course
Consider me officially messing with you and your cult with this latest comment.
I was not at all being sarcastic. Cycles are extremely important in this market.
I'm not sure you understand how capitulation works. 
No, I was just commenting on the outcome of the poll. Not your opinion (which you had not stated) :)

But in any case, if you dont know who the peeps above are you could always look into them
Fucking weasel has probably never had sex with a woman he didn't pay first
Ok, thanks. Not a fan of fractals and don't follow fib and that 10k line is higher for me. :-)
Fourthsies.
I didn't say 50%.. I said "over 50%", which obviously includes 50.0000000001% up to 100%.

And I was replying to "most", which is over 50%.
It is called the English language.
If you think holding through a 70% drop is ever a good strategy, then we will agree to disagree there.
I would expect it to be about 90%, just because that's what I have read, and it seems logical from my very limited experience (which included losing all my money a couple of times).  However, no one really knows for sure and it's all conjecture.
You aren't a holder if you ever sell a significant amount of your BTC.  You were a holder up to that point and then you are a trader.
Thanks. Interested in price points that long-term holders would consider good value.
Bitcoin is not the entire cryptocurrency industry and nor is it the blockchain.

But no, I don't view Bitcoin as a real fiat contender.  A real fiat contender has to be legal, not illegal.
Yes but Morpheus didn't forsee Bitcoin becoming illegal in so many places.
Interesting. Hadn't heard about that. If you have more details about this please DM us mods about it. I don't want to stir up drama, but I am curious about how demographics can change and for the reasons they might change.
No, not to me at least, it's really not... albeit I am far from a professional trader.
There is only one line in my chart, and yes I mean that line. The downvotes I get makes me think this could exactly play out that we bounce from this line. It is suprisingly almost identical with our small pennant / flag resistance line.
Thank you, was caught up in an emotional moment
Feels like a century though.
Good then. Oh i edited it, Maybe need to elaborate and some confirmation with price bounce a bit. Also pretty sure most of it bulltard. Also which part of bart and down you dont understand? 
**1:** I think BTC wants to be money/value and ETH wants to be a worldwide computer. The market hasn't convincingly decided whether decentralized gold or decentralized computing resources are worth more, but for what it's worth, every time ETH's market cap approached BTC's thus far it's been rejected savagely. Decentralized gold hit the scene first and is a lot easier for old-school finance types to grasp and understand. Whether the current situation will hold in the long term is anyone's guess, but my money is on BTC in the near term (~3 years or so). Getting smart contracts right is HARD.


**2:**  I think it's unreasonable to expect major technological changes to BTC. The expectation has been set (good or not) that hard forks of the main network are undesirable, which takes a LOT of technical options off the table. All major innovation will likely have to be soft-forked in, and will essentially enable interaction with "layer 2" systems, a la Lightning. BTC maximalists have given up on the notion that Bitcoin can be a good means of exchange out-of-the-box, and the narrative has shifted from "digital cash" to "digital gold." I think this is being taken into account when looking at the market already - people who think digital cash is more valuable are buying BCH, people who think digital gold is more valuable are buying BTC. Time will tell which one is actually more valuable, but the fact that BCH hasn't rolled over and died like many expected should give any BTC maximalist pause.

I definitely agree that exchanges are in a much healthier place now. There's just no comparing the professionalism of BTC-e with Binance, for example. Night and day.


**3:** I think all cryptos will return to a fundamental value eventually. As more and more people get into the space, the power of "clique opinions" like those found in the various echo chambers of Reddit will drop (more perspectives means more people doing their own research and making their own judgments instead of following the herd). Bitcointalk, Reddit, et al will be far less important.

In my opinion, crypto fundamental value consists of some combination of the following factors: security, use case, and network effect. Security is a catchall for cryptographic soundness, immutability, and decentralization - important pillars that inspire investor confidence. Use cases vary - again this comes down to how much weight the market assigns to BTC for trying to be money versus ETH for trying to be a distributed computer. Those two use cases have an intrinsic value to the world, we just have to wait for the market to tell us what they are worth. Network effect, in my opinion, is the most important though. The more people that are part of a chain's network, the more options you as a user have when transacting with it, and thus the more likely you are to decide to use it in the first place - a virtuous, exponential cycle. New users beget more new users until you get something like [hyperbitcoinization](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/hyperbitcoinization/), where in a very short span of time it seems that everyone has become part of the network. I think the "winning cryptos" will experience something like this after the speculative phase ends, and everything else will die. In fact, I almost think you could quantify a crypto's "network exponent" - the exponential rate at which a given crypto grows based on ease of new users using it - and that would be a great indicator of where to put your money for the long term. I'm inclined to think the exponential growth potential of a given crypto's network effect trumps the security and use case validity concerns in the long run, and will be the dominant factor in their valuations many decades hence.

I think the catalyst for future REAL price rises is going to have to be some sort of usefulness improvement. Solving the scaling problem can prevent future fee explosions, but isn't going to be a reason for people to care more than they do already. Scalability is a [hygiene factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_theory), not a motivation one. Being able to use crypto for something novel or genuinely useful in day-to-day life will probably precipitate the next bull run. Will that be dApps? Will that be sound money in a time of worldwide central bank-facilitated inflation? Only time will tell. With world events as they are though, I think capital flight from traditional financial asset classes is imminent, and crypto stands to gain a lot if properly positioned and available.
u/Debo37 knocked it out the park, so I guess no need to respond 
I think they're different things. If there's a relationship I don't think it will get worked out for a very long time. More likely, one system will gradually slip into the other... and we both know which system I think will win out.
My experience mirrors yours depending on the city I'm in.

Everyone is allowed to have own view.

I've worked in corporations, worked for Banks... World isn't perfect. But I'll stop this discussion, maybe some other time.
Why? I've said it like 100 times already.
Except $200 to $20,000 was all one massive bull run.  If that's over, then it's not moon math time.
IMO, we're going sideways or down for an uncomfortably long period of time. Pretty sure we can move through ranges a little, but I'm also pretty sure those BBands are going to keep contracting for a while. People are jumping ship and the market is getting lean.
It seems likely that if continuation of trend is how we break out of the coil we could conceivably spend some time much lower. Personally I'm not excited about the prospect! However, I'm giving back a lot of my winnings in this choppy market, so not comfortable here either.
i would like to know too.

Well I've seen 50/200 1D MA acting as support/resistances, might be coincidence maybe not. They have their use on long timeframes. 
Hmm.  And on your beautiful charts it's really nice to visualize if it's currently contracting or expanding.
There's a huge set of rules and guidance on how to interpret the bbands.   I've found it pretty useful about resistance / support, and also about riding the edges of the bands when they're broken, and guaging likelyhood of an impending move.  The thing with bbands is that depending on the situation, you interpret them slightly differently, it's not about lines in the sand.

Edit: im not really an expert in them though.  But I am *always* watching them on any timeframe.

The safest profit one can make. Along with many others I sold all the forks Dec and start of the year. 
I'm just curious what he means. If he's ban evading, I would think he would try to keep that to himself. But I never had a problem with PeaceHere and I don't have a problem with soranwara, whether or not they're the same person.
I think a lot of it is just lost over text, I usually was inclined to think you're joking but couldn't tell for a while. 

If you make it a little more obvious that you see yourself as another degen like the rest of us (even if you don't see yourself that way) I really think most of the perception of "hall monitor" would go away. 

Or simply avoid using personal language about yourself, don't say me or I unless you simply have to. 

"I will ban you" vs "you will get banned" or even just "The mods will have to ban anyone who does so and so" 

It's a subtle language thing that I think presents an unnecessary distinction between regular users ans moderators
I'm sure he said... but in mean time he is buying like hell

If you take trade decisions because " people" say this on these sites... then you take wrong decisions!! 
I'm on mobile now but I think I had this line at 7.4, that's why I bailed out of long.
Nice, If you are long from 7300, you are perfectly positioned for this situation!  Can ride this totally risk free.  And sitting here, the gain is still small enough that you probably won't be too tempted to close prematurely in meager profit.
no I just mean he's saying he tried it, got stopped out already 

nvm 
Or apathy.  Which happens to be the defining trait of the music of the band Nirvana.
well looks like it worked out for you!
For sure. And I'm not saying now isn't a decent entry point, particularly on low leverage, if you can stomach potentially being underwater at 6900 and prepared to take your losses if we fall below it \(support line we've been holding this entire correction\). Just wanted to mention some things regarding the TA.
Agreed. Just because I'm curious and don't use TD all that often, what is the second 9 in the 9\-13\-9? I know of the setup \(9\) \- countdown \(13\) pattern \(mentioned that in my first post\); is the "perfect" situation another setup occurring after the countdown?
Do you know what price OTC trades happen at? Thinking about it logically, I'd have thought OTC trades happen at (or close to) the mid-market rate. It's a trade between two entities, both of which want to avoid slippage.

There's no point in a buyer paying more than they would pay buying off exchanges, similarly a seller would not sell for less than they'd get on an exchange with slippage.

It doesn't matter whether either party is an individual, a hedge fund, or an exchange. Also I'm thinking of legal interests, not some gangsters who want bitcoin to buy weapons or whatever.
> Today's sellers are the buyers of the past 45 days

Or could it be that the sellers are just shorters? In the other scenario, if we don't drop from here, we might shoot upwards and the tables get turned, shorts go underwater..
Interestingly enough he said chances triangle breaks down vs up is 66-34%. So he says a few contradictory things...
I read his position as neutral. I don't think he has any position in BTC and he's waiting for a reason to take one.
I'm not. I understand what he's trying to communicate, I have a problem with the way he did it.
didnt know that
>if the reference is a square with the diameter of the milky way as the length of each side

 just noticed this, reference would be surface area of a cube and not a square so the flour grain can be more average sized.
That's speculation and not based on data.
> yep, unless your believe that miners are withholding large amounts of BTC and are paying for expenses out of pocket, then, assuming a constant price, logic dictates that the market is collectively buying up all of the newly mined coins each day.

Either that or temporarily not selling in hopes of higher prices. 

That said, I know quite a few alt coin miners who are selling alts for BTC and then sending that BTC to cold storage.
I think it is neutral too since it appears we are in a symmetrical triangle. If we push up and fail to break 9k I bet all the bears will come swarming out again saying, "See! We can't even make it to 10k now! This thing is rekt!" Even though that's exactly where resistance is now. 
I guess waytooamped means its bullish compared to the alternative.
Neutral in the short term, but it establishes an uptrend from the bottom of 6.5k so I'm looking at starting to accumulate coins again. 
Why are you fixated on feb 5?  
Good reply, and these are basically all the reasons I own and trade to get more BTC.

I do believe that the final bullet point is the largest reason it's currently valued as highly as it is, though. If the adoption based on the other points ramps up over the next couple years and the environment (primarily regarding taxes) shifts more in favor of BTC, $7500 will likely be an absolute steal.  

I'm hoping to play the volatility and risk of the market to acquire more BTC without having to invest additional capital out of my pocket. 
Lol believe it or not I don't have anything to wake me up. It's pretty stupid actually. 

I can set my phone to my speakers and set multiple alarms and that works. But generally speaking, I try not to be in a position where I could be in serious trouble if I sleep for 8 hours. 

I usually set forgiving stops if that's the case. 

Oddly enough, if I had slept through the BGD I would've lost less money than I did staying up through it and just assessing later.

Right now I rely on people I know in different time zones to call me and wake me up if shit goes haywire lol 
There's hardly any buying or selling. Volume hasn't really indicated much, every bounce we've had has been hardly any volume, just getting propped up by big green pumps. 

RSI is recovering from the BGD, again it doesn't indicate much at the moment.
I’m watching the higher low too. I posted yesterday that if it holds convincingly above 7250, I would consider longing. I’m in a short from 7500 here that has stops at 7400. I will let it ride for now, and re-assess if stopped or if we make another leg downwards.

The important move is never the bart or the dildo itself. It’s the response to it. Does it get slapped back down/up to whence it came, or is support found at a new price point? That response should drive position taking, not FOMOing off the spike itself. That may seem obvious to some, but I’ve learned the hard way as a noob!
Thanks !!! - Finally!! After being here more then 3 year and 3 years in BTC. 
On a long from 7100? I'd probably cut it if we fall below 7300. 
What happens in Kansas, stays in Kansas 
I cant decide  my gender right now. Generally on Wednesday’s I’m a female, but today I’m feeling different.

What, did you struggle with Vector Functions?? Idiot. 
Longs to shorts, premium on futures, hodlers from below $5k who haven't sold yet, random straw poll I conducted here (lol)
Mmmm, you should probably familiarise yourself with how these markets work first.
This is such a retarded comment, but whatevvs bro.

Also, I never said you were wrong. I said it was a little early to be calling a sub 6k bottom when we havent yet made a lower low.

But you seem like a righteously arrogant individual who “makes money” by “not sharing in detail his position”

Based on your grammar, I’d say you’re probably Italian. Can’t say I’m surprised.... Italians are generally quite arrogant when humility goes a long way

And the name is L one fourty. Not lady, NEDBZ
Right. So how could you use that as an example like you just did. 
All good. Just maybe think on terms of the next days, not what the bottom will be basically
I’m trolling everyone. I’m a male and hate feminists.


Gotcha, I read it wrong.
Capitulation has to do with the last of sellers finally selling. Not buyers stopping buying...if buyers stop buying, price tanks. 

I don't think *you* understand capitulation 
Haha, That's absolutely valid, I'm not holding this fractal nor fib nor trendline in high esteem, but I considered it a decent area to look for support in case we would downbart. Turns out it's not a terrible area, but none of my buy order got hit :( 
And you know what, if I could trade with foresight KNOWING that we would encounter a 70% drop, I think any reasonable person wouldn't hold through that. But guess what? No one knows the future, and it's very easy to say something was obvious in retrospect.

The ENTIRE CONCEPT of buying and holding is you do not know the future, and markets can shift substantially in the short term, but over longer periods of time, assets generally reach higher valuations. **Holding is risk reduction in the long term and a risk increase in the short term.**

Does it always work out? Nope, sometimes assets fail (and that's why you don't throw all your eggs into one basket), but overwhelmingly it does pan out. Go research yourself if you want, it's not like buying and holding is some kind of new an exciting concept.

Edit: I should also note even a holder of assets does not hold blindly. If you feel like the fundamentals of an investment no longer makes sense, it makes complete sense to sell, but price fluctuations should not be part of a buy and hold strategy.
No? That is just blatantly not accurate. If I hold an asset for 5 years and then sell it that does not make me a trader, it makes me an investor who has sold his share in something.

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trader.asp
Im a hodler again though. Not going to sell my long term holdings
I mean, when you bought all your coins sub 2k, with the majority being sub 1k, it’s kinda hard to
complain about 3 or 4k, but it’s also kinda hard to buy at those price points outside of trading
> A real fiat contender has to be legal, not illegal.

I think you need to learn a little more before claiming such useless statements
Sarcasm
I wouldn't consider the downvotes, that would be tea leaves on top of tea leaves ;)
Tbh I feel like 20k was yesterday, but it was in fact very long year for me...
Wow! Happy cake day first of all!

Great post once again, thanks for sharing!

I think you make some excellent remarks in your post, though I'm wondering why you're taking network effect into highest regard with respect to valuation. Do you think new entrants or more transactions necessarily equate to a higher valuation of the system? I avidly follow the NVT ratio, though the translation to value is something that is highly construed in my opinion. Moreover, most of the higher valued networks' NVT ratio is really high. 

Your last paragraphs is absolutely phenomenal! I'm sure the diversification into more exotic assets (crypto) will proliferate as long as the financial markets don't start raining on the parade. With financial backing, I'm sure innovations will be catalyzed too.

Thanks!
Best post on crypto I've seen in a long while.
I can conceive of a world where banks once again issue private, non-government backed currency and everything is translated back into bitcoin as the peg. Not sure how long that would take, but I can picture it. 

Cheers! thanks for sharing the link.

Listened/watched a bit more think I should've but I'm not exactly seeing your relation of the centralization/hedging of risk, and its relevance in financial institutions' desire to support inefficient markets. 

I can see the argument for the control of money supply to support the existence for derivative and hedging products, but beyond that, I'm not entirely sure about the link with BTC. 
Fair enough.
No idea, must have missed it. Pictured you as a long term bull/maximalist for some reason, but that's a compliment.

Out of curiosity, how do you picture "crypto taking over the world" without bitcoin at the helm?
Moon math predates the second go at 200. /u/azop was making the rainbow charts by hand in excel back in 2014 and they still fit then, at the same 0.3% CDPR, with bands that had the same width. The whole thing is one massive bull run from 0.
look at the table...it's always moon math time.
Based on the chart above and contracting BBands, you still thinking DCA equal amounts weekly through end of 2018 is the way to go? 

I still have dreams of catching the bottomish, but that is likely delusions of grandeur. 
Yeah, that's why I've been setting up so long for the big move down. A coiled move down would be pretty aggressive and violent. (and profitable if short) 
Yeah that's what I thought too. I must have misinterpreted someone else's TA at some point a while back and never been corrected lol
The 50 MA and the 200 MA can be used as support or resistance yes, because so many people use it that way. There's nothing inherently special about a MA that gives support or resistance to it, that's what I was trying to say. 
Nice job. I first bought BTC in Dec 2013 and after holding through the entire bear market muddled them into shitcoins and high caps alts and sold a bit too late in March. Still made a nice profit but wish I held the $760 bitcoins and put fresh capital in instead.
To my knowledge, there has been no ban evasion and they're telling the truth.
Yeah, I'm sure I'm nothing special. Would really rather not be a mod than have the hall monitor label.
Erm, I didn't say I am making trade decisions because of them. I just wanted to point out, that there are still a lot of people really confident. Even most of my RL buddys are still very optimistic for another ATH this year. While I am not. Everyone must do their own DD. 
Well, we broke down on mine as well, too, so it's probably moot. I'm wondering about adding. My short is only about a 1.25x short at the moment (5x with 25% of account). 
gotcha
*puts on tin-foil hat*
Yes OTC trades happen close to market price but where this market price is coming from ? OTC trades ? 

OTC trades can't be classified in a single category they are by nature unique and can have a lot of hidden advantages like making good friends, advertisement etc. So I can't tell you why people are selling or buying but what I can tell you is that this bart simpson thing through the order book is from people that don't care about the spread.
Shorters are not the ones bulls should be concerned about. In fact, shorters lower the severity of dumps due to profit-taking and closing (i.e. buying) as it drops. Shorters sell, yes, but they sell with a 100% guarantee to buy again. 

The real danger is holders or leveraged longs selling. There is no guarantee that they'll buy again. Many do, but some don't. And those that do may actually end up buying higher, if they're panic selling in the first place. 
Ohhhhh.... good point! We are talking the area of the entire cube, hence 6 times as much
also, username checks out
I said 'if it will'. That's an if but highly possible. But we have to break that first. When we touched it we were so close to ATH downtrend line that we may say it acted as support and this drop is just a fake out.

You know, it's all speculative here, nobody knows the future, we can only calculate risk and reward. And breaking the uptrend from higher lows is a big reward.
Right, I agree. We are no where bullish yet, but definitely setting a lower low on the weekly would for sure not be good, at all. 
exactly! 
Ok, fair enough. 
>Right now I rely on people I know in different time zones to call me and wake me up if shit goes haywire lol

But who will call these people?

I don't set alarms either, mostly because they don't work. If anything, I'll just leave my computer on and set something on cryptowatch. 

I did sleep through the BGD. I woke up momentarily, checked the price and it was $6800. Went back to bed for a few hours and when I woke up I realized I'd went back to sleep within a minute or two of the start of the candle. I had short stops get hit somewhere around 7.4K and that's the best I could hope for in that situation. Still, even when not in position, I'd like to be alerted if certain things happen. 

I'll probably get a TV 'Pro' subscription for the alerts and the increased charting capacity. I couldn't care less about the 'social media' aspect of it.

Proud of you, Sloppy! :\) 
Yes it does, uncle Bob isn't buying bitcoin.
No, sorry, if you are short from around here.
If it where to go down below 7K, where would you put your stops (support level, 2 behind). Because of wicks and fake outs it's becoming hard to choose a "safe" place to put them.  
I've gotten stopped out twice lately because of tight stops above resistance ($30-40 over where I thought resistance where).

Haha I actually didn't struggle with anything related to the math, it was other shit not related to math. just was a bad student and didn't know how to/never had to study in my life before
Its all organic bro. 100%
Capicce ragazzo!, but no im not IT.  
because the pattern has been holding all year so far. if you were long based on last years patterns then you did well. this year shorting has been a better bet so far
Nobody's getting trolled, you're just an idiot.
You seem to think the last of the sellers finally selling should result in a big wick V bottom.  

It can also happen in a long drawn out sideways period aka summer 2013 or summer 2015
The very people that would stop putting money in because of recent price action are the same ones who would also sell because of it. The quicker they stop putting money in is the quicker they sell, and, as you said, the quicker the sellers finish selling. 

That's why you *don't* want public sentiment to be positive on the ride down. It means people are still holding bags to sell, rather than admitting defeat, liquidating their losses and stopping their purchases. 
You won't be so sad if we break through 7k support ;-)
Again, we will agree to disagree about the wisdom of holding through a 70% drop.  Obviously, the point is to sell before it gets anywhere near remotely -70%.

And holding BTC at $300, during long sideways market, is different than holding BTC at $20,000 after it has doubled in a month.  And that is not only obvious in retrospect.
It makes you no longer a holder, because you just closed out that trade.
until you do...which could be in a few days, weeks or months.
I thin you need to learn a lot more before claiming that is an incorrect statement.
Lol. No. I'm not holding, I'm here for the money.

Blockchain can take over the world. The technology itself, not BTC.
Grabbing the bottom is not a noob strategy. The noob strategy is to spend a small amount of money each time you buy and buy for a long period of time on whatever interval

That said, I think you could try to time the market with a 2 - 4 week DCA like I recommended in the the fall. This market is VERY different from that market, though. Your level of risk is very high if you're taking out a big position right now. I'd categorize it as gambling instead of a strategy or trading.

We're going to be under the yellow for a while. Buy while it's under the yellow.

Luck more than judgment for me. I don’t trade that often but this sub is a great place for sentiment and general info. Good luck out there - keep calm & look for where the value add is be created. 
I think it's mainly the language, man, and I believe you that you're mainly joking. Just doesn't translate over text is all 

Part of it is that you're a lot more active than the other mods so it comes off as heavy handed even though that's what everyone was literally asking for before you were brought on. So it's not really your fault, you're doing exactly what everyone asked for lol 

I think if you just made it more obvious that you're mainly joking about "stay off my radar" stuff that people would lose that perception


DataDash (youtube) is very optimistic for another ATH. He hopes for 50K by the end of 2018 and explains why in his latest video. 
Great. So why don't you post your messages from your RL Buddys?, who ever they are.

Be aware... and I'm sure you know.... Social Media... easy to manipulate people!!!

Mine is 1x. Not adding until we break 7k, this may as well come back up. We crossed this line 3 times, may be irrelevant already.
> Shorters sell, yes, but they sell with a 100% guarantee to buy again.

What I mean is that may be those who wanted to short $7,600 or higher changed their plans and are shorting right now because they think it will go lower. I am thinking of a scenario where they will have to buy back for more.

I am holding leveraged underwater long myself. I see no danger and not planning to sell. May be it is just me idk. What you explained is kind of a reflection of some of my past trades, sell cheaper buy higher if ever. lol. 
Yes it's all speculative but you made it sound absolute. Your "if" refers to a break of 7k. But I referred to your belief that indicators won't matter below 7k and panic mode sets in. That is not an absolute and is simply pure speculation backed by nothing.

R/R is just not perfect for a short @first break of 7k. We could go sideways and go up to 7.1-7.2k before dropping down hard.
Ah, if we actually break 7K, I'd probably do something like this:

69xx = 7280  
67xx = 7020  
66xx = 6880  
65xx = 6760  

If 6400 fell, I'd probably just leave it around 6700 until 6K fell or it stopped out. 

Shorting this market is extremely difficult, because it requires extremely strong hands and a counter-intuitive responses. That said, I've found it to be much easier from a rational/logical standpoint. When we're not in a media/frenzy-fueled blow-off top with visions of yachts and lambos, the default trend for an overpriced speculative asset is down. I say overpriced, and that will anger some people, but there is no reason for BTC *currently* to be valued at $7500 each. It doesn't mean that it's a bad buy long term, or that it *might* eventually be worth a lot more, but that's the speculative aspect of it.

It's a horrible store of value current, and it's not usable as a daily transactional currency in the majority of developed nations due to antiquated tax classifications. If the US were to reclassify it as a digital currency and adapt tax laws to accommodate cryptocurrency, I'd instantly turn permabullish. 


If it breaks below 7 then there's big possibility it will go down far more...
Watched Dazed and Confused one to many times? That will squash your brain right next to Symbolic Logic and Partial Derivatives. Pretty sure my brain is partially clogged with resin as well. 
Like I said, if you're angry at everything dropping at the same time, learn how these markets work first. It's not anyone's fault you parked last week's lunch money in crypto and have no clue. ~
Tuga?
it was more of a quip on Paolo ;)
I’m just a goon. Embrace it 
There was two capitulation wicks to $160 before the beginning of the bull run though...
I guess that makes sense, but I think people stop putting money in long before they actually sell.. People don't generally sell RIGHT AFTER they buy their last bitcoin. 

Capitulation is different from ceasing to buy. 

Anyway, I agree with your second half, but it really seems most people are positive we've bottomed out. like 78 of the newest comments on this thread are about it bottoming / from permabulls 
As long as you'll be there with me in Goblin town I'll be happy :)
Apparently you have a time machine or "the sight" that allows you to predict a 70% drop. 

You must also be a trillionaire, because if you were so sure back then, I'm sure you 100x shorted and are now replying to this thread from your tropical island.

I am not disputing that if you have prior knowledge of said drop it's a bad decision to hold through it, but you are not doc brown or own a tartus.
And you could have made the same argument when BTC doubled from 1k to 2k. You'd be crazy to hold that right?

Point being we do not know the future, and it's easier to predict long term trends than short term ones. Learn the basics.
Ok fair enough, but selling your position does not make you a trader. See my other posts to you.
Or years, or decades...
Lock us all up for possesion of bitcoin then. Bitcoin is definitely not illegal, atleast in my country.
I'm so disappoint son. :|
Oh yeah, I am not even considering a full position now. This market is clearly not running away from me. 

That said, I am really struggling with turning on auto pilot DCA through the rest of the summer/fall or trying to throw in 25% allocations in 4 targeted buys, similar to last fall. I likely would miss it, but you never know. 

Feels so weird to be completely out....probably my gambling problem.
Thank you. Good luck to you as well. 
/u/v4mpyre made the same criticism a while ago, but I don't think I was able to hear it then. I think I get it now. Thanks for the feedback. Seriously.
All my RL buddies bought the dip. Nobody sold. 

If it were easy to manipulate people on SM they would have run for the hills because the sockpuppets were out in droves screaming "Goblin town!" throughout the drop.
I did go ahead and add, but I'm not touching it again until we break 7K as well. I'm now basically 2.5x short from 7460. Sad to give up my 75xx entry average, but chew reappearing and taking a 7360 entry made me willing to add there at least. 
Yes, there are folks who are shorting now or are already short and underwater. But since our last 2 pivot (9990 and 6400), we've spend the *vast* majority of that time significantly above our current price. Anyone holding short since April 13 is still in profit, unless they opened in the last few days. Anyone open long since April 13 is underwater, unless they opened in the last few days.

You're right, though, that if we rocket up, many shorters from the past few days will close and accelerate that move. It's a lot easier to shake our shorts than it is to shake out longs.  
You misunderstood. I meant that there is strong possibility that 7k break will ignite panic mode and panic mode turns off indicators. That's why I said 'if 7k break will turn on panic'. I'd give it like 75% chances to turn it on, and that is speculative. But there's still 25% that ATH support will hold and bounce this.
Great response. Thank you.
I saw you flip from short to long to short and was looking to see why you did that.  You moved with the market but went back to the fundamentals to pick the right move.
Your short calls in the last few weeks have really been sharp and your stack has seen the bounties of that. Nice work!
Ah, got stopped out at 7617 when it went to 7625 on Bitmex. 
I know, but I still want to put stops in the green.  
2 support levels behind sounds smart, like u/haserfauld suggested.
Hahaha I actually loved Calc 3. Calc 2 was the worst...stupid as hell 
Funny thing is that I bought more Bitcoin when it was $120 bucks then you will ever see in your entire fucking lifetime you condescending prick. 10% of my Bitcoin holdings represent your entire familys net worth. 
Short from 7.5 so if this won't fake out above 7.6 I'll be there ;-)
> Apparently you have a time machine or "the sight" that allows you to predict a 70% drop.

You don't have to predict it.  You just sell, a long time before it gets that bad. 70% drops don't usually happen in 5 minutes.  Then you buy back when it shows more strength...meaning back to the level where you sold.

Yes there is some chop sometimes, but saves you from catastrophic loss and still allows you to benefit from upside.

This is very basic.


Yes it was also not smart to hold from $1100 down to $170.
Ok fair enough and buying and selling later does not make you a trader, unless you buy back and then that is trading.    But buy once and sell 10 years later is a trade, but not really by a trader.
But more likely sooner, rather than later.  Although bagholding can certainly be a decades long project.

And I hope I'm wrong about all that.
No, not in your country.  And they have no problem locking plenty of people up.
It's just a perspective. There's always a point in life when you value money in hand more than future gains. If I'd go with BTC 5 years ago I'd be probably a holder, maybe in 5 years I'll be a holder, now I'm here for the money, add I need it more than illusion of having it.
Make a spreadsheet that covers the possible outcomes of bull and bear markets. I think you'll find that the amount you pay for a slow entry in a gradual bull market or sideways market is worth the insurance you have against an extended bear market.

Timing big buys is hard. Instead, consider identifying reload zones that you believe in and DCA in with limited portions in those target ranges for limited periods of time.
Np. I think I just had a problem to make myself clear enough for you to understand then. Glad sloppy pointed that out here.
And 'I'm here to enforce those rules'...?

We know that, you're a mod. But... You're not you while being a mod, you're representative of 'serve and protect' here. You know what I mean? 'we are here to help you keep with those rules' (or something like that). Sounds better, right? You're here to help make this a better place, not enforce it.
No problem, glad I could help! 
He's got a lot in cold storage, he can lose a lot :-P

I just cashed out all of my gains so I'm basically back to my initial investment, need to play it safe cause if it's gone I'm out. Need to make some room to go with risky trades.
I agree with your facts and thanks for the detailed information. I just hope we can speed things up a little bit to get to the outcome lol. Deadlier than the leveraged longs/shorts is this wait haha. 


> I meant that there is strong possibility that 7k break will ignite panic mode

Fair enough but this

> if 7k break will turn on panic mode

Sounds way more like "if 7k breaks panic will break loose and indicators won't matter" compared to "if a break of 7k will cause people to panic, I think it's highly likely that indicators won't matter".

But even so I don't get why you are saying this then. I think everyone knows that during panic a lot of indicators can make new historical low. Saying this, I still think they'll matter unless we're talking about really bad news and not only price.


Gracias. I'm pretty stoked to be holding a short entry from over 7500. I wanted 7550, but chose to take the entry 0.5% off my target rather than potentially miss it. I could have gotten it, but oh well. I'm moving stops just over 7550 if 7300 falls. I don't see how we don't break through the pennant floor this time if it does. 
If we break 7 then we broke down from the big triangle of higher lows. It's a place where you wouldn't like to drop your short because of a fake out.
I am sure you were thinking that you'd be too busy trading crypto and using emoticons for this ever to be useful :) I know I was. Wait, that was the dot.com bubble....

Come here you 

༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ /u/v4mpyre
If it's so basic please send me a picture of the 50 billion dollars in your investment accounts, clearly you are a master investor.

I am sorry to be rude but investing is not, in fact, that easy. If it was ETF's would not routinely beat the returns of veteran traders/investors day in, day out.
At this point this is just semantics but let's roll with it. If I sold all of an asset, and then bought the asset back a year later **with the intention to hold in a long term capacity** that is not trading, that is investing. The difference between a trader an a investor is more or less the time horizon in which you expect to hold onto the asset.
Been here since 2011

You call it bagholding. I’ve lost the keys to more BTC than you can ever hope to own.

Get off my case. Never understood your deal. Good thing I dont give a shit
Thanks Big J.
I'm just glad there are guys around who are willing to tell me when I'm doing something wrong.
Edited. More good feedback. Thanks!
You and I are in similar spots. I hit the one home run shorting from 8300, and that's given me some room. I can now pull out almost double my initial and still trade with my initial. If I closed now, it would be there. I may end up setting stops such that I'd end with the 3x initial so I can pull out the 2x and restart cold storage, but like we said earlier, this *could* be another $8300 type short if the bottom drops out. 
Yeah, could've write this better.

I'm writing this because not everyone knows. Look at those posts. There are a lot of people here who don't have any idea what they are doing.
Okay thanks. So just watch and stay cool then. 
Why would you have $50 billion by doing what I said?   The point is it prevents you from having $0.00.
If you sold it so you could hopefully buy it back later at a lower price, then that is trading.  If you sold it to pay for some emergency surgery and then bought it back a year later when you saved up money, that is not trading.
It's not bagholding at the moment.  And you are a trader, so you aren't a bagholder anyway and unlikely you would let yourself become one.  You sold closer to the top for a reason.
Nice, looks a lot better and doesn't get me scared. ;-)

'serve and protect' publicly, 'punish and enslave' on PM. Corpo exp should do the trick ;-)
Yah but you won't get them to change their minds sadly. Permabulls gonna permabull. Comfy in my short from 7540.
/u/v4mpyre is correct

If you're short from here and we break 7000, I might go 3 levels back. When I was short from 8300, I had my stops up over 8000 until we broke 7500, and I didn't move them to 7800 till we broke 7300. 
The point is you said trading was simple and obvious. If it was as simple as you claim, then I fail to see why you wouldn't have taken advantage of your purported knowledge and shorted BTC 100x to the ground. 

If you didn't, something must have held you back. Could it been because you were not sure where btc was going to go in the short term?
Agreed. I won’t baghold sub 1k. If we go sub 1k, Bitcoin over for quite a while

Id probably start liquidating heavily sub 2k
If we break 7 I'd go for be stop...
> The point is you said trading was simple and obvious.

Your reading comprehension is pathetic.  Why am I not surprised.
And we may be there, before people think, just because of gov't regulation.   BTC would most likely be over $10K if not over $15K if 3 billion people in China and India were not mostly taken out of the mix, not even counting all the restrictions in the USA, EU, SK, Japan, etc
Off a $7500 entry? Damn. I'd set b/e until 7K broke, but I imagine I'd move them into the green at that stage. Psychologically it's very hard to hold a position into 10% profit and back to 0. The hands this market takes, man. I don't know if I could do it again this soon after that last big short haha
I dont think so, but time will tell.

I assume you’ve sold your coins then
We would break ascending line, this could go up without breaking it back.

It's just theory. Entering is easy, exiting in good place is what makes you a trader.
I am a trader and there will be plenty of DCBs to profit from in the future,  but holding a long at any time is dangerous because more regulatory bad news can hit at any time.

I tried to be a holder in 2014 and it didn't work out well, although if I still had those 100 BTC now, I would be in much better financial shape.  I still did the right thing selling when I did, but perhaps should have bought back at some point.
Spot on. Although that line wouldn't be up to 7500 until mid July, and I'm short on June futs :P

Is this roughly how you have it? I'm wondering about the capitulation wick to 5920.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/6Jh2zscB/
Dont worry, I’ve done worse

In any case, the moral of the story is still somehow: Had you just HODLd, no?
More less, I included the wick. Shouldn't have to be precise with TA, but market bounced off this line exactly on the point, so looks like that's a good draw.

I said that's the theory, practice is that you would exit somewhere between 7k and new low :P
Ha, that isn't the moral of the story at all.  There was no guarantee that the price would recover and I couldn't afford to lose all that money.

Perhaps the moral is that I should have held much, much less if I thought there was a reasonable chance of "moon" someday.  But I wasn't smart enough to do that, and I readily admit it.

Anyway the "hodlers" already had the last laugh and won the lottery when BTC went above $10K.  I can never criticize that strategy too strongly, but just doesn't make sense as a religion under all circumstances and market conditions.
I dont knwo, time will tell. I can easily see Bitcoin going to 10k again. No issue at all in my
mind.

Maybe the drop killed the hype forever, I doubt it. There will be another bull run. Time will tell
It all depends on the regulations.  They have either killed it already (killed the growth) or they will in the future.   There's a slim chance it can recover and grow.  Regulating much of the privacy the anonymity out of cryptocurrency definitely makes it less valuable and less attractive.

If not for the draconian regs and bans, Bitcoin and cryptocurrency would be a slam dunk and I would be a long term holder.  But unfortunately that is not the world we live in.

And yes it can go back to 10k..that is only 35% rise from here and could be pumped up to that level.  20k...probably not but yes, time will tell.
