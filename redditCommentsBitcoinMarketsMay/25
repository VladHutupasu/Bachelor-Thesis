Hey guys, 
First time posting on here. Been more of an eth guy frequenting ethinsider and ethtrader. Just wanted to say a big thanks to all the regular posters who post really good TA. The level of discussion on here is amazing. I have been hodler since 2015 and started trading more actively this year. 

Specially want to call out chewtoy, the detailed scenario and analysis after yesterday’s drop was just amazing. It gave me the courage to hold through the panic breaks below 9,050. Entered a risky 10x long at 9095 this morning with stops below 8900. Looks like it could be an amazing entry. The old me would’ve panic closed at 9k break for sure. 

So yeah thanks again and shall try to contribute as and when I can :) 

Edit: Tagging u/_chewtoy_
The 1day BBs are probably the tightest I've ever seen them, only $600 above and below, and we are right in the middle. Whichever way we break it's probably going to be violent, probably a 15% move or more. There's also indication that the move can be either way. The 1day MACD is red and we have yet to have a large move down, and historically we do make a large move down when that happens. However, we do have a lot of bullish momentum going into this, and the RSI shows this. On the 12hr we have a hidden bullish divergence. I'd rather lose out of profits than lose money so I'll be waiting out in fiat for now until the direction is chosen, above 10k or below 8.6k. However, if we are to just go sideways right here for another few days than I will probably go long. 
Still not trading. Just hodling and enjoying life.

Feeling optimistic about the chart right now. We're consolidating above support, in the middle of the range, in what feels like a "re\-accumulation" phase. Volume is declining which is what you'd expect. I wouldn't be surprised if we return to our regularly scheduled programming in the next few weeks \(break 11.7k, then 100\-200&#37; runs followed by 30\-40&#37; dips\).

We are comfortably sitting above the 12h cloud for the first time since 2017. We're inside the daily cloud. An E2E would take us to 11.7k at the least.

!short XBTUSD close 9060 10X 100%

Futures premium is rising again and I'm taking profit before I get stopped out. 
Due to popular demand (i.e. people messing up the open commands) the bot now supports opening positions with:

!long xbtusd **open** xxxx 10x 100%

Leverage and stack % are mandatory if you want to use a stop loss in the open command like:

!long xbtusd **open** xxxx 10x 100% -sl 8750

Since i rebooted the bot some of you might receive again the last error PMs
I stepped away for like 3 days and didn't put stop losses. Lost $50k. That's why I'm drinking Coors Light instead of Coors Regular
There are some who are conflating a so-called lack of buying pressure in the 9K range due to lack of interest in Bitcoin period.  Do not forget about those buyers who will not under any circumstance manifest themselves as buyers until the point where an uptrend is absolutely confirmed.  These buyers far outnumber the active traders that are moving BTC back and forth right now -- this does not even take into consideration that BTC's, crypto/blockchain developments in general are better than they have ever been and grow less speculative by the day.  All of these movements day to day are just noise, its not worth it for the average joe to get caught up in this.  Remember most people are 'set it and forget it' investors and for good reason -- the average person is an awful trader and will lose their shirt at some point if they try.  They will hold when they have a good reason to hold - and are generally more profitable that way eg. IRAs, 401Ks etc.  Everyday that the underlying technology is adopted/accepted is a step further to that occurring. The average person will only know and prefer to long a security and these are the types of investors that will really catalyze the price.  Right now it's a zero-sum shell game between traders, what kind of everyday investor would want to get caught up in that? Patience.  We are in the early days of the internet.
On the 30 minute we are looking at two different ways you could draw it

**Bullish Chart #1**
https://www.tradingview.com/x/bvdaUvAo/

We are looking at an ascending triangle with a breakout target of 9600 ish.  We have held above $9,240 extremely well today after our bounce from $8,975 earlier this morning. But the bulls have failed to break the $9,400 line and it seems to be consolidating as the Bbands are starting to slowly tighten on all time frames. 

**Bear Chart #2** 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/aC8hxPLo/

We are looking at a rising wedge with a *breakdown* target of the low 9000’s, if we blow through the strong new support of $9,200. Bears won the battle last night dragging the price down to the high 8’s, but have failed so far today to continue the bull momentum for our next push upwards. We are flirting with the bottom of the wedge line right now, and if we break through $9,295 again it could start the tumbling effect of the wedge breakdown. 

Personally, I’m perplexed on what to do here. I’m currently long from a CA of $9,160 and I’ve closed 30% of my long position and may consider closing so I can sleep tonight. This seems like a no trade zone unless your long from sub $9,100 or short from $9,500+. 

Anyone have any opinions on where we could go? My inner bear is telling me a break down, but the market momentum is telling me a break up. I’m long so I’ll be watching the triangle more than the wedge, as we are hovering above $9,300 nicely. 
Am I seeing this right? According to "bollinger band width" on TradingView's Bitfinex BTCUSD chart, 1D bands haven't been narrower since 2017-02-21. For 1W, it's 2017-05-08. Seems pretty remarkable.
Posted selling all alts into btc a few days back, seemed like a nice entry. I gained a bit of purchasing power for whenever I want to reenter. Dominance was 36.0% then, it is up to 36.8% currently. I think the r/r here for me is keeping everything in btc (not fiat), and laddering descending buys into the alts I sold off. Personally I believe we could see dominance easily reach above 40% again, but holding BTC seems the most short-mid bullish call in my eyes. Don't think there will be a drop below 8400-8500, and don't want to miss the rebound. The value in this time period for me is getting more of the alts I believe in. Overall, market sentiment as well as media sentiment are swaying positive. 


EDIT: A few days ago, I posted this as part of my comment:


"Scenario 1: We breakout soon and I see nice $ gains holding BTC. "Oh no, no big alt rally for me!" Whatever, pigs get slaughtered.


Scenario 2: We breakout upward and alts lose BTC value meaning I increased my purchasing power to rebuy. (I do support a few specific alt coins in the long-run.)


Scenario 3: We breakout down, and alts typically drop harder and faster."


I personally believe we are watching scenario 3 play out, and believe scenario 2 will occur on the rebound. 


Best of luck in life everyone, overtrading kills portfolios! 




This behavior fits right within the psychology, volume-profile, and chart shape of an Adam and Eve Double Bottom. We've all been watching this for some time.

My take: A rational, cautious market hasn't forgotten December/January. Wary investors, speculators, and traders all want to make money, but in different ways. The first two prefer profit via price appreciation, while traders take it either way, up or down.

It's undeniably been a trader's market since the crash, but that ratio seems to be dramatically shifting as sentiment calms and the Investor/Speculator group regain the confidence required to invest fresh capital. Additionally, the consensus gap amongst traders widens each day. 
Is this the beginning, or the beginning of the end?

Fundamentally, the cryptocurrency space is burgeoning. Soon, the only remaining premises supporting a short thesis will be technical. Should the technicals turn decisively bullish, do we have any direction to go but up?

Stay safe and happy trading.

Addendum 1: Think about the mindset of a retail investor who just received a lump sum payment in the form of a tax refund. They want to put that money to use, but the traditional stock channel is unusually volatile and under the thumb of traders--just like crypto. If they're going to invest--and I believe they will--it seems like the R/R profile for *cryptocurrency* is actually more appealing than today's NYSE. When has this ever been the case?
What are your thoughts on Bitcoin being mentioned on the New York times front page? If something like that happens and attracts new interest/cash inflow, would it be expected to impact immediately?

I'm not sure how it is now but back in 2013 when I got into crypto it took me about 5 days to jump through all of the verification hoops in order to actually buy Bitcoin.
Interesting article on Bitcoin as a store of value/disaster currency — https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-09/bunkers-for-the-wealthy-are-said-to-hoard-10-billion-of-bitcoin
Wouldn't it be better to wait for a clean break of 9260? It's only $60 and going long here seems risky to me. 
Apologies for making two top-level posts in rapid succession, but I was curious if anybody else had tried zooming all the way out and drawing the mother of all ascending channels connecting the $1,160 ATH with the $20K ATH:

https://imgur.com/a/HIVq9Tm

I'm using an approximation of the OG bull trend line as the support line for the channel. 

Let's pray that either the channel is entirely baseless, or at least that the market has no interest in testing the support line anytime soon.

Pretty terrifying regardless of how you look at it. Although on the plus side we're looking at $100K btc by 2023 if the channel does prove to be valid in the long term and holds until then.
Quick question here about those fucking TA celebrity experts on Trading View, you know the ones... the constant predictions every single day. I've been reading them for fun and my God, they are almost always always wrong!

I know it's a nightmare to predict this shit but seriously, they are miles off. Most of them can't even predict the next 6 to 12 hours action without getting it wrong. 

Why do they have such large followings??? 


[https://www.tradingview.com/x/cj3k1bZZ/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/cj3k1bZZ/)

We're close to the resistance line and this will present the fifth touch on it. Likely we get a breakout and RSI will recover on medium timeframes. I'm longing if 9150 breaks.
Closing my short from a few days ago.
!short xbt/usd close 9278.5

Going long here, bullish divergence everywhere. From daily down to atleast the 4 hr. (Didnt check any lower timeframes)

Changed my flair too. I've always been a long-term holder, but I'm full bull right now and not in hedge mode. Lets see 
I'm still long from yesterday and decided to let it ride without stops. Evidently, 9050 wasn't the bottom, though it seems selling has decreased a little bit, as I was expecting a more aggressive dump after 9k fell. I'm not sure if we're currently making another bear flag, though it's starting to feel more and more *"bottomy"* the lower we get. 

the 9K push might've been stop hunting and we go up from here. For what it's worth we've been making bullish div's yesterday and the 4h MacD looks like it'll want to go up a bit again here.

I might add a little if we succesfully retest 9k. 
Kraken must be real low on liquidity, just spiked to 9464$
"Bloomberg terminal: Together with Galaxy Digital Capital Management LP, we've launched the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index (BGCI), designed to track the performance of the largest, most liquid portion of the #cryptocurrency market: bloom.bg/2FXDaSP"

What does it mean exactly? As far as i know Bloomberg terminals already shows the price of bitcoin and other crypto assets? 
There’s a couple of different hidden divergences at play, it seems. In higher time frames we have hidden bullish divergences:
https://www.tradingview.com/x/utlEikhL/


But on lower time frames (1-2h) we have hidden bearish divergence developing: https://www.tradingview.com/x/u50Iyj6x/

(Sorry for the messy charts while on my phone)

As usual the higher timeframes tend to rule. But I’m keeping a close eye on the short time frame bears here...

I think it’s quite likely that the short time frame hidden bear div will play out, but just to make a new higher low around 9.1-9.2. This would confirm that important support zone and set us up nicely for another attempt at 10k.
!long xbtm18 9180 3x

Downtrend line from 10k broken. Sellers can't push below 9k.

Maybe a bit early but this looks like it's gonna go up since bounce from 9k today.

last 4h lower high was 9247.24 on GDAX and we've almost matched it at 9240 even on this candle.  I'm sensing a 4h trend reversal incoming which would confirm with a 4h higher low above 8960.

About 1/3 of my buys filled between 9000 and 8800 last night, I've canceled the remaining and setting buys for half my remaining stack between 9160 and 9040 in anticipation of a 4h higher low (inverse head and shoulders pattern).

If this reverses, trailing stops on each 4h higher low with a rough anticipation of setting a daily lower high in the 9500-9600 region before beginning consolidation on the weekly with a higher low target of 7500 or so.  If 4h higher lows hold past 9600, definite possibility of a run for 10k again.
**Puts on tinfoil hat

The 1.5m walls that are always at the top of the order books on Bitmex are only there to force me to pay the taker fee whenever I want to enter a position.
$50 bull flag... Don't think I saw one like that holding so long.
This seems to be taking a long time to break 9.3. Is this normal accumulation and getting ready to break it firmly for once or is it worrying and we may get a solid rejection soon?
Am I doing myself a disservice just watching the BFX order book and not others? If I were to add another, or an additional currency, what should I add to my screen? I currently have Mex/Trading view on the left, and the bfxdata.com order book on the right. I've got room for 1 more always-open tab.
!long XBTUSD open 9140

Sellers look like they are easing up. Buyers are very close to breaking through resistance, and should do so soon in my opinion. 

Edit: I'm really bad at this whole bot syntax thing. I'll get there though!



I'll be attending Consensus 2018 and writing up some pieces for the sub.

What would you like to hear about? I'll consider a separate thread as we draw closer, but for now I'm formulating ideas. 

Edit: Upvotes are always appreciated, but opinions are the more prized commodity.
While the market continues it's MO of flopping around aimlessly in the $9,000 to $10,000 range, I thought it might be helpful to take a look at where the market is in relation to the log resistance line from $20K to $6,000. 

https://imgur.com/a/hLYAEYi

Since the line is descending, and the market is rising, we're getting farther and farther away from it every day. 

This is not necessarily a bad thing, however the market is painting itself into a corner the longer it goes without testing the line. 

In about 1 month, the line will be below $6,000. Which will be irrelevant if the market is above $11,700 by that time, but incredibly concerning if the market is still stuck below $11,700. 

Ideally I would have liked to have seen the line tested when it was still sitting in the upper $7,000s or lower $8,000s. Instead, the market opted to keep pressing onward. 

So we're coming pretty close to a point where the market can't really test the line without continuing to drop farther. We might actually already be at that point, since doing so at this point would drop price by about 25% — a pretty difficult drop to recover from.

Anyhow, just something interesting to be mindful of.
Not a big fractals believer but here's if this ends up breaking down and forming the third fractal of a pattern that came twice before the BGD.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/KHbJK3Oj/
Looks like the prices in the upper left of the sub are broken, been stuck for almost 15 minutes
Bounce was expecetd, i thought the self fulfilling prophecy would have  pushed us back 8.8 / 8.7 but sellers disappeared. No reason to go long now in my opinion, better to wait 9400 is broken before.

BTW, 10k by CoB today comments starting in 3-2-1... :)
Put a buy ordered in on Kraken and it instantly cancels. 

Log out, put another buy order in for .2 BTC and it executed for **.0063** BTC??????

Anyone ever have that issue?
Can someone tell me why are we not able to break through and stay above 9.3k? We seem to have gone past it like 3 times now but cant seem to maintain the momentum to keep going. Is it buyers losing steam or just usual accumulation before the next move up? 
If you are on gdax, don’t forget it is going offline in 5 minutes for maintenance.
Hang on...yesterday a lot of TA guys were shorting and calling sub 8k and now you are all going long?
Glad I held my underwater long from 9300.  I'm not dissing just confused how TA changes so quick and so extreme.
Thinking ETH/alts may be driving this market right now. They have been dumping right before BTC since the 9600 dip
So at $6.5-7k I said it looked like accumulation with buyers being extremely patient- putting huge buy walls up while sellers just kept trying to sell into them. It seemed like some big players took advantage of the market sentiment to accumulate. I was dumb and didn't long. Alas, we are now here.

I suspected it would result in a large correction with the 1d even hitting overbought (upwards, bear markets have corrections too)/run up before continuing down. 

After looking at the Wyckoff phases, it actually looks like it's playing out pretty accurately.

Is there anyone here more familiar with Wyckoff who can tell me the issues with the comparison? 

I believe we're in the distribution phase and just had a failed rally and now we are at the "test" part:

https://tradingview.com/x/dekH3NWE

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dcl8YZPW0AA25N-.jpg:large

There is also a very large bearish divergence from the 2h to the 1d from first run up $9750 to $9990. 

As well as a hidden bearish divergence on the daily from $11.7k to $9.7k. 

There are several shorter time frame hidden bull divs on the 6h though. Several in a row 

----

Sorry for how crowded the chart is.

Anyway the "jump the creek" part fits perfectly, as do the accumulation and distribution phases. Would like to hear thoughts 

Edit: the difference between re accumulation and distribution is very small and confusing. Would love for a Wyckoff enthusiast to chime in. /u/Beastly_beast thoughts?? 

Double edit: Upon  reading more, it's very possible we are in a re accumulation phase. higher lows with the composite operator moving buy walls up on each test downwards (was $8600, then $8800, now $9000).  

However, high volume selling off the highs with low volume buying  off the lows indicates distribution. 
Falling wedge broken on 5 and 15 minute charts, finex bear whales hopefully running out of steam soon.

edit: and the bulls actually following through for a change 
Bulls need to reconfirm 9250 as support (0.618 fib)

https://www.tradingview.com/x/k2oB3hsD/



Iran's currency value has fallen in half in terms of USD from this time last year.

From an online article I just read:

"The dollar was being offered for as much as 75,000 rials, compared to around 65,000 just before Trump announced his decision on Tuesday night"

That is 15% loss since Tuesday.  

By comparison, 15% off $9400 current btc price is $8173.  In the short term, btc has similar volatility, though is still way up since last may.

Just another country with a use case for bitcoin.  
Feeling ballsy. Long from 9250 until 10k retest. Stops under 8960. 
This is on a little website called The Drudge Report this morning. (30 million views a day)

"In the rarefied world of wealth management, Xapo is known for a client list studded with family offices, and for occasionally letting a journalist peek into a stronghold to write about its security. But one secret has proven elusive: how much digital cash does it really hold?

Two Xapo clients said it houses roughly $10 billion of Bitcoin."

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-09/bunkers-for-the-wealthy-are-said-to-hoard-10-billion-of-bitcoin

EDIT: Say what you will about Drudge, but the site is one of the largest if not the largest drivers of news-related internet traffic in the world. If it's about bitcoin, and it's driving massive amounts of traffic, I'm paying attention.
Sellers seem impotent. Looks like bears blew their loads failing to assault $9,000 and retreated back to Nouriel Roubini's cave for new FUD.

Well fuck. Being out the doom bois the bullruns are delayed even further
Little dumb me posted in the altcoin thread. Long @9150. As chewtoy said resistance gave up on this fifth touch as expected. I am actually proud of myself for finally making a plan and following it.
Sorry for a hypothetical bit of discussion, but let’s say some big players do indeed want to invest in BTC($10 million +), I have a couple of questions: 

- would it be logical to buy avoiding exchanges, like straight from the miners? 
- if the first one is true, what effect would this have in the exchange price? Would it raise the price due to less sell pressure from the miners (assuming miners normally sell their coins on exchanges to cover costs) 
- how do traders keep track of such activity if it doesn’t happen on exchanges? Would it be possible to make a massive buy/sell like this without affecting the market price whatsoever?

I may be getting a bit tired but it seems to me that such activity won’t have a noticeable effect on the market price in the short term. Am I wrong ?
bulls defended 9k pretty well it seems
What do people think of the "shrimpy" thing? I'm thinking of throwing it 5k and setting it up to go mental on shitcoins; but I'd like to hear the best theory of how they could be fucking me over
Anyone else a bit concnerned with the weekly candle crossing ichi cloud the next few weeks?
This is pretty much exact same thing that happened on May 3rd... 

Consolidation in 9050-9175 range

Bump up to consolidate in the 9200-9300 range

Followed by hopefully a large candle to 9450 

So for that reason ( and others ) I added to my long here from $9,040’s at @ $9,270. Expecting a breakup 
So yesterday I said that I thought 9k would hold and fortunately I longed from 9050. Finding the correct exit is now the pickle. I think a retest of 10k is imminent in 3 or 4 days, whether it breaks or not is another matter. However I expect to encounter resistance between here and 9.6k so I will probably close around there and wait for reentry for a new long. 

tl;dr 

This may not be the run to 10k we have been waiting for but I think it probably is. I think we are trading above 10k next week onwards after overcoming resistance at around 9.5k-9.6k. 
30k longs, $200 premium on june futures... We might go up a few hundred, but we're not going to make a new local high anytime soon. Feeling pretty comfortable in my short, unfortunately.   
edit: The past 8 hours we got 1.5k new longs and price has not moved. This is very bearish   
In a downtrend like this you want longs to go down while price is not moving, until then any bounce is going to be a dcb
does anyone else think the [4 hour](https://i.imgur.com/wSJWzOW.png) looks kinda like [this](https://s3.tradingview.com/0/0Hn1Jm3s_mid.png)?
1D Bbands have not beent this tight since Februar 2017 on log scale and since October 2017 on linear scale. I would be really suprised if we break up from this little wedge just to make a new lower high.

\(With the next daily canlde they will tighten a bit more once again if we stay in this range. Afterwards they will not tighten more for some time...\)
Boy this just screams bulltrap. Fiat for now. Careful trading fellas
I still say this gets to at least $10K 

That number is just too important for the bulls to defend even if it goes down right after.
In 2030 when one of your friends, surprised why you're still wagecucking despite having been in btc in 2017/18, asks what happened to all the coins you had, it'll be fascinating to watch you goldfish-people explain how you sold a revolution for some mediocre short-term gains.
Why was 10k so easy to break in February but much harder now?
sold into fiat. def goin bear. 
460 BTC dump on Finex  And looks like a big one on Bitstamp at the same time.
Can you anyone tell me the longs vs. shorts on bitfinex please?

Every time I open [https://www.bfxdata.com/positions/btcusd](https://www.bfxdata.com/positions/btcusd) it crashes.
I'm trying to figure out the next appropriate buy point... Say it break down and dips to 9.1k or if it breaks up above 9.5k? Do either of those point seems like a good R/R assuming it doesn't fall below 9k?
Surprised by this strength and may have to start scaling out of my short before long.  Most of the short is a hedge against my cold storage and alts (mostly alts), which is not an exact hedge, but best I can do.    so I'm not losing that much as the price moves up, but enough.  I'd rather the price be here than at $8000 though.  I would prefer the market rebounds.
There's a few ways to view the current situation, and most have been laid out here already. I have it as an ascending wedge, and I'm wary about the dropping volume rise. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/QXKohCwp/

I'm not looking to get stopped out early, but I moved mine up to 9360 on June futs (about 9200 spot) on my 9385 entry. Whether it's an ascending wedge or an ascending triangle, a move that far is a significant breakdown, and a lower high, and I'll probably want to sit out. 

We'll see what GDAX-less market brings for the next 90 minutes. Hope I don't get needlessly wicked. 
I stopped using Bitcoin for payments a few months ago because of high fees and long confirmations.  I switched to Bitcoin Cash.  But now BTC fees are very low and confirmations are very fast.   BCH fees are even lower (but both are neglible) and BCH transactions are very slow....taking forever.

So I guess I'm switching back to BTC.  And of course this is good for BTC market price if the competition is floundering.

Very disappointing about BCH though and I don't get why the confirms are so slow, because I'm sure there's not much transaction volume.  Maybe the miners left?  I don't get it.
The activity in the altcoin section in this sub should tell something, 3 comments so far today..\^\^
When I woke up this morning to a new low that showed support, and being at the edge of that descending wedge, and at the bottom of our larger channel, I took the quick opportunity to put in a *small* stake.  Good R/R and it'd be easy to know when to bail.

!long xbtm18 9220 5X 21.6%

Was away from computer until lunch just now, and I happened to check just after the breakout.  Told myself I would add if we broke out so:

!long xbtm18 add 9373 21.3%

I'll add more if/when we bounce down for a retest if it's not looking like it'll keep going down.  But this second add already took ca up to the beginning of this breakout so I'd like to keep it there for now.  Will close hopefully near break even if it looks like it can't sustain.

But its on june futures and a little annoying that before I opened the position, the premium had already taken it near the previous low anyway.  But at least this breakout is still scaling up well.

So much for taking a break.

Edit: My first target is 9450, though I'll take 9450 profits on the way down, not with upward wick catching.  Second target will have orders at 10k, third will have orders at 10.225k  (those are spot prices.  position prices are in futs)



Anyone thinking of opening a long here? Or wait for it to go further down??
Long @ $9150. Seem to be hitting support, although previous ones broke I believe this one will not as RSI is at a good level on 4H and even better on lower timeframes. Atleast a small nice bounce is to be expected. Im ready to sell anytime. Also as mentioned previously Bollinger Bands (BBands) are getting tight and all of this leads me to believe there is a better chance at a breakout upwards than downwards. Ive placed my bet, stop loss is currently an undecided mental one. Will sell if the resistance level we are at right now breaks down on higher volume on +4H charts with bearish looking candles.

Anyone else fear that Bitcoin getting official on Wall Street might somehow fuck it up in the long run?
In these time I'll ignore everything and focus on the bollingers: https://imgur.com/a/rU8o3UX

This moves compresses the price even more. It doesn't break us up, neither invalidate a future move to the downside. But price is compressing in the BB range.

I'm taking heat on my short, but not going to start to scale out of it unless we take out $9400 or so.  It's too early to call what kind of bounce this is, but will be become clearer over time.
The market is incredibly awkward right now. 
I'm setting tight stops on my long from 9200 this morning (9160ish). I'm not liking what I'm seeing here:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/h6tDuw9E/

Technically it was opened at 9385 on June futures and I'm setting around 9350 stops. 
Anyone care to explain why so many people think the bear market has ended or is close? Because I sure as hell can't see any compelling reason to believe it's done with us yet.

This has nothing to do with this little drop, I've never believed we left the bear market. If this turns out to be yet another dcb then there are going to be some very painful moments for a lot of people who got on the wrong side of this.


This local downtrend feels bad until you zoom out to the daily.
I measured the highest and lowest point in every step in the successive drops we have seen since 5/6 and it appears that every time, the difference is about $200. It appears as if the price "waits" until it has reached a point $200 above the last recent low. Based on that, I wouldn't be surprised if the next drop happens after price touches $9160. (This is not intended as investment advice, just an observation.)
As much as I don't want to be "possible H&S guy"...

I'm sticking to my reaccumulation theory. 9k has a decent risk/reward ratio for a small long. 

* Close to support 
* falling wedge 
* RSI oversold on many timeframes, 
* 4H RSI as oversold as it was on our 6.4k bottom.

[2H chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Zz8CtsTb/). And a [reference chart for reaccumulation](http://d.stockcharts.com/img/articles/2015/07/1438369533740479636177.png)

Bearish counter-argument on larger timeframe:

* Rejected from horizontal resistance
* Rejected from diagonal resistance
* Bearish divergence on daily RSI
* Hidden bearish divergence on daily RSI and MACD
* Daily and weekly could do with a retrace and still be bullish.

Bed time. Better be safe than sorry.
Was just watching an analyst on Bloomberg talking about where Bitcoin price is headed.  Guy says its either gonna Headfake up - or drop to 3k and he's leaning towards 3k.  Seriously at this point how can anybody believe that's possible.  No TA needed 
Trigger price level reached, now it can drop. Repeat cycle.
I think we're the one pumping it, lol. I told you crypto market was hot in here.

Decision time soon for this bear flag? Looking a lot like our last run up to 10k. 
Closed my short from $9,400 at $9,050 and opened a baby long at @9,046. 

I’m still a bit bearish, and i also probably shouldn’t be trading at 4:30’AM, but I’de like to ride out this long to hopefully $9350-$9550 and possibly re open my short from there depending on the situation. 

Bbands are getting Uber tight on the longer time frames. We are getting close ish to the bottom of wedge and if this thing pops off, i don’t want to miss a low 9k entry like last time. 
Would anyone bet against $10k by Friday?  The only way I'd make that bet is if I had 50K coins to waste on an irrational market dump.
!long xbtusd close 9277

Staying out until we break past 9500 (with my trade stack, still holding my investment stack)
Maybe this is the true log resistance/now support line

https://www.tradingview.com/x/TQWFnUt9/
Is this drop back to under 9300 (hit 9260 now) anything to worry about? I hope it doesn't start going south rapidly again... What are ur thoughts?
The mini rally to 9300 was predictable, but the trend reversal was evident in today's daily chart with the MA20 crossover, so I'm not surprised by what we're seeing now.

Edit: I see on the downvotes the bulls have returned to the sub. 
I see this breakout from the rising wedge as a potential formation of a H&S that will ultimately break us down into the 8's.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/sKxVNdkd/

As I mentioned in other posts I think a potential third fractal (A/B/C/D) is more interesting to look at than likely. But it does show that a move all the way down to retest the old resistance for support and the old support is well within the possibilities so I made a little target potential D zone.


Since I've been posting less of my initial trades and don't think I'll be keeping up with the open positions bot, I hate to post a good trade after the fact but trust that I had plenty of bad ones prior. Closed out my short from 9570 at 9110, put my trading stack from fiat into BTC & ETH, got my sell limit orders filled overnight at 9315, 9355 and a great heavier weighted entry at 9395 that wicked up on Kraken. Closed out my 9315 and 9355 positions for small scalp profit at 9290 but keeping that 9395 open. Will be putting my stack back in fiat at 9500, and looking to add onto my short in layers at 9585 at 9685 depending on price action.

Traders bragging about their new longs should prove it by screenshots or something. How can we know these comments are not 'fake trades' meant to influence other traders?
This might belong in the alt thread but BCH looks like it's reversing (+10-13% in the last 12 hours and still pumping). When alts go up, BTC is usually not too far behind.
Seems like we are trapped between two psychological resistance/support levels. Not brave enough to break 10k but still enough buy pressure to stay above 9k. I'm long from 9050, good luck to all. 

Edit: 

Exited at 9150, no idea where we are going next. Half in Btc and half in fiat.

feels like we have to retest if our wedge res line holds as support.
The previous ascending channel seems to be a significant resistance at around ~9310.  I waited a bit too long to buy back in, so I'm hoping I don't get wrecked now :-) I see Chewy and a bunch in this sub following him into a long, so that gives me some hopium that this is not a DCB. (holding my nuts tight in the meantime)
All we need is three LGDs (little...) between now and Friday, and wave goodbye to four-figured Bitcoin in the rearview mirror. 

Also, if the dumper of the last couple of days borrowed the coins they were dumping, expect a BGD or two in the coming days.
Nah not this time btc. Bulltrap. Ill wait for sub 9k.
I would take Tom Lee's prediction of BTC going up as much as 70% within a week because of the conference with 50 trucks of salt. Remember, this is the guy who has made many wrong predictions in relation to BTC price... Do you trust Tom Lee , or Warren Buffet and Bill Gates, the richest men on earth? One of whom happen to made his fortune in computers... !!

[deleted]
I don't understand the comments sometimes in these dailies.

The general trend has been down for months now and I don't see any reason for that to change, its been a continual slow bleed. 

Interest has died in cryptos, there's no doubt about that, not for good, but far far fewer people show any kind of interest, especially when many new to it were burnt in January/February and beyond.  I don't see them coming back any time soon for round 2.  We'll need that additional money to make any kind of decent and sustainable progress. People cheering a few % gain and shouting recovery, when if you zoom out the picture continues to look pretty bleak. 

I expect we're resetting back to before all the hype, how long we'll take to get there is anyone's guess, back to September prices.

The move we saw a week or so ago just seemed like massive manipulation to generate fomo, which failed, so the trend continues, at least that's how I see it.

Have buys between 9047-8870 closing out from my short in the 9440s yesterday.  Think we will be there tonight.  My overnight buys triggered last night and I was able to sell for a small profit around 9300 earlier today.  If I wake up to the opposite, such is life.  Good luck out there!

Got some spam mail about NEXO and looked into it. Crypto based loans. Actually seemed like a decent business model.

Could this be a better option then a line of credit with a bank? I understand you already have to have the crypto assets of equal value but the idea of having cash for stop gap situations seems solid. The site just went live recently and curious what people think of them or this idea in general.
Longed at 9150 yesterday. Putting a stop at 9250 but expect to close north of 9500, possibly today.

Absolutely killed it again.  Nice trade.  I didn’t get quite as good an exit, but still closed my short in profit.   

I went to bed right after the market fell below 9000, thinking it was gonna continue down.  I had stops set at my break even, maybe I should have moved them down before going to sleep...

woke up to 9200s and was kicking myself.  Still made 20% profit on my stack, but would have been nicer to close where you did and clear 50%.

Nice call again. Any plans for a long entry? You think this falling wedge could break upwards?

Sucks man.  It's so tricky, you set stops and you get wicked before a bull run.  You don't and you get screwed on a bear run.  You see the dip, you think it will turn around, but it keeps going, then at some point you tell yourself you're now a holder and you'll just wait until it comes back....but it doesn't.  You can lose every which way.

Probably setting layered stops is the way to go.

It ain't lost until you sell it.
I think most people are like me and just do not believe we are near the bottom.  Tons of bitcoin is created daily and demand seems to be dropping off.  9k bitcoin is just not an appealing buy to me.  People buy crypto for the chance for exponential short term gains or they are hodlers.  Not many people want to buy and hold 9k bitcoin.  I’m not sure where it goes from here but my gut feeling is down hard before up hard.  So I’m on the sidelines.  If I play it will probably be low stake shitcoins looking for a fairly quick turnaround.  
Spot on! BBands are tightening for a reason; Traders are being pushed out by investors who are making their shorts less profitable. As volatility drops more and more traders will stop placing leveraged bets and it will read like a major decline in interest. If you buy through a period like that then you're a winner long-term.
Ultimately it comes down to fundamentals.  BTC is the least speculative of all cryptos and it has achieved it's purpose better and for longer than anything else out there.  An open-source immutable digital ledger -- something considered impossible in the digital world was for all intents and purposes impossible until BTC arrived (by virtue of how difficult and costly it would be to compromise BTC with a 51% attack; digital permanence (the ledger is completely trust-able and has complete integrity or it cannot exist) and scarcity is BTCs value proposition.  
the tech is promising, but its 10 years out.  between now and then some other 'hotspot' will appear and people will move their money into the new hotspot to chase those gains.. not because they think bitcoin sucks.
That's when the price collapses.. thats when value investors should be making their large 'set it and forget it' purchases.  That kind of investor wont be some young asian gambler bullwhaling in with a 10,000 bitcoin buy before heads off to macau's bacarrat tables.





I've got the bear goggles on and am expecting it to hit $9.5 then retrace thus confirming the head and shoulder pattern I have drawn. 

A panic sell and price suppression to hit $8.8k or lower for us to accumulate and set a good base for some upwards momentum post-consensus.
Both with 2 points of contact. Coin flip.
That's correct. 
lol, I just tipped the same comment \(see above\) before I read yours.
Great post! Very thorough analysis, and I agree.
I agree on bullish.  Institutions are coming for a reason.  Crypto is completely uncorrelated to other investment classes.  Institutions are already sold on other noncorrelated assets such as managed futures, hedge funds, Real Estate etc, they can't wait for crypto because it is one more thing they can invest a small portionin that not only enhances return but reduces volatility  in their overall portfolio.  They alone could push BTC easily past 100k. Just waiting for regulatory clarity. 
While I really like the positive sentiments, I feel like it's still much too early to suggest an A&E.  Every dip we take still takes us to a psychological low where we fear the rug may be pulled.  I don't really want to point out any old FUDs, but there are still concerns.  It would be nice to believe that we are going to make a new ATH within a reasonable time frame, but I'd also like to consider possibilities where the unfavorable outcome could play out.  I'm on the bull boat since I only make money on the way up, but I still feel the burn from the earlier months of this year.
> Is this the beginning, or the beginning of the end?

Now, this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.

The truth of the matter is that retail buys/sellers like us are no longer a big part of price movement the way we were in the very early years. Even in the run up from 10-20k, that was driven by big money running in quickly. Low liquidity amplified the institutional buys, retail investors' were just riding coattails, a layer of topping. No one likes to call themselves, even collectively, "small", but if you think retail buyers/sellers are in the driver's seat you're only going to make small money sporadically. 

If you really look into volume you'll see that retail investors' are on the sidelines, timidly coming back near the top of ranges, but only after they've been fomo-stoked by the chart-painting institutions. With this in mind, we can best protect ourselves by hoping for the best but planning for the worst. We have to ask ourselves the contrarian case: what if the whales are setting this up to burn as many new investors as possible? Draw them in with the recovery/buy the dip story then crash it to $2500. 

Why? My guess is so there will be as few buyers as possible during the ultimate accumulation in preparation for the moon. Why would institutions risk/settle 10x from 10k to 100k, when they have the ability to crash it to 2k, accumulate, then easily get us back to 20k for the same 10x return? If we go to 100k, that's 50x. 

But the retail investors' will be too burned to return you say. True, but as of today, only a minority of the public. If you burn grandma, people may never trust crypto. But those being "sacrificed" are mostly early adopters. We know the risk, risk is preached everywhere, and we're the risky gambling type who once we're back to 20k, 30k, 40k, will find it irresistible to fomo back in once again. 
Well done
Really good to link the current price action and behaviour to the potential A&E nearing validation. Let's hope you're right! 
this is good shit right here
Someone just watched crypto daily haha what did the article even say? Bullish bearish or neutral tone?
It takes a couple of days now to buy bitcoin from scratch. (Including learning the process, registering on exchanges, finding real buyers, organizing storage etc.) 

Things like this will likely have a positive effect but you shouldn’t forget that 9k is still a very high price level for BTC. Not so long ago 10k was considered moon. Not long before that 2k. It will take significant new buyer pressure (if we only consider that) to move it to new ATH.
I don't know what effect it will have on price because there are so many other factors pushing and pulling the price in both directions. 

I think we can all agree that a positive bitcoin article on the front page of the NYT about how Bitcoin trading is coming to Wall Street will certainly increase the perceived legitimacy of bitcoin which is very important.
can we all agree that bitcoin does, indeed, have a use case *right now*? 
Up to you. 

Matter of patience and it will be 10K.

Moonmath.win (or /u/jarederaj 's rainbow charts) are exactly this, just with the channels drawn slightly differently (the bubbles protruding out of the channel). I don't know if I consider that a good or bad way to look at it but it's at least a point of reference that I have referred back to many times.
I use the bitstampp+gox  version. Less scary.
Have you seen this?

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/pmV1uLC7-Bitcoin-Longterm-update/
the bottom line could be drawn in multiple ways. The top one has only two points. will need more points to confirm the channels.

no i don't think it is relevant.
I've been looking at this chart for a long time.  If it plays out the same way it will take us all the way down to the 200 sma line like it did in 2014 putting us at around 4k in December.   

The biggest red flag for me isn't the chart but the continued decline in daily volume.  I don't expect the google trends graph to start moving back up until we hit ATH again but its hard to believe we're on a the next bull run when the average volume isn't growing.
Looks like a yuge C&H
Interesting. I do have this one on my chart, though (assuming blow-off Dec top and oversold Feb bottom): https://www.tradingview.com/x/GcaCwXtT/
I don't see the problem! As long as we are above support, it's bull! 
Even if Bitcoin drops to 2k we are bull!

Use an index on Trading View instead of the Bitfinex data for charts where you need to go back this far. It will include the data going back to 2011.

It will allow you to draw a channel similar to this:

If by "terrifying" you mean "delicious", then yes it's absolutely terrifying.
I suspect many have charted this and even the infamous rainbow charts show a similar story.

My take was, if we test support, it won't be until late this year or early next year.  If it holds, the next climb to the resistance line will be a hell of a trip
I have absolutely no clue. It really speaks to the level of intelligence of the general cryptosphere and traders in general. 
> they are almost always always wrong

good. that's how you make money.
* They are sock puppet accounts for manipulating market psychology. Their only mission is to manipulate clueless retail investors/speculators into taking the wrong side of the trade, and make them lose money.

* They have a high number of followers, but we cannot actually see the list of their followers, meaning someone can create 15000 accounts on TV and just start following these accounts to make them seem "popular".
> Why do they have such large followings???

People like being told what to do.
Maybe they predict wrong and take the opposite trades? Some of the top accounts look like they're the same person. 
Only one of the top three is worth listening to IMO, other two are arrogant and irritating, not to mention wrong.
Could anyone recommend who to follow? Is there any them who sound reasonable?
And it makes you wonder, if these guys are trading their own 'ideas', should they not be broke by now?  
Anyway maybe they have no balls for trading. One thing is to analyse, another is to pull the trigger.
You used xbt/usd to open the position so you must used it again to close it.
On the next one you can use xbtusd to keep it simple.
i am scared that if we break trough 9k we might just break lower.
There is not much room on the upside, the resistance is to strong at 10k. Best scenario is we hoover in this area for quite some time and then move slowly into higher highs
yeouch that must hurt. 
more liquidity is in Euro volume in $ is low
good info, I missed that, thanks

Cool
That's precisely what they're for, and you should be grateful they're there. Even if it can be frustrating that the only way to get into a position quickly is to market buy/sell.

Market makers provide liquidity to the orderbook by placing large limit buy and sell orders close together. They don't particularly care which direction the market moves, because they are constantly resetting their orders up and down. 

Bitmex incentivizes this practice by paying the market maker .025% whenever somebody market buys/sells into one of their limit orders. 

So if somebody buys 1.5m contracts at $9265 and somebody else sells 1.5m contracts at $9264.5 a few minutes later, the market maker goes out and buys more than a few Tuna Subs with his profits. 

Since he's doing this constantly, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, he's pretty much guaranteed to make money regardless of which direction the market moves.

So why should you be happy he's there?

Because if he wasn't, the orderbook would be a ghost town. And you'd wind up paying a whole lot more to enter a sizable position (in the form of slippage) than the fees you pay by placing market orders.
You realize those walls get pulled all the time. Put your limit order in and go for a walk. It’ll get filled. I hve learned it’s never the bottom or the top. Just gotta wait a little bit
I tend to choose always positions that will end up in the apex of the patterns. I FOMO'd @9250 after hesitating (and checking the bot logs for errors) at 9200. So this will go on a while before going down.
If it does i might just close my eyes and remove my stop loss or move it bellow 8800. At least then if i get stopped i go out in flames...
Flip a coin.  Historically speaking this could break up or down.  Just takes some news usually.
For your initial question.... no.... I believe the rest market will follow Finex wherever it goes for now. 

Here's something I like to watch and find far more useful than an order book... 

https://trading.gear54.me/tradeflow/

This will track all market buys/sells for a given period of time and give you an idea of what the market makers are up to.
imo this will be more helpful than any other order book:

Do you agree thay given the small inverse bart yesterday at 9000-9200 and the current breakout, that sellers are exhausted. The fact that they couldnt push it below 9k, is good news. 

9200 is currently providing some resistance, and unless we break it today, we will dip below 9k over the long weekend?

EDIt: 9200 fell, good news for the bulls. If we can hold above, then I’ll be changing my tune. 10k can take it’s time, Im in no rush
You know what, I'm getting really annoyed by this.

Buyers pushed from 9k, broke the resistance and disappeared like on yesterday's drop... Was expecting at least 9.3 on that move...
It looks like you're putting a lot of value on the apparent pressure from buyers/sellers, and doing so successfully. It occurs to me that since we have the trade histories those could be aggregated to an indicator showing the relative degree of market buys/sells over time. The amount of sells vs buys is of course already aggregated in the actual price movements and volume. But this indicator might possibly indicate peaks and bottoms before they hit. Throw a 7-14-21 "moving average" on top and it might do very well. Time to do some backtesting!
You really have a great feeling for this market, is it like a spider sense at this point?

What's the importance/significance in testing and confirming the line in your opinion? Why even the need to go and test it? The line slowly becomes obsolete anyways given how steep it is (and just the general nature of negative sloping diagonal lines), wouldn't we just want to stay away from it at this point?
It's just a line people drew on internet and became a self-fullfilling prophecy. Pros are in control now, not retail "ta experts" and they use other indicators I believe, pivots etc. The further we get, the less relevant it is, wether you'd like it retested or not. Globally, diagonal lines have poor performance records, many are violated left and right up and down invalidating them, and at any point you can draw one from point a to point b, to fit your narrative, there's an infinity of diagonals. Sorry.
Think 8800/8100 will hold at least for a first bounce. Down to 7500 is a big jump from here, we probably have a parachute at above support levels.
It's been off for like 5 years now lol
Resistance between 9300-9400 gonna be a bitch 
CoB?
Kraken doesn't have margin to lend. You must go without leverage if you want or wait until some margin is returned.
Kraken fixed their engine. And only the engine. All other irritating things are still on, that's why I'm not even thinking about getting back to them.
Looks like we're right below the 50MA on the 4h.

(which has been acting as good support/resistance since that initial big green candle.)

50MA is right around $9,400.

 
Why should it break through and stay above 9.3K ? 
Oh, we will blast through $9.3 and leave it in the dust soon enough.  

You know how I know? I just said, "Eff it" and removed my $9.15 buy order because, well, math says this is going up (dumps getting weeeeeaaak and pumps getting stroooong when you tally it up).  Should have bought three weeks ago but waited too long for the dip that never came.  Oh wellz.

Anyway, don't worry.  we will leave $9.3 (and the four digit pricings) behind shortly.  Maybe two more days of attempted weak dumps, then it's off to the races.  This latest dude is running out of coins to sell at a loss.
Widening the road for all the new residents.
If I never changed my mind, I'd still be short from $232. 

I was short because the market was in a steady decline and showed no signs of bottoming out. I closed this morning and opened a long when buyers materialized at $9,000. 

TA is nothing more than, since x is currently happening, y will probably follow. Unless of course z happens instead. 

In the current market, x was "breaking down below $9,250" and y was "breaking below support at $8,800, to head potentially as low as the mid $7,000s."

Z was the market bouncing off of $9,000 and pulling back above $9,250. 
Most reddit "traders" pretend that they sold the top and bought the bottom of every move, even if they are actually getting slaughtered.
Maybe they were different people?
TA changes so quick because there are support and resistance lines that create narratives. If any of these lines break, a different narrative becomes more probable.
Still bearish, not calling sub 8k tho. But you know things change quickly depending on what TA you use. For me if we get above 9.4k and close that way things are looking a lot less bearish.
Well it certainly could have been very nasty if it did fall below 8.8k and couldn't bounce back. In that case we could have dropped down to 7.5k where long term support is. But seeing as now it has held well on 9k and we're finally getting a nice bounce, it's safe to say we will probably try and break 10k again.
I can confirm there is TA of every variety and pointing in all sorts of directions. Probably because it is not a scientific method and a lot depends on the person doing the TA, experience, insight or something. 
TA is largely worthless in this market.  A few simple things matter like rounded bottoms and tops.  Fundamental analysis is the only thing that matters, and fundamentally, demand far exceeds supply over time.  We're making another run at $10K soon.
I think a lot of it had to do with action in the past few hours. drops become smaller, less BTC being sold, and just now the downtrend was broken. Trading isn't like having to stick to a particular belief but adjusting to circumstances. 
Maybe the difference between yesterday and today is that yesterday there were no buyers and today we see they suddenly appeared at 9k and are pushing hard so that it won't drop that low?
TA = trolls analysis
They’re getting ready for Consensus 2018. 
This was the case for the April bull run as well. Btc was always laying behind. It's quite a change compared to last year. 
That’s the exact same Wyckoff figure I shared a couple days ago. I’m not super familiar with the topic either, but it’s been looking suspiciously similar for days.
My only Wyckoff Logic is to do it when nobody's home.
Looks very similar. 

Are there targets for the phases? 

I tried looking online but couldn't find anything. 
I don't believe our accumulation phase will have only lasted 2 weeks.

IMO looking at Wyckoff on this TF is too small. 

This is why some including myself think that this will be a ranging market for the next 1-2 years. 

Accumulation will essentially continue until new ATHs are made... until then it is all accumulation. 

Look at beginning 2014- end 2016. 

We did not reach failed rally until the second try at 20k from accumulation range sub 1k.

So that leaves us with two options:

A: We have reached a spring level and will continue ranging.

B: We are still in distribution/markdown phase and have not even reached our accumulation trading range at this point. 




I've been looking at the Wyckoff stuff as well as some of it has been thrown around on this forum.  If I recall correctly u/RedFountain posted some stuff a few days ago and suggested we're not in a distribution but re-accumulation phase before the push to $11.7k

As for the distinction between accumulation and distribution? This may be one of those things that can only be labeled correctly in retrospect...
this was also my conclusion - how far up does the DCB go?  Farther than most bears think.  Probably fibo line 9600ish.  But you see shorts jumping in not even giving the bulls a chance to come off that falling wedge and a big oversold drop.

Here's the guy who bought the bottom btw: 
https://www.bitcoinmarketinsider.com/cai-wensheng-warns-against-mining-and-ico-bans/

When the bear gets his claws in him do you think he'll hodl? or squeal? you make the call.









I’m more in line with your second edit, i.e. re-accumulation between 8.6-10k. I have posted a bit about this in the past weeks: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8g5owl/comment/dy9jzy0

But that said, I don’t think the market have decided yet if we are in re-accumulation or distribution.

I can currently see bullish signs on medium timeframes (higher lows, hidden bull divs etc), which would indicate that we’re in re-accumulation.

And I haven’t yet seen a failed breakout which is an indicator of the distribution phase. Sure, we failed to hold a higher high after testing 9.8k. But I wouldn’t consider that a “failed breakout” until we truly fail holding 10k.

Another sign of the distribution phase would be a lower high sometime soon (maybe 9.5-9.8). Then I’ll at least consider a short position.
yop with 300 BTC volume so far. That was the easy part of the break out so far...

nouriel roubini is a master investor.  he is worth over one MEEEELION dollars.

And i'm looking for a new short entry. Good luck!
If you ask why: Look at the last 2 4h candles and the volume. Spoofy is trying hard right now with a big buywall, but there are no buyers at all.
Oh it's not hypothetical, there are plenty of people who are investing at those levels. Over the Counter (OTC) is where this stuff goes down. Circle does about $2 Billion a month in OTC:

https://www.circletrade.com/en/
$10 million wouldn't have much of an impact nowadays. Exchanges do $7-10 billion a day. But buying quietly OTC would be the way to go unless you were strategically trying to bump the price up or prevent it from falling. Personally, I'd buy into the big dumps just to fuck with the dummies doing that.
>would it be logical to buy avoiding exchanges...

Yes. Slippage is a real thing when dealing with amounts that big, and they can likely strike a deal at the same or lower than market without incurring exchange fees.

>if the first one is true, what effect would this have in the exchange price?

Like you said, the price would slowly rise due to lower sell pressure.

>how to traders keep track of such activity if it doesn't happen on exchanges?

You can't as far as i'm aware, outside of having some level of insider knowledge by being involved with either transacting party.
There is also the splitting it up across multiple exchanges method.  If you do that, and also cost-average over a couple days - it won't have that much impact.
1. If you buy OTC, you’re not buying on an exchange, so you’re not contributing to the buy pressure

2. If you buy 10M on an exchange, price goes up

3. The coins you buy OTC would be sold on an exchange if no one was going to buy them OTC, so you are taking sell pressure away

4. Some OTC desks will buy the coins back on an exchange as soon as they’re sold to you, this is more of a brokerage than an OTC trade. In this case, it makes no difference whether you buy or they buy

All-in-all the price is relatively unaffected by OTC desks until the people who bought the coins start dumping them 
More physiological support. 

From our previous dips, 9k has served as a weak support zone, generally bounced off 1-3 times then eaten away for a further plummet. 
For now.  It was due for a bounce and they won that little skirmish but probably some more battles soon.
i like how the bears were expecting a long squeeze but were tricked and none got liquidated(on finex) bears will dig more(8.8k) for treasure hunt?
go on...
What on Earth is the shrimpy thing?
Looks like HODLBot, except it's free and has a few extra options.
so by the looks of it, it just buys and sells your coins and re distributes them into coins that are pumping, then once they are done it sells and re balances back into your original profile ? 
what would that mean?
Told you it looked like 1st of May! 
glad you were able to get those buys through in Kraken ;)
Agreed... I'm still long from yesterday's slightly premature position.. have a take profit setup at $9440
I have the same entry and don't plan to try and time the market within my sleep, that will most likely end-up in re-entering higher +fees. I'll set a stop profit before going to bed and adjust it as it goes up (or not)
Thought your original text was concise enough. TL:DR seemed unnecessary. Just sayin. 
I think the shorts and longs values on bfx are given waaay too much attention. 
It seems that every time longs starts to rise everyone thinks a big long squeeze will come and vice versa. 

In reality a real long/short squeeze is a rare event that takes the whole market by surprise.   The fact that you and, well anyone who has access to TradingView, can expect it, pretty much nullifies it. 

If this was so simple there’d be as many shorts opened as longs to make profit on the impending squeeze. 

Also bfx isn’t the only exchange.

You need a bigger picture man I can't see that small
Just looks like a tree line against the sky to me.
Narrow BBands aside, today the price crossed decisively below the 20D MA; usually a clear indication of a trend reversal to the downside.
of course if we broke down... the drop could be pretty damn big in that case
It'll be interesting as for me it would confirm either a new bull trend or continuation of the bear trend. During last year bull run tight bands seemingly almost always broke up, Q1 this year during the bear run they always broke down.  
only way to know is to wait and see if it's goes back into the wedge
Or maybe the drop was a bear trap? There's as much reason for the rise as the drop. It's only a bull trap if the drop afterwards is sustained and long lived. If you think we need to drop further to say 8800 or 8500 before climbing higher it's not a trap.
you can also ride a bulltrap a bit ;\)
It can hardly be called a trap when there have been so many warning signs already.
is it low volume that you are referring to? gradual increase in price is activating my FOMO gradually
12k is much more important as it will confirm an adam eve bottom which is a reversal signal

Okay, I'm far from an expert in the market, but here is my take. If you remember the daily dump in March, I think it may be money systematically leaving the market after the double top was confirmed.  It will probably take some time to win back trust and interest after we hit 6k a second time.  We did break out of the ATH down trend and defended some key levels since then, so I am gaining back some confidence in the market.  No one knows where it is going man, but I guess we'll see.
The next wave on global interest hasn't yet begun.
Momentum, leverage, and a good dose of hopium.
Same as 9k. Vegetta got raped by kobayashi, since then 9k showed timid resistance either up or down.
if you find fools, you better raise your price as much as possible. if you are patient, then you get the deal. the last bullrun was patient people selling to careless fomoers.
Why do you say that?
Good good, going long here with stop below 8.8, 1H bull div indicates local bottom.

Dan from the ChartGuys.com on YouTube today gave a really nice explanation on how he expects the next week or so to go, would recommend the 10 min watch.

If you don't have time, absent news from consensus, Up, Down (H&S to high 8's), tighten, likely Up on bullish break of weekly higher lows. If news comes from consensus, well then, you know.
The lower-risk zone for entering a position is temporarily gone I’m afraid. Between 9.3-9.8k is what I personally would consider a no-trade zone. Sure, there certainly higher potential reward by entering below 9.4-9.5 but also a lot higher risk.

While trying to avoid hindsight bias, an entry at the top of the double 12h Ichimoku cloud was always going to be low risk/high reward entry. That was around 9-9.1k.

Scaling in below 9.3k down to 9k might not be a bad idea. On the upside, I would probably wait for strong confirmation of 9.8k, or a convincing break of 10k before entering a low risk/high reward trade.

Edit: looking at my saved charts again, I actually had the range 9.2-9.8 marked as “no trade”.

I already opened one at 8,995. I think the RSI is oversold in all charts. Plus, there is not much room to go below from here, may be we will touch 8,800 and go even lower, or may be not! 

!long XBTUSD 8995 3.3X 100%
Ide probably start scaling in small with buys all the way down to $8,800.

With stops below $8650. 


You can’t fuck up Bitcoin. You can only fuck up the market where Bitcoins are traded on centralized databases
In what sense?
This is not going to come about for some time. It's not easy setting up a trading desk, that too of the magnitude in which wall street would be playing in. Having said that, when it does start, it will ensue a snowball effect of institutional investments, regulations and ultimately audit. At that moment, we will truly see Bitcoin's fair value. Reduced volatility, reduced risk, consistency in growth and easier adoption. Until then enjoy the arena, gladiators
I imagine it would cause a bit of price suppression with all the shorting and manipulation in the short term but more liquidity and less volatility long term. I'll probably stop trading and just hold some if volatility drops off too much, it's a big boys game at that point.
Bit of a pessimist? I am too, I tend to think up worst-case scenario type things in my head and worry about them. But for some reason on this topic, I can’t really be very pessimistic. 
Would Bbands are tight on the one day trigger something as large as our biggest BGD? 

Minus the fact that there was 40,000 shorts open 
We have t started really moving down yet though, probably best to wait for at least a second touch. 
On Bitfinex that line is around 9600 now. 
Diagonal lines like the one you've drawn feel to me like coincidences at best. There are other ways you could draw it, making it pretty subjective, compared to a tried\-and\-tested longer term diagonal trendline or a horizontal trendline with clear history at that level.
just wait until it hits puberty 
Hmm?  Seems normal to me.  Range bound on multiple time scales and different people being bipolar about whichever range they are trading against as it ping pongs.  *shrug*
Makes me want to close my long right now and open a short.

May do so 

Edit: Keeping long open, Reduced position size by 30% 
With that second touch @9375 it's starting to look like a ascending triangle, with 2 touches on the upper bound and 2 on the support.
But can go either way...
Would you mind explaining to this noob what's the problem with that ascending triangle? The way I see it that we are making higher lows which is a good thing, isn't it?
Multiple reasons, breaking out of the falling wedge from 20k, adam and eve double bottom, bullish news for crypto in general, the fact that the bear market lasted 5 months, which is 5 years in crypto, alts going parabolic. I agree that this may be a DCB but claiming there is no reason for the bear market to end is just wrong, there are plenty of reasons, we will find out soon enough if its really over.
self fulfulling: if that many people think the bear market has ended, it ended effectively. 
Bitcoin was back on the front page of the NYT today. It was on Silicon Valley 2 days ago. People are starting to get interested again. There are an absurd amount of bullish qualitative indicators for the market in general. Every day Bitcoin is around it gains more credibility and publicity. More people know about it. I do not have enough time to explain why I switched from bearish to bullish about a month ago, but look at the media and the light bitcoin is now being portrayed in and you might find your answers. 


Yeah I could be wrong, but that is life. BULLISH 
Look at the charts of the end of a bear market/bubble pop. You will ask yourself, how the fuck did the price stayed that low for such a long time, well its because most people got trapped in dcb and short squeezes and have no more money to buy the real bottom. 


The daily feels bad because it's continuous red candles. 
10% is 10% is 10%.   It's bad compared to 1%, it isn't bad compared to 50%.   

If you just lost 10% of your money, then it's bad.
when such a pattern becomes that obvious it often changes and rekt those who trade on it. ;\)
I'm seeing the pattern as well. Thinking we go down quite a bit more. Buyers seem to want 8800, 8700 maybe even lower. 
More prone to keep an eye on the descending line even if, it suggests your price point:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/peqcx0kfc8xamo0/Finex%20-%20BTCUSD%20-%2020180509.PNG?dl=0

RSI should go near 50/51 which is has been a support turned  resistance so far.
I was thinking the same as well, so many up and down pumps to near that 10k round nr, and then a linear scale out on 1d scale. 

On the positive side, at least it's not a giant red dildo. 
You could also say there’s a possible H&S forming on hourly-4H

>4H RSI as oversold as it was on our 6.4k bottom.

Well the first time we hit 6.4k the 4h RSI was 22, now the 4h RSI is 39 and was 33 at its lowest point.
Upvoted for visibility - there are downvote bots and salty downvoters everywhere, it’s a shame. Agree with the reaccumulation (said this yesterday too). 
I think we will see $8800, and lower. These recoveries are too fast and sharp, and volume just isn't there to support a long trend for this price range. I have been wrong before, though.
I think! Moreover, what I sense is that the traders that are out since the failed attempt to breach 10K are going to jump in and buy now. It is a good price range, and from here if we go up, I think it might be easier next time to breach 10K

Seems like a strange time to close a long, at a bull flag that came out of a falling wedge and off the bottom of a multi-day ascending channel, loaded with bullish divergences.  Sort of a bombardment of confluence of signals here that say stay long for short term.

“lines” are just that, lines on a chart.

The real question is whether the support price p\_t where people at time t feel uncomfortable selling below p\_t is decreasing or increasing.

Based on the movement to date, we dumped to 8700+ a few times since we broke 8500 with conviction. Currently it seems as though sellers abandon their posts sub 9k, and only time will tel whether that is the case.

Overall, I think horizontal support lines are far more important until we get below 8700 again
It's likely that some form of retrace will happen ( is happening) to determine some sort of channel in which it would climb again. 

However, there is also a chance that this was a DCB and we keep going down... nobody knows, but I wouldn't get worried until our (arbitrary) support line at 9k gets broken. 

Chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/XpDMYdh9/

It's been wicked on our rapid descent from our extreme run-up to 9.75k, but I'm thinking that might've been a blow-off bottom as support hadn't developed yet.
whats more likely breaking 10k or breaking 8500?

It seems to be holding 9.3k really well.  My entry today was just below here, so it feels like it hasn't moved all day.  I'm hoping that it dips just a bit so I can add around 9.1k range, or maybe sell and stay out if we get another quick pump.
Looks like its going down (about to break 9250 now) which I thought was a key point... Any chance of bouncing back from here?
where to you see it continue to? i opened a short at 9300. Wondering if the retracement is temporary?

I'm a little surprised by the short call after 899x was rejected so summarily and the futures premium returned. Still, short from right here makes at least as much sense as long from right here. We just punched though the next layer of resistance pretty confidently, though.
* Invalid leverage: must be between 0 and 100


Welcome to your own club mate. :) Good to see you on the list. Cheers!
This is dumb. Screenshots are easily faked anyway. If someone wants to say they're long from 9300 right now when they aren't, then fine. If someone else opens a long based off that alone, they shouldn't be trading anyway.

What traders should get called out for is posting "long from 9100" right now. That's just malarkey. 
Who gives a shit?  If you are blindly following trades you're fucked in any case.
TBH, if i were you i could care less about the position of most traders here. Most of the daily is absolutely biased and most of the trades are hindsight ones. There are howevere few gems (few traders) i take into acccount but you can easily spot them: trades are always declared and quoted upon opening/closing, trades are always motivated, there is continuity in their moves.

Already a history of people posting fake screenshots (perhaps you know who I'm talking about). It's not hard to edit a few fields on MEX or BFX to fudge the numbers. Luckily, the person who was doing this doesn't seem to post here much anymore after I made a big scene about it.
> How can we know these comments are not 'fake trades' meant to influence other traders?

To say this is to suggest a significant number of people claim fake trades which I find hard to believe.

You don't know.  And it really doesn't matter that much, either way.

There is certainly a good bit of astroturfing and such going on at times, but you can figure out who some of the genuine posters are and just ignore the noise in here as best you can.
On looking now it's on its way down.
lets see if we stay over 9k..
the last bounce from 9k was weak.
I see more lack of selling pressure than buying pressure. If you have a look at the daily MACD it's quite evident. Buying momentum dried up at the end of april. Selling pressure is being built although the market is not rushing at all to take profits.
Said the bear 
I'm seeing a bull flag developing on smaller timeframes which I'm expecting to go towards 9220 then another pole up with a target at 9350-9370. If we get past that it'll get interesting. 
Just bounced off 9250 though
Now is a very risky spot to open a long. There's likely to be a retest of the the former channel resistance in the $9100 area. 

However, there's a fairly decent chance that the market will forego that retest and just continue pushing up. 

I'm quite happy with my entry at around $9,140. If you are comfortable with a small degree of risk, then opening a long here is fine. But if you'd panic close with a 2% drop from there (very possible), then you might want to wait for said drop before opening.
We had like 4 failed attempts to break 9k, one get lower but didn't hold and this push up broke resistance. This may still fail, but r/r is good enough to try it.
Still don't like this outlook. 

If you only care about short term price, well, "ok".

If you care about bitcoin price to hold in the future you would prefer changes in the fundamentals (for the good) and organic movements rather than sudden green candles triggerd by stop hunting or huge market buys. 10k end of week (but also end of this month) is still A LOT inflated.
Consensus is coming up, so anything is possible
You either won't get that opportunity in the near future, or you will and you'll wish you hadn't. 

If the market drops below $8,600, then there's a fair amount of room to fall until there's likely to be support. As low as $7,300 (and perhaps lower depending on how long it takes the market to get there in that hypothetical scenario).

Alternatively, if the market keeps pressing onward past $10,000 and establishes $9,800 to $10,000 as strong support. Then there's pretty much thin air between $10,000 and $11,700. 
Rejected hard from 9.4k, but establishing 9.3k as support (for now).  I say we are still looking okay if we consolidate here for a bit then go up.
Lol just because you sold into fiat doesn’t mean you need to spam lame bear comments
Classic either or fallacy. It's just fine to ignore all these people.

None of them really know.  Tons of people have tried to predict what bitcoin will do so over time some of them will be right occasionally.  People tend to remember opinions they agree with or like way more than opposite views.  Anyway play safe with this shit.
I agree in part, but what exactly does Bill Gates earning his fortune making computer software have anything to do with his ability to gauge the monetary value of an assett?
> Do you trust Tom Lee , or Warren Buffet and Bill Gates, the richest men on earth?

One is making market projections based on analysis of market conditions.

The other are just bashing a technology/alternative economic system they either don't understand (Buffet/Munger) or they don't agree with.

The comparison is absurd.


Bill Gates thinks a box of rice-a-roni costs $10. 
He and Buffet should be put out to pasture to graze on their leafy greens. 
Speculation: Tom Lee has insider information. There are at least 10 secret "Industry Announcements" scheduled for Consensus 2018. Perhaps one or more of these is significant enough to make headline news and drive positive action.

Can't wait. I'll be flying into NYC Sunday and plan on filing numerous reports for everyone here.
Is it possible to see how many shorts are underwater and what price they opened at?
bch miners are stuck with 100kbch illiquid wallets. If any of them moves a coin, bcash will lietraly become btrash.

Also latest bug proved it was less secure, has less dev/review. The way they fixed the bug showed how it is centralized af. 

They relied on good sammaritans to report a fatal bug. I guess big investors like their $ to be at the mercy of good sammaritans
Lmao, right... The coin that is barely processing 100 Kb blocks and has abysmal volume is in the driver seat of the crypto market. 

Yeah, totally plausible. It's not like it could possibly be pumping because of fork hype (for an upgrade that is entirely unnecessary, given that, again, blocks are about 70 or 80 Kb on average).

Lmao, BCashers say the darnest things.
Need to see more substance in posts like this. Show evidence and reason. Unsupported claims get reported for violating Rule 3, and I'll enforce that when I see it. Mentioning BCH this way makes it two violations in one sentence.
Dammit... You can do better than this. I agree with you, but I can't agree with the way you've decided to communicate about this.
Why?  Perhaps somebody wants higher r/r.
I dont hold any bitcoin because i dont have enough capital for me to make such a low risk investment. But when i make enough, BTC will absolutely be one of my first holdings that i will add to
Numbers don't agree with you. 
Are you in a debate team?
This is like a college research paper, how did you have the time to write this on Reddit lol
congrats! Profilic.
Honestly, if you've been out for months it would probably be better at this point to wait for a clear signal of direction. Right now is not even remotely clear. 
if you're planning on holding long term I don't see why not. Just add more on the way down to $6k if we somehow manage to get down there. sell below $5.8k. a triple bottom at $6k would be insanely bullish. so you really only have to worry about a $3k/btc loss. Unless you plan on adding lower. 

If you really think this is going to a new ATH missing the bottom by a few thousand isn't a big deal

of course no one can tell you when to buy. the only time it will be a great time to buy is when everyone is screaming that it's an awful time to buy
I would have said the general trend has been fairly positive over the last month
Full time cypto dev counts & dev funding have never been higher. Focus on leading indicators.

No one can predict where on-boarding virality will surface in this space. (i.e. no one predicted CryptoKitties' global interest)
I know from personal experience that a lot of those who got burned in Jan and Feb never left and are still holding. You can confirm this by checking the alt subs. Many DCA down or just held and excited to finally begin to see a ray of light. Those people are definitely not selling now for a loss now. Greed got them into crypto in the first place and greed will keep them in. Besides general sentiment is up regardless if we're out of the woods or not.
Not only is there no fomo while we go up.  I think there are still a ton of people underwater from 10K to 20K.  Once we hit their number they will sell to breakeven to never come back.  It's going to take something like China legalizing exchanges again to reach a new ATH.
Not to cause any alarm but peple should be very worried right now. One of acquantenances says that the SEC will likely clamp down on Ether next week. After ETH is canceled then the government will be forced to go after the rest of the top shitcoins like XMR, LTC, XVG, and ETN. XRP will be allowed to bleed and bleed. This should give Jed and Mike time to coordinate the pumps, cause FOMO, and ditch their bags right before they get shut down aswell.



I mean objectively Bitsoin is worth more than a couple hundred dollars. But it cannot be more than a few thousand. Nobody understands this but each one of my valuation models is in agreement. According to my spreadsheet, the current value of 1 Bitcoin is approxmiately $4500. 


I doubt very much that the FOMOing noobs or Butmex casino employees have a traditional finance background. Thats why they can't see the truth right in front of their faces. The writing pepe is on the wall. 


Warren Buffet said crypto hodlers are "worse than rat poisoning" and now Bill Gats is shorting this shit to the ground. I'm laddering my limit buys from $3800 down to $2375. I can't wait to see when the "greater fool" will lose their nerve and reverse FOMO dump their coins into me.

Really cool life man. But yeah... we don't really care.

You're supposed to add some arguments, explain why or what. Not just telling us you ate pasta and drank a beer.
i dont get ur chart. base on that small H&S u predict a 2k drop? 
You expect to hit 8870 tonight? 
What technical factors.


Dont you ever get tired?? FUD FUD FUD
>other technical factors

Please elaborate. Double top (not confirmed yet)?
Why are there so many glory hunters on this sub? When they make a prediction and it goes right they immediately want praise for making the call. When it goes wrong it's total silence.
You gave no justification, and it's kind of the breaking point(to the down)price for the market. 
Noone cares about your hunches mate. Put some arguments and reasoning behind it or it's just noise, whether you're right or wrong.
>Yeah true, I forgot that you only get upvoted for saying moon in this sub.

Probably because it's a horseshit assertion.

Also, you edited your comment, what did it say before you edited it?
Interesting.. so do you think we have had that healthy correction and should be on our way back up now. Or expect further correction till 8800 or below?
>Crypto based loans

Ah yes, the first way I lost half my savings. 
Ok, judging by the downvotes people don't like the idea of loans or lines of credit. Not sure how asking for an opinion warrents downvotes but hey., this is Reddit, and Crypto so what was I to expect.

Yup! I get downvoted there if I try to discuss price retracement or consolidation lol 
The most significant difference between chewy and many experienced traders here (myself included) is his ability to divorce himself from his positions and trade rationally based on what trends the market presents. I'd wager there are a number of traders here that can analyze the market out of position nearly as effectively and determine a good entry point, but once in position, the blinders often go on. 

Rationality and a separation from emotional reactionary moves is the only way to win in this market. 
Ha. I have no idea what the probability of 95k this year is. However, you have to acknowledge that it's possible, given the insane returns of Bitcoin up to this point. A 10x from here in the next 7 months is totally in the realm of possibility. I wouldn't bet my balls on anything not happening that's as possible as 95k by December. How many people thought the same at $1k and have lost various appendages to foolhardy bets? :\-D

So if I had bought Bitconnect at the all time high and my portfolio value went down to almost $0, it would be okay as long as I don’t sell it. 



Makes perfect sense. 
I felt the same way when I passed at buying $800 bitcoin. Not saying you're wrong, but I felt the exact same way and so did many other people. Hindsight, and whatnot. 
Can't see that happening in the near future, another 10 years...probably. nothing out there has the principles, development and trust BTC have
If a new hotspot overthrones bitcoin then the store of value proposition is gone and it all becomes a big speculative fest. 

If I cannot trust BTC why would I trust the new altcoin that overtakes it? I may transition into it but only to look around for the next new thing..

The money that is pumping EOS is the money that was jumping into Ripple and is the money that will rush into <insert your altcoin here>. Still there is a non neglectable amount of people that is not wavering from BTC.
9.5k definitely isn’t going to be an easy cookie to crumble this time about.

I’de definitely be happy with a decent sized short from there with stops above $9,750. 
I feel similar to you although I think the severity and recent nature of the last correction may make people like you or I be more bearish than if we were looking at this completely objectively. 

Just because you've been stung by the bee doesn't mean there's no honey left in the hive. 
Yes, it is the end of the beginning which means the newbs are still technically early adopters.
I am skeptical of any claims that there exists a consortium of whales working in collaboration to drive the price up or down. Were this a single-country phenomenon I might buy it, but there are plenty of deep pockets in every corner of the world whose interests are directly at odds with one another. A Canadian whale might paint the left side of Bart's head while the Singaporean whale finishes off the right. It seems like coordination, but it might just as easily be competition.

I find it hard to believe, for example, that the Chinese government is working hand-in-hand with Goldman Sachs to achieve mutual prosperity. Rather, I believe these institutions and governmental agencies simply represent larger throats to slit in a broader dog-eat-dog market. Whoever emerges as the dominant player in crypto will control finance for decades if not centuries to come. The stakes have never been higher.
Nah this is all I saw

I like this regression analysis better though https://imgur.com/raFe4Cx
If they were good traders, they would not need you. You need to take responsibility and do it alone. Start small if needed. If you are lucky to find a mentor, preferably a friend, you can learn fast.
I really like TheChartGuys. Sober and seasoned daily updates on BTC, ETH, LTC
I like reading Botje since he is active and updates a lot. He also had a few good entries in the last couple of weeks, including ETH, BTC (I know for sure he is short from 9970) and he does kind of TA that people like on this sub (short time frame movements, triangles, possible breakouts and all in all updates in real time).

Trader I learned a lot from is Pro Indicators, he posts daily 10 minutes videos explaining his view on the market and often gives some tips and great information about overall market movements and how to improve as a trader.

I like people who are modest on TV, even when they get something right they stay modest and stick to the ground, while MagicPoopCannon had one good call of H&S couple of months ago and he has been acting like a GOD now. I petty the people who trade on his advice. 
Thanks, just edited my post
It it hits 8800 I'm cashing out and flipping bear. 9k is a stretch as is imho.
Yeah, that's why I'd like to see a successful retest of 9k (or really low 9k's) after testing the top of the channel. Support seems to be getting somewhat stronger, though we could absolutely just fall through. 
Got 2 messages with errors, then 2 messages with position opened.

Don't get it, it didn't catch the opening without stack or what?
I never thought about it like that. I thought maybe I was being a bit tinfoil-hattish, but what you've said makes complete sense.
Market making is a little more complicated than that, no?

The market makers I’ve met have a simple basic strategy. Basically they determine how much of their stack they’re willing to sell for fiat and instead of cashing out they just use that stack as a market maker stack.

They simply use their market maker Bitcoin stack as fiat. If they have 100k worth of Bitcoin they are willing to sell, they can just short 100k and cover whenever (seldom being in a net long position). If the market dumps, they may hold the position, but otherwise they’ll just cover at some point and set orders to resell 0.5usd higher (usually when RSI is oversold). It’s basically the same as selling, but with the maker fee as interest. They also start closing an hour before funding if it acts against them.

If the market shoots through the roof, they don’t care, since it’s the same as if they had just sold to fiat anyways

EDIT: There is still risk of course, but that’s why you try to close and reopen positions when it’s going sideways
extremely underrated advice
Yeah, that's why I put on my tinfoil hat. 

In reality, it's just hard to get a limit buy filled while the price is rising, or a sell while the price is falling.
I agree, just be patient and wait for an hour - this is what I learned to do. Unless of course you want to fomo trade into a rising/falling candle and try to get into a position quickly. Then you have to market buy (if it is really worth the higher fees).
what made you want to FOMO at $9,250? what errors were you looking for in bot logs?
I'm on the June contracts despite the premium. 

If this reverses and breaks $10,000, the premium will likely be double or triple what it is now. 


what's the advantage of future trading? I really don't know this area.

I think Tom Lee is crazy (in general, but also) to say that the upcoming crypto conference will give us 50%-100% boost, but it does seem like a prime opportunity to bust through 10K.
Ok, nvm, here it is.
because inflation, and continuous forks, and infinite inflation caused by forking shit-coins who's only off-ramps are via bitcoins.

and Mt Gox insolvency coins being sold

list goes on, and on and on

> Why not just hover sideways without retesting that resistance, yet not resuming the old trend?

Because, relatively speaking, everything between 1.2K and 20K is thin air. Without retesting (and establishing) some sort of support, we're just meandering through cold space ready to be critically wounded by a dump or two. Retesting resistance turned support, particularly that line, would be a a sign of confidence in that support. 

With that said, anything can happen.
a bounce off of it would be bullish, which is why he'd want it. 

Chew always hopes for very clear signals regardless of where the market goes, it's not that he thinks it's necessary- it's just that it'd make it much easier to say "we are no longer following that line downwards" if we bounced off of it hard again. 

I agree though that the line is too aggressive to be followed and it's very possible we will not test it again even if we do continue downwards
I'm not going to convert someone who is so dismissive of technical analysis, but I would encourage you to reconsider the value of diagonal support and resistance as it pertains to bitcoin. 

Throughout 2016 and 2017, breaking log resistance lines with more than 2 points of contact was a strong indicator of short-term-trend reversal and significant upward movement:

https://imgur.com/a/BdlD9Wc

Granted the timeframes are condensed for the resistance lines I've highlighted when compared to the resistance seen so far in 2018, but I would't be so quick to dismiss the significance of the breakout.


There's a reason lines with 2 points of contact are ignored. 4+ not so much. Believe what you will. Sorry.
Yeah I personally think we are about to bounce a bit soon back up to 9300-9400ish before back down 
Agree, it may even start to complete the left shoulder of an IH&S given the huge resistance.
I think i'll stay out of 9200/9400 and will look for a new position later. Need also to stay out for a while, altough in profit this dip came not without stress.
Close of Business. (17:00/18:00)
Guess I’m not adding to my position.

Back to bed 
Where are you now? Mex?
I guess thats the only way to confirm the upward movement/momentum i.e. breaking through resistances and then using them as support.. is that not the case?
Because only retarded midgets are selling right now, and everyone else is buying.
Out of curiosity, what made you "pick" 9250 instead of eg. 9200 or 9300. What's the significance of 9250 exactly?

What fib levels or channels are you looking at for that number?

Just curious about your process here... :)
That's why I feel it is so important to post your entry as you take it, not after the fact. Same goes for your exit as well. 

You have to own both your successes and your failures if you want anybody to take you seriously. 
is it?
Yeah, people are saying this is re accumulation but when is there a difference between re accumulation and distribution? I don't get that.

To me the Wyckoff logic chart looks strikingly similar to our chart right now. 
Doesn't look like it, just a general continuation or reversal. This could be reaccumulation apparently. I can't find the exact difference yet. 
2014-2016 wasn't ranging though...I mean I guess but that's an extremely large range that's pretty unhelpful in terms of finding buy targets.

I'd say more end of 2015 was accumulation. 

And you can definitely use the Wyckoff phases on an 8h candle time frame especially for BTC, the site I looked at even used it for 2h charts on stocks. I imagine 8h in bitcoin is long enough. 

I mean you can do it on longer TFs but I think this one is long enough to consider it...

2 weeks of sideways in bitcoin is definitely long enough to call it accumulation
Yeah, it's throwing out contradictory signals so we pretty much end up right where we started: short  breakdown from $8.8k, long $10k breakout. Might do some more reading on it later. I'm inclined to think it's distribution but if I look at it objectively it really could go either way pretty easily

Whatever the case, these low volume sideways days are unfortunately the days we probably need to watch carefully for a sudden high volume move. I'll be setting lots of alarms and not making the same mistake I have several times now where I ignore the charts because we're moving sideways. 
My conclusion as well. It's difficult for me to short right now, since sells are still getting bought up and we still have room to form a lower high around $9600\-ish. But my thought is that once the BCH hard fork happens on May 15th and Consensus from May 14\-16th ends, I may enter a hefty short if it starts looking dippy.
Where does it  say he accumulated, or are you just guessing  it's him from his statements?  
The high volume selling off highs and lows volume buying off lows indicates distribution- and I would definitely consider $9.8k to $9990 a failed breakout. I mean, everyone here thought past $9.8k was smooth sailing to $11.7k and it just kinda petered out. 

I'm like 60/40 on distribution/reaccumulation 
I said 9250 but the exact number for the fib is 9265, currently testing it on the 5/15m  https://www.tradingview.com/x/rLzEnMWS/
surprisingly well, yes
Yes, government crackdown of dollar and gold market has exasperated the situation. I'm getting more and more calls for BTC and crypto, hedging against depreciation is the first use case of crypto as dollar and gold are unstable and ridiculously expensive. We are actually glad that the deal was cancelled. The money coming from the deal went to anything but improving local economy.

I also read that Iranians bought about 2.5 billion usd in crypto. 

https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/iranians-buying-billions-dollar-cryptocurrency/


Also there is no hard ban on cryptocurrency. Mostly warning that is volatile and based on nothing. 
90 percent in one day? I doubt that's happened since 2010, and it's highly unlikely now.
How fast does the value of Iran's currency fall in a day if they get bombed?
It *can* drop that much, but what is the likelihood? If you watched your national currency drop 25% in value over six months, and had reason to believe that it would continue to drop, would you considering buying BTC? That's the reality for millions and millions of people. 
btc has been in an uptrend since 2010, that's pretty safe to me.
Iran made the withdrawal when they continued to work on their nuclear program.  
It's already banned and people in Iran say that the government is completely unable to enforce the ban it in any meaningful way
If on MEX, that could very well mean a 96xx position
how's that? They link to top news stories from all over the country/world. They *literally* do not produce content of their own. Also, virus laden? :rolleyes;

Sauce on the volume? Not that it’s unheard of, but don’t Coinbase and Gemini have these services as well and do way more volume? Also, there are liquidity providers that everyone sorta buys from, be it Coinbase, Gemini or Circle.

Are big players known to buy large volumes OTC and dump in on the market for a profit?
There's a difference between OTC that has own stack and the one that is a brokerage. When I sold OTC guys actually put a short on market and covered them later with coin bought from me.
How did shorts get liquidated? Isn't 3.3x max leverage you can use on BFX?

A more long term bearish technical indicator.
And this time, we may break 10k 
Had to spam .05 market buys, anything over that i got a big fat  **not today sir**
$9,150 seems to be a pretty decent area for a position. 

When you jumped the gun on the position i was actually surprised, you seem pretty patient when it comes to trading. 

I’ll most likely add more if we test the ascending channel line again 
For the time I have been daytrading bitcoin (about 15 months now), bfx longs/shorts and bitmex futures premium/discount has been the best temperature check on the market. I have been extremely profitable using this indicator. If the market is bearish and people are longing like retards, it is going to go down. The only time it did not work was in november and december last year. Having a 2-3% premium and a ton of underwater longs right under possibly the strongest resistance we will meet in a long while just shows how irrational this market is.   
   
it's an indicator of trader sentiment- who are largely frequently wrong since January-february. Using as a contrarian indicator has proven relatively profitable so far for people who are patient and wait for things to truly get out of whack (which you're right- they aren't yet) 

And bfx really is the main exchange that other exchanges all follow 
Just means most people assume its going to go up now, that this is the bottom. Shows that the market has a false sense of security, which marketmakers love to exploit, thats how they make their money. Basically we used most of our gunpowder down here, when we really should only use it when we're already going up
well it went down to $100 and now it's back up to $200. and if you take the whole price goes sideways while longs/shorts increase as a contrarian indicator then you could think that premium going up while we go sideways is bearish.

lots of people expect more upwards movement from here...which means most who want to buy the dip already have. so we'll see if their bullishness is warranted
They don't break up in a bull thread, but the fact that most broke up makes it a bull thread 
Bull
Lack of follow-thru, buyers as a whole sitting back at 8900-8800's at least on GDAX is what I see.
11.7k is the one to watch
oh I know, but I don't think that'll happen just yet

I mean even $10K there is a struggle with. 

But thats the point, if we struggle with $10K and take it thats one thing. If we struggle with $10K and can't even get above that, then the dump will be that much harder since people will start losing faith 


probably not, I'm talking more about 1-2 week horizon
It's an ancient term, sadly I can't take credit for inventing it, I'm not nearly that smart :(
Well, I didn't say "everyone".
They are't going to show their cards.
the bitcoin definitely feels like a 4 digit thing..
it doesnt feel 5 digity anymore.
So our upside is capped 700$ from here and -8300 on the downside


Thank you
Thanks! This is what I was looking for.
yes thanks and I fixed it

How practical do you think it is to buy coffee with BTC in the USA?   It's not, regardless of the fees.  Every time you buy coffee, that's a taxable event.  Who is going to bother with all that?    And I know that the USA is not the only country in the world, but it's maybe the biggest market now that China and India have essentially made it illegal.

I don't know much about lightning network, but is likely just another overhyped broken promise about the "future". I don't know much about it though.
Thx, yeah I'm seeing about that with justanotherlogin :)

Exactly what I was thinking.. thanks for confirming. Think as long as it stays above 8800 it has a decent chance of pushing back further up in coming hours/days..
Either crash it / kill it or somehow attract the wrong kind of attention and excessive regulations.
No. BBands do not catalyze moves, only offer a glimpse at when one may be coming. 
I would not focus on the amount of short/longs. For one, 10k bitcoin is not enough to move the market (only in a short-term window). Plus we don't know if these guys are taking opposite trades somewhere else (maybe they are doing arbitrage on margin?)

that's why my comment said i only look at one thing right now.
what? can you clarify?
It just feels indecisive, unknowing of its next move. Feels like it’s in an awkward position and it doesn’t know if it wants to test 8.8k or shoot to 10k 
http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:chart_patterns:rising_wedge_reversal

It’s a bearish pattern then generally breaks down.

But with the current market, you never know if it can break up or down.

We just broke up out of a falling wedge on the 4h earlier today. 
> breaking out of the falling wedge from 20k

these are apparently not very good at being actual reversal patterns. we should really be looking more for an A&E or a triple bottom

> adam and eve double bottom

still need a pretty hefty 30% from here to confirm that

> bullish news for crypto in general

LN came out and we moved up about 1%, news really doesn't matter much post blow-off top, matters more when we've bottomed and are going sideways or are already in the midst of a bull run

> alts going parabolic

i don't see this as a good thing personally, just indicative of the space still needing to be cleansed, keep in mind the two times alts have gone parabolic (june 2017, jan 2017) btc dumped like a motherfucker afterwards


The trend break doesn't mean too much, neither the double bottom as there's no confirmation yet it's a double bottom. Technically we didn't go back to retest 6k as well.

I see barely any bullish crypto news and the fact that alts are rising means nothing except that stupid people still buy shit coins.

Weekly moving averages still show us a long going way off a bull market, right now we are still in the bear market until proven otherwise. Plus the bear market hasn't lasted 5months. 4months right now, it can certainly last another 4.
everyone and their mom is gonna argue with me here but tell that to 2014-2015...those dudes kept saying it was over every single time there was a run-up like this...

call it gox call it whatever you want, "belief" doesn't change anything. it's people *actually* buying more than they're selling
Can be a big difference between the market sentiment that is visible online versus the true market sentiment which is always unknowable (unless you want to say the price is itself the reflection of the sum total of sentiment)
From 6th April we have 19 green candles and 15 red. Seems fine to me.
Yeah, and I added a warning. It's interesting though. Why the same $200 "steps"?
Can confirm. - 

Hey, btc is trapped in a range, I'll sell the horizontal resistance that is clearly there from the last three times.

Result - it kept going up the fourth time.

Let's see what happens now. Price just passed the "trigger" level.
Exactly.  
The Chart Guys "Dan"  has been spot on and is predicting this plays out exactly as is. However, he sees it as a needed pull back before an equilibrium break up in the near future. Basically re-charging the bulls down to mid-8's to set a weekly high low, then boom, up we go. If you have 10 min, watch his youtube video from today, he has been spot on l lately.
I called the H&S yesterday and I 100% believe it'll happen. 
Thanks man.
 
Yeah, I agree that votes shouldn't matter, but it can be frustrating to try and add value to this sub, only to see your post disappear due to downvotes. I can handle disagreement, but when nobody even tries to engange me in a discussion, then why the fuck are we even here?

Anyway, it seems to have balanced out somewhat!
the votes do matter though as its easy to bury a good comment like this one below the vote threshold, right? 
What exchange? It was 25 on finex.
hmmm
I bought at 1200 and then all the way down to 180...pretty fucking happy.
?

I wish there was a trustless betting service; I'd put 1 btc on that bet

Hell I'd probably put it at 1:3 odds
i really think we would of gone down to 3k by now.  Best deal of the year has been 5900 so far.  Not looking likely for another down trend
While anything is possible, that would likely bring the entire crypto market cap down with it, to about $130B. 

THAT, I don’t see happening. As over-exuberant the crypto market is, $130B seems like a very low valuation for an industry that has potential to transform everything it touches. 

It goes no lower then $4,800 in my eyes and if it goes there it rebounds hard. 
3k is more more possible than 20K again.  
who Novogratz?
when i started buying bitcoin last year i didn't even know what TA was.  Now I check out what people are saying, but its always 50/50 if they are right
Nah, North Korea was notoriously involved in crypto, no ban was issued. No difference here. Also USD and oil are funding nuclear weapons, this one is a form a capital flight.
Break above $9,150 would break us out of the wedge, and if we don’t meet too much trouble @ $9,200 I dont see why $9,350 isn’t an option 
Absolute power move lol. 

Ide like to add more to it, it’s only a small position 
Yeah, $9500 today, $9750 tomorrow, and a nice Friday FOMO/payday rally to bust through $10k on Friday. But who knows. It's Bitcoin.  I'm still hoping for a dip but now my hope is to catch a wick at $9150.  Should have bought more a couple weeks ago.  Oh well.
We're still having hard time to break through 9.3, going above 9.5 should be bullish enough to test 10k.

Not a stupid move, he took the profits and is still long on his cold stack. Better than closing in a loss if it bounces back down.
Don't mind being downvoted tbh, but thanks for the tip all the same :)
Anytime
Assuming he means cold storage. 
Why would anyone sell sub-9K? Even the mad dumpers aren't that irrational.
Lines are curves in log-scale.
I really hope this wasn't a DCB... have got a long from just under 9100 (a position I entered after a long time) and dont want to lose profits...!
lol at everybody 
Probably 10k from here I would say... but thats purely my thoughts.
8500.  Lol at anyone saying 10k
$8500...got to think 90% more likely.
Well its already been all the way back to just under 9k and then back here again..! Lets hope it doesn't go back there else may go much further below...
I don't want to offer investment advice. I read a TA earlier today that we might see a small rally to 9300, so I expected it. Same analysis said we were heading for $8900, but on the condition that we stayed inside the falling channel on the hourly chart. Since we broke out of the falling channel, I suppose the outlook is less clear now, but we did cross the 20MA on the daily chart. Also, now the hourly 50MA has leveled out, but the 100MA and 200MA are still sloping down. Without laying claim to being any kind of expert, I would guess that we will continue down, and that today's little rally was not a reversal.
Congratulations on a good call. If your short is still open.
I didn't expect one of the "TA professors" to join in, but your welcome to criticize my attempts at analysis. Perhaps I should have stated that the reversal is apparent, not evident. I have never claimed to be an expert at TA, but from what I've read, the 20MA on the daily is one of the indicators to watch. 
Yeah after reading your post and doing some more thinking I closed out that remaining short entry at 9325. Hard to believe there won't be an opportunity to get a higher entry. Layering in orders at 9485/9585/9685
Too bad my positions will usually end with a negative PnL, but lets see if i can change my luck. For now this short seems doomed from the start but at least it's only 50% stack. Will keep a tight leash on this one.
don’t burn bunnies, it’s arson

amirite
The alternative is even harder to believe: That a large number of people are bragging about placing high risk trades. As others pointed out, the norm in this sub is that people brag after the fact.
> To say this is to suggest a significant number of people claim fake trades which I find hard to believe.

Then you are gullible. I can name a number of people on this sub who obviously post fake trades, including one or two that actually go out of their way to post doctored screenshots of Bitmex. I'm not supposed to call them out anymore though because they get mad and complain to the mods.
Don't think 9k will hold, but how was the bounce weak?
This ancient log support/resistance line/zone (purple) keeps showing up on my chart haha. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/SacMjf09/ 
Thank you for the advice, Chewy.  I figure we'd retest the resistance turn support as well, but got impatient.  I may just add if it dips to lower my CA a bit.  If we breakdown hard back into the downtrend line, I'll just cut my losses at around 9050.
Fundamentals are as good now as they were in December, you don't need a good new every week for price increases to be justified.
New people enter the market every single day.

Nasdaq and NYSE sound like pretty good fundamentals to me anyway.
I think 10K is very deflated, actually, and I think this is the result of very inorganic, emotional dumping by people who don't care how much they lose as long as they drive the price of Bitcoin down.  The only reason I care about the short-term price is that I'm a dip hunter, which has worked extremely well for me so far this year (big buys at 6K, 6.6K, and 7.5K).  I have a buy order at 9150 that I do not really expect to execute.  Long term, the fundamentals are great -- the supply is limited, and demand only grows.  Eventually these big dumpers run out of coins/have to cover.

[edit to add:] Also, regarding fundamentals, Bitcoin's utility is great and just getting better and better all the time. There is no better way to pay (or be paid).
A little hopium:

May 2014: 34.63% gain  
May 2015: 1.90% loss  
May 2016: 18.20% gain   
May 2017: 55.21% gain  
May 2018: 3.7% gain so far  

26.54% average targets $11,400 for EOM :P  

Let's see how full of crap Tom Lee is haha
Lets not make it into another chinese new year or wall street bonuses type situation ;)
>Then there's pretty much thin air between $10,000 and $11,700.

We've spent a lot of time recently testing areas that went untested in December. I'm expecting a bit more friction above 10k as this process continues.
lol direct cause.

More direct than the companies in your stock portfolio that produce and distribute it Billy?  
thats why he had buffet with him

Successfully retaining wealth is not an easy task especially at the levels these guys operate. 
One is making a prediction as a hedge fund manager and its in his best interest for btc to go up , btc goes up he makes money. 

The other is a prediction from the richest men in the world and they have no skin in the game regarding bitcoin. It could go 100k or 0 and they would still be billionaires. 

I'm not saying one or the other is right/wrong. Just that if I were to blindly trust one of them I would trust the guys not emotionally/financially attached to btc's price
I wouldn't be so quick to deride these two. These are two examples of very wealthy fellows who still have dignity and a sense of moral responsibility. Both are pretty down to Earth too. If you're going to shit on rich folks, shit on the Koch brothers, Bezos and Zuckerberg. Don't be mad at Buffet and Gates because they aren't bullish on your investment. 
thanks for the update
I'm not pro btc or bch, I just trade whatever opportunity I find. But if you trade btc daily and monitor btc's price hourly you start to notice when the price action is unusual, well for the past 3 weeks it happened a quite often, and everytime it does it happens to be when bch is pumping. 

Now the explanation behind that I cannot tell you exactly why, but this is clearly happening and i'm not the only one that noticed it. 
May 15th fork date, no? Tempting to short the ratio at 0.2 on MEX. 
Dude we get it, you lost money because of bitcoin legacy and fucked up because you didn't buy bch. Relax, there's more in life than money 😜
You salty of missing out on that 3H candle?
We all agree with this person more or less it's not only this post but their whole post history is generally abrasive. I'd argue they can't do better. 
There are too many idiots in the market, they should be called out for what they are
BTC is the epitome of r/r... you might find higher returns in alts but not better risk
Low risk investment? 
Wat
What numbers
In my own mind, yes.
Dropped out of college, obviously. 

JK, I (barely) completed college. I dunno, I just have a tendency to always respond (obsessive compulsive disorder maybe). I could probably spend my time far more productively.
Lol yeah I know, I was taken aback by the endearment. Was quite the self-esteem boost.
" On the way down to $6K........ and sell below 5.8K. and 6K triple bottom.."

It is getting crazy here!!!

Yeah, just $3k/btc loss, nothing to worry about :/
We are at 9k and already 6k is expected ,
damn 
> of course no one can tell you when to buy. the only time it will be a great time to buy is when everyone is screaming that it's an awful time to buy

Or when everyone calls... 5.8K
Well, people were also saying that back in February... 
And? 

That doesn't have to correlate with a high BTC price, or a healthy crypto market. 
Well I know a very different story. The vast majority in my office sold at the first sign of trouble and now view crypto as a scam.

That is the problem with taking a tiny data set and extrapolating it.

How is sentiment up? Searches are down month on month, there is less twitter activity, there will be an ICO smack down soon, there is no media buzz anymore
Exactly, the blind bull mentality here is pretty funny.

Anything realistic but negative gets down voted to oblivion, the denial is real. 
What the fuck are you on about Christ 
seems like someone's got a short at these prices eh? 
> After ETH is canceled

lolol
>the current value of 1 Bitcoin is approximately $4500. 



No that’s not how that works. The price is defined by the market. So that means that 1 Bitcoin is worth approximately 9,000 (as of the time of writing). 
The “greater fool” theory is a lie.

Bitcoin (and other cryptos) offer utility that is not available on any other platform. Buffet and Gates either don’t realise this, don’t care, or are against it.

As demand for that utility increases so will the price of an individual coin. 

Your post is completely wrong in every respect.
OK, well, how about this: I made money on that trade, and I'm going to make even more on this one because I'm long and strong.
The h&s is just a reversal point and I'm just saying based on previous fractals that zone is not impossible
Why is every bearish (factual) sentiment classified as FUD? Weak, sad. 
Hi sorry, I edited it because I hadn't put in a timeframe for it and I expected to buy back in at 8800 in the next 2 days (today).

By the way it's not horseshit, if I said the exact same thing but saying it would go up I would be upvoted, or at least not downvoted. I'll show you if you'd like.
Silence....
Well sure, taking a loan for anything is a risk I suppose. Certainly if it is to purchase items that don't have lasting value. 

I was more considering from a business point of view. Often small companies use lines of credit to keep business fluid. Wages, supplies, and other gap situations where you need cash for a short period of time. If a company holds crypto this could be a great way to leverage in short term situations.
And now he can't fap to upvotes. You destroyed his evening.

Boom roasted
Nope, the one I opened yesterday. Read my comment history. It's there. You'll also notice I just opened a position very close to where I closed the last one (9250 close, 9275 open). It's how I roll. I look for power numbers.
Ha, you're right. I closed that one. It was another one. Thought that profit looked a bit large... man, I gotta start wearing my glasses.
[removed]
Thank you.
Yes dude *every* person in *every* country. Do you know how many people that is?! it's all of them!!! 
Yes.. 
I just gave up on posting there. Last time I tried, I got insulted for using trade terms and they asked me why I didn't just HODL or bought more. I fell into that trap when I just started out with crypto (being too sentimental in general as well) and it's because of subs like that, who just spout their ignorance at anyone trying to discuss analysis or heck anyone who is bearish. I'm certainly no expert (not in the slightest), but how can I learn and improve my skills, when every post is 'GENTLEMAN' or 'Moon WHEN?' (with 20 upvotes). 
>Rationality and a separation from emotional reactionary moves is the only way to win in this market.

So, so true. 
Totally agree! Another differentiator for me is the time he spends explaining and even answering the trolls. I would get pissed at the doubters for sure lol
so true it hurts
It's due to 2 main reasons i believe:

* Laziness in entering that in the command / lack of knowledge of that feature

* Fear of being used against them in stop hunting

I thought you're already short ;-)
:D
Very interessting, I think it is good for this sub to have this. Good job.
It hit 800 twice right?  If you are talking the run up to $1200 and missed $800 those people got to watch a nice dump for around a year and a half in the $150-250 range.  If you are talking the $800 at the beginning of 2017 that would have been a heck of an entry.  It’s all about timing.  Now 800 had around a 25x return within a year.  To match that from here would take bitcoin over 200k.  If that shit happens I think it will take years.  The exponential potential for bitcoin is just not there now.  Maybe it proves me wrong.  I just plan to buy in the bloodbath if we get one.  20k to 6k was not a bloodbath to me, it was a few months of dumping and everyone had plenty of time to get out of there.  I think something much worse is in the cards.  We will see.  No one knows for sure.
They're selling their bitcoin not to short bitcoin, but to get capital to put into a new hot investment - such as a new real estate bubble somewhere.  New buyers have to replace that money.  When new buyers run out, then it collapses.. not because there's something wrong.





Oh I know, this market is in limbo rn. I was looking at Shorts and Longs earlier and was like yeahh I'll just Tether it rn. Liquidated my alts and am just sitting it out rn. 

I'll let the Asian market do it's thing while I sleep lol

Stop with mention 6K or 5K..... it will not happen..




All Ok. 6K and 5K no more. Maybe 8.5K. but end of year we will see 13K or more
so what if was the channel real? It is very big that we could be practically anywhere from here and still validate it.
Careful bro.  Kidney stones super suck.  I know.
+1 for TheChartGuys.  Dan does a daily video on YouTube as well.  I find his analysis really helpful.
Awesome mate. Thank you for such a descriptive answer! Very helpful :) 
Bots don't generally pick up on edits.
Yeah 8.8 is my limit too, and I'll dust of the bear suit. 
Got your commands in duplicate, don't know why really. It seems to have happened only to you. Could have been a reddit issue though.
That's why big players use big exchanges. You don't see 500 BTC market buy or 1k wall on kraken while on finex it's normal to see one of those once in a while. Going with 500 BTC market buy would push the price well above 10k on smaller exchanges with empty order books.
There's certainly more complexity, and not every market maker behaves in the same way.

But specifically to Bitmex, the primary market maker there appears to be operating in the manner I've described.
If there’s a pump or dump, always market buy/sell. But I dont trade if it dumps or pumps and Im out of a position
I've had a losing streak 1 week ago, followed by 1 day of revenge trading that made it worse. I've been out of position for a week trying to get into a safe trade. The most i managed was breaking even.
So for a bit i'll just follow chewy's advices and hope to recoup some of my losses to gain confidence again to enter trades on my own.

When we broke up a lot of people started entering positions and some had errors on the syntax. I ended up editing the bot syntax to handle some variations of the syntax and lost some time there.

On the next update to the bot parser things should be more resilient to errors in the syntax so i can get back to losing money on my trades. The bot was actually a good excuse to take my mind of trading for a while.
No funding fees. You can hold until the instrument closes (6/30 or 9/30).

Liquidity is lower though, so you're at risk of slippage for large orders, and it trades at a premium or discount depending on market/trader sentiment.

Yup, this exactly. 
First off, let me just say that I only visit this sub and type command+F "_chewtoy_". There are other valuable contributors but I don't have the time to find them.

That being said, while I do enjoy your TA of bitcoin, I think most people aren't looking at things from a macro and psychological ecosystem viewpoint, and this is a flaw. 

My humble opinion is the tail is wagging the dog these days. The only reason programmers like myself and the rest of silicon valley became interested in this space again is because we can finally build stuff with Ethereum. 

Ethereum not only catalyzed the 2017 btc bull run, but it's currently propping it up, I believe, even though it wants to dump badly at every opportunity. The coming Consensys conference is the current dominant force on the market right now. 

Other big macro forces are Casper FFG is coming in a few months and eth inflation will be decreased by 80%, along with 5% staking returns. 

Just my two satoshis. But keep up the good TA work.
I'm not dismissive of TA by any means, I use fib retracements, triangles, falling wedges, rsi, macd, volume, stoch rsi, parabolic sar etc. to enter a trade when the stars align. I used diagonals a lot previously and always wondered why the market did not react to one in particular, so let's find another one that fits (like the market cares about a point of the 2016 chart) until it fits, why did that one not get retested etc. Globally I think the indicators I use are much more representative of supply/demand that in fine, drives the price, than diagonals I kept adjusting to fit my cognitive bias. Maybe that helps, maybe not, I have a lot of respect for you and and how you're profitable sticking to your framework, which is something personal by definition.
[deleted]
Okay, I have a question for you. Can you point me in the direction of, or give me a quick rundown on how you're using these diagonal support/resistance? Are you drawing this on the first down candle? I feel like they work great, but more "after the fact" vs a normal trend since they are covering such a few amount of candles.....

Hope that makes sense.
[deleted]
I held through it too, definitely took a couple days off the old lifespan. worth it.
Thinking of switching to bitmex because of this. 
You'll get it eventually if you keep putting orders in. I went long on 3.5 btc this morning and it took 9 positions to get it all, some as little as .002

They've been out of margin for the last week or so, it's been super aggravating.
Flip flopping between mex and finex, depends which stack I'm opening with.
When i look at Bitcoinwisdom charts i just see multiple bull traps for today, no upward momenten whatsoever. At some moment these insane market anomalies wil end resulting in a huge crash. 
Looks like those 'retarded midgets' where on the right side, the majority is always wrong.
First, there was the breakout to the upside of the descending channel that took place a few minutes after I made my entry:

https://imgur.com/a/Rggoex9

Normally I'd advise waiting for the breakout before entering a position, but since Bitmex's servers appear to be powered by 3 hamsters running on a treadmill, I've been forced to take riskier positions to ensure I get a decent entry. 

As for $9,250, you can see [here](https://imgur.com/a/sRgKJMh) that it served as strong support for most of the day Monday, and served as resistance for most of the day Tuesday. 

Reclaiming it as support is bullish and — combined with the break of the descending channel resistance — suggests this might be the beginning of a larger move. 

The market could very easily fall below $9,250 again, however, but as long as sellers don't push the market back into the descending channel, then the short-to-medium-term outlook is still bullish.
💯 % agree
Is it what?
I think we're all in the same boat right now. If you find any clues of what's going on, please share.
Yeah I'm doing some reading and it's a little confusing. 

I can't seem to find anything regarding two consecutive accumulation phases. 

It looks like the two phases are reactionary to one another. 

$6,500 bottom could have been the accumulation phase and this local top could be acting as a reactionary distribution phase. 

Edit: Stalling out on a high with low volume buying is also characteristic of distribution. 
15th all those bch's coming back into btc
14-16th hype mania, with all kinds of people holding bags from jan/feb desperate to hype it up

it's dangerous to be short right now, but a lot of people cant wait.


more important to understand the man.. if u want to know how he accumulated, google it.  

my opinion is he's not a diehard long term investor because he believes in the vision of bitcoin.
You play the man, not the cards.

The weekly chart shows that this entire rise from 6.5k to 9.9k was done with low and declining volume. We are also now forming a characteristic "rounded top", which together with the declining volume, suggests that bullish momentum is fading. 

I definitely agree with you here: that we are more likely to see further decline rather than a break through 10k, and that the entire move throughout the 9k region is more likely to be distribution rather than accumulation. 

Edit: From a market cycle perspective, i see the same weakness being reflected in the alts, which for some reasons or another, are starting to sell off back into BTC (as indicated by the sudden weakening of their BTC ratios).
Well now I look stupid.

Thanks.
Ok I heard the opposite from "people in Iran" so I guess we will have to disagree on whether government bans hurt demand at all.

I think many people in this sub vastly underestimate the amount of interest from large players, but it is a murky business to say the least so hard to get a true gauge.

edit clarity
Yeah, most OTC desks I know of just want to make commission on the trade and not have any market risk in the meantime. So if you sell them coins, they would just lock in the price of those coins by shorting the market that same amount you sold them.

The desks I’ve seen and used basically had fiat and coins on an exchange and if you gave them cash, they bought those coins for you from stamp dax and kraken. If you sell your coins to them, they give you fiat, you give them a ledger and they sell the coins they hve on the exchanges to fiat to cover.

I think no serious party is comfortable holding any type of market risk and simply hedges all that away in a trade
and where would the coin that you sold them come from?
Yup, everyone seems to forget about that.
just messing around, bud. and yes to the green dildo question
would there be any chances of avoiding? Maybe if we continue to appreciate, we'll move in a diff direction??
Why you go there? It's good for EUR non margin trading only.
Yeah I got a little trigger happy.. could feel the thing ready to break and wanted to be in position because BitMex sucks during big price movements .. just had to hold through the dip
Yeah it's fuel for market makers to push the price down but it's not an indicator in and of itself, I don't think. Eventually the price and premium will move up simultaneously. We we're looking at 15-20% premium at peak in December. Same thing can/will happen at some point. 
12k is easier to write, and everything is +- 500 anyway
If we defend 9k over the weekend, I completely agree with you
I know the term wage slave but I've never heard it changed to wagecucking though. Im using this now haha

Either you don't know anything about 0-conf and exchanges or you're just being a troll like usual. Either way...
> attract the wrong kind of attention

lol.  You know what this shit was used for in 2012~2013 right?
I think it's an extremely good vehicle for them to profit off as it attracts a segment of society that they have had a hard to time engage in. They will find ways to monetize it, and sure they'll burn inexperienced traders if they can make a profit. I think they'll want to completely eradicate it because it would be too difficult. 
Politicians don't give a shit about darkweb. They do about Wall Street.
Yes feels like it.. Thought it broke 9.3k convincingly at one stage but then pulled back under and now unsure where its going... Whats the rough target you are thinking for your long as I have a similar one around 9100.
the market has felt indecisive for a while now.. We've been range bound for like 3 months. None of this is going to feel clear or obvious for a while I bet 
It behaves like before second push to 11.7. we were in 9.2-9.6 range, suddenly big push through 9.8 resistance and it just stopped for a long time before continuing up movement. It was indecisive until strong rejection from 11.7. it will be probably like this until 12k.
Lately it feels like it's always a gamble when it's consolidating. If there is a valid trendline, it makes it a bit easier to guess. Right now I'm assuming it may be going up from the momentum of the green daily candle.
On the techical side i agree with what you say, but you are missing the point about the bullish news. LN will not make my father invest in crypto, neither will a block size increase of btc. What will make my father invest is Coinbase offering him a 10 000$ worth of crypto stack that can double or triple for a premium of 1% a year. What can make my father invest is him seeing crypto on Sillicon Valey being heavily shilled. And lets be honest, the ones left here arent gonna make BTC surge to ATH's. Its your father, my father and every single gullible investor with a phone and time to make a Coinbase account. There is no TA that can predict this, so im not gonna be the person saying btc is overbought at 10k by the end of 2017
Yes, surely you can invalidate all of these points but thats because you are biased, we all are. One thing you cant invalidate though is the good news about crypto, Coinbase hiring massive amounts of new staff, Sillicon Valey shilling crypto, the news about the NY stock exchange considering crypto, banks buying crypto exchanges etc etc. I dont care if we fall down to 6500 again, I'll just buy more on the way down because the writing is on the wall for btc and many alts.
And another 4 and another and another 4. We can't really now for sure, but there is a long way for BTC to correct after 10000% rise in three years. 
History doesn't repeat itself but it rhymes.
to me this situation right now has 2014 written all over it. I know that thing don't copy like for like but it really is similar. If this turns out to be a DCB then a lot of people are going to have to take a good long look at themselves for getting carried away yet again
How many times did we have 4 continuous red ones? And what happened right after? 
Trading algo's. 
Yeah indeed.  It's up to people like us to keep it visible then.  I don't see insightful comments get utterly buried though, they usually stay close enough to zero.

I meant though that as a poster, don't feel angry about it, and start calling names.
Drop the 'open'
Yeah, I don't mind that as a bear, but my point is, it's possible to see lower price. l
Why stop at $3k? Why not $100? Hell make it $1. You permabears are a funny bunch. 
No. Bloomberg. Novogratz will be richer than Buffett, Gates, and Bloomberg combined in a few years because he sees the future, and he's embracing it, not fighting it.
> its always 50/50 if they are right

No its not always 50/50.  Chewtoy is above 50.00000% and by quite a bit.
The odds of an outcome isn't the same as the number of possible outcomes.
I know, I’m just joking haha. 
bitcoin already proved its not worth 10k so. your upside here is limited anyway.  It'll have to consolidate in this range for a while. 
So try to post reasoning to help others understand why you closed this one if you want to share your positions ;)
Anyone who bought between 6.5 and 10k and think it's going sub 6k duh.
Horizontal lines are horizontal lines in any scale.
actually curves are lines in log scale
[deleted]
10k , too much bullish sentiment and consensus coming next week 

lol at anyone saying 8.5k
i wish i had kept it. I don't take leveraged positions into bed lol. 
I think there are high chances of sub 9K. So perhaps in that case you might want to keep it open and it should give you some positive PnL.
One can probably inferno who I'm talking about based on all these hints. Imo, people who post that type of nonsense should be bunned.
You wascally wabbit. You're on fire.
> Then you are gullible

Is it so far fetched to think that someone might be influenced? I see regularly a post about 'hey guys I made 5% on a million dollars woo hoo' and there are 20 congratulation comments. People think he's a hero and might be influenced by his alleged trades later.
we got to like $9120...
because it was...
now would you look at that
where it starts? I don't have such a line.
Weird I have a little bit more breathing room on mine than yours: https://imgur.com/rlsYsti

What time frame did you draw the line at when you connected to the sept low candle?  I connected mine on 12hr.
this is no place for well-formulated opinions with supporting evidence, away with you
And indeed in december the bubble had its apex and then popped in Jan.

New people enter the market every single day: care to show the evidence? Care also to show the evidence of people leaving the market?

Nasdaq/NYSE, are you sure having easy access to Bitcoin for a lot more of mainstream traders/investors will lead price to skyrocket suddenly?

Edit: Think I misunderstood the tone of your comment, sometimes is not easy with written comments and with different cultures/languages. :) I apologize but my questions above are still valid although not related to your comment.
Very Deflated, care to exlain why it's very deflated?
Care to explain the inorganic and "emotional" dumping reasons?
Care to analize the huge big green candles we saw in this last run?

Long term the fundamentals are great, what makes you so sure Bitcoin Core Devs will deliver what they promised? What makes you so sure mainstream adoption will prefer Bitcoin and not another Altcoin?

Regarding your edit: what if you were paid your salary with BTC in December and then have to pay your mortage early april? Still the best way to be paid?
looks good as i see the upper 8k - lower 9k as a major support, and lower 11k as the next major resistance after we break 10k. 
good reminder, but also important to remember that just because some events didn't have an effect on price doesn't mean all events won't have an impact on price
I'm not necessarily saying the market would plow right through up to $11,700 in a single 12h candle. 

We'd likely see similar up and down chop as we're seeing now between $8,600 and $10,000. 

But the market would likely be drawn to $11,700 like a magnet over the course of a few days or weeks. It's just too significant a price point to come so close to without hitting.
It's an absurd claim to make, but his rationale has at least a tiny thread of logic and reason embedded within it. 

He's basically claiming that, if it weren't for bitcoin, these individuals would be less inclined to purchase fentanyl because they'd lack the ability to do so "anonymously" over the internet.

Clearly he's never met somebody struggling with addiction, however. As there is absolutely nobody more ingenuitive and determined than a drug addict trying to score drugs.  

They'd meet a dealer in person and exchange cash. 

They'd buy gift cards anonymously with cash and use them to buy drugs. 

Or hell, they'd take on the risk of there being a paper trail of the transaction and just straight up wire somebody the money.
Berkshire Hathaway is a glorified mutual fund that is outperformed by most plain vanilla mutual funds.  He's not a "genius investor." He's a guy who got a bunch of his daddy's buddies to buy shares and gave himself a bunch of shares, then rode the market up for 50 years.  He's a great salesman. That's all.  

And Gates... don't even get me started.  Bought DOS and had his mommy on the board of IBM get them to start using it.  Total tech tard who has been living on calcified corporate CYA ("Oh, better buy Microsoft because that's what everyone does!") for far too long.

History is not going to smile on either one of those guys.
Buffet & co absolutely have skin in the game. Money to them is like points on a scoreboard, a way to measure 'success'. If some upstarts suddenly get anywhere near their 'high score' dealing in some nonsense they have no knowledge of, they'd see it as a slight to their own abilities and achievements. And that's without even touching on (however unlikely they might think it is) the possibility of Bitcoin or some other crypto-based system taking down the existing financial systems. 
I get it, but Buffet/Gates are not really making market predictions, they are emitting a moral judgement.

Think it like this: replace Bitcoin with alcohol.

Gates and Buffet are saying: I hate alcohol, it should be banned,it is bad for the world.

Tom Lee is saying: I don't give a F about if alcohol is good or bad for people but given the market conditions alcohol demand will grow in the following weeks/months.

Don't trust on Lee blindly but it is closer to a market projection based on analysis than what the others are saying.
True, Gates and Buffet have contributed mind-blowing amounts of money to some very worthwhile causes. They deserve our respect. That doesn't mean their opinions on crypto have merit, though.
All low market cap / poor liquidity alts do this. This is not new and it doesn't say much about who's "leading". These coins are simply easy to pump and dump and market makers take advantage of this to various degrees depending on what the overall market is doing. Also, like I said, completely unwarranted hype over the upcoming fork gives people a narrative to latch on to. The truth is that the fork is absolutely meaningless given the state of BCH.

edit: downvoters care to explain how 32 Mb limit increase is at all relevant, given that BCH has such tiny blocks at the moment? I have yet to hear a reason for why this limit increase is good or necessary or bullish for BCH. Instead of just using your mouse to click the down arrow, how about actually voicing your thoughts?
Yeah. I'm tempted to do the same but might wait to see what happens closer to the date. The bottom line though is that this is purely unfounded hype. I've recently returned from an expedition to the 'BTC' sub and i can tell you with great certainty that these people are as deluded as ever. They are claiming that adoption is taking off and that the flippening is underway. Meanwhile, the numbers paint a very different picture. There is so little organic demand to use BCH that block size is basically at its ATL, Segwit is *still* outperforming BCH and these people are obsessed over a 32 Mb cap increase. The narrative makes absolutely no sense and they are just repeating the same propaganda that Roger puts out via Twitter and Bitcoin.com. Their favorite argument seems to be that BCH is "Satoshi's Vision," which is falsifiable bullshit. 

Don't listen to me though, I'm just a Blockstream sockpuppet.
Yeah that's totally it! It's not like BCH is actually a defunct project with less transaction throughput than circa 2013 era Bitcoin. No it's definitely because Bitcoin "legacy" is a loser. 

Yup, definitely that.
Nope.

Keep deflecting.
They're a good contributor... it's hit and miss more than usual lately.
What’s your opinion of ideal ratio between BTC and alts? Just out of interest 
this guy sky dives to work every morning
I meant low risk by crypto standards. Btc is by far the safest low risk choice in crypto
% returns?
4, 45, 17, just some numbers.. They want to fight you 
Haha, alright. Was just curious because you're always full of vigour in your online discussions. Seems like you made quite the reputation over there.

(substantively, I think your arguments were on point, but being fully honest I'm not educated enough on the subject.)
Well at least you’re well educated on the subject and it isn’t just a bunch of fluffernuffagus 
I mean...do u just keep adding on the way down forever?? At some point u have to reassess...
tell that to people who bought at 10k or 15k ;)
it's a 30% loss, if you don't go all in its really not that much. He's asking for a long term hold, not a 10x position entry 
Where did I say I expected it? If you buy here you should understand there is a strong possibility of it occurring. I don't see how $6k is unreasonable but $12k isn't?? 

and if you think both are unreasonable to expect in the next, say, month or so, do you think btc is just gonna hang around $9k forever? lol 
I call ~2k based on the previous bubble top and bottom

No it's not a lie. I bet you only bought into the Ponzi in December or January.

Donald? Is that you?
It is when you don’t back it up with any TA. You just keep repeating yourself. 
It's horseshit if your claim is that this sub only upvotes bulls and downvotes bears. There may be some bias one direction or the other depending on overall sentiment but the allegation is outright false. 
-_-
Not those on ISS
I literally bought more so I could short more. This is a fucking hyperwave **PHASE SEVEN** VAMPYRE
I couldn't agree more. I [posted a while back](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/84r36x/real_recovery_will_be_signaled_by_altcoins/dvrrjzu/) laying out my case that BTC will see a huge inflow of new money during the next recession due to central bank printing. Interestingly enough, it could be a perfect storm if the global economy goes into a major recession, central banks respond with ZIRP/NIRP and Bitcoin performs the halving.
> Sometimes seeing ALL the possibilities isn't a good thing.

Haha I love this so much.

Let's hope so
It's not super helpful where the market is currently trading, but will certainly be worth considering if/when the market is trading in the $30K to $40K range or the $3K to $4K range (whichever comes first).

Which syntax opened the position? Both should be good.
And it seems like it's replying to wrong post. Should be reply to the one with syntax and it looks like it gets to parent post of that with syntax.
There was a 300 BTC market sell on GDAX a couple weeks back. It went badly. 
ah got you, yeah I remember seeing you post about the streak, sorry to hear that my dude. I went on vacation for two weeks and stepping away for a while helps a ton, hope it goes well for you going forward. for what it's worth, your bot is a smash hit!
This mornings dip was interesting.  It wen't straight into premium divergence and didn't create a lower low like spot did.

I never said the market "should" be testing it. I'd just feel more comfortable in the current trend if it were tested.

It's quite possible the line is already irrelevant and the market will never touch it again. 
They're pretty meaningless until you can successfully plot a line using at least three points of contact. 

So what you're looking for is a strong rejection at a local high followed by continued downward momentum over a period of at least a few weeks. 

Here's a good example zoomed in to the 12h for the drop from $5,000 to $3,000:

https://imgur.com/a/BBWvsTv

Once you can confidently draw three distinct points of contact, the validity of the line becomes stronger and you can be more confident that the momentum will shift once the line is violated. 

And you are absolutely correct: they work after the fact. They won't really offer much in the way of, "it's a good time to short, because the trend will likely continue." 

But they will provide guidance on when the trend is broken. 
You could make precisely the same argument for the current breakout though. 

Resuming the underlying bull trend and continuing upward to make a new ATH. 
BitMex is too confusing for my liking. Trading futures and all that shit.

I want simplicity because knowing me, I’ll hit the wrong butthole and like control alt delete my stack  
Bitmex only irritating thing is that they still don't have mobile app. Logging onto website through mobile with 2FA takes too much time.

Of course they still have problems with too much users, but I hope they'll fix this soon.
I'm there because i have not BTC stack and only trading with a few hundred bucks. I hoped we got to 4 or 5k to buy BTC and then move to Bitmex. It never went there (truth be told, if it did i would probably wait for 3K and wouldn't pull the trigger anyway...)
No.  They're still the ones selling.  
Thanks a ton! Appreciate your transparency!
Curious your take on the Consensus convention that runs next week. I know you're not one to trade based on news or FUD, and I personally think Tom Lee (of Fundstrat) is about as bulltard as they come and I don't believe we'll come close to seeing ATH prices during/immediately following this conference. However, it's a big conference which *will* garner positive media coverage and *should* cause an influx of public money. How much is unknown, but could that provide an X factor on top of the mid-term bullish outlook to push us back into 5-digit territory?
Apparently the high volume selling off highs indicates distribution. We'd need high volume buying off the lows to indicate re accumulation. 

However the lower highs indicate re accumulation. Lol so I'm lost. 
Yup, also read high volume selling off highs is indicative of distr. whereas high volume buying off lows is reaccumulation. Seen the former, not the latter so far. 

Higher lows indicative of reaccumulation but most everything else points to distribution. 

Either way, a break below $8.8k or above $10k would pretty definitively make way for a continuation of the downwards trend or a high chance of a bullish reversal
Agreed. Only reason I'm waiting for the hype train to end so I don't get caught in an underwater short. I can't deny it looks tempting to short right about now though. We've had a nice FOMO cycle, I'm just waiting for the FUD to hit.
not stupid at all! I should have been clearer
I'm an Iranian, we buy and sell cryptocurrency on a daily basis. There is no hard ban on Bitcoin or crypto. Most that government does is warn you not to and prevent financial institutions to deal in crypto. OTC market, through websites based inside or outside iran and in telegram groups and channels are thriving.
I'm interested, what did they say specifically?
I was more referring to the engine routinely pooing the bed during moves >0.5%, but in a BGD scenario that's absolutely possible. Futures would almost certainly pass $10K if we had a 3% candle on spot. 
They use the same "around the internet" ad network used all over the internet. Occasionally watering hole attacks slip through. But thats really responsbility of  ad network to screen ads not the website they appear on.. 
I read all news and I'm source agnostic. if it's about bitcoin and it's generating traffic, I'm paying attention to it.
I thought casual retail investors were important? or not anymore?
Oh I totally agree, especially to people who consider 10M pocket change.
Exactly.

Until of course you deal with miners or exchanges itself that get their income in BTC. I think those are the only ones that don't need to cover the price on exchange. All the others just give you possibility to cut off Banks and exchanges from your side of transaction.
Either you bought it earlier or just before the transaction.

I'm just agreeing that OTC transaction can be completely out of the market or it can affect the market the same way that big player would buy on exchange.

It's that big player goes to OTC also because he doesn't want to deal with exchange, he puts money on the table and get coins on ledger. No third party risk.
You mean everyone (cough cough /u/ellahammadaoui) likes to just make up stories and post them on the daily? Who would-a thought people would do that? Gosh, I wonder what else on here is totally made up nonsense. :)

edit: I take this back. See edit above. 
for people in the US who want to margin trade but don't trust bitmex, is there a better option than Kraken?
I’m from US. I’ve been told you can margin trade on mex in US but its against their rules.

Just going to wait for binance to allow margin trading and stick with kraken for now 
December was an anomaly, the market conditions are far from that right now as the market is inherently bearish, and will continue to be so until we manage to close a few candles above the weekly bbands. The premium just screams market irrationality.
makes sense
Didnt we defend 9k over this weekend?
I don't know what is going on there.  I'm just glad the BCH price tripled in a few weeks and I managed to sell the rest of mine.  Maybe it will pump again, but I just have no idea at this point.
It made it out of the waste bin? I put you in charge to keep an eye on it.

I dont enjoy trading it, bit stressful 
I'm not biased in the slightest. I desperately want the bull market. Right now all that matters is the evidence, picking out positive news in the media is not evidence of anything apart from the fact that you've found positive media articles...that's it. 

everything now still points to medium term downtrending, long term uptrending. 
The last 2 times we had 4 continous red candles we had 1 weak green candle and another big slump
it's usually 3 days of blood before a bounce play, but its been a slow bleed this time. Signs of bearishness. I do expect a bounce soon enough though.
yep that's good advice, agreed
Thanks!
You think the probability of the price going to $3K is the same as $100 or $1?  You are lost.   And you permabulls are perpetually delusional.
if you buy at 2$ and it drops further to 1$ you lose 50% of your money even though you got the bottom right within 1$


cool yea i dig Novogratz

If you ask me BTC isn't worth $1k, but I'm not the one deciding this...
dude... what is this? The market gives you one last chance to drop your bags??  Come on. Do better
Take this nonsense to CC or ETHTrader. 

Also, your statement doesn't make sense. How can there always be one last time? Do you even logic, bro?
oh they gonna hype the shit outta this coin.
anyone here got a good crypto calendar site?  The one I'm using doesnt work well


The resistance here @9080 seems high, below that comes 8980 that was rejected hard the last time. Will keep an eye on it and hope you are right.
I see what you did hare.

Fake screenshots are sort of my expertise.

I'm so tempted to call out the big faker but I'm not supposed to do that anymore. I'm reformed.
For sure. There are reputable traders here and disreputable ones. Only the frequent observer can take note of who's who.
10% bounce is weak now?
Sept 2017 low here: https://www.tradingview.com/x/etZBXIu2/

It's crossed a number of times so I generally don't consider it valid, but it keeps lining up as resistance/support, +/- 0.5%
I believe mine was originally drawn on the 4H. It's been locked since then 
Shame on me
The bubble was caused by FOMO and speculation, not because Bitcoin was better in December than it is now, there's not a "fair" or real price for these assets, current prices are 90-99% speculative.

There was a good article in medium just yesterday about the similarities between the growth of the internet in its early days and crypto, we're in 1994 apparently.
I know someone who just yesterday bought his first coins, and I know cause I bought them for him, and this happens every day around the world.

Who would leave the market for good? You can liquidate all of your positions, for only for speculative reasons, only to re enter the market at a lower price. Who would leave a market so profitable at such an early stage?

I'm not saying NYSE is a good or a bad thing or it'll make the price skyrocket, but it certainly proves there's mainstream interest among a sector that had so far trashed crypto for the most part, but now they see potential, at least to make money trading them.
It's deflated because of the big dumps we've seen over the past few months.  The dumps are clearly inorganic.  We see massive market sells for brief bursts. There's no reason to do that.  If someone earnestly wanted to sell a large block of Bitcoin, they would do it over time with limit orders or OTC to get the best price, not dump it and get the lowest possible price.  If you can't see that, I can't help you.

The big green candles did follow the announcement that Soros and Rockefeller are getting into the game.  Could also have been a dumper covering. Like the big red candles, they were clearly the result of one or a few whales.  The difference is that for someone who wants the price to go up to buy a bunch and drive it up is extremely rational.  Driving the price down and losing money is emotional, toddler-like behavior that works temporarily.  But it only moves the price, not the market.

Bitcoin devs have always delivered. I see no reason why they would stop now. Bitcoin is backed by the most powerful cryptographic network the world has ever seen. The network has 50x as much computing power as all of AWS.  It's mind boggling. No alt will be able to offer that level of security and stability.

If I had been paid in Bitcoin throughout 2017 and before, December-April would not bother me one bit.  In fact, I have been buying Bitcoin for longer than that so it really doesn't bother me one bit.  Once you're up so far, the only regret you have is having put so much in your traditional investments and not having bought more Bitcoin.

Cheers.  Good luck. Get yourself a little Bitcoin just in case I'm right.
See things broadly the same, just wouldn't rule out meeting enough resistance to send us back down for a few days, perhaps even far enough to liquidate highly-leveraged longs opening not too far north of where we are.
I think that they don't have a choice. Imagine if buffet, Gates and other powerful people would say 'BTC is the future'. People would FOMO in and lose a lot on first retrace. Fortunes would be lost by average people and those who said BTC is the future would be the one to blame.

Those guys are just protecting themselves.
so I suppose you can get your parents and their friends to do your bidding?  Give you money, invest, then increase your (and their) wealth 10,000x?
You make it sound easy, right?  Just a couple of lucky retards.. you're surely smarter than them.

Didnt gates score a perfect SAT and get into harvard?  Total tard, man.

Dubya scored a 1200.. whats the matter his family didnt have the connections to 'rig the system' like gates?



No, but it also doesn't mean that just because they're bearish or neutral or just couldn't give af that they're moronic or assholes or [insert insult]. They're just people who, when asked, give there opinions. I don't think they're being particularly deceitful or malicious about it.
But low market cap poor liquidity alts when they pump do not influence btc price, clearly bch pumping influences btc's price how can anyone deny that. 

Maybe you are just getting downvoted for being rude and caustic in how you express your opinion.  You are also attacking bidoun for just expressing his idea.  People should be able to share their ideas here, that's how we learn from one another and expand our minds.  You don't learn from an echo chamber; that's how you get burned badly in crypto.
/u/gypsytoy slaying bch people = giving my day that lil cherry on top.
are you so mad at all the development that bch has and legacy doesn't? poor little boy.
[removed]
15-20% in alts for me, I think at least half your holding should be BTC 
That’s got nothing to do with what I said
I don't think you need to be all that well educated on the topic to know that big blocks cause issues. Are they overcome-able? Maybe. But the issues exist and people who claim that big blocks have absolutely no trade-offs are just lying or clueless.

Anyhow thanks for reading anyhow, nice to know some reasonable eyes glanced it over. Cheers!
Yeah that's what I don't understand. I'm not the most well-educated on these topics but I certainly know what I'm talking about to some reasonable degree -- enough to qualify me to have the conversation to begin with, I think. Also, I'm almost always coming at it from a good faith effort to bridge the gap and find common ground or find better understanding of both sides. However, no matter how cordial and articulate I am, I'm still called a shill, troll, coretard or whatever. 
yes.. sold a lot at 16K. now i'm adding a lot. I have time
You must be dutch
You're surprised that a newspaper is reporting new financial news?

Or you classify that as media buzz? Maybe you're new and weren't around in December and January. 
How much are you betting? :)

Btw: Buffet and Gates only say those things because they are heavily ingrained in the existing fiat economy. Most likely they are asked to have these options by people they are very close with.

If Gates *really* wanted to short Bitcoin to zero he already would have.

If you have currently lost money and are pissed then I would suggest to check you are happy with the amount of coins you hold and then wait. 6-9 months will be happy days again
I laughed
Nice write up, and I agree. Bitcoin being a flight to safety asset will probably be a self-fulfilling prophecy. If enough people use it as one, it literally becomes one. 

It's just so obvious if you've spent time around super-wealthy people that many of them are control freaks who measure their personal worth in personal wealth. If you can show a control freak how to reduce their exposure to something that they haven't been able to control (inflation, geopolitical events), they are going to be interested. 

edit for wording
My strategy now is I'll keep replying to the thread that I opened the position on.  And if I have anything particular updates to say later I'll make a fresh post and link back to the thread that opened the position.
Position closed with success



* Opening value: 9,664.00

* Average value: 9,664.00

* Closing value: 9,278.50

* Leverage: 10.00X

* Stack: 25.00%

* PnL: 3.86%

Open positions can be checked @ [BitcoinMarkets Open Positions](http://bitcoinmarkets.atwebpages.com/)


The one without the stack caused an error and was discarded.
Will have to redo my syntax parser to allow some parameters to be missing.

That will allow to handle commands with just leverage (and assume 100% stack), just stack (and assume 1X as leverage) and so on


That is on purpose, the main post should be the one with the justification of the position. This allows to add the syntax in a comment if you forget.
It's just play money, but i hate to lose... And having to explain to the wife i stopped trading because i lost it all makes me hate losing even more :)

The bot still has a long way to go, but i'm happy people are using it even with all the bugs. My first target is always put the code to work, then i can optimize it and make it better. Not the best way to do it, but it works for me.
there is no mobile app on android for kraken anyway so it's not a big problem for me. 
I'm not a good person to ask about the possible impact of various news events on the market. 

I've seen the bitcoin market dump following "good" news and pump following "bad" news.

I've seen the market stay completely sideways when something I'd consider to be "significant" comes out, and I've seen it lose it's mind when something I'd consider to be completely "benign" is revealed. 

It's easy to ascribe price movement to market events, but it's also a waste of time in my opinion. 

Did the market drop from $10,000 to $9,000 because Gates and Buffet have been spouting off about how bitcoin is "rat poison" and "they'd short it if they could"? Or did it drop because a popular Chinese food chain put "sell all your bitcoin" in their fortune cookies?

When you divorce yourself from the **cause** of a move and focus on the **move itself**, then all that matters is what the market is doing. Not why it's doing it. 
Yep, exactly. Let's see what happens. Exciting times ahead!
Yup, lost like $50 on entry price trying to buy in on that break out. Got lucky to catch it while it was still going up.
Im just having fun.  Going to be a long day watching 9300 fight 9200 round 17.  
Yeah,  miners just care about paying their bills in fiat and not selling their BTC below the cost of production. Of course they try to sell at the best pricr, but they sure as shit aren’t shorting to reduce exposure imo
oh for sure, all good I'm just curious, so hope you don't mind a few more questions. where would you buy them?
> I wonder what else on here is totally made up nonsense.

Everything I've written, sorry fam
meant Stop losses, liquidation more of bitmex lexicon.
Right, US have a problem. Finex and mex don't allow you to trade.

Can't help here, I'm from Europe.
Kraken is nice now that the engine actually works.  Some ui annoyances still, and some basic things that they could definitely stand to improve upon...

But overall, I like Kraken.
Somehow I didn't think you're from US. My bad.
It was not tested this weekend. We pumped to 10k on some serious FOMO hopium and subsequently dropped to 9750 on Sunday. We tested 9k twice this week, so if it holds over the weekend, I believe bears will give it up for now.
Yeah the price may go up but it will almost certainly eventually go way down. It's not a viable long term project and nobody, and I mean *nobody*, is transacting on it at the moment.
What?
None of us do 😂 

it's just that winning is addictive 
Yep, that's what I was looking at. Also the macd crossover on the daily. Every macd crossover since ath has led us to a dump. If it's different this time, we're out of the bear market. 
Perma-anything is delusional in markets.
> Is he? 

yes
try 100$

Well... It's called a technical bounce and it's a thing.

I know, this guy's comments are bearish as f... But he's telling the truth in hard way.

/u/gypsytoy this comment is for you also
I think it will become a self full filling prophecy  ( I have no clue how to spell it , sorry) and  price will rise , what are you expecting ?
coinmarketcal.com
I think the resistance is partially due to the buy wall. But I am definitely expecting $9,000 to break downwards. Now for how long it will remain under $9,000, it is hard to tell.
There's a clue in my post. 
stop slinging around false accusations.  
1&#37; bounce. A 10&#37; bounce would get us back to just under $10k.
9120 / 9000 ~ 1.33% ?
Having said that, this might still go up.. Whales decide everything anyways
Shit, I cleared this line loooong time ago...
Thanks for answering, i was right saying I misunderstood your previous comment. 

Just one comment about who would leave the market: people panic selling is one example, people who invested more than they could afford is another, people who have sudden expenses, people who made money and want to cash out. There will be always people leaving the market for many reasons and there will be people who will join the party off course. I just don't think this current run has so much to do with new investors, one reason is the very low volumes compared to the rush in december and the other is coinbase/gdax answers me in a matter of minutes...

But these opinions shall not be tell in this sub as the other friend below correctly stated, sadly. :(
Glad to see you have no doubts at all, i have so much in life...

eg.

> **If** I had been paid in Bitcoin throughout 2017 and before...

No need to quote the rest, the "IF" is enough to make me wonder IF bitcoin is still the **best** way to be paid, whatever the context.

But i understand my words are just dust in the wind, will go back to invest in bonds as, clearly, i am in this sub because i don't own bitcoins.
They could certainly say, "the tech is interesting, but I'm not really sure I can comment on it's viability as an investment opportunity one way or the other." 
Hey don't have to say anything at all.
My parents and their friends weren't rich, and I'm very proud of that fact.  If they were, I wouldn't try to rope them into my mutual fund, and if I did do that, I certainly wouldn't give myself most of the shares for free.  Buffett's initial investors would have been better off buying index funds.  That's just the fact, Jack.  The numbers don't lie. Berkshire Hathaway is a hyped-up mutual fund and nothing more.

Gates' SAT score is irrelevant.  I personally know more than a handful of people who accomplished that, and some of them are pretty dumb.  Bottom line is that Gates has never invented anything.  He bought DOS, stole Windows, and sold his way into corporate America.  He's a good businessman. In that sense, I have a lot more respect for him than for that huckster from Omaha and his hyped-up ponzi scheme.

I'm surprised Duhbya scored that high, but I don't see the relevance.
> But low market cap poor liquidity alts when they pump do not influence btc price, clearly bch pumping influences btc's price how can anyone deny that.

How can you claim this? What is your supporting evidence other than "BCH is going up, therefore it is driving the market". Can you put forth a reasonable deductive argument that supports this claim? So far you haven't, you're just claiming it's true.

*post hoc ergo propter hoc*
> All low market cap / poor liquidity alts do this. This is not new and it doesn't say much about who's "leading". These coins are simply easy to pump and dump and market makers take advantage of this to various degrees depending on what the overall market is doing. Also, like I said, completely unwarranted hype over the upcoming fork gives people a narrative to latch on to. The truth is that the fork is absolutely meaningless given the state of BCH.

This is what I said. What in here is rude or caustic? For examples of rude and caustic, look to the poster below who is making personal attacks (and assumptions) about my wins/losses relative to BTC and BCH. What am I saying above that fits this description? I'm not being rude to /u/bidoun, I'm simply expressing my view somewhat sarcastically (but that comment was upvoted, the one that was downvoted was not sarcastic, it was straightforward description).
I'm the hero this sub deserves and also the one it needs.
Such as what? A bigger block limit that isn't even close to being taken advantage of?

Instead of ad-homs, how about putting forth an actual substantive argument?
Seems reasonable 
So is this some sort of a zen thing? 'Let go of profits and material possessions to achieve enlightenment'? Or what's so idiotic about making more money?
No, you're absolutely right, but I also ventured into the comments in which someone referred to thin blocks. I'd never heard about those so I'm currently reading up on Graphene blocks. 

Other than that I do completely agree with your point that bigger blocks as for now are (disclaimer: most likely) not the best solution, and will probably prove to be ineffective. 

Then again, the whole BTC/BCH debate has become so emotionally laden, I think I've become more sceptical in an actual open-minded debate taking place on these topics because everyone has become extremely entrenched in their preferential side's views. 

Therefore I just stick with drawing lines on the charts. 


As it turns out I was around in since January, January 2013 that is. So the audacity of people like you to disregard making the FrontPage of the New York Times like that is kind of adorable.
I've been where you were at buddy sentiment wise as recent as a month ago and I've been in crypto since 2013. My sentiment recently changed when I realized there are people and institutions out there way wealthier and smarter than myself buying a lot of bitcoins. There are reasons why OTC sales are up and exchanges like Gemini and Coinbase (soon) are selling blocks. Am I super bullish short term? No. Long term yes. While I trade alts to get my BTC stack up, the current price of BTC is a non factor for me since I believe it will be much higher in the future. 
Agreed. They are also highly susceptible to fomo. I used to work on Wall Street, now I work in Hollywood. It's crazy how similar the behavior is at the higher end of the earnings scale. These people are incredibly greedy without realizing why they even want certain things.
[deleted]
I thought so. It should work as you said here.

Best way is to take like this, parse the line with ! with: *x is lev, <num> or $<num> is entry, *% is stack, <alpha>[aplha-num] is trading pair + additional search for 'close', 'open' and 'add' (if not found then assume open). You can drop order in the syntax with this.
But this makes a lot of mess, cause look at chevy comment, someone responded with opening new position and you replied higher to somebody else.

Bot should respond to post with command.
Don't worry, I've made some good gains, then had a 3 month losing streak that killed more than 50% of my entire stack, was one trade to actually call quit. It was good trade, bounce from bottom, almost at ATH now.
> My first target is always put the code to work, then i can optimize it and make it better. Not the best way to do it, but it works for me.

No that *is* the best way.  Otherwise you risk perfecting some detail that didn't matter, or it turns out you made a wrong turn somewhere completely.  The best way to kill a project is to protect it from its users.
But you can (or could if it works still, didn't use it for a while) use 'tabtrader',  it has support for kraken but not for bitmex.
Hi, Kraken support here! Unfortunately we do not have an Android app and have no immediate plans to release one at this time. This may change, however, in the future and we'll be certain to announce it! -- Meanwhile, there are unofficial android apps that will take the API key, but we cannot attest to the trustworthiness of these. 
Fair enough. I think we're primarily in agreement on this front. Public interest historically has spiked during this conference, though, so you could almost put this into the category of taking a riskier entry due to the potential inability to get any entry during a violent move up. Not really enough to justify that, though, especially since there's 4 days between now and then and the market will likely be somewhere completely different by then.

Plus we're both already long. 
I wish I knew how many BTC were sold the day they were mined. Meaning, what % of newly mined coins each day are sold. Logically, it should be a large % to cover costs. My understanding is that most miners are paid by their pools and the pools have relationships with OTC desks. Any thoughts? /u/v4mpyre asking you too
My case, I did market buy, they did market sell. No affect on the market.

Other case, someone held for a long time and now wants to cash out. Buy affect was long time ago, sell pressure is now.

Other way around. I want to buy, they do a market buy and we see price going up.

Or they bought long time ago and selling their stack, no buy pressure on the market.
Stops and liquidations are two different things and both are relevant to both exchanges. Liquidations are when your margin runs below your maintenance requirement and your position is automatically closed by the exchange (MEX or BFX). Stops are user-placed orders that execute (and ostensibly close your position) when the price triggers the stop. 

Either way, even if you meant stop losses. How did you determine that a bunch of stops got hit? Still sounds like you're just making stuff up, no offense. The price hasn't even bounced yet.
Haha what gave you the feeling I was from out of the states? 

My choice of language?

TBH I don't care. I'm here for gains.
calling this a technical bounce is very different from saying the market gives you one last chance to drop your bags, which is a logical fallacy: the last time it gives you a chance, it doesnt gove you an additional chance anymore

Point being that this guy u/btcqq has some things to say that are worth saying, but says them in a ridiculous fashion. He was raging about going all-in 2 weeks ago and now he’s calling for 1.6k
the price moved 20% last year during the event
then came right back down on the last day of the event.
I only did regression on that one year 2017.

Do regression back another year see if theres a pattern maybe
If you're short I'd cover before the event starts.



I have the bottom of our channel @9000 more or less, slightly ascending. It held the last drop to 8980.
Will probably set a profit stop there and see if it breaks or not.

We haven't been bellow that line for long after April 20 so it will take time to break. 
I guess you were right!
Stops at breakeven and will let this one ride. Maybe add some in this first bounce if it gets above 8950 no?
Oh, lol. I didn't even catch that. Yes, pyro-maniacal hares have seemingly learned their lesson. Though I notice the still post the same screenshots on /r/CC from time to time.
Such as what?
Yeah that'd be dope.
Working on different timescales. I was talking about the bounce from 9k up to 10k the first time.
I probably should have, but every time I'm about to, we bounce right off the sucker. It's the damnedest thing.
Awesome exchange of ideas, dudes. I'm impressed. Personally, I think the new investors that have entered the space have been larger net-worth individuals who are using OTC desks to accumulate. They are also using custodial services to store their bitcoin. 

THESE are the new buyers imo, and Joe Six-pack will follow (eventually):

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-09/bunkers-for-the-wealthy-are-said-to-hoard-10-billion-of-bitcoin
No problem.

Agreed there are plenty of reasons to cash out, but those people will be back eventually, no one has lost faith on crypto or realized it's a scam/it's not going anywhere/has no potential.

Can't opinions be told be told because this is a trading sub and those are the rules or because general quality is low and debating is rare?
Well, you asked if it was the best way to be paid, and since you were talking about salary, it seems reasonable to assume I had been paid in Bitcoin throughout the year, not starting in December.  Yes, Bitcoin is the best way to be paid.  IF you happen to take one month of salary at an all-time high and can't wait a few months for the next all-time high (coming soon!), then it wouldn't have worked out for you. 

But I was talking more about ease-of-use and privacy issues anyway.  Why should I sign up for PayPal or pay some credit card processor, let them sell my data, pay high fees, etc when I can just tap phones and get Bitcoin cheaply (1/10 the price of a credit card and 1/50th the price of PayPal) and without having my privacy invaded?  Yes, I'd rather be paid in Bitcoin if that was your question.
Don't you think that there would be a lot of people who will think that's the same as 'BTC is the future'?
Gates' SAT score is irrelevant. 

not irrelevant to harvard, apparently.
he also improved the pancake sort in 1979 without the help of modern supercomputers

https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~christos/papers/Bounds%20For%20Sorting%20By%20Prefix%20Reversal.pdf



real retard man.  Oh he invented MSFT and is worth 91 billion.. and was revered by the early retards at microsoft, many of whom had phds in computer science, astrophysics, from stanford, mit, harvard, etc.

he had em all fooled.

He's also fooled the entire internet:

https://www.quora.com/How-intelligent-is-Bill-Gates



It is true that correlation does not imply causation,  I should have said " once again bch/btc ratio going up is a good indicator that btc/usd will rise". 
No. Bitcoin your plug into the crypto market and it will continue to rise with it. It’s the flagship crypto with the largest network and infrastructure. It’s also the default crypto reserve currency. Anyone who is bullish on crypto in general should have some Bitcoin as it’s the safest exposure to the broader market. My message was straight forward, if you don’t get it you’re either new to the market, an idiot, or both 
Lol, that's a wise attitude to carry. 

The debate between BCH and BTC is not symmetrical in my view. BCH proponents, for the most part (from my point of view), are in denial of the existence of challenges associated with big blocks. 

It's one thing to say everything will likely be fine or will be fine for reasons A, B and C. But most of these people are just flat-out denying that big blocks have their issues and that scaling a blockchain on-chain, even if possible, is obviously highly-inefficient and it's strange to think that coffee purchases need to be stored on a blockchain across every node. They also hate Segwit for no apparent reason except "it's too complicated! Not Satoshi's VISION^TM !! Arghhh!" - as if that makes any sense. 

They also cry conspiracy theories constantly without any evidence and make Greg and Adam out to be Satan's henchmen. (in reality, Greg is one of the most talented and committed devs in the space and doesn't deserve to be a moving target in all of this). Beyond that, the project is frontrun by Roger and Craig, both of who are compelete scumbags, along with a handful of other shady characters. This obviously is unfair to honest BCH community members but it does demonstrate the style of promotion that's generally applied by promoters. 
Again, a newspaper reports news which will grab attention...which that story would, I am shocked you are so surprised and think it's an amazing feat. 

However, seems I was correct in saying down BTC goes...contrary to the belief of you and others, how funny!
I see the facts as they are, I don't ride on emotion.  

The facts are crypto is declining and has been for many months now.  

There is absolutely no guarantee that institutions will be buying in en masse, there is also no guarantee that they are right if they do so, I point to the many financial crashes of the past.  
Position saved with success.

There are some trickier ones like [-sl, sl, stop] xxxx.
That should make the add command for leverage also be changed from add -lev xxx% to just add xxx%

Will need an update from Python 101 to Python 102 for this one and implement regex :)

But nothing i can't handle with a bit of time. Then people can start using the bot to test all this variables so we can kick the bugs out.
No, that was actually my comment with the syntax that triggered chewy's position to be added. 

Only i can do that, the rest of he users only can do that if the main post is theirs.
Think about them like a company. They need to sell enough to cover expenses and leave the rest for investments. Whether they sell the rest and leave fiat or sell some % of what is left is probably written in company policy.
It is probably far less than you expect. Miners get energy for damn near free. I would bet a hefty amount that the largest wallets belong to BitMain
Usually when some support/resistance is breached while a 300+ wall was sitting and gets eaten, i go and see almost the same amount of BTC long/short reflected on datamish.com. This time when dipped below 9k, longs didn't decrease, but are gradually increasing since then 
No, just messed some things up in my head. Too many people, too many countries, thought you're also from Europe.
It's weird but, I'd been imagining you as a chinese dude.
I saw his comments, he's just being harsh but I can't say he's talking bs.

Technical bounce is actually the last time you can quit your position before further decline, so I don't get why you guys think it's illogical.
!short XBTUSD close 9102

> Stops at breakeven and will let this one ride.

If I were you, I would only let it ride so long I am monitoring the market at all times.

If I couldn't do it, yest setting SL at break even isn't a bad idea at all.
Somebody didn't clear that line from his bot? :D
it's spoofy the line that acts as resistance or support whenever it wants
It could be for sure, i think many under 60 are interested in Crypto in these days. Bitcoin hitting 20K was a serious indicator and, although in a bubble, everyone noticed it and made their own ideas. For sure many are seeing this deflation as a nice point to re-enter the market, myself i am one of these. Just don't think we are done with the bear market yet. And, if im wrong and next bull run just started, there will be another deflation later. Bitcoin price has been growing in bubbles since inception, the day it will stop either we'll have reached stability or the bottom, imo.
You shall never question Bitcoin and the price going up!

Seriously, you can post whatever you like (within rules) but bearish or skeptic comments are easily and mostly downvoted.
Then take out the part of "the tech is certainly interesting." 
OK so Bill Gates is a smart guy. He still made his fortune by ramming inferior software that he didn't write down corporate America's throat, and he's still wrong about Bitcoin.
You said:

>But low market cap poor liquidity alts when they pump do not influence btc price, clearly bch pumping influences btc's price how can anyone deny that.

This is not true. You can't separate BCH from the rest of alts just because you want to think that it's driving the market. As I said, this plays out the same way with ETH, LTC, XRP, XMR, etc. Your claim is not backed up by evidence. It's also not exactly clear what starts pumping first, given that a pump is preceded by clearing out liquidity on the sell side, either through buying the book or pulling orders off the book. It's perfectly plausible that traders are watching BTC books and when they see the pump starting, they immediately take long positions in alts, in order to catch the increased volatility. 

Again, sorry but what you're saying it not based on any sort of tangible evidence as far as I can tell. You're just noting vague behavior of BCH and saying (for no reason) that BTC is being led (by a coin that has much less liquidity, use and market cap). The narrative doesn't make sense. It's not even a top 3 coin and it's a garbage project that's only being used as a pump-n-dump scheme by the likes of Roger and Jihan (and their henchmen). 
 
> Anyone who is bullish on crypto in general should have some Bitcoin as it’s the safest exposure to the broader market.

Why? An even spread of top 20 (or top 100, or top 1000) cryptos would have netted you a better return than Bitcoin with just a few hours now and then dedicated to maintaining the portfolio.

I do get your message, it just happens to be wrong. As I said, numbers disagree with you. If you disagree with the numbers... well, that's cool, but calling people stupid simply because they base their decisions on facts rather than blind faith is... funny. 
Here's an article with plenty of evidence on the Adam Back, Greg Maxwell, and Theymos claims. 

https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43

Also check out the all time top post of btc subreddit for more evidence of censorship. 
I never ever said BTC wasn't going down. I called you out on your bullshit statement that there wasn't media buzz precisely the day it makes the frontpage of the NYT.

> I am shocked you are so surprised and think it's an amazing feat.

You are shocked simply because you are a noob, which is fine. But for many of us that have seen this project go from a mocked tiny little irrelevant open source project on some corner of the internet to experiencing a 14400% ROI in just 5 years and seeing it featured in the NYT it's still a pretty surreal experience as you can imagine. I invite you to educate yourself and see what we where saying back in the day in this same subreddits, you can start during the 2014 bitcoin Ice Age. Good luck.

Ok, there's a mess in his post, cause somebody replied with close, then with open and you replied like randomly there.

I will still think that you should always reply to the post that triggered the bot.
That makes sense. I wonder how much of the daily mined supply is being sold (to the market or OTC) vs how much is being held. And if a substantial portion are being held, what are the motivating factors that influence that decision and what events could unfold which would change those factors.

edit clarity
I just realized I misread your original comment. I thought you were saying that bears (shorts) got liquidated but you said they *didn't* get liquidated. My bad, bro. I'll edit my comment above.
Asian???!?! 

Nope, I’m the definition of the typical white young adult ( country club, gym rat, ect) 
Technical bounces are different than what he said.

He said the market always gives you anchance to drop your bags, but if you buy the top of a technical bounce, this would not be the case
Added 50% @8989. All in with an avg entry around 9050.
Will be keeping an eye on the prices but have stop losses just in case something weird happens.
Sweated a bit when that order went in and it went up to test 9k.

Oh look what happened again: https://www.tradingview.com/x/KuqOkUvh/

/u/L14dy
I just know people who will take everything they say as a buy signal until it's not 'no, don't buy, it's ponzi'. And I can bet there's a lot of them.
I agree with what you say about the possible explanation of players seeing upmove in btc but decide to take positions in alts since they pump more, totally legit. 

Regarding bch being a garbage project I will have to disagree. For me btc and bch are both part of the bitcoin experiment, bch forked for a reason ( to try and solve scalability issues by experimenting with large blocks), when bch forked everyone received btc received bch for free. Bch is not a scammy ico that promised the world to everyone and asked for a few millions in funding. Yes big actors are promoting bch and probably influencing its price, obviously since bch is supported by miners and mining happens to be a profitable activity. For me Bitcoin is an ecosystem made up of users, developers and miners and I am more than happy that miners are experimenting with large blocks to scale bitcoin and giving the product of their experiment to every btc holder. 

The only people hating bitcoin cash probably did not really think about the whole story for more than 10 minutes OR are greedy people that see bch as a threat to btc's price going to the "moon". Whilst it is true that having two projects claiming to be Bitcoin might scare away investors/speculators from btc, I don't really care and any long term believer  in crypto currencies shouldn't either, if anything a long term believe should be excited about new experiments in the Bitcoin experiment.


Okay, I read it (actually I'd already read it, but gave it another once-over). I don't find it compelling at all. Censorship =/= moderation. I think this point of contention will not get settled between the two sides. One side thinks that XT and BCH *are/were* Bitcoin and one side says they're not. I'm certainly of the side that says they're not. They're contentious forks, in other words they're alts. I fully understand the moderation efforts or /r/Bitcoin and don't understand why BCH supporters think this is "censorship". Subreddits have rules and it's the mods job to enforce those rules. This is the equivalent of discussing Nintedo related topics on XBox subreddit. It doesn't belong, if you want to discuss Nintendo, use the appropriate sub or make your own. I just don't see what the issue is and I **certainly** don't see why it's been turned into this big deal. There are plenty of other forums and resources out there for alts, including BCash.
Except when it's my user triggering the command, otherwise it will look like i was the one issuing the command. Already added this issue to the ToDo list
I think because the shit you say is like a caricature out of a movie, like some of your shit-talking Americanisms (which by the way I love)  And you said it in a way that sounded like a chinese guy I knew who would imitate that.  So I guess my brain just reused an image for you.

I'm American too btw, but I live in Europe (Asia before this).
typical white young adult (51%+) is female btw, hello miss.

You won't get a chance to drop bags with the same price but there's always next technical bounce and you can sell at the top of it and not panic sell on the bottom.

So technically he's right. He never said you will have a chance to break even. He said you'll have a chance to drop them, and I understand it this way. Wait out, sell on the bounce and take smaller loss.
As I told ya. :)  However, I am on the wrong side of this.

Can you please update my position on the website as I have added new stack. We just need to add the average price to the position which is 8921. 

Thanks.
well done
> Regarding bch being a garbage project I will have to disagree. For me btc and bch are both part of the bitcoin experiment, bch forked for a reason ( to try and solve scalability issues by experimenting with large blocks), when bch forked everyone received btc received bch for free. Bch is not a scammy ico that promised the world to everyone and asked for a few millions in funding. Yes big actors are promoting bch and probably influencing its price, obviously since bch is supported by miners and mining happens to be a profitable activity. For me Bitcoin is an ecosystem made up of users, developers and miners and I am more than happy that miners are experimenting with large blocks to scale bitcoin and giving the product of their experiment to every btc holder.

I agree that the fork itself is not a scam (it's just a piece of software). It's the opportunist promoters that are scammers. 

>The only people hating bitcoin cash probably did not really think about the whole story for more than 10 minutes OR are greedy people that see bch as a threat to btc's price going to the "moon". Whilst it is true that having two projects claiming to be Bitcoin might scare away investors/speculators from btc, I don't really care and any long term believer in crypto currencies shouldn't either, if anything a long term believe should be excited about new experiments in the Bitcoin experiment.

No, this is not why. BCH is an alt. It didn't capture the consensus network. It's the contentious chain. It's not "Bitcoin," it's a Bitcoin alt. There's really no plausible way to re-frame this to call BCH Bitcoin. Bitcoin refers to the consensus chain. If BCH had captured the network around Aug first, then *it would be Bitcoin*, but that didn't happen.
I got banned from Bitcoin for asking questions about lightning network. I didn't even mention Bitcoin Cash, and they banned me permanently for disagreeing with them.

Moderation like that is censorship. There's plenty of evidence for removing posts that doesn't align with their narrative and using vote manipulation techniques (See the top post in btc)

Also why shouldn't you be able to discuss multiple clients? Bitcoin Cash has multiple clients you can run. 

Different clients are a way for miners to signal support and it's helpful to have an open discussion about pros and cons.

Segwit was a malicious fork. UASF User activated soft fork. It was only supported by miners because they were promised a 2x which was renegged on. 

Miners should be the ones to signal since they have the most economics incentive to.
You can add some info to this action, or reply to other comment only then. Otherwise it really should reply to the command and not 'some random post'.

Updated your position. Being on the wrong side of this sucks... I felt that way with a short from 8100 on the run to 9750, managed to close that one at 9150 but even so it was a hard hit.

This should bounce the latest around 8400... At least there is where i have a support line that seems to be able to hold this. The only problem is if longs start closing in cascade...

Have any idea when to bail? (If this doesn't bounce like crazy of course)
There's evidence for removing trolls, shills and astro-turfers but I haven't seen what you're describing. Actually I've seen lots of dissent that has not been removed or /r/Bitcoin. Including several of my own comments critical of key members and teams and discussing block size increases.

No offense, but I don't find these anecdotes all that credible. Do you have reference to the comment you got banned for? Based on my own experience, I would be surprised if there wasn't good reason for the ban but I can't make a judgement based on absolutely no tangible evidence, just an anecdote from a BCH supporter.

Multiple clients that run on the same chain (same rules) are fine. BCH is a different chain.

> Segwit was a malicious fork.

What? How? It's a soft fork and what's malicious about it?

>It was only supported by miners because they were promised a 2x which was renegged on.

That's an interesting version of history but isn't really true. 2x was frontrun in a malicious way, not Segwit.
In the future i'll probably just tell the user to issue the correct command instead of adding the command myself. 
When i can track the edited posts this issue will not happen so often because users will then correct the main post.
I first left America as a hot headed twenty-something who vowed to leave if Bush was reelected.

Hey mate thanks for updating, well the position is now closed. I am on the short side now. And I think this thing will continue heading downwards hard. I have a feeling, just like our second rejection from 11.7K. 
Here's what got me banned:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8d08cu/z/dxje5co
And here's proof that I was banned: https://i.imgur.com/br1qGuK.png
Bitcoin XT was a client on the Bitcoin blockchain.

Segwit was not supported and hardly had any signaling power until the Segwit2x agreement came into effect. Once BIP141 passed, they went back on their promise of 2x despite miners signaling support for it heavily. 

Something tells me you haven't been around that long and have been trying to play catch up and are getting the facts completely wrong. 
I agree. For now users don't remember syntax so dropping the order should resolve 90% of issues.
I mean that looks like covert shilling to me. You're also saying things that are blatantly false about 0-conf. It's a bit of an edge case but I could see why the case was made for a ban. 

However, your posts are still there. Are you actually banned or are you just claiming your banned to try to stir up shit? How come your posts weren't removed?
Ah, I see. You probably got banned for low karma, just like in /r/CC. Obviously /r/Bitcoin has a big issue with astroturfers and sockpuppets making new accounts and brigading the sub. Given the comments you were making and the age of your account, I can definitely understand the ban, no offense.

They might offer you a reprieve if you ask though.
Ah, I just read the rest of the context on the exchange you got banned for. That was definitely covert shilling. You ask how LN works (implying that enforcement of LN isn't backed by PoW), person answers you and you say something like "that sounds overly complex and won't work for micropayments" Person corrects you and says actually it's not that complex, end user doesn't need to know anything and microtransactions are made incredibly easy. You then claim that there's a better way and start talking up big blocks (hint hint) without even acknowledging that LN is much better (instant, lower fees, more scalable). Then it goes on from there. 

Previously, I'd just looked at the tail end of the conversation. I can totally understand why they banned you now. That's pretty obviously an attempt at covert shilling, or at least that's probably what the mods saw.
I've been around since March 2013, though there have been spans of time where I've been far too busy to pay attention to anything Bitcoin or crypto relates (now is not one of those times). 

My view on BIP141 and support for Segwit2x is markedly different. It was canceled because of lack of consensus. I don't view this as a malicious act on the part of Segwit proponents. The community simply didn't think 2x was a good idea. (possibly because the community was ready to rid itself of big blockers once and for all, which I sort of agree with. I'm glad BCH exists so that these people can just do their own thing. It certainly took enough time for them to HF and it's better that the two sides are separate imo)

Also, Bitcoin XT is a Bitcoin client but it was attempting to contentiously HF Bitcoin. It wasn't necessarily trying to split the chain but the move was still contentious (and failed) so I can see why related discussion would be banned.
How am I wrong about 0-confs? 

Theres even a script in the white paper that you can calculate the probability of double spends by changing the hash power and number of confirmations
I didn't get banned from CC, just couldn't post until I had enough karma. Just like I had to wait 2 weeks to be able to post in Bitcoin. 


Not and wasn't shilling. There's no proof that LN is a better solution. 
So not agreeing with LN is shilling then. Aka a controlled narrative. I'm just saying there are better options to consider. 
Do you think all hardforks are contentious? Cause they're not. When Satoshi was involved, all the updates were hardforks. 

I think there have been 2 hardforks post Satoshi. There was definitely one to fix a protocol breaking bug. 

The blocksize should have been increased a long time ago with the implementation that Satoshi gave by implementing it to increase every X amount of blocks.

Just because the block size is increased doesn't mean the blocks will be that big, just means it can handle bigger blocks when adoption does pick up. It also buys time to discover other solutions. 

Bitcoin was totally unusable last December. Fees were rediculous and if adoption picks up again, it will still happen. Most transactions aren't using Segwit addresses or wallets and LN is still early stages.


Perhaps I'm just not understanding your comment (or not seeing the entire context of the exchange). What is your claim regarding RBF changing the viability of double spending 0-conf?
Right, but maybe this was a contributing factor in your /r/bitcoin ban?

Again, I can't really make a determination either way on this because I don't know the mods story and I don't know if you made other posts that were more subversive or whatever.
Proof? No, perhaps not. There are a ton of evidence and reasons for why it's better though. You seemed unwilling to cede any ground to reason and started making claims that were simply not true.

I'll hear you out though. Why are big blocks better than LN?
Like what? Bigger blocks? How is that better? It's obviously worse for many reasons that I've already outlined. What makes it better? 

It's not that you didn't agree with LN, it's that your arguments didn't hold water but you stuck to them anyway and then started covertly talking up big blocks (and presumably BCH, which is an alt).
> Do you think all hardforks are contentious? Cause they're not. When Satoshi was involved, all the updates were hardforks.

No I don't. I think the 75% threshold for 2x activation was too low and that number was inflated anyhow.

>The blocksize should have been increased a long time ago with the implementation that Satoshi gave by implementing it to increase every X amount of blocks.

That's clearly not what the majority of the community thought. 

Also, Segwit was a block increase and blocks are not full now. Lots of headroom at the moment.

>Just because the block size is increased doesn't mean the blocks will be that big, just means it can handle bigger blocks when adoption does pick up. It also buys time to discover other solutions.

Other solutions like, i dunno, of-chain payment channels?

>Bitcoin was totally unusable last December. Fees were rediculous and if adoption picks up again, it will still happen. Most transactions aren't using Segwit addresses or wallets and LN is still early stages.

Segwit is increasing steadily and so are LN nodes. This is not a race to some arbitrary goal, this is a project focused on re-inventing money.


You premine a block, send a rbf transaction, then change it and replace it with a higher fee on your premined block so it gets included faster. 

It's very rare in the first place, but that gives a slightly better, albeit unprobabilistic advantage.
How is it worse? Bitcoin Cash did it and it works. Low fees and stable. 
The community isn't consensus. Miners are consensus. If you want a vote, buy mining software.

Community consensus is the market price.

This post shows how easy it would be to increase blocksize:
 https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1347.msg15366#msg15366

Greg Maxwell and theymos are even in it.


I see. 
>How is it worse? Bitcoin Cash did it and it works. Low fees and stable.

Dude, blocks are currently ~80 kb on average. Lol. No wonder it's stable and "low" fee. Absolutely nobody is using it for its purported purpose.

Also, just to narrow our focus. It's not instant. So there's one way in which it's much worse.
> The community isn't consensus. Miners are consensus. If you want a vote, buy mining software.

They're both measures of consensus. One related to PoW, the other related to users and devs.

>Community consensus is the market price.

Which feeds back into mining and developer decisions. Nash equilibrium.

>This post shows how easy it would be to increase blocksize: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1347.msg15366#msg15366

>Greg Maxwell and theymos are even in it.

Lol, what's your point? That discussion is from 2010. The community has moved on and realized that big blocks are problematic.

(no offense, but you're starting to come across as a total shill. You're pedaling unsubstantiated claims about how LN sucks and big blocks are better -- this makes absolutely no sense and is demonstrably wrong in terms of resources and efficiency [and speed + fees])

I'm really starting to understand why you got banned.

What's your beef with LN?
The post continues though 2015. And the point is that bigger block sizes shouldn't even matter. 

You don't understand beef with having to rely on a company to fix bitcoin is concerning?

Wouldn't you rather have a fix in the base protocol and THEN do side chains? Everything in LN is theoretical right now. In theory it will work, but hasn't proved itself. It probably won't be ready for another 2 years and it's been an issue since 2015. Of course a lot of OG bitcoiners want something that works now.
Also, the majority of the community has no clue what they're talking about or how bitcoin even works. Or else they'd realize full non mining nodes aren't needed and pruned nodes are just fine for monitoring transactions. 
> The post continues though 2015. And the point is that bigger block sizes shouldn't even matter.

Except that a lot (most?) devs agree that big blocks *are* a problem at this point in time. Just because Satoshi and others didn't foresee the problem, doesn't mean the problem isn't real.

>You don't understand beef with having to rely on a company to fix bitcoin is concerning?

What? Are you talking about Lightning Labs or what? Not sure what you're referring to.

>Wouldn't you rather have a fix in the base protocol and THEN do side chains?

Lol, dude. LN is not a sidechain. You need to do some more research before you start sounding off on topics you don't understand.

>Everything in LN is theoretical right now.

Uh, no. It's up and running [*today*](lnmainnet.gaben.win). How can you seriously make such a blatantly false claim? 

>In theory it will work, but hasn't proved itself. 

It has proven itself. It's up and running today. Sure, it needs to still scale to the entire world but in that sense Bitcoin hasn't proven itself either. 

At what point will you say "LN has proven itself"??



>It probably won't be ready for another 2 years and it's been an issue since 2015. 

No, clients will probably be out of beta by end of year.


> Of course a lot of OG bitcoiners want something that works now.

Lmao, no bro. There's no demand for using crypto to buy coffee or whatever, as is evidenced by the fact that BCH volume and TXs are in the toilet. People want a hard money system with robust transactional features *tomorrow* not a dumb af band-aid fix today. People don't care, they'll just keep using plastic.

You're wildly misinformed about the state of things if you think LN doesn't work today (including to buy coffee of all things) and is built to scale *for real*. Bumping up blocks continually to reach any sort of scale on BCH is just centralizing af and a horrible design choice. Plus it's not instant and fees will be much higher than LN, which are incredibly negligible.
Honestly, it sounds like you have no idea what you're talking about. You think LN is a sidechain and seemingly don't have a clue how it works. You think big blocks are better than payment channels because... not really sure...? And you think LN is a company apparently (you were kind of vague, so again, not sure). 

I'm not even going to bother getting into a debate about full nodes but I think you're wrong there too but I've gone down too many rabbit holes today.
Most devs don't think block size increases are an issue. Most know it's inevitable and agree it will need to happen in the future.

I say it's theoretical cause there's what, 15 bitcoin on LN and has been on mainnet for like 3 months. Hasn't really been thoroughly tested. And the routing isn't currently efficient. I think LN is an interesting idea and have nothing against it. I just don't think it's a solution to scaling. 

I like how you point out one thing I said wrong and then disregard everything else. Shows you have no clue what you're talking about. 



I've told you why, you just don't know how to read. 

And yeah I was wrong for calling it a side chain. I know how Bitcoin works, but you're right, I don't fully understand LN. The white paper is confusing and the technology behind it is complex. I know how bitcoin works and I trust that over LN as of now. 
> Most devs don't think block size increases are an issue. Most know it's inevitable and agree it will need to happen in the future.

Of course. Block size increases need to happen at some point. **Big** blocks (i.e. scaling completely on chain) definitely does NOT need to happen and is infeasible anyhow. 

>I say it's theoretical cause there's what, 15 bitcoin on LN and has been on mainnet for like 3 months. Hasn't really been thoroughly tested. And the routing isn't currently efficient. I think LN is an interesting idea and have nothing against it. I just don't think it's a solution to scaling.

FUD. What more do you want? Of course networks take time to grow and it's still in beta so use is rather limited. 

How is it not a scaling solution? Please explain how/why, not just claim it to be true without any reasons. From my point of view it's the best scaling solution we have and can easily scale to super small microtransactions (1/1000 of a Satoshi, which is like $0.000000001 or whatever)

>I like how you point out one thing I said wrong and then disregard everything else. Shows you have no clue what you're talking about.

I didn't disregard anything. Literally every comment, I quote every piece of your comment and respond to each individual part. 

You've also had *many* things wrong in this conversation and I've let most of it slide. 

Go ahead though, keep saying LN isn't scaling and that Segwit is a bad idea and that Blockstream this and Core that. It's just FUD. You don't have many or any facts to back up any of your claims. 

Also, the fact that you think LN is a sidechain is quite significant. No wonder you don't think it's a scaling solution. You don't even understand what it is or how it works. And you're claiming people who want full non-mining nodes are the idiots? Uh...
> And yeah I was wrong for calling it a side chain. I know how Bitcoin works, but you're right, I don't fully understand LN. The white paper is confusing and the technology behind it is complex. I know how bitcoin works and I trust that over LN as of now.

At least you can admit that. Props to you. I'm not an expert on it either (not a dev) but I understand the concepts and principles well enough, I think. 

Perhaps you shouldn't dismiss something outright without knowing about it in sufficient detail.

It's you're trying to learn more, and have a decent grasp of Bitcoin tech and tech in general, I'd recommend watching some of talks by Tadge Dryja or roasbeef (not even going to attempt to spell his actual name).
I've watched ton of videos on how it works, but they're not very technical. Also watch most of Andreas Aantopolous' Q&A videos.

I also think bitcoin should work in the base protocol. I do want to use it for micropayments. I do want to use it as an every day currency or to pay my portion of a bill. I also like the idea of streaming payments and think 0-conf is good enough. 
>I've watched ton of videos on how it works, but they're not very technical.

Tadge's talks are *very* technical. Perhaps too technical but he's a great presenter. 

> I also think bitcoin should work in the base protocol. I do want to use it for micropayments. I do want to use it as an every day currency or to pay my portion of a bill. I also like the idea of streaming payments and think 0-conf is good enough.

All of that is bound to be a highly inefficient use of resources. Especially if you're talking real micropayments. I'm still confused as to why you don't think this *might* be better done on LN, especially if you don't understand it all that well. I think if you did you'd think it was pretty great and a much better use of on-chain enforcement than something like 0-conf. 

In my view, LN enables Bitcoin to remain closer to "Satoshi's Vision" than BCH does because it protects the decentralization aspects of the network and scales without having to use 0-conf or pruning or lightweight blocks or whatever. It just abstracts the lesser payments (probably should still pay for a house on chain) into an additional network that's completely enforced by the chain when required. This is not only much safer for Bitcoin decentralization but also just a much smarter design, even if you disregard the importance of decentralization. It's the bees knees.
I'll check out those videos tomorrow. 

I don't think bigger blocks mean more centralized. I believe decentralization only comes from mining nodes. 

The only benefit from non mining nodes is to monitor transactions in a trustless manner, which only really matters for double spending attacks. Even then, a pruned node works just fine. It was always assumed nodes would be ran on large farms and then the rest of users would run SPV nodes. I'd suggest reading "Book of Satoshi". It contains a lot of posts and emails from Satoshi and the initial developers such as Gavin Anderson and Jeff Garzik. Gives a lot of insight behind the intentions of bitcoin.

I also don't think there's any such thing as spam on the network and it can be used many ways. Satoshi Dice and Memo are a couple interesting use cases of this. 

> I don't think bigger blocks mean more centralized. I believe decentralization only comes from mining nodes.

But miners have to contend with bigger blocks as well, not just non-mining nodes.

>The only benefit from non mining nodes is to monitor transactions in a trustless manner, which only really matters for double spending attacks. Even then, a pruned node works just fine.

It contains a lot of posts and emails from Satoshi and the initial developers such as Gavin Anderson and Jeff Garzik. Gives a lot of insight behind the intentions of bitcoin.

Again, miners need to download blocks too.

SPV doesn't verify signature data, it only checks the validity of hash data related to the transaction it's checking for. It can't verify that preceding transactions are valid or that amounts and such weren't changed. It's not a solution and ultimately relies on trust (which is anti-Bitcoin).

I'll check out the book but I'm pretty familiar with the early days and have read much of the Bitcoin talk threads and emails from way back when.

>I also don't think there's any such thing as spam on the network and it can be used many ways. Satoshi Dice and Memo are a couple interesting use cases of this.

Well "spam" is sort of a misnomer in this case. The issue is the perpetual fee market created by larger and larger blocks. Blocks are empty/fees are cheap -> people send more cheap TXs -> Blocks fill up / fees go up -> People complain about fees -> Block size goes up -> (rinse and repeat). This is another reason that chasing fees down by driving block size up doesn't really solve the fundamental problem. Again, using an abstracted payment network is much better design for this purpose and fees don't rise when LN processes more transactions (in fact, the opposite occurs up to a point).
Gotta head to bed. Don't know if we accomplished anything, but it was entertaining lol.

I think if you can afford to buy mining hardware, you likely have a good enough connection to download the blockchain. We're not gonna hit 8MB or 32MB blocks regularly anytime soon, but better to prepare for the future when we do than have to go through another 8 year debate. 

BCH and BTC each have their own experiments going on right now and I think each has an equal claim to the name since they both have the same genesis block. Same with Bitcoin Gold and Diamond. The markets determine which is the real one. Currently that's definitely Bitcoin Core client with both hashrate and market consensus. 

I support both because if Bitcoin fails, it will take the majority of Crypto with it. I trade often, so don't always have a financial stake in them, but I've used BCH more recently because of Memo, Yours.org, and tipping on Reddit/Twitter. I also use it more for gambling cause Dec fees were rediculous
