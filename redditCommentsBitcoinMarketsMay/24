Is it just me, or whenever there's a decent sized dip you can almost bet someone posts something new about Gox or Tether some 20 minutes after?
I have joined the ranks of the bagholders now 
You guys gotta admit that IF, emphasis on IF, MtGox coins being dumped is the primary factor behind the drop from $20k and a medium term bear trend..... there is some real hilarity in that.
Closed my long at breakeven. 

Sitting out for awhile.

EDIT: !long xbtm18 close 9140

A very large triangle no one has really pointed out here yet! I saw it on p Brandt's Twitter, thought it was interesting.
met with an agent to sell one of our houses yesterday and we were talking about the real estate market with the agent, and she complained about how many people have been trying to use Bitcoin as proof of funds when buying a house lately. 

now this was completely unsolicited, I didn't mention Bitcoin or anything like that. 

Just goes to show you how many people's lives got completely changed by Bitcoin. 

The low comments here and on ethtrader is like the social version of bollinger bands

big move coming soon


RSI is stupid oversold on the hourly. Expecting imminent bounce.


...not that it matters much for me since I'm practically dead inside.
!short XBTUSD add 9040 10X 

Saw an opportunity to add to my position on that little bounce a moment ago. 

Edit: the support line that the market has absolutely refused to drop below these past few days finally broke as I have it drawn. There's bound to be some sideways chop over the next 24 hours, but I'm fairly confident the market has chosen it's short term direction. And it's looking like that's down. 

I don't have targets or notions on how far this could go. For now I'm just going to watch and see. And hopefully sleep. 
The buying between 9050-9100 has been pretty commendable, but we keep knocking. Longs only dropped 1% after spiking 5% since this morning. There are a lot of underwater longs opened today. Shorts are actually down from this drop, and about flat for the day. Longs still outnumber shorts 3:2. 

Seems like bulls have to hold 9K here yet again. I suspect a lot of folks that are underwater long today will bail if it falls. 
[removed]
Well, at least volume has improved.
Maybe I've grown immune to these dumps, but even with a leveraged long open, I'm just not worried by this drop. If we go under $8,800 (which I think is unlikely), then that's a different story.

Edit: Adding some thoughts from comment reply for general discussion:

I think in order to drop below $8,800, many bulls would need to close their long positions or flat out move to fiat, and they would have to do so below $9,000. I don't think the current general sentiment (bullish, imo) is ready to sell/close at a loss in the $8,000's, especially since we got so close to $10,000 and it seems like we could be back up there relatively easily. Now, whether bulls are overconfident when they shouldn't be is another question. No TA from me, just macro events + my read of general sentiment + gut + obsessive order book watching.
For me, it's all eyes on the 1d MACD right now. Since we broke down from 20k, every red 1d MACD cross resulted in carnage; but we crossed red a few days ago and now seem to be leveling off, with StochRSI already crossing upwards and shorter timeframes looking more bouncy than droopy as well. If no mad whale shoves us down and we actually see that MACD swing back green again, that'd be yet another confirmation that the market is generally done being bearish, imo. 
Closed my short from 9960 and went 8x long full bitmex stack, gotta go up here or shits going to be ugly.   
Only $100 down and we're below the daily middle bband and the tenkan. We had a 50/200 bullish EMA cross a few days ago, 1d double setting TK cross and daily rsi is reset. Everything is primed for a pump.   
What I want to see is consolidation between 9.4 and 9.9 for the next week.  
If we break down here I think I will sell and take a break.

You know guys, really getting sick of this horizontal support/resistance lines every $200...
What I found surpising with this dump that the whole 1k buy wall on Finex a 9.3k got filled. I expected it is one more spoofy wall. it was not...
5/10/18 AM UPDATE. Hi gang, it’s been a while since I’ve properly done one of these. This is going to be more of a quick recap than a full update as I’m slammed at the office.

Quick recap: In my [4/25/18 post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8eqr52/daily_discussion_wednesday_april_25_2018/dxyoabr/), I laid out four scenarios with four timeframes/price targets. It appears we have stayed generally within the range and landed on the price target/timeline described in the “Sideways Case.” I predicted a price target of $9,350 on May 10. BTC is currently at $9,348 at the time of this posting. In the words of Maxwell Smart: [“Missed it by that much.”]( http://cdn1.thecomeback.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/94/2017/03/missed-it-by-that-much.jpg)

Here’s the [5/10/18 chart with the green arrows](https://www.tradingview.com/x/lG69cPVL/).     
Here’s the [4/25/18 original chart with the same green arrows](https://www.tradingview.com/x/lwP7nHsD/).     

I will return later today to do my next micro forecast of where things could go over the next 7-10 days. I am predicting that a BGD appears within the next 12-24 hours. The conditions for when these occur are becoming easier to track now that we’ve seen them a few times and it appears likely to launch us into the weekend. Stay tuned.
Everyone and their cab driver thought that was going to break up... Herd mentality will lose you a lot of money. 
For the first time since the BGD™, a wild Bart has revealed itself
I'm rather surprised to find that we're still in the same spot as last night, my stops didn't execute, and we're still in an ascending wedge. There is still the case for an ascending triangle as well, which is a converse signal. At this point, all I'm seeing is massively narrowing wedges, absurdly tight BBands, and dropping volume. This screams BxD to me. I guess we'll just have to find out of it's red or green. 

Wedge: https://www.tradingview.com/x/mGXRycUk/  
Triangle: https://www.tradingview.com/x/emnwDSUb/  

I'm currently long still, but stops are break-even now (9380 Jun futures).
June futures finally capitulating a bit. I’m just over here waiting for September futures to do the same so we can finally go up again. 
I almost shorted at 9370, rising wedge and all, but I talked myself out of it.

I'm still playing for a long-term bear market, and losing money. I closed my last short somewhere over 9900.

Might as well open a short at the bottom of this trough see if I can lose more money.

!short xbtusd 9088.2 5X 3%
Let's get it over with and test  8.8k already - this neverland is making me nervous.
Move is coming, place your bets :\) [https://www.tradingview.com/x/Td62DL4v/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Td62DL4v/)

Based on 6h MACD and neutral RSI on larger TF I bet on up tomorrow, but there can be small spike down first. Adding to my long on the dip \- 9420$ Bitmex June.
That... was some expensive slippage on those stop markets.  Damn
I still find it amazing and crazy how such a big price change can happen within less than 1 hour (usually followed by change in sentiment). Who is in buy the dip mode?
Why did ethereum dump at around the same time bitcoin did? 
Why the fuck did Gemini increase their trading fees to a maximum of 1%? Do they want to decrease liquidity? That's how you decrease liquidity. They are now the highest fee schedule proper exchange. Coinbase doesn't really count.
As a scalper I'm treading lightly rn and a bit wary of this drop. Expected to see *some* whiplash back to the mid 8900s by now but we're just kinda sitting here rn. There's a lot of thin air below us here, would be careful.

Edit: Guess the "\*...\*" doesn't get the italicizing done anymore
Really surprised nobody here has yet mentioned last month's Intelligence Squared debate: 
["Bitcoin is more than a bubble and is here to stay."] (https://www.intelligencesquaredus.org/debates/bitcoin-more-bubble-and-here-stay)

If you're not familiar with Intelligence Squared, it's a great series of debates that run on NPR with panels of pretty notable debaters. In this case the pro-bitcoin side includes Patrick Byrne. The debate is outstanding and good points are made on both sides of the motion.
Well Mt Gox still has 136K BTC remaining. So look on the bright side, they can only dump the markets like this another 17 times or so!
Lack of a breakdown in our rally from yesterday is inspiring some confidence that buyers might have returned for another go at 10k. To add, saw some pretty big orders going through this morning on Finex that could indicate that bigger players are entering again to push up the price.  

Currently, I'm looking for the possibility of an IH&S developing in a larger sort of rounded bottom formation, though needless to say this is very premature. The neckline should be somewhere between 9.4-9.5k so those will be interesting to see what price does when(/if) reaching those points.

I'd probably recommend against opening a new long here as direction really isn't clear, but it's looking like upside might be in the books with consensus coming up. 

EDIT: 4H RSI is looking pretty neutral and the MacD, despite having crossed over still has some room to grow. A retrace wouldn't be bad, though ideally, 9.2k holds over the next day or two. Breaking below would necessitate more caution, though we still have the support line we bounced off of at around 9k. 

Happy trading.
We're just about set for our big move. RSI on almost every time frame is around 50. I'd expect us to break up or down sometime in the next 12hr candle, maybe even the start of our new daily.

Edit: I'm about to sleep and staying in fiat. Hopefully the party hasn't started until I get up again but if it has I'm willing to stay out of it. Won't be putting in any stop buys or sells. I think whichever way this moves will determine the direction for the next week to month.
wow the volume on gdax is so low
Let's get some bitcoin market sentiment analysis boys! 

#new poll

https://www.strawpoll.me/15672326

Bearish/bullish/neutral on recent market movements?


----

I need to find my old straw poll where I asked where we'd be for mid April! 

#old polls (don't vote)

Here it is: https://www.strawpoll.me/15259343/r

Looks like majority was right! Between $8k and $12k. This one was asked 3/12/2018

Heres another from 3/28/2018:

https://strawpoll.me/15384358/r

Looks like majority right again but significantly less bulls. 10% less people thought it'd be above $12k
Well it's bedtime and I've got some positions open but with stops in place meaning if the ass falls out of the price I'll lose at most $200.

If the BB's are really going to trigger a reaction in the next 6-12 hours I'll wake up to the results. 

Safe trading y'all. Stay frosty.
Loaded up long at $8888.88

Probably a scalp, going to monitor the position. Wayyy oversold on the shorter timeframes
Buyer here at $8870 .. will scalp the bounce

Edit: Closed at $8912 for 0.12 BTC.  Will be a buyer again at $8800.
Still holding my underwater long from 9.2k. Started DCA'ing more fiat into my HODL stack too. My long is getting closed at 8,650 if we drop that low, at which point I'll probably wait until 7.9ish to make my next DCA purchase.
Started to now turn on the leverage...

Down 7.73% on my USD position (liquidation @ $1152.8)  
Down 2.66% on my EUR position (liquidation @ $1052.6)

Bracing for maximum impact, but am confident that some semblance of support will be found here. I said I was confident that $9100 would hold, but it didn't.

Now I'll say some more famous last words and say that I'm confident $8400 will hold.
Serious question, since the mid-term channel is now broken, do we have anything else to support an uptrend?
Bears are acting so awful in this thread.  At best they are going to get the price 1k lower than it is now.  People in Iran by themselves have purchased 2.5 billion usds worth of bitcoin in the last week alone.  Here are all the positive things happening right now:

1.  Venezuela hyper-inflation buying
2.  Iran geo-political capital control buying
3.  Coinbase network effect.  Since December Coinbase alone has added approx. 9 million new accounts.  11 million to over 20 million.  
4.  Goldman Sachs trading desk being opened
5.  Rumors of large blocks being sought OTC.  Gemini, Coinbase, others offering block trading
6.  Significant daily media coverage
7.  Mt. Gox 500 million sell-off totally absorbed by market with the price going up 50 percent since the lows were established 
8. Five months of depressed prices allowing for each purchaser of btc. on a retail level to purchase a larger quantity of coin for their country currency
9.Large increase in bitcoin atms nationally and internationally.  Everday 100's are being added
10.  Very strong network effects increasing the ultility, under base, liquidity, and potential demand for btc.
11.  NYSE starting bitcoin trading platform

This isn't a hope and dream type situation.  It bothers me a little that bears are being so deluded as to not be able to see that hoping to eek out profit here on a short is a -ev decision even if they end up being right.

I'm making an argument that it is incredibly stupid to take the risk of shorting here.  It is also stupid to trade or even sell here.  I guess what I mean is that the certainty of a huge market increase is approaching 100 percent based on supply and demand factors alone.  

We are reaching a point where the floor on btc is rising and people are trading the froth on that very solid floor.  It's going to get to the point where the aggregate market demand is so high that it becomes mathematically impossible for btc. to go below a certain level.

Winklevosses will be richest people in the world.
This is beyond exciting. 

0% chance my eyes won’t be glued to the charts today. 

The suspense is unreal, I enjoy this more than volatility 
$9090. Close enough. Time to reevaluate.

1. That's as close to straight down as I've seen in awhile. Looks to me like a large player playing the market. A few of you predicted this might happen with the order book thin as it was.

2. Subsequent panic selling certainly took place, but I expected a test of $9000 almost immediately. It hasn't been long enough to determine if this is the end of our downward move.

3. I feel fine. I have a few contracts on ETH I expected to get liquidated, but those barely moved. Suggests these ripples are a result of a single large stone rather than a school of fish shifting direction.

Determination: I call BS. My long remains in place while I watch the charts for a drop below $8900.     
Buying pressure is strong. Feeling confident in a break up soon, or at least strong support at $9,000 if this breaks down. 

Edit: look for $9,280 or so for a breakdown of this pennant and $9400 for a break up. 

I will say that the Bitmex futures are telegraphing a breakdown. The premium is shrinking while price goes sideways. it's down to about $150 from $200 yesterday.
I’m generally bearish but also have been since the bull trap at 17k. 

I will admit though, this last rally had me cautiously bullish for the short term. 

The rejection off 10k now has me cautiously bearish. 

Speaking solely based on the chart, the thing  that remains slightly bullish to me is that we have yet to close a daily candle below $8,800 to mark a lower high, which would also wash out the potential bull div as well. 

While I understand the momentum is clearly downwards for now, there are still 21 hours left for this to either turn around, or really bring the pain. 

Too soon to call it a win for either the bulls or bears, at least that’s the way I see it. 

[removed]
Move my stop loss on my 9305 long to 9353, I am not sure how the next move will happen but I am sure that Bitmex will not work when it happens :D
I think bitstamp's graph glitched: https://i.imgur.com/P2p7aA6.png
So what happened today that caused the drop?

I've been busy taking naps and coloring my pubes to match these charts. Missed the day.
Time for a critical 8800 break or bounce 
Welp, I was definitely wrong about this move. At least my last transaction just got confirmed for $.12
my limit buy order at 8878 managed to fill.. Definitely looking to scalp but don't have a price target as of yet..
I've seen a buy wall of 2000 coins on Bitfinex @8850, now down to 1000. Anyone saw if it was sold into or it was partially pulled?

Previous support turning to resistance around 8950:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/biJexI55/

On smaller time frames, you will see rejection around 8950
If you consider this bubble to be similar to the last, then buying now would be like buying at around $600, which isn't too bad IMO. Sure you would have had to hold the bag for a while, but $600 wound up being a pretty good position. 
As others have said here a big move looks imminent, bbands are tight as hell. I'm still long from 9050, and as I said yesterday I think we will probably crack 10k if we get the chance too this time around. I'm considering taking profit at between 9.5k-9.6k but still long with a portion of my stack to 10k plus. I think the bull is gradually returning, there is going to be plenty money made in the next few months. Good luck to all. 
I looked at the chart and saw this.

Since the BGD on 12th April, we had big moves up 3 out of 4 Thursdays:

12th April: $1,000 BGD starting at 12.00 UTC

19th April: no big move

26th April: BGD took us from 8,900 to 9,300, starting at 20.00 UTC

3rd May: Several green 4h candles took us from 9,200 to 9,700, starting at 12.00 UTC

So what happens on Thursdays? OTC order fulfilment?

!long XBTM18 9475 10X 20%

edit: format
As others have noted, it feels like we're close to a bigger move here.  We've been [marching up this trend line](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Auz9CGs9/) for the last 24 hours which, if you draw a line across the top wicks, forms an [ascending wedge.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/K4x5w8r9/)  Historically BTC loves to break these to the upside.

The closer we get to $9400 without falling off the wedge engenders some confidence that this may break upwards. In either case, up or down, I don't think the move will be massive... there is some support at $9180 and strong support in the $9k range all the way down to $8800. A move to the upside is likely to kicked off $9600 pretty hard.  My guess is we'll range here for the next few days.
Laddering buys of my favorite alts, don't want to get back into fiat as even on the monthly I see BTC being higher than it is today. If we are going down down, the best entries are *often made on the way down. Searching for the bottom is dangerous. 


Just my perspective, being long on the market in the short-mid-long term.


Edit: It should be clarified, I ***buy*** on the margins. I fully expect most of my laddered buys to hit, as I try to place them within rational %s of current prices and averages. Do I get the best entry? No. But do I make money (gain purchasing power)? Yes. This is my way of sleeping at night, not investment advice. 
There are bullish divergencies on the 1 to 4 hour timeframes.The bollinger bands are very tight and the last pump managed to get btc above the middle band, which is a signal for a trend reversal. The macd had a cross on the lower timeframes which also signals a trend reversal, am optimistic, bought btc and went long for the first time with it.Let me know if i got things correctly :)
I'll be the first to admit I closed 25% of my short right before the fucking dildo. FUKCKING FUKKITYFUKCIFUCK

Now waiting for the bounce. If no bounce within 12 hrs then going all in short
Reposting:

I think we're the one pumping it, lol. I told you crypto market was hot in here.

https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/iranians-buying-billions-dollar-cryptocurrency/

Honestly I had no idea that it reaches billions. This goes higher than general public.
Pretty sad how you all downvoted /u/GrossBit when he warned very early today about GOX and now you're all gloating left and right.
jesus christ this place is toxic during a bear run and it's more toxic coming from bears here
Does anyone have idea why JPY lending rates are [so high on Bitfinex](https://cryptolend.net/rates.html)? Is somebody doing arbitrage between Bitfinex and Chinese/Japanese no-fee markets? Would that theory make sense?
Market is playing the ‘how close together can we get the daily bbands?’ game. 
Kraken out of margin again. Peopel are stocking up
[deleted]
I closed my long at $9320 as we touched back down on the line on BitStamp (often a good leading indicator)

I may buy $9k to scalp if we get down there
[Small bounce off the support line](https://www.tradingview.com/x/l0gPnmai/).  If this holds we should at least get a bounce to $9220 to retrace half the drop.

If not, next real support is at $9k.
Is it just me or did some massive buy walls just get posted on Finex around 8750? I can't remember how much was on there before the dump...
Not much of tradingview/chart builder guy, but put this together real quick - probably worth noting and keeping an eye on as we flirt w/ the neckline here. Target would be in the $7.8-$8k range.

[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/wgqDMmGI/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/wgqDMmGI/)


Bitcoin has a habit of suddenly jumping 5-8%+ in the matter of an hour after a week or two of sideways movement.

I think this moment is coming in the next day or so, making sub $10k the new baseline 
Proper sell off.  

I have buys setup at $8960 (prior low). In the event that this capitulates down to that level,  I'll trade the inevitable bounce.  I'm feeling doubtful, however, that we'll get there.  I think $9k will hold in the immediate short term.  

It'll be really interesting to see how this plays out over the next day... [this drop seems to be consolidating on the line in a similar fashion to yesterday.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/l6I2Yflk/).  But I have to say that I'm not feeling as confident as I was earlier in the day about a $10k retest in the coming week.

I'm a buyer at $8800 and $8600 because my bias has been generally bullish since we broke log in late April.  Below $8600 and my bias flips. 
a move from $9375 to $9150 is a 2.4% move

unbunch your panties ladies, you are panicking way too hard from a move that small

now if this gets below $8,800 then you can start panicking 
That was some solid effort vs result for the bears.  I don't see bulls rushing in to buy it back either.  Bear flag, new local low, and then it's anyone's guess.
3:30 AM and I woke up out of a dead sleep and started drawling things on charts:

**Bull Pennant on the 1HR**

https://www.tradingview.com/x/45lBi2IE/

Big move upwards / $9,500+ in the next coming ours. I closed 30% of my long earlier, but I’m adding a small amount here ( 10% ) and will set tight stops Incase it breaks down. 

When we explode up, it’s going to be hard. 

Good luck all 
1D BBands are squeezing harder than I've seen in a loooooong time.  Next macro move will be very violent, and sustained.  Don't pick the wrong direction else :-(

Looking for volume-backed break above $10,100 or below $8500 for a face melting run.  

Suspend your preconceptions - let the chart tell you what's coming.  Find your neutral until this move reveals itself.

copied from below, to the masses not grasping what im saying:


> According to John Bollinger, periods of low volatility are often followed by periods of high volatility. Therefore, a volatility contraction or narrowing of the bands can foreshadow a significant advance or decline. Once the squeeze play is on, a subsequent band break signal sthe start of a new move. A new advance starts with a squeeze and subsequent break above the upper band. A new decline starts with a squeeze and subsequent break below the lower band.

my short at $9335 is looking smexy
i bought the dip 10% of my stack.. this imho is an obvious stophunt on a low volume day and longs aren't selling (shorts and longs both increasing).  I dont think this crashes in one day.  this is the overeagerness of bears.

EDIT: oh shit seeing some FUD that gox may have moved coins.. oops.



I'm long with my entire trading stack now ( not that much ).  I'm even going to turn bullish if we recover here.  Blatant manipulation attempt.  And no panic.

EDIT: dont do as i do unless you're a gambler.. the TA all says this is not good news.


!short XBTUSD 9150 5X 100%

I'll add to it if there's a bounce and cut it at $9,400.

Mostly just protecting my cold storage.

EDIT: By "add to it" I mean increase my leverage to 10x and double the position size. 
basically a whale is faking the order book to get people to sell into his buy walls by making it look like there is a massive sell off happening 
How concerning or not for that matter is it that within a 2week span we have seen 24,200 BTC and the same amount of BCH moved from those wallets? We didn't dump 2 weeks ago so is it a non factor at this point since it seems to not be released on the exchanges anymore or at least not market sold?
Trigger the panic sells
Waiting for the real dip <8600.

Thing preventing a massive red candle IMO: traders are far more conservatively capitalized right now post-crash.

Also: BCH is laughably overvalued right now.
seems that the gox coins moved about 16 hours ago, is this the first we are seeing it?

here is the gox wallet monitor

Does anyone have experience with backtesting low liquidity/shitcoin markets?

I'm trying to reproduce shrimpy's backtests (https://www.shrimpy.io/backtest?c=EAAAAAAACA==&p=1h&r=157) but I am seeing rather interesting market microstructure effects that make my backtests perform very well, but would be impossible to profit on in practice. The majority of my profits come from periods of low liquidity and high spreads, shrimpy's testing application doesn't have the data to handle it, and I don't know how to handle it.

The only conclusion that I can draw from this that both mine and shrimpy's backtests are completely flawed and the idea that a rebalancing index can outperform buy & hold is an illusion, but I might be missing something.

There is also this source: https://evolveetfs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/When-Size-Doesnt-Matter-Equal-Weighting-vs.-Market-Cap-Weighting.pdf that claims that frequent rebalancing is better (see page 9), but claims that "The rebalancing effect only explains about 5% of the performance", and that's quite a lot less than shrimpy's backtests show.
I'm trying to figure out how this all correlates with future BTC price but I have some BTC to buy the dip on the next BTC volatility and this dump didn't do anything to the SAT value on alts and there were no dips to buy. Recent volatility from $9k to $10K and back down have hurt alts quite a bit but they seemed to have found a local bottom. Maybe this bolds well for BTC if alt holders aren't panicking out into fiat via BTC.

Let me know if this is a topic more suited for the alt channel. I thought it was relevant because even though I'm almost all-in in alts at the moment the only chart I have open 24-7 is the BTC chart.
For those unaware, the US equities markets appear to have avoided a major break down: https://twitter.com/PeterLBrandt/status/994253835039162368

They closed above the triangle yesterday and were strong across the board today.

A lot of people go on about how uncorrelated crypto is to traditional markets, but I personally don't buy it. IMO a stock market crash would likely trigger a short/mid-term trip to goblin town. However, it seems we will avoid that scenario... for now. At worst, this is neutral for crypto.
The stage we are in right now, resembles the time period between 9-12 April before we saw that big 19K candle and almost 20% increase in price within a matter of few minutes.

If it turns out to be the case, I won't be surprised to see a drop of $200-300 in the price. The buying pressure will intensify even more during this drop and when it hit its bottom, crazy buying will start, we will see many big trades, it will be crazy to watch. 

My experience and understanding tells me we will cross $10,000 very easily and quickly. These are my thoughts based on the above.

What behaviour do you guys expect with consensus? Do you expect to see next few days green and then a sell off during the event? I am not even sure about how reliable TA is now because of that event...
Isn't the right move to short a hedge or to stay out and wait for the direction it breaks? We know it'll be a big move and the follow thru will also be significant so why not just wait? We're under a significant resistance which will likely go lower before up. 

Disclaimer: I'm short 60% stack at 9300 15x
The next big move is really hard to guess.

We have a very large long term ascending wedge that broke to the downside. We have a medium term descending wedge that broke to the upside and we have a short\-term formation that can be intereprested as triangle or wedge. RSIs are mostly around 50....

Im feeling exhausted again, and I'm kicking myself for not sticking to my plan.

Putting a order at 9.7 I don't think we will break thru the 10k barrier anytime soon with this 8.8 showing up. Same logic as the last two times.

edit// scaling it back by a third tho
Accumulate here or wait for low 8k?

Well fuck my ass with a pineapple, that's a nice little drop.

It's all about 9k now. Not confident it'll hold. We've been treading water for days now above it, this feels like the moment we drop under. 
The 1.1k BTC wall holding finex up all day was just pulled from the books... so this poo poo is probably about to get dumped unless they are gonna throw all that money in with market orders, lol. 
There is so much bullish news that it's bearish. Everyone EXPECTS prices to rise given consensus, major exchanges announcing crypto trading, rumored institutional investment, ect...When everyone EXPECTS prices to rise, it's never a good sign. I see BTC heading back to retest the lows from earlier this year and then we can discuss if these institutions will finally give it an actual bid..

Going to go enjoy my vacation with my girlfriend. Out of the market for the time being.

Enjoy the weekend everyone! 


There are people dying to buy the Gox coins now.  I was looking at the Coinbase wallet numbers and they have doubled in the past five months from about 11 million to over 20 million.  Bitcoin wallets outside of Coinbase have increased a lot in the last five months of this bear market.

The network effect is in full swing.  There are many more bitcoin atms being installed everyday.  OTC demand is huge reaching into the billions of dollars presently.  

Traders might be able to keep trading the froth on top of the baseline price floor for Bitcoin but this market is growing at an accelerating exponential pace.

When prices start increasing those increases are going to be huge.  
i may have smoked a little so not sure if this will make sense.

it doesnt really matter that much what the price of btc in 4hrs or 6 weeks from now will be. in the next 15-20 years crypo could be unlike anything we've imagined before or it could be the next fucking google glass.

a thought like that really fucks my R:R perception
Mt. Gox Cold Wallet Moves 8200 BTC
Looks like it is going down. Will be waiting for the 5000 btc buy on finex to completely invalidate all charts lol
Just a friendly reminder, right now it wouldn’t be a terrible time to slowly sell off your other coins

When Bitcoin makes a ferocious move in either direction, all other coins seem to crash.

Could be a good opportunity to increase your stacks all around, especially if BTC goes on a bullish rally here, I’de expect red all around 

Edit: BTC To Alt ratio goes down, not USD

rising wedge broke down on low volume, now retesting support on wedge, which wedge breakdowns seem to frequently do

taking back $9500+ would be bullish for sure but really, should wait for <$8800 or $10000+ to expect a trend continuation/reversal
Chart: https://imgur.com/a/JkczzXA

We seem to be bouncing off the longer-term support line (similar to how the descending wedge resolved upwards yesterday), but now we're inside this downward channel.

R/R much better on the sell-side, IMHO. Personally, [I'm still in fiat](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8gelu0/daily_discussion_wednesday_may_02_2018/dycmzw8/). Will happily buy some Bitcoins in the $7's and $8's though Tom Lee be damned.
And thats a Big Red Dildo in the making, Still holding my short from 9300 with first target of 8800

EDIT: Bearish BBands middle breakdown. Macd turning down. Ascending wedge breakdown.
Wow I've never seen volume this low on gdax before. For all you people who talk about volume, THIS is what low volume really looks like. Low volume with this dip has me more bullish than bearish, some might disagree, but volume confirms trend and that's my super simple take on it.

Edit: You can downvote me if you want, but it's not going to change what I do. Merely sharing what I think

Edit2: it's literally one of the most basic concepts in trading seriously go look it up for yourselves
Price is [failing to make lower lows.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/3WrZInmI/)  This may be indicative of a *short term* reversal. Watch for break of top line.

Edit:  Anndddddd...[it's more down](https://www.tradingview.com/x/zEo3Ya0l/) 
Bitfinex order book is ridiculously thin at them moment. 100btc market buy/sell either way and it could set some crazy shit off
bought a bit at 9060, think we make a small bounce to 9160
Still saw some unusual sporadic 100 btc sales on BitFlyer this am although it’s not underperforming US this morning as arbs jumped in. Still believe it’s Kobayashi in action

That doesn’t make too bearish YET. As long as 8800 holds its rather bullish 

Strange how the market is moving up now that gdax is offline.  
We broke with a huge amount of volume off the ascending wedge we were in since yesterday and are up for a whole new 5 wave move to the downside. 
Its not looking good for the short term.  
The hourly just gave an short entry and if the mid term uptrend ( blue line/region ) does not hold for a second time , i expect the move down to accelerate to 8800. 
Thats doen not mean we are back in the bear bc we can always make an higher low above 7500. Which will only make the uptrend healthier.

I bought on the sub 9100 dip

Am i a brainlet?
I went to bed with a large hedging short and was not nervous at all.  I'm not sure why the big drop, but it is not an especially big surprise.  Of course the Gox dump was not expected, but something was.
Question to other "bears": Where will we hit the next bottom (measured from April 6) and based on what particular indicators? 
Good entry point?
Like i said yesterday bull trap. Wait for sub 9ks. Waiting in fiat

IMO we desperately need to experience the same bounce we got last week, or else it's goblin town for awhile. There might be some support nearer to 8800 or so though, so that's a level to watch to. Personally I'm regretting not getting out higher as of late and my portfolio is honestly being fucked over I'm losing money weekly but that's the price I had to pay for trying to buy shitcoins as I believe they will still overtake bitcoin in terms of growth for the next bull run 

Edit: hopefully we make a local double bottom and bounce here again...? Or I think it would then be safer to get out and if 8.8k should bounce get back in. Not very sure though as rsi is oversold on the 1h 2h and 3h now and we look to be ready to atleast attempt a bounce here

Obviously a bear trap. But now the question is when will it pump back up?
Japan has already broken down from this bull flag but the other exchanges haven't budged. It will be interesting to see if Japan will bring them down or not. The buying definitely seems weak right now across the board so finex and others may follow. Right now bitflyer is at a $130 USD discount.

Edit: It appears Japan is picking itself back up while the other exchanges try to push for another high.

Bulls doing a good job holding that 9k line, but I don't see it lasting much longer.
Anyone else feels like binance has been a leader recently (especially for violent moves like dumps and bounces) ? And despite the bad liquidity, its volume is consistently higher than finex.
This needs to bart its way over 9200 before daily close otherwise 8800 is looking very likely

So what were all those transactions that were clogging the network back when BTC was peaking?  People moving it to sell only?

These correlate almost perfectly after January.
Breakdown me thinks... Oh well. 
Closing my long from 9100 at a small loss because these guys aren't done dumping. Will open a new one at 8800 if it goes there and add at 8250 if it goes there because it's not going lower than that. If these were the Gox coins, they'll need to be repaid because the trustee is not authorized to sell at this point.
Sold some right before the price dropped.
Well, that BRD screwed my short term plans, but big picture...

I've seen the ascending wedge brought up a lot, but I'm seeing the resistance of that wedge being the top resistance of the channel that's brought us to this point over the last couple of weeks.  My hopium is that if the rising support - which is struggling right now - holds, we could break up from this massive triangle.

https://imgur.com/a/nfh5eM0
A lot of evidence of heavy BTC selling on Japanese exchanges today. Probably MtGox related. The market is taking it rather well so far 
Looks like a typical preparation for a relentless crash, one which will send shivers down the spines of all high-headed bulls on (h)opium. The crash will be magnificent, it will be remembered for decades to come. Aren't all our crashes memorable folks? Yes they are; they are the best crashes.
Huge green candle incoming.  I predict a run-up to 13k by the end of next week.  There is huge money pouring into crypto on every possible level right now and the number of users is growing by 300k per day.  If this were an internet stock the price would be much higher.  

I don't think people really understand what it means if people can buy crypto through their brokerage account.  Most people with stocks will be buying bitcoin.

These are events that bulls could only dream of 2 years ago.  The price move is going to be absolutely epic.

I think 50k is a real possibility within 4 months.  
look i know the charts say its basically a free fall but come on guys we were just knocking at 10k with huge volume now we just plummet straight down to 7k in a week?  sorry bro.. nah this is a bear's dream it's too good to be true.  it aint gonna happen.

we gonna straight.. TO DA MOOON.

Two real questions regarding affect of upcoming Consensys meeting:

1. Is it actually possible that price tanks 15% A day (or other unexpectedly large amount) during Consensys just to fuck with the attendees? If I was a whale honestly, I'd find it pretty amusing and a useful test of sentiment, especially if I were there myself. It would be a solid body blow to crypto and fundamentals, and if that's what whales are after.... 

2. What is everyone expecting Consensys to do to price? I think we max up 20% a day for two days during the meeting, then continue falling after, no aftertaste no lingering, hard red candle after, no looking back until new low. Sell the news kind of event.

GDAX should change the red candles to black so we can say we got fucked by a big black dildo
Oh fuck bitcoin feels like 4 digits for sure now.. and i think its starting to feel like an 8 coin not a 9 coin anymore.  we need to get back into the 9's so that feeling doesnt stick.

Just an observation: I think we're in a mini fractal of the fall from 20k. 

* 9950 = 19.8k ath
* 9880 = 17k
* 9380 = 11.7k
* 8960 = 5.9k low

If so, next low (assuming this drop isn't done) will be higher than 8960.
Is there a good sub for discussing Bitcoin Legacy trading?
I leave for an hour and its down another 200 wtf why did i go bullish on this ponzi coin right before this?!?!

IS there any news behind the drop?

gox selling coins short term will likely send us lower in the short term, but remember these coin can only be sold once, they've be an axe hanging over us for years now, that threat looks to be being removed.

I am flat for a 10% fall where I will buy back in.
Note that it always comes after and never before. If it were useful info it'd come before. it's just people trying to see patterns where there are none.

it's very rare people do it with upwards movement though, so it seems pointless to me 
Nice flip of the flair. 

And yeah I agree, I didn't see any gox posts all day until the dip, unfortunately. 
Trying to map significant moves to external events (news, gox coins, etc) is a fairly popular approach for those who aren't as interested in technical analysis. 
It's just you because there have only been a handful of Gox sales/dumps this year.
A new generation of buttcoiners will be born here, resist the dark side!

So *you're* Vegeta.
I think the real hilarity is that the gox shitshow is probably the best thing that could have ever happened to 95% of the people who had their coins hijacked. 

Even if they bought the absolute top at $1,160 and only receive 20% of their coins back...they're still up like 150% on their investment. 

More likely than not, nearly all of them would have sold for a loss at some point during the downtrend from $1,160 to $200. 
I wish Mark Karpeles had devoted his neckbeard life to Magic instead of Bitcoin

It's pretty clear that the market crashed hard at 20k because it went parabolic, there was a huge bear div on the 1D, completely unsustainable. Nothing to do with that.

Stops triggered, you have company.
At what point in the conversation did you tell her she was going to be replaced by a smart contract in the future?
mind if I ask where you are from?
I believe there some alts and/or banks looking to fix this gap in the market, if not there will be soon enough.
You mean banks don't take an asset that regularly loses \+50&#37; of it's value as proof of funds? Go figure.
I went through the same when renting. When I told the agent I had some money in crypto she said I shouldn't mention it in rental applications. It's still viewed as risky, strange, fraudulent, dark webby etc by many. Many even think it is illegal.

When it came time to make a deposit on a place, I had to drive to two different banks to get a cashier's check and deposit it. The whole time I was thinking what a wasteful way to move money around. If the landlord accepted bitcoin it would have taken one hour and no driving. And she would have made 10 percent extra if she'd kept it in BTC as the next 24 hours the price jumped.
So, here in the UK banks are funny about crypto as a funding source for property purchases. It's not verifiable as to where it came from and falls foul of anti money laundering laws. As someone trading crypto as a house deposit this irks me.
Would you accept Bitcoin as payment to purchase your house?
well, considering you cannot use them as proof of funds, I'd say not many. what this tells me is this: it means your realtor is showing houses to people that may not even be able to buy a house. they have no preapproval. the bitcoin question is for a mortgage company, not a realtor. so you have people, that have never spoken a mortgage company looking at houses, and your realtor is wasting his/her and your time.  doubt this happened all. Fannie and Freddie guidelines are clear as day. can't use it.
bitcoin? oh noooo nooo no.. no thanks.. we only take real money here.  soooory.

I tried to do this. Told it was unverifiable under the Dodd Frank Act...
Somehow I always pictured you as an early 20s dude. Hmmm, go figure
So I am not alone.
Just hope it doesn't mean that people are pouring all their savings into Crypto...
reminds me of that scene in BCS where the oil tycoon tries to pay saul in confederate money lol

Low comments are always when price doesn't move significantly, and we're in this range almost 24h

Same same. Added to my 9300 entry short.
Ahh, missed my chance to add to my short.  Oh well 
Short from 9150 on June futures (so around 9050 spot) - I'm expecting a bounce but the question is whether to just close it here for a scalp or not. Hard to gauge the buy pressure right now. At the very least I'll be closing at break even - not messing around.

Probably someone dumping into their own buys, what was the last bad news? I haven't been fallowing closely. Bill Gates and Baby Brains?
Why unlikely? If you zoom out you can clearly see we're above the linear trendline (support zone around 7500)
Seems like this has been the M. O. of bitcoin the past few days. ~9220 was a key support though. I continue to sit in fiat until this thing sorts itself out. Currently bullish though. 
Most of the market flipped bullish weeks ago but the bears have to keep testing just to make sure. 
Dawg i mean this in the most excellent way possible, but the only thing dumber than what you're doing is when I closed my 9960 short at 9700.

This shit is not going to break up like everyone imagines. $300 pump max, no big ass green candle as everyone's conjuring from April 11. A big ass red candle? Possible. A BGD is much less so simply because of the prior failures and lack of short fodder. EVen if it breaks up it'll be a small break, plenty of time to reassess then. But if it goes down, it'll be much faster = less time to react.

Reconsider dawg, reconsider.
Are you okay? 
I too, would like a guaranteed 10% gain every day.
I'm really starting to think it's just building pressure for a massive move, and my gut is leaning towards a move up. Won't bet the farm on it though.

Edit: Might've jinxed it.
I'm a moderately large whale on testnet and I've actually come to like big pumps and dumps. it is the only way you'll ever get an order filled without slippage. 

I have 400 coins on there (used to have like 2k but I think I threw some away with slippage just to see how bad it was. I spiked the price like $5k one time for fun) and it's very difficult to get a 5x order filled. I have to open like 20,000,000 contract positions and it's hard to get it filled unless the market makes a strong move. 

So I imagine tons of these walls really are trying to get filled. 
Yep, good observation, someone bought a fuckload of coins at $9,300
I'm expecting a regular jump up a level or two of resistance*.  BGDs come out of local lows and oversold conditions.   A fakeout could provide those conditions though.  (or maybe my threshold to qualify as BGD is too large)

Shorts aren't outnumbering long presently, are they?  Particularly new shorts.

edit: *from this current formation
Not here....most of the experienced traders here were expecting it to *break* -- direction was not at all clear. Most of us that were long were simply long from below, so it made sense to hold through the break in case it was up. 
That's called TA
Wild BART Appears!

He casts SHORT.

It's super effective!
Gotta catch em all™ 
Does anyone remember how long each Bart usually takes to fully form (in this case, jump back up?). My recollection is a few hours 
What is BxD? BGD you mean?

EDIT: Got it. BGD OR BRD
What happened to chewy's BxBP? ;)
They capitulated during the dump the other day to $9,000 on spot. Premium dropped to around $50 and held below $100 for a few hours. 

Then it was right back up to $200 less than 12 hours later. 

If $9,100 holds here, and there's a bounce back up to $9,300, then I'd be shocked if the premium didn't rebound disproportionately to spot again.
It's increasing now.

Edit: ok that was just one candle.  It's back and forth still.
Well 3% is fine. It sounds like you're just uncomfortable holding good entries. Which will always be the case. Get used to it. fwiw I closed a short up very high too

Try thinking of your trades, writing them down, then doing the exact opposite.
Thanks for taking one for the team.
From a macro perspective, we still have all they way to 8831 to set a new higher low on the Daily time frame and maintain healthy consolidation. The last 5 days have been part of the same bear move. Breaking that level (8831) would likely lead to a retest of 8600 and if that fails, the next support is all the way down to 7800. This would benefit a break out on the Weekly time frame as well as it would provide continuation for equilibrium on that time frame.

If we test it in the next couple hours, we may very well be testing the ATH log line as support. On the other hand, dipping to 8800 at the same time as Consensus could be interesting.

Me. But I think we haven't hit the bottom of the dip yet. Some people seem to be too impatient. 
Me. I'm about to long the dip. Maybe wait for $9100. This is looking very much like a bearwhale fail. 

Add: look at those big downward pointing wicks. This is going up hard.
Pretty much all coins react in some way to bitcoin dumping. Bitcoin is king coin.
They’re all roughly in sync. 
it pains me to say it, but perhaps it is because they expect the price to go down...
he wants 1% of that 90 billion $$ gates short

It's only for the lowest tier. They probably did it to offset compliance and support costs.

Watching it now, I wouldn't say its outstanding. The argument that miners can change the rules of the system through control of over 51% of the hashing power isn't even properly countered. Non-miners can run full nodes to validate the rules of all incoming blocks themselves. Miners & devs aren't the central bankers of Bitcoin, in the end the users (AKA the market) are in control and decides which ruleset is enforced.
watching it rn while btc dropping. Thought of 
Tim Draper's eyebrows as a good support at 8.8k.
I thought the court doesn't rule until September whether those coins will be sold or distributed to their rightful owners. Perhaps these 8500 coins were lent. If so, they will need to be bought back in due time. 

Either way, this dump was a big, expensive failure by history's losers, giving their money to people smarter and more deserving than they.
did they confirm he's dumping? he and ver and kerpeles all seem to be a little too close for comfort.  With the BCH action going on recently

EDIT: i count 8k moved today 5-10.  I guess 136/17 = about 8, so thats what this poster is referring to.




I don’t get it. Why do they have to sell them all, surely they don’t owe creditors over a billion dollars do they ?
I don't understand why they don't sell OTC instead choose to dump it on the market.
Such a shallow comment, but I won't deny I lol'd

Iran buying 2.5 billion in cryptos? Any proof of this? Iran is quite irrelevant for crypto [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=IR&q=&#37;2Fm&#37;2F05p0rrx](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=IR&q=%2Fm%2F05p0rrx)
> It is also stupid to trade or even sell here.

Yeah, well, this is a trading forum.

I don't see the same picture as you. I see a world economy heading for a downturn, and a bitcoin that isn't useful for anything but speculation.
Most of this is wishful thinking dude, we are still very much in a speculative bubble. Price discovery will continue for some time and shorting will continue to be profitable for the foreseeable future. Good luck with your trades.
Bears can't ruin Bitcoin

Let Bitcoin rest on its own laurels... it's either a better form of money or it isn't.  

The speculative price action in the interim is all noise before this space really matures and proves itself.  Your post outlines many reasons why BTC is likely to continue on it's incredible trajectory ... the adoption, tech and fundamentals are getting better.. not worse.  But these realities are deep currents and take time to emerge to the surface and affect the daily chop. 
I remember folks like you listing all of these positive facts during the 2014 bear market. Nothing beats human psychology. Just be patient.. we'll go bull again eventually.
Yet this doesn't change the fact that:

- people in general are evidently not interested in crypto for now

- Google searches, twitter activity, media coverage is down month on month from January 
So how many bitcoins did u buy? You sound like you're convincing yourself. Just remember the market can stay irrational much longer than you'd like. 

I agree with you Bitcoin is the next internet/mobile phone/game changer but that shit is off the horizon. Don't get too excited, don't tell your friends to buy, don't convince yourself and just let the force be with you 
i like this post
Sometime I wish I can think this way. Bulls and spiritual or optimistic people. As I get older, the cynicism and scepticism just seeps into my bones.
!RemindMe 9 Months "So how hope and dream was this comment?"
Blockchain Week NYC and Consensus 2018 hosted by CoinDesk are also occurring this week/next with quite a few other Bitcoin conferences, conventions, and summits coming along too right after. Lots more big announcements to come I can imagine.
Some of us are trying to have a life here.
The market could technically remain trapped in the [current consolidation pattern](https://imgur.com/a/jiD5Kbp) until around 11:00 pm tonight. 

Pure torture.

EDIT: Don't worry, it's very doubtful that it will. Should see some fireworks within the next few hours would be my guess.
you're the kind of bloke that likes watching no-hitters
this is boring AF

Order books weren't thin though...initial drop was 1700 btc dump. 

Volume in past few hours has been around 7k btc 
I share your sentiment, as evidenced by my last post. I've added once so far, will add more if we drop into the $8,9XX. 
it was a real dump with volume.. it wasnt panic selling, just stop losses.  if panic selling hits, look out below.  When it's panic selling you'll know.   If you're long, you'll be literally terrified.


I think it's a matter of taking out 9.4k, then we might see some fireworks. 
15m, 1h, 1d bbands are tight...

Premium dropped on one move and isn't changing since then.
the bull pennant - the volume on the breakout above 9100 was so-so. 
volumes down 25% today is good and bad.. makes the breakout more pronounced on the pole but lends more credence to the dead cat bounce after failed attack on 10k theory

staying flat.  53/47 longs




Will you stop @9280 or let it ride until breakeven? I have a lousy entry @9250 but didn't feel like risking being stopped by a wick.
yeah, we're getting close ! That's damn tight...
If it breaks down, are you planning to hold your long through a test of 9K support? That's a pretty big drop, especially if futures premium narrows as well. 
So if futures traders are really as silly as we think they are, now is a great time to pile on the longs.
back in the olden days after a drop like this bitcoin would somehow finish slightly green

You underestimate how much coins whales have. Every drop like this is pocket change they find in their sofa.
One thing is certain, and that is when we break up or down bitmex rekt is going to be on fire!
I am expecting a drop ($200-$300) before the quick and massive rally upwards, clearing 10K in a matter of hours, perhaps minutes.
It glitched on ETH price. Just a display glitch. 
I don’t think that’s glitched
Bill Gates figured out how to short BTC.
you shorted another 100MM dont act like you dont know

It went up a bit. 
Gox coins dump is likely a major contributing factor.
Lowest price shows 8870 so must've been pulled. 
Edit: 2k wall at 8870 now though. 
It's been there awhile. 
Seems to be holding up, good place to add to an already existing short perhaps. Curious if we'll see another dump shortly or if we'll start to carve out a channel here.
If you consider the current state to be the first leg of the two stage bubble of 2013 you'd be buying at $100 equivalent.
Big move is imminent, but it might only come after a slight drop as traders seem reluctant to buy at this price, but would be happier to buy it $200-$300 lower. At the same time, I think we all want to break through 10K, and we will from what I expect, moreover it will be very quick.
Idk but in Europe it's normally a drinking night.

Make from that what you want.

Good grief watching the charts has been really annoying today.

I'm done. I'll be having a beer enjoying the last bit of sun and ill check in a couple of hours if anything happened. 
I'd draw it as an ascending triangle. Either with resistance at $9,400 or resistance at $9,365 with some false breakouts:

https://imgur.com/a/6bKDX8A

EDIT: It doesn't really matter which it is from a breakout standpoint (break up = bullish, break down = bearish), but a rising wedge has a bearish bias whearas a rising triangle has a bullish bias. So one's expected to break down, while the other is expected to break up.
I’m long to but set right stops man, this game is cruel. Take profits when you can
Great job!
Hat tip for publicly admitting it.
That was part of risk management so not bad. Think of the positive as it appears still have 75% of short open...! :-)
I thought about closing half my long @9380 and got greedy. Ended up closing slightly bellow entry losing 0.5%. 
If i had closed half i'd would ended a bit in profit...

The grass is always greener on the other side!

Lets see after it gets updated next week.
If my government was ran by terrorists and about to be obliterated I’d be buying BTC too. 
To be fair though the selling on Japanese exchanges wasn't anything really out of the ordinary overall, and because it didn't have a direct effect on the market it's highly speculative to infer that this dump was caused by anything gox related. 
The default for /r/bitcoinmarkets is to sort by "new" (which was a HUGE debate awhile back, but I'm a fan). 

As a result, there's no huge incentive to downvote. You're not really pushing anything up or down in the thread by upvoting or downvoting. 

Instead, potentially valuable content gets buried because people don't like the poster or because they don't like the message. 

Personally, I'd be in favor of removing the downvote option and leaving the upvote button.

I'm sure on wall street when a veteran trader here's a rumor like that he puts his hands over his ears and says IM NOT LISTENING IM NOT LISTENING.. like the sophisticated investors here.

I actually love this place during the bearish moments because there's more discussion of fundamentals, usage, and real world practicalities. 

And trading...I feel like you learn how to trade during  a bear market. And a bull market is generally just free money. 

Bull market is just "I can't wait to buy my lambo, bitcoin is a revolution, this shit's making me rich!" and "long this dip 50x, bitcoin will continue to go up for years." (we still see this thinking in several people) 

bear market is "What issues does bitcoin need to overcome to become more than a bubble? How will these issues be resolved? Does current usage support current prices?" and "Is this really a good entry? am I overleveraged? What trading strategies can I employ/utilize to maximize profits with good risk management?" 

Someone said the most common word here in 2014 or 2015 was "fundamentals" and I totally believe it now. That kind of discussion goes out the window during a bull run 

I guess the toxicity kinda sucks but it's just the inverse reaction to price since more people here are invested in bitcoin going up than the reverse
Bears = Smart but disagreeable

Bulls = Fun but superficial

I try to find both sides in myself so I can ride the whole rollercoaster :)

10x as annoying during bull run...maybe 100x.
That's such garbage. The sub is for discussions on profitably trading BTC, not cheer lead it.  
Fiat lending rates are high, because Fiat seems rare on exchanges?
Not sure where they are getting those numbers. There are no lending rates for leverage on Bitfinex. They have a weird and not-so-effective system of penalizing leveraged positions that increase the deviation between the leveraged contract and spot values but it's not like Bitmex or other places where you are paying out interest. It's a one-time fee at the time of settlement. And it's very cheap.

Edit: I read Bitfinex as Bitflyer. I'm an idiot. Disregard.
Long or shorts? Any way for those who don't have a kraken account to see this kind of data? Tia!
Blockchain used to be synonymous with bitcoin.

Now everybody in the tech world is falling all over themselves to divorce the two. 

I'm actually thinking the opposite:

2018 will be the year of blockchain, and companies will do everything in their power to draw attention away from crypto+blockchain and draw attention to blockchain as a separate solution.
Funny you should mention this today. I was in London meeting a couple about their wedding and the guy works in Berlin for an IT company. In passing I mentioned Blockchain tech and job availability and he said there were lots of jobs but he lacked any confidence that many of them will turn in to anything.

A bit like how a load of companies put 'blockchain' in their name and the value went up soon after. He said that a lot of people were getting in to blockchain tech with no valid reason to.
Same... I get emails nearly every day from recruiters trying to pull me into some blockchain related tech... I rarely saw these in 2017... there are a large number of small companies trying to build services and infrastructure behind the scenes which I think is a positive thing for the space overall
All ICOs scams ? 
Looks to me like a Whale unloading all day and then thought he could incite a dump.

I think this is someone testing market sentiment. Right before Consensus too, I think time to go long
i'm jumping back in 9k
Never trust anything that's on the orderbook. 

Least of all anything that's on the orderbook 4% below current price. 

Buying at $8,750 seems like a fantastic idea when the market is trading at $9,100. But the orders might not still be there if the market gets down that far.
There was 3k from $8700 to $8800 last night. I remember thinking it was huge 
Define "massive"
It also has a habit of tanking 5-8% in a matter of hours from a bear flag, which is arguably what we are in now.
I don't think it's been purely sideways though. It hasn't stayed in a real tight zone like it was previously. Also remember that last jump we got after the real sideways action was a "one off" type thing. I'd trade with caution (as always).
>  I'll trade the inevitable bounce.

Far from inevitable...of course.   But I covered 20% of my short and betting on a likely bounce, although not looking great at the moment.
Proper sell off? This was a reckless dump. It's nothing. We will resume upward trajectory by Monday if not today (Friday).
it is just a start man, this happend in a 30m candle. 
Agreed... a move in either direction was going to be ~$300 ... right now it's best to wait this out and see where it settles.

There are a ton of buy orders on the books at $8800
Good job, now go back to bed. Your work here is done.

You keep saying that repeatedly and of course you are way overconfident in your prediction.
Same thought. I'll probably regret this.

!long xbtusd 9120 1X 100%
Interesting and probably very sensible that you've shifted to a short.

I'm sticking with my long from 9110 even though I'm nearly at breakeven as I feel this could be a sudden dump before renewed stepped accumulation.

im long from about the same spot, haha.  Look at the hourly - it's a classic bart.  I don't trust barts to be 'real' moves.

Now just hold on to it chewy. Don't get crowbar fucked by the bounce. I'm holding my shorts til liquidation. 
I hope i'm not the one jinxing your positions...
Following you again @9123.
It's pretty easy to make it look like there is a sell off if you sell off.
Can you elaborate on what you're seeing? 
If that were the case then there is definitely a point at which he has to stop before he incites a real sell off.  I wonder how close he would try to cut it.  I would think below $8700 would be a no-go zone.
Yup, two more big fat walls of his in the finex order book -- 8870 and 8770. He got his 9k bids filled. 
The smart money doesn't just transfer this to an exchange and dump on you hoes.

They walk the market up slowly, give the shrimp the false feeling of hope (*"But, but Tom Lee says...!!"*), then unload.
not yet, that's 8600
Glad not to be holding those heavy bags right now. They must begin to feel very heavy. Adding to my short during this dispair
BCH laughably overvalued for the last 6 months.. fwiw
I shorted BTC, BCH, and ETH yesterday on Mex. I should've gone heavy into my BCH short, it looked weakest, but I usually hate touching anything about it. 17% ROE on 3x leverage, thanks for being shit BCH.
Interesting timing.
dang. nakamoto hour is back?
Does the site tell you *when* it was moved? 

Oh you can click on the addresses for a link to the wallet info 

edit: lol I swear I'm not a total idiot, I just was curious how to know how often the site updates each movement without manually checking the addresses myself...which completely defeats the purpose of the website. I'm assuming it's daily? 

Like will tomorrow show the same info or is it refreshed every 24h? 
>but would be impossible to profit on in practice.

Why?

I was considering giving shrimpy a go, the back test of clicking *ALL* the shit coins and getting 250% profit is ever so slightly tempting.

My theory was that it was profiting off pump and dumps; if however your doing it says no, I'd love to know.

edit// the sort of thing I was looking at btw https://www.shrimpy.io/backtest?c=78/3/9n//g==&p=1h&r=260

I'm rather torn, "invest in what you believe in" or "invest in any good bet" I picked the names based off what I don't respect, and a data process I'm to lazy to do myself say "great idea"
https://medium.com/catalyst-crypto/markowitz-portfolio-optimization-for-cryptocurrencies-in-catalyst-b23c38652556

I have modified (mostly adding new coins as they are listed and have sufficient price history) and tested that algorithm using various timeframes, and while it does beat buy and hold, generally the less frequently it rebalances, the better.

EDIT: Deleted earlier post because I responded to the wrong thread.  Adding the following regarding backtesting low volume shitcoins:

"I got price slippage to work in backtesting on Catalyst, but haven't figured out how to set up volume share slippage yet.  The amusing thing is, without volume slippage, any decent backtest using DOGEBTC crashes in within 2 days because you can't order more than like, 1 billion coins."
Jeff Gundlach actually believes the crypto market is a harbinger for sentiment in the equity markets. ([Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/23/jeffrey-gundlach-says-if-you-want-to-know-where-stocks-are-going-next-watch-bitcoin.html).)
It didn't avoid anything. It broke out from the same point where BTC was some time ago (everybody's favorite (log) downtrend line). It means nothing if it paints another lower high or a double top tomorrow or next week. I saw the same on CNBC, they said BUY because it broke out while you should be taking profit or shorting, like you should have shorted 10k on BTC. 

But yes stocks and crypto are very correlated. Compare the weekly line chart for the DOW and BTC and you will be amazed. 
It doesn't resemble it very much. If anything, it seems like the same scenario, except its upside down and could play out bearishly since everyone is so bullish.

on the 10th of April, we had an ATH of 40k btc shorts open and they got annihilated. Both shorts and longs have been decreasing this whole runup. We also broke through a huge falling wedge, cascading the margin calls. A giant BGD is unlikely, though the market is prime for a big move.

edit: I don't know if you've seen funding rates on Mex, but Long funding was ridiculously high and have settled a bit. If anything, we could see a classic long squeeze to propel us down. 
You bring back bad memories man :) There really is a resemblance to that ultimate BGD, but thats still something that probably happens like once every year.
"we will cross $10,000 very easily and quickly"

\- yeah, no you're about to be surprised
I can't imagine drastic changes 

a) most people don't educate themselves

b) it takes time to watch all the recordings for those who do

c) understanding what the hell they are saying means your likely all in
As others have stated, waiting for the move means missing the move with exchanges like mex. It absolutely makes more sense to wait for the move if you can trust your order to execute. But if you expect 3%+ candle, you'll be lucky to get an entry anywhere inside it. 
One reason is that when this big move comes, all exchanges will be down/choppy/overloaded/margin cascading
It all depends where are you with your position.

Hedge here might be stupid because we may move hard up. I
d say it's gonna be time to hedge if we break below 8.8.

If you're long with some room then it's bigger reward to wait or close atg be when it drops.

Taking any position right now is too risky, even hedge short. Maybe if you can catch almost 9.4 as a hedge, then there's nice no brain hedge with stops above 9.5
Be very very cautious shorting at this point unless your goal is to make a couple percentage quick gains.
There's extraordinarily little to be gained from opening a position now vs following a breakout unless you're trading on Bitmex (because their servers will implode, making it impossible to open or close a position).

Just be patient and short a sustained break below $9,300 or long a sustained break above $9,400.

Very good point, I think I learned a lesson here. The market can reach saturation if everyone is buying the rumour too early and there will not be enough demand to eat a bear raid.
you're a boglehead
But the five red months...
Just shows how tight the range is. 

We're talking about "reversing" a 3% drop. 
Dang, the hourly literally flip flopped in those last minutes.
I just want to say that those 4H doji's after a dump near the bottom of the dump almost always lead to another dump the next 4H candle. 
My long from 9870 is still open :/
Look at all the people who care!

It's possible that they're interested in the gox coins because they're being sold at a discount in bulk. 

We have no idea what price they're being sold at. 
if there is more demand than supply the pice will go up, but short term it is hard to see more demand than supply with ~$80 mil of bitcoin likely being sold or already sold.

They already increased exponentially last year and a speculative bubble was formed that popped.

Yep, a nicely timed plot twist or not
You're insane if you want to sell alts right now. They are so cheap and very likely to move up in the short term.
> When Bitcoin makes a ferocious move in either direction, all other coins seem to crash.

I have noticed it is quite the opposite.  Not sure what bizarro world you are living in.
If this wedge broke down and is still going sideways then I'd say this wedge was irrelevant (2 points on every line)
I have another support line that was violated once but has 5 touches which we haven't reached yet. If we break that I'm putting my bull hat backwards into bear mode. (currently at lower 9k)

I'd share the chart but I feel like it'll give people an epileptic attack. 
It’s still a blip on the 1D...fingers 🤞.
If your going by their 24 hour volume just keep in mind they were closed for 4\-5 hours i believe last night for maintenance.
How does low volume confirm trend?
24H volume just went up by like 800 on that drop lol. 
It's making the same lows, and lower highs. This is a descending triangle: https://www.tradingview.com/x/jBkmTPzx/
Zoom out. This recent dump is a lower high on the 4H, it’s yet to break structure at 8950-9000.
> This may be indicative 

Yes, much better.  You will end up with more money in the end if you keep to that mindset, rather than "definitely going to bounce here".
More likely it would just print another weird 1m candle like the $9,200 to $8,750 (or whatever it was). 

It's going to take more than one chucklehead on 1 exchange to move the market here. 
as sad as it is im looking at 1m charts now to justify my impulse buy.. i just see a bear flag..

EDIT: as others are saying, im sure whoever did that big short was hoping to incite much more of a panic.

Considering it was a dump of large volume i saw a lot of bargain hunting come in on a day with otherwise no volume



Seems like traders are getting used to the MT. Gox dumps while maintaining high confidence in the market. 9000-9100 has been pretty resilient thus far, as it seems that buyers are scooping up what they view as bargain prices. It helps that the other news this week has been largely positive for the space (NTSE Crypto Desk, Iran, Robinhood, Consensus, etc.)
Low liquidity?
I'll piggy back on this post.

no the r/r is good.

Last time we had so tight bands the price more than doubled..so possibly 4-5k, probably even lower. Just don't see it stopping at 7.5k(50MA) or something like that if we break down here.

For a short maybe. I'd wait for 8600 to break. 
If it was a bull trap it didn't work. We're still over $9K, and we were in the 7s a few weeks ago.

This is a bear trap. It's going back up as soon as this guy's done with his little tantrum.

Forgot to mention: !long 9100.

Anyone who sold that news quickly obviously made an easy and quick 3%.   
ummm....yes?
how about sell if price move under 9200... buy high sell low? 
Buying over 9380 when 9.4 was a resistance historically is not such a great move ;-)

Obviously a bull trap. But now the question is when will it dump on down?
Why is it obvious
They were on a discount this whole rise from 9k, they were struggling to pass 9.3 while we were above. If you don't count price difference the charts look almost exactly the same, it's not that they're dumping and we're not.

And no, they're bull flag is 9.2-9.4, they wicked below, but still in a bull flag.
Are we looking at the same Daily MACD? https://i.imgur.com/6gXisUn.png The one that crossed 4 days ago during the ~~dump~~ retrace?
The market is like $30 away from breaking down from the bull pennant and barting it's way back down to $9,000. 

It's a super precarious spot for the market right now. 

So I wouldn't spike the football yet. Although I'm still hopeful.
Replying to deleted post:

Basic trend analysis.

Introduction:

MA = Moving Average: A moving average takes the average price over x Time periods.  

In the chart linked, the time period is weekly.  There are 2 Moving Averages.  

* 4 Periods = ~Monthly MA

* 16 Periods = ~Quarterly MA (3 months)

[The Envelope](https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/Envelope_(ENV) is  2 Moving Averages with a 10% range.   Traditionally, this provides a [trading range](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tradingrange.asp).

The periods picked should be closely based to human perception:  Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Trimester, Yearly.  The lower the time period, the lesser the trend and the greater the chaos.  Intra-Day Trading is an abomination.

Analysis:

When the price meets the short MA (Monthly MA in the link) or the the Long MA (Quarterly MA in the link), usually indicates a trend reversal, breakout or confirmation.  Those three decisions are obviously in conflict so we look to the position of each MA relative to each other and price and the Envelope to reduce our odds.

Trading Outcome: (Bitcoin at $9350)

Price above the Quarterly MA: Long

Price at/close to the Weekly MA:  Pivot

Price in the Envelope but closer to the bottom.:  Plenty of room for a Long, less room for the Short before either breaches the Trading Range.

Trade:  Buy Bitcoins with a stop loss at the Quarterly MA ($8800).  Profits points at the top of the Envelope ($11149)

Who cares? The more BTC flows from dumb people to smart people, the better! We are witnessing the old guard committing suicide. It's glorious. I hope smart, kind, hard working middle class people are taking advantage of the discounts these arrogant idiots are giving us right now because it won't last. The dumps are so weak now. Back in January, burning this many coins would have dropped the price at least five percent. Today? Three percent if that. Smart money still taking dumb money off dumb people's hands, and plenty of it.
Yes, mostly due to money coming from alts 
since they do not have margin trading, this is a good sign that organic buying picking up
most recently, it's probably due to the BCN tanking and people selling it off for BTC
They fake their volume...

Edit: to be fair: this is my opinion. No hard evidence.
Are barts still a thing? I thought that died a week ago

Using btc? For what? Btc is used as a speculative trading asset. No one “using” it for any real purpose 
Major price swings cause a big uptick in transaction volume - particularly as hype goes higher and higher.

Bitcoin transactions per day have always gone through cycles and spikes/declines.  That part isn't unusual in the slightest.

What is unusual is that this drop-off has both been far more severe and it isn't recovering (yet).  This graph shows what's going on pretty well:  https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions?daysAverageString=450&timespan=all

That's a 450-day smoothed moving average to take out basically all of the noise.  It has basically never declined visually... until now.

Just as telling, the [altcoin spike](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DALFglbUMAAEre6.jpg:large) which started right when Bitcoin backlogs got out of control for the first time is not retracting - Bitcoin's dominance is still within about 4% of its all-time-low.  This is also when Ethereum's transactions per day took off, and they have not declined back down to anything like the levels they had before.

FYI, this comment may be veering into altcoin territory - other responses may need to go into the altcoin daily.
not so fast!
Can't tell if you're a bot or real life idiot. If the latter, stop being an idiot. Don't long, esp with leverage, against the micro and macro downtrend.

Still interested to hear your explanation on that *lost coins = worse liquidity* claim you made [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8htvo8/daily_discussion_tuesday_may_08_2018/dymoliw/). 

I'm curious is this actually makes sense or if you were just spreading FUD. Curious to hear other thoughts as well.
I literally just wrote the same thing. Didn't see yours because of all the downvotes. I wonder if the same will happen to me....

Why would I started buying bitcoin through my brokerage account? I play around with crypto for fun, I make real money in stocks. Stocks are easier to predict when you know what you are doing. They are based on real companies and real data. There isn’t a single crypto that truly has what I’d call a working product. None of them do anything for 99.9% of people in the world. 

I do believe Blockchain will be used in many different aspects but most of these currencies will never be used for anything expect speculative trading. 
Deluded idiot. It’s shit like this that leads to new/inexperienced traders making bad decisions.

Please use reasoning/analysis instead of blind hope. Otherwise give it a rest.
Huge red candle incoming. I predict a drop to 6K by the end of next week. 

I think $500 is a real possibility within 4 months.

> if people can buy crypto through their brokerage account. Most people with stocks will be buying bitcoin.

They can't do that now and they won't be able to do that soon.  Even if they could, most people with stocks would not be buying bitcoin.

'Most people with stocks will be buying bitcoin'

Complete and utter fantasy 
Looking at the 1d chart, the volume was actually decreasing since that “BGD”. 
what free fall? its down 4.5% you guys have grown soft, this is still just chop.

free fall in my book is still down 15-25% in one day

The conference isn't until next week, so there's that. 
Counting your chickens already?
Nothing 
People who thinks the conference matters: Do you remember the halvening and how bitcoin was either going to die as miners turn off all the things or moon right then and there?

Now by show of hands who remembers what happened that week?

Because jack shit happened, it was already priced in. Its not going to matter unless something drastic and unexpected happens like a supermodel strips unannounced in front of a bunch of camera and it makes national news(whales pls?)
20&#37; a day? the best outcome it will hopefully help us break 10k if we get there 
the market seems immune to good news.. i see calls for 50k by various talking heads all the time and nothing happens now.  Buffett says rat poison and it tanks 10% in a week.

Lol order books change at every price point at every second...
Because *your feelings* are cosmically connected to the fluctuating price of a volatile new speculative asset.
Meh volume is still unimpressive, still nothing decisive happening. 
wait for consensus , Putin told me it will pump
I think it’s more important to recognize the following

> Bitcoin Legacy

Did you get hacked?
I just went to see if there was actually a fork of BTC called "Bitcoin Legacy."

Good god there's a lot of forks of Bitcoin now.  lol.
what if everyone is talking about bitcoin (BCH) in this sub. confused i  am.
lol I wouldn't be surprised if 20-30% of this market is driven by lines on charts. Really, go to bitmex and see how many people trade on TA in the troll box. it's quite literally a self fulfilling prophecy at this point 

The only issue is that most people's TA is utter garbage and makes 0 sense so you can't expect people's interpretations to be the same. 
I dont get it. I read they were obliged by law to wait for september for next decision or something. How can they dump now?
They were sold or atleast moved 2 weeks ago and it seemed like a big nothing if I remember correctly
>these coin can only be sold once

sorry you are wrong on this. 
> Nice flip of the flair.

Yeah, I didn't want to but was expecting a retest of 10k at least once. I'm very disappointed I had to do it.
That's because people probably sell the news, before they mention it here.
[deleted]
Not really, I made a pretty penny off shorting and longing, proceeded to lose this extra profit and then some L's because Guess which idiot had to go into damn altcoins without a good plan and rushing to get back in because 'missed opportunities'
Not really, because all the people who lost coins on Gox have gotten $0.00 back after 4 years...and no end in sight.

And if civil rehabilitation is not approved, creditors will all get fiat back, at $483 per BTC.   And that is if they are still alive to receive it...people don't live forever.

It's very, very unlikely that anyone will get any BTC ...considering the administrator seems to be selling it all, chunk by chunk.


>More likely than not, nearly all of them would have sold for a loss at some point during the downtrend from $1,160 to $200.

*Ah*, nothing like some good old counterfactual claims. Always very refreshing.  

Of course, we don't really know what the price would've done if not for that whole GOX ordeal and I'm not sure you can really accurately gauge what people were planning on doing with their coins back then anyway if the price dropped. I think fewer people were throwing small fortunes at Bitcoin back then and the overall sentiment was much more-so *buynhodl* for that crowd, compared with today. People back then new the moon was much higher than its valuation, even at 1.2K, and the potential multiplier reward was much greater. Very few people who were ballsy enough to play with crypto back then were that short sighted. 

Personally, I wasn't fazed by 2014 at all, granted I was well in green even at the lowest point, but still, not once did I think that Bitcoin might not recover in a big way. But even if I'd bought the top, nothing in that bear market would make me concerned about the long term potential of Bitcoin. Actually the only time I got scared for Bitcoin Core was the flash crash that happened in April or May 2013. I was super busy with finals and presentations that day and didn't yet understand what Bitcoin volatility was like. I thought something fundamentally wrong had occurred and the market was abandoning ship. It took me a while to realize that it was just profit taking and panic. Since then, my confidence in Bitcoin isn't shaken the slightest by flash crashes, big dips or full on bear markets. I'm a true believer in Bitcoin Core. 
>More likely than not, nearly all of them would have sold for a loss at some point during the downtrend from $1,160 to $200.

I wouldn't have. I have a non\-trivial amount tied up in that mess \(he didn't get it all but damn if he didn't get a lot\). Even with that, my outlook has remained persistently optimistic through the years and I say with a high degree of confidence that I wouldn't have sold for a loss at some point during the downtrend. Many friends are still surprised I didn't sell everything \(and are even more surprised I bought more\). I even grabbed some through bitcoinbuilder at around 7&#37; if I remember correctly \(it's been a while so I might be a little off\).

Reading your post and my response again though, I suppose I sort of confirmed your assertion and my anecdote is covered by the "nearly all of them" bit.
so true, I am one of them. we were forced to hold for a loooong time. feels not bad to see them in cash, I have the cash to buy them back. average official price was around 11.4k for both BTH and BTC together. If the trustee sold here, the average will be lowered, but not much. 
But he doesn't have (nor have I ever seen him with) a neckbeard.
Oooooh so controversial! Ouch bro ouch! My life is a sham!
A big part of that is due to gov't regulation.  USA residents aren't even allowed to margin trade.  And 3 billion people were banned from the market in India and China and many millions more in other countries.
yup. With some moderate slippage. Thanks Bitmex!

That’s a risk some people don’t like to take so they prefer cold hard cash
I would have quietly denied your rental application, lol.  Sorry, we're at capacity - try the halfway house cross town they have some openings.  Bitcoin aint money you use, it's money you hodl.



Wait, so even if you gave them cash, but said you got the cash from selling crypto, they'd give you the side-eye?
Whoa, wait there a minute. Are you saying that if I want to buy a house outright, the funds made from bitcoin trading can't be used? Or I can't give assurance that I am good for the money based on funds on an exchange? Or banks won't give a mortgage with Bitcoin gains being used as the deposit? 
I would. I've been accepting rent in BTC for a year now. Has worked out nicely even at today's prices
if I did, I'd make them pay a 25% premium for the hassle of the added tax implications for me and would still use Bitpay for the transaction

I would without hesitation.
no, these were people paying the full price for the house using Bitcoin. 

the proof of funds isn't for the mortgage, its to prove to the seller that you'll actually be able to close. Imagine selling a home, and then Bitcoin price crashes and the buyer has to pull out because his net worth just went down 50%
Nah I'm in my mid 30s...getting old as hell. 
early 20s dudes dont trade they're partying it up in cabo with their 20,000 BTC they mined.

yeah, and then all of us ADHD traders with to much profit try to squeeze that last candle move into our market bias, then enough people do it and it tips over and trigger a stop loss cascade
I've been dead inside for a long time my friend. Mostly because of things unrelated to Bitcoin. I'm an early Bitcoin adopter and ex-miner, so suffice it to say I've probably done better than most. Regardless of what happens with the price, Bitcoin has been very good to me.

Gox coins moving 
Totally fair question, and I should have explained. I think in order to drop below $8,800, many bulls would need to close their long positions or flat out move to fiat, and they would have to do so *below $9,000.* I don't think the current general sentiment (bullish, imo) is ready to sell/close at a loss in the $8,000's, especially since we got so close to $10,000 and it seems like we could be back up there relatively easily. Now, whether bulls are overconfident when they shouldn't be is another question. No TA from me, just macro events + my read of general sentiment + gut + obsessive order book watching
You don't consider a $300 pump a big green candle?

*The* BGD is not really likely to occur again. Too many factors aligned perfectly for it. A 3% candle is significant in today's environment. 
[deleted]
You're right that its not going to dildo up, but I keep hodling my good positions for too long and lose out on a shitton of profit because I get emotional on the pumps and panic close way too fast instead of waiting on the retest of support, so I just wanted to lock it in for once. And I feel like if we're ever going to moon again it will be now or in a quite a long time so I'm taking a gamble on it
I dunno, man. Volume is extremely low and daily bands are very tight... this is the calm before the storm. Whatever direction we head next is likely to be very wild. 
yeah ofcourse, thanks for asking!  
Closed out when that 9300 wall got pounded, lost a fair chunk but thats okay.   
Just waiting to see now if this thing is going to bounce or not, considering getting out for a while
Why so drastic?

It's just boring. We broke up, ok, nice, going to sleep for 48h, woke up, oh, price moved up $50...
We see those move since second run to 11.7, most of the time we're moving in $200 stairs, either up or down (excluding couple of bigger moves).

Really annoying.
Dunno, the first bounce from 8.9-9k was a pretty steep V.  I have a feeling we might go explore the support there a bit more before we really go up.
i agree and have unfortunately been buying more
> it's just building pressure for a massive move

Indeed it is from what I see. Perhaps we might see a small drop first, but the move upwards is going to be crazy quick and big.
Everybody loves to point to buy/sell walls as "obvious manipulation" and "whales trying to spook the market."

Sometimes they just want to exit or enter a large position without worrying about slippage. 
if the order book is fat you can clear the entire book before the price slips

It was a margin long getting filled.
Caterpie fainted!
Relevant username.
Yeah, basically just some violent move. I'm expecting either 95xx or 91xx within the next 4 hours. Who knows, though. It might just meander its way through all the lines on my chart like the honeybadger it is. 
BxD = Big Variable Dildo

BGD = Big Green Dildo

BRD = Big Red Dildo
We could very well get a BGBP. I would be surprised by a BRBP though. :P
True.

If it rebounds that easy again I’ll short again. 
Down to a $70 premium on June from the $90 premium when I opened like 20 minutes ago. I flipped my position from Sept to June after your previous reply. Liquidity for filling orders isn't so much an issue to me, but slippage on market closing could be a problem. 
So, you gotta figure that at least some of the reason the premium went back down was people longing spot or swaps and shorting the futures, hoping to arbitrage the difference. So you gotta figure some of thsoe people are doing the reverse of that now to take profit. 
Yeah, I'm mostly just trading to stay engaged with the market, so that I will be prepared when a clearer opportunity presents itself. And to distract myself from my other responsibilities.
Could you please printscreen me this line? 
My July position actually executed pretty much on target and within profit, though it took less profit than expected.

But shortly before this dump I had opened a gambling position on Sept with a tight stop which slipped a ton.  Hope I remember that next time I have the urge to do something stupid like this!

!long xbtm18 add 9097 10x 38%

!short xbtusd 8434 25X 5%
Hmmm I don’t really understand why though. The timing is amazing. Almost like it was a coordinated attack. 
I doubt it has anything to do with price. They probably did it to offset compliance and support costs.
9 trillion with 100x leverage 
What support? They aren't backlogged with tickets nor new users. Compliance I can maybe understand, but that doesn't explain how the same US based type exchange GDAX offers no fees for makers and 1/4 for takers.
No its not. There's plenty of legit exchanges with 1/4th the trading fee. (Gdax, bitstamp, etc)
Minigpools control the network. Simple. 
because they choose not to
It's stupid on their part due to fee loss and slippage but whatever they want to do. Maybe the trustee has a massive short open ;\)
You do realize OTC will just sell it onto the exchanges right?
Considering the volatility we've seen since November 17, that's really pretty expected. Try comparing it to, say 2016. Are they relatively tight by that standard?
> a break below the middle would be bearish AF if not bullrun

I don't think if we break down from here we will let go 10K just like that, no! 
That's typical before a big move. Volume will always drop beforehand because everyone has taken a position and are waiting to see the outcome.
I have looked this up before and for some reason never saw "plurality" as the most votes but not necessarily more than half 
Thought you left for vacation 😂

Which one? or is it good now 
Possibly! Although there's quite a few people who posted they were unbothered by the dump. so I wanted to see just how many 😅

What's funny is a few bearish votes came in right after the drop to $9090 lol 
I wish... BitMex hit $8830... close though....

I'm becoming numb to this moves. Set a stop loss and hope for the best. 
This can go on for hours still...
I should be taking profits here to start at least breaking even on trades, but we can't win if we don't risk.

Today isn’t the best day to have your life not consumed by bitcoin.

I wish it wasn’t today, I’m going on vacation with my lady today and will be on the road for several hours. Hoping for a move soon
Meanwhile my boss truly appreciates my productivity levels today as my eyes dart to the gdax tab every 10 seconds... :)
Well that’s unfortunate. 

I wont be coherent around 11 PM  
You sir are an interesting person 
I'd say this push right here is probably make or break for buyers.
I can't escape this freakin log line: https://www.tradingview.com/x/I8JzpC7H/
I'll probably close at break even. Which is roughly $9,340 on June futures. 
Potentially, although I'm not super convinced they're wrong here. 

We'll see shortly, one way or another.
That is the most fun part of it all
Yep, just came to post this.

Happens on other exchanges as well sometimes, I remember it happening on GDAX a couple of months ago, with it "confusing" btc with btc...
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

What can I say? I feel the need. The need for greed.
Where do you get this FUD ?
Spoofy is still there on Bitfinex working his charm.
This can't be like 2013, because I'm told over and over and over this is exactly like 2014. 
Can we please have a 3 hour graph of this 2013 event if you will?
I agree we could drop slightly before the move, but I am happy with my longs entry of 9050. 
I'm not drinking tonight :(
A wedge could continue to be annoying for the next 16 hours or so. 

A triangle would have to pick a direction closer to 11 hours. 
> It doesn't really matter which it is from a breakout standpoint (break up = bullish, break down = bearish), but a rising wedge has a bearish bias whearas a rising triangle has a bullish bias. So one's expected to break down, while the other is expected to break up.

Yes, rising wedge is generally bearish... the slope however is modest ... and can be drawn as an ascending triangle per your chart.  I'm mostly just watching the lower trend line.  A break below would likely have me ditching my long position and waiting it out


i will, im playing with a small stack so even if i lose 10%, i lose lunch money.
thank you!

Yeah seriously, always greener. I took a .2btc loss closing them too. 
thanks, good read

Yes there are some people buying it there.

Wrong on both counts but whatever
Agreed and a bunch of coins moved two weeks ago with no effect either so.
You are poking at one of the oldest debates on the internet :) Upvoting-only policies should be left for pseudo-happy places like Facebook. (I like to think that) Reddit is more raw and opinionated and allows for full spectrum of emotions.
Agree. There's definitely psy ops accounts here downvoting comments that are contrary to how they want people to think. I've had multiple real-content comments reach 10+ downvotes and autominimized within 1 hr of comment.
> Personally, I'd be in favor of removing the downvote option and leaving the upvote button.

Great idea. Posters won't feel bad as a result.
I don't usually interact with posts one way or the other. 

I will, however, play "parking meter fairy" if I see somebody has a post at 0 or -1. I'll top that shit off with an upvote to prevent their comment from being hidden. 

I also upvote anybody who has anything negative to say about me personally, as a rule.
I do the same about barely downvote, But i give upvotes if i feel the post contribution is giving me something that i can learn from or is good value. 

Bad posts or posts that i don't like i will read it, but i wil ignore further and don't downvote, Everyone has opinion or message even if its bad or worthless.
I go out of my way to upvote trolls as long as they aren't using vulgar language or being unimaginative.
I also instantly downvote anyone who complains about downvoting, especially if they're in the right.
I upvote all the regulars no matter what they say, haha.

What you say is probably true. I mean, the Mt Gox part IS true, every serious drop (if any) cannot be attributed to that convenient cause, most veteran traders here know it to be so. The pump part is obviously true too, we can all see it on the charts, but I'm not sure it was only done to dump again, or that a single entity or a small group can even pull something like this off. 

Of all the possible theories floating around, I guess my favourite is the one about random people holding VAST amounts of coin that pretty much "happened" to find their way to their hands during the early years of bitcoin.. What has been the evolution of such people, over the years where they have become rich, and then superrich? How much coin are they willing to throw into the pump, either because they are true believers, or because they are willing to throw 2% out there to start another round of FOMO and make the rest of their 98% worth so much more? 
You make no sense. The 1000$ dildo was the result of everyone and their mother shorting the corn because it was obviously going to 3k. So everyone collectively pumped the corn at their own expense.
ils n’ont pas compris mon ami. Mais moi, je te comprends
We should also comment on users like this one that this is a suspected psy ops account. Even if it isn't, it'll discourage the commenter from continuing to mislead people.
> I actually love this place during the bearish moments because there's more discussion of fundamentals, usage, and real world practicalities.

Yes exactly.  During bull run, it is a hodler circlejerk. Much more TA talk when price is not strong.   
I agree that deeper technical conversations can be had during bear markets. But it's also whenever someone says anything bullish (however unjustified it may be), you get responses like "fucking idiot" or "stfu" or "this is why moon boys are retarded". 

Like hell bears are automatically smart; have you not been here? 
I've been here for years.  Bears have not been the smart ones.
100x is accurate.
I think (s)he's saying the bears tend to be more smug than bulls. Not sure I agree but that's how I read it.

That said, I actually kind of agree with /u/SloppySynapses on the quality of content being generally better during bear markets than bull markets. I'll say this though, if you want to get an appreciation for the quality overall, go have a look at /r/Bitcoin, /r/ethmarkets, and /r/CryptoMarkets . Really makes you appreciate the quality of content here even when it's at its worst. I do miss /r/Bitcoin of old though.

And lastly, this is why I subscribe to and read / lurk the bitcoin-dev mailing list. It's chock full of fundamentals talk.
Of course, but is there some other reason JPY is wanted more than, say, EUR?
>Not sure where they are getting those numbers. There are no lending rates for leverage on Bitfinex. They have a weird and not-so-effective system of penalizing leveraged positions that increase the deviation between the leveraged contract and spot values but it's not like Bitmex or other places where you are paying out interest. It's a one-time fee at the time of settlement. And it's very cheap.

Every part of your post is wrong. 
I don't understand what you mean. Bitfinex has JPY lending for margin positions, and they have BTC/JPY, ETH/JPY, EOS/JPY pairs. Lending fees are calculated hourly, and paid daily.
Don't know if you can see the data, but I assume they have a pool for all margin regardless of short or long
blockchains a great tech to use if you could patent it you could make millions.. but bitcoins the only thing that'll be worth anything in 10 years


Tend to agree. Heard a VP giving a department talk about how they want to evaluate how "blockchain might be used to solve master data problems in integrations"

Often the best time to go long is when it doesn't feel like it. 

Also: https://www.tradingview.com/x/vr4qYtM5/  

That damn log line. 
Idk, pretty hefty volume on the drop and the market was already shaky after the 10k rejection. I do agree though that the entire day seemed like distribution, though I don't think they'll be a good bounce after this one, and I'm expecting much more downwards action. 

i actually did go long with a chunk of my stack.. i came to the same conclusion as you.  More of a reflex buy though.  
No reason to unload like that on a low liquidity day, unless trying to manipulate down.





My thinking as well. There’s a nice equilibrium forming on the daily. The weekly could use a little bit lower higher low, and I thought that we would revisit the 8500 range on the weekly, but with consensus coming up I’m feeling more bullish about another move up in the short term. 
Yeah sorry, I didn't mean it at all as something to trade on but rather noticed the large increase all of a sudden. Either way, it's gone again.

I'm honestly expecting a drop to 8.5k at least, so I decent part of my stack got stopped out at a meagre profit (will take what I can get) to manage my risk and I'll keep reassessing as time goes on. 

Thanks for the guidance though, I appreciate it!
It does give us an idea of perceived value, which is helpful.
3000 btc over $100 on bfx 
Curious which timeframe you are seeing the bear flag on? :)
And you were correct! Hats off.

I suppose we have another week.
Maybe I should clarify ...capitulations drops and euphoric peaks always rubber band back and I've done well scalping these... if we simply slow bleed below $9k, I'll remove my buy.  I'll trade the momentum tonight if it occurs; otherwise I'm out of trade.

or its a fake out before breaking through $10K 

like I said, this is just chop the move needs to be a lot more serious to confirm direction 
Sorry, what am I overconfident in?

It very well could be.

The price point where the dump stopped is very promising for longs. 

If it holds, this would be the 4th failed attempt to break below support:

https://imgur.com/a/d9RPgTc

A strong bounce here would be quite bullish.
I love this new bot!
There should be a bounce. And potentially a strong one. 

But I'd rather be short and wrong than long and wrong in the current setup.
Holding until liquidation is generally not my trading style. 

I cut losses early. 

I rarely have enough conviction in an eventual outcome to hold through significant losses. 

I'd cut and run above $9,400 and wouldn't really be too bothered if the market took another plunge after I bought the top.
The last one wasn't so bad. Wound up exiting close to breakeven. 

This one is straight up dumb though. 

Even if there is more downside on the horizon, there absolutely should be a moderate bounce before $9,000 breaks down.

The main reason I opened it is because I want to get into a short while there's still a premium on Bitmex futures. 
You put up a 3000 btc buy Wall then sell into it in 20-30 btc chunks. But you aren’t really selling, you are selling into your own wall. Noobs panic and start to sell too. 
As long as there are unsuspecting buyers who place their bids just ahead of him it can keep working. 
He's still there. trying to draw sellers in to get cheap coin.
Use the blockchain
yea site is hard to read like that, I clicked on the addresses and checked in the explorer, here is one of the movements

https://blockchain.info/address/1439q4Na8v88kPBqoyg8F4ueL9SYr8ANWj

*if only* there was a way to track the public ledger of transactions
You can look at Blockchain.info and paste in one of the wallet addresses that had movement.

https://blockchain.info/address/1439q4Na8v88kPBqoyg8F4ueL9SYr8ANWj
Have you ever read anything about the blockchain? 
When you click on the wallet that shows movement it will bring you to the blockchain and show a timestamp.

The following image from my backtesting engine shows buy/sell moments according to shrimpy's strategy:
https://i.imgur.com/JIRbKBF.png

The green line is the price of one of the shitcoins (bcn), the outperformance is 300%. The arrows are buy/sell moments according to shrimpy's strategy. I don't believe these trades are possible in practice. If I adjust my back testing engine to buy/sell for the price one hour into the future instead of the current price, the outperformance changes to -95% (i.e. buy & hold does 20x better). I'm not entirely sure what conclusions to draw from this, but it seems to indicate that the vast majority of profits stem from market-making related activity and not from rebalancing. Shrimpy's backtester is too simple to accurately capture profits van market making activities.

I personally don't believe it is reasonable to expect shrimpy to outperform buy&hold, but I'm not confident enough in my testing to determine why.
That link sounds interesting, but he makes a mistake by using the same dataset to fit his parameters and to backtest. His backtest uses parameters determined with data from the future. Any by only testing high-liquidity coins, he avoids the problems I'm having. In my testing, low-liquidity coins perform better with more frequeny rebalancing and for high-liquidity coins the results are less clear, but I am quite sure the former is due to a subtile bug in my backtesting engine, see also my other post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ic411/daily_discussion_thursday_may_10_2018/dysnr9l/

The idea that rebalancing less often leads to higher profits matches my intuition. But the source link I posted claims otherwise and I can't figure out why that's the case.
Oh yeah, I forgot to take into account the number of shorts during the said period, they were crazy high. 

Thanks for the write-up and your thoughts. Information sharing leads to acquisition of new knowledge and improved decision making.

What I think is that traders are not going to let go $10,000 this time. We might swing there and there but I think we will cross this sooner or later.



What if that BGD was just an appetizer and the main course is yet to come. It will be crazy and there will be no limits.
Good points, but all it takes is one smart person to write a summary and break it down. People will definitely do this. 
Especially mex...
Annyyyyyy minute now.....
Perfect timing on this comment before the breakdown 
Probably just sideways-itus. Every decisive move seems to stall somehow and move back to the 9400 range lately.
Omg why did you not close that earlier! 
Jesus man... 

I would have closed as soon as 9.5k broke. Is it a small position at least? 
You care enough to comment on my post? 

So you can politely *fuck off*
I agree, this does seem possible.
those gox coins are going in some silicon valley billionaire's bomb shelter to wait out the apocalypse.

some whale daytrader saw a short opportunity and took it.. he'll be covering tomorrow after he saw it failed.

If it's anything of size (say 2,000+ BTC) and it's being facilitated by a S&T desk at a major investment bank, they're likely making a 4-7% spread on the entire batch. I would guess the buyer is paying just below market price.
ive sobered up and i watched him a couple of days ago so 99% thats where i got it from

kinda dissapointed now
https://blokt.com/news/mt-gox-cold-wallet-moves-8200-btc-will-bitcoin-dump
I’ve been doing a decent job day trading mine. If they move up 5-15%, I always sell wait a day or 2 and buy back in.

If bitcoin makes an immense move up right here, which I think it will.. alts will take a fat beating and it would be a good time to capitalize on some alt gains 
I’ve seen both happen. Before the BGD in early April alts were booming before the big move.


What I’ve noticed is when BTC breaks down through major support areas, alts go too. 

If it’s just a random 150-200$ drop and the support area holds, alts tend to pump just a Smidge 
probably, although a breakdown here would validate it. not a very large  wedge anyway 
Still compared to ETH's gdax volume, which ~70,000 is pretty normal for low volume trends, it's still pretty low. A lot times it bottoms out around 8000
Low volume signals that most traders are not willing to close their positions because they believe the momentum of the primary trend will continue. Now this isn't 100% all the time, but is what''s typically observed more often than not.
A better way to look at it is by looking at how 24hr volume is calculated, in which, it is based off of how many buys and sells are going on within that given day. So low volume, low market activity.

Soo if we see low volume with a significant drop it means very few sells are moving the price, hence when everyone cries "market manipulation "
That's peanuts 
Yes.. there are two points of contact on the triangle.. if we fail to get a 3rd before the upper line breaks then the assessment fits..

I know it's early, but wanted to share what I'm seeing which fits a rounded bottoms, on albeit, a very short time frame
I'm very aware.  What is your point?
Do you read people's post?  I never claimed we'd bounce here. 
Yeah the first runup to 9750 had buy walls across every exchange
Iran? Is that impying the war that's starting there? Not sure how that's positive news?
Futures premium seems to be returning as well. Dropped to $70, but growing again ($90-100)

You have to be out of your mind if you're expecting 4-5K. This clown will run out of coins at 8.5 at worst. We're still up like 30-some percent from three weeks ago. We're only down 2 percent since this time yesterday. This is nothing but an opportunity to take some dummy's money.
[deleted]
Thank you I’ll stay in Fiat for a little longer 
Fiat is a funny joke.
Same. There might not be one if BTC decides to go up. 
bottom line has quite a few points going back actually
Everything is meaningless.™
mighta been a good idea.. the 8k coins are all in one wallet, hope its not an exchange wallet

i was just about to short.. anyway those coins moved hours ago i dont know why the sudden FUD

Not for me, 'cause I am a noob trader. So, I will pass on shorting...
Hmm... Okay.

*Me go back to drawing board....*
Yet somehow a 3k rise from 6k is meh, but a $300 drop is the real deal?
something is going to break sooner or later

i think its 9k frankly , im loosing my bullishness \(if thats even a word\)

tho in Russia bears are celebrated so thats good
in two hours when this 4H candle closes and the daily as well
It's not.
Because 24hr volume is calculated based off of the amount of buys and sells in a given day. Higher volume ---> more buys and/or sells occurring , lower volume ----> less buys and/or sells occurring 

So if we have low volume occurring during a dip it means that only a handful of sells are causing the price to drop.

I can't remember what it's called when one or a few individuals move the price around
Bitflyer's wire withdrawals and support system are currently broken, as reported at https://www.reddit.com/r/bitflyerusa/comments/8i5zzg/bug_in_wire_withdrawals/.  There is a Javascript error preventing confirmation of wire accounts, and the support system returns a "403 Forbidden" error code when trying to submit a ticket notifying them of the problem.

We stopped trading there temporarily, and others may have as well.  The price difference may reflect a lack of faith in the exchange.
Idk, it looks pretty broken down for me, https://i.imgur.com/bXBpFXR.png

Edit: Compare that to GDAX https://i.imgur.com/RlRewKw.png
hehehe, I like your paint job.
"Dump"? Pretty sad dump if it was, looks more like a 23.6&#37; retrace to me [https://i.imgur.com/adsD86o.png](https://i.imgur.com/adsD86o.png)

For comparison, last time Daily MACD crossed down \(3/7\) during a run up \(6k to 11k\), it dumped to about 40&#37;. This one is a joke by comparison.

If this is the best bears can do with a bearish daily MACD, they need to pack their shit and go home lol
It's certainly teasing the breakdown right now. 
wouldn't this be a great time to open longs with stops set at 1&#37;? if you expect the market to breakdown if it goes down south $30 then it should be a good deal, right?
On finex it would take 3-5x more selling than buying to move the price $200 lower than higher. Also, there is clear support at 9k-9.1k at the daily 23.6 retrace and EMA21/100 as shown by the last 2-3 days. I highly doubt it will drop that much from here, at least not without someone with a lot of coins mass market selling but let's see. 
Thank you very much! I woke out of a dead sleep when I first saw the post and was confused. lol
I first thought I read that wrong. Maybe more like BTC flowing from smart money to shrimps
That was always a good sign.
I meant volume on the BTC/USDT pair, although alts are the key yes. I still think not all moves have been led by finex recently.
There's no evidence of that whatsoever. They're well on track to solidify their position as the dominant crypto exchange in 2018. Calling their volume 'fake' is just silly, of course there is washtrading and other bullshit but it's no worse than on any other major exchange. They are, in fact, simply doing a very good job with their exchange. 
https://imgur.com/a/3TFFYKF
peep the hourly
How about now ;) 
Dude, we're up 30 percent in the past month and like 500 percent in the past year (and, yes, I bought at both points). Stop calling people idiots and look in the mirror before you call "down trend."
I don't know his argument, but doesn't extreme hoarding present an issue when another similar asset *doesn't* encourage hoarding?

I know ETH isn't BTC, but his argument was that people will swap to ETH if BTC starts being hoarded to an extremely disproportionate degree. Which makes sense. 

Is it really smart to invest in an asset that's being hoarded? This market really cannot provide the liquidity for anywhere near the amount of coins available. If these hoarders show up en masse, liquidity will absolutely falter and the market will crumple upon itself when hoarders all simultaneously try to exit. We saw an example of this after the melt up to $20k: $16k to $11k in one day. 

The dump to $6k stopped when the transaction backlog finally cleared. We literally didn't stop dumping until hoarders were out of coins to dump.

Maybe this isn't his argument, but I can't see hoarding (e.g. hodling) to be a good  thing long term
The "market cap" of bitcoin is based off the total created supply, not the *available* supply. So as coins are lost, fewer are available, which means the price goes up. However, that doesn't mean the actual amount of cash in the system has risen, just the supply has restricted, artificially so.

Hoarding causes the same effect as losing coins. The bad part is that a rising price increases hoarding (who wants to sell something that's going up).

As hoarding increases, fewer coins are on the market, which means liquidity actually drops because the average liquidity is based on those utilizing the coins, not the speculators. When fewer coins are on the market, users leave for alternatives because the cost of using goes up, further reducing liquidity.

If enough of the market feels the same way then it does. Speculation is just people trading on what the feel the market is going to do.
Are you suggesting their not?

Shit how am I suppose to trade now?
buyers should be eager to jump in, i remember last week i was like 'when it gets back into the 8's ill get my chance!'

The yardstick gets lower along with the volume.
Pretty confident we're still in a grin and bear market.

It was always a self fulfilling prophecy. Too many bots trading same lines.
I tried to track down that rumour, found no evidence of it.

The trustee seems to have full control of when to sell, the ex GOX owner say he HOPED the trustee would wait.

the 16K moved last month looks like it was sold so likely he is able to sell and can continue.


There's that and the question are they dumping? So far little proof of that. There were some moves before without a dump, why would it happen now?
Yeah, it's looking slightly less promising and was hoping we'd recover at least a little higher. 

Then again, what can you do? Crypto markets do as they please.

Might also take a bearish flair for the first time. 
I wouldn't try to advise you, but some are expecting 8800 to hold and a possible rise from there. If 8800 breaks then I would sell personally.
Yeah I'm also in the exact same situation my fellow baghodler. I'd say wait for 8.8k to break first, mightaswell cos another $100 isn't going to crash my portfolio which is literally down a decent 5 figures since it's ath position, and it hasn't been improving since besides those pumps we get and as always I decide not to take profit/sell
i do that all the time lol greed.
That's miserable and awful. 
at this stage it is very likly that CR is approved. I follow the internal forum and can say this. Would say chance of approval is \>75&#37;
Unfortunately bankruptcy courts take time to diligently assess the situation. Civil rehabilitation of the remainder of the coins is definitely a hope right now but likely given they've fulfilled their obligation to credit users in fiat at the spot price chosen. Again, it will take time and users will have 'missed out' on profits but like chewy pointed out, there will have been fomo and profit taking along the way whereas now its basically been cold storage since before the $20k bump. Don't get me wrong, I want my fing coins back, but this has kept plebs like me from taking profit when the upside is still YUGE. 
>  average official price was around 11.4k for both BTH and BTC together.

I read it was $10K.  And yes I am not super bullish on BTC, long-term, so I wouldn't even be that upset if he sold them, but should be done in any auction and not dumping on the market.  And no proof he is doing that, but it's likely.

It really doesn't matter much at this point, because if civil rehabilitation is not approved, that money will be going to Karpeles and McCaleb anyway.
it’s a figure of speech

9186 now. When will you reopen your longs?
all good man thanks, very interesting that real estate agents are openly saying this
Absolutely. In the US as well. 
Conveyancers will not accept cash.
My guess would be the following:

You: "I have 100 bitcoins I'd like to use as collateral for a home loan. That's cool, right?"

Bank: "Fuck off."

vs.

You: "I have $1 million dollars in my savings account that I earned from investing in bitcoin back in 2013. That's cool right?"

Bank: "Well of course it is! Come have a seat sir."

> Whoa, wait there a minute. Are you saying that if I want to buy a house outright, the funds made from bitcoin trading can't be used?

It depends. But as an example a friend of mine went to buy a house and his mother cashed out her pension early to loan him 150k.

The bank wanted his mother to prove where she got the funds from.

It's super asshole strict over here in the uk and we've a housing crisis of epic proportions. All avenues of affordability are closed to most people.
It depends on the AML policies of the lender and conveyancer. Conveyancers are required to ascertain the source of any funds used in a transaction to make sure they don't come from the proceeds of crime, etc; and lenders want to make sure there is no risk of the borrower failing to repay the mortgage because e.g., their accounts have been frozen pending investigation or they have been thrown in prison for tax evasion, etc.
well, that's not proof of funds. I can imagine selling a home, I've sold several, and closed hundreds, if not thousands. and I can imagine a buyer not being able to close because they lost half their assets. I was a mortgage broker during worldcom, wbvn, and enron meltdown.  I made many denial calls the days after. it was funny when people openly asked me on recorded lines, not to repull their investment account info.
I can see and hear it now.... here's a screen shot of my coisbase account..... we good to close?
Cabo is absolute horse shit.

That was a discussion i had with v4mpyre. I thought it would be easier to enter the final position and have the bot calculate from there. He thought it should be the added value since its an ADD command...
Both ways are logical, but i might revert to mine since i believe its more common sense to use.

I'll correct your position in the database.
A recent movement? Last 1-2 days?
I wish they dump it all so we can get past that threat and take them off the table for cheap.
I think we should rename it the LGD (Legendary Green Dildo)
Ah, I was defining BGD as one that breaks some kind of resistance/support and sets the tone for the foreseeable future. $300 pump could be a failed test/fakeout/random worthless piece of shit in this low volume environment.

We're all gambling aren't we. 

Dam bro, this move is gonna wipe one of us out. I'm goin the opposite direction half stack of everything i have. Godspeed nigga, Godspeed.
This is how crypto markets move. Patience is needed in consolidation phases. People who longed eos at 6$ had to wait 20 days for a move, sounds like an eternity, but then it made almost x4 real quick, better roi than if it had 10% volatility intraday and they tried to scalp it.
Yeah the Bart'ing was weird. Probably some algo's with big funds that control movements.
Right. For all we know a 1k sell wall is a whale exiting  1/4 of his long to reduce exposure and take some profits. 

Same for a buy wall. I've done it several times now and it made me realize most big walls probably don't have any intention other than to get filled. 
if you like playing with altcoins you can be a whale most of the time the books are so thinly traded, then you can see the situations whales deal with.  It's pretty mundane.. same people same trades just more 0's

>if the order book is fat you can clear the entire book before the price slips

This sentence makes no sense.
Yeah which is nice, liquidity is always great. But I'd rather use limit orders for huge orders unless liquidity is extremely thick. 

plus I stagger my orders. I'll put 20,000,000 contracts over $300 and it's nice to get it all filled. 
how you know that?
That's dark.
Any reason 4hrs? I'm thinking within 24hrs
* BGD = Big Green Dildo


I wonder how profitable a bot would be that arbs by taking advantage of liquidity issues and premiums/discounts on futures. 

Anyway it's kind of funny that this market has become so dumb that you can pretty consistently counter trade pretty successfully
It'll disintegrate entirely if $8,600 falls, or balloon back to $300 if there's a bounce. 

Sometimes it's super frustrating being at the whims of the Bitmex hive mind.

How is this drawn?
The log line is like an ex girlfriend who won’t go away
That's about $20 below my current stop, which is about $20 below my entry. It seems like I should either move mine to actual break-even (9385) or push it under 9350. It is starting to feel like a break down would probably trigger any of those stops.

Agreed, I don't care at all about the resistance line. 

for an upside breakout, the difference between triangle resistance and wedge resistance is currently $5. 
Thanks for the tag. Interesting read. What a catch-22. They want access to the crypto markets to circumvent sanctions but given that language by their central bank, they want to retain control over domestic monetary policy (obviously) so they don’t want their people to have access to it.
Note that this is charted in IRR, which I assume got devalued a bit in the recent period. If you switch to BTC volume you can notice there is still a spike, albeit a bit less drastic

I guess my issue isn't so much with downvotes themselves, it's the fact that reddit hides comments below a certain threshold by default.

Come to think of it, is there a setting for that? Have I had the power to fix that this whole time?

EDIT: Holy shit, there is! Just fixed it for myself.

I don't care about people's feelings.

I care that useful comments fall below the default threshold of -4 and are thus hidden from people who might find them useful.

Funny. I'll occasionally toss you a downvote if it looks like your username is getting upvotes (rather than the content of your post). Only here and there though.

FWIW, I do feel a little bad when I do it. Just a little though. :)

There’s nothing wrong with saying something bullish, when supported with evidence, logic and reasoning. There’s absolutely everything wrong with deluded idiots shitposting a load of bollocks that can influence less experienced and emotional traders, and that goes for both bulls and bears.
> . But it's also whenever someone says anything bullish (however unjustified it may be),you get responses like "fucking idiot" or "stfu" or "this is why moon boys are retarded".

No that is 100% incorrect.   You usually get upvotes unless it is just way over the top stupid, like the poast above.
I've been getting those same responses from bulls to my bearish comments. There are assholes on both sides. 
I see that you're talking about the comment below. and yea i get you. to be honest that stuff should really be said more in up trends. We could've all used a slap upside our heads at $19k. 

It's just that those "wake up you euphoric idiot!" slaps come way too late. 


Why does "bearish" = "Must be bearish for infinity duration"??

In 2015 the Bears were absolutely the smart ones.
You could explain it then.
Read my edit, sorry.
I think the margin pool is only for longs? I think you use your BTC to short on margin? I am probably wrong.
I believe they must have USD as margin for longs and BTC as margin for shorts. People that i see complaining from lack of margin (me included) seems to be when trying to go long
Kraken is hiring for remote work 
If you go with higher time frames then we're still in a bear flag from 10k drop.

Lower time frames can be interpreted as bull flag from 9k bounce.
Only reason I'm uncomfortable doing this is because we're long overdue for a large move and scalpers are gonna get rekt at some point you know? 
No they don't always rubber band back.   They do most of the time, which is why I am net long at the moment.  But it's far from inevitable.
Ad hominem attacks.. Zzzzzzzzzzzzz


"Next macro move will be very violent, and sustained. "
I mean he does say significant probability. The other guy is saying it's a 100% guarantee 
"significant probability" = "overconfidence" to you.   

Just give it up dude..you are lost and hopeless.
the herd is long, and they could stampede out.

For sure.  This may be picking up pennies in front of bulldozers on my part.


Hah. Same with my trading stack. Upside would be cool but downside is way worse at this point imo. 
Did you go June or Sept? I grabbed 9370 on Sept. 
Will try to set stops at break even then. I forgot you are using Futures and there is such a difference still.

Thanks for the heads up.
At least you got the bot to register your position! :)
That's called wash trading or painting the tape and is illegal in traditional markets.
Well I didn't want to copy and paste, I don't get why it wouldn't show us 😅 

My question was more like: how often is the page refreshed? Like how do I know how recent the page is without checking the addresses myself? (which defeats the purpose of the website) 
lol I meant on the site itself! I didn't realize the addresses were links to the wallet info 
you can actually just click it on the site, you don't have to copy and paste
what's blockchain? 

I forgot I could just view the wallet themselves, I just think it's clunky the site doesn't show you directly. 

e : jk you can click on the address on the site
I just don't get why they wouldn't put it on the website itself. But thanks! 

oh nvm you can click on the address
Looks like an equal amount of BCH \(8800\) was moved also from those same wallets. Heres the links for ease:

>-95%

Thats a little to close to -100% for me to think whatever you've done isn't bugging out.

Have you perhaps somehow set it to buy high and sell low with physic powers? Try reversing your trade direction and see if you have 999999999999999% returns. Time travel makes for weird results; and it would take skill to be that wrong.
Finding the a sane summary written by someone with real knowledge is a task all its own. 
Yeah, it is really enough of article headline for people to become bullish/bearish...
yeah another boring 3% x 100 move


It has no leverage and it is small. The reason I did not close is because I keep thinking that the bottom is in and I don’t want to close at the bottom. 
Takes 0 effort to comment on your shitpost, go enjoy your vacation without updating random people about your investments, literally no one gives a fuck that you're shorting before a vacation.
Good bot. 
Alts should also go up, but they  can lose ratio to btc, so depends if you trade btc or usd ratios.
While in sideways action you can draw almost every possible formation and you'll know which one is true after it validates, so I'm trying not to pay attention to small formations here.

We broke the trend line from last drop and 9.2 is horizontal support, we're in couple of bigger formations now. It's wait and see now.
It was 20%. 
Supporting your point. Your chart wasn’t clear. Just helping.
He was giving you a compliment. You didn’t use an absolute, only stated a possibility. 
look up "capital flight" and consider how bitcoin could help with that

Money laundering to evade sanctions.
The price went from 1100 to 175, people think btc can only go up at a parabolic rate.  It can go the other way just as quick.  
Im in agreement with nor3g tbh. Not unreasonable to go down to 5k at all. Low 4ks or 3ks would signal under 2k prices as a possibility. Seems unlikely but when has bitcoin ever done thing in a non spectacular fashion?

My current bet is we're going down to the 5k area now. Dont have the chart in front of me but i saw obv, rsi, macd divs . Low seĺl volume bring the market down at point. I also feel thhe majority of this move was a giant short squeeze that gave the bulls enough steam to pay attention. I think its going to struggle at the 9-12k range
If the daily bands break down then yes I do expect that, even 3k or lower wouldn't surprise me. So I guess I am out of my mind?  
No gox coins were dumped today, they were transfered 12 hours before the dump and they are still in the same wallet they were transfered to. We broke down because the bulls were too weak to push through 9.4k after trying and failing for a fucking day. Noone was talking about the gox coins before we dumped. People just want a narrative, an excuse because they can't admit they're wrong. Bullish momentum is barely hanging on, the most bullish thing right now would be consolidation until the weekly lower band catches up and the weekly macd turns green.

Ehh, if 9300 holds, 9380 should be safe.
look at the bigger picture. i am looking at 1d and weekly and im turning bearish as fuck right now
$14,000 drop is the real deal, unfortunately.
you're the whole reason i longed that dip.. im stuck at 9130.  
come on man.. CONSENSUS.

That's called manipulation.
this was not a low volume drop...all of the rises have been on low volume, sell offs have been higher volume 
That's why I say they wicked below but it really depends how you draw. If it's broken but holds just below then it's not broken yet. It'll be broken when they drop more than couple bucks.

> I don't know his argument, but doesn't extreme hoarding present an issue when another similar asset doesn't encourage hoarding?
> 
> I know ETH isn't BTC, but his argument was that people will swap to ETH if BTC starts being hoarded to an extremely disproportionate degree. Which makes sense.

But then the price drops and hoarders sell. It's dynamic.

>Is it really smart to invest in an asset that's being hoarded? This market really cannot provide the liquidity for anywhere near the amount of coins available. If these hoarders show up en masse, liquidity will absolutely falter and the market will crumple upon itself when hoarders all simultaneously try to exit. We saw an example of this after the melt up to $20k: $16k to $11k in one day.

Yes and then the market corrects. If the asset is failing because of hoarding then hoarders will unload the coins as the price falls, which solves the initial problem. 

Once some sort of equilibrium is reached at a price that actually makes sense for the asset (let's say $100K BTC for example) then the hoarders no longer have a reason to hoard for further price increases.

>The dump to $6k stopped when the transaction backlog finally cleared. We literally didn't stop dumping until hoarders were out of coins to dump.

Exactly, those old addresses started to move and those hoarders were no longer hoarders.

>Maybe this isn't his argument, but I can't see hoarding (e.g. hodling) to be a good thing long term

I just can't see how it's not self correcting. Hoarders aren't going to hoard if the price is going down because of hoarder, ya hoard?


edit: lol, you posted this like 5 seconds after I tagged you below. I was like "holy shit he types fast".

edit 2: whoops I forget what we we're actually talking about, which is actual lost coins, not hoarded coins. Does liquidity get worse when coins are permanently lost? I think not because the market will rebalance the float.

> The "market cap" of bitcoin is based off the total created supply, not the available supply. So as coins are lost, fewer are available, which means the price goes up. However, that doesn't mean the actual amount of cash in the system has risen, just the supply has restricted, artificially so.

The market cap is meaningless in this conversation. If the coins are truly lost then they're no longer part of the *circulating supply* (but coinmarketcap and other sites will still calculate market cap based on *issued supply*). I agree that the supply has been reduced, which would be the reason for price increase.

>Hoarding causes the same effect as losing coins. The bad part is that a rising price increases hoarding (who wants to sell something that's going up).

This is wrong. Hoarded coins are still part of the circulating supply and market theory would suggest that these coins are still available for sale at a certain price (up and/or down). These hoarded coins are not part of the *float* so long as they're hoarded.

>As hoarding increases, fewer coins are on the market, which means liquidity actually drops because the average liquidity is based on those utilizing the coins, not the speculators. 

This is wrong. Liquidity is relative to float and circulating supply, not relative to some absolute number of coins. When the circulating supply changes, the markets readjust (price goes up to a point where 'hoarders' introduce additional coins to the float).

>When fewer coins are on the market, users leave for alternatives because the cost of using goes up, further reducing liquidity.

So you're saying that hoarders sell there coins for alts? Don't you see how this dynamic corrects for liquidity?

Pretty sure you're wrong about this point. Would appreciate someone else chiming in. /u/MikeXBT? /u/sloppysynapses? You guys know anything about this?

Together with Bitcoin Cash it was around 11.4k \(10.1k for BTC or so\)

Trustee sold nearly equal amount of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. 
I agree on Binance and bitfinex being immoral actors, but my thoughts are currently that crypto as a whole is a new speculative horse to ride at the track. It's gambling. Right now the only people involved are A) in it for the tech or B) in it for the money. The majority are the latter. Gamblers need casinos to play I mean hell Mt. Gox was the biggest piece of shit ever but it allowed btc to go through its initial fractals before the big bump. Unfortunately we need people like finex and Binance out there to prop us up until regulation and experienced actors get involved. Is the outcome perfect? Absolutely not, but necessary. 
A complete 180 here that breaks above $9,400 might see me reopen a long.

Other than that, I'm more interested in shorting a bounce back up to $9,300 here.
Would you have to disclose where the cash come from though? My knowledge of US and UK finance laws is limited. 
I would not advise disclosing that you earned it from investing in bitcoin in this scenario. 
North American white women at college frat parties. You don’t know sloppy until you see that 
Ya, I don't really have much to throw into the debate. Both are equally logical. 
Then the add command would be an edit command.

Why would you like to add with actual entry (like open 9100 and add 9200) but set final leverage (10x)? I'm adding actual price but lev is final?

That's a bit illogical. Either I go with add as an edit and set my final average and leverage (open 9100, added at 9200, went from 5x to 10x so my add command will look like .long add 9150 10x) or I go with add as an add (so my add command will look like .long add 9200 5x). Going with add as combined add and edit is confusing...
Fair enough. I don't think there's a clear definition of a BDG on investopedia or anything :P

A $300 pump IMO would actually be more significant than a $300 dump, though, as it would break 9400-9600 range. A $300 dump would just put us back to yesterday. No idea what to expect here, though. 
Yup, at the end of the day this is all calculated gambling..GL :)
grats dude !
I've been here for a while, I know how this moves, but lately it moves really slow if you compare to weeks/months ago. We've been in 20% range for like 3 weeks now.
Not was, are. We're still moving like that but not so violently. Look at the chart, drop to 9-9.2 range, move up to 9.2-9.4 range, we just were in 9.8-10k range after we moved from 9.6-9.8 range, when we bounced off 10k we dropped to 9.6-9.8 again just to move down to 9k...
Little of column A, little of column B.

It's like poker, where a big bet could mean a big bluff...or pocket aces. Keeps things interesting.
people put their orders based on the current market price, if you have a huge supply to sell, you can fill all those orders before the market can react to the new true price, which would be much lower.

It's a good way to dump a medium-whale type position

In addition stop get filled, and they re-buy automatically.. you can sell into all those orders too after the quick spike up.  You clear the book twice.  Then the price plummets.  But, your position is liquidated, so you don't care.

Before the TWAP and VWAP bots and OTC markets were developed, this is how whales had to sell or buy.

So the whale took a dump and you were left holding a turd.. as he swam away laughing.






I've never used their testnet sandbox. 

Wouldn't somebody playing god by market opening a 20,000,000 position "ruin it" for the other folks using it to try to get a feel for margin trading?

Like that would instantly trigger everybody's stop loss orders, no?

If either the wedge or the triangle I have is at all accurate, we basically have to resolve it in the next 6-8. The old annoying log support/resistance line (purple) seems to be adding to the pressure as well. I'm not sure, but I'm happy enough to be long 1.5% below with b-e stops. 
Correct, had me a morning brainfart.
The thing is there is some human analysis here as well. Sometimes premiums are justified or "earned", as in they manifest slowly after a solid bull run.  We went from damn near zero premium to large premiums all in the bull trap that touched $10k. 
Thank you!

There were plenty of slaps at $19K...but they were mostly ignored and downvoted here.
Actually, in 2015, the year ended on a modest high, not a low, and so the bears *weren't* the smart ones.  But I digress. The problem with the terms 'bull' and 'bear' is that they're basically meaningless *unless* you specify the time frame you're talking about.
LOL my mistake. I read JPY and my brain read Bitfinex as Bitflyer. You're right, I'm completely wrong.
you use your BTC as a collateral both ways, but you still borrow from kraken. at least I have had the same margin error both ways
I have like 8000% margin level right now
only bulls would complain about lack of margin a short would just not go short.

FOMO causes leveraged buying.. FUD generally causes longs to shuck their positions.  Shorts are ninjas taking their positions calmly and cooly.  They are arrogant though and don't respect the power of the bull stampede.



True, it's not risk free by any means... usually you know it when you see it...  it's all just price delta/time ... which is more or less what RSI is just with smoothing functions.  These are trades you enter and exit fairly quickly and require a very different strategy than longer plays.  I did well in last years' run up scalping tops when price occasionally went bonkers.  This was easier when BitMex worked in real-time o_0


Well I hope you would agree that price doesn't move in one direction forever.. and so when it's completely overextended within a circumscribed time frame, one can trade against it and catch the recoil.  It's a bit of a black art identifying these things.  I don't think this current drop is anything like capitulation... more of the market getting spooked and right now figuring out direction.

June. Liquidity is too low on September. 

There's also a greater risk for the premium moving against me there. 
It's also par for the course on BFX (and sometimes Binance). Exchanges DGAF (yet), volume drives their profits. 
The future is now!
Yeah that looks a bit odd. At half an hour of lag the score is much better, maybe I'm accidentally leaking some data when the lag period is the same as the rebalance interval.

I also generated artificial bear markets by taking the inverse (1/x) and reverse (travel backwards in time) of existing stock data. Here are my findings:

* on the normal and the inverse+reverse data (bull market), hourly rebalancing outperforms daily rebalancing with 3.9% per month.  
* On the invere and the reverse dataset (bear market), hourly rebalancing *underperforms* weekly rebalancing by 2.9%.  

I conclude that rebalancing result in increased market exposure, which is positive in a bull market but negative in a bear market. I think this explains a large part of shrimpy's supposed buy&hold outperformance.

Methodology: the same 55 stocks as on the shrimpy website. Data from poloniex. From 2017/04/01 to 2018/05/01, I selected 100 overlapping slices of 1 month to use as data. Each portfolio with two stocks (one stock + bitcoin) was tested on every slice of data. Each test was assigned a score based on the outperformance (in bitcoin) of rebalancing compared to holding over the entire 1-month slice. The figures reported are the averages of all (55000) tests.

I also tested 2-hourly, 4-hourly and 12-hourly rebalancing, the results are very consistent: in all my tests, more frequent rebalancing is better in a bull market, and less frequent rebalancing works better in a bull market. 

There is also a factor of about 3.5% per month that I can not yet explain. Possible explanations include: accurately buying the dip or inaccuracies in my backtesting engine. I suspect the latter.
he's not shorting though.. wanna apologize?? 
Hey! You can fuck off.
##k
Oops sorry I’m referring to BTC ratio not USD 
yeah really nothing matters in between $8.8 and $10k. I'm just bored 😞
Considering most confirmed trends see volumes between 30-40k on gdax, again I say that's peanuts

Edit: also if we go by % would you say a 20% increase in 24 hr volume of say 100 btc (so 120) is comparable to a 20% in 24hr volume of 1000 btc (1200) ?
Thanks for clarifying.. right now my eyes are on $8950 as well

yea, lots of people longing this thangy and expecting new highs despite us just going sideways, it's gettin wonky
We're bouncing off close to 9.4. (like we just did)

Either wait for a break or another bounce off 9.2. 9.3 is nothing here.

/u/zenist69 that's for you also.
I agree, but if you bought the bottom of it and not the top, then it's nbd
CONSENSUS my ass 

Russia and bears is the ultimate combo now i'm starting to see it!
I disagree with that statement, I'm going to start tracking 24hr volume and posting the charts because I really don't think people pay attention to volume here.

I'm sure I'll get downvoted for saying that too lol
Being below their low on the bull flag for more than two hours is more than just a little wick. Unless you are looking at a higher time frame, then I would agree. 
It's does seem like the market dips before shooting up. It did it on the first of two attempts at 11700. Almost as is it's the market toying with us.
What if it breaks down though, isn't that more likely given this level?
Chewy-approved 80x YOLO long. In with 0.1% of stack. 
You'd do stops under $9250?
so, one can risk $10\-$15 to gain $1k. \(Open a 1000 contract long at 9340, stop loss at 9200 and take profit at $19k\)
> Also I have monitored the Binance order books for a long time.

I trade on Binance all the time. The order books don't have a lot of standing orders on less popular alts because there simply are too many coins for any market maker / arbitrage op to cover them all, and a lot of trading there is done with short-term goals in mind so it's not like 'normal' people keep very deep orders placed, either. They also need to be balanced vs BTC, ETH, BNB, and sometimes USDT prices. There's more than enough 'real' volume for orders to get filled whichever way if you simply leave a limit order near spot price. 

Heck, the article you linked straight up says there's no real reason to be suspicious about Binance, but you've linked it anyway because...?
I skimed the article, but doesn't it reveal the bad liquidity more than anything (which I mentioned in my post) ? It seems to equate slippage/bad liquidity to "fake" volume, and while it could be "fake" if generated by the exchange (hard to prove), it could also be a mass of trading bots and retail traders that do market orders.
Lol yeah you tagged me and I thought it was a reply to my comment I was like how the fuck did he respond so fast. 

And yes, I get your point that the market corrects. My main point would be that the supply *still* overwhelms demand because the majority of coins never participated in true price discovery and liquidity is not there to handle it. 

The jist of the argument is that the more market participation, the higher liquidity and the more "true" prices are. Since supply has been artificially restricted through hoarding, true price is far below real price and, depending on how many coins hoarders hold (which is *a lot*), this could completely devastate the market. 

But yeah his original argument is about supply being lost. Which, really, provides liquidity the other way (in the bid side) 
I think his general point is that hoarding disallows true price discovery. Ideally the price would rise with as many market participants as possible to allow for max liquidity and price discovery. 

As an extreme example (but really pretty close to what's happening with bitcoin), imagine there are 100 bitcoins and 10 people are given 10 each. 

The market trades 10 btc per day in terms of volume. But most of this is the same fractions of a bitcoin being passed around. The price goes parabolic, from $1 to $20k in years.

However, only 1/100th of of the total supply has really participated in price discovery. 

99 of the original bitcoins have been hoarded. The price has gone parabolic, why would the original 10 people sell the majority of their holdings? 

But one decides to cash out. He starts throwing his stash at the market. Sells an entire btc and begins to crash the entire market. The price begins to recover until another original holders decides to cash out one of their bitcoin before the price tanks again. Then the market begins a race to get out with as much liquidity as possible. it's no longer a who can hold the longest, it's who can hold onto their coins the longest before getting dumped on. 

Basically becomes a game of chicken

I've been meaning to do some actual reading on this as I'm sure there are finance textbooks that cover a concept like this in depth. From my thought experiments though I simply can't see how hoarding wouldn't reduce liquidity...

And to your comment that liquidity is based on all coins, not just coins available on the market currently: well, yes. But hoarders present the scenario where price is discovered with an artificial restricted supply. Price shoots up because the market assumes that supply is extremely restricted when in reality the hoarder is simply waiting to unload. 
Technically, not true.
Look, I don't know if you know this about me, but [I'm prolific](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8i8zaj/prolific_antibch_poster_ugypsytoy_cannot_provide/).
Ok that makes sense. 
I'm not feeling confident in that short entry presenting itself on spot. 
Why the change in sentiment if you were bullish earlier? Because it was a high volume drop? 

You said you'd expect strong support at $9k.. Just shorting $9300 for the r/r since a $100/btc loss is small? 
Depends on your time frame. If you're buying outright 100% cash, it may not apply. If you're using crypto as any portion of downpayment with the intention of still receiving a mortgage, then yes, within limits. Many banks/mortgage brokers want to see a history of funds ranging anywhere from 2 months to 2 years. If the liquidation from crypto into cash predates the history they care to review, you're fine. But if you want to put $100K down on a house in June and try to sell your crypto now, they'll tell you to take a hike. 
> I would not advise disclosing that you earned it from investing in bitcoin in this scenario. 

This. However they still will want to see where that 1 million came from and the original source of the money (the investment amount).

At least here in the UK. But, it could be argued that if you made that much you could buy outright and no bank could turn you down. It's when borrowing it is super strict.
There's a reason they call it *white girl wasted*.
I thought so too until I saw the average British drinker.
Just that it's easier to enter the value you see in Bitmex or whatever, instead of remembering what it was before and doing the math before entering the command.
Will change it and enable it on the test site before putting it in production.

By the way, thanks for the Short, i know you thought it was a dumb move given the conditions but it worked out. Stops @breakeven, not losing money this time at least!
It's not going to matter much once Bitcoin Legacy reaches $0.
I agree, totally illogical, but from an usability perspective it's easier that way. Even move since if i add stack % it will add it and not treat it as a final value, but in that case is easier to enter the value since we know the amount  being added.

It really isn't an edit command per se because it will actually do some calculations with that value, instead of just setting the new values like with the update command.

Never used Bitmex but i think you can just change your leverage with a slider and if you want to add to the position you make another order, is that so?
Closed a quarter of my shorts before the dildo. Not gonna get crowbar fucked again so waiting for bounce in the next 12 hrs. If no bounce I'm still skeptical of fall (but keeping remaining shorts). If bounce then going all in short
True, but I do feel like the movement has become slightly different though. The Bart's felt more like attempts to pump or dump, see if the market would follow, when it didn't abandon the attempt an price restores to the previous level.

The recent movements up to the 10k attempt I think are just people trading based on horizontal supports and indicators. Though I do agree it all feels slightly unnatural and orchestrated, though I don't know if its due to human behaviour, or the fact that most of the market consists of bots with algorithmic-trading. 
That's not clearing the *entire* book, that's buying or selling or selling into a wall. Clearing out the book means taking out a chunk of orders and moving the price up or down in one fell swoop. Clearing out the *entire* book would presumably mean taking out every order on one side of the book but this just doesn't happen and wouldn't be advantageous to the market maker. We seen some extreme market sells from time to time though.

Also, your conception of 'true price' doesn't make much sense either. The price is what it is. If the books are thick then the price won't move from a big market sell. They may adjust downwards afterwards but this conception of 'true price' doesn't really make sense. 
no tesnet money is almost as valuable as real money
you got testnet money?   I'll buy it off you 2:1

ya lol it was kinda fucked up but the market price was already way off when I did it. I think it was on futures, too, and everybody on testnet uses swaps to practice trading since everywhere else is extremely illiquid. 

I think I got a few futures orders filled at like $3k when we were at $11k a while back. 
look up triangular arbitrage. it's eth, btc and usd generally.

5,170 BTC 24 hour volume on GDAX

I know there was a brief outage but sheesh
Volume is still very low, but we're like an hour before normal trading peak, so it can get on strength soon.
Thanks. Want to add it to mine.
I added the last 20% in the drop to 9510 and pulled my average up to 9410 and set stops at 9415. With the premium, that should translate to roughly 9250, which should signal a clear breakdown of the pennant. If I was going to get stopped at break-even anyway, might as well swing for the fences.

!long XBTUSD add 9340 20%

You are literally responsible for Satoshi's disappearance. You follow Bitcoin Legacy's sabotage of the Original Dream^TM and insist on supporting a false set of prophets, who have deviated from the Vision outlined in the White Scripture and instead opted to worship Satan with sacrificial fees. You are Bilderberg scum.
Yeah. Back when I was a moon boy I tagged several people here as "FUDders" and I now think they're pretty smart, lol 
I was talking about kraken, they need to have usd to lend for longs and btc for shorts 
Yes it's an art and a science identifying them....because they don't always rubber band back.
You two need to spend some time apart.

Y'all lost money today, didn't you ;)
Of course.  But it takes some common sense  (and an IQ north of 90) to recognize that.
Definitely not a fact...
You are funny.
I don't get why they wouldn't just put it on the original website though. Seems like it could be a lot easier to read lol 
3.5% suggests a 0.00520833333% fee per rebalancing, if rebalancing is moving 1% of the stack that would be a .5% fee

I would believe that's accurately testing for fee's if that's roughly correct.
Now your statement makes a lot more sense
Bigger thing to worry is that mex premium went down on this last drop.

Hard to predict what will happen here.
[deleted]
Okay, I will wait for the break around 9.38-9.4 and see whether it will hold water before I make another lousy bet again.
24h volume doesn't matter if the big move happened in 1 hour. 

the 24h volume for BGD day was pretty low but here we are at $9k. 


Don't you think that when bear flag breaks down then the price goes down? If it's just below the line of a bear flag then I'd say that your line is too high.
Its back in the flag now i beleive
The market action since the bounce off $9,000 is forming an ascending triangle:

https://imgur.com/a/TnzjxOb

This is a bullish formation, which one would typically expect to break upwards. 

It certainly doesn't *have* to break up, but the expectation is that it will.
Yeah, initial target between 9250-9200, tough I'd imagine we might go lower assuming many will have tight S/L in place.
Would probably be a good idea, yes. 

Maybe around $9,217 or so. 

I could see a false breakdown dropping the market to $9,250 fairly easily before buyers have a chance to step in front of the dump.
That's quite a bold leap from "breaking above $9,400" to "taking profit at $19K."

But yes, that's how 100x leverage works. 

Although your liquidation point is well above $9,200. It would be closer to around $9,280 or so at 100x leverage. 
Allright, you're correct. I don't have any evidence.

But I find those extreme volumes very suspicious with those empty orderbooks.

Since supply has been artificially restricted through hoarding, true price is far below real price and, depending on how many coins hoarders hold (which is a lot), this could completely devastate the market.

Yeah, my point more relates to long term liquidity and mechanisms for self correction but yes if the float:circulating supply ratio is too small then that leads to poor liquidity in the short term. Long term this will naturally correct.

But in terms of *lost* coins, I don't see how that has an effect either way for the same reason. If coins are lost from hoarders then this doesn't affect the float and, like you said, adds theoretical liquidity to the buy side (and the price would go up). If coins are lost from the float (exchange loses their coins [not a hack]), then sell side liquidity is damaged but hoarders will correct for this by adding coins to the float to sell for attractive "bubble" prices.

Would still like to hear /u/MikeXBT's thoughts. I'm sure there's a more elegant and cogent way of describing this.
Yeah but that still doesn't negate the fact that those coins *are* available under some price scenario (either during a crash or moon). 

I can see how this would be problematic if the underlying asset didn't actually have fundamental worth to the market and was just being traded to be sold higher (cough cough alts). In this case, once hoarders dump on a collapsing market, this can destroy buy side liquidity and collapse the market entirely. 

However, if the asset actually does have value/utility (assume BTC does have *some* value) then these dump will bottom out when buyers decide that coins are on fire sale. Once this happens the liquidity is re-established and coins have successfully moved hands from hoarders to new hands. I just think this idea of hoarding is self-defeating because even hoarders have their price that they will sell (both moon and dump).

Still, this is a bit off topic because the original point was that lost (or burned) coins decrease liquidity, which I just cannot understand how the market would react dynamically to this. (these coins can't be dumped by anyone because they're gone. Total number of coins shouldn't matter, just liquidity relative to circulating supply and float.

Also, the correct term is hodler, not hoarder.
In what way is it not true?

Price was about $1700 a year ago. 530% up in a one year time span is not "up a ton"??!
I was just reading that. 

Taking a step back, I have to admit there’s some comedic irony to the idea that the state of the world has (d)evolved to the point that there’s a faux Bitcoin^(℠) …  

..whose number 2 promoter/figurehead is literally a fake Satoshi.
I'm so mad I got banned from there
I'm pretty confident. Not sure if I'll want to take it if the opportunity presents itself though, but this should bounce at least back into the $9,200 - $9,250 area before $9,000 falls.
Mostly just from an r/r perspective, yes. 

I wish I had exited my long and opened a short right when the formation broke, but bitmex shit the bed very rapidly.
really? I thought they just report to your local tax office and are otherwise happily taking the money?
Lads on tour are only trumped by Irish Gingers so drunk they drink the bong water
It was a reckless entry, but I'm glad it worked out for you. 

You've got some wiggle room now, and if $8,600 falls then it should be a bullet proof entry for at least awhile. 

Hope it works out well for you. 
You can change leverage without order, it just takes some margin in or out. If you do an order it can change your leverage. Mex is a bit messed with that whole leverage and entry, you enter how much usd you want to buy and if you have there 1btc then buying 10k at 10k spot price is 1x lev, but when the price is 5k then you buy 2x with 10k, so you already have to count how much you need to buy to go with leverage you want if you go with 100%. But you can go with 0.25btc order with 4x lev, which would be the same as 1x with 1btc, but you've set 0.25 so that's max amount you can lose and your liq price is closer than with 1x lev.

That's why I think that add should be add. If I'm adding contracts at some price that doesn't mean I change leverage, cause I can manually set it at fixed 5x, but then I'm changing % of stack that I used for that... Either way you'll have to manually count something. So if you want to change behavior I would go with 'edit' type, so that I put my final average with final leverage, cause that's what I can read easily from my screen.
Yeah, now you can actually apply some TA on those moves, earlier it was out of nothing, it suddenly popped, just to pop again and drop hard, no line that could catch those moves.

For some reason the bot must have lost connection to the stream of comments. Rebooted the bot and all started working again.

I'm testing running the bot in a proper server instead of that old raspberry pi back home. That should bring some performance and stability increase.

You should thank me for making Satoshi disappear. 

The fact that his coins are presumed lost should increase the value of any coins held by yourself. 

Also, upvoted!
ahh ok, yes that clarifies things
I said above I was short, so you can do the math (if capable).  But yes there are a lot of irritable longs and holders here, as is clear when you call them out on their nonsense.

That whole thing started with someone saying there is 100% chance of a bounce here.  That is delusional, but I get it.

Another reply disagreeing/downvoting but with no substance to it.  Come on guys...

Here I'll spoon feed you all

> According to John Bollinger, periods of low volatility are often followed by periods of high volatility. Therefore, a volatility contraction or narrowing of the bands can foreshadow a significant advance or decline. Once the squeeze play is on, a subsequent band break signal sthe start of a new move. A new advance starts with a squeeze and subsequent break above the upper band. A new decline starts with a squeeze and subsequent break below the lower band.

I'd love if you actually CONTRIBUTED to the conversation other than "you're too overconfident about your statistically proven correct comment".  I'm open for discussions, but you're being both shallow AND pedantic.
Suspected Psy ops account. Or just an idiot. Same thing really
John Bollinger even commented publicly about how the BBands are squeezing tighter than they've done in 125 days
The 3.5% is a positive factor. The average benchmark (whether 1, 2, 4, 12 or 24-hour rebalance period) outperformed buy&hold by 3.5% per month over all tests (including inverse/reverse data).

The fee I used was 0.2%, and every trade was made without slippage at the first price half an hour into the future. I did a quick test to see how much was lost due to fees. For 1-hourly rebalancing, 0.64% of the portfolio was paid in fees per month, and 0.22% for daily rebalancing.

This implies a portfolio turnover of between 3 to 1 per month. That is quite a lot, I checked the stats on some equally weighted indices in the stock market and they have a turnover of around 10-20% per year.

Upon closer inspection I'm not sure if the unexplained 3.5% can be explained by inaccuracies in my backtesting engine. Assuming a portfolio turnover of 3 per month, even with a slippage of 1% this strategy is still profitable. That sounds excessive.
it did?? futures?? they've been at $150 since drop to $9250 earlier today 
[deleted]
I'd rather wait for a bounce off bottom than play the break out. Too many fake outs lately and between 9.2 and 10k there's practically no line that can hold.
So basically because one/ a few people sell  within an hour that means we are heading for a huge drop across the board? Sounds more like someone is trying to start a market sell off.

But it's fine you have your opinion and I have mine, I've learned to trust myself over others and it's worked out for me so far.

I just remember how bullish everyone here was around 11.6k when volume was right around the same and we all know how that all turned out.

Edit: also how bearish everyone was at 6k

Edit2: also I am in no way a day trader and are more of a swing trader so a $300 drop is nbd
I also see it as a triangle and not a wedge. But wouldn't surprise me if it broke down. Set my stops a bit bellow my entry to try and avoid wicks, its better to risk losing 0.5% than to breakeven and have it bounce right after. 
if we break above 9400, then i would expect the ascending formation to continue to 11,300. If we see 11,300 then 20k should be within sights.

Im not using 100x levg. Just setting stops at 1\-2&#37;
>Would still like to hear /u/MikeXBT's thoughts. I'm sure there's a more elegant and cogent way of describing this.

Hoarding is commonplace with regard to all assets expected to appreciate, from equities to gold bars... Most forms of fiat discourage hoarding by utilizing inflation. The vast majority of shares issued by every public blue chip, index fund and the like are "hoarded". If every hoarder of  these equities was to sell, the market would crash. This is an extremely unlikely "Black Swan Event" which is not particular to Bitcoin. 

Bill Gates is hoarding his shares of MSFT. An immense number of shares is held by those expecting to hold until retirement and live off dividends. The stock would be in shambles if they all decided to sell now. A large number of their shareholders also invested years ago at a substantially reduced price, comparable to Bitcoiners who grabbed their coins in the hundreds a couple of years ago... there is a long way to go before these people feel pressured to sell. 
> I can see how this would be problematic if the underlying asset didn't actually have fundamental worth to the market and was just being traded to be sold higher 

Actually that describes bitcoin as well. It's fundamental value is significantly lower than where we are now.

Here's a good example. Imagine there are 100 coins out there. Imagine the price is worth $1/coin. So the total market cap is $100 coins. If you sell a coin for $2/coin, now the market cap is $200 even though the underlying cash value stored is only V1+$2. If you lose a coin, from here, then you have the same market cap, $200, but only 99 coins. Since the real value is V1+2, it's gone up a little to V1+2/99 (instead of V1+2/100). This means there's more value per coin but it also means there's less liquidity because assumed supply is higher than actual supply. This causes people to think volatility will be lower and larger moves can be absorbed better (which is false). Volatility will actually be higher, and therefore liquidity will have fallen.
True that it's off topic but I personally find the liquidity issue more interesting because it's essentially at the core of all bitcoin price speculation.

And really, if you understand the argument with alts you understand it with bitcoin, it's just that the argument isn't as strong. 

Bitcoin has significantly more liquidity compared to alts but how much more? The % moves we see in alts to bitcoin (800% in a month to 100% in a month) are roughly the same difference in factors that we see from bitcoin to conventional assets (100% in a month to ~10% in a month) 

As long as bitcoin is still a primarily speculative investment (instead of actually being used, and I'm not arguing it's not used, just value : usage is disproportionate), the liquidity provided won't match actual supply because demand isn't truly being tested in a multitude of ways. 

With an asset like gold it had thousands of years for people to speculate on its value. There were no hoarders with 5% of the entire world worth of gold that could dump on the entire gold market to crash its price.

It wasn't easy to do it but people traded it for a multitude of things. Actual price discovery. Bitcoin is hardly being traded for anything other than fiat: its value is purely speculative and the price discovery is based primarily on artificially restricted supply (I want  to sell my bitcoin higher, I will sell 1/10 here to secure profits, oh yes me too, me too) as opposed to a truly restricted supply (I need/want to sell all of my bitcoin because I need money for other things). 

Bitcoin has never endured a global recession before. It makes you wonder how well it would actually hold up when all of the supply is reintroduced to the market simultaneously. It could easily be 2014 or even worse given issues with liquidity 

I don't know, could be completely off and out of my depth, but just musing on it, there are very real issues with liquidity that hoarding (erm, hodling :D) presents. 

Edit; my main point is that you're saying these coins are available in *some* price scenario. Yes, that's true, but what if that scenario hasn't occurred yet? What if the true price discovery hasn't even really begun to occur? and that's why it consistently moons and moons? I mean it's only been 9 years. In 40 years sure it could be $1mm but between here and then it could easily go back to, say $300. And would $300 REALLY be bad for bitcoin?? 

In fact I'd say $300 is *better* if that meant more market participants, more distribution, and more liquidity. 
A ton is $100k, BTC is not even worth 10% of that! Sad!
Yeah when you *really* think about all the dynamics going on with BCH it's just amazing how the whole thing comes together. Literally there are signs of trouble at ever turn but the 'community' just collectively shifts the narrative and marches forward towards the abyss. It's a strange thing to witness.


That thread is like a really well written soap opera, imo. It may be my proudest accomplishment on reddit. 
Yes, will try to add to the position if this bounces above 8900 or something, if not just let it ride.
On the test site there is already an update command being tested. Along with the new parser. The update does just that, changes the parameters you entered without calculations.

That way people can use the one they prefer. Will leave the add as is (that means going back with last night changes on the test site :) ) and probably add some info on the help message to explain this things.
Well that's a bunch of nonsense but okay. I can never quite tell what level of troll you're turned to.
It's mainly just fun pretending to be a whale, but my main goal is to compare my actual trades with my testnet trades due to different trading styles.

I'm trying different approaches on testnet where I open and close a bit more frequently and trade solely on risk/reward as opposed to a combination of r/r and where I think the market is going to go next.


Hope you don't talk about btc price ;)
its low on binance too dipping under 20k, havent seen that in forever.

You're probably right and it'll probably end badly for me. I wasn't particularly a fan of my entry to start with, heh.

Sorry, was just joking around about the increased air of argumentativeness in more than a few people, thought maybe it was correlated to the move.
> it will

> That's a fact

Maybe sloppy just means that the future cannot be stated as a fact.
Where does any of that say "this will literally always happen 100% guaranteed"? Yes there is a strong chance it will happen. That in no way guarantees it as fact 
Are you 14?
The conversation speaks for itself.
And what I just wrote?
[deleted]
It is good strategy. But I am too far away from bottom. So the second best thing is to bet on break out or potential break out...
Well, no, I was just countering your point that a low volume day nullifies high volume moves. 

This entire move up since $7k has been pretty low volume. The inability to pass $10k despite being literally $10 away makes me think things are pretty bearish, actually. 

And I'm not a day trader either, I've been holding my  swaps short position open for 16 days. 

Keep in mind sub is more bullish than bearish right now by a factor of two, if you're trying to contrary trade (and this poll was taken after the dump to $9100, so results before that would've been even more bullish) 

https://strawpoll.me/15672326/r
After I added the rest just now, we have similar entries and exits, it would seem. 
>It's fundamental value is significantly lower than where we are now.

According to who?

(sounds like you're just a permabear who will say anything that sounds bearish, whether or not it makes sense)
I see. So you're just moving the goalposts ever farther away. 

(a better troll could do much better than this... Sad!)
You know, you should do as intuitive and exact as it should be, people will get used to it after couple tries. Chevy did 3rd command, 1st add so he just guessed how it may work. Good help and it should go smoothly.

Good job with that bot BTW ;-)

whoosh
absolutely - you're 5 replies in with nothing substantial to offer.
oh I thought you meant drop from $370 to $340 

meh I don't see it as a big deal. premium is probably due to funding rates not bullishness anyway. since funding rate for shorts is mainly gone people will go back to longing swaps 
Hope you waited for that break ;-)
Yes, pretty similar. I'm above 20$ your avg entry. Same leverage and stack % also. 
Read his example tho, that's the real kicker with it all. the money entering the market doesn't equal the money that could possibly exit  (at current prices) 

I think that's what he means by fundamental value, really. If usage were higher then it'd significantly increase liquidity, too 
Think what you want. I don't care. I've held my short for 5 months and still happy in it.

I'm also massively short and haven't been nervous even on this upswing. Mad, yes, but not nervous that I'm wrong.
Wow, you're not even trying to use original sentence structures? Just copying my words now? And I am the trool?
You can try the new parser by PM to [/u/position_bot](/u/position_bot). It's running on the test site. The order of the parameters should not matter now.

It's good for A/B testing. You also feel zero emotion when using it. It's great for observing what market patterns your instincts respond to.
I dunno man, you seem to have a way with pouring fuel on a fire and didn't present things in a level headed way.

If it makes you feel better I agree that the bands are signaling a move to their boundary. 
It was a good post. By definition, you can’t say it’s a fact though... as it has not happened.. Saying “highly probable” is a more accurate statement in this situation..
You're not being "flamed"...people are telling you that no trading indicator has a 100% success rate. That's it. 
I only see that family guy quote coming from from teen-aged redditors, woosh yourself.

$30 is not a drop :P

Don't think it's about the funding rates. But yeah, will see.
Lesson learned. Stay out of sideways uncertainty movement... #$@@%...
Let's pretend like *store of value* is the only use case. None of this merchant adoption or interpersonal trading or whatever, just store of value.

Again, if you imagine that BTC has an equilibrium price, say 100K, then the market will converge towards this at some point. *The whole speculative phase prior to that point is itself the establishment of sufficient liquidity to support the equilibrium price*.

Bitcoin has to be traded in order to be distributed throughout the population. It's not like Bitcoin can be worth 100K from day one, unless it was air-dropped to the entire population. It wasn't though. It started with 1 person, then 3, then 10, etc. If the fair price was actually 100K then it'll be traded up to that point. Speculators will hoard, thinking that they'll wait until the price to reach there. Buyers will buy the books out to 100K and then speculators will dump, knowing that that's the fair value for the asset. These dumps crush the buy side liquidity and drives the price down to 10K, new buyers get in and most wait until 100K to sell again, then the same thing happens and the price crashes to 30K before buyers once again find cheap coins. Eventually 100K is reached and the price doesn't move because sufficient liquidity is available at that price and hoarders no longer have an incentive to hold out for higher prices and aren't compelled to sell. *Or* the price is always just 100K from day 1 and the entire speculative / price discovery phase is skipped entirely. But given that Bitcoin's true value and place in the future *is* unknown, the first scenario is what's happening, imo. Again, I think all hoarders have their price (and if they are truly hoarding forever then the coins should be considered lost/burned anyway) and that each time liquidity takes a hit, the market and float correct and re-balances.

Also, /u/fuckharvey is a permabear and I'm pretty sure he's just spreading FUD. He's not actually thinking in these terms, imo.
Nervous that you're wrong about what? You think Bitcoin is headed to $0 and that $20K was the all time high forever and ever?
Yeah, you're the trool.
That's actually good idea and RSS would be really easy to implement.
I'm offended that you're offended.  Get off your high horse.
I mean the premium appeared when funding rates got retarded. and now that funding rates are back to normal premium goes away. doubt it's coincidence, it's probably both though 
Don't tell me you've opened that long at 9380...
Yes, it *seems* that's what's happened. But in all reality, we could be in a less extreme scenario of: 1 guy sold his bitcoin for $100k on day one. 

you get what I mean? There's nothing stopping the market from bubbling without including genuine price discovery.

Like, maybe we haven't *really* seen a true downward pressure on bitcoin because of so many hoarders satisfied with current price increases. 

My point is that yes, I agree with you that prices are almost *always* wrong and are constantly in a state of fluctuation but what if 9 years of almost constant upward movement is just the first half of a large move? What if we're simply testing demand right now and supply will be up next? 

I don't know how to phrase what I'm saying  exactly. Hmph 
> Let's pretend like store of value is the only use case. None of this merchant adoption or interpersonal trading or whatever, just store of value.

Then it's literally worth $0 cause it has no utility. Every "store of value" has real world utility either in aesthetics or industrial use. Bitcoin has neither. It's only good for value transmission and that's it.

Also, I'm not a permabear. If you ask all of the top holders and traders, almost none of them believe in crypto in the long run. We're here cause crypto has the easiest money due to the highest concentration of dumb money. Nothing else. Once the easy money is gone and the returns fall, we'll leave to other classes.
I never said zero.
I bet u regret not having listened to my advice a few days ago!
Premium went to 0 on first 9k drop 2 days ago, then got up on pump and got lower on last drop.
After reading one too many post stating BGD is coming, I gamble at that sideway price range. Didnt wait for any breakout. (Lower than 9380... ) Cut loss when the BRD occurred... 
Yeah, my argument assumes some sort of fair value that the market will settle on. 

The real issue with liquidity is with failing assets or pump and dump schemes. I've never been part of a pump and dump scheme myself (actually that's not true, I did hold BCash for a short period of time) but the issue is that when it's time to pull the rug out and run for the exit, the buyers are simply not there and the price collapses. Actual bagholders literally can't unwind or can only do so at pennies on the dollar. 

I still think that with an asset that does have underlying value that any hit will be absorbed by buyers who believe their getting cheap coins. Take the worst case scenario, Kobayashi reveals the *he* is Satoshi and starts dumping over a million coins into the books at once. I still don't see how that isn't ultimately corrected for. He could drive down the price to <$1 and, if the asset has value, buyers will show up and liquidity will eventually be restored.

It's all about fundamentals. 
Do you not understand what *hypotheticals* are?

Mr. Fuckharvey, I disagree that almost all of the top holders do not believe in crypto in the long run. RemindMe! 6 months
I'm asking what you *do* think. In real terms.
Which advice?
That sucks... I really hoped you've listened.

You need to learn which ones to listen to. All the experts here stated that there's big possibility we'll go down before we can break that resistance. There are a lot of people here who call bgd or brd no matter of circumstances.

At least I hope the loss wasn't big. You'll get it next time.
It'll never be zero because it has a place in illegal activities (difference from illicit activities) and those will never go away.

However, $20k/coin was a joke. Without more significant adoption it can't even hold 10k.
To dump because of the incomign bear!
Yes. I remember there are quite a few posts, fellow redditors stating they will stay out of the 9300-9380 sideway movement. They don't feel safe something like that. 

Will have to bite the bullet and stride on. Cryptocurrencies trading is the game. I just have to find a way to graduate from 'keep on paying the tutorial fee' and start to make money consistently... Thanks for everything. 
I'm still confused as to your long term outlook. 
Are you an idiot? Go check the positions board before you start running your mouth. I wouldn't ever take a word you say seriously anyway. You've been appropriately labeled for a while now.
There are couple of guys that you should pay attention to. Chewtoy, sloppysynapses, joyrider and couple others.

It's not that they're always right, but their reasoning is spot on and gives you really good idea about r/r ratio on entries.
Long term, somewhere between $100 and $1k. That could be 5, 10, or 15 years out. Depends on how long it takes before people realize it's not producing them anything and they leave to return to real asset classes.
Wow, that's so rude.
And this is based on what? LN failure? A trading population of how much? Goldman Sachs canceling plans to open a trading desk? Strength of a competitor? 

How are you arriving at this price range? (which is roughly $1.7 to $17 billion market cap)
Lmao. And [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ic411/daily_discussion_thursday_may_10_2018/dystb44/) isn't? 

Go crawl back into your hole.
The fact that the world has no real *need* for bitcoin?
How's that rude. You're a very mean person.
That doesn't explain at all how you arrived at those numbers. Also, I would strongly disagree that the world doesn't have a need for cryptographically-secure, digital hard money.
