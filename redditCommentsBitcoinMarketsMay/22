[Daily Discussion] Saturday, May 12, 2018 -- TITLE
#New post: [\[Daily Discussion\] Sunday, May 13, 2018 →](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8j1gi0/daily_discussion_sunday_may_13_2018/)
Late update: Stops hit, so closed my $1mm long from $9277  posted [here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8hkslr/z/dykuw5p) between $8888 and $8922, for a total loss of 4%. Also lost around a quarter of a coin in funding fees.

I was tempted to increase my position, but the stop was well planned. As they say "the first cut is the cheapest". 
Closed my long at $8,360 for a small loss. 

Buyers need to sit in the corner for a bit and think about what they've done. That was pathetic. 

Edit: !long xbtusd close 8360
Bears here sound extremely confident that we're going below $7,800, while bulls are fetal position in the corner rocking back and forth. Any time now BGD, any time now...^he^said^nervously 
Man this series of bear flags has been relentless, keep breaking down... I feel like it's been a while since we've had this kind of consistency with flags acrually playing out 
Technically I'm still long from 9870 but it's unleveraged so I just said "fuck it" and made it cold storage.
Closed my $1mm long from $8320 posted [here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ito6f/z/dyumvvq) at an average of $8590 for a total profit of 3.2%. Trailing stops hit. 
Patience, patience and more patience. As noted [10 days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8g5owl/daily_discussion_tuesday_may_01_2018/dya3zgb/) I was waiting for the 50% retrace of the bullish swing before going long and that target was perfectly hit within $3 last night.

Had limit orders set to exchange the rest of my dollars into BTC on finex at 8220, I was asleep (TV alarms didn't work or didn't wake me) when it happened this morning so didn't manage to get a leveraged order in on Mex at the time so that will have to do for now.

**Current Scenario** 

Larger W2 ABC correction completed, in current process of building a primary W3 (which is the strongest). To confirm this the 8.2k pivot needs to hold. Over the next week we need to recover and break the W1 high at 9990 to confirm a W3 in play. This will give a interesting price target of 11770, which is smack on horizontal resistance from the failed iHS/Double Top. This should build us a larger trending channel to trade in between, if it builds textbook we can look towards the 24th May for a topping area.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/Sr1WODyc/

However until we do break that pivot at 9990 its all hopium. Buying the breakout however would be a good place to get a trade in, good chance it will be explosive.

**Bearish Factors**

*TD9 and Candles*

https://www.tradingview.com/x/TMcnGdN9/

The current daily chart is only on a red 6 or 9, this suggests 3 more days of downside action before we truly bounce. As well as the weekly spinning top followed by a bearish engulfing (2 days left on candle) paints a very weak picture.

*Elliott Forecasting*

https://www.tradingview.com/x/8HJ1LUGt/

We kind of landed in the middle of nowhere extension wise if it was an ABC, that could be fine and the larger degrees always carries more weight but its worth considering another lower target of the 1:1618 and the 0.618 retrace at 7770. If we were to spike down once more that would be another place to look for reversal.

Edit: 13:47:25 GMT+0100 (GMT Summer Time)

[This is how](https://www.tradingview.com/x/yA3au6jO/) it would ideally play out of the next month. The timing would alter depending on log or linear charting.

If you want in on this where could you do it from? I see two places:

[Buy a failed push lower using 8.2k as a SL](https://www.tradingview.com/x/PWImIkoX/) or

[Buy the break of the W3 Pivot using a 2% stoploss](https://www.tradingview.com/x/k1kbtF9S/), its either going to break with strength quickly or fail quickly. Keep the stop tight.

Long $1mm @ $8320. Expecting a spike due to Consensus, the short term bottom is unlikely to be far off. Stops at 5%, may add to this position. 
Another dump looks imminent. Low volume and buys look increasingly anemic.
Honestly I find it weird how apathetic I am about this. The last few months I was one of the people who freaked out about any dips but on this dip I just go "more downtrend, whatever, I wonder how low it will go". I still like reading and commenting in this sub though, that has not changed, but I just find myself to not be worried about the price at all.
Wow.. This bitcoin just refuses to go up...
This thread is just becoming a journal of people closing and opening shorts and longs.  Is that really anything anyone would want to read?
Volume is still disaster. Wonder if people who got rekt just got tired of these pumps and dumps to squeze shorts/longs. RSI on every level from 6hr below is extremely oversold. Like it wasnt in years, yet the bounce is still nowhere, nor is volume.
Seems like that might have been the technical bounce after all. It didn't last very long, but RSI is cooled off everywhere but the 4H. We spent 7 candles under 30 yesterday, though, so I'm not overly concerned by that. I went ahead and reopened short (50% of entry) here at 8350 on the breakdown. I'll add the rest if we get over 8500 and bail over 8650. 

A bit early to be drawing resistance lines of this pop, but this will be an interesting formation to watch: https://www.tradingview.com/x/u0MkImX6/

*Could* play out with a falling wedge down to 8K with another heavy technical bounce there. 

Edit to add: If 8250 falls, I'll be setting stops just over 8400. If 8200 falls, they'll go to b/e.
Okay so I didn't look at the charts for a couple of hours, but it seems like it's been an emotional rollercoaster from the posts on here.

MY snapshot analysis before I hit the sack, we're still oversold, but the market is weak. The BGD was nice, but looking at the chart the only thing I'm seeing right now is a bearish pennant developing. These normally break down, but being oversold and because it's bitcoin it could bounce up. Level to watch for a breakdown is 8.3k, and a breakout would be 8.5k-ish.

For me, this is no man's land and I'll wait for a clearer picture tomorrow. 

Best of luck to all the longers and shorters, and be sure to let me make pretentious profile pics with all your lambo's! 
Looking at this bounce area, we are "supposed" to bounce at least to the 8700-8800 area of fib zones and significant EMA's, but we were far from it. The consolidation pattern is also lacking in "bounce" suggesting that buyers aren't able to sustain nothing, prob just shorts closing. Selling vol is still much stronger than buy pressure.

Therefore i added to my short from 9400 (current avg is just under 9k). Because this area is supposed to, or has the potential to be a bounce area, I'm keeping liquidation in a safe perch. However, this entire drop has reinforced in my head that profitable positions are rarely comfortable ones. NO RISK NO REWARD BABY. 
Moving the stops on my long up to around $8,300. 

I'm okay taking a small loss on this trade, but now I've got to consider Bitmex lag. A stop loss at $8,170 could very well execute FAR lower if $8,200 falls on spot. 

If you followed my entry, then it's been a rough 12 hours for you and I do sincerely apologize for that. 

But you're in the green now at least! Like I said earlier though, if you can't stomach a loss on this trade, now is the time to exit. 
Daily closed as a green doji!! Small win for the bulls.

Gonna hold my long from $8500 for 24 hours to see if we can make a run to engulf the giant red dildo from 2 days ago.
Got stopped out of my short overnight. I was a heavy casualty of market slippage, probably due to entry size, and my market stop hit on the big green candle. Had over $40 of slippage, which sucks a lot. My final close was about a >40% stack increase, but I was sitting at a >60% stack increase when I went to bed, so that stings a bit. 

Still, trying to shake the disappointment of what could have been and focus on the win. 

As for position, I'm sitting out for the moment. We blasted through the resistance line and while the past 24 hour looks like we should be in short the bounce territory, I'm not going to touch it. I also have an unbroken track record of a bad day immediately following my best days of trading, lol.

!short XBTUSD close 8430

edit to add: I couldn't get the bot fully updated. Final average value was 8840 100% @ 13x, closed 8430.
So I've been calling for a multi-week pullback to set a lower high on the weekly but this price action definitely has me spooked.  Looks like this was a technical bounce, possibly due to a lot of shorts closing simultaneously triggering a bull break.  TheChartGuys has a good video up this morning on the price action the last 48h.

Major props to anyone who made money on long plays in the last 72h.  I bought in on an hourly oversold bounce on ETH 2 days ago and quickly closed it for about 0.8% profit and haven't looked to reenter in either ETH or BTC.  I had considered entering in at 8200 this morning but I'm too spooked by this price action.  We went up irrationally, almost completely disregarding how overbought we were on all time frames and it looks like we're going down in much the same way.  The $1200 drop over the last 48h is the mirror to the BGD to me.  Massive price action in a short period inciting FOMO on the way up and FOBH (Fear of Bag Holding) on the way down.

My original target was 7500 at the 0.786 retrace from 11700 to 6400 to set the weekly higher low, but I was also expecting it to be a rather measured, hard fought, decline over the next two weeks.  Now?  Shoot, I have no idea what to think here.

Anyone looking to play ETH due to its natural bullishness of late, ETHBTC is making lower highs and lower lows on the 4h time frame, if the ratio gives out I expect ETH to fall apart with a viciousness.

Stay safe traders.
People adding to shorts here..... why? 

Add on bounces or dont at add at all imo.  

You’re adding risk in a completely unideal spot from a technical standpoint. 

This is like adding to a long at 9.8k..... 
Been holding since 9k, to the moo-- or not.

Either way I made a decision last night not to watch the charts anymore or at least compartmentalise when I do so. Trading for the last few months hasn't really yielded very much, certainly not enough to justify the time spent doing so.

I've now stops and orders in place instead and I'm going to kick back and earn more money doing what I do best, (wedding photography) because seriously, trading is all consuming and pulls other aspects of my life down at the same time.

I truly feel I've lost some hair over it due to being on high alert 24/7 and to be perfectly honest, would of probably made a lot more selling high and buying low without trying to time the top and bottoms, my diet would of been better and I would of hit the gym more.

Safe trading, see you at 10k, or maybe 9k on Sunday.

Or 6500 on Wednesday..... 
The last time I saw so much negativity in this thread... we bounced from $6k...

So let's hope it's a contrarian indicator again.
wtf is going on. I tethered at 8.3k because everyone here said to.
Still holding my long from $8,420. 

I probably have being asleep during the drop to $8,200 to thank for that moreso than my trading acumen.

Anyhow, if the market can make it back to breakeven, then it'll also push through the nearly vertical resistance line. So I'll be holding it in that case despite an uncontrollable urge to GTFO. 

If you followed my trade and don't have the stomach to hold it much longer, I don't blame you. If you have the opportunity to close it at breakeven (which I think you will), you should take it.

Edit: I'm also going back to bed in a minute. So apologies in advance if I don't respond to any questions. 
6h RSI at the second lowest point since at least October 2017
There was a long documentary tonight on the NHK about the recent Coincheck heist , around 500million usd worth (at the time) of NEM

The doc focused on the current efforts to trace the coins, and revealed (Ive not seen the info anywhere else) that there are a lot of clues and the investigation is going on. 

They have been able to follow the recycling of NEM on the dark web, to identify one BTC address of the hacker from which they found out other adresses each with around 20m usd worth of coins which were then directed to a major US  exchange whose name was kept hidden. 

To be continued ...

But the moral of the story could be.... cryptos (at least btc nem and many others...) are NOT anonymous!!!! 
wow a 713 BTC market sell
Anyone watching this interesting stalemate on GDAX right now?
If you look at the 1 day macd from the ATH @ 1100 in 2013/Nov/29th, the macd gets tighter and tighter until the next bull run starts. It takes quite a long time to do this from nov 2013\- aug 2015.

We are at a similar point now in the macd \(albeit accelerated timeline\) from the ATH @ 19870.  A big sell off that was quickly reversed started the previous bull run \(tentatively at first\).  I am expecting a repeat of that action between now \(if this drop is the start of it\) and the 29th May when the macd needs to breakout.

Graphing this isn't that easy on trading view \(most of it ends up off the visible screen\).  Also, comparing the past to look into the future is dubious, but patterns repeat.. a lot.
BTC oversold short term big time.
Another test if the res line breaks, if it does not break now, I assume the 8.2k wall of Finex will fall.

With the outermost wicks the res line is at 8305 now. 
They say trend is your friend. What I learnt other than that is BitFinex is your friend too. :)
Guys I finally tethered. Expect going to 10k within a hour.
I guess the chefs in goblintown decided to add some greens to the red dildo menu, you know, gotta have a balanced diet.
I'm personally going to wait this one out for the next day or two... I don't see any solid trade here.  [We're getting a potential turn around on shorter time frames but won't know unless $8650 is broken.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/mxUMrhnS/) Trend is still down, but RSI is so suppressed that if we do happen to move above, it's possible we'll retrace half the dump back to mid $8.8k.

The weekly chart looks bearish however, and the [divs on the 1d forecast a sustained move to $7400-$7200](https://www.tradingview.com/x/1qSq0Cs1/) levels this coming week before any real potential turn around. 

Will see you guys on Monday :)


I just noticed that we stopped (for now, at least) right at the 50% Fib retracement of the rise from 6.4 to 10. That 50% Fib also coincides with the 50-day MA (orange line):

https://www.tradingview.com/x/TePGupqB/

I started buying a bit, and will continue to do so over the next days, unless we break below 8.2 


Well that was a crazy night. woke a few times and thought I was dreaming when looking at the price, and now my 8550 long is back in profit again...
It seems likely we'll break below $8200 and head towards the bottom support line drawn from the $6k bottom.  What's important to note is that both the log line and the support line intersect here which is likely to offer some serious resistance and, if we get there, would be a good place to close a short.

[I see two different potential scenarios unfolding over the coming months.  The bear case here is a move below the support and log resistance leading to an eventual capitulation event and new lower low.  Alternatively if we bounce and stay above the resistance we may range within the larger pennant as a continuation pattern.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/2eHu6l23/)

Personally I'm done with longs and will be shorting tops from here until $7250. Buyers are totally anemic right now and there are way too many longs still on the books.  Inability to break above $8650 is incredibly bearish.  Safe trades everyone.
[Looks like the beginning of another bear flag](https://www.tradingview.com/x/IYtMW6lm/)... it'll be interesting to see how far this one goes.

I'm out of trade but will short if we fall of the line...
This is the trend line I’m watching for another leg down: https://www.tradingview.com/x/9BcdCR0Y/

A break to the upside would certainly be nice, but I think we’re not yet at maximum pain for long entries like me... :P

Edit: This really wants to break down
Binance is the leader of the price actipn for now. It seems to switch between Bitfinex and Binance. For some reason it looks like Binance is leading the dumps and BFX the pumps, has anyone had such an observation?
Well, my hedge long got stopped out on the first wick under 9300, and I added everything I got back to my short on the bounce. This last drop has allowed me to move stops just over that last add, over resistance, and decently over spot. I'm now 100% in at 13x. By far the biggest position I've had. I've got a 10% and 20% profit taking stops laddered below us between here and 8K, because RSI is just plain stupid. Also a decently deep trailing stop in case we drop to 78xx and bounce like mad, I'll catch that before we hit the hard stop I have above here. 

I'm going to bed. Good luck all.
I don't have the time, intellectual energy, or emotional fortitude (which is clearly a big part of successful trading) to be in anything but all cash right now. I have cashed out after a small gain on some BTC I DCA'd into from about 7800 up to 9200. 

I have left a buy order in place at 6400, all-in with my remaining cash position. If it gets down there, that's about as strong a support as there is left for BTC. If my buy triggers and it drops below? Well, so be it. 
Touched the top of the bear flag 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/rxiyR9eW/

Let’s see if BTC got the fire power to break out of it 

Edit: Bitcoin ripped some pre workout today 
Does anyone know how a long squeeze looks versus a short squeeze (quick and violent up candle, Apr 11 case in point)? Thanks


To zero we go!  
I still remember sitting in my living room chair and watching Bitcoin spike from $6,900 all the way past $8,000 in a span of an hour.

A wild guess but I feel like the reverse is going to happen this time.
If $8,200 breaks soon the price will capitulate back down to the $6000's since no support was built in the $7000's.
Despite what the charts on the shorter timeframes tell you, I actually got a buy signal on a strategy that has a pretty good win rate on the 3D chart. It doesn't print very many signals, so this is a big deal to me. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZCVMidPM/

With that said...

!long XBTUSD 8477 1x 40%
!long xbtusd close 8640 80%

Limit orders hit at break even for 80% of my really poor long from 8888. The fact that I had patience and plenty of margin available to average down the position all the way to 8400 paid off really well.

20% of the position from 8400 still open with stop order just under 8450 to cover fees.

I was very lucky this time and have definitely learned a few things!
What a tiring environment to trade right now. Price is struggling to breakout above the Sym. triangle due to this massive cloud on the 30 min chart, acting as massive resistance. Wedge formations on low volume is increasing the odds of a break down. But on the other hand  those buy walls at low 8000's on finex are like fortresses.
make up your mind BTC.

Daily is about to close on a green doji. Good sign for the bulls.
Seriously, we're talking about buying back in at 5k and 3k already? Dear lord, and some people here call the bulls delusional. 

edit: fyi, there has been exactly ZERO times since 2013 (can't be bothered looking further back and it's not like it matters anyway) where Bitcoin had painted a double bottom as cleanly as we have with the 6k & 6.5k dumps, and then broke down further below that level. That's right, zero. The only time something even remotely similar happened was in Autumn 2014, on a much shorter timeframe, under very different market conditions.

Now, we might still go lower than 8200 -- absolutely possible, but anyone who claims with such a perfect certainty that we're "definitely" going below $6k sometime this year because blah blah blah is full of shit. There is literally zero precedent in history of this asset, zero fundamental reasons (yes, nobody's using Bitcoin to do much else other than OH I DONT KNOW TRADE THE MASSIVELY EXPLODING ALTCOIN SPACE THAT HAS EVERY FUCKING ASSET MANAGER ON PLANET SWOONING OVER?), zero technical reasons, zero ANYTHING pointing that we're going to see prices lower than a new higher low around 7k at worst. 

If you want to speculate and play "what if's" about where we *could* go should the support at $8200 break, then whatever supports in $7ks break, then the big triangle on the weekly break down, then the linear / psychological supports in $6ks break, sure, go ahead and speculate about it. Just don't go around pretending you know it all and you've seen it all and anyone who isn't shorting right here and now is a stupid newbie or something. Zero times a situation you ridiculous bears imply is 'sure' to happen has actually happened in the past. Zero. 
Sorry guys, i messed up an update to the production site of the **Open Positions site** and the latest updates are pointing to the new site that is still with test data.

I just woke up so i'm still reassessing what to do, either update all to the new site and bot version or revert all.

For now i reverted so on the next changes the link should the the old one, but that doesn't fix ll the links created meanwhile...

When i have more than 50% of my brain working i'll post an update.
 
Ok so this is how ma50 is support.
!long xbtusd close 8460

Nice pop. I hate holding positions though

Edit: Fuck I didn't exit my long I just entered a short lmao.
It looks like the downward resistance line from 20k has turned into support.  Or, maybe it's just me.  But if true, some places would tell you to long when that happens:

http://swing-trading-strategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/resistance-turned-support-swing-trading-system-buy-setup.png
Now that underwater longs have a "second chance" to close at a smaller loss with this bounce, I wonder how many will choose to do so. I'm still holding my underwater long from over $9,000 and I'll average it down if we get below $7,800, but no sooner. 
8.3 buy wall on finex is gone - i assume we'll be checking out 8.2 again shortly
edit: back up and getting eaten
     Have had 3 successful shorts since 9300 which added 20% BTC to my stack. Currently out of position. Logic tells me to open a short now but my plan is to short if 8200-8300 falls. I think if 8200 falls we will crash hard (maybe 7.5K) so opening at 8300 isn’t that much better of a position. 

 It looks like there might be some support at this level. This could be a fake out to retest 8650 level.  You could make a slight case right now for opening a long (oversold on the 1D, consensus just started..) but I think fiat is a good position to be in. I’ll grab a position once the 8200-8400 war ends
I’m so used to longing at this point that I just tried to add to my short position twice only to realize I was continuously reducing my short position by adding 2 longs. 

Amateur hour 
Noob question. I am short 1x right now on bitmex. How to I can i increase my short leverage from 1x to 3x? When select 3x directly i have my less XBT available (0.14xbt) that i had previously (0.21xbt).I cant really get my thing around it. Really watched lots of tutorials but still cant gey it. Thanks! 
Theories about all these little dumps? Underwater longs closing at break even? Normal profit taking?
In the spirit of the day, some gallows humour.  

Just as a hypothetical. Black Swan. 

So God forbid some calamity occurs, the protocol gets broken/cracked, or some unforeseen set of circumstances sends the price plummeting down endlessly.  

It just keeps dropping, everyone piles on the train and just keeps shorting it. 

The price ends up at some low, niche, “collector’s item” price point somewhere north of zero. 


That’s when I’d have to seriously LOL at the thought of someone with 200 BTC in a 20m short position on an *inverse* contract, having to watch their PnL exponentially start rising to 20,000,000 **→  ₿ ←** 


They’d do a quick emotional lap around the track of *“hell yeeea”* to *“urm.. wait a se…”* before arriving at *“Ohhhhh fuccck”*  

Cue (more) pandemonium as the one or two sharp minds residing in the BitMEX troll-box decide to /r/dothemath and realize to their horror that just the top 3 short positions *on BitMEX alone* now own triple the number of Bitcoins than have ever been created. 

Countless people would go from having thousands/millions of real dollars worth of imaginary but valuable, internet money 
...to having ∞/fantasy amounts of imaginary dollars in worthless internet money. 
Great news, now we get to turn that potential double bottom into a potential triple bottom. Good news for bulls.
never change Bitcoin, you alriiiggghhhttt
Here are the facts. We have 2 official trendlines that converge. This is also known as a symmetrical triangle. My plan is quite simple:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/pJk5D6Ny/
Going long. This is going to 9K the meme power won't allow it any lower.
Shake out before the break out.
If you sold then someone bought. Psst they are stealing your BTC 
Look on the bright side,

at least we’re all going to goblin town together

After all the hype, I can’t wait to catch a dinner and a movie while I cry myself to sleep every night
$300 left and we are at the peak of the shortsqeeze from April 12. Are we still in a healthy correction? Think again.
I feel like some of you are giving way to much credence to the long vs short ratio count. It's a single data point, not the complete picture.
I heard a rumour Gates went long **/s**
Though I like the BGD as it’s good for hopium, I’m really cautious with the one and not opening a long here. Feels a lot like the return of the barting, but I guess we’ll have to see how it unfolds. 

Im not making a move until we see a higher low and disprove a Bart to reset the indicators. 
**Brainstorming time**

Since i already messed up trading today i'll be sitting on my hands today at least (will be away from the charts also) i am considering some features for the bot site.


Would it be good to have Notifications services to warn when user X changes position? Or would it make people stop coming here so often and be a bad thing for this sub? 

Some possibilities could be:

* RSS feeds

* Push Notifications on the browser

* E-mail notifications

* SMS Notifications (this one is a bit of a stretch because it has costs)


I would like some feedback from you guys. 
Pulled out into fiat last Saturday. (Got downvoted for my update then. But alas...) I'm watching 8300. If this collapses I will continue on the sidelines. If 8300 turns support I will enter a long there.
Everyone here turned bearish. I'm not convinced. Respectable support near term off the last peak at 8,640. May short, but I'll wait for a higher entry (8,500 +). 
The volume on this pumps is making me want to add to my short from 8380. But this triangle could break either way. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/poeve3Zk/
Pretty remarkable drop we're enduring here. The 4hr RSI is now just under 19. The 4hr RSI low on the Feb 6 drop to $6k was 20. 

Do with that what you will..
!short XBTUSD close 8250

decided to close semi-autonomous (alarms controlled ) trade. probably will re-short higher. 12h RSI are going under 30, lower timeframes are already there
This is a follow up to my previous [analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ikz1u/daily_discussion_friday_may_11_2018/dytmrf5), this is now a drop of 10.6&#37; which is possibly enough considering the pattern of increasingly smaller drops. There was a bounce at 8.2k and I entered my long as planned with a stop right below 8200. The bounce isn't looking strong right now, I'll consider adding to my long if there's another test of 8200.
[pop!](https://prnt.sc/jgwlt5)
8661 first resistance to beat (38% retrace to the 9393 highs and 1h bollinger) . 8941 major resistance (62% retrace)
Start regreting closing my short from 8480... But the plan was to enter with tight stops. They hit so i bailed. 
Started dumping from 8.5 as I was trying to set up a short. I hate myself. 
[removed]
Why my stupid ass didn’t tethered at 8800
Consensus probably won't help this time .  Sad :-( 
Still short from 9220, Kraken messed up orders and didn't add on 8640, too bad. I have never been in double digits profits so far. Feels good
Ok, guys.

Some of you may know that I am a big proponent of decentralization and utility of Cryptocurrency.

And once again, Bitcoin and all Crypto has proven to be completely unusable with (yet again) another 10% daily swing. Noone uses it for anything other than gambling, i.e. selling at 4h RSI below 20.

I closed my long (again) because I could not give 2 shits anymore about all this.

Very sad stuff. We blasted through 8500 with a vengence and it came back to bite us in the ass
I gave up and sold, the market will go up now, dont worry /s
Hm, I really thought it would cool off on a Friday night.  Yet here we are, breaking lower again. :/

200 d MA resistance 50 d MA support which was resistance before. 
We're in resistance zone 1 now. 8650-8700 will be hard. And then there is 8800 right above. For the shorters, this is your entry.

I myself am staying out for the rest of the day... Probably.
Updated my position back to 80% fiat a little while ago (sub 8400). Was probably a bit early, but zooming out a bit, the 4 hr chart is making a gigantic flag. Going to wait for it to break up before buying back, partly because I'm out of town and can't be staring at charts constantly babysitting a more risky position.
who the fuck is still selling?
Hammer on the 1h after missing 8.2k by just $4, bullish divergences on several indicators and time frames \- and, above all, sentiment in this sub at freezing point. Bottom seems to be in :\-\)

Longs 32k shorts 18.5k... this is seriously crazy...im reopening my short
is this green candle the confirmation that we ended the drama and go back up? 
The drops are probably caused by Bill Gates, who may have finally figured out that shorting Bitcoin was in fact easy to do. 
the volume profile of the last 30d is so bearish, the buy pressure is literally just sellers waiting to unload. Same exact thing happened last time. I don't know how anyone can see the volume profile of every movement and not think this is a bear market.

The bullflag broke down. See you at 7800.
!long xbtusd 8266 1x 25% 

I realize I'm flip flopping here but the resistance line is about to break. Given the RSI still being oversold as hell and the fact that we hadn't had a real bounce yet a small long seems to be the right way to go now. The resistance line is almost vertical. This can't go on forever.

Also fifth touch now on the resistance line. The sixth here will break it.

Stop is @8150. Can't see this moving below there and not dropping further
What's this? The GDAX premium returns?
Anyone have thoughts on the next break up or down? Seems to be hovering around 8365. Waiting for signs of movement up or down to sell. Help?


*****All I had to do was put this question into the universe and it went up. 1 min later it’s 8400. Thank you crypto gods
As a sign of the sentiment: in 5 hours the mex funding rate finally went negative so shorts pay longs. First time this has happened since April 24th.  It looks like the expected funding rate in the following period goes back to being slightly positive.

It's interesting because bfx shows shorts are still decreasing.

Where is your optimism? No goblin town, this will sort itself out next week. I can't believe how all of you guys here suddenly turned bearish after two days of red that had good reasons (upbit, gox, a failed test of 10k). You guys are professional traders, but sometimes you got so lost in your charts that you lose the bigger picture. Crypto has never been stronger. Bitcoin is creeping itself in our mainstream media, tv shows etc. Billion dollar entities are entering the market. This will come to pass. Come troll me if we're not pass this brief bearishness next week. I will be humbled.
The it's 2014 again guys are letting me down, haven't seen it in awhile and this is your time to shine. 
I was just reading an interview with Jim Rogers, who had predicted many world economy crashes and he’s very convinced that we are about to experience the next one: 

http://www.etf.com/sections/features-and-news/jim-rogers-extreme-bear-market-coming?nopaging=1

That wound be very interesting if the crypto market won’t be affected, just because it’s often irrational.. yet it’s hard to believe it.

What would you guys do to protect yourself if you knew that’s it’s coming? Would you short literally everything? Would you buy undervalued currencies? Or is it too much of a risk and it’s better to stay in usd?

Sorry for off topic, but I wanted to discuss it with you guys. Not participating in any discussion on other subreddits.

Take it with a pile of solt, anyways. Many smart people make wrong predictions from time to time and this might be one of them.
i think 7800 most likely won't hold. There was just way too much support at $8300 for this to bounce after a 5% drop

if it drops below $8000...I think we'll see 7450 or so before the boucne 
When an asset acts like this just stay the fuck out guys... why take the risk. This could easy tank another 700. Every trader is praying for a bounce to short
For those keeping track, the Wyckoff distribution chart [http://d.stockcharts.com/school/data/media/chart\_school/market\_analysis/wyckoff3/wyckoffdistribution1.png](http://d.stockcharts.com/school/data/media/chart_school/market_analysis/wyckoff3/wyckoffdistribution1.png) appears to still apply here. From the looks of it, we are now in Phase D and heading up to re\-test support\-turned\-resistance at $8800\-$8900. If we fail there, I'm pretty confident that's what is going on. However, the market is very confusing right now, so I'm setting a tight SL on my short if we get there.
Stated a few hours ago that I was waiting for some sort of move. Thought it was to early to be short or long from the 8200-8400 battle. I believe a few people here poked fun cause “some average guy”

Long at 8410. Stop loss at 8250. Rationale is we’re still way to oversold on the 1D and there is big events this week. This also looks like a double bottom at 8200. Keeping the stop loss tight since I’m still not to certain of this position. 

Edit: closed at 8485 for a slight profit. Ive been on a win streak as of late & want to keep it that way. Got ahead of myself there for a minute. Too early to know where this is going
Bart fractals... how kewl
People seriously think that all of the positive events and whatknot are going to cause a trend reversal in a bear market....?

Nothing is going to beat human psychology.. whether that's in a bull or bear market.

If you have FOMO in a bull market, you're going to get a Fear of Being Left Behind in a bear market.
Anyone have any idea where I should put my stops? 

I want to put them sub $8,200 which is where I have them now, but my hearts telling me just below $8,300
Pullback not unexpected on my end. I had actually hoped for a pullback this big so my buy orders could get filled from 8.5K to 8K. Let’s see where we’ll go next. 
We just tested 2200btc @8201 buy order on Bitfinex and it seems like is there to stay... Maybe thats good enough for a bounce? We'll see
That went beyond fear into stupidity. It's been 72 years since *It's a Wonderful Life* and we haven't learned a damn thing.
I see some hammers here, this can be it!
[deleted]
stopped out on my short because bmex futures ballooned to $160 premium for a second. stupid but should've guessed. my fault for not setting up take profit in the 8.2 range.
Does anyone have any historical stability/volatility stats or know a good resource for it?
https://www.tradingview.com/x/Yz73Z0aK/

The downtrend line has changed from res to sup. Applying Elliott Wave(it seems to work well for "real" bounce), we can see the target price is $8677.3 (But conservatively $8650, since that's the res turned sup)

EDIT: (5th wave - 1.272 extension of 3rd wave)
Closing my last trade because I don't know where the fuck bitcoin is going and want to enjoy my weekend  
Good luck yall   
!xbtusd close 8520
would not be surpised if we form a larger scale pennant here. glad I sold 66&#37; above 8.55k, rebought a bit here
Obviously no one will know, but how do you think holder from the current price will fare in mid to long term? I got into mining, traded a bit, lost money a bit, but have recovered about 110% of my mined coins. Would the prospect be bad as in we will go to 4.5k and stay there in the long term (1-2 years)?
I can't get bullish when I still see everyone on twitter "expecting" Bitcoin to skyrocket in 2018. Until I see everyone bearish and some chart capitulation aka "bitcoin is dead", I cannot get bullish. People still think this is easy money to just buy and HODL simply because it happened in the past. Recipe for disappointment in any market...
What's the confidence level that in fact 8,000 BTC sold from the Mt gox trustee?  Are they on a schedule now, selling 8K every month or two?  If so that sucks, but at least eventually they will run out of coins to sell.
There is nothing wrong in being downvoted, as long as your are on the right side of the trade! lol
https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ito6f/daily_discussion_saturday_may_12_2018/dyupoqe/
Reckless but I think it might turn out okay: Long @8252. The 4h RSI hasn't been this low since August 2016. Selling is unbelieveable. 8200-8150, served as horizontal support often enough for me to enter a smaller long. 
I see some buying!
Flashbacks to January. This asshole trustee
Insert rollercoaster ride with a bored face gif here.
This bounce is really shitty. No volume at all. I know that this has been the case lately but on a serious bounce I would at least expect a green 1k  BTC 15 min candle. That's nowhere to be seen.

Closed my long for 75$ profit per BTC. Probably will regret this because RSI will reset sooner rather than later but I'm done babysitting the charts for now.

Will enter again if we get close to 8200 for a scalp. But am not confident in holding anything for long if the market keeps being this lethargic. 

!long xbtusd close 8327 

so if we are at 9k\+ in couple of days\(thereotically speaking\) how would you explain this dump?
So I have a long open from around 8.4k which I stupidly did not close when it went slightly over 8.6k. Now this thing dropped almost as suddenly as it went up. Shall I hold on to the long in the hope it’ll bounce again soon from 8.2/8.3 area or take the loss now assuming it’s going further down?

What do you all suggest? 
Hey guys. I need some advice. I opend a long at 9300 and didnt close it. Liquidation is around 7800. Should i sell parts of the position while we are getting some gains? or is this stupid and i should stay unterwater and hope until im break-even or broke?
Just bought in back.

Bought in earlier today and held through the BGD, sold everything shortly after it happened.

Reason why I bought now is just because everyone is bearish, testing out a theory that everyone can’t be right.

 Stop loss at 8280.

Edit: also looks like a double bottom to me, but it’s probably way too early to call it that (I’m a noob at TA, I might be wrong)

Edit: bought at 8350
As mentioned by _SomeAverageGuy, thanksfor250kusd and yves73 about an hour ago, the current chart looks like a double bottom. Anyone want to comment? 
A few people here have already posted about the bull div forming on the 1h chart. Further the decent is starting to look a bit like a falling wedge: https://www.tradingview.com/x/ioD6hOmh/

That’s some hopium for ya’ all!
$8600 looks to have changed from support to resistance 
I just don't get it. blockchain week with consensus coming up and the prices are tanking. Someone please comfort me with some positivity or I'm gonna lose it. 
Jesus. Read it as 9.3k instead of 8.3k, freaked out for a second.
I think this bart is part of a large bear flag.  I'm expecting 2 more of these before we continue the drop.
Just looking at the [1D MACD](https://www.tradingview.com/x/bZsILRuj/) this looks like it has room to drop. I'm targeting 7800 which is around the S1 pivot point and will bail over 8600 if a BGD were to suddenly appear.

!short xbtusd 8388 10X 40%
For all of you being permabears, looking at the channels and drawing your arbitrary lines — perhaps consider the current mood in crypto before you start calling for another descent down to 6k. Not only did we visit that area twice during this bearish cycle, but to say we are going there again now is absurd.

Not only is volume not at those abysmal levels like then, but consider all the good news as of late. And by “good news,” I mean from institutions themselves. Goldman Sachs is dedicating a separate trading floor for Bitcoin (first of its kind), the NYSE has expressed interest in adding Bitcoin, as has NASDAQ whose CEO is bullish on Bitcoin. SK has been set to establish crypto-regulations. I won’t go into all these details, but you get the idea. This kind of implementation and adoption for crypto is not happening in “4-5 years,” but is happening now. 

If you’re trying to explain the current drop using TA — then please, considering that the current drop in price was not even *expected* using that same metric, how can you now want to use that same tool, which was unable to predict this drop, to assess that it will drop MORE? 

It’s time to reassess what some of you on this forum are looking at, and consider the news and context. We are escaping a bearish period and the recent Upbit raid story, coupled with the Mt. Gox BTC suspiciously moving yet again, was a good excuse for the permabears come out. Mass hysteria sets in (since we have been in a bear market for four months now) and here we are: a disproportionate drop, yet again. To argue based on your so-called indicators of a “bear flag” here, or calling a bottom at sub 7k, is completely absurd given the aforementioned facts. Seems like everyone is a permabear when it’s easy to be so, but don’t you understand this is a self-fulfilling prophecy? Please stop. 

And I don’t want to hear your excuses about “I am a bear in the short-term but a bull in the long-term.” This is just an attempt to save your own skin because, like I said, the further adoption of crypto is fast among us. If you’re not bullish for crypto’s short-term future now — based on actual news that’s been coming out which is crucial to this space’s expansion rather than your TA crystal ball — then how can you even claim to be bullish “in the long term?” 
Was there any news for that bounce or just some short covering and/or dip buyers?
See how the BGD towers over the LRD (on any time frame, but especially apparent on the 15-min candles), even with the same or smaller volume? That's why I don't short. The market wants to go up.  There is no bearish case to be made right now, just some doofus wasting money selling Bitcoin at market prices for the temporary pleasure of driving the price down.  

We will test $10K next week.
I wanna see rsi just go out the shitter. negative rsi pls 
A little hopium:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/rzaZnMpl/

Volume is decreasing with each dump. Maybe the last dump was a test that there are not that many bearish shrimps who would sell as soon as whales pump it?
Doesn't look good... Might go down further?
i wan to say 8200 is holding well but, you know...

on a side note, I still think this will pump during/after consensus. Also, in recent previous bitcoin runs, i noticed that EOS pumps preceded. Not that it's any kind of indication, but i observed EOS volume increasing steadily with large buy orders setting up. Anyone else noticed this too?

Edit: right on que EOS, you are a shitcoin, but a good indication
Okay, hopefully the uptrend will last a few days. That would be perfecto.
BitMEX is fucking impossible to trade on... been trying to short from 8.6k... 
Damn, slept right through my chance to close my long from 8.4
This price is pure manipulation. The amount of attention, news, adoption and possible adoption over the past week is higher than I've seen it in a long long time. I bet it breaks $10k within the week. (Barring any FUD of course) Don't just down vote me, reply if you don't like my post. Don't be scared.
You’re being shaken out and the 2014 chart is a meme. 
Long at $8330. With so many crypto announcements coming up, I can't see us dropping much lower.
I don't know how anyone can be bullish right now with the way the long/short ratio sits. I'm bullish over a long term but we have to flush out the degen gamblers first. I will never understand why people feel the need to take out high leverage on one of the most volatile assets in history.
Moved 20% of the fiat I had (80% of my holdings) into eth. The other 20% is also in eth so I'll be adding that in as well. Overall, 64% fiat and 36% eth 

!short XBTUSD profit 8250 16%

!long ethusd 655 1X 36%

Feel free to down vote, this is mostly just a position update. Gotta think we'll bounce soon though.

Edit: check reasoning in my post history, my market opinion hasn't really changed since I last made a semi high effort post. Looking at 8.2k and 7.8k support. Will move to 50-50 fiat/crypto somewhere 8.1-8.2k if it gets down there, and set stop losses below 7.8k.

Update: that was fast. Taking off another 10% of my original 80% fiat.
Do you think these are similar?

For everyone getting their panties in a bunch over this double bottom... 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZIG7u4jM/

$8,650 would have to break with conviction to confirm. Then we will be met with $8,750-$8,800 resistance and would probably be rejected because bulls have been beyond weak.

Calling a double bottom right now is like calling a head and shoulders before the right shoulder is even complete.

So for the time being, *Hold onto your dicks* 

Edit: Bulls failed again, my confidence is slowly draining 
Currently out and about so just a short update today. Will post a full update with charts later this evening.

Still holding my short from 9.8k and looks like I will be for the foreseeable future.

As expected, we reversed at 10k, continuing the long term bear trend.

It's very likely we will follow this current downward trend for at least the next week or so, expecting a $6-7k bottom around May 20-24th.

We should then expect another peak to follow with lower highs and lower lows.

Bear trend is still very much intact and we're unlikely to see any change in that regard until late 2018/early 2019.
RIP to all of those fomoing back in and crying "recovery" at a bounce after a significant drop, movement is never vertical.
great short entry, typical dead cat bounce
It's the 7ks for sure now. No real buying strength left as it stands... As shit as it is we might be looking at a return to the low 7s again in the coming week.

If that happens well, who's to say where we'll end up. 10k could become the distant dream again 
Game of the day: guess the bottom?
Damn.
So...Do I short or Long?
[deleted]
Tried going long with 50% stack and 5x but kraken still has no usd to lend... Ended up only getting a 20% entry... 
Next question is this a really just a technical bounce and we go more down after RSI recovered or was it way to oversold and we stay in this area or bounce back up. Ideas?
So is anyone looking at a new downtrend log line connecting ath to recent 9.9 yet?  Yeah it's still a bit out of scope, but I like having all these possibilities mapped out.
Crap, i missed that bounce. Do you guys still think it is a good idea to short even from this level? 
I don't have EUR on bitfinex available but there is a decent arbitrage between there and GDAX for any Europeans not watching Eurovision.
Anyone else having trouble with gdax? The numbers aren’t moving at all.
Whats the exchanges breakdown of futures trading these days? Is it like 50% of the volume on Bitfinex and 25% of the volume on Bitmex, or am I way off?
Looking for a good reentry point for medium term holding. Any recommendations?
Looking at the linear 7-day graph, I'm seeing a pretty round bottom. That usually gets Bitcoin sprung. Holding my 9.65 long from Friday afternoon and fully expecting a healthy profit. Funny how sometimes the trades that don't go your way right away turn out to be the most profitable. Patience is super key in this market.
Not surprised, been saying we'd drop hard for weeks.

Not to dick swing, but interest in crypto has been dying month on month, you need hype to get people interested again \(or real institutional money, which is  not here yet, and may never be\), or we stagnate \- which is what has been happening.

I think we're ultimately going back all the way to before the madness began last year, so around $4\-$5k, unless some major institutional buying interest.

For the short term traders..

We oughta soon rebound towards 8700-8800. Shorter timeframes we are extremely oversold. With bullish divergence on the RSI. https://www.tradingview.com/x/CB9etToZ/
https://www.tradingview.com/x/TLJ6WDMm/



This downtrend line is going to be breached at any time. (By that I mean we will break up and above it). It is too steep. That line will be at 0 in a little over a week, and that is not happening. I think we will breach in within the next day, perhaps even the next *hour*. I don't know exactly when, but that line will be breached very soon.
How the hell are longs going up?? This makes no sense really, looks like underwater guys are all desperate for a reversal pump.
A decent bounce to 8.4k would bring us out of the channel. 
Another bounce to 8.4-8.6k would be cool so I can add more to my short 

But, the bulls are weak sauce AF and I dont expect 8200 to hold 
When bounce
345 coin buywall on gdax

Party starting?
WHAT the fuck o.O
[deleted]
~8300 looks like it could be a local bottom to me based on the weak selling volume. Also, there's a bull div on the 1hr and 2hr RSI. I have bottom targets in the 7950-8100 range though, so i consider it a risky long. Needs to bounce fast or i'm out.

https://imgur.com/a/tInx9yV

ETA: got stopped out fast on that one lol. saving my ammo for 8100 or a clean set up
12hr rsi touched oversold and saw a bullish divergence on the smaller timeframes. Entered a hedge long at 8240. 

Buckle up. 
my scaled long is a few dollars away from being in the green, happy day - worth staying up all night again -_- sell orders already scaled in, ready to wake up to some profits 
Buy wall flipping to sell wall on Bitfinex. That's a new one.
Maybe a stupid question, but can Bitmex lead the price? It has an astronomical volume, but people buy/sell according to BFX and GDAX price, not Bitmex.
All this buying pressure seems to good to be true. Staying out of position till 8200-8650 settles itself. 

If 8200 breaks, I’m curious where to re enter? 8000, 7800, 7500 .. thoughts?
Dead cat bounce smh... You are all about to get rekt
Huge green dildo**
Hammer on 1h, hopefully we start moving up from here. Still gonna stay out of position.

Short 8505, because short the bounce is the name of the game right now.
When do we hit $100k per coin?
 
Most our lives will be over and useless if crypto doesn't make us rich/wealthy. Do not deny it. Majority of us commenting here have nothing else to do, all is betted on crypto. I mean, I have a degree, but I hate working, so if this plan fails, I will most likely and up with a job I hate with people I have to pretend to like - and eventually I'll be depressed and committ suicide.

I love going to bed late, reading books, watching movies, writing a bit, shooting bitches, going out, and watching plebs from my balcony - no responsibilities, no commitments, no relationships, just me and the things I love. While living off of crypto. It can be lonely sometimes but thats mostly because the plebetarian is actually occupied and looking busy while I am doing "nothing" - a luxurious, one-percenter problem.

Whomever the fuck feels threatened by crypto and wants to destroy it... please don't u fucking basterd. Its mine... mine precious... 

With that said, this bear market has lasted long enough! Its almost been 5 full months! Whenever I'm losing patience, bull-market is max half of the time that's apssed away. So I expect resumption of the bull within 2.5 months.
Look guys, nobody loves Bitcoin Conventional more than I do (seriously) but the bulls seem to really lack conviction at the moment. I strongly suspect another big bull run is in the cards at some point within the next year or two but it's hard for me to think that $6K is the bottom here. Sure, it ~~does~~ did look like an nice A&E double bottom (except that it's nowhere near completes) but there are numerous fakeouts in a market that tends to inflict maximum pain in both directions. Just like in 2014, when the break of the downtrend line only resulted in a sizable bull trap, it seems to me that traders are simply taking advantage of the momentum but ultimately bulls/hodlers are not able to support the price at these levels (and I don't see any reason why that will suddenly change).

Still, that doesn't change my long term outlook on Bitcoin Conventional in the slightest. It still think it's the only cryptocurrency with a shot at solving this *hard, digital money* use case and nothing fundamental makes me doubt that we're still trending towards this paradigm. But markets boom and bust and Bitcoin Conventional does it as hard as anything else. [But volatility is still trending down](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/volatility-index/) (with a slight uptick in the past 6 months) and eventually Bitcoin Conventional will reach some sort of equilibrium, where liquidity is far better than it is today. 

My guesstimate is that $2K- 3K is the ultimate bottom in this cycle. I think we will break through $6K and experience another DCB off of $5K-or-so before capitulation or slow bleed down to this range. This would mimic other bear markets. Meanwhile, the LN will propagate (already almost at 2000 nodes) and the halvening date will continue to count down. LN, in particular, is the next evolution of Bitcoin and will hopefully **go a long way** to scale Bitcoin to a global population. I see nothing but positive developments in this regard and makes me confident that FUDsters and alt shills are desperate to shift the narrative towards anything else. I think it's still very much the early days for this thing that we call Bitcoin Conventional.

edit: [This](https://imgur.com/a/Dx8toWt) was the LN a few months ago. [This](https://imgur.com/a/w4pHFa2) is it today. Looks much closer to a mesh network than hub and spoke and the growth is substantial. I find the arguments from detractors less and less compelling. Very much looking forward to general release of wallet clients.

edit 2: Bears hate me, bulls hate me. Where's the love, people?
Some hopium for a bounce, I noticed on Binance a lot of the -20% figures have disappeared and now look a lot less scary to the casual investor / speculator.

As in those numbers flip flopped in the last hour, pretty much all at once, in part assisted by a $100 claw up from btc but I would suggest that, in combination with other factors (oversold RSI / slowing severity of the dips in btc) that this could be a positive thing from an emotive position, seeing green again.
Was looking at the Consensus 2018 [agenda](https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2018/agenda/) and it seems mostly like a altcoin wankfest. Was kinda nervous being short with that going on but it seems like theres only a few talks that might be relevant to Bitcoin.   
Also lol at all the bulltards coming jumping out proclaiming 10k is right around the corner after a small green dildo, if you can't post your position when its going the opposite way your reasoning is super weak
[removed]
I missed you BGD! "wiping tears"
Noobish margin trading question - can I long BTC on Bitfinex using BTC rather than fiat (USD)? I'm guessing not? And if not, is there any other exchange apart from Bitmex where I can do this? Thanks. P.s. not looking to long at this point, but want to be ready for a long-term long when that perfect opportunity arrives :)
On the bright side:


This downtrend is not within one huge 4h candle like the start of the uptrend was.
"Store of value?  muhahaha, is that what they call it ?  ,  We'll see about that.  "  - Wall Street

"Mt Gox still holds a large amount of Bitcoin — according to publicly available blockchain data, Mt Gox wallets still hold a balance of 137, 891 BTC. The total value of these holdings now exceed the amount owed to Mt Gox credits — Kobayashi is thus tasked with liquidating the assets on behalf of creditors."


BTC still extremely overvalued. Must retest $6k.
Have we just witnessed a (very modest) V-reversal? I'm seeing a clear V-shape there. (Edit: Sorry for "dumping" hopium.)
[removed]
Bitcoin devs must be really popping the champain now. High fees AND lower prices! Just what blockstream wants. Glad I got out of this sinking ship months ago. 
Alright you guys, what is the best possible solution for this Mt.gox shit show in the long term for Bitcoin. Then dragging this out doesn't seem to be helping out anyone. People are selling what they got regardless of how little btc they move.
Appreciate the transparency and skin in the game, good luck with your future trades!
I thought when we pushed up to 8650 that we would at least hold 8500 without getting lower than 8475

It’s starting to look like no one knows what Bitcoin is worth again.

Very disappointing when you consider all the loudmouths at 10k and even more disappointing when you consider that the bulls far outnumber the bears this week
◉︵◉
> Buyers need to sit in the corner for a bit and think about what they've done.

I hope it doesn't take long before they understand the consequences of their actions.
Well, I just closed my short

It is pretty funny. Go up 33% in over a month(mostly thanks to bears way overextending and causing a chain liquidation) with nothing but good news for crypto, while rebounding multiple times when overbought/oversold - bears say 'the move is too quick and needs a correction'. Move straight down 20% in 6 days while being oversold on every timeframe from 5min-12 hours and with 70% sell volume vs buy volume and no bad news - 'normal correction going back down to all time low and then crashing even lower for sure.' The bears here saying we are about to crash down to new all time lows are just as crazy as the bulls saying we are going to 20k this week.
Still far too many longs open right now that are underwater, they are going to pop eventually, the question is whether we can hold somewhere above 7k or if 6k is going to be tested again. 
no shorts to squeeze yet... 
I think Thomas Lee is manipulator. Last time he tweeted moon soon, price also dropped hard lolol. Everyone expecting conference to have positive impact, but this time it wil make btc price crash to sub $6k. 
Yeah feels like a real correction a bit like the break down from 13k
what kind of fees do you pay to hold a long for a few days or a few weeks?
Was that a 1% trailing stop you added  just a few hours ago? 
Good stuff, I didn't cut off the wick at your trendline from the bottom, leaving it at ~8125 which also doubled with the 0.5 for me. I'd but nice to move up towards 9990, but as some others have noted, the past fast days have been very weak. I'm leaning towards your bearish Elliot forecasting and am looking at low 8k's of 7,8k for real reversal for now, but will probably flop more bullish if we get past 8.7.
Did you notice the red TD9* On the 4 hour a couple candles before it broke up?  I'm starting to really think that 4 hr TD seems to perform reliably enough for short-mid term signals.

Probably not a good idea trying to time the bottom on this one. This needs to show a strong retrace before I'd touch it. 
you need to up the leverage, just like drugs
Bitcoin zen.
Going back to stocks is even weirder.
I'm the same. A few months ago, I was freaking out about every drop. Now it's just a passing *whoa* and then I go to my chart to find a good opportunity to make a trade.
I agree. People should use the PM option. We can check the website if we want to know people’s current position and position history
Very true. Anyone who visits this thread will only think about short term gains via bitcoin trading. This thread doesn’t have any first time impression on power of bitcoin and how it can change the future of financial transactions. This is sad as all the new visitors will only see think it as a gambling/betting game. How about the bitcoin long term vision?
Bro, do you even crypto?
market makers are squeezing the life out of crypto.   It was all fun and games until wall street arrived.
That's a chart that could be straight out of a modern art museum. nice! No idea about the lines though.
/u/justanotherlogin would you mind fixing my position in the database? My short from 9140 originally should have a final cost average of 8840, not 9098. It thinks I'm a better trader than I am.

Or maybe I'm just terrible at the bot syntax. 
No need to apologize. Trading is not always daisies and butterflies.
You are almost too good at this.  I'm exiting now in profit, but I wouldn't be surprised if you are right on with your targets for this scalp.

I was long with you at 8420\-ish, but panic sold at around 8230. I thought it was going to test or fall through 8000.  But when 8200 held, I re\-longed at about 8210. Glad I re\-longed there, would have been kicking myself right now if I hadn't.  Truth is, I never would have re\-longed there if I didn't know you were still long. 

Thanks for your help again.  You are the man.  
Thanks for this. Do u think this has a decent chance of going further high given ur original targets of 8.6 and 8.8?
I followed and finally on the green. Thank you! You mentioned your target profit is still at 8700\-8800 levels?
Same
SAme
Shake it off. 

The lesson here is to try to make really good trades, not perfect trades. 

The perfect trade in the last 48 hours was to short $9,400 and close at $8,210. But it would be hard to be upset opening a short at $9,000 and closing it at $8,400. 

Half the gains in the latter scenario, sure. But not nearly as difficult to accomplish.

Exact same story as you, futures premium spiked to $150 and stopped me out - we're currrently below my stops. And the fact that we hit 8.2 range and I was asleep... should've set some sells there in anticipation of a bounce. 
That doesn't sound that bad you still got a win. I actually followed your analysis and the discussion with Chewy and set a profit limit for my short at 8240 that thankfully got hit. But I didn't have a hedge long like you, I just set a limit buy in June futures for about the same as the short target. Again, i appreciate the discussion from you guys because it helped me figure out my own position.

In the end it comes down to if you rather be good or lucky? I got lucky you guys are good. Luck runs out.

!short xbtusd close 8240
People are adding to shorts, because the market is weak and not bouncing and there can be profits to be had when it drops further.
some guy said earlier no risk / no reward, no pain/no gain
I was working on my own projects/startups before I entered crypto last autumn, had sold a small company, had failed a few times, had ups and downs.

Stopped working on anything else since then. These charts keep my mind so mesmerized that I can’t even do anything besides thinking of crypto. The community, the spirit, the possibilities of blockchain, I’m loving it.

Preparing to do something in this space since that’s what make me happy. We came here for the money, but stayed for the revolution (is that how you say it?).
I just want to say that the time you spend trading is absolutely worth it. The time you spend obsessing about trading maybe less so, but the time you spend researching indicators, developing strategies and planning your entries and exits is deff worth it

You are learning valuable life lessons in discipline, rigor and resolve.

You are also learning to trade, which opens up a ton of opportunities for you in life.

1. You can manage your own retirement account (many of the things you learn apply to normal investments)

2. You have a hobby that generates some revenue

3. You learn to deal with stress, how to manage risk and operate under pressure

It may not be worth the time in terms of your gains, but it is worth the time in terms of the lessons you learn
4.7 Wednesday. Don't catch falling/rising knjfe
[deleted]
Ah, the ol' verbal RSI
We also were at more of a bottom, shorts outnumbered longs, we were failing to push lower after a series of attempts, and shorts were still opening. 

We're not there yet.  I'm not scaling into a long here like I did there. 
did you not learn yet? Do the OPPOSITE of what everyone here does
Who said to? You need to watch for the more patient traders if you're going to trade. 90% of people here are just giving their money away to 10% of people 
This market is engineered to make you fomo (either way) that's what's going on. Also this sub is an emotional echo-chamber.
Nobody here is actually giving real advice, everybody is trying to take your money by giving misinformation. This is a zero sum game. Only make money when someone else loses.
Lol gotcha! Dyor...
You’re obviously not an experienced trader. Just buy within your means and hodl. Else you’ll get rickety rekt son.
buy back at 6k
If I were you I would buy back immediately, this will go straight up to 9000 again.. look at the double bottom... cheers!
Chew, what is your stop loss this time? 
They never were. They are public using cheap pseudonyms
Bittrex I would presume? They have a special partnership with UpBit
1000+ BTC buy wall gets destroyed and yet here we are back above 8.3 (perhaps only momentarily) - what the hell is going on?
That was so crispy to watch!
Totally organic.
haha yeah...8370.01 vs 8370.00
Yep I saw the exact same thing, yet the 4 hour macd is even more obvious of a signal. It's moving in a triangle and could breakout around the 29th like you said.
Well we're more matching the kind of volatility seen around early July 2014 which was followed by a one year bear period where price kept making lower lows (not that I'm suggesting we repeat this).  We're still oscillating around the center point of this correction which is ~$8k.

Every other bubble has started from a period of low volatility (i.e. not now) ... we can expect to wait at least through the summer for confirmation of a continuation of the bull cycle or a more prolonged bear market.

Based on fib time timelines, I don't think we'll have confirmation until early August
The patterns repeat but in a few different timeframe with many other patterns repeating separately and all together
The "next bull run" from $2000 to $6000 won't really be much consolation to many people here.

And not saying that is the likely range, but it's very possible and when people talk about the next bull run, they seem to think BTC will shoot past $20K.  It is unlikely it will see that price again in the next several years.
There you go.
I don’t even know what the trend is any more
Pomp eet 
Just went long all in.

Good luck!
This turns me bullish. Sorry, how can you decide to go into fiat NOW? Are you crazy?
I would wait for a good bounce and then run for the exits. 8300 isnt that great given the rsi
Love it! I started this joke and I can’t wait for the fruitful expansions.

Don’t forget that the food in Goblin Town is caked with salt
Someone should make a candlestick chart with eggplants and zucchini instead of red/green candles.
Enjoy the real world!
It's also possible that it already played out by slowing the downward momentum with the small bounce.
Are you thinking of closing it at breakeven? Or you reckon there will be more upwards movement?
I think you are pretty much spot on, the question now is whether 7.2k-7.6k can hold or if a retest of 6k is coming. I'm really not sure if it will hold this time and I wonder what sort of bounce we would get if it did. Any ideas?
10/10 imo

agreed, time to give up hope on longs and start preserving fiat value
I'm wondering how big of a bounce we will see if we break this trendline, if we even see a bounce at all. In my opinion, it won't be very big.
I think chances of a break up are higher than another dump. It is trying to dump further, so it "wants" to break down, but no volume behind it anymore, decreasing with every 1h candle, plus bullish divergences (sorry, on mobile, so no chart).

EDIT: ... and it broke down LOL
Yep, also posted a message about that yesterday, pretty clear (I'd bet that EOS plays a role).

Similar position to you man, how confident are you 6k will hold? 
yup... broke to the upside... we may see a $8650 retest
The resilience of the initial Feb. 6k longs still baffles me and perpetuates the idea that longs are harder to squeeze than shorts.

Congrats on your escape. We'll played, sir.
Nice job.  I blew my load too early on the DCA and started too large, and I've only been able to derisk a portion of mine and at a little below break even (ca is about 8720 vs spot). Looks like the rest will get stopped out below this bull flag.

At least though I didn't get rekt and feeling relatively fine about the situation.

Glad you got out of that okay 
Hope it is so, brother. Looks like it's making a symmetric wedge on the 2hr. Hoping it will break up and play out as you say.
8 minutes left and we have to close above 8412. Currently we are at 8464 on Bitfinex. 
Yup, bears attempted a final dump of the day to bring it in to the red  but looking good as long as no one market sells 200 btc in the next 4 minutes.
quite the aladeen news for bulls
People react hilariously to BTC price movements.  Last week, I was see "we'll never see under 9k again" comments getting upvoted.  Today, it's the opposite.  

Honestly, I kind of understand it.  It's not like watching a company's stock valuation fluctuate, because they still have assets and products and revenue etc.  BTC is different because if everyone suddenly decided it was pointless, it'd be worth next to nothing.  I think people fear that moment might be arriving when there's a sudden downward movement.

I think those fears are overblown though.  So I'm still buying.
This will actually be the year BTC hits negative numbers. People will actually pay you to take them. /s
You can't call it a double bottom until it completes. Plenty of patterns look textbook and then never complete. 
[Zero](https://i.imgur.com/NtyeePu.png)
> , but anyone who claims with such a perfect certainty that we're "definitely" going below $6k sometime this year because blah blah blah is full of shit.

You are saying that you can't call $6K with 100% certainty?   Ummmm....of course.  Nor can you call 9K with the same certainty.

5K and 3K certainly have a probability well over 0%.  
6k breaking is in my opinion an unlikely but still possible event. It is smart to think what would you do if this happens; where would you buy, would you continue to short etc. 

I don't think many people think 3k is likely to happen, but 6k is the main support and it is not 100% certain it will hold a third time. 
We hit and bounced off a perfect .5 retracement from 6.5 to 10k and the despair-o-meter is flashing deep red vOv. 

Altho longs are concerning and shorts haven't started opening it seems, so it feels quite uneasy. 

But nothing really incredibly bad yet.


You harp on saying because it hasn't happened in the past it probably won't happen

What part of past performance is no indicator of future performance did you miss?

> It looks like the downward resistance line from 20k has turned into support

In case others were confused too, he means a horizontal line drawn from the point at which we broke through the diagonal resistance line (it broke through at 8500ish, the same diagonal is sitting at 7500ish now)

Though that line is kind of resisting us now from the looks of it, too early to call anything significant imo.
I see that 6000 BTC buy wall from $8000-8300 to be there to paint the tape for a mega dump. 

Basically its there to paint a capitulation by the bulls.
~~8.2 is probably fake too.~~ It's back
Increasing leverage means you will use less xbt for the position.

Are you talking about xbt available overall? Or for the position?
someone wants to close the daily in red?
Slightly underwater long here. I won't be closing at break even. I'm expecting a big profit.

Those little dumps are desperation from somebody who needs to buy a whole heck of a lot of coins to cover their little tantrum on Thursday and Friday.

Kind of crazy how close we are and we all got so bullish lol. 

I still think if we had just pulled back further earlier the situation wouldn't look so bad 
We had this little recent bullish endeavor because shorts were at an ATH and had to all cover at once. Falling price with increasing longs and decreasing shorts is a recipe for disaster. Its as if the bulls *don't* want the price to go up. Shorts have a massive impact on bullish moves.

Low volume on pumps is a very bullish signal. Means it takes less money to drive the price up than to drive it down, and in a manipulated market, that's a key metric.
>The 4hr RSI is now just under 19. The 4hr RSI low on the Feb 6 drop to $6k was 20.

Come on my friend. I know a little how you feel. I'm on a secret mission testing out Aragon project for the running of a business im creating... and then giving away to my niche community. The mission is so secret, even my community doesnt know this. I get slaughtered the moment i mention it on any sub.  Found myself stressing to maintain my initial input's value. Now no choice but to trade. Started to get a little rush off it too. Amongst others i really value your contribution. In fact i doubt i'd understand half as much as my baptism of fire has taught without you specifically. Often with fab delivery :) So no advice here from an adopter turned trader, but much gratitude. Hope this helps you feel a little better
Yeah you should get out if 10% daily swings are too much for you. The volatility doesn't make it completely unusuable, but you shouldn't yet expect as much stability as currencies that are used as a unit of account. We are still in the price discovery phase of store of value. After that will come medium of exchange, which will involve more price discovery, probably at lower volatility. Eventually we'll get to the unit of account phase, which is only possible once volatility has died down.

This extreme volatility is the only possible way bitcoin can be metabolized by market forces. Just zoom out a bit and you see these volatile ups and downs are in the context of something larger.
> i.e. selling at 4h RSI below 20.


Hahaha

> proven to be completely unusable with (yet again) another 10% daily swing.

But.. how can that be...? it's a store of value!?

With respect, if you think crypto is unusable, it's because you're merely a speculator ignorant of the current applications.

Until you've used an Abra wallet to maintain a persistent value of X, watched someone seamlessly send funds to their mom in Honduras, or checked out social-incentivization platforms like Steemit, let's not make sweeping generalizations.
I think you are right. The bottom of my downtrend-channel is reached at 8240. I hope we bounce here short-term or we will get a heavily selloff.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/BArNYqu8/
The same group that has been forcing the market down with massive sell volume at every key resistance level all week. 4 hour rsi at all time low on default timeframe with no bad news out. The amount of money it takes to accomplish this sort of price suppression (80% sell volume on finex for hours at a time) is pretty impressive.
People buying into the "going to to 7800 or lower" TA
The hype is gone. All that's left is sellers.
LOL, every green candle, just mash the sell button again.
Probably all the ICOs that raised their seed capital in BTC.
I think it's more like who is buying actual BTC at the moment. :(

Longs are still stagnating or rather increasing while shorts are even closing and still the price goes down. Very bad. I missed the short train and i am somewhat trapped now because i do not want to open a short here...
I'm buying....the first of my scaled closes on my short.
Hammers still need volume as confirmation. Volume isn't great. I am still long but reduced a bit cause the overall bounce right now looks weak and could potentially only be a RSI reset.
You literally made a comment right before this one telling everyone to stay out lol 

Need to calm down a bit here :)
I am new to leverage trading. Could you explain me what role does proportion of shorts and longs have?

From first point of view i see this as the more longs there are the easier it is totrigger the chain of buying. Hence more longs good for bulls... 

From another view i see that the more longs there are the more reasonable for exchange (and some whales) to just put huge buy orders to screw everyone up. 

Could you explain me please the real logics here? 

Longs 64% to shorts 36% right now.

Insanity.

Can you elaborate on why the volume is bearish?
"buying pressure are sellers waiting to sell" I had to read that twice and let it sink in
if you zoom out and check volume and price on the weekly base, you can see that after volume dropped off in several cases we had a big rise suddenly after that. volume dropping off does not mean it is automatically bearish.. 
there was no bull flag
That was no bullflag. More like a bullfrog. It hopped!

That's not why funding rate is negative. Funding rate is negative because bitfinex is below gdax and bitmex traders follow bitfinex whereas bitmex spot is based on gdax+bitstamp.

Shorts are still decreasing while longs increase- which means the market is still very bullish.

Add this to the fact that futures premium is still decent. 1% for june and 2% for sept
for me $8600 was very important support point. When that got down the continuance of bull run was invalidated. And when you get rejected from a lower high, the price doesn't just sit there scratching its ass, it usually goes back down to find a lower low. 
> Come troll me if we're not pass this brief bearishness next week. I will be humbled.

Gotta agree. 1 month ago price was sub 7k and all the newly minted bottom bears swore the 4 month long ~60% dump was just the beginning. In reality all the panic and dumping failed to produce a lower low and the market rose back to 10k.

Since 10k we've had nearly 1 week straight of red and yet price is still over 8k and about 20% above the bottom trend line at 6900, so all this bearish reinvidication sentiment around here seems very silly to me.
BTC dropped 20% ~ from 10k, made the lower low, confirmed crucial support of 8650 as a resistance now and keeps on being weak. Want everyone to be bullish?
>  Crypto has never been stronger. 

It was stronger before it was banned by China, India, and most of the rest of the world, in some capacity or another.
Bitcoin has never been stronger..... Hmmmmm I'd say the past 4 months say otherwise
nobody here is professional trader. literally everyone, not a single exception, is an amateur who didnt know a thing about trading prior to bitcoin. i dont believe anyone who claims otherwise and/or even provides so-called "proof".  most of us are just doing whatever.
Those people trigger me more than the price going down :) lol
For anyone else who was around, this is exactly it. I remember price rising to 120 after months of 80-100. Then it was back to 80-100 for a bit more. 
In an economic crash many investors pull out of stocks, to retain cash in case they lose their jobs, in order to pay their mortgage, to buy food etc, not to then go and plough it into the most volatile market on earth and potentially get hammered once again.
Of course crypto is going to be affected , people will lose jobs and a lot money because of the stock market crash and they will definitely cash out of crypto 
there will be be panic selling every
Its crazy in my opinion to consider crypto a safe place 
Im all about economic crash, we've been overdue for some time, but there just isn't an outcome where Crypto picks up the pieces.  Maybe long term after a crash and rebuild, some individuals do really well in a crypto rebuild but the average person will lose a huge amount in such a crash.  

And what would I do? I mean, hope to sell before it happens, what else can you do...wait I guess.

Buy options both put and call.
We'll find out if Bitcoin is really a success at that point.  When the banks and big financial firms come asking for a multi-hundred-billion/trillion-dollar handout, they may be told to fuck off by a public that no longer needs them thanks to crypto.
Not saying a reset isn't coming but Jim Rogers, Marc Faber and lots of other such public figures make doom and gloom predictions on a regular basis. They're bound to be right eventually but based on their track record... let's just say their crystal ball is far from flawless :)
I would use Jim Roger's strategy for gold, but for crypto.
It's pointless to ask "what-ifs" for scenrios like that, just have a balanced porfolio that can be rebalanced in an economic downturn.
I dont think crypto will be affected. It's new economy, if everything else crashes again it proves the world needs something new, better, and I'd expect money to pour into crypto.

3 to 4 more of these dumps can put us at 6400-6500.
hmm 1D isn't oversold at all, is it..? 
Good one, however, increase your stop loss to just above your entry!

Hello downward (deflationary) spiral. Why buy BTC today when it will most likely be cheaper tomorrow?
honestly think u guys trying to catch knives are wyld. This thing just loves to trend lately. I shorted at $7.8k on the way up and the dumb fucker got all the way up to $8.8k before I unhedged and said fuck it take me to the moon 
It would be ballsy to use stops at this point. 
The wall was pulled short-term. I don't think it is real.
yeah, except it still isn’t bouncing

We’re up a grand total of 77 bucks

Remember when BTC would bounce 33% in an hour from oversold into overbought?

Yeah, Pepridge farm remembers
yeah, but we are getting into a wedgy thing now. we cannot continue to drop with this rate, otherwise we would end at 2k in 18 days. 
This is pretty good

Which downtrend line is that?
I'm not sure how/why people try and trade these inbetween zones, it seems much better to wait for the momentum shift. This over trading is what gets people into trouble I think.

I'm still worried about the 8k+ longs that are 100% underwater by now....
[Like this?](https://www.tradingview.com/x/HhaJA6nG/)
There is really no reason(outside global scale calamity) this won't become a multi trillion dollar market(yes even with sec ico crackdown) in the next couple years. So much upside its tough to make a long term bear case that does not rely on some speculative boogie man. 
That's the problem - when everyone is bullish, that means they all bought into their positions. Which also means they aren't going to be helping push the price upwards as it rises - they are the ones selling and working against the upward trend.

With so many people missing the 20k peak, a lot want to get out at 10k, and that makes it freaking hard to break.
> simply because it happened in the past. Recipe for disappointment in any market.

I just told this to someone very close who is HODLing from around $2,000 and he doesn't want to believe me. I first told at $9,800+ range. Last night I reminded him how it went down to as low as $8,400. Still faithful, started telling me stories of how some unknown country will do some unknown thing that will make Bitcoin skyrocket again. Moments like these, I have to lol.

He said he is not currently adding more $ stack to buy BTC, whats shocking is that neither is he willing to sell, but definitely want to add more $ to buy BTC when it hits $6,000. 

I recommended him reading these daily discussions on the market. God bless him.
8k coins doesn't move us from $9900 to $8200. Unless they market sold literally everything on Bitfinex...and the other exchanges do not participate  in price discovery and just follow finex 100%...which wouldn't happen cause of arb bots. 


You do realize 8k BTC (especially per month) is nothing with respect to the daily volume exchanges do, in particular OTC?

Hell 1.8K BTC are mined every day.
We're not at your targets yet ;)

Someone or some people sold a fuckton of coins in a hurry, then Korea FUD, TA becomes self-fulfilling prophecy, also panic selling due to PTSD from the major drops of months past. that's definitely an oversimplification though.
failure to break through $10K with volume getting lower and lower = a lower high has been established

and then there is a rush for the door and the price goes looking for a lower low
Why does it need an explanation?
Same boat, but I didn't close because I was asleep
Exact same situation as yours. I will add more on the way down as I am on low leverage. 6 hr RSI is way oversold and 8.2 is an important level. 

Having said that, have your own plan. No one can manage your trade and risk for you. 
As someone said a very good thing earlier today 'Don't get married to your position'. Considering that, I will recommend you close it at BE if possible or with as minimum loss as possible.
Maybe take some off when we get to 8.4k? Technically we're in the higher low territory but it's looking pretty weak, so it really could go either way. decrease exposure to minimize risk? 
I'm holding a long from 8.65 and not worried about it at all. As long as you use low leverage, you have the luxury of time. Even if I were to close at a loss, I'd be OK with it because I caught a wick at 8223 or so and bought what I would theoretically lose if I closed this trade underwater. That buy will definitely turn very green (it's already green) over time. Time is money. If you're not over-leveraged or over-invested, just sit tight.
Personally I would GTFO right now.
Cut your losses 
Quit margin trading
Buy some books about trading and spend some time doing paper trading or go trade on the testnets

You wouldn’t be in your situation now if you had done that before
Just keep moving your stops up as the price is rising. 
Everything closed an took a loss of 39% of my portfolio. Time to learn some strategy. 
I like this position. Long with a tight stop loss makes sense
If you look longs vs shorts being in short now would be the better option going by your logic.

Double bottom has to go up for it to be confirmed...
Double bottom at such a small time frame? idk. But as others suggested, it has to go up, and probably break $8,650 to be confirmed.


Time frame is too short for a convincing double bottom yet.
I believe a double bottom would have to be confirmed with a break above $8,650. It’s too early to call it 
Seems More like a pennant / symmetrical triangle.
Short it?
Why would “blockchain week” pump the price? Potential buyers don’t care, dumb money don’t care.

Market cycles are just reflection of human emotions. In bull market we had very bad news (Bitfinex lost 120k btc, China completely banned BTC trading) but up trend was barely affected. Same situation can happen with bear market where good news won’t reverse the down trend.
concensus goers selling their btc to buy admission tix and cover costs.
Manipulation to buy cheap before consensus pump. Happened last year
You need to accept that this can go much, much lower.  The bull market trends are done for now.

In 3 years we're going to be way higher.  But for the next few months, things are gong to be tough.  If you mentally prepare for the worst, you'll be better for it.
jop, that is my assumption as well \(see post below\). rebounce to 8.48 is quite likly. \(dont understadt why chewy was so overeager and closed for a small loss\)

Why are you so worried about what people here think? You seem to be very sure of your arguments, wouldn't it be really easy to go all-in now and enjoy the profits, which, as I understand from your wall of text, are right around the corner?

Also, every intelligent argument recognizes the possibility of its own demise, even at some minuscule level. Yours doesn't. Absolutes are never a good way to turn people, in my opinion. 
You are so offended -- I love it! Rock on, u/Antonomon.
The tool I'm using to predict drops is in a sack between my legs mate, idk what tool you're talking about. I am bearish short term and bullish long term, I don't need an excuse, it's just an opinion. A massive blow off top of 20k takes time to settle and rebuild, there will be periods when Bitcoin is undervalued. There is a whole market cycle to get through before real hype has a solid foundation. Good luck without trades.
Its always dark in a bears den mate
we hit $6,000 then bounced back to $12,400, then dumped back down to $6,000 then bounced back to $9,800 and now heading back down.

you can call it being a permabear all you want, but if bulls can't even manage to take down $10,000 with all the good news you mentioned then what do you think will happen to the price when you run out of good news to prop the price up?

Nothing goes up forever, the bulls had a good 1 month long run, hopium was consumed, jerks were circled, now the cycle is just repeating itself and this thing is going down. That's just crypto.


many of the trading bears in this sub do not believe in bitcoin long term, and that's ok. they are traders, and many of them are interested in bitcoin because they believe the market is the largest collection of dumb money ever assembled, and they see an opportunity to exploit it. if returns in this asset dry up, they will move elsewhere. 
Well to be fair, you could use your own argument against you. 

With all the good news you mentioned, why did the bubble pop, retrace 70%, and has yet to draw in new money?

TA is a better guide in a bear market than the presumption that good news will boost the market.  

Human psychology is the only constant that exists across the entire of span of every market. People outside of the traders loop are still nervous to gamble/invest into a speculate asset that had depreciated pretty significantly from it's ATH over a fairly short amount of time.

I do agree though, this news is great and will eventually set the stage for an incredible bull run. It's impossible to know when. 


This reads like the crypto equivalent of redpill. There's no definitive reason to believe that the bottom is in. It could be but we won't know that for quite some time. Furthermore, the news items you referenced are not all that substantial when talking about the price. Sure, it's more acceptance from legitimate mainstream institutions and shows that there is still interest in Bitcoin itself but this news could've come out when we we're around $1K people would be saying that it was going to bring us to new highs of 1.5K or something. Point being that news is relative but doesn't actually say too much about what people will actually buy and sell Bitcoin Throwback for. There's good reason to think that we're sitting on weak support all the way down to the previous ATH breakout of 1.2K. Personally I don't think it'll get all the way down there but if I were to place a wager, I'd say that $6K is almost certainly not the bottom.

Beyond that, I don't understand your point that short term bears / long term bulls are somehow in the wrong here. That's what I am. I believe that Bitcoin Throwback will reach a market cap of over $20T if the tech proves itself (mostly LN at this point) but, like I said, I think that there's a lot of bullish exuberance that needs to be retraced before things settle, turn around and strong upward momentum is resumed. The most important factors in turning things around strongly are LN proliferation and the upcoming halvening. These things, particularly the first, will be good reason for new money to flow in, including, hopefully, a lot of institutional money, which is what Bitcoin Throwback really needs to reach new ATHs of 100K, 500K, etc. The future is bright but that doesn't mean that we don't have more downside.
> which was unable to predict this drop

lol what? entire comment invalidated. Also your comment is not insightful or new, there have been about 3 dozen comments like this since January.
That's not very skeptical of you... Either way be careful calling a bottom or a top here. My personal opinion is we're heading down. The news mostly doesn't matter, the news seems to follow the price and not the other way around (I know it sounds strange).

>Seems like everyone is a permabear when it’s easy to be so, but don’t you understand this is a self-fulfilling prophecy? Please stop. 

I doubt people on reddit have that much influence on the price.

>“I am a bear in the short-term but a bull in the long-term.” This is just an attempt to save your own skin because, like I said, the further adoption of crypto is fast among us.

I disagree... Looking at btc in particular it should be common knowledge with people in the space by now that bitcoin can be brutal. Sure the gains are potentially amazing but to say that a sub 5K level is absurd seems a little OTT if you ask me. Bitcoin was sub 1K like 18 months ago, how is 5K absurd? Honestly I don't see why this sub is as bullish as it is in the medium term (months) if you disregard short term moves. My money's money a big move lower and I don't think that any trading desk news etc is particularly going to change my view on that. I think fundamentally crypto (MAYBE not bitcoin ATM but that is totally up for debate) is overvalued and will correct further and if the alt's go down they will likely bring bitcoin with it.

1. TA is here for us to make educated guesses about where it is going to go. It clearly indicated the possibility for a rejection at 10k.
2. Please go to r/bitcoinHODL if you want to shittalk trading, since clearly this is not the sub for you. People here either like to trade, or don't like to hold a volatile asset such as bitcoin, and lose sleep over it. Nobody knows where crypto is going, we are all here to make educated guesses. 
3. Here we do TA instead of fundamental analysis, so if you have nothing to contribute with regards to the subject, please lurk only.
4. If you are dead sure about BTC to 100k, just HODL and STFU. Don't talk your book here. You think this whole sub will go long to pump your bag?
Personally, I think we’re still trying to find out the fair value of BTC & this whole market. No one really knows for sure yet if we are still in a bubble or are we severely undervalued for the potential that crypto offers. Assets shouldn’t increase 50% in a day, that’s nonsense. Do I think we have stumbled upon revolutionary technology? Of course I do. Do I think it’s worth 400 Billion market cap as of this moment? I can’t say for certain that I believe that
>...but to say we are going there again now is absurd.

reminds me of the person who said this is the last chance to buy sub-10k Bitcoin just last week
It's not being a "permabear" to say the price is likely to drop.  I said this at $10K and was called a permabear.  You are trying way too hard, because you can't mentally accept a bear market and declining prices.
Wow GS will make bitcoin useful? Im so excite finally more people can trade bitcoin :/
just a technical bounce, so yeah the latter
We're still 9% down from 9.4k. and more than 15% from 10k. I think bear market is over comments are little premature. 
lol.
Not gonna lie, a part of me wanted to see that too haha.
I think so.
This is still pretty bad.

dead cat bounce. 

Its almost like no one here knows how a market moves.

edit: I expected a [bounce to 9400 and 8500](https://i.imgur.com/xSxXQ97.jpg). But so far, this drop is faster than I expected. We can't have a sustained drop for a week without any breaks.

For anyone who thinks I am down on bitcoin, I'm not. I think we're going to retest 6k, and if we blow past it, we'll be looking at[ hitting the long term baseline](https://i.imgur.com/KAYWPqZ.jpg) before we bounce.  I don't think its likely, but its a possibility and we should all factor it into our purchases.
set limit orders for futures wicks...I got one at $8950 last night 😍
What if I told you the bounce to 10k was manipulation. And the same is happening. Except the opposite direction.
We just can't go from one bubble to the next within 3-4 months. We need a much longer consolidation phase/correction with a stronger base, but all the bulls fomo'd in the shortsqueeze and yelled for 100k.
I don't like your post... 
I agree with you.
Can you provide any actual reasoning, such as technical analysis, for why you think it will go up $2,000 (which is about 25%) in just one week?
Yup. Anyone who's been around since before 2014 is just hodling and waiting for the shenanigans to be over. 
huh
thats a very dangerous mindset

if the price is falling before an announcement, it most likely means people are treating it as a sell the news event. Otherwise price would continue rising/holding. Holding out for an announcement to save your position is a good way to get stuck holding a bag because a week from now you'll be too far down and will just tell yourself that you might as well hold at these prices. 
Bitcoin generally isn’t affected by major positive news announcements. 

If you want to make money buying the news and selling the rumor, alts is your best bet. They react like crazy to news.

Bitcoin? Good news comes out and bitcoin flips it off. 

Bitcoin? FUD? Yeah let’s just bring everyone down to pound town 
mh. nah. mainstream isn't in. we are finding a pricing balance between the mined coins every ten minutes and the demand of institutional horders.

lightning came and nobody cares. everybody want the new shiny crypto to moon. it will take much longer until it actually consolidates into the handful worthy projects. I hope btc is one of them 
A market full of gamblers is more enticing for informed traders.
yeah this has been the thing that has stopped me from opening a position at 8200

it's pretty scary honestly that these longs have actually been increasing with this drop whereas with the short squeeze off of 6500 the shorts capitulated nearly instantly

I suggest checking out Bitfinex if you can. Not only is there plenty of usd available, but lending rates have dropped substantially into the 0.06% range. 
The same shit happened to me too. I just stick to using no leverage for buys and using leverage for shorts. Euro is even worse. The pool is always empty.
I think many technical bounces were expected, but buyers were edgy and were waiting for a break out missing them one by one. A whale buying jump started the whole thing. 
You'll have to make up your own opinion dude but I think we are out of buyers. I think theres mostly traders left, which will only buy technical bounces like this. I have no faith in the buyers of this market after the past week.
Yeah I just drew it up. Could be making a new big pennant with support line from nov,feb, april lows and they're cross in mid

>Whats the exchanges breakdown of futures trading these days? Is it like 50% of the volume on Bitfinex and 25% of the volume on Bitmex, or am I way off?

Bitfinex doesn't offer futures trading. You would be primarily ooking at Bitmex and OKEx. 
My only advice: Don't rely on strangers, especially on this forum, when making such a decision.
Well, it depends on your risk tolerance and how much of a loss you'd be willing to stomach before being in profit.

I would say if you're going to start building a medium term position here, cautious DCA is the way to go because we're getting to somewhat of a tipping point - 7.8k-8.2k range falling could very well in the end result in a retest of the November-6k crash-recent bottom line. But if it holds it's fairly bullish and entering slightly higher won't be the worst thing in the world.

I'm just some random guy on the internet though, so take that FWIW. As /u/j_ockeghem said, don't use this subreddit as investment advice. Use it as a tool to get exposure to a variety of different opinions/analysis and frame your own viewpoint (keep your perspective).

I mean it actually kinda makes sense. Lots of people seem to think that the bottom is in, and then get surprised when it continues down.

What buy pressure? You mean the inevitable bounce? This thing can't just soar down to 5k.
If 8200 were to break there is previous support around 7800-7900 but of course there is no guarantee it would hold there.
Be careful, what looks like buying volume increasing can be buyers who are bored with waiting and not making good decisions.

If you leave the word "bulltard" out of your post you can stop from looking like a gigantic cock. Just FYI.
Now isn’t the time to gloat, really. Down from 10k a week ago, now at 8.5k and a less than 300 rise. Could easily plummet from here.
funny thing is no one is even shorting anymore...You're just laughing at hodlers who panic sold. :/ 

shorts are at like what 19k? lol, and futures are still at a big premium 
Longs are gloating after a $300 rise?  That should tell you alot.
I wonder where the collaterals for all shorts comes from. There must be an opposite side of every trade or a market maker that sell their bitcoins as hedge. It's not so easy to just lend bitcoins to short them.
of-course you can.
>Noobish margin trading question - can I long BTC on Bitfinex using BTC rather than fiat (USD)? I'm guessing not? And if not, is there any other exchange apart from Bitmex where I can do this?

I think you're asking about using btc as collateral for a margin long? If so, yes, you can do this on bitfinex. Your bitcoins will be used as collateral for the usd you borrow to purchase the btc. 
Why is that bright?
Store of value over what time period? The argument is that Bitcoin will prove to be a multi-decade store of value, not a day-to-day store of value like the better fiat currencies.
Mt Gox fud where they leave out key facts to make it seem much worse than it is. 

Not that gox can sell any of their btc until the meeting in september to decide if they are even going to sell them or distribute them. But for the sake of argument, even if they did sell the 16k bitcoin that was moved that is being covered by all these shit "journalists" it would basically just cause a day like today.
 On finex alone, in the past 24 hours 25k btc were sold vs 17k bought - that is an 8k difference right there on just one exchange in 24 hours. We have basically had multiple gox sell off type days in a row with no negative news and with a lot of TA that was reliable in the past being ignored/going out the window.

>Alright you guys, what is the best possible solution for this Mt.gox shit show in the long term for Bitcoin.

First off this drop isn't entirely Mt Gox related. With that said this **is** the best long term solution. Get those coins out of their hands and into the hands of the people.

It's not pleasant short term, but oh well.
Probably a continued downward trend / chop / accumulation period over the next 12-18 months until all the coins are sold and the next halving sits right on the horizon.
PERSEVERANCE AND PATIENCE
Without really going into whether or not these drops are Gox related, clearly there currently is a supply/demand imbalance at these price levels. We will probably have to incur lower prices until these coins have found their way into other takers in the market. As other have mentioned, this is unfortunate in the short term as prices will decrease (substantially) though when the excess influx of coins ceases, both by gox finishing selling off and the halvening, the imbalance we swing towards scarcity. Then we will probably see the real fireworks. 
Contrition.
Exactly my thoughts. I was pretty confident after we first tested 8.65k that we’ll do it again and 8.5k will hold. But we just kept dropping n dropping. Very strange behaviour which proved the whole bounce was a DCB. Wasted my several hours on that trade and lost all the profit and eventually closed at a small loss... Bulls really need to get their act together!
Weren't you the one advocating for goblin town while we made gains the past week or two? 

I agree with your earlier sentiment though, that BTC might be overvalued at this point with insufficient fundamentals supporting it. I decreased my position so much after our 10k rejection that now I'm not too worried about visiting goblin town as getting some real cheap BTC will be nice in the long run.
I was counting on 8500 too.  The bulls just can't pull anything together.

we went up like 20% solely on liquidations/stops. There are no shorts to liquidate/stop out now. We're at like 5k less shorts than we were last time we were here 

You guys might think people here are the majority but if you look at the numbers most people are still bullish and there aren't nearly enough shorts to carry us upwards again. 


Don't need em yet.
Well if its cold storage, 0. Long in the financial word just means you make paper profits off the asset going up- doesn't mean you're leveraged/on margin

It sounds like he unhedged at $9800
It was technically just an entry, I bought from an exchange. But I like saying "long" because it's basically the same as me betting that it will go up. So besides the initial fee to buy, it's nothing.
I assume you mean like [this](https://www.tradingview.com/x/J2K1PzJT/) when drawing a channel. Combine that with the targets it does look 'nice' when drawn on a linear chart.

Does give us that last push down to flush out the remaining longs and with the current price action looking weak it adds weight.
I did indeed this is why I set my limit orders before I went to bed without too much worry of the price completely collapsing on me. The four hour TD is typically very reliable.

[I mean what more could you ask for?](https://www.tradingview.com/x/eSyPEf2q/)

Too bad I was out for the night during the top 9, I had limit sells set at 10300 but we didn't reach them. Then busy with work on the second one, as is life you can't catch em all. 
>still holding?

No, closed it a few days ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ito6f/z/dyv1yma) for a 3.2% profit. 
When you've been through it before, downward markets won't rattle you as much. In first 6-7 weeks of 2016, the U.S. equity markets were down ~18%. The only reason the investor wasn't collectively shitting their pants is because we lived through 2008 and a certain day in August 2011 when we dropped 5% in one day.

I think you're looking for a different sub. This is a trading sub. Hence Bitcoin*markets*

Alright true believer.

But this is a trading sub. :)
Ok seems I got too emotional :) Thanks for the suggestions!
Changed. Do you know the pnl? 
I realize I don't *have* to apologize. Everybody is responsible for their own decisions. 

But that doesn't mean I don't feel bad for folks who got stuck in a bad position because they took my advice. 

Honestly, I'm sorry for anybody who has to sit and watch the charts with an underwater position - regardless of whether it was due to my commentary or if it was their own idea. That shit sucks.  
I'm super sceptical of the market right now. I'll probably get spooked and close at breakeven before either of my targets hit. 

But $8,650 seems very likely, considering how oversold the market was prior to this bounce. 
I'll probably hold it for longer than I should, but those are good targets for now. 

Although my general recommendation is to take profit ASAP, because the market is nuts and I'm not super confident in this trade to begin with. 
Thanks chew. At the end of the day, that second one is close to the trade I made. And I made it at 13x (higher than I even traditionally trade), so returns were about like 10x at those entries/exits.

Unless yesterday was a fluke, it does seem like shorting here makes sense, as it looks poised to bart right back down. But I'm like pavlov's dog over here, conditioned not to trade immediately after a huge win lol
Fortunately I moved my stops (June futures) to 8452 before bed, but slippage pushed me to 8500 for the majority of the position. 
Don't sell yourself short. You read analysis, interpreted your risk expectations/limits, and set targets based on it. That sounds more like a good trader than a lucky trader. There's always some amount of luck involved. BitMEX cowboys pulling numbers our of their arses in the trollbox are the ones who get lucky when they win. You did well.

Not bouncing? Could have fooled me. It's up ~$400 since I snagged some sweet, sweet cheap coin on Friday night.
But you are already in a very profitable position.... why add risk here? Just let it ride or atleast add on the breakdown with a stop market. Adding risk here before a possible large move against you is asking to have your profits gently caressed. 
Imo this applies more to longs right now 
Yeah but the waves after a big movement usually get shorter and shorter as time goes by.
And there was negativity throughout the decline. OP selects a moment in the decline to determine his rationale.
It does work indeed:

And until people understand how important privacy is, XMR will be under valued.
because walls don't just go down instantly. 

you have to give people hope

so you sell a bit, and then oh look a bounce. then you sell some more, and again you bounce. But every time you don't bounce as hard, and you have to dig deeper into your buy wall. Until eventually you have to take another leg down 
that one actually might be

the whale sell off usually happens in 2-3-5 BTC chunks. 713 BTC is more of a noob trader who got lucky buying in early in bitcoin deciding to cash out without affecting the market too much 
Been like that for 25min and w/ a $30-40 variance to Bitfinex

Woooo finally it was like a standoff 
The 1 day stoch rsi matches up as well. Both are very low at the same point.

My main concern is the timeframe.. are we really moving at a pace that has turned 2 years into 6 months?
https://www.tradingview.com/x/aEKgAAQ0/

because there is no trend, we've been ranging for months
The trend is at the moment it goes sometime up and sometime down. Good luck with that

quality TA.
May be try to be friend with BitFinex?
It pumped 100 dollars as soon as I sold.
I strongly believe we will see 7k
... said everyone @8500. But agreed, this is the worst possible time to get back into fiat considering medium time frames are seeing lows they haven't in years.
haha yeah, couldn't resist to bring that up again ;-)
Not even sure anymore if I want to 
generally I don't want to  exit at break even points, since there was a reason the market moved the other direction again. I would maybe put a stop loss if we move above 8600 
I'm confident that if we get to $7.2k in the next couple days we'll get a large bounce when we touch both resistance lines ...  even the daily will be oversold at this point... it's impossible to know if it'll be a DCB or if it'll have enough legs to move back into the upper registers of the pennant .. that'll likely take at least a week or two to really play out

I have to say though... if bears manage to push price **below** the log resistance from ATH (which has never happened in *any BTC bubble historically*), it'll paint a very bleak picture for price and I don't think $6k will hold... 
No way we get close to 6k in the short term.  I think we'll get there eventually but we have at least one more short term reversal in store after we drop off this current bear flag.  6k is likely months away.
Yeah, it’s looking really weak at the moment.
Yes. Stops are getting pretty close. Futures premium is increasing again. My first profit-taking buy missed the bottom wick by $6. I'm pissed
I don't know how to get it to update, but my new CA is $8840. /u/justanotherlogin help? Can I change my entry price?

Reasonably. Emotionally I'm ready for this market to tank, 2013-style, but intellectually it's easy to read the charts and see that the 6K-ish level represents strong market structure. I think the RR is good at a 6400 buy. 
I have it being rejected off the top, like perfect touch of the line. 

You have it breaking through? 
We had ascending triangle on 15m.
How do you know for sure that they are still open?
They must be paying so much in funding.
True. Looking at bfx data, it looks it's more likely a long squeeze is used to reduce slippage and be bought into, than as fodder for a brd. What do you think?
There is a special case of longs that can't be squeezed at all called holding. Given how everyone talks about margin trading some of the younger traders trying to fit in with the cool kids call it longing
He’s an artist. 
When the strat tells me to close, I'll close the position, but I'm trading this according to the 3D chart, so expect a longer time horizon than most traders on here.
I must have done the syntax wrong. The average entry was right at 8640...
Thanks
What's a symmetric wedge?
Yea it's like everyone wants to be the guy who "called it" because let's face it, nobody's gonna remember all the suckers who were wrong but if you "predicted" some crazyass number no one in their right mind even considers months out, suddenly you're famous. 
I completely agree with you that 6k is a possible event, like, $1000 is a possible event, $0.10 is a 'possible' event. It's just not bloody likely, but so many people today are parading around pretending they're smarter than everyone else because they have the 'foresight' to add to their shorts at $8300 instead of, you know, taking their fucking profits after we've moved down $1000+ in a single day. 
Reading comprehension isn't your strong suit, I take it. 
Cool! Thank you
Available overall. If i went straight from bitcoin directly to 3x i would be able to use all my xbt which is 0.21, right?

But i am short 1x from 8600 and now want to increase to 3x. But i only have 0.14xbt available instead. Why is that? 
I'd say the little pumps are desperation from someone trying to create fomo... 
ADL is the process by which the exchange avoids potential losses if/when the insurance fund has been depleted; and one or more liquidations are unable to be dealt with at the current market price. 

So (while I’m sure ADL would be occurring) it’s really for different reasons. 

What I’m referring to is a systemic issue: a conflict between Bitcoin’s limited float on the one hand, and the payout function intrinsic to the design of the contracts themselves on the other. 
Too subtle?
I literally market bought at 8259 about 20 mins ago

i am ecstatic 
I should photoshop a mini clipboard on each trendline. Then it's extra official and really knows what it's doing.
If it breaks up, looking to sell before 11.7k resistance. If it surpasses it and holds it, I'll rebuy and hold.

If it breaks down out of the triangle, I'll sell for a $50-$100 loss per bitcoin. The r/r would be worth it.
Yeah, you are right. Now it is like a 100% retrace, lol.
It's hard to anticipate massive, systematic market dumps. Like this is "Korean FUD" lmao. 
2017 correlation looked a lot different.
Bitcoin is a much better store of value than baby brains. Have tried the latter and the inconvenience of having to be in the same location as the brain purchaser, not to mention the refrigeration costs to keep them fresh, makes them a poor alternative to all crypto currencies aside from BCH, which fails due to being a far more unethical practice.
Once i change to the New site i can clean up a bit 
I love you both
A telegram group can defeat my idea of each user deciding which users positions they want to be notified about. PMs here have a rate limit so it should not work correctly. 
I'm holding my short still from basically right here. I feel like I either need to close it out at breakeven or set stops way up above 8800 or so, and I hate doing that before bed. I guess I could reduce it, but I'm trying to simply see trades through rather than constantly scaling/adjusting.
It did and yet we’re still ranging. I thought a strong movement would follow after breaking it. But here we are. 
I can see that but it can also mean that it wouldn’t take that much to reverse the pump. Right?
Yeah figured that out, but my second position isn't reflecting, it's possible to add multiple positions right?

Now I'm wondering if it's just a mini dump and I should scalp close and go long. This is why I shouldn't open a new trade right after closing a successful one - too schizophrenic. Not enough time to assess and pick a side/strategy.
I'm thinking about scaling into a long here. Think I skipped on my crazy pills today.
I closed my long at a modest 0.1 BTC loss and am now down a total of 0.7BTC since we arrived at 8200 the first time.

Not ragequitting, but also not convinced we will see a bounce or any sign of life. I’m probably going to be wrong and at this point it doesn’t matter to me anymore.

Ragequit would be shorting now, no?
Thanks man. I don’t feel bad at all. This is all just a game to me, but I appreciate you writing.

there are very few icos that did this
Agree but dumps losing momentum \- so I think we are definitely getting closer even if this was not the absolute bottom, yet...
true but i was mostly thinking about all the guys going lets just long teh dip! think the rr for a long here is pretty bad still when bitcoin is dropping like this
looks at it like this:  
you only got X amount of buying power, if you expend all of that just maintaining the current price, then who is left to increase it ?  You got no buying power left 
tradingview.com btcusdlongs and btcusdshorts
!long btcusd close 8533
because it’s non existent 
because the volume is all in red candles-most heavy movement is downwards. the upwards movement is mainly just people sitting back and waiting for the price to go up- it's a game of chicken where people wait as long as they can to sell. 

The difference between this and say, November is that the volume upwards was like panic buying. now it s just extremely hesitant buying where people are trying to get in before the next dump occurs 
Sellers are waiting to buy too, goes both ways.
think about it like...sellers are just waiting in the bushes to come out and attack. as
long as they are hidden the price goes up. Once the first one jumps out they all jump out and we dump 

so it's not convincing upwards movement - no one believes in it to hold off on selling  long enough 
it's not that  volume is low, it's that all of the volume is in the selling. no one actually wants to buy and hold the asset, they are just trying to sell the bounces
What is hard to understand about that? The line is @8300 and has been touched 5 times already.
I do not have a lot of hope. 8650\-8700 is the maximum imo. Horizontal support turned resistance. Same for 8500. I think we'll at least get to 8400.
Yeah thanks. I was getting a bit nervous there on the second touch of 8200. But lucky me was eating lunch so I didn't close my long.
[deleted]
Funding and GDAX premium/discounts seems to have been a good indicator for swing trades lately. GDAX was very bearish in high 9ks. 
Where do you get that from?   I believe, generally speaking, the rate is negative for shorts, when they outnumber longs, and vice versa.  


This is what I'm talking about. you stick to your own set of rules, but crypto (and the market) are not just some numbers. There are thousands of interconnected factors affecting it and when most of them are positive, short term trends cannot invalidate the bigger positive outlook. Barring any systematic shock (like China and South Korea ban), I see this market only going up. You guys give TA too much credit.
Finally! Someone accepted my challenge! Also please remind me if we go bullish so I can gloat :D
This is the most accurate statement I've ever seen here.


Fundamentals beats trend trading. One major dip and it's all goblin town and bear market talk. This place is worst than /r/buttcoin during a crash/dip.
All those numbers, 9200, 8800, 8600 all were supposed to be supports but they fell like water and they could be broken just as easily. This is what I'm talking about. I'm not saying everyone to be bullish, but one week of red and everyone is talking about apocalypse again. 
No, it was an unregulated hellhole. It still is but less so and is going to be better. It's growth now is more organic, more depending on solid tech and adoption (and institutional investment) instead of every pleb buying into every shitcoin and scam there is. The whole ecosystem of crypto is stronger and continues to be
"Crypto has never been stronger" was my sentence, bitcoin is a part of crypto. A big part, true. But not the only part. If it stagnates too much, alts will go to overdrive and pull it along, it happened before and it will happen again.
There are a few pros on here. You can usually tell who's who after a while. Some have traditional trading backgrounds; some don't. Sure, they are outnumbered 10-to-1 by noobs and Crypto Chads, but they're here.

Also depends on how you define "professional." I think if you've been doing this multiple years and are self-sustaining off of trading, then you're a pro. But different people define it differently.
In 2014, eh?
Well as they say “everyone gets from the market what he wants”, so some might actually do it.
You bet money will get rip out of crypto as soon as the crash comes. People will need more money to pay bills during these time, especially crypto kids.
And after it drops below 6400, we're in goblin town?
it'll probably go lower than that

we dropped to $6,300 from $12K....this time we are dropping from $9,800 so testing $5K is def on the table. 
A change from 9200 to 8200 in two days is definitely oversold imo. I shouldn’t have stated it as 1D since that technically isn’t oversold. 
Tim Draper's eyebrows? they make a good support level for BTC.
Yeah I should prob OD on some chill pills and calm down and enjoy my potential 12 hours of sleep instead Yolo Longing because I hit my lucky number in roulette one too many times last night. 

Thanks for the 9 character sentence that’s gonna steer me away from a dark underwater path 
WE NEED THE WALL
Time for another few hours of a bear flag to give you time to doubt why you use RSI as an indicator?   This dip is getting bonkers
What price range are you expecting a bounce from? Just curious
I remember that. That was when people knew it was going to go back up. I don't know if those people are here en mass anymore. 
It can continue dropping at this rate- that's what a bubble popping would look like.

In reality though, crypto won't go out without a fight but it'll be a bloody mess till we hit $5k
Bitcoin: “Hold my beer”
https://www.tradingview.com/x/eaLEcqWI/

lol wow
Yeah, i noticed it too, the supporting is getting less steep.
The bad news is that it still has a LOT of room to go down.

Sorry, should've clarified. the one starting at 10k:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/tFOkqGw1/
Greed is the answer
there are plenty of reasons. I can see it happening but assuming it's guaranteed is silly 
This is the exact problem - no new money coming in.
Excellent observation. 
BINGO. Twitter is remarkable for market psychology. When the price even barely starts heading north again, every bonehead comes out of their cave with the ridiculous bullish price targets...You can just smell the desperation for a bullish move from everyone caught holding the bag...

Parabolic Trav is the poster child for this. He hides when price declines and whenever there's a run like we had a couple weeks ago, he comes out with tweet after tweet with some nonsense about how the price is about to head north of 100k any day now..
Not true at all. I’m bullish and am adding every week. Many of us who are bullish are using BTC as a store of value or savings account and adding to it constantly - also as a means of DCA. There might not be enough of this happening right now but it’s happening a lot.

What surprises me most is the constant sell pressure and these relentless large dumps.
You realise that if he's holding from 2k then this is hardly the first time someone has warned him of "impending" doom and gloom yes?

He was advised to sell when it crashed from 3k. Again when it crashed from 5k. Probably again from 8k in Nov. He got twice advised to sell at 6k in the last few months, too.
You’re sounding so sure you know more than this guy, but he has every chance of being correct so be careful what you convince him of as you might both regret it.

The TA here is medium and short term related, not much analysis here purports to say where BTC will be in 2 years from now.

You sound like the kind of person who had he listened to you, he’d have cashed out at 2k.
Maybe you’re the stupid one?
Daily volume on exchanges is to a large extent the same coins going back and forth.  8K of new coins is a non-trivial amount for the market to absorb.
Which means 1.8K coins could be sold everyday!

Edit: Also you read about the Pineapple Fund, which is a great thing but you know what that means?  Any charity organizations that received those coins will now sell them! 
Its doesn't need to anymore although it would be great. w/ SL set .... its still way way on the green.
? The price is 20$ below my entry lol. Not really RIP and as I said it was a smaller long. 
Lmao why the f is everyone so negative. And why is everyone saying RIP when my long is not even down 1% yet.
Imo it's utterly irrisponsible for a trustee to manipulate the market like this. Nothing like raping the gox victems over and over again.
At the very least, the trustee contributed to FUD. And it looks like every 6 hours or so, bitcoin is getting a large dump. Imo, this is the trustee dumping, testing his limits, trying to get a personal entry point into BTC without completely killing it.

I don't know what I'm talking about though 
thats a good one
I saw it test 8650 once and thought it’ll def try at least one more time and may break it on second attempt. But surprisingly it never tested it again! Can’t believe what a dogs breakfast I have made of a trade I could have so easily closed in profit. Probably greed got to me... again!! Feel like hell. 
i know i know. Im new to this. I was an Iota hodler from 0.4  untill now and started margin trading 2 weeks ago. Was too greedy and cancelled my stop orders. Its not too bad because my portfolio is only 3000$ and i have a job. Its playmoney.
I hope i will learn from whats happening right now.
I'd second this approach. 9300 is still pretty far away, but this still has plenty of room to go up. That being said, I'd wager the overall trend is down. just try to minimize losses by moving up your stops as it climbs, who knows, you might get out at BE or even in the green. 
Also set market stops behind your limit stops as a safety net. These large candles are quick can move straight through your limit sells without there being enough time for them to execute. 
He’s testing out a contrarian strategy but Some Completely Average Guy agrees with him. Don’t see how this can possibly work out.
No he has a theory
OK. Let's watch this space. Thanks guys. 
[deleted]
I think so too. And the last ten minutes of price action is pretty damn hard to reconcile with a double bottom scenario. 
Do not trade on anything you read on reddit. Almost all the posts here are reactionary to the current price. It's a lagging indicator of sorts. You can go back 1-2 days in the daily and see how many are taking out longs and downvoting anyone who said the price is going to drop more. When most people are talking about shorting it, then you should consider going long. But you just read that from a reddit post, so don't listen to me.
as good of place as any
It's just a good observation as far as I can tell.
This market movement did not happen last year.


Last year price was booming leading up to and during the consensus event, from May 17-24, and then on May 25th and 26th it just crashed. 
Sure, good publicity for Consensus if it's pumping during it.
Because that.

It’s called an argument. If I wanted to sit on two chairs at once, I could easily do that and take no position. However, this is directly for the permabears in this sub.

And the reason I care enough to post is — the market is a collection of people, if everyone thought BTC was going to $1, and I said it’s not, it would still definitely go to $1 because of the prevailing consensus. Self-fulfilling prophecy. 
We went up for five weeks straight. A retrace was inevitable. Not saying it can't go down more, but the double bottom gave investors more confidence in the market, so going that low again seems less likely.
1 month of a bull market? Wtf are you even looking at — were you even hear before 2018?
What happened to Bitcoin Legacy?

It's funny how people say there is so much "good news", but they fail to mention all the bad news, which is 10x worse, imo.  Probably well over half the world cannot even buy BTC legally now and it is only going to get worse.  

Gov'ts are killing crypto and most everyone in this sub is in denial about it.  They are winning the battles..they are winning the war.  
>the news seems to follow the price.

This is pure insanity... this is like saying the opinion results follow the polls. Which in some cases, can be true (see: Trump’s election). So, if we take that nuanced position, how about we stop being permabears every time BTC drops since it creates a compounding effect? 
You are correct. So I will say I think we're going to drop farther than 6K this time. Mid 4's is my guesstimate. 
Perhaps to prevent some suicides...or at least delay them for a few more weeks.
I agree with you for the most part.

But let's not pretend that EVERYONE doesn't talk their book, ha.
What about the folk who are sure btc will go to <$3k or even $0, they talk their book every drop that happens. Saying the price might keep dropping every time it drops is as useful as saying the price might keep rising every time it rises. People who are short talk their book, people who are long talk their book. Big players have other people and even media outlets talk their book. Assume everyone is trying to make you do something that benifits them first and formost and if you are lucky doesn't harm you.
Wow, did I offend your imaginary lines? I’m not even a fan of BTC, just sick of these never-satisfied permabears who permeate thought the entire space with their bogus TA analysis.
Those are two entirely different things and not even comparable to what I said. 
Yes, I can’t accept it which is why I’ve been holding in a crypto-bear market for the past four months. 

But now the real decline begins, no? 
BTC is like the crypto-index. It’s usefulness as a currency is long gone, which is why I’m a skeptic. However, it could survive in this form... who knows. 
Gates bro. I'm telling ya. ^^/s
it's pointless, if we go down to 100$ for 10 years and then back to 21k he will still say the same things at every green and in the end he will say he was right. Check his history.
What bear market?  You mean a little dip over a few days?  You must be new at this because in my experience, a 9% two-day dip is just an opportunity to take money from a bearwhale.
We're still up 50% from the February high and 30% up over the past month.  There never was a "bear market," just a childish outburst by somebody with a lot more money than brains (Buffett? Gates?).
Which part do you find funny and why?
well, EOS pumps follow a mechanic of their own, mostly because the team has about 1 billion USD warchest for just such occasions...
Sure it's very likely to be a deadcat bounce (my short from 9.8k is still open) but it's almost a guarantee to rally to 8800 at some point and maybe higher. Why not go long? We could even meander between 8200 and 8800 for an entire week because of the insane move we had in a couple days. 
So it's straight down to $3k Bitcoin where everyone sells their worldly possessions and goes 500x long?  Why doesn't everyone trade when it's so easy?
The FUD could only run for this far... It's not a perpetual self sustaining machine...
Nice
I would say that is also fair.
Exactly. And so was 20k. Bitcoin is pretty much for degenerate gamblers at this point in time. Unless you're just tucking it away into cold storage. 
That's a fair opinion. Where do you see it going? Do you see lower than $6k we hit?
Maybe, maybe not :-) Depends on whether you believe the "cup and handle" or the "bear market" story... I think most people here agree that we will see an extended bear market at some point - there is just disagreement whether this point is now. I am in the "cup and handle" camp right now but I have often been wrong in the past ;-)
That's fair.
I agree with him but disagree with you.
No, my opinion is as good as the lines you guys draw on the charts that are never right, unless you draw them after it moves.
We can all draw random lines on a chart to fit the narrative.
So technical analysis is "the actual reason" while fundementals that he said in the original comment are not. Just wow
just a few more months...
Exactly. A lot of people don't remember or werent here for the 2014 bear market. We had bullish headline after bullish headline and yet the price tanked. 

We had ["Microsoft accepts bitcoin"](https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/11/7375771/microsoft-supports-bitcoin-payments), [Expedia](https://mashable.com/2014/06/11/expedia-accepts-bitcoin/#nF006gyoa8qw), Newegg, PayPal/Braintree, Steam, Shopify, Adyen (payment processor for almost every major tech company), etc etc etc. 

It was practically a meme that good news = price drop. Probably the most bullish year in crypto's history too. Saw more headlines this year about people removing bitcoin than accepting it. And yet people think some random conference is going to raise the price. lmfao
I agree. I was just saying that people don't know when to gamble, how much to risk, or when to cut it loose and it leads to these cascading liquidations (in both directions). I'm completely shocked we're down $1500 and we're still not losing longs. I'm just waiting for the carnage.
yeah I jumped in at 8240 but closed 8500 when it start to roll back over. That was a pretty pathetic bounce for being at 20 on the 4hr RSI. I guess we could double bottom here but we have no short fuel to burn and every bounce back up is low volume buys and high volume sells. If that 7800-8000 zone goes....oh boy.
It's simply because longs can hold longer and shorts aren't afforded that luxury (because historically BTC is on a massive bull run and longs win in the waiting game).  

I believe some longs will begin to capitulate/close if we move down towards $7k however

Staying out of the position means being short 1x right? So that we can increase short on a bounce to say x2 or x5? Right? Sorry i am new to this game.

> we are out of buyers.

No buyers left as said. RSI was a poor indicator in the last few hours due to this. This bounce was expected. Now the money maker question is to either wait for it to climb and short or take the risk and go long here and short the last wick of the bounce (if theres any)?
Thanks mate. That sounds reasonable :) 
game over imo

Sure, contrarian argument bla bla, but 10k was very important, 9200 was very important and just now 8500 was very fucking important. If 8200 falls, BTC kaput
I love bear hunting. The more elusive and ferocious the big game is, the more exciting and invigorating the hunting process will be.
Thanks!
Thanks!
I'm going to choose not to trust this.
I come here for my confirmation bias.
Yes, wait and see wtf the direction is first. I got lucky and todays pump triggered all my stops and I ended up in profit.

I'd like to go back in but I'll sit this one out. Too uncertain.
Except that isn't quite comparable is it.....

If you're too dumb to see what was clear months ago then that's unfortunate.  It's been clear since January.

If you're talking about finex, shorts have been covering the whole time.
It looks more like a descending channel to me, but I never drew the bottom line for whatever reason.
Yes- what people don't realize is that its incredibly easy to make money during a bull-market. Even bad traders can make a killing. On the flip side, making winning trades in a downturn is what separates REALLY good traders from everyone else. You can surmise that REALLY good traders are far and few...
Wonder what they’re up to 
I'm not a permabear. I don't even short. But I'm not going to hold before a massive drop and then cry about the loss either. I sold 70% of my holdings on the 8th when it was apparent this was a major event. I plan to buy back in when the buy signal is seen.  My TA actually said to [sell on the 24th](https://www.tradingview.com/x/7qLybucK/), but I ignored it because it is premature on sell recommendations as the market goes up.

No buy signal yet, but I see people posting about taking out longs when we're in another expected uptick that will drop again. Downvote and long if you want. 
>Wtf is a hedge long?

A hedge short locks in the fiat value of your coins. A hedge long locks in the bitcoin value of your fiat.

Hold fiat, long bitcoin. 
short from 9350 on one account and long 8240 on another.
bullish on being bearish
Unfortunately it can..just like it soared down to $6K the first time, from much, much higher up.
I expect a bounce off 7800 but I definitely feel like it will collapse if we go that far. 
... :'(
lol
its more of a technical bounce for now

If it blows through 8200 next time around, the whole thing is a DCB
yep
5 in a row I believe. Which is why I don’t *necessarily* believe it’s all doom and gloom quite yet. If we can consolidate and hold the 7.8-8.2 range that would leave room for some bullish potential. The run from 6.8 was pretty much straight up and a pullback was inevitable at some point. This is a pretty severe drop, but I still think it’s too early to call it one way or the other. 

Edit: spelling
Thanks for the tip :)

> I know a lot of mega rich people. They are the most boring people on the planet.

Many are often bloody miserable too ... in my late 20's I spent several weeks with one of the top 50 and dude was the most upset, obsessive, alone and despondent individuals I've ever met.  I actually felt really bad for him.  It really drove home the notion that money doesn't buy happiness.
Yes, knowledge is worth more than money. And most mega rich people are also very knowledgable and intelligent. So I don't really understand your comparison. You can be wealthy and knowledgable.

I rather not live off 20 dollars a day in the society I live in, especially not doing anything for someone else (unless charity, of course - mainly referring to capitalist environment) - or even worse, something I dislike. People who are in a bad financial position usually don't have the freedom to choose something they love; most of them have to take shitty jobs paying even shittier.

Also, everyone is boring to someone. What you might consider boring might not be boring to someone else; those mega rich might be enjoying themselves for all you/i/we know. Personally, I dislike coding, hate a lot of modern music (rap, metal, etc.) so "hip" is not really my thing. "Hip" is boring to me, while I am most definitely a boring person to someone who is "hip". You get what I am trying to say? It's all subjective.

good effort post but he threw in troll-ball. 
I don't get why people are downvoting me for this. That's just what I call it. It rolls off the tongue a lot easier than just Bitcoin. Do people really care that much? Did people even read the substance of my comment? 
I love you both
Also “wankfest” and the smug and arrogant attitude. It’s quite possible he just is a gigantic cock.
I'm really blown away by this. 

There isn't a crazy high number of longs open. There's just a crazy low number of shorts open.
if they panic sold then they arent hodlers.
Thanks! Yea I suspected I can do this from what I've read on this sub, so decided to ask. New question - could somebody ELI5 for me how to open a BTC margin long using BTC as a collateral on Bitfinex? Thanks guys.
It looks better. I like it more.
the shorts get to have more fun than longs.  Longs get one huge green dildo,  either get lucky or gtfo.  Shorts just keep shorting every green candle and push it down until long barf their bags up.   

at these levels, and after such a drop is it margin shorts pushing us down, or longs giving up ?

I think we will even put at 7.5k for the year. Based solely on the fact that itms about 50% of what I would call our ATH without a blow-off top. Moreover, we were at 15k on Jan 1 2018

Yes it’s arbitrary, and no I don’t care that that is dubious at best.

Ill be longing anything sub 7.5k aggressively

Good job on reducing your position. I failed to do so because I’m retarded
Chewy I love you man but your bot syntax is terrible :P

Obviously no need for alarm yet, but is the area of concern a higher high?

wow, you caught that wick? nice
!short XBTUSD 8400 10x 100%
How are you entering your positions on the June futures? Order books are so thin that throwing in a large sell order will typically drive the price down below the desired entry. Are you just putting in several small limit orders? Getting in and out of the June futures always felt cumbersome to me
Chewie, when you say you're short, how big is your short position in regard to your total bitcoin stack? I keep 10&#37; of my stack on bitmex and trade it with 1x leverage, however, I think it would be better if I increased my leverage when I short to protect more &#37; of my stack.
There are a lot more indicators to look at than just the shorts vs longs which really doesn't back test very well for bitcoin. Explain  2017 based on shorts vs longs.
you didnt get the message from justanotherlogin

There was info about PMs

You're the man! Not only a good trader but also a great human being :D

Sometimes, when I'm stuck with an underwater position, I place a sell order and sleep, hoping that the price goes through that number at some point..
Red?

Went sleep, woke up, went shopping, look at chart, I'm green, that's good ;-)
~8650 now. It was the floor of our previous trading range so makes sense to sell there. Since 12hr RSI kissed oversold, I'm anticipating this bounce to last a couple of days, would you agree? 

1D 200ema is righat around 8800 so I'm hoping we get there.
Shorting here with stops above $8,700 wouldn't be a terrible idea. 

Personally, I'm close to cutting my long loose. 
I've adopted a similar rule recently of sitting out after making a good trade. That being said, I'm very tempted to reshort here, will maybe wait to see if we get back above 8.5/8.6 again though.
How much does someone have to throw around to see noticeable slippage?

Not asking about the size of your stack specifically, but as a minnow I don't know if we're talking 20 btc or 200 or what. Curious.

That question is so utterly clueless about the very basics of trading and speculation.

Let me give you a hint:  The goal is to have more money after the trade than before.
You're calling it a little early.

Pennant needs to play out and break out.
unless money is entering the market, it really is a zero sum game
Don’t believe what people say. Take a trading book. Study relentlessly. Do fundamental analysis. But don’t just try to skim the subs for tips because you will be outsmarted by people who do put in lots of energy. Anyway, to have tethered is not such a stupid thing. At least you have cash now. 
He’s not learning how to trade tho. He literally made a decision because people told him to. 

Perfect example of someone who will lose everything unless he hodls.

Fitting name btw
I disagree

The whole point of a blockchain is that it is public

The only honest use cases for private transactions I know of are:

When you pay someone, they don’t know how
many funds you have

When you pay someone and subsequently get raided, the raiders don’t know who you paid and how much

AFAIK everything else is just beneficial to illicit activity, esp. crime
> a noob trader who got lucky buying in early in bitcoin deciding to cash out without affecting the market too much

Its so nice of the noob lol.

Ah it all makes sense now. Thank you for sharing
How does it compare to the "Cyprus" pump in early 2013 up to the Nov 2013 bullrun?

e: this would match up the recent run to $20k to the Cyprus pump, and the Nov pump to whatever follows from here
I don't follow this at all, the trend seems transparent:

Market peaks at an absurd value, it must then fall back down. Every step of the way down there will be bounces that fail.

5800, all time vol after huge fall always sparks a 100%+ run. Of course it's a trap and after making an attempt up it fails.

6400, could have been 5500 or 7000. Either way another bounce that will fail lower and then drop.

Each of these shakes out more traders as they become disillusioned with the runs failing. This process continues as everyone either sells or accepts they will hold to the bottom. 
If we break down from that, it basically means prepare for the multi year bear market, right?

This is what I'm thinking. Yesterday, I tethered some BTC, a lot of ETH and all of my alts except two (tbh, most were automatic via stop limits which sold at ~1% discount to market). When this market dumps, it dumps violently. Multiple 4h red candles means we're in for short-term correction, likely to low-mid $7k range.
Your username matches your comment perfectly.
I think that is probably true. I don't think it will pass the log resistance but if it does I think 6k falls. I am leaning towards thinking a bounce off of 7.2k followed by a further descent to 6.4k and then a rebound. 
Canceled my limit buy at $8228.82 before going to bed on GDAX because it felt arbitrary. I know the feeling.
You need to issue an **add** command (! short xbtusd **add** 8200 30% for example) and it should update your avg value, the opening value will always be the same.

You only know bitfinex longs and shorts. Bitmex doesn't share that data. Funding was indeed rediculous on bitmex the last few weeks
Funding is negligible if you take a 20+ percent profit over the course of several days or even a week or longer.
Gotcha. I'm already long with a small % but not super confident. 
I mean triangle?
There is at least 50% chance of $6K breaking in the next couple of years.

People here grossly underestimate the occurrence of bad news that pounds the price lower.  And also increasingly draconian regulation that cuts down on BTC demand and buying.
Anyone who says a future price is 100% likely is a moron.  Every price is possible...every price has a non 0% probability.

$6K is orders of magnitude more likely than $0.10, at least in a time frame of the next year or two.


Hm are you sure? I just tried on testnet, increasing leverage on a position adds to my available balance.

OHH I think you're confused. You want to increase your position size? 

Do you want to increase the size of your short?

We were in full-blown bubble mode. Everyone could make money by longing just because of the insane amount of new money pouring in and a greedy reluctance to sell. Trading a bear/sideways market isn't that easy.

People longing in 2018 while thinking about 2017 are going to lose money to the traders willing to flip a 10-20% gain.
What makes Bitcoin a great store of value? And what are the unethical practices that the open-source, leaderless, highly decentralized protocol and cryptocurrency known as bitcoin cash partakes in?
Oh sorry I meant as in multiple groups. Most people here will follow three to four traders max anyway. Chewtoy will have the most followers. So say we create a group called chewtoy. Those people would follow only that group.
I also am short from here and added to my position. Feels maybe a bit reckless because it could still flag up to 8700/8800. I set stops above 8.8.

I am also planning to reduce the position I just put in if it breaks back up out of the triangle.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/7ebDfsgu/


I’m sticking with the plan and keeping my stops around 8650. We broke down from the symmetrical triangle and yet didn’t crash down but any attempt to the upside has failed. I just had two double IPAs so I’m not making decisions right now. 
Same here, I'm a bit above b-e but wouldn't mind closing it for a tiny loss here - I'm over-leveraged and just won't be able to sleep. The fact that we've broken down from 8.5 has me optimistic but the chop today has been very stressful. I added to my short at one point and closed the portion I added at a loss only for us to come back down so I'm definitely in a bad mood and skittish. It feels like we're starting to bang our heads against some resistance a bit so I'm going to try to stay awake and see this out, I'm hoping there's a move down right around the corner. I'd consider closing it at 8450 for a small loss - I think that would signal a bigger move upward to test 8.5/8.6 again, at which point I don't care to deal with the stress a second time, especially if we were to break out to the upside instead of coming back down.
Was expecting that too but I don't think it'll be long. Just the rejected support turned resistance.
You want to add to your position i believe, you can't have 2 positions for the same Type/Pair.

Close it at $8,301 and open a long. It will bounce from there a little bit so you can close the long and reopen another short. Keep repeating until there is no bounce at the said price or if the price starts heading upwards for a while.
I'm not about to jump into another fingers-crossed long.

But yeah I'm tempted too.

>Ragequit would be shorting now, no?

No, that would still be trading and playing the game. Closing a losing position and saying "I'm done with this shit" is more of a ragequit.

thats always the case in consolidation area.
It's a theory. There might be, there might not. The price is caught in a range, but who knows what's going on. I know a lot of traders expect the 50-day MA to offer support, and it should be around 8250 now.
I have it at $8,340. 
Bullish doesn't mean the price is going up- by that I mean that traders/investors expect the price to eventually go up/turn around.
Funding rate on bitmex is based on how far the index price is from mark price. Mark price is a combination of gdax+bitstamp. 

When bitfinex was pushing $9k+ gdax was $50-80 below bitfinex; since bitmex traders follow bitfinex, swaps were consistently above mark price and thus the funding rate was in favor of shorts. Now that gdax is slightly ahead of bitfinex, the funding is in favor of longs because bitmex swaps are slightly below mark.

Probably no, depends if there is total panic at that point. In March there wasn't. Great place to buy but how many will buy there because of all this? There would be the natural place for a real bounce.
Good point.
yea 1d isnt even close to oversold, but I see your point
9 character sentence?? 
BUILD THAT WALL
I’m not sure if you can consider this a dip ... this is straight up savage.
No clue.

I mean, I said a few days ago that I thought 7500 was a “good”/“fair” price for Bitcoin. I can imagine we go back to 7500
Is that a double black diamond or blue square ? 

*shred it, bruh*
*bah gawd*

limit orders placed accordingly
Plenty but can't list a single one that isn't a speculative boogie man? I think this is an important distinction because you could literally apply speculative boogie man to any investment and use it to justify a bear position but it really doesn't exist outside your imagination.
its coming in, but the great part of it is headed straight away to shitcoins, or to FX gambles. Look at the volume rises on all alts and FXs from 1-2 yrs ago. That's why for any whale today BTC/fiat is so easy to take down (and up). That's where all the new money are flowing to. Into pockets of hedgefunds, institutionals, big traders. Just like in commodities. Maybe it will shift dynamic if the next financial crisis hits, but we're in the swamps at present with BTC spot being blown with the wind of the larger fiat casinos.

and there's a larger probability than ever that he will sell at $4-5k instead of $10-12k like he easily could have.

Man imagine watching your portfolio go from 1000% to 200% without doing anything about it
How about this, lets say he decides to listen to me and sell at $8,350 and go into fiat. 

The probability is high that we will retest our bottom or perhaps go even lower at say $5,000 before a bounce (trust me or not, but the chances are high some are even saying $3,000 but I am being reasonable). 

He can then re-buy the same amount of coins for a 40% reduced price and still have BTC in his holdings. In simpler words. If he sell 1 BTC now and re-buy at $5,000, he will have 1.6 BTC instead of 1 BTC he is currently HODLing. I m not taking $10,000 into consideration as that is out of the picture for now both short and medium term!

I hope you understand what I am trying to clearly say! 
sorry. Rip me. The day before my portfolio was down 14&#37; and today i see another down 10&#37;. how loooonggg can this go on
You don’t know for a fact that that’s the case, but if it is, I absolutely agree with you
We all make mistakes. If you’re high leverage try and close with a minimal loss. We are not that far from 8.4 

I am sticking to my plan of adding on the way down.
Listen, no one likes scalping. Everyone wants to get in on the ground floor of a good long-term trade. In hindsight yes you could've closed but don't beat yourself up, there's no way to know. Just consider adjusting your strategy with regards to stops (ie break even or not) and points where you're comfortable taking profits. And then stick to the plan ;)
https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZIG7u4jM/

That’s what a text book double bottom would look like. 

If we broke through the purple line, we should see a test of 8.8k. 

Sure, 8.9k would be comfortable but if you’re talking about the technicals behind a double bottom, $8,650 break would be confirmation 
Because a double bottom confirms when it passes through the neckline, which is at 8.6x.
Why don't you ask it to the person who said it? I am just trying to fit in with the crowd. I have said it on more than one occasions that I am not your regular TA guy, I can't even draw a line (other than the one I cut on the mirrors. lol.)

Talking about comfort, I feel quite comfortable with my long from $8,375 at the moment.
We aren't allowed to ask questions huh?

If Bitcoin's price can be substantially affected by one subreddit, well, then it's fucked anyway. 
Yes, you know how the price went up 50% in one month? That’s a bull market. 

And if you have to ask that it’s obvious you are the new one here. 
I mean I've certainly written some lengthy rants that exude hopium and dedication to the cause. The difference is that those rants are always formatted as "here are some reasons that one might be bullish across various time frames", not "the bottom is definitely in, the price is definitely going up, etc."

My rants are simply playing devil's advocate to bears. Worshipping projected price movements is kinda dumb to begin with (especially in the current climate). You'd be much better off understanding the tech and economics as best as possible, which can inform cautious optimism or pessimism.
I wouldn't say that's true. Certainly we haven't seen that in Western democracies. Also, banning exchanges is not the same thing as banning Bitcoin Orthodox and it's not too hard to circumvent a ban if you really need or want to. 

Also, it's much more important to see what happens in the West than what happens in the East. Most knew that China was not going to sit around and do nothing.
You would think so but IME that's not the case. 2013 happened on good news. 2017 had plenty of bad news but bitcoin kept going up, the end of 2017 there was a huge amount of great news and yet we've retraced the majority of that move. You could ask the same about the move up. What is fundamentally different between btc at 200 and 20K. Was the whole move up justified? A 100x move from top to bottom will likely take a long time to cool off no matter how great the news is even if you think that the current prices reflect what BTC is actually worth.

My comment was intented for the HODL-book.
Ideally here in this sub, everybody gives TA reasons for their book here, not fundamental ones. That is what the sub is for. 
uh huh...
Sorry, but the decline from $20,000 to $8300 was "real" as well.  

And any further price declines from here will be all too real.  And fundamentals are getting worse, not better, with crypto.


To be honest though, every time the twins challenge someone to short the price does go to shit pretty soon after. 
We're less than 6 months away from the bubble popping. The 2013 crash took 17 months to fully unwind and retest the bottom before it started to climb again.

Saying there was never a bear market, this soon after a bubble ... you crack me up.
We just came down almost 20% without taking a breath. Obviously the price was inflated. Why on earth would it completely turn again in a very short timeframe? 
All parts because I can lol.
That there is no bearish case to be made right now.
The part where you say 'BGD towers over the LRD'... Did you look at the daily chart?
Yeah I know EOS gets their own weirdass pumps, but the long to short ratio is absolutely retarded, and 200million USD worth of longs is a *lot* -- not to mention that there's already been a massive amount of them liquidated, both on Bitfinex and OKex, meaning there was a huge amount of supply released quickly over the last couple days, so there's bound to be fewer buyers than normal for a while, right. 

edit: I do agree that we're likely to see a good pump for Consensus, though. Heck, for all I know this entire push down on BTC has been engineered to destroy alt prices and load the fuck up ahead of the big announcements and hype. 
>but it's almost a guarantee to rally to 8800 at some point and maybe higher

How is it "almost a guarantee" exactly? It isn't, at all.  

*Edit:  And as expected...now we laugh
Because if it does get there most people will shit their pants...

I hope we consolidate the next 3-5 months around 5-9k. I don't know how deep it can go or will.
My main indicator is the society (co-worker, friends, family aso.) and they are not interested in crypto right now (I don't care about the fomo-news on reddit/twitter). Some of them fomo'd in the december peak and got heavily burned. I can't see them invest again anytime soon. The worst case is: We will not see a new ATH this year.
I couldn’t fail to disagree less. 
Fine by me, I'm not in any rush. 
If you're on margin you don't really have the luxury of time when the price is moving away from you. Spot buyers are the ones that can hold through downturns.
!long ethusd add 636 8%
We've only hit $6k once this year. Also, to bounce off $6k we'd first have to get there first, no?
Nor does blind optimism.
Maybe I should sell half of my position around 8600. Thank you bro
Lol. Thanks
I'm implying that the bear market isn't anywhere near finished with us and that dreams of over 10k are a distant hope for now 
yes short 1x is flat if you're on bitmex.
yep, it's never going to see another high.

totally. over.

thank you, l14dy, for your exceptional insight.
Lol yep your right. BTC is dead... again 
You're not in a good mood today.
Lol well I don't know about kaput, but yes it won't look good. There is still the off chance we triple/W bottom off $6k or something and go buckwild
I've gone bearish too i hope consensus can rev up bitcoin a little.  Seems to be no interest putting $$ at these prices.
It's just whales stophunting each other now.  That bounce up was weak.



Because you are such a big Bull
Come get me!!

honestly at this price spread between finex/gdax you'll get me through funding rates...
Expensive hobby.
'Enjoy holding your increasingly heavy bags though :)'

Posted by just about every single lunch money shorter in this sub. Amaze us and post trade history of your January short, put your money where your mouth is like u/fuckharvey. 
Thanks! I learned a new term :)
Probably just screwing with trading bots to fill limit sells
Brian Armstrong, in his office, lights are dimmed. He’s drenched in sweat, simultaneously on a tense teleconference call with the Winklevii, and feverishly clicking buttons on his own exchange. 

In front of him, a flashing cell phone vibrates and pauses, vibrates and pauses. Its drunken-stumble across his mahogany desk produces the kind of low-key, agitated rumbling sound that makes someone realize—prior to answering or indeed even knowing who it is —that it’s clear that the caller is very, very mad. 

It took days with bumps (bounces) along the way.
Bounces have been very weak and reversing quickly for the most part.
Ya, I mean 2 weeks ago I said a pullback to $7.8 really wouldn't be the worst thing in the world. The only reason I think it's bearish is because the market overextended itself too far and set itself up for a very clear and intense rejection and it's disheartening. There should have been a pullback earlier- now people are underwater and will possibly close at a loss before letting the market move upwards
Still got a month yet then
McAfee is gonna pull a Marilyn Manson.
To be fair we do have about 3 weeks left.

/s
lol I just like to be sarcastic sometimes. the fact that my comment isn't immediately disregarded as ridiculous to people is sad 😅
I know a billionaire. He is a really great guy. Turned a couple measley 100million into a multi billion dollar empire.

His kids are the saddest people I’ve ever met
I guess I’m talking about mega rich people that inherited their money
Gypsy are you okay? You haven’t been too well these past few days.
without that word "Conventional", it'd have been an excellent article.
The word chode is less offensive 
too much gayness here
I really think the BGD has scared tons of people off from shorting. but this whole thing has been wild though, we've been dumping with shorts closing. People are taking profits earlier this time, guess they wanna be safe 
the market was making an exponential graph to $18k and now its making its way back to $1k. We have see 3 small spikes in price but the downtrend is continuing. Do you think we will touch $1k by the end of the year?
>Thanks! Yea I suspected I can do this from what I've read on this sub, so decided to ask. New question - could somebody ELI5 for me how to open a margin long using BTC on Bitfinex? Thanks guys.

Do you have a specific question? This is really coming off like a RTFM situation. If you can't or won't read the numerous tutorials and guides out there, you will likely lose your money.

 Margin trading is not something you should figure out as you go along, expecting reddit to provide you with all of the research and risk management. 
Move BTC into your margin wallet as collateral. Pull up BTCUSD, navigate to margin tab, enter your buy order.
Nope. He especially can't, he got in a shit ton of trouble for the sell off earlier this year from the bankruptcy court. If anything the way he handled it will make it more likely for the rest of the btc to be distributed instead of sold to maintain the value of the plaintiffs holdings. Even if it is distributed I imagine a large % will still be sold off- but at least it will be more organic than one huge douche doing it.
Mt gox has court orders against selling any more bitcoin, anything implying he is about to crash the market is fake news/fud meant to push down the price for the writers benefit(even if just for increased views) or whoever hired them to spread the fuds benefit. I expect the price to dip in september before the meeting to decide what to do with the funds. Until then they are basically locked.
I've noticed the none of the calls or puts on LedgerX have been below $5000 all year. Is that anything a layman like myself can read into?
I’m curious to see where we’ll end up in mid/end of summer, and if we do follow the 2014 pattern, what the low now would look like. Im targeting anything sub 7k as undervalued, also because mining costs should be somewhere around that point. 

Did you have fun at the club last night at least? 
It is terrible. I tried to update it. I'm 10x short at the moment. 
Anything above $8,650 would be concerning, yes. 
I'm 10x short with 10% of my total BTC. 

So I'm effectively 100% in fiat.
2017 was the beginning of the bull run. the mania is ending not beginning again 
I have no idea what you are talking about.
I calculated 4.638. (8840 - 8430)/8840.
The leverage doesn't matter in the pnl.

I very nearly re-opened a few minutes ago at 8610 (Jun), but hesitated. I'm going to go take a shower and have some coffee and re-evaluate when I come back. 
On June futures, noticeable slippage comes into play around a 10BTC position (contract size). It depends on what's happening in the market most of the time, though. Mine hit on that 3% candle, so I felt it worse than usual. Yesterday on the drop from 9400 I only had $9 of slippage. 

On September futures, liquidity is even lower and I'd be wary to open anything over 5 BTC on that if I was planning to use market stops.
That's another great entry. I'd be tempted to set stops in some profit (8330ish), but there's definitely merit to letting it ride. It seems plausible that if we get back below 8350, this was just a big DCB and you'll get stopped anyway. That said, a bounce off 8300 would make a higher low and having stops under 8300 makes a lot of sense technically. 
Position saved with success.

Open positions can be checked @ [BitcoinMarkets Open Positions](http://bitcoinmarkets.atwebpages.com/)


Market will bounce. Problem is people buy into shorts or move into fiat because of FUD/sell pressure. Thing is no matter what the chart will chart. 
Right, but on a huge scale.  We are individually small cogs, so it doesn't matter if we help eachother.
Depends if he wants to learn and what percentage of his stack he put into it.  Can't fix stupid, but we should try to help people learn what the sub is about
So in other words: most transactions
It's not just "how many funds you have", they can then see your entire history of transactions you have ever made, to which wallets, the amounts, the dates and times. And cryptos which are not private are not fungible but I won't go into that now.
Yea i agree. just meant since January there's no real "trend" that you can just sit and hold and make money for. In the end it will go down imo
It already says I'm at 100%, but I increased leverage to add margin. The position got stopped out anyway, so I just need to update it to 8830 CA and 8440 close haha
Y'all just posted the same chart
Almost closed my long with a loss couple minutes ago, now thinking if I should go for be and flip to short or let it ride
Probably.
I want to increase leverage. From what i understand right now i am using my own xbt 0.21 at 1x. But i want to increase to 3x to borrow from the exchange. I would expect to be able to use 3 x 0.21 = 0.63xbt. To buy these coins back at the lower price and return 2 x 21 = 42xbt to exchange. 
Why would people go all in? After reading this sub all day, it seems everyone to me is pretty bearish and expecting a drop to 7k. This is coming from a a newby blonde girl. I’m searching for an exit point after buying back in this morning before we tank. 💁🏼‍♀️ 
When you finally do something right, eh?
Breaking up out of this symmetrical triangle (breakout point would be under 10k) would be very bullish, and could overcome 10k resistance if the move has enough volume and "sponsorship" behind it. 
It was just a joke, but if you want to play, Bitcoin is a great store of value because there are a limited value of coins beyond which more cannot be created, meaning once adopted on a large scale the value of your holdings would be expected to rise as coins are lost, population increases etc, and unlike some other stores of value, it is robust and not subject to deteriation of any kind over time. It is also very secure when used correctly. 

BCH is unethical because it is founded on fraud and misconception. But again, I was just mostly making a joke.

You disagree, I assume?
We might have a bit more room on [the 1H](https://www.tradingview.com/x/3nTOSnlD/)
No, they're different pairs. I can see xbtu18 but not xbtm18. I replied to the same comment to open both positions here. 
!long xbtm18 close 8400
Yea 9300 is an extreme if it happens today, a 2-standard deviation move. Maybe need a few days.
Agreed. Wish I had gotten in at 8.5, would've been a bit comfier - or still had last night's short open, pretty bitter about getting stopped out on that one. Oh well. I can't imagine how comfy the people who shorted 9.9 are right now.  

If this position doesn't work out I think I'll sit out until we definitively break 8.2 or break above 9.
Ok, then yes, I ragequit. But the price is now under my sell price.

I closed my position because that was my plan. Set alarms for 8250 and closed a little above that.
thanks man! You’ll make it abck. I’ve always made it back one way or another. Mostly just pissed off that I shorted at 8200 and covered at 8820 a couple weeks ago and yesterday longed at 8800 and closed at 8250-ish

Those trades are backwards
!short btcusd -sl 8601
Of course nothing is a sure thing. But pointing out opportunities is what we do here. And with every touch the odds get better and better that it will break.
I did cut off a little bit of wick on some candles to make it fit better. Maybe that's why yours is higher.

Edit: You are also using stamp for charting right? I use finex.

Edit2: https://www.tradingview.com/x/K7m8GUDn/ to clarify how I drew it.
[deleted]
My understanding was that the premium is calculated as a way to regulate how far bitmex price was off the midpoint of (gdax + bitstamp), not related to bfx.
And the index price is dependent on the shorting/selling vs buying/covering on BitMEX.

So perhaps it is not a direct translation of longs vs. shorts, but suppose it is still mostly affected by that.  It is obviously not a coincidence that during bull market, funding is positive for shorts, and during bear market, it is negative for shorts.

I admittedly don't understand the fine details, but that much is clear.
Not arguing that TA is useful. My point is that many here use TA as an indicator for everything, like when calls for 3k btc was all over the place. 
When are you targeting to get back in. $5ish? Or wait and see? 
Save me your condescending tone. I'm talking about the comments that come off as "crypto is dead" and "we're going to goblin town", not that those that trade based on their own principles. 
Then we can use Bitcoin to buy houses. Adoption!
You edited your comment, now it looks like I can’t count. 

You’re not kidding.  Going to be a lot of people licking their wounds when they wake up tomorrow
okay you're right it's 100% guaranteed to go up. everyone selling is just giving away free money 
What’s causing the fire, though? 
>and there's a larger probability than ever that he will sell at $4-5k instead of $10-12k like he easily could have

Says you. That guy either bought the big dump from 3k to 1.8k, or held through it.
I understand what you’re trying to say, but you are making some whopping assumptions about where the market is headed.

You’re clearly bearish short and medium term, but others aren’t, him being bullish obviously. Everyone here is not convinced we hit 5k any time soon. You’re letting your own biases drive your own confidence to a point that is not reasonable or clearly shown by the available evidence.
You'll manage buddy. Everyone has shitty days. And we ready for a bounce here.
Thanks! :)
[deleted]
Who said that? I'm just telling you not to short it based on what some random person tells you. A few days ago I was reading a post here and I got to the end of it and he said his entire stack was $100. You don't know if the person you're reading is a highschool kid or a stock pro.

> Certainly we haven't seen that in Western democracies. 

We have seen that in most of the world.  And it is illegal to buy BTC in Western democracies now without going through KYC/AML.  

>  it's not too hard to circumvent a ban if you really need or want to.

You are wrong.  It cuts down on demand, tremendously.

>it's much more important to see what happens in the West.

No, China and India have 3 billion people between them.  That is important and not less important than the West.

You are trying way too hard with your rationalizations.  Anyone who says "China doesn't matter" is showing their bias very clearly and that they live in a deluded fantasy world.

Anything could happen honestly. A good piece of FUD and we will see 6K in a day or two. Something revolutionary and we will see 10k in three or four days. 
> And fundamentals are getting worse, not better, with crypto.

The fuck, based on literally what? 

And don’t talk about BTC, you said crypto in general. 
That wasn't a bubble.  That was just Bitcoin flexing its muscles.  People were calling it a bubble at $5k last year.

There was never a bear market, just some idiots with too much money and a grudge against Bitcoin, combined with newb/weak hands in January.
If you look at HOW it came down, you'll see that i was artificial.  It will go right back up, just like it always does when some bearwhale gets this idea.

Bitcoin, taking money from stupid rich guys since 2014 &tm; !
Please, tell me what it is based on fundamentals, not magic lines you drew on some arbitrary period on the chart.
Right, but that weirdassness sometimes does a CPR on bitcoin (and the market) and get it going. I watch EOS charts closely for this purpose.
Because assets retrace about halfway of every move at some point. It can more or less, but it always retraces. 

8.2k is about a 50% retrace from 6.5k to 9.9k. 

8.6k was about a 50% retrace from 7.8k to 9.7k.

9.4k was about a 50% retrace from 9.9k to 9k.

It's an easy rule of thumb, basically the same as fibonacci rules but that's too much hindsight analysing for me to really useful. 
Only the weak.  And for every bubble new hodlers are born, with adamantium hands.
Okay, we shall see whether it's a dead cat bounce or not... Next 5-6 hours we shall know the answer.
Fully agree with the public around us being a good indicator etc. I think we fundamentally agree on a lot of stuff. I just think that IF we rise to somewhere around 13-14k soon then the pace will pick up and above 20k all the previously burnt guys and gals are gonna hop back on - until the handle implodes into a real bear market
!short XBTUSD profit 9200 8%
Yes, but you can't deny the facts : if we go under 6k, the price will be lower than 6k.
>We've only hit $6k once this year

We hit it 3x, but I count the Eve as 1 because it doesn't touch on all exchanges: https://www.tradingview.com/x/2Yn7hC6F/

> Also, to bounce off $6k we'd first have to get there first, no?

 What do you think is happening [right now] (https://i.imgur.com/xSxXQ97.jpg)? I can't tell if this drop will be the one to test it, but it could be.

It's better for us if we test it sooner, than later. Because that line is rising, and soon it will be a 7k floor we won't want to go below.
6.5k first, then it's quite new territory if we exclude the mentioned 6k in feb.
Yeah, buy support, sell resistance. I don't think we fly back to 10k. My bet is 8650-8700. IF we manage to break the resistance, we can go to around 8800 but that's it.


You're welcome 
Thanks mate :) 
Probability that BTC doesn't go over $20K in the next five years is well over 50%.  
I didnt say totally over. I said kaput, which means we will not see 10k this month or enxt imo.

I’m not calling for 1.5k
I dont mean dead. I just mean no significant upside for the month of may
Im in a great mood today. Eating steak
Yes it soared down in just a very few days.
Yes. It certainly has played out in a more bearish way. The action around $9.8k is also strikingly similar to what we saw at $11.8k. First attempt, swift rejection. Second attempt, a little more drawn out, lower volume, but then smack down below prior low on elevated volume. 
When I read it, I read it as in ForgetUsername guy, Bqtcc, and DushKush were saying it 
That sarcasm went right over the head of 90% of this sub. 
FWIW I downvoted it. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
Yes often the kids are fucked because they're born on home plate and have no real pressing challenges foisted upon them by life circumstances which helps to make a person sturdy and real. 

People who make it to the 0.001% of their own volition are often very .. weird in a way... totally obsessive and uniformly focused on money/acquisition/power.. and then work basically non-stop 120 hours a week ... they're wired a little differently I think.


Yes, I'm well. Thanks for asking! :)
What am I supposed to call it? Bitcoin Paleolithic? Bitcoin Bronze Age? 

What more do people want from me?
Noob here, what is BGD? 
Um, ok, well - I wanted some basic pointers on how to open a BTC margin long on Bitfinex using BTC as a collateral.  I've read the Bitfinex manual and no, it isn't very clear at all, so, as you say, I don't want to try and figure it out myself by trading and losing money. Also, as you are aware Bitfinex doesn't have a testnet like Bitmex does.

This reddit sub arguably is one of the best crypto trading resource on the net. Many people on here are very knowledgeable and experienced,  and I've learned  a lot from people here actually.

When I said I have a noobish question it was not an invitation to be snarky and patronising.
Thanks for that. If I have USD in my margin wallet as well as BTC, will I be opening a long on BTC with USD automatically? So if I want to use BTC as a collateral, I should only have BTC in my margin wallet? I couldn't see any information about this on Bitfinex that's why I am asking. 
I agree with you, but I don’t understand why coins are moving out of the wallet if they are locked?
Or it's just ill informed reporting, which happens regularly.

Not everything is a conspiracy to kill BTC. 
Hmmmm, never thought about that.

I think this would mean that institutional i vestors have done their due dilligence and do not believe sub 5k is in the cards, no?
very much so
Reply to this with ! short XBTUSD add 8400 9X 
How far do you see this dropping? Im still short from 8900, is 7800 on the cards in the next 48 hours?
Well I'm definitely regretting adding to my short at 8350 now!
This has been a remarkable amount of sideways just to end up right back on our entry.
Lol, I feel like we are back to square 1 from last night, Chewy.

Edit: btw I'm still holding on to my long, been a rollercoaster ride. I was playing in a golf tournament today, so I didn't sell in time despite you urging anyone following to take profit, lol.
Implying that shorts/longs is only a good indicator in a bear market? 
That sounds right. 
Thanks for explaining, big help. :)
Man that didn't last long.

!long xbtusd close 8388

At least got a tiny profit.
Yea, I didn't mean to imply otherwise, just being technically annoying
Sure but he at least needs to hodl until he’s proficient otherwise he will have nothing left to trade with.

I just don’t hold high hopes for anyone whose immediate reaction is to blindly do what other people tell him. Kinda the opposite of what makes a good trader. Even worse to complain about it afterwards when it doesn’t work out.
incorrect, just don’t reuse addresses.
?  Mine shows top broken... price still moving up...
Same bear flag, 2 different exchanges.

Finex generally leads the market so I draw on Finex. Finex is still bouncing within the flag and stamp broke though. 
Maybe let it ride and close between 8500-8650and start scaling into a short there? 

But... last thing u want is this to blast through 8650 and let a good position go down the drain 
So you want to short 0.63 BTC worth? Then you want to increase your position size, not leverage.

Leverage simply determines where your liquidation price point is, not how much money you make from price going up/down.

Look at your contract size on bitmex, tell me what that is.

You want to look at the "Value" part of the position on bitmex. If it says 0.21, then you have a 0.21 btc short currently open. If you awnt to change that to 0.63 btc then you need to add (or in this case, subtract, since you're short)

((0.63 - 0.21)*current price) contracts from your position.
what price did you buy-in?

You will probably be able to close at break even, but possibly the bottom will fall out.

If you can stomach a loss, I would close if we drop below 8200, otherwise I would hold and get out at break even.

Maybe thisgoes back to 9k
I was being snarky. If you read the last two days of daily discussions and you'll see dozens of people who were buying the dip and downvoting the comments about it being a bear market.

It's funny that people now think the posts are super bearish, they really aren't any more bearish than the last few days, it's just that the moon posts have gone down, and useful comments about actual market direction aren't being downvoted to oblivion. 

I made a post 4 days ago about it, and I ended up with -10 votes before I deleted it.

People forget this isn't like politics or sport teams, we aren't bears vs bulls. You aren't a traitor for recognizing that markets rise and fall. A smart investor is aware and responds accordingly to both.
FINALLY! Lost some on the way down. For once I timed the market right. yey!
Whats closer in your mind 8k or 9k?
[deleted]
> Bitcoin is a great store of value because there are a limited value of coins beyond which more cannot be created.

Except that it takes a few minutes to create a fork or start a new coin and people adopt these new coins all the time.  Isn't it also unethical to repeat all these cultisms that are not true?
That's the issue, it is assuming your main post as a link and detecting a duplicate. Just comment to one of your comments instead of the main post and it should work. I'll try and fix that tomorrow.
I went ahead and opened 50% of what I wanted as well. This breakdown looks like all that was was a bart/RSI cooldown. I'll open the other 50% if we get back near 8500 and bail over 8600.

!short XBTUSD 8350 5X 50%
When I lose on a trade I take it as “okay, so I just paid for my trading lesson, again”. That helps me a lot to look at it this way.

Good luck to you on your future trades!
It's lower highs we're seeing now, no? I can't see any significant difference between this and what we had around the same time yesterday.

Edit: Hats off. Man, you are clearly a better trader than me. There it goes.
So how did you know it was going to breakthrough on attempt 6.  Is that like a rule in markets?  6th time's a charm?

Not trying to antagonize, just asking, since it turns out you were right.  
I never said that it did- in fact I would agree with you there. I think market sentiment is generally disconnected from future price movements lately. 
It is, it's just that bitmex traders religiously follow bfx because it moves the market. 
It really just mainly has to do with where bitfinex is vs stamp+gdax- futures prices are more indicative of market sentiment. 

I would agree with you if swaps ever disconnected from bitfinex but I've never seen them try to move opposite of bitfinex.
calls for $3k were long term and it's still on the table. Nothing preventing us from going there at this point although it seems unlikely rn 
more of wait and see right now
I like the way you think!
it was 10 words anyway :P
Without a global calamity or black swan event yes that is correct. 
[deleted]
you don't have to follow TA to see that this bull run is looking kinda weak
Well if that is the case then I respect whatever is going through your and others mind regarding price movement or where ever it is headed to. 

I respect my ~~assumptions~~ speculations, just like I do to your's and someone else's speculations. Moreover, I mentioned someone close to me, so sorry to say but this is not your business and not something where you should be poking your nose into.

My write up was in the similar context as that of the OP's, targeted towards the group of people who upvoted OP's original post and feel the way he does, including myself. 

Sorry but I do not appreciate you pointing your fingers at me or anybody else, not at all. Have a good one!
What other two points? All I'm telling you is that the pattern completes once the neckline is broken and that is attributed with some probability of a breakout to 8.9/9K range. It doesn't mean anything until it completes. Also, the time frame is not *that* small. It's not like we're talking over the span of a few hours on the 5 minute chart. This pattern is visible on the 1 hr.
I'd like to think that most people know me by now :P
What if a random person tells ~~me~~ you to go long?
This changes everything
Yeah without a doubt. We all want certain things out of Bitcoin, especially when we're in a given positions, but to muddy your reasoning skills with biases is bad business. Trying to stay objective and balanced is as important a skill as any, including outside the realm of Bitcoin Traditional. 
> We have seen that in most of the world. And it is illegal to buy BTC in Western democracies now without going through KYC/AML.

That's not a ban, that's regulation of the fiat/crypto gateways, which was fully expected by everyone in the space dating back to the beginning. 

>You are wrong. It cuts down on demand, tremendously.

I never said that. 

>No, China and India have 3 billion people between them. That is important and not less important than the West.

From what perspective? A price perspective? Maybe. Don't forget that the price skyrocketed after China got out the game. The markets crave stability and regulation as much as anything else.

>You are trying way too hard with your rationalizations. Anyone who says "China doesn't matter" is showing their bias very clearly and that they live in a deluded fantasy world.

Again, were you even around for the whole China debacle? Didn't seem to play out as you're claiming.

I'm not rationalizing anything. I'm saying that the market and tech will march forward, regardless of whether or not some countries crack down to whatever degree. It only takes a small village to keep the project alive and moving forward. Past a certain point it's not possible for countries like China to see the effects of crypto affect their institutions, whether indirectly or otherwise. There's nothing "deluded" about noting the anti-fragile characteristics of Bitcoin and the fact that the economies and governments of the world are interconnected.

Step down off that high horse.

Based on the fact that gov'ts are making buying and selling crypto illegal and removing one of the major uses of it, which was financial privacy and freedom from the legacy banking system.  They are reducing it to a purely speculative asset with almost no practical use.

Sorry, but when you make it illegal for many billions of people to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency, it makes the fundamentals, worse, not better.

So this is a big bear trap in a bull run?
There are literally countless reasons to be bearish based on "fundamentals" atm.  For starters you should reread Didier Sornettes paper if you want an actual fundamental analysis.  

However, instead of performing actual analysis, most people prefer to say "muh institutional money" "the herd is coming" when talking about fundamentals.
Yeah, not saying you're wrong; just worried whether EOS really has what it takes in the tanks for a rocket lift off right now. I definitely believe alts are what drives prices these days, though.
I don't know if you know this, but I don't have a reason to want the price of BTC to tank. I want money like everyone else, and I don't short the market. So when I say its going down, its not because I take joy in it. 

I am reading posts in here, and 90% of the posts are from people who don't know whats going on. Same with the TA on tradingview, most people are posting nonsense. This includes the people with large followings. They're the cramer stock guys of the internet.

For the record, I sold 70% of my holdings on the 8th when it became clear we were heading down. My TA told me a week prior it would be happening, but its also premature on sell recommendations, so I ignored it. I'm waiting for the buy signal, and it hasn't arrived yet. I don't know where the bottom will be, but I strongly suspect we will have a 3rd test of the 6k bottom at some point in the future.

Well, in that case then you may well be right 
bull steak, most likely.

BFX will use whatever USD you have to enter the long, and lend you the remainder from the p2p pool using your BTC as collateral. Yes, their help pages aren't particularly clear on that.
I couldn't say. But any sales need to be okayed by the bankruptcy court and would need to be done OTC.
It is not really reporting if you don't do any research and simply sensationalize the original fake fud or an already sensationalized version of it from some other "reporter". Standards in crypto news/journalism are basically non existant. We need a more legit crypto news source where the writers actually make some calls to confirm information before writing.
Also I didn't say it was a conspiracy, it is simply the easiest way for a no name crypto journalist to make some money.
if you're using $5000 as a benchmark for "institutional investors" then i really dont think you (or many other redditors) know what the word means... :P
How about now?
Ha, tell me about it. 

Although that's fairly promising for a short. 

The market dropped around 14% in 24 hours, and so far buyers can't muster more than a 4% bounce. 
This has largely been a traders market since January. 

But my point is that the only reason we are here is because of a short squeeze. With no shorts to squeeze and the organic buying having been entirely retraced, it's very possible we just continue down from here. 

Believe it or not, $8k bitcoin is still really high. it needs mania to sustain its price. If the market goes sideways it will naturally begin to sag

Ahhhh. I think i get it now. So i want to substract my value -0.21 - 0.42 = - 0.63. But i dont see the button to change my value now.

I only see how to increase or decrease margin.

Edit: in order to add more money to my short i need to increase leverage, right? But the higher i set the leverage the smaller will be the margin and higher the risk.

stop crying about downvotes. We generally dont downvote bearish comments, we downvote bad content. Go back an consider whether your comment contributed to the discussion or not
Larger timeframes have more backing. There are people who only trade 1D candles. Most of these people are higher net worth individuals. Patterns are more reliable on larger timeframes and its a less risky play than day trading. A breakout above this symmetrical triangle that is over 3 months in the making will have volume pouring in. Even moreso if the daily closes above the boundary line. Now, when you enter this trade is up to your trading style. The aggressive trader gets in as soon as that line breaks. The conservative trader is waiting for a 4hr or 1D candle close above it, or they're waiting for a retest of the boundary line to get in at a favorable r/r.

You too brother!
? Rsi is not different? Resistance line is not different? 

Maybe we misunderstood each other. I'm not saying this is a reversal and I am going long term long here. I am saying this is a good 2-4% trade.
Nothing in this market is a rule lmao. No need to apologize. It's simply that the odds of breaking through support or resistance get better with every touch. That's the only rule. I never saw something being touched more than six times. So I guessed time to long.
This was true once. 
 
Nowadays, I really think it’s evolved to where the mere existence of such a large number of people on BitMEX trading in anticipation of the market -has caused the exchange to consistently lead price movements by several hundred milliseconds. 

I see it all the time. 

Actually in the non-crypto world, it’s pretty common for derivatives to anticipate the underlying. There’s an edge there if you can predict what will happen a second from now based on the underlying instrument’s order book/flow. 

It leads to an interesting reflexive situation whereby the price movements of a derived thing have influence over the price movements of the thing from which it’s derived.  

If you’re a trader on GDAX and you notice that the traders on BitMEX seem to be anticipating Bitfinex by a fraction of a second, what’s the advantage to paying attention to BFX over BitMEX? There isn’t any. 

You can start to see why there’s such volatility sometimes, it just becomes this vast circular system of effects, like a cyclonic storm. 


Ironically, since you posted this, bfx has lagged both gdax and Bitstamp.
the 3 billion dollar volume of mex will make it so that it becomes its own market at times and even people who do non-levered trading on independent platforms like binance look at mex.  When that funding rate is negative, I take that as saying mex traders have placed bullish bets above the market value of the true underlying asset as measured by gdax and bitstamp in this case.

It's just sentiment of traders that can be completely shifted 8 hours later, but that's how I read it.

Which part of what I said do you disagree with?  Surely not the part about avg relative funding rates during bull market vs bear market.
to get to $3K, we'd need a few more cycles

1. $9,800 -> $4,800 
2. $4,800 -> $8,600
3. $8,600 -> $4,200
4. $4,200 -> $6,800
5. $6,800 -> $3,400

Industrial scale bitcoin mining becomes unprofitable sub 5k. 3k will rapidly lead to 0$ btc. We will all become bagholders of very expensive internet money if that happens, if the infrastructure that supports bitcoin allows it to fall that much. 
I would say failure to break 10k is silly panic selling. We had one attempt, cleared it very slightly, then were rejected. Resistance not usually pumped and held on the first try. It’s a violent and unreasonable market reaction if that was all.

Again, surprising to me and I suspect there’s more to it than that. What I don’t know, perhaps the overall disappearance of buyers once we cleared 9k.
Define weak. Or zoom out, price is 20% above the bottom of this dump and higher than what it was for 90% of 2017.
Haha are you serious? This is a discussion forum, you put that there it opens it up for discussion, that’s how it works. 

The irony of you complaining of me “sticking my nose in” is not lost here, either. I’d imagine your friend feels the same way every time you deride him for not panic selling.
> That's not a ban, that's regulation of the fiat/crypto gateways, which was fully expected by everyone in the space dating back to the beginning.

It's a ban and wasn't fully expected by everyone. And doesn't matter how many people "expected" it.  It still doesn't change the effect it has on the market and utility of cryptocurrency.

>  From what perspective? 

A demand perspective.

> Again, were you even around for the whole China debacle

Yes.

>  Didn't seem to play out as you're claiming.

It is still playing out now and will continue to do so.

> I'm saying that the market and tech will march forward

The market will march forward with lower and lower demand, and lower prices.





Yeah, and it was a bubble at $100, $400, $1000, $5000... As they say, it's not the bubble, it's the pin.  If you're looking for a bubble, look into corporate debt and stock buybacks.
Bull walk.

I prefer to say: 

1) technologically superior form of money.  
2) limited supply, growing demand
3) proven anti-fragile having survived many, many attacks
4) people hate banks and bankers

I don't see any bear case at all.  Zero.  

"Man Plans, and God Laughs".

That applies to my wishful thinking of wanting the uptrend to last for days. Nothing is certain...
!short XBTUSD add 9350 24%
During my safari through /r/btc I was informed by the savages that BCH is Bitcoin and that I needed to call BTC by another name. I'm simply trying to pay respect to these poor souls.
I remember that morning so well.
I was referring to the fact that options with strike below 5k dont exist
Hehe, I actually added to my short a bit at 8430, then panic closed the portion I added at a loss at 8500.

Lesson I've learned: 1) Don't FOMO add to a short under your entry price unless a crucial support has been breached, and don't panic close unless a crucial resistance has been breached. 2) The second I add a bit more to a position than I'm comfortable with is when I start to get extremely uncomfortable and make rash decisions. Better to just never let myself get to that place to begin with. 

Although now I might consider closing at B-E to be honest. We're kind of floating up to that point slowly. Not sure what to make of this buying action.

What's your take?
I've got stops just over 8700 and planning to head to bed shortly, but that's always unnerving. Overnight alarms aren't an option for me (if I want the better half to stay the better half), so it's just a dice roll when I wake up. I'm tempted to close it at break-even, but we do appear to be making lower highs. Sort of descending triangle-esque? 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/toCddLmp/
It’s been 8 hours and the market is still at 8500+. When will you cut your shorts loose? I’m thinking 9400
Nice opinion. Ill stick to TA and news/otc based trades.
No, like I said, leverage doesn't increase position. 

\# of contracts is your position size. That's what you want to change. You want to add about 3000 contracts to your short (subtract 3000)
!short XBTUSD add 8400 2X 
!short XBTUSD add 8440 50%
Good call! You were right.

I agree with this wholeheartedly.
You see this in gold and other futures regularly.

The simple rule of thumb is that a no-arbitrage mechanism must exist so that investing in the derivative shouldn't create an opportunity that could have otherwise not been had in investing in the underlying asset.  Since this market is nascent and load ability of the exchanges are poor, this rule can be violated in crypto more often than in assets like gold.
Well you're kind of suggesting that bitmex undergoes price discovery + pushes the price up or down independently of spot, which it doesn't really that much. That's what futures are for. I've never really seen bitmex not follow bitfinex.

My disagreeing with you is saying that the market could be bullish even if funding rates were positive for shorts (which it was a week ago) if gdax + stamp is lower than bitfinex since bitmex follows bfx not the other two. 
yea I can see it happening that way. I'd put the $8.6k target a little lower personally but it could happen. $4800 to $8600 would be a mega bull trap smh
There is no 'need' for any magical cycles to occur.

BTC could very easily tank and not recover for a long time, as could a stock. 
Im with you on this. My version:

9900-7500
7500-9200
9200-6800
6800-?-4700
4700-7000
7000-3500
Bitcoin mining is self-adjusting. It is profitable for *someone* at almost any price level. Barring truly catastrophic price changes (eg. 90% drop overnight that stays that low), mining will adjust to compensate; the lowest-profitability miners will gradually drop out, lowering hashrate and therefore lowering difficulty, which then increases profitability for the remaining miners.

Again, there are some theoretical scenarios where this falls apart, but we have yet to see any true price-related mining catastrophes in Bitcoin's history.
I guess. It's also up like a billion % since its inception. Sometimes you have to look at more recent trends
Yeah whatever..
> It's a ban and wasn't fully expected by everyone. And doesn't matter how many people "expected" it. It still doesn't change the effect it has on the market and utility of cryptocurrency.

It's regulation on the gateways, which again can be circumvented through direct p2p transactions if so needed/desired.

That's not regulation on Bitcoin itself, which remains decentralized and its network remains unregulated.

>A demand perspective.

It's still relative and you can't make counterfactual claims about where the price would be otherwise.

>It is still playing out now and will continue to do so.

Nice hand waving vagueness.

>The market will march forward with lower and lower demand, and lower prices.

Not if a subset of nations foster its growth. Again, you're making absurd counterfactual claims.
  
Don't let them control your language man, everyone knows what Bitcoin is, anything with a suffix or prefix is a knock off that never got consensus. If you give up the name, you play into their scheme.
I'll never forget it...
ah i see, but then where are you inferring institutional investors from then?
That buyers are entering the market with all the enthusiasm of a child forced to clean his room before he can go outside and play:

"Ugh, fine. If I have to."
Those are great points there.
I'll probably exit at $8,650.

I have no idea where buyers think that are taking this if they can overcome $8,650, but I'd prefer not to get on the way. 
well the TA isn't particularly bullish but alright
I had 1800 contracts but now i sold 1100 more but could do that only by increasing to 3x. So i have 2900 contracts sold with 3x. Which means i will have to return 1100 back later. Right? I could not find a button on how to change my position size on existing order. And i only could short more xbt if i increased the leverage. 
Thanks already exited though lmao.
> My disagreeing with you is saying that the market could be bullish even if funding rates were positive for shorts 

I didn't say that. nor suggest that.   Of course there are always many positive and negative 8 hr funding periods during extended bull and bear markets.  But there is a major imbalance in the avg funding rate during those markets.

I have used BitMex for the last two years and this has been the funding rate behavior during every major bull and bear run.  And it is not a coincidence.

If the price moves from $8500 to $12,000 over the next several weeks, then avg Bitmex funding rate for longs is not going to be positive.  It's just not.

And if it drops from $8500 to $4000, the avg funding rate will be negative for shorts.
yeah I think $8,600 is going to be the $10,000 of this run. 

It'll be the resistance on the next run up. 
I know you don't believe in TA really but there really are very strong patterns that occur. Like some stocks don't just aggressively tank for years (which would be the equivalent of bitcoin tanking for months with virtually no upwards movement)


lowering difficulty... won't that lead to more bitcoin mined by the current ASIC devices, which are way more powerful that the previous ones that operated when BTC was in 3k range? Leading to more BTC mined, more BTC to be sold to compensate for costs, more price dropping, eventual crash and bang, dead?

By that logic we should have bought at 19k though.
My daughter says that too - she’s 6.
> It's regulation on the gateways, which again can be circumvented through direct p2p transactions if so needed/desired.

Again, it lowers demand and lowers market price.  

> Nice hand waving vagueness.

Wow you are really desperate.

You are in denial, which is not a good place to be, when your money is at stake.  
Lol, I'm just joshing of course (most of this sub doesn't seem to understand that I'm joking tho). Obviously Bitcoin is Bitcoin and BCash is BCash (an alt). 

Trust me, I'm under no illusion of what's what in this space. I'm a hardcore BTC maximalist.
ledger x does not offer options to anyone with less than 10M in trade volume
The "I have to" part being this potential double/triple bottom everyone's talking about? Or more as a FOMO reaction to the big market buys? (if those can even be separated) 
Starting to get a little hot under the collar now ;)
If I remember correctly, you wanted to long from 8300 because you thought we would see 8600 and then a drop from there. 

What’s changed?
You dont have to return any ever unless you want to. 

There's no button, you just have to add/subtract contracts to change your position size.


I opened a new long this morning and was about to close but kept it open a few minutes longer. I almost closed it before the green candle hit. That was a close call. Next time I might lose, but today I was in BTC at the right moment. 
I mean I generally agree and I haven't been on bitmex long enough to say what it does so I'll defer to anyone who has more experience- it's just that it's calculated on bitfinex, and from what I've seen bitmex tends to follow bitfinex religiously


..and, why are futures premiums still there if funding is negative for shorts? it's cause bfx is lower than gdax
Just saw this.

Difficulty lowers only if hash rate decreases, which would mean some of those ASICs dropping out; the amount of BTC mined would not decrease, but stay roughly the same over time (due to the difficulty increasing/decreasing to keep pace with total hash rate, which is based on the amount of miners/devices). Let me know if that's not clear and I can try to answer your questions.
and $2k, $3k, $4k, $6k, $8k, $10k...

No one should outright sell their full stack here probably unless they're a trader. but beginning to scale out is never a bad idea in case it does continue to go lower
Aww what's her name?
Lol, okay buddy. I'm not in denial, I'm simply looking at the facts objectively without comparing the situation to coulda-woulda-shoulda counterfactual nonsense like you're trying to do. 

That absolute ceiling may be lower without the participation of countries like China and India but that doesn't mean that there isn't huge room to grow *and* it doesn't mean that these countries will be pressured by global effects of this nascent asset class.

Get a clue. You're not more of an expert than anyone else here and *seemingly* you are much less so.
Oh fair enough, there are some lunatics who would post that stuff unironically, too subtle for me. Lol
>Bitcoin Cash is an alt


There you go blatantly lying again.  People like you are toxic to this ecosystem. 

Bitcoin Cash is not an alt coin.  By very definition, it’s a fork, you dishonest ant. And there is an important differentiation between the two:

Forks are entitled to the original project name through consensus. Alt coins are not.

Stop lying to people.
I gave up on my long because buyers were floundering. I entered my short for the same reason. 

Nothing has changed. A moderate bounce should have been a slam dunk for buyers. 

RSI was ludicrously low on medium timeframes and selling pressure evaporated at $8,200. Yet all buyers have managed so far is to panic buy for 2% and then panic sell that same 2%. 

So I'm still holding my short, with every intention of closing it if buyers can demonstrate that they actually want to buy BTC above $8,650. 
I only know what I posted above, because I have been on there for two years and almost always had a short position to hedge some of my cold storage.  So I am acutely aware of what the funding fees are, during different market conditions.

Last year, I made obscene profits from them and this year, I obviously paid out quite a bit.  I should have shorted quarterlies instead, but wasn't smart enough to do that.
Thank you, that clears that up.
> beginning to scale out is never a bad idea in case it does continue to go lower

Very few of us understand this unfortunately! :)
The time to scale out was above 9k imo. We dropped a lot but didn't get even half way to the lower support, still the 1D is sitting at 2 std below the mean (lower BB). Now we scale in.

(There is a saying I've read in here before about trading and optimists that I can't remember but am pretty sure is relevant)
You can verify with /u/sloppysynapses, I routinely claim Bitcoin Before Common Era is going to a million per coin within 5 or 10 years.
You are beyond clueless. There are not two Bitcoins, so what exactly is BCH? It's not Bitcoin... so... it must be an alt. Duh. 

Also, get my fucking quotes right, you word-twisting asshole.

I said:

>BCash is BCash (an alt).

Wtf is Bitcoin Cash? 
Would you advise against me adding to my short position at 8700,8800 and 8900 levels?
if you don't mind asking, do you have a stop loss in place or are you observing and will close manually if buyers move against you? I am currently in a similar short with an entry around $8,450.
Well I'll defer to that but from what I've seen bitmex mainly just follows bfx and funding rate is generally a representation of bitfinex vs gdax/stamp
Wouldn't be a terrible idea. Although breaking back above $8,800 makes for some weird behavior, and I'd be a little cautious myself. 
I'm watching and will close manually. 

$8,670 or so is my line in the Sand.
