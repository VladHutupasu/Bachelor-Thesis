[Daily Discussion] Tuesday, May 29, 2018 -- TITLE
#New post: [\[Daily Discussion\] Wednesday, May 30, 2018 →](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8n5lmx/daily_discussion_wednesday_may_30_2018/)
Short opened at 8300 got stopped out within profit at 7250 on that spike (had done so much scalping on it that its ca was down to 7350).  Don't care if it is stop hunting or a reversal or whatever, as I'm not gonna jump back in for a bit, I need a fucking break.  I had a few buys on september futs that were only a few dollars away from filling.  No regrets about that either, we'll see how it goes, anything is possible right now.

Meanwhile in the last week, I also managed to let go of my attachment to alts and fear of day trading them and increased their holdings 10% by finally selling them at massive losses and then buying them back last night (maybe I'll still need to sell them off again though)

Anyway, the reason I'm very comfortable right now and the reason I'm posting this is because today is an awesome day for me, that I have been working on very diligently since the beginning of the year:

**I am finally in green** considering all the day&swing trades I've ever made. (Just barely! By a few tuna sandwiches)  Until recently my trading experience was an overall failure and I've had to crawl back.

Next mission is to get back the BTC spent between 2015~2016, which I spent because I thought BTC was dead.  That might take me years to recover.

And the final mission is to get back the BTC lost to failed/hacked exchanges and my first misguided foray into alts, between 2013~2015.  Also might take years.

So still a lot of work to do!  But finally armed to do it.

I guess it's a sort of pointless comment to make, but none of my real life friends can relate or care, and I'm happy to have made so many (helpful) friends here during this experience.  Thanks everyone here for all the advice, commiserating, celebrating, and interesting conversation.
To bart or not to bart, I would like to first express my distaste for the phraseology but if it keeps people amused then hey.

Having a look at the DNA of a "Bart Simpson".

1. Low volume preformation.
2. One/two candles of strength.
3. Resumption of extreme low volume, no follow up price trading below 2nd candle after thrust. 
4. Low demand on upbars.
5. Final failed upthrust sold into.

With our latest rally, we are not fitting this profile.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/edrXIBCY/

1. Volume in preformation builds.
2. Volume only returns to average not extreme lows.
3. Price does not drastically selloff and continues trading below the 2nd bar.

Keep on your toes, there is nothing to stop us edging up slowly, that said I would expect a failed low attempt before we crack new highs. I am still concerned about the amount of overhead supply from traders holding longs looking for an escape. This is going to create heavy resistance at points of control as previous supports will be resistance.

[Volume profiles and retracements add to the story.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/nzoyH1nF/)
I'm continuing to look at periods of lower volatility because weekly BBands are still tightening at a dramatic rate. Periods of low volatility are semi-rare for bitcoin, but when they happen they tend to last 2 - 3 months and are followed by strong bull markets.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/22zQ88yV/

You can see that we've needed a long cooling off period because we're just exiting the longest sustained market cycle in bitcoin's history. Even if you combine the 2014 bear market and the 2015 consolidation market you're still left with an 87 week cycle vs the now closed 92 week bubble cycle.

The next couple months will probably be accented by people complaining about low volatility, bad entries, and fees. 

I expect to see a lot more "Bitcoin is dead" kind of demagoguery. Also "the bottom is in" should be pretty popular. Lots of petty bickering. The squeeze on trading profits puts everyone in a bad mood.
As an aside from TA or price talk, how is your guys' mental health? I feel like after I stopped trading/actively looking at the price every hour, my life has improved 10x. Although I made gains over this bear market, my stress levels went through the roof and I feel much better hodling. Curious about the mental health of some of the posters here?
So the market bounced the day after the bottom bears here were advising for more shorts and downvoting all bull sentiment.

What a shocking turn of events. /s
And just like that.. this sub become bullish again. Never a dull moment
For fractals fan: https://www.tradingview.com/x/s9Xcm9D0/

Broke the downtrend from 10K (although we already did it once) but got stopped by the resistance of the small downtrend that started on the 23. 20% of my buy orders got filled (the rest were between 6.950 and 7k). I will wait for the price to confirm the downtrend from 10k as support before buying the rest, target of 7800.

I think we will retest the 7k support once again before breaking 7800 though, to confirm the bottom and to trap a few more shorts. I don't think we'll have a second BGD (too expected). 

EDIT: Consipracy hat on: the MMs behind the BTC BGD are going to do the same to ETH, shorts are not closing and are going parabolic. 
Well we got a nice bounce off the line last night which may give bulls some hope in a recovery here, but it really is way too early to expect this will move to the upper side of the pennant.  Any momentum change will likely require some consolidation in the $7100 \- $7800 price ranges.  It's very likely we'll retest the support line a few more times before momentum can shift to the upside.  In a bullish scenario, I expect this will take at minimum a week.  There's no reason to rush a trade here.   

I really only see three good trading maneuvers:

1\) Short if this bounce is allowed to move to $7800 and hold the position through a potential consolidation phase in the low 7's.  Close the position if buyers hold the line and 1D MACD crosses to the upside.

2\) Per the above, long if price is not allowed to move below the support line and 1D MACD crosses up \(with stops below the line\).  A true momentum shift on the daily would promise the upper side of the pennant at around $9k sometime in June.

3\) Short if we break down from the pennant.  I would expect this to be a longer term hold as I have very little faith in lower supports holding for a sustained duration. 

1D RSI and support off the lower side of the pennant are technically in favor of bulls here.  There is a lot of room to move up.  3D and Weekly oscillators are incredibly bearish however, and we're now months from the perpetual optimism of the prior bull run which should give buyers some pause. 

Safe trades
Closed 100% of my long posted here @ $7431: [POST ](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8mnaib/comment/dzq7mfq?st=JHRMPJNU&sh=63bad7f4) 

Definitely a little premature, as our next form of resistance is in the $7600 range.. but never be scared to lock in profits. 

First long opened in 22 trades/2 weeks and I’m very happy to be in profit. I’ve now made almost 160% of my entire stack in my last 26 trades, every trade is in the green for a profit. 

As much as that could have been the bottom, I feel safer being out of position right now. I’ll either do a few things if/when we get there 

A) Short around $7550-$7650
B) Long around $6850 
C) Sit on my hands and wait for clear direction 
The most recent data from sifr data shows a negative relationship (stock market would go down and crypto would go up or vice versa) between the stock market and crypto, which is quite encouraging.


https://www.sifrdata.com/cryptocurrency-correlation-matrix/

This is a pretty new development if I recall because usually it has just been a weak positive relationship or no correlation.
Significant hidden bearish divergence on the 4 hour RSI (Red Line).
Previous one was no joke (Dashed Red Line).

Moving averages look primed to cross so a move above 7560 invalidates it.

Chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/FRYsqUXK/
Opening up short here. This is a hedge short (5x @ 20%) inside an extremely heavy historical resistance zone (7500-7600). We're overbought on shorter timeframes, and RSI is reset on medium frames.

Bottom line, I don't believe in this bounce. Everything that was concerning about crypto and the market as we neared $7K is still the case. If I'm wrong, I can cut this with a 1.5% movement (over 7600). 

!short XBTM18 7535 20% 5x


More meditation on BBands and market stability today.  I decided to match up RSI with volatility and only found two other periods in Bitcoin's history where volatility was low (measured by weekly BBands) while weekly RSI was this low. See the purple lines:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/oZH6MeRg/

Here's where I posted some similar thoughts  earlier today:

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8mw5vt/daily_discussion_tuesday_may_29_2018/dzrzypj/
We're at a pretty significant resistance here.  One more push and historical price action suggests a nice pump will be on the cards (13% and 24% previously).  Whilst a failure to do so could get nasty.

Happy to take out a small, low leveraged long if we can get over the resistance line on this
chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/aaiKVYPD/

EDIT: Most of the indicators I use for short term trend change are in and looking good.  I'm watching the 15 min MACD.  If it can stay in the positive and make a bullish cross I reckon that should do it.
I was certain that was going to break down hard. Not sure what to think right now. Euro looking reaaally bad. bitcoin just rejected a bart down (thusly). Who is trapping who here? Staying ‘long’ because I’m willing to lose a bit waiting on confirmation of bull trap before selling and I’m definitely not willing to miss out on a triple bottom confirming MoaBGD (a lot to ask but the fuck imma gonna miss it). I’ll eat my little loses patiently. good luck friendos 
Wow, the alts are really rallying.  Maybe this pump does have a ways more to go.  
!short XBTM18 close 7345

Broke through my line. Was able to close into the second leg up--fortunately futures were lagging behing spot a bit. Could bart back down, but I'm happy to take some time to re-evaluate now. 
Closed my long at 7400 (entry 7145) posted earlier in the day. Still holding eth longs expecting a short squeeze. ETH shorts at an ATH and still rising. 

Edit: Link for shorts chart 
https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSDSHORTS/
I'm watching ETHUSD like a hawk, the ETHUSD shorts are at an ATH and it could spark a cascade upwards dragging the whole market up. 

However, the recent pump is much less in volume compared to the downwards spike to 492 on Bitfinex on the 15m chart. For BTC the volume is comparable. Could this mean anything?
I'll repost this from my original on ethinsider as it might help some of you who are open minded :

I'm not a veteran, and far from an expert but I think I've come now to a pretty good understanding of the situation we're facing and what to expect in this market (I'm speaking of BTC which impacts everything).

Basically, since the crash from 20 to 6k there is no new money flowing in. Normies are disgusted and won't come back until they see +600% in 2 months and it makes the headlines.

So the movements we see are mostly traders moving the price by opening longs, shorts, with or without leverage, but with the intention to secure a profit quickly in a very insecure market.

As such, the overhead to move up is absolutely insane because as soon as btc moves +400$ we have underwater longs closing at a loss or breakeven, shorts opening, and simple lower buys getting sold. 

The barts we see everywhere are not really manipulation as many think, it's just leveraged trading doing its work (profit taking + rekts).

So when you see a big green candle like we just had, there is nothing to write home about because it's shorts closing on a support + bottom shorters getting liquidated + longs opening. No, my grandma is not suddenly buying bitcoin like in December at 15k, and probably won't until 2019/2020 at 32k.

I read everyday very misinformed people who think evil bears are suppressing the price with their shorts but it's the most bullshit argument ever, they are simply following the trend. From a psychological point of view, this people refuse to be wrong with their "investment" that can only grow (if they want btc, everyone should) and blame an external, evil entity for breaking the parabola (say Wall Street).

Now think about it, did wall Street crash eos at 23$, or is it just collective greed gone wrong? Nothing can do x48 in a few months and keep going. It's extremely resilient actually to be still at 12$.

I advise against gauging the price in % down from ath. The ath is an anomaly and not a reference if it's a parabola. Rather look how much 1 btc cost 1 year ago. Think out of the crowd and that might give you a good entry (no, it won't go to 0).

Now how to survive this : it is clear that bitcoin must "die" and all the longs get liquidated, weak hands must sell at a loss etc. to start fresh. Do not get carried out, bitcoin won't die if it goes to 4 or 3k. The goal of smart money is to make people think it will never, ever see a new ath and have you release your coins for cheap, in a long period of boring, extremely low volatility. That's where you BUY. Not V bottoms, or only to sell higher.

Hedging your cold storage would be a great idea tho.

If you want to trade this, buy the supports if you want but sell when it tops out. Because the downtrend is not over. And short the tops (made a post how to spot them if you scroll lower), and hold your shorts through bounces, because it will turn in much less profit to hesitate and overtrade in the end than just patiently wait for the price to plummet (still no new money, no sudden bullrun out of nowhere. It simply won't happen).

If this market really crashes (is that a if?) We might see incredible opportunities to make money on long term shorts. Litecoin, I'm watching you. If 100$ breaks this thing will basically go to 0 as all hope is crushed forever and a new wave of disgusted sellers appear (community is ripe for capitulation).

Good luck.
This may be premature, but I'm actually flipping sides here. The upside is too strong. 

!long XBTM18 7440 5x 20%

We are absolutely in danger of barting back down. However, my focus isn't so much on BTC at the moment, as I'm watching ETH. I'm not looking to long the ratio, but if ETH pops, BTC will follow. 

For those that watched BTC closely in April, there were a number of factors and patterns that went into the BGD:  

1) Shorts reached an ATH  
2) Shorts outnumbered longs  
3) Price double-bottomed off the 6400-6500 range, and then presented another "juicy" short opportunity at 6800-7000

I've been watching for this scenario to play out again, but there just hasn't been the reckless abandon on the BTCSHORTS side. While we all (hopefully) know that BTC is king, it is prone to follow ratios, both through arbitrage bots and market norms. ETH has pegged the above 3 criteria. Shorts are at an ATH, Shorts>longs, and it double-bottomed off 500. A short squeeze on ETH could pop over 600. At the current ratio, that's BTC @ 7950. I expect the ratio to recover some in that scenario, but it could be a catalyst for a continued pump on BTC.

I have adds down to 7400 and will cut if we drop another 1% below that. I'm pulling a chew here and entering at a sub-optimal position because if I'm wrong, I'm looking at -2%, and if I'm right, I'm looking for 5%+

edit: It is entirely possible this goes poorly. I doubt people tail my trades, but this isn't one I recommend. This may *actually be* a juicy short entry. 
I was out of town and out of position for the weekend so and just now really getting a chance to look at the charts. (BTW highly recommend you make yourself take a vacation away from computers and charts, I feel very refreshed for trading)

I had left an old resistance line from 9.9k up and the BGD slammed right into it. We still seem to be respecting that for the time being. Hadn't seen this posted in my brief skim of the daily.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/1oHGqEy5/

Opened a short here, will close if it breaks above 7500.
I do have to say - all of my friends are out. They aren't the kinds of people who should have been in, but they were, and it was absurd watching them get 100% returns. However, they're all out now. Shaken out by the drop. Most left at breakeven or ended up making paltry amounts due to not taking profits at the right time. I really think the vast majority of the fall FOMO retailers have been shaken out. It would make a lot of sense if the price began to recover here, just after BTC has thoroughly shaken the nocoiners from its back like fleas. This is teleological reasoning but I do think it has to be the case that mom and pop don't really make money off this. 
I only trade on the 4hr and daily. I’ve been waiting for 6.9k support to be tested ever since we topped at 9.9k. My plan was to buy between 6.9-7k. Here we are at 7.4k after bouncing and it’s a little frustrating (and for a few seconds, I actually caught myself thinking about FOMOing in. The old me would have tbh.). But it’s absolutely crucial that you stick to your plan. Because your plan already has your maximum acceptable loss factored in, and the risk/reward that you’re comfortable with. Anything else is changing the dynamic of the whole trade, and I’d argue that even if you’re able to sell for a profit after disregarding your plan and fomoing in, that’s still a bad trade. Because that was a gamble over a calculated risk. So here I am. I’m waiting for my 6.9-7k orders to be filled, while also keeping my eyes peeled for a reversal pattern here. Always stick to your plan, but note: plan is subject to change as market conditions change.
This morning has been epic so far...added 30% to my trading stack

If we get one more push then my target is right around 7600 where I will be looking to possibly short, however this could be the start of a rally lasting perhaps a few days

good luck out there

peace
Whatever is going to happen it certainly seems like there's some volume being thrown around \(as opposed to the last few days\).
My long from CA 7,260 is back in the green, but I missed a large limit buy/addition by $1, which would have almost doubled my position at 7,059 (Mex wicked 7,060).

What do you think guys about this prediciton? Read below the chart. [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/x9jV5YNp\-BTC\-BTC\-Idea/ 20](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/x9jV5YNp-BTC-BTC-Idea/)

" We think that when the [futures](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/commodities/) expire on the 29th of may we will see price actions up. Why? Because then "the big guy" have made a maximum profit and the price is low when Nasdaq starts to trade [**BTC** **4.25\%**](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/) . This combined makes a lot of sense to us. "

You guys think this was the cause of the pump?
When your 15m RSI looks like this:

But your 1d RSI still looks like this:

Gotta catch our breath here, but this has room in the tank potentially.
Pullback to test resistance as support. 

Let’s see where this goes. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/pPSLJ4w9/
Lol, 2 days ago: Goblin Town here we come!

Today:  MOON!
bears still in full denial mode

I thought it was a good bart, but I’m ready for a drop in 12 hours
[deleted]
OK.. So day by day we go lower and lower ( I know ... for months now  but a lot were thinking ... some where here ( 7k - 8K ) is the bottom )

Question: is selling volume drying up?. Is there a site / link where we can see the buy and sell volume? ( Day or weekly ).

I have the feeling that last weeks / days is low volume on the sell side... but also new buyers are awaiting?

We would need one more pump sooner rather than later to convince me that this is a bull flag, the beginning of a reversal, and not a Bart...
When looking at this link:
https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/volume/24h?c=e&t=b

It seems that volume is going back down, could be a bart is incoming?
Where are all BGD comments? Reddit you disappoint me.
Been awhile since I did anything significant. Relatively small update here.

Chart: [https://www.tradingview.com/i/aq56bxhe/](https://www.tradingview.com/i/aq56bxhe/)

Blue: Gigantic bear pennant that we broke down from. We're almost perfectly in the progress of confirming the former support there as resistance, which would signify a classic throwback; throwbacks are fairly common with large formations to really confirm a breakdown. This resistance also has confluence here with a high volume node on VPVR \(neon green line\). In dotted yellow, we can see a trend of RSI increasing steeply as price decreases very slightly across a few \(very\) local highs \(with the current one only now forming\), forming shades of a hidden bearish divergence. Maybe not a terribly strong signal given the price has been a bit choppy... Still, filing it under confluence.

Overall, fairly good r/r for selling here \(CAVEAT: imo, where my opinion is just some random dude on the internet's\) since you can have tight stops above the resistance with enough room to guard against a fakeout.

Still holding onto my ETH long momentarily, but just searching for a slightly better exit since I'm in decent profit and annoyed I missed out on 580. I know, being emotional. Oh well, worse case I exit below 570 instead of at 573 right now. Possibility for short squeeze there remains if BTC breaks above this resistance, but I just don't think BTC has it in it to do so and shorts on ETH have been decreasing all day to the point where I could \*possibly\* see the shorts continue just slowly deflating for awhile. And honestly, they were never spectacularly high with regards to BTC value anyway despite being at ATHs.
As others have mentioned, the lines are all a bit different depending on what exchange you're looking at. However, looking only at Binance (and cutting out the wicks at the top) makes me think that the bottom is in. The daily chart shows us bouncing off of double support. One being resistance turned support from the downtrend line from 19k and the other one is the support that we had bounced off of 3 times previously. https://www.tradingview.com/x/COEocNAI/



I would appreciate it if anyone could show me how to make a chart that combines multiple exchanges to show the volume weighted price of btc in usd. I suppose the CME/CBOE index would be the closest to what there is readily available but I have seen Peter Brandt briefly tweet what I am asking for before. 
Where is chewy btw? Miss his detailed market analysis with scenarios and overall calming influence

Edit; Don’t want to spam the thread with posts but ETH just did a fake break of 580 that usually precedes a bart. Out of Long at 579 and instant short 
"BTC's current market cap, $122 billion, is lower than $XRP's peak of $130 billion on January 8th..."

Why are people referring to 6.8k as predicted bottom or strong support when the trendline of the massive triangle everyone has been referring to is at 7k right now? Those of you referencing that number, are you expecting a slight fakeout and then to bounce back in?  


Edit: drawn conservatively, containing all wicks, its above that on bitmex, at 7k on bitstamp. I guess on bfex you can draw it 6.9. 
Feels bottomy, but it did yesterday too... out of position for now. Looking for a good entry, this is too droopy to trade and too risky to scalp for me
Technical bounce or going somewhere?
7106 long closed, orders filled at 7339. Almost closed it like 5 min beforehand at 7150 cause i wanted to pass out but realized ive been doing that too often lately \(not wanting to hold positions while sleeping\). I really hope we do BGD to 7800 but I've got enough alt positions I'm sticking to my trade.  


I know Ive seen chewy talking about people paying too much attention to win trade &#37;, and my last several trades could definitely be an example of this. My trading stack has increased several percent over the last 6 trades with this being the only profitable one, because I flirted with quick bails and tight AF stops on the other 5.  

Fuck fuck fuck. Just got a notice from Okex on login that I need to verify because my country isn't allowed on their site? Wtf. Anyone else? I didn't see UK being not allowed previously...

>Sorry! According to your IP address and local\(Hong Kong\) regulations, trading on OKEx is prohibited. If you are not a citizen of the country or region where your current IP address is located at, please go ahead to conduct the KYC verification.

I remember seeing my IP \(when it's a ipv6 address\) being listed as some chinese location in my login history \(weird\) for ages already. I assumed it was just a bug. So fingers crossed my funds are fucked.

Yeah it's reporting my ip address as being from Hong Kong \(in Okex\). Kinda fucked up.
For EU people *if* you think EUR/USD will recover (after last months 1.26->1.15, 11% drop) it is better to go long on BTC/USD now (e.g. on futures -- you can switch back later to EUR)

Say 1 BTC = 1000 euro = 1150 USD [EUR/USD=1.15] and at later time BTC/USD increases 10% to 1265 USD, with EUR/USD = 1.20, then BTC/EUR is 1054 EUR at this later time. In the first case, you can cash a profit of +115 USD [+99 EUR], in the second case you profit +54 EUR. Alternatively, if BTC/USD loses 10% and EUR/USD=1.2, then BTC/USD will be 1035 USD and BTC/EUR = 862 EUR. In the first case, you lose -115 USD [-99 EUR] in the second case you lose -138 EUR. In both cases you are better off with going long on BTC/USD.

If you want to short apply the opposite logic (i.e. it is better to short BTC/EUR). If you think EUR/USD will crash even further below historic lows apply opposite logic.
Once again setting real stops close to be on my long.

Not sure where this is going, another coin flip here but it has potential for going up so letting this ride. If my stops hit then this was a fake out.
Price seems to be creeping back up on very low volume.
Worried it won't take much to bring it back down.
"BTC's current market cap, $121 billion, is lower than $XRP's peak of $130 billion on January 8th..."

I love early stage crypto markets.
Watching this [daily](https://snag.gy/dUG5eK.jpg) bullish engulfing to see what happens, if it closes we're probably headed to 8k. 
keep shorting/selling bears ... please
This is fucking beautiful \(and a long time coming\)
Had long buy stacked from 7220 to 6760, half of them filled and i closed them at 7490. Only like 10% profit but i think we're coming back down so im just gonna set up my buys once again and wait.

Bullish engulfing possibly forming on the daily to watch for but untill we hit like 7650 its still a daily lower high
Volume seems to be picking up on the 30m chart. I just bought some more BTC for long term hodling \(so investing I guess\) yesterday. RSI hit 30 on the 12h. It's almost been a whole month in this downtrend since 9990. 

I find it interesting that etheruem's difficulty has flat lined over the past few weeks two. It'll be interesting to see if the same occurs for BTC eventually \(short term and long term wise\). Just throwing some thoughts out.
Closed 30% of my long from average 7090 here @7295 Hitting horizontal support turned resistance in this area.

Closed the rest here @7430

Lmao or no resistance at all.

Edit: Scaling into short now. @7430 too.

Edit2: Closed said short around 7392
Anyone seeing a cup and handle formation on the 1HR? Edit: scrap that, it looks more like a ladel with a huge handle now :\)
Got stopped out of my short for a tiny profit after missing my first take profit target by $4 last night. Woke up to 50% ROE and thought we might have another leg down to test the bottom of the triangle, where I was planning to close. This is what I'm looking at: 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/uLAiXks4/

We broke out of the falling wedge and are hovering around the trend line from 9K that we broke out and back in. Might start scaling into another short depends on what happens in the next few hours. Falling back inside that blue line would be very bearish. If we break above 7.7K with conviction might have to reconsider my current bearish bias.


Triple bottom confirmed or another Bart in the making? It's getting critical in here.
Just out of curiosity how do you guys have your 10k support line drawn? 

Macro: https://www.tradingview.com/x/BVfHbcHP/

I also have the falling wedge on the **4H** that we broke down out of, now acting as support on lower timeframes

Micro: https://www.tradingview.com/x/wGwxoxYM/

A long from the $7385 ish area wouldn’t be a terrible place to long, if you break down through the **red** line ( wedge resistance turned support ) or the bullflag breaks down I would bail. Also if we are rejected hard from $7500 ish too. 
Tightening my stops on my long but I expect this to run a little bit longer. I plan to switch short around the 7800 area.
***If*** [this](https://twitter.com/gatsiva/status/1001599478045036545) is correct and Bitcoin likes it's Stoch indicator we don't need much [Stoch rise](https://snag.gy/gzTCMs.jpg) to get up and out of the channel and I don't think the bulls have been left for dead yet. 
Short at 7410, tight stop loss at 7510. I see this testing 7.8K if this breaks 7500. I don’t believe there is enough volume to blow this past resistance *currently*. I’ll go long if we break up.
I'm exiting my long from this morning on June futs (7440 entry) at basically breakeven (7460). Had to schedule a lunch meeting and I'll be away for at least a couple hours. I don't trust this to behave while I'm gone, and it's feeling a bit precarious. If we break up here, I'll be content with my fiat gains. 

edit: This is either the push before the retrace (yay!) or we're about to bust through (boo!). Oh well. Sidelines isn't a terrible spot right now. I'll make popcorn. 
The first bottom was at 6000, the second at 6500, doesn't take an Einstein to figure out where the third will be. All in at 7000.
1d RSI below 30, thats enough for me. buying BTC and investing 50&#37; into Alts; expecting a bounce in the next few days to 8000\+
If fishing for a long entry, [we are coming up on an area with a solid risk profile](https://prnt.sc/jnwyni). 

Your second option [could be to play a break](https://prnt.sc/jnx0xl)
I just placed laddered buy orders starting at sub 7.1k range. I'm honestly not too convinced about the current price movement, and the whole "bulls delusional" meme may very well be true. Nonetheless I've decided to stick to my trading plan that I previously set forth as no fundamental changes have taken place, and this area is still interesting when looking at r/r. 

We're at the bottom of the pennant/triangle, RSI's are oversold on higher timeframes, and I've been seeing some large "chunk" buy orders taking place over the last two days. I'm taking the gamble that we're in an accumulation zone.

If we do fall out of the triangle, I'm not sure it will be as cataclysmic as some of the bears here are anticipating. I'll pull the plug on my position if we fall through 6700. I'd rather have seen more longs closed already and shorts numbers increased, but I think the fear of the BGD is still too fresh (and for good reason). I'm not expecting a massive pump, but a rounded bottom fashion reversal.

I'll be keeping a close eye on our support line that we've been following on our entire descent (@~7040), as a decisive breach would indicate accelerated selling momentum. On the upside, I'm looking for a breach of ~7300 as trend resistance and a solid horizontal resistance at 7600.  

As I said, this can really go either way, so good luck to both bears and bulls!

Chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/SXzcyWPR/
A lot of shorts just closed on that move up so I wouldn't be surprised if we stop here for now, but I definitely feel more confident that we are bottoming out here. I would not mind at all if we just go sideways in the 7's for a month now. I've had enough enough suspense for awhile. Time to take a break.

Edit: And there she blows...

Edit 2: Now this is the important part. If we are truly going down more people will sell into this in order to get out. If it can stay here and hold then we are in for a reversal and bulls will take back the reins for a little.
a lot of longs opened again 
Alright, I'll say it then. The overt bullish sentiment in this thread today is insane. It's 6% people. You're making it sound like we haven't seen 6% bounces on the way down from 10k.
Triple bottom here we come!
Double bullish divergence (May 23/26/28) on the daily in OBV (BFX)! I still think, as posted earlier, that we may test 6.9 briefly, maybe even dip below towards 6.5 for a good bounce - but these bullish divs make me increasingly optimistic that these supports will hold

Sorry, no chart as on mobile
What do you guys think of that potentially being the bottom? 
About this becoming a potential uptrend, and BTC getting dragged by an ETH short squeeze.  Yes a few pieces of the puzzle are there, on the ETH side.  But keep in mind that even if it does flip, both still could go back down and flirt with their macro trend lines first. 

The current spike feels a bit like the spike of April first in that regard.  After that day it went back down and then there were still days of bouncing around the local minima.

That being said, I too joined in for a small fomo long here but ready to gtfo quickly, if it goes below the 10k resistance-turned-support line.
Looks like we've formed a higher low on the daily, 6000,6600,7000.  We also have been forming lower highs...20k,11.7k,10k   If this pattern continues I see another lower high around 9k this time around. Thats a significant profit for those willing to go long.
BTC 15 min chart \(same happening on other time frames too\). Price going up, but the RSI going down, bearish sign. Be careful opening a long here,personally going short.  [https://www.tradingview.com/x/d4I6eMeM/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/d4I6eMeM/)
I'm selling a portion here, just going with my gut and my gut says dump coming soon... 
!short close 7505 100%

The 10k trend line has indeed been broken and tested twice now in the past few hours. So I’m closing my hedge for a small loss and see if buyers can take this through resistance at around 7530.

Will probably jump back into a hedge if 7400 breaks down.
Low leveraged long at 7145. Everybody is waiting for 6.9 levels, positioning early. Dual touch and bounce off 7050. Altcoins also seem to have hit their local bottoms. 

Edit: Might add near 6.9 levels
Well realistically it's likely we'll break under 7k today. I guess now it's just a question of how long it takes to break under our low of 2018.

I'd rather it's fast now because this slow bleed is damaging.

Don't want a pump back into the 7s, let's just get this price down to the real bottom quickly.

If we get yet another pump up, then the slow bleed down again and repeat this process again and again... Well we could be looking at another 3 to 4 months until bottom is in.

Something amusing to me is the sheer volume of experts on Trading view and YouTube who have just been wrong almost every single time when making predictions. How they get away with it.. Mental 
Good, now we can start talking about $20k again for a while. Funner than $3k.
Ill be the first permabull (not really permabull, usually bearish when the price is significantly above 7.5k) to say that I am pretty damn sure this barts back down sub 7k. Closed my long. If we can’t get above 7500, I’m not too sure what will happen. Will reopen above 7800 if we get there without too much fuckery
Any1 else having problems with bitmex stop MARKET orders? Had my S/L at 7520. Watched the mini BGD go up to 7545, stop untriggered (19.58). Price continued to climb up to 7566 (19.59), i panicked and market closed it myself. Got filled at 7523, strangly, at 19:59:30. Really shitty engine really. Although i should not complain, got lucky there, but i dont want to imagine i would have been asleep and a real BGD happened....
For the guys trading BTC/EUR:

If you're shorting are you going to short BTC/EUR or BTC/USD?

BTC/EUR could provide a great buffer seeing the EUR having tanked for six (or was it five?) weeks straight and daily RSI on EUR/USD being around 20 right now. I'm not sure what to short if BTC seems to top out. It feels like EUR/USD should see a technical bounce here or at least very soon. Any thoughts on this?
The 180-day Jesus cross is looming. This is a make it or break it moment. Typically, when it holds steady it means that it will bounce off of the Jesus cross in an upwards manner. The lack of sell pressure makes me pretty certain that we'll be holding steady, which based on the technicals means we're probably headed at least 10% up this week.
everyone is shorting 7500 its becoming too obvious a place to short frankly , i wouldnt short here\(im wrong most of time tho\)
Follow up on my post yesterday. ETH still pushing through and I am tightening stops on longs. Shorts down just by 5% so far. Glad that people who flipped bullish cos of ETH shorts are in the green. I think it’s useful to keep eth in sights as it is leading this market for the past month or so
Well, I missed that boat, waiting for log support. Fuck me.
https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2018/05/return-mcbitcoin-mcdonalds-korea-soon-accept-bitcoin/

This caught my eye. Increased adoption and legitimacy will fuel the next bull run. The last one was speculation. There is a lot going on behind the scenes and if 7k holds its a great floor. Certainly would have taken that if offered this time last year.
Opened a short, not believing a reversal yet. Only a small one though since I'm not super confident and might be suffering from recency bias. Will bail around 7600 or if this thing just rams through resistance. 

!short xbtusd 7500 10X 25%

I'm ready to be proved wrong though.

This is insignificant on the big scales \(1d\-1w\) and also the volume is nothing to speak about \(around 4k btc on the bgd\).

It can be delusional for bulls and scary for bears. But a good trader should be ready for a BGD like that after a sustained red movement.
It looks like my accumulation theory that I took so much heat for yesterday may have been correct. Looks like our mystery buyer painted the floor and is still accumulating in this range ($7100 - $7500) - now walking the price up instead of down.  After he wraps it up the last of his $$ might be spent on a BGD to get this party started and signal "break out" to all you technical guys.  We'll see soon I guess.
Have you guys heard the story of a group of young bear cubs who ventured onto a grassland where bulls, before they mysteriously disappeared, used to pasture?

RSI on the daily was at 30 earlier today, and we had a bit of a bounce off of the giant symmetrical triangle \(from 6K/6.4K bottoms\). Also, MACD is close to crossing bullishly on the daily. Technically speaking the bottom seems to be set, but I am still waiting for BTC to gain 7.8K/7.9K, and for the MACD to actually cross rather than "about to".
Don’t be disappointed when it’s just another “bart”. 
The word is out. Going to be very interesting to see what legacy markets do the next few days...the blood should continue.
Cup&handle clearly visible on the ETHUSD chart. This could drag BTC up with it, when it breaks out.
The longer without a move the more bullish or bearish?
Long from 7910 here..Don't know if i should sell now for a small\(er\) loss, or just wait this one out. BTC is near the upper limits on the 4hr bollinger bands so I feel that BTC might drop a bit here. Will most likely just continue to hold for now..

I just don't see us breaking through the 1600 coin wall at 7000 or the 1300 coin wall at 6900.  we haven't had that kind of dumping pressure yet on this drop have we? And if our low is 7000 that would put us in for a rising bottom, yes? {6000, 6425, 7040, next one 7850\(ball parking\) at the end of July \(every two months\)}. I hope. Next top wont break 9000 by June 16th before we make it back down to 7800 over the following 6 weeks.
Im lubed up for the BGD, I want it, I need it. Lets gape up, boys.
!short xbtusd 7105 1x 25%

Scaling into another short. Plan to add on a bounce to $7.5K or a break below 6.8K
Opened a long at $7095. As much as there is very little selling pressure there seems to be a general good sentiment amongst buyers.

Closed my [3x short from 7378](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8mnaib/daily_discussion_monday_may_28_2018/dzp00n1/) at 7082. I believe a quick fakeout upwards is imminent and want to catch it for a new short. I don't personally see a bullish divergence, just another support line we have to go through slowing down the rate of price decrease. Still, 2h, 3h, 4h, 6h stoch rsi is in the red ready to flip with macd's decidedly undecided in the middle. It would be prime territory for a long, except opening a long here would be trading so hard against the downtrend that the r/r is not even close to worth it.
At least BTC/EUR is holding up a bit better haaaaaa 

RIP EUROPE
The most reliable indicator of mid-long term price reversal is that the news/sentiment has been priced in. ie Buyer or seller exhaustion.

So, has the negative sentiment of bitcoin been priced in? Has most people who think it's gonna drop further sold already? Or are there still significant groups of untapped sellers?
Up a bit on my 7.28 long and 7.1 add. Not even looking to close but will set a small-gain stop when we hit 7.55, probably later today.
[https://www.tradingview.com/x/ajRxW1cN/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ajRxW1cN/)

Possible rising wedge pattern. I have short scalped the top about 3 times now on the 1 min\( yes I know who in God's name would use the 1min). We are also seeing a clear bear div on the 1h together with a big green shooting star coming down from the resistance area around 7570\-7650.  RSI is reset on a lot of medium time frames. I think this daily will still close green and we'll have some more consolidation.

I'd say scaling into a short now seems like a great idea depending on risk tolerance. If you want to set a stop in the 7800\-7900 area you can scale in now. If you rather have a bit looser stops around 8200 you can also scale in now but with only 10&#37; compared to 25&#37; around 7550. Above 8200 I'd seriously turn bullish. The symmetrical triangle is coming to a close soon and imo the lower highs pattern won't continue if we can make it above the middle of the daily BBands.

For Bulls horizontal support zone is around 7400. Below that is 7200 again. If that fails I think a breakdown is a sure thing.

Good luck especially to my fellow Europeans trading BTC/EUR.
Maybe I am projecting, but going to be more difficult to push this higher than it was to $10K.  There was more bullish sentiment then and you can't fool some people repeatedly. You can fool some indefinitely, but not all of them.

Of course this could be manipulated higher, but going to take more resources and less profitable for those who do it.   They are going to face more selling/shorting every step of the way.  And again, maybe my bearish bias is creeping in, but that's my take.
made a few scalps here, but I think it is a trap.

such a BGD move works once that the sheep follow but not twice. 7.7 or so possible but not much more imho.
[https://imgur.com/a/POIh4IO](https://imgur.com/a/POIh4IO)

I also see a strong bounceback of the current indicators on the 12 hour chart. For me, this could be the end of the downtrend from $10K and mean the next trend reversal or landfill zone. 

Anyway, the consolidation of the bulls will take days, but I'll be watching closely...following closely  


\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-  


Tambien veo un fuerte rebote de los indicadores de momento en el grafico de 12 horas. Para mi, esto podria ser el final de la tendencia bajista desde $10K y significar el proximo cambio de tendencia o la zona del vertedero. 

De todas forma la consolidacion de los toros llevara dias, pero estare atento...siguiendo de cerca
I bought in (long) BTC, LTC, ETH on May 12, walked away for a few days and now I am severely under the water... I'm thinking if I should sell LTC and ETH and go all in on BTC. Or just pull out for now.
Wow been a little while since I posted last.  
[Here](https://imgur.com/9YPsUq3) is a bit of TA for you all to chew on.  
  
-"Long term" support line going all the way back to Novogratz v Ver. is under fire  
-1d "Death Cross" looming  
  
I have no idea if it will hold or not. Am thinking that "death cross" on 1D could be a big sell signal for the bot traders. Of course, also means a bargain buy potentially. If 7k breaks, have to believe a good amount of stop-loss will be triggered. That will be interesting to see.  
  
Buy interest seems weak right now. Long-term utility of BTC as a store of value seems as true as ever though.

I remain convinced that we will test, at the very least, the 6.8\-6.9 range. But looking at the BitMex price index just now we bounced perfectly off the ascending support line:

* Zoomed out: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/8EiwPO7b/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/8EiwPO7b/)
* Zoomed in: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/04Y8rVTv/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/04Y8rVTv/)

Looking at the price action for the past couple of days, IMO the buying seems more "organic" than the selling. Selling usually happens within 2\-3 big red candles, but buying happens steadily in channel\-like formations. I guess this is classic flag patterns, but still, buying feels more organic.

If we break 7350 with conviction \(upside of the channel\) I will remain neutral until we see some proper bullish continuation patterns confirming: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/QmxMc4s0/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/QmxMc4s0/)

Surely Sir Dumpy Gallahad will ride in at any moment and save all the mentally disabled shorts with his mighty endless supply of coins to sell at a loss!

EDIT: sentence didn't make any sense
Somebody call the Justice Department. Stat!
I closed my short at a sizable loss and took a small long position in the last dump.  I think there is a good chance that 7200 or lower gets retested but I think it could potentially be some time until that occurs and I didn't want to have to be too stressed out over the next 12-48hrs when despite the large loss (-.24 btc) I am still up over 200% from last week.  I learned a lesson of not leaving too many unfilled buy/sell contracts open before going to sleep.  I don't know if I am actually bullish at this point but I think we will climb up to at least $7600 before dropping back down and I can get a better short entry at that point.
Three 30m shooting stars in a row forming a triangle, we need to retest the downside it seems. 
Alts are changing direction, people are either tiered of waiting to jump on these prices or we've found a new bottom. BTC may follow soon. 
Bitcoin Chart Widget (android app) ded for anyone else? It stopped updating earlier today for me.
[deleted]
I just moved 10 percent of my alt stack into btc to help support the price and to squeeze shorts.  The btc/alt relationship is sort of a paradox because alts move higher when btc goes higher but btc has to move for alts to go higher because they lose more ratio when btc goes lower.

Seems like the right move would be for everyone with alts to move 10 percent of that into btc which can help stem losses.

Only talking about alts because it's a move into btc btw.  Thanks.
Probably a good time to close your shorts, guys.
It's a baby BGD!
I find this entire ~~ordeal~~ green-dildo minutely retarded

The probability is high we will see more green candles before we close tonight. I do not see this going back from where it emerged today at least as of now. 

On the other hand, 9 days and still counting, moving closer to my target..
7-day quadfecta is looking bullish. We've failed to break the long term (L) and short term (s) support line when considered as (L * s)(7080 - L + s) > L + s  which surely means we're nearing the end of this slump. I expect a swift bounce to $7,800 starting tomorrow with possible continued capitulation if the medium term support line is surpassed.

I'm leaving my daily chart to see if anyone else can help. Without a doubt the $7000\-$7100 range was a good buying opportunity.  
[https://imgur.com/a/iIh1rSo](https://imgur.com/a/iIh1rSo)

It is still difficult to predict the future situation of bitcoin. The only concrete thing is that the resistance of $7600 is a very important factor to consider in our forecast.
For the bulls out there; In my opinion, the most bullish move that could happen right now is for the market to retrace do either of the following with high volume confirmation:

1. local double bottom at 7050
2. big double bottom from April lows anywhere between 6800\-6400
Up nicely now on my 3X long from 7250 with an add at 7100. Will set a stop at 7350 (which I doubt will trigger) and probably move it up in the morning. Plan is to chase this run up, worst case scenario is to get wicked out with a small gain.

Bitcoin has been very good to me.
every time a rally gets going they snuf it out.

Obvious manipulation cause if you wanted OUT OF BITCOIN i.e. to sell your spot??

Yeah you would release it slowly and not try to kill price momentum so you could get better prices.

No what you have here is giant traders who are manipulating to get More coin.  Wonder why they want 'more' coin of something so useless?
Waiting for the rage quit. We know you're out there. Don't make us come get you.
im optimistic, i think its going to be difficult for the price to reach into the 6's.  Not buying here though, i will definitely if for some miracle it goes into the low 6's, and even more definitely if a 5 is in the price.  However realistically i think its bottomed and would rather be accumulating more at higher prices as I've already successfully bought into every bull trap
Which exchange do you guys use to cash out your btc? I ACHd money from coinbase to my account over a week ago and my bank still does not see it. Support is supposedly looking into it and im sure its going to be a nightmare. Anybody have a recommendation?
As usual there is no meaningful followup. It will crash back probably.
Totally not a bull trap.
Stop the FOMO, it is AGAIN not a reversal and nobody has weak hands if he starts selling here. Bounce to max. 7.7-7.8k resistance then drop below 7k.

- Inv. cup with handle inside the bear flag.
- Anything but a bounce above 12k results in a bearish garltey or double top.

Apologies for the bearish sentiment. I’m just interpreting the data. Bullish in the long term!

As part of my trying to adjust to the coming sadness market I'm considering selling a 10th or a 4th of my trading stack, in a new type of order called a "market order" where you take the sizable risk of it triggering at market price and not a greedy limit where if it triggers at all your following buy low sell high automatically.

People who are not perma bulls, how do you manage your anxiety of holding toilet paper rather than hodling magic internet money? Any what sort of things work for that?
Not the first time there's been a pre\-holiday weekend dump, sideways / slow dump, then pump EST am on Tuesday.

Always worth waiting after a long weekend  to see if there's a pump at that time.
So I just had a vision. A vision that China lifted the ban on crypto. I saw a future where there was real adoption and people and business actually using blockchain. 

I think this future is inevitable. Blockchain technology is here to stay because money is involved. And a lot of it. The cats out of the bag. I dont think there's any time in history for an innovation to emerge and people stop trying to make money on it. Blockchain is here to stay, period. A lot of projects will fail, but the ones that emerge will be names that go to the end of time. Short term we can go as low as we want but long term (10 years+), it's going up.
If it can just spike up about another 150-15% here, that'd be swell
I'm going to take a break as I just master raced this. Short opened at 7500 10x lev, sold at 7180 after missing my target during night by a few dollars only. Then jumped back for a long at 7270 15x lev with very tight stops, as I felt there will be an imminent bounce. 5 minutes later it was at 7430. Risky deal but I did it cold blood.

I'm going to take a few weeks holidays. I want to go to Athens and Reykjavík sightseeing. I will possibly open another short around ~8500 before the next break down. As I'm still convinced we're heading to lower lows during summer. I'm now 50% btc and 50% into alts for a few % bonus growth (hopefully)

Good luck y'all.

Woah just seen this.  Has anyone seen the similarity between this BGD and Aprill 11 BGD \(6.9k \- 7.7k\)? Kinda cool.
Will we see 6k or 9k?
**Tinfoilhat moment:** 

The bears over extended and bulls got the upperhand after trapping bears. Which resluted in the current short squeeze. Which will likely be a painful hold for those who didnt stop out. 

On the other hand the whale bears might have sent the price down enough to make small fish and dolphins sell their shit cheap and is now letting the price up so they can fill their shorts with liquidated small fish money. 

Or ... we have bottomed out for a retest of the trendline from 10K etc etc..

Theory: We all roll our eyes when an “expert” on tv is giving the public hopium of massive gains “by July!”, or “by the end of 2018!”. But they don’t even believe it themselves. They want the dumb money to keep holding on, deeper into the bear market, just on hope. So that July or EOY comes around and their *expectations* have not been met. They’ve been let down. And the price is even lower than it was when the “expert” told them to “Stay strong! Gains coming soon.” Worn out, these people sell the boring, low volatility bottom.

What do you guys think about this scalping idea: 7100 -> 7200? (Falling wedge)

https://www.tradingview.com/x/ceTuhe7T/

It could break up but I don't wanna take that risk, and would take profit at 7200ish

what did i tell yall? going long is the way to go like i said a day before. btc is too easy to predict.
Bullish engulfing in 10 minutes or last 10 minutes will push us down to below 7400

Never been before, but next 10 minutes are critical my friendzzz..

You see what I did there :D
**Congrats** on getting back into the green! That's really impressive considering how brutal the market has been these past few months. 

Hope you'll still frequent the sub despite taking a small break, I enjoy your posts, analyses and contributions! 

There will be ample opportunity in the (near) future to extend your gains even further. Practice/experience makes perfect, so the trading returns should only get better as you go. 

Once again congrats! :)

Ps: Also really nice trade on your short from $8300 8-)
Be proud of what you've achieved and take a breather. It's good to have targets, but I'd recommend stepping away from the mindset of trading to get back what you 'lost'. Keep emotions at bay, trade diligently and best of luck for the future :)
Congrats buddy! These kind of things tend to built momentum, you're getting over the hump and your trading style should just keep improving since you stuck at it, good work. 
Great!!!
No problem my friend!!
It's a great feeling to be back in green. Congrats and major Pat on back. Do longer term trades, I deleted my 5m window and thinking about replacing the 15m with 1day (I have 6 windows from 15-720min in one window)

Also listen to this sub (and all discussions that aren't tool-based) less. 
Well done chief
Congratulations well done.

Dude this is awesome, props for digging deeper instead of just screaming bart Bart bart. 
> To bart or not to bart, I would like to first express my distaste for the phraseology but if it keeps people amused then hey.

So glad I'm not the only one. I use it out of necessity, but it annoys me every time.

I'd identified most of these indications just from watching them repeatedly, but bravo for quantifying. I'm holding a long from basically right here, but if I see us push for 7500 again and fail to breach, I'll probably be cutting it. 
Man, just tell me, is this thing going to bart or it ain't?
Sounds like you'll be kept busy as a mod then in the next few months. 
I have a question about BBands I was hoping you could answer. I've always understood that BBands are simply the moving average +/- 2*standard deviation. Which means the center line should always be in the middle of the two bands. However in your chart there are periods (twice in 2013, once around Jan 2018) where the lower BBand drops to 0 (even negative?) while the upper BBand doesn't move up that much, and consequently the center line is much closer to the upper BBand than the lower. How is this possible?
Every break I have from crypto makes me realise more and more how much I hate trading and crypto.
I like to think it hasn't affected me at all but yesterday I butchered my whole family and had an affair with the neighbours dog so I might have to re-evaluate. 
Life for me is a lot better not day trading.  
Last year was fun but shit I realized I basically did nothing else. I didn't make enough to make it worthwhile. Did learn a lot though.  
Never tried crack cocaine but chasing 15m charts made me feel like what I imagine it is like.
Hasnt been too good lately, Ive gotten quite stressed. Although I have to mention, its no different from running a business, Ive experienced the very same there. But I can absolutely see how trading certainly doesnt always improve my life. The effects of winning are much less than the effects of losing. 
I am on the brink of madness..
I've gained a new appreciation of the the phrase monkey on my back. I like it when he strokes my hair, when he's screeching and biting life is hard.
Also stopped looking at prices and my portfolio daily, made me sad and depressed, look at it once in a while, and if theres profits I take and sell out, whereas when I started, I was getting minimal sleep, less productive at work, and consatntly checking the price, reading up etc, mental and overall health has improved drastically since I stopped trading daily.
It depends on the situation. Im in a life position where losing a couple thousand isnt bad unlike someone who has more important responsibilities would be stressed out of their mind
I'm just fine... looking at 8 empty bottles of my own home brewed beer. Not stressing at all.
During the first ETH blowoff at 450 last year I was losing my mind and finally sold around 430ish. I paid off all my debt and assumed a more stable risk profile across all my investments.  I set weekly buys for BTC and ETH, that I could reasonably afford, and my mental state was drastically improved.  Made the 2nd blowoff too feel soo much better.  I’ve over traded for the last month trying to protect fiat value/stack and it really does take a toll.  I’m already sick of it.  Got into a revenge trade at the bottom of the triangle after getting chopped all month and it seems to be playing out ok.  Set s/l up into profit and am not going to babysit it.  
We just had a baby so not sleeping much to begin with. But overall my mental health is fine i think \*twitch\*
We bounced exactly off support line.
I mean I went long for a bounce \(am already out and not shorting\) but its a little early to act like we have reversal or anything.
Almost as if the market makers are pros preying on retail sentiment...
You are celebrating the price at $7400...says everything.
Really? Because, like, half the replies in the comments are still saying, "this isn't the bottom. No way we are going up. We'll fall again." I'd say it is a pretty even split right now.
Just wondered recently if this was a bear forum or if I had came to a bcash site.
This is the best chance we have had in a while to be bullish. 

Let us ride the rollercoaster BB. 
Delusional
On stamp we didn't break the resistance from 10k.
I was thinking the same thing on ETH last night.  Went long 40% trading stack at the bottom of the triangle.  Would love a squeeze up to the 600’s.  
Are we talking shorting ETH price or ETH/BTC ratio?

Thanks.
How the hell you're being downvoted here?
Why are you getting downvoted? If people diasgree with the analysis debate him, dont just downvote him.
Great trade on that short by the way. I should've followed suit and closed my short as well, but honestly believed we had another leg down and got stopped out for a tiny profit.

I'm waiting to see how the next 4H candles close, maybe there's another leg up and then possibly scale into a short  depending how it gets there of course. If this breaks down on the other hand I might have to sit it out.
I'd give you a sticker if I had money left....
> never be scared to lock in profits

I did the same now, a long position opened yesterday.
That will be Difficult times .. to sit on your hands. 
26 trades in profit in a row? Dam that is amazing. Must be in the genes. Over how long of a time period is this?
> last 26 trades, every trade is in the green for a profit. 

Absolutely remarkable.  Maybe buy a lottery ticket while you're at it?  (though it does go to show, the trend is your friend (if you can spot the trend))
Am I correct by assuming your not convinced that this is the reversal to a bullish market?
Interesting. Would be great if they added some fiat currency pairs to that matrix. The strength of the CHF against USD or EUR is a good crisis indicator. Also interesting that there is almost no correlation (neither pos. nor neg.) between crypto and gold.
Guess the stock market must be going up :\(
At what point will it be confirmed?

Divergence’s go way above my noggin 
This kind of confuses me sometimes. If we look at the troughs, there is bullish divergence, if we look at the peaks, there is hidden bearish.

Which do we give more weight, has the bullish divergence played out already?
Overbought.

Ballsy, but might be a nice win if this will be a fake out.
This time I wouldn't cut but add (ideally 7.8 but I doubt it will get there)

Otoh eth shorts are a risk.
Same here (slightly lower @7523) with 20%. I think we'll see some more upside though before this calms down. 

Mind me asking where you're setting your stops? 7.8k or 8.2k?

Edit: You already edited that in nvm.
Nice entry point. My short from 7.4 got rekt on the way back up, stopped at break even but a lot of profit down the drain (didn't have take profit stops set and didn't think we'd bounce higher than 7.2 before continuing our descent), and I shorted LTC/BTC ratio last night so in a hell of a bind now lol. I don't believe this bounce either but I've seen stranger things I suppose. Right now just seems like traders painting the charts. But that uneasy feeling that characterized and fueled our decline, of the space slowly deflating, still lingers. 
And doesn't everything that was optimistic when we neared 20k is still the case?
I'm curious ... when, and more importantly, why, did you enter the market?
"I don't believe in this bounce."

Uh... maybe learn some math and stop relying on that old-time religion and you might actually make some money, dude. Good luck anyway. Hope you don't get too rekt.
Based on these charts, my Neanderthal brain says buy at 5500
Interesting! Great charts
Current period is most like Summer 2014. 

You're also missing relevant data from 2011.
Nice chart.  How do you add those little tabs at local highs and lows with the price at that time?
What is the deal with the euro?  It seems like it's getting crushed.  Also, I hear Italy elections are in chaos

Edit: if Italy pulls a brexit, it could lead to a domino collapse of the euro
Alts also went down a lot more than Bitcoin in percentage terms with each red day we saw during the past week. If you take each alt’s recent high, roughly from the start of May when all coins were up and Bitcoin was at 10K, then compare what percentage of that price they each are at now, you’ll likely find only a few alts may have outperformed Bitcoin during this timeframe.
This is usually not a good sign, altcoin until recently usually lags bitcoin ethereum. Market leadership flops back and forth. But altcoin rallying first is suggesting people are willing to take on much more risk over leaderships like bitcoin and ethereum

I think this is a wise move. Ask side is looking pretty thin so this could wick pretty high if someone fatfingers. I'm really looking at the 7600 level to see how the market responds and to determine if this move'll go somewhere.


Your patience on shorts is admirable! 
Why didn't you close on support line? You could've just wait if it breaks.
Noice!

It's almost a relief to finally let it go eh?
Oh wow nice find on the Eth shorts at ATH. That should definitely cause some fireworks, probably spilling over to Btc too. 
Great post and an interesting read! I'm a bit confused though as you seem to contradict yourself a little. 

First you say there's no evil entity suppressing the price, and later on, you say big players want people to think all hope is lost as a means of generating a sense of capitulation. 

Are they not necessarily selling to bring the price down but rather collectively not buying until it's way back down according to your narrative?

Just wanted to clarify your theory :)
> I advise against gauging the price in % down from ath. The ath is an anomaly and not a reference if it's a parabola.

This and, 

> The goal of smart money is to make people think it will never, ever see a new ath. That's where you BUY. Not V bottoms, or only to sell higher.

This.
I'll just say: upvoted.

Not agreeing with when downtrend/uptrend will stop/continue, but only because nobody knows that... Other than this you have a point.
You seemed to be making a lot of sense and then dropped this nonsense-

>"Now how to survive this : it is clear that bitcoin must "die" and all the longs get liquidated, weak hands must sell at a loss etc. to start fresh."

That is not clear to me at all.


> Basically, since the crash from 20 to 6k there is no new money flowing in. Normies are disgusted and won't come back until they see +600% in 2 months and it makes the headlines.

Stopped reading here.
\> Now how to survive this : it is clear that bitcoin must "die" and all the longs get liquidated

How is it going to die this time, based on price action only? At least last time there was a real cause of death, gox. 

Good post.
Lost of russtled jimmies, but this is exactly right.  Most normies are either crying at the price (hoping to get out break even) or just don't care anymore.  There's no sign of fresh bull blood suddenly getting injected for a monster run.  I'm with you all day on this whole market needing to bleed and die and scrape the bottom for months/years.  Only then can we see another epic run develop.
> The barts we see everywhere are not really manipulation as many 
> think, it's just leveraged trading doing its work (profit taking + rekts).

stopped reading here. majority of exchanges do not offer leverage and the pattern is playing out everywhere therefore not a result of leverage. It is a common algo pattern however.

I agree with your broad sentiment as well. We are still much higher than we were at this point last year because of manipulation and normies fomoing in. I believe the price is still being propped up by people holding hopes for a new ATH coming any time now, and they want to make sure not to miss out.

I wouldn't go so far as to say people aren't buying here though. The smart buyers would likely be more likely to start entering the market here compared to when it was pushing toward $20k. However, I doubt this is enough buying pressure to make up for normies selling during this bear market. While this is most likely not the bottom (I would be surprised if this is), it would be more reasonable for people to start DCA-ing here vs. the end of 2017 when price was going parabolic. Obviously normies are disgusted by Bitcoin at the moment, but I'm sure that will change over time once they start seeing dollar bills in their eyes again.

We are at an interesting point at the moment where blockchain technology is seen in a positive light, while Bitcoin is being called a Ponzi scheme. My assumption is once we have finished capitulation (which may be months down the line if we're being honest here), people have short memories and may be willing to invest again once many alts develop real-life use cases and people see interesting new use-cases to invest in.
Starts off with "No new money coming in"

^^The tale tale signs of someone that never invested in anything before. As if the price only goes up when NEW money comes in ALSO lol at amateurs deciding after a couple months of holding or trading that NO new money is coming. Bro sell what you're holding and save the long ass rants. Go outside for a while
This is pretty close to my thinking. After we rejected 17k then dropped below 14k my long term target became 4.5k. Though the strong bounce off 6k made me question that, I may have simply been too impatient. 3.7 - 4.5k seem utterly conceivable now.

Below 3.7k (the bottom of last year's China FUD dip) seems fairly unlikely to me.

I think it's too late to hedge my cold storage though, I mean what's another 50% drop when they're already down 65%. I'd rather keep the upside and not have to administer a leveraged short even if it's a hedge. I've held them since something like $100, so whateva. 
Late entry... Stops?

I regret not adding on the bottom but there was too much risk that it'll break down. I'll probably add if we break 7.5
Did much the same for basically the exact same reasoning, buying into eth when I woke up at 550.

I'm not really sure a short squeeze would have the same effect as BTC's; any squeeze is probably going to have a quarter of the volume (in BTC) as the earlier BTC squeeze. Wouldn't be surprised if BTC got rejected from 7800 immediately following it in this hypothetical, or possibly only pushing up to 8.2k, so I'm going to try not to be hesitant pulling the trigger on exiting here.
You're making me hesitate but I think this can retest the low 7.3k before pumping to 7.8k. 

Ratio of shorts to long is lower for ETH than it was for bitcoin in april. This could factor in as well as a lot of longs could closing could reduce the effect of the shorts closing
I have the exact same plan. Thanks for sharing.
I have that line as well, but mine we are barely above it, was planning to short if we broke down into it. 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/3qMr91XD/
So, I have a theory that if you dropped out (even at a loss) after the ATH and if the value you dropped out at is higher than this, that you might be willing to FOMO in again if the market picks up and you can buy in lower.  Even if today you are saying you are done with crypto.  I believe the FOMO will stay strong.

For example, you bought at $14k, watched it go up to $20k, imagined all your paper profits and lambos, then you HODLed to $12k then bailed.  You were pissed at crypto but more so pissed at yourself for not taking profits when you had the chance.  Now if we were to go bull (not saying this is happening today), say we break $10k, everybody is yelling moon and lambo again.  Well, maybe you want to FOMO in again at $11k, telling yourself you are a wise trader, since now you have even more BTC than you had when you exited, and you are now ready for liftoff again.  Except this time, you promise to take profits at exactly $20k.  Which you won't.


[deleted]
Yes, the air is clearing. But for true bottoms to come in, we need to shake out hodlers as well, some longterm guys ragequitting.
Yes, and now the market needs to shake out the speculators (margin longs) to start fresh probably. Unless divine intervention to save their own precious wealth (but if they got in at 100$ do they care if BTC 4k or 8k? Don't think so)
Anyone who bought in fall has still nearly doubled their money. There were only a few weeks where we were over. 8k and they were in winter.
I agree that weak hands are out. But we still need enough hodler demand to counter the miner supply to gain in price.
gotta love the hopium.  xrp is still worth more than 0, so no, the normies are still part of this bear market.
Good point about plans and fomo, but you gotta trade based on where the market goes, not where you want it to go or expected it to go.
you got greedy bro. How was 7040 not low enough to pull the trigger?
Same here, been waiting for the bottom of the triangle at 6.900 since 9.9K to go long. And it is frustrating now, because you can never tell if the bull pennant forming on the 15 min turns out to be the left side of Bart's face.
For now the support hasn't been tested on bfx and I'm quite convinced the 6.5 bottom will repeat and we'll bart down there sooner than most think (maybe failing to break 7.6). So no reason to fomo now. 

I bought this bounce for a scalp but will take profit at 7.6 if it even gets there.
I don't think we are out of the thick of it just yet. one whale decides to accumulate a bit more btc at current price and everyone forgets all these dumps and down trending days. there was literally no indication to buy other than the fact bitcoin is at a "low price".

ill analyse further market conditions and buy when i see a legit double bottom.
EVERYONE thought it would go to 6.9k including me, so a big part of me wasn't surprised when it stopped early. 
Its good advice the only thing I would say you now have a possible place to stop loss that is tighter than before, it might be possible for you to buy a retrace here with a defined stop at the recent low. Since the stop can be defined closer your profile can now change.
Almost the same here, the only difference is that i have a minus signal before my PnL...  

It's life. Sometimes i lose, other times i lose more :)
I couldn't tell if it was just me watching the charts more or what but it really seems like there's a lot of big buys and sells here. We should keep track of open interest n bitmex and bfx to see 
Had the price not pumped you'd be thrilled to be in the green :\)
It fell out, though that's a likely scenario how the triangle might play out. 
Yea, the higher timeframes have lots of room to go up. We're not even up to the middle of 1d bbands, for example. 
What support line is that? 
It was the same old peanut gallery howling "goblin town," "delusional," "bag holders" and all that hackneyed stuff. People like me were telling you that a BGD or two was imminent last night. Notice how much bigger the green ones are than the red ones. That tells you all you need to know about this market.
Can you tell about tomorrow please?
If we sideways for hours, I'd be tempted to re-short. But we punched through some significant resistance. I'm sitting on my hands for now. Far from convinced, but still impressed 
So no one has called for $3K in the last 10 minutes, so you think everything has changed in this sub?

I have seen many posts about $3K and there will be many more in the future.  The chart looks about the same as yesterday, if you zoom out beyond 1m.
> I guess it’s just a seesaw of who is loud and who is quiet maybe...

Well of course. People are all biased, and very bearish people calling for 3k are not the one to suddenly become bullish because of a 400$ green candle. It's just that they become more quiet, and the bulls who were hesitant a few hours before are now confident enough to comment. 

Never understood those "now the whole sub is bullish/bearish" comments. Of course one or the other will dominate the comment section if the price action is in favor of its bias.
MM'ers really know how to play emotional short-term traders like a violin, it's pretty impressive watching. 
I'm weary of another retest of the 7k and potentially high 6's, and am waiting for a clear move about 7.6 to look at adding to long. I've closed 50% of a big long, anticipating we don't make much upwards progress this time. 

I'm still bullish and think that if we do retest 7/6.9 we bounce back up for 20% or more. Waiting for that 1D MACD cross to open a big long.
Better start buying ... won't be here long.
From what I have seen selling is easing off. However, there are some huge red candles coming in often to dump the price. To me these seems like massive market sells to get the price down. To others here it somehow always fits their TA. I think the price will take the direction the big whales wants it to take. 
I see it as more of a pennant, and the price range is getting very tight, decision time... 
Definitely a fart
I see it slow and steady at the moment. You may join in whenever you are convinced. There might be a moment when most people are convinced and it accelerate upwards much fast.

Some people get convinced easily, whilst it takes a whole lot of deal to convince others. 
Personally, I dont think this will bart. Doesn’t seem like a bart at all. 

I’m lazy and don’t want to explain why 

Edit: It didn’t bart 
So many fakeouts that people are afraid of mentioning BGD. Bullish imo. 
trust issues
We don't mention BGD's name in vain
Just a SGD so far.
When a BGD comes, buttholes quake and burn. Tis no BGD
Managed to quit my eth long at 579. I am usually emotionally attached to my eth longs, not this time. Even opened a small short at 578 :) 

Edit: Thanks for your solid analysis 
You might want to look at the VWAP indicator. (Volume Weighted Average Price) In a nutshell it is a moving average that takes into account volume 

If you enter this ticker in TradingView it will give you a combined chart of major exchanges (courtesy of @arbee101 on Twitter)

(BINANCE:BTCUSDT+POLONIEX:BTCUSDT+BITTREX:BTCUSDT+BITFINEX:BTCUSD+BITSTAMP:BTCUSD+COINBASE:BTCUSD+OKCOIN:BTCUSD1W+BITMEX:XBTUSD)/8 


So putting the VWAP indicator on that chart might be what you are after
I think you should be looking for BitFinex as that is the most cited and traded one.
Around but not trading this at the moment. Probably watching for 7800 to break or 7000 to fall and not getting chopped up (probably a good call).
He said he’s bored of BTC right now 
Sloppy’s here, stoking (pardon the pun) the fire. Chew’s taking a breather. 
As a pervasive peruser of  this sub, I miss Beastly too!
>January

Good eye, I know guys who bought ripple at 3.5 dollars. Crazy times.
And? What's the point in comparing Ripple's ATH during a mega bull run, to BTC's price month later during a bear market?

On December 17th BTCs market cap was $318 billion...Ripple's was $29 billion
incredible
Because they're looking at the log chart, not linear.

EDIT: Here's the log scale. It's at $6.910 right now.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/F7QHhmN4/
probably cause that's where the BGD started
Been wondering the same thing...
I'm looking at the volume and the selling volume is starting to get outweighed by the buying IMO. Could be wrong, but I'm getting slightly more confident. 


Alts pumping, this is going somewhere, the delusional buttholes of bears comes to mind...
We're holding under downtrend resistance. We need another $100 move up to signal breakout.
Wait and see, I get the feeling its a technical bounce but it may present good shorting opportunities if we reach the higher 7's again.
Definitely going somewhere. Its either going to reverse now or later this week. Said yesterday i'm willing to put my left nut on the line and it holds. Sorry that i'm not able to give you charts to back this up, but i'm just very intuitive trader.
Use a VPN.
I just logged in absolutely fine from the UK. It's also accused me of logging in from Hong Kong in the past as well. It reset itself eventually. 
with this momentum we go further down, I will swap from USD to EUR when we reach 1.1 USD per EUR

at least we should test if the old support holds as resistance. 
Same here, near the bottom of this flag ascending triangle formation thing.   But I also opened a short half the size of it at about 7490 and put a percentage of an alt back into BTC since it's ratio already started bleeding up here.  The longs still there because it has nothing to lose (and yet anything to really gain).

I hope the next move let's me sit on one of these sides for at least a few days but that would be too easy so it's probably going to be back to chop city.
At what price would this whole move be considered a fake out? I'm reading anywhere from $7300-7350 but that feels extremely tight.
Same. Entry at 7180 with a stop shortly above. Come at me whale bros.
>bullish engulfing

The day is not over, so we dont know if we have a close above the bearish candle. 
I would actually love it if the longs start closing right now. That would be great for a longer term (a few months) reversal.
Ridiculous. Bears love to short bottoms, not spikes!
You just buy the bottom and sell the top of the bounce like that? Pics or it didn't happen
Doesn't sound very smart

https://www.tradingview.com/x/naMauL4k
!short xbtusd close 7460
How is this is a triple bottom at all? We didn't even break below 7k.
We tripled bottomed at 6400 too, no?

If we can't push above 7500 soon (by EOD), we WILL be going down sub 7k
It's another BGD.. we all know what happens after.
I was still seeing it as resistance.  I can't post a screenshot right now though because bitcoinwisdom is acting wonky and won't let me draw any lines.

EDIT: Drawing through the high on 5/19 gives me this - https://imgur.com/a/yfnv5bj

Big bears are about to capitulate, dude. Bulls never die in this market.
Liqdatdd lol
!long XBTM18 close 7460
> All in at 7000.

I am Einstein and I approve this decision.
So you think there will be a reversal once we hit 7000?
Because it has to follow a pattern right? 
Yeah good spot to start buying. Probably will get one more flush below 7k though
Good luck. I appreciate your contributions to the sub. I'm long since yesterday and thinking whether to get out now or not. 
I don't think it makes a lot of sense to open a long here tbh. With so many longs already underwater I highly doubt this will break 7500
Yes but shorts will keep this up (for now) but I think we haven't seen a true bottom.
I mean.. on stamp we bounced perfectly off the support line. 

Also, we busted through the 10k resistance line and it’s acting as support now.

Volume is staying pretty steady after the large increase, it’s actually slowly increasing

The bulls deserve to be a little bullish. It’s not about the % it went up, it’s about the underlying factors revolving around the price. 
Alright, I'll say it then. When you're searching for sentiment within the sub you're highly likely to either 1) misjudge actual sentiment because of confirmation bias in the comments related to the short term trend or 2) fall prey to your own confirmation bias by subconsciously cherry picking sample comments. 


I'm actually really bearish on wanting to sell bitcoin right now.
lol i opened up bitcoinwisdom and all I could think was "let's see how retardedly bullish sentiment is on bitcoinmarkets today"
That's not a bullish divergence. It's not even a divergence at all. (Edit: see response below - I was looking at the wrong candles here. Still disagree overall)

- Those are not really local highs at all on the daily, they're more just blips within a downtrend, so you shouldn't be drawing any kind of divergences with those single candle bounces.

- May 28th is today, it's way too early to call a divergence.

- Even if you decide to try calling those candles "highs" on the daily, OBV is making lower highs on each of those candles just like the price is making a lower high on close. That's literally not a divergence.

- Even if the indicator WERE doing something different than the price on those days and you DID call it a local high on the daily, it would be *bearish* divergence (hidden if OBV was higher on each of those peaks).
Downvotes? I understand that you may be more bearish than me in interpreting this situation (i.e., you disagree that 6.5k will hold) but the double bullish div is an easily provable/verifiable fact that I am sharing, so not sure what's wrong with that?
We bounced perfectly from the line of 3 bottoms. Looks like it's hard to break.
90&#37; of those who are long think so. 90&#37; of those who are short do not. I don't think history is going to repeat itself in loosing the usual xx&#37; from the top \(20k \+/\-\). Not saying we won't hit 5/6/7k etc but I don't feel it's very likely given how 'established/mainstream' bitcoin already is.
I think that's very unlikely, we've bounced several hundred dollars before repeatedly during this bear and we've gone down hard hours/days later.

If this rally even breaks past 8k i'd be shocked.
Percieved bottom? Absolutely.  
Actual bottom? No chance.

Might take years or weeks to go sub 7k.
No chance
Less than 20% chance of that.
On mobile.  Where’s that at the moment?
Can you share a chart with what you mean by the 10K resistance\-turned\-support line?  Would love to compare it to my own for a sanity check
Then another higher low and another lower high, and with every new cycle the low and the high get closer to each other and finally when they meet Bitcoin freezes forever as a horizontal line at somewhere around 8k...
Now just time to form a higher low on the weekly to confirm this was the middle-term bottom. A small squeeze does not necessarily indicate a reversal is incoming. If we can break through significant resistance, possibly around $7800, then I'll change my tune.
First time we fell 70%, second time it was 45%. It is the third time now and we dropped 30%. Thanks u/imma_reposter. 
This is just the beginning.
Careful the market hasn't conditioned you to feel this way.  It only takes once for you to watch it from below as you sit on your hands in hope that the price will come back down. 
My grandpa used to say, "Never listen to your gut. It's full of shit." He was a pretty good investor.

Seriously though, be rational. Who's going to dump? Why? And why would this dump overcome the rising global pressure to buy? Are you aware of what's happening with Italian bonds and traditional financial markets? We are going up. Any dump will be weak and short-lived. Buy back what you sold. Thank me in a few months.

 I've regretted selling Bitcoin even at a very large "gain" (in fiat terms). Won't make that mistake again.
!short btcusd close 7505
> Everybody is waiting for 6.9 levels

You are right to avoid doing what everybody else is expecting, but the range of possible scenarios is unlimited. We could see another prolonged "choppy period", we could have a slow bleed, or just continue down to some unforeseen point. 
Will Add at 7.5 levels.

Good move. Sub 7k wont happen. Too ez
I doubt we'll hit the bottom as quick as we all want it unless we get some bad news coming in.
pump your brakes
Any move above 7.8k that also holds at $8k would be very bullish in my view. We’ll have to wait and see
It definitely feels bart like, but FireStorm93 posted this earlier and it’s the most detailed evaluation  of bart movement we have ever gotten on this sub, and the signs are not pointing to a bart 

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8mw5vt/comment/dzrll2c?st=JHRYVBXG&sh=968e827f

Edit: on that note, I dont think we are going to bart here. 
We just broke 7500. Let's see how far it goes
Keep me informed, you sound like the real deal. 
> Will reopen above 7800 if we get there without too much fuckery

Same boat. Now just tempted to short, but I'm expecting a better opportunity, last week we had a number of attempts at 7.6 that kept failing.
Just missed a BGD through $7.5. Let's hope it was just wave 1 of 3.
There are 3 types of stops, maybe you had the one that shouldn't trigger at this price?
I wouldn't count on any serious bounce (several %) in the coming weeks or even months. In these kind of moves it's purely driven by fundamentals and technicals can be disregarded, unless you daytrade forex on low time frames. As absurd as it may sound there's still a very big net long position on the EUR/USD pair. 'Analysts' are only now realizing and openly saying that there might be some trouble for the Euro... 


There might be some bounce if Italy and the Eurozone get their shit together but that's it. 

I don't short but if I did, it would be when the 4hr RSI approaches overbought. Not even close yet.
Well actually shorts haven't risen by too much.
WhaleCalls agrees with this statement. 
Yes I guess the short squeeze for ETH was just too attractive to pass up.
I suspect there'll be a sudden eos-selloff-dip before they close their shorts.
We'll easily go back to 7200-7300. Just be patient and don't fomo.
We could very easily be in a secular bull market as it is. 
As good an entry as you're likely to get. A "better" entry and you might just wish you hadn't gotten it haha

Good luck to you, man. 
No. It's the idiots who were dumping for the past month beginning to cover. That was just bad timing for them. According to my calculations, there's a lot of coin that still needs to be bought back.
Mystery buyer. Yeah that guy. Goddam he's a cheeky little fella.
Any SEPA transfers to bitstamp since Friday evening would have gone through at around 11am GMT today (mine did anyway). I bought just as it was rising. Maybe others felt the same (ie deciding to buy on Friday or over the weekend but hadn't anything in the exchange and had to wait for the transfer). Just a theory, this may not have contributed anything to the rise. 
Please tell it. You have my undivided attention
I thought they were adult bears?
lmao
I haven't heard that fictional story, but I did see the reality that BTC is down 50% since the start of the year.  I guess it does make sense to live in imaginary world if you can't deal with that.
Wait and see if it capitulates and set low buys. You can combine the limit buy with a OCO stop at the price you will want in anyway and cut out the noice

or you can buy 50$ worth every second hour or something like that (DCA)
DCA in, maybe spread out 10% over 10 weeks or 5% over 20 weeks. What’s your investment timeline? If you don’t need the money for more than 5 years, I would DCA in 50% between now and October then, 25% during our inevitable drop in Jan-March next year, then the other 25% at other logical points (e.g. if fall 2018 turns out worse than expected).

*This for educational purposes only and should not be considered legal, financial or investment advice.*
Ultimately 7k is a great bargain. I would at least buy some today.
Buy half
Either buy half, or even go for 1/3 or 1/4. 

DCA all the way
Asia still thinks it's worth 5% more than us chumps, you ask me if that premium would still be there if we were really going down? Historically, Asian prices will hit an equilibrium with Western prices or go even lower during a real crash. Market seems to be predicting a bounce, it's why we won't be able to break below $7,000.


who are you responding to?
Maybe because everyone knows what Bitcoin is.

I don’t google titties too often either, as I am fully aware of their existence and know how to obtain them. Doesn’t mean I am any less interested in titties than at any time in the past when I was Googling titties back in the 90s
Google trend is a lagging indicator. Public interest spikes after the price spikes, not before
Well well big green dildos have nothing to do with bull runs it's just shorts covering and longs opening on supports as they should.

So we'll see how far this can go and light some candles but it's not the end I'm afraid.
I'm obviously biased, but my thoughts are that XMR interest is going to tell you a bit more about those interested in real-world use cases.  i.e. places where people come in your house at night and take your shit or where the crooked government might freeze your assets.  BTC is still mostly speculative for profit and doesn't particularly protect you from those cases.  I believe the real organic use cases are going to favor XMR.

What word?
Seems like we're going to chase all those ETH shorts
ETC you mean ETH lol?
Which chart?

Theory is that we're forming a bull flag, but it may Bart down.
bearish imho, because of bart formation 
The more we go up here, the more bearish I get. Best would be of we retrace and double bottom.
Too early to tell quite honestly. You could always tether if it starts going back down around 7,200 and buy back in. I do think holding for now is the better idea though
Scale out would be my opinion. 33% around the 7570 horizontal resistance, 33% around upper 7.7ks and if we get through that let the rest ride and maybe you'll even profit.

That's the safest way imo. 
Wait it out. You'll be well in green by Friday.

Glad I did not hold any Euro on the exchanges, if we see EUR:USD parity would be so fck nice. 
Interesting thought.  I know there are usual avenues to do this, but I'd imagine one could short Euro with leverage through a crypto exchange using btc as the medium, right?
Nah italy is a weak country with very little influence on the world economy
Iltaly was always weak
What if the dude who wants to buy 1000 coins at $7000 realizes he might be able to buy 1100 coins at $6400 for the same amount?

Never trust order books. If anything, huge limit order walls act as magnets and pull the market towards them. The majority of the time, they're pulled long before they're actually sold/bought into. 
2000 coins is nothing if 32k longers are panicking. Selling into those walls could be wash trading too. Or they could get pulled. Means nothing man.
That's why it makes sense that we dump through it
my anus is puckered in anticipation
Assuming you're shorting because you believe it is more likely to go down than up, wouldn't it make sense to simply add to your short here at 7100? Given you believe it will go down, it seems that your expected average short price would be higher if you add now, rather than waiting for 6.8k.
!short xbtusd close 7140

Searching for a better position.
Why do people always post their positions after the price moves in their direction?
Interesting because the price hasn't been that low in 2 hours.
I closed a short and bought in at 7055 earlier. I think the bottom will be much lower later this year or next, but it's likely to be a long road down and we're due for some upward action in the short term. Another step down to 6900 or even 6650 wouldn't surprise me, but I'd rather be a little early to a reversal than late.
Yeah I suppose months of selling = a good sentiment amongst buyers

There is also very little buying pressure...
Remember when BGD meant a $1000 move? Now it's a $70 dollar move.
I think it's just a technical bounce, like the others.

I think the only buying pressure arises from covering shorts.

The RSI's are all nicely reset for further drops now.
How is that "contrarian"?   It sounds like conventional wisdom to me.
I am not the one to judge what the market will do, all I do is put stop profits in place and let it run in case it's a winner, putting the odds in my favor and accepting to potentially miss on some profit.

It could turn right back, test the support on bfx, and shoot back up, could linger around a few days, could go to 7.8, fail and break 7k. 

We simply don't know what the market will do.
> Unless people keep buying into it, it's going to be short lived.

Captain Obvious to the rescue.
Going to rip you to shreds. Remember this comment.
I should add, that not being in a short is still preferable in case we do bgd up. Depending on the bgd (if it comes at all) I might not short, of course.

Back in 3x short at 7150.
As an european trading in USD, EUR tanking brings me nothing but joy
You don't know how I feel better than most of people here thanks to this :P  
I think it's also to take into consideration : more & more people buy & hold in EU, so less for the rest of the world. People should buy till the prices are so low or Europe is going to eat all your coins left :P
I think a lot of people are still certain we'll either triple bottom or have a slightly higher low. Apart from the heavy bears, no one is really expecting a new low sub 6k. If we fall through that point, I think many new sellers will appear.
If we hit 7.55 that would mean we broke resistance and heading to 7.8.
I could totally see a ton of people taking profit at or around 10k. I think that number alone is a pretty serious psychological barrier for most after what has occured over the past 6 months.
Well, an ascending triangle is just that, repeated hits on a resistance while maintaining a series of higher lows. So if we do go back to 10k and get turned around, as long as we don't go below 7k then it'll look more like an ascending triangle.
It could be a trap but unlikely. We just had a high volume breakout of our falling wedge. We're at least going to reverse for a little while.
I'm not so sure, the volume candle is pretty nice, and despite volume being less than the earlier dumps we've managed to grind ~~much~~ higher. I think This'll run to at least 7600 which also corresponds to the r2 resistance level of our daily pivot. 

After that we'll see. 
I have the same feeling, that being said if it gets to 7600+ i'll gladly short again.
Sideways for a few days and now I'm convinced.
Gracias para Espanol. Mi Espanol de momento es no bueno.
>For me, this could be the end of the downtrend from $10K and mean the next trend reversal

I feel a little deja vu, this line seems to get repeated after every bounce.

Its gone a few % today, I mean we've only been bleeding for months, but let's forget that!
no, the alts always pump harder than BTC when BTC starts going up again

so stay in your position and just wait for the next pump 
ETH  is at ATH shorts. You do you, but if Eth does reverse course the cascade of stop losses are going to make it mirror the Bitcoin BGD.
I'm iffy on LTC but I wouldn't pull out underwater on ETH. It might drop harder than BTC in the next few days but it will recover much better than BTC. 

Also: ETH isn't an ALT.
By store of value I assume you mean store of volatility?

Great to have you here!

I'd rather be mentally disabled and wealthy, than "smart" and down 65% this year.  Sorry for your loss.
you have any reason for this? or just a thin air statement?
It is looking a bit toppy on the 15 min. Also the 15 MACD looking like it might roll into the negative. And the 1 hour MACD looking to cross bearish (this one has been bad every time since $9990 top!).
Looks can be deceiving. Somebody might be trying to entice you guys into shorting en masse. Bear traps are a lot easier to spring in this market than bull traps.
Hopium: See my post above :-)
+200% is superb and it won't be long until 0.24 BTC means very little to you.  

I took a big hit on my short as well, but stubbornly holding it for now.  Although the price certainly could be pumped higher, it will be an uphill battle for them though and the Path of Least Resistance is down.
Shooting stars are from an uptrend. This was from a bounce. It is true that long wicks above are seen as bearish but I wouldn't make much of it. Wait for higher time frames.
The delusion is real
Don't see ETH changing direction. Which alts?
Yep, further confirmation that a bounce is coming real soon.
Noticed that too, some of my alts that I bought back at 7300 or so are not hitting new lows right now, which is a bit of a surprise. Could indicate that we will have a decent run up, but not sure about it anymore. 
All i see is red

Disclaimer: I’m a delusional bull
It's been working OK for me... Although, it stopped updating the Bitfinex BCH prices, it still shows me the current price when in the chart. Sometimes the app just doesn't pick up prices for a specific website. Is it completely dead, or just not working for some specific coin and/or market? 
! Short xbtusd close xxxx

Don't edit, send PM to bot
So "buying" btc with alts doesnt actually increas the price of btc. Same way as buying into btc --> and then into alts doesnt reduce the price of btc when you do the second step and buy into the alt. A big part of the reason people feel the market is very overinflated. 

Also I would advice against holding/making moves based on what is good for the market. This can become very costly and mirrors the HODL mentality that had most people lose 50% of what they gained during the bullrun if not more when we came down from 20k. 
Sell Signal
Lets see, top 10 coins jumping 12-14% percent in a day and shitcoins jumping around the same if not double. Usually a good time to short, if even for the 'short' term.
Good time to close short was at $7100.   Good time to open short is around here or a bit higher.
[deleted]
Probabilities based on what?
The true bottom will be when we see a dragonfly doji on the daily IMO. Look at Feb 6k bottom. That’s what I wanna see

Give me a real capitulation wick of 500 or more and make sure the price doesnt stay there for more than 6-8 hours and I’m going 10x long with as much as I feel comfortable leaving on Mex
We’re definitely testing a potential reversal and uptrend. Just be mindful that if we move below $7k it’s very likely we’ll experience an extended bear trend over the course of several months.  Basically a slow bleed with a few capitulation events until we return to the mean.  All the long term indicators are actually pointing towards this as being more likely than a sudden resurgence. It doesn’t mean we don’t buck trend and move to $9k or above. But all volatile markets have a way of exceeding forecasts in both directions. 

Currently we’re still in a continuation patterns which suggests an undecided market. Moving above or below the pennant should be read as a strong signal that the market has made a longer term decision and one should expect price to follow. 
Resistance is at 7.5, we're gonna struggle again with a downtrend from 10k
According to this logic if BTC breaks 10K, then it would be extremely bearish?
I feel like I could think of more bullish moves than going below $7k.
So the most bullish move is to become bearish? 
Nice work. I’d say it’s a little safer to set a higher stop once we break 7550, I’m in the same boat but wish I would’ve added more at 7100
downvoted it but it's true.. same as every min 14 29 44 59 the shorts start taking market to get the TA guys to go along on the 15m .. Its statistically 95&#37; confidence interval. I can do math.. 
You know... Nobody forces you to stay in...
Old man yells at... Something incomprehensible
my Gdax  withdrawal went through in a few days with no issues, sorry you're having  issues 
I went through coinbase with some trepidation a week or two ago and was surprised to see it hit my bank within a day.
Abra
Kraken and coinbase both take 1day for me
Ya, I have made multiple sub<$1000 withdrawals directly from GDAX (never straight from coinbase but i would assume the same) and I see it within 1 business day unless I made the request in the afternoon. I'm assuming (since you said cashed out BTC) that you sold the BTC first, and then ACH'd the Fiat. I think if you try using the SELLING feature for the Crypto and choose bank acct, that could be a different story as it has to exchange first via market sell. 
 
Coinbase took 1-day for me through ACH. Would you care to mention which bank you use? It'd narrow down the issues.
What do you mean a meaningful followup? lol, honestly do you expect it to just keep going up to 7800? Of course it will stop as people take profits. We're way out of the 1hr BB's as well. Give it some time to rest. Come back in a few hours and if we are still in between 7.3-7.4 we could make another move up.
The second leg broke the the downtrend line from $10K that had been acting as resistance all week. We went up 4% in an hour. That's pretty significant.

Stop thinking the BGD will ever repeat. It was an anomaly due to a half dozen factors perfectly aligning. 
Give it some time, it's barely been an hour since the pump. It's wont go up $2000 in a matter of minutes in these market conditions.
Correct.
Good points, going long, thanks.
You have PTSD
A bounce to 7.8 is still a very good trade from here.  Especially the RR if your stops are directly under the bull flag forming.  The loss is miniscule, it's worth a shot.
the caps let me know you care about my well-being
Because we are forming a bullish engulfing 1D candle that makes yet another higher low and yet we should still be bearish? 
could be or could be a reversal , selling has to stop at some point even if temporary 
and you're expecting that to happen in, say, the space of a week?
I'm sure that guy would be interested in discussing network effects, network uptime, hashrate, and github activity with you if you asked. Or he would just garble out some mumbo jumbo on micro payments. 

He's just trying to make a buck like in penny stocks, but yeah, it sucks.

Edit : what is with the downvotes for our friend Mr Afraid? The statement referenced was pretty ignorant and transparent. 
He's not entirely wrong. Technologically, Bitcoin is a complete joke nowadays. Almost every single alt performs better and has more features than bitcoin does. 
Can any of the downvoters give a quick comment as to why they downvoted? I'm still learning so it would be useful to know what people's objections to this are. 
I down voted cause you asked
I use a bidet 
My money is called euro right now. So basically used toilet paper. Nonetheless I use the euro to hedge against the magic internet money at times.
I hold swiss francs. Works just fine
I lose everything and make it back by overtrading which isn't very different from holding but more fun. Getting better tho with xp.
> A vision that China lifted the ban on crypto.

The Chinese government is in the early stages of transitioning to a full fledged autocracy while working through capital controls, structural debt issues and early glimpses of domestic civil unrest. Additionally, the global economy is at the tail end of a 9 year bull market which means a bear market is creeping up. The ban on crypto isn’t going anywhere.
China un-banning it is a nice thought, but I think they're too afraid of capital flight to allow it again anytime soon. I might sound crazy saying this, but I think Xi Jinping and the ideals he represents would have to be rebuked for it to happen, ie not anytime soon... Ideally, efficacy of BTC combined with a truly free market should beat central planning given enough time, but ours is a different world than the absolutes we often imagine it to be cast in. West can't fully embrace BTC without changing itself radically, but BTC/blockchain and the paradigm it represents also threatens monetary hegemony of the existing power structure. It can't do it's job beating inefficient central planning while being held back by Western power structure. Much remains undecided as of yet. It's all still very, very early in the game.
> Blockchain technology is here to stay because money is involved. And a lot of it.

Lol.


Blockchain can survive and be implemented across business and adopted without the need for crypto exchanges.

Large corporates will very likely be using IBMs (insert other well known name) solution, which requires no tradeable token.

That’s all I got 
Yeah, bull flags flag. As in, drop. If it "flags" up, it's not a flag. 
Which traditional market is currently shitting itself...?
lol are you seriously TAing that 30 min bart?
You've been saying that every morning, haha. 
You always tell us to buy.
iirc you said btc will never be under 10k again after the bounce to 11.8k last month lol

One went up 13%, one went up 4%. I'm not seeing much similarity. 
Mate, you sound like an excited kid in a sweet shop!  Where's the chart?  Is it a fractal or something?

It's the last thing. And next time we flirt with 10K, we will be pumping that sweet thing to the moon. 10K cherry's already busted, after all, so there will be no need for bulls to be gentle.
So you're saying to expect the price to either go up, or down?
yes? Do you want to know something?

Nope. 
Thanks!  These last few months have been an amazing training ground indeed.

I won't go away, and love your posts too man!  Just gotta get some balance back for now and try to be a little less hardcore.  I had hit burned out threshold before opening this trade last week.  But I had to follow through, considering all the work I had already put into planning it (including the cumulative small losses to get into that position).

I've never been happier for my chart to not have the most recent microformation all mapped out.
Thanks.  Yes the "lost" mindset is what started the trading in the first place back in the day, and then losing trades escalated that.   Every time I'd pick back up trading it'd end in a rage quit.   Fairly far removed from that now.
Thanks!  Yes it feels quite different to be over the sucking hump, and I will to continue to try to develop these skills.
The longer term side for me is the holding stack, and whenever I happen to have some funds available to supplement that.
Thanks man!  And love your posts, they've been helpful.
Holding since 2012, just not blindly.

Holding isn't the only strategy, and paper profits are meaningless without cashing some out.  There is an ebb & flow to it all.  I improved the life of my family by spending some during the previous bear market, even with the coins only being worth a few hundred at the time.  If btc had died, I would have regretted not taking advantage of that.  I don't regret having less now, I'm just optimizing what I have, and setting goals based on previous levels.

Anyway, I can't possibly afford to buy back the sort of quantities I'm working toward trading back.
Same. I also hate saying big green dildo or dead cat bounce. It all sounds so childish.
    MiddleBand = 20-day simple moving average (SMA)
    UpperBand = 20-day SMA + (20-day standard deviation of price x 2)
    LowerBand = 20-day SMA – (20-day standard deviation of price x 2)

So, the SMA will fluctuate differently because it doesn't consider the standard deviation when it's calculated.

Another thing you are seeing is the perceived difference from the center line. That is explained by the chart's scale, which is logarithmic in my original post. Here it is when it's on a linear scale:

In terms of stress, i think its self evident that if you start lashing out at loved ones, you probably need to hire a lawyer.
This is exactly why I stopped. Making gains stopped feeling good, and I would obsess over my losses and lose sleep. Do you take a lot of breaks to clear your stress out?
No one knows where is the reversal. But the funny thing is if you trade by the predominant sentiment in this thread you almost always get screwed.
See you @ $7650 


You're defending going short on the bottom of nearly 20 consecutive days of dumping, even after that position got rekted. You're also mocking a 5% move with more volume than all but 3 4H candles throughout said dumping.

That says everything.
So delusional, right?
Delusional bears
Both plus GS trolls!
You are so cool... Whining about "bcash" like a proper Blockstream zealot.
Yeah, because buying major support and seeing it hold is delusional. That's what makes crypto awesome bears and bulls alike are out of their minds.
Thanks for the heads up.

Absolutely. If you disagree you should be posting at least as much analysis to rebuke the claims the OP makes. 
Thanks. It was a tough range to predict, however there was too much liability for a bounce at the line to justify keeping it open. 
If you have cold cuts at your house, I’ll take a 

Honey Turkey, Provolone cheese, Lettuce, tomato, banana peppers, sweet peppers, bacon, oil, vinegar, mayo, salt pepper oregano sub. 

That should do. 
Nice trade! :)
Seems like the smart play for now 
Just about two weeks. I don’t know if I’m getting lucky or what’s going on. I generally thought I was a terrible trader, but my results have shown otherwise lol 
I have no clue how I’ve been doing so well. I actually question it, considering where I was 2 months ago when I started. 

I think it all comes down to my patience for waiting on a position and not panic closing. I used to rush into positions and would have terrible entries and be underwater for a second and close.

Congrats on your gains too, you have been killing it 
Not necessarily, no.

But our recent BGD’s have almost retraced nearly 50% just a few hours/days after. The recent pattern has been BGD, then right to moving sideways for 24 hours before going back down ( So a Bart essentially ).

This could very well blast through $7600 resistance which previously has been an utter bitch to get through. I would rather miss out on another $150 movement up than to get stopped out of my position entirely 
What's that word some Bitcoin bears like to use? Oh yes, "delusional." Fits perfectly here. Not only is the stock market not going up, the whole shithouse is about to collapse into its own pit of corruption, greed, and stupidity. #BuyBitcoin before it's too late.
I've found divergences to be the most reliable when at or near significant support/ resistance zones. 

When there's overhead resistance and a bear div is formed, it would be far more likely to play out as apposed to a bear div with little to no overhead resistance, as it could easily move upwards to invalidate it. 

Apply the opposite for bull divs.
I'd actually not really call it a hidden bear div yet since the other one was a pennant, not a bounce. $8600 was the bounce and if 4h goes up higher than 60 without passing $8600 then it'll be a hidden bear div when it turns around. 

I'm personally watching carefully to see the vigor of buyers here. they really need to take this above $7.8k to inspire any sort of confidence. otherwise this is all a big flop and just bottom shorters getting rekt before we do the real dump

buy volume has been sporadic and weak aa a consistent presence - these pumps seem to be shorts with ptsd from bgd closing quickly on any sign of a move up
It's always difficult to know, but a couple of closes below the 6MA (Orange line) and if you want to be more cautious a close below the 24MA (Blue Line).

But if you want to act on it early, you can use it as an indicator to look for topping signs. Doji's, tough resistance, oversold. etc etc.

Yeah me too.  There is no cut and dry answer.  Like I said in another response divergence shouldn't be traded on alone.  It's an indicator to look for other signs and confirmations. 

This one would be invalidated if price closes above 7560.  If the bullish divergence you speak of hasn't fully played out yet that could push this over 7560 in the next push an invalidate it.

But as Sloppy said in his response.  There is more hidden bearish divergence to think about if the RSI gets over 60. With the peak at 8644.

Lots to think about and weigh up.
Fixed, thanks. I just don't see us having the steam to break 7600. Small loss if I'm wrong. Feels like a good R/R scenario. 
I enjoyed your analysis earlier. Class A work my friend. I may end up doing that if we don't rocket through 7600 but bleed up on low volume. 
Agree with haserfauld, on both counts. Ethinsider had great analysis and was very welcoming to eager noobs like me.
I'm babysitting it for now. I'll probably be manually bailing if I see us pushing through 7600. Catastrophic stops set over 7650 for now. 
No, not at all. That was almost entirely hype that was not based on the environmental realities. Massive tax changes on a global scale have to occur before BTC could reach the level of adoption needed.

Also keep in mind I'm trading to build more BTC, not more fiat. I do *want* it to succeed and *hope* it will, but it's highly speculative still. 
Hey man I'm serious, you gonna be okay if we go below $6k? 

I also don't really get how you thought $10k+ was ridiculous on the way up but think $7k is insanely cheap now o_O
I've been in BTC for about a year, but I've only been actively trading (playing both sides) since early February. 

edit: oh, and I entered it because it fascinated me as a concept and for the potential massive gains if adoption occurs.
I've literally doubled my BTC in the last 8 days by not believing in the bounces. Remember, Longs from 45 of the last 48 days are underwater. I longed this morning briefly when it seemed like there were legs behind this rally. I have changed my opinion.
He’s provided more math on this sub than you did math throughout your entire school career 
If history is to repeat itself, you should be good to buy any time in the near future 
RSI is substantially higher and it's at the peak of a short-term bull market there.
Here's that period zoomed in

https://www.tradingview.com/x/zh0YJZHl/
The "Pivot Points High Low" indicator is what you're after mate!
Political uncertainty is hammering the financial stability of Italy. The interest rate on their short\-term loans trippled over night from 1&#37; to 3&#37;. Investors are pulling out of Italian obligations / state loans en masse. This is causing financial instability an in turn hits the Euro. 
Germany may have to buy Italy to keep the Eurozone in existence...so, there’s that.  
A resource strapped world isn't going to tolerate a government that's corrupt and fleecing citizens. I'd be surprised if the Euro were around in 10 years. I'd also be surprised if several European democracies didn't collapse in the next decade.
What, down below? 
It is. Obviously a bit sad if we Bart back down, but I opened this position a week ago and that's an eternity in crypto. Happy to lock in some monster gains.

Now if only my other venture could dig itself out haha 
Yup most of them were opened after ETH dump from 560 to 500. So their average entries would be around 530ish. Expecting fireworks if eth gets close to 600
You mean in the upward direction or down?
Yes, they wont "support" a price they are not interested in with their deep pockets, which is enough to make it tank by itself (ofc market selling helps to tip a fragile situation but it just goes faster to destination).
A crackdown on Tether ranks top of my "high severity, unknown likelihood" list.
Exchanges are just following bitfinex and bitmex. Which have margin.
I sold at 14k on the way down but thanks. A little bit of money is coming in but can't overcome miners selling, people who need the money or fear it's going to 0 cashing out etc.
Very late. Taking a bad entry at my own peril due to potential. Stops about 2% down. 
I would expect BTC to reject 7800 at least initially, but my target would only be about 7600. If we broke that, I'd set stops there.

It's already starting to bleed down. Could very well bart down to 7300 here. 
That's probably quite likely, especially given the drop off $7470 since I opened. $7400 is about to fall, and I may manually cut it if we do. We may be looking at a cup & handle situation
With lines of that long of timeframe I try to consider them more as zones of $50-100 than strict lines, as many people will have the precise location slightly differently. 
Yeah, the are varying versions of this. Apparently we're right above it on BFX (what you and I use), and right below it on stamp (chewy + others use). It's an interesting dilemma, because if we're below it and respecting it as resistance, then the play is to short with stops just above. If we're above it and respecting it as support, the play is to long with stops just below.

Could be the bearish bias in me, but my lean is to short it with stops just over 7500. That said, I'm sitting out for now mostly due to the pressure cooker that is ETH right now. Too many conflicting signals. 
> Why would it recover 5 months after a major collapse when the last bubble took 1.5 years to discover the bottom

Because history never repeats. Listen, my point is not that we will turn around and rocket to 20k tomorrow... it's that enough of the small investors have been shaken out. We could indeed go to the double bubble scenario now, or some point in the future, and it wouldn't be the absurd situation of shoe shine boys getting rich. The universe just doesn't allow that. 
>Why would it recover 5 months after a major collapse when the last bubble took 1.5 years to discover the bottom?

Cuz [95% of the time](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DVt-aUVW4AATzdC.jpg ) it's had major crashes and recovered pretty quickly, 2014 was the only bear market that lasted that long, so odds are pretty good.  Not to say this won't be another 2014 because we don't know but check the history. 

Hodlers who hasn't sell by now won't sell at 5k either. Leveraged longs might be shaken out though.
Do you work for BFX?
Fall doesn't mean anything. Look at the volume, all of it was after 8k and that group is losing.
I disagree. That's easy to say in hindsight, but most people's trend line were around 6920 around this morning/last night, so thinking we had another leg down seemed highly probable. Everyone and their mother was expecting to at least touch that line. Specially, since we were forming yet another bear flag. This one broke up, previous ones were breaking down. The man stuck to his plan don't give him shit for it. 
Because my stop loss would have been under 6800, and buying at 7040 would have been more of a drawdown than I’m comfortable with.
Do you have any proof that this bounce was the result of one whale buying?
The same people still think it will go to 6.9k, including me.  I didn't hear anyone saying it absolutely would not DCB again before dropping to that level.
>It's life. Sometimes i lose, other times i lose more :)

This.
Open interest on swaps Bitmex has gone from 72k XBT a couple days ago to 87k XBT so that's quite the difference

Open interest on alts is still much much lower compared to several weeks ago 
Buy support, sell resistance. Whales don't scalp. I started buying last night when I saw multiple 350 - 750 market ETH buys.
I expected the price to tumble a bit more. Catching the falling knife for additions was part of the plan. 

Now I have profit, but no plan.
Resistance line of our downtrend from the last top around $9,900. 
It is the one down from $10K, although it slices off one rally in there to 8644 on Finex.
It's unclear, it depends if we go down or up 2%.
What I'm looking for now, is where we bounce after the next pullback, and how aggressively.

If we drop back to 7200 ish and the bounce is weak, then short will remain my play.

If we drop then bounce convincingly again at 7250 and above, I will look to open a long.
Exactly!

If we sideways, we are primed to bart back down.

RSI still has plenty of room to grow, so I would expect at least 7700 in the next 6 hours or I’d call this a failed breakout.

If we retrace back to 7k I’d say we could fall through.

It all feel a LOT like 6400 last time. And now we’re finally above the downtrend line
honestly the orderbook was so thin and from the tensor charts, it didn't look like there was ANY resistance. shows by how much it just rose by

What resistance? We stopped at resistance line.
The price action took us to 7400. Still much lower than we were a week ago.

Bears should still be confident.... 
Violin checking in. 
Agree. 

I think the " big whales" are awaiting for right moment. Ohhh well... let's see. It's Crypto so tuff to predict.

Nice exit. If I hadn't been at the gym I would've jumped on it. Oh well, still pretty good profit here.


!long ethusd close 570

Legend thank you
I'm going with Binance because it has been doing more volume than all other exchanges.

https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/#markets
Ahh thanks. Yeah prolly for the best
That was a great pun 
That is log
would be too crazy if we get than a BRD and everybody starts to panic after it. the whale collects than the cheap coins as he sold for profit after his BGD... that is how the whales like to do it. 
Ye idk, normally we get a fakeout around these hours. Gotta wait for us open for a more clear direction
There you are
Was just going to ask your take on this move but just received a notification you closed your short.
Will be there
Yea this is going to be an ultra juicy short.
Yeah UK isn't blocked however so no need for it as yet.
Good to hear. But yeah they should ideally fix this shitty thing. Someone's is gonna be locked out of their funds due to this error.
I'm going close to 7.3, below resistance that we broke. Another push at 7k may break it so I won't like holding underwater there.
It's all chop between $7-7.8k

edit: actually id say below $7370 and it starts looking like it was a fakeout, <$7300 and I'd be wary of holding a long

keep in mind we've never chopped around in here  before and every range of chop has been lower. 

every time we recover from a large drop the range of chop is lower. 

$11-13k, $10-12k, $8-10k, now $7-8k

I don't think that is so certain. We could stay rangebound for a while. Personally, I think we're in a secular bull market and the bottom is in.
If we can't push above the ATH, we may go down.
That would have been the double bottom on the larger timeframe.
I love predictions like this if we cant x then we MIGHT y.

I think we are very very close to a reversal.
yes, just like the entire rest of the market. Just like everyone thought $10k+, $11800+, $20000+ would be bullish af. 

But no one showed up when it was time to put their money where their mouth was. 

Just like right now, buyers will defend the fuck out of this price point and ultimately fail again 

When the market is that unified but can't follow through, it won't happen 

imo
Meanwhile the selling intensifies
We seem to be grinding up a bit, so I’d see what ends up happening here. Maybe take a bit off? 
Same boat.  Long BTC at 7100 and ETH at 520.  Shorts have been steadily climbing without much price action, the giant triangle on the linear touched without breaking again, and I just have the feeling some pain is in order.  I’ll bail on any move 2/3% against my cost.
Same, still expecting us to hit at least 6.9k
except more than 12 hours later and we’re still not above 7500. Very good place tl short, but could easily go up as well. rsi on shorter timeframes reset too
I may be missing your points but (a) the daily for May 28th has closed 3 hours ago and (b) a bullish divergence in a downtrend needs higher lows in the indicator while the price is making lower lows?
Bottom isn't confirmed yet. But if it is a bottom then it is quite bullish. The reversal from 2014-2015 crash was a triple bottom.
On bitstamp yes but on bitfinex I have it at 6916
And considering triple bottoms are rare as a MF in bitcoin, that’s extremely bullish. 
Comments like this make me want to go all in
If it doesn't happen within the next year it probably won't ever happen. 
Years or weeks lol... nice range. 
This guy maths
Might take weeks to go past $15k too. This is Bitcoin, after all.
Based on what? Are you about to sell 50K BTC?
7385 on bfx, my line omits the May 20th breakout.  sorry, no time to make a clean chart to show this and my main chart has like 20 other lines on it from the last week.

Edit, since I'm not sure which line you meant.  7385 is where I have the resistance-turned-support from 10k.
On bfx around 7340 but it's still below on stamp and kraken
Sorry it's a mess and I only have time to add an arrow for you: https://imgur.com/a/9XJoPLW
How can you drop more than 100%?

Yup hence the low leverage so that I don’t liquidated or killed by funding fees 
I agree, I think it's going to be a long slow grind down. Bottom in about 3 or 4 months for me.

No major bounce for me when it's over either. I'd be happy just to get back to about 8k by Christmas 
Nothing else to do right now
Good call. He is the real deal. 
We meed to get above 7750. Since we crossed that line, we have not recovered it. We go to 7740-ish, and then fell 10%. We need to recover some ground before buyers regain confidence and don’t close their longs at the horizontal resistance lines
Protip: stop shorting and start longing. You'll make way more money, and it's a lot less stressful. 
A BGD of $70? What is that? A BGD for ants?
Oh, you were right, im always using the mark price. Maybe it was lagging.
Thanks for the insight. Forex is not my forte. Just charted EUR/USD and saw that it might get ready for a technical bounce.

I just don't really understand how the Euro could fall 1000 points in 1 and a half month.
Props to whoever posted that yesterday and i wish I would have acted on it.
Can you elaborate?
When you FOMO, you contribute to the BGD and therefor your actions are positive.
$7550-$7625 I’m eyeing for a short entry. 

You? 
Thanks man. Might be pushing my luck but I'm fine with the risk though. It's a super small entry, if it falls harder I'll go big for the 6900 test.
Shorts are almost exactly where they were a month ago and only 5% up from where they were at the beginning of our dump last week. 

But your calculations sound scientific, so I'll trust you.
> No. It's the idiots who were dumping for the past month 

Damn those idiots and the profitable trades they have made, grr
>  It's the idiots who were dumping for the past month

You are looking at a different chart than BTC.  BTC is way down over the past month.
If you have been watching the books the last week it is clear the bears have been trying to kill this market.  The only reason they are failing is because someone has been buying up their coins and they have a lot of stamina.
Well, not to bore you with a long story, I'll just say - all the bear cubs died tragically under the hoofs of angry cattle.
I guess that was for me ;)
Whoops. /u/v4mpyre
Everyone and their dog knows to use video sites to search for tittes

It's true, how often does anyone here just search "bitcoin"?  I don't think I have in a very long time.
public interest is one cause for price spikes, no?
Mutha fuckin triple bottom Bitcoin reversal!
about the bird
Yep. Corrected.
ETHUSD


I dont think this will bart down before making another attempt on going upwards. Often a squeeze or breakout (ish) like this have a beartrap or consolidation period before making a 2nd or 3rd attempt to continue before reversing back into the previous trend.
Forgetting about italy, spain and deutsche bank.
Wrong! Italy is in the top 3 country's of Europe's largest economy. If Italy is going to be a 2nd Greece it could be fucked up for Europe and the Euro.
Italy has lots of pizza \- they sell good for bitcoin!
8th largest in the world I think 
True. Its a bad idea to look at the books, but when it got close like 12 hours ago,under 7100 that wall wasnt moving and they got down to like 7070 when I was watching. That with a second layer wall just has me thinking/hoping we break past the 7600 level and go to 8800 over the next threeish weeks.
>What if the dude who wants to buy 1000 coins at $7000 realizes he might be able to buy 1100 coins at $6400 for the same amount?

Or conversely. The guy willing to sell 1000 BTC @ 7000 realises he can buyback @ 6400 to collect 90+ more BTC.
I had to translate that word \(puckered\) to get a good picture of how it is, now I understand. You're just as prepared as I am.
Yes, as my tag says, I'm a Bitcoin *Skeptic*, so I believe the price will go down because I'm skeptical. But I'm not confident enough that it won't bounce first to sell a bigger position. I'd be more inclined to wait for a better entry if I weren't trigger happy. I think there's still a good chance at a bounce but I'm *skeptical* that buyers will sustain the a move upwards at this point. Bitcoin ded, as they say.

Because that's the way things work around here.

We have a wealth of genius traders here \(or so they like to portray\), with amazing abilities to predict tops, bottoms and everything else...after the event.

You just need a chart with various lines drawn over it, then afterwards you make what's happened fit your narrative.
I actually bought on the way down 
I bought like an hour ago.. just posted it here now because I don’t feel the need to tell the Reddit community as soon as I buy
Opened a long at $50. Sentiment seems pretty good.
I'm sure it was under 7100 on bitfinex within the last 20 minutes. 

Anyway, my short from 19.9k sure feels comfy right about now. 
nah it was like 10m ago, although yes he posted after the pump started lol
Yup.  Let’s get another one of those please 
It's a sliding scale.
May be the way of doing it is different now.
and yet 'experts' are still are calling $35K-$50K end of year. just want to know how in the world we get there!
Love how bearish it's gotten in here, MM'ers have done their emotional work got their liquidity and we can probably move up now. 
I agree that it's good if you trade in USD. But a strong dollar is not good for Bitcoin and it's even worse for the cost of living as a European. 
Same situation! 
Yeah I have EURUSD bookmarked in tradingview along with my alts. Weak EUR yay !
No It's because the Euro is tanking, has nothing to do with Europeans buying crypto or holding. 
That's what happened last time.  It is not likely to bounce nearly that high again, because so many people will know it is a DCB.  And by "know" I mean it's very high probability.
You'll be lucky to see $10k in the short/medium term or anywhere near that.
we are in agreement.  
I'm looking forward to June. Maybe it's just the old saying "sell in May and leave"
I agree and that's the reason I bought alts, but there is some speculation on here that "alt days are over." Let's just ignore the "alt days are over" panic right now, and I don't see a pump on the horizon anyway. I'm trying not to panic sell but it's damn hard right now.
The main difference is the price is actually going down. BTC wasn't. Shorts increasing while the price tanks is bearish, although eventually it will provide strong support. It just depends how long those shorts hold out 
BTC will become less volatile and more stable over time. Bad for traders, good for adoption.
You can never quite be sure when hyperinflation is going to happen.  
Slowly at first, and then suddenly, all at once. Just ask Venezuela and Zimbabwe.  
  
I think a lot of price drop so far this year has to do with looming US interest rate rises. We'll see if the global economy can sustain it. With China reducing reserve ratio requirements, advent of petro-yuan, and Trump trade war, feels like it all has turned into a giant game of chicken, much more so than 2017 did, at least.  
  
It definitely is extremely volatile though, as you've stated.  
Still, I'd rather hold BTC than gold.  
He's incredible
dump it, pump and paint ze bullflag then dump it again
You'll have to speak up, I'm wearing a towel.

LOL, it's just that I like to elaborate a bit when I'm posting my positions :P
yeh i dig it, expecting we go down too and decided to close off big long was holding onto. Gona reenter lower as still quite confident in a big move up. This smells like a bull trap, not the right one for me.
Guess you aren't following many crypto people on Twitter :p Basically this is a problem since some months. Literally every message from a somewhat prominent crypto person gets these fake account tweet replies trying to scam. Pretty insane Twitter cannot properly handle/block them.
> seems like a flawed strategy to attempt to use bad data to make good decisions.

Fair point. I would like to see statistics of both (sentiment + actual trades). Users misstate their trades to look cool after the fact, though, so I can't see any way to get those data reliably. What we have that is reliable, is the stated expectations before the fact, which more often than not are wrong. At least, that's my impression. (edit: grammar)

Can confirm
I'm actually up quite a bit this year. Highest buy was $7.5K, lowest $6K. And I'm up a lot more than that over a period of years, buddy. Your little 5 percent-gain white-knuckle scalps don't impress me at all. But I'm glad you're happy being mentally disabled because I can't really help you with that.
> I'd rather be mentally disabled and wealthy, than "smart" and down 65% this year.

You would? What a strange choice.

 I would choose smart and down 65% over "mentally disabled" literally every single time.

Mmmmmm MMMH that is the sweet nectar of the Gods! Thanks for the hook homie, but my pants are still quite heavy
It won't be long until 25 million satoshis will represent a substantial chunk of change. People on this sub will be kicking themselves hard for these little losses in a couple years. Once you understand the mechanics of this market, it becomes clear that long is the only way to be for the majority of the Bitcoin one buys. Even closing a short, the goal should be to end up with more BTC than you had when you initiated the position. Dollar gains are meaningless in the bigger picture.
Thanks and I hope that will be the case and not only because of a plummeting value of bitcoin.  I'm relatively newish to actively trading but I have learned some important lessons and I think that as long as I keep learning from my mistakes and not repeating them I will have continued success.
ahh, "delusion" the favorite word of the bears. "deelooozhen" flows like honey on a bear's tongue. mmm... delusional honey...
Eth still hurts from EOS dumps.

ADA, ont, icx, iota, xlm, ltc to name a few. Even Nano. Check the 1h charts. 
Can you specify your prediction? When is "real soon"? How high bounce? And based on what technical analysis?
fellow delusional, you should check the satoshi values, many are gaining. Some are in green. delusional delicious green.
All my BTCUSD pairs from major exchanges have stopped in the 7160 range. Been like that for hours.
You're totally wrong.  Any demand for btc that results in a purchase of btc will increase its price.

For example.  If there are 100 apples at a produce stand for .50 cents each and I sell 100 oranges for .50 cents each I now have 50 dollars from selling the oranges.  If I use that 50 dollars to buy all the available apples, no one else will be able to buy apples from that stand.  

When people buy btc. and then trade btc for an alt it is neutral for the price of btc and positive for the price of alt.  What matters in that example is that the initial purchase of btc was made using a source of value outside of the market.  Usually dollars or some other country currency.  

My move is an attempt to hedge and defend my position.  It's the optimal trade given the position of the market.  

Again, what you don't like about the trade is that it's a direct attack on bears and their short positions.  You're making your post to try to confuse people so that they feel like they aren't "supposed" to, or "allowed" to, or "should", make a trade that hedges their overall self interest.

Basically bears want bulls to play "fair" while they shit on the market.  Save your FUD and "helpful" advice for suckers.
>So "buying" btc with alts doesnt actually increas the price of btc. Same way as buying into btc --> and then into alts doesnt reduce the price of btc when you do the second step and buy into the alt.

Why would you think some types of buying add demand/reduce supply and other types don't? Buying and holding raises the price no matter which other asset you use to trade for it. Selling increases the supply and thus reduces the price, it doesn't matter what you get in exchange for selling.
I’m waiting for $7800. Resistance is twice as strong in that range than this area.

10x safer R/R
tempted to open a short term short soon. lets see how 7600 plays
No. Not a good time to open a short. Not a good time to be in a short position. At all.

Edit -- we went up $50 in the 10 minutes since I made the above comment.  Not to brag, but I'm someone you might want to listen to.
I have not seen much downward momentum in the last 2-3 days. I was expecting a BRC earlier to complete the so called bart formation, not anymore. 
gut feeling i'd imagine.
Probabilities based on the market behavior during the past week or so. *You know it is adapting every hour.*


I am not calling it a bottom yet, neither do I think that the next bottom has to look just like that of February's one. Expectations are mostly left unfulfilled. 

You may choose to stay out of position, but thinking the market has to convince you to make you feel comfortable to get into a position, I do not think that would be the case as the market does not really evolve around a single trader. :)
textbook triple bottom bro, with a capital T.
Yeah you see the test is going on and I very much agree it could be a lot different, perhaps unimaginable if it moves below $7,000. 

I think it will be rather difficult to move the price down due to the fact that we were so close to breaking it at around $7,040, yet the price decided to move upwards. The pattern is clearly broken and today we are seeing something new which we haven't seen in the past few days. 

Given the fact many are expecting a bottom around here, things also point in the direction if one might look that there is a possibility of going further up short-term. 

We are already trading $500 above $7,000 (as of writing). 
thanks v4mpyre
*when BTC breaks 10K* -- fixed that for ya, and yes. It will be extremely bearish. Everyone please short like mad!
7.5 will break 10k downtrend, 7.8 will be a bitch to break, 9k will break 11.7 triangle.

So below 9k there's nothing to talk about.
I'm looking for a big gain on this one. Will sleep well and probably move my stop up in the morning. Asia isn't stupid. They're not going to sell overnight.
I mean if you say stuff like 

>Wonder why they want 'more' coin of something so useless?

You're just begging to get downvoted. 
I don't follow. Can you rephrase?
First sale I ever did on Gdax only for 1K and still nothing a week later. Shouldnt be that hard to sell.
I did indeed sell the BTC first then transfered the funds via ACH
Chase
... or days. I think bulls would like to accumulate in this range. They'll wait for better prices.
What do you mean no lambo?!?!
I see us as below that line.  There was a spike above it that lasted less than a minute, but that's it.
This is bitcoin never say never...
It's been more than an hour.  It's been a few hours now.
The more downvotes the more bearish I get lol
Selling doesn't "have" to stop till $0
there's nothing particularly surprising about someone being completely disillusioned with crypto after enduring the past 6 months 
Except they only cost like 10k an hour to 51% attack. BTC is still most secure. Most would be equally bogged down by BTC's traffic anyway: ETH is capable of what, 3 to 4x transactions? Not that much improvement for a much larger attack surface (see: the DAO). And BTC has much better network effect, adoption, and is finally making progress on second layer. It also has no leaders and therefore is the most decentralized. It has its flaws but BTC will be #1 in the market for a while, and will keep that position indefinitely if lightning network gets off the ground. There's too much room for disagreement about "is code really law" for ETH to be the reserve currency. 
Hundred bucks says people will still be saying this in a decade.
Go on....
probably  has more to do with reddit culture: "downvote me, I know you will!" usually encourages downvoting

but it could also just be that people don't like hearing a bearish prediction
They're bullish and this is a huge red rag!!
Ripple?
The "official" ban may not be lifted but the Chinese will find a way. Do not underestimate them. It's literally an untapped goldmine. 
So much money in China trying to get in right now. I travel there every month and I see more and more people are finding ways to invest.
They will coexist.
blockchain is just another word Database. if it is not decentralized, neutral, censorship resistant then it is just slow shit and a Database. decentralized consensus, bitcoin, thats the innovation
I made a nice win so let me brag a bit and be happy. Don't be a mean herd of jealous snowflakes. I agree these kind of move can turn very bad as well, but this is war mode. Kill or be killed. Only 50% of my trading stack but still.
I usually rarely go above 5x lev.
Those with a little foresight see Italy and the Eurozone ‘this is fine’.
Doesn't matter that it's 30m, but that was $50 move.
Of course I TA'd it.  That's how I roll.
you'll find out why, shortly.
yea, but not FUCK'N BUY!

Sorry someone needs to hold your hand in life...
stay tuned ...
It was green too, how can you not see this?
Yep, the new shorting opportunities are terrifying 
I feel this is actually correct because I was planning to sell at around 10k this time to be safe and by the time they get an idea in the public's head they go against it to make the most money.
I think mostly this is a DCB so down
Bears have been trading the chart, but even if they haven't, it sure has worked out for them over the past week and past month...and all year, of course.

$7400

David Hasselhoff?
It should be black for him... And huge... Maybe then he'll shut the hell up...
BGBP?
That's a fact! So this will be a third time.
if we're playing %, seems like $8800-$9K would be the top of this "rally" but not sure how this pump has enough legs to get there. 
Might go to 8.2K or 7.8K to test resistance there but first things first 7.6K and 7.5K resistance. Dont know how high but switched to long earlier mid BGD today and have been holding since. Will scale out and into a short after the next breakout (if there is one)
bunch of sour grapes. nah btc just made my call correct. go long with confidence fellas sub7k aint happening
I always get you mixed up with crypto_investor7
Keep it up brah. Don't get cocky and take profits!
hey thanks I appreciate it
Of course, the logarithmic scale explains it. Why didn't I think of that. Thanks for taking the time to explain this!
No, just not healthy to miss out on sleep and other parts of your life due to trading/watching charts.
I didn't kill her, just chopped her legs off and ate them.

Your fantasies mean nothing.  The chart is the reality.
> You're defending going short on the bottom

Nope, that's what you are desperate for me to have said, but I didn't say that, as all can see above.

Congrats on your losses decreasing by 5%.  Now only 63% for the year.  And 25% in the past three weeks or so.
Um, yes of course.
VER LOST, GET OVER IT!
Deelooozheenal, period!

Notice that we bounced off support made from previous bottoms. I'd say we may try to test top of that triangle first before we go down again to 7k. But if you're right then we may fall right through it this time.
I read demagoguery and democracy per your suggestion, excellent stuff there bud, thanks for that.

Thanks for excellent TA! :handshake:
Yeah maybe I'd pay closer attention to my risk / confidence in that situation \- as on a roll of good trades myself I remember getting a bit too confident near the end. None the less congrats \- I'd review what you felt you did well and note it down in a trading journal if you have one.   


All the best for the next 26!
Yep!! Well said, mate
Interesting, must read up on it. I only trade based off support/resistance lines. 

Maybe it’s time to increase my knowledge  
Buyers show up, keep the price up for X amount of time until they slowly give up with a slow bleed that leads to a BRD. 


Yep, i see what you're saying.  Good call, will watch out for this in future!
I say ballsy cause technically we broke resistance and building a bull flag.

Practically I'm struggling with decision here.
Actually I'm putting my money where my mouth is and short from 7490 too, foot is already off the gas pedal on this thing.

No SL low lev liqui 11.9. Will see tomorrow where we stand.
Ah okay I thought you were scaling into a bigger short. That's at least what I'm trying to do here with bail points above 7.8k or 8.2k depending on how strong this looks. 
> Massive tax changes on a global scale have to occur before BTC could reach the level of adoption needed.

Oh, I'll be fine Sloppy. What you're about witness in the coming hours/days/weeks/months is nothing short of amazing.
Do you not think 6-8k BTC is reasonable? 

It's not about the money, for me (well, like 80% tech + 20% $$$).

Good luck man!
no need to talk about how much money you're making with these guys lol they don't understand. I mean this literally, I don't think they actually understand you can make money (and more bitcoin!) off bitcoin going down 

I really think it's a religion for them. it's more like a faith in a god than belief in an asset 
If you take the RSI and momentum indicators out of the picture it looks closest to 2014. Just saying that the picture doesn't exactly look bullish, including or excluding the fact that volume and volatility are low. 
Ok thanks much, very helpful!
Around 7050-7100, that was support.
Yeah the other venture is indeed a cringe to look at right now.

I reset my trading stack to an initial amount and put some of that into the bot and did some manual dca there but it only made a small dent.  I also manually realized some losses and scalped them back in a little lower making another small dent.  But still -12% to go after this pump.
As they're shorts, when they cover they spark an upwards move that could cascade as was the case when BTC shorts were at an ATH last time when we were at 6400. It's not a given though, but as they increase while price moves up the likelihood increases. 
then why does gdax lead often ? 
Yeah Buddy we all sold right before it dropped. Great idea, you're the first to ever make a super long post and then add "I sold right before the drop".

Stops above 7050 don't make too much sense, it may bounce again so watch the market when you get stopped.
I'd say we're still very much within the flag... Still obviously could break down.

Also keep in mind the last short squeeze on BTC's chart had a fakeout breakdown of a bull flag before the squeeze.
Agreed, I'm sitting it out. I think we might get a better entry.


It would be absurd. Hitting new highs means even more dumb money than at 20k. Where is this coming from? Coinbase was the #1 app, how do you go higher? Are there other Korea's waiting to come online?

The deflation process requires everyone to sell or accept their losses down to a final price of $0. A million coins have to turn over. This takes time.
>Hodlers who hasn't sell by now won't sell at 5k either.

*confirmed*
I do not 
I think you are confusing trading for OTC purchases. Account creation started surging last summer. Speculation took off after organic market growth. Leveraged trading also exploded in popularity in winter. The timline absolutely matters.
>Everyone and their mother was expecting to at least touch that line.

I believe game theory came into play here precisely because of that reason, so it bounced early. If the price plummets from a higher range towards the support swiftly, it will likely touch, but the bear steps down gave people time to plan.

Also the bear flag broke sideways and was not really a flag anymore as the sideways action had outgrown the length of the pole.

>The man stuck to his plan don't give him shit for it.

This I agree with though
Im not giving him shit. Im saying he stuck to a greedy plan is all
fair enough.

It’s usually a safe bet to go in a couple hundred above the support line. Sometimes the bounce is below support, sometimes above it. I’d say you got greedy when 7040 to 6800 is barely 3% difference
This, suggest people zoom out a little, a few &#37; gain does not signify all is rosy.
Daaaaaaang. This move gon' be eXPLOSIVE!

That's because they wash trade scam coins.
Interesting. 
The relative strength of that pun was definitely in overfunny territory.
Both Huobi and OKex seem weirdly buggy to me. I don't feel super comfortable parking myself on either and probably wouldn't put a decent amount on there in case one of their quirks screws me proper. 
Should be watching the daily and the Altcoin threads. Let me know if it happens again so i can test in the alt thread. 
It's erroneous to call it a holiday engulfing before it closes, was I think his point.
I agree the bottom is in
The current move is of course way too insignificant to confirm anything. I was just being facetious. 
agreed
fine, then we will.

I just used a word, its not like I think much about how I word my comments. I predict that if we dont get above 7500 by eod, we WILL go down.

ya hayeenah
Reversal? I don't think so, but a temporary DCB is definitely in play.
Just out of curiosity, what’s leads you to believe that? 

Edit: 

Bullish signals I can find:

-4h bullish divergence. 
(can be washed out with a dump below ~$6,900)

-RSI dipping into +|- 30 range.  
(bounce and sideways action will reset it a bit)

I’m leaning towards the bear case but I would legitimately like to know if I’m missing something.
Hold up. Something got us that high in the first place. It’s just that people have enough confidence in their line drawinf abilities to not buy at 11.5k or 9.9k when the resistances lie there.

Longs closed, shorts opened and down we went

I would think it’s more an exhibition of herd mentality that buyer impotence

Also, the same can be said for seller at 6.4k. They could have dumped it sub 6k, but didn’t
Yea I hear ya- I recently learned about [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_ruin). Made me think a lot about the day trading culture surrounding BTC, in particular, how most hands playing are small hands, and how it could be useful to view the market from that perspective.  
  
This support line a shade below 7k is a pretty significant one I think. It's hard for me to see where enough new money is coming into the space to keep it from going under for now. Buying power has felt muted to me since CCs got cut off from the supply line.
We really won't break the February lows on this attempt, stop being such a perma bear. Probably in a couple of weeks though.

Selling is not intensifying, it has been low most of the time on the way down. Buying is even more pathetic
We bounced pretty hard off 7050 earlier though.

Yes, I'll do that, while we watch this play out. 
Nice entries. Good luck! 
Yeah I had my time zone screwed up, misrepresenting the days on my candles. My bad.

Stand by my first bullet though, and May 28th made a lower low on OBV not a higher low, assuming this candle is green.
I'm not saying it is, I'm saying we bounced on support that was made from previous 2 bottoms.
Everybody was looking at the same line, makes sense for people to frontrun it
I don't use finex to chart, difference is too big, they sometimes go with big premium or big discount.
It's not a triple bottom if it doesn't complete.
https://imgur.com/4351mN6

It wasn't triple bottom, it's a triangle.
Go for it then! :)
Based on the chart...and the fundamentals...based on reality.
Thanks.  Yes, I was referring to the 10k downtrend.  
no that's perfect, I can see where you are getting it from now.  thanks!
This is drop % from the top to bottom, not sure what is the right term for it. Drop from $20k to $6k, then from $11.7k to $6.4k and so on.
yup, been going down for 6 months, but you're encouraging people to hold.  I am flat so i dont have a dog in this fight, but telling folks what to do at $7k+ BTC in a 6 month down trend is a bit asinine.  Let the guy be.  If you're holding from $200 good for you, but it is not likely this thing moons anytime soon.  

Edit: wonder what it is like looking down from $19k hoping the price comes back up.  Christ.
thats what I am hoping for.... trying to buy at the bottom... don't see it going much lower than 6.5k though
!short btcusd 7505 1x 50%

Screw this. Put half the stack back into fiat. Resistance at 7530-7570 seems to hold for now. Bear div on 1H etc.

I remain skeptic of this bull run but will happily close this hedge at a small loss if 7650 breaks to the upside.
Yes. Let the market decide and then follow direction. Much less stress than trying to forecast and take positions too early. 
A classic price point. It could be a matter of time perhaps before buyers regain confidence and do not close their longs at that point. 
I just closed a short from 8 days ago for about 100% ROE on my stack. But yes, celebrate a 4% bounce on a 30% drop. Longing is way more profitable. 

Fun fact: unless you opened your long in the last 3 days, if you'd opened it any time in the 45 days before that, you're underwater. 
I’ve shorted 22 times in a row and made over 100% of my stack back. 

Sir, what are you talking about? 
If you want to invest, that's fine, just buy and hodl. If you want to trade, you need to long and short. Market likes to go both ways.
Haha awesome. In my defense, I was typing something else then saw the 'GD' starting and assumed it was B. Hit submit before it wicked back down and felt like a dope. I left the comment though so everyone could roast me. :)
Mark price is supposed to be lagging so that your stop won't execute prematurely. But Mex engine is also lagging and may execute stop with slippage...
I was one of the posters :)
Sell to drop price before rapidly closing shorts.
I'm aiming for exactly that. $7575ish

If it breaks $7700 I'll close. 
I'm not sure I want to short this yet. IMO if this is all a DCB and we're heading back to break our support line, there will be a lot of opportunity to short on the way down. Breaking the downtrend from 10K that we'd been respecting pumps the breaks on this downtrend. I'd rather short 7500 and bail over 7550 than open at 7550. 
The best part about your entry is that you caught an entry just over a descending resistance line. If we continue to honor it, you can slide your stops down that resistance line further and further into profit stops. The next couple hours should be interesting. 
Short \-\> drive price down \(sell\) \(past month going down\) \-\> cover short?
I guess I'm "someone" buying up their coins. They underestimate global demand. That's why the big bears are failing. Will be fun to watch them cover, making us richer at their expense.
Do you mean there is actually some powerful coordinated bears trying to sink the market, or just bear traders shorting as usual?
That someone is definitely mystery buyer.
Lol what "someone"? Do you mean the market? 
> Well, not to gore you with a long story

yes, they know

Those who were in at 20k run already know.
i Google it about 3-4 times a week when researching or looking things up. 

I don't just Google "bitcoin" I Google it with related words 
Smart money / Whales causes the initial pump. Public then fomo.
The market is about $4,200 shy of confirming that. 

I'm not saying it won't happen, but you're celebrating about as prematurely as it's humanly possible to celebrate. 
Right - I mean what timeframe.

We're between two lines, this may do anything here.
Italy has more industry than France.
\*holds hand\* been waiting for a while, no need to be gentle
So why do you feel the need to tell us after the event?
I'm not really having a go, congrats on your good trade so far, it looks like its going to get sold into again so I'd be taking my profits if i was you.
Same, I shorted June futures when they were at $25000 100x. Got pretty luck there, I guess.
Yeah I look at Bitfinex charts but don’t use their platform to buy
The same way BTC went from $3,000 to $20,000 in the span of 22 weeks.

Lots of FOMO combined with a complete and utter disregard for logic and reason. 
You're right. At the same time I think we're going down some more, then some more again before retesting 8200+ for a final gasp
Bitcoin save us all
A strong dollar is bad for imports, but It's good for exports. Depending on what country you live in (import/export balance) this can not be necessarily bad. 
Even if the Euro is tanking, all I see is the price is higher than when I bought so I'm still in profit. The counterpart is : I could buy more if it was cheaper.
Edit: I just realized I've saved value thanks to bitcoin
If almost all expect it. I expect us to go to 12k.
Well, I've been lucky with Bitcoin a whole bunch of times now. Have seen it double in a month or two at least ten times. 10K has already had its cherry popped, as has 20k, and both will spread their legs again for a good pumping. You can be sure of that.
The man from the future 
I was speaking in no particular time frame but yes I agree with you on that. Lower highs is the trend right now until something drastic occurs.
that speculation always shows up during bear markets, thats why alts dump at 2x compared to BTC because the order books are paper thin. 

but just the same way there are no buyers on the way down, there won't be any sellers on the way up once a breakout happens. 

I've seen my fair share of garbage alts that developers stopped supporting, yet these still pump like crazy as soon as BTC stops dumping 
Why would alt days be over other than wishful thinking by btc maximalists?  We just had an incredible alt season as btc anemically went to 10k.
They're not over. Only just begun

Don't feed the trolls, I think you are right here!
Wait, how is that a bear flag? I see a short-term bull-flag (although it has an upward slope)
It’s been a bear fest since December...where’ve you been?  
[removed]
>  save all the mentally disabled shorts

Shorts are up about 50% this year.  
yes, mentally disabled in quotation marks.
sorry I didnt know people could foresee barts before they happened. looks like a bull flag to me. but who really knows.
Actually the opposite is unfortunately true and 0.25 BTC will be worth less and less in the coming years.  Once you understand the reality of this market, it becomes clear that this is the case.  Even when closing a long, the goal should be to increase your wealth over time, which means more fiat value, not BTC.
I was a crappy trader for years..maybe decades and now I'm just moderately decent at it.  So sounds like you are doing very well and will continue to improve.
Daily RSI \(plus other longer frames e.g. 4hr, 6hr, 12hr\) are oversold. Plus we're approaching the strong support area of 6.8k, I doubt we go straight through it on our first attempt.

We've been falling for over a week without any significant bounce, if you think they're going to make it easy for all these shorters, think again.

I think a bounce will take us to 7.8k, not sure about what will happen after that.

And I don't know how soon, if i did, i wouldn't be here.

Edit: That being said, I'm not in a position yet. We could very well keep dropping to 6.8k or lower, but a bounce will come regardless. I'd rather wait to see a promising pump \(followed by alts recovery etc.\), and then jump onboard.
don't forget "delusional".
BTC dominance was 39,98&#37; and is now 39,84&#37; according to coinmarketcap. A bit fast to say that they are gaining share back...
Oh, yeah. I just checked again, and the tickers seem to be off. They froze at some point. But it displays the true current price when you go into the chart for one of them. I'd recommend shooting the devs an email. It's probably a line of code they need to change to make this better.
>For example. If there are 100 apples at a produce stand for .50 cents each and I sell 100 oranges for .50 cents each I now have 50 dollars from selling the oranges. If I use that 50 dollars to buy all the available apples, no one else will be able to buy apples from that stand.

Sorry, but you're wrong and he's right. Mostly. Because that's not what you're doing.

It's more like this. You're in a market place. There's two stands selling apples and they all have 100. One stand only accepts oranges for payment and the other accepts money. Meanwhile, there is a third stand selling oranges for money. \(If you can't follow, the apple stands are the btc/fiat and alt/btc ones and the orange stand is a alt/fiat one\). Unfortunately most people don't like buying oranges with cash and would rather buy oranges with apples.

So you have 10 oranges to sell; right now, the apple/orange stand will give you 2 apples for 5 oranges and then 1 apple for the next 5 oranges; after that it'll cost 10 oranges for an apple \(with 3\+ apples available\). The apple/cash stand will give you up to 10 apples at $2 each. The orange/cash stand is a little more illiquid; it'll trade you $4 for 5 oranges, then $3 for 5 oranges, and then $1 for the next 5, and then just $0.50 for the next set of 5.

So you trade your 10 oranges for apples at the apple/orange stand and get 3 apples. It now costs 10 oranges to get an apple, but the apple/cash stand hasn't changed! It still costs $2 for an apple, and $4 for another apple after that!

So you see, he was right. Buying BTC with an alt doesn't change BTC's fiat price. Except... then a savvy guy comes along and sees an opportunity. He has some cash, and looks at the going rates on each stand. He does some quick calculations and buys an apple for $2. Then he takes that over to the apple/orange stand and buys 10 oranges with that. Then he takes those 10 oranges to the orange/cash stand and sells those 10 oranges for $7. Bang! He's happy because he just made a quick profit.

That's arbitration, and is the only way BTC's fiat price is changed when an alt is sold for BTC. In this example, selling 10 oranges for apples, a net buy of 3 apples, only results in a single apple being bought with cash as then the opportunity is closed \- after he does this quick trading, it still costs 10 oranges for an apple. But apples are still $2 and 10 oranges only net you $1.50.

It effects the price, but not nearly to the same degree as BTC being bought with fresh fiat.
Because the people willing to sell BTC for an ALT are not the same people selling it for cash. People sell BTC for cash to derisk / remove themselves from the crypto market. People sell it for alts to increase their risk for the potential for greater gains. Two different pools, and the only way they effect each other is through triangle arbitration.

In other words, the order books are separate. When someone buys ETH with BTC, an equal amount of BTC isn't magically sold on the BTC/USD pair. If the ETH buy was significant enough a small amount of BTC will be sold by a bot to capitalize on the now unbalanced BTC \-\> Fiat \-\> ETH \-\> BTC triangle, but not nearly the same amount as the BTC used to buy ETH.
Yes you are probably right there.
>but I'm someone you might want to listen to 

If I bought every time you told us to, I'd have very heavy bags from like $9k

is this a joke? 
Why would you brag because the price went up $50?   That makes no sense and shows how your brain works...or rather doesn't work.
BTC ETF get announced? 
Yeah right!
Im in a position ;)
How do you chart 7.5k as the 10k downtrend?
https://www.tradingview.com/x/NXmYTj9c/

9k breaks the monthly downtrend as well
Ya gotta ask though Why would someone who wants 'out'/'sell' there coins want to kill rallies?  If I knew something like BTC was EOS LOL i would get out QUEITLY and not snuff rallies and take market on every 15m chart tick, set up fake sell walls and trash talk on bitcoin markets.

Too many people here pretending things are what they are not.  Where fiat turns into bitcoin the odor is quite foul.

People who tell obvious but unpopular truths are downvoted. .there is another truth for you.
If you want you can rage quit, we won't be holding you here :-P
Odd, it usually takes 48 hours max with them. Gemini is also fast with ACH. 
Never had a problem with their ACH.  Probably a hundred transactions over the years.
I've done similar amounts and mine are typically in my account on the next business day. 
Take a minute and double-check your personal info (name, address, etc.) as well as your bank info (acct. number, routing number, etc.) and make sure it's correct. A typo in the numbers could fudge things up pretty severely and explain the delay.

If everything checks out, then I'd just chalk it up to a fluke and/or first-time withdrawal delay (especially if your account is new). Definitely keep in touch with support until it's sorted out.

Many, many people use Coinbase/GDAX with American banks and make large withdrawals regularly with no problems. Usually you only hear about the one out of a hundred (or thousand) that runs into issues.

Best of luck.
Ah, that's gone. Jamie Dimon already bought a new car with it
Same here, I try to do smaller transactions. Chase is known to flag high transactions. Do them in increments of 5k or less.

Best of luck pal. 
lol, yeah. As I stated in my own comment below, I would love to just go sideways here for a month. That would be really nice.
Depends which exchange you chart and what your points are. I used a ray off the first and third touch: https://www.tradingview.com/x/SaAP8Ef1/  

Apparently on Stamp it didn't break. 
crazy how fast sentiment changes here
really can't believe people talking about ATH off a 3% bounce lol 
Great TA! 
But, just imagine the R/R for going long at $0!!!!
I guess I took it as, 'if only, insert coin here, was the current face of crypto, we would not be in the mess that bitcoin put us in when it shit the bed.'
Yep. Cause it will still be true. Bitcoin will be a dying dinosaur by then. A relic of history. Maybe some collectors and fringe miners will still be interested in using it. 
Yeah most likely the latter. I've never understood why you'd downvote something that isn't trolling or offensive and has required effort to produce. If you don't agree then say why and if it's not what you want to hear then just ignore it. 

Reddit gonna Reddit though. 

FWIW I really hope this isn't how it turns out but I appreciate the opinion just the same. 
underrated comment
Now tell me about your grandfather's crypto facebook groups.
Ey yo mybad for the sarcasm and shit. It's true tho, this a fuckin war. Problem is we ants and the MM's are fuckin cyborgs from the future. That's why I thought it was funny you bein cold blooded and goin Rambo. For me it's profitable to think that we don't stand a chance against cyborgs, we just dumb motherfuckin fish along for the ride. You don't know what they're putting in the water, you dont know if the other fish are cyborg fishes, we don't even know if we're in a tank in a lab or if we're in a river headin towards the motherfuckin sea. 
A $50 move in 2010 was a massive dildo. Don't judge.
$80 move.
Why not just tell us? 
FYI, most people here have cold storage.  Stopping in with moon calls every morning will get you a few chances to “I told you so” but, no one really cares.  
Oh man, it was right in front of my face. How blind am I.
Lmao all year 
Just post somehing worth saying. Not:

Sir, when 5400? Sir? SIR?
How did you know?!

Butt plug.

I’m the handsome one. 
Glad I could help :) It's not obvious. I had a moment of panic when I realized I couldn't explain it quickly.
We’ll need the dogs gender to fully analyze the situation...
>Nope

Why so salty then friend? All I did was mock the bottom bears.

Also FYI I actually went 6x long at 10:58 UTC and it feels pretty nice.
Lol, he lost? Lost what? Why do you think "VER IS BCASH"? That doesn't make sense in any timeline. Roger supported Segwit 2X until it was called off. Bitcoin ABC, not affiliated with Ver, wrote the BCH software. Any more questions?
I find it interesting that you and chew chart stamp. Do you trade on stamp, or is there another reason you use it over BFX?
I'd rather have the fractal invalidated and punch through the top of this triangle so we can finally get out of this zone. But if we do end up again on 7k (high probability IMO) then a few days of accumulation there would confirm my bullish sentiment.
I'm watching similar triangle https://imgur.com/Ns9nH7v
The point is that I thought this triangle was invalidated when we crashed through its support. But now it looks like we a heading back in.
If we are rejected from this former support/now resistance, then we will go down faster... Another point is that there is the resistance from 10K. It is hard to believe that we could manage to overcome both resistance from first attempt. I will probably short in region 7.6-7.7

I wish that book were more broadly accessible. Really good stuff. Glad you enjoyed it. Makes the world seem a little brighter when I hear about other people reading it.
I think the best way to use it is as another tool to get a clearer view of what's going on.  I wouldn't recommend trading just off of divergence (even though on the last swing from 6500-9990 it signalled every decent entry for you).
Yeah it's been odd but really that's why I remain bearish. None of this looks like a reversal to me. Logically I should have closed $7100 to get the bounce but who knows how much upside this will really have. 


Also divergences are simple, don't let people complicate them too much for you:

1. bull div: price is lower low, rsi is higher low
2. bear div: price is higher high, rsi is lower high
3. hidden bull div: price is higher low, rsi is lower low
4. hidden bear div: price is lower high, rsi is higher high 

think about 1 and 2 being like struggling to push farther down / up. 

think about 3 and 4 like struggling to dump harder after a move up and struggling to recover after a move down
I see the resistance break, but this flagging upwards is often a precursor to dump. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/8topKx8z/

I'm trusting in the 7550-7650 historical HVN as proving to be too much for us to blast through after a 4% move. We'll see though. 
Alright man, let's do this. 
I might. If we bleed upwards but volume peters out, I may choose to increase it. I'd only bail on a violent leg up. 
Crypto gains are under regular income tax. The tax bracket for 55% is, like, >$200,000 so only if you are making big gains will you have to pay 55%. Otherwise it is lower.
Lol :D I think up or down it will be nothing short of fantastic 
I think that if it succeeds, $6k-$8k is an absolute bargain. But if it doesn't, or it doesn't for another 5 years, there a huge potential for loss there as well. 
Nor do they seem to grasp that I'm literally trying to acquire *more* BTC. By shorting, I'm 100% promising to buy more BTC later. 
It looks like a possible start to consolidation. I think we need about 2 months to confirm that, though. But now that I've said that, watch the price tank and volatility indexes skyrocket this week.

Fretting about a massive supply of coins waiting to be sold off is sure reminiscent.

Sigh.
I had support at 6950. But this was another case of "close enough" that I obviously should have taken 
Good news is, if we get a short squeeze on ETH, there should be some greener pastures for a while. I've got -9.5% to go lol
Teach nigga teach
It did only in bull runs because that's where your aunt bought bitcorn.
I sold on the way down...
My expectation is that we've either already bottomed on this cycle through our pennant or else we are destined to break through the floor if we can't break up again here. I've widened my stops, but I'm not going all the way down to 7050. IMO, if we break back under 7300, I think it's pretty clear that this was a technical bounce and nothing more. 
I was noticing that, so I'm wondering about widening my stops. It's a fairly low leverage position. Plus I have a better entry than MikeXBT with his $2mm, so there's that ;)
I'm torn on that front. If we break up here, we should be heading to re-test 7800. I'd be surprised by a technical bounce off long-term support that hit resistance, stalled, and *then* broke up, only to fail at 7800. If we break up here, I'm expecting a (choppy) path to our pennant top around 9K. On the other hand, I don't really see why we *should* do that.

It feels like stalling here is the dream short entry ahead of the real downward action. If we break up to 7800, I'm not highly confident I'll want to short it. 
> The deflation process requires everyone to sell or accept their losses down to a final price of $0.

Your prediction is btc is going to 0?
Are you in any way associated with BFX?
> Also the bear flag broke sideways and was not really a flag anymore as the sideways action had outgrown the length of the pole.

This is something I missed to consider this morning when I decided to stay in my short. 
You call it greed. I call it my strict risk management strategy :p
It is. Usually, when open interest reaches more than 500 mln contracts, a liquidation cascade until open interest reaches roughly 300 mln happens (since Feb 6, numbers were much lower before that). It is now at over 600 mln contracts. Patience is key here, first some overzealous overleveraged traders will get shaken out.
With a line of that length, there are a number of ways to draw it, especially depending on the exchange. For a trendline over a week, it really operates as more of a zone than a precise dollar amount. I think the biggest takeaway is that we're in a high chop zone. Until we break up (7600) or down (7400) clearly, we're basically in the mud. 
I don't have that one.  I have one from 8644 that is similar to that one, but that's it.
Im referring to the barty crouch we had in the 6400-6800 range. It was fuckery at it’s best and it’s exactly what we’re experiencing now
Hmmm.. On my chart we bounced off support and stopped at resistance. Looks like I have the right one ;)
Not even that but FAKE volume a la okcoin.
Think of it from the exchange's view. Any errors they'll probably refund you. Exchanges are under tremendous strain in terms of development / infrastructure. I mean just look at Binance. Huobi is still around? 
I feel you, and it makes sense, but in my opinion the onus is always on buyers to make the move. This is pretty much the main and only reason I expect the triangle to break down instead of up. 

Buyers have had their chance to break upwards several times now and have failed each time. Sellers don't have to prove *anything* since they're essentially simply waiting to see what buyers do (this is how it has felt during every run-up for the past few months, too- it just seems like sellers wait to unload on buyers and when they fail, the trend reverses).

When buyers fail to sustain the trend, it will naturally shift to the opposite direction. It's the same reason for why the bottom in 2015 happened- it's not that there wasn't enough sellers though, it's just that buyers finally showed up and overwhelmed sellers.

Buyers (or lack thereof) are the ones who generally move the market- sellers aren't motivated to sell intrinsically, they just overwhelm the market when there are no buyers left. There are always sellers in an uptrend, but as long as there is new and more money coming in, the price continues to make new highs. This is how the top of a bubble forms- sellers don't suddenly appear, it's just that buyers fail to appear. 

Buyer impotence is much more significant than seller impotence here because it's on *them* to sustain these prices and the long term trend and reverse the short term trend.  

With the 50 weekly MA crossing down, the 3 weeks of red we haven't seen since 2015, long term bullish formations failing to break out (falling wedge at $8k) etc, I feel like the trend/direction is being handed over to sellers. 

The symmetrical triangle came from a large move down from ATH, so the chances of it being a continuation pattern of the previous move are much higher than a reversal. 

In a large range spanning several months, the fact that we have failed to break out several times says to me that buyers are conceding defeat and sellers will show up in their place.

But I mean that could also just be a very long winded justification for something that doesn't really make sense. It's just how I see it personally 
> Something got us that high in the forst place.
  
99% sure the parabolic thrust from around 6k to 19k was a combo of CCs, low(er) interest rates, and good old hopium/mass hysteria. Should be interesting to see if it can sustain much above that, or if it will start unwinding further as no-interest-rate intro-terms start to expire. July will be a full 12 months out from 2.5k territory, and September 14 months. Most cc intro rate terms are 12 or 14 months...
I remember chewy stating that Stamp charts have been the most consistent/ reliable over the course of the last few years 
Let me pretend it does, for now.

I have a bullboner 
Yea worded that wrong, you know what I mean though lol. 

Now if we can get to the top of the triangle... 
20 to 6 Is 70%
It was going down for a month, and anybody who's been in this game longer than a year knows that's nothing. Anybody who's been in longer than a couple years knows even six months is nothing. 

We're going up.  Deal with it.

Additionally, never listen to a permabear no-coiner about Bitcoin.  They've been insanely, provably wrong for nine years running.
That's the spirit.
Stop\-loss triggered on the remaining half.

!short btcusd add 7368 50&#37;
Yeah, good point, ty. Should use last trigger when i go for a tight stop, i guess.
Yes
Why are you expecting an EOS selloff though?
Resistance at 7.8...
I'm still on mobile.. we broke that 7.5 line or that was just a wick above?
This is someone or ones who bought/borrowed a bunch OTC and dumped it. The only reason they're failing is that there's a massive global market of dip buyers like me.
can we do an AMA with him/her
How do you know? Maybe you just didn't find his porn folder yet ;-)
Mine has a problem, we're working on it though.
So, does the google trend result just show searches for bitcoin or anything with that word?
>Public then fomo.

if there is no public attention who should follow? 
Gotta make it happen chewy! You know me, I'll pump!
15min, the last 36h
Also at 30 minute and sort of on one hour too.
Because this thread is like the Instagram feed for traders, to  chat and discuss 
You've been somewhat quiet today, and I know you're like me and primarily watch BTC, but are you seeing the pressure cooker that is ETH right now? Curious your take. Feels like they've recreated a very similar environment to the 4/12 candle on BTC. 
Yes except this time there are many bag holders deep in the red on the way up. They need to be shaken out and fresh blood needs to come in. 
other way round bro. Appreciation = cheaper imports - more expensive exports.
If ever you sell you can sell to USD then convert to EUR. You will also make money on the drop in EUR/USD value.
It doesn't take "almost all".  It can take considerably less than 95%+ of market participants.
2x lmao Alts are dumping 3-5x right now 
Duuump eeet!
Rule 1. Please stay off my radar.
And yet you put the quotation marks around smart but not around mentally disabled.

Does this mean you're "smart"?
I do, it will go up or down
OK, thanks for writing up that summary. I see the RSI too, but it's not an indicator with a lot of weight. Should be seen in context, and we are surrounded by downward moving averages on all fronts here. About "significant bounce", well, the market has behaved somewhat differently the last month or so. There have been candles of $2-400 in magnitude, "barts", or chops, and some have suggested that it is because of the gradual normalization of the BTC market. I don't know if one can ever expect BTC to behave in some particular way.
Yeah, I’ve been out since 8400.  I gritted my teeth into a long last night @7104 hoping our triangle is in play.  Stops at 6920.  Made the same play w/ ETH looking for a scalp.  I basically just want the money I’ve lost in fees the past month of getting chopped up back...revenge trading is *good* right?
Starting to, just wait a few delusional days for the trend to confirm.
I'm talking about supply and demand.  A net btc purchase increases the demand for btc.  That's why it's called a NET purchase.  If I buy 100 apples demand  increases by 100 apples.  If I sell 100 apples it decreases by 100 apples.  It's pretty simple.
>That's arbitration, and is the only way BTC's fiat price is changed when an alt is sold for BTC. 

Exactly, and this happens constantly, so we just say that sells/buys in one currency affect the price in all currencies.
I'm not talking about affecting it instantly, I'm saying arbitrage will eventually even it out.

If you buy btc, those are no longer available for purchase, and this lack of supply is what drives the price up. It doesn't matter what you buy them with. Same goes for selling.
I did buy a little at $9150.  But I bought a lot more a lot more cheaply.  And I am quite confident that $9150 will look quite cheap pretty soon.
I'm not bragging about that or anything else, but you would do better to consider what I have to say than to mock me.  

Longing Bitcoin just takes the edge off a dump.  Shorting it provides rocket fuel for the pump.  
Good for you then, but I hope you get the point.
I'm on mobile now, check my post history, I posted chart today.
When I made the account I logged in to my chase account through coinbase with my username and password so it must be correct.

My account is brand new so there is that.

Funny thing is that I have been holding since BTC was 100 bucks, 120 actually. I have never sold but thought it was time to take a few bucks out. 
It was only 1K to test the waters lol. 
Since it was my first trans I only did 1000 bucks. 
Which makes me think this is a bull trap. Last breath of air before doom. Full disclosure, I am not in any position. 
yea TA definitely worked during last days 
Below $0 Satoshi himself comes to your house and steals your bitcoins
oh maybe, that's possible 
Then why would anyone be talking abo... never mind.
Absolutely.  I hope we go up to ATH off this next bounce.  I don't like people loosing money. 
Last time I checked we were in 2018.

That was 1% move that wicked above resistance, on low time frames it didn't even break the bull flag.

Completely meaningless for now.
Still 1%
Every morning eh!? Yea, you're not talking about me. 
Wood for the trees ...
I didn't ask when the price would drop to $5400.  I asked how long until $5400 is celebrated.  When do we have the party and revelries that $5000 held for more than one day?
Don't Hassel the Hoff.
I'm not saying this won't shoot up. I'm saying that quality of your posts is way below shit.

Really, man, get a grip and start posting something that actually helps the community.
Ahh, thanks
Why are you so outraged then?
Started using it because chewy did, but I can agree it's better. bfx can go on premium or discount and that changes the lines, like the ones right now, plus I did saw a lot of times when stamp didn't break a line while others did and in the end we bounced off it, so it's also better for confirmation. Used to chart bfx and stamp simultaneously but dropped charting bfx.

I used to trade on bfx and mex, but since I cashed out my usd trading stack I use only mex. Unfortunately, don't like their lack of mobile app and performance problems but they let you trade btc/btc with btc as profit and you can go high lev, which will be helpful when we reverse trend.
Either you include all wicks or none. You included 5.8 but cut off 6.5, you draw it wrong.
Wait your still holding your short from 10k??!?

You manage to make like 3 trades a year and they are all shorts with like 30% profit. 

I guess I’ll start reading up on div’s, I’m not sure how useful they really are 
some more bearoin : we barted to $7530 before going back down to $6700 before the BGD 
I know, that's why I'm struggling myself ;-)

But I'll probably end up in 3rd trade in a row that closed at be... BTC has a problem with follow ups lately.
Obviously. I'd think a move above 8.2k nonetheless will confirm that we're going to test the upper part of the triangle again. And I don't think that will end up as a lower high again. I'd say if you're bearish now then stay bearish at least until we get above the middle of the daily bbands.

Good luck with your trade.
That's not what I read.
It's not a success today? What would you fix?
Well you're taking *their* hard earned hodl-coins :p 
If this multi month move does turn into more of a symmetric triangle instead of a descending triangle, then it's still more likely to break down than up, as it's continuation of a the downward move from 20K.
I agree, that's why I said to watch it. I'm gonna cut mine on be at 7.2, but I'll watch in case it bounces back up.
Haha true. Also given the squeeze would be on Eth, a fakeout on Eth may not show quite as much on BTC's chart so 2% could be fine in that event.

Still maybe a little tight, but more of a go with your gut type of thing imo.
I personally trust horizontal support/resistance lines more than log trend lines. $7800 is a much higher volume node where people may be looking to break even by closing their earlier longs, especially since it surprisingly dropped so quickly past support there on the way down. So I see it much more unlikely that we gain the momentum to push through that, but I think that would signal reversal rather than simply the bounce/short squeeze it appears to be so far.
Looks like a good opportunity now.
Not that I know of! What gave you the idea? 
Yea literally everyone has theirs 5x higher than mine, and I’m charting on Finex. 

That being said, I prob wont open a position here. Better to wait this out 
True, it will be interesting to see where this move lands. Though even at that time we didn't manage to break much lower....
Haha you make a valid point.
Where do you have it? 7450?
What is CCs?
That top would be around 9, nice point ;)
I bought last night while we stalled at the linear chart bottom at 7100...was thinking exactly this.  I’ve lost about 7% of my trading stack on exchange fees s/l hunting chop the past month.  I rage longed the support and it seems to be going my way for the moment.  Moved my s/l to profit and gonna ride this to 8500 inshallah.
Yeah right, something wrong with previous numbers. This is what I was checking:

    HIGH       LOW	     DROP	      %
    19,891 	   6,000 	 13,891 	70%
    11,788 	   6,425 	  5,363 	45%
     9,990 	   7,040 	  2,950 	30%

/u/justanotherlogin the average value doesn't seem to calculate correctly on these two above consecutive updates? Or am I missing something?
Depends on strategy. I use alarms and exit manually, sometimes I set stops if I have good entry and went to protect break even in case big candle suddenly appears.
They're the likely party behind the spike to ATH short interest.


I had us sitting right on it on stamp. Definitely broke down from it now though. 
I agree, global dip buyers > all
they hve no thumbs!!!!
bull trend starts -> gets public attention -> public fomo -> more public attention -> more fomo
I've been a bit bored with btc the last few days honestly. And I'm more than a bit disappointed that the market bounced off of the triangle support instead of dropping through it. 

That said, I still don't really follow any crypto markets outside of BTC. 
We are talking about EUR appreciaction/depreciaction. And a strong dollar is bad for imports for countries in EU
Wouldn't arb bots already fix the difference? He can just go straight to EUR 
Seems a bit risky right now don't you think ? Holding bitcoins is probably safer... wait what did I just said ?
Done. My bad.
It means I am bored with this conversation.  
I'm not bored with the chart though.
It's tough being bested by Mister Mister Potatohead, but it does seem to have been the case here
I don't think the barts and chops are normalisation of the market. I think its more to do with lower volume combined with margin trading.

I am bearish for the mid\-term, I think we will see lower than 6k eventually this year, but it won't come easy imo, which is why I'm preparing for regular bounces. 

Each to their own, goodluck :\)
No, it's not that simple. The people selling apples for oranges are different than the people selling apples for cash.

If you don't believe me, ask any r/cryptocurrency noob during a bull market if they'd consider selling btc for USD the exact same as selling btc for fiat. Or ask a trader here the same thing during a bear market.

Hell ask them during any market and they'll tell you it's different. It's why the exchanges have separate order books. It's not one big gigantic bucket of btc available for sale. It's X for cash and Y for alt A and Z for alt B. Buying out of the Y pool may cause some arbitrage bots to buy a bit of the X pool, but it's not the same amount. Nor can you post the same bitcoin on an exchange as a limit sell for an alt AND fiat at the same time. It's different buckets.
You literally ignored the rest of my point, which was the **entire** point I was making. Relative liquidity has an effect.
See my post. I mentioned arbitrage. The difference in liquidity means it will be a relatively small effect (selling 1 BTC for ETH doesn't have the same effect on BTC/USD as selling 1 BTC for USD).
are you poor shaming me? 

I thought btc was for the poor, the people in Venezuela who needed access to a revolutionary global currency? 

Or is it just about getting you rich? 



e: nice ninja edit, don't worry, I saw it, I see through all you btc cultists 
>  Not to brag, but I'm someone you might want to listen to.


Of course. Just saying, if we get a nice dragonfly doji I’m going all-in within my comfort zone
Thanks! I see it now, that makes sense.
Gotcha.

I can't say for sure, but it's likely a "first-time" issue where something got flagged for manual review or otherwise got stuck in the tubes. Hopefully support can help you clear it up ASAP, and likely subsequent withdrawals/deposits will go through just fine.
I am not going to check his post history, but i bet a tron  i am right. 
People still talk about Yahoo, MySpace and Nokia. 
It was... just a joke.
it was just noise, a small wick. just silly to analyze it.
1% in 1 minute, yes.
it’s literally the same idiotic comment.

How about just talking about what you’re seeing rather than ridiculing others. You do realize going long at 7040 was very profitable for bulls and bears alike. No one is celebrating (outside of our resident bulltards), but the candle is impressive none the less. Just try to do better man, and stop trying to defend your garbage comment from up top
But I thought I was celebrating?
yeah. good to know! thank you!
then, according to correct variant, if we bounced off the support, there is only discussed resistance from 10K on our way.
the top of the triangle looks unreachable from here.


Lol I open and close like once or twice a month now. 

I'm trying to set up for the big move down. I could try to set up for the big move up as well but I don't believe fundamentally it's going to happen. 

While you're doing awesome and you're on a win streak, be careful! Win streaks are bad if you don't remain humble and objective. 

Someone once said they trade less because it reduces the amount of times they can be wrong. Makes sense to me, and that's why I try to trade less. 

But if you're doing fine then keep it up 
That's some pretty short term bearoin haha
I appreciate the perspective--truly. Thanks
Because it lacks the infrastructure, adoption, and tax environment necessary to operate at its  potential. There is no real basis for it to currently be worth what it's worth. It has nearly no use as a currency (due to tax laws) and it's a horrible store of value (down 30% in 3 weeks). The technology is sound and is a success. The environment just isn't ready yet, and there is no guarantee it will be. 
If they're actually hodling, then they shouldn't care!

If anything, I'm taking coins from reckless/weak hands! I'm not planning to sell any of my trading coins or my rebuilt cold storage into fiat any time soon!
Or is it a continuation of the two year move up from 200?

Seriously, think of the scale of this triangle. A six month triangle confirms a much larger trend than a correction that bottomed out after a few weeks.
For what it's worth, Peter put it at a 67% to 33% chance of it breaking down/up. 

he seems to agree with your assessment of it being a continuation 
I had mine where yours was, also charting BFX. I opened a hedge short (simply hedging my fiat value) in case this dumps. 
Finex is basically like Mex futures, they wicked to 7.6 on that first candle. Finex tends to trade at different price than others and that makes lines different, especially the longer ones. That's why your line is in a completely different spot.

But... If you look at first 11.7 bounce. That was on spot on linear drawn ATH down trend line. A looooot of people drawn out like this and they started selling as soon as we touched it... Self fulfilling prophecy. Fun part, Japan futures traded higher and they hit log trend line. Bfx was nowhere near any of those then.

So charting bfx sn't such a bad idea if enough traders do this.

It's because you commented to the post you already had a command on. In those cases the bot assumes the original post and since it was already saved it's ignored. 

Try sending it by PM or comment on my post to see if it updates.
Yeah, thanks. Shitty place to make trading decisions. I'm thinking about hedging long with a short and wait until this breaks.
As am I. Had to bail on my short higher than I wanted to. I'm far from convinced by this bounce, though. I don't watch other crypto markets either, but an acquaintance brought the ETH similarities to me after we'd been talking about the perfect storm that created the BTC BGD.

It's all already started to cool off, though. and I'm expecting this to drop back down.
What? How were you bored with the action over the weekend? That drop was pretty eventful and fast moving for Bitcoin, was it not? Certainly not impossible to trade.
Okay cool but when someone says a strong $ is 'bad for imports' its usually in reference to the US current account
You still lose money if bitcoin goes down. Just not as much if you had bought with USD.

If you wanted to preserve fiat value you'd swap your fiat to USD or something.
NP. Thanks for responding. I believe you'll do much better from now on :)
I lol-ed. Thanks for brightening up my day.
>The people selling apples for oranges are different than the people selling apples for cash.

Why do you think this matters? The market exists to propagate different preferences to huge numbers of people. We're not bartering here, we're in a highly liquid market that people *do* arbitrage.
I guess if you trade the 1 minute charts
>selling 1 BTC for ETH doesn't have the same effect on BTC/USD as selling 1 BTC for USD

In the end, if there are traders looking for profit, it does.
The obnoxious bulls have invaded. The moonboys. I mean, binaryechos is a decent guy, and Chad is hilarious, but these guys are just willfully blind.
Lmao I think so. I like egg salad 
Well then you can just be patient. Not a good idea to trade with all stack whilst feeling uncomfortable about it. 
Thank you sir. Hopefully you are correct lol
a whole tron 😳 
Your correct! He believes in the bch lol 
No one fucking talks about Yahoo, MySpace and Nokia
You guys need to start marking those jokes somehow... Getting confused here :-(
No.

$50 in 1m, 250 BTC

$80 in 3m, 400 BTC

Not impressed.
Somehow, I'm not surprised that you don't understand the difference.

$7400.  Let's party.

This is Good for Bitcoin.
https://bitcoinwisdom.com/markets/bitfinex/btcusd
Yup
Might start taking your route, and trade once or twice a month. I’ve definitely decreased  the amount of trades since I started, while now i just stick to a position and let it ride. 

The next only obvious move for me is a short from $7800, which is what I’ll be waiting for.

Otherwise, I’ll be shorting the breakdown of the pennant or longing it if it holds 
lol mainly I just think it's more of a resistance than we realize

$7500 is an interesting psychological price point. It's not an obvious one but I believe the reason we've never spent much time here is because the market has either dumped voraciously past $7k or pumped beyond it without a single glance behind on the way up.

The fact that we're chopping around here now is an indication that the market is getting used to lower prices.

Notice how our ranges of chop after large moves have gone from: $13-14k to $11-13k to $10-11k to $9-10k to $8-9k and now to $7-8k. 

They're all moving down
Couldn’t agree more.
Isn't the problem with that idea that the triangle doesn't start at 20K? Its top line begins lower.
I have this descending support line from the 8k range acting like support now 

Green:  https://www.tradingview.com/x/n2cupKR9/

You could just short this and it could endlessly slide down the line slowly 

Zoomed in: https://www.tradingview.com/x/fDf2dvcO/
Might just swamp to stamp, seems more reliable and the lines are based less on what over leveraged n00b got liquidated 
You're nearly convincing me to re-short here above my exit with stops over 7550. 
ahhhh... yeah, it’s possible that was a big reason for the bullshit that ensued
Thanks, I’ll try a PM. Thanks for all your work with this great tool! :)
Sitting above resistance/support at the moment: https://www.tradingview.com/x/3fZrLx8d/

I shifted my channel to sit similar to yours that you posted earlier today.

Edit: typo
Well, one thing I will say is that this bounce goes a long way toward resetting RSI that was pretty ridiculously oversold across the board. 

The 6h through the 1d are now quite safely above 30. 

A few more days of sideways between $7,100 and $7,800 and the market could very well finally be ready to take the plunge. 

Otherwise it's back up to the $9,000s to try to break through the upside of the formation again. 

I really don't see a scenario where the market bounces off resistance again and doesn't finally break through to the downside.
I see. But I should have done this way before, I think we are too close to the bottom to take that kind of risks. Will stick to BTC/EUR trading. All I want is more BTC. Don't care about fiat.
Or just straight up short EUR/USD. I'm having better returns the last weeks shorting xxx/USD pairs and shorting oil than shorting BTC. The volatility in markets is pretty insane right now
The point is there's differences in liquidity among different pairs so selling one BTC on pair X =\= selling one BTC on pair Y. What pair it's sold on makes a difference.

And if you think the crypto market is liquid just lol.
No, relative liquidity means that selling 1 BTC for ETH has a disproportionately small effect on the BTC/USD price as selling 1 BTC for USD. That's what I've been saying this whole time and you've been completely ignoring it.

I don't trade the 1 minute charts and even if I did it would have no effect on general market facts.
No. Relative liquidity.
I don't mind Chad and binary, it's the ones who are obsessed with money and the new cult of bitcoin that annoy me
exactly. I generally have my risk apetite go up and down over time. Roght now dont want to be trading with more than half a BTC. Sometimes it’s more
Gonna be yuuugggeee. Lambo moon car homes. 
We are, right now. They were early leaders but didn't keep pace on development. 
I am not impressed either, which is why I'm short right now.
The difference you are arguing is that you are mocking the celebratory nature of this sub when the price barts to a price point it was at a mere days ago. You believe that this price point should in no way be celebrated since it is not a “win” but simply a “finishing last” type of reconciliation prize and expect more down.

Your original comment played on this sentiment by asking (rhetorically) when we will be celebrating 5400 as a similar reconciliation prize as the sub is (according to you) doing at 7400

I am fully aware of the intent of your original comment, as well as the subtle nuance you are attempting to argue as a differentiating factor between your original comment and my satirical comparison of your comment to a meme.

I find this entire ordeal minutely retarded
And I had to take a position right smack in the middle of it :P
That's a smaller trend that also only really has 2 points of contact.

This level of specificity on the triangle seems more like tea leaves, though.
I used to chart stamp and finex and watch Mex and flyer. Now I only chart stamp, use finex for alarms and Mex for trading. Can't say I'm doing worse than then. But some people here only chart finex and that works for them.

A lot of moves on this market now is done by traders. I wouldn't be surprised if that candle today was buying bounce from support by stamp traders and then buying break out by finex traders...
/u/_chewtoy_ uses stamp if I'm not mistaken, maybe he'll chime in here
Well, we bounced off that support line. I'd rather wait. Look, third touch, every touch had a nice move up right to the top, I think this will move at least to 8k or go for a test of the top of triangle. We already broke that resistance from 10k once.

But yeah, you may be right and this is just technical bounce, RSI got to overbought on short time frames. I'll let my long ride here and see what happens. Already made a mistake letting my 7550 stop out on saturday, so I hope this one won't be. This bear market needs to stop somewhere ;)
Thanks, doesn't look too convincing though.
It seems like our 10K downtrend line stopped this pump in its tracks, aside from the one wick up just now: https://www.tradingview.com/x/wevpam6t/  

I will be quite surprised if we can leg up again here, although the dragging that would occur by an ETH squeeze is the only wildcard in my mind. 
Fair enough :) 
The currency pair doesn't make a difference in the overall long term. At most it's a wave that ripples through the different pairs before settling.
No you are, because you're a dumbass
> when the price barts to a price point it was at a mere days ago. 

Yes, $7400.
> That's a smaller trend that also only really has 2 points of contact.

What's the large trend? The downtrend line that sits below at 6.8K. How does that factor into the various triangles still in play?

>This level of specificity on the triangle seems more like tea leaves, though.

What do you mean? The direction it began from? The start points? The direction it will likely exit? I thought triangles were supposed to be relatively strong patterns, including in Bitcoin.
He answered like 100 times to that question ;-)
Also, the LONG:SHORT ratio on ETH is terrifying for anyone on the bear side of anything. 
 Here, let me explain relative liquidity, ignoring market spreads \(which makes the arbitrage opportunity even smaller\).

There's 100 BTC available for buying/selling at 10k, and 100 ETH for sale at 0.1, and 50 ETH for sale at 1k.

I buy 10  BTC with 100 ETH; now ETH is at 0.099 and the ask side fills in, but due to liquidity issues, it only takes 20 ETH now to bring it back to 0.1.

The arbitrage opportunity here is to sell 19.xx ETH for cash \(now 29.xx ETH available at 1k\), buy BTC \(still 98.xx BTC available there\) and then buy 20 ETH with that BTC.

In this example, due to liquidity, that 10 BTC being bought with ETH only resulted in around 2 being bought with fiat. When two things have different liquidity, the more liquid pairing benefits less from arbitrage than the less liquid pairing does. 
There's debate about the value of triangles vs horizontal support and resistance lines. Triangle seem to suggest areas of support and resistance that traders will use to set their targets. 

Anyway, here's what I'm seeing:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/44Wf7Hup/
So what's 1 more time!

I do, in fact, chart primarily using Bitstamp data. 

This is primarily because it has the longest unbroken string of historical data that's available across all exchanges. 
Ok maybe they aren't going to be perfectly the same. But this originally started from 

>So "buying" btc with alts doesnt actually increas the price of btc.

I was just trying to say that it *will* move the price, maybe it doesn't move it 100%, but it still moves it 90%, far more than not at all.
>There's debate about the value of triangles vs horizontal support and resistance lines.

What is the debate? They're both relevant, I think in most cases, but if a triangle is clearly formed on lower time frames, you can expect horizontal supports/resistances to be constrained by the triangle until the triangle breaks.

>Anyway, here's what I'm seeing:

Yeah, looking at the same thing. The downtrend line from 10K looks less important because it doesn't fit with symmetry of the other line and doesn't create enough of a descending triangle either. It's a weird shaped triangle but that might not mean much, it could still be valid, I guess. I don't really know.

Sometimes when I read your posts I think you should post a FAQ somewhere.

What leverage short? Oh, faq#5

Why so big leverage? Faq#9

Do you use stops? Faq#97

Actually impressed you answer those time after time.
This is what I meant be "tea leaves." The triangles available doen't seem to a describe resistance well. Alternatively, draw horizontal lines from previous points of support and resistance. Between that and fib numbers you get more insight into potential price targets, IMO. Debatable, but I favor horizontal lines... Still tea leaves ATM. I've already said what I think; sideways or down with a prediction emphasizing sideways.
This is a great idea.  You and /u/_chewtoy_  should make this a thing.  

Got a couple more to help kickstart this:

Faq#33: why do you say “hedge” short?

Faq#357: what is your win percentage and why is that NOT the most important statistic for a trader? 




Well a triangle whose lines reflected symmetrically across its vertex has a bit more validity in my book, whether it's warranted or not. The triangle formed with the steeper line from 20K is a very strange shape and I haven't seen much TA with that shape being treated as a singular valid pattern. But who really knows.

I agree that I think the confluence of fibs, horizontal levels and well-established triangles and wedges are the proper route. When everything converges at one point, that's probably not a shabby trading zone.
