well that move actually BROKE my computer. I have quite a few windows open granted, with multiple trading view accounts but it actually froze my computer and then it crashed, that's how fast that price fell.

That's a mega fast dump Jesus Christ 
Here is the large order tracker at V>35 BTC per order, its was massively targeted specifically at breaking that historical 8.2K resistence:

Instead of the position bot, does somebody want to develop a random heads or tails generator bot? We place our bets and every six hours the bot ˋflips the coin.´

This way, half of us still gets fucked but the winnings stay in the community.
So under water all I can do is drown at this point. 
I'm done trying to be a day trader, I suck at it, just gonna Hudl and buy the dips, seems like safest route if you believe in btc in the long term.
Bearflag on the daily on the move... 7700 here we come.
For fucks sake. I didn't realise my short from 8,745 was stopped out at 8,840 a couple of hours ago.

Fuck this entire range. I just get stopped out of every trade with these retarded wicks and barts.
I expect a little dump around May 16th, the day that consensus ends. Then BTC will gradually take another shot at 10k, barring any major positive announcements from consensus or the exact same Korean FUD. Mt. Gox alone can't suppress the price but them Koreans, they short the market as soon as a police car runs past one of their exchange offices. 
Hey guys, been away for a little while and im technically still away today but i figured this was quite important.

I really hope that no one got fooled by the Upbit news. We've seen this happen so many times, China multiple times, India and Korea multiple times.

It always seems to be a super vague, super negative headline that makes the pussies shit themselves and market drops.

At this point, i honestly treat all FUD as a temporary flash sale. this market is greedier than whole of Wall Street combined and has worse memory than a fucking alzheimers patient.

I see a lot of people saying that the market is stupid, it makes no sense and so on.

Thats because these people seem to think that ANY market is rational, which is complete and utter bollocks. Anything built on human psychology and behaviour is gonna be the opposite of smart and rational. Think about how much of a moron the average guy is. Half of them are dumber than that.

This shit isnt built on fundamentals, there's no solid token value evaluation model. its all hype, emotion and speculation. look at tron, plagiarised whitepaper and no product but its in top 10 with nearly 5 billion valuation.

Idek if this made sense but I hope you guys can see through all the bullshit in this market.
You are all my only friends. I love you 
Stardate 21254.7,  BTC continues it's sideway crawl against the recently encountered rekky field resistance line.  The crew morale remain high on the hope pushing through and returning back to the Earth moon. We will continue on our journey to explore strange new worlds and to boldly go where no one has gone before (with tight stops).
Happy with my short. Now Let's see if 8400 holds. I think not, the TK bearish cross (almost above the cloud) is strong. 


Plus my [fractal](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8j9i8m/daily_discussion_monday_may_14_2018/dyy687f/) worked quite well, let's see if it keeps on giving.

Set break even stops on my short from between 8750-8800? Or take profits now? 

This has been the never ending battle for me, and if I just took profits Ide be drinking a pinacolada on the beach with some slut muffin in Miami 
!short XBTUSD close 8470

I close too early :(
unfortunately I can not babysit it any time longer

will re evaluate tomorrow

It looks like we have reached the point of maximum indecision. Here are some [colorful moving averages](https://www.tradingview.com/x/QBfeDEbv/) on the daily.

* Daily SMA50 (red) naturally broke to the downside first after the 20k top. We dipped above it in march and crossed up a month ago. Now price is resting right on it.

* Daily SMA100 (yellow) broke down after some struggle in january and price moved above only recently, then broke back down a few days ago and now rests just below.

* Daily SMA200 (green) stopped all moves to the upside for the past two months and is currently almost static a little above 10k. Being a very strong and long-standing resistance and the highest of the common MAs at the moment a move beyond might end up at the linear resistance around 11.6k rather quickly. Until that happens it remains a prime short entry.

* Daily SMA350 (cyan) is *roughly* where the weekly SMA50 sits at. Strong support still unbroken. A sustained break below isn't likely to end well.

If there has ever been a time where I have *zero intent* to enter a trade, it's these past three day's range.
Short from $8430

Edit: the massive bear flag finally broke down. Jesus fucking Christ that took forever. 
I thought I would never say this, but since that 9400 drop the market has actually felt quite random to trade. Alts, ETH and so on at least have somehow flows and trends you could ride

But I guess that's what some big accumulator wants us to feel, if I would put the conspiracy hat on...
https://twitter.com/PeterLBrandt/status/996461110818553856 

8200 better hold
Ladies and gentlemen: Bart has arrived. Fuck this market. No seriously fuck it.
The mid 8's have been really tough to trade... which is mostly why I've been out of trade.  Getting kicked off the line yet again seems like the perfect place to setup a longer term short position, but I can't help but wonder if we don't just [bear flag up the line again for another attempt](https://www.tradingview.com/x/6Vl7kvac/)

Thoughts?
GDAX order form is blue'd out, anyone see that too?
now the question is if $8300 going to bounce again

or if the pattern traders who've been scalping the $8300-$8600 trades going to be stuck holding some bags
!short XBTUSD close 8310. 

That was longer underwater than I expected.
Long time holder since 2013/2014 (+ perma bull) and I've been through plenty of some dumbass market cycles and bubbles. But with this shit going on with barting and sudden downwards movements, I am beginning to turn bearish.

It seems so coordinated... not manipulated but coordinated. As if someone just decided "welp time to market sell within a 15m candle".

With that the buying pressure doesn't make sense at all. We were LITERALLY $10 away from 10k on BFX and buying pressure just drops instantly. Huh? No Push? Doesn't make sense.

Commenters say it's manipulation for big players to just get more coins... I really don't buy that narrative. Isn't it everyone's goal to get more coins (or fiat for that matter)? To me it's not manipulation or whales getting more coins, but I think it's something else. 
https://twitter.com/iamjosephyoung/status/996262370296020992

EDIT: Market is so fragile that it looks to find any reason to make a move in either direction. So much hype around consensus, so, this week it is just easier to go long or to be out of position
Welp, glad I closed my long. Not as glad that I closed my short in the first place. 

Interested to see if buyers treat this as a joyous offering of cheap coins from the bear gods or if they finally capitulate.
Bitcoin flips me the finger on my Birthday!! 
Damn you!! You Bipolar Coin You!! 
I feel myself getting more tribal (bears vs bulls) and just wanted you all to know that I'm checking myself and will try to be more objective. This is not an echo-chamber, and spirited debates should be encouraged and fostered. I will do better.
Don't worry Guys, I'm an expert at selling the bottom and I haven't sold yet. Thought about it a few times, but haven't pulled the trigger yet.
I have a topic we have not discussed recently. If you go into Fiat, do you consider the Fiat currency you are buying? I am from Europe, but I go into USD at the moment, as I think the USD will increase in value compared to Euro. Trading on Bitfinex you can go into USD, GBP, JPY and EUR.

That is the USD/EUR chart: [https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/USDEUR/](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/USDEUR/)

That is the USD/JPY chart: [https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/USDJPY/](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/USDJPY/) \(nice pennant that might break out soon\)

That is the USD/GBP chart: [https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/USDGBP/](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/USDGBP/) \(GBP is very low on a long time\-frame\)

Of course it is not many &#37; you can make here, but anyhow it might be worth considering. If you normally trade on margin, this topic might not be for you.
Imagine a world where a 5% stop loss couldn’t be triggered on a single 15min candle...
Could be a tiny bear flag forming, for another leg down.
Edit: nope

We might get that red TD9 on the 1D after all /u/FireStorm93  https://www.tradingview.com/x/3BNW95nB/

!short BTCUSD 8300 close

Had a leverage of x13 since 8700 avg 100% of stack
Average age of the millennial is 25.6 - currently the largest group of 25.6 year olds to ever exist... People start investing at this age. Millenials in general have far less trust in government and banks then ever in history.. Just think of the inflow (if even just a small % of them allocated a small % of their portfolio) with the supply decreasing by next halving... Im not saying 50k by 2018 im saying 50k by 2020 - with an extremly high probability... Now that risk return is amazing given that bitcoin aint going anywhere. Im coming from a 3rd world country and the demand is constantly increasing as we see our inflation rise due to the populist government elected by the uneducated. I will continue to DCA into bitcoin with 30% of my portfolio unless something fundamentaly shifts. Bitcoin has been attacked by so many things making it anti fragile and hands down the most decentralised store of value. LN second layer would be great but right now bitcoin serves the use case for me. I can only invest 27% of my money in offshore equity legally but bitcoin is fine so getting rand hedged is what i and many other South Africans want
Out of my long at $8760 for a small loss. 

Might take a day or two off here. 
This market is going to give me a stroke. Like seriously. Fuck these massive all at once dumps. I hope whoever is doing it is happy with themselves.

We all just want Bitcoin to succeed right? 
[I feel like we're close to finding out the direction of the trend.](https://prnt.sc/ji2o7s) We still are grinding up the bear flag line (which did break down but was Bart'd up by the bulls - market wasn't ready for a breakdown yet if its a bear) 
tl;dr = won decently taking profits on a short from this morning as it fell, yolo added everything, stops at break even. Come get me you crazy whales.

Full:  
Well, I spent the last day in time-out, so I haven't been posting updates. /u/veltrop can attest to the crazy shenanigans on my position, as I was PMing throughout the day.

My original short from last night (20% stack @ 8750; 8850 on June) had a reduce stop at breakeven execute overnight (25% reduction), but market stops didn't get hit. I had profit taking orders laddered down. I had a busy morning at work, so I didn't update it, and this morning's dump triggered half of those, which reduced by another 50%. I ended up with a fairly small position remaining (roughly 10% of stack @ original entry). 

At this point in the morning, I figured I might as well swing for the fences. On the bounce to 8550, I added heavily up to 50% of stack.  I added again at 8560 up to 75% of stack. At this point, my average was about $30 over my resistance target, and I had stops at break even. I ran some quick math and determined that a further add $5 under resistance to 100% of stack with stops $5 over resistance made a lot of (crazy person) sense, so I entered those. Somehow the add hit and the stops didn't. I've come within 0.2% of my stops 5 times in the last 8 hours.

At this point, I'm just laughing at the situation and watching it play out. (hint: been extremely boring afternoon/evening). My sales locked in some decent profit, and even if I get stopped out with minor slippage, I'll have a 5% stack increase on the day. Hard to be upset with that.

Charts are a bit wonky for today. We're approaching downtrend resistance. There have been more fakeouts in the last 10 hours than I've seen in ages. I'm not sure if we're in a bear flag/pennant, a descending wedge, or a descending triangle. Or a bart. Could just be a massive bear flag on the 4H with all those inside it. But I'm holding this short to breakeven or heavy profit.

Some lines: https://www.tradingview.com/x/WEWeszGf/  

More lines: https://www.tradingview.com/x/tTKNjUHY/  

Good luck all.

edit: all above numbers are at 10x.
Oh well I have no idea if we are heading higher or lower right now.  These BRD and BGDs and BARTS are nearly impossible to predict.  I am just going to keep my cold storage hedged the best I can until I have more of an idea of risk/reward of long or short.
Eager to get back in but its too soon right? I should be patient
I don't fully understand the motivation behind large market orders right below resistance level:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/uuf6uY5l/

I read here someone saying that it's accumulating without incurring too much slippage. It's possible because I heard whales cannot fill their stacks in one go. They have to accumulate and add to their stacks as the market goes DOWN. It's quite possible. But this does not help with regard to predicting the direction of BTC at the moment.
Closing my [3x short from 8760](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoinmarkets/comments/8jipk9/_/dz04xs8?context=1000) at 8443 and entering a 1x long with stops at 8150. I think 8400 will hold and we will turn for another go at downtrend resistance. Double support below at 8400 then 8200 smells solid to me. 1x because of all the indecision in market.
1D Stoch RSI below 30. Fake out?
Keeping my 8850 short. Stops above 8950. 

Reasons: Bearish TK cross on the daily. Bearish divergence on the 4h (stoch RSI). Fractal of the previous descent from 11.8k to 6.5k.

EDIT: and the daily looks like a giant bear flag
Holding my short from $8700. Feels primed to break down.
Do bogdanoffs have a booth at consensus this year? couldn't find any info
The Wyckoff Distribution meme wasn't a meme. It's uncanny how much the current chart looks to the model.



I'm gonna enter a long if and when we hit 7800. I think sub-8k is probable sometime soon, but I think we're gonna see a good bounce when we hit that level.
Coinbase just announced [several institutional products](https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-institutional-deea317d23af): Coinbase Custody (in partnership with an SEC-regulated broker-dealer), Coinbase Markets, Coinbase Prime and Coinbase Institutional Coverage Group. Some of these were actually already announced last year though (Coinbase Custody.)

Overall, shouldn't matter for short-term, but should be bullish for the long-term.
While I initially thought this move had some promise to actually break us out of this barty monotony, it looks like there's a pretty strong chance there's more chop ahead:

https://imgur.com/a/KZA7mfz

The market is still within the confines of the larger flag, which is now irrelevant to the upside as there's a larger symmetrical triangle with resistance below the breakout point of the above flag:

https://imgur.com/a/xIW4pcK

Everything I'm looking at is pointing to a breakdown, but not necessarily right here. There's room to bounce as high as around $8,750 here if the market wants to continue being ludicrously choppy.

EDIT: Fun fact, if this formation breaks down, the initial target for the breakdown would be $6,500.
My take is that the pumps during consensus have either been 1) surprisingly weak or 2) sold off fairly quickly. Seems like a failed attempt by the whales to prop the price, and a huge selloff (abort mission) will ensue toward the tail end if not shortly after the event concludes. 
I have a question for the people that are longer around here. Was the market behaviour like this before at any timepoint? I mean... are we really not just waiting for a whale to decide the direction for us with a huge market buy or sale on finex? Or am i paranoid? 
Is gdax down for anyone else? I just started getting their "Whoops!" page, and intermittently a browser "connection timed out" error when trying to load. Tried refreshing the browser.
So, I know this goes against the general strategy/thoughtful approach people generally take here, but last night I won a bet against a friend on the Golden Knights and he paid me in btc.  I kinda feel like parlaying it a little bit with a leveraged bitcoin bet that I normally don't make.  I haven't been following the markets/charts since Thursday/Friday of last week.  If you were to make a speculative bet on the market today, would you go long or short?  No need for the general warnings about leveraged trading/gambling etc, I know this is gambling, I am just looking to have a little fun and potentially rub my friend's nose in my returns for him doubting his own home team!

Given that this is a gambling position I don't expect someone to give me super detailed analysis but if you have a little thesis and maybe a chart to back it up let me know and lets see if I can make a nice punt!
Just curious, who is still holding their short from $8,700+++? What is your game plan?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/Vkoch8dL/

We could all close right now for a reasonable profit, but if the trend / pattern continues above, we could see a climb back up to $8,700 to be rejected at the line again probably to bring us to the $8,300 range. 

I’m super on the fence of closing right now, but I’ve just moved my stops up to $8,720 Incase we wick through the resistance line posted above. 
Bear flag? https://www.tradingview.com/x/niKdEJ4u/

Elliot wave downtrend? https://www.tradingview.com/x/1NnUv8VM/

Also for those talking about TD sequential, only on bitstamp it went lower than the 5th to count for a 9 sequential. not significant if you ask me. 

Edit: It broke, Id be looking at $7.8k-$7.9k tonight. Should be interesting. 
Considering $8200 buy-in entry. Let's get there.
Does anybody know the rationale behind the bear flag? Why is a strong down move(flag pole) supposed to be followed by an ascending channel? Does it mean the pattern is stronger if a down move is followed by a descending channel like this?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/CiiRlEew
**!long XBTUSD close 8378**

That fucker hit my stops \(again\). Not having a good trading day.
Ok, I’m going long. We bart back up any time now. It’s the same as back in early May only 300 bucks higher!!!!

1d Stoch RSI is as low as the 6500 bottom

I highly doubt 8200 falls today

Stops tighter than Trump’s buttox when Mueller shows him the long dick of the law
Observation: Months ago, bears demanded $3k. Weeks ago, $5k. Now, it seems like they'll be happy getting $7.8k.

Suggests that the doom and gloom narrative has lost enough credibility for the proponents to compromise on their goals. 

Consensus is off the wall optimism. Deloitte is aggresively entering the space. AWS is here. CFTC and SEC officials offer their encouragement at every panel. Bankers are treating the space and the people with newfound respect.

Where were we last year? The year before? 2009? Do you see an industry dying, stagnating, or growing? What will this mean for supply and demand? How does supply/demand affect price?

Enjoy getting your shit tossed by traders today if that's your thing, but I'd recommend taking your fingers off the button for a bit and enjoy the fireworks. 
ETH/BTC ratio has retraced 2% in the past 5 hours including dumping .005 in the past 20 min.  Have found this to be a leading indicator of a larger dump

Did anyone else see that weird one minute candle on BFX or are my eyes playing tricks with me? 
So despite having being harshly rejected above 8800 twice... The market really doesn't like being below 8700. Not sure what to make of this price action. I feel like we should dump hard, but it just wont happen
Bogdanov leveled up and got a new skill : "Lightsaber"
When I last posted about my charts, here's what I said 6 days ago:
________
Ultimately, I think its more than a possibility that we test 8.5k again since major levels of support/resistancce are where MMs can squeeze every last ounce from bulls before letting it run back up again while still maintaining the sentiment that a bull market is on the horizon. If they let it drop below 8.5k, the game is over. BTC never seems to get a clean move without games first. As long as it is above 8.5k, there will be plenty of games to scare money out of bulls. Example: On my pivot chart, there is plenty of room on the upcoming candles to 'sandwich' the PSAR signal and 8.5k (S3 Support), we may just keep oscillating from here and 8.5 k until the PSAR is almost flush with S3. It makes it obvious to me that we may need a bounce off of that support to see PSAR turn into a buy.
w/indicators: https://imgur.com/a/OnfI1qU
w/pivot points: https://imgur.com/a/1cA4ME6
________

Here's the updated weekly pivot point chart: https://imgur.com/a/dpLiVlZ

Things are going as I thought - the price is being sandwiched above the critical support level at S3 (8500) and the PSAR signal is steadily descending to manifest into a buy signal.  The candle itself is in a tight range above this support which means the market is respecting 8.5k and price is consolidating.  MACD is about to crossover to a point corresponding to seller exhaustion.  And lastly, there is a MA cross that is about to turn bullish - the lower band is MA support at 8.4K.  I am holding long due to the confluence of all of these factors. 
Who is the one of you whales is dumping the price right now?! I am from Europe and need to get some sleep :\(
good game
You guys know that Microsoft announces it will develop a blockchain identity solution grounded in bitcoin tomorrow at 9 AM right? Who is opening a short right now?

Edit: wow downvoted for sharing news okay blind bearish sentiment here is a good contraindicator
Have not wanted to post here lately as any bearish view was being called ridiculous,etc.
But for those interested my price target all along has been a combination of a "Trend-Based Fib Extension" drawn from the first two waves of a possible 5 waves down from 10k which gives me a target of 7750 on Bitfinex. This is also the .618 fib retracement of the entire move up since April. I also have a horizontal resistance line drawn at 7600 from a long time ago I can't remember when I drew it.
It seems to me a lot of algo trading perhaps you all have noticed that they will hit the fibs almost exactly...the initial low of 8204 on the 12th on Finex was exactly on the .50 to the dollar

Edit : I also am having a hard time with the price action; I think you have to decide on your longer timeframe view and trade the 4hr and up....or gamble! peace 
Volume tapering off.... bands tight as gently caress... and no serious profit taking yet...

See ya'll on the other side of 9k!
For what it's worth, Dan from The Chart Guys thinks it's more likely that we see continued consolidation on the Weekly before another move upward. We've been in the upper level of the 8200-8900 range for a few days now. I'm targeting a limit buy in the 8350 range under the assumption that we stay in this range for at least a few more days.

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/HHTyrMIY/
There are really only two lines I'm looking at right now.  We've been walking up the support line formed from the local bottom on May 12th, and now getting forced up against resistance from downtrend line at $9.9k.

[Trade the break](https://www.tradingview.com/x/pPuQm17i/)

The fact that we got kicked off the line once yesterday and have maintained support here for so long makes me think there's a solid chance this breaks up.  BB on the 1hr getting tight so should see a move here soon.

Edit: Moving down.  There's a [secondary support line underneath to watch](https://www.tradingview.com/x/x8rRv8C5/)
Finally i am breakeven with my @8500 short. This time i don't care about getting my stops wicked. 
Tight stops to allow some room to breath still but i just want to get out if goes back up. Don't feel like holding for another test to 8900
tbh consensus 2018 looks increasingly more like doge party. seems rocket is out of fuel by now, expected bump just didn't happen. anyone shares this? 
This still can go either way. Closed 25% from my 8500 short here and opened a long on ETHUSD of half the value of my short to prevent bigger losses if this barts up. Long is on a very tight leash just in case we do break down.

Will re-evaluate my short stop losses if/when this starts going up. For now they are around 8600 which still gives me room to short above 8700 if the downtrend still holds as resistance.

We goblin town boys. Sigh, barely missed my 8750 short...
Closing my [2x long from 8320 and 1x ethusd 690](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8j9i8m/daily_discussion_monday_may_14_2018/dyy3er9/?context=3) at 8760/736. Entering a short 3x at bitcoin 8760. I don't think we're going to make it past 8850, so my stops are layered at 8875-8900. Lots of resistance overhead and no continued buying pressure. 
My poor, poor long from $9000 :<
Closed my short for another small loss at around $8,740. 

Switched to long at around $8,800

Edit: don't follow me yet. Market still needs to break $8,870 to confirm. 
Whos trading the UP/DOWN's on BitMEX? Any insights into how I can build smart trading strategies combining these with perp/futs?
Short so I'll just tell myself this is a descending triangle and it should play out like that.  https://imgur.com/XtwuEOn (credit goes to haserfauld for point it out to me earlier today)

Just like being long and watching this ascending triangle.... https://imgur.com/Mk1TEuq (though the volume profile on that isn't as fitting as the current one)

It would be just perfect for this downward episode that started with an ascending triangle that broke down to conclude with a descending triangle that breaks up.

Edit: tinfoil hat ;)  that attempted break up right after I posted that.  Which one of you did that ;P  https://imgur.com/gHAJOqW
It seems to fit Wyckoff distribution perfectly:

Bitcoin dominance might form a double bottom. It is currently around 36\-37&#37;. The only scenario where a double bottom becomes reality is when Bitcoin and the whole crypto market goes to Goblin Town. 
Hopium: The eve round bottom we were all hoping would confirm on the weekly has morphed into a cup and handle
Bad news?  It's good that I added to my short just before that dropped...lucky but good.
Man, /u/_chewtoy_ I feel bad for you today man. But perhaps it's a sign to trust your first instincts and not overtrade. We can all be guilty of it. 
Ahh to open a short now or wait. Shorting the bottom seems like a terrible move but this feels like it could fall through any moment now.

Edit: instant regret.
Still over 30k longs open...so at what price will it take for them to close now??? What's the next level of support? 
So are we going back to the 7k range?  I'll probably go all in if we hit low 7's or high 6's again.
I covered most of my short at $8120.  Just trying to scalp a bounce, but will reshort if we get a different one.  Short the DCBs seems to be the smart strategy.
volume right now making this (downward move from 8,500 on BFX) look like a fakeout, just what I'm seeing, could change quickly

edit: parenthesis 

edit: lol I was right and downvoted, typical r/bitcoinmarkets
At the risk of getting myself in trouble for discussing alts again.. BCH hard fork occurred at 12:00:00 UTC today, which could have caused some profit taking from buyers, as this was around the time BTC started dumping. In addition, consensus ends tomorrow. I’m not seeing much upcoming news in the short term to justify new buyers to scoop up these BTC sells. Hopefully this can continue going up once people are done “selling the news” though.

Just waiting for another inverted bart to prove me wrong.
All aboard the bart. We'll be arriving at the destination 8730 within the next few hours, please put your seatbelt on as it may be turbulent.

Edit: We have taken off. 
I keep being downvoted because moonboys don't want to hear about the swing down, so this will be my last post with a prediction.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/3jHz6E80

We need another bear flag down to maintain this channel. We could Bart up but it can't stay for long. So my money is we swing down to the next rung. 8.3 or 8.1. 
Small update on a possible model going forward after a rejection at the down treading line. 

My previous model was on [this chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/YhmXhjgG/) showing we have completed a W2 ABC correction and 8.2k was the floor for now. There are two problems with this model that are concerning me.

1. The channelling is not lining up nicely, waves of the same degree should be contained in the channel but ending over/under throw is acceptable.
2. The C Extension Target was not hit cleanly.
3. The price action coming off the bottom pivot has been decidedly weak and should be moving far more implusivly.

With the rejection at the down tread line it opens up [this model for consideration](https://www.tradingview.com/x/dCCo5fiA/) as we can draw a valid channel from the point of origin through a B point project a bottom line from A.

This brings the 7.8k target into play again as well as a lower target of 7.2k, see chart for details. Also a drop here today to those levels or at least below 8.4k would give us that [TD9 Buy signal](https://www.tradingview.com/x/3BNW95nB/). If we reverse off either of those levels today or tomorrow I would certainly be a buyer.

We could consolidate up here and break the down treading line and that would invalidate the shortterm bearish case. That could be a breakout buy to be had, the breakout of the [W1 pivot posted previously](https://www.tradingview.com/x/k1kbtF9S/) is also still on the cards.

Disclosure: Flat BTC(As of 8.2k), no positions.
spike up and then spike down in one 5 min candle 


I was bullish until now, but I begin to think a little short squeeze now and then won't save this, and that albeit a bit weirdly formed we have a legit bear flag on the 1D that could bring us to 7.5k. On thing is sure I won't be caught catching knives here...
Korea FUD over. Upbit cleared of any wrongdoing by audit. 

https://www.ccn.com/upbit-audit-confirms-south-koreas-biggest-cryptocurrency-exchange-not-at-fault/
The trend since the 10k test has obviously been down. And just recently we got another bearish signal - namely a bearish cloud twist on the double 6h Ichimoku chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/sIYQWcAo/

The double 6h cloud has been spot on with support so far. According to this, the support to look for right now is 8.3k. The R/R for a long at that level would be decent, with stops under 8.1k or so.

If we break below 8.3k, we'll have to zoom out: https://www.tradingview.com/x/iXMU9x55/

The target for the big bear flag we're in now is around 7.4k, but 7.8k could provide some support too.

If that breaks down we're looking at 6.9k I think, which is the ascending support line from the Nov 12 bottom.
I think we'll just keeping barting our way up and down and keep painting this bear flag until consensus finishes up before we fall through again.

If RSI is calculated with closing price, do you use the wick or close of the candlebar when trying to identify an RSI divergence?
All cash now until we cross over daily EMA12. Daily chart perspective: any higher low over 7k will support bullish continuation. At the moment, downside > upside. I'll be the first to admit I have no idea what's going on now, so that's how I'll be playing.
u/_chewtoy_, I'll direct this to you since you're the only one I know who trades the June futures.

How do you typically enter your positions? Order books are so thin that placing a large limit order will typically move the price away from a desired entry. So I'm wondering if it's best to just setup several small limit orders, even though the price could get away from you, or just one big market order? Getting in and out of the June/Sept futures always feels like a hassle but the fees are obviously way more reasonable
[removed]
Man I knew it would dip at May 16th but at least wait for consensus to end! Someone got impatient, any large market sell orders responsible for this dip? 
This is really cool - all RSI from the 5min to the 1W are at roughly 50.
Seems the vicious oscillations starting with the Dec drop have now finally been damped out - my gut feel is onward and upward from here.
(edit - guess I should change my flair)
So this might get heavily downvoted or lead to a ban. Worth the risk if it helps even one person. I used to be an eth maximalist and lost a shit ton of potential profits in 2nd half of 2017 by refusing to get on the btc train.  Even longed eth btc once btc broke 10k and rode the wave down almost nearing liquidation. That was my huge opportunity cost of staying in eth. 

Right now the tide seems to be turning, 1D bull flag breakout on eth btc a couple of days back. Any dip gets bought up with volume, just observe the wicks. 

So for the new folks, don’t be stubborn like me. Sometimes the easiest trade is portfolio reallocation. Recognise the market forces and set your sails in the direction of the market. Much easier than timing the perfect long or short.

Edit: Final piece of advice, if/when eth btc gets parabolic or flippens, get the f**k out. I love eth but I will certainly get out of it goes parabolic. 
This weekly pivot chart is the only chart that matters right now; selling pressure is the lowest it has been since January's descent and is about to hit an absolute low right as key 8.5 range is being tested.  I doubt this will have enough steam to take BTC much lower. Consolidation occurring at this price level.  Recipe for mother-of-all-BGDs.

Edit: Corrected the chart for BITFINEX https://imgur.com/a/N6DCfnh
clear accumulation, reminds me of the chop at 6k few weeks ago. Anyone selling/shorting is asking to get cucked.
Managed to grind in the flag I shared yesterday without any decisive move to either side. Seems like we're making somewhat of a pennant since our BGD yesterday, which normally would indicate another leg up, however I'm more inclined to say buyers are losing steam a little bit. 

Either way, bbands are getting tight again so we'll probably see some action in the next couple of hours. breakout level = 8850 (resistance line from 10k attempt) breakdown level = 8550.

Good luck all! 
Can anyone remember the last time we were in such a crappy range? 8650-8900 for 24 hours+
I don't do TA, but am very interested following this sub and picked up a few terms. Could this be a possible Big W incoming with a BGD? 
So what exactly needs to happen for another December like bull run to happen? Because its honestly starting to feel like its a pipe dream that has little chance to happen and we are stuck in this crytpo purgatory forever.
If just 10,000 rich people hold wealth in BTC, it will maintain it's value. 

The market cap right now is reflecting an extremely pessimistic view of BTC's prospects. Main concerns: high probability of government interference or fundamental flaw in code. 

But IMO, the implicit probability of these concerns are completely off the mark. 

These are not worthy long term concerns. - Paraphrasing Naval Ravikant

Held my short from the 12th at 8400 through a pump, chance to close at break even, BGD, and now here. Had closed about 20% at break even before BGD and readded shorts on our way back down. One of the more patient trades I made, now if only I can get a good entry, patience, and a good exit all in the same trade...
Anyone else short from the 8700-8850 range and feeling extremely uneasy about their position? 

It just seems like BTC wants to go up. Any slight dump is immediately gobbled up

Bart pattern almost completed, why do bulls keep falling for this ?
Good luck trading this shit, we are at the mercy of degen market makers.

This can go up to 10k in the near term, but we will see sub 6k this year.

Asserting "Eth is leading BTC" needs to be followed up with credible evidence. You cannot make an unsupported claim and use that as the bassis for breaking rule 2.

Rhetorical gymnastics will earn you a day in the sin bin.
Lets take a quick look at the contradicting signals on the Bitcoin market versus the US Dollar.

Taking a look at the chart we can clearly see that we have indeed entered a new bearish downtrend, with resistance looking solid as a rock around $8800 – $9100. There are many contradicting signals, such as a small bull flag inside of a much bigger bearish flag.

I added the purple dotted line to indicate the new bullish trend developing on the shorter time frame, with support around $8000 – $8400 at the time of writing this report. This bullish momentum is confirmed by the Awesome Oscillator, however the PPO indicator has already begun contradicting its neighbor.

When we take a look at the 1 Day candles we can see the emergence of a possible triangle, which is a classic in the crypto world. On the medium time frame for me I have support in at around $7000 – $7100, and would consider adding to my longs should the market dip that low.

As a final note I would just like to add that there is not much volume going into this week and it is most likely that the next burst of buying or selling will determine our trajectory. Please feel free to discuss this trade idea with our community on Discord. Safe trades.

Makes me more bullish for crypto as a whole,  and not worried about these "dips"

Edit: Look, the point of the post is to show that bigger names (even if it's just a partial affiliation) are getting more involved with crypto. The other day I saw an IBM commercial talking about blockchain being aired on CNN. Widespread adoption might happen faster than we expect.

This is good for crypto
What do you guys thinking about this?  At Tradingview yesterday I read posts stating that rather than so\-called whales, the current pump and dump price manipulations are more likely carried out by exchanges, particularly Bitfinex, by using thether.  In the original words of the poster, davefishbbq, 

*"Tether, AKA as monopoly money the exchanges print themselves have long  been rumored to be causing huge price increases, and dumps. The  exchanges could make tether, buy coins themselves and drive up price.  Then sell them later for profit. In the last 6 months as scrutiny has  come on this practice, tether\(USDT\) has decreased.I have watched it for  month it's normally 17\% or less of the total market value. Today when  prices started towards 8200  massive buys with Tether started. This went  against every TA chart and opinion. But it happened. It is so huge it  surpassed the Yen which is always the number 2 in market value. DOUBLED  IT!!!!! Yes I think it's important, it shows someone, probably the exchanges  themselves are quite literally propping up the price to create momentum,  they can say the consensus did it, But it's not, it's TETHER. it will  slowly be sold off as regular buyers come back with FOMO "*

Anyway, here's the link to the discussions:

Get ready for a big green Candle gents
Has news/fundamentals had any relevance since November? I know there's the occasional selloff triggered by "news", like the Binance hack, the Gox wallet scare, even the GDAX BCH spectacle in December, but these were all excuses to dump rather than fundamental changes in the market. It seems to me that the market has yet to reconnect with its fundamentals, that maybe we left fundamentals behind somewhere around 5K with the Korea FUD.

Thoughts?

Well, BitMEX CEO just predicted Bitcoin price to hit $50k in 2018. I don't get it. It's just like if some whale decided to contradict him and try to prevent all the consensus hype.

Tell me why this is invalid or doesn't matter:

https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/activeaddresses-btc-eth.html#6m
I suppose that what might actually be the level headed play is to remain on the sidelines until 48 hours after the Consensus event ends. There was, after all, a great deal of talk about how the event would lead to a pump and then dump. 

Intermittent bouts of rabid market activity after endless hours flat lining on low volume daily doesn't provide much in the way of directional guidance, at least for myself.     

In addition, there was a comment earlier regarding the possible move by large investors to buy into the market off of information or insight gained at Consensus. While there may be real interest, it will take time (at least a month) before any materially sized investor could actually "pull the trigger". There are internal procedures which need to be completed not to mention other logistical issues. 

Trade well my friends.   

EDIT - Am looking for there to be continued volatility in price over the next two to three hours. The East Coast is only just getting caffeinated and most haven't yet processed the price move(s) we've just seen. In addition, I suspect that it was a long/late night for many Consensus participants.

NASDAQ opens fee-less crypto exchange next month. You need u/SloppySynapses sized balls of steel to short bitcoin now.

Don't underestimate possible price jumps during consensus - it just takes one big guy getting hyped to create a BGD, and you easily get hyped during crypto conferences.
Max Keiser is a con. That twit was telling everyone to buy silver during the commodity bull run in 2011. Had ridiculous price targets like $10k silver, $100k Gold. Now he's doing the same with BTC and will cost unsuspecting people lots of money.

Moved my stop on my short closer in, about 8900 now that I can monitor the charts. If you were looking for "breaking the resistance convincingly" [this wasn't it though.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/QSy6119M/) Not super confident on my short but not bailing yet. I put my monocle on and will watch this carefully. 
i'm guessing this is the buy the rumor sell the news on the coinbase institutional features getting rolled out
Going short here, reason being it's near the bottom of the channel and despite the barting around we haven't really convincingly challenged 8900 over the past few attempets. S/L at just over 8900. Target is mid to low 7k's
Big holder getting out again. Must not be a believer in bigger money coming in.
It's a green one.
Could we see a sudden rebound after the bart? Like witnessed on April 18. 
I see another larger\-scale pennant. Think we will wobble in that one till the conference is over and than break down when the participants of the conference are on their way home. 
If your short from 8700+ it would be a good time to lower your stops down.

There should really be a *post only* setting for the 'close' button on Mex.
The breakout here is very very weak. Volume is weakish and the inability to keep the price above 8.8k is weakish Not in position since yesterday, but this looks more and more like a short. 
BTC is ruining the whole crypto ecosystem.  Just let it die and start over with something better.

[Edit] Where one coin cannot dominate.  Let's others flourish and not hold everything else back.
the longer BTC hovers around $8500, the bigger the dump will be if it doesn't manage to break up from here. It would have been a less severe dump if it crashed/broke down 8 hours ago. If it breaks down in a few hours, the accumulated power to push down the bars will be much greater due to force-down accumulation, and it can be expected that price will crash to sub $7.7k within mere hours.
My prediction is sideways, maybe between 8k\-9.5k until the next breakout. I can't see BTC taking another huge hit.
Coinbase announcing  Coinbase prime: [https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase\-institutional\-deea317d23af](https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-institutional-deea317d23af) haven't read through this yet. "**Announcing the Coinbase Suite of Institutional Products"**

>Coinbase Markets will introduce new features like low latency chefs, on\-premise hooker services, institutional pharmaceutical access, and settlement and clearing services for various darknets.

I'd like to know that if you guys followed my comments on the way up in the past month, I said why it wouldn't hold. Went further than I thought it would but it turn back around and *is* cratering.

Looks extremely similar to the 2014 crash.

I think we'll get another pump soon. will step out below 650.

We are in an area of an admittedly arbitrary trendline I drew from bitstamp 2012 lows to the local low and it seems to be acting as support for now. This trendline also acted as resistance for most of 2014-2016. I am somewhat confident that this area of current support can act as our launchpad to a new high sometime in late 2018 / early 2019
As much as I believe in TA, shorting into the biggest cryptocurrency event of the year just seems reckless. The introduction of new strong fundamentals is a high possibility. Really best to just sit out and watch the markets calm down before picking a direction.
So who's shorting the bottom here? 

edit: a lot of people I guess
Well my short I had added around 8k is now in the green. Keep tanking bitcoin!

Can't wait to make my next position. My opening will probably be around 4 million. Super excited.

thoughts on this?
Looks like the bulls keep buying the traps, so we will continue the bart movements.. pathetic.
I'm mildly encouraged that our brief foray out of our local downtrend channel wasn't super aggressively rejected. If we touch again around 8750/8800 today I'd get local bearish in a jiffy though.

Maybe we'll BGD out of these choppy waters and play with all those horizontal resistances though.

No position currently. Got tiny trading stack to long \~8820 or short at \~8595.

You can cut your losses where they are now.  If you think the price is dropping further, then get out of your long.  If you think it is more likely to rise, and would buy here, then stay with it.

The absolute worst is to feel helpless and trapped in a position...been there many times.
Hang in there bro. Do what ya gotta do to live to fight another day.
If it was me i would try to hold until 8200 to see if the support is there. If 8200 breaks it starts to get dangerous. 
if you fart, bubbles will pop to the surface.
To be fair the last few days were extremely challenging
Day trading doesn't involve trading every second/minute/hour/or even day. Nobody can consistently profit from trading the chop we've seen over the last 6 hours \- unless it's arb bots or some strategy of the sort. Still vital to exhibit patience and wait for *your* setups. If it's not there, it's not there. \(And it's certaintly "not there" today lol!\)

\-day trader
Same
...Still well within the flag.
Stay calm good sir. It happens to all of us.
I mean, your stop was less than a percent of your entry, underneath the resistance at 8850. Unless you're intending to babysit your positions, I would suggest a larger distance from entry to stop, and to aim for above the resistances or below the supports.
My limit buys and sells missed the bottom and tops if this range by 2 and 6 dollars respectively. I'm still salty. 
Thank you for contributing to the Arthur Hayes foundation

I think this is the one mate (if it's ever gonna do it, that is). Glad u didn't give up. I hope for your sake it doesn't bart up lol 
So did you have a stop market order set in order to get that position in? because you literally got in position seconds before a $100 drop.  
Third times a charm 
It only dropped by $100 too. I’m starting to get really confused by this buying pressure. I’m still squarely in the Wyckoff distribution boat, but I’m impressed with how long this has been propped up so far. Maybe people are waiting til after consensus to finish the dump?
This is mirroring bounce 1.0 quite closely. If an underlying thesis, bull traps all the way down in a must-deflate bubble is valid, how much weight would you put on the market continuing to match the past pattern?

That would have it as falling to mid 7s here before a bounce, a failed attempt on 85, followed by a 6k test. Since it is aftershock 2.0 this time everything would be a bit more mild: lower volume, slower timescales, less absolute dollar movement.
What are you watching for stops? If this enters the flag again is better to close no? 
I'm not sure if I agree. I think I've identified a very interesting Bart fractal that might recur again and manifest itself as an uptrend over time. The only problem is defining the exact channel in which it runs and it's a little choppy. 

Chart (sorry for messiness or potential inaccurateness, I had to cut some wicks here and there.): https://www.tradingview.com/x/jDrjiQgs/ 
The drop from 9.3 was fishy AF
crypto is not and has never been manipulated
nobody is accumulating, people are dumping, if they were accumulating price would go up but its not its going down and soon it will be sub $3k

it is obvious that bull market is done for, over
end of year price is more likely to be $500 then $5k


I bet we wick it just to scare the living crap out of everyone and then pump back to 8500 for max pain. 
don't have a cow, man
Yes, no way to trade this on the shorter time frames.  Unless you just buy every BRD and short ever BGD.   That works sometimes.
that Bart is still higher than the $8300 we were at before the bart up

frankly I'm still waiting for $8000 to go down for the real bart to show up(to balance out the $1500 up move we had that started this whole thing)
I think this is what will happen:

Shorts pile on. Some Bulltard whale will squeeze it (kinda like how homer strangles Bart in the Simpson’s), we touch 9k consolidate. Longs pile on and voila (which is French for “Then I found out”):

sub 8k

I call it: The itchy and scratchy show
I see it as well. Order form is still there, but it's below the blue exclamation mark box thingy.
same
The last "Update" an hour or so ago put it there.
edit - back to normal
Too risky to scalp 8300-8600 again, but I bet it holds, we bounce all the way to 8900 a d then the music will really stop imo

How underwater? If you were willing to sit that long underwater why not wait a bit more? You could just set stops this time
u/wardser and u/SloppySynapses hit the nail on the head when they said that it looks like someone is trying to ladder the price down as they unload. And that seems to be exactly what is happening
Well that's manipulation in my books. Coordination, manipulation... same stuff in this case.
Same here on all counts.

> It seems so coordinated... not manipulated but coordinated. As if someone just decided "welp time to market sell within a 15m candle".

It was blatantly obvious that this nonsense was going on last year during the crazy bull run.  But was downvoted for suggesting that in here.  Now that the longs are losing their net worth by the second, they are slowly coming around to accepting the obvious. 

> it's not manipulation or whales getting more coins, but I think it's something else.

It is to get more money, whether it be BTC or fiat makes no difference. There were bullshit pumps out of nowhere all last year and made no sense from a TA perspective. The price was artificially pumped to $20K (with some FOMO help from the plebs) and now it is either being manipulated downwards or just allowed to freefall without the artificial support.

Unbelievable. 

You'd think there'd have been some substance behind the audit/investigation. 

Nope. All easily verifiable via blockchain.

Wondering whether regulator market manipulation was the intention.
Great news. Thanks.
Nothing but UPbit's claims. This is like Bitfinex and Tether proving their USDT is backed by saying that it is. It means nothing.
It doesn't look for any reason to make a major move up...just down.  What does that tell you?
8500 fighting hard, to be honest i do not understand why given the recent movements. I would open a long at 8200/8300, not now.
Dammit got stopped out of my long.   Reopened long here. Loose stops 
Happy bday bro
No, Bitcoin gifts you with cheap coins amigo.

Happy Birthday
Happy bithday wish you good gains
Tribalism isn't necessarily bad, as long as you're open to contrary views and argumentation. 
Please hurry and sell 
You and me both!!! It won’t go back up until I sell and I’m not selling the bottom anymore.
Bulls are pissed at you
4-dimensional forex-crypto chess
Personally I always trade out into EUR so I can take my profits without the hassle of converting.
Same here. I also prefer to go into USD. First, USD markets have more liquidity. Second, the value of USD is in an uptrend. I'm on Bitstamp, so I have only EUR, and USD as options.
I live in Europe so I go into Euro when I can.

If you go into dollars it is like a new trade you are taking usd vs Euro which is ok if you want to be in that trade but remember it is a trade
In UK, but I use euro mostly, because SEPA rocks.

A bunch of USD on finex though.
bull flags break down, bear flags break up. Get with the program
so below 8.4k daily close = buy?
Why not wait a lil bit tho damn 

Massive sells on finex

I went fishing the other day after two really shitty trades.

Made it all back on the next one

And I got free fish.

Do you like to fish?
I think you made the right choice. I have full trust on your analysis skills but these two last trades felt rushed. 
Hope you clear your head and get back in your A game so i can follow you into profits instead of sinking even more at each trade i enter.
We still love you, don’t worry. 

No, no homo 
You really did nothing wrong here though. The resistance line did clearly break. Don't beat yourself up over a fake-out. 
probl. for the best. the market wants to go down it seems, whales want to push it for maximum profit. these BGD can destroy a position or lure someone into a position, its ugly.
If I lose much more money, I’ll give you a stroke for 10$
Be grateful that the market wants to be done quick with it. Nothing worse than a slow bleed.
>  I hope whoever is doing it is happy with themselves.

did you sell? and rebuy? and resell?

Just maybe: we *are* all *The Bart*.

And frankly, we should all be (a little) ashamed for that. It makes the market just look immature.

and do you say the same when there is a BGD out of nowhere? gotta take the good with the bad
Stealing money from you and I most likely makes them very happy.
At this point it feels like a group of whales have theirs bots set up to force a bunch of 2-4% trades up and down. 
Long term, yes.

Short term, not until I've capitalized on others' impatience & fear. ;)
What I personally want from Bitcoin is to make me money. That's the only reason I'm here. 
Absolutely. The question is, can it compete?
Actually I have many wants; I would not claim to just want one thing
Thanks this gives me something to watch.
Nice job man. I’m still holding mine as well and added for a 100% of stack on that same bounce to 8570. Stops at break even. But kinda worried about the lack of follow through on sellers. It’s like bears are taking the stairs for once. 
Here it is.  *Slow clap*
> I've come within 0.2% of my stops 5 times in the last 8 hours.

Go pick some lottery numbers!
No one does. 

Tbh this isn’t that bad just wait for a break of 10k for a target of about 12k where strong horizontal resistance lies. Or a break down of 8k for 7k target (triangle support) or 6k for a strong horizontal support. 

That’s what I’d do. 
Just look at the agenda of Consensus and you'll get an idea:  https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2018/live/
Yes, the strong resistance at 8900 is still there, apparently. Would wait before entering a position.
My read is that "whales" are accumulating for the purpose of profiting in the Bitcoin market. They want to suppress the price so they can buy at the lowest cost possible (that's what happened this weekend) but they also don't want to kill the market dead, otherwise they won't be able to profit from their coins.

I think "whales" use BGCs to prop up the market and inject a bit energy into the buyers. We will continue to bounce around this sub-10k range until whichever entities are causing these movements feel like they have accumulated enough coins.
I have zero evidence, but it seems reasonable to me that large holders would test the market with large-ish orders to see how strong resistance is. Then if they see significant movement, they can make smaller orders to pump the price, then sell back into the surge to make profits. If the resistance is strong enough, they sit back and wait to retest later or accumulate on the way down.
Liquity. If you want to buy 300 BTC and you felt it was about to break up, you have to buy into a wall or your buys will fill at a higher price. Same will selling. It's easy to buy/sell small amounts without driving the price, but not with large amounts. This is also why small cap alts are so easily manipulated (very little capital needed to change the price).
Your long looks like it's going to get stopped out
If this doesn't break down under 8270 then bears are going to have serious issues. It sets up a hidden divergence on many time-frames.
Can chill here for long enough to go much further. 
pretty damn sure
That's a great entry. I have about the same stop as you but my CA is about 8750. Have been too scared to add at the top to raise it.
Yes the chart suggests another BRD to create the upside down Bart formation, but I'm betting it finally breaks to the downside.  I hope I'm wrong though, because that may be very ugly.

EDIT:  There it goes...damn.
Does the distribution factor in manipulation?
Have a link to the model and chart comparison?
When they will finally announce Coinbase Customer Support product?
> Coinbase already offers the deepest pool of liquidity to the largest number of participants in the cryptocurrency space. 

Ehhhh
coinbase prime looks like bitfinex v 0.1
Everyone and their mother will short the next visit to 8700, so I expect something amazing to happen
I think it's the ICO market.  Buy BTC to exchange for ICO coins.  Once they receive the BTC, sell it off to gain operating capital.   If you are a whale you probably bought BTC several years ago (for less than $1,000) so there is no hurry to sell like this or buy more or you could care less if the price was $6K or $9K.   I also don't think there are many wealthy people that would buy large amounts of BTC above $8K except for that dumb chinese guy that bought 10,000 coins back in Feb.  He will probably dump soon.
So from 2011 to 2013 things were just insanely bipolar. From 2 dollars to 30 and back to 1 as well as the 2013 insanity.

2014 was depressing and we bottomed out in Jan 2015

basically from 2015 to 2017 things were just going up slowly.

160 200 250 350 (forever) 450 600 450 (finex hack) 700 (Trump&Brexit) 1000 750 (dump) 1250 (ETF) 880 (Bitcoin Unlimited FUD)

Of course there were larger dumps but it was largely due to lack of liquidity and there weren’t any 50%+ dumps that I remember. Big candles were sorta a thing, but not nowhere near what they are now

And then in early April 2017 everything changed and we got these insane pumps and drops. BTC would go from 1250 to 1600 in like 3 days and 1600 would never be seen again

then in 2018 the barts started, so I would say no... this is deff new
Works fine here.
its slow and it sometimes does not update price on the charts... but "working"
Seems to have come back to life for me. Thanks. 
I'd say wait until after another move towards 8200 or 8900 then put your bet on the opposite direction. That's what's been happening over and over for the last few days anyway. Of course, at some point it's going to do something even more erratic and break that pattern. 
I'd wait for a good setup before opening a position. Right now the price appears to be exactly in the middle between major resistance and support and it doesn't seem any more likely it's going to go one way than the other. If you just want to gamble - flip a coin.
Save the money for some risky bets on the World Cup coming up. More fun imo.
33% close now, 33% ~8400, 33% break-even stop.
I'm not a day trader and believe that the bigger money is to be found in longer term positions. My advice for your short, given how good the entry is, would be to look for at least $7800 - 7500. This price area has been one of the more interesting areas where higher volume trading has taken place, and which has served as both resistance to upward movements (8 Nov 2017 and 3 Apr 2018) and support to downward movements (17-18 March 2018). 

> only on bitstamp it went lower than the 5th to count for a 9 sequential

You mean the daily? It hit 9 on finex 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/LhVQktho/
Hesitant buying and profit taking results in a slow upwards climb, no one wants to sell the bottom.. Eventually the flag portion climbs so high that no one is willing to buy/cover their shorts so the price dumps again. People aren't as afraid of selling/shorting the bottom because the strength of the move is back. 

A descending channel followed by a large drop isn't a bear flag, it's just a descending channel. It has no target necessarily. 

But you're charting on the 5m which is loaded with noise and meaningless movements. I'd be wary of charting on anything less than the 15m charts unless you have specific reasons to do so. And even so, 2-4h+ is best imo.

The large pattern to watch is the bear flag on the 4-6h charts.

Lol I can't tell if you are serious :-p we are breaking down now?
8200 might survive 1 or 2 assaults. But I think its best to close any longs on the rebound if this gets down there 
Some people want to go on a suicide mission, Bears and bulls or few whales that are both are messing with the moral of traders and they are doing a good job. Cause some traders will go insane and reckless. 
OOPS
agree

Just dropped below 8.5k , doesn't look good, might really fall to $8k today!
[deleted]
I think many of us are long term bullish on crypto.. and FA is getting better .. but those deep water do take time to find their way to surface of the daily chop.

Since the downturn at $20k, the mid 8's have been very difficult to trade.. this action of price being yanked around happened both in Feb and March in the exact same range.  In this regard, your advice to sit out is probably the best move.
>Consensus is off the wall optimism. Deloitte is aggresively entering the space. AWS is here. CFTC and SEC officials offer their encouragement at every panel. Bankers are treating the space and the people with newfound respect.

You're correct on the good news. But once again, we had same optimistic perspective in 2014. We was hyped up by ETF and "wall streeet" stuffs back then and thought that the approval was imminent.

I don't think "good news" can save the bear market, just like bad news couldn't stop most recent bull market which started in 2016.
I'm doubtful about the effect of the consensus.  Given the hype and publicity you would think people would have started buying days before in anticipation of a major bull run. What we have seen however is a sell off leading to its opening and it doesn't seem to be lessening up. 
Deloitte, AWS, CFTC, SEC - none of them cares about the price of 1 BTC, and it doesn't at all have to translate into any changes in price either. They each have their own agenda.
Your'e a bull in denial, wake up : we're still in a bear market.
I still demand $3K

you can't compare bull markets and bear markets

at $20K bears demanded $18K

once the trend reverses and the price starts dumping this place will flip back 
I think Consensus is less of a driver and more of a reflection of where we are today. I'd say the reflection is pretty goddamn positive.
Nope, we're still looking for 3k-5k.  The stench of the consensus circle jerk will soon be behind us and BTC(as well as other cryptos) will still only have speculation as a primary use case.
The big worry is that *if* we do go lower than 7.8 then it could seriously disillusion a lot of people who carry around a belief that we will see 50-100k by year's end and who have been believing in the off the wall optimism. I personally would rather see steady growth than Bart swings
What are you talking about?

No supporting facts behind bears would be happy with 7.8, whatsoever, I see more people creeping out of denial by the day

Yeah corporates are getting into crypto, not BTC, they are interested in blockchain, blockchain can thrive and crypto markets can die
I agree. At 6.5k, the risk to reward ratio is quite good. I highly doubt it will go under that.
I wonder how much of this weird chop is from eth btc arb bots running triangular arbitrage 
Right when i used ethusd to hedge my short... Fml... 
I have it currently testing the resistance of the pennant from its recent high, which if it proves as support might give it a jolt for further upwards move, which I expect will mean BTC move in step to keep the ratio somewhat in line. 
Yeah. This kind of crap is getting way too frequent. Lack of liquidity does not explain everything.

Honestly, I get bearish every time I see this kind of fuckery. It just drives the retail traders out of the market and reduces liquidity even further making manipulation even easier. Still bullish long term on BTC but we really need to get over this whale filled small pond stage.
Looks like the light saber from the other week, but smaller scale.
Interesting. Hmm.
I feel like next 30 minutes will be fireworks. buying/selling is getting frantic it seems.
Could have been a test of the support line, maybe by the same entity which tested the resistance line 4 hours ago.

The resistance was rejected over 7 minutes but the support held within a single 1m candle. Looks pretty bullish to me.
Most people are more scared now of missing a big pump than they are a big dump. For 6 weeks now, it's been very clear. Buy The Dip is back in full force. Bears are still in the denial phase, much like bulls where on the way down. 
The market is composed of multiple players. Sometimes those players can have different agendas and have enough size do stuff like this
this is why i just keep my long from bit above 9k. Following the rules of never sell at a loss. I really can't tell what happens.
it wont.... after consesus it wil rise hard
Where is this meme with Bogdanov from? I hear it too many times but don't know what is it about.
prescient, well done
Its under 8.5k, what now?
Wow so you predicted BTC would drop a little, as did myself and many others, but without the need to draw lines on a chart 
sauce?

Is this Chaumian Credentials?

EDIt: [Yep](https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/05/14/microsoft-may-build-identity-system-with-bitcoin-lightning-network/) Chaumian Credentials on Lightning. Funny been working on this too for a while

Note: It doesn’t say Chamisn Credentials, but I think they’re going to be doing that. ACL is inferior to credential based systems and I doubt they will implement something that is obsolete. Credentials is the modern standard and basically how your Smart Cards work

if they are building anonymous chaumian credentials on Lightning: Credentials allow you to prove aspects of your identity in zero knowledge woth verifiable unlinkability

so you can prove you are over 18 or have the right to vote or whatever else, and if you prove it multiple times, the proofs appear to be coming from different people, i.e. two proofs are provably unlinkable to one another

You can add this proof to the Lightning Packets via a simple sub satoshi payment 
Dont think this market cares about news rn. There has been a steady flow of good news for a while now. 
thanks for sharing had no idea they were announcing tomorrow.  anything that could pump the price is welcomed.  so sick of this market
This is great publicity for bitcoin and all, but I find it hard to believe we’ll have a sustainable rally that won’t result in a sell off, if we even have a rally at all. 

There’s been a huge list of positive news since January and it hasn’t been enough for the bull to return.

I’m not personally counting on a rally, but I could very well be wrong. 

Regardless, this is positive news for bitcoin and the crypto space. 
We also knew about the chinese new year and wall street bonuses 1 day ahead.
But if you are sharing it... it's not new. The people who have known for months are selling into the people who think it is news.
There is already a company that offers online identities. It verifies who you say you are and everything. Nobody uses it.

Blockchain identity crap? Been hearing about it for almost 5 years now. Still not one out there because *nobody wants one*.

You say "Well Microsoft is making it", yeah and they made the ***Zune***. This is a few million dollars gamble by a company worth over half a trillion dollars. PR and extremely long shot gamble with couch cushion change.

We're literally in the age of people waking up and realizing how bad of an idea it is to post identity shit online even for the purposes of social media. What makes you think they are going to put identity information onto a blockchain? Even *if* it's encrypted.
And? BTC price could be $500 and the solution would still work 
On Sept futs, I've got a spattering of many tiny 0.5%ish buys in the lower 8s, and another in the upper 7s.  Gonna catch whatever wicks I can.  Then double the size of the position when it breaks out back up from there.

If it goes lower, I'm not sure if I let go of it, or DCA it.  Would probably hold out for a DCA in lower 7s as I only have a small portion of stack allocated in these orders and the loss is cheap enough to ride it all the way to the bottom of the large ATH symmetric triangle.

If I wasn’t in a long already this is what I would have done as well. 
Would it make sense to open two positions depending on where funding is at and just setting stops outside this range?
I'm in the same boat (8500 june futures). Right now, my stop is still sitting up above 8900. I'm really hoping for a continuation down another $150-ish so I can set a B/E stop and let it go from there. 

I'm debating taking a small loss and closing it now, but I feel like I held through the worst of this trade, so I might as well see if I can at least make a couple bucks off of it. 

edit: extra words 
Big surprise. When everyone expects and event to boost crytpo, it seldom does. But a lot of people say in the past it didnt boost the market until a little after the event finished. So who knows.
You have the opportunity you were waiting for.
told the bulls to buy and I didn't...damn me and my sensibilities but lack of discipline

Nice trade
It had so much hope too.  Rip.  I think it won’t be long before we’re back there though. Hang in there. 
Couldn't this fall short of 8900 again though?

Do you find two attempts more bullish than one? Seems to me like if we were going above 9k, we'd already be there on this pump
2 losses in a row, and immediately new position. Careful. In these situations instead of overtrading it's better to stay out and reflect on what went wrong. When you went short on your last trade I immediately thought 'he's gonna exit with loss'. So maybe you are missing something in your analysis. Good luck!
What happened to your short with stops about 8900? What changed your mind suddenly?
Whats the reasoning for the immediate switch? still have resistance ahead dont we?
Sounds like a move to throw Bogdanov off balance /s
Take my advice and don’t. I am down about 40% trying to swing trade. Raise your hand if you’re a reasonably smart human whose trades make them feel like a dumb piece of shit. Anyone? 
This encourages me to 100% Close all of my short, even though it should do the opposite 
Yeah I'm really not sure what to make of this. Though I've overused it today, this decline (bart) is higher then the previous "downbart" I think it would've already rolled over if we were to continue down as we did during our descent from 9.4k. Admittedly much here is based on speculation and partial guessing, but I'm still seeing strength in this formation somehow, and I think the downside isn't confirmed until we go below 8.4k, and even then it can still go either way... I'm just not sure how and where to draw the trends anymore...
Is there an extension of that chart? Asking for a friend.
So.. Where does that put us in the coming weeks?
He's hungry for publicity

Some of use are expecting just that.
Got to think it will continue to bleed lower and drop below 30% at some point this year.   I don't see how it can't with new fresh competition coming out all the time.

Although if gov'ts really shut down ICOs and call ETH a security, then that is a bullet in the back of its biggest competition.  The best way to succeed is to have your competition be made illegal.  Although that's what the Banks and gov'ts are doing to crypto in general.
I don't get it, the weekly chart looks plain ugly. Decreasing volume on the way to 10k, bearish engulfing last week, looks terrible imo.
We're looking for almost identical confirmation for the two formations. Confirmation of the cup & handle would result in a market move that would also confirm the A&E double bottom. It's just kicking the can down the road. Dropping volume and the hesitancy to confirm is part of the A&E formation.
this is turning a lot more into a “Sell in May and go away” scenario.

I think it’s all but guaranteed we revisit 7.5k

But not before maximum pain at 9k
No big deal. As always, my losses were small compared to my recent successful trades. 
a baghodlr never closes
I suspect there will be a fair amount of longs open below $7k from before the BGD, that are still in profit and won’t be feeling the hurt yet.
Looks to me like we may just need to make a higher low.

Also, u/\\\_*chewtoy\\\_* always said it would be really good for us to test the log resistance and bounce off it, and that's below 7500 for now. Hence, I think sub 8k is pretty much guaranteed at this point. But I doubt the games are over just yet. Bet we get a damn good bounce very soon. After that, I think I'll be selling my trading stack to fiat. Not leveraging a short or anyting, just plain old Myspace\-Coin \(USD\)... well EUR, but you get the point
if btc goes down between 6~7k no doubt it could reach 4000s
Inverted bart proves nothing, it's just a short squeeze and there's no followup since a while. Bull runs start by a long period of accumulation and those barts everywhere prevent it.
soft fork
Sigh,

*"opens jar of vaseline"*

OK, I'm ready!
[deleted]
This sub is schizo today..
Looks about right... if we move up to the line again in a bear flag .. and get kicked off once more, I think we can expect a week long downtrend forecasted on the daily
Idk man Bart's looking up again.

Chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/BI4rcWK5/
bro there is a post two below yours that says "expeting sub 8.2 by day's end" with zero analysis, and it has 4 upbarts. 

my post saying that this move from 8500 down is a fakeout is at -3
Thanks again, love your analysis combining TD and waves.
In a one minute candle actually. It's a Wipeout candle. Clears liquidity on both sides. A much bigger one happened about a month ago as well.
Classic bogdi
i believe the correct term now is a "double-ended sith lightsaber" or something along those lines
yeah holey moley. 
Actually in a 1 min candle. Trigger some stoplosses before the next big move?
But you also won’t be shorting either, right?
set your timer for the next one. someone should do some TA on the Korea FUDs
Do you happen to know his performance history? I have run into his twitter before but I dont know if he is good
Everytime Peter does a prediction the opposite happens
Here's a [custom Stoch RSI on 1D chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/SJweQRQL/) I use for a macro forecasting on where the market is heading. While my first sell point is too early to be a replica of Peter's chart, the second one matches up quite nicely. I wonder if he's using something like this (or a combination of medium-long run indicators) or if his model is just beyond comprehension to us normies.
Ignore the wicks if you are analysing RSI. 
rsi is calculated off candle bodies not wicks so it doesn't make sense to use wicks for divergences 
You mean market/taker order right? Limit orders with post only checked will only be filled if someone sells or buys into it. you get the exact price you want with negative fees (bitmex pays you for getting it filled) 
If you're going to be brief, at least be accurate.
Well yea there was a 1k buy wall at $8.2. I saw a 700 coin market sell 
everyone and their mother was waiting for consensus to end 

these people are still waiting for a last minute announcement 
now you should edit your post :P
Eth isn't going anywhere once Bitcoin goes into bear mode. In fact, the inability for Eth to reach at least $770 today was what alerted me to the possibility that yesterday's pump might have been one gigantic fakeout, given that Eth has been one of the stronger coins technically recently. 

Finally, look at the ETHBTC weekly chart. Is that recent rise, which is currently rounding off, coupled with the obscenely low volume, something you would consider to be bullish? 

I would genuinely be very cautious in this market now, because I am seeing the same signs of price weaknesses in both Bitcoin and alt coins.
Is this based only on Coinbase? Because they overall have been decreasing in market share.
I think we can say the same about buy pressure. It is too weak to go upwards. Hence, we stuck in this range.
You're in denial phase. 
What does this mean you are expecting a quick rebound?
downside breakout already at 8630 \(still could be a fake out and we get back into it, but the line gets violated around 8630 at the moment\)
09/05/ was 9250 to 9380 for 30 hours, And that didnt end well
Best comparison is 9-15 march which ended up as a big bearflag and also had a big fakeout to 9.8k. 

You don't predict a BGD or BRD. they are entirely random, more random than the charts we analyze that are already random

Honestly it's kinda sad that we see it all as a joke/meme. It's not particularly entertaining or fun to see btc rocket up $400 in 10m just to dump down 8 hours later. 

This is probably the beginning of more sophisticated Quant guys and their bots taking advantage of day traders. over time day traders will lose money and quit. 

I suggest everyone here look at longer trends and start developing skills to swing trade and trade trends rather than day trade and scalp.

What's happened to chew the past few days is probably a sign of things to come
open your buttcheeks and find out
You don't really need ta tbh. You can gauge the direction by asking yourself this question : how well is doing the hope of 100k btc?
Nothing, just time. Overhauling money in modern times is about the biggest challenge imaginable, and only time will change minds, slowly. It’s happening naturally all around us, the concept is catching on even if the price doesn’t show it.

Just wait, years not days.

Holding and btfd are not just memes, they are the first wave of people using Bitcoin as a store of value. Remember, coins are limited.
ask your friends when they'll buy 

my friend said he'd buy bitcoin when it hits $100 lol. then he bought WAVES at $5 and read their website description to me for 10 minutes straight. no idea what the fuck WAVES is 

this was about a month ago
That feeling has to increase while the price increases.
all regular folks don't care about BTC , ask your friends they all think its a bubble thats popped or popping , to0 risky to "invest" in.We need them to feel FOMO , when will they feel it is the real question.
For those unaware of this argument heres the data point http://bitcoinsperperson.com/

I believe this market is driven by unit insanity; people are trading 5 pennies for a dollar believing that, more of x is better than less of y, as they have no idea what the value of x and y should be.

As soon as something that isn't the ponzi scheme shitshow of the altcoin market is actually priced in bitcoin, I believe satoshis wild ride will start in earnest

Unless you're day trading, and trading within 1k, I don't see how with this volume, resistance, long term downtrend (3m/6m) and history (see 2014 bubble pop - eerily close in structure to this bubble) anybody could be bullish. I can only assume people live in the hourly timelines.
yep it's quite ridiculous. Whatever the hell is actually going on, be it manipulation or what... we are all just little pawns here, play things for the people with the big cash. 


Looking forward to the panel with Arthur Hayes at Consensus 2018. It's scheduled to begin in 30 minutes. [Livestream here](https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2018/live/).
First time I saw Arthur Hayes talk, wow that was great.
Awesome quote (paraphrased):

Lots of well known financial personalities and organizations talk down on bitcoin, yet we don't see them shorting the futures.
Do you mean $8,400 - $8,800?
I'm with you. Have left 50% stack from 8580. Starting to move stops lower and lower to lock profits. Might not get the best exit but don't want to risk a BGD appearing and stopping me with less profits 
yea just remember how long we stalled at $9700-9900 for 
Honestly I feel like there's just indecision in general. I'm admittedly short from 8824 but I feel like it could honestly go either way at this point.

Might close my short regardless though soon.
A little. Remember when we hit 7.4K and had that blow off top? Then we would have a second sell off even when bulls pushed passed critical resistance then we got pushed all the way to 5.4(after trading above the log trendline for over a day IIRC). Market is choppy because its just bots bots and impatient people/traders trying to squeeze every penny at the moment I expect. I got a few shorts on different coins open mostly on bitmex at the moment. Most of my stuff is hedged with a CA around 9.35(I think)K if we go above 12K and to 17K(I'll cut short on a strong close above 9700 I guess) then I'll ride those up and try and make money on the way up. I'm just not convinced we're done bottoming yet. Only time will tell. 

Anyone who is sure it is over and we're off to 100K next year or that it's going to drop below 1400 and be seen as a bad asset to hold(Because 1. Seriously WTF does that 2.Which for bitcoin wouldn't be a bad thing really in terms of the technology) .It certainly would be bad for immediateness dominance on CMC from which investors likely look to see what up and coming -and half of them knowing fuck all about bitcoin does not inspire confidence. Value added would be you drop hopefully most ICOs show that they are just good marketing and some tech-lingo savvy database designers solving absolutely fuck all maybe the real focus will move to bitcoin. Sub 1400 would be a disaster though especially for more than a day or two or it's when the big boys take over and buy (but game theory dictates to hard fork and change to something asic proof because BTC is just an agreement between people because the soul of BTC is concensus...)

EDIT: Holy shit let me try and make sense of this. I've been awake all night....
EDIT2: That better
I watched it live. It was epic. 1k BTC down the drain. 
[deleted]
thought my computer was glitching out, wtf.
I don’t think anyone expected this to blst past 8900 after the tease we got the last 24 hours
the real trap will be when all the bulls load up at $8300 and then the bottom falls out and they get trapped at $8300 while this thing goes down to $6K
Don't you reckon this is their method to "Shake out the sheeple" to accumulate more? 
try under 3k
I thought he said "we rent them". Did I not hear right?
"rent". Relevant links: https://twitter.com/CryptoHayes/status/996074905782423552 and https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/14/those-lambos-parked-at-the-bitcoin-conference-are-just-a-promotion.html
I think what makes moderating inherently difficult is that the rules were made to be broken. Not every rule can be followed 100% if a particular comment contributes to the quality of the discussion. For example, if XRP is labeled a security, I would like to know the potential impacts on the bitcoin market even if it does not relate to bitcoin directly.

I agree that the quality of the discussion has improved. Moderation is definitely necessary; just look at what /r/cryptocurrency has done to try to combat the overwhelming number of memes and shills. However, I think people should in general respond critically to comments they disagree with rather than simply down-voting or reporting them, and mods should issue warnings and delete comments before handing out bans. These types of actions would help contribute to the quality of the discussion, rather than anger people and discourage them from contributing.
I am very happy with the increased mod presence and agree with some other commenters that this has enhanced the quality of posts on this subreddit to the extent of being one of the best in reddit's crypto community. 

To directly comment on the issue discussed, I think it is easy to guide any form of alt price movement back to a potential movement in BTC. i.e. "this alt is performing such-and-such, therefore I think BTC will move in this/that way." (I do believe this is within the guidelines of rule 2, right?) 

I find it hard to read into /u/jarederaj 's situation to say whether or not the current state of moderation is too *heavy-handed*, though as an individual who only sees the outcome I'm am pleased with the recent developments subsequent to the mod team expansion. 

That being said, I don't know what the current system is for banning etc, but a warning combined with a PM would probably be sufficient for first-time offenders to be made aware of them being out of line, and adjust behavior accordingly.

Hi Jared.  Im one of the people you're talking to here.  Im sorry.  As much as I hate to say ETH is leading BTC.  I genuinely thought it was a given at this point and didn't need explaining.  IMO it explains why the BTC chart and price action has been so difficult to predict during this move.  A far more bullish ALT coin cycle is pulling BTC around and making TA difficult if only observing the BTC chart.  I have been trading BTC using the ETH chart, as this is where the more reliable TA and indicators seem to be.  

For example.  The "Bart" formations we have seen over the last couple of days make way more sense when you look at ETH/USD.

I understand that modding this place must be difficult and I do appreciate the hard work all the mods put in to keep this place the best crypto sub here.
I feel like the quality of the sub has actually gone down since you started hall monitoring and micromanaging the sub.  A mod shouldn't lead where the conversations go towards their own personal view of bitcoin, and it does feel that way.  I've never seen a subreddit mod helicopter over their subreddit more than you do.

Also it is spelled basis, not bassis.

If this warrants me a ban, so be it, but these are my views and if they are listened to I think they would improve the sub quite a bit.
One thing is to consider that this sub is collectively looking at BTC markets in time periods ranging from 1min to 1 year.  Sometimes a comment is only useful/interesting for the next 10 minutes or less.  Sometimes it is useful for months.  So, for example, "ETH just pumped 10% in 1 minute" should stand on it's own as a valid and helpful post on the short timeframes.  After a few minutes it is just stating history, so not valuable.

I don't have an answer/solution, I'm just pointing out one reason this is hard for the mods as well as subscribers.  If someone sees something that is time sensitive, useful and relevant to BTC, I'd like it to be here, even if it doesn't include an in-depth explanation.  It may not look like a TA post, but it might have immense value for a short period of time.

This is starting to feel like school :|
+1 to the voices saying we don't need you babysitting and directing conversation here 
It's a trading forum. We often don't care for facts we speculate.

There are definitely others but most I just can't think of off the top of my head. I'd have to dig and go back in history a little.
Let's throw a get-together for this sub. Get shitfaced and such. 
Feels similar when we were trying to break 10k. A few knocks on the door with consolidation in the high 9’s ( 8’s in this case ) with another failed attempt soon to see $8,700 fall, then $8,500  then $8,200 after 
I call fake on this too.
yeah...  no

All they’re doing is hosting nodes out of the box

Kind of how Microsoft announced at the beginning of the EEA
This reads a bit different: "  tech giant's cloud computing arm is partnering with a start\-up called Kaleido "

so some minor affiliated company of Amazon is making some stuff with a unkown startup.
Very cool if they aren't making their own new platform from the ground up.  *cough cough* facebook

Building on existing tech and helping that improve is going to promote the whole space.  Privatized solutions, not so much.
I think the big 1 min candles with a spread of more than 200 usd are definitely created by exchanges.  Take out both longs and shorts
Not this shit again.

I thought we were done with Tether conspiracies?
Yeah right losing faith in this shit market
I agree we'll probably bart back up again soon enough. (couple of hours/days) whether it'll be good or bad depends on where this'll land. 
6 Hours from now.
The reversal at 6k happened to be on the same day as the CTFC/SEC hearing, which was...not negative. So there's that, I guess.  

I used to be much more interested in fundamentals and dismissive of TA, but now I've come around to the idea that news/fundamentals help to drive the market in the direction it already wants to go.
We did in fact leave some fundamental adoption curve behind after 5k going back to 2010/11.  It really shouldnt have gone above 7k max at that point, but we really are in a new paradigm and its going to get even newer with the upcoming changes to the ecosystem over the next few months.

As the fundamental value of bitcoin certainly not warrants 10k or even 5k, careful what you wish for.
Agree. I think fundamentals were left behind with the volume.
People have to remember, traders are the *minority*.

They forget about the silent majority who use BTC as an international payments system - and who couldn't give a single fuck about news/events.

If I'm buying stuff online with BTC do I care about a Korean exchange? Nope.
Rule 3
Idk, I have a feeling we'll get one more attempt within the hour which will be make-or-break.
On the 4 hrs we are still under that line in my chart.
Bears such as the American Black Bear and the Grizzly Bear hibernate in the winter. Their heart rates drop from a normal 55 to only 9!
In Jan 2017 we went from 1100 to 750
In April 2017 we went from 1250 to 880
In June 2017 we went from 2700 to 1750
In Sept 2017 we went from 5000 to 3000

We ended in December at 20k

If 10k is our “April 2017” 1250 and 880 is our “May 2018” 8200, then

20k/880*8k = 181k

Even if 5k is our “May 2018” 10k and we hit the bottom at 6k again (which is basically what happened in Sept 2017), then

20k/5k*10k = 40k

Just food for thought
he can say what he wants.....it doesn't mean anything....none of these price predictions means anything, not from anyone, anywhere anytime

the price is what it is and will be what it will be
Only people that have bought BTC at triple digits or lower back in the day are coming up with these ridiculous price predictions.  No one has ever come out and made a simple prediction of when we will hit $10K.
If I was gonna make a competitor to a pretty well-established leader (CMC), I wouldn't call my product "Honest CMC".

It doesn't come as a surprise at all, if it is true.
By "fake volume" I meant "crypto to crypto volume." Coinmarketcap.com counts all trading volume the same when clearly fiat trading volume should be listed separately.  All I'm showing is that 80% of the trading for BTC is to other cryptos, but for certain coins like Tether 99.96% is crypto to crypto volume.
If you buy into store of value as a use case, then during a non\-hyper bullish market then the number of unique addresses should consolidate.

Additionally, the way ETH is designed regarding smart contracts/DApps/Tokens you'd have to manage the number of unique addresses *should* be significantly higher. 

If you'd asked me before showing me this chart about this value I'd have guessed ETH was already 10x BTC in unique storage addresses.
Tell us why it does.
It does matter. The flippening is nigh. 
what? you mean why Ethereum has so many addresses, i.e the same amount lf addresses as Bitcoin?

Don’t forget that every smart contract has it’s own address (don’t know if those are counted here).

Also, remember that in order to get in an ico or any erc20 shittoken you need to generate an address. It’s pretty obvious that the number of shittoken holders vastly outnumber btc holders. So every investor in a shittoken forcibly needs to generate an Ethereum address/account in order to get their entry in the “balances” mapping struct of the smart contract

Basically, virtually every smart contract runs a subledger using the mapping struct via

mapping(address => unit256)
too many kitties in there.
I have that line drawn and it only wicked and dropped back in... Your line seems a bit random.

NASDAQ  powered* exchange opens next month. Anyone can use the NASDAQ framework for their exchange. Your comment is very misleading.
😂 for anyone interested: 

read this first: http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8jipk9/daily_discussion_tuesday_may_15_2018/dz07qse

news was about 31h ago (May 14th 1:30 AM GMT)

>Cryptocurrency exchanges have become a profitable business lately. Wall Street is slowly warming up to the cryptos and those with an interest in virtual currencies have expressed their desire dive into the exchange business. DX Exchange is a new cryptocurrency exchange that is set to open doors in the coming month. It has the advantage of being powered by the second largest currency exchange in the world, NASDAQ. DX Exchange CEO, Daniel Skowronski said, in a comment to Finance Magnates “The advantage of this cooperation is threefold: the brand name, the technology and the regulations,”



>The exchange has adopted the technology infrastructure by NASDAQ, which is used by over 70 exchanges around the world. The CEO says that the partnering with NASDAQ will require them to comply with regulations, besides, it will ensure that they stay away from common bugs, errors and eliminate fake volumes. The exchange has acquired a license from Estonia in addition to having a market maker license issued by Cypriot regulator, CySEC. The company is working on acquiring a federal license, but in the meantime, US customers will not be allowed on the exchange.


>“We created a one-stop-shop for exchanging fiat and crypto, holding coins and as well as wallet services,” said Skowronski.


>While commenting on the way they intend to coins for listing, the CEO said:


>“We are supporting blockchain technology. And the way we can help this ecosystem to progress is by vetting the tokens and making sure the good ones are promoted. We are not going to list coins, just because they pay us. Those who are worthy – will be listed.”


>The exchange will not impose trading fees on activities on the platform, however, the users will be required to pay a monthly fee of about 10 euros. For KYC, phone number and email will be required “Without undermining the necessary KYC and AML components, required by the regulator,”

 


Source for date of NASDAQ commencement? 

I doubt it'll be that quick.

&nbsp;

Are they outsourcing custodial services?
Edit: As per that reply ^^ , it looks like they're taking care of custody themselves.

Also note: US customers not allowed initially.
Got a source?
Also the opposite can happen, that somebody with a lot of coins is there and starts to think what an overhyped clusterfuck is this ;\)
He's been in BTC since like 2013, you've never seen him before?
I agree that Max is a joke. Classic charlatan in my book. That doesn't mean I think he's wrong about Bitcoin reaching new highs at some point but he's a total hack in my book.

Is it really so clear it's going to the 7k range??

why?
what is this counting on the candles?
Any Coinbase announcement ever has been a buy the rumor sell the news 

Except the BCH debacle, which was fun
I don't think so. That news is old.

Somebody decided this wedge should break down and hit "sell".
It's also BCH hard fork day. Might see big profit taking there.
Don’t pull a chewy here.

Personally Ide wait it out 
If going short here trying to snipe a breakdown, I would let go of it before that.  If it breaks up you could just reshort if it hits the diagonal resistance, which could be 8750~8650.  I don't think the upper resistance of the bear flag channel will be as meaningful as that diagonal resistance, other than that it sidewaysed the price there.
I would say 6K's 
Yall have been saying big money is gonna come in since January...maybe they're tired of waiting or think they can get a better price while big money isn't in yet
Or maybe they are a believer in trading profits (and buying lambos, houses and hookers with them).
Probably, BTC traders have a short term memory so these bart movements can go on forever.
You mean the right half of the giant bear flag?
Held my short 3 days underwater. Closed half at breakeven. The rest has stops @8420. Prefer earn a bit than risk closing @breakeven. There is a lot of support beneath.
Probably will open a long here on a bounce 
That would chew into bitmex's profits \- can't let that happen.
ok hotshot. Not like the Crypto ecosystem is rotten from the core

World gov'ts are ruining crypto, but BTC does seem like an old codger that keeps falling and rotting away and making everything around it look bad.
You and the guy below you have contrarian comments. Oh how I love that no one ever really knows what the fuck BTC is going to do.

Personally, I agree with your assessment for a big move \- but a big move up. This is the bear trap before the real bull run.
Someone beat you to it.

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8jipk9/daily_discussion_tuesday_may_15_2018/dz0iil0/
$1 million per coin?  Oh that sounds awful
Zero. Cryptos might see rallies. They might still go through their cycles, but as long as Bitcoin remains down, the dollar values of others will down as well.

We were in a "coin pickers market" where only the fundamentally sound coins were worth buying. This recent crypto cycle rally is concluded, though, and its back to a sellers market. I also don't find it worth it to put precious btc in alts until >$12k because thats when theres high confidence in another big bull run and it'd be worth the hit on taxes.

As long as Bitcoin is still in its funk, its very rare for an alt to make new highs (in dollar value at least)
Why, exactly, do you suspect this could happen?
0

God damnit. BTC is Crypto. Just because you all don't get it, doesn't mean it's not true. Listen to experts like Dan Boneh, Leslie Lamport and Linus Torvald.

No one with any technical savvy thinks Ethereum stands a chance to fill the void that is a globally decentralized currency
Are you really posting "I told you so?"
I thought this comment was interesting. Almost no top holders believe in crypto in the long run. Really?

"Also, I'm not a permabear. If you ask all of the top holders and traders, almost none of them believe in crypto in the long run. We're here cause crypto has the easiest money due to the highest concentration of dumb money. Nothing else. Once the easy money is gone and the returns fall, we'll leave to other classes."

Sub 8K
Aren't the BGD's extremely unpredictable?
Hmmm, Honestly it seems like a fakeout BGD but idk, it's almost becoming silly now though. 
We spent I think more than 24 hours in $8,700 range. We fell down quite a bit today (which totally makes sense) but things are still holding up pretty well compared to the time before we moved into.

You never know what's coming next, but as said below in one of the posts, identifying the longer trend seems to be very beneficial for a given trader to be successful with their trades.
Chart would be great here

whaaaaa
oh sweet summer child
Consensus isnt about bitcoin, its mostly about scam icos and altcoins  now
so who is delusional about calling bottom here?

You said that at $8600 too...and $9200...and $9600, etc, etc, etc
I'm skeptical of people who repeatedly flaunt the absolute value of their positions or net worth. It's unverifiable and many a people have been caught lying.
Are you adding more? Or longing $4m? As in closing all of your short and longing? Or just closing $4m of your short 



what is a "bull arc"?
Are we looking at the same chart? It's been just yesterday that they were this low.
Bear flag or bear trap. The ~8k in market sells over 3 minutes today is likely going to turn in to 6k-8k market buys tomorrow.
One hell of a knife you’re trying to catch 
Ballsy af. Good luck tho.
The right trade is normally the one thats others haven’t got the balls to do, right? Haha
https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8jiplp/altcoin_discussion_tuesday_may_15_2018/
The significant correction happened twice already to lower 6k area during this bear cycle. You want more then that? 

Also, why does BTC need adoption as an actual currency to raise in value? If anything, it's more like the crypto\-index now than a currency. 
> I don’t want to sound like a bear 

Why not?  Don't apologize for profiting when the price drops.

> Speculation alone will not get us there.

It did last year...well that and manipulation.  But would be more difficult to get to $20K again, considering half the world has banned crypto and the other half will either get there or regulate it into being something very different.

I think it was r/arsonbunny who posted about a set of buy orders equally spaced that seemed to cause the BGD.

Back in April I was reluctant to buy into the wave because it seemed "inorganic". Now it seems clear that organic or not doesn't matter in the slightest, since we're on a wacky roller coaster ride where actual utility is unrelated to price. 

Thoughts?
Tensorcharts.com 

It's quite rad.
Holding underwater bags feels bad, it doesn't feel any better to sell and take a loss and then see the price bounce up to where you could have broke even... seems to happen anytime someone sells.

And then when the price gets low, you pass on it because you don't want to catch the falling knife, and then regret passing up buying the bottom.

The entire thing is a bucket full of regret. And there is no escape. Even if you quit trading bitcoin, in 2 years you'll hear about how it hit 100k each and you'll be like.. fuck me. I could have changed my entire life if I was still in it.
That’s my plan here. I’m under water from making shit trades so I’m gonna ride this one out because I’m sure as soon as I sell it’ll bounce back like it’s done every other time I’ve sold
The last few days were nearly impossible and I used to trade/invest professionally for a bank and a hedge fund. The only other three asset classes with volatility even remotely comparable to Bitcoin's vol: electricity, volatility baskets/indices put together by delta one desks and maybe energy derivatives in emerging markets. Also, on a longer timeline, complex distressed debt workouts, but that's usually more deal oriented and less markets/trading intensive.
yeah...but on the move to be a textbook one.
This was a reaction to the last bart candle absolutely fucking me with slippage (LOL bitmex). My stops were higher, but I lowered them once we dropped below 8.7

I'm staying out of this manipulated clusterfuck until we break out of this range.
No offense man, just joking around :D

Thanks! Good point on the 4h TK cross but if I remember correctly a cross below the cloud is a weak signal. However it is a nice additional argument for the 1D TK cross just above the cloud. And I just noticed that the 1h just did a TK bearish cross above the cloud.

If we do break down of this bear pennant I don't think 8.2k will hold very long, but it's a good target. I'll start closing my short in layers between 8k and 7.7k.

I have a similar line that's already broken. You seem to have left space between the followup wicks. If you connect those for points of contact, your line will have a bit of a steeper incline, and will have been punched through already. Is there a reason you haven't?
Seems like playing this support line and playing the resistance has played out pretty profitable 

I think I’ll just set stops right above $8600 and then re short at the line 
I entered it about 1 minute before I posted, and yes, I placed a market order. 

Edit: also, it's important to note that I just use spot price for reference. I enter my position on Bitmex futures and note the spot price at the time I entered. 
Longs are out of control on finex, and the majority of them are underwater. 

I wouldn't be surprised if a large contributor to the buying pressure is longs adding to their positions 
I'm fine with stops at $8,600, but if you couldn't stomach that significant of loss you'd want to cut it if the market breaks back into the flag. 
That's the best thing with BTC right now, creating our own chart patterns never seen before

Not sure about your neckline placement but you are definitely on to something here
At least it felt “organic” and not the fucking elevator crew / bart. We broke down and formed laddered bear flags (predictable). Now we have random BGD/BRD that are FAR more fishy in my opinion.
Five idiotic statements in two sentences. Impressive.

Nonsense. Risk to reward ratio is too good around 7k to go much below it.
I know, all markets have their "X is manipulating" memes but it was just one way of reasoning. Usually it's just a bad excuse

This actually sounds very plausible 

Right now I'm trying to place a trade I feel I can hold for a couple days and get off the charts... none in sight
But isn't that what we just did from the weekend to here?
Yeah, what's going on? It looks like the Blue screen of death; I wonder if Bill Gates is behind this.
I'm not so sure.

Consensus ends tomorrow, so all the smart money will most likely start selling now.


Well someone out there has a shit ton of coins then to pull this off.

If they buy back in though after a slow sell off, what's their entry point? What's the bottom? Who knows...
that’s why we need exchanges to implement zero-knowledge solvency verifiability

I am big on eth but I can't look at the eth trading sub. It's all moonboys and they can't understand why the price is dropping. I feel sorry for anyone who can't stand objective opinions other than their own. An echo chamber will make for a confusing experience when bear market info can't be spoken.
Uh, then it'll just keep going down... Don't do this to us man!  You've got to help us find the bottom!
I agree, but at some point I consider to go into one of the other currencies, GBP is very attractive if we reach 0.8 GBP per USD again. 
Right, right. Everything is fucked now - I did forget that.
It doesn't tell you the timing though.  Basically, if it goes lower than that, that wherever it settles would be the place to buy.  Would need to look at a closer time frame for a more precise entry.

Still the largest group of individuals that have disposal income (or will in the next few years) ever in history. Just because you are broke dont discount the fact that there are more stem graduates globally then ever before, more accountants more developers etc etc... All of these young people ARE making money. They might not be buying houses just yet but they will start looking at investing. 
I am a millenial and I am neither broke nor living paycheck to paycheck. I also don't just splurge at will.  There are millenials out there who are fiscally conservative, save their money and put money into retirement accounts.
This is so true

I have like 2 friends who aren’t broke as fuck. Maybe 5 who have ~1BTC as their only equity outside a small emergency fund

Everyone around me spends so much fucking money on the dumbest crap. I mean, guys making less than me buying rolex watches and the like. I know damn well if I didnt have Crypto, I wouldnt spend my money on dumb shit.

Would you take Tron?
Yes. The problem isn't that it's moving down, it's that it's being so unpredictable. It's impossible to make a good position right now.
If you're day trading perhaps. As a holder, you wouldn't have made a dime in BTC since last November. This market is deadsville.
The only time that happens is when you hold for a few days and the man had forgotten about you.
You think that's more likely than an exchange doing it to wipe out leveraged trades in either direction?

But that happened around low 9k range as well. Unfortunately, seeing these price actions is probably not an indicator of how close to the bottom we truly are
Interesting theory but I read that whales test degree of resistance by selling rather than buying. This reveals how much bears / underwater longs would sell if whales tried to pump up the price. Ideally, there wouldnt be much volume on the drop. Then whales can pump finally!
Yup, stopped out.

When the internet was young (yes I was around) businesses all thought the money was going to be in Intranets, and that The Internet wouldn't be a big business moneymaker. This is just history repeating itself. Once people realize bitcoin is THE blockchain, they'll change their minds. That will take time.
Too much to respond to on a phone, but I agree--PwC investing in VeChain is not a rubber-stamp for Bitcoin. 

I see it as the tide rising another inch. The success of one crypto strengthens the others in small but cumulative ways.
if you had told the optimists in 2014 that we would be at $8,500 today, what would they have said?
To be fair My. Gox collapsed catastrophically and China banned Bitcoin in 2014 also. Not saying you’re wrong, just bringing proper balance to the conversation. Furthermore, my comment is a rational take on an extreme market so does that even matter?
Bull runs don't usually happen on any single bit of news. A base needs to be built first, and we can't forget the fact that an enormous price collapse occurred earlier this year, after an enormous run-up. If anything, the bull run is here and apparent, it's just cancelling out/preventing further decline back to 3k, imo. Give it another 6 months. As the good news of today actually starts to come to fruition and we see actual price rises, that's when we see a bull run, and if we're lucky, a FOMO-fuelled mega-bull that can't be stopped until outrageous new ATHs are made. 
I don’t honestly see why it would have any effect. Make what you will of alts but one came up with a partnership with PWC a while ago, nothing happened. Shitcoin gets listed on Korean exchange, plus 20%.

I respect the people who post here. What would they learn from consensus that would make them buy?

What would people on cc learn from consensus that would make them buy?

It's wicking, 8.5 is a range, the key is how the price range has become constricted in this range of support.  We need to see how it closes.  In theory anything above 8.4 should see a lot of dip buying.  On smaller time scales price action is 'coiling' and is important for a bullish move up.
No the drop was inevitable everyone as you and others identified...what I'm saying is 8.5 support range should hold based on what else is going on from a technical standpoint.  There's likely not enough sell pressure to take it down sub 8000 since longer time frames are already oversold and selling strength based on volume has been slowing since 11.8k local high in March.
I'm getting sick from this roller coaster. I just want off and to break even.

> Been hearing about it for almost 5 years now.

Along with every other promise about Bitcoin solving some problem or becoming more useful.

Instead, it has become more difficult to buy BTC for most people, over the last five years and less retailers are accepting it.  

This is the main reason I am long-term bearish.  I've been around since 2013 and seen how it is playing out and doesn't look encouraging for hodlers.  However, I never though the price would get anywhere near $20K, so must say that anything is possible in a heavily manipulated market.
That’s my thinking as well. I don’t see us dropping below 6500 again. Too much interest and sideline money waiting to get in, in my opinion. I always keep a small stack of fiat on the side in case of another drop, but barring a huge FUD report, I doubt we will see sub 7K Bitcoin again. 

The problem is that we are currently stuck in this 8000-9000 hell hole. We need some rather bullish news or event to push us over 10k for new FOMO to kick in. I thought things were lining up nicely with Consensus and the price, but the Korean FUD seems to have offset any good sentiment from Consensus. 
If you are trading on Bitmex, then yes. Because their servers will shit the bed. 

Anywhere else though and opening two positions and closing one on the breakout is the same as just opening one on the breakout, but with more fees. 

Although I suppose there's the argument that it allows you to capitalize on the breakout without having to watch the charts all day.
You could... or set stop market/take profit orders above and below the wedge to trigger a position based on the break.
> to open two positions

That only pays off in edge cases like many have already pointed out.

If you have already identified a channel and want to play the breakout the correct play is to actually sell the top of the channel and buy the bottom. For example:

Suppose the channel is $100 spread and your minimum probable breakout is 500$. You would short the $100 top and put a double sized short stop loss at $150. If it holds resistance then you are in position for the breakdown of the channel, if it breaks you get a $50 loss + fees + slippage (lets say a $100 total loss) for a $350 gain, $250 profit.

You can do the opposite on the bottom of the channel. Reverse your short into a long at $0 and setup a long stop loss at -$50, banking the $100 spread to cover your fees and slippage. I would only reverse after some actual support shows, if it knifes through just hold your short and play the bottom breakout.

The difficulty comes from correctly identifying the channel. This strategy can get murdered by fakeouts (like breaking $150 ... $200 ... $412... and crashing back down, before it hits your take profit or you get the chance to setup a break even point. Still, the risk reward is solid and the risk management strategy is very clear and allows for minimal losses on these setups.


My stops are @8600. We are in an ascending channel so the longer it goes, the less probable is to come to my entry value. I rather eat a small loss now and try again from near 8900. 
Someone said we usually tank after Consensus ends
Luckily. Could almost break even now but if i held on this long, might risk a bit more. Even if this goes back up this time i have stops on place and a B plan.

How is your long?
the best trades are always the ones you tell others to make but too scared to pull the trigger on
As I said many times, Chad doesn't make losing trades, Chad waits until they become green. If I was active on whalepool, I'd be the master scuba-diver in there.
I thought that the long term resistance lines tend to weaken the more they are tested. At least that's what I've heard from various sources.
It is tough publishing live trades because of this. Multiple losses seems to feel extra pressure to perform and over trades 
I think lecturing the mighty chew is a bit of an ask. Even for a jesus\_candle
We broke the down tread line he traded off of. This is a classic chewtoy trade of buying the breakout of such line.
obviously, the resistance line

just the breakout of the pennant I guess.
i'm guessing we broke out of the down trend that started from 5/5
No, that was his *previous* move ;)
everyone has those days
Right here right here. But I think his next one's gonna Bart up, goin all in 
As people have been saying today, TA is dead.

Edit /s
> Admittedly much here is based on speculation and partial guessing

I should preface every comment with this
Unfortunately there are no real targets for this model that I'm aware of. If this model applies, we are likely still looking at a markdown and re-distribution phase, followed by a further markdown and accumulation phase. If I understand correctly, the proper way to trade here would be to limit buy on the breakout upwards and limit sell on the breakout downwards (though it may not hurt to hold a short for a bit right now if it's already open from above).

Any thoughts from more knowledgeable traders on this topic?
Back to accumulation most likely. 
The top of low-volume rally seems to be around 8880 (red dotted line on my chart). Now the markdown (crash) is happening
What a farce of guy

This is why its a stupid metric. The number can be diluted almost without limit and bitcoins trajectory of growth can remain the same. 
A&E is the most passive aggressive and fickle formation ever.
I don't know why people here are surprised, I've been bear for months, and vocal about that also.

The bottom is falling out of crypto for now, that's been clear for a while, I don't doubt it will be around for the long term, but as it stands things don't look good at all.
well it got to $8900 thats as close to maximum pain as possible without wasting a ton of money trying to take down $9K
Do you have a rundown on your strategy for minimizing losses and maximizing successes? Is there anything beyond the obvious of setting tight stops above/below supports/resistances?
"As always, my losses were small compared to my recent successful trades."

"As always"... usually when anyone says that, usually the opposite is true.
That's true until they don't have the option to make that decision. 
It's at 7.2kish atm. In about a week it would meet up with the support that's held since November at around 6.8k.
I'll be doing the same.
can there be a support in the range of 7.5k - 7.8k?
Why?
This, I do not think we 6k will hold the price again.
It was a hard fork to increase the Block size limit, and also enable new OP codes.
soft fork? they left 19% of the fullnodes behind. mostly individuals running full nodes left behind.
Huh?
Dude that's just awesome.
Fine, you both get an updoot.

Edit: I'm actually a fan of "upbarts," can we get someone to make either a BGD/BRD or upwards/downwards barts to replace the up/downvotes? 
I didn't downvote but I just reread it because I originally thought you meant the whole leg down was a big fakeout. Not the tiny drop of the pennant.
I'm proud, avoided that one and I haven't been stop hunted since early last march.  Used to plague my trading.
seriously? man bitcoin traders are cringy as fuck

probably a conversation overheard at consensus: "yeah, so first we saw a massive big green dildo that was followed by Bart Simpson, followed by a double-ended sith lightsaber, then side show mel came on the scene...we thought we saw a Batman but the dark knight stayed home that day....anyways to make a long story short, after 2 days of scalping and staying up for 2 days straight, I turned my $3 in Bitcoin into $3.05! 
I'm shorting something else that already broke its 1D bear flag. More %.
idk where people get this from. He's right more than almost anyone else I see. I think people confuse his charts with his position. Him posting a chart saying  "looks bearish" doesn't mean he's short/would short. 

also he trades strong trends. he doesn't try to get the exact top or bottom, he gets the 60-70% in between. 
Verifiably false statement. He's agnostic on cryptos, and conservative in his trading, but he knows his stuff. I believe he has had only two or three BTCUSD positions in the past few months, and they were correct. Don't mistake his bearish musings for bearish positions.
Isn't the Stoch RSI already pretty low compared to the supposed subsequent drop? Seems to be that though there's room for a little more downside the RSI would be arching up relatively soon.
Well yeah I'm basically just asking if he's doing market orders or placing smaller limit orders
Deleted.  My bad didn’t mean to upset ya.  Honestly seemed accurate considering the almost instant price drop to a new daily low.  I’ll rethink those posts in the future.
Interesting, any idea of why someone would sell such large amount at that price? 
Lmao :D Need to put stop limits on flairs :\)
You’re right the weekly does look a bit weak and the daily RSI has been a bit hot. So it could consolidate or retrace a bit. Still bullish on eth in medium timeframe. 
Sorry, this was for BITFINEX, same assumptions and analysis applies.  thought I was on that chart, nothing changes.  I will post an update shortly.
I get what you mean generally, but I am basing my conclusion on price action and indicators -- it's telling me a bottom for this entire formation since January is likely close.  MACD is showing that buying pressure is lowest as it has been since February lows and it is doing so at a key support level.  At minimum, the risk reward is in favor of a move up sooner than later.  PSAR is the true tell in my opinion though.  When it hits bullish, price runs with that bias for months as we have seen as the chart shows.  Price is a magnet to PSAR with BTC historically.  If something doesn't go down it must go up (and vice versa).
OK? Got anything of substance to contribute? Or did you really mean to shitpost.
Yeah that's correct if you look at the pennant, though I'm sticking with the bit more conservative lines to keep fakeout potential at a minimum. 
[deleted]
That's like 8 lightyears away in crypto time.
yea, completely agree with your first and last sentences. Not predicting a BGD, and I also share that day trading is generally a losing game for the average Joe (that's me). That's why I don't day trade. I find this sub to be particularly helpful however for the average Joe in having a general idea of where things stand with BTC, esp when following the select few "pros" in the sub. I think this being an unregulated, relatively young, and completely random "market" means that BGDs and BRDs (aka manipulation) is a given. That being said, a BGD would be great followed by another one after that...
I agree. Makes trading a total nightmare.

Every time we’re chopping and BXG’s start showing up I take that as a signal to take a break from trading now. 

I’m honestly just waiting for a good entry to go all in, rebuy my whole stack, and hold at this point.
I’ve been thinking of just market making the BitMex futures. There’s enough volatility to trade for a good 3-4 hours after a BGD or BRD and make that 0.25% every trade.

Wait for dildo, then wait for the tange to be confirmed. then rapid fire back and forth for an hour, make 3-5% and stop until the next dildo
What happened to chew was actually Mex fault. I got back there lately and I get chopped out. You can't enter a break out cause Mex won't let you do it so in the end you need to guess is this gonna be a break out or not before it happens...
I have some dumb friends , they bought at 18\-20k , sold the bottom and probably will never go back

i have no idea what will make them feel FOMO again , they got burnt pretty badly , maybe if BTC is at 50k 
so we all agree thats the whole point of crypto is to wait for some bigger fool to buy our bags? 
I had a friend invest for the first time this weekend while I was out visiting his family. Said he was intrigued with Bitcoin but never thought to invest because he had no idea how to even buy it. Had him setup with a Coinbase account in minutes. He just didn't know, and it's not like there are commercials for how to do it. 
That's the point. 

Many market participants don't understand the math-proof nature of BTC.
whats up 200%
I disagree, it was the halvening, being 4 years apart, rather than every 3 months.
Any KYC? 
Possibly the one public face in crypto that's not a neckbeard. 
You able to get this working?

Excited as well.
Because it's incredibly risky to short an illiquid asset that's largely controlled by early adopters and people who have spent their time accumulating already. 

Most financially responsible people don't short bubble pops (or bubble assets in general) because they're extremely irrational with lots of large run ups in between downwards movement. 

The ones that do would only do it in a market with regulations
More like $8470-8560 
I expect a bounce at 8200
$8420 - $8592
yeah I'm thinking 8265 or so is a good point where it won't get screwed over by a random wick but will still lock in decent profit
Hey Sloppy, do you think $8,700 - $8,850 range is comparable to $9,700 - $9,900 range given the fact that the latter one was more close to $10,000?
Every time we move to a different thousands mark, seems like we just bounce around inside a 800$ range for what seems like forever until we find ourselves consolidating for a long period of time before the next major move 
Since our half Bart down from $8850, we have made several attempts to push back up but the $8750 keeps getting rejected, as the low $8600 keeps getting rejected as well. 

Going to be a rough night sleep 
Wow, try using some line breaks next time. Or at the very least, commas. You have some good points, but the wall of text is very unpleasant to read.
I wish that was true :\) I called it when saw 680 usd on gdax!
I'm with you now after this latest bart
You spelled $4 wrong.
Accumulate to sell to who? I made a lot shorting btc, but meh ain’t trading this shit for a while.
nah, it'll bounce at $5K back to around $7800 
I heard rent.
I'll unpack the joke for non-native english speakers, the joke is actually a two-parter. It's a snarky answer to a loaded question about a stereotypical moonpurchase, the lambo. first part is when he says "no" you're supposed to think, huh well I guess his staff isn't making as much money as we thought, lolol! Then he says "we rent them" meaning, we're all financially responsible and smart and rich so we rent rather than buy a rapidly depreciating asset

edit: I tend to overthink things. see below:
We rent them is what he said, although it ruins the joke.
i heard rekt, but rent is also funny tho, that guy is a genius when he talks :)

I thought you barely threaded the needle on bringing it back around to bitcoin. That's why you didn't get a ban, but I did remove your comment.

There's a larger discussion around the issue of a market leader being pushed around by a smaller player. I'm hoping to see a developed conversation about that. IMO, it warrants a full thread that people can link back to. You'd be a good candidate to lead that. I hope you make a self post about it.

What's often missing is the full context of a statement. Sometimes a much more broad definition or defense of an idea is required. It can be unreasonable to expect someone to defend statements like that.

However, dubious assertions are often made that have little supporting evidence. Challenging assumptions is what we're here to do in that case. Leaving that stuff out there to get chewed up can cause a lot of conflict.

Will be curious to see what happens as I ease off the mod duties.
I agree, but probably not in the way you want. At school I was taught to base my arguments on facts and evidence. The unsubstantiated ramblings were to be kept for Sunday mornings.

Yep we need some game changing news to hit another bull run in my view. Either regulatory or a large company backing bitcoin 
pffff
Lol, why so bearish? We are so close to it that all it take is one big buyer to push it through.

What about Oracle 1-6?
Except it should be far easier to break 9k than 10k. 
I'm hoping you are right (underwater short) but i have zero belief in the bears now.
Will set my stop loss around 9k and bite the bullet on another terrible trade.
Amazon web services is their most profitable department.  
Never done with it until Bitfinex releases a full audit by a reputable firm.  Which means...never.
It happened before plenty of times. This could very well be an insane fakeout
The fundamental value doesn't matter as much as you may think. In a speculative market, what matters is the risk to reward ratio. The market has shown that 6.5k bitcoin has a good rr ratio. You might not ever see a price below that, barring a black Swan event.
>traders are the *minority*...  silent majority who use BTC as an international payments system 

Source on that assertion?
I have a feeling we will see a massive green candle very soon, but who the f8(k knows?!
yes it is inaccurate if you take longer time\-frame candles.
what about the bull ? does he hibernate as well? thanks bot
40k would be a market cap of 680 billion. I'm surprised how low that actually is comparatively. That's only 60% of Apple. 
I'd caution that those are ~60% retraces and this is only ~80%. Don't think 8200 is our bottom (not for that reason though)
...except stable
Yes. But what about the hype ? or Hope ? or Good news ? I just don't expect a red dildo after this kind of "news". Especially during the consensus.
Yeah so many stupid predictions flying around yet someone will get to say I told you so when he's right out of pure luck.

>10x BTC in unique storage addresses

It probably is. I think this counts the unique UTXO PubKey Scripts in Bitcoin. The vast majority of those are going to be unspendable because those peeps either lost their keys and/or died
For clarity:

1 ETH address = covers all your ERC20 tokens (most of the top 100 cryptos). 

No new generation of addresses beyond contract deployment necessary.






Fuck 
Because small buys like that won't move the market that much. Anyway, we can stay oversold for awhile before moving up. That's the current situation everyone here is trying to figure out, how much bitcoin in the supply is there? People who are buying constantly and holding are taking supply but we don't even know how much there is. Nor will we know when it is empty - we'll just start going up for some reason. And it will look strange at first since demand is constant yet price is going up but that's when it should hit you that the supply is gone.
These are long term trajectory influencing phenomena. Negligible effect in the short term.
Semantics. They are using the brand name and the infrastructure and the technology. What more do you want?
What nationality do you have to be to open an account?  I see them mentioning not being available for US residents.  I've been hoping for an exchange other than the 2 available my home country with low fees.  This sounds great
Official press release is here. 

https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dx-launches-regulated-nasdaq-market-technology-crypto-exchange-300647631.html

I wouldn't go so far as to claim that "NASDQ opens crypto exchange". Highly misleading IMO. 

What's occurred is a company that is launching a crypto exchange that is "partnering with NASDAQ" and is using certain elements of NASDAQ's technologies. 
see the replies
which it most def is
Clusterfuck, maybe. Overhyped, not even close 
Yes, of course. But it's much more probable the other way around in my view.
Yes. I'm very familiar with him from my days of trading CME futures. He's a con and everyone in the commodity industry thinks he's a scammer chasing the quick buck dreams of innocent investors.
I guess he's speaking about the never ending stupid comments like "Bulls rekt" / "Bears rekt" that I personally started to ignore as trading isn't about choosing a side like you pick your personal sport team.. that's super childish and should be always deleted from this sub from my point of view.
Stickied comment. I forgot to mention where. I was in the middle of getting dinner ready.
Exactly.

OK can someone explain to me what BGD means already?

Definitely look into TD.  

I've found TD9 signals on the 4 hour to be very useful in BTC.
[TD Sequential.](http://forextraininggroup.com/introduction-tom-demark-indicators-studies/)
better risk/reward than there's been in a while imo. Shorting now is different than shorting before
Everyone has been touting that *same exact line* since late 2013 at least. Doesn't mean it's not true, but doesn't do anything for the trend.
to be fair, bigger money is coming in.

it’s just waiting for sub 3k
I would wait and see on that long. Unless it’s a scalp. 
Did you run out of margin to add above 8700?

How nice does it feel to close something underwater for profit lol 
I think BTC and the technology is brilliant but the way the whole ecosystem is structured around one coin, one blockchain is a bit ridiculous.  If the day ever comes where alt-coins dominate in use cases yet BTC still has a stranglehold on everything means there's no real progress.

[edit] It's like one guy wants to sell 500 coins (millions) and the whole crypto market cap loses billions.  
Central Banks are probably trying to ruin crypto.
tbh i dont know what the fuck im talking about 110% of the time - and not just crypto. 
No its neither bull nor bear. Its the side trap before the REAL side run. TA makes it clear. Mcdonalds arch into sideways run for 12 years, 5 months, 2 days.
Thanks! That explains the downvotes :\)
>God damnit. BTC is Crypto. Just because you all don't get it, doesn't mean it's not true. 

Get over yourself man. 

...And no, it's not true. The space has become less and less about BTC over the years. Yes, the price of btc affects price of all others, but the crypto markets != the crypto space
He thinks he's the only one who said that we are in a bear market.
I stated the entries for my current position.
Because it is oversold on several rsi and stochrsi frames + prevalent sentinment on tradingview is sell (technical analysis summary). That's usually enough info for me to make decision. I don't believe in too detailed analysis because it doesn't work and is waste of time. Look at 2, max 3 basic indicators and make decision quickly is the way to trade.
Yes.
lololo
Yes and no. To my knowledge (and someone else please chime in if you've seen otherwise), we can slightly predict them, but there are two distinctions to make:

1. There are two types of BGDs. There are "bouncing BGDs," which originate when the market bounces after a massive sell off (like 2/6/18 12:00 UTC or 3/18/18 20:00 UTC) and there are "organic BGDs," which originate out of the blue when BTC is slightly down, flat or slightly up (like 4/12/18 11:00 UTC, 4/15/18 11:00 UTC, 4/20/18 22:00 UTC and 5/3/18 12:00 UTC). The organic BGDs are the ones I'm talking about.

2. Using a few indicators , we can see flashing signs for when a BGD/BRD might appear, but I haven't been able to concretely determine the direction. If I think a BD is likely to appear, I might have a guess on if it could break up or down, but I don't know for sure. It's worth mentioning that I saw signs of a BGD on the morning of [5/10/18](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ic411/daily_discussion_thursday_may_10_2018/dyrd7oa/) and noted them in my post. Less than an hour later, we got a BRD.

Now that the long-winded part is out of the way, here's what I've found. A BD is often preceded by:

1. An imminent test of resistance which has been tested before. I think it's like coiling a spring which releases all of its pent up energy.
2. Bollinger bands which have tightened and been breached, likely more than once, within the past 6-10 hours.
3. A gradual drop in both volume and volatility, which conversely allows MACD, RSI and Stoch RSI to reset. Further, these indices will likely have divergence from the market.

Upon further review, I'm going to check out if BGDs correspond to breaching resistance lines and BRDs correspond to breaching support. That might be the key to determining the BD's direction.
yea seems like a preparation for real a BGD or another BRD

Just to clarify, it's not even necessarily identifying the trend that's important, it's getting in at a position where you can comfortably hold until the trend appears. 

For example, say you shorted $10k

You can now sit back and watch all this nonsense with ease, you just wait until <$7k or $10k again. you either make a lot of money or break even ; either way, you now know the general trend  without having lost much money

Consensus is about blockchain technology. Anything positive about blockchain will benefit BTC because BTC is the first proven case use of blockchain. And how do people buy altcoins? Through bitcoin.
Are you trying to say that people lie about money? On the internet? I never would have known!
Well you can verify with bitmex /position, which MikeXBT did for me. So Mike is legit (as long as you trust me)

I personally was a bit skeptical of Harvey at first but I think he's being honest for whatever reason

Maybe he would /position as well? 
I'll close then go long when I'm ready. Not now though. I have a target in mind.
It's right next to "bullshit" in the trading dictionary.

(but seriously, rounded bottoms are bullish, maybe that's what he meant.  But that is not the case now)
He's trololoing.
still same or similar level, it is the daily, it is not 1 single dot on the chart

takes a few days for it to show, i dont expect to go much lower, maybe $8-8.2k range but has gotta jump soon, no reason for this bearishness to continue much longer


he’s right about the 1d stoch rsi though

because why else would anyone ever buy it? do you really think it can forever exist solely as a speculative trading instrument? Why do we even need miners and blockchain and whatnot if it's just a gambling token?

You don't need any of the extra stuff if that's all it's gonna be 
Good going! I'd have to wait til 2029 :(

No far from it. The fact that it is 'expected' that BTC will make a new ATH makes me so bearish. People just think it's easy money to buy and hold BTC. When everything thinks that, it's usually the opposite. Don't follow the herd.
thats a bad approach to take

the same people who say they'd buy all BTC they can get their hands on at $1K wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole if the price actually got down there 
You don't understand markets. That is always the same argument. Just like when BTC was 15k, people were saying the same thing about it ever dropping below 10k. It's all relative. When it breaks a certain price point, those same people WON'T be buying because they EXPECT a lower price. When it's 1k, you'll be saying "Do you know how many people would go all-in at BTC @ $100"
I’d say if you are ready to take the risk, buy this dip

Its a gamble, but everyhitng is
>  then see the price bounce up to where you could have broke even... seems to happen anytime someone sells.

If that's what you think really happens, then you are trading a different market than I am.  And living in a different reality.

> in 2 years you'll hear about how it hit 100k each 

Unlikely

Anyway it feels worse to lose 50% of your money than it does to lose 5 or 10%.  That's all I was saying.

I hope it doesn't come to this, but if the price drops low enough, it will overpower the cognitive dissonance and denial of many holders and then it will really get ugly.

Textbook flags break up or down just the same.

I mean, yeah, I'm in fiat and biased bearish, just saying waiting for confirmation on flags is a pretty basic TA tenant. You can obviously long the bottom/short the top if you find confluence with other things (or just wanna be risky). But it breaking down certainly isn't a sure thing.

> STRONG SENKOU SPAN CROSS SIGNAL
A strong senkou span cross signal takes place when the price curve is on the side of the kumo that matches the sentiment of the 
senkou span cross.
>

[Taken from here.](http://www.kumotrader.com/ichimoku_wiki/index.php?title=Ichimoku_trading_strategies) So price under Kumo with it crossing to bearish is a strong sell. Now add that to the TK cross with the chikou under Kumo and all your indicators are bearish. But again, we're getting ahead of ourselves. We got a couple more periods to go to confirm.

Because the drop just happened and these wicks may just be puncturing through the previous support line slightly or perhaps forming a new support line just under it.  Won't know for a few hours and I don't place trades until a clear pattern emerges \(like this most recent drop\)

It's also possible the bottom drops out and we continue to move down
Good timing, I’m gonna see if I can short the bounce, but so far it is flatlining after that drop.  
Interesting perspective. This could get very ugly soon if that’s the case. These dumps seem so controlled so far though. Either way, I doubt this can get propped up much longer. Nice entry!
From a TA perspective alone, a flag that breaks with conviction like this one and returns to the flag should invalidate it no? Just trying to learn. 
Yeah good point, made some minor adjustments and added a lower trendline to demonstrate rough lower boundary. Only has two touches so not very strong yet.
Edit: Chart didn't update.

Just how like we were told we'd never see BTC below $15,000....and $12,000 and $10,000 and........ 
The only thing that's safe to bet on at this time is variance. I wouldn't open a position right now that depends on anything else.
Painting a big bear flag on the longer timeframes.
Inspecting the page it hints at it being an "Account Message"/"Account Status", whatever that means.
The smart money already been selling, as the chart shows. If they just started selling now, then they aren't too smart.
I think we make another higher low at 6800-ish throughout May
That'd be beautiful.
Haha yep I noticed this too 
Exactly.

But the market will increasingly become inoculated to this. Quickly.
I know you mean this temporarily regarding the current zone, but as a buyer, I wonder if this will be the comment defining this entire year.

Truth be told, it hasn't exactly permeated in your posting, so I wouldn't worry too much, though for your own trading it might be beneficial to try to remain balanced. 

I, on the other hand, have been shitposting way too much today, which is way more of a nuisance for people I think. (I'm stopping after this post, I promise.)
Yeah seriously, eth trading subs are kind of idiotic. I think both sides of the spectrum are essential to prevent people from getting sucked in with meme-ification of trading/investing. Markets don't always go up, so it's just foul to promise this to people and make them dependent on it. 
I swear to god I sold and it bounced after that mad drop. Luckily I watched it an bought back in I hope it’s over
Very attractive, until they actually *really* go through with Brexit and fully realize what a ridiculous clusterfuck it is. 
You're also supposed to read charts right-to-left now instead of left-to-right. 


Ah thanks! hope it'll provide me with a good entry when I wake up. Though going up from here is also okay with me. 
Still a great trade. Congrats. Would've been cool to see you get an extra 26% basically. 

Enjoy the celebrations 
yes they are making money, but all of that money is going towards paying their school loans and to pay for the high rent. 

and they work like dogs, so when they get done with their day, they like to splurge to reward themselves, so they have the latest iphones, the latest Rolex, they spend $40/day to get take out, and go on as many vacations as they can afford.

Even the higher income millennial splurge like crazy. If you are under 35 and have a networth of more ~$500K...you are much more likely to have $200K of that in a Lambo than a place of your own. 
yes, but they are few and far between

which is why my main stack is sitting out in fiat until the next recession...which we are due for

my thinking is that it'll happen in the next few years as baby boomers start retiring and suddenly the real estate market gets saturated with homes for sale which the millennials will be too broke to buy. 

Then the bubble will pop and will wipe out 50% of the net-worth of all those people for whom their house was their only asset. That in turn will tighten up people's spending, which will in turn trigger layoffs, which will in turn tighten up spending even further...and we end up in a 4-5 year long recession.

I'm in NYC, so I know a ton of super wealthy individuals and you'd be surprised how many of them are getting ready for something big to happen in the next few years. The world economy is teetering right on the edge.
thats why most of my friends are older...they already have their shit together.

don't get me wrong, they enjoy their wealth just as much as the next guy, but there is a difference in dropping a few grand on dinner when you are worth a few mil vs when you aer still living paycheck to paycheck 
You need better friends, my friend
can you bring these friends to Zürich rave please. thx 
Tell me with whom you walk, and I will tell you who you are.
For me crypto also stimulated my frugality. I am not very frugal by any means, but I’d rather “invest” my money then just blow through it without care. Especially since savings accounts currently give literally no return, saving incentive is basically non-existent, and this is something that I have found in crypto. (To be fair, 100% roi in a year was a boon, but still even 3% roi p/a is 50x better then I’d get at the bank). 
like its any better in the rest of the world

the real estate market is shit everywhere for young people and when all your money goes towards paying the huge rents, you aren't buying a home any time soon, no home, might as well stay single and enjoy life, so thinking about the future dosen't really come up
Ew!
Who said anything about a good time? That costs 20 but I shave my hands first.
Get some help you sick bastard!
Hmmm, Verge?
which is why you don't overtrade

sit things out, wait for a big dump, then buy and wait for a dead cat bounce 
If your definition of holder means never selling, then you will never make anything. You should take profits, and there was multiple times this year to do so.
We are talking finex here, finex has been in control of the market for a while. Finex is making a killing, I doubt they are risking that to manipulate the markets for a slight uptick in short term profits when there are more than enough groups out there willing to do it for them. You never know though.
exchanges don't want to wipe you out, they want you to stay solvent and trading for as long as possible. this is literally how they make money.

Point 4 - local low
Honestly the Wyckoff distribution model "is" tracking manipulation. It's modeling big players buying at low prices, marking the price up to induce FOMO, then dumping the price on buyers at the top. Manipulation is present in other trading spheres, just maybe not to the extent it is done here, so I believe the model still applies.
Stuck with EUR gdax...Missing 5 min candles due to no trades is hilarious. Prices just flatline +/- $10, it just doesn't care to replicate the details of the main market. *Sometimes, I feel all alone*
Upbit passed their own internal, self-conducted audit, which isn't surprising.

Not saying that the market effects aren't priced in, but a reversal based on this piece of information seems unlikely.
Yeah, or it goes all transformers on us and morphs into a marge down. 
Fully agree with this strategy.

I already took about 33% of mine on wicks.  Another 33% is allocated for 8200~8400.  Saving the other 33% for 7ks.

To stop out the remaining 66% of the position, 33% of that is at 8650, 33% 8750, 33% at break even at 8850.
uw. the idea is to reduce position size when u r not comfortable with.
It’s easy to count it. It has to close lower than the candle 4 periods before for a bearish count. Regardless, I only use it as a signal, like “hey it’s being 9-13 period straight of down/up a reversal might be in the cards”. 
I figure out why our count was different if you're still curious. You are using normal candles and mine are Heikin-Ashi.
Who's botje?


damn it I could've bought the bottom but failed to pull the trigger. 
Chops getting intense though, you still getting in?
3 more hours of sideways and then hopefully a BGD. That's my theory.
Bro give your doge some extra snacks. He deserves it. 
And if we follow the 2014 path, that puts us where in 3 years?  I’d be fine with that haha.  
In early 2014 we thought that 5k-10k was "imminent" at the end of year (2014), because price was mad in 2013. So if you said to optimists about 8k5 in 2018 they would label you as a bear.
"Sounds conservative"
Bitfinex lost 125k bitcoin late 2016 and China banned bitcoin (for real) in 2017.
I don't really short

its more sell and wait things out in fiat. 

I only really short when there is some bad news out like an exchange getting hacked or another country banning bitcoin 
How is acknowledging reality anti bitcoin? 
So when you think Bitcoin will go down allot you're 'anti bitcoin' ? lol Because Bitcoin can only go up forver right ? 
Not sure how I'm anti bitcoin.  In it's current form, it's pretty awesome to trade.  In the future, I think it will be awesome for mainstream use.
I think a small percentage of people are doing just that.  But for the vast majority, it's being used either to hodl(and prey for mad gains) or trade.

 Thank you my friend! 
Thank you my friend!
I'm with you on that - but think about it the other way.  lets say it goes to ATH and you sell -= then it goes on to 40k two weeks later.  As rough as this correction is, stressing out when to sell (when its up) sucks too!  Who knows when the next ATH will come but i imagine it will be sometime this year
yea this is brutal, hopefully the market just holds these levels.  Sideways for awhile should mean growth eventually...
Ok then explain what they are doing.
I'm long term bearish on btc but long term bullish on the rest of the crypto space. 
I'm hoping for one last chance to accumulate my hold stack, and one more chance for a sub 10k fat margined long.  I think many are, as you said about sideline money.
exactly

And you also get the double maker fee on mex, which sorta makes up for the market stop loss
Could that really be profitable on the long run? Honest question, I don't have a long chart reading experience, but I feel like every time this kind of ranging scenarios opens up, there's so much barting over and below formations that you just risk to get stopped on one side, lose the gains from the other to the point of breaking even with your loss at best, and getting totally in the red at worst. I suppose you could set wider stops but wouldn't that be even more risky..?
More fees, less slippage. In low liquidity markets it can pay off depending on the order book spread.
Yes, but this costs me 0.75% taker fee, while if I open two positions with limit order,  I get 0.25% twice and the market close will only cost me 0.25% after that
I ended up moving my stop down and it just hit 8603 on futures. Took a bit of a loss, but it was opened as a continuation of a short from 8999 (with a bit more margin), so it just ate into the profits a bit. 

Glad to be on the sidelines after the last couple of days, honestly.


But someone else said we move sideways right after Consensus ends...
Could happen anything, the point is to stick to your plan, especially when you spend some time underwater and wait for the opportunity to BE. You don't get many such opportunities and when you get one, not sticking to your ~~plan~~ initial plan is not often the best idea. There you go, you see that?

My long is intact. 
I just need to start longing, it'd be good for me
I think chewy has said that he is a believer that the 4th try is often the go / no-go, which this is.
Don't idolize. Celebrities are fallible, too.
Well I'm telling him the same thing that I would say to a friend, because he makes effort in here to help others. Except if he was my friend I would explain also what was the mistake in my opinion :)
He usually waits for confirmation though.  Premature IMO.
There are 2 ways to draw it. From 9990 as the starting point, we kissed the trendline (the top line in the pic). We are still below. https://prnt.sc/ji3w07
As much as this wants to break down, i cant stop this feeling that it’s going to break up 
Totally agreed. Screw everyone and their michinoku curves and their Mussolini lines your ball and chain formations and all that BS. Crypto is so new that all commodity and financial market TAs don’t hold water. It’s a 50/50 coin flip. Equal chance to go up as we go down. Guess right and you make money, guess wrong and you lose. 
Haha, and it would be completely valid. But especially now when there's really no trend-line or anything from which to deduce any likelihood of direction its basically a head or tails game. The sporadic pumps and little dumps every couple of minutes also don't inspire much confidence nor sense of direction. I can't help but feel that this is some sort of strange accumulation.

It's trajectory of growth is not the same, because it is losing market share and losing growth.
I've been waiting for three month's now for that thing to complete and it teased me so hard last week at 10k. 
That’s been clear for a while?

We had 6 weeks of green bro.
waiting for a big short squeeze so we get there on other people’s money
For me it's really just a matter of following the short and medium term market trends and exiting as close to breakeven as possible when the market moves against my position. 

My goal is generally to profit between 5% and 10% on a given trade and cut losses at 2% to 3% maximum. 

With that approach, I only need to be "successful" about 40% of the time to ultimately be profitable. In general, I'm successful somewhere between 57% and 60% of the time.  

While there's outliers to the upside on my system (I sometimes profit 25%+ on a given trade), there are far fewer outliers to the downside where I've taken more than a 3% loss on a trade.
Dude he posts EVERY single trade. Small losses + big wins is what risk management is...

Why do you criticize him when you have no understanding...I don't get it
I post every single entry and exit in the daily. 

[You can see for yourself](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/80jgzi/daily_discussion_tuesday_february_27_2018/dux0lmg/).

Back at the end of February, I went back through my comment history between August and February and compiled all of my positions. I haven't yet compiled the data since February, but my performance has actually been stronger in March and April than the period between August and February. 
probably, yes
sub $7k would mark a lower low not in line with $6k -> $6.5k. 

$7k is as low as we can go right now (and it's getting higher every day) before our higher lows are lower higher lows (lol) 
I.....I made a nicer one?

I have too, but at the cost of bigger losses since my stops are farther away or i don't set stops.
That actually left my current position underwater because i was afraid of a spike around 8550 so i went without stops. Of course a BGD came after me anyway.
my self-esteem?
he only longs BTC and never shorts \(with lend BTC\). I mean he is still long, but is checking to close his long position. 
fairly sure he's said before that he places limit orders 

Im sure you've noticed he doesn't tend to FOMO in either way. He anticipates the moves rather than follows them with market orders it seems 
When you hold 1000+ coins, you love liquidity. Imagine you longed 2000 coins sub $8k. you sell 500 above $9k.

You wait for the bounce above $8400. it bounces several times...tries to take out $8900 2 times. Fails both times. Comes back down to $8250. You're still in profit but things are beginning to look bearish.

There's a sexy buy wall at $8.2k waiting to be sold into.

You want to lock in the rest of your profits...You're unsure if another whale will sell before you do. so you sell hundreds of coins, say, 1k. Now your position is still huge, (500 coins), but your risk is significantly lower. 

Whales love liquidity 

Ask yourself, why don't you sell in larger profit? Why didn't *YOU* sell at $10k? 

Because you think it'll go higher.. When it doesn't, what do you do? Wait for it to go lower? No you sell and lock in profits. Introduce liquidity issues and whales have to manage their risk much more stringently than we do.
Buy back lower
Especially when they could have sold them at 8900 24 hours earlier...

Either because they downright retarded, or because this is someone or something unloading thousands upon thousands of coins since 20k.
Ah cool! Was just wondering based on the chart. Thanks for your analysis! 
good stuff man, thanks
Going down on low volume means the buy support is crap , this is not bullish at all.
What does a pennant look like? And what does it indicate?

Well, we barted down a little bit yesterday.

I say this is the fakeout, we slowly go up over the next 2-3 hours and 9k goes down like a virgin on prom night
Hate to be that guy, but lightyear is a measure of distance. 
From what I've heard (and seen) the BG/RDs are actually a sign of a maturing market. it's apparently how more conventional assets like gold and silver move
Very well said. Just summed up why I come on here perfectly. 
I think the problem with that would be to anticipate the next big swing, and if it catches your off-guard you might be left in a gnarly position. 
Well it's mainly cause he tried to follow the trend and ended up shorting low and longing high. 
> maybe if BTC is at 50k

I am afraid they might exhibit the same behavior. 
that's why I'm bearish til we go lower and see usage increase. normies got their shit pushed in hard and just wanna get out or fuck with alts (until those burn them too, which 99% will) 
I know a few people who are in that situation too. I talked to 2 guys and they both said once they break even they're leaving the crypto space. 

Unfortunate, but I think they'll remember how badly they got burned for a while. 
Kinda defines all markets
if I had seen my local currency depreciate by 25% over the last three months, and I expected it to continue, and I bought 5 BTC from you right now in an attempt to preserve the wealth that I had worked my entire life to accumulate, would that make me a "Greater fool?"
Found Warren Buffett.
No. Even the last bag holder gets censorship resistant, scarce, highly secure good money, compared to his fiat that he use to hold.
yea buying right now is kinda complicated for regular folks 
He must be a 2k bear
no
nope, it only takes 5 min to make an account and that's it, you may need a VPN if you're in the US tho. 
Works fine (does require Flash.)
Yes
Market may become somewhat flat post-regulation?
Are you calling us all degenerate gamblers
6k-20k *yawn*
For now mine is around 8325. I need to get some sleep (4 am here) so i can't babysit this. Setting alarms @8000 and @8250 to re-evaluate 
Yes. I am a believer in The Triangle^^TM

We bounced off it and are, in my opinion, headed to the lower part of it, around low $7k. Where we will bounce again or dump through.

The rejection from $10k was very swift and very clear. If people wanted to buy $10k bitcoin they had a chance to. Literally just $10 below on Bitfinex...

People buying this up are people who didn't buy on the way up and wanted a chance to get in and think they're getting the dip. Thing is, they won't buy $9k+. And the people who already bought $9k+ surely won't so soon again. They just got hella burned.

Thus why I think we're going  lower but stalling here 

Bulls are all out of whack on their timing. if they had coordinated this thing would be over $10k ;) 

Remember we ranged from $8.6 to $9.9 for a while. Now it's $8.2 to $8.9 
I know sorry dude. I've been awake all night stoned and working and was typin quickly on my phone... Probably did not read too well at all
Amended. Not much better but like I said I've been up a while. Due in work soon, and still a little hungover...
maybe $4,800 is we get some bad news while we are at $6K
There will be plenty of 'greater fools' to sell to once the Wallstreet Boys decide it's time to pamp it above 10k+ and mainstream media start's picking up on it again. Trust me. That's my feeling anyway. They're suppressing the market so that they can still buy in at relatively 'attractive' prices only to dump it on the clowns that enter at 20k+
Some conference bounce this is turning out to be...
And then what?
I'm fairly certain he was joking about the rented lambos Bitmex had parket outside of consensus, with Bitmex t-shirts in them. But maybe it was indeed a clever, multi faceted joke.
I assumed the joke was that they rent them to appear rich 
Not sure lambo would be depreciating though.
He sais a lot of fuck and fucking. I think this is completely unnecessary in his position.
Sounds more than fair to me. Keep up the good work!

Yes! You're right.  I didn't really bring it back around well enough.  Will do better next time.
Taking the critcism about being too "hands on" very seriously. Reflecting on the mod log and easing off mod duties for a while.

I'm pretty sure /u/-Golden is a BitcoinMarkets OG, but he procures his history, thus no history report.
It's way better in here, a couple months ago this place was plagued with shit posts and digressions.
Thanks. Still trying to get better at this. Criticism is welcome.

We know you have Toolbox. Why are you posting this tables?

And anyways, I am in the minority who thinks some moderation is required. But the line between light moderation and over moderation is very tiny. 

Btw, my table will have lots of random other subs I think. 
Can you elaborate as to why you think that's relevant to my specific comment? Seems like a lazy cop-out to just be like "oh this account rarely even posts here" when these accounts are free and I have like ten of them so you essentially get zero information from that pull.

The tactic itself seems telling though imo.
With that one weird candle, I think they tried.
More of a Spliff kinda guy, we don’t have Dutch Masters Honey here :(

I should order some
I'm in France, might take you up on that offer sometime!

Actually there seem to be more people in europe in this sub than any other sub I have frequented in the past (aside from euro focused ones of course)
If i see that nickname i need to think of a chow chow , https://imgur.com/a/dKZ2WfB dunno how it comes, maybe he/she is fluffy to?
😐
I think both bears and bulls are waiting for a clear sign. I am not sure Bulls are living this easier however. Remember many resistances were broken by large market orders not by standard movements. Altough i am in a bad mood (underwater short as well) i will lose all hopes once we clearly break the above resistance. Wick apart, i am not sure we have "clearly" broken the trendline yet.
Bitfinex and Tether can't complete an audit because of following reasons:

1. Tethers were pre-issued as credits to big traders, prior to deposits, as a form of credit. Traders could use them to inflate prices with BGD, make profits, then send in the money.

2. Tethers were issued to traders based on deposits to non-legally affiliated shell companies.

So for example, you send $1 million dollars to "Global Trade Solutions", they credit you 1 million Tethers.

"Global Trade Solutions", isn't Tether or legally affiliated to Tether in any way shape or form.

So if you were trying to perform an audit of Tether Limited, they'd fail right there, even if they did have the money, because it's money laundering.

This is why they were trying to do a 'balance sheet' only audit, only looking at final balances and not tracing how the money came to be, the auditor wanted to verify that the tethers were backed at the time they were issued which was never the case. 
Seems like whatever direction we go, it’s a fakeout 
You are most welcome. Beep boop.
> hype ? or Hope ? or Good news ?

you know the answer to that......buy the hype, sell the news
I mean now.. i'ts much easier to say BTC will be $1 Million at some time in the future than saying we will get over $10K again.
yes, but still the number of token holders vastly outnumbers the BTC holders if you ask me
ha all good brotha
This all rests on the assumption that Bitcoin isn't absurdly overvalued already. Considering how little real world usage / adoption any of this market has, overvalued would be the case 100% IMO.

Of course, this may change with time. But at the moment, nothing of value has been added anywhere in this market to motivate a ramp up. And I doubt we'll see another nonsensical rise like last year now that investors have been slapped into reality, and newcomers are well aware of the risks.

I predict this market is going to perform FAR worse than most have predicted this year.
It sounds like every NASDAQ trader can buy automatically cryptos now and this is not the case.

It is more like, crypto exchanges are lucrative businesses and everybody wants a part of the cake, so they use NASDAQ trying to get market share. 
So much passion
Ah the mod drama. Yeah...
This is completely applicable and is still exactly what I meant. Seems like it takes forever for another break and even then it's usually only 15-20% these days.
You said it's obvious 
[deleted]
it's been explained many times but the term means "Big Green Dildo", referring to April 12th when BTC went from 6900 to 8000 in about an hour.
I'll rephrase, why do you assume we will retest the bottom trend line?
Yeah it's very helpful on the 4H, just look at this leg down every time we hit a 9. 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/wA49xGd1/
At least most of them have shut up with the retail adoption propaganda nonsense.
Its coming in but just not into BTC.
The big $ is coming in to short the market duh 
Seems more reasonable to me. Ima start actually investing for LTH below ~$4.5k probably 

otherwise I guess I'm just a trader 😅
try sub 300

Let's see how this goes. Might give a little more room with the stop @8450. If this gets back inside the flag its best to close and go long. 
Yep. Entered @8420 with 50% stack and doubled up @8580. That set me @8050 with 100% stack.
I shook a bit on the pump to 8880... Set stops @9025 and hoped for the best. (anything like 8600 would have been good, but i prefer this outcome :))

I had several chances to close @8300, 8500 and was either asleep or greedy. Went underwater twice with this trade. Was a really stupid move. 
Think about what would happen to fiat trash around the world if USD collapsed tomorrow. 
Jamie Dimon said that Bitcoin would not succeed because gov'ts would just make it illegal and people here laughed at him, but of course he was right.
most earnest comment I've ever seen you post. Are you trolling most of the time or are you serious 
If you delete your comment you'll stop the bleeding.
I am a Cryptographer, I know what I’m talking about.

Point me to one peer-reviewed cryptography or distributed systems paper that is about anything crypto coin other than Bitcoin and got accepted to EuroCrypt or AsiaCrypt or SODA or PODC any other reputable Crypto or Dist Sys conference

I only know of 1: [The town-crier paper](http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/2980000/2978326/p270-zhang.pdf?ip=178.82.249.7&id=2978326&acc=OA&key=4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E594C525CFFA2AFAF&__acm__=1526442071_9b77f42ccd44709c596c335f1c8064fd)
lol, it does seem that way.

A LOT of us (me included) said this would come crashing down.

Maybe a bit of an illusion of grandeur going on

I imagine making millions of dollars at a Casino will do that to someone

>Because it is oversold on several rsi and stochrsi frames + prevalent sentinment on tradingview is sell

Add this type of explanation to your posts in the future, remember the rules about low effort posts. 
Good write up actually. Alright.
> getting in at a position where you can comfortably hold until the trend appears.

Agreed. Identifying a trend alone with no planned/comfortable entry and exit sucks big time. Been there. 

> You can now sit back and watch all this nonsense with ease

Yes, clear example. This is extremely important, if you follow the trend and calculate your interaction points, it also keeps you away from impulsive behavior, which I think can have disastrous consequences in this market.




Yeah I don't doubt Mike, but good to know he verified with someone who I also *don't* think is a liar.

Pretty skeptical of /u/fuckharvey though based on some of his statements. /u/fuckharvey, can you verify on Bitmex?
Well tbh, he's rightly trolling bulltards, who just recently found bout bullflags and oversold rsi and call it every 5mins. Seriously this sub has became another cryptocurrency sibling full of retarded moonboys. Every second thread is calling a new bullmarket and that 'cryptocurrency has gunnaa booom this year!!!. I cant stand the cringe

Ask yourself: why do we need gold? Gold is a purely speculative asset, yet it still increases in value because it is rare and a foundational asset in the world economy.

However, gold\-mining burns the equivalent of 132 terawatt\-hours... Bitcoin burns 8 terawatt\-hours. Bitcoin also cannot be lost and we know how many are in circulation, and is more secure, which gives it advantages over gold.

Crypto emerged from the Bitcoin ecosystem \-\- everything is pegged to Bitcoin, hence it is the de facto index of the crypto\-market. It's not a "purely speculative" asset because, not only can it replace gold as a store of value, but it also can be used to assess the health of the crypto\-market which is crucial.
[removed]
Despite the fact that there's a steady flow of reports indicating that institutional investors are gearing up to enter the market?  Or are you looking purely at charts?
Heard it all before

Go home u/boglehead288. You're drunk
> If that's what you think really happens, then you are trading a different market than I am

If you have been watching this sub, you'll see when the price pumps, everyone gets ecstatic and goes long. Those people are chasing their tails and will see the situation as I described.

If you check my post history, you'll see I sold most of my holdings on the 8th. And the rest a few days ago when the price pumped. This drop is just getting started and I don't plan to lose anything in it.

> Anyway it feels worse to lose 30% of your money than it does to lose 5 or 10%

Agreed. But with the price cycling by thousands of dollars, the "last chance to get bitcoin at $xxxx" is seldom true. So the same thing can be said about last chance to sell at $xxxx. Assuming of course you didn't buy at peak.
We should have broken down already... bear flags breaks from the upper side down, not for the bottom down. But, that we might be doing just another range/sideways action in the flag is also possible. 


For the quote to accurate it must reference the median guy not the average...
Oh so I remembered wrong, thanks for the link!

I see you already know your way around persian cuisine, nice! And be sure every iranian worth his salt knows where to find good dough, and any other stuff you might fancy, I mean anything, under an hour :D

That stuff is called Tahdig, literally means the bottom of the pot, and you gotta try the crispy ones made with potato and saffron.

Not bad, Faris harf mizanam, if they taught you "mizeram" they are pulling your leg because that verb is used to refer to speaking nonsense!

That is an open invitation to you and anyone here seriously, if you know Iranians you know they don't kid around when it comes to hospitality.
nothing better than koobi-deh dude, damn now I'm hungry
There have been at least 3 flag or pennants during this consolidation phase that have broken down and then broken back into the pattern. 

This doesn't mean that there's not going to be a drop, but it does mean the formation I was following was invalid. 

If the market breaks back into the flag, and stays there for a considerable amount of time, then the pattern is indeed invalid. 

However, I must stress again that an invalidated pattern doesn't mean the market won't ultimately drop. It just means it won't drop in the way you thought it would. 
I absolutely love the fact that this is basically legitimate TA now. I love this market. 
I was never told that. 
Oh I'm definitely not opening a trade right now per my comment... I mostly trade inflection points and capitalize on short term direction
its still smart in my book if they get out before a general price crash 
Brb opening a fat short haha.
it’s not even hard

https://github.com/bbuenz/provisions
No it won't, because the first people to sell/short after this kind of "news" are able to profit from it.  It is basic trading to sell the uncertainty.
Not to encourage you, but, I, for one, enjoy your shitposting.

the tron handjob and "no need to be afraid" had me chortling 
Don't forget to place your positions 2 hours into the past.
It could.  Also note, that since that is on the daily scale, I believe that the most ideal entry point could even be days later, I need to review this stuff.
> but all of that money is going towards paying their school loans

Maybe in the United States, but not necessarily in the developed world. 
Zürich rave? Anything special about it? 
No offense, but I think you're making a major oversimplification based primarily on your own narrow experience in a very specific part of the world.
You're right, what was I thinking.....

^^^Please^^^^help^^^^^me
Unless of course we get a BRD for no bastarding good reason.
I've got to think a lot of the holders sold between $10K and $20K.  Only the most hardcore held from 2011 to now, without selling much or any.
Profit taking was done long ago, for most anyway. This is now either a smart investment in the long term - i.e. it's an establish technology that will continue to increase in demand / value - or it will remain stagnant...in which there are far better investment opportunities.

If most people are in it for quick profit grabs, then BTC stagnation is here to stay.

I gave up on Kraken in July 2017 and gave up on GDAX in Jan 2018
on the EUR side as well.
The bots that never know wich order they really want and switch from one price to another and now they have some issues where the chars and the price on the orderbooks dont match. Please just make it better..
I think if we don’t get a bump when the Koreans wake up and if the day closes red, that is a likely outcome.  I’ll probably go short as we get closer to day close if this happens 
Only problem with doing this is say you have a .3 BTC short open, 33% after taking profits at 8200 and leaving rest of 7k’s is literally nothing. To some people it may be but the profit would be so slim 
Thats good to know...
I think the count should be on normal candles. How about you?

EDIT: He often looks at micro-movements for short-term prediction and price action analysis, although he draws the bigger picture based on larger time frames
I wouldn't have bought that bottom though for a big position, that looked serious when it got below the support line! (maybe start scaling into a long though, which actually I am doing on sept and it caught some wicks earlier today.)
She’s getting Chicken breasts... I pay my debts in advance 
well, they would have been right then ;)
It’s the middle of 2018...
do you currently hold any bitcoin?
That’s not a fair and accurate assessment of this guy. 
The only thing that really keeps stressing me out is that I know there’s no actual bottom floor to what bitcoin can drop to. I can’t get around that, TA works to an extent, but if you watch how bitcoin has been breaking support levels by having a massive sell off, it scares the fuck out of me. 
they are building anonymous chaumian credentials on Lightning, which allows you to prove aspects of your identity in zero knowledge woth verifiable unlinkability

so you can prove you are over 18 or have the right to vote or whatever else, and if you prove it multiple times, the proofs appear to be coming from different people, i.e. two proofs are provably unlinkable to one another

You can add this proof to the Lightning Packets on a simple sub satoshi payment 
Yes I get that, and crypto will probably have more applications in the future.  But will it be the current players or gov't issued currencies?   I'm sure some of the current crop will survive, but not sure in what form.
Your stop loss will incur slippage equivalent to the slippage you would have endured if you were trying to open a market order at the same price point. 

More slippage actually, as you would have the option to decide on the fly when you entered rather than having to cross your fingers that there will be sufficient liquidity to avoid slippage when your stop loss hits. 
This is a good point... in terms of fees it's probably better to go your route
Had 50% stop loss @8569 but felt too short analyzing possible resistance areas. The ideal would be 8580-8590 but to be sure put it above 8600.

Escaped this last run up to 8580 so i'm still in the game, but trusting bears less and less. Considering closing half and converting it into a long  with stops bellow the support. 
With a long of half the value of my actual short position i can control losses much easier and still have a shot if this goes south. 

With this setup as long as ETHUSD stays in sync with BTCUSD i'll lose 1% at most. That is my usual risk value in new trades. 

Going from 5% loss to 1% loss feels like a win :)

longing is scary too tho.

But like you said

If you short X contracts, you can only ever profit X USD (in BTC... which basically tends to infinte BTC as the price goes to 0), while if you long X contracts, your profit knows no bounds
This is the fourth 8900 test?  I have it at 3
it was a joke ;) 
just joning, you good fam
Is this current breakdown even real.

most of the altcoins have no use case or no competing use case. It isn't zero sum. Why should an ERC 20 token be included in the same category as bitcoin? Do you really believe bitcoins utility actually decreases with every ALT fork or ICO shit coin release? That doesn't make any sense, there is no barrier to entry for forking or creating a token.
Now zoom out.

6 weeks doesn't buck the trend...
we had a lot of short squeezes, frankly we are due for bulls to feel some pain 
holy fucking shit haha
Fucking everything is a double edged sword in trading, isn't it.
But muh manipulation!
That whale must be so greedy not selling more above 9k, or even when the price jumped up recently. IMO either they are stupid or to they plan to induce panic to buy back lower. 

Ps: Sexy buy wall lol
Right? That what I'm thinking. The whales must be smart people, why sell such large volume at these prices when they could do so at much higher? If it's in purpose then they plan to crash the price to buy lower. That's the only way it makes sense.

Or someone found an old laptop.
Looks like a triangle and normally it's considered a continuation pattern. It's only a likelihood though, not a given, and just give some levels to watch for a breakdown of the formation or a breakout. 

Threw some lines in the chart on a smaller timeframe to demonstrate.

do you reckon the bch hardfork will cause some fireworks?
underrated comment of the parsec
Would you by chance have a source on that? Because I'm genuinely interested to read about it and a potential reasoning as to why. Would it be big players entering/leaving, with a cascading effect from algorithms? 
But there usually aren’t big swings right after a big candle 

And you can program a bot to just open short positions at the higher end of the observed spectrum 30mins after the candle and then just close lower (even 1 usd lower if need be)

trying it out manually right now
He tried to predict the move to get good entry before it happens.
yea they will buy the peak and sell the bottom
do you see similarities with 2014 bear market? i mean with all those bullish news out there but the price still doesn't go up looks like 2018 is going to be dominated by bears 
lololo, there's billions of normies left who havent put a fraction of a 1000th of a zimbabwean penny in any crypto. the 2017 bubble was not even participated by 0.1% of world population.
Kinda does
where are you from? I thought this shit happens only to Russia lol my local currency lost almost 20% in 3 months too
Thanks!
Awesome thank you. 
That was the issue. Moved to mobile and it started working.
Good to know that mate. But if we somehow manage to jump $9,000, I think their is a greater possibility of changing traders attitudes. But then again, who knows. 
Institutions aren't as short sighted as to start accumulating now.

If they are serious that would have been done long ago at far more attractive prices ie last summer.

What is mentioned in the press and what happens in reality are wildly different.
buy the rumor(something huge might get announced at the conference), sell the news/lack of news
the coneference is just going to be a bunch of ICO shills
theres no money in pamping the corn, everyone's already bought who wants to buy its not a secret anymore.
better to shill some little known ico for a 100x


and then probably back down unless it keeps going and breaks through $10K 
this is far simpler and makes much more sense
could be a self-deprecating angle to it, but he's a pretty cheeky motherfucker 
Audi makes 10,000 Huracans a year.

They depreciate.
That we mods aren't staying ahead on rule 3. It's emotionally exhausting to remove a never ending sea of low effort contributions. You delete one and five more pop up in their place. This is especially true when the price is volatile.

This is what i'm looking at now. Deleted all the smaller patterns as they seem to be only noise. Wicks apart, i also believe we are still inside the downtrend.
But losing faith on seeing 8200 before 9000. Just want to try and cut my losses on this short. Had too many great opportunities but greed stopped me from pulling the trigger.

I think i need to start lowering my stop loss the same way i would do if i was in profit, otherwise i'll end up much deeper underwater
Tether is officially supposed to be backed with fiat in bank accounts...simple as that.  So the money is either there or it is not and an audit could show that.

I don't really care the original source of the funds that "buys" the tethers.  Money laundering covers everything now.  If you hide $20 under your mattress, that is money laundering.

Oh, yeah. Nothing in my post did I say this was the bottom. Like I said, we have no idea how much supply there is so we could easily keep going down to 5k --> 4k --> 3k. Nobody really knows. But then again, maybe this is the bottom. Only time will tell.
I believe this is some kind of test run for the real thing. NASDAQ cannot open a crypto exchange directly until regulatory framework is prepared by the SEC in US. Meanwhile it will not wait to let competition get all the share. 
Yeah truth be told it's been a boring day all around but I found myself reading more in that comment section that I did about the price because well it's just bouncing between 8200 to 8800.

> Eventually we'll see TV personalities talking about BGD

If this happened it would make the stress and losses of being in crypto completely worth it.
Thanks. Now I gotta ask what happened with our bear friend? A bunch of posts got removed/deleted.
[deleted]
If only I had been paying attention to it on the cascading drop!
Yeah I’ve got some fresh fiat from the last 5 months that’s going into BTC sub 5k too
Yeah I guess if if it retraces the dump that makes sense. 
im always serious, this is me
It's fun to watch though haha.
Since you're calling yourself a cryptographer, might as well call you on your bullshit: 

https://crypto.samnews.net/cardano-adas-latest-research-ouroboros-praos-gets-accepted-at-eurocrypt-2018/
>I am a Cryptographer, I know what I’m talking about

And you don't think there are other computer scientists/mathematicians/cryptographers who disagree with you?

Not saying Ethereum will fill the void, in fact I highly doubt it will....but you're not looking around if you can't see the evolution of the crypto space beyond btc. 


> Point me to one peer-reviewed cryptography or distributed systems paper that is about anything crypto coin other than Bitcoin and got accepted to EuroCrypt or AsiaCrypt or SODA or PODC any other reputable Crypto or Dist Sys conference

Are you kidding me? Cardano probably has the most peer-reviewed papers accepted into reputable crypto/computer science conferences than any other project out there. 

https://iohk.io/research/papers/?__hstc=64163184.7a34fcf56d1f21c0a3f7e14a3d38aff7.1521684852208.1526435367822.1526442127804.68&__hssc=64163184.1.1526442127804&__hsfp=1427766052

And the latest paper by IOHK which came out this month was accepted to EuroCrypt.

But hey, they only have guys like Phillip Wadler working on that project. He must not be technically savvy enough for you...


edit: Here are 2 papers accepted to EuroCrypt 2018 alone associated with researchers from IOHK (the blockchain tech company contracted to develop Cardano).

Numbers 58 and 68.

https://eurocrypt.iacr.org/2018/acceptedpapers.html

I wasn't arrogant to say it would definitely come crashing down, but I said the odds were much higher to see $6K (or $3K) than $20K.   People just didn't recognize what a bullshit pump that was to the ATH.

Yes there was some pleb FOMO in there, but it was mostly orchestrated by some big players/exchanges.  Or seemed highly likely at the time.  We may never know the truth for sure.

And of course it could turn here and go back over $10K, but I"m not betting on it...I'm betting against it.
> I saw everyone shouting that the bear market was over 

You may want to adjust your medications, because that has not happened in this sub.

And if you were saying the bear market wasn't over, then you were wrong.  I have said that it's unlikely the bear market is over and I stand behind that.  But I never claimed to know the future with certainty.
Everyone was skeptical. Except for a few permabulls but you'll never be rid of perma-anything. 
Yeah you're a genius! /s
Not mine.  I had my biggest short position of my life right before the drop today.

I have traded poorly this year though, so he may have some of my money from Jan - March.
Around 8k I posted that I added. The others I posted I had added but didn't specify size or price except the 15 and 17k.
u/fuckharvey has been around since late 2016 I believe.

He has been somewhat maniacal about trading, but I can confirm the following:

1. He \(claimed to\) open a long at 880 and was 54 BTC in profit when he closed at 1500\-ish
2. He \(claimed to\) open a 25x 400k long at 2200, as well as an ETH short from somewhere around 0.14 in June and used his ETH short to pay for his underwater long all the way down to 1750. We subsequently bounced to 2900 in a matter of hours.
3. He \(claimed to\) short at 5k right before China FUD, don't know where he closed
4. He \(claimed to\) short 1x in December, so anywhere above 15k and then \(claimed to\) add to it around 15k again in late Jan right before the rektening to 6k

There were a few badly timed shorts in Summer 2017 that I don't remember, but I remember u/YRuAfraid calling im out for being disingenuous because \(something along the lines\) "this guys been shorting all summer and there's no way he's that much in profit".

Based on these 4 AWESOME trades, I would say he's legit. I don't know how anyone in their right mind can go all\-in 25x, but somehow he does... I don't know. I don't have the nerves to trade with that much. I can't even open anything more than a 1x short and I still have to be glued to the charts all day when it's open.

Also, based on our PMs I believe he is legitimate.

Easter Egg: He once posted an image of his trading setup. It looked pretty fuckin sweet. For someone \(me\) who trades exclusively on mobile and never looks at other exchanges and the like, he seemed to be taking his trading very seriously
He's probably gonna say no and say he doesn't need to prove anything to anyone :P

My belief is that much of the bull market into Dec was predicated on this assumption of institutional dollars. It was EXPECTED that institutions would enter the market at some point and the market adjusted for that accordingly. This is what people without market experience fail to understand. The exchanges promoting this institution mantra don't care about price. They care about fees and increasing trading activity. They don't give a shit where the price of BTC goes. 
> you'll see when the price pumps, everyone gets ecstatic and goes long

Not everyone.

> So the same thing can be said about last chance to sell at $xxxx.

Last chance to sell at $19K was likely a few months ago.  And I do mean the LAST chance.
Bruh, it's a flag on the daily. Why should we have already broken down? Even if it *does* break down today, we still have 9 hours for that to happen.
Ill PM you. We’ll organize something for his year!!!
There have already been plenty of "general" price crashes.
release ze FUD
For further information please re-read this comment.
No worries I'll make sure to also look at some other factors before I make a move :) Cheers! 
it’s a huge city rave that takes place every year

it’s the largest open air public rave in europe

u/ask_for_pgp and I are going in august. You should come :D
lets be honest, any market where real estate market isn't going nuts right now is most likely a third world shit hole, so even if they did have disposable income, that would add up to like $20-40 worth 
thats what I'm waiting for. 

Dumping 3-5% is just chop. But if the price dumps 10-15%, then thats a good entry point for a bounce 
Then she could show you her tittiecoin...  also unbelievable that that is a real coin.
I'm using this forever now btw u have no idea how many girls i will use this on 

I get "wtf" all the time 
how much BTC are you comfortable leaving on bitmex? counterparty risk and whatnot
After a $1000 movement it is worth something.  

Thing is, I need to do it this way, otherwise I never close positions.   Because I had targeted 8200~7800 for this short in my mind.  And we may never even reach there.  So I am not thinking of it as saving 33% more for later, but sacrificing 33% now to not end up getting nothing.  

So I always need multiple exit targets.  If I have just one, and we reach it, I either get greedy and don't close it and lose it all.  Or I close it all, we go futher and I regret it and worst of all, I get chopped up trying to reenter.  

I also like keeping a hair of a previous position to help the ca of a new position out if I add.

However, on the cascading bear flags we had last week, I opened and closed a short every pair of those.  Because I was expecting a bounce any moment.  That was nice, closing on the bottom of the beginning of the bear flag and opening at the higher end.
The thing is, that was done to hedge a giant failed long that I ate shit on, so it's for nothing.  It's funny though that in that situation I had no problem opening/closing in full on those shorts.
Yeah good point, was more for a quick scalp. I'm not scaling in just yet because eur is about 50$+ overpriced, so I'm waiting for that to balance out a bit. 
Someone salty downvoted my speculative opinion on a fictional scenario. Goodness. And yeah they would have which is crazy. 
I meant that those very bad news couldn’t stop long term up trend, which means good news likely won’t save bear market.
I went all fiat once we broke below $8600 a week ago. Been sitting things out waiting until either $8000 or $9000 goes down before I make my next move. 
I think wardser owned more btc than most of us. if you believe him, he says he's a millionaire 
I totally agree with him, and I went 100% into an altcoin back at 13k. I'm playing with house money anyways so I felt like I'd gamble on an alt while the bubble pop settled. I won't be convinced that we're out of the bear market until we either flatline and stay sideways for 4-6 weeks somehwere much lower, like 3-5k, or we see 15k again. 
Are you fucking kidding me?
Is speculation not the primary use case right now? 
how long have you been investing in this space?  are you diversified or only bitcoin?  I started about a year ago and went through the two corrections prior to this one.  This one is obviously the worst and longest, but i can't see it going back below 5k at this point after holding through those corrections
Online voting would be an utterly terrible idea for so many reasons.

Proving you're over 18, is another story. Few businesses actually care if you're over 18 or not. The ones that ask for ID are trying to comply with AML's and proving you're over 18 is just kinda a bonus.

Now from a fraud aspect to prove someone is who they say they are, is helpful until you realize they can just call their bank and dispute the charges anyway. Internationally it's *exceedingly* difficult for a business to win the dispute (why the blockchain was created). Domestically it can be done, it's just hard and a pain in the ass.

So the only problems it would solve, are *already* solved by bitcoin itself. The identity crap is unnecessary.
True if you are using market orders to enter the position. But I assume in this case one wants to use limit orders to enter the position beforehand, while the market is calm and spread is tight, in anticipation for the crazy FOMO candle where the spread balloons hugely for a few minutes.

I would never open two opposite market orders simultaneously. Well, actually I would, lol: In arbitrage you do just that in different exchanges.
4th test of the diagonal resistance line I meant. Yes, 3rd 8900 test.
Can't tell with the amount of people blindly copy/pasting his trades.
Fuckin 8400 has balls of steel.

If it fails to break $8400 I’ll probably just close my short for a stress free Tuesday night

And you zoom out a little bit more. You can always find a time period thar supports your narrative.
were you not here for the first four months of the year?
Yep. 
It's possible that it's all of the above. 

Maybe They are annoyed it didn't get past $10k. 

Perhaps they intentionally didn't sell above $9k because they knew 1000 coins would severely hinder a push. So they're like okay, prove yourselves buyers.

And then buyers completely fail to push. So when it gets low enough they say "fuck it, I want cheap coins. I'll sell for profit AND attempt to instigate a dump to accumulate more coins lower"

But most of your criticisms are predicated on the assumption that whales know where the price is going to go, but they don't. They can't tell the future. 

Why didn't he sell at $9600+? Idk. Why didn't you sell/short $19k? ;) 

And yes, sexy buy wall 😂

edit: this is all ignoring the possibility to short huge amounts on bitmex and tank the price on Bitfinex to make massive amounts of money. 
Because they can also short for cash through CME and CBOE?
no clue man. I try to think of the price of BTC as an echochamber, but I am aware it is not
Yeah I realized after posting, but I didn't want to change it as I'm very open about the fact I suck at physics. 
Honestly I mainly just read it on a comment here from someone who seemed relatively knowledgeable and then I checked out shorter time frame charts for gold on tradingview and saw that it seemed pretty true. 

Sorry that's a shit source lol 

I've also read from futures traders like Peter Brandt and Bollinger, etc that day traders largely are unprofitable in the long run due to increasingly sophisticated bots and algos 
Fair enough, but, to say it colloquially, how do you determine how long "bart's hair" is going to be? Just tights stop in either direction outside the range in which you account for?
May be its time to start counseling them if you haven't already started. lol. 
haha you're talking to the 2014 guy my man...I wasn't even around but after reading dailies from 2014, looking at charts from then to now for hours on end, and reading about bubble pops, I'm fairly convinced this is a repeat 
lol what? i live in Russia and my city is like the 5th largest , its a shithole frankly compared to Moscow or SPB and there are a lot of people here who participated in 2017 bullrun so i dunno wtf are you talkin about
sure but who hasn't bought bitcoin that already wanted to...I just feel like if you were inclined to participate in the bubble you would have already 
answer the question and maybe I'll tell you :P

would that make me a greater fool or someone who has found *utility* in this new asset class?
Yup I agree. I will probably close most of my short or maybe half at around there.  if we make a strong push. A push past $9.2k and I'll say there's a very good chance I'm wrong and $9.4 means we're probably going to 5 digits
those prices last summer are only attractive in hindsight, for all you know institutions could have thought the price then was much too high. imo, the reality is that the overwhelming majority of institutional money missed the bull run last year. they won't miss the next one.
which can easily mean $3K which is what you disagreed with.
[deleted]
Could be an interesting experiment.
How so? I thought is was a funny way to point out the irony... which you're doing again right now.

I don't show up to where you work and tell you how to do your job.

Same here, we shall remember this is the wild wild west and there is always something ready to screw us behind the corner. Better play the safest and lose something on the fees than be underwater.

Maybe just some hopium but let's hope TA means something also in these situations.


Gambled on a short, am now I’m profit. 

My juices are flowing 
i think I get it now, he's not saying we will clearly go to 7k, he's saying if we touch the trendline (which is obviously at 7k) then...
that's fair. I find it hard to believe that after 50,000 coins were dumped and we didn't break 8,200 that we will revisit 7,000 soon, but who knows.


Yeah well *I'm* looking at below 5.5k
rude 
You sick bastard. /s

:)
yes, I forgot about Cardano. I am a huge proponent of Cardano.
Find me a paper. Don’t waste my time

I know everything about pretty much any coin in the top 20 and I have researched the code base and I run simnets at home.
also didn’t know that they got accepted to EuroCrypt. Thanks for ponting that out to me
Ok, yes Cardano.

I am a huge fan of Cardano... my bad ;)

Yes, other than Bitcoin or Cardano... there is nothing

My bad, got a little carried away there :) Cardano is the only project outside BTC I truly think has a chance. If you check my post history, I am a proponent of Cardano in this sub
I get it.

I agree the ATH was coordinated. Look at the alt pumps. It was a joke

Doesnt mean it wont happen again though 
I never claimed to short @ 5k. I held my long and added to it after the bottom @ 3k. The rest are approximately correctly except ETH. I shorted that around 0.11 and added more until around 0.93 or so. Then got liquidated on it due the EEF announcement in July.
I'm still skeptical. Most of his trades seem to be called way after the fact and his understanding of markets seems very limited (those comments about liquidity and coin supple made absolutely no sense and he never properly defended them or admitted he was just making it up).

He could easily verify this with Sloppy or another trusted party. Perhaps this is the next thing for /u/justanotherlogin to work into the bot (just kidding, that is probably complicated and not worth your time, although direct Bitmex integration, through the troll box would be quite interesting and helpful).
Lol, or that he just decided to close it for whatever reason. "Sorry, too late! Wish you'd asked a second earlier, I just closed! Gotta go! Taking my model wife out on the yacht!"

Sure thing! Give me some advanced notice and I will plan a kick-ass travel plan for you. Just name your theme :D

>lets be honest, any market where real estate market isn't going nuts right now is most likely a third world shit hole, so even if they did have disposable income, that would add up to like $20-40 worth

penis coin fits right in there too.

I only ever trade with ~5

Any more and I withdraw
lots of people "owned" more btc than most of us. most of them regret selling ;)
yeah I just don't see 3-5k happening, not realistic given the amount of interest in the space imo
Do you really think he was just “acknowledging” something or was he making a purposefully inflammatory comment?  Lol.
I have invested a good bit into alt coins. But I also put a good chunk at the top then got the unholy red dildo. I didn’t set up a stop in time and just hoped for it to bounce back to at least break even. I’m willing to lose a little just to get out. I’ve been lightheaded from staring at this damn screen for the past couple days. No matter what, I’m hodling my alts
Not true. When I call my bank I have to answer a bunch of questions to get access tommy account. Credentials get rid of all that. They are also revokable, so identity theft is a thing of the past since I can completely revoke my identity as soon as a proof appears that I did not generate.

I’m not saying online voting and I am not saying I need to prove that I am over 18, but I don’t like that I have to show my ID to get a beer when Im in the US. Especially when a simple proof should do.

And there are ways to mitigate fraud for Credential based systems. It’s literally the gold standard for identity management in enterprise applications

Rjther way, building a Credential based system on lightning makes a lot of sense. No matter how you contrive the use cases... there are good use cases.

VISA on arrival is one use case I like. If you’ve ever been to Hong Kong, they make you hold onto some shitty piece of paper. I understand it will take governments years to implement, but the use case is sound
Here are the possible scenarios:

1. Place limit buy and limit sell at $8,540. Set market stops at $8,901 and $8,199. Result: 2 limit orders and 1 market order. 

2. Place market order on breakout. Result: 1 market order. 

So I suppose there's the slight advantage that you have the luxury of entering your position with a limit order in the first scenario whereas you don't have the luxury in the second scenario. 
Ahhhh, thanks for clarifying. 
I might consider moving the stop loss to 8600 before bed, and doing 100% there instead of layered.  Actually should probably do that anyway at this point.
yes but this stuff happens in cycles

first longs got fucked, this last month the shorts got fucked, now longs are due for an anal prolapse  again
Thanks man for your insight. There is always a bigger whale though, I expect a BGD any moment now, it seems some big players don't want BTC to go sub 8k. 
Yeah, I'm just keeping in mind the fact of a potential dump after the fork which might trigger some dumpy behaviour in BTC from the bots. We'll know in two hours or so.  
Ah no worries, that makes sense. HFT traders will probably enter the scene in a big way sooner than later and leave us with only the ability to trade in larger trends. I’ll try to check out commodity trading and see a correlation. Thanks for the reply/info! I appreciate it! :)
trying it out rn. I’ll let you know
nah they didnt listen to me when i told them not to sell at 6k and wait for it bounce 

emotions will always take over
As someone who watched the charts every day in 2014 and really screwed with me psychologically, this feels pretty much exactly the same to me.

People credit Gox to 2014, but 4 months later we broke the downtrend. That should've been *it*, a stability period *shoulve* followed, bitcoins *never* had a downtrend for more than 5 months before. But I think the ability to short Bitcoin and maxed out retail interest causes these lulls 

2014-2015 laid the groundwork for the massive 2016-17 bull run. I think the chart still has some cleaning up to do.

We also haven't seen real capitulation or weekly RSI oversold. We're due to spend a year or two under this line:

https://m.imgur.com/raFe4Cx
so we are fucked then
Coming from Vladi if you will?
ya I think he's trolling. I know so many randoms on fb who are into bitcoin. people I'd never thought would get into it 
No it won't but the asset class you are referring to can lose much more then your currency;) I don't think it can be called an asset since assets by definition must produce something 
Man, I always wanted to ask you this question that when will you be closing your short, that was the only short with 5 digits and a great profitable position until recently, it still is. I see you have a great entry, moreover, your profit was higher than now. 

Well lets see, I also think that a push at $9,200 might take us up, and I think we should be able to make it to 5 digits if we able to do the above. 
Not sure why you're being downvoted. You're right. Institutional money is bound and limited by regulations. They need to comply with those before they can go in balls-deep. 
It never goes straight down. Predicting $3K without mentioning the bounce is irresponsible  
Agreed. It just seems lazy at times. I can spend a great deal of time observing and analyzing the market before formulating a comment that I believe is both time and price relevant (though, admittedly, not correct 100% of the time), and get downvoted to hell by people who disagree simply with the direction without a single reply. Meanwhile, people can comment about lambos or share what position they just opened or closed without concern.

To share what I would personally like to see in this community is a discussion of where the price of Bitcoin was, is, and will be in the future based on evidence people believe supports that notion and a lively debate on these assertions. I'm here for the discord, I could care less if your short is underwater or you're hoping for a good entry, much less your doomsday "gut feeling" about a drop.

I'm providing data. You decide the meaning. All this data is available to everyone all the time. Install toolbox.

I see no reason why this data should be censored.
Here's an exchange that directly contradicts your assertions.

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8jipk9/daily_discussion_tuesday_may_15_2018/dz0w7w2/
It tells me about the discourse communities they participate in. It doesn't tell me about them. Since I moderate a discourse community data about related discourse communities is very relevant. Does someone expect x, y, and z because they identify with the way another sub works? Have they been active members of our community? 

Personally, I favor the opinions of users who use this sub over users who do not. My bias is to support regular contributors.

👌
> try to extend backwards the upper boundary of the wedge, you will find 2 nice surprises:

If you draw the line based on 2 points of september and february lows, it connects well with the march 17 7200 low, but puts it at 9700 today which we are well below.  Since the BGD that line seems to keep getting violated, but also loosely followed.  Hard to tell of is validity anymore as resistance/support, but it's a decent line in the sand for bullish/bearish sentiment to me.
5.5k is the bull case

Here are 2 papers accepted to EuroCrypt 2018 alone associated with researchers from IOHK (the blockchain tech company contracted to develop Cardano).

Numbers 58 and 68.

https://eurocrypt.iacr.org/2018/acceptedpapers.html

No problem, thanks for graciously accepting that info.
Oh ok, my bad. This is all off the top of my head. Maybe someone else shorted 5k. I remember someone posted a screenshot of Mex Swaps hitting 5k+ for a few seconds
He called all the above trades before the move happened. I am 100&#37; serious. All those trades were called before
Troll box verification would be awesome for the bot.

I already thought through how you could do it too. As long as there is a parser API for the troll box (or you could kludge one up), you could easily connect reddit usernames to bitmex usernames.

Not sure if people would feel comfortable doing this on a random guy's database. I personally wouldn't care. 

But you could do it. 

- reddit user requests verification to the bot via a command. 

- boy sends a randomly generated, time sensitive (Auth code to the reddit account from the bot via pm

- reddit user then posts the Auth code in troll box. 

username now linked to reddit account

-reddit user does /position in chat, bot records the position. 
Lol but seriously he has been here a while. I know even you had quite a bit of bitcoin. It's not crazy to think he managed to trade up quite a bit if he got in before early 2017. 

That's mainly why I believe him 
Well over 50% probability that it will not, in the next 10 years.
Ok I didn't know you were using proper investing terminology and "general" crashes are 20%.
come thru!!! August 11

PM me if u wanna make plans
eh idk lol I think he's one of the guys that sold high but i could be wrong 
I sold my long term stack at $17,500 I don't regret it one bit 
It’s crazy that you’re being downvoted.  People have been calling for 3k for 3 months and it hasn’t happened.  We only went below 6k for an hour.  Last dump only went to 6300.  Could 3k happen?  Sure.  But why downvote a guy for saying it’s not likely?  
Honestly at this point I don't think it's very likely either. My feeling is we've seen the worst,  but the market is still super cautious. A lot of money is on the sidelines, and not just waiting, but I think a significant amount are still turned off from crypto in general. A shitload of new people came into this space over the last 8 months. It's going to take a lot more time for them to regain confidence, I think. 
I genuinely think he's being genuine. :p


I'm just a buy and holder.  my strategy has been to buy when its below its last ATH.  This market is so unpredictable i feel like thats the only way to play it until it starts an upswing.  good luck to you!   
That bank call won't change because you're calling and that has nothing to do with the blockchain. On their website?

Answer is bullshit answers and just remember them, simple.

The beer thing sucks but it won't ever change cause checking ID is cheaper for the business rather than having some bitcoin based solution.

> VISA on arrival is one use case I like. If you’ve ever been to Hong Kong, they make you hold onto some shitty piece of paper. I understand it will take governments years to implement, but the use case is sound

Ok that sounds like a good use case. The problem is that for those people to accept use would require said governments to recognize legitimacy, which won't ever happen as it competes with their own fiat currencies. In fact, in most cases, crypto is a better solution because public and private keys which keep the coins locked away vs a vault which can be broken into and cash confiscated.
Actually considering how long a channel can be sustained, I'm thinking the "4th" trick is less valid there.  It seems good on wedges though.

Then again, this downward channel could be a descending wedge or expanding channel too, the support line isn't clear.
The buying pressure in 8400 is insane. Finger is over the close button on Kraken 
that is some colorful analysis you have there, think we can agree to disagree
classy as a Patek Calatrava as always
Cool! Looking forward to the results!
I find it rather difficult as well to counsel people (as in those I know in real life). 

But now I think one, or perhaps two are waiting to FOMO in if it hits $6,000.. 
fucked? A bear market is the best thing to happen to us. It's another chance to load up on a low price before its marked up again in the next bull run.
im from NN dunno if you heard of it
i think its a lie we tell ourselves that we are early adopters and shit while in reality we are almost mainstream
lol you're fucking with me right?
I closed that one right after i opened it lmao. I just haven't bothered to close it cause the syntax is confusing. I tried to close it and it bugged out and I haven't fixed it yet  

I left my swaps open from $9650 though. With funding rates i made 10% on it though so it's roughly a 5 digit entry. 

my new futures entry is at $9350 average 
Thanks. I'm trying to be open minded, but I see people use the argument that "institutional money just isn't interested/coming to crypto" and then when the institutions literally say they bringing money into crypto the argument shifts to "well, they've already been in and probably bought at $1K!"
 >  Predicting $3K without mentioning the bounce is irresponsible

You are funny.  That is the most absurd statement I've read on here today, and that says a lot.

So toolbox can be used by non-moderators? Haven't used it before, how do you check user post numbers with it?

FYI, I don't think there's anything wrong with setting the expectation of "Claiming X needs to be backed up."  Which is what you did with the ETH thing.  "Backed up" could be as simple in that case as noting the price movements with down-to-the-minute times and cross-checking against ratios.  But still, requesting people to back up what they are writing isn't exactly a high bar.  +1
And I am telling you that you are objectively wrong in your assumption that that data is relevant. If I have ten accounts and post on all of them, what does that query tell you? 

No offense (well, some offense because wow) but I feel like I'm talking to a wall lmao, how old are you??
since some of these contacts are wicks i do not expect them to be 100% accurate. I assume the line to be more of a range, in that scenario it works somehow.
58 is not IOHK is it? That’s from Ueli Maurer at ETH and peers...

Ah ok... it’s one dude from IOHK... thats deff a Bitcoin paper, not a Cardano paper though
Oh I know for a fact Cardano is legit as fuck ;)

But yeah, deff got a little carried away there
also, there are a bunch of accepted papers for Bitcoin. You pointed out 58 this year, but there are a whole bunch from past years from researchers like

Arthur Gervais
Christian Decker
Ueli Maurer
Benedikt Bünz
Dan Boneh
Neha

as well as the new generation

Karl Wüst
Conrad Buchert
You were pretty close on the rest. It wasn't 880, it was like 905 but yeah, pretty close. I had added at 1k then it dropped back to 950 and made me nervous as can be. xD
Ok but there's still the issue of selection bias, deleted posts and now I have to believe your story as well. 

I can't make a call either way without seeing some hard evidence, but what *I've* seen from the guy has been really weak fundamental analysis. He claims that Bitcoin is going to go to between $100 and $1000 because of edge use cases and nothing more. He doesn't back any of this up with reason or analysis other than saying "regulations". And he made those really nonsensical arguments about liquidity recently and failed to explain or stand behind them.

Personally, I'm highly suspicious of the claims but, again, this is easily verifiable of BitMEX and if /u/fuckharvey backs it up then I'll happily admit I was wrong and apologize.
Yeah it doesn't seem like it would be that hard for a talented dude like /u/justanotherlogin, I'm just hesitant to demand too much of someone who's working on a volunteer basis. 
He's also pretty.. uh.. uninformed on a lot of things, it seems. He's made several outlandish claims that he hasn't backed up. He seems like just another perma-bear troll to me who will say anything to push the narrative that BTC sucks and that he's making a killing off of every move. 

Of course, I could be totally wrong but given how often he brings up his brilliantly times trades of enormous proportion, I need some proof here. 

In my view there's no reason to bring these numbers up (repeatedly) unless you're trying to prove something. And if you're trying to prove something then you should *actually* prove it on Bitmex. Otherwise, there's no reason to brag about unverifiable net-worth and position values. It's just silly dick measuring.

/u/fuckharvey Will you prove it to us on Bitmex?
Ok, but in all honesty:

He originally claimed to have traded up 2 BTC and then at some later point he said he traded up 5 BTC. Not unlikely he bought some along the way, but he always said he started with 2 BTC in Jan 2017, but then at some point it became 5.

Not trying to be a fanboy or anything, but since I remember these things off te top of my head, thought I'd mention them.

u/fuckharvey if you want me to remove anything, just let me know. Don't want to invade into anyone's privacy here. Just thought I'd be in your corner on this one
for BTC thats what crashes are

not until you guys got lulled by this chop 
Mate I have other plans unfortunately around the same time, this year is out of the question. :(
I'm sure you don't, same can't be said for the overwhelming majority of people who have sold. 
His comment was fair. But so was the response.  I mean look at the guys comment history.  He’s still calling for bitcoin to 2k.  Can’t fault somebody for calling him anti-bitcoin.  That’s why I responded to you.  
Same to you, man. There’s so much to gain
 No, you can verify credentials over the phone. They push a cryptographic challenge by flooding the Bitcoin network and you tell them the answer over the phone. Kinda like how OTP work, but push not pull. You can either just use their app or run your own Bitcoin node if you don’t trust theirs.

Website access is easier, works just like Secure Sign In does.

It’s cheaper to run a Bitcoin based solution. The process for checking a proof is super simple and can be done over NFC via cell phones and an app. Proofs are tiny (like 512 bytes tiny) so even Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or RFiD could work

Think night clubs that just have a big RFiD scanner at the door and when you walk in, you just pay cover and prove your identity by walking in and doing an LN tx. Of course this requires you to hold Bitcoin and be on LN, but Microsoft could just abstract all that away from you. All of a sudden clubs and concert don’t need to have people standing there and lines are a thing of the past 

Don’t forget that people pay hefty fines when there are underage people dirnking at their clubs.

It’s really a great use case

I would advise you to read up on Chaum’s constructions from the late 70s/80s and look up Anonymous Credentials Light
Just moved my stops to 8569... 
you leave the calatrava out of this! 
Would you take money from people to invest? some people offered me money so i could manage it lol ( they are really clueless about crypto) 

No I haven't, just googled it and looks quite big. I do have a couple friends from Vladi though. Zdrasti. :)
Nijni Novgorod? Was there in 2012 or 2013, was the city anniversary event or something like that at the same time I was there. Beautiful city.
dude we are talking about this to strangers in an obscure subreddit because partially because most of us don't know people in real life who are anywhere close to our level of adoption. you're early, trust me.
Not at all 
so where are u from ?)
Uh man that's good, first time I saw those gains were really great. Good trade. Cheers mate!
Hover over their username. All will be clear after you install the plugin.
Their post history is relevant to different people in different ways. I'm not telling anyone how to interpret or value that data.

I responded to the substance of their post in a way that contradicts your assumption that I'm responding negatively to people who contribute to diverse subs... unless you think that /r/crytocurrency and /r/BitcoinMarkets are somehow aligned in whatever perspective you are concerned about.
The drama around this small comment has me stunned and confused. Glad I'm not the only person who sees it that way.
It tells me if you contribute to this community, how much, and which communities you are most familiar with. It doesn't tell me if you are switching accounts to obfuscate your post history.

Careful with the ad hominems. We disagree about the relevance of some data. That doesn't mean we have to disparage each other.
I freaked out a bit at 880...
I don't honestly care if you believe me or not. I know where I stand at Bitmex and my position.

Also, the SCOTUS ruling over the New Jersey sportsbook ban crippled crypto's future. It was it's last major market use and online gambling should really be able to push out in the US now, in all facets. NJ is just the first, more will follow.
Will make a post about this to check if people are interested or not. Have little knowledge about the troll box and available info there. 
[deleted]
It's possible. Old dailies showed he used to long, though. Even got burned longing in September I think?

Also his hoarding comment actually was an argument against deflationary currencies- I don't think he ever fleshed it out but after some reading I understood later that he was trying to explain why deflationary currencies don't work
I started with 2 in my account and had added an extra 3 in the first month. I had taken some out because I didn't quite trust Bitmex at first then put it back in when I needed it.

I never put more than 5 coins (sub $1k/btc) into my trading stack at Bitmex though.
very sad :/
> Don’t forget that people pay hefty fines when there are underage people dirnking at their clubs.

Underage people can't get legit ID's anyway. You think they won't just *borrow* someone else's crypto I (since it won't have enough information to really help cashier)?
Why not. But it is quite tricky to be honest and it comes with a very high degree of responsibility. Unless I am fully confident with my understanding & experience of the market; and; my ability to constantly adapt to the changes, I wouldn't take money. Moreover, the KPIs will have to be set and achieved.

But yes on the positive side, in future if I spot a good opportunity with a healthy r/r ratio, then why not! :)
Zdravstvuite hahaaha:)
yea its not small we are actually hosting FIFA 2018 and have some major games happening i think tho the city is so unprepared for it its laughable 
yea , well it has it moments , you only saw the good parts trust me , the city as whole is not that beautiful , i actually get this response quite often , you must have seen like 3 places 
thanks for the kind words tho glad you liked it!

i dunno man , i want to believe it there are actually a lot of people who know about crypto tho most of them don't have any money in it 
I do know lots of people irl who know about it though...they're just not very smart. they're buying alts and hanging out on /r/bitcoin and rcryptocurrency and ethtrader and stuff 

this sub is very different from the majority of crypto discussion places online, that's why I come here 
USA
Thanks, cheers!! 
Don't see anything on the hover popup (might be conflicting extensions I guess), but I did find it through the metrics tab. Thanks though.

For the sake of argument, I left /r/cryptocurrency months ago in favor of /r/bitcoinmarkets because I couldn’t stand the shills, memes, and moonbois. I expect different things from the communities I regularly contribute to (which also includes /r/fantasyfootball and /r/dynastyff by the way). I don’t expect the same level of contributions in /r/neutralpolitics and /r/gonewild, for example. However, I guess I would find it relevant if someone was shilling a coin here when they are a regular contributor to that coin’s subreddit.
Sorry but I have zero respect for someone this bull-headed, how the fuck did you become a mod? You're arguing against an objective fact like it's a reasonable thing to do.

Keep in mind these accounts are still free, your threats are the definition of empty.
> I don't honestly care if you believe me or not. I know where I stand at Bitmex and my position.

Then why do you constantly talk about how big your position and net worth are? You're measuring dicks but don't want to take yours out of your pants. 

What's the big deal verifying? You'd get a ton of cred from this community and make me look like a clown/asshole/clueless idiot. You can verify with a trusted member of the community or two, maybe /u/sloppysynapses and myself, on the trollbox and put everyone's concerns to rest. 


Otherwise, I'm only *more* sure that you're faking it. This is a super easy thing to verify, it would take 2 minutes. If you can't verify then you're almost certainly lying out of your ass and should stop bullshitting day after day on this thread. 

edit: Also, the SCOTUS ruling doesn't say anything about what states are going to do in wake of the ruling. Undoubtedly many states will not legalize sports betting and, again, this is just a perfect example of sweeping statements that you make that don't actually hold water. You're kind of a blowhard, no offense.

> don't forget the times he has told us he is the best trader on this board.

My eyes probably glazed over at this. I don't even take those kind of comments in, let alone track who's saying them but that does sound somewhat familiar. 

>I think he is legit, but I'd bet a pay check he is an asshole too.

Oh he's *clearly* an asshole and makes wild assertions without qualifying them in the slightest. He thinks everything he says is 100% correct, without question.

I don't see why you assume he's legit though. Plenty of people on here are just 100% lying. This would be an easy thing to demonstrate on Bitmex troll box but something makes me think /u/fuckharvey won't satisfy out curiosity. 
I'm talking about his lost coins = permanently worse liquidity comment, which was never fleshed out and, in my view, completely irrational. 

I don't really get the hoarding argument either, for reasons I already expounded on, but I'm more interested in his defense of the lost coins thing. (also, did you see that MikeXBT responded to that thread?)
I agree, this does seem possible.
Just tryna be fully transparent here. As I said... not tryna invade your privacy here, just a couple things I remember
Will meet one day for sure mate, will techno n stuff, life is not that short after all! :)
No, there are mitigating factors to avoid this. The details are a little complex, but the same way you can’t just take someone’s smart card and password and access all their shit at a navy base. There are redundancies. Also, pictures can be encoded, as well as a bunch of other stuff.

Of course if someone gives you access to every piece of their identity (like setting up an identity with your picture... it’s not actually a picture, but something similar), then yes you can dupe the system with high probability, but they are basically giving you their private keys. You can require that the channel must hold some non-trivial amount of BtC and then no one would do that ebcause the imposter could just steal their funds.

Believe me... people smarter than both of us have thought this through

I edited my above comment btw to add a new use case
Would you trade or just HODL? I think trading with other people's money is too risky better or maybe I'm just a shitty trader 
Cheers! :) Owh that sounds nice. 

I have noticed a heightened likelihood of the locals being not so happy about FIFA taking place in their cities/country. What you are saying sounds like the reminiscence of last FIFA by the Brazilians. 


Well, I'm glad I saw NN, it was a 2 weeks business trip in Zavolzhye, which is definitely not a city I liked at all :D so NN was refreshing over the week-end ;)
I do buy alts and hang in other threads you mentioned  but i love to hang here because of people like you 
why do you think bitcoinmarkets attracts so many smart people?
The sources of criticism about how this community is moderated matters to me, even if it doesn't matter to you. I'm unwilling to be censored by you.

I find your criticism unthoughtful and mean spirited.
I'm not using the data in that specific way in this context, but I do use it that way when I see blatant shilling or spamming.

 I'm just trying to make sure I know I'm serving the right community when I make a subjective change in the way I'm moderating.
This is your second warning about rule 1.

Cool off. Your next warning will be a 1 day ban.
I post it *for me* as I've said *multiple* times. Do you know how hard it is to be honest with yourself and keep an honest record/log of positions, analysis, and reasoning?

Forget about lying to other people. That doesn't matter at all in trading. All that matters is lying to yourself. If you lie to yourself you can lose everything very fast. This is to keep me honest with *myself* and to have a record of all of it for the future if I or anyone else wants to know.

> Undoubtedly many states will not legalize sports betting

Unlikely. The state lotteries are actually having revenue *fall*. It's why the top lottery was changed to allow it to reach the billions level, cause too many people quit playing. The reality is the lottery is an inferior product because it has a payout around 0.77/$1 put in. Sports betting is around 0.95/$1 and most casino games are between 0.95 and 0.999/$1. Online (illegal) gambling has been growing for years and crypto made it easier.

Either the states get on board and change to accommodate other forms other than the lottery or they will lose revenue.
Don't see there nothing that validates what position each user has. When someone enters a position does it show there? 
> SloppyCharts: Click the 'Account' button in the top right corner. Then click 'Deposit' and copy the address into your wallet or exchange. Message me if you need any help.
> 

Hahahahahaha and then he asks what does leverage mean later


Yes I did see it btw! It made sense and kind of shut down the argument. I thino Harvey's comments made more sense against a deflationary currency- but it doesn't really work against btc as a store of value. 
100%
But that's significantly more expensive for both the business and customer. The reason state ID is better is because you have to carry it anyway and it has no use cost. That system you describe requires funds held to utilize or its easily borrowed.

On top of that while some night clubs may use an ID scanner, very few business that check ID, use them. They're expensive and it's simply not worth it. 
> I think trading with other people's money is too risky

Yes it is very very risky. I think whether to trade or to HODL can only be decided after taking into consideration the given circumstances.

But yes, HODLing will always be the first and safer option.
No I'm actually  all for it since they basically made the whole city much cleaner , better and more tourist friendly also the quality of the roads has been improved drastically which is a common issue for Russia 
Vladi is great tho it's like Japan out there 
Yea lol Zavolzhye is harsh :) I'm actually surprised so many people like NN , have you been to Saints Petersburg ?Thats the real deal 
Well I don't necessarily think everyone here is a genius or anything but I think it fosters a higher level of discussion.

Mainly cause of things like no memes, a history of being a more "serious" version of r/bitcoin, allowing BCH and BTC supporters alike to post, etc. 

There's a good balance of moderation, too. Too little and it becomes rbitcoin and too much and lots of people leave because it's more like a class than an online discussion forum.

Got it. Thanks again for hearing our feedback! This level of discourse is what keeps me coming back to the community.
>Keep in mind these accounts are still free, your threats are the definition of empty.
> Forget about lying to other people. That doesn't matter at all in trading.

This matters in life. This is unethical behavior. 

>This is to keep me honest with myself and to have a record of all of it for the future if I or anyone else wants to know.

I thought you just said it's for you and nobody else?

Bottom line is that you're making outrageous claims and (surprise, surprise) you can't back it up with anything. This would be incredibly simple to do and there's no good reason not to do it since, clearly, you're happy with sharing the values of your positions anyway. 

Simple to do. Let's see the verification, dude. Otherwise, quit this little charade of yours.

yes, it does, you can write /position XBTUSD and it will spit out your position size and entry. You can do it with any contract they have on there.

----

**/slash Commands**

Slash commands allow you to share your orders, positions, and current, realised, and unrealised PNL with the trollbox.

For example, /orders xbtusd will share all open XBTUSD orders in the trollbox, while /orders shares all open orders of every instrument type.

An argument enclosed in angled brackets (like <symbol>) means it is a required argument, whereas an argument enclosed in standard brackets (like [symbol]) is optional.


**Examples below demonstrate the available commands.**

/orders [symbol] -- Shares open orders

/position <symbol> -- Shares position(s)

/pnl <symbol> -- Shares PNL

/rpnl <symbol> -- Shares realised PNL

/upnl <symbol> -- Shares unrealised PNL

--------

if I shorted 10,000 contracts on XBTU18 (september futures) at $9000 and 10,000 contracts on XBTUSD at $9600 it would go like this:

    MeOnBitmex: /position XBTU18

    bitmex_icon.png XBTU18: -10,000 Cont @ 9000

    MeOnBitmex: /position XBTUSD

    bitmex_icon.png XBTUSD: -10,000 Cont @ 9600

this is the verbatim syntax, I just copied and pasted it. the bitmex_icon.png is a png image of the bitmex icon
Oh yeah, sorry, forgot how this was supposed to work.

SomeoneSays: /position XBTUSD

and the bot responds with

XBTUSD: 10,000 long @ 8200
Yeah and the lost coins claim is still outstanding. It just does not make sense to me that the absolute number of coins has anything to do with long term liquidity. It only makes sense to refer to liquidity in terms of circulating and outstanding supply, lost coins merely shrink the total size of the pie. The market is bound to re-adjust. I think you can say the same thing about hoarders, but it's almost certainly true with lost coins. 

I've never understood that argument against deflationary currencies-- and I myself am a pretty *hardcore leftist* and believe in *keynesian* economics. (can't wait until my harassers get ahold of *this* quote) Still, it seems to not make sense that hoarding would not cause collapse because the hoarders dump if the asset is failing. If anything it would just lead to more volatility, which in and of itself is bad for a reserve currencies, but the point is that Bitcoin needs to travel from $0 to equilibrium organically. Hoarding and selloffs are just part of the path towards that point. Speculators are rewarded by the gains and late adopters are rewarded by stability and liquidity.
Thanks for the advice mate 
That sounds good actually, I mean the locals complained the other way around during last FIFA. I think FIFA is bringing good things with it to your city. Yeah that is what I heard about Vladi, I think it is also quite close from Korea and one of my friend has spent sometime working in Korea so yeah I know some tid bits. :) Good to know you mate. 
That makes sense. Non sequitur, but I can't wait for the day you flip to bullish brotha, gonna throw you a big ole party. One of these days...^I^hope
*munches popcorn* :)
I turned myself into a punching bag today. Glad to hear at least a few people in this sub are happy with it.
If that is the case and i can diferentiate user text and built in text i should be doable.
I know chewy enters spot price and not futures price, but others might prefer using the right pair.

It's a feature that needs some brainstorming to  outline how it should work

We would need a conversion between contracts and stack %. Could be used to open the position and later update the stack % 
Anytime mate! :)
You too;) Yea it's good for the country but of course they do it in order to fill their own pockets and they couldn't care less about the country
Where are you from?
Well, me too, it'd certainly be a lot easier than whatever the hell this is, lol


Ooh yea, nice call. I didn't even think of that...lol

You can always use the bitmex api on testnet to test stuff out. 

But yes, I think the built in text can't be faked because of the bitmex icon, but idk, I'm not sure if you can fake a bitmex icon in the chat. 

I don't know how the icon would be parsed with a bot though (for example maybe their API only gives you text and the text returns icon.png and a user could just enter icon.png XBTUSD blahblahbalhbalh). 

If all else failed, I don't think it'd be hard to write a javascript parser that ensures that the text conforms to the stylesheet for the bot spitting out the position, because it's definitely different. 

The position size and stuff is in a monospace font inside a highlighted rectangle.
Yes, that's true. You could ask the user for what % of their stack (since there is no way for you to verify this anyway) it is. 

You could always just ignore the # of contracts or have some users express their position size in % of stack and others in # of contracts. 

Maybe they could choose to add one or both to the position data

Or like I said you could just ignore contract # and simply use this method as a verification for entries, at least for now.
This is happening in every part of the world I think. In some countries to smaller extents, whilst in others to a larger extent.

I am from the other side of the world. :)
Will try it later, just woke up and only slept 4 hours because i was babysitting my short so available brain power is around 25%...
