This morning's brief bull stampede was a bit confusing, but it still falls within the narrative of a bear flag breakdown on the 6h:

https://imgur.com/a/4PYModj

The pump from $8,250 to $8,450 confirmed support as resistance, and the market retreated back down following that confirmation. 

For the short-term, $7,800 is the first target for a drop here, and the market should bounce off it fairly strongly. Don't be surprised to see another bart situation back up into the $8,000s if that milestone is hit to the downside.
Opened a long at around $8,360. 

I may regret this, but the triangle I've been watching all day broke out to the upside. 

Stops below $8,200. 
I'm making plans to move off Bitmex. Mark price just jumped from -$10 to $100 above spot on that move. 

Combined with the server lag, the counter party risk I avoid with their high leverage options just isn't worth it anymore. 
Elated to see my Consensus post, which I spent over an hour curating, restored. Thanks to /u/jarederaj for the assistance.

/gratitude
Shorting seems like the obvious move so I’m going long. Long 8210 with tight stop at 8090. If 8200 folds, I don’t see 8000 holding. I’m not sure if the volume is there to bring this sub 8K. 

Edit: Took 25% profit at 8350
Edit 2: took another 25% profit at 8330. Will let the rest ride for now 
Eat my shorts!

did ya see what I see did there...
Ugh...I Just realized a slight continuation sideways and a BRD to 6800 will give us the MOAB \(the mother of all BARTS\) on the 1D.  Jesus, this past month is going to have me canning food and putting up youtube videos about the illuminati.  
let me off I feel sick
And this is how you liquidate both sides playing with 50X and above.
Epic iH&S or C&H or A&E confirmation coming?

Falling wedge and declining volume on the daily.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/sjYewhEQ/

Cautiously optimistic.

This week is killing me.
Closed my risky overnight short from $8700 at $8175. Could go lower but i don't want to waste another day and five fingernails babysitting this.
Wow the orderbook on GDAX is insanely thin
I grow several years older each week from this lol
Looking at BTC chart last 6-7 days...this is really not normal. Literally 200-300 moves up and down inbetween sideway grinding. 
I'm seeing with my little eye a [descending triangle](https://imgur.com/GrnxaEe) in the making.

Should remain valid as long as 8100 holds.
All the guys complaining about barts - zoom out to 4h or more and they are mostly gone. You are trading too short timeframes. Serious returns are not made this way.
These barts warrant some changes in behavior.

I quote:
>ToS Update
>BitMEX has a for-profit trading business that, among other things, transacts in products traded on the BitMEX platform.  The trading business primarily trades as a market maker. The trading business is organised to be separate and distinct from the platform business. Specifically, no front office personnel are shared between the trading business and the platform, the trading business operates from a separate physical location, and the trading business does not have access to any platform order flow, execution, customer or other information on terms that are not otherwise available to any other platform user. In addition, unless otherwise set forth in the terms of a specific BitMEX product, the trading business receives access and trading privileges only on the same terms as are available to any other user.
-https://blog.bitmex.com/bitmex-market-making-desk/

All major institutions use trading desks that are technically separated and over the years many firms have been found to cross that 'wall' to find out order book info, especially for illiquid assets.  What happens to trading desks that have got caught breaching this wall? large fines, reputational damage, some job losses. All in all, it is still a tempting move and I would imagine this would be even more temping in crypto where there are no rules for this except them reassuring their users.

There is a reason why the CEO went on national TV saying he only cares about volatility lol

Getting to the point: Everyone is saying how trading recently has been extremely tough and strange relative to other years due to BxD but the solution is to adapt to this or we will lose all our gains.

Some solutions that might seem contradictory:

* Use tight stop losses if you can't stomach losses and want to be right 30% of the time.  With higher volatility comes higher, faster moves against trends

* Use wider stop losses, if you can stomach losses use this in your favor. You won't get barted on and may even have additional limit orders to bounce off the trade

* If you're on mex take advantage of perps/2 different swaps to put two trades at the same time in different directions around a tight range.  Let the profts run, let the loser get closed out. This is similar to what some momentum algos do. While in most cases it is ridiculous to have to open positions that are contradictory it makes sense on Mex for two reasons: if its a limit order you will be paid to take it on and if there's an overload then you wouldn't normally be able to get your 'reverse' order in till its too late so setting them up in advance is more helpful.

Good luck to all.
watching the gdax orderbook is the best way to give yourself a headache and eye damage. My god spoofies are going wild today. 
Bart gonna Bart
ETH ratio looking like its building up a head of steam, this is usually a precursor lately to the market moving up in general
“Consensus”
Whoever came up with this Bart meme is a god damn genius.
Maybe it's just barts all the way down. 
Huh??? What the actual fuck is going on Bitcoin?
What a shit show.   I have had a short held since 9400s.  Have opened and re-shut a few times to pick up a few $$.  This morning I bought in the 8270 range and we dipped immediately.  Set a sell for a small profit, it hit and boom a small shoot up.  This has made no sense for days.  At least its entertaining.  Good luck everyone.  
wow the sentiment in this sub flips so fast. it amazes me every time. BTC goes down $1K = goblin town, goes up $1K = test ATH
With the announcement of big United States firms like Goldman Sachs soon to enter the crypto markets, it seems to have made prices more volatile in the past few weeks. At the time of BTC @$20,000, people were speculating that Bitcoin could one day trade at 100k. My question... Will the entrance of these big players cause the price of BTC to be more likely or less likely to hit those high estimates for the BTC price? 

(My predictions: $8500 will show strong resistance today)
Bitcoin is in full YOLO mode.
I've been muttering this a lot under my breath as I glance at the charts over the past few months..."the market is trash." What the heck is going on right now? Everyone pressing all-in market buy and then market sell? Bitfinex especially...so bipolar. Between this and the Barts, it's virtually un-tradable.
That's 4 pump attempts in the past day and they've barted faster and faster, but the lows keep getting printed higher.

Think this is gonna continue being chop city, with this falling* wedge that's forming maybe have us touch 8k before coming back to retest ~8.4.

Short from 8300, looking for us to break down out of the small triangle we're in to retest 8.1 and then potentially the support of the wedge. I'll be closing at the sign of strong support of 8100. Stops at 8425

https://www.tradingview.com/x/Mg9oN85W/
With all the buildup then subsequent pops in volume, you'd think we'd be at 8.6k+ by now.  But we're still staunchly under key resistance levels and wicking fiercely whenever a local resistance level is 'breached'.  Too many eager sellers as we inch closer to significant resistance - 8.5k is still the key level and needs to be taken down with strength as it is approached; it won't go down by moseying and easing into it - a BGD is needed and that will not happen until selling pressure abates on daily MACD.  I will add long when the daily MACD bottoms out, still too much selling pressure.  I don't trust any 'pop' not one day before then.
Increase of bots on spot markets is surprising. I knew that big players will come on this market with their hf bots and make a mess, but what we're seeing right now is brutal milking of small day traders. You can't win against bots when market undecided... 

Trading is getting harder and harder with all those bots around, so better stick to trading higher timeframes. And remember, don't trade with more than 30&#37; of your holdings.
we are discussing 5k now and like a week ago we we discussing ATHs and tomorrow if price barts up to 9k we will be discussing moon again god i love this thread
thats some nice price suppression algo action there. fuck this shit im out 
Decided not to be greedy and closed my short. 
!short btcusd close 8160
Question that I’ve been wondering:


Does mainstream adoption = no more epic 2017-esque bull runs?



I’m fine with that and I feel like it probably does mean that but I just wanna hear thoughts on it and opinions. 



Also I don’t think mainstream adoption will come for another few years anyways, so this is far future. 
Hey guys, just noticed something really odd.

The bitcoin charts seem to have spiked at the same time as OIL.

I noticed this yesterday too, as OIL was dumping so was bitcoin. 
I set rather aggressive stops last night, half of which triggered on the first little leg up, and the rest hit an hour ago. Overall my average exit was around 8300.

!short XBTUSD close 8300

I'm seeing a pile of potential resistance immediately overhead that we're running into, so I reopened short right here for a portion of the stack. Stops are tight.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/DD0dglvQ/

!short XBTUSD 8400 10X 25% 
Current markets conditions reminds me of Benny Hill , the music especially , it's quite fun watching this shit show while listing to that song 
These bulls are awful.
Monstrous support o Bitfinex at 8200-7900 looking at the orderbook, will have to take several whales selling  through that 4k BTC buy walls. 
Could it be that these up and down moves are done just to increase the volume on the exchanges and the amount of collected fees? 
This is getting too predictable.

!short XBTUSD close 8240

!short XBTUSD 8412 10X 40%

Stops up +/- 1%.

Anyone else think Barts are to clear liquidations at certain price levels?
If anyone installed the Pushed app to get notifications on your mobile from the **Position Bot** don't stress. [/u/\_chewtoy\_](/u/\_chewtoy\_) is not crazy and jumping positions, he's just updating his last positions on the database :)

Carry on with chart watching as usual.
Hypothetically, if you thought the price was going to go up in the medium-long term, and you wanted to accumulate coins, wouldn't right here be a pretty good place to do it? Plenty of sell pressure to reduce slippage, etc

edit: if we make it to around $12,000, (that's a BIG if), the accumulation here will make sense, but only in retrospect in the same way the accumulation at $6,XXX only made sense once we got past $9,000 and started to approach $10,000 
What do you guys think about the price action vs the .com bubble?

I’m closing long for a modest steak dinner . Screw this right now. I think not having a position is the best position right now:. 
I'm getting out of this. I can't deal any longer. 

!short XBTUSD close 8350

Probably premature, but I can't watch it anymore. I'll re-evaluate tomorrow. 
Anyone else ever have a position suddenly liquidated on Kraken despite a high margin level? (i.e. 500%+)

this is going to bart up i think this time. I have nothing to base that off of but 8200 is holding pretty damn well. Reminds me a lot of 6500 
soooo.... This is (as always) a critical moment for Botcoin (yes, you read that right)... maybe Bartcoin is more suitable today.

I have this unreal certainty that we will see a HUGE Bart up very soon. Feels a lot like 6500 and we all know how that ended. 8200 doesn’t wanna fall for long.

But on the other hand, I’m still out of a position, with no ability to pull the trigger.

Anyone long? If so, targets? I think 9k+ is in the cards for today

Also: Where is Dushman??? Did he get rekt?
Just some food for thought for fun: 

We have an **ascending triangle** inside a **descending triangle** on the 30 minute

Another Bart up. Honestly this is so fucking retarded.

For the more veteran folks? Did the market ever behave like this? (Before 2017)
Point of order - people are saying things like "I reckon it's gonna Bart up". Well a "Bart" is formed from two moves, and up and a down (or vice versa for an inverse Bart).

If you think a large move is going to come then that is called a BGD/BRD, unless your prediction completes a Bart formation, in which case you can say it's going to Bart.

Thanks all.
Anyone else think we're just going to consolidate/chop for the rest of the year? 
The amount of people in here saying we're going to the moon while we go sideways for 12 hours has me wary. Feels like $9500+ 😞

Also, we've been in this $8k-$9990 range for about 35 days now. We have spent an extraordinary amount of time here, especially when you include other times we were here. I'm sick of this range 🤮
Ah, the classical inverted bart.
I feel bad for people that may have had trailing stops that just got filled. This is shaping up to be a real shit-show of a day. I'm currently in cash targeting a drop to 7950 for a limit buy which is just above the .382 fib at ~7800.

This looks like a suckers rally/bart to reset the RSI before another move downward.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/5Peddjnn/
u/DamonAndTheSea

Do you think this could play out just like I said yesterday?

Squeeze up to 8900, maybe even 9k+, longs pile on and then drop us like a bad habit to sub 8k
I'm staying out for a while I think. I've got fucked over too many times and it looks like nobody can call an uptrend or downtrend. I'm expecting more downside and might accumulate at a lower point and long term I expect BTC to increase in value but short term I can't trade this and don't want to lose sleep thinking what's going to happen overnight.
Scaling into a short: Short from $8,337 and will add every time we bounce off the top of the Newley formed descending triangle. 
Feels way too similar to the 9250-9400 consolidation phase we had last Wed/Thursday. Similarly, it’s a week apart as well. 

Pure dick tease tests both ways, to only consolidate until the end of a triangle ( descending ) in this case Vs the ( ascending) last Wednesday that broke down. 

I think we are just gonna bounce around in this range for another day or 2 before we meet a point of “ It has to shoot in some direction”.  Considering last weeks ascending triangle broke **down** , I cant help to think this descending triangle will break **up**

** Last Weeks** 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/bx4Yexnq/

**This Weeks** 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/vx8SEyCp/

I’m itching to **open a long** here and ~~I’m not sure why.~~ I’m going to wait it out for a little to see how this descending triangle plays out.

Anyone else think once it comes to *crunch time* it going to explode up? 

Jesus Christ, it's like watching a bottle of champagne that's been repeatably shaken for hours. This shit is going to blow up. 
holding a short from $8250. Not sure where to place a stop
The daily close above 8300 inspires a new confidence in my bullish stance. Also, ETH seems to be leading the pumps these days, and that pin bar on daily is looking very promising for BGD pump next.
Well shit.. I guess I can’t find a reason to be short term bullish anymore. I’ve been hopeful on every one of those run ups since the ATH, even when my common sense would tell that they likely won’t change the trend. 

I think [this ](https://twitter.com/peterlbrandt/status/993461137847959552?s=21) is a likely scenario for now, likely with a bounce somewhere in the 6’s and unless it breaks up, probably at least one another capitulation bottom. 

I have to face the facts, 5 months after 20k the price can’t even get past 10k. That’s a very violent trend however you look at it. It obviously won’t last forever, but neither did the the log downward trend line and that one seems to have been replaced with a less steep but still very much downward trend. 

Also I don’t like the way the market overreacts to rumours of FUD. Or to any mention of gox coins being moved. I’ve rage-unsubscribed from the majority of crypto twitter and my life feels a lot better now, highly recommend. 

I’ll be buying market buying dips with the money I make elsewhere. So far it’s been very easy to get good entries at the bottom of each big dump. Yet undecided on whether I should come to dark side and short the bugger. 

Good luck y’all! 

P.S. for the bulls: it’s my first bearish post so the price should spike up pretty soon ;)




latest dump completed a perfect Bart formation 
Closed my short at $8,390 for a small gain. 

Buying pressure is relentless. 
WTF is going on with the action. Double bart, inverse bart, half bart, big bart, tight bart. I can't fucking trade this shit. Getting stopped out like this all the time. Is this fucking bitcoin price action or is it the fucking lottery on a blockchain!??!

1 hour later: Here we go again?!?!
As I’ve said on a few occasions over the past month, we’re probably going to visit the long term linear support line. It seems that people are catching up to that reality now. Any other bouncy movement prior to that happening is just a distraction. Currently that line sits around 7300-7500, but could spike lower briefly.
Just for fun, went through the agenda and listed the big financial players who were sponsors, panelists, and speakers at Consensus 2018. These were all firms I recognized immediately, and I most likely missed a few. If you think Consensus 2018 won't make a few waves in the coming months, I believe you are drastically wrong. 


Federal Reserve, Deloitte (Consulting and Tax), U.S. House of Reps Representative, Silicon Valley Bank, Athena Capital, Blockchain Capital, Airfoil Capital, U.S. CFTC Representative, Grayscale Investments, Representative from the World Economic Forum, SEC Representative, Tetras Capital, Park Capital, HCM Capital, Multicoin Capital, JM3 Capital, Fortress Investments, Credit Suisse, Union Square Ventures.

June futures is now trading a minus... I think opening a long here definitely has a good risk reward at least for the short term. 
!short BTCUSD 8360 100% x3

Opening a new short here after we bounced off the daily BBands and leaving the postition open with a stop loss at 8700 and alerts at 8600 just incase. No target yet but if this goes under 8K then the low 7Ks or 6Ks may be a good target (excluding nounces /noice). **Now leaving the PC to enjoy the sun, good luck on your trades!**
!short XBTUSD 8194 44X 25%

Reason: i expect us to test 7.800

I've calculated my leverage to have the liquidation above 8300, in case this barts again. No stops, i will ride this position until liquidation or failure to break 7800.
I'm usually bearish but I cut my short and went long. Potential descending wedge we will break out of, divergence on 4hr etc. I think we are due for a small bounce to punish those that shorted once 8200 broke. 

Only thing that I see can bring us down would be a "sell the news" moment at the end of consensus 
If we can’t get over 8400 and keep it held my tendies are going everywhere. Come on damnit
[deleted]
Shall i take profit now between 8100 and 8200? And put another short below 8100? Or shall I just keep rallying? What do you think guys. I believe we go further down. But maybe we will get a bounce here. 

Edit: Thanks for help guys! I took 50% profit and have set next short at 8095. If we bounce I will use it to short higher.
Is it a bear pennant we are painting now? I see the RSI is not oversold on long time frames; could we see a further drop today, and if so, how far? What indicators are useful to predict the local bottom - Fibonacci? 
Stop losses have become a liability more than utility lately. Every price action is intensified due to tight stop losses. Positions must be nursed manually, this is so taxing on day to day life, but profitable. Works like a clock. At my time zone dips every morning lowest lows around noon picking up around evening highest high at night. Rinse and repeat. 
Just logged in to put stop limit for my short at 8500 to see the market price 8200 lol :\)
Exactly at the moment of a super boring eth alliance "announcement".  those market dums after news in crypto are so lol and predictable
Ah Bitcoin, you delicious chaotic bastard.
anyone planning to long if we touch the bottom of this pennant?

https://imgur.com/a/xyVB3Qf
I took my 50% profit from my 8200 long I sold at 8350 and added more at 8250. Still keeping the SL tight at 8090. Chew said who’s right, the sellers or buyers now? I’m on the buyers side
How much weight does this bull divergence on the 4hr carry? And does this qualify as a descending wedge? https://imgur.com/a/F05V85C
I fully expect to wake up tomorrow with my 8.5 long glowing bright green, but won't care much if it's not. Pretty confident that this trade will turn out like my long last Friday: went south for a couple days but closed at a free lunch. 
As I thought, the daily MACD has not yet reached bottom and the price and selling pressure is still heavy until it bottoms out.  About a week out before it bottoms on the daily which is the time that the weekly should be making it's own crossover. I think I may be a week too early on my bullish predictions.  Guess I will set some buys at 7.8k, max pain should get it there if my assumptions about MACD daily continue to prove correct.
I'm getting itchy here. I have been short from 8415 for almost a day now. I was expecting 8200 to break down this time. My stop is at 9401 now for break even. I can't imagine another strong pump from here but obviously someone is buying.
Got stopped out by that and it looks to be a blow out top. See if I ever set stops again.
These wicks are beyond insane, they are actually quite annoying and over exaggerated. We broke through the ascending triangle just to get rejected back down and test its support ( we bounced off it perfectly ).

https://www.tradingview.com/x/cLH1K1fU/

Candles are coming down to the end of the triangle, so I added more too my long after taking 50% profit at 8480, added the 50% i sold and re bought at 8330. 
Have you ever witnessed a trader/investor delve deep into crypto, only to later decide to exit & never hold/trade crypto again?

I've **never** once (since 2013) witnessed anyone exit this addictive, empowering rabbit hole.

Same goes for crypto developers.


forgot to close the position bot ages ago so ill do it now.

!short xbtusd close 9239

Quite disappointed with this position. Since about 9k ive been saying we need a pull back to at least 8600-8400. saw the bear div on the daily. I saw all the signs, even entered a position but couldnt see it through.

In terms of a current position, there isnt one. im thinking of stacking longs between 8k and 7k with a stop at 6.6k. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/JMbpOU5C/

the tightening could easily see us comedown to low 7k/high 6k without losing weekly higher lows.

There really isn’t much on my chart, literally just a couple of lines, no volume or indicators. Today is the beginning of my summer "job". for September, I need to build a solid work ethic and I think this is a great opportunity for this. I want to spend a majority of my time learning, from more advanced TA to trader psychology, portfolio and position management and shit load of other stuff. Trying to read a book a week too. Basically, im trying to soak up as much knowledge as possible in a structured way so that by the end of the summer, I can trade consistently well and have a good work ethic. 

In line with my plans, im looking for recommendations. Books, blogs, literally everything on trading, psychology, economics and just general self-improvement so if you've got any then holla @ me.

edit: think there might be a potential bull div forming on daily obv?

[deleted]
who here thinks we are still in a bear market and are going to reach lower lows for BTC?

You can probably file this under "mildly interesting/probably not useful" but when I noticed the rising support line we're currently toying with traces back to early April, I zoomed out and it actually makes contact back in March of last year as well...

https://imgur.com/a/vk7q8ht
Last time we had a bull div on the 4hr this big was the bottom at 6412.
Tell me why 4000~ people gathering around in one location shilling their alts/icos means anything bullish.

Edit: I guess 8000. Was just going by their site estimates.
Anyone have any thoughts on the Coinbase news that came out yesterday? Essentially they launched a huge suite of tools for institutional investors. Custodianship of funds, margin trading and lending were the features that stood out to me.

The CEO of Coinbase claimed in a recent blog post that there is about 10 billion dollars worth of institutional money that has been waiting on the sidelines for the proper tools to start investing in the space.

I'm cautiously optimistic that the stage is now truly set for big financial organizations to start getting into this space. Thoughts?
A lot of people, including me, are expecting a big bounce at 7800. We'll see if that happens. It could also just start going sideways at this number before curving back up slowly.
After a huge Monday and Tuesday, I'm willing to roll the dice a little with yet-unrealized profits on my current position.

!short XBTUSD add 8200 50%

Setting stops around breakeven. My original entry was in around 8400, so I'm basically CA up around 8300.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/PlG8ITvZ/

This could definitely fly right back up, but I think there are still a large number of longs waiting to cut losses under $8K. If you believe in manipulation (hard not to with these barts), you'd have to think the path of least resistance right now is probably down. Everyone eager to short and longs super skittish. If this continues, there is likely to be another short rektoning coming, but I don't think that time is yet. 

edit: well hot damn. Setting a 25% profit stop just over 8200 and leaving the rest where it was. 
im literally twitching to short. wanted to at 8400, went for a shit, checked the price as i was shitting and it dropped. now my R:R is all fucked so i cant short

why did i want to short? the realisation of consensus being a non-event is setting in and i saw an amazing piece on tether. 

Since this is the only community I post in, I was wondering what you guys think about it? Long af but if true… 

https://medium.com/cryptomedication/uncovering-the-real-cartel-in-bitcoin-65b56a7a00a2

Haven't posted here for a while, took a break for a month or two. Needed to clear my mind I think.

This is what I see on the 4h.

Last year we dumped pretty hard the day after consensus, dno if it will this year but so far it looks pretty bullish its holding the supports so well. A little afraid ill look back at today in a few days and think ‘why didnt i long’. Feels like you could just flip a coin and youd be better off than trying to make any decision here
just finished [this](http://a.co/hMxY5Ku) per /u/jarederaj 's suggestion. very interesting time to read such a thing. do it. good luck yall

The 15m chart looks ridiculous. No one is buying or selling, just a lot of stop hunting (by exchanges?). Why anyone would margin trade in this market is beyond my comprehension, you'd have better luck buying lottery tickets at this point.
Still holding my 8850 short. 

Buying pressure is strong below 8.2k but not enough to fight the downtrend. This doesn't feel like accumulation either even if we have the same bart patterns than during the 6.5-7k range.

The fractal I made is looking good for now : https://www.tradingview.com/x/AeWkEI8J/

The previous bart stopped at the support-turned-resistance of the previous bear flag. It looks like it's painting a falling wedge of some sort (just like the previous descent from 11.8k), but it is too early to define the support line yet. It could also be like [this](https://www.tradingview.com/x/K9wlX47y/) but with only two points of contact it is difficult to say. 

We're currently dancing around the 0.5 fib, and as the trend is down I believe we will visit the 0.618 fib at 7800 soon enough.

Contra-indicators :

- Last minute uber bullish news from the consensus could make us break the downtrend (similarly, lack of news could push this down hard)
- A lot of people on tradingview are calling 7.8k (eVeN tHe mIgHtY D4rK En3rGy) and I don't like this
- Eth trying to make a daily higher low and is often leading the market


I currently have a break even stop on my short (too much stop hunting to try to have a decent ~~short~~ stop). But I plan to close between 8k and 7.8k and depending on how we get there I'll probably open a long sub 8k.

EDIT: a word




I keep hearing that institutional money "won't buy at these prices" and will just force the price down. That's possible, but in considering  it realistically, do you really think that the big holders/miners who have been in the crypto game for years are going to just sit back and let GS or whoever crash the price down to $4k so that their clients can "buy in cheap"? I would think that the deck is stacked against new entrants to the market, looking for thoughts on this.
So we'll bart a few times here, and then go below 8000 today?
What’s the general consensus, will we go sideways or continue to fall?

Surprise pump attempt but so far it's been sold pretty well into. Stop hunt-esque

edit: currently running up in a little channel, would meet short term trend line around 8300

https://www.tradingview.com/x/POHFWboq/
Looks like we had a mini GD, perhaps profit taking from shorts plus stop hunting bottom shorts gave it a bit of legs. But you can see it bounce right off the support turned resistance we dance around all day yesterday. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/puQOAFME/

I had set my stops above that red line and I'll probably move it a bit higher. I'm preparing myself for some serious chop today, but indicators on longer time frames looks like more downside than up. RSI cooled off, MACD crossed bearish on the 4H and ichi is overall bearish.
[4H looks like another bear flag.] (https://www.tradingview.com/x/1bbqDeJN/) Targeting 7800 still. |


Edit: June futures are in $10 backwardation.
I am sure this question has been asked many times here before... But since I am quite new here I would like to ask how do you guys allocate your portfolio?How much &#37;&#37;&#37; do you store as cold storage BTC, Alts? How much goes in margin trading? How much you keep in cash waiting for a good moment to buy?

I personally keep right now around 20&#37; in margin trading, 70&#37; in tether \(I know right\) and 10&#37; in one alt i strongly believe in.
ETHUSD on finex wicked down 10%. Looks like the eth alliance news caused this bart formation.
So drunk trading apparently works. I closed my long at 8350 and then the thing dives down.

I'm not hot on ta, though I use the 15 Min a lot and like horizontal resistance.

I've traded this as follows: when the horizontal trends up that's a buy. If it heads down it's a sell. All short term and based on the 15 min.
Would anyone consider this a bullish divergence on the 6 hour? There's a slightly lower price \(factoring in the wicks\), but a higher low on the oscillator.

Ignore the lines, I'm a noob :\~\)
Hello, friends. This is my best-guess for Bitcoin's path, based on the descending channel, bear flag target, and fibonacci retracement pattern from the $11,800 double top crash. When BTC crashed from $11,800 double top, it made a strong bounce at 0.5 retracement and then oscillated between 0.5 and 0.382 retracement before making the (semi) final drop to .786 retracement($7200).

Not saying how it will end up, but it's just my best guess.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/zp8FiHMM/
It's just the yearly daily Volume Weighted MA (VWMA 365) we bounced on today. ;)
https://www.tradingview.com/x/elFKnFEs/
Nope. Still not touching this with s 10ft barge pole.

I decided to sit out the chop until 8.2 or 9k+, hoping to catch a clear bounce/rejection/breakout. Not convinced by this bounce from ~8.2, just looks like we're back on Evergreen terrace for a bit.
A little bit off topic, but the TrueUSD "stablecoin" is 30% up today.
It should have been a 1$ +- 0.01 coin. What can cause shit like this ?
The good news for scalpers is: you probably have around 4-6 hours where you can scalp the 8360-8420 range back and forth, before the market makers on bitfinex decide our next direction. Sounds kinda sad, but i'm 80% sure that this will be the case. I actually hope that i am wrong and we get some organic moves tho.
Nasty head and shoulder on the four hour timeframe (can mock up a shit tier trading view chart for my shit tier observation if anyones interested) projecting downwards from the neckline looks like it would take us to the low 7's if it played out.
Nice volume at these levels. 
You're tearing me apart Gdax
this is becoming like many of my ex girlfriends... boring, predictable and erection destroying. 

How much longer are we going to have to endure this Bart bullshit 
Closed my short from $8336 for about a 1.01% profit before. 

This range is fucking sketchy.

Trying to day trade this is like being a cute girl showing up at Bill Cosby’s house party in a short skirt after a bottle of white wine. 
8300 would be a good bullish entry IMO.

1. Bull div on medium\-term timeframes \(4\-12h\)
2. Cloud support
3. 50&#37; fib support

The 2-weekly never flipped bear. https://www.tradingview.com/x/2vzatdJN/

They convinced sentiment, and conditioned you to stay in the wrong position. Keep laughing at the longs that keep opening up. 🙊 And don't be surprised for what happens after 
IMO this price is equivalent to 6.4k just a few weeks ago.... in the moment this is tough for even a seasoned trader to long and "feels" like the bottom could fall out at any moment but in 1 week you will be kicking yourself for not pulling the trigger.

[Another wedge that could be painted](https://prnt.sc/jifxzg)

I'm bearish, but bulls are still gonna fight for their case. Just something to look out for when trading. If we go sub 6k, it'll take a while..which sucks because the faster we can see a strong bounce, capitulation, weekly RSI oversold, the more easier it is to be bullish again.

There were 3 macro  falling wedges during our fall from 11.7k and they all provided great trade potential
Long 8225
This is looking more organic than the other pumps today.  BTC is taking the stairs up and ETH is pushing hard on ETH-BTC ratio, which tends to lead BTC pumps.

At this moment BTC is having a small inverse dead cat bounce.  If it is able to push through I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of shorts start closing.  I think many longs are more tolerant to being underwater.  Shorts are more "calculated" traders IMO, which would probably be concerned that they are about to get rekt.

But, this shit is crazy, so who knows...

Edit:  In addition, if our position bot is to be used as a gauge, most shorts are probably still in profit or break-even, where I would think they would want to take profit and get out of a position.  Conversely, most longs are still pretty far underwater, which means when positive momentum comes they probably won't be as motivated to sell to take profit, which would help to keep the order books thinner on the sell side, giving an easier path up.
Has this been discussed here?

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-16/square-s-dorsey-is-all-in-on-bitcoin-as-currency-of-the-future

CEO of twitter one of the worlds biggest social network and a one of america's fastest growing payment processors Square, and he wants bitcoin to be the defacto online currency.

Now thats bullish
And here comes the bearish TK cross on the double 12h chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/wghiHeQQ/

7.8k will not be the bottom here. We should have hit it already if we wanted to bounce at that level. I think we're looking for at least 7.4-7.5k which according to my interpretation is the target for this last bear flag on the 12H chart.
I think we are likely due for a bounce, but I am still staying short (but with a small position).   I just figure more downside risk than upside potential.  If we bounce, it will probably just be 2 or 3% at best and then more down.   

I don't like to trade against what I think is most likely, but this seems like the best move right now, especially with bedtime approaching.
Well what do ya know. bear flag breaking up again. 

I was just going to say if we break 8300 I think we'll go up again, but market beat me to it.

Went long here. We broke through our descending triangle resistance line before. The “ Triangle “ was a little sketchy only having 2 points of contact on the bottom. It’s been giving us resistance all day and we finally nudged our way through. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/J1ZyPHQs/

The ascending triangle we are in looks more promising, where there are points of contact on both support/ resistance. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/0Z2iWKiW/

Buying pressure is relentless. Feeling a BGD. Not the smartest to open a position before bed, but I’ve made nice trades recently and with tight stops I can sleep a tad bit easier. 

8400+ is going to a be a bitch to break through, but if so a target of 8600 could be conquered. I’ll close half of my long at 8450-8500 and the other half around 8600.

Edit: !long XBTUSD open 8336 5x 50%
Anyone think we’re about to squeeze into the end of the triangle and break through resistance followed by a BGD? The gap is tightening up on an uptrend. 
Well I guess goodbye 8k...and hello 7ks again.

The short term bullishness appears to be over and so back to the bear on all time scales for me. It's a shame, I enjoyed the last 2 weeks or so.

So once again the question becomes, just how low do we go! Do we dare retest that 6.5k region. If we do, does it hold? This time I wouldn't have thought so. 
it's time to have bullish calls again boys. Weekly closes above 10k, and may closes at 13.7 https://www.tradingview.com/x/cXm9ujOG/
8000 holding up better than expected, considering a long above resistance.

Edit: Long hit overnight.

!long XBTUSD 8200 4X 100%
It looks like someone is trying to keep the price at this level. Volume increases dramatically in opposite direction as soon as the price moves up or down.

This suppression on both sides will go on until the next big candle in my opinion. To put it differently, some entity is clearly having almost 100% control over the price because of the low volume a the moment.
Any idea what their strategy is here? 
Bull pennant on shorter time frames (15m, 30m) reaching the appex in 30 minutes or so (i ignored the wick to 8427).

Any bets on this breaking up or down?
Could also be a flag that just didn't have enough time to define the pattern
That pyramid of green candles in the 15 min looks so unstable and like it’s going to crash very soon 

Edit: earlier today I though we will have another leg down before  the bounce (wrong), then I thought we might continue to go up for a little longer after the BART up from a couple hours ago (wrong). Good thing I didn’t bet any money on it, and I wouldn’t do it now. 

Edit: wrong again. So I think next time I predict something I’ll put the money on the opposite side, seems to be a safe approach.
Can’t really make a pattern of things from all this chop but this micro trend line seems to be something. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/IjdeyDmr/
This is what I'm looking at: https://www.tradingview.com/x/GxYr9zdW/  

Bears short the orange line with stops over yellow resistance.  
Bulls long the green line with stops under yellow support. 

Obviously R/R favors the shorts at current levels. Or just stay away.

What does "barting" mean?
sweet sweet liquidity 
We're in a tight spot, 15m bb tightening, there's gonna be a move soon...
I've been following [this path](https://i.imgur.com/xSxXQ97.jpg) that I drew up on the 8th. 

The updated version is [pretty spot on so far](https://i.imgur.com/zXww0SE.jpg). If anything, it's less dramatic.
It looks like it is trying to go higher with these periodic spikes, but seen this before very recently where it climbs up slowly and then dumps $300 in minutes.  So going to stay with a small short.
Many altcoins are forming a double bottom or fail to do so and break down from here \(3 examples: XRP, XLM and XMR\).
Again I got the feeling it's time to start buying physical eth and btc instead of margin trading. This tells me that I would not be surprised about some big move soon and a drop getting bought up fast since I assume more people have this feeling 
!short XBTUSD close 8188

Time to take some profit.

My non-TA based feeling: i expect a complete bart to take us back to 6800, and reverse the BGD on 12th of April. When could this happen? When bears will break 7800.

My TA-0-knowledge feeling: sideways for months between 8.000-9800.
No one here truly knows with any sort of certainty if this bad boy is going to break up or down. No one. No one knew Consensus 2018 wouldn't have some insanely bullish news. No one. 


So to the bulls who are bummed about the drop to 8.2, its fine, we were looking at historical trends. To the bears who are happy about the drop to 8.2, congrats, you might have made a great play. But the key here is to have a plan and STICK TO IT. Flip flopping and overtrading will kill portfolios. Many regard chasing BRDs and BGDs as a cardinal sin of trading and I will not be shorting or moving to fiat ***personally***. 


With all of the institutional news and cryptocurrency business being developed, I am not willing to risk having an open short position. Again, this is all just my opinion. The key here is to calm down, don't trade emotionally, and stick to your plan. 



Good Luck. 



What a tense day in Bitcoin's history. I woke up to $8,132. Spent minimal time today looking at the charts but was definitely informed about the market movements. 

Who still doesn't believe that instead of $7,000 range, we will be heading to $9,000 range?

As for my position, still riding, thought about adding fresh stack during $8,100 range but nah. Already have enough. 

And I really hope many of you have already opened good positions here. I would love to know what is everybody doing currently (Fiat, Short or Long). Cheers! :)
!long XBTUSD 8296 5X 90&#37;

Next BD will be G.  Pretty much guaranteed.  Why?  Because the dumps are weak nowadays. Very weak.  Somebody sprayed a lot of Bitcoin at the market and didn't significantly affect the price.  Bullish. A. F.
I have a hard time believing we will drop much further down. To me, 7800 will be the absolute bottom. we are holding right on the 50% fib retracement from 6.4k and there are two ways to draw a descending wedge on the 4h both of which do not go below 8k. My personal opinion is that we will consolidate in the 8 to 9k region for a while before making a move in either direction, there is a reason Mr. Green pops up once in a while to keep the price from falling further down

Can someone use layman’s terms to help me understand what’s happening? Just a regular crypto gal trying to figure out my next steps. I get the bart BS. What are we waiting to happen or what needs to happen to try having a shot at recovering?

PS I’m drunk 😵 
So, with the Consensus pump exposed as a bull-meme, what do you guys think of Coinbase and LedgerX catering to institutional investors? Incoming institutional investors has been be the medium term bull-narrative lately of which I have some healthy skepticism, but on the other hand you'd expect companies such as Coinbase/LedgerX to have properly done their market research.
closed my long from a couple of days ago at pretty much breakeven. summer has distracted me too much to get a decent short entry on this one, but as someone said earlier, the target for this bearflag is much lower than we currently are, so probably still time to short.

What's the safe strategy here?

Short below 8100, long above 9000? We've been rejected from 8900 in the past 36 hours, and several times from 8400/8500. But, there doesn't appear to be the appetite to push the price below 8100.
Took 50% profit from my averaged 8220 long posted a few hours ago at 8450. Will add more to it if we go back under 8400

Edit: took the profit and added to my long at 8375. SL still at 8090

Bullish TK cross on 3D. I’m definitely holding on to my long @8410. 
This looks similar to march 2016 with the noted exception, I would hazard to guess Barts are due to altcoins influence on btc. Bears are running out of time to push this down and even then we won't see 6900 again. My take on this. Bullish trend should resume in a few days.

Usually these dips piss me off.

But I actually find them quite funny at this point.

Overall I can’t see us not going back up for comic relief alone.

Everything oversold. Stoch RSI laughably low, RSI has room to go further down... into negative territory. Chart looks like a bipolar autistic kid’s self portrait.

Out of a serious position for the foreseeable future. Withdrew the majority of my trading stack. Left 0.5 on Mex for fun. Already up to 0.75 😂
In price comparisons to the 2013/2014 crash, did BTC make a higher low like we did in the bounce from 6700? I'm pretty sure in 2014 it bounced right up and was highly for a while before going lower... this looks like a series of higher lows to me as long as we turn around somewhere in the 7000s (if we get that low)

15min triangle has to break within the next half hour.  My bet is still long (opened at $8180 this morning).

Damn I was out of position. If I had been in position right now though, and it was a long, I would have closed it immediately.

50% in on a long with a super tight 8100 stop. I see the tk cross but always assumed it was a lagging indicator?

Everyone is super bear here so long I go....
It just seems that we continue bouncing between the extremes of the 8000s.  The pattern is repeating often enough here for 8800-8900 to be realistic today.  Why bother betting against it when it just keeps happening?  Long anything below 8200, short anything above 8700, and just set some tight stops @ 8k and 9k. 
I wish Dumpy the Bearwhale would just hurry up and shoot his wad so we can go up again.

Bleh. My long from 8350 got stopped out last night at 8180 - which is fine, but I should've closed my hedge short from 8.8 earlier - just got stopped out at 8400. Somehow didn't end up with as much as I thought. Breaking 8.2 really fooled me into thinking we were going down. 
!long btcusd close 8184

Got stopped out again.  I am obviously setting stops too tight.  Will try to remedy that going forward. 
I just realized that our reversal points were at highs on dates 1/5, 3/4, and 5/4, and at lows on dates 2/5 and 4/5. That's within a day range for every single month this year. Any idea why?

(Edit: for the non-Americans, we have had significant reversals on the 4th or 5th day of every month this year. Is this just a coincidence?)
I'm still learning the TA charting ropes and am hesitant to cough up for a Tradingview subscription at the moment, but I'd like to be able to have many different charts to work on and save. Is there any sneaky ways around this limitation that anyone is aware of, or an alternative site that is a bit more generous with their limits? 

I know there's a 30 days free trial but it requires credit card and I'm not sure I want to get into that right now. 

I've thought about having a different account set up for each chart but hoping for an easier solution. 

Any chance we could get the price ticker back on the new reddit banner? How is everyone liking the new layout btw, I actually don't mind it
that's becoming very entertaining to watch these fake outs like the one we just had

it's not that entertaining if you have a position though, i guess

edit: going to bounce at 8160 and go somewhere to 8500 just to drop back?
5-30m RSI is gyrating around 50. This usually leads to a rise but does anyone know why?
At this point, not even nervous to have a SL so close to this.

Edit to elaborate: feels like it just won't hit as the price is asymptotically close.  And if it does hit, I'll have plenty of time to reconsider entering without worry about getting a worse entry.  But not gonna get caught in a short if this does pop up.

Edit 2: well well.  The pump on the top 5 coins was looking scary.  Then I see my mentors closing.  Then we had a chance retrace down and started heading up again on next 30min candle, so closed as well (had opened a short in the center of this, and dca'd it up on the wicks to the upper region)
It retraced to the vwap. expecting blast-off afterwards
https://www.tradingview.com/x/M36PQDd2/
Switched sides. I really thought 7800 was in the cards but took profits so I can’t complain. I’ll be bullish after 8800 breaks in the meantime I’ll be cautious with this long.

Ohh great, more barting up. If we could just pick a direction and stick to it even slightly that'd be great.
Well well looks like the short term floor is in at 8200. I will do as I wrote before and start scaling in some buys. Don't underestimate the price psychology I think, before the "lowest low" floor everyone was waiting to buy at was 6800, if 8200 holds  again for this week this might turn to be the next one

'Institutional Order Flow' - this is how you force liquidity within an iliquid market: https://www.tradingview.com/x/pmodZagr/

If i remember well, the last time we had bart after bart, it was in the same price range, but a bit lower (7800-8200 - before we had the breakout to 9900).

Ideal situation for me would be a rise to $8650 for the quick snipe on the 8500 long from the other day, followed by a pullback to like $7k so I can cash in these dollars I got for my [thing I don't want or need] into some el cheapo Bitcoin. Confident about the first part. Dip to $7k is just dreaming, but it's Bitcoin, where dreams come true, right? 
How do I earn interest on my coins on BitMex? I found a page about earning interest income, but I can't find a way to actually lend my coins out. I just registered 15 minutes ago and the website is, at first sight, really busy and unorganised looking. 
You have to give these big bears credit: They are not capitulating even though the tide has obviously turned against them.  Keep wasting your money, boys.  Death by a thousand cuts it is!
Sub 8200 is within distance, if it is confidently breached, next target $6.3k. RIP bitcoin, RIP thomas lee 70% up prediction lololo

But first, 9.3 chad

I will be shocked if we bounce right off 7800
Would you try to close your short at or around 7800 in anticipation of bounce, and re-short on the bounce? Or just hold on to your original short?
You know that support turned resistance is corresponding to last 6.5 drop? It has couple of touches.
I'd shift the stops down a bit. Good luck though. 
!short XBTUSD close 8310

Waiting for the dump now :)
No conviction.  “I may regret this”
Have some confidence in your trade. MAN UP!

Everyone here is just gambling and calling it trading. It’s so damn obvious.
Wish you all the best for this trade! :)
I support you getting off. Their severs are crap.
Bitfinex instead?
June gifted me an 8412 entry, though. Still, I'm playing with a lot less than most people and I've gotten quite fortunate on my last half dozen trades. I could easily have been getting rekt this whole time.
Which exchange would you move to?
I agree with the downsides, but where are you planning on moving to?   I don't see any other reasonable options.
Any ideas on where to?
I am torn between the three, bitmex okcoin and finex. 

How did it jump to 100 premium marked? I thought marked prices are set based on funding rate which is low right now
I believe you have 90% hodl and 10% trade so you can short 10x and maintain fiat value. If you move to another one only allowing 3.33x or 5x will you change your ratio?
Didn't use Mex for a month. Decided I'm going back there, I'm really frustrated about server issues and I'm really close to move away again... Get it ng f..cked by them all the time...
AutoMod took it down. I put it back up. Not sure why that happened yet. I'll add you to the approved list so that doesn't happen anymore.
Shit, I didn't even see it and was looking forward to reading it!
Could you please post it here or send in PM? would love to read it! Why would the mods remove?
That sucks ~  would liked to have read it.
You're in the list of approved submitters now. Happy posting.
Apparently in this sub the only posts allowed must be fully understood by the mods... so if your post was intelligent enough to go over their heads... you’re banned.  It’s very silly in here.
Nice move mate
Even though I'm short currently, this is a pretty good approach. 
Actually im seeing pretry good support at the 8k mark, cant upload my chart since im no mobile though.
Actually it seems obvious to go long here and try to profit from another dead cat bounce.  
A marge then? 
If this happens I'm making a Wikipedia page about this historical phenomenon. 
Simpsons did it first.
I strongly doubt we get a BRD to 6800, but I'm game! Just traded an unnecessary luxury for some fiat that would love to become as much Bitcoin as possible.
This is what that euthanasia roller coaster must be like.

How does the actor benefit? Does the market maker get part of the trading fees when sold/bought into (by forced liquidations or market order stoplosses)? 
Anyone who uses that much leverage deserves to lose their money.

Welcome to the bart market
Around 100 / 150 Bulltraps.
Zoom out to weekly and it looks normal, especially compared to pre December bull run.
I was just watching that.
This triangle just got another contact point. Getting stronger.
What’s the 4hr saying? When I look at it I see a massive incoming bart. :/
Most the people in this sub don’t have an edge and really don’t understand how real trading it done. That’s an edge! 😂😂
> What happens to trading desks that have got caught breaching this wall? large fines, reputational damage, some job losses

Nothing in the crypto space.
It's just the momentum bots, and they're getting more aggressive over the last month or so. (Price goes up $3? Slap $300K on the best bid; down $0.50? Sell 30 BTC on the best ask. Etc.)
Don't have a cow man 
hopium is powerful with this one
Broken the local high!
saw that too, they're moving the market
lol
yet another bullmeme. idk why people repeatedly fall for stuff like that. Lots of comparisons to 2015-2016 when price action is completely different 
[deleted]
Pretty sure it was u/SloppySynapses, no? Does anyone remember?
Seems like it’s become a game of luck, so we do need it. That’s very disappointing though.
Recency bias is very strong. Its why its so hard for people to buy the bottom or sell the top. 

You have to have enough confidence in it stopping at or close after the point you have decided on and then reversing after that. When its coming at you with a giant red/green dildo its pretty hard to not believe it will keep on going.

I really would encourage people to at least look at the day/3d/weekly once a day when doing your TA on btc. Gives you a bit of an overview and stops you from getting too emotional about the last 12 hours. 
Very little conviction in price action last weeks doesn't compute with traditional crypto trading mindset. I think what gets to most traders is that the highly anticipated Adam&Eve formation was never confirmed at 11.6k. No closure, just uncertainty at this point
bart simpson might have something to do with that
I know, amazing that so many people haven't figured out how to predict the future yet, pfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
If anyone is buying big, they do it OTC, the price of BTC wont move but when they short it, it will move and thats where profit lies.

The reason the price isnt moving is top whales know there is OTC buys happening but behind curtains and they can dump at any time.

If institutions and big money buys, BUY OTC. Running the price up then to dump cost more and more risk. 

Dumping after a OTC buy with lev shorts will return money with less risk and they can rebuy cheaper coins too.

Any time big money is involed, if there is a short lev option and OTC, dont ever expect big prices, big prices come from retail.

Retail right now is in a unsure or bear state of mind.

Edit: Yes I would love BTC to moon but we have to look both way, there is no moon without doom. They go hand in hand.
i think they are just trading it, not investing. what we need is an etf
Those damn Kauai Roosters man. Hilarious at first but not so funny when you're trying to sleep in.
uhhhh, I don't know, if they want to enter big I think the weird price swings we're seeing is a good method to shake some people out to get a better entry/market share. What that eventually means for price I have no idea. 

I agree that getting past 8.5k would be quite a challenge for today, though it's not 100% out of the questions if we see another big upswing. The real big resistance is still our downtrend from 9.9k which is currently at about 8.7k. I think if we manage to close above 8350 we will grind up towards that resistance by tomorrow and make another attempt. 
Goldman Sachs also has a current prediction of around $4.75k

It's easy to predict $100k with a scarce asset on a long-term uptrend, but its a bumpy road to get there.
Likely not.  I had thought in order to eliminate the volatility problem with BTC, everything would have to be priced in BTC but a GS backed startup, Circle is just creating a digital version of the USD, pegged, which will also eliminate volatility.  There is another startup offering a crypto savings account (can't recall the name).  So if you combine the two well, you have the digital future with no BTC.  GS is just opening up a trading desk so as not to lose customers but i doubt they will invest in BTC.  All that big money is for their own development, unfortunately none of it for BTC.
Accumulation at lower prices by the big players is a likely scenario, before big names begin to enter the market seriously. 
You can always go on GDAX. There's about two people left that trade on there so the moves are less frantic and you get probably 5 minutes of thinking time between every price shift. 
The market is literally designed to piss everyone off at this point so they will lose all their money or just quit. Shaking the tree until all normies have handed their coins over to the market makers.... then we get to moon mission.. 
That's why I've not closed my short and am just sitting here.

When in doubt: don't trade
There are market sells and then there is Mr. Green.
This could be as ascending triangle with top @8380 overlaping  with an descending triangle...

Daring, but a good trading plan. Best of luck!
In Bitcoin, higher lows are what you look for because ideally you're riding the longer trend. When you start seeing higher lows, it's very good. I look for three, and we've had two so far this year (6k and 6.6k) not sure where this next one is, but if it's north of 7.5, I bet we hit $30-35K within a year.

Moon talk can start if 11.6k breaks and holds multiple times
Looking at the 1m candles on GDAX and bitcoin is *literally* giving me the middle finger.
I too am out.
you think so? don't you think much of the sell/short pressure can be attributed to the fact that everyone and their mother thinks that $7,800 is right around the corner? (I don't believe this necessarily)

edit: to add, if your intent is to accumulate, then the drop back down is just the response you're hoping for when you make your buys, you don't want the price to rise too quickly

The path to mainstream adoption IS the bull run and the price will increase significantly.  We are continuously on that path as each development happens that gets us to a condition that looks like mainstream adoption.  Coinbase had 11 million users in November has over 20 million now.  What would be mainstream number?  100 million?  500 million?  And will more users increase the price of crypto?  Of course it will.  But bears can spin anything into being a bad thing because they have an agenda.  That agenda is to either profit on a short, get you to sell lower, or to harm crypto in general in hope they can buy much lower.

Bears can only win for so long here.  They know that their tactics cannot work for much longer so they are pulling out all of the stops until the price makes its inevitable move upward because of a larger market size which results in higher aggregate demand and liquidity.
We likely got as "mainstream" as we are ever going to get in Dec of last year, speaking strictly about Bitcoin.  That was the pinnacle (however sad it was) and can't see how there will ever be much more mainstream adoption of Bitcoin.   In case you guys haven't noticed, it is being made illegal in one country after another.  That tends to slow down adoption quite a bit, and actually reverses it.

But there will likely be some more bull runs, just because they are profitable to those who manipulate the market.  However, a bull run from $2K to $4K is not quite as fun as the one we saw last year.
Some might say this was a ...slippery road
Still a good trade! nice job :)
Lol, same here on the stops and the reopen.  Though I had a few percent of the position still open so my ca has a small breathing space now.

What are your current stops then? If you don't mind me asking.
Instead of women running around in their underwear, there’s middle aged fat guys watching computer screens in their underwear
Try to think of the walls as magnets instead of support 
Unless the walls get pulled?  I’m always leery of walls on the order book until they’re actually tested.
Don't think those walls mean anything. Chances are they're there to be pulled or wash traded into *if* it is decided that the price is going lower, anyway. The 1000 BTC wall on $8200 did absolutely nothing. 
A whale sees walls as an exit. As available liquidity to sell out if we reach it.

They are not support.
order books dont tell you anything. in the previous bullrun it was always the opposite and it had nothing to say. volume is key not orderboooks. 
Good question.
Market has no direction and is indecisive. Nothing else.
But in the end we didn’t manage to go for another bull yet despite breaking the log resistance which is rather bearish imo.

Bouncing around this triangle is good game for some nice scalps until it breaks down, then the big bucks-roonies start flowing in 
You just market bought and sold while it the up bart was playing out? 
yes
They are Bitfinex / Tether related, This morning Bitfinex moved 100 million usdt from Tether treasury to Bitfinex wallet the price jumped a few 100 dollar shortly after.
You also tagged the wrong chewtoy. The underscores seemed like such a good idea at the time...
Ha, sorry about that. I'll try to be more diligent about updating the bot as soon as I open or close a position. 

I didn't realize there was a push notification system that could be setup using the bot. Nifty feature.  
Sorry if you don’t mind me asking, but is the position bot a bot on its own or is it something for price predictions? I haven’t been on the sub for long and have seen chewtoy mentioned quite a bit. Is there any information you can give for a quick run down? Thank you.
Probably plenty of sell pressure too if you let it break through 7.8... It's hard to tell really. 
Looks like every other boom & bust cycle
no resemblance whatsoever. 
When this gets used more than an iPhone, Bitcoin will write its own graphs. 
It's absolutely impossible for digital gold to break the parabola, the chart is lying it's all manipulation.
Not even comparable, but if it were, it would be like buying Amazon in 1999.
Even not having a position is having a position. 
wait few minutes  for dessert.
It's terrible, you're afraid to hold because you think the price can crash in any moment ....and then they start the bart pump and you start to calculate how much potential profit you could have made. 
This is harrowing. Might abandon ship too, will give it just a little longer. Might be my undoing. 
Get out as soon as you have a profit, man.  Hang in there for a couple days if necessary.  But get out.
Hey man wishing you all the best, seems like we are not that far from determining our direction anytime now.

How long did you hold the position? (The max is 28 days if you're in the US)
Is it a trustable source? 
My personal opinion on why we aren't in another 2014 is pretty simple actually - we don't have the same downward pressure from a shitload of stolen BTC from Mt Gox.

I went through that and there was a lot of uncertainty for a long time on what happened, to include if the funds actually stolen or if they were just held captive by the USG, for example. Remember the whole theory around MK providing a 9GAG link and a ton of people taking that as code for him being under a gag order? It was revealed much later that the funds were in fact gone and they were mixed and sold off over an extended period of time.

I do not believe that in any way describes where we are today.
stop coming here for a few months, now i dont know the lingo of the day =Z
If we Bart back up to ~8900, could that be a double bottom from ~8100?
> I have this unreal certainty that we will see a HUGE Bart up very soon. Feels a lot like 6500 and we all know how that ended. 8200 doesn’t wanna fall for long.

Except the potential for a short squeeze is absent.
Not enough shorts for that. At that time everyone was short on bfx.

But clearly the digital gold has absolutely no idea what it's doing.
I've been buying, but small amounts. I think we will at least test the upper 8s again before a clear direction is established. I don't know shit though and I don't have charts (never do.)
Yeah, we're missing the massive shorts. I think a trip to 7800 followed by a bounce to 8200 for the greedy shorts to pile on at an alarming rate is the missing ingredient in that recipe (6800>6400>6800>8000 was how that went)
9k today? I want some of what you're smoking. 
I'm long with a target of 12k, this fall is'nt particularly scary if a fib at 8200 or 7800 holds. after that I will look for exits.
i'm long. My target is 10k with stop loss at 7.7. Have been long since last night at 8180 and bought in more at 8250.
Literally just wanted to post the same. Got a feeling we get a big pamp even though everything looks bearish and there is a bearish sentiment. Not taking a position unless we establish a clear direction seems like a wise move
Get long. R/R is finally delicious for longs as close as you can get to 8k with stops under 7.8. 
$9k today hahahaha

The delusions here are actually mind boggling 
Dude, you finally seem to be on the right side I think, what changed your mind though? :D

/u/L14dy said in a post recently that this behaviour is new.
Can I leave this here? https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/05/050505.asp
Article is about range vs trend.
I've been doing this for five years and I don't remember this kind of absurd market action, repeatedly occurring.

Of course other action that was much more absurd, but not like this.
I'm trading Bitcoin and Altcoins since 2013 , some manipulation occurred but not on this crazy scale, this strange market behaviour started a year ago.
What’s bart mean? Did it ever behave how? Sorry not an expert trader 
We need to develop some bart ground rules as to what defines a Bart and what doesn’t 
Can someone elaborate what BGD/BRD means?
That's generally what one would expect. 

Markets are cyclical. 

Periods of consolidation beget periods of volatility, which beget periods of consolidation, which beget periods of volatility...etc.
I feel like it's an entitled perspective to assume that the insane gains that were had last year would just magically happen again so quickly. People think just because that's what happened to other people, the same will happen to them. No guarantees. 
Great news for anyone with more than a year or two left to live. At $20k I bet you wished you had more time to accumulate lower. Well here is your chance.
Yup. At the very least, for a few more months.
A decrease in chop is actually a sign of macro accumulation (whales buying the bottom).  Big boys have 0 desire to play with these $1k barts whether up or down.  They will be buying in during the long painful, boring sideways periods.  In 14/15, that sideways period lasted ~8 months.
no, i think we are due for a move down

this thing gave up $9800, then $9000, then $8500 and is now struggling to stay above $8000. We bounced of $8100 but are struggling to get above $8300 
This year and next year will be a flop imo.  2020 will bring real changes/growth along with another halvening and then another bull run.  Accumulate while you can.
[deleted]
My prospective is that btc will drop to $7100-7300 this month, then bounce hard and probably set new highs this year (not sure about new highs, but very confident in the bottom at 7100-7300)
Nope, I don't see a reason for that. Looking at the Adam & Eve started half Jan this year: Very bullish from this week on.
Can't think of a single reason why it would continue downwards.
I agree. We have already set a lower high and low. I cant find a reason to go long here.

My idea:

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/cNdgZZOq-11788-double-top-crash-VS-9990-crash/
Who the hell is saying we are mooning? I think some people are long but that doesn’t mean 20k
> The amount of people in here saying we're going to the moon while we go sideways for 12 hours has me wary. 

Sentiment seems pretty 50/50. 
yeah agreed, we just tested a lower low on this dump. the walls at $8K have been pulled. And now we are struggling to get above $8,400 on low volume...basically old support turned resistance. 

Gee, I wonder what will happen when this dead cat bounce runs out of steam and the dumping resumes
I've been bearish for most of 2018. I killed it the last two days shorting, but take some decent hits today with the megawick horseshit on MEX. Was planning to stay out, but I saw the slow bleed and chew go long, so I followed (8375 Jun) with a smallish position. Trailing stop on and heading to bed. Guess I get to see what it feels like on the other side of the coin lol
It’s more fun being bullish than bearish. Being bearish is just down right depressing. 

So if there is any hope of being a bull, I’ll flip a coin and be a bull if the indicators are pointing in that direction. 
Don't know if anyone else has noticed this, but "down-Barts" are often shorter (~50%) than "up-Barts".
I’m kinda new Crypto so could someone explain to me whether an inverted bart is a flag for a dump or pump? I looked it up and all I could find information on is how it looks like Bart Simpson’s head :/
Can we call them Hugos?
>this is a suckers rally

>2k later

hehehhee
Dude I have no idea... which is why I'm not trading this... every time I look at the chart I laugh because price keeps moving against my intuitions.

The only way we get $9k is if we break the downtrend line ... which is a possibility with this latest bart... perhaps we do something [ridiculous like this](https://www.tradingview.com/x/wz3L2ibS/).  I mean this would \*definitely\* fuck up everyone's mojo.
Current downtrend at 8.7 https://prnt.sc/jikr4v

A break of that would likely see higher than 9k. It looked like we just didn't have any more sellers at 8.2, panic close shorts and stops hit.
Woke up thinking it could mega Bart back to 8.7k, was surprised to see it only came up to 8.3-8.4k.
"I’m itching to open a long here and I’m not sure why"

Then don't.
Maybe wait ;)

Or maybe not, idk anything goes atm
I know what a descending triangle is *supposed* to do, but I don't really know how to feel about 2 points of contact on the support line vs. a resistance line that's been hammered at for over a day.
It's happening!
When the bart movements continue the price will go -up- to complete the pattern, but i dont understand why people keep falling for this blatant manipulation and get trapped in again ( probably for the 20th time... btc traders never learn and have a short term memory ) 
Ide say just over 8450. But I’m a sub par trader at best 
You've BeenWatching I assume so I think you should know it is never too late. 
Hey care to explain how that works? I’ve been wanting to figure out im new to crypto but haven’t made excellent day trades until the recent crash 
falling down looks very easy and logical now. public confidence is dent, we haven't heard old hodlers screaming and calling suicide line, no new money enters the market (just see google searches). we might test and break 6k sooner rather than later. 
I have it touching our resistance line from the dump starting yesterday. If it doesn't go much lower might be confirming resistance turned support? 
I'm fairly sure it's just ETH tri arb bots, that's why this is all confusing

ETH ratio is at a 3 month high 
2018's must-have fork: Bartcoin. 
don't have a cow, man
yes
This is the new reality. Its barts all the way down.
It's Mr. Burns, such degree of evil can only come from him!
good on you for recognizing no trade zone

If used correctly an edge can be found in these barts, at the very least a potential Bart formation gives you entries with tight stops and good r/r.
100% agree

BUT... if we do go lower, the long term log trend line meets the log resistance line at ~5500 or so.

I will bet my left nut we never go below the long term log trend line ever again.

EDIT: I don’t know how to save the tradingview chart and share a link, but I drew it just now. The lines intersect at pretty much exactly 5500

EDIt: Fixed a grammatical error in my original
comment
Almost nicely coincidencing with that line is our old log term resistence line from 20k -> 17k -> 11.7k that we blasted through on 20. of april that we never confirmed as resistence turned support. Its currently sitting at ~7.2k. IF (big IF) things follow the 2014 bear market, that line may serve as a support for a longer time frame. 
Nice list.

Also, nobody at any of these companies is going to buying coins in some crazy panic while the conference is on.

They'll return to base, analyze the info, present to colleagues etc. etc. and probably only look to start the ball rolling before the summer holidays.
I noticed the same. 

Anyone here know if bitmex futures have *ever* been at any sort of a significant discount? 

I mean we kind of all just assume there will eventually be a premium. 

Is it really safe to assume this will always be true? 
What a fucking short this had already turned out to be. Could double bottom at \~8.2 though, but hopefully the sun will be worth it.
The safest bet would be stops above 8400. This seems to be a descending triangle. 
I feel your pain mate.
put stops right below liqui or you will forfeit your initial margin as well
I’m buying more. Never a bad time to buy bitcoin 
op starts solid/s TA then tapers down, exactly like last hour's candle
https://www.tradingview.com/x/ECTLQ7Fd/

how is that different from that one? just curious cause I'm not sure I see it
BGD's and Barts were specifically designed for your particular situation. 

Edit: take like 50% and let the other 50% ride with breakevem SL/ or lower.
It's always a good idea to take profits when you have them instead of getting greedy and hope for crypto gods to favor you. Market is especially choppy and could go in any direction at a moment's notice. Not taking profits is gambling now IMO.
Also think its a pennant, should find out soon enough.
Edit: no, its a flag after all
It looks like we're making a bear flag, but to be honest it's holding up pretty well and the support seems to be beefing up. IF we break down, next levels to look for are between 8.1k-8k, though the eventual target of our larger bearflag that we made between 8.2k- 8.9k would put us in the rage of 7.6-6.9k depending on where you place the pole. 

Personally, I don't think we'll fully correct to sub 7k as the support is pretty decent below, but it's probably best to see where the next drop lands us, and if we manage to get beyond 8k.

I’ve been setting loose stops on non leveraged longs and getting rekt by wicks all week.  Losing 2-3% every couple days.  Right now I’m in a E** long at 680 and moved my SL up to 696 on the dildo.  Watch me get stopped at 692....
What is the announcement? And yes sell the news rumors in this space are insanely self perpetuating at this point. 
On the 1h chart, I see a picture perfect "flipping you the bird" formation playing out right now. Sorry on my phone and couldn't link a chart.
What does an ETH alliance have to do with bitcoin? 
Do you mean this one? https://www.coindesk.com/enterprise-ethereum-alliance-unveils-common-blockchain-standards/
I'm a bit torn on short-term TA with these whipsaw up and downs. 

This type of movement is precisely why many technical analysts (myself included) disregard long wicks if doing so creates a stronger argument for a particular pattern. 
Honestly, this is a real tussle between bears and bulls right here. I think it'll be a matter of who runs out of steam first. 
Went long because of the div and the wedge 
Problem is this divergence is ignoring the higher low between the two lows.
4hr bull div has been 100% reliable so far since 20k top. And the wedge you drew up is exactly what I’m watching.
These wicks today have been absolutely insane.
woof, this might suck - you reshorting? I closed my short and flipped long earlier but didn't really have a plan for what I'd do if we broke 9.4... I'm a bit surprised by the pushback
u should "stop" how much money you're giving Arthur Hayes. the dude practically told us all he's taking our money w these fees 
This is one reason why I use mental stops, instead of orders on the exchange.  Although of course it backfires sometimes, especially on Bitmex when you can't even get an order through.
Almost everyone I know who had bought in last autumn became a hodler after loosing 80-90% in January February, and everyone says the same thing “I’ll just hodl, I don’t care anymore”
a lot of people have left the pimp game.

Who here has zoomed out to the weekly and seen that a correction was due?
I hadn't even noticed the connection to March of last year, but I do think the connection to early April is significant. If we can get back up into that channel, I see it as our way up and out of the big triangle we've been in since January, and our path to 14k. https://www.tradingview.com/x/bPX6vBgq/

I'm not an expert so if someone with more experience could chime in that'd be great. Like /u/mandy7 or /u/_chewtoy_ 
sentiment is similar to that actually , almost everyone is bearish , drop is expected by most , buy walls are pulled , prepare for 7k , it just feels the same 
Have you even looked at the list of attendees, sponsors, and panelists?? Many of them are from VCs and funds. Many are from consulting and accounting firms (Deloitte having a strong showing in particular). I would bet you have not even looked, are going short, and trying to instill FUD. Sad, honestly. 



Edit: Just for fun, I went through to just see how many huge financial players were there as panelists, sponsors, and speakers. All of these were ones that I recognized immediately: 


Federal Reserve, Deloitte (Consulting and Tax), U.S. House of Reps Representative, Silicon Valley Bank, Athena Capital, Blockchain Capital, Airfoil Capital, U.S. CFTC Representative, Grayscale Investments, Representative from the World economic Forum, SEC Representative, Tetras Capital, Park Capital, HCM Capital, Multicoin Capital, JM3 Capital, Fortress Investments, Credit Suisse, Union Square Ventures. 



As well as: Fedex Corp, IBM, Microsoft, and a bunch of other huge tech companies. So yeah, thats why things look bullish in my eyes. 
All previous years there was a huge investment in alts after the conference and BTC just came along for the ride.  The chart for instance indicated 70% increase for BTC but 500% for the alts because probably not a lot of alt/Fiat pairs at exchanges.  Now the rage is the block chain not so much the coin. The only news you hear from the big players is creating their own blockchain .  I don't think any of them have plans to throw money at BTC or even an alt hoping that it moons.  That time has passed.  These companies have the resources to create their own blockchain/token so why wait on another external team.   You think the Federal reserve is there to learn about BTC and sink billions into it?

Don’t forget ICE and their new custodial feature 
I think it just coinbase trying to keep with the competition, this institutional money has already been here since 8k last year.
It’s more of a matter of *when* and not *if*, at this point. 

If these guys see Bitcoin depreciating, I’d imagine they’re going to wait and find the best entry they possibly can. 
bitcoin=the internet

coinbase=AOL

with that being said, I don't know enough about what kind of demand they specifically are actually seeing from institutional money, so hard to say.

edit: word
institutional money is no longer on the sidelines.
I expect a nice bounce too before we test new lows.

And also see the bulltards jump the gun again: "correction is over"
We saw an 8% bounce already.

I was following that guy on telegram for a week or two, couldn’t stand it much longer: he writes nonsense that’s usually so absurd that I’m sure you don’t have to pay any attention to what he says 

Anyways, tether suck and I don’t trust it at all although I still use it myself. Keeps me sweaty when I do.

Edit: the reason he’s doing it is because he wants publicity and free PR and it’s out of question. Just look into the stuff that he had to do with bitcoin bravado.. He literally made a fucking elephant out of a tiny fly.  It’s always easy to say in this space “ah okay I think I was wrong about it, but it’s better safe than sorry and I’ll keep you updated as soon as I think something as fishy” and people will always forgive you. The funniest thing that in the end he will turn out to be right about one single thing out of a thousand and he will proclaim him as the smartest investigator in crypto space.
If you can explain a conspiracy with incompetence of the involved parties it is always more plausible.
 That said: I think some players have or are still commiting fraud but a highly organized conspiracy with so many parties involved seems unlikely.
If he's right he's just the proverbial broken clock. From what I can tell from his articles he's not the sharpest tool in the shed. His article about how he 'uncovered' that the SEC was not attempting to determine if ETH is a security by phoning the SEC and asking them was truly laughable.
Crypto's short term fate was sealed long long before Consensus

Before Consensus last year, Bitcoin went from a low of ~$880 to a high of $2700 without a single correction of more than a couple percent and without even any sideways consolidation.

Not really comparable situations.
I was actually planning to go 20% in USDT after Consensus. My reasoning: This is a very bullish event, but still we did not go up much before/during it. People might therefore lose some faith short term. Also, maybe history repeats and there is a drop as the last years. What do you guys think?
pretty sure we already dumped pretty hard
Things look bullish to you, do you willingly ignore what we've experienced recently? 
That's one internet point for you.
Is it going to be anything new for anyone already disillusioned with politics 
This belongs in r/politics.
I'm in with gambling money that once they get in the BTC wallet i consider them lost.

Why would some of you expect to make money so easy ? Take 2017 out of your mind, going one way (up or down) a whole year won't happen again. You have to sweat to make money.
if you stick to 1d+ you're fine, anything less and you get chopped up
lol, thought that was an addresss for a second
About ETH leading BTC up from here.  I noticed ETHBTC has a weekly inside bar forming after 6 green weeks.

I’m not sure I’d count on ETH pulling BTC anywhere.

Best case scenario is ETH goes sideways while BTC recovers thus pulling ETHBTC down to set a weekly higher low.  It could happen though, similar to the $800/11,700 price action right before the big drop to $6500.

I suspect though that BTC is gonna slow down on its downtrend for now while ETH starts dropping like a rock.
I'm on the same boat as you, still short from CA 8680, will try to close half in the 7900-7800 range and depends on when and how we get there close it all and I might go long. But I'm ready for the opposite to happen or sideways until daily close.

I'm looking at the same falling wedge, though I'm really not sure if we'll manage to break 8k, especially because so many people are expecting it. I also agree with your statement on ETH. 

I'm setting alarms for 8k and see how hard we drop, but I plan on opening a long around there. 
What would miners do to counter the selling pressure? Buy more bitcoin? 

Their business model is centered around mining bitcoin and selling it. Not on hoarding it and buying more. 
GS don't care what the price is. All they will care about is volume. They will make the same amount in fees whether 10k buys 1 bitcoin or 10.
Why would any institutional money want the price to skyrocket now? I believe a huge amount of institutional players have slowly been accumulating behind the scenes. Shit, thats what any rational person with a lot of money would do. Why would they want to accumulate at 10k/12k/16k/20k when they could simply keep quiet and buy at 7-9k from the scared money small fish? 


Big money is buying the coins little money is selling. The big boys can take on much more risk and have much more time. 



*Think about this*: the average fund is 5-7 years. That means they don't need BTC to go to 20k this year, they NEED BTC though, and they will get it from the small guys. 
How do you crash the price if you don't hold bitcoin?
If you think the deck is ever stacked against institutions with resources like GS has....
or go up above 9k 
Looking more like it and if the trend continues, $4k by late July is my prediction based off the 2015 trend
Barting inside a descending triangle seems to point that way. https://www.tradingview.com/x/4qmi4Q1j/
Thinking it will take a few days, absent of any bad news, of course.
Expecting a bounce fairly soon tbh then continuing a bit further down from there.
Bounce time. Then of course down below where we are right now at some point before long.
General consensus is that we bounce after the Consensus!
Rule 3
500* coin market buy...
Looks like a bear flag 
when I was actively holding, I started with a 90/10 rule. 

90% was in cold storage and I traded with the other 10%

and then any time the trading stack got above 30%, I would pull out 10% and put it in the main stack
70% margin 30% alt bags in cold storage that I barely count as stack anymore. Might soon go full retard on Bitmex.

Overnight trade hit:

!long XBTUSD 8200 4X 100%
Crypto is 100% BTC in heavy cold storage, i.e. it takes me more than 24 hours to access it

<5 BTC on Mex (now 0.75)

Never more than 50k in fiat on my bank account and the rest in traditional investments with acceptable liquidity, mostly bonds (don’t need more market risk with my Crypto protfolio)

If anyone wants to know how I do
cold storage:

I generate 48 word seeds, but I drop x words at random (sometimes x=1 sometimes more, sometimes I remember it/them, sometimes I don’t). Then I split those 48-x words across peeps in my life, so if I die they can work together to recover the seed and they all have a basic brute forcing script to find the missing words. (sometimes just one, sometimes more) I then store a scrambled copy of the seed at home that takes a few days to brute force and put an encrypted version of the 47 words in a safe located in the mountains not managed by myself, but by another party.
I have no cold storage. It may have been more important years ago when you couldn't trust *any* website but I'd stay there are at least a few that you can fully trust now. Plus wallets are safer than you'd think. It's mostly just a game of not telling people how much you have and being harder than the next guy to steal from.

With the rise of crypto and tons of morons coming into the space, it's pretty easy to not be the easiest target out there.

I have over 99% in bitcoin and almost all of that in my short. :)
95% in cold storage (90% BTC/BCH, 10% ETH) and 5% on exchanges in case I want to trade or hedge.
0% in Tether for sure.  And the allocation varies, but I try to keep as little as possible on exchanges to minimize counterparty risk.
What announcement? I'm not seeing anything yet on cryptopanic. 
That's not a bad strat, I wonder how it would work as an algo if backtested 
Looks like a bull div to me. 
Yep, on 4HR too :)
I'm expecting something similar although I'd be surprised if it dropped that low

Accumulation happened beneath the VWMA. Distribution and possible re-accumulation happened on the way back to it. This is my bottom.
hmm not sure if this is a good thing, since 2015 we havent even been close to touching it
Binance listing TUSD
~~Very interesting! Mass migration to TUSD (+32%) and USDT (+0.15%) could be the setup for a sick demand curve. A warning of things to come? Or whales just having a ball with the lack of Bittrex/Upbit stablecoin liquidity.~~

Edit: Coinmarketcap haven't included volume yet for Binance. Welcome to crypto, we pump tether coins
Overexcited buyers? Just seems moronic to pay that much for a coin redeemable for 1 USD. 

Edit: ~~Wait, is it actually supposed to be paired 1:1 to USD? Or supply/demand based and redeemable for current market value?~~ Yes it is. 

Edit2: Seems that its listed on Binance now, which makes all coins go apeshit. Source: https://cryptocoinspy.com/binance-listing-trueusd-tusd/
I did this yesterday at 8400 and made 0.25% on top of every scalp for about an hour. then went to bed with alarms. woke up in the middle of the night with alarms ringing but too tired to keep doing the scalping.

We should work on a bot that does this
Well we got a move, not sure how organic it was though...
H&S are typically reversal patters to happen after an upward trend. 
The neckline seems way to steep for a valid pattern.
What happened? I’m away from my computer having a shit.
what's going on? I'm on it just fine?
Are you still watching your 144 WMA + 5 SMA crosses Rich?  That Bart was a rejection on the 15min chart.
Opening a long here with a tight SL makes more sense than shorting imo. We could have very well established 8200 support. 
We shall see soon enough. Pennant reaching the apex. If this ends up being a descending triangle, longing the bounce from the support (or 8200) might be a good entry
Nice to see somebody else use GMMA... ;)
7.5 would be a better entry... The whole 8k range is shit.
You're generally looking at longer-term swing trades, yes? Days/weeks?

At 8300 we're sitting immediately below a downtrend resistance line that's held since the first big drop yesterday. Seems like entering just above that might be a better entry, no?

The only reason I agree with you is because the buy walls right below the current price are fat. Besides that, there's not much else to suggest it's similar imo
Rule 3.
7800

Just a feeling I don’t know shit about TA 
I voted 8600 even though I'm short. I don't think we'll make 7800. If it had been 7960 or 8600 I might have been inclined to say 7960. 
8600
More bullish results than expected.
Factor in the error source: sub's bull/bear bias (whichever way people think the bias goes)..
i vote for 3k

9k turned from support to resistance, but counting on 8k support simply due to the BGD

https://www.tradingview.com/x/eBZ6kGCO/
Honestly I have no idea and I just don't care. I use very low lev and lots of margin to keep my liqui very high. Will reinforce once it breaks down. Done with stop losses in ranges, it's shit.
First wedge has a more convincing support line for now.
That's was sniper precision :)
The last part is pretty shaky logic. Lots of people who are underwater are quick to close at breakeven or at any sign of real weakness. most shorts are not underwater and if they are it's a maximum of 3-4% underwater. 


I think the pumps have already done a more than good job. Combined with trader's confidence and the right timing, we could see something really big.

Yea few months ago I think 

e: this was in response to the main part of his comment that Jack Dorsey is a big advocate for Bitcoin. that hasn't been news for a while.

pls no downvote mi familia 
Another way to draw the various targets would be like this: https://www.tradingview.com/x/T4zKlhKX/

That sets a target around 7.1k for the 12H bear flag. But if we hit that level, I think we're more likely to test the ascending support line sitting around 6.9k.
Can you share with us what factors you base that assessment on? (Edit: Probably the worst question to get if you're about to log off, I know..)
We'll see...

!short xbtusd open 8380
[removed]
Good choice
He who gives life to the bottom controls the future.
No, I think we're gaining height to better smash through 8k
nope
well trust yr tingles you were damn close 
Sorry, what does BGD stand for? 
actually kinda. yas. 
Thought it was happening just now, but man...got pushed right back into the formation quickly
If it goes back down to 6,5k, it almost certainly wont hold. But before we get there, 7,7k or 7,4k might change the trend upwards again.
The test of that support line that held 6.5 is currently ~6.8-6.9.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/71rMRZ6M/

I am expecting it to either bounce off the support line or just above it (A), and break through the blue trendline to test the new potential long term resistance (B) and then either bust through it to a significant bullish breakout or drop through the support. At this point I'm leaning it will fall through support.  I wouldn't say we're "done" with the bear run if we break the orange line but we should at least retest 10k.
That's sounds a touch out there even by my standards
If that's the best you can do for a bull case, then I'm adding to my short right now.
8000 hasn't been tested yet, and we just dumped 10% in 15 hours. Give it a chance. 
Just following the descending channel, imo

https://www.tradingview.com/x/tE6IrtPa/
R/r is fine for long but keep in mind we are making lower lows and lower highs with respect to the recent sideways action for the past few weeks
agree, we haven't touch and breach 8k after all these actions
Make a lot of money?
> To put it differently, some entity is clearly having almost 100% control over the price because of the low volume a the moment. 

That's conspiracy talk. There are many whales but also many fish and it all adds up collectively to the market. 
>Volume increases dramatically in opposite direction as soon as the price moves up or down.

This is normal. Price always increase slowly after a sharp dump. Some big players could be trying to get out by dividing their dump into multiple attempt. This market behavior usually forms what we call bear flag. That's why most people usually don't trust low\-volume rising.
I wouldn't be surprised to see us Bart up to 8.6-8.7k it would fit well with those Bart patterns 
we hit a lower low during this raid of $8,100 instead of $8,300(and wiped out most of that wall holding the price up)...and with consensus wrapping up today, I think all signs point to a big move down to play today and tomorrow
I hope your right, got the nasty feeling we are gonna bart back up to 8400s
Top of the descending triangle 
It's a nice graph, but the range is too small. It's too easy to get chopped out right now.

That's a simple bullish divergence, no?
But is it really?  There are 3 lows on your chart. 
Between the 1st low and 2nd low, there is no divergence as there is a higher low in price and a higher low on rsi.
Between the 2nd low and 3rd low, there is no divergence as there is a lower low on price and a lower low on rsi.

You need to connect the 1st and 3rd low (and skip the second) to really see a divergence. 

I feel that this breaks rule 2 described [here](https://www.babypips.com/learn/forex/9-rules-for-trading-divergences)
Except the fact that we are below than 8,280...
This is the first thing I thought of when I saw the drop. Can't wait for an update to the chart in 12-24 hrs.

Asks what a bart is and your wish is granted.
Look at the chart now on the 1 min.
The thing we are being now. 
Exactly what's happening now to price.
Price stable then sudden random 100$ pumps/dumps.
You jinxed it ;)
Indeed. Feels like down to me with these crazy high wicks, but who knows. 
I have this feeling that Bart’s got shorter in the past couple of days and now it’s just quick spikes in price that’s just building pressure and suspense. 

I’m excited for the fireworks 

Geronimoooo 
Uh... when I read from left to right, I see that the right side is higher than the left which is kind of like... up.  But then I see you drew a red arrow pointing down based on some arbitrary spot.  What am I missing? What's important about that spot?  

Over time, both your charts point up when read simply from left to right.
Small trades have been my friend in this environment of sideways action Barts, pops drops. I have just hung on to every position even when it moved against me and everyone of them has cleared for profits in spite of a few errors. This last candle is so ugly but it cleared 5 small sells of longs I bought wrong so it is quite lovely from that perspective. I would say don't flip out if you get caught in a quick move against you, it will probably come back to you later same day, next day or two, until we make a longer term break out. 
That's my secret Captain... 

I'm always buying.
>Again I got the feeling it's time to start buying physical eth and btc instead of margin trading.

Absolutely, this is what i have been doing since losing on my last long @8.7k. Slowly buying small amounts during the dips.
And if you're really unsure about BTCs future, no one is stopping you from selling some with a profit at some point.
Feelings mutual
I have a conspiracy theory that all these Barts are from exchanges trying to screw over people margin trading and shorting.

"With all of the institutional news and cryptocurrency business being developed"

This line gets repeated over and over again, just because institutions MAY become involved in crypto, no one knows to what extent $ wise.  Whilst in addition, without masses of general public interest the way we are going is down, which is what we are seeing, and have seen for months now.

There is unwavering denial across this board, which seems to be slowing breaking down, your average person on the whole is not interested in crypto at this current point in time, that's a fact which is clearly visible on Google trends, social media activity etc, whilst not perfect it's a good barometer.

Weekly Higher Low target for me is still ~7200-7500.  There will be some chop along the way but it's looking like a pretty clear tightening weekly equilibrium pattern (higher lows and lower highs) that is targeted to break late summer to early fall.

HL in the low-mid 7000s with a lower high in the upper 8000s to lower 9000s and then some really boring sideways action in the 8000s for 2-4 weeks is my best guess.

I anticipate a bull break out of the pattern but there are no guarantees in life.
I am so happy how $8,100 held, forget about $8,000!!
I mean, don't get me wrong -- these guys have a high pain tolerance and WAAAY more money than smarts... but they will run out of coins.  Sorry. That's just how the math works out.  Fiat losers be like, "Imma buy a shitton of Buttcoin and sell it at a loss!" Bitcoin ballers be like, "Imma take yo money, fool."
The majority of people on here/traders on Twitter/telegram channels seem to wait for 7800, but we’ve learnt many times that the market doesn’t behave the way the majority expects it to.

Can this become a self fulfilling prophecy and can we have a decent bart up at that level? I have no idea but maybe someone has and is willing to share it with us
optimism is fine but we've heard this sort of talk over and over again. Oh it can't go below 10k, it can't go below 9k, it can't go below 8k etc. 

Sure it could hold in the 7800 region but even if it does short term, this is still a strong bear market. 

The odds are that we do continue to go down. That's the statistical likelihood based on the trend over multiple time frames.

For me all that matter now is that 6.5k region. Should we get back to that level it is absolutely paramount that we don't break below our previous lows. If we do then we can all kiss goodbye 10k by the end of the year because we will get an absolute fucking in the medium term.

>  To me, 7800 will be the absolute bottom. 

To the rest of us, the bottom will be how far the market drops.  And I don't know where that will be...could be $7K...could be $5K..could be $1K.    I am trading the current market, not trying to predict where it will be in weeks or months.

It all depends on the additional bad news that comes out of the USA and EU gov'ts.
mentioning you're a girl and drunk on a crypto sub...someone take this woman home and make sure her private keys are safe 

but seriously. we're generally all as clueless as you. this market is running virtually on 99.9% speculation right now

short, medium, and long term direction all look equally ambivalent 
The market is also drunk and doesn't know what's up or down. Expect a hangover before recovery, it might take some time. 
What do u think https://www.tradingview.com/x/CeaCvtHB
You are not real.  I refuse to believe it.
selling needs to stop and buying needs to start 
In layman's terms; there's more supply than demand at the current price in the crypto market, meaning more people willing to sell at these points then there are people willing to buy. To "recover" the crypto market basically has to motivate people to invest more money to outpace the selling pressure. This is partially innovation, media, and hype-driven, and we'll see upwards movement when the inflation of BTC will be outpaced by people wanted to take part in the market. 

What specifically needs to happen is difficult to say, because a lot of the recovery will probably accelerate as price goes up, so you'd probably want big market movers to increase prices so the general public becomes interested again.

Also, ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) hey there

> PS I’m drunk

TUI isn't a good idea.
> Can someone use layman’s terms to help me understand what’s happening?

people buy and sell more sell than buy price go down

> Just a regular crypto gal

omg it are a girl!111!!!

> I get the bart BS.

BS? rude. pls respekt bart

> What are we waiting to happen

there's no waiting, only suffering

> or what needs to happen to try having a shot at recovering?

recovery is out of ze question

> PS I’m drunk 😵

dont forget drink water, many water

> What are we waiting to happen or what needs to happen to try having a shot at recovering?

Patience. 

Everything on the chart tells me we're going up. I don't mean today or tomorrow or even this week necessarily, but within a month. In the shorter term, we need to get back inside our up-trend trading channel and cross the down-trend resistance line from 9950. We might take a dive into the 7-8k range first, though.
Post consensus dip was expected. Sell the news, some guys just got too impatient and sold the news early. I think a rally will come after consensus. Maybe it will take a while, maybe it will come quickly.

Today is the last day, i think the last talk is around 2.30 pm new york time.
today \(two words in google\)
Just missed the up writing a comment thinking it was going down. SMH. 
I still think it is going to drop below $8000 today despite the $150 jump 
Rule 3
If you’re using Kraken, yeah... you really need to
move to Finex or Mex
Got stopped out too at $8270. I’ve erased the last 2 weeks of gains 

Looking to open another short possibly, still think we are going down and this is just a weak bart 
When using Kraken you’ve got to factor in some illiquidity problems. You can also turn it to your advantage :)

What I like about Kraken is their use of real fiat and not this USDT crap that Tether and Bitfinex is driving. I’m sure it’s real dollars, but I just sleep better at night knowing it’s truly real cash backing Kraken’s operation.

But then again... What’s really “real” with anything crypto? Hah. It’s The Wild West either way I guess...
Well Mex got to 8490ish. I didn't got stopped out by like $20.

safe: do nothing until it starts trending, its not connected to a price
What if I tell you: There is no safe strategy with these random Barts.?
Short above 9000 long below 8100
Not sure about shorting but if we push above 8650 we will have a break out, so I’d wait for 8750-8800 or even a bit higher to confirm that we are out of the descending wedge
And you were correct
doubt it tbh
Ok thanks , going long.
Dead Bart Bounce. Its been strangled by Homer to a point its upside down.
I wouldn't of thought so, that was a fair bit of near horizontal trading first.

I shorted it...was not a tough call although can spike again upwards or downwards...who knows.
Seems like a pretty good trading plan, I expect a lot more resistance in the upper 8.4's to 8.5. It'll be interesting to see the hourly close. 
consensus is ending today

perfect reason to dump 
It does when the market direction is controlled by a few people.

It looks like we will only see a breakout when it's least expected, that seems to be the only pattern here. 

TA works up to a point as it doesn't take market manipulation in to account.
90% of the pumps/dumps in the last 2 months have happened on no news at all, while news like regulated trading on the NASDAQ engine has zero impact.

BTC will continue like this while it is below 10k. Above there you might see more retail investors taking interest again, which will smooth out the current action.

Those stats are, for the most part, noise.

Its been full of sneaky bull traps all along.. and people are falling in for yet again, and again. lol
Or maybe, just maybe the whole damn thing has been one big bear trap since the word "go." See genesis block.
It does appear that way.

Rejected, for now. 
Shorter wick than @ 15:30 on BFX, longer wick on Bitstamp. Dunno if that means anything.
Kraken just wicked to 8500... had a profit taking at 8480. Closed 50% of my position letting the rest ride.

Let’s get it 
The market seems to be in a slow bleed mode, I’d wait for at least one more leg down

Edit: spelling 
> Why bother betting against it when it just keeps happening? 

Because those who "bet against it" just made sick profits the last several days.
I wish you would stop blaming all negative price action on The Manipulator™ and realize complex, composite market forces are at play.

For a laugh, look up "The Manipulator™" as people have been complaining about "him" for years. (Pro tip: "he" doesn't exist.)
In what right mind would you not doubt yourself when playing in such a volatile market?
You act like your trades haven't burned you before.

We need to get this out of the equations, it sounds dumb to be honest every time someone says this. I've done it too a couple times, done with it now however.

Good luck, man. Have made some mistakes today too. I correctly called the big green candle on April 14, but yesterday I mistakenly thought we would see another bart, so I went long. Then BTC dropped catastrophically and my stop kicked in while I was sleeping. Today, I correctly called the green candle and was 100% long when it happened. I saw that it hit resistance at 8400 and failed to break through, but didn't realize the significant risk of a drop because of that. When the red candle appeared I got out some way down, and would have done an OK trade, if I hadn't been stuck in alt-coins. I had decided to move the funds to stellar, which tends to have a bounce right after a bitcoin bounce but with twice the magnitude percentagewise. I was stuck in stellar and had to go through binance coin to convert to USD. Binance coin dropped very fast, and all the gains from the trade were nullified. Overall, the three trades seen together, I am down about 3-4%, and it sucks. I should submit the last trades to the bot, but I need to get my thoughts off trading for some time.
!long btcusd 8195 1x 100%

Not giving up hope that we can maintain 8000. I really don’t understand the bearish sentiment these days. So much positive news about bitcoin and institutional investors getting interested this year.    Setting loose stops on this one if it goes below 8k.  
Ahh this post confused me for so long until I remembered that Americans write day and month the wrong way round 
Someone with fat fingers has acces to the internet limited on 2/5 and 4/5 ?

You can try to use Bittrex. It is not as good as Tradingview but still not bad :\)
Chart BFX, Bitstamp, Kraken, GDAX. I mean, the numbers will be slightly different, but you can have 4 different charts going then. TA is not generally about a hard and fast number, but rather a range. 

I wouldn't chart BitMEX though. 
If you are a serious trader, then TradingView is well worth it, but I realize it depends on your budget.  I hesitated to sign up for a Pro subscription, but of course it was worth it, many times over.  
You can work on and save multiple charts without signing up for a subscription. I think the difference with the subscription is that you can have multiple charts open at the same time (split screen layout). But I just keep all mine in my watch list and click back and forth between them.
To see each exchange, on a single chart you can click the "compare" button and add multiple exchanges to the one chart. It then defaults to percentage on the scale, but you can right-click that to change it back to dollars.
I personally am using the old one, is more practical. The new one is prettier but i prefer functionality.
I see the ticker on mobile.

Logged in on a laptop after months on mobile. pleasantly surprised, but I prefer mobile
It's not possible as of yet. No custom stylesheets supported (as of now) although the option is greyed out so it may be possible in the future.
I confess, they got me on my small short. But as revenge i re-shorted from the same entry with double the amount. 

So expecting a BGD with the same direction of the fake out since every one is expecting price to drop now.

Rule 3
>8200 holds  again for this week this might turn to be the next one

there will be plenty more chances than, why grab the first chance and might get rekt if we fall through.
[deleted]
I think the touches are to instill confidence to have people think they’re buying a support, which will be sold into. Of course anything can happen but everything about today somehow feels bearish to me. 

Also someone pointed out earlier the barting is to create more liquidity in the market to sel into. Don’t know if true, but it’s something I’m keeping an eye on. 
lol realized I broke the rules. Nevermind. But be nice. Wishing a liquidation on someone is utterly unnecessary. 
Haters gonna hate. The problem with your reasoning, is that everyone is praying that others, normies, whales, institutions etc. buy to kickstart it but nobody wants to do it at the risk of bagholding.

So for now, you can continue to light candles but I'm not sure it will help.

Ever think someone cancelled the order to
market buy?

I have no idea anyways, just playing the contrarian fiddle
Wow order book is clear again.  Would only take less than a couple hundred BTC of market orders to shift the price enough to break out of this formation in either direction and get something kick started.  From what we've seen before this could easily happen even from a single order.

Lol, this is the meme that keeps on giving.
nope, just no new money entering the market.
suppression would look different, you'd have a 7000 BTC sell wall pushing the price down. instead you had a 7000 BTC buy wall propping the price up at $8000

if anything its the opposite of suppression 
Why all the downvoting? It was an honest question with no intention at all.
Some people here are completely psycho
thats binances cold storage
You mean all those other coins that actually go up in value?
Most traders know they can't possibly realize this until spring is over. Speaking in certainties about the future is a fools game.

there was a ton of support at $8000

almost 7500 BTC worth of buy orders. That's now down to 2800BTC. 

Give it time, it takes a lot of effort to get through this support point 
Rule 3

Edit: just noticed this is your second warning. 1 day in the sin bin.
so you ignore the fact that the long term
log trend line from 2011/2012 puts us at 5500?
LOL or the last time you predicted ultimate doom for bitcoin and were completely wrong which was probably.....just days ago? EDIT: There is no barrier to entry for constantly making ridiculous calls and no punitive aspect for being constantly wrong so....carry on I guess.
Uh... no. 2014 was much worse, and, by the way, if you were accumulating steadily throughout that period with money you didn't immediately need, you made out like a bandit. Time is money.

I'm underwater on my long from 8500. Holding it because it's small compared to my hodlings. Pretty sure we head upward pretty soon because this douchebag market selling these large blocks will eventually run out of coins. Might take a couple weeks or it might happen soon. But to compare this market to 2014 is pure silliness. 
“Bitcoin as we know it could soon be over” is an ignorant and sensationalist statement. Basically FUD spread by an idiot behind a desk with the sole intention of generating media hype. Bitcoin has a good track record of compliance with federal regulation. It is already listed on two major US futures exchanges, on top of NYSE and NASDAQ displaying interest in listing it, along with a basket of other cryptos. 

The article mentions anonymity as one of the issues, which contradicts the very first sentence. Bitcoin is not anonymous.

Anyone capable of critical thinking can see right through the BS sensationalism in this article. Increased regulation has been an ongoing topic for several months now. I’m personally unfazed by it. It’s nothing new to anyone who’s invested in crypto or has done minimal research on the topic.

TLDR; They have nothing to talk about, so they re-hash and re-spin information that has already been tirelessly been reported in an attempt to either fulfill their agenda, generate ad revenue, or both.
Ridiculous. Who's f-ing business is it what we do with our crypto when the same thing can be done with fiat. Also grandpa NY, who wouldn't allow UFC in NY for years because it's too violent, allowed Gemini to list a privacy coin out of all coins. I'm not buying this FUD article. It's just to create headlines during Consensus.
They will make it illegal to accept Bitcoin for any good or service without doing full AML/KYC.   You won't be able to buy from overstock or gyft.com or anywhere else using crypto, without giving them your SS# and DL.   

It won't exactly be great for adoption.  
It stopped on the resistance from the descending triangle. So far it is behaving like expected.
Rule 3
Once the horizontal volume has died down (or about 6h has passed), open both a short and a long position with fairly tight stops. Look at the recent wicks for guidance.

Take profits as soon as the move comes and repeat.
If you can do profitable risk management while choosing the direction with a coin flip, you might be able to survive barts.
I have been testing a strategy based on fibonacci, EMA and pivot reversals. 

Got in at 8205 about 30 minutes before the pump earlier :)
C'mon now bro.
Rule 3
[removed]
Rule 3
Firstly, don't put real money in systems you don't fully understand.

Secondly, you earn interest by opening a position on the side that receives funding. This info is displayed in the box in the lower left hand corner.

Thirdly, this is a terrible strategy for making money. Don't focus on this strategy if you're trying to make money. Much better off loaning the money to margin traders on BFX or something.
You said Bitcoin would go parabolic when the price was around 9800 dollar. Why is selling at 9800 , 9300 or 8800 wasting money ? maybe for permabulls like you...  it's still better than selling at 7800 and below.
Rule 3
[removed]
Rule 3
If everyone is expecting $7,800, I wonder if it will actually happen. I can't help but think that whoever is dumping *wants* us to think we're heading right to $7,800. I could very well be overthinking it though.
I'd probably exit at around $7,833 or something.
probably close it and wait to reshort.
My confidence level is low, so my stops are quite tight. 

I'd rather get bounced out prematurely than get stuck losing more than I'm comfortable.

A marge would have a ratio of 1:3 width to height.

Its really, really tiring this entire trading market...I guess that tells us we are still bear, as there is no new money coming in at 10k + so they might as well liquidate as many people as they can.

This. We were in a bull market the last 2 times in 2016 and 2017. No surprise that the Consensus has more effect in a bull market versus a bear market, in which it seems to have had little to no effect.
It's been dubbed Bart Simpson in legacy markets [as early as 2013](http://www.businessinsider.com/dave-lutz-stock-market-bart-simpson-formation-2013-7?). Not sure if David Lutz was the first but the pattern and term have definitely been around for quite some time.

The pattern is much more pronounced and more frequent in cryptomarkets; I guess the lack of liquidity and regulation are the main reasons they're so prevalent. There's been a massive rise in the frequency of the pattern in Bitcoin since March and it's really something to be cautious about, especially when trading on margin. 

I agree it's mostly due to market manipulation and meming is just a (or our?) coping mechanism since there's not much we can do about it.
Seen it on 4chan first.
The origin is a video by Bizonacci on YouTube afaik (BTC Bitcoin Simpsonian Analysis March 28 - Is a Lisa Retracement Imminent?)
no definitely not lol, I wasn't even  the first one here to say it
My coins feel like raffle tickets at the moment.
There's zero luck involved.  Trade with a small amount of money.  Buy and hold with a slightly larger amount of money.  If you're a good trader, you come out a little bit ahead on the trades, and over time you almost definitely come out ahead on the buys.
OTC doesn't have infinite supply 
i can't imagine the miners being happy with bitcoin at 8400. So if this theory is true, then Bitcoin will eventually die and tons of people lose money and industry is dead
All these detailed, elaborate theories about how the price isn't going to keep going down and it will instead go up somehow and you will get to buy your lambo's.

Oh well, whatever gets you through the day..
hey could you link me to that source? I followed GS predictions but havent heard any recent ones  
GS has been overtly negative at times while simultaneously Makin major moves into the space. They know they are soon going to be jockeying for position with everyone else. 
> Circle is just creating a digital version of the USD, pegged, which will also eliminate volatility

Why the hell would it do that? It's just another proxy dollar. 
Lmao so true 
Why is GDAX losing traders?
The problem there is the algos are so aggressive that there's literally 0 liquidity when you need it. Price goes up $5 on Bitfinex and there's 50 BTC on the best bid, and a combined 0.06 BTC on the ask side for $20 up (and vice versa). Unless you're playing with lunch money, you need a very polished crystal ball to get a decent fill (on the last small dump before a big pump, for example).
Normies left the building long ago 
good point
I've just gone ahead and deleted all of the diagonals I was trying to force onto this bear flag thing.  It's 8450 and 8100, or horizontal to the next diagonal resistance, fuck everything else.  Not even going to try to say the next big diagonal resistance is part of a downward channel or descending wedge, just to expect a move before we get there to get out of this horizontal range.
it needs to hold multiple Barts
I 3 am out 
at this point i dont even know whats going on, you'd think if they just want their shorts filled they would let it climb up a bit and fill their asks..this just seems like they're trying to kill any hope before it takes off 
I did the same.

Although I’m still down from the BGD so no gloating here.
I mean crypto in general of course. I think Bitcoin and crypto and blockchain is here to stay but Bitcoin will continue losing market share. And we will see more adoption. How many people own some Bitcoin or crypto right now? Like 100 million worldwide? Even that seems too high but it’s barely more than 1% of the population.
*clinks glasses*
That's a great place to be.
About 1% give or take. We've got a cluster of converging lines right above us, and if we break through all of them, we'll probably keep going. 8400-8500 is traditionally a high volume node/horizontal resistance range. Getting through that would signify the market (or Bart "Deep Pockets" Whale) wants more green. 
Yea lol exactly , looking at charts and drawing lines !
Underrated
Dont see them getting pulled, bc we have tested them a few times and they were standing all the time since the 12th of May. Hope im wrong though..
> The 1000 BTC wall on $8200 did absolutely nothing.

what do you mean it did nothing? it prevented the price from falling much further, no?
Tight stops, man. But yes, eventually there will be a rektoning. 
I market closed the short, but set a limit buy (post only) 0.5% above the resistance line immediately after setting a market stop 0.5% above that. I caught the second wick over 8400. If I'd market sold without taking the time to set up the stop, I probably could have got 8430. June wicked to 8445.
Yeah, have to backslash them to make them stick.
You missed my last update post probably :\)

It's an app called Pushed. You install it and search for Position Bot. Once subscribed you get a notification anytime a "special user" changes his positions. This needs an upgrade to increase the list \(so far just you and MikeXBT are on it\) based on a poll or try to create individual subscriptions by user so each user can choose the users they want to be notified of.

So far is working well and pretty fast receiving the notifications.
Its a bot to track the open positions for the BitCoinMarkets users. It has a site where you can check all the positions (open and closed).
true, but then you risk a competitor coming in and buying before you do, ruining the liquidity you worked so hard to create.
Yeah, I guess I'm just interested because if it keeps following, we should steady creep up for a few months, take a little dive, and then start accelerating up again
HODL mode is position. This is getting scary for me 
That was me getting out. I'm out of the market except for a small long position on September futures down from 8260.
I'm not American & my account is not registered in the US (Term limit only applies to US accounts). 

It was open over 28 days. 

I've had & continue to have positions open >6months plus on Kraken.  
I'm not sure but cnledger is reliable

the whole thing seems like a joke though and for some reason I feel more comfortable not being #1 on that list
MtGox was the dominant exchange when it went under. All the China ban stuff... so many fundamental reasons why it's not the same thing. From the perspective of technicals, I don't think it's similar either. Getting people to read the history of that period is difficult, though.

i don't really do TA, but i'm sure someone who does can check this out for you. I am just shocked at the many attempts to get it under 8200 have failed thus far. 
A long squeeze though
I can't remember exactly, but I think that Battlestar Galactica Green Dildo was something like 20-30% short squeeze. The rest was prolly just "this is the bottom" after a long period of sideways accumulation plus a FOMO run.


So for today it’s more like digital hold... amirite
This is what I don't get... why short after several days of dumps and indicators pointing to oversold on a lot of timeframes?
it’s called grapefruit, with a slinky lebanese core
nice
Agreed. I’m just scalping here and there with like 10k contracts hoping not to get caught with my pants down
Bart made me do it
He was banned for a lot more than what seems to be getting communicated to you. If the community wants a full report and /u/DushmanKush agrees to it then I'll share our reasons.

Checking his post history... Looks like not a lot has changed.

Ban evasion alone is a violation of Reddit's TOS.
Yeah, I spoke to him.

Doing my best to get him back
Wrap it up guys. /u/mandy7 just won the internet.
that's why we have BGDs
Ugh, it got caught. Well, guess I'll keep the trade. Was considering exiting immediately, gut thinks this is going to pop up though.

Edit: Thanks trading bot for keeping me from getting cold feet. Going to hold a bit longer to see if this is just daily close shenanigans or actually going to bounce up a bit here. Very short term though - liable to move back to fiat if this doesn't pop soon. BBands being stretched a bit, we'll see if it's a fakeout again.
10 points for Gryffindor. You’re a wizard harry! 

Thanks for the laugh, I now have the entire public library staring at me as I just laughed out loud 15x too loud 
At the local library preparing a speech and this came shooting out of my brain. 

For some reason i put falling wedge when I meant to put ascending triangle, but symmetrical would fit just groovy too. 
If a cock slap to my eye will prevent me from staring at the charts all day, bring on the meat sword. 
I never saw this happening in 2017 either.

I do remember having the feeling of seeing many good news and the price not moving like during the whole summer (due to the BCH fork) but never this erratic behaviour.

It's madness
BTC is so new and cool it even pains new patterns this it the future of money

Isn't it just that bitcoin is behaving more like a normal stock after it became possible to short and trade in futures? I don't know, but I read some other comments to that effect, I think yesterday on this sub.
I entered the market in late 2016 and I don't remember this in 2017, there was manipulation and whales, but this is different, it's hard to explain, and its not just the barting, the lack of volume, the slow bleeding down instead of the 30-40% dips that were over in 10 days-2 weeks max etc.

There doesn't seem to be any confidence at all.
Have you notice the big up and down vertical spikes in the last 3-4 weeks?

Someone here named them barts, since they look like Bart's head, spike up, sideways consolidation and in a few hours-days, spike down, completely vertical.

That had never happened before, and it makes trading a gamble basically, cause they make no sense whatsoever. Big manipulation going on
I would love it if there was an entry in stockcharts.com's ChartSchool about this.  Satire or serious.
Required reading:

https://themerkle.com/what-is-the-bart-pattern/
Big green dildo/big red dildo. Basically when a huge candle spikes up/down in a short period of time, seemingly out of no where.
Price jumping up or down over a very short period of time. Seen a few this morning in both directions, the sides of the bart formations. For a real example though, look back to mid April at the short squeeze from $6800 to $8000 over the course of a few minutes. That type of dildo is reserved for a special lady (or man).
Not a trader but LTH, been buying ad-hoc of late to me this feels like when I bought after the rally from 1200 to 200 (and where bitcoin was flatlined for months on end), I knew it would hit 1200 again so it was a no-brainer, just as I see it hitting 20k again.
The span between $200 and $300 was miserable. 

The emotional roller coaster basically went like this:

Price at $200: "Fuck, fuck fuck. We're all fucked. This is dropping to $100 any second now."

Price at $220: "We're all doomed any minute now."

Price at $240: "Holy shit guys, we're actually doing it! Maybe?"

Price at $270: "Wahoo! We did it. $1000 any minute now. What color lambo should I buy?"

Price at $299: "THIS IS GENTLEMAN!"

Price at $270: "Everything is fine. Just need to consolidate for a bit before the market makes the final push past $300."

Price at $240: "Fuck, fuck, fuck."

Price at $220: "Just get this over with. What's the suicide hotline number again?"

Price at $200: "Who else sold everything?"

And repeat that process 3 fucking times.

Worst range I've ever had the displeasure of trading. 
when parabolic moves collapse i think that's what tends to happen.  Death by boredom.  It gives time for bargain hunters to come back and take long term positions. 
The problem with a long multi year outlook on cryptos is that we get a much higher odd of running into a global economy downtrend. No one knows how well crypto will fair in such an environment. 
but not *too* long of a timescale
we bounced off $6500 and then set a lower high at $9800. Why would you think the max possible move down from here is limited to a max of 15% move? 


> Can't think of a single reason why it would continue downwards.

Not even *one*? C'mon, get creative...quantum computer steals everyone's coins? Aliens attack Bitfinex HQ? Satoshi rises from the dead and dumps coins, setting a price ceiling under $1K?

Or, you know, the more mundane reasons like bubble popping, supply continuing to overwhelm demand, profit taking turning into panic, etc.
There's quite a few lately popping up. You can scroll down and see like 4 in the past 10 top comments. 

But I think it's more interesting that sentiment seems to reset so quickly and people settle for lower lows as long as it's not the *lowest* low recently. 

Like we could drop go $6k and if we bounced to $7k and went sideways for a week ppl would start calculating at what price they can buy a Lambo at
Yeah probably just recency and confirmation bias...
>Gee, I wonder what will happen when this dead cat bounce runs out of steam and the dumping resumes



The sentiment of the sub will change quickly like always. Calls for 3k, comparisons to 2014 again, comments about manipulation, and of course people saying it's because of Mt. Gox.


And then we'll have a $100 bounce and sentiment will change again with calls for 10k, talk of new ath by year's end, and so on.



It's honestly fun to watch.
it's amazing how quickly some change their minds from sideways movement....we go to $8100 and people start saying farewell and 12h later we're at $8375 and people pull out the monthly charts with targets for $13k lol

Also what buy walls were removed?? I still see 4400 to $7800. 

if you're looking at cryptowatch it's bugged I think, Bitfinex.com shows more btc on the walls 
Speak for yourself 😎 
I agree but since I'm trading exclusively on Mex, I've slowly adjusted to having a short bias. If it goes up, so does the value of my coins, so a short bias seems like a good hedge.

That said I'm long right now so *shrug. 
Haha, that's an excellent pacman-like chart.
If this turns out to be right, I will buy you a gold medal
Most everyone "knows" it is going lower now, so it's going to be more difficult than usual to pump it higher for another DCB.   There is just too much overhead resistance from shorters/sellers.
I actually know why, not sure why I said I dont .

But on that note, waiting it out a bit 
I’m waiting to see how the triangle plays out. I’ve nearly erased the past 2 weeks of bad trades with my 2 recent trades and not willing to risk my gains just yet 
Could be premature to draw, but it’s definitely something to keep an eye out on
aaaaand it's gone
Agree. Looks like 400 has some resistance. 
i have been bullish all this time but even i am worried right now , with all those bullish news yet the price drops like crazy 
all it takes is some FUD and we are fckd
Eat my shorts!
Well I can say I'm a buyer there for sure. 
If only someone in this sub said the fair price of Bitcoin was 7500 when we were knocking on the door of 10k

I heard he’s a hero, a true pioneer of the tech, with a huge giggle stick.

Wish I knew who he was
Exactly. This is how big decisions get made, and it is proof that a lot big money is looking to get off of the sidelines. 
I think when we were around 6.5 they were trading at near -100? For a very short amount of time. I can’t recall though. 
That’s why overtrading combined with overleveraged positions sucks. Well, just lost a bit compared to the past 2 weeks gains. Will stay out of position for a while although i am itchy for a revenge trade (kinda feel like need to short again)
What happens, if, by a 1% chance, it activates my stop, but not my liq. mark price, and then comes down like a hammer?
$19K.
the recent BGDs look dramatic on the charts but have been pretty weak to be honest. If I were to short this uncertain market right now I would just put higher stops
The Black Bear can be found with black, brown, gray, silvery-blue and cream fur coats!
If you can't nurse your position manually don't get dragged in alts, Bitcoin is especially bitchy these days, every move is a gamble.

Arbitrage bots. 
presenting at consensus days
yes
That’s a good point, but I think given the sell pressure these past few days the bulls might have a slightly upper hand in the battle.
Well it's more like a continuation of downward trend that we've had since January... 
Same shit I was doing before.
Shit didn't realize that... thanks. 
Really? This is the price action right before the drop to 7.2K and 6K shortly after: https://www.tradingview.com/x/OhF2PFPA/
I reshorted after getting stopped earlier and didn't have the heart to reshort again, was feeling too emotional. Of course now I watch it break below and I just have to deal with it
He's just about the only game in town at this point and hasn't directly stolen money like Bitfinex and some other exchanges have.  But it's sad that it's the best out there. 
>  I don’t care anymore

That's always great advertising for any investment...complete indifference and resignation.
I thought they kept a bit
To confirm: You've witnessed someone exit to the degree of never holding* crypto again?
ill take that as a complement.

Tbh, these posts are more for me than anyone else. Putting my thoughts into words so I can track what I was thinking and theres no point lying cos id only be lying to mesen lol

i couldve fake closed my position at decent profit but what would be the point in that?
[deleted]
Why not both?
I think so too, especially if this falling wedge breaks upwards with some conviction.  Could be the "butterfly that flaps it's wings" to set things in motion.  Otherwise, I fully expected us to be on our way to revisiting the bottom of that large triangle.
It's more of an up for interpretation type of thing imo. It depends on how you view that middle dip - was it just FOMO/volatility/liquidity issues (given how quickly it was bought right back up) or true market movement?

However, there is confluence with that divergence on OBV - showing that despite making a lower low, the buying volume has generally been picking up.

But consider all that while keeping in mind that zoomed out even a little bit the recent movement looks like chop and looking for divergence within chop is mostly frowned upon and at best generates weaker signals. Still, even after lowering the weight you put on it to account for chop and that second dip, that big of a divergence is something to definitely consider when making your trades.

Personally it's not making me buy in just yet given the huge number of fakeouts to the upside, but I'm watching closely and going to try to get in somewhat early on any sustained move up.
Rule 2 is a bit arbitrary though because you can ignore certain lows/highs but they have to be successive. How to determine which should be taken into account and which shouldn't? Also would you perchance have a chart to look at? The sentences are beyond my brains mental gymnastic capacity.  
Sentiment is virtually equally split actually. the straw poll shows 62 votes for $7800 first and 60 votes for $8600 

70-69 now 

the other 20-40 people said they have no idea lmao 

poll for anyone who didn't vote yet:

https://strawpoll.me/15711477
I don't think it's similar at all. A major difference is that shorts were at an all time high back then and now they're far from it.
Of course there are these greedy players from banks, hedge fonds etc. \(those people we do not want to have in this space\) after this insane rally in 2017, but this will not mean the Bitcoin as is will make it. 
so you're telling me if all these guys just spent that $25m on some bitcoin we could've cleared the books to $10k?  

s.m.h.

I'm under the impression that the vast majority of institutional money was waiting for regulatory guidance last year before entering the market. I'm also under the impression that because of this, many clients were very pissed that their financial advisers weren't able to take a position one way or the other, so they not only missed the opportunity to long the rise to $20K, they missed the opportunity to short the breakdown. they won't miss the next run, their clients demand it.
It's the 0.681 fib retracement.
I was just looking at the same on the daily

https://imgur.com/a/5xUP5qE
True but i think maybe people will treat this as a sell the news event, especially with ether which will drag us down more
Ja but Id say that was cus TA
actually im very bearish if you look at my other posts today, especially on ethtrader. just think its very difficult to make a call right now, because we are at weekly support
the problem is demagogues don't pander to people who read books on how to spot a demagogue.  Haha.

im prettty sure anyone in this forum is prettttty over ‘politics’... i enjoyed the read. more of a breakdown of a philosophy on the social forces guiding what’s going on now in America. not a current events book which I found very refreshing 
Agree with you there, years like 2017 are pretty rare.
fair point, but what % of the daily bitcoin that gets mined do you think is sold on the open market each day?

edit: also, do you think that % is constant, or may change based on circumstances?
OPEC comes to mind, though of course miners aren't the only sellers.
Though this is obviously true, they have an invested interest in keeping the price above a certain price point to compensate for the infrastructure investment + increasing variable costs of mining.

~~Same goes for exchanges who generate income on a price basis from transactions, who's income decreases in step with a price decrease.~~ 

I also thought reading somewhere that actually a lot of institutional investment is more interested in these ventures that comprise the ecosystem rather than partaking in the markets themselves. So if these investments become less lucrative, then it would be in a common interest to uphold the price above a certain price point at which their operations are still profitable to the extent of a good opportunity cost return. 
this was my thinking as well. 
yep that makes sense
good comment, and that is my belief as well
I believe that most people selling here are hoping to get in at lower prices.  I don’t think much money is truly leaving the market anymore.  The truly week hands are long gone.  Now It’s just a bunch of guys ages 20-40 trying to buy at the lowest price possible.  Just my opinion.  
you borrow it, and then sell it. 
you can’t... or at least not without massive amounts of market risk
You short - with your huge cash reserves.
Long term log trend line (Stamp 2011/2012-now) says we don’t go below 5500
Who is selling to 5k that hasn't already sold? 
Awesome, just as I thought. Looking forward to 4k!
I always said 3800 dollar around summer so your prediction sounds right.
Yeah but descending triangles break up now ;)

Edit: this could still turn into an ascending triangle too actually.  That would flip our bart interpretations.
What do you think is the reason for such a huge market buy sloppy? Is it a try to ignite FOMO? Is it stop hunting? Is it a try to clear the sell side of the order books for an easier later push upwards? Or just a fat finger? 
yup and starting to break down edit: support holding for now
I really like your approach. I might do the same but 80/10. Feeling a bit too brave.
How would a loner with no friends or family devise an elaborate cold storage solution like this?
Ok I don't agree with a lot that you have to say, but your cold storage solution is admirable, even though I don't totally understand it. I'm trying to figure out a system for my relatives when I bite the dust, but haven't figure it out yet, which is dumb because I could kick it any day (like I guess we all can).

Your system is too elaborate for me, but need to figure out something.  But why do you have someone else in charge of the safe in the mountains?   And why does it matter that it is in the mountains?  I could see burying it up there, but sitting in a safe could be anywhere.  But perhaps the remote location makes it less likely to be discovered and compromised.

Anyway good job with all that.  You are a better man than me to figure all that out and implement that solution.


living dangerously stupid if you ask me.

If your short is hardcore in the green, any normal human being would leverage up to 100x and withdraw margin.

But you strike me as the type of person who has no issue living with unimaginable risks
What are the trusted websites now? Coinbase, kraken, binance, gemini?

It honestly has been working like a charm. I've been tracking the same thing on Binance specifically. With this bear flag trending downwards, I guess it's time to test this theory again!
Ta.

I'm toying with a long from 8300 with tight stops and a limit sell around 8450/8500.

A bounce here could provide some relief before another leg down.
Pretty sure at $7800, we will see some strong bounce, though I'm not sure that will be THE bottom.

This is my idea:

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/cNdgZZOq-11788-double-top-crash-VS-9990-crash/
And who whould buy a 1$ worth coin, for 1.30$ ? I assume they are aware that, by design, this coin should never be more or less than 1$?
I noticed that this time around, Binance is both giving advance notice and explaining that this is a stablecoin, yet I'm sure that there will still end up being people complaining about bagholding after buying TUSD at like $1.50.
Alright i was wrong. Only 3 hours until the bart.
Yeah, at least one hour earlier than i expected, however not slightest bit organic. 
Haven't we been on an upwards trend since the 6500 bottom though? 
litterally unusalbe.
yes always watching! It clearly rejected.. funny how that happens really
Longing in the 8300’s right now is a little scary, Ide rather wait until a touch around 8200 again 
A descending triangle carries an inherent bearish bias. 

You'd want to short the top of the formation, not long the bottom.
Descending triangles are bearish continuation patterns. 

If this is in fact a descending triangle I wouldn't long at support. I think shorting would make more sense. (or least waiting for a confirmation of breakdown) 
I actually wanted to close my current long since last night to have a better entry, missed the opportunity yesterday and didn't really got the chance today. 

IMO $8,100 - $8,300 is a good entry for the time being. 
This is not good for The Simpsons legacy.

The circles are fractals within the wedges and similar market conditions.... 4hr bull div kicks the whole thing off. 

If there's one thing I learned is that buy walls don't mean shit. They move down with the price most of the time. On the other hand sell walls can give you a good estimate of where the resistance is strong. Exception: Sell walls close to the current price can move away quickly though and mean nothing either.

$200 more on your short or $400 on a long? 
I almost wanted to clarify this...If you think sub $8k you should vote $7800. 

I should have just put <$7999

edit: nvm.. Just vote according to what the poll asks.. $7800 or $8600 
Well that's what I'm trying to see! 
[deleted]
I agree regarding break-even, but my assertion is that the average long is underwater from 9200+, so they are going to hodl strong until that point. 
hahah I just sprayed beer out of my nose due to your edit. thanks. 
simón


wow the article is 3 hours old and it was discussed a few months ago
The overall downtrend / bear market and also the 4 hr chart and most other time frames.   

As I said, it's probably more likely this will bounce to 8400 than drop to 8000 first, but it's much more likely to drop $1000 from here than move up $1000.   So I'm staying short for now.
Bon Chance good sir!
Not a major fan of the extremely slow creep up. But I’ll take this price action 
We’ve been floating above the support floor for a while, tapping the resistance ceiling a good bit. I believe that’s a pretty decent sign unless someone unloads a giant stack 
Big Green Dildo, giant green candle 
I agree. Another 6.5k revisit would almost certain spell a break down. I just cannot see another bounce from there.

Real question is how low we go if we break. I'd like to see a break of 6.5k and a super hard drop followed by an almighty bounce.

The biggest worry for me is the slow bleed fall because if that happens, this bear market could be lasting until the autumn! 
Please. Knock yourself out.
You take any profits? Or you setting stops at break even 
I'm not agreeing or disagreeing but at what point does a price become lower low, higher low, etc? I hear people calling $7800 and saying it's still bullish because it's a higher low. Is it the channel or time frame? 
That's their goal, not their strategy. If you had almost 100% control over the price, how would you squeeze the most out of it, money-wise?
I think the fish are slowly giving up tbh.
>Price always increase slowly after a sharp dump

Not what I'm talking about... I'm talking about very sharp spikes. Almost only visible if you look at 1m or 5m candles, including wicks.
Won't be opening a short below 8500 just in case more shenanigans.
Was enough holding a short 3 days underwater from here. 
You were right, here comes the Bart
Super low volume bleed up. I'm unconvinced. Still, ready to bail on my short at b/e if this goes nuclear. 
Where do you see the neckline?

I can only see higher lows since the bounce from $8,100.
We're coming up on 24 hours without breaking that resistance line (with some buffer for wicks). As long as you play with low leverage, a stop $100 above entry is pretty decent. 
There's dozens of those daily nowadays. 
Can you breakdown the #s for me on this? I see these but am so amateur I don’t ever know how much actual money was lost 
[removed]
Yeah is a classic bullish divergence. Though I agree with /u/danceswithpizzaz I'm not sure if it's something to rely on in the current conditions. 
Yeah I stand corrected, skipping the 2nd low breaks the rule. The divergence is still there though, perhaps not as strong:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/ohPwWFnV/

Don't you agree?
50 bucks here or there

Username does NOT check out
You might just have to regret this comment in the near future ;)
Looks like a good guess ;-)
I know it's only couple bucks but that was bought up quickly...
Red arrow was across two tops at the start of the drop. It doesn't mean anything now.

Anyway, something to keep in mind for people screaming pump at the first let up of selling pressure. 
That is a dangerous game to just assume your loss will turn into a profit, rather than an even greater loss.  But yes sometimes in a choppy market, it is not a bad strategy.
and also there is very little downside to buying real btc, you can use them for ICOs, trading on binance, money transfer and so on too
Did the same last time at 7800 for BTC and  660 for ETH some weeks ago
i think it's just people who put stops too tight
The exchanges have the most btc so yah
Financial institutions move slowly, but surely. Firms aren't opening up trading desks and funds on whims or hunches. The big boys don't move money without certainty. Do you know how ignorant Goldman Sachs and other large scale firms will look if BTC completely tanks? You do not understand the certainty with which these firms make decisions. We are seeing ***revolutionary*** steps every day regarding long-term adoption of BTC and cryptocurrencies, yet short-term investors scoff.


Look, I'm not here to ***convince*** you or anyone else of my opinion, I am here to voice it. What I do eventually know, with as much certainty as I can, is that pending no gigantic crypto ban, BTC will eventually burn the shorters and go very long. Just like it did last year. And people will be waiting for the dip to 1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8k which will never again come. 


Again, best of luck, you may be completely right. 
Do you know more than half of the positions on the site are dead or are already liquidated?
> I anticipate a bull break out of the pattern but there are no guarantees in life.

lol mate the only thing I understood.

Just kidding. You are expecting too much isn't it?
Yup. Shorty got jack.  We flat at the bottom of a weak-ass dump.  These guys could get it down to like $7k a month ago or whatever.  Next BD is G. ("B" >= $250 in one hour.) 

Edit to add -- look at the 1d candles to see what i'm talmbout.
well the majority is always wrong. Yet right now i mostly see bearish posts because the bears are loud, if the price goes up 500$ the bulls will be loud, so its not a great indicator to what the majority thinks.
I completely agree about 6.5k and im not saying we will not revisit. Im simply stating that I do not see this happening in the next few days. Im holding long term so it doesnt really matter to me. I trade a small amount because i find it extremely interesting and rewarding, potentially even a future job for me.
This gives private keys such a different connotation for some reason. 
You are awesome
It appears to me from this chart that we are too high and need to go back down. Or that we are too low and are due for another run. Lol 😊
I matched with girl on tinder that I ended up finding on r/buttcoin in a screenshot of PhilakoneCrypto flipping out when he got hacked. she was in his Facebook messenger inbox in one of the screenshots. What are the chances, right?? 

Anyway, asked her about it and it turns out she trades and stuff...they do exist.

Bet me. 😊
Hey there! 😊
Layman’s. Not sure what a TUI is. Trading under influence? That’s pretty funny if so!
I’m just under water right now so if we do drop to 7-8 wanna be in fiat to try and recoup all my sober shitty decision making
Hijacking here to update my risky position. Tight stops below flag breakdown. I think we bounce here as OBV is trending slightly. Will probably just be a scalp.

!short xbtusd close 9200
Not using Mex because if i buy BTC and this goes to goblin town i must short so i don't lose fiat value. In Kraken if i'm out of position i don't lose anything. I don't know if i can do the same in Mex
Can't watch charts now so i have no idea where the resistance is to see if it breaks through or not before opening a new short.

Anything above 8400 is like i hadn't close my short because i gain more than the fees i lose by opening/closing positions
This happened to me overnight, but 4 weeks worth of good numbers.
Painful :(

I read this completely wrong!
I don't like setting limit buys/sells before hand. Perhaps on those BGD i can try and set a sell way above the current value and keep moving it ahead of the current value with profit taking of 1% or so to try and catch the wicks and get out as quickly as possible.
As long as this stays above 8370 i'm fine with being stopped. If i re-enter now it will make up for the fees i have to pay. 
Those lines have been broken a few times..
No science behind it, the last leg up seemed too recent. I was thinking it was going to take another smaller rise before dumping under 8 later.
Der der DERRRRRRRRRR!

I'd hope that the market would resolve beyond either of those price points and continue up or down accordingly, which should make it easier to trade.

But this is Bitcoin, so...
Works for the bart alright.
More like short above 9300, long below 9250 amirite
I actually agree we're dropping again. 
>I wouldn't ~~of~~ have thought so
Yeah mate, I added to my short position a bit as well.
Why would that be a reason?
Consensus was a huge let down.

Its pretty funny that analysts were projecting a 70% rise this week and straight after we were hit with Korea FUD. 

How many people who had lost confidence before and thought "maybe this is the time to buy in again" are down on their investments.

Also, why did the media only teach people to short when we were below 7k, just like they told people to buy at 15k+

It really is true that you have to do the complete opposite of what you are being told to. 
Thanks

Walmart stock went down in February \(33 ranks\): [https://www.finanzen.net/aktien/Walmart\-Aktie](https://www.finanzen.net/aktien/Walmart-Aktie) and so does the chart in the link.

Apple went down 9 ranks, that is very stable \(the chart shows something else, but you need to check how many ranks a page dropped not only how the chart looks\)
Edit: I wouldn't take that risk. I am going long if it breaks up and have placed a buy order previously at 8450, now moved up to 8500 as an assumed "confirmed breakout" level. 
I think it doesn't worth the risk anymore, only if you had posted this 24 hours ago.
Other poll had bulls to bears at 37% to 19% (31% neutral) for when we were above $9k. 

I'm not really sure what the poll results have to do with TA though 
I would since you’ve asked for it but I haven’t had access to a desktop since posting. Perhaps someone else could?

Yowza, you caught it right at the top. Nicely done. 
The last few days it just pumps and dumps back and forth between low 8000s and mid-high 8000s.
Position sizing and conviction. I don’t make many trades. Ive been short since 15k and haven’t covered. The people doing these short little scalps never make any money. Actually statistics show they mostly lose.
Yeah it sure is tough to trade.  I used to be a 100% hodler, but I found myself compulsively watching the price anyway.  So I figured why not try trading some too?  I only trade a small amount of my overall stack. Most Is in cold storage.   I think my wins/loss are a wash right now.   Good luck 🍀 on your trades. 
"institutional investors getting interested this year"

Heard that all through 2017...
Are you planning to stop at 79xx or 77xx?
Thank you. I was equally confused until I saw your comment.
I apologise, as I anticipated this might confuse people. Regardless, significant reversals appear to have happened on the 4th or 5th of every month. I'm not sure if it's a coincidence or not at this point.
It's definitely an option for some but I only have 1 credit card!
I probably will if I decide TA is for me and I stick with it. I don't get that much time to practice though so 30 days isn't gonna be enough I don't think.
Thanks, will check it out.
Do you mean chart on those exchanges' sites using their own tools or still on Tradingview? If the latter then I can only have one chart saved at a time meaning I will lose my lines on other charts when saving to a new one. If the former then AFAIK GDAX doesn't have any kind of charting tools, does it?
I'm still very wet behind the ears with all this. If I get to a point where I am making good profits and they are enough to justify spending 50 quid a month then I'll definitely pay up, honest guv!
Cool, this is what I will do for the time being then, thanks. I guess I just need to practice using TradingView a bit more to learn how much I can do with it. 
Thanks, nice tip.

We are trying to fall through it since Friday if I am not mistaken. Many traders have actually fallen for this and sold their coins.
well one is actually not a trading reason, I need some physical BTC for some web stuff(not drugs XD). And now seems like quite a fair price for it
>. No reason to expect an escape from the bull flag now

exactly ;D
it could also be liquidity to buy into... we just don't know, but if someone is buying they're being pretty goddamn sneaky about it
am I the only one that has noticed most small traders/players are long and most of the big guys have massive shorts either to hedge or even some as big positions? Harvey, Mikexbt, aabtc (I think)


Whether the person is lying or not . . your a troll.
Why the hell would he have a duty to prove himself to you? 
who cares if he has the position or not.  He's just paranoid of stophunters.


Even if they were fake, they got cancelled, that means someone who put them there is afraid that they could be sold into.
I've seen enough time an action to trust it : put up massive (8k) walls to let the herd think big money wants that price. Let the longs pile in. Remove walls. 

Otherwise I don't pay attention to 1k walls etc


I was busy pooping my pants panic closing half my short 2% from the top
Na, I made this post right at the top at $9900.

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8h53jf/comment/dyhyvh8

But since then I’ve decided to just shut up since this entire sub is run by noobs and any wisdom I share gets downvoted and people make up lies about me. Whereas noobs talking absolute nonesene get upvoted. I tried helping, if people don’t want to listen, I won’t bother anymore.
Plenty of us were making noise.  I opened my largest short position ever at $9900, although I didn't manage that trade well and a left a lot of profits on the table.  My alts bled more than I made with the BTC short, but at least mitigated some of the damage.  I shorted my alts + 50% on this last drop and finally made a little overall profit, rather than still losing.
why do you want to be reminded of an advice you refused to listen to? in a month's time, when btc is $4k, it will be a very depressing reminder!
Bitcoin is an illiquid market, ie the order books are thin and it’s difficult to place LARGE orders without too much slippage. So if a big player wants to sell LOTS of coins then they need to find lots of people that will buy from them.

Institutional players will therefore make people go long, when the institution is going short. And vice versa.

So see all the fake-outs and Bart formations? That’s what that is.

Just like rules, trend lines are made to be broken. 

That line will break someday. Could be at $5,500. Could be at $550,000. But someday it has to fail.
> 5500

this is the hell I speak of
Well, I am wrong many times, but I have been good a few times, but those were big good calls, which gives me the financial freedom to be wrong many small times. I only trade with max 2% of my stack, which is mainly to have a stable income (I am usually positive at the end of each week), which I then withdraw and spent on things and obligations. My big trades are only 2 or 3 times per year max and that's only this;

SELL after HUGE spike (as in at least after 200% up, not before).

And then rebuy after at least 61% correction.

It works like a charm sofar for 5 years... so basically, I only need to make 2 big good trades, and everything else I do rest of the year is NOISE NOISE NOSE, nothing else.

edit: also i think its very rude and mean to constantly ask for me being banned!

> this douchebag market selling these large blocks will eventually run out of coins

"This douchebag" is called the "composite operator." Read up on that and stop spouting nonsense. Every Daily thread you're in here talking about one guy, when it's really dozens/hundreds/thousands of people acting off of each other and the charts.
Yes I think the general tone of the article is just click bait. Starting with rat poison, turd and bullshit. Really, these guys are so rude and unoriginal. One can almost taste the ignorance in their writings and comments.
It is FUD and it is just a sensational article. I think UD will not drive away crypto business with regulations. Meanwhile, people write garbage to attract viewers.
I don't think for any small purchases KYC would be necessary. That's redundant and they know it will drive crypto business away from US. Doubt it will be that harsh
[deleted]
> “Bitcoin as we know it could soon be over” is an ignorant and sensationalist statement.

It is a dumb statement, because it's already true that Bitcoin, as we knew it two or three years ago is over.  It's dead.  

And of course Bitcoin is anonymous.  Do you think that every address on the blockchain is linked to a name and SS#/passport #?       Some are....most are not.

Shit is about to likely get really bad for holders...and unfortunately for traders, as well.  This article makes me about twice as bearish and going to try to hold a short position most of the time.  I'm sure not going to have a long during USA business hours unless it's a short-term scalp. Because when these regs are announced, it going to likely tank the price...hard.

Not to mention what they are going to do to ETH and XMR and the rest.

We just have to hope that BitMEX holds out as long as they can, before a tank shows up at their door.  
I am getting lazy with drawing my lines and didn't even notice that one.  But I have been up all night, so that is some sort of excuse.
[removed]
Yes, I am looking to loan my money, not to trade (I also trade, but with a tiny portion). I am mostly holding, and prefer it that way, but by loaning, I can both hold and earn some passive income, which is always nice. 

I will check out Bitfinex! 
Well, I've sold thinking it would go down -- only to watch it go up -- too many times to play that game. Also, I don't like paying more taxes than I have to so I only sell after I've held for a year or more, and, actually, I've only done that a couple times with small amounts to reward myself.

If you sell a whole Bitcoin at 9800 and re-buy at 8200, you made $1600, 40+% of which goes away (at least in my bracket) when you account for state and federal taxes.  It's kind of a "whoop de doo" amount of money for me and not worth the stress.  I'm in this for bigger gains over longer periods of time.

We will go parabolic again at some point, probably this year. I'd sure feel stupid if I sold at 9800 then had to re-buy at 12,000 a week later, and if you think that can't happen, you haven't been paying attention.
Ahh, my bad!
Rule 1
Or maybe they want us to think that's what they want us to think.
you opened the long because buying pressure was relentless. Now that its been a few hours and the price is below at what you longed at will you convert to a short? \(because this movement proves that we have just been chopping all along, and even a movement to 8600\-8800 wouldnt mean that there isnt a high probability of a drop\)
Woah, I didn't realize you did this for a living.

I am proud. I actually put on trades with conviction and stick to them.
People don’t feel as scummy gambling with crypto. They can refer to themselves as traders instead of casino dwellers which has a worse stigma.
same... I tried them out last week, but the UI isn’t my cup of tea
Bitfinex has got to have much more counterparty risk than BitMex, given their track record.  And leverage is not as high, so you must put much more funds on there.  

So that, combined with their extreme shadiness, is a deal killer, even though BitMex is far from perfect.

I used to use okex. They have their own problems, and liquidity was abysmal last time I looked into going back. 
You're going to have to carry more of your stack, given that leverage is capped at 3.3x. Also, be careful if your using a VPN to avoid a country ban. I don't think they're as lenient or forgiving as MEX.
Please, anywhere but Bitfinex. Have we learned nothing from the past few years?

The next significant move, up or down, is the one I care about.
I actually just measured them both and you're not far off regarding Marge's ratio.

I measured the width as the widest part of their faces and the height from their neck to top. When I round the numbers off I'm actually hitting Fibonacci levels (and thus making this a tradeable tool):

* Bart's head has a ratio of 1:1.618 in width to height.
* Marge's head has a ratio of 1:2.618 in width to height. 
omg we did it
/thatsthejoke
Actually, The Honeymooners did.
Oh absolutely I don't believe that last Bar for a second but the others look promising
Looks like it. Lets see how far we can make it.
liquidating means no more fees from that customer. why would an exchange want to do that, economically?
Yep, it's manipulated to shit. Anyone with half a brain can see that the movements represent the actions of a handful of players. 
If that is the "market" then good luck to anyone trying to predict this shit short-term with TA.
I'm still short all in from 8680s, but might up the leverage and just long the bottom of the triangle if we stop there again. Might make for a quick scalp.
I am actually trying  to hold off on being too bearish now that we have established a clear range after $10k rejection and $6.5k bounce. if we fall thru $7k then I am very bearish again. 

But I'm glad I wasn't around then- I'd have been a moon kid the whole time. 

This whole experience has been trial by fire and I've had to learn quickly. I will do my best to put aside my personal feelings and go with the trend if we do have another bull run. 

I imagine if I had entered around Dec 2015 id have held through all of that bullshit. Maybe lost some money trying to trade but would've largely just held. 


We had 5 green candles in a row on the weekly, and the price went up 50% from the consolidation bottom. How is this a bear market?
We dont know how much OTC supply there is but we all know it aint a small number. I would image enough otc supply to move the market -$xxxx a few times. The min buy of OTC everywhere is pretty high.
Not saying BTC will die, OTC supply will run out eventually after a a x number of major big buys over OTC or will need time to recoup enough for such a move.

It will be another hurdle of price going up.
Why would it die? If miners stop mining difficulty will decrease and people will start mining with GPUs. If it happens too fast developers can use something like EDAs.

Probably used only for bank to bank transfers.  If anything, a direct challenge to Ripple.
No margin, no indicators, chart made for 5 years old, and they hand over your information to the taxman.
GDAX gave me the anal probe.. I gave em a bunch of information then moved my money back to a bank.  They had a slapshod verification process and refused to do it over the phone.  I didn't know if it was them or some third party service.  I travel a lot and fear kidnapping so I didn't trust them to keep the data safe.

I think their exchange is good though.  Just that one incident.  But I figured better safe than sorry.





I think it's largely due to the lack of alt coins offered like on finex/binance plus I think they shook their whole image a bit with the BCH listing debacle (Binance swooped in at the perfect moment). Also, Binance does a better job with customer service overall. 
A pattern for each side at once to mess up everyone... I give up. Going to sleep...

Sure if you want to throw centralized government coins in there, then adoption will grow.  Because eventually, it may be required by law to use such currency.
And to think I was going to ask you to repost *The Battle of 8500* again.
Looks like I didn't need that breathing space after all!  (but at least if it broke up further it would have been fully lossless including fees)
Oops!  Stopped out.  After that first mini bart I moved the stops closer.   It got hit on the dollar.
Damn bitmex overshot bfx upward on this one.
Fair enough :) 
If we go from 9950 to <8000 in 10 days, I'm wagering folks putting those buy walls in will not only pull them, but flip their margin long positions they're trying to support. 
Yea idk why he's talking about lol 
No. BFX allows wash trading. The person with that wall could sell through it themselves to push the market downward... or keep it up to accumulate short positions and then pull it.
Can we have a poll, would love to see how some selected traders here are making their moves. Cheers!
Gotcha, thanks for the information 
Also true, but we're still pretty far from our previous low, so I'd think that this is pretty audacious as a buy-in level, unless of course the target price is worth the higher buy-in. 

 I'm way too poor to even contemplate these things.

That's insane, given their margin fee structure. Have fun with that.
That almost never plays out, especially this far down the bear market. There would have to be some serious capitulation to see a bunch of longs closing or being liquidated all at once. 
I made some gainz long scalping in the middle of that drop from 88 to 82. Super risky in hindsight, but made some profits.
I am still waiting for that one bart...
hermano... remember when I got permabanned?

You brought me back... what if we gave Dushman a chance like that?
Gypsytoy has used an alt to avoid a ban as well but he's still here (which I'm fine with). and ironically I believe gypsy is the one who reported dush for ban evasion...

Idk how you can verify but he said on discord he's fine with a full report to share it 

Also, his latest comment is just a satirical copypasta. 

I know you don't like people who don't like bitcoin but I really don't think he was that bad. And he started to shape up right before he got banned.

Yeah feels like its designed to frustrate you and make you chase price, so better just ignore it. I think the main difference between then and now is that last year felt like there was a lot more organic volume, now it just feels dead. Imo if the volume is so low that one entity can fuck with the price so much its very bearish overall which is why im just opening shorts on these barts and ignore the noise. 
In my city I can pay with BTC at burger king. I just imagine sprinting to the shop with a TA print-out to quickly buy something before we hit resistance and bart down. 
[deleted]
There weren't many that altcoin scams, at least that I noticed (although I did get burned by XNN).  The exchanges going down was frustrating though and lost quite a bit from that...not to mention Gox, Bitfinex hack, etc, etc, etc, etc.  It was a battle and it still is a battle and that won't likely change until the party is completely over, which may not be long from now.
It isn't behaving like a normal stock at all.  Nothing about it is normal.  It was light years away from that before and it still is.
Ahh ok thanks. I’ve seen some crazy manipulation and I’m waiting for it to be manipulated up. I remember watching every sell wall on the thousand dollar marks from 10,000  (10k, 11k 12k etc) to 19k get blasted through By which had to be some deep pockets manipulating the price up. Hoping that’ll happen again soon lol
Maybe something for tomorrow if I'm feeling creative. 
Haha I have read this, though it’s not really thorough is what entails a “completed Bart entry” and the allowed oscillations during the dump/pump or pump/dump
Ah, tx. Now I understand why Google couldn't help me.
I remember it like it was yesterday.  The day it went to $175 I seriously thought BTC was dead forever.
> Price at $299: "THIS IS GENTLEMAN!"
> 
> Price at $270: "Everything is fine. Just need to consolidate for a bit before the market makes the final push past $300."

Lol, I remember these days all too well. "I guess it was a ponzi scheme after all" ... "Holy shit, this thing is going mainstream. Future of money, baby!" ... "Oh shit, someone must have hacked SHA-256"


I actually got into crypto when btc was $400 or so (and had NO idea about macro moves/wyckoff/etc).  Those months of $400 to 600 and back and forth made me seasick.  Large reason why I sold off so much at $1k, thinking this quick rise was obviously short lived.
 
Money lost aside, I'm excited about the next run... like I've been studying for a test for the last couple years and ready to kick its ass.
best time to accumulate.

before that the $5 range was also nice.
yeah, this is a very valid concern imo. 
at $7100-7300 fib retracement will be 78.6% which sits right on the strongest support line that bitcoin has
6000 is a higher low than 200 so to the moon! /s
There was about 7500 btc from 8000-8300, now it’s down to 3000
I don't see how being bearish can be more fun, unless you're keen to buy cheap BTC...which is being bullish...


We could reach 100k tomorrow and you would still enjoy being a bear.

Grats dude!

I've paid off a really bad long, and also almost paid back the enter/exit attrition losses with my recent trade too.
Yeah, I'm definitely drawing more lines than conclusions right about now.
These pump attempts are getting pretty sad...
Yeah, I’ll be all-in sub 5k. Got enough Bitcoin... don’t need to do dumb shit until things get ridiculous 
Haha, true. But a "fair" price isn't necessarily relevant with BTC. Much of it is still hype/emotion driven. Plus, the volatility has to then be taken into account in the calculation of the discount rate, which is difficult because traders will value the discount rate on the volatility much higher than, for example, a miner, for who the risk would be a negative value assumption. 

^^^I ^^^am ^^^honored ^^^by ^^^your ^^^presence ^^^oh ^^^great ^^^one.
Yeah, they were around $50-100. At $6k too, which is more like 1-1.5% than 0.5-1%. 

I'm just wondering if futures have ever been at a significant discount.

It was founded in 2015 so I'm not sure
just use mark as your stop trigger

I mean, if that 1% chance is worth more to you than your initial margin... by all means.
Yeah but what if you bought at 19k and then it goes to over 100k in a few years.  Still not a bad trade.  Of course you can always do better.  Too bad we all didn’t buy $7 per bitcoin like the winklevii 
I love this bot. Can we introduce more animals into trading? 
Stopped at 696 and reopened at 678....I’ll either be riding a giant dildo or rebuying 10% below stop loss one of these times.  At least this one was a profit.  I’ve been trying to set stops to keep myself in position pending major BRD but, I think I’m just going to have to reopen at the bottom of hourly dumps and set stops at b/e or profit.   I’m looking to ride the ratio with 50% of stack to around .1ish and then hopefully back down to the .05-.06 area.  
Also banking on this. For there to be much more sell pressure from this group of whales it would need to be a decent sized network of people in collusion to keep up enough pressure to break the 3.5k btc between here and 8k on finex or 5700 between here and 7800. 

edit: it would be so much easier/more profitable for the whales to make this bounce/yoyo from here .

lmao I didn't mean this to sound as negative as it did. It was supposed to be a joke actually. I agree with you
but they arent trading
Are you actually suggesting literally everyone who's gotten into crypto is still in it? 

I'm pretty sure there are tons of people who got out and watched the price soar and were absolutely fucking pissed that they got out. that's probably like 25-50% of /r/buttcoin's subscriber base.

But...I'm fairly sure that there are also a lot of people who got in November and quit some time between then and now.

I actually know several people who quit since November. For a lot of them it was the first drop to $6k
I can't see into the infinite future, so I can't confirm that they will never hold it again.
Definitely a good thing :) keeping a journal is good for trading

They don't even need to be at ath, just in a local high and peaking, but it's relatively flat.
Instead, that $25m attendee fee may give rise to value creation connections far exceeding that amount. (Primarily surrounding Ethereum's builder ecosystem it appears however)

I.e. new ventures, interoperation, regulatory influence.
they were demanding it a lot more in nov/dec than now, I'm sure.

This is beautiful 
Nice spot!
I'd imagine most folks who were planning to sell the Consensus news have done so already on the dumps in the last few days. Would take a pretty special snowflake to hold whatever positions you bought with a shorter-term trade in mind anywhere within the last 1-2 weeks up until today. 
This book isn't about that. Definitely read it.
I don't know, allot of ppl were vaguely protrump. And bch is mantaining a 10:1 price with btc on the basis that miner voting beats market forces.
I think that is definitely one possible scenario. It is exactly why I am much more hesitant selling / shorting than most. Anyone who sells and assumes they will be able to buy back lower is putting themselves at risk of missing the boat altogether. Eventually the boat from 8-9k will sail, just like it has from 3-5k. 


As someone who is a long-term bull, I believe that eventually all shorters will lose, incorrectly thinking they will have one more shot at prices which will never be seen again. 
who do you borrow it from? Is this unlimited?
They'd also have to buy it back in the event that they're shorting instead of selling existing coins. 
there is no short without an opposing long
People who have accumulated prior to August last year. There's plenty of people with plenty of coin before the madness of last autumn who are still well up. If the price drops towards low $6k, perhaps they will consider selling to lock in profits.
Same people that sold after every other bubble. It takes some time for some people to understand the severity of situation...
People said the same exact thing in 2015. Now let me be clear, I'm long term bullish but if we don't turn this ship around, I'll sell soon to buy 2x my cold storage at or around 4k.
People that bought at 5K or lower not wanting to go in the red. People that buy at 6400 certain it's the bottom. People who bought at 9990 realizing they've lost 50%. Lots of people could. 
it is a question of supply and demand not who would sell at which price.

if the demand decreases more and more the price will go down not because people would sell here or there.  and some point miners could panic that they might paid more to mine the coin than it can bring them and than they are willing to give a ton away. 
Miners?
noobs. so mostly people who bought after 1500. fear is a strong motivator for some people.
I'll give you a few reasons and speculate on why but really, you should generally just ignore it if the market doesn't follow. A big fat market buy/sell doesn't really mean anything if the market doesn't react to it.

1. could be an impatient short closing
2. could be stop hunting
3. could be market maker testing to see where market wants to go (no one reacted to this 900 coin buy, probably means we need to go lower)
4. someone trying to get their order filled on bitmex (maybe they had a 7000 coin short on bitmex at $8220 or something)
5. **probably the case:** someone simply wanted to buy and didn't think the sell pressure would be there to fill their limit order. they saw decent liquidity up to $8270 and were impatient enough to buy. Maybe they also thought this would incite some FOMO as well

edit: yup, #5: https://www.tradingview.com/x/IWho2ugx/

Could simply be someone rich thinks that it's cheap.
The thing is, as a trader sooner or later you'll fuck up, sometimes it'll be your fault, some times it'll be just a random market move

I think everyone here knows the time I got hit with a flash crash and lost a shitton because I was trading on margin and got force liquidated.

So its important to give yourself some cushion. 

If you are as genius of a trader as you think you are, you can make things happen even with 10%. If you are not, the 10% won't be as hard of a hit as 20% would be, and you can start back over since you'll have another 10% to play with(although I'd scale it down restart with 5% and if you lose that restart with 3% and if you lose that restart with 2%...and if you lose that quit because its obvious you don't know wtf you are doing and should just hold)

Basically gives you time to figure out and learn how to trade. Because I can tell you right now, my skill as a trader is much better now compared to what it was when I started. 
You could keep one set of the words with yourself and put the other set with a lawyer or something like that

You could also just have a scrambled seed and just have to brute force it if you needed to
I think it's obvious he's joking. It's just way too stupidly complicated. 
It’s in the mountains because it takes a while to get there (no airport anywhere close). The encrypted seed is completely useless to the third party and I can bribe them to give it to me if anything happens. If they dick me over, I can sue them. If that doesnt work, I can get the pieces of the seeds from my peeps. Also, the third party is a custodial service in Switzerland... they’re not going to fuck up their reputation for a measly piece of useless paper

If all else fails, I have one more option that I don’t tell anyone about, but basically I can recreate the seed at all times, but it takes a couple months to compute
> any normal human being would leverage up to 100x and withdraw margin

Can't cause you have to have higher risk limits which limits how much leverage you're allowed.

Works on a long as risk lowers as the position goes green. Long is the opposite so risk grows and therefore needs more and more margin.

> But you strike me as the type of person who has no issue living with unimaginable risks

I wouldn't be where I am if I didn't play the way I do.
The two most trusted I've seen are Nitrogensports and Bitmex.
For what i understand about the pattern (still pretty noob at TA), the H&H must sit on a top, so you have a upward trend leading to the left shoulder, a head, the right shoulder and then some down movement if it confirms creating a mirror image from what happened before the left shoulder.
Like my toilet now I’ve just finished :~)
I watch it on a lot of different time frames.  If we're at resistance you can usually find a time frame where its trying to cross.

How did you come up with it?  Is it cos 144 is a fib number?
for the 3rd time in 3 days? if it gets there again i'd be more worried about opening a long tbh. 
I already did, a very small position from 8330, but what i thought was a triangle started acting like a pennant so i'm unsure if that was a wise choice.

Usually the triangle should break down, but i have no faith on the patterns behaving like they should. 
For someone Bullish that believes the support will hold (and thus the triangle breaking upward) that should be the best R/R. Longing 8150 with stops right below 8100 should be pretty safe. Small loss if it goes against you and potentially going up to 8500-8600.

I shorted 8330 on the 2nd touch on the resistance line.
Anything under 8150 is a very good long entry if you're willing to hold to 77xx. (and you don't think we're revisiting 7200)
Lol. No. Try again.

Two year olds are distracted by keys.  There is no dumpster fire except the one where the banksters are burning mass amounts of worthless fiat trying to drive down the price of Bitcoin... and failing.
It's possible for sure, it's just that we don't have 15k shorts lying around ready to be squeezed...
See the sidebar. 

No memes or low effort content

Mostly because of where we are in my formations. I have resistance overhead at 8350ish, but there's nothing really below us until 8150ish. There's a whole lot of nothing between 8400-8650, but resistance directly overhead has held over 24 hours and is downward sloping. To open a long below the resistance forces me to hold it as it drops.

Conversely, I opened short when the resistance line was up around 8400. Now I'm in profit even though resistance hasn't been broken. If it gets summarily broken, I can flip long right around my entry. I plan to take profit below 8200 and move stops to just over 8200 if we turn around down there. 

edit: visual aid: https://www.tradingview.com/x/DH2rjtwN/
Same, I think this is going sub 8k but after visiting 8.6 again, so i voted 8.6
Then I change my vote :P
Yeah, I based my vote primarily on the falling wedge I'm watching, which could only ride to about $7900 before I'd expect the break up. 
The majority think 7800 is more likely, therefore following recent experience in this sub, the correct answer is 8600. 
big green dildo, this sub got some amusing nomenclature :)
He's been saying it for a while. 
Literally from the article:

> This wasn’t the first time Dorsey had spoken fondly of digital currencies. The executive tweeted in 2016 that he would “love to see a digital currency thrive.” In his role at Square, he has helped promote cryptocurrency. In 2014, the payments company started letting merchants accept Bitcoin. Since then, San Francisco-based Square has said it’s introducing Bitcoin trading for almost all users of its Cash App, which lets users send money to friends and family.

If you're talking about the news being Jack talking highly about Bitcoin at Consensus, yeah, that's news. Not sure why the market would care if Jack Dorsey showed up to Consensus though. 

If you're talking about Jack advocating for Bitcoin, that hasn't been news for a while. Since that's what you mentioned in your comment, that's what I responded to. 
It would be great if it just kept creeping up like this all the way to 10k and beyond. 
I took some profits at 8160 and decided to move stops fairly heavily down. They all triggered on this spike. 
The last major low was 6500. If we form a local bottom at 7800 (which may or may not happen) then it would be a higher low because 7800 is higher than 6500.
When BTC establishes a range after touching a bottom and a top 2/3 times. 

We bounced between $8600 and $9900. Then $8200 and $8900. Now we broke the low without breaking the high. 

So our ranges are getting lower 
Short at the top and long at the bottom.
Make the price movements just enough to incite action so that others buy/sell from/to you at the top/bottom
aaand theres the bart fml
@8100. It can be a pennant or a triangle. We're reaching the apex of the possible pennant so we'll see.
If it goes down should bounce @8100
True. There's some bullish divergence on the 4 and 6 hour time frames though, and it's coming up to bedtime here. Will sit this one out and see where we are in the morning.

Cue 7.5 or 9.2 in 8 hours time!
I haven't watched as much recently. People out of their minds. 
We don't really know either. All we see is that someone went long for a position *value* of $4.35mm. How much actual value was behind that 4.35 million dollars we can't really know, since Bitmex allows everything from no leverage to 100x leverage. It could be anywhere from $43,500 at 100x to $4.35mm at 0x. It's rather unlikely it was 0x though, because they probably wouldn't be on bitmex to trade without leverage. 

I'd guess it was anywhere between 5x ($860K) and 25x ($172K). But that's a complete guess.

edit: if it was lower leverage, it would have been liquidated last night when we were below this. Probably 50x after this morning's bart. 2% off 8400 = 8232.
[removed]
Yes I agree, not very strong but still there. Doesn't look like it will create a strong bounce though!
Well his level is well below 8280... For me this means a lot. What is wrong with username?
Fakeouts each way, but the downward ones are seeming to stick better.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/JVO96bvV/

Got a 50% profit take down near the floor of that now. I've gotten fancy with my positions too much today and surrendered a little of my big Mon/Tue returns. If I get stopped out here I'm taking the night off. 
Yeah so I wanted to reply here saying I thought we’d drop more after that move but posted to the whole thread... haha clearly rubbed some people the wrong way..
But, like, why should we/they keep it in mind?
Thx, as I noted it is only something for sideways until market direction is re-established. 
>  Do you know how ignorant Goldman Sachs and other large scale firms will look if BTC completely tanks

...not at all? It's not like they have any significant portion invested. They have what, a trading desk? They make money off volatility, not bitcoin mooning. 

Even Arthur Hayes (CEO of BitMex) said it today...he doesn't care if bitcoin moons. He just likes the volatility. 
> well the majority is always wrong.

no they're not. do you know how many people thought bitcoin was going to moon the entirety of 2017? the price goes up when people buy, why do they buy, cause they think the price will go up more (generally)

it's the majority of *traders* who are usually wrong, and I'd say that this whole "majority wrong" thing is a case of BTC ranging for several months now. 

When BTC begins to trend hard, the majority is often right 


Haha not bad. It appears to me that this momentum won't reverse just like that, even if we can see bounces etc.
It's a trap bro
Moon math has them at about 3%.
yeah I fucked a girl off tinder that traded bitcoin

although it turned out she was trading bitcoin connect, so i set her straight....well I fucked her in the ass first...then i set her straight 

this knowledge isn't free 
What a world...

I've read that again and I'm still very confused.  So many questions.  

Number one: You have access to Phil's inbox?
We do exist. Women love money too.
Yes. During times like this, I rather recommend OUI, depending upon the kind of influence you're under.

that's a ~~bingo~~ barto!
Oh shit.
buy the rumor, sell the news

> Walmart stock went down in February

Irrelevant to my point. Do you think there was a significant reduction in the number of customers Walmart serves, corresponding to this chart? 

Likewise for the oft-quoted google trends chart. Case in point: 

https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=samsung%20galaxy

Do you think there are fewer people buying Samsung Galaxy smartphones today than there were 5 years ago? Good luck with that.

Now, I'm not saying this kind of data is *completely* meaningless, but it's far from a straightforward 'up / down' indicator that you seem to think it is. Simply looking at those charts without any other data / context to go alongside it is going to give some very misleading results. 
This is actually most likely the correct answer.

Due to high leverage offered on Futures platforms, there's always been an incentive to take losing positions on spot if they mean an opportunity to take winning positions on futures.
This is what I've suspected for a while now. these people need to be pushed out of the market for all of our sake 
With Kraken you can “ over exaggerate” your profit taking places due to their their poor liquidity and over levered N00bs and sometimes can get lucky 
The chart says different.  
Short since 15k is an incredible entry on your part.
Kudos to you!
If you didn't close at 6k, what number are you waiting for?

Hedge or leveraged above stack value? 
To be fair the barriers of entry ARE actually decreasing now though, the momentum of which seems to be on an accelerating pace. 

Edit: I don't think this will majorly impact price though. 
Pshhh, I heard that in 2014.
I was gonna go with low 79xx.   Too tight?
Just on tradingview. You can pull up BTCUSD on each of those exchanges. I've found that when I chart something on one pair listing, it's still there when I go back even if I don't save it. I'm running two charts currently (BFX and stamp). 
There's no better way to learn than to just dive in and try every tool. And once you've got the basics figured out, I think you'll find that the hands-on experience will accelerate your grasp of TA. I've spent a lot of time reading other people's analysis and looking at their charts, but it wasn't until I started doing my own that it really clicked with me.
Cut losses on that one @0,5% so with fees i got out with a 1% loss from 20% stack. Minimal loss.
Will do the same if this breaks resistance again and stay in the sidelines. Being chopped 2 straight times will be a sign i should go work on the bot.
Lets start the "Got Chopped by a Wick" party. I bet we are not alone on this one
[removed]
Yeah also true. I'm just waiting this one out till tomorrow and only have very conservative buys in place for potential dips. 
aabtc has a short twice the size of mine, last time I checked.
That is a pretty small sample size not to mention how many of those 3 have proven their stacks? Maybe a lot of people with huge stacks don’t like to tell people how much they have for obvious reasons? I think your bias is showing a tad here man. 
I discovered the moneyflow indicator recently, it shows that real money went in at 6.5, went out at 9.8 and let suckers push to 10k. I have no evidence that big money is buying now.
How is that a troll? He makes wild claims and doesn't back them up. I call him out for not substantiating the claims and that makes *me* a troll? I don't follow. 
He doesn't. But he can't expect people to believe him and not ridicule him for his outlandish statements. It's not hard to do a verification, MikeXBT did as much and that guy never talked himself up like fuckharvey did anyway. fuckharvey says the most ridiculous, unsubstantiated things about not only his wealth and trading success but also about the tech and markets. He makes wild claims and then doesn't stand behind them. What else is a person supposed to do besides remain pretty skeptical at that sort of behavior? There's no reason to talk in absolute terms, anonymously to BitcoinMarkets. If you're going to do so, at least back it up with some fake screenshots or something.
Why would he post his positions and mention position size in the first place, while maintaining zero accountability for exits? He's a troll or shill, whether his positions are legit or not. Beware following him because 80&#37; of the game is exits and money management, of which people here have zero insight into because he offers none.
His reputation and credibility might care? The guy shouldn't go around making wild claims about his wealth and the size of his position if he's not prepared to stand behind it. MikeXBT did. Chewtoy goes to great lengths to avoid talking about his worth and vested capital. Unless your a MM like Mike, the topic is really irrelevant to discussion in this sub and has no bearing on analysis or predictions. If he wants to measure his dick then he should at least pull it out of his pants. It would take all of 30 seconds to settle this debate on BitMEX trollbox and yet he refuses to do so. If he doesn't want to be ridiculed and criticized then he needs to put his position where his mouth is and provide some evidence. Otherwise, he's just like a certain bunny before him.
or the person is done selling off in the $8K+ range like he wanted and the price will now be allowed to go back down

Or remove the walls, let the shorts pile in and then bart up. 
Noooo... really?
Good risk management though
This is what I like to see. No hindsight, but foresight! Well played brother!!! Also, you got 5 upvotes on it, so not downvoted to oblivion.

Don’t go. You are a very welcomed member. I appreciate your input.
Yes, making noise. I too said this was ridiculous.

But not the “I told you so” mofos that are super loud today.

Most people in here are a total joke and come out of the woodworks after the fact.

You are not one of them. You are one of us! I like you btw :)

Well done on that trade brother! I didnt have the balls :/
No he just wants to harass you later about it.
You do you.
~~Ah right that makes sense, so basically you're saying this is another fakeout for institutions to unload their bags/open up shorts with more downside in the near future, correct?~~

Edit: I'm an idiot it's clear from your chart. 
for Consensus 
I believe it’s spelled “gays”
Because MtGox is duuuuumping, sell everything, quick!!!! 

Oh wait, there is a court order prohibiting selling of MtGox coins...
*puts fingers in ears*

llalalallalalalala

No, in all hoensty, I am absolutely aware of this. I really hope it’s not before the next halvening though :(
chewtoy just called 550k

I dig it... 5500 was where I closed my first futures trade in disbelief. I really thought we would be at 4k for most of the fall and winter
how did I ask you to be banned? 
Exactly, they’re a borderline tabloid news source. No credibility. 
Define "small purchases".
Bitcoin's primary appeal has largely been a lack of regulation, has it not? I mean, the whole point of it was so subvert authority and avoid centralization. Large financial institutions requiring KYC/AML to buy,  sell, send, and receive bitcoin puts a pretty large damper on decentralized anonymity so far.

While it's only strongly pseudonymous instead of anonymous, the lack of regulation and KYC/AML made strongly pseudonymous virtually the same thing as anonymous, unless I'm mistaken. 

heavy handed regulations will kill some of the appeal for, say, tax evaders and money launderers, no? 
Of course the current system is not remotely sustainable. Do people here think that in 10 years you can send XMR into an exchange and get a wire for 10m or 10k the next day?
> Now, they haven't made it illegal, but they've done basically all but that.

Yes exactly.  At least a few people see the obvious truth.  The rest are in denial or just not smart enough to see it.


If this specific click-bait article is the driving factor behind your decision to become twice as bearish, you clearly have not been involved in this market for very long at all. And that is completely fine. This sub does a great job at welcoming newcomers and informing the ignorant. 

This article is 100% pure re-hashed, re-spun “news” that has already been circulating the media for *months* . If you can’t see past that, try to familiarize yourself with the process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and evaluating information before jumping the gun on your sentiments.
Just a heads up, Finex is not open to US customers and is more strict about this than BitMEX. Not sure what happens if they shut down your account for this reason. Also, just general counter-party risk disclaimer. If they have you coins that means they're gone if they get hacked. Is earning interest worth the risks? Just something to consider.


You think?
Honestly, with the frequency that I post, I'd have been fired months ago from any normal job. I don't care at this point. 
Why would it be considered a big private secret? Just wondering.. 
Hahaha I'm way less cultured than that. It's a SpongeBob quote. 

He and Patrick eat some gnarly horseradish and they have awful breath and both think people are repulsed by them because they're ugly. But it's just cause they're breath stinks. They start accepting life as an ugly cretin and start shouting it at the top of buildings 
Like a marriage, one might say.
I’d prob be looking at a much better roi playing craps/blackjack...
Let's assume I have 100 btc in cold storage (I don't, but it's a nice round number, and easy to use for an example). 

I currently keep 10 on Bitmex, and would have to keep 30 on Finex. 

Let's say that each month, Bitmex's server lag costs me 1% on a 10x position. This could be due to any one (or all) of the following:

* I'm forced to enter a position too early and have to exit immediately when the market backtracks

* My orders don't go through during a breakout so I enter 1% higher or lower than I intended

* My market-close orders take 15 to 20 seconds to execute and result in 1% slippage more than I would have seen if they'd executed immediately. 

So, in theory, over the course of 20 months, the additional profits I'd realize by trading on a more stable platform would outweigh the additional counter-party risk. 

And honestly that's being generous to Bitmex. Their server lag has cost me far more than 1% per month in missed profits/realized losses in 2018. 
Yeah price definitely seems to get over extended on the futures. Any other concerns worth sharing?
I'm not in the US. I shouldn't have any issues.
Ya, it'll take me awhile to evaluate the right platform.

Okex is an option. I'll probably take like .1% of my trading stack over there for a week or two and see what the experience is like these days.
Narrator: and thus a new meme was christened, and an old one confirmed.
Thank you for your thoroughness 
Everything that old is garbage.
Every time i tried scalping against the trend, got stuck in deep underwater positions... For now i just short with tight stops. If this reverses i'll change to longs. Scalping 2% close to a "bottomless pit" (it should stop @7800) is dangerous.
It just depends on what you want to call a bear market. Most of the debate around this revolves around time frames and semantics. 

I'd easily call this a bull run but I wouldn't call it a bull market. 

A decent definition of a bull market is that you have to pay up to get back in. Considering halfway between 6.5k and 10k is $8250, we're not really in a "bull market" seeing as around half of all people can get back in for cheaper. 
$20,000 -> $9980 -> $8200.
Because its down 50% rather then up 200% every 3 months
so much money has been invested since last summer, i just think this correction is the sideways movement until the next run up.  The public has totally dismissed Crypto at this point which is awesome IMO.  
It's ETH based at the moment at least. I can't see many banks being too pleased waiting for cryptokitties to unclog. 
Think a regulated competitor for tether. 
Yeah that's concerning. I don't deal in crazy balances like a lot of you folks presumably have, and I assume my info can be bought or hacked, and that still freaks me out too. Stay safe.
They also don't offer margin anymore. 
good instinct. I scaled down my short from where it was before getting chopped up
Hardware failure on BFX causing random 100x multiples of arb bots supposed to be scalping. 
Hardware failure on BFX causing random 100x multiples of arb bots supposed to be scalping. 
I've been thinking about this quite a lot recently. There's gonna be some great autobiographies/interviews written about the shenanigans that went on in the early years of the crypto markets. I bet there will be some movies made too. 
lol I'm fairly certain I'll get the opportunity to again in the coming weeks. Oldie but a goodie. One of my highest-rated posts ever. womp womp.
I'm shaking my head at disbelief at these movements. I'm going to lose one of them, but I manually closed at 8240 and reopened 8412. 
If your original buy in was 6.5k but then you sold at 9.5k buying here would net you over 1000$ per coin in profit effectively putting your buy in in the 5000's. Seems pretty good to me :')
Been holding since Jan 2017 but I don’t want to be in a leveraged position now at all if we go over 8400 and hold I’ll open a long back up
I've made an absurd amount shorting the last week. 
As you know, margin rollover fees apply to the initial position entrance amount. 

If you're up significantly on said position, it becomes a difficult decision as to whether to close or not, as re-opening at some point could cost multiples more in margin rollover fees.
Hmm fair enough, though I think quite a few thousand are currently underwater on Finex... nothing that will cause apocalyptic movements, but can definitely amplify a dump. 
I am literally closing as soon as I see my order got filled. if the price is lower, I close at break even. just tryna get that 0.25%
The one to complete against the 4/12 bart?
Didn't realize Jared had saved you as well, compadre. He was the only one who would listen to me in my time of need. He understood how I'd mistakenly taken the rabbit bait.
I was more commenting on the apparent abandonment of the account and the likelihood that he's ban evading anyway.

/u/gypsytoy  did a lot of things differently. So did /u/L14dy . In both those cases I advocated that the perma ban be lifted. I have a history of lifting bans and perma-bans and I'd like to develop a reputation for it.

If Dushman wants to be unbanned it's in his court to figure out how other people got it done.
>And he started to shape up right before he got banned.

No he didn't. Even under his alt, /u/ustorest, he was making outrageous claims and instigating hate. That's why it was so plainly obvious it was him (and yes I was the one who put together the various pieces of evidence [dates, mannerisms, etc.] and passed it along to mods and admins). 

It's unbelievable that you would put the two of us in the same category. DushmanKush is repugnant beyond atonement. That guy has a massive chip on his shoulder and wants others to suffer at his benefit. It's a toxic personality and, personally speaking, I'm glad he's gone. Probably the worst regular I've seen here in regards to what he contributed versus the damage he did. People didn't want to post because of his vitriol. 

Not that it matters but *that's gonna be a no from me, dawg*.

 /u/jarederaj 
Definitely, last year the market behaved pretty irrationally overall with massive hype spikes, but if felt a lot more humane, you could understand what was going on and predict the next move to an extent. This is complete nonsense.

I'm starting to worry this kind of behaviour will scare new people and bigger players away. Its not about the volatility, its about the randomness and lack of order...
yeah the Feds QE works really well lol
More like a normal stock, not like a normal stock. 
Just curious what makes you and others know the next run is inevitably coming? 
Oh shit I forgot it was that much...1k was sold into last night tho.. or this morning whenever it was 
I think it's just the greed that irritates me, honestly. There's a weird sense of entitlement that I don't like about people being 100% bitcoin will moon. 

if/when the usage backs it up in some way I'll start getting excited. I guess I just have found most arguments unconvincing 
Can someone please tell me what BGD is
There definitely isn’t a clear “ pattern “ right now besides Bart’s, can kinda just got off resistance/ support / log lines for now.. otherwise it’s a gambling game 
I don't know, i also don't know where to see the data for that and compare it as well. Would be super fun to see if it meant anything. I also didn't start trading until Jan. 2017 so i am a newb in that regard. In anycase I did open up a long with stops below 7.8. 
And if it goes to $4k then that's not good...I mean if you're under the assumption that btc will be $100k in a few years then yes, all of this is a good buy. 

But I feel like that's a silly way to see it. 

If you guys are positive it's going to $100k in a few years I have no idea why you even look at charts on anything less than a 1 month time frame. 
Well, it's not gonna go up forever.


Besides he was talking in relative terms.
It looks like you asked for more animal facts! There are 21 species of fox
At least you're hedging your gamble. Choppy action is very hard to  time correctly.

I'm all BTC right now, eagerly watching my delicious those that must not be named losing satoshi value, anytime now my precious, any time...
Yeah real good and thoughtful insight on the possible ways to interpret this.
I'm not suggesting 'literally everyone'.... still around.

(Also uncertain what you mean by 'still around'.)

&nbsp;

I've simply personally never witnessed anyone cease to hold *any* crypto.




> Are you actually suggesting literally everyone who's gotten into crypto is still in it?

Yes he is suggesting that...and also that "This is Good for Bitcoin".

Cheers, I think it still qualifies as a bullish div as the "middle dip" was rather short and I think it could be omitted as noise (it was more of a bart), plus the blue line on the price actually doesn't go to the low point of the price movement if I see that correctly. It's not the cleanest bull div, but from what I've seen I think it classifies as one primarily due to the substantial drop in price with a weak drop in RSI. This is just my 2 cents and I'd like to add the disclaimer that this doesn't mean price will necessarily go up from here... 
Back to the drawing board it is.
i think this sub sees neutral sentiment as bearish due to how bullish the market has been as a default state  for years now 
I dont know dude ive seen so many coins take a shit and deflate after big events the past year that i feel its better to be safe than sorry but maybe im overanalysing
no, there are limited amounts of coins and derivatives in circulation
? Of course there is. Just sell into the order book. Unless you mean 'long' in the loosest non-margin sense.
Why didn't they sell at 15k-20k to lock in profits? This fundamentally doesn't make sense. If you are holding through the high and the crash you have a long term view. If you had a short term view and bought late you panic sold already. Many people wouldn't sell simply because they want long term capital gains tax advantage.
Did they? Capitulation and Despair was very palpable back then for a long time. It was the ONLY sentiment in the market. Optimism was scarce.
good luck
when everybody thought cryptonwas dead it didnt even go below 6k..and now because its gonna take a while longer for a bullrun people gonna sell below 6k?   no logic in that lol
Thats not really how this market is tho, you've got panic sellers(get rich quick, sell at first sign of danger), fence sitters(will jump when the grass turns green) and all or nothing long term holdrers(holders of last resort) won't sell until moon can afford to hold indefinitely. Yes there is some bleed between categories and defectors but this is basically the entire market of "hodlers"
Miners have least reason at all to sell at a loss
If you check margin data, it was a long opening.
Thank you.
That person would more likely try to prevent slippage via buywall unless he thought someone else was about to pump it.
I am 100% serious and it’s not stupidly complicated.
I don't think so.  It all sounds plausible and certainly complicated, but not "stupidly" so, when likely millions of $s is at stake.
fine then leverage up 25x or 10x 

You reduce counterparty risk by 90% if you’re 1x right now

Not saying your risk appetite is bad, I just dont understand it
To be honest I don't know where I originally found it! All I know now is that it's uncannily accurate and really does pick out resistance.. If you look as you say across multiple timeframes.
What if it's an ascending wedge inside a descending triangle? lol

https://www.tradingview.com/x/RlhMZLRR/
Uh man, I need to understand why do you think we will go to 77xx? Perhaps I could be in the wrong position if I can understand and relate to it.
Short squeeze got us to 8k... the other $2,000 was mostly the work of the market. The money is on the sidelines ready to flow in when things look bullish. Probably once we are beyond 9k again. 

Finex whale also scooped up 1k+ BTC every 100$ down from 9k after false Korea fud was released. There was no other reason for the sell off other than fear and fud. So thats a bit of bias confirmation here for me as well. 

I would be more cautious if there was some fundamental reason for the sell off and for it to continue but I see none. 
I agree, this does seem possible.
Nicely played. I had a great entry yesterday with my long from 8350 and hedge short from 8800 and then somehow ended up getting chopped up on the bounce back from 8.2 (my long stop loss triggered around 8150 - really thought piercing 8.2 was going to take us to Goblin Town), with my short getting stopped out (take profit) at 8.4.

I'm currently short from 8380 and have set stops a little above 8.4 (because swap price on Mex likes to freak out on pumps) according to what you've drawn there. Hoping it turns out to be the right strategy.
Damn my awful polling skills 

Maybe I should just male a new one. Hmph

Nah. I think it's still an interesting poll . Your vote should stay if you really think we'll hit $8600 first 
I'm with you. It went up like $200 today. That's actually a LOT if you think about. If it went up at that same rate, we'd be up another $1,000 within 5 days. So we'd be at all time high in around 3 months. 



But markets are not like that, therefore making that completely irrelevant. I just like to think about stuff like that.
There ya go, considering you didn’t take heavy profits on the first bart when u got stopped out around 8550 this one should feel good.

I’m looking to re short around 8.5k and this is probably just a DCB 
Yes I think this is what I am hearing but sloppy says different and I tend to agree with what he says. I guess it's a matter of perspective. Just trying to be on the same page as it's confusing.
Thanks. Appears people base it on different time frames and can be intepreted different. I'm bullish for the LT but I don't see how going back to $7800 is bullish in anyway and it's hard to call it a higher low for me. Sucks no matter how you look at it if you ask me.
Probably the wiser call. I wouldn't be surprised by either of those numbers haha. 
I seriously think this is a big catalyst for the barts. People are just gambling big on bitmex recently. 
Well it can't be 1x leverage or they wouldn't be getting liquidated. Also I highly doubt it is anything less than 10x or they wouldn't be getting liquidated at this price point. I suppose it could be 5x if they went long at like 9800.
Great, thank you! 
Can you please just try to be a constructive member. sometimes I confuse your username with u/justanotherlogin and I think:

wow u/myusernameiforgot finally contributed some great content. And then I see the bot and I realize I mixed the two up.

Is it too much to ask for you to focus on the why and not the what?
lol, I was just kidding

I meant the chart is a dream and you are not following the dream 😝
contrarian viewpoint would be that the downward moves are sticking better, so, good time to accumulate since you have already tested the amount of sell pressure buys will generally cause. less slippage=better prices. just a thought.

edit:if I know that buying 100 BTC will only bring the price up by X amount of dollars, and the price will "naturally" start to fall back down, but selling 100 BTC will drop it down by 2X, then now is when I consider making a big buy because I can count on the sell pressure above where we are now.

I'm starting to think this is a wedge and not a descending triangle...
All bets are off as where the support should be (it might still be @8100)
Like I said, bb getting tighter so that move didn't change anything, should happen soon, usually market move when they're around $80 on 15m.

Wow you completely missed the point. I'm not going to go through and link sources to show you how many firms have bought huge positions into crypto. It isn't about a Goldman Sachs trading desk, it is about a Goldman Sachs funded startup making moves like this: 


https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/15/goldman-sachs-backed-start-up-circle-introducing-a-crypto-us-dollar.html


"Goldman Sachs-backed start-up Circle introducing a crypto version of the US dollar" 
of course they did, they invested in it, they were the majority in the crypto space, which is a minority in the actual world, even today. Now we, the crypto minority still believe in btc and alts, but the outside world thinks it has all gone to shit and crashed and burned never to recover. And they are wrong.
i recommend bitcoin connect to all my ho's.  They need you more if they broke.

This is why you don't trade when you're falling asleep I guess lol, that was a dumb trade I'm out @ breakevenish. !long ethusd close 686
But i'll be paying fees by being in position no?
fair enough, i'm seeing the light.
I’m sceptical 
>but it's far from a straightforward 'up / down' indicator that you seem to think it is

I never said this. I just see a EXTREM sharp decline, they are lower than they where when the price was between 2 and 3k. Bitfinex dropped like 3000 ranks from a almost Top1000 site to now sitting at place 4000 or so. That makes me just think how can this be? I do have an explanation for that. Same with the google trends, for me the explanation that it is a lagging indicator is not enough to not take this into account as a strong bearish sign.

Word of month is the most important part to generate new buyers and to get into mainstream and all this shows it is just not happening, it is not not growing, it is instead heavily declining.
Sometimes? Long wicks abound on Kraken, it's wonderful.
It literally did that. 83>88>83>89>81>?
There's a guy here who shorted $19k and said he added at $13k and...yup..$9-10k. 

He pm'd me a few weeks ago about it. 

Patience > all the day traders that get gobbled up. Chew is probably one of the only day traders here who will actually end up with more money than they started with. 
You may be fine there. 7800 Is the magic number everyone and their mothers are looking to close short/open long. Probably means most people will creep that up and be happy with close to 7900. Holding 8200 to 77xx is a pretty wide stop, though, so I'd probably either be inclined to bail 7975ish or be willing to hold till 7800 falls. 8K may very well hold, though, and I wouldn't bail on a long until it falls. 
Ah yes, you're right! It does seem to keep all my lines across any charts without having to save anything. I obviously need to watch some TV tutorials or something to learn their lingo - I just read the feature comparisons and where it said you could only save 1 layout on the free account I assumed a layout would mean lines/indicators etc.

Thanks for clearing that up :]
Makes sense - Will get stuck in as soon as I can, thanks for the tips. 
I accumulated like a 10~20 percent stack hit on those in the last week or two in these situations.  It can definitely pay off though when you land ones that stick.
I should have just set manual stops above 8400 like I was thinking, I knew a double top would be likely there even if we broke up out of the triangle, but the velocity that candle moved had me cut bait
[removed]

Well yeah, definitely a small sample size but I just don't know of any whales here that are long. Seems like all retail traders. 

And Mikexbt showed me his futures hedge in bitmex chat. which was extraordinarily massive btw

And believe it or not it's not my bias, it's kinda the other way around. if I saw more big players who were long I'd have a hard time not being more bullish. I don't know of any, though. most seem to be neutral or bearish 
I dislike harvey's attitude and posting style a lot, but funny enough that's what makes me believe him more. A lot of hardcore ~~gamblers~~ Gordon Gekko style traders have that sort of brash, narcissistic mindset (I'm the best, rekt everyone, money is a high score / measuring stick, etc.) so it seems plausible.

That said, it's not a requirement. Some people have similar stacks / successes without the outsize ego.

And, I am certain there are at least a handful of people here with 6/7/8-figure positions. Not all of them are so vocal about it, though.
if some random guy on the internet asked me about my balance I'd ignore him.

can you imagine if this is how it goes down. You'd really have to laugh at how easily the market is held up by fake walls 
Has it ever been proven that this actually happens? Has anyone "confessed" to doing this?
Maybe, temporary. If you think smart money is interested in 8.2k btc, when all they have to do is be patient, let the momentum work for them and scoop it at 3-5k wherever that goes, you should rethink. Barts make no trends.
I wouldn't be surprised if something like this happened. People selling now anticipating the drop, then whomp fat finger back up
It took some stress off of my shoulders. I literally just wanted to take a shower without having to worry about coming back to half my account liquidated, lol. I even said that's why I did it- cause risk management. There's a comment about it on the daily back when I opened the position.

I added more back on the way down so it's fine. Missed out on about 5% of movement but whatever, I'm honestly kinda proud of myself for being disciplined. One of those trades where it's like "well, it didn't work, but I'm still proud of myself for pulling the trigger."


It’s no different from the perma bulls coming out with bollocks either really is it? “The big green dildo is pushing the shorters shit in” is a comment I saw yesterday from one perma bull as the price bounced.

Of course bears aren’t going to be saying “I told you so” as the price is going up, because, the price is going up! Same for bulls when the price is going down. 

People are far too entrenched in camps here and far too emotional. Ultimately we’re here to make money/accumulate BTC. The market direction allows for both. So why such negative sentiments against bears/shorters when bulltards are just as bad on the way up? Surely trading the trend is sensible, and people will comment/make projections based upon the trend.

Edit: the last question is directed to the sub, not to you personally :-)
that would eb a very rude thing to do and if he does i will defianitely report him to the mod!!
Just wait until the Koreans wake up.

> If this specific click-bait article is the driving factor behind your decision to become twice as bearish

The article is not the reason.  Reality is the reason.  I've said this would happen for five years now.  It has taken longer than I expected, but besides the timetable, it is playing out just as I knew it would...just as it had to, given how the world works.  
Not US-based, so I can strike that off. Hmm, that's true... But there's always a risk, and I guess them surviving the previous hacks is a good thing, hope they have learned from it. Might try it out with a few coins, lets see if it is worth it or not. Still have an account, why not, will give it a shot.

Well, there's the "china bans bitcoin" element. Which is why Okex exists in the first place. 

OKcoin used to offer futures trading on their regular platform, but had to open a BTC-only futures exchange when China dropped the hammer.
To fully hedge, wouldn't you need 30% of your stack there then?
looks like this chop is consolidating to fill the gap in SMA; do you think we see 8700s before seeing sub 8k?
Bitcoin bull market have been when is everyone is 'free'

To get free the price is either higher than anytime in the past (last one started around 1k)

OR

Everyone has totally accepted their loss and a run-up isn't 'getting back losses' but adding gains.

Each time BTC bubbles up the next round gets harder and less likely.
Haha.. that's right.  Sometimes with new technology you don't want to be too revolutionary or it won't catch on (like a flying car).  Perhaps it's just a first phase to see how it will work and gauge the adoption rate before creating their own blockchain/coin.
Nice move!  Was busy working during the movement myself.
Cool. You got lucky. Go buy a lotto ticket.
Yeah but longs are easier to protect and the consensus is that we're going to bottom and start going up again so more people hold on to them through dips and bear traps, etc.
haha no mate, not the one against it. Same color. :)
I got banned for a very crude joke

Jared had me write a formal apology and I was then unbanned by the mod gods
that’s fair!
What do you mean they did things differently?

I'm not sure what you mean about the other stuff. And I mean...I'm asking you how to do it since you're a mod now. how would we appeal? Does he need to write an apology or something? Not even joking. The dude misses the sub.. and quite a few people here seem to miss him as well. :( 
You two had a spat and pulled out personal insults is all. He brought up your history of margin trading, which was shitty, but nothing that crazy.. He's not nearly as rude or toxic to anyone else. 

On his alt afaik he was only belligerent with you and that's partly/mainly because you were following him around trying to get him banned again.

I get why you hate him but I feel like most of it is because of your personal arguments with him, not because he treated *everyone* like that. 

Yes he's bearish and rude/derisive to bulls but there are dozens of bulls here who are the same way to bears. I could list em all easily. Which is 110% A okay in my book although it is a bit silly and maybe deserves a day or two ban if it gets out of hand. I don't think it's perma ban worthy is all. I just think he's served his time 
I don't think you should be worried about that. This is probably just to bleed out the amateur traders, which will probably leave(I'm not even that rekt from this shit and I already feel like leaving). The bigger players are waiting for regulation before they enter the market and they look at fundamentals, they know this is a super low volume asset so the behaviour shouldn't worry them I think. At least thats the impression I got from Consensus talks..
[deleted]
There are what I'll refer to as "super cycles" that bitcoin has gone through since it's birth.  Each cycle has a large run (going 50 to 100x 's the start), followed by a large retracement (75-95%), and finally a long period of sideways.  This has happened over and over and over, I think 4 or 5 times now.  So nothing says it HAS to happen again, but if we're in the business of gambling on trends, that's a really obvious/profitable one to bet on.

(Note: these cycles can take anywhere from 6 months to multiple years, so many traders comepletey miss them.  A trader getting in the game in '17 wont realize this is the end of a cycle that started in '15.)
What are the odds it's not?
I think another run is inevitable because there are too many institutions in the game or getting into the game now for one not to be. We've been hearing a lot of rumors about large OTC buys as well. Once more frameworks are setup like custody solutions, NYSE/NASDAQ exchanges, and possibly an ETF, the fireworks should explode. 
It definitely sucks to be bullish in a bear market, where you’re constantly let down by bull traps and false hope.

At least when you’re a bear in a bear market, every drop and false breakout up gives your heart a warming sensation 
Big Green Dildo. Not the type your mother keeps in her makeup drawer, the type that wrecks over levered shorts and sometimes make **Absolutely no fucking sense**

Yeah, I'm not making any moves today. (almost got caught with that false break up earlier though).  Just waiting to see where we go within the context of the larger falling wedge, for now.
 I wish I could see old contracts but I think tradingview deletes old futures contracts data for bitmex. :(
I’m certain on that 

Edit:  I watch the charts because I’m trying to accumulate as much btc as possible between now and then. 
ooh tell me about manatees
How about something on the bull?
ETH/BTC is currently in the middle of another 1D bull flag and every one of them has broken up for the last 6 weeks...
Still around as in holding crypto.

I know a few people from this subreddit alone. 

Also, how do you define never holding crypto again? Like, they have 0 intentions of ever buying it again?

I don't know, but I know people who have exited and don't seem to be itching to come back. They got burned by buying high and selling low. 

I just got a pm tonight from someone who intends on selling if the price goes below $8k and then not buying back until we're at $5XXX or $12k. 
Thanks. That's kind of how I was viewing it but not enough experience at this to know for sure. 
Thanks for your input :)
yes I understood that, I'm trying to dispell this myth.
Thats not what your implying "huge cash reserves" don't help you short bitcoin and become insansely richer.. If so, it would be done already. 
>Why didn't they sell at 15k-20k to lock in profits?

Because moon.

"Lol, grandpa had 25 bitcoin when he was younger and he sold it for only $20k.  ROFL grandpa, They're worth over $5 Million now."
You're ascribing "hodl" psychology to a group that likely had that mindset on the way up...but might not on the way down. 

It's very easy to say you'll hold your btc until it reaches $100K, no matter what. 

It's a very different thing to put that strategy into practice if the price drops close to your entry point. 

Breakeven is a logical line in the sand for any investor who has watched the market move in their favor and then move agains them. 

If they entered at $5,000, they could certainly have held throughout this entire period with $100K on their minds as an absolute certainty. 

For many, that will change if price reaches their entry point. 

And to answer your initial question of, "why didn't they sell at $20K to lock in profits?"

Because they didn't believe that was the top at the time. There were very few who did, even here in this sub. 

Why didn't they sell at $17K? Because they were sure it was just a small correction and the market would refuel and jump again.

Why didn't they sell at $13K? Same thing.

...

Why didn't they sell at $6K? Well, at that point their profits were so small compared to what they *could have been* that it just made sense to hold on until breakeven.
How would they know 20k was the top? Like most other people, greedy waiting for $50k. Then when $50k arrived, they'd be waiting for $100k. It will be people refusing to accept that the bull is over. There are still people that refuse to accept it. Perhaps they are hodlers whose hands get weak. They can only hodl so long before locking their profits. If you bought anything and held before August 2017 you're still at least 3\-4x up even here.
they can't wait forever 
yup, I should've looked at that...guess I was right about it being #5.

looks like a 500 btc long opening.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/IWho2ugx/

nah some people are just retarded.

I mean, it's not a bad idea if you think the market will react to it. But so far it seems to have completely failed. 
Nobody here does, it's why I said nobody should try to follow me cause they probably can't handle it.

Also, I can't increase my leverage that high because of risk limits. You need enough wiggle room in case the market moves hard while you're away. To do that, means you need less leverage.

I don't think you understand just *how* big my position is. Also, Bitmex has no plans to alter risk limits even though the market has grown considerably, I asked.
Another cool thing i'v found is to use it for scattering around buy orders on the ones price is above and sell orders on the ones above the price.  You can sometimes get into auto scalp mode.  Especially during Bart season!
That's a double kill right there. 
Bearish pattern inside another bearish pattern, my short would love that.

It could also break down from the wedge only to break upward from the triangle just to mess every one
I don't necessarily think that we will go to 77xx, but if we did, that would be the point I'd look to get out of any long positions I had. In my opinion, opening a long at 8150 and holding underwater until 7800 falls is about the same risk/reward as opening short at 9850 and holding until 10200 falls. It makes sense based on the ranges we've been in for much of 2018.

It's not that I think we're definitely going to go to 7800 and bounce. If I thought that, I'd just wait and open a long down there. 

Very big picture, we went:  
20000 to 5800  
5800 to 11700  
11700 to 6400  
6400 to 9900  
9900 to ????  

Some people think that is going to be 8000. Some think 7800. Some think 7200. Some think 3000. I personally fall in the 7200-7500 camp, but I'll be very ready to flip long at any point under 8K. 
>> you can assume $7800 includes $7899 btw  
…  


“*Ok everybody I’m thinking of a number between 1 and 10. If you think it’s less than 5 then please choose 9. If you think it’s a number divisible by 3 then choose 2 and if you think it’s greater than 8 then choose 4. Then we’ll see how everybody did.”*  


&nbsp; 


LOL just messing with you bro
 
I'm no disagreeing with what Potato says, we're just talking about different time frames. Our next low could be $7k and it'd still be a higher low with regards to the range since around February (whenever we dropped from ~$13k). 

with regards to the past few weeks $8.1 is a lower low after getting rejected from $10k
Big gamblish bets on Bitmex combined with the fact that spot exchange volumes are quite low compared to Bitmex volumes nowadays, yes. Prices are likely to remain volatile and have these silly jumps up and down until either spot exchange volumes increase, or Bitmex volumes go down. 
BitMEX follows the market, it doesn't lead it. It's absolutely a catalyst for catching beautiful wicks OFF the barts, though, especially on futures. Sept futures wicked almost $200 below the bart on the first big drop yesterday. 
Yeah, barts fuel are these 100x and 50x liquidations. Probably a new bot hunting these guys.
Overlooked both of those, you're absolutely right. 10x off a break of 9K is probably. 
Check the other reply too--he makes very valid point. Couldn't be 5x because it would have been liquidated yesterday when we were below this yesterday. It had to be opened since this dip. Probably on the bart up to 8400 or so, meaning it's probably 50x+, since 25x off the 8400 top would be down below 8100. 
I do. Also, here are some of your not-contributing, low-effort, trollish comments in the past 10 hours. And these are just the one-line shit comments I quoted, literally 80% of your comments contribute nothing.

So in the future, please do not dare open your selfish mouth against me about "trying to be constructive member" - you have done this a few times already, and you're not an example member either - far from it. In fact, you calling me out while you frequently place low effort comments should be a bannable offense because of targeting, harassment, and selfishness.

In fact, I decided to stop at posting your SHIT , low-effort comments after I got to "posted 10 hours ago". In 10 hours time, you have spammed the daily thread with crap comments contributing nothing whatsoever. What the hell is "oo ooo ooo ooo oo" comment even supposed to mean? 

At least my comments, even though I don't always back my predictions with charts, average more than 4 words per comment. 

Ridiculous troll!

I'm lost here. Am i doing something wrong or not. Sleep deprivation is starting to take a toll on me 
Sorry mate, I understood you wrong :\)
I'm not sure I follow. It feels like there have been a half dozen attempts to cascade into a BGD, and all of them were sold into tenaciously. We're getting precariously close to 8200. But honestly, I don't even know at this point. You might be right. 
Ah, so maybe someone is building a huge leveraged long at stable prices before dropping a 1K BTC buy on finex? haha
All I know is it feels like we'll know soon. 
Yeah I think I was a little trigger happy there well probably see some nice move tonight
!short xbtusd 8390 1X 100%
You realize that article says they made their own USD Coin which will be run on Ethereum, yes?

Where in that article does it say anything about them going long on bitcoin? Or hell, cryptocurrencies in general?

They made their own coin and now want to profit off fees + volatility. None of that is about adoption for existing coins
I make them rich so they stop texting me so I have room in my schedule for fresh meat 
With respectful dialogue like this, I can't believe we don't have more women in this sub. 
!short xbtusd 8205 1X 100%
You can always do it on the futures (0 rolling fees). The risk is that they will end up with a premium if we moon again. 
Three points:

On mex you'll get paid something if you enter limit orders rather than market orders 

As previous user pointed out, if you use futures that are rolling on a roughly 3-5 month basis you'll pay no hourly/daily fees.

Lastly, as long as you're short at least 1x your fiat value will remain constant. At some points you might even want to shift to the "perpetual" version to be short which charges fees because if you're short while the funding rate is >0 you'll actually be paid a small amount every 8 hours for holding a position.  Similarly, if the funding rate is <0 you'll be paid if you're holding a long.
It just hit the lowest price in the last 5 weeks.  That is not bouncing back and forth.  Anyway I see what you are saying, but chart suggests a bit more is going on.
Yeah, I saw that fuckharvey did something similar and I think he closed out a 12 million position after.  Incredible stuff.

Definitely beats daytrading if you can see a longer term trend and stomach short-term losses in the mean time.
Thanks.  My gut keeps telling me any hour now this could all suddenly turn around. It just feels like some entity or entities are artificially holding back the market.  
Shorted beneath resistance with tight stops on a pattern that usually breaks downward. Played by the books (even though we could argue this is a no trade zone) so nothing to be upset for.
Market just got the best of me. Old me would have shorted around 8200 afraid of missing a drop for waiting for the perfect entry
I had stops @8425 but decided to manually close while it was slowing down around the 15m BBand to minimize losses

So you’re assuming that most whales are short based on 3 people here (one confirmed) ? I know you tend to be bearish but I think that would mean we certainly wouldn’t be as high as we are now.
But when I see your name I do think the short side is your natural bias! What is wrong with that? We all see the world through filters of our own making and very few of us can see the markets completely objectively.
> I dislike harvey's attitude and posting style a lot, but funny enough that's what makes me believe him more. A lot of hardcore gamblers Gordon Gekko style traders have that sort of brash, narcissistic mindset (I'm the best, rekt everyone, money is a high score / measuring stick, etc.) so it seems plausible.

This is a terrible reason to believe the guy. You're comparing him with a movie archetype.

Beyond that, what does him in for me, is that he just doesn't know what he's talking about. He makes really weird assertions about market dynamics or regulations or liquidity or whatever and most people just accept what he's saying at face value. I don't though. I've asked him to clarify things he's said many times and he either 1) doesn't respond or 2) babbles even more incoherently. There's no way that this guy is the real deal and also doesn't know how liquidity works. He's simply putting on a show.

/u/fuckharvey, invitation's still on the table. Put me in my place and prove me wrong with 30 seconds on BitMEX. Very strange that you wouldn't seize this opportunity to make a fool out of me. Very telling, indeed.
I think your confusing the story here. He constantly talks how big his position and net worth are. He's the one being ignored by anyone with some sense about them. I'm simply asking that if he wants to be believed, respected or whatever that he do there very simple task of verifying that what he's saying is true. Takes no time at all on Bitmex. MikeXBT did this. Fuckharvey won't/can't. Speaks to the validity of his claims and his worth as a contributor here. Guy says all sorts of ridiculous things and almost none of it holds any water.

If you want proof, as him about his theory that lost coin = bad liquidity. The theory makes absolutely no sense but he'll rattle off a few buzzwords and most people will be content. Not me, his explanations make no sense because he's talking out of his ass and has no idea what he's talking about.

Guy's a fraud, sorry to tell you.
well people aren't really selling either thinking they will hold until this goes back up


7500 BTC and we are down to $6,000(and there is 13000 BTC total in buy orders)

6700 BTC and we are up to $10,000(and there is 13000 BTC total in sell orders)

the problem of course, is that so many people made millons off BTC that the sell pressure is going to be there for a while as they buy their mansions, lambos, and enjoy their crypto gains
no lol it's all speculation. It makes sense though 
Seems to me that Barts are the trend nowadays. 
It's not time for that yet.  Check out the usd shorts chart, that needs to go parabolic first.  So gotta lower or stagnate the price to lure more shorts.

Currently 1D BB is tight.  Last janurary or so when the BB looked similar on shorts it lead to a parabolic growth then a squeeze.

Edit: second half
I got shaken out of 1/3 of my short on that bounce back up to $9950. ...which doesn't seem like a lot, but it was a huge short and that 1/3 of profits that I lost out on was huge, especially because I was losing money on my alt holdings during that time.

I finally had the courage to update my spreadsheet a couple of days ago and wasn't as bad as I thought but still about 3.4% of my crypto net worth gone.  That is a lot.

And I was right...the worst is to be right and still lose money.  That has happened to me 100x in the past 5 years with this market.  

If I just had 15 more IQ points, I would be retired and living on an island.  This market just provides so many opportunities for profit, but I shoot myself in the foot repeatedly. 

And I'm doing just fine and crypto changed my life (and saved my life), but still doesn't erase or excuse all the fuckups along the way.

But I am still here..living to fight another day and soldier on.  We have lost many of our comrades over the past few years.  They don't announce it, but they crap out in the market and lose everything, and we never hear from them again. So we are the survivors, which is worth something, but still maddening to throw away easy profits sometimes.
I still cry myself to sleep about it bro
So you think you are going to be allowed to make $16,000 purchases without AML/KYC?   No way.

It will probably be something like $100, and maybe not even that for some sites, where people could make multiple accts to bypass the restrictions.
>The article is not the reason

Ah I see. I can infer that he's a trader who owns a dog that likes to chew on a toy :D
Yes, it would be more risk than I'd like, but I'm also missing out on profits and taking losses that I wouldn't if I were trading somewhere other than Bitmex. 

I've had to completely change my strategy these last few months because Bitmex is untradeable during big moves. 

If you've noticed, I'm entering positions **before** the breakout now, which runs counter to how I'd recommend anybody else trade the market. It's caused me to get stuck in bad positions, and I've also had a few instances where I've been spamming the market-close button to get out of position while my stop loss orders are completely ignored. 

The increased profits gained from being able to trade more effectively should outweigh that risk over a year or so.
Well, the market has already told one bear flag breakdown to go fuck itself:

Notice the strong push down and immediate pump to break back on the 14th. 

So why not twice in one week?

.....I'm supposed to be working. 
I'm short from 8300.
That's a good point.
Oh. Well. I think the only way that happens is a drop to 7800 followed by why everyone assumes is a DCB to 8200 to pile on the shorts, only to get rekt by a massive squeeze. Otherwise we won't have anywhere near to fuel for it. 
There was a ninja edit.

I'm super proud of the time I advocated for you. I radiate joy every time I see your posts... even your shitposts... 

Please don't shitpost.
This is a great question that I don't think I can directly answer. I can outline some options.

* Ask what other people have done. Ask for copies of communications they're received. Get a sense of what was done before.
* Dissolve any illusion of control over the appeal. Even if I were to directly advocate for Dushman myself, it wouldn't be up to me. I'm the newest member of the mod team and I deeply respect every mod that came before me. I'll make the call on something like this when I'm the last mod around.
* Figure out the actual cause of the ban
* Draft apologies and send apologies to who needs to be apologized to
* Figure out a way to ensure changed behavior
* I think you'll find that every perma-ban is unique. They're uncommon (for reasons other than spam). It's even more uncommon to have the ban lifted. Learn the details of your case and make it.
You're going to really need to dig deep on this. Dushman was unpleasant to more people than just gypsytoy. You'll need to flesh that out if you're going to make a good case. Dismissing people who feel hurt by their interaction with him isn't going to play well with the other mods.
> He's not nearly as rude or toxic to anyone else.

That's total nonsense. Most other people just take it and don't respond. I engage, which is the only difference. My assessment is not personal, either, as far as I can tell, I'm plenty tolerant of detractors and harassers. This guy is different.

>On his alt afaik he was only belligerent with you and that's partly/mainly because you were following him around trying to get him banned again.

Again, no. I wasn't even familiar with the handle. I had posted some (pretty HQ) tuna meme and he said I was "by far the worst poster in this entire sub", which I thought was a little strange coming from someone I'd had no interaction with and whose account was 2 weeks old.

>I get why you hate him but I feel like most of it is because of your personal arguments with him, not because he treated everyone like that.

Dude, he did. I don't know what you're not seeing. The only people he treated "well" (i.e. sucking up and brown-nosing) were you and chewtoy). Everyone else was at the mercy of his mood-swings and anger. **I'm not the only one who's commented that DK was on a whole 'nother level in terms of anger and disregard for his peers.** 

>Yes he's bearish and slightly rude

Unbelievable that you can characterize him as "slightly rude". I wish I could dig up some conversations from a few weeks ago on this topic. I am certainly not the only one to be absolutely appalled by this guys disposition.

You're way off base with your facts here, sloppy, and I don't know why you're putting so much effort defending *this guys* of all guys.
hmmm maybe think more than 1 minute how those dollars the Fed are buying with are created... hmmmmmmmmmmm
It's just ranging lately though so really everyone has been disappointed lol 
Can confirm, not same type
Mothers dead but thanks 
Well free money for everyone! Woo-hoo 
Why stop at $100k, it’s going to $1M so better buy the cheap coins now before the wall st bankers steal them from you for cheap /s
Manatees are large, fully aquatic, mostly herbivorous marine mammals sometimes known as sea cows.
I too expect this to wick up, 8200 is holding solid it seems. But just to be safe I will wait a little longer before buying
> I know a few people from this subreddit alone.

Even those I know who state they've 'cashed out' (generally due to degenerate losses), when pried, state they still do own some crypto & would like to re-enter on a crash.
What myth?
so they are in the all or nothing camp. 
yes but you can't magically get to their sell point of 5k without everyone else deciding to sell for no reason. There are % of people that won't sell until x time or y price. They recognize this an all or nothing investment. There is a % of investors that blow with the wind and sell at the first sign of danger. (they sold already) There are % that are sitting the fence...this is the demographic you are counting on to bring the price to new lows. I just don't think there is a large number of these fence sitters leftover waiting to jump to the greener grass.  The grass has been green for these folks on several occasions already....so most have jumped. We spent a couple weeks cumulative in the 6k-7k range and it was pretty nasty. 
Yeah I don't think this niche of people is as big as you think. YOu are talking about people that 3-4x up and have held through some wild volatility including a pretty substantial bottom 80+ in alts 60% + in BTC. Why are they all of sudden having this change of heart? I don't think this is a mainstream reaction at all. Will there be some? Sure those that are overleveraged or over invested. 
I wonder when he would panic close it. 8150? Sub 8100?
I have a profit taking limit order down near the triangle floor in case of just that. 
Looks like there are chances of 77xx or lower by doing a simple analysis of the above.

I noticed the dump rate is higher than that of the pump rate.

However, every time with a dump or pump, the percentage has decreased gradually.

    Dump   20,000 	 5,800 	345%	217% - Average Dump %
    Pump    5,800 	11,700 	202%	178% - Average Pump %
    Dump   11,700 	 6,400 	183%		
    Pump    6,400 	 9,900 	155%		
    Dump    9,900 	 8,000 	124%	Possible scenario	
    Dump 2  9,900 	 7,500 	132%	Possible scenario	

Given the last two equations and looking at average pump and dump rate, this has the potential to go as low as $7,500.

I still feel doubtful that it'll go below $8,000 and I have no idea why, apart from Mr. Green.

Good information, cheers! :)
Hahahahahaha fuck man I just didn't want to re create the poll after everyone had already voted

I mainly meant $78xx but the xx looks ugly af so I hate writing  it that way 
Bitmex follows the market, yes, but when the *higher* volume exchange follows the lower volume benchmarks, it creates situations where it's actually profitable for large actors to make silly bart dumps / pumps.
touché
hahaha NO... I just mixed you up with OP.

You doing great man!

By the way, I’ll be in Lisbon on Saturday. Let me know if you’re around ;)
Sorry, my comment was worded even more poorly than usual. If we operate under the premise that an actor is looking to accumulate coins around this level, then we can assume that slippage is a concern. You can reduce slippage by buying into higher liquidity, specifically sell pressure. So, to test the amount of sell pressure from a given point, it might make sense to make a ~100 BTC "test buy" to gauge how the price will react to that kind of buy pressure. I'm not going to buy 2000 BTC without having a really good idea of what my average entry will be. If I see that making a buy like that has little effect on driving the price up, then I'm more inclined to make my buy now. If I see that buying 100 BTC causes the price to rise and stay there, that tells me I need to wait for more sell pressure. I think that makes sense, trying to make sense of it myself.

edit: changed a word
Not necessarily leveraged. Do you think that's unrealistic? 
Could take up to 4 hours from my calculations. 

Right when i should be sleeping, specially having to get up early tomorrow.

Stopped once again. Better go to sleep, this is not my day.
Of course. It is what many would consider to be a positive externality to the entirety of the crypto space. Going long on anything in crypto is going long on bitcoin in 99.99% of scenarios that will potentially play out in the future. 
Potentially right, I just don't see a major crash on the horizon myself.  Market seems to be moving towards less extreme rises and drops in the medium term.  I could see things really starting to tighten up and go sideways for awhile at this point.  Don't think there's really enough momentum on either side to make a major movement.
That may just be bias. Most of April/May felt to me like some entity or entities were artificially pumping the market. Which may also just be bias. 

Bottom line, I ask myself "Why is BTC worth $xxxx right now" -- and if the most compelling answer I can come up with is "Because it *might* be worth $xxxxx later" ....I'm wary to buy in. I am bullish long-term *if* adoption increases and the environment (specifically tax classification) changes, but until it seems like there's a global environment conducive to adoption, I just don't see it. 

I'm trading to try to increase my BTC stack, not my fiat stack. I think in terms of BTC, not USD, because I do believe that BTC will be worth more than it is now (significantly) eventually. 
Nice
I've stated my reasons why I think the price will go down in the long term many times (look through my post history). Just because I think it'll be $500 in 10 years doesn't mean it's not tradeable until then.

Lastly, I couldn't give a shit less whether you believe me or not. Do whatever you want, I don't care if you lose money or not. I'll make money either way and so it's coming out of someone's pocket.
i've read about 100 of his posts and never seen him mention his net worth.  I'm sure he has, in posts that I've not read.   It wouldn't bother me, like it does members of a certain 'other' generation.



would a lower price generate more shorts though? I think shorts also learnt their lesson from 6.4k. I remember at that point shorting BTC was the meme of sure returns (which was accurate for a bit), and everyone was looking into how to short BTC. I doubt enough time has passed for people to pile in on the blind to risk side of the market. 

I don't think we'll see really anything parabolic in that sense, and though I was leaning more to the side of a long squeeze coming up, /u/gypsytoy pointed out that this isn't very likely due to the inherent risk differences between short &long. 

Edit: are you talking about the bband on shorts? or on spot?
> I finally had the courage to update my spreadsheet a couple of days ago

back when I took one of my biggest losses I avoided updating my spreadsheet for the longest time...it was so devastating when I saw how much I lost. Man, that sucked.

Glad you're only 3.4% down though...

And yup, the only reason I didn't get shaken out of all of my position was because my realized PnL from swaps was so high that the green untilted me into holding it through the pump. The funding rates essentially made my entry ~$10100, so I was able to hold through it with gritted teeth.

The futures position got fucked even harder cause the premium blew up...so naturally that's the one I closed. Although it's clearly the one I should have added to 

and amen to that last part. The fact that we're not liquidated and we're not just shitting our money away means we're doing better than most that try to trade...
Timing this market requires not a high IQ but magical premonition. If you're disciplined in your approach and make profit that's just fine imo.
Lol, ask chewy what's he doing about that trade ;-) he was on 100x
Not me, I don't live in US. I think the issue here is what you buy rather than how much you buy. Money laundering with plush toys and furniture 2btc at a time is an exhausting endeavors. 
> If this specific click-bait article 

If you think the opinions of the author are the only factor, then you are totally missing the point.  But ignorance is bliss, so at least you can enjoy that.

The news that is reported in the article is a wake up call.  To me and to everyone else.  I have been complacent about this and just wished that it would not come to pass but the day of reckoning will apparently be upon us, sooner, rather than later.
It's always a matter of weighing the good and the bad.
No perfect solutions...
Lol.  Normally I can keep an eye on things while working but today I'm fortunate enough to do some real coding.

So, after all, I opened a *tiny* short at 8322 basically in the middle of bart land.  Will double it if we go to the top of barts hair or when we break down (*if* i am watching then, which I probably won't be)

Man, the premium is all over the place.  While opening this positon from 60 to 10.
Possible scenario. Otherwise I am not really taking into consideration any posts with sub $8,000 remarks. Doesn't sound right, this one do, perhaps.
Promise! I am making an effort to be excellent even to trolls ;)

By the way, you are the mod that none of us degenerates deserve :)
I know you're less proud of me, Papa. I have shamed your honor in recent days.
It's hard for me to fathom what sincerity on these matters would even look like from DushmanKush. In my view, he's highly manipulative and will say what needs saying to accomplish his goals but that doesn't speak to his ability to change or feel guilt or responsibility. It's not the content of his posts, it's his attitude that just seeps through every time. He's not just joking around, he's actively trying to inflict pain on most others. Again, maybe /u/sloppysynapses doesn't see this because DK sucked up so heavily to him and chewtoy but I think this is plainly obvious to many other regulars here.

Guy's a sour cunt, pardon my language.

Still, even cunts can turn sweet sometimes, I guess.
Yeah I'm realizing that. Okay thanks. Who is the best mod to contact? Who did you contact for l14dys appeal? 
Okay you're right, will do some more digging, and it's possible I'm ignoring some really bad behavior here because he made me laugh and was nice to me, which is shitty of me. 

I talk to dush irl on discord now and i am inclined to think none of it is truly personal and he's just a big troll. I don't think, or at least I hope that he doesn't actually hold true disdain for bulls. 

I'll talk to him and see what I can get sorted out.

Ideally he will apologize sincerely to you and anyone else he's interacted with that left them upset 
Sorry. Bet she was a great lady. Rest in peace Mrs. Spencer
BTC is looking the same way at the moment.
I hope this guy is putting every single dollar of disposable income into it. Hell, if 100K is guaranteed, you're probably into loan/credit buying territory. 
I’m not convinced it will get to 1 million, at least not within the next decade.   100k within 3 years is very possible.  
That you can simply just crash the price down to 4k whenever you want to without owning any bitcoin.
To the contrary, I think there are more than you think. Chewy explains above.

Don't forget the early adopters from 2009\-2011 too, who may want to take some profit from this ride up, and will be 100xs up even now. Some of these guys will be able to sell after a 60\-70&#37; drop and still be millionaires!
I won't celebrate yet, but I can't say I'm not interested in watching for a panic 500 btc sell here soon lol
i might add a bit to my short here and do the same. The position i have is so small that taking profits almost makes the position disappear. 

Just want it to decide the direction so i can work on the bot a bit
Either way, I'm expecting we'll have a clearer picture in the coming day or two!
Oh, definitely. I wish we could see what the unleveraged volume through Bitmex is. If we assume 10x average, it's still 327M in 24 hours, or about 40K BTC. 

I have very little doubt there are lots of whales throwing around moderately sized market orders on BFX and setting support/resistance walls in areas of low orderbook liquidity, accumulating massive 25x leveraged positions on swaps, then hitting finex with market orders at prime positions to cascade the books. 

It's not really tin foil hat conspiracy nonsense, it's just the obvious play for folks with 1K+ BTC.
Exactly. Bitmex does about 10x volume over any other exchange. It *should* be leading the market. As is, there's just too much incentive for bigger players to load up on bitmex while the price is stagnate and then push it one way or the other via spot.
I'm in the north. If you ever come to Oporto let me know. Be more than welcome to show you around.
It's certainly possible. At least as plausible as any other scenario I'm seeing. 
How far on the horizon are you looking?  I can easily see this at $3000 later in the year...or $1000 or wherever they want to to put it....back to $15K if it suits their purposes, but it probably doesn't.

 It is out of our hands for sure and out of the hands of 99% of traders.
>Lastly, I couldn't give a shit less whether you believe me or not. Do whatever you want, I don't care if you lose money or not. I'll make money either way and so it's coming out of someone's pocket.

More bragging. Nice! Too bad you can't do a simple verification to establish that you are indeed in the giant position you claim to be in. 

I remain a skeptic. So much of what you say is just hogwash. Your lost coins argument is a prime example. I don't think you have a clue about what you're talking about. You're simply rattling of buzzwords with an air of confidence but real market and technical experts disregard what you say as nonsense. I have an incredibly hard time believing your stories about giant successful positions, given that you can't seem to explain something like liquidity coherently. Chances are you're just a big phone like so many others here. 

Cheers!


He alludes to it constantly. Position sizes, success, etc. Sorry you can't see it, bro. Everyone else seems to notice this pretty clearly. 

Not sure why you're defending him. The guy is a blowhard who can't even coherently talk about markets. It would be shocking to me if that guy were a successful trader as he makes himself out to be. If he is then he could easily prove it. Otherwise, most people with a head on their shoulders are going to ignore this babbling egotist. 
Check out the [daily on btc shorts](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/ZgP5LYKx/) and compare dates to the price daily at the same time.  There's plenty of peaks and drops, and a few huge ones.  We're currently flat.  So I don't expect a big move up yet due to shorts closing.
> back when I took one of my biggest losses I avoided updating my spreadsheet for the longest time...it was so devastating when I saw how much I lost. 

In early 2014, I lost something like 40% of my money and I think it took literally 8 months for me to get out of that funk and update my spreadsheet/finances and carry on. It's absurd that I had the luxury to disconnect for that long, but I did.

But I came back from that and have much more now, so just taught me that I can't afford to sit on the sidelines and sulk.  Got to get back in the game as soon as mentally possible, and there will likely be more opportunities. 

I don't expect this party to go on forever though, which makes it even more crucial that we profit while we still can.  If Wall Street ever really does come in and compete with us, it will probably be 10x more difficult than it already is. 


And how do you propose a site like gyft.com will know if you make 100 accounts to get around the limits?    The way is they will require AML/KYC for you to even spend $1 of BTC on their site.  
How are you complacent when you knew its going to happen for 5 years?
This is why people call us butt buddies.

I'm going on record saying we are not butt buddies. We're brothers.
Just dial that drama back ;)
Minus the ad hominems, you've summed up what mods will probably be looking at if an appeal comes to us.
I posted my appeal to the whole sub. In retrospect, a better approach would have been to click the "Message the Moderators" link in the sidebar. The effect of my appeal was to make a public apology on behalf of /u/l14dy , though.
> Okay you're right, will do some more digging, and it's possible I'm ignoring some really bad behavior here because he made me laugh and was nice to me, which is shitty of me.

Yeah, I have to think you're not seeing this clearly due to your own relationship with him.

>I talk to dush irl on discord now and i am inclined to think none of it is truly personal and he's just a big troll. I don't think, or at least I hope that he doesn't actually hold true disdain for bulls.

It's not about disdain for "bulls" or "bears" as concepts, it's the fact that he ruthlessly dug into contrary posts in a very personal and insulting way. It's one thing to parade around for your team, it's another to subtly dig the knife in and twist and turn while smiling and waving to passer-byers like everything is fine. He flips on a dime and feigns innocence and light-heartedness but his intentions were quite malicious. At least that's how I see it (and that's with taking my own interactions with him out of the equation). He's a subtle beast. 

>Ideally he will apologize sincerely to you and anyone else he's interacted with that left them upset

Like I said, I'd have a hard time believing an apology. It'd have to be pretty convincing but either way I'm not sure that should be a criterion for being unbanned. Honestly, that was not even upsetting to me personally (I wouldn't have posted that story if I were personally-vulnerable to harassment from internet-nobodies). I don't really care what people ad-hom me with. At the end of the day it's still just ad-hom and demonstrates fundamental weakness of their position. 

BTW, it's not like he ever contributed useful analysis, he just parroted others and feigned mental prowess. It's not like we have to put up with repugnance in order to hear his wonderful musings about price and markets. He was just a blowhard with nothing interesting to say and attacked people ruthlessly and with calculated precision. That guy played people against each other too. A true sociopath.  

Don't listen to me though, I'm no mod. I'm a nobody whose just grateful to wake up each day with my participation rights intact.

I have been putting all of my cash into it.  Irresponsible to take loans to do it though. 
Fair enough 
Ehh... if you believe the market is reflexive, then futures give you exactly the mechanism you need to do this via price signalling.
Fingers crossed.
This is what I speculate might be happening... either way, I'm going back to trading on bigger timeframes because everything below the 4h has become noise. 
yeah I think I still might not be explaining well, the goal of the 1K BTC buy wouldn't be to bring the price up, on the contrary, it would be to buy as much BTC as possible without bringing the price up too much. if you're buying the last 200 BTC in your 1000 BTC order at $8,600 instead of $8,400, that's no good. knowing that there is so much downward pressure would allow you to do this at a better price than if there was more buy pressure. 
he may not be successful, that's one reason to hide your positions.  I know gamblers tend to hide their losses.

Ya, I'm actually in a pretty similar situation. I lost a lot at the beginning when I tried trading and mainly when I figured out what leverage was, lol. 

I've only gone up since then (January) though so that's nice. I mean losses here and there but trading has been largely profitable since then for me. 
Do they sell guns, drugs or anything that appreciates in value or has good resale value in gyft.com? Money laundering traditional way is still much more effective than cryptocurrency. I think regulators understand this point but I will not be surprised if anything mindboggling comes off from Trump administration.
I have done some to prepare for this, but not nearly enough.  I was complacent, because I wasn't smart enough to not be complacent...plain and simple.   But time to take this seriously and stay focused.
brothers don’t shake hands... brothers gotta hug!!!
still eternally grateful
Well, I hope for both of our sakes it does hit 100k. I have enough that that would make for a much easier life. I'm far from convinced though 
but yet....its not
So then he's lying? I fail to see your point here.


That is very impressive and commendable if your assets have increased since the start of the year.  Got to feel good about that.  

I usually do well in bear markets, but just had some kind of mental thing going on early in the year and couldn't bring myself to short as much as I needed to hedge all my crypto.  It was just out of my comfort zone, but now that I finally have done it, it really was not a big deal to achieve, which of course makes it even more absurd that I didn't do it in January.  I chalk it up to temporary insanity of some type.

I've never seen the market move like it has been lately, but despite the BGD, BRDs, and BARTS, if you get the macro direction correct (bearish bias), then can still so well and sometimes be all in on some of those big drops.

Just like BTFD worked on the way up.  Short the F'ing Bounce works on the way down.
They sell gift cards on gyft.com.  They don't appreciate in value and of course some have resale value.
Who told you I'm a hugger?
The market isn't reflexive? Or futures don't act as a mechanism for price signalling?
it's always possible.  I just doubt it.  It's more likely he's hiding his positions because he took a big loss, already closed and re-opened, fears stophunters, etc.  I doubt he's doing it to 'humblebrag'.  He's too damn arrogant to care what a bunch of idiots online think of him.


The Spectacled Bear is sometimes known as the Andean Bear because they live in the Andes Mountains.
Too much hassle for money laundering. Or terrorism funding. Selling crypto OTC is a better option. I'm not familiar with gift cards in US, can you use them instead of debit or credit cards for any purchases?
its not being shorted to the ground
But he's not hiding his positions, he's flaunting how great he's doing. He wouldn't say anything if he didn't want to be stop hunted. And, either way, a lie is a lie. This guy isn't shit and his talk makes absolutely no sense.

But go ahead, keep on giving him the benefit of the doubt I guess. That's your prerogative.
With an Amazon.com gift card, you can use that for most (not all) purchases on Amazon.com.  Same with Walmart or Home Depot, etc.


? You were discussing if it could happen, not if it is happening.

> That you can simply just crash the price down to 4k whenever you want to without owning any bitcoin.

I don't think the options for protecting your positions are to 'say nothing' and 'divulge all your positions to randos online'
Binary thinking.  He loses some credibility for not disclosing.  Just like bitfinex.  Yet plenty of people trade on bitfinex.


Thank you. So not much useful for money laundering or terrorism funding imo. Gold, cash, guns, art works etc are much more useful. Actually the money launderer should turn his cash into crypto and cash out in a more favorable country. 
yes I don't think you can.
You're saying that he's attempting to influence the market by posting to this sub with some reverse psychology? Come on, dude. This story is getting a little ridiculous is it not. I'm going to go with Occam's razor here.
Right. So, since you don't think you can, is it that the market isn't reflexive, or is it that futures don't price signal? Just because it's not happening now, doesn't mean it *couldn't* happen, it just means that's not what the market wants. Arguing that something *can't* happen is different than arguing something *isn't* happening. 
im saying he's posting on the forum for the same reasons all of us do.. to get feedback, interact with a like-minded community, gauge sentiment.

I know rich people, from experience, like to both protect their privacy and display their wealth.  His behaviour doesn't strike me as odd.



I dunno man, most people know that sentiment around here doesn't mean shit most of the time and he doesn't ever ask for feedback on anything. He mostly just lectures about facts that aren't even facts. When you call him to task, he doesn't say anything intelligent or reasonable. His ramblings on liquidity and lost coins are a perfect example of utter nonsense that this guy was talking about as if it were fact. He's just a perma-bear who thinks that Bitcoin is going sub $1000 permanently. He claims that Bitcoin will exist in the future but only between prices of $100 and $1000, based on *reasons*. I can't believe your eating this shit up as if he's some sort of mastermind who's just playing his cards close the vest or something. Guy is a nobody pretending to be a somebody on the internet. Same thing with a lot of folks around here.
I don't think he's a mastermind, whale, or a 'somebody'.  I don't think that of any trader here.







I'm still unclear what you're suggesting then. Either way, I'm sorta sick of talking about this. The door's always open to /u/fuckharvey if he ever wants to make good on his egotism. Otherwise, I will continue to ridicule his pompous remarks as such.
