wow, down almost $200 during my shower lol
He sold.












pamp it.
Serious question. If you bought BTC for the altruistic reasons that people talk about (an FU to the system, deflation, savings equilibrium etc) then why does the price of 1 btc converted to USD matter? If you care about the price, it implies you are waiting for a gain to convert it back to FIAT which defeats the purpose.

Honest question.
It seems bulls and bears have shaken hands and now everyone is confused. 
Investing in bitcoin rn is like taking care of a sick child. You just wait until its done vomiting and having diarrhea then show it a little love without too high expectations. 
And down to sub $7k we go :(
Meh. Lambos are overrated anyway.
Here comes another red dildo month
It’s really very funny to see folks moods change sooooo drastically over 500 swings.  

Yesterday: this is awesome. I’m so happy I bought. Look at all this green. It’s going to the moon!

Today: omg I’m going to kill my self. It’s dead. China to blame! Get out. Run for the hills. Lol. 
Remember waking up to days like
"damn we didnt break 11800 today"
RIP 7k
FUCK ME - I've just learnt a lesson! I had a limit buy set up which I had forgotten about. It ended up buying a little bit of Bitcoin as it was coming down. What a waste of a few hundred dollars!  Learn from my folly!

Would you rather be a prisoner in jail for a year and come out being a billionaire for the rest of you life or only a millionaire? Honestly that guy is richer than Roger Ver now. At age 32, people die trying to become a billionaire at such a young age.
Hoping we can rally after that China tariff news.
Yesterday getting back up to $7.5k was a great start at a recovery, for the market to just slump back today is really frustrating. 
Dow just pulled a 500 point come back in one day Let's hope the same for btc 
No one said it would be easy, people that bought years ago had to wait a long time before they made serious money.  
The markets filled with so much pump and dump now that even guys like me don’t trust the market anymore. Another great piece of tech ruined by shady hands. Oh and for the alt account shills that will try to write strategy about my post. You’re the reason why it’ll be dead within the year.

This is painful.  :(
Im no expert at analysis but the last 4 (maybe 5) times it reached at/around 6200 it went up - maybe it’s nothing but just saying

My 12 year old son could make a deposit on a Lambo. 
I have found an old 12 word seed in some files i thought i lost. I cannot get the seed to work anywhere except in electrum, and in electrum its an empty wallet with no tx history. This doesnt make sense as i have tx written on my same paper that should be from this seed. 

Ive tried a multitude of things and searched online. There was a discussion about a guy finding a 2013 seed and there was a list of words that not all his words were on, but another list that they were, but after he says that the conversation ended there. Nothing about how to gain access to it
Got a feeling we are gonna see a juicy rallye now
Large red dongs
Personally I now think do not buy as the drop has surely not finished yet. Sunday was $6400 and Friday was $6600 still opportunity to buy cheaper later today or tomorrow.
Seems like there is nearly zero correlation between traditional stocks and Bitcoin. A year ago I thought that if the stock market experienced a correction, Bitcoin would do well. That hasn't been the case though.
don’t worry guys, you can still get your lambos. You’ll just need about 59BTC is all

Silly Bitcoin doin that down thing again. Other way now thanks. 
**Lets go Bitcoin!**
last chance to buy under 7k boys!!! Lmao
come down baby bitcoin so I can buy you and ride you for all you're worth
Well... I've been through many crashes from 2015 to today... Nothing new, except that now we're on the news all the time...
i mean like, who didnt see this coming?
That was a prime example of a bull trap.
I gave my 2 month old son a check for 3 thousand dollars. He said he wants to invest in bitcoin instead. Im holding back my tears. Im so proud
if you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention
Rise you magnificent bastard. 
The whales are trying to make you think the price is dropping. You can clearly see the last few hours where they dumped and the price went down like 3 times. But then you  also see the price gradually go back up naturally by us normal people.
It's time for another rally soon.

My tax return came back but my wallet didn't come in yet. I've only ever made small a couple small purchases on coinbase but I'm looking forward to using an actual wallet with a decent chunk of cash
Can we get it over with, please?

I'm not selling, but I also can't buy anymore. So this price level holds no interest for me...
I wish I could see the expression on some of the fudsters’ faces the moment the line of giant green dildos come.  Would be priceless. 
Cheap coins everyone!

lol bitcoin dropped because Mt Gox CEO did an AMA on reddit, would you look at that rofl
Dropped straight into the golden pocket and rebounded out.  Should go up from here, wave 2 here we come to around 7900 with a 1:1 extension
everybody please dump there shit and drop to 1k.... sick of this shit
What I don’t understand is how will bitcoin or any alt coin be used to pay for anything when it’s so volatile. Say you take a payment in whichever coin pick your favorite and then the price dips like super fast then what? Also say you want to cash out your crypto don’t you have to pay a fee like thru Coinbase or Gemini? So it isn’t really free payment after all is it?
I think general trend looks positive - strong support at 7k.  I wouldn't be surprised to see 8k within 48 hrs.
what a great $50 run. TO DA MOON 
Inevitable decline as expected to $6400
**Come on BULLS!**  **Show us you are alive!**
I said I wasn't going to do anything today because I was mad at America for being weak while I slept, but I bought anyway because of those hot hot prices. Today is looking better than what happened last night. (I'm in Japan) Sadly, when the east coast of America wakes up and they see the hard gains Asia (and I hope Europe when you guys get up) have made they will go all limp dick and fail to keep it up and sell for gains again. 

Prove me wrong, America. Do something for the rest of us today. 
Here's some good news: BCash 8th by trading volume today.  That is terrible.

When Bcash finally dies, the cryptomarket will take off again.  I'm convinced of it.
Fuck bitcoin. This is so laughable it's pathetic.
It’s been a rough couple of months but I have a feeling things are going to turn around for bitcoin soon.  Last few days of bullish activity was a good sign.  This sudden drop back to 6k range won’t last long. 
Hold on to your hat boys...100k imminent.
what is the news for today?

Look 👀 at me closely. eye to eye. FUCK MT GOX. now lets move forward.
Oh dear!
This is not feeling good.  perhaps capitulation in a scary way will come.  Confidence could get destroyed.  It certainly is getting close for me.
Have we hit bottom? Can I buy now? 
I asked yesterday but didn't get a clear answer. If I want to accept bitcoin in my shop, what do I need?
https://imgur.com/a/z0UF1
Stop talking about the price and use bitcoin for the technology. Buy vacations, furnish your apartment, settle debts etc. By using it and therefore giving it a value outside of speculation you will increase the adoption and therefore long term value. It's a great currency to use. So use it. 
So it was “mooning” at 7400. What do you say now?
While I *do* believe that there's a lot of market manipulation going on. 

What some people here attribute to the *"whales"* is just ridiculous! 

A lot of the price changes, e.g. "gradual growth and then sudden drop", have always been typical for free markets.

That's "market psychology for dummies".
Let the downfall begin boys. 
looks like whales try to put up fake sell walls to convince ppl to sell. lol
[removed]
So who is it now?..Don the Con?..China?...Cartel?
you must be a fool to think btc will go up to previous height like in december. Average joes are all gone. Where do you think new money has to come from? It's not that bitcoin is dying, there are just too many people already in it. Most of these people are positive about btc and crypto, but no new money is coming in cause average joe is not going to get his ass burned twice. Conclusion: btc will go down under 1000. No new money means price won't rise (enough), which means people will lose their patience and sell, bringing down more and more holders with them. 
I'm so bored with bitcoin lately
Bitcoin: 39. My portfolio: 0.
Are we going lower than 1 April dip?
I heard a cryptocurrency ad on the radio this morning in Quebec from financial advisors who say it is risky and to do research before investing as you risk losing it all. Was fun to see how it is slowly reaching out to the world.

Well.. we might have a new resistance 
bitcoin chose this path
Ok lol

**Bitcoin to Hit from $10,000, to $100,000 & even $1 Million USD**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9bmMWi-O54

Due to Bitcoin's revolutionary "blockchain technology", Bitcoin's has a potential to go up from a $10,000, to $100,000 and even $1 Million USD, per Bitcoin.

Bitcoin has proven to be the best performing currency in the last 5 years. Not since the internet was released, Bitcoin is the most important invention the world has ever had, and [almost] no one knows it yet.

Everyone can video chat for free, to anyone across the world. Now, with Bitcoin & blockchain technology, practically "anyone in the world" can send money directly to "anyone in the world" (in a Trusted & Decentralized way) without using a costly third party (like PayPal).

They say, it will happen despite of the level of belief & understanding -- just like in 1994, when people didn't believe "Internet shopping" and "Email communications" would work for the masses.)

Note: The population of the USA is ~320 Million People; and there are only ~16 Million Bitcoins in existence. The World population is 7.4 Billion People; and there will never be more than 21 Million Bitcoins in existence (which will happen around 2140) ~ Everyone can't have "more than one" Bitcoin.  (When will you get your "more than one" 1 Bitcoin?)
Where are all the “mooners” now?
As expected, the China tarriffs will make it go down, especially since it's on a downtrend now that it couldn't hold 7000. Just look at the 1 hour candle on gdax, there couldn't be a more obvious down trend signal, at least short-term.
Thanks bitcoin for ruining beach 2018, I will be fat from eating all slaughtered bull meat :S
failing to break 7k about ten times. pathetic.
Would be nice if today was all just one big bear trap.  
WE ARE SINKING!
At least for the time being, Bitcoin seems to be little more than a plaything of daytraders who are trying to set traps for each other. Unless some *fundamental* of Bitcoin changes drastically one way or the other, it looks like the price is going to continue to meander sideways for a while. Food for thought at https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/regulation-and-apathy-hit-bitcoin-market/articleshow/63546481.cms
The powers controlling this sell off want complete capitulation and then they will start buying. If you are still feeling at all hopeful then you are not where they want you yet.
[deleted]
Where can I track the total number of bitcoins being sold and the total number of bitcoins being bought daily? Is there a site that tracks this for all stocks?
She just could not hold support at 7! Breaking that bottom means finding new resistance. It's now anyone's guess as to where or when; considering chart metrics are being blown away with recent inconsistencies. IMHO: Trade war fears are affecting this market too, and ALL are going to be sideways and trending down testing new lows (beware the usual bull and bear traps along the way) until things get hammered out. 
ridiculous 
Anyone think we will see a big green candle in the next couple of hours? 
Uhhh... So a huge Russian celebrity (Olga Buzova)  just announced her own cryptocurrency (BuzCoin) and I am scared it's going to take people away from BuzzCoin :(. https://youtu.be/jqFg5JGHIjg
Question, is this true? Or even partly true?

Wallets like exodus and Mycelium are all running “on top” the Bitcoin Core wallet. Does that question make sense? 
I’m considering making a tutorial on the core wallet and a teacher of mine said this, but I’m not certain. (Maybe the tutorial will stay really simple)

Are all the Light wallets running bitcoin core wallets behind the scenes, with the core wallet doing the work and exodus just being a nice user interface on top of it?

Thanks
Was Binance hacked?

What are your thoughts on where Bitcoin will be price wise and apoption wise in 5 years time? 
🎤🎵When you walk through the storm, hold your head up high.... 
I have a buy order ready at 5940. I have no idea why, I just do.
Imo widespread adoption is a ways off because of what happened in December and January. Bitcoin made headlines, and started pulling in investors who typically wouldn’t be interested in bitcoin, but didn’t want to miss out. Then once enough got in, bitcoin bit back and hard. The drop was amplified by new money being concerned of a sharp drop in value, causing even more selloffs. In order for bitcoin to be adopted more widely, it has to stabilize to get those investors who risked it and lost the first time, to invest again. 
The more widely-held a belief that the existing trend will continue, the less likely that it will. Markets hit the bottom not because of the appearance of buyers but when the sellers stop selling. 
This is an impressive pump. Hope none of you guys shorted. 
I think a lot of us have lost site of the big picture. Short term up swings and downswings shouldn't determine if you jump ship and sell. Where is bitcoin going to be in 2022? 2030?
What in the world!?!?!  Everyone is still here talking about BTC and the cryptocurrency markets?  I took a few days off, sure I'd come back and find everything worth a nickel... and then I'd make my big move....
$6900 (on GDAX) the new line of resistance? 
5.5k boys get ur dicks out
Imagine in a few years the bitcoin you currently hold might be worth 10-20 times its current value.  Consider how much better your financial security/happiness would be at that point.   That thought makes me smile even through the tough times we face today. 
Under $5000 in 2 months.
Going down to 4-5K, will see a bounce back to around 7K but it’s all downhill from there. It’s been a downhill drive since ATH but they still buy the “dip”. 
Bitcoin down this morning due to China announcing new tariffs on the US in retaliation.

I am a HODLer and optimistic on long term but let's face it, the bear trend continues. No need to fool ourselves around with small ups and downs.

https://ibb.co/gK15ux

I keep my stance that we need more lava building, more adoption, more development, more pressure from people and more people waiting on sidelines to enter.....

So far that pressure is not big enough to break through.

But the question is that will that pressure be big enough to be sustained and take us to all-time-highs again in 2018?
Ok, this got to be the last dip before the pump. Or this is truly being suppressed by the so called “Cartel”. Makes no sense. 
Hard to have confidence in anything that it’s followers refer to as dildos. It already has a nickname. “Candle” 
[PSA - Message of the day. ](https://imgflip.com/i/27gshp)
Think, the more that sell, the more that gotta buy back in the momentum pump to moon. 
Looks like we have another faction keeping it from falling below 6500 because that's what it costs to mine a Bitcoin
[deleted]
$6500, here we come. Just like 3 days ago.
BTC is dead. Its time to move on.
The people will still believe in bank system until their money is not available anymore 😂😂. Then its the time for us. 
The big drop will have caused doubt in the market. Tonight I think Bitcoin’s value is more likely to go down. 
I would like to sink this ship lower honestly, then start the water pumps.
Tone Vays says we are testing 4900.  Which sounds pretty realistic. 
Time for the real flush out, plz!!! With a little dab of volume, moon it is 🌙 . 
$20k by 8 am boys and girls! 
red dildos!!kkk
I bet some of you will scream 'to the moon!' again when btc goes up again next time. Fact is: party is over in 2018. We're in a long term downward trend and the end/bottom is bearly visible, even if you use your binoculars to try to catch it. The moment suicide hotlines are set in place, is the moment you need to invest in btc. People need to die first, jump off the golden gate bridge, before you're able to get your lambo. 
How low?
A scammer could get over 2k likes, why can't bitcoin go under 6k? Only the good deed suffers.
So weak. 
No sign of the hash rate dropping yet.  Presumably there will be a price point where miners start dropping out of the pools?  
Hope the value gets more down.
So someone put child porn into the blockchain and germany is pretty pissed
What I want to know is when the government is going to address bitcoin?
[deleted]
6.5k has not been able to attract new investors.... nobody wants to buy now, only wales pump and daily trading action....I love the btc and for a healthy and lasting climb I want sub 4k price
curious if there is anyone here who voted for hillary or bernie in 2016? my hypothesis is there are few big govt supporters in crypto and the socialists are going to use the state to try to steal our crypto?
