Daily Discussion, May 12, 2018
Did some chain analysis on mt gox recent transaction of 8000btc.  The Bitcoins were transferred to a newly created wallet.  0 BTC is spent from that wallet.  Most likely this was an OTC sale to a private buyer, far as I can tell, no trades were done via exchange.   This is a very good news, looks like he is selling mostly to private whales that are in it to HODL.
Bitcoin is the same as the weather in The Netherlands. 3 days ago it was 28 degrees, yesterday it was 13.. today we have 24. Hodl.
Another Bart simpson completed
I wonder why all the naysayers come out of the wood work when btc falls a bit in price. I'd much rather see discussions on the tech. I'm getting tired of coming to this sub. 
Bullish.
Exciting times. Can't wait to power-blackout alone after work. 
FINALLY SOME GREEN! The past few days have been absolutely dreadful .. blame upbit!
Anyone ever hear of a restaurant called Fudruckers? Just wondering who their clientele is.

I sold at 8200 and buyed again at 8600. I went full retard. I canâ€™t believe that happen to me, I have experience in this shit.
The only thing Ido is to buy when it drops, then I hodl... Never sell... Will sell  in time...
Let's go!!! 
Houston, we have lift off!

Posting again due to unasnwered q, n00b as hell.

I transferred BTC to my Jaxx wallet 3 months ago. I can see the transaction on block chain.info if I search the address, but it's not appearing in the wallet itself.

What happened?
Should we still be optimistic for next week's conference? 
The Bart â„¢  has returned 
Bart Simpson is back.
Someone should make a video with a bitcoin and this song in the background, haha

Looks like a bart simpson pattern forming
"this has GOT to be the bottom"

"ok, THIS is the bottom."

"HODL onto your butt, I guess"
We recovered when it was night in the US and dumped again at around 9-10am EST. Just sayin, this isn't Korea anymore. Get your shit together Murica.
**Keep fighting Bulls!** 
oh wow shorts being murdered rn
Damn, all those "$10k by Friday" predictions crashed and burned. Just shows you how volatile the market can be for Bitcoin.
Great chance to buy the dip!

Donâ€˜t say: I should have bought at $8300.

This is the double bottom. Itâ€™s going up now.
Judgement day is upon us!
I just woke from a dream that BTC had passed $12,000. In my sleepy headed excitement I checked my phone and literally the opposite has happened 
Be me.
buy the day befor yesterday.
buy yesterday.
today: Welcome to goblintown ....
Havenâ€™t really been following the news lately, why is everyone saying itâ€™s about to go back up again? 
Does anyone know how many times weâ€™ve crossed 9k in the last month or so? At least 5 times right?
lamee 
What a tiny drop I donâ€™t know what you all were crying about. 
Morning, are we still expecting the market to go upwards with the Concensus Meeting starting on Monday 14th May? 
Just bought some more BTC in the dip. Thank me later for single handedly initiating a massive moon run. Yip, definitely all me. ðŸ˜œ
In what price is the current support?   $7800?
going below 8000 this time
I don't know why people are so concerned with short term gains. Realistically the price won't change that much until technology catches up to push block chain to the next step where "Normies" will be able to easily access cryptos. The sad truth is most people are low IQ and don't understand technology or it's implications. The internet has been around since like the 70s and 80s... but it wasn't widely accepted until maybe the 90s and didn't explode until the 2000's. It's important that we have patience and stay focused. Bitcoin will skyrocket but it won't be overnight. Just slowly accumulate bitcoin and don't look at the price. Think of it as an investment that will payout in the future, if you get caught up in day trading or selling every time you feel FUD you will get tore up with paying taxes on it. 
See you all at 5k

Quick question: Did the removal of Net Neutrality influence the major drop in BItcoin back in December? At least through FUD, right?
I think I am going to put a footnote on every one of my post's that has the name of an initiative, a token or a coin in it. I'm getting sick of all the FUD accuser's on the crypto\-subs. Is that the only acronym these people have learned besides going on about moon shot's, Lambo's and whatever support's the immature theory's.

It may go something like this:

And to all the FUD worried paranoiazoid's out there. NO, THIS IS NOT FUD!!! This a coming from someone that started researching this shit, probably before some of you we're twinkle's in your daddy's eye's.

Hey hey heyyyyyy, bitconneeeeeeeeeect!
The best part about these drops is watching the reversal and all the shorters scramble to get back on the ship they abandoned moments before... Iâ€™m making popcorn now
one of my opinions; a whale has just sold bitcoins bought at MTgox for a private sale, and sold its own wallet ... what do you think? would it be possible to influence the market this way?
Just more proof it can't sustain itself.
My stupid ass tethered at 8200, now it is 8500. ðŸ˜± Hope it will fall down to 7k.
Dead cat bounce. Next stop 7k.

#never10kagain
