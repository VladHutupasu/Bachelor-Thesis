Daily Discussion, March 21, 2018
I believe I'm a very special person around here, because I really don't have a fucking clue if it will go up or down from this moment on.

But it doesn't matter. I like the tech, so I hold.
Do these morons that make new accounts to dredge up old fud think they're really having a significant impact on anything? 

I suspect they're probably a small part of a large group working on many different sites spreading dissention and uncertainty to try and scare people away from participating. Just continue to isolate them as normal and they seem to delete their accounts quickly.
i want to be a bitcoin whale when i grow up
Twitter Founder Jack Dorsey invests 2.5 Mil in Lighting Labs and his other company Square has started integrating BTC into its payment processing system. Dorsey sees BTC as the worlds currency in 10 years from now. IMO this is very big news and brings significant credibility to BTC as a form of transaction. He is highly viewed in the tech industry and on wall street. He's always been one step ahead of the game. 

Buckle up for MOON
Walked away to make my tea when it was @ 8.8k and came back to a little above 9k. Seems too good to be true.
all is fine, what do people expect? 2000$ jumps every 2 days? if we hold the 8.5k for now, we will be fine for the rest of march. just relax, ofc idiots like goldbergerr start to post here after the 300$ dip, those posting histories give me eye cancer
Just a few whales taking some profit, I think we will go back above $9k shortly. 
LOL I love these people who disappear when the market is moving upwards, but the second there is any sort of dip they magically appear with the FUD.  Keep up the great work guys!   
Kicking myself that I didn't buy couple of days ago, looks like it's only upwards from here. But there's always a high chance of another dip after a whale decides to dump, I'll be waiting...
9500 today !!
it feels like an eternity since the last bull run... dealing with crypto has really jaded my perception of time hahaha

phew
I get the feeling a lot of day trading is being done while people are at work , using the fast corporate internet connections of their employer, or to afraid to let the spouse see what they are doing at home?  
So all you people commenting about missing the dip, now is your chance.
I plan to sell when my average price comes($9900) and rebuy if it crashes again. Anyone want to talk me out of it?
Looks like we'll see close to 10k before the Sunday lazy asses brings it back down
The daily candle shows this has been a completely useless day for holders and a decent day for traders. Moderate volatility but we haven't moved an inch, a mere Open/Close $10 difference. The good news is we're once again out of the downtrend channel [red], but we still have to break the negative trendline [orange] which slapped us so hard on March 5. I don't really trust trendlines myself but that's where media would tell everyone that Bitcoin is alive and kicking, therefore mitigating the recent FUD and possibly attracting new investors.

Somebody make a 

$8900|   •    |$9100

Pong gif
Anybody who thought we would soar past 9k without a bit of dumping and profit taking is a fool. 

Anybody who thinks this dip signals a reversal of the upwards trend we've been seeing in the last couple days is a fool. 

When it falls below $8500 and keeps going then you can start worrying. (even then I wouldn't 'worry' tbh) Until then stfu about a laughable $300 recline. 

Stop acting like children with the petulant hand-wringing every time the price isn't moving upward. Have some dignity people. 

Reminds me of [this](https://youtu.be/qhmZSHOCOCw?t=1m39s)
My theory is that whoever is posting all the same FUD over and over is basically 'spending' their reddit karma to post over and over. Today has been full of these accounts posting the same few topics, then having those immediately downvoted and remarked upon, then deleting them as they've failed. Since the negative karma will stay with the user score that posted, eventually they'll have to 'refill' elsewhere in another subreddit, or make a new account and pass around karma to each other. 

What a cancer in our daily thread. Mods, is there a solution to this? Higher account minimums to post won't really work since new users won't be able to participate in real discussion. It seems like heavy moderation is needed particularly in this thread.

**Edit - I'm not referring to the poster here as a cancer. I'm referring to the posts that permeate this thread as such.
10K by Friday. It's happening.
All systems ready to go.... activate buying mode...
**Calling all whales, we need you to Buy, Buy and Buy some more today!**
Hey mods, just an appreciative shout-out to the structure of rbitcoin recently.  Love the daily thread, and the different vibe it has to the rest of the subreddit.  Whoever had that bright idea I owe a beer to.
The wait while the BTC stays at a stagnate level is the best time to come to this thread. Predictions and arguments about said predictions are the purest form of cringy entertainment.
I'm cool af, I've just thrown some more money into Bitcoins right now. :v
I like how my stop loss got triggerd at 20 euro above the lowest point, then jumped 150 back up in seconds
if i was a whale i would be as unpredictable as possible 
If I was a whale, I would be a whale.
Not very up to date; is Coinbase still a trusted platform for buying decently sized amounts of bitcoin?

The higher the Market cap the higher the Tax Revenue.  Its the Greatest Transfer of Wealth for both Citizens (mainly early adopters) and Governments.  AS the market cap of crypto grows Countries may change their stance as they see it as an opportunity out of their current mess.

Good morning everyone, $9500 today and $10000 by the weekend perhaps? we can hope.
**Twitter CEO: Bitcoin will be the world’s ‘single currency’ in 10 years**

https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/21/17147574/twitter-ceo-bitcoin-jack-dorsey-square-interview-currency-10-years
Can we be honest here... the only reason 99% buy bitcoin is to make money from the price.  
We need America awake as soon as possible I think.
Slow down, let me get my space suit on. We are mooning! Lets just hit the all time high of around 800 billion marketcap for crypto and my year is already finished. 
I wonder if whales are suited booted when they sit in front of their computers. I mean do they stay professional and tidy while doing pump and dump or just a random guy getting up and start dumping? What do they look like when doing a pump, I wonder. 
Can we afford a few days of side ways action or do we need to get past $9500 today?
Those green flashes tho
HNNNNNG
To the moon!!! all time high will be hit soon.
Buy the dip!!!!! 
YAY. RED DILDOS.
Most players who’ve been here for awhile will agree with this. Although it’s always good to just be cautious. To the weak hands just do what you feel is right but understand the consequences and make an informed decision based on proper research, market trends, and your own gut. Sadly unregulated markets can be manipulated by assholes but you can also make money and respect the idea of Blockchain and how it can actually be positive.  
Buy or not to buy...

Any guesses why the bitcoin UTXO count decline has stopped? Fees are still low...

I can personally guarantee nobody right now is buying at an all time high. So we all won't be THAT guy.
Do you think BTC will ever drop below 8800k again?

**Lets go Bitcoin!**
I try not to be bias with anything, I honestly think this is a terrible time to buy....we know that the big boys want to make money, big greedy never ending money... A dump begins now and a bounce around 7200k res.(Watching btc charts and reading new news every few hours since 2016)
 
Buy the dip! running to 500 billion marketcap in 2 days.
Like, what!? Huh? Why? How? Just like that a huge dump? From where? Why now?
This little pullback seems totally fine to me so long as we can find real buyers here and propel forward. So as long as people dont panic over nothing and stay strong, we can easily move up
If it doesn't go down its going to go up!
Get the 9k meme's ready!!
How to tell if we are out of bearish market ? 
Bitfinex is back
Yo TA guys. What do your predictions say ? Where are we heading next ?
Guys who have been around the block...without been bias to BTC... Does this look like a bull trap. Were all those loooong green candlesticks just the tether printing or whales buying loads to get everyone else on board before dumping...?
deres de top
and here we go, get your 7k memes now! Ahahahahah
Operation dump has kicked in
Come On Whales, put some of your huge profits back into the market, we can't do all the work on our own! 
If a whale is someone who owns a bunch of bitcoins, I must be a dolphin...

Mumble in the jungle, home sweet home 6,5k
Why tf can't we break through 9k?
How do i set up lightning network?
Just waiting for btc to rise this May :)

why falling 
So 8kish volume a few hours ago and turned 44k and those i think r sellers.
Get ur 5k memes rdy for uploading bois

We're dropping anchor soon 


HUGE bear trap over the last 3 Days. This Hole thing was the masterplan
Oh oh...trending down. Here we go again. Teeny weeny profits. Sell off time! 
I don't like the recent rally. It pops and stay very flat. I can't  scalp intraday as much as before :|
I always notice once BTC starts moving up, the amount of people in the sub jumps from 9-10k to 13-16k and almost all are the “Redditor for 3 weeks” guys just spewing SELL SELL SELL FUD. Then the price does go down a bit and they disappear and everything stabilizes. This cycle has been happening for months now. I wonder if they are part of those large sell groups that all pool cash and raise the price meanwhile spreading misinformation making weak hands sell cheap then they dump the market for profit and could care less about the actual idea of Blockchain. Leeches can suck my dick 
Don't be shocked if there's a second wave of dumping soon. Many people slow to the draw the first time around are going to wait for the price to bounce back again and then take their profit. 

Just be cool.

My very rough estimate for the next hours. Not to be taken too seriously.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/zRP1U9h5/
some one by like 10 coins plz 555
With 300mil USDT issued yesterday they should pump the price to 10k easy......Or anyone got another explanation why they would issue it if it is not for buying btc?
It's time for fomo
why is bitcoin so unpredictable
If this is indeed the making of a bull trap it’s pretty well effin orchestrated.  Fomoing out my mouth currently
dump o clock is back?

Yes, it was a bubble

No it is not done popping

I watched the Internet bubble pop,  and crypto is behaving in a very similar pattern to March 2001.  It was tax selling then and it is tax selling now.

BUT,  the upcoming 'tax deadline dump'  will be a dud.  Why?  Many will simply file,  not pay their taxes,  just eat the penalty, then endure the interest thinking things will recover shortly.   In 2001 they didn't,  the tax overhang lasted years as people saw the interest accumulate,  yet no recovery,  and they couldn't hang on and sold at great loss. 

edit:  I put originally wrote pump,  it was an expected big 'dump' just before tax deadline that didn't materialize in 2001,  that is what I'm assuming will happen this April,  the tax selling effect started late Feb and will last well past April 17.
How high will the ATH of this supposed next bull run be? Taking into account the last ATH after crashes, i would suggest >50,000.
The bears are gone. Market going back up and will hit 1 trillion by years end so basically any coin you hold right now is gold. Next short ride will hit 450 billion marketcap. Would not even risk dumping because like I said 1 trillion by the end of the year min. We always want to make profit and guess but if it's at this price now and hits 1 trillion at the end of the year who cares. We just hit 800 billion marketcap a few months ago. Could honestly be 2-3 trillion by years end. Just get your dart boards out and toss money at any coin and you will gain over the year.
It's 5:05PM est and we're down to $8888....Are we still looking at a likely dip of 500-1k over the next 24hrs? 
Just heard info that bitcoin will be over 12k in one week. Good news!
According to my TA, it looks like the price will go up, down and sideways in coming hours.

probably going to test 8.5k again
What caused that enormous spike to 8k? Or is it just some random bullshit?

Came back to wait for Harold. 
Has there been independent and unbiased confirmation of the porn in the blockchain?
Wow! all the charts point to 12k in a day. Amazing. I don't see it but if the charts are real btc will hit 12k then the jump to 25k. Been here for years and have seen how it works.
Falling wedge on the 30m chart. Let's see if we break through it.

Has anyone heard the recent news about child porn links on the bitcoin blockchain? I'm not surprised this happened, it seems inevitable. This is the double edge sword of the immutable ledger.  This seems like a good way to attack bitcoin, by outlawing running a node because "they contain illegal material". Any thoughts on how to approach the issue?
Whales are about to dump I say. Mostly because i want some sub 7500 coins to buy before we head to the moon.

I said it would bounce off 9000 then go down. The last pump averaged 9000, now it's going down. N O S T R A D A M U S.
Double bottom?

Edit: Guess not.
You gotta love when the three white soldiers get fucked in the ass by the whale. What a movie.
No reason for this to be up From what I am reading there is some very bad things looming on the horizon for Bitcoin such as abusive photos of children, SEC, and also the devastating taxes that are already in place. I believe in Bitcoin but I am very scared to purchase any right now.

THIS PUMP IS A BEAR TRAP, BE WARNED!!! 

THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO POSITIVE INFLUENCE FOR THIS SURGE IN PRICE OTHER THAN IT BEING WHALE MATING CALL.

 ONLY 1,000 INDIVIDUALS OWN 50% BITCOIN MARKET, A FEW MOUSE CLICKS AND THEY CAN ROCK IT WITH A SHRUG. 

STAY SAFE!
