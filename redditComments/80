‚ÄúTemporary reversal, then paint a bull flag‚Äù
I wonder how many BTC you guys have who freak out over a small drop. Looking at BTC in terms of minutes, months is not worth it. You should be looking at it yearly and question yourself "what has changed? is it going to disappear? do I believe in bitcoin?". Once you answer those questions you can determine if this is for you or not. 
Well at least volume‚Äôs up! :P
"Get Vitalik on the line."
I feel like the events of the past 24 hours have lead to some knee-jerk reactions leading to the market cap taking a dive. And I can't blame people because everyone has their own reasons to HODL/Sell/Buy more. But if you take a step back and look at these things:

* Gox Whale = The sale of assets over time will help remove some of those spike sales we see (eventually)
* SEC + CFTC = Should help bring confidence to new investors wanting to enter Crypto
* Coinbase Index = Help/incentivise investors enter Crypto space
* Binance = Problem addressed and resolution scheduled

I can truly see it leading to a stronger foundation for Crypto over the next few years. And I think anyone still able to HODL who bought at the ATH will make decent profits over time.
wtf happened???!?!??!
Giving a bot that you personally didn't program access to your trading account is beyond retarded.
Fuck^Fuck^Fuck^Fuck^Fuck^Fuck^Fuck^Fuck^Fuck^Fuck^
wtf is happening :D 
it's time to buy, anyone with me???
Took a nap , was gonna buy at 9600...
Woke up, almost 10k again. RIP
Haha, no comment might be best for now!
Can someone explain what I was just watching a minute or two ago?  (Where BTC is at roughly 10750 and has these fractional seconds of dropping to 10500?  and then back, and so on and so forth?)  It reminds me of unexpected turbulents on approach for landing where the plane drops a thousand feet out of nowhere.

Is this all because of bots?  Or is this somebody making a buy/sell order mistake?  Are these whale attempts to break sell or buy walls and trigger auto trading algorithms?

They just look really out of place, so I was wondering.
The market needed a good shake up, it was getting too boring...hopefully back to the early December rise!
Witness me
MTGOX btc selling fast
already got few texts from people oh its going to $0. told you so. Dealing with troll friends is getting annoying. 
Panic selling Vs. FOMO, this will be interesting.
Binance is not good at finance 
These daily threads are unbearable on days like this... chill the fuck out people. Bitcoin isn't over and dead, it's not going to 3k, and it's not 2013. Sell and go away if you want, but don't cry when it's at 40k later. People with billions of dollars are buying what you're selling now.

Kill me now and don't activate quantum immortality.
It's like somebody threw bitcoin into the lake wearing cement slippers.

The fuck is causing this?
Man, I wish it didn‚Äôt take so long to transfer funds from bank to  gdax right about now. 
Anybody here a degenerate poker player? I‚Äôve called more money on the river with ace high than BTC has dropped today...hodl‚Äôn 
Fud is over settled at $9700 should bounce back over $ 10 000 by tomorrow hold on 
Today could've been a lot worse.
Whale dumping is good for bitcoin. Why? Because it spreads the ownership. The more individual owners the more relevant as a currency it becomes.
See y'all at $9,800 when it hits bottom and then it goes up past 12k! 
Goodbye 10K, nice knowin' ya.
thanks to Binance people get some cheap bitcoin. 
[read the bottom](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-03-07/cryptos-are-suddenly-dumping) 
ok some one posted on twitter this 
"Binance: We are investigating reports of some users having issues with their funds. Our team is aware and investigating . The only confirmed victims have registered API keys (to use with trading bots or otherwise). There is no evidence of the Binance platform being compromised.
YTD +694.64% LOL.

Ah, watching that nice tiny cute green 1H candle fills me with joy, hope and serenity :)

Now you guys on Bitfinex stop keeping the price down or I'll rip your fucking heads off.
LOL SEC ain't getting shit. Go crack down the penny stocks of pump and dump altcoins and blockchain related scams.. 
who knew MT Gox could still come back and haunt us after all those years. I wonder what the MT Gox hackers have to say.
[deleted]
So the trustee said that he will consult on further sale of the 165k of remaining bitcoins. Meaning every time it goes to a high enough price he will sell.. and crash the price.. what are your thoughts about this? I'm afraid this could mean possibly a year or more of a bear market.... 
#iboughtthedip
Yes, just day trading. Soon everything will be green, then red again. And over and over. No bad news, no good news are impact cryptomarket. Its simple-its all about shorting.
Unfortunately Mt.Gox issues are still here.

News like this are with huge impact to the market!
https://www.google.bg/amp/s/www.coindesk.com/mt-gox-trustee-sells-400-million-bitcoin-bitcoin-cash/amp/

I also wish to have bullish market, but reality is different. Idk what to say, just be careful with your investments.
everyone is playing hot bitato
**Binance was not hacked: "Trading bots (API) compromised. Altcoins sold for BTC, then BTC to VIA. Withdrawal were blocked quickly. Everything is fine, Binance itself isnt compromised. People gave access to their trading API to shady bots online."**
LMAO weak hands sold it all off so now im buying again. Under 10k im buying like crazy. Ive already made so much. Wow.
So... how low will it go? I‚Äôm thinking not too much. If it goes sub $10000 then buyers will jump back in.    What have you lifers observed in the past?
BTC, go home. You're drunk.
This makes me fucking mad

Isn't it good that now not a single person owns so much BTC that can cause such drops 4 times over again, but the coins will be distributed among thousands of people providing stability and less chance of sudden dumps?
This is so enoying lately üò§ to dip it goes very fast, to recover it takes ages.. and it doesn‚Äôt goes above 12k anymore, people are not interested! What a fuck is going on?
And now we shall rise from the depths of hell 
this is pure comedy
what the entire fuck
Wtf? 11.6 to 10.5 to 9.5 to 9.8
Seems like I have to deposit again *sigh*.
If my funds were available id buy $9.5k - 50% and hold 50% to see if it drops more ...but $9.5k seems to be the turn back up......
great price was waiting for sub 10k for the past few weeks
lol what a morning. It looks like bitcoin pierced its 10.5k support and was immediately dumped to its next support at 9.4k, where it bounced off. Didn't think it would go that low tbh. The last time it touched 9.4k was the last bear run at Feb. 24. If it does manage to break 9.4k then bitcoin's next support will probably be at the mid 8k.
SEC just announced that all crypto exchanges have to register. Wonder what the process will be and if Coinbase will be quickly approved. 
Bitcoin will go up tomorrow, not down. This was a small panic drop. Asia will buy the dip.  
[deleted]
Bought some more. 
I'm not sure how the trustee for Mt. Gox liquidates BTC but they should be doing it OTC or have an auction process, similar to the US Marshals, to limit the market impact.
I am inclined to convince myself that if there was going to be a panic sell-off as China woke up, it would have already happened....
it looks like china and korea prefer to sell tonight :(
We shall climb Mt. GDAX! 
Ok, you have permission to take off Bitcoin airstrip is clear. FUD is clearing up. Let‚Äôs go!

BTC, you such a little child, you did your little caprice, now time to act like a man. End of the week will be interesting i guess. \O/
Can these tards stop messing with my gains already? Its bad enough I had to sit around while some Mt. Gox goyim cashes out on me, now I have all of Asia selling. Don't you all realize if we keep buying together we can all be rich, after I cash out?
Just watched a video about Facebook, Google and SpaceX plans to conect the wolrd via sattelites, bringing internet to 5 billion new minds. SpaceX is already launching prototypes into orbit. They expect those sattelites to go online in 2025.
Add to that next bitcoin halving in 2020 and i think the next decade is going to be quite interesting.
What do you think ?
I'm just gonna buy and HODL at this point. Going in an out is not worth it lol.
It‚Äôs down, oh well! Buy more or sell and leave the market. Enough of the cry baby shit, and hoping to get rich overnight. Damn, feels like there is just kids investing in this shit. The whole market is in its infancy, only speculation at the moment, so prices will drastically fluctuate. 
Nice 1H green candle you have there, Mr. BTC. Now make another.
seems like btc is ready to go moon 
Ok i bought more lol no regrets 
I believe bleeding has stopped. Took the chance to buy more at $9.8K. \*crosses fingers\*
lolz decentralized my ass. 
Fud army spotted. Bulls where following a woman wearing a red robe, they will come back. Bears had enough honney for now.
You guys might wanna check your Binance account, there's been a hack going on via API keys. auto selling Alts https://www.reddit.com/r/BinanceExchange/
It‚Äôs dropping hard in a short time. Approaching $10200.


Almost 600$ gone in a couple of minutes :/
It was a quiet dip..normal..no big deal.. small screams.. to *silent horror shrieks in the mirror*
Biggest red dildo in recent times lol it also fucked and crashed the bitmex shitty system
welp 
Ride it out boys, otherwise use this chance to make a bit of profit when the dip stops. Now Where's my crystal ball? 
Well I guess volume is now up to above average, that's a positive :) 
Yet again, all alts lose more than BTC during big sudden dips. Dominance over 42%. Interesting...

What has been happening in the last few months? Bad news and FUD aiming mostly at BTC but somewhat BTC is gaining dominance again. 
Ledger wallet <3
holy shit 
I don't think this is FUD. Altcoins on binance got dumped for bitcoin and then used to buy VIA. This would be an ideal way to transfer wealth after a hack
A bloody great time to be a whale. 
Yes this is the bitcoin we need.. The love hate relationship is back again. It was so boring in the last 1 month wherein it had a painfully slow rise and drop.. It's like it almost lost its charm.. The last 30 minutes feels like the crazy phase is back! 
So this will be remembered as the Binance Fiasco. I'm curious to see how long panic selling will last.
Catch that Knife Boys!
Stock market tanking  as well, could see another 1000$ dump on the DOW
dat red candle beeg
McAfee hasn't even tweeted about this hack yet, this gnna go down further.
panique xbt french. vente 0.5 xbt pour 9.6k acheter a 11k . et erreur par dessus achat  1 xbt a  9.3 k :-) ?

Some bear is building up 70 btc sell walls as low as possible
lol I'm reading so many articles full of FUD today
Anyone else expecting a mad rush to the exits on binance once the withdrawals open up? Lol whats another 5 billion in total market cap loss?
Come on Asia, make us proud.

Yay some money transferred and I had a little extra to btfd! 
We need fresh new 10K memes.
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7g9cd3/its_official_1_bitcoin_10000_usd/
My condolences to those who missed the flash sale
Any brave souls who got in at 9.4K?

edit: 9.8 for me
Where my 10K memes at?
Bitcoin is getting ready to rumble. The jackass that dumped 350m worth is gonna hold now. No one says he is going to sell unless he wants it to go down (to buy low). This is a no BRAINER. 
GOOD MORNING CHINA!  Nothing happened while you were sleeping I promise.
Is this due to Binance resuming withdraws again?
Noob question: why so much more volume when the price dips hard? Is it just that many weaklings selling? Bastards
Guys relax, Bitcoin is not dropping much more. At least for now.
guess its Asia's turn to panic
Notice how each of my points were attacked by new accounts... Shills in full swing with this FUD.
Tom Petty - Free Fallin‚Äô 
Is the bearish market because of the BTC of Mt. Gox getting shorted?
Hold? Hodl! Yes this is HODL.
Lets start the weekend well folks, we can get back to $11k by late Saturday!

back to 6k whoooooohooooo 
Hey but was the hack Binanced ?
Crazy day indeed
buy buy buy shits gonna spiike
BCT over $20k by May 1
10k hype!!!
This is clear manipulation. It steadily climbed sideways from $8k-$11,700 and yanked towards $9k. Certain investors are attempting to derail crypto before it even has s chance to become viable to more mainstream users. I can‚Äôt wait until these assholes get ousted. 
Please go down so I can buy more 
why are people complaining hahahahah literally short and buy back in when its finished dipping and its easy profit. I love it when bitcoin does this.
This isn't about FUD, it's about professional traders trading - buy low, sell high. I don't know why so many people continue with their HODL ideal. That might have worked for the first 8 years, but crypto, just like everything else, changes. The rise in December was the breaking point for most of the financial sector. They finally "got it" and they have poured in. What does that mean? It means we have hundreds, if not 1000s of hedge fund managers in this now, people who are extremely risk adverse and who control significant amounts of capital (i.e. they can make the market move). They buy BTC at $9k and they sell at $11k. If they control just a 1000 BTC (which is EXTREMELY conservative) they just made $2MM for their clients. Why the hell would they HODL?!? They are fine with playing that $2k gap from here until the market gets big enough that most of them can't move it anymore (i.e. that's when it gets into the tens of trillions). BTC is not going to $20k this year, in fact I'd be surprised if it hits $15k. If you HODL in the market how it is now you're better off just unfollowing groups like this, putting your BTC and whatever else coins you have on some offline hardware and coming back in 10 years. It's a waste of your time and everyone else's to keep screaming HODL when all that's going to amount to is you seeing your portfolio increase by $2k one week and being down $2k the next (rinse and repeat). You have to play their game or just seal everything up, leave and come back in a decade and tell us how rich you are because you held.  I'm sorry to tell you this, but if you don't want to trade you're probably not going to make jack s%$t this year, or next, or next. I'm not saying you shouldn't throw some $'s into this coin or that coin on dips and keep building, but the cold hard truth, just like in the tech boom, is that most of these coins aren't going to make it, and (spoiler alert) BTC probably won't either. It's King now...and so was IBM. Who the hell is going to wait around for 15 minutes waiting for their coffee at Starbucks while their BTC transaction processes especially when there are dozens of other coins designed to do it faster with lower fees? Things change, so should you.
Oof

Time for me to snipe some discounted Bitcoin. Probably sell one it hits north of $11k again. Cheers.

TO THE ASTHENOSPHERE!!
You could see on GDAX the plunge hit a wall of GTC limit order buys at 10,000.  It's chewing trough them as I post.  
And here goes the dump.  What floors me is the huge stack that was dumped about an hour ago.  Really suspicious... uncharacteristic dump just minutes before the market has a sizable tank.

Even Vegas is regulated.  
Is the price dip just due to FUD as a result of the Binance hack? If so, why do we see parallel trends in all other cryptos besides BTC?
what will be the low?. Because i so want to buy now. But dont want to miss the new low. will it go 6k again before bouncing back up or will it hover around 8k? I am ready to click the buy button but holding myself back lol!
And I'm sat here waiting for my euros to transfer to Coinbase->Gdax. Hurry the fuck up will you, I got buying to do!
Damage report: how bad is this? 
And all my money is between transfers....dammm
people who own viacoin buying lambo's
Was binanced Hacked??!?!
Imma wait for japan... then ill decide to buy or not
Buy buy buy
...just noticed its on sale again...what's the FUD of the day?
What's the deal with RLC? How is it going up in this moment?
Asia coming online shortly. White-knuckle ride ahead? 
Here comes Asia!
Do you guys think Asia is gonna bring the price higher or lower (short term)? Bought in at 9500, debating if I should put in a bit more now and HODL, or wait a few hours and buy the rest then.
Perhaps a double top?
What a day it has been...and it's not even over.

What's going on with RLC?

Anyone excited for those dank all time lows?
Sharks are sniffing up the fear. I expect some blood in the streets.
Now what ? What do we do ?
So how long will it take for this Mt. Gox guy to dump the rest of his btc? Months or years?

$9001.62. That $1.62 really does something to the psyche. You better hope it holds or c'est la vie.
bitcoinforecast.com now have a long term prediction for BTC at $50. Comments...? 
bla,bla,bla... btc is in downtrend,strong downtred from 17 dec, i am btc fan but now is sell time,open the eyes..... 6k,double bottom..... at least double bottom.....
TIME TO BUY!
is it safe to breath those bitcoin miner hot air? I see some people are trying to mine bitcoin inside their home on youtube, is it safe to do so?
I am thinking we will see the mid 8Ks in the next few hours. :(
#come on bitcoin!!!!

#hit us with one of your damn dip!!!!
Well I guess this will definitely weed out the weak hands.  Didn‚Äôt know we had so many left. 
Is it recovering?  Should I wait before buying?
I would buy, but BoA banned crypto purchases
I only keep some BTC to pay for my VPN, and they‚Äôre fun to watch. So, I know absolutely nothing about any of it. 

But it‚Äôs taking almost 5 hours for a payment I sent, super small amount & small fee. Under the status it says ‚Äúinvalid‚Äù which I‚Äôve never seen before and didn‚Äôt have much luck trying to google it. 

I go to check it out on Blockchain.info to pretend I might know what‚Äôs going on, but there‚Äôs nothing. Five hours later and there‚Äôs nothing there except the address I sent it to. 

And now the entire transaction is missing from my stuff. All others from before are there. 

It‚Äôs only $5. I just want to know what happened there lol
Somebody tried to shoot down my balloon! Those bastards! Patching it up right now. Hoping to be back to an altitude above 10k feet soon. Please bring along extra fuel for the ascent. 
Dont get too comfortable. There's no strong conformation indicating the price will rise. I can see the ppc going lower than it did later in the month. 

Not financial advice ;)
....And, que up the sell-off from China and Japan. Sell it all now!
I leave for vacation..Friday morning... im going to buy... 1 boin.. and go away... and not be able to check price... someone send smoke signals of price thanks

Do u guys hate that I only see an opportunity to short bitcoin when it goes up
Penetrating sub 9.5 K levels soon
When China and Japan wake up tomorrow this is all over. We will see the price plummet to sub $4000.
I think BTC is coming to an end here folks, if it cant operate without exchange hacks, its over. Cant you imagine if someone hacked the Nasdaq
You guys literally get so pissed off when I talk shit, but has bitcoin found "support" at any previous support level? No. It keeps going down.

It's the beginning of the end.  China and Japan are going to sell hard and the price will plummet to around $7000 by week's end. It is already starting to happen.  Get out now!
