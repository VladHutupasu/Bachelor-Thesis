Daily Discussion, April 07, 2018
After extensive research of about two minutes. I have concluded that the whales are trying to make a 2D platform game. Look at the last 24 hour. Tell me that doesn't look like a Super Mario level.
Trolls, they mostly come at night, mostly.
To anyone thinking Soros authorizing his portfolio managers to trade crypto currency is automatically bullish, I encourage you to look up the trade he is most famous for...
772 Bitcoins traded in that spike on GDAX.

Ah, the Daily Thread. The best source of pure, unrefined FUD and autistic screeching about how terrible bitcoin is and how we should all feel bad for having anything to do with it.




The real test is trying to get past 7.5k, which was the previous high. If it doesn't get past 7.5k, then it's another failed attempted like last time, and so many other times.
Wait, is MrManHimself still posting on here? I blocked him yesterday for spouting the same unsubstantiated negativity over and over and over and over.....While he thinks what he is posting is very clever and insightful, all that he is doing is spreading FUD and using "brilliant" hindsight to try and prove his point. I have never seen anyone with so little of a life before. If bitcoin dies, I will move on with my life, go do something else. This poor basement dweller spends hours on this sub, trolling and spreading FUD for all he is worth. All he is managing to do is showing that he is actually a poor sodd that lost his shirt with bitcoin and he is so scared that anyone else can be successful. So scared bitcoin will go to the moon, he cannot go on with life. All he has ever done was ask for proof or ask "what do you really mean by saying this or that". Not one valid point ever, not 1 shred of proof for what he is sprouting except: bitcoin did this and bitcoin done that", ignoring the fact that bitcoin also did GREAT in the past. I advice everyone to block him. The peace from silencing him is worth at least 20 bitcoin. Don't bother trying to reply to me MrJokeOfTheSub, I will not see it anyway. NOTE: r/bitcoin: a community dedicated to bitcoin. If you do not believe in bitcoin, then go away, we do, and no amount of trolling or FUD from you will change that. Side Note: I am truly sorry for your financial loss, but how about giving others a chance?

Edit: spelling
I like how everyone just assumes there is going to be a breakout and the thought of a stagnant price not being a possibility. It seems like a large group of this subreddit expects that the price should and will be rising by thousands per month. I'm convinced that most people here know very little about how any of this works and likely bought in months ago while the price was higher.

How many times has it been now during this drawn out downward spiral where, we see a brief upswing, and everyone comes out of hiding saying "we've hit bottom! 6900 has major support!!!11!. If it breaks through though, it will hit even large support at 6400. If it breaks through 7k then it will continue up until 11k." ? People are really pulling this all out of their ass.
>Mods, please ban immediately

u/MrManHimself is WunderBaah.
We may actually push through 7k.

Interesting.
I promise you someone here was taking a shower when the price pumped. It always reverses direction when one of us are in the shower. They love phucing with us. Lol
How about a $1000 increase every month.  So around $15k by December.....
Somebody give me a xanax, we are back under 7k.  I'm freaking out over here.  Hopefully the extended release version.  
If people can stop selling from prices $7k to 7500 will be fine;) 
Such a low volume. The last months this was an Indicator for a drop coming. Lets see what happens 
Going Down to $6650 to complete bart simpson on the hourly
Does anybody have any experience accepting bitcoin at their business or paying in crypto at a local small business?  And if so do you know if its easy for the Business owner to convert to Fiat?  And any idea what the fee's are associated with accepting crypto and converting to Fiat ?  
Careful guys, this might be a trap.
good girl
i dont trust this shit, $6.5k again tomorrow.

There's something fishy going on. I've been watching the charts for the whole day. Then, when I had to do some shopping for a few minutes, the price shoots up.

It's always like this. I kid you not!
Could be because of this anti-FUD regarding India?

Bitcoin’s 24 volume on coinmarketcap is only 3.6B USD which is quite low, and is only around 3% of bitcoin’s total marketcap (116B right now). What does this mean in terms of price fluctuations ? Is it a good thing ? 
What was that?

Hey, a 24-hour gain...
If anyone interested in buying BTC 500$ cheaper than market rate the. Let me know. Payment should be done in advance will provide all ID proofs for verification of legitimation.
Pump doesnt last that long or does it ?

Holding above 7k.

This is the Soros effect (publicity & endorsement) - whether you like it or not.

And being a clever man, Soros will build BTC, not destroy it.
The price is slowly going down, which is usually a good sign for another pump coming. Whereas the price slowly going up is a sign for an incoming dump...

Really just the opposite of what one would expect...

how secure is the protection of a password protected electrum wallet?, can upload to a remote server?
Anyone got any hypothesis on why BTC is still hovering after the 6.5k crash?  

This seems very different from previous crashes (10k on 17 Jan, 6k on 2 Feb, 7.5k on 10 Mar).  In all these previous crashes, BTC recovered very quickly.

Any guesses will be appreciated.
Fuck these last few days, it's anyone's guess. Impossible to trade, if we break 6900 we should be going back down for a bit, if we beak 7100 we're going up. But neither of these has any support it's just flat lining. I do believe that we are just about through this bear market tho.
I went to a show called Drunk Shakespeare in NYC last night. They improv throughout and at one point an actor used a joke about value disappearing and referred to Bitcoin. This reminds me of mainstream mania at the top, but the opposite

Alright, tax season is over. Let's start this up again. We see there a Bitcoincash now. That has to go. It confuses new users. One thing I realized is that US customers is all that matters with regard to price. Refunds are coming now and if the community cares about the future they will keep it simple and easy rather than needing a computer science degree to operate. We see lightning is coming on but without uers, whats the point to scale? These hardforks need to stop now. Mistakes were made and passions ran high but lets move on and ignore the 8/1 fork and move on with 2nd layer. We need better interfaces. Coinbase hurt the market more than anythingby allowing bitcoin cash on its services. If they keep allowing hard forks, no one will invest. There is one bitcoin. adding blocks is just centralizing miners to have more power. Coinbase would be wise to get ride of bitcoin cash and any future hard forks. Enough ideology of the free market will decide. The free market are uneducated and we are just confusing new users. Enough. Apologize, remove it, focus on adoption and ease of use and lets go. This year will be the last time the current generation gives bitcoin a second look. 2 weeks all.... enough of editors allowing FUD. Lets get this right in the next month and take back the years lost that bitcoin cash and coinbase cost us. Get to work.

A breakout happening now? https://youtu.be/4WyukZ6oYgA
Watch out guys, now that Soros wants in, I wouldnt be surprised if he hires people to spread fud online and then short the price.
I think Bitcoin will fall below 6000. 
The Sun literally just came out from the clouds at my house and then i checked the priced - could be a good day...
Any predictions on the weekend dip?
Bit of a speculative question but wondering if any of you guys have had this before...Trying to sell my Bitcoin on Bitpay. When I click on Coinbase and Sell then put in the amount it says "Connecting to Coinbase" then "Error. Unknown error" and won't connect. Also, when I try to buy Bitcoin it says "Error. The access token is invalid." I have bought and sold many times this way previously. Any ideas what's going on?

When moon?
Why do Bitbugs think Bitcoin replacing the current fiat system would be better. Have you seen the concentration of wealth that Bitcoin has among the top 100 wallets?? The world would be bought for and controlled by chink miners.
"Doublethink lies at the very heart of Hodl, since the essential act of r/Bitcoin is to use conscious deception while retaining the firmness of purpose that goes with complete honesty. To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact that has become inconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary again, to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed, to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one denies-- all this is indispensably necessary. Even in using the word *doublethink* it is necessary to exercise *doublethink.* For by using the word one admits that one is tampering with reality; by a fresh act of *doublethink* one erases this knowledge; and so on indefinitely, with the lie always ahead of the truth."
If it hits 7-7.2k im shorting. :)

Edit: why all the downvotes? Lol
**URGENT PUBLIC-SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT: REGARDING 23 APRIL**

*From:* https://www.inc.com/business-insider/stripe-no-longer-accepts-bitcoin-payments-goobye-april-23.html

"Stripe, the $9 billion online payments company, is putting an end to the product that enabled retailers to accept bitcoin as payment.

Citing a decrease in use by both retailers and customers, Stripe said will wind down support for its bitcoin payment application and stop processing bitcoin payments entirely on April 23.

"**Empirically, there are fewer and fewer use cases for which accepting or paying with Bitcoin makes sense**," Stripe product manager Tom Karlo wrote in the announcement. 

When Stripe first enabled bitcoin payment process in 2014, advocates for the cryptocurrency believed that it could be a cheaper than credit cards like Visa, which charge seller-side customers a fee on top of each transaction, and more accessible to people in part of the world without banks or stable currencies. 

"Our hope was that Bitcoin could become a universal, decentralized substrate for online transactions and help our customers enable buyers in places that had less credit card penetration or use cases where credit card fees were prohibitive," Karlo wrote in the blog entry. 

*That hope, it turns out, was misplaced*."

**END OF PSA**

**URGENT PUBLIC-SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT: UNDERSTANDING LIMITATIONS OF BITCOIN**

*Borrowed from*: http://www.scmp.com/week-asia/opinion/article/2122500/why-bitcoin-fever-bubble-waiting-burst

The cleverness of the underlying technology doesn’t mean that bitcoin is viable as a form of money. And it certainly doesn’t mean that the legions of punters rushing to buy bitcoin as an investment for the future can be confident of earning superior returns, or indeed any returns at all.

Enthusiasts like bitcoins because their supply is limited. The pace at which bitcoin “miners” can create new units automatically declines over time, with the maximum possible number of bitcoins fixed at 21 million. To converts, that limit means that bitcoins, unlike the fiat currencies issued by the world’s central banks, can never be debased by governments intent on printing as much money as it takes to pay off their debts.

Yet despite their scarcity, bitcoins possess no intrinsic value. Unlike hard commodities – copper, say, or even gold – bitcoins have no utility value. And unlike securities such as bonds or stocks, bitcoins do not carry the promise of a future cash flow that allows investors to put a hard figure on their value today.

Bitcoin enthusiasts argue that much the same can be said for fiat currencies. With interest rates around the world close to zero or even negative, conventional currencies also offer no income streams, and hence carry no real value. They are nothing more than an illusion, a confidence trick perpetrated by cynical governments on their gullible populations.

But that argument misses a crucial point. Fiat currencies do have an inherent value. The US dollar, for example, has value because the US government insists that Americans must pay their taxes in US dollars. And if they fail to pay their taxes, the US government will send them to jail (unless, of course, they are rich enough to employ expensive accountants and lawyers to devise legal tax dodges). That threat creates an underlying demand for US dollars which lends the currency a real value.

Without similar backing from a government, bitcoin lacks any inherent value. Yet even if it were to win the status of legal tender, bitcoin would still have critical drawbacks. In particular, the very factor that enthusiasts like most about the cryptocurrency – its limited supply – ensures it will never replace conventional currencies as a widely-used form of money. That is because if the supply of a currency is limited, and the quantity of goods and services in the economy grows, it follows that the price of those goods and services in that currency must fall. And if prices are falling, businesspeople become increasingly reluctant to borrow to invest, because they would have to sell ever more stuff to service their debt. But with falling prices, customers defer their purchases, which means selling stuff gets ever harder.

In short, the widespread adoption of bitcoin as a means of exchange, unit of account and store of value would depress demand and discourage investment, leading to economic stagnation and a rising real burden of debt. It would be a disaster.

Bitcoin could still have a useful future as a specialist means of exchange for internet transactions. However, no one is currently using it for that purpose. Instead it has become a vehicle purely for momentum-based speculation. But with no intrinsic value to support prices, and with alternative cryptocurrencies springing up by the hundred and threatening to negate the very scarcity that is touted as bitcoin’s chief virtue, the bubble that last week propelled the price of bitcoins to a record high is clearly unsustainable.

**Read it again.  Carefully**
S.S.D.D
Hi everybody, I have a question about the time of transactions. I've sent a little amout of bitcoins on some website, the website says that my bitcoins will be credited after 2 confirms, is anyone knows how long would it take now? And is there any services that helps me to to estimate the transaction rate and time, cause I used to send money by stellar, and thinking about using credits blockchain with the fastest tps, however I'm dealing with bitcoins now. thank you.
