Price seems to be tied to the McAfee-Dick-Line. If it stays that way for the next 2.5 years, I'm totally okay with that.

8.6k seems like a solid base. will stay in these ranges for a while, volume will get low too. 

1 year ago: $1200. 
9k! A real milestone!

Someone should come up with a meme for that...
Make your own decisions. I repeat, do not listen to ANYONE if they think its going to 8.5K then to 5K or they think its going to 11K... etc.. 

It is your own money. Invest wisely, do not FOMO into anything. Stay away from TradingView opinions. MagicPoopCannon is an example that "helped saved"  thousands away from the 6.6K BTC to 9.5K BTC rise.

You make the call. Your profit margins are entirely yours. $100 USD profit or $1000 USD, or $100,000 USD, whatever your level of risk suits you best and makes you feel COMFORTABLE. **WHen you trade outside of your comfort zone, you make mistakes.**

Also, have a plan of when the price of BTC goes to 11K. Have a plan when the price of BTC goes to 5K. What alts do you want. What does your exit strategy look like? Before you buy, always have an exit plan and consider all possibilities. Like i said before when you trade with a smaller stack, you are alot more comfortable to make bolder decisions. You don't have to **kill it** on each and every trade. You just have to protect your capitol, and sometimes that means cutting losses. In other words, trade gently, but if you are not trading now, start coming up with plans on what you want to do!

Edit: also learn to spot trends. If you miss out on a run , there's always a retracement. Every single damn day is an opportunity. Just because the price went +15% doesn't mean you screwed up. It means that you have to keep looking and scouting. In particular look how bull runs and bear dumps look like, and what they look like before, during, and after. There are stages to these things and you can spot them over time with a few months of practice. Don't even invest. Just watch the charts and learn. Put in $20 just to test. Try to turn your $20 into $25. You do not have to kill it on every trade.

For example. I missed out on the run from 9250 to 9377 just  now. I sold at even. I do not panic nor do i fomo, or regret selling at around my buy-in price. My goal was to cash out some alts and go back to fiat. I know there is  a retracement opportunity, and even if you miss one retracement, there are more coming. Each one with its own characteristics.

Here's a simple "trick". Set a stop buy that anticipates retracement because #1 you don't have to commit to anything, and you control the buy in price after its proven its strength. As an example you set a stop buy of BTC at 8950  after BTC goes to 9075. There's also shapes you need to recognize, flag, triangles, and of course, the shape of bull runs and bear drops. Runs / Drops occassionally look like vertical lines, but more often, they are bubbles along the way. Lower circles ('soggy bottoms') and upper circles  ('top bubbles') appear on movement up and down, and there are thus 4 types 

* lower circles + price up = strong movement 
* lower circles + price down = descending but keep an eye to buy soon 
* upper circles + price up = dampening movment upwards.. look to sell soon
* upper circles + price down = possible whale movement downwards! 

Also of course look for pre-volume pump (high volume , relatively small price movement).. Tons and tons of things you can learn every day.
Vegeta！
My TA shows a clear Caitlyn Jenner pattern forming
Once it hits $11K it will go directly to $20K. There's not gonna be any more dips, bear markets, pump and dumps, or any more distractions. It's gonna be a one way bull run. But we need to hit $11K first. 
**Support The Bulls**
Meanwhile, over on the naughty step:

What are Jihan and Ver's miners going to do with those tens of thousands of Bcash tokens they've been earning and holding?   (Releasing them would collapse their own price.  And you even buy the mining rigs with Bcash you know!)

They have already agreed amongst themselves to 'burn' some to boost 'uptake' (read: 'price')

Although that might in itself be a lie and a marketing strategy.

There is also the hardfork of Bcash coming - but many wallets and exchanges are unprepared.  And some people think it is one of those hardforks with free coins - nope.  Nothing free.  No 1:1.  Just a slightly new version of the scam coin.

Someone is bleeding BTC and other assets to boost that lying coin.  It can't last - it is starting to collapse already.

Sermon over..

Edit: grammar.


9000! I think we will be over 10k by monday
I am going to market green condoms,with rocket to the moon on the side
We're back in Business!
About to cross upwards on the gdax one hour chart. If it makes it across we should be in good shape tonight. 
Up 16% for the month, I’ll take it.
Lost/missed out on 2500 because I didn't Hudl, don't make the same mistake I made, trying to time the market is for suckers
Hello, can you see this post please respond.
Keep positive folks, the outlook is still Bullish.  Don't let some people make you think negative, I have already seen a few concern trolls appearing today. 
Anyone else painting their dick green in celebration, or is that just me?
I think bitcoin are having a hard time to break the wall of 10 k but we are very positive that it can before the end of the month we already observe how fast it can get up for an hour only.Let's wait
I love it...woke up to a chart screaming big jump at 810am .....got back from the bathroom to find I took the smaller dump.....Who the heck is selling now ????? 
Volumes are falling back down. Probably means we are going to have some ‘fake’ bull-runs in this bear market. Buy the dip. 
It feels like there's some market manipulation currently at play; weather the storm guys, HODL strong :D
Alts are rising in relation to BTC. That's usually a good sign... Breakout soon...
ITS OVER 9000!!
The Bulls just needed a rest, they are full of energy now!  
When moon?
I'm never going to get a Lambo like this. Someone kick the thing already. 
Good morning New York, any New Yorkers here?
Is anyone here a master with the pine editor on tradingview.com? I would like to have the McAfee-Dick-Line as an indicator in my chart. 

I believe it should be possible, but not sure how...
it bounced off from approx 8600 3 times now. good sign

This time it's different!
FOMO!!!
Sha sha shook out those weak hands 
Just went out of 9141 resistance, next test is 9287\-9407.
So are we back to the positive posts and fun stuff or do I need to wait a little longer so people can go back to fomo?

**Come On Bulls.**

**We have had an excellent few weeks, let us keep going.**
Mt Gox shadow again
Get ready for lift-off!
At least gdax is keeping Americans from trading while mt gox dumps 16,000 coins. That should help the market. Brian (BCash Asshole) Armstrong earned his namesake today. Why they use that exchange is beyond us. 
Good morning Europe. 

Time to fomo in...
Its absolutely market manipulation.  Go to CoinMarketCap and nearly every other crypto in the top 100 is up, including bcash, but bitcoin is down.  This is why the SEC won't approve a bitcoin etf, and shouldn't;  even with all this liquidity there are too many big players capable of swinging the price dramatically at whim.  So what is it today?  A whale selling another 50 million.  Hedge fund guys selling bitcoin to drop the price before the expiration of their futures contracts.  Chinese miners and Ver dumping bitcoin when its down to pump up the  bcash price before it forks, which, by the way, is not going to air-drop any free coins like bitcoin forks did.
Can I smoke a lambo?
Loving the volume on localbitcoins recently Xd
so we were trying to test 10k and back to the same level before the test and you call bear -5555-

A few longs closed, shorts keep dropping though.
Anybody use Robinhood for crypto? I happen to be in CA and got on the waitlist a long time ago and the whole no fee thing is great. 
I use other sites for all charting, analysis etc. and only use robinhood to actually execute trades.
I do have a question though - whenever I do market buys it buys it $15-20 over the current price (I'm only buying 0.5 btc) and market sells are $15-20 under the current price. You can also do limit buy/sells and in the screen it lets you know what current market price is, which is always $15-20 over/under the actual market price given by robinhood in the main screen.
If the current price is $8845 and I put in an order to buy when it is less than $8850 it won't execute until the price is actually like $8835, at which time it executes at $8850.

Is Robinhood's "no fee" thing a scam and this is their way of getting fees? Or is there some reason I haven't thought about?
What was the hike on April 12th. I keep looking back at the almost instantaneous jump from 6,800 - 7,700.
Chart experts, what y'all forcasting?

Buy: 8.2k
Sell: 10k --> Mun
Sweet pump!
So $12k next and then we do the same thing there I suppose. 
It’s over 9000!  Again....
Damn BTC!!! Back at it again with the 9k!
Why does it fluctuate around 9k so much 
Time to strap-on and see where it takes us.

Someone start the vegetta pump again
Good morning. 
Annoying, have to fight through 9.5k again -.-

🐮bullish
It's low volume but I would rather have low volume and the price staying the same or going up than high volume and the price going down. 
Breakout soon...
Here we go!
melt down yesterdey from 9.7 to 8.6 but broke the 2nd line of resistance out of 3 in just a day, looking good.  I think we'll retest 9.2sh again.  I think those fomos from yesterday saw the weakening bear of yesterdays at 8.6 and enters the market again.  
**Pullback Over? Bitcoin Retakes $9K, Eyes Further Gains**

https://www.coindesk.com/pullback-over-bitcoin-retakes-9k-eyes-further-gains/

Having recovered from a five-day low hit yesterday, bitcoin (BTC) has potential for a move higher towards major resistance at $9,880, the technical charts indicate.

The cryptocurrency moved back above $9,000 in the Asian hours after the pullback from the recent high of $9,767 ran out of steam around the ascending (bullish) 4-hour 50-candle moving average (MA).

As of writing, BTC is trading at $9,251 on Bitfinex, representing marginal losses over the previous day's close (as per UTC) of $9,270.

A bearish follow-through to Wednesday's bearish outside-day reversal would have been bad news for the bulls, but BTC instead appreciated by 4.5 percent on Thursday, keeping them in the game. Had BTC closed yesterday below $8,765 (Wednesday's low), the bears would have had the upper hand for the short-term.

View
**The pullback seems to have ended at $8,652, leaving bitcoin set to scale the resistance at $9,280 (double top neckline) and rise towards the 200-day MA located at $9,878.**

**Come On Bulls, keep fighting!**
Now pamp it!!!!!!! 
Let the rally begin...
Hmm... the fuck I sold at 9150 yesterday? :))
But still doesnt look like a healthy grow... probably gonna go down anyway at some point, maybe before 10k or after 10k.

Another bull run but nothing will slow it down this time, no erc20 bullshit or mt cocks dumping
Last time you'll see +9000, sell now.
We are heading back to 6700, same pattern.
Is it me or does this seem like such a wasted opportunity from the Bulls?

The door is open for going above $9k and they seem to be sitting on their arses doing sod all.
With so much negativity on the Reddit’s it makes me think where is the sudden massive volume coming from for these big pumps! There has to be a handfull of individuals controlling this market and making a fortune..
Well, that was fun while it lasted
Daily reminder that bitcoin is unregulated gambling.

Why don't we increase the block limit to decrease transaction fees?
So... moon or 10k never again?
Morning fellas, back with another live Bitcoin price analysis \+ perhaps some live trading if the opportunity presents itself. Open discussion for anyone interested!

Sorry if this is the wrong place to post but I have a technical question about bitcoin. Does anyone know whats the reasoning behind the design choice of having fees that aren't fixed price for transactions? From what I see by not keeping them fixed it creates the problem of potentially delaying a transaction forever and I can't really see any advantages. It drives miners to choose the transactions with higher fees which in turn creates a "unfair" system as transactions aren't ordered in creation time. What would be the disadvantages of having fixed fees and having the mempool "ordered" with miners processing transactions in order? Is giving users the choice of paying higher fees to get their transaction processed faster a good enough advantage over fixed fees with ordered transactions?

Edit: I speak about order a lot, but even if we don't order it, is fixing fees and making every transaction have the same chance to be processed a bad thing? Why do we want to give the miners the ability to choose which transactions to put on the block?
Here we go again. Greedy bastards will be sure to flub this too.
so the 16k btc moved to exchanges will be dumped....this damn goxx
The Asians just aren't in this game at all. I wonder why. They were the ones that used to drive this. The driving force now seems to have shifted to the US. 
Bitcon red bitcash green i own both. why is that?
Dumpeeet
its dropping down. Bitcoin have got no energy to the moon. 9205 atm, back to 8.9k, my predictions.
