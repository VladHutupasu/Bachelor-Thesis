Daily Discussion, March 01, 2018
I wake up. Bet whether I think Bitcoin went up or down. Am wrong 50% of the time. Than come here and see why I was right/wrong. It's pretty funny that it's my morning routine.
Who else here feels like BTC is just consolidating between high $9ks and low $11ks. I feel like ppl panic when BTC goes down 5-7% and then get way to excited like today when its at $10.9k and up 5%. Honestly I feel like we are just consolidating and until we either break low $9k or $12k we can't say we are in a bear or bull trend. Who else thinks that? :) 
why can't they pin more than two posts

I'm not gonna make it.. tell my wife that my wallet address is.. is.. \*dies\*
When the price went down to $9400 there was a fake guru who said the price would fall to $7000. He of course got it wrong. Price is up to $10600.  Is this a good time to get in the game or does anyone predict more falls?
I saw the post about dormant bitcoins about 3 years ago.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2twrs7/all_42400_dormant_bitcoin_addresses_with_a/?st=je7en0my&sh=12171213

According to your post, from 2013 to around 2015, there are 3,380,582.41 dormant bitcoins. How to know that? I'll be very thankful if you let me know where can I get the data.

I want to know from the past(about 2013 or more past) to nowdays, arrange from 1 years to 5 years or more, how many dormant bitcoins are there. Anybody knows?

definition of dormant is 'never withdrawal ever'
Real resistance will be at 11k; 10900 is a cute joke.

11k means very little in the big picture, hopefully we can zoom past it over the next few days/weeks.
Can BTC in february march? No, but in april may.
We need benevolent self destructing Quantum AI bots to break the exchange bots and set the price free again.
Holy shit volume is low.
What means low volume? Let's get this straight

**a)** Sleeping coins - lots of patient holders      
**b)** Loss of interest generally in Bitcoin        
**c)** People are uncertain and don't act

other opinions are welcome

Third push may decide the downtrend line resistance 
Broke 10 800!!! 
Resistance is futile.
Are we going back to 11k? Its been a cold winter here. Come on BTC, I need some heat.
Stay positive, BTC is at his early adoption, it will pass 11k anyway.Today, or later, it doesn't really matter.All is fine with what i'm seing.:)
11k!!! Yeeaaah!
11k yoooo!
Was checking a bit the web, newest articles i saw about BTC are neutral +, i invit you to check it to forge your own opinion. Enjoy ;o
Do you guys ever wonder why this sub is just full of price speculation while every other crypto sub has actual discussion on tech? Why is that?
Little BTC, make us proud in march.
Could be a breakout to the upside soon. Reason: Higher highs and higher lows. Classical technical mumbo jumbo speak.
Feel free to ask for some alcohol, food, women, what you need.Enjoy travel in train of happiness.Be aware that we can encounter some irregularities on the railway, then stay strong, just hold something to not fall.Be sure that we will arrive to destination, taking time it will need.
11.1k fomo will hit like a freight train. 
Ableleg you are a troll ðŸ˜‚
nub question: when all Bitcoins become scarce or a limited amount like people say?
I don't really care about the TA right now, IMO Bitcoin is extremely under valued at the moment.

* JP Morgan and BOA have both published that Cryptocurrencies are a "threat" to their business model
* Segwit adoption is growing by the day
* Lightning Network nodes on mainnet continue to grow
* The pull back that every analyst was calling for has happened (probably), 
* BTC is at 40% dominance for the first time in a while 

This thing is about to pop again
$11k will break within 4 hours. Then $12k broken by Saturday. Then 13k, then 14k then 500k. All by December 2020.
Classic Mortar and pestle forming on the hourly, stay tuned for more accurate graph predictions 
guys, stop regretting!
ladies and gentleman, prepare for moon!!!!
Boummmm ;o
nice try bitcoin

Wonderful..
Anyone else regretting not buying more at 10.2-10.3 yesterday? Had so many opportunities...
FUCKING HELL. IT BROKE 11K ON GDAX. Welp. Goodbye to my cock.
[removed]
10.8k is the new resistance and high.
Bitcoin at $13k by mid March.
is this discussion thread bullish or bearish now???!! I want to get on their good side so I don't get downvoted.

next push will show all the panic sellers that they made a huge mistake by selling al their coins. next time I think bitcoin will not crash as much as it did in January. Because the "noob" people will know bitcoin will always recover because they experienced it themself so they won't be fools again by selling their coins. HODL for the win!
The price broke through the downward trend that Bitcoin has been bouncing off every time. Uncharted territory now.
I was looking for this thread
Good morning Bitcoin, America and Kuala Lumpur!
Thanks all.
Am I safe having a Jaxx wallet both on my smartphone and home PC until I get a Trezor down the line? The Jaxx app on my phone has to go through 3 different passwords to send anything (unlocking phone, unlocking app and another password to send).

What can I do to improve safety?
need to find my space suit people!!!!!!
Today we are going to the moon! Tomorrow - beyond.
And remember: don't feed the redditor-for-1-day bitcoin-hater
People keep saying volume is low, is there any site that shows total Bitcoin volume per day? 
The "Oracle" contends that what makes sense in business also makes sense in stocks: An investor should ordinarily hold a small piece of an outstanding business with the same tenacity that an owner would exhibit if he owned all of that business.

Fight with profit taker and market mouvment , no body can tell you what is going to happen in the next hours
Ok let's be strong for the 11k now ;)
Stay strong above 11!! Dont ever look back! We are hitting 12k till sunday if we stay strong
They always end up selling lower and buying higher than what the chart says. Also, during either dips or rips most of the times the order doesn't get filled at the desired price and you have to try again, always losing money in the process. Use Limit orders on GDAX instead.
anybody hates sideways?

Is [Bitstamp](https://www.bitstamp.net/) down for everyone or just me?
I sold at 11,040 guessing this dip. But it was a baby dip :( 
But I'm ok with it. To the moon bitcoin hold 11 you strong sombitch
I have never seen volume this low for this long. All week we have had really low volume. Not a good sign. 
well back down the shit hole
ELI5 what is so good about decentralisation please. 
Hey Traders,
I found an interesting comparison between the Bitcoin and the stockmarkets. What do you think?

will it breach 11k?

ayyy 11k breached, now it's all gonna start caving down. 
Apparently the battle isn't over yet. I wouldn't worry too much if prices drop quite a lot, profit taking is to be expected.
Was listening to disco inferno when I logged in to check the price. Needless to say, it will be a new tradition for the good of mankind. 
GUYS. WHAT IF THE MOON IS MADE OUT OF LAMBOS.
shitcoin is looking decent today
Dump incoming
The triangles show a downward trend
Iâ€™m newer to crypto. I have been using Coinbase for about 3 weeks now. It took a little bit to get it set up and secure. I have a question for other Coinbase users. How easy/difficult is it to buy and sell these dips? It seems to me that most transactions take a few days at a minimum, so I have really just been sitting on my coins waiting for a big spike in price. 
This is even more exciting than when it hit 11K yesterday?   Anyways, I hope it hits that again.  I will unload and buy cheaper tomorrow morning.
what a sad game
Guess itâ€™s dump time. 
10.9 is resistance. 11k will not be breached today.
iuwehiwqr pqwejup qwj qej qej !
First of March and we just broke upper resistance. 


Moving above the trend-line once again.

Slow and Steady to the moon
