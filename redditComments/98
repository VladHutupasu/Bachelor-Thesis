Its official, I've broken even. After an investment around ¬£10,000 due to FOMO followed by an immediate  crash, I bought the dip. From this point on all increases in value means I'm in the green. Cheers you guys!
I've got to admit it... For a while it felt like everything was going to hell. Now the hype's back!
Where, oh where, are all the trash talkers and bad actors that hijacked this sub the last two weeks?  I want to know why we aren‚Äôt crashing to zero and clearly only those people have the answers!!!!


/s
Get ready for 11k guys!!!
I think we are officially out of the downward channel. $11k broken.
Bitcoin is KING - don't forget that.
Where do you guys believe will be the top this time?
Is it just me or are there far more major mentions of bitcoin in general media today than ever? (ie ellen)

Are the Banks all in after the dip and now telling all media to promote it?
all right, now that Chinese New Year has come and gone, we're going to see some excitement (I hope)!
people, we have a situation!!!! we have 11k according to my desktop widget.


Nothing more than our usual weekend dip folks, it was inevitable after that big run this past week. Sit tight, have faith and hodl! Even if it's late Monday/Tuesday before we set to work breaking that magic 11.5k resistance line.
I believe in BTC and I don't like the stress of worrying about price fluctuations and trying to time the market so I choose to just be a long term HODLer. I held through this last crash but have to admit I feel kinda stupid for not taking advantage and trying to increase my holdings. I don't want to commit any further cash to crypto (I'm happy with cash I've allocated thus far), so I feel I should've at least tried to trade with a portion of my BTC.

I have a busy full-time job so I can't spend time watching the markets/price. I'm thinking perhaps I should keep 5% or so on an exchange to play/trade with and the rest on my Trezor; curious as to other long term holders strategies here? Up until now I've just held & bought on dips.
Can we get to 11k today?!
11K is imminent. *crosses fingers* 
As i told you guys , prepare for 11.6k tomorow and 14 next week
drink lots of water before bed tonight so you can check prices in the middle of the night when you're forced to get up and use the bathroom

You can‚Äôt sell what you don‚Äôt have.
bots are on leave this time.... btc all the way to the moon
Price is recovering much faster then I expected. 
If we don't see a correction in the next few days then next stop will be 13K
How long til 12?!
A portfolio with no bitcoin is like a body with no soul.
$11k by tonight!
Good Morning China.
HAPPY NEW YEAR CHINA!
Oh my god hold on tight guys this is going faster
Typical Sunday üòÇ. I knew it was too good to be true.

Atleast volume is picking up!
Last time I looked it was down around 7k and I decided to just hodl and walk away. Strong hands done me good. 
It's dropping like a hot potato. Time to ready my fiat
Went from being 600 up to breaking even in less than 24hrs.  This is much more exciting than what I‚Äôm used to!
Thought we could all benefit from the Litany Against Fear:    
I must not fear.    
Fear is the mind-killer.    
Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.    
I will face my fear.   
I will permit it to pass over me and through me.    
And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.    
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only BTC will remain.    
lol @ people freaking out over this dip. When it first recovered to 9k. dipped to 7.8k, and proceed to climb way past that, that is the sign for the reversal. Just look at the previous bounces. The last move up before the big drop always struggles to go past the first wave of bounce. The cat is now alive and well folks, and it's calling the bulls to come home.
For those of you that get the joke and have been profiting from my market moves - I will be making my next BTC purchase in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.....
TO THE MOON!
Newb question.  I set in a buy order for when a certain coin fell to a certain price.  It went through.  I have another buy order for when it drops to another price.  I also have a sell order for when that coin reaches a certain price.  But for some reason, I can't set another sell order beyond it (I'm trying to layer my sells).  Is it . cause I don't have the coin in my account because I haven't bought it yet?  I'm using binance.  I know it sounds like a stupid question and it is, and I know the answer is something simple, but I can't for the life of me figure it out.  Say I put a buy order for 12 coins at .917.  It went through.  Now I have another buy order at .91 for 12 more.  It hasn't went through yet.  Not I have a sell order at .96 for 12 coins.  But now I can't place another sell order at .97 because it won't let me.  Is that because I don't have the coins in my possession.   Please, be gentle.
Value question:

Was reading about dotcom bubble and found that reach 6.7 trillions. 

According to internet a trillion is 1 followed by eighteen zeros, so if Bitcoin reach 1 trillion, what would be the value of a single Bitcoin?.
11k no stopping bitcoin now!
Dont stop!!! To the mooooon
nobody stops the kings rising
Wednesday, the Asian banks open back up from all the new year stuff. 12 and 13 then or before?
Damn it Nancy.
Correct me if I'm wrong but this latest rally seems to be China, Tokyo and Seoul waking up to their morning trades. 
11k again....its smells like...victory!!
I don't own any bitcoin directly because frankly I don't trust myself to not fuck it up somehow. I do own GBTC though. Bought it at $400, and sold it at $3500. Just bought a ton at $12, and it if goes up to 3500 again I'm going to retire.
I bought my last dollars at 10.800:) i hope its the last time seeing it under 11k!
Sunday üëªüëªüëªüëª
I've been waiting for this for too long, now is my chance... get ready... BEAR TRAP!
Buyback point ?
This recovery is early and fast. If this is truly the yearly recovery that we've seen on the past, it can continue rising through to December, and the price it could reach by then may easily prove those prophecies of 100k+ right. With the momentum of new investors and the promise of the future of store of value gold 2.0, nobody knows just how crazy high this can go. 
WTF happened to that sell wall at 11k? It crumbled!!
GO UP MORE üôè
Hulk-smash million dollar sell walls!
bcash pumpers desperate to peg it at at least .1 BTC; that's a psychological barrier that if broken could cause the price to nosedive
Alright Bitcoin chill, let's pace ourselves here. 
We‚Äôre back baby!
what's everyone's opinion regarding greenaddress wallet? Is it secure? Any hacks? 

I know everyone will say buy trezor etc hardware key, but....i'd rather not lose it if you know what i mean. 

So Greenaddress wallet?
still in time to buy ? was watching the 6k drop and now im kinda desapointed with myself 
Heard this song on sirius xm this morning during the whoolywood shuffle. Thought you guys would appreciate it. To the moon!

The amount of triangles in btc price movements is TOO DAMN HIGH!!!!
This is about the time we should start hearing from the four horsemen of the apocalypse.  The world is ending.  Ready your souls.  But where or where are there posts!?
If this past month hasn‚Äôt taught you to HODL, nothing will. TO THE MOON
To the moon!
Let‚Äôs not forget this exact pattern happened when we hit 10k. I pretty much expect it at every 1k increment. Well go past it, and a certain percentage of people who bought on the way down to 6k, managed to hold but don‚Äôt want to play anymore are going to sell and push it under. But it‚Äôll push back past once enough people either break even or take their gains at every grand. That‚Äôs my thought anyway. 
Stop panicking folks, we have been going up nicely since we were at $6K.  Try to keep things in perspective, Bitcoin goes up and down and lets just see what happens in the next few weeks.
I really hope all you guys are sarcastic, it‚Äôs been doing this over and over again. Literally. This is like the fifth time. The only thing that could fuck you all over would be yourselves. So please. Chill.
What's the general consensus.  Will there be a dip later this evening?
And beyond! ^^
To the Uranus
Bitcoin Will reach $11k and more, don‚Äôt hate.

Tears of blood they shall cry my lord.
Where could I buy Art with bitcoins ? I'm new on reddit and I have difficult to create a topic on that could someone help me?
I got off the pot just in time to cancel my buy order... Whew.  Bots almost got me.  I'm long term bullish on BTC, but I think it is due for a little step down.  (Sort of a 2-3 steps forward, 1-2 steps back).  This has been feeling like 5 steps forward, 1 step back.

God... I have to stop looking at Delta in the middle of the night.. saw 11300.. got a dopamine high, couldnt fall asleep for three hours... and when I finally do I wake up to 10600. 
I exited at 11.2.  Wrote off my loss.  This is appearing to be too orchestrated for my taste.
PANIC SELL!!!!!!!!!!!!
Best place to buy btc without ID verification? 
I think it's going to go much higher this time before any major correction because I don't think we will have an event where millions of people suddenly heard about this and are all buying in a short time frame. There will be sudden price fluctuation but nothing like the 400 bln market cap swing in 2 weeks that we saw.

Bit coin but sell or hodl on CNBC  (a little old but the using the hodl term like it‚Äôs a word on national tv ? ... interesting top tip at the end also )

I just bought in on coinbase per GDAX price was 11,120 coin issued a 11,175 per the index price has not even reach that.  WTF.
People predicting 20k and 100k. It just went up by 1 or 2k.. Too soon to predict 
11300!!!

the fomo is strong, what about the volume??
Can anyone recommend me a good, free wallet?
In how many hours will the Sunday sell off start?
Question about buying back in.  So I have long since learned to tier my buys and sells (to balance out my inability to time the swings).  But one thing I am working out is how far apart to gauge buys.

E.g. 10% of available $$ at $100 increments (the increment being the price drop)?  15% of available reserves invested in $300 increments?

I am probably much more conservative on buys than sells - I might buy back in with 8-10 steps... but sell out in 2-3 steps.

Opinions?  Thoughts?  Given the current dip?

Oh, and when Moon?
It is a minior correction. No worry.
So how low does it go? Help me to not panic.
Time for shorting, everythig is red.
The bots make money, dont forget about that
Kinda confusing situation
Oh boy it feels good to see people start panic selling again. Im waiting on the sideline. :)
Okay. Think Im going out for awhile.
Any reason why BTC is dropping now?  It was over 11K just a few hours ago and now it's dropping to 10K.  Any news out that is causing this?
10k-10,2k is solid resistance. Also on the verge of a TD 9 buy on hourly. Set stop loss just below 10k and go long here.
I'm not a financial advisor (:
I love weak hands . I buy as they drive it down panicking. And I get free coins 
Sweet! Slept through the ultra low point of 10.2k and woke up to seeing my coin $50 up! 
My experience trading (buy or sell) bitcoins at furcoins.com is awesome because no sign up, no fees and they guarantee prompt service delivery.

I find it amusing how the ad on this page is for an alternative investment to bitcoin because the price is going down. That campaign clearly outlived its relevance.
guys i had a nice run from $400 up to $19k back to $7.5 shit myself and got out. hodl for three years but moment of weakness and messed up shit with work and wife and i lost my nerve. was $500k down to $200k. just got back in with 10 BTC. what a fuck up!  can i trade my way back to original balances?!? going to be tough.

Hey all just wanted to post a thank-you for helping to make the crypto whale tracking app so popular since I released the new version last week. Really appreciate your support in all ways, and here's to a great night of trading--hope my app can help in some way :)

[whats the opposite of a green dildo?](https://giphy.com/gifs/joker-batman-heath-ledger-YPIrsRqqO7oB2) 
Tethering up for a bit now, I think.
Good thing i took profits @11.1k
And like a Yo-Yo we go up again. Back to 11k
Anybody remember my previous day prediction about big bear game lol
That dude who bought 400 mil dumping or somthing lol?
Haven't seen this sell volume since the last massive drop
does anyone have the link to the picture of the stages of a bubble. I keep finding some through google searches...but the one I am looking for is more detailed.
Bottom line, please;  which is the best exchange to buy Bitcoin? Reviews are all over the map for Coinbase and Robinhood and some others,  which one will be the best for a new Bitcoin buyer?   Thank  you

In for another dip to $7-8K?
It's all over man, it's all over!!
What the green dilio?üò®
I wonder what‚Äôs the new support level for the next dip?

Gotta hoard more!
Hi reddit. 

I‚Äôm looking to invest some serious money into bitcoin. I‚Äôve done a bit of research and I believe my best course of action is to hire an advisor, who can take a % cut of my earnings for giving me their advice. 

What would you guys do with this money?, would you stick it all in at once?, do multiple at a time. Let me know.

Thank you in advance.


BIP176.. we need to do something here, asap. If everyone don't like bips, then give them other options.., or directly choose satoshi.

Where we can get Bitcoin Private,for 1 Bitcoin is 1 Btc private,am I right?
Is Bitcoin A Good Investment At This Time?
I would love to sell, but, I‚Äôm locked in at 10,777 until my bank clears with coinbase. Things were looking great this afternoon, but, now, I‚Äôm pretty much on a forced hodl
I bought at 10950$ and it went downhill
this bull shit coin is a disaster... today u r rich but tomorrow u r broke.
Tether pump
Price is going up , last chance to buy
dip guys, please dont buy.
The weekend bear trap is especially ridiculous when it is 1000 to 2000 +than the normal weekday market trading range.
Not to spread FUD but uh... I think this drop might be going under 10k again.
