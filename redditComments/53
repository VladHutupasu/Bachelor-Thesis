Parents! Give your kids their easter money! They are our only hope!!!!
Im fucking drubnk what happend
I don't even like lambos.
No 1!  Happy Easter.
Well I've officially scraped the idea of getting a lambo...
You’re right. Failed I have, into exile I must go 
ramen diet lives on
BTC has strong support at 200$
This is by far the funniest forum. I own mainly alts, but I am not blind to the importance of BTC. People are way too serious sometimes in other Reddit forums. 
Everyday I look at charts and say: 
“Has Anyone Really Been Far Even as Decided to Use Even Go Want to do Look More Like?”
People are selling like crazy on binance.  Hopefully the other main exchanges are opposite.  
bought at 6700... can't help it...
Last time bitcoin was around this value there was pump and dumps every couple of hours for 400-500$ now biggest oscillations are 100$. 

Seems like bots given up on artificially pumping up price to dump it?
I don't want to see BTC fall, but as long as BCash falls further (and it is doing so relentlessly) it gives me some satisfaction.

Once we are rid of this nasty stain upon the crypto-space, the market will recover.
there's probably a huge buy wall at 6k
wtf.
Its like a hunted animal it has been shot and now its slowly bleeding...
How low can you go
Goodnight, my sweet prince: And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
i can see 10 minutes in the future and i see a Margin call cascade to 3k
Wow did I go long at the wrong time 😅
It's like the market is on Valium now, where as late last year it was on super strength Amphetamines.
if the fud narrative that big money is shorting bitcoin to death is true, then i dont know why people think there is support at any level above about $1000-$2000 per coin.  if its that type of big money performing calculated dumps, the actual market to prop up the price at any given level is nonexistent.  whales are whales from 2013, they are not going to hope to add to that stack propping up the price at $4000 per coin and regardless of if they did, their fiat input would not offset calculated dumps such as the ones being suggested. if the narrative is true the dumps would increase to absorb these inputs.
If Bitcoin really does moon today, think of all the Jesus related memes going down in the history books.
Bitcoin is very easy to handle for big whales because there is no regulation. So they sell high, then buy low but ... we did not know how low is low for them. For one thing, they will buy back and the price will go up again because it's human nature to try to make easy money. My only 2 cents.
I wanna witness something special today lads
It's 6am in Tokyo now. What will Japan do, when it wakes up?
That green dildo is HUGE!
for any mf doom fans, new czarface album has a bitcoin shout-out on phantoms

"I fought a ghost in my apartment, he had too many hitpoints
He bested me and told me I should've invested in Bitcoin"

[Spotify link](https://open.spotify.com/track/7MI23VU7ULV1PaGZoHtiHn?si=sVv6ZCAXTmiysk_2J5WwVQ)

My dog is telling me 7.6k today
Perhaps this dip is just a bad april joke and btc is actually way higher? 
Where are those bitcoin memes?
There's no way it holds 6.5k tbh
the lower the market cap the more shitty altcoins die at least
wow bitcoin broke out of the bear flag faster than I expected tbh
I never thought 6500 would be a comforting price.  I make funny faces when its 6499 and at 6500 I'm able to breathe again.  
it will crash back be careful bears trap
Lol, nice touch with the „North Corea” flag in the logo :D
Just when you think she's gonna hit 6k,you go have a shower and the April fools candle slaps you in the mouth. 
Japaneses are bearish these days, they would love it when they would get up in couple of hours, USA bought it and they will sell it in profits 
Almost midnight on the east coast and  it's floating just under $7000 woot
My employer has offered to pay me in bitcoin.  I'm scared.
Hi, it's not a very happy Easter for Bitcoin! :( 
[deleted]
I just want to wake up to 8k. That’s all 
just in case anyone is wondering whats happening.
the current price is almost 95% correlated with the amount of BTC shorted on bitfinex. you can check for yourself - anytime somebody shorts, the price goes down and if some whale closes his position we see those huge spikes. check the charts for yourself. and by the way - today we've reached the highest amount of BTC shorted since over half a year. If all those were to close their positions we would probably rally to over 10k again very easy. 
https://imgur.com/9TntVnS
There's two possibilities here imo: people buy back in and liquidate the shorters REALLY bad (as happening in september last year when we bounced from 3k -> the following 5k-7k movements were almost all shorts who bought back in at a loss - check the charts) or the shorters manage to scare more people into selling into their shorts so they can buy back at a profit and then rebuy for good. yet the low volume selling indicates there are simply not enough people to panic sell anymore which may catch the bears off guard.

https://imgur.com/9TntVnS

thats just what im seeing tho. im super interested in how this turns out - the amount of short positions open we are seeing now is very new land and exciting to watch
The one hour chart looks nice right now. This is not a bear flag anymore. :-)

But it would be more clear if it breaks 7200...
I’m somewhat new to crypto currencies.  I have a question about bitcoin.  Won’t bitcoin have to stabilize HEAVILY in order for it to be accepted as a supported currency?  If it fluctuates between $20,000 and $6,000 won’t that make it nearly impossible to use it as a form of payment?
They see me HODLin'

They hatin'

FUDyin' and tryin' to catch me sellin' lowly

Tryin' to catch me sellin' lowly ♪
Such an awesome price right now
Pump and dumps have killed the crypto space these last 3 to 4 months
We re seeing an average drop of $1k per week now. I’m a long time hodler but I can’t do it anymore.
Totally organic jump nothing to see here
On a historical-religious-economic note, on this Easter Sunday:

Judas only accepted 30 pieces of silver to give the whereabouts of Jesus to the temple authorities and their Roman guards.  That's probably 30 silver coins.

That's not worth a *huge* amount today, and probably worth even less then when precious metals were a common currency and the initial supply was large.

So it was probably the equivalent of - guestimate - 150-200 Dollars - enough to buy some clothes.

I wonder what shitcoin Judas would accept today?

(See what I did there - brought it back to topical)

Suggestions below:
Time to test our mighty wall at 6500, this is it cross your fingers.
margincalls

At this rate Feb 6th lows will be under threat on Monday (hope not)
I was going to open a long position at 6.5k but you guys gave me cold feet.

Was that the right or wrong thing to do?
I just got the message that I've been banned from /r/bitcoin. 

This might be my last comment here.

It was an honor. And HODL strong.
Does it not get to a point where the Bulls say, 'F**k this' and start charging!? 
What happened?

To the moon!

I love Lambos!

Ok, things have settled down, but that was fun.  Lets take a minute 5 break and let my blood pressure equalize and lets do it again.
If you had enough money to significantly move BTC prices on one exchange, could you make money by triggering a large price move somewhere (with lower volume) then instantly arbitraging on other exchanges? Does this type of manipulation explain most BTC price moves?
I think its too late for some people to buy back in at the price they wanted. 
[deleted]
Just listened to Tales from the Crypt podcast with O’Beirne brothers.. good stuff
Anybody that still wants to short here will help bring us to 7k on the squeeze.
shower thought: Are these automated whale bots programmed by millionaires (which assumes millionaires know how to code) or do millionaires hire programmers to program these bots for them?
As Bitcoinist reported today, Bitcoin has in fact ‘died’ in the press 273 times since its creation. Those deaths do not include the annual deluge of fake funerals, which have become a classic hallmark of April Fool’s Day in the cryptocurrency sphere.
New to bitcoin here. Planning to invest, as so many ppl claiming this a bottom. Not sure how can I get the coin. Any idea of trustworthy exchange that supports fiat? I had some experience in trading stocks before. 
**Come on Bitcoin lovers, this is when Bitcoin needs your support!**
I don’t even know anymore, just fuck
I don’t know why but the term whale is the dumbest shit in the history of investing 
Come on. At least give us a nice 8.5k!!!
Bull flag boiszz
I am loosing my shirt, 20k down in 1 week help me !!!
Gonna get downvoted for this, but I'm calling $6,000 by the end of the day.
byebye life savings
if its not shooting up tommorow i will fuck the easter bunny
it will go up from here they said
thats maximum downfall, can't break this resistance level, now time to go up
Are we finally in the clear? 
Yawn.  pump it over 8k and I’ll pay attention 
This is most likely not the bottom, in fact I think we will see $3k-$4k BTC prices first and hover around there for several months before we recover.

You dumbass mods still haven't banned me yet, good try.
Bitcoin sure likes the number of the beast 
I have my last stack of fiat which i have set aside to buy during dips. Are we going lower than 6k?
Hello Bid@6700 again.. It's felt like the hundredth time you've hit this price!
Quilt sales are normally so good on Sundays.

He has Risen. 
for those of you playing the swings, don't just jump in on shorts as you wake up to fallen prices. there could be a small rally to test the broken support level. It could also reverse here as well, but most likely not due to market sentiment currently.
The FUD is extremely confusing on April Fool's Day.  :)

More confusing than normal.
[deleted]
don't you guys think it is manipulation ????
Presently mainly a poker game between whales of different strokes, probably some hidden cards at both sides as well. Pretty entertaining though.
Hold the line!!!!!
SPARTAN
I have to cook the meat today with this shit going on! Set it and forget it baby. The Ronco will save the day...and a laptop. 
wow. Vicious
talk about weak bounces
On this most holy day, always look on the bright side:

Anyone else get b& today? /S
If Bitcoin breaks february's low I would be scared but I highly doubt it. Waiting for reversal rally.
Tom Petty and John Mayer would approve of this trend 
[deleted]
So these whales.... How exactly are they doing it? How do they get every single exchange to pump and dump all at the same time? That's really organized.

🤔
The buy volume and general purchase power has increased amazingly in short time.

Still not sure if this is a trap or just a positive upwards trend.
Look at them big green boyos
It was just April fools by the whales?
I guess these are the sort of days that a lot of day traders get hammered. 
Thanks Jesus 
Good night guys, been a long day for me.  

I did my little part to help push the price up :)
Eight failed attempts It create chances of further new low

i would very much like to see some shorts squeezed

Did anybody else notice the Lambo on coin market cap page?

Alright.  Everyone who was waiting for 6500 to buy, take your foot out of your mouth ...
NO PLS GOD NO
I sold at 7000 so this is a very exciting time for me as my potential bitcoin pile increases
that was undoubtedly the greatest squeeze i've been part of. I had a long going too and I bit on the fakeout and had to close my long only to open up a short....i got completely wrecked my god. lost everything there even after giving myself some room on my liquidation price. just wow.
**Come on Bitcoin lovers, this is when Bitcoin needs your support!**
Prepare for 7k, here we gooo!

[EDIT] Will be interesting to see if this is a drop or a bear trap.

There are so many surprises today it's hard to know at the moment. :)
Anybody else scared to buy right now?
Is this Asia or whales?
He has risen?
7k!!!! 15k tonight
Got flamed for calling 6,5k when ppl claimed 8,1k was the bottom and here we r today.

5,9k will be tested within the next week guaranteed, ill poke u responders then 😎

Rags to riches to homeless 
For those who rate fib retracements, 5500 to 6000 is 78.6% retracement and very possible here. 

Anything below that will mean the next level which I don't want to mention because I know I will be shot for that. :)

It's Monday morning in Asia. Q1 fiscal year. It all changes this week. We've hit the bottom bois
Give it 3 years and the people who got in after November may have a hope at breaking even

we still have a bit down to go, we most likely gonna see low 5k
Wait a second....have my prayers been answered today?  LOL
Anyone else feel bad for John McAfee? I'm reading his bio and it said his "personal fortune had declined to $4 million from a peak of $100 million" because of "the effect of the global financial crisis and recession on his investments".
It sounds like he's one of those millionaires who got unlucky and lost everyone. Now he's into crypto and shrilling about various ICOs.

Hyperwave was broken... We are going to 4k... Sorry moon boys
Next stop 6K
Up! $7200 is the barrier we need to break to render some bearish TA useless...
If the trend lines i did when stoned are true, it’s green dildos from now. *say it with gravitas* 
I wonder how confident you hodlers will be when the price starts showing in the 4000s.
When BTC recovers it will bounce hard and FOMO will be real.
I think I’m going to finally sell. Below 7k was my bottom line. If it gets back to 7 I’m selling. If it hits 6 I’m out. I’ll buy more when it’s at 5. 
GUYS WTF. BUY BITCOINS NOW. SHIT. GO. 





I SAID GO. 

WHAT ARE U WAITING FOR????
Can't hold 6740, 6730....
Qu: What have Bitcoin, and the Lord Jesus who rose from the dead on Easter Sunday, got in common.

Ans: Fuck all. 
It's only a matter of time before Bitcoins hit the gutter. The graph says it all. 4 months and the price has slid down one dip after another, a clear indication that the price is only going to lower at this point. No person with the right mind would think that buying bitcoins after crashing down hard *even* at 67% below the ATH is a good idea. How long has it been since Bitcoins were around? Pretty much forever at this point. So why are people STILL losing hope in a system that many people *think*, will dominate the world? Please PLEASE tell me I'm not crazy for thinking this. 

I am going to pass on the opportunity to buy and will steer clear for the sake of common sense - which is unfortunately a dying trait nowadays. No amount of reasoning will lead me to the surge of upvotes in this circlejerk sub although I am confident that I will be ultimately be right about this which is why I am taking my sweet time before bed to post this message and be able to look back with pride when the time comes. 

If not, then sweet. I will relish the second chance to sell what's left of my bitcoin stash before I make the same mistake twice - yes you heard me, I am an official bitcoin owner who's NOT too optimistic about the future of bitcoin. I'll be happy to risk what's left of my portfolio and hope that I'm wrong over blindly believing that this predicament is going to change for the better. 
Bitcoin won’t rise back until it has atleast 50% of the market dominance. We are nearly there. 
My precious
Is there any lightweight Lightning Network client for mainnet? Temporarily I can't run a full node setup.
This is it will the massive 6.5k wall at kraken hold or was it all for show
There have been a lot of posts on taxes. Here's another article I hope helps. In my unprofessional opinion, it seems the best idea - as far as preparation goes - is to log every crypto transaction with as much detail as possible. If you do spreadsheets, this is probably the best option. But a simple notebook and pencil can't hurt either. 

https://www.coindesk.com/maddening-task-calculating-taxes-crypto/

I watch someone buy 1250 BTC yesterday which came in around $8.5m.

That’s insane. From a skeptics point of view I guess it could be some sort of manipulation? 

Or maybe more likely to be an exchange making some sort of move?

Interested to hear peoples opinion on that 
COME TOO ME!!!!!
6500 held this time, I have a feeling we will be attacked again! 
Finally reached my target point!!! I can relax now.

why so many people banned from: r / bitcoin today? Me with ...

Ok. Can we do this again, please?
Is their anyplace I can buy btc using money from PayPal 
America's most desirable places to live is accepting bitcoin (Bitcoin just hit an all-time high — here's how you buy and sell it) as payment, a growing trend in the real estate market.

http://www.pittsburghpablog.com/2018/03/can-real-estate-able-with-bitcoin-pay.html


The

Middletown

,

New Jersey

, house was nominally listed for $2.15 million) on Zillow in late January. The listing, however, stipulates that seller will accept bitcoin as payment based upon a "non-negotiable" sale price of $2.3 million.

Far from Silicon Valley and other tech hubs, the listing in Middletown, often ranked one of the best places (MONEY Magazine Names Middletown One of Best Places to Live in Northeast Region) to live in the US, shows just how far cryptocurrency and bitcoin have reached into the national conversation.

The listing is far from the only one in the

US

to accept bitcoin.

Over the last six months, an increasing number of real estate listings have begun accepting or requesting cryptocurrency for payment. There have even been some that only accept bitcoin as payment.

Bitcoin Real Estate, a website specializing in real estate listings that accept cryptocurrency, told Mercury News in late January that it has nearly 400 homes listed on its website.

Real estate website Trulia told Mashable last week that it had around 80 listings that mentioned cryptocurrency in some way, while Redfin said it had seen the number of listings accepting cryptocurrency rise from 75 in December to 134 in January.
Compare BTC to the Swiss Central Bank stock.....

They have had a very similar trajectory
I would be careful with selling at this point if the goal is to re-enter at a lower price. Sure, you might luck out, but you also might not. If you sell for profit and don't plan to buy in again then that would be a different matter.

The market is different at this point than when we had a continuous downtrend. There is much more confidence and buying pressure at this level. I wouldn't be surprised to see occasional sudden spikes, which have already happened a couple of times, even during the night when everyone thought the buying volumes were low.

While sudden drops could happen, they might also be cancelled out by quick bullruns, resulting in squeezing shorters and bears. A higher price altitude would be a safer terrain for those that plan on selling and re-entering at a lower price point. 

Just my humble opinion. Stay safe and avoid risky bets.
Bounced off 6650? And test 7k rinse repeat?
I'm just hoping to buy more if it goes significantly lower and eventually break even. Bitcoin has just become a huge stressor in my life that I do not need. 
Bitconnect is selling his 1 Billion Dollar worth of BTC who else could sell so much lol
Lower. :)
Happy April Fools Day, r/bitcoin. Maybe this dip is just a cruel joke
lol here we goo 
LOL: https://redd.it/7pldq5
So HONESTLY wondering, wtf is going on to BTC, are we pretty much going to decline to non-existence?
Asaaargh but I need it to dip so I can buy more lol. We have plenty of time for it to Moon! Our Lord and Prophet McAfee said 2021 will be the year of the Great MOON!!
It is april fool pump, those who bought from top will loose
There's a lot of false information from the cartel that's deterring old and new investors. That's why the price isn't rising.
Yawn, anyone else bored of this?
Seems all the movement today is coming from single large buys. Institutional money coming into the space now? Could April be hot month? I'm not saying anything just yet other than today is looking good. :)
I am not personal advisor, guys who will sell from here, I am sure they will thanks me later
I want the best for all of you.  But I can't see this going up anytime soon.

1.  Average millennial/tech person becomes aware of Bitcoin/Altcoins prior to Thanksgiving.  Big discussion and FOMO over Thanksgiving tables
2.  Come Christmas discussion continues and FOMO builds harder...many buy in above 14k.  They also invest in altcoins.
3.  Market drop...they get burned.  Most of that money that drove the rise is out and out for good.
4.  Those who invested in altcoins realize what a scam most of them are.
5.  What is the discussion today at Easter?  


Nevertheless.... first time I seen a green dildo grow in live time.... grew faster then me seeing a hot naked chick....
As far as Sun rises in Japan, Btc will see sunset of downfall

Idiots selling again. 

I can't wait to see the same people buying back at 20k. 
You'll get your bounce soon but then it's down to around 4000 after that so use the bounce to get out of long positions
There is nothing we can do against corporate elites with trillions of fake dollars to play with. They will just keep printing new money. They will do the same with this market as they did with gold and silver
What we guessing? Drop to 4k by next week?
I told you it will drop back same way, wait for 10 minutes you will see big red candle because trading volume is very low

Bitcoin will crash now even more due to the 128 tariffs China has recently rolled out. Stock markets will 👎

Give up, Jihan. You and your commie pals aren't getting bitcoin below 6500.
6500 ON BITFINEX!  YES!
Oh, YES! Come too me!
Bitcoin is going down, like poon tang
1500$ tommorow. Niceee
So, where you all at now that it's still going lower?
6450 got swallowed up but was able to push back a little in the process.  We need to keep above this mark currently 6468, not much room to work with.
**CHARGE!!!!!**
The problem with these pumps is that we get a lower low since more than a month. Counting from feb 6th. Everyone can see that its gonna drop to 6.5k again within a few hrs
Buy, buy ,buy 
The only way to buy at the bottom is not selling when you have them already

Hi to everyone, I just get up I wanna share with you guys a dream which I saw last night, what I see bitcoin dropping down from 6500 and and then suddenly someone pump it to 6900 and I get shocked how its possible in 1 minute, then sound came to my Ear don't worry its April fool pump, after few minutes I see that sudden pump on chart take the shape 'F' which means fool, then after few hours it crashes down badly then someone laugh's, I am feeling scared because what ever I see in my dream that always happen to me
