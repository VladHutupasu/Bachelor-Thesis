damn 10k is tough to reach. hope we have a good week with some good news
Tonight; 8PM EST
Overall a decent weekend! Pretty impressed staying above 9k even though i didnt do much trading. 
I'm ok with this, I get paid friday and was planning on buying $750 more so this allows me to buy cheaper btc. I dont want btc to rise too fast too soon, want to hold as much btc as possible before we head to the moon
Can someone help me with [this issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8f8bkz/comment/dy2meam?st=JGMKMQU9&sh=cf07690ahttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8f8bkz/comment/dy2meam?st=JGMKMQU9&sh=cf07690a)?
I bet there's a simple explaination to this.
HODL THE $9K!!

What are bitcoin fees like at the moment? I haven‚Äôt bought any coins in awhile. 
I don't know how to read tea leaves but is higher lows and lower highs indicating a breakout, one way or another?
Buying the dip lol
Bitcoin don't give AF.
Would like to gage the scene after these small dumpies:

Bullish = upvote
Bearish = downvote
This pattern we're busy doing is actually quite bullish. Boring, but bullish. I think we'll break out before mid week.

For God sake people this is the same shit that happened last week and it was even s bigger drop than this, we made it out fine. Pretty sure most of these panic posters are just trolls anyways but I just don't want others to panic because of these trolls. We are still hoovering around 9000, we'll be fine, just be like me and see it as a buying opportunity. I have invested over 25k in btc and still want to invest more before we go to the moon, so slow rise is what I'm hoping for anyways.
this sucks
**Bulls - Keep up the fight.**
It might go up. It might go down. And no, I'm not talking about the Bitcoin price. I'm talking about my weiner. 
10400 10 4 good buddy
Does anyone know what total volume traded is like these days?  As volume is low on GDAX but I'm wondering whether that just means less people are using GDAX and have moved to other exchanges. 
Go Bitcoin!

We need a higher high.
What will the month of May bring us? Curious to hear some legitimate predictions! 
Why did *fake satoshi* try to sign a key.. It would be better to say that I am satoshi but I lost the private keys...
He must have known he would get caught very fast..
Warm up Vegeta
Guna bounce from 9k to the moon
time to rebuild the portfolio ... the April movement gave us a glimpse of how things can stand, which currencies will have the potential for bolder growth. we will keep the balance, calm, we know that this market will grow a lot and that 2018 will still be very positive. do not make hasty decisions. stay calm and make good choices, keep your portfolio. we will still have many oscillations until September and then we will see rapid growth.
Here's my prediction for the month of May:

We are going to see institutional money come into the crypto space as well as millionaires. We can expect this around the 2nd-3rd week of May especially due to the consensus taking place in New York.

Little drop shook out some weak hands. Who sold like a dumby haha
it's crashing, it's crumbling and I'm prepared. Until the grid falls apart feeling fine.
This is a good time to buy.

I just did. 

There's a new, flatter and more sustainable uptrend forming. Which happens to be the McAfee Dickline.

The price might fall down to 8760 for a very short time, but I believe that it will bounce back over the dickline very quickly.
Nothing but better news all over this industry lately and tanks on a Monday again. Weak North American hands IMO and pretty soon Europe and Asia are going to tire of bailing those greedy North American bastards out

Why is there so many big sell orders popping up at 9299.00 üò° fkn weekday daily corporate pump and dumpers 
Guhhhh, under $9K again...
So pumped boys, after so much work I'm now only 0.2 BTC away from my goal! Still gonna take a ton of work, but it finally feels like it's actually possible!
My name is stokelycalm (spelled backwards). The stupid mods banned me. I‚Äôm here to say I‚Äôm the biggest shorter. To me nothing is a greater Hardon than watching HODLERS piss their pants and lose their money. We all know Bitcoin will revert to $20K+ but I‚Äôm a shorter who believes it will fall to $4k before it returns. I‚Äôm stokelycalm and I‚Äôm the biggest shorter. Please thumbs up my comment lol
Welp I‚Äôm selling this isn‚Äôt good #NoHodl

Holy shit though, I'm new to bitcoin but this must be the most boring thing I've ever laid my eyes upon.
It‚Äôs the whales driving down the prices .. the market was great all weekend with no whales about

Is anybody tracking that Mt Gox wallet? Large spikes in sell offs could indicate fear in the market
Im afraid its going down.  Cant break the resistance and a whale doesnt want to fill anymore.  Anyway its the whale who created these huge spikes at random 5min chatrs that creates the momentum. 
Ohhh these Satoshis bout to get it. Imma buy the hell outta yall. Keep going down and see what happens. 
I made $$$ + more bitcoin
A lot of trapped shorts from the 25th of April dump.  I‚Äôm expecting a lot of buying interest at 8800.

This drop is a very bad sign. Do not buy. It will go much lower. 
Breakout very soon. I hope it will go up, but I‚Äòm afraid it will go down.

1-2 hours max.
BTC today.
