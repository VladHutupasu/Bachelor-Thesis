**GoTenna Launches a Bitcoin Wallet That Works Without the Internet**

https://www.coindesk.com/gotenna-bitcoin-wallet-mesh-network/

If James Bond needed to use bitcoin on a secret mission in the jungle, he probably couldn't drop by a Starbucks to use the wifi.

Since internet connections aren't always available, reliable or private, cryptocurrency users need alternative ways to connect to the network. So the New York-based startup goTenna, founded in 2012 by Brazilian siblings Daniela and Jorge Perdomo, is partnering with Samourai Wallet to launch an Android app this summer that allows users to send bitcoin payments without an internet connection.

Announced Monday, the txTenna app will enable users to sync up their mobile with a goTenna device, which costs $179 per pair, then toggle the wallet app's settings to transact offline and send the bitcoin.

"You need to be able to spend your bitcoin even in disaster areas," goTenna engineer Richard Meyers told CoinDesk, citing the Perdomo siblings' recent work in Puerto Rico, where goTenna devices helped people reconnect after Hurricane Maria. "As long as you have a way to charge your phone, you can be up and meshed and communicating."

The signal needs to be within roughly a mile of another goTenna device to relay the message across the mesh network, a decades-old system for using the internet without wifi or a landline. So far, goTenna has sold more than 100,000 devices that let users tap into the mesh network.

If the offline bitcoin user is within a mile of another active device, the transaction could bounce across the mesh until it reaches a user with an internet connection.

"It offers an alternative that is more censorship-resistant," Meyers said, adding:

"It's going to obscure who you are and where you're at when making these transactions. So that's a big privacy advantage there."

This system uses a free, unlicensed radio frequency, and it isn't the first partnership to explore such potential for cryptocurrency networks.

It takes a village
Stepping back, a variety of projects since the Cold War have used relatively cheap and mobile radio setups to broadcast across firewalls and oceans.

Last year, renowned cryptographer Nick Szabo and blockchain engineer Elaine Ou published a proposal detailing how weak-signal radio transmissions could help boost security and the diversity of connections across the bitcoin network.

Then, in December, after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission repealed "net neutrality," fans of ethereum, the world's second most popular blockchain network, started flocking to mesh network technology meetups.

When net neutrality rules expire next month, internet service providers will no longer be barred from favoring or blocking specific websites and communities. It's an opportune moment for censorship-resistant tools for bitcoin transactions.

Perhaps the most important aspect of txTenna is that the cryptocurrency wallet will be an open source project.

Indeed, it was Samourai Wallet's open source communication tools on Github that first inspired goTenna's team to reach out to the bitcoin startup. The same txTenna code could theoretically be applied to iOS wallet applications as well.

As Meyers explained:

"It absolutely could work with any software wallet and they [Samourai Wallet developers] are not writing it specifically for the Samourai wallet anyway. It will be something any wallet provider could send transactions through."
Although not surprised by dips at this point... I’m a little taken aback by it. The timing is odd. I’ve literally read no valid reasons for drops of the 500 in a day nature 
Good morning all.
The last two days I called for an end to sub 9k Bitcoin, I was wrong, what I have actually been meaning to say is that I'll just shut up now. It'll be there soon
Legitimately afraid to go to sleep for fear of what I’ll see when I awake.

I thought Consensus 2018 was supposed to boost the price of BTC. So, why is it faaallllling!!??! Thoughts?
This Consensus hype is boring
Will this be a good week for BTC and overcome the resistance it has in the 9k?
Reminder: Bitcoin has been worth at least $2,000 for about a year. 
We're about 2 months shy of it being worth at least $3,000 for a year. 
The all time low for 2018 was more than 3 months ago. 
If $5,800-$6,000 continues to be the low for 2018... that's a really solid win in my book. 

btc wants to breakout but theres so much resistance. insane. 
My magic 8 ball says we will go above $9k today.
I want to help my uncle be able to set his brick and mortar store front up to accept bitcoin, how do I do it ? 
(Hypothetical) can anyone point me in the right direction for set ups, videos, where to purchase little scanner pos bois, anything related, YouTube videos, anything. I want to learn how people do it cuz if crypto booms this summer I want to start a business called lucky lemons where it’ll be like a Chick-fil-A except it’s just the lemonade and possibly toasted meat and cheese sandwiches.

My other uncle (reality) is running a “factoring receivables” business working with small businesses to pay them money owed to them in xx days - right now, around 95% of it,  (so they can use it to grow now and make more), in exchange for their receivable, 100% of  it.  I can’t think of a way to work crypto into this especially since smart contracts aren’t prevalent at all yet. But I know Reddit is a host to very smart folks.

Thank you to any who reply.
Hey guys, is there any way to establish a connection between a node's ip adress and a btc adress?

With LN still in beta, is it possible we will see a more comprehensible display of our balance in our wallets that are open on the LN? 

For instance, showing that we have .001 BTC, which is ~$8.55 at the time of this writing, could be hard for someone to comprehend. dealing with small numbers like this is outside the norm for most people who deal in fiat. Granted the franctions of say, $1 USD is easy to comprehend for most. We learn about change transaction (quarters, nickels, etc) in grade school. 

Would it be easier for people to read bitcoin balances on the LN in whole numbers? for instance, the above example would translate into 100,000 satoshi's. Correct? Please forgive me if I'm wrong in this. 
Cowabunga! 
Korea should be waking up soon.  Will they buy more now that the upbit FUD has been dispelled?
good luck guys, I'm going to watch the movie "the matrix", just to rest .....
**Bitcoin Price Eyes Breakout As Trading Range Tightens**

https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-eyes-breakout-as-trading-range-tightens/

Bitcoin (BTC) is stuck in a narrow $550 range between the key long-term moving averages today, but may be prepping for a breakout, the technical charts suggest.

With the bull/bear bias now unclear, the big problem now is trying to work out in which direction the price will go.

As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,760 on Bitfinex, and is trading between the 50-day moving average (MA) at $8,287 and the 100-day moving average at $8,837.

The sell-off from the May 5 high of $9,990 came to halt around the 50-day MA on Saturday. Further, the 50-day MA also acted as strong support on Monday. Meanwhile, on both occasions, the rebound from the 50-day MA ran out of steam around the 100-day MA hurdle.

The rangebound action seen in the last three days has established the 50-day MA as a major support and the 100-day MA as a formidable resistance and the breakout of this zone will likely set the tone for the next big move in BTC.

View

Another rejection at the descending trendline seen in the 4-hour chart will likely yield a drop to 50-day MA located at $8,287.

That said, only a daily close (as per UTC) below the 50-day MA would signal a revival of the sell-off from the recent high of $9,990 and would allow a deeper drop to $7,787 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the April 1 low to the May 5 high) or even as low as $7,698 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the July 2015 low to the December 2017 high).

On the other hand, a convincing move above $8,910 (expanding channel hurdle) would expose resistance lined up at $9,390.
So much for the Consensus Meeting!  :(
I hope the price drop will result in GPU prices going down...they're still 25-50% over MSRP for last year's tech and I need one for normal use. 
Dumpity dump :D 

WE WANT A PUMP NOW!
Bart head almost complete.  Ready for a jump to 8700 within the next 30 minutes.
I love the stability.  Very attractive to large investers easy to produce the jump in the morning. 
Bcash shitfork is imminent - slow market may be due to people seeing what will happen to our lying brethren's coin at that point.

Roger's chinese government coin is confusing the entire cryptomarket imo.

edit: as of now: shitfork in about 1 hour.
No value here, Lots of idiots with stupid questions and statements.
8500 being tested hard the last hour or so

No one knows where btc is going to go but with all the value and infrastructure being poured into the cryptocurrency space UP in the long term seems like a good bet in my book. 
Told you guys. As sure as the sun will rise we will see 7.8k. 
Can someone help me understand what an ideal bitcoin/crypto world would look like? Do people want it to completely replace dollars? If people are trading dollars for bitcoin then someone will always have dollars so how does crypto spread to mass adoption?

Also, isn’t it true that you can have mass adoption without an increase in price? Like if all the whales sold off as adoption increased then supply might equal demand? Thank you for enlightening me!
Closing in on the downtrend line. Now the  market has to decide...
So my Ledger Nano S just arrived, I've set everything up but just realized that my pin screen is different from the picture on their website:
https://www.ledgerwallet.com/images/products/lns/video/pin.png

Mine has 8 digits, but it looks like it should only have 4? I got my nano s from LedgerWallet.com, so it should be legit, right?
These next few days are (unironically) critical for Bitcoin.
Lads, I got a Ledger and am wondering how it works between the exchange and the hardware wallet. When I buy bitcoins at the exchange and I need to transfer them to the wallet, does it go through the network and, as such, is subject to fees and validation time? So if I want to sell quickly, will have to move everything back from the wallet to the exchange and wait for the transaction to be confirmed?
Don’t worry guys, it’s just another Bart on the chart

Edit: Mah boi's tryin out a new hairstyle
proper fight on right now 
Talk about one man throwing a wrench in the machine needing grease, and possibly driving sentiment down for a day or two \- and during Consensus, even! Eisman, after CFA in Hong Kong quite possibly thinking, hmmm umm good; more than one way to skin a rabbit.
Here come all the bot sellers xD
I'd like to discuss how Theymos can eat a dick.
On the down trend until end of June-July guys, look for that low price to jump in on. 
Every $100 it drops means more of your sold bitcoins bought by me.
10k in sight
Shitcoin Cash fork is officially live - enjoy those free coins

(there are none :)

Effect on all prices?  Let's see what the lying Chinese govt coin's shitfork does to markets and itself.
For a moment sit back and admire one thing:

We are witnessing the growing up of the first pure internet money and truly global decentralized currency. 

This is historic. This is science fiction become reality. You are part of history. 
Bitcoin just took a very sickly shit.

Is there a way to see OTC orders? I feel like all these large firms and family businesses are loading up on cheap Bitcoin lately, just want a confirmation if that's available somewhere.
Fuck, hold on boys, let's not break $8000.

Nobody reads or gives a shit about his daily thread.
Lower. Told you. :)
I hope it hits like 6k again. Can't wait to buy more
Going down to 7K levels for sure. Will it bounce again? Maybe but my guess it goes down to 5-6K. 
BTC tx are slow as hell right now. I paid the equivalent of $15 and its been an hour. Nothing
Take my word for it,  this is  a VERY bad sign to crash hard in the middle of a hype fest like Consensus.  Word is getting around,  the jig is almost up.  
Love these massive red dildos.
I love how everyone freaks out when I knew all along this was going to happen. We needed to have a correction, I think the upbit news just triggered it early.  In the long run this will be healthy for bitcoin as long as we don't fall much past 7250. 7800 and 7250 are the prices this could reverse, so those are both great places to buy.
Buttcoin sucks.
I'll never forget how I got my first whiff that the Internet stock explosion was a bubble.  It was at a conference in San Jose in 2000 for Weblogic App server.  In several groups over two days you'd hear people say things like 'most dot coms aren't thriving',  'some of the dot coms are already thinking of throwing in the towel'.  It takes the industry leaders/insiders getting together to really start seeing what's happening,  besides the 'price'.


I feel like we’re gonna see a bgd any second. 

Edit:  we are due for a completion of a reverse Bart on the 1 hour chart 


Edit:  nevermind got a brd instead. My gut has betrayed me tonight. 
I'm rich making $15hr in the bay area with all the these sell thank you! This is why I never went to college
Well, reckon I should have sold at 9900, damn vacations.  With that said, I refuse to sell until it's atleast back at 9k.  To all of you other folks panic selling, have fun taking the losses.

Edit: for those of you HOPING that bitcoin crashes, you're working against bitcoin.  You wont see adoption from businesses until it's somewhat stable.  As a business owner, drops like these hurt pretty badly if I'm not exchanging for fiat on a regular basis.

Bulls are pushing it for a few days now because of Cons 2018, but they don't have the strength to lift it. Down force is to heavy. Bears will take control again! Market needs to cool down before "big money" players dare to step in.
