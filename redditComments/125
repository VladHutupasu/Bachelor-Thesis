Buy-curious ?
Hey! I just thought about the announcement that China wants to shut down the mining companies. Why should that be an issue after all? Since the hash rate adapts to the total hashing power, it is even better for bitcoin if they shut the big players down because it gets easier for normal people to mine. But I don't understand why it is always used as a reason for the price drop.

Why is it dropping right now? Did I miss something?
Down again. What’s the reason now? It seems staying over $12.5k is a struggle 
I am one of those who believe in the Bitcoin concept but still driven by the profits and investment. 

My stake is <1000 £ - so no fear of losing out as I can afford it if I lose it. So no FUD or no FOMO either..... enjoying the ride. 

By the way Cliff High says that his linguistic predictions indicate around 60K for the Bitcoin by end 2018 :) ...

Happy bitcoining everyone, peace.
Just curious are all of the people here actually confident that it will go back up or are you guys trying to convince yourselves?? I am not hating I own BTC myself, just curious.
Thanks!
IMO this drop won't stop until the popular narrative changes. Right now it's all about the decline from the ATH. It's going to be awhile before that story can change. A long while. I mean, it has to go down to a price that is supported by adoption and other fundamentals. Then it has to level out for a while so everybody forgets about it. It has to become boring. Then it will need a chance to grow based on the fundamentals again. Then the press will be like "Guess what asset grew 400% this year? Remember Bitcoin?"
mempool clearing - down in the 20-30 fees band and dropping

Panic sell everything. I’m trying to pickup more coins. The more you sell the better price I get. Please and thank you 👍
PSA: S. Korea regulatory announcement is GOOD news 
holy shit the mempool is dropping fast
With news of Korea accepting people to trade from the 30th, lightning network coming along nicely, segwit adoption at nearly 20% and low btc price right now, I think it’s the perfect time to get in as February is looking very promising! I’m excited!
What is the most cost effective way to purchase bitcoin? What am I missing?

1 - Deposit USD into Coinbase

2 - Send USD to GDAX

3 - Buy BTC with USD on GDAX

4 - Send BTC from GDAX to cold storage

If there is a better way please let me know. I'm trying to minimize fees.

So they deleted the low fees and fast lines from the website. I respect the honesty.
double bottom anyone? 
What the hell is happening to BTC. Either go 5k or 15k, no dilemma !!

I love how the fudfucks only show their face when the orange candles come about.

As soon as it rallies they're MIA.

Edit: and just like that they're gone 
seems to me like wall street is really interested in entering bitcoin market low. running a huge media campaign against bitcoin (cnn, forbes, daily whatever), having rating agencies rate cryptos and so on. we all know that those agencies are paid for their service, likely to give bad ratings in this case to make people panic and let the price drop to a good entry level. that's what wall street does. it's about profit. hodling seems reasonable, but buying now is the only way to not letting those suckers win.
green dildos all the way up to 20k!
seems to me like after every dip there should be more hodlers because only sellers sell.

but no! dips still happen. so must be manipulated to some extent.
I noticed that whenever there is a drop, BTC seems to be holding much better than the other alts.  So question - for investment purpose, is there any reason to diversify since BTC remains predominant?

shit. The mempool is literally empty. just got confirmed 2 TX from December @ 17sat/byte. 
prepare vegeta
Let's not forget it's about the tech and not the price. Crypto is revolutionary tech.  There are more bitcoin private key combinations than atoms in the universe. 
Thought you folks would be interested in this. Apologies if this was posted already.

Why do HODLers think the price will go up when it's going down significantly? 
The market looks like it's trying to decide whether to go back under 10k today.
A green light
Its time to buy
Whales dumping long position contracts all.day.long
Should’ve averaged down earlier today but just bought some more here. Good luck to all. 
Byeeeeeeee 10k bitcoin 
Is 10.5k a good buying price or does anyone think the price will continue to drop? 
dont fuking make the same mistake guys, wait for the dip to go lower and have cash ready. consider this like cheap coins^^
This might be obvious and I’m just not seeing it, but why is the mempool clearing so fast? Is there faster hash rate or fewer transactions?
What just happened? It's like this every midnight Eastern TZ, either a sharp spike up or sharp spike down. Which country/countries are waking up?
So many hodlers selling today. Panic could get worse in the short-term. It's a really, really bad sign when panic hits the early adopters. The worst case scenario IMO is falling to around 8000 - but it could be really fast if panic spreads too much. After that there's other points of resistance but most are a long way down. But this is kinda expected given the huge rally last year.
F O M O
Today’s dip is the tip of the iceberg- if it dipped as low as it did last week on a rumour - A BLOODY RUMOUR. it will tank hard STRAIGHT TO HELL on actual news that South Korea will be taxing their people 20% and up for cryototrading. I wouldn’t be surprised to see BTC fall to under 5k

Despite this

I still believe in BTC 

It’s just gonna take time for it to recover - like at least 2-3 months maybe even 4. By next year this will be ancient history and we will see record ATHs once more and even the speculators who are shorting it will take a huge loss and become believers. It will once again become an

UNSTOPPABLE JUGGERNAUT
The all marketcap top was 800 bilions US$ this year and now dump to 500 bilions, we can see on chart a floor around 400 bilions.
Wait for the top 1 trilion marketcap coming in 1 or 2 months.
Dont panic. This is how the game works
[FUD trolls](https://postimg.org/image/7w243wjrp/) are having a field day.  That’s okay, they will take a back seat again when this downward trend is reversed.  
Dont care the reason, news, FUD's, regulations, fees, Futures, WallStreet whales, and bla bla bla...
Bitcoin and Altcoins will grow in 2018, too many new money will join this great market, big oportunitys will come to who wait.
See the history chart, we can see a lot of Dumps.
Just wait, in one or two month we will see the big Pumps again.
this is bs. all the news has been good. segwit, LN, Korea...we should be at 14k at least.

My friends brother just got scammed out of $5,000.  He got a $5k check in the mail.. cashed it and sent some or all of it as BTC to the people? All under the pretense of some sort of acting gig ... I feel most people wouldn’t be stupid enough to fall for that but just a heads up. I think today is when that check will come back declined lol...
If BTC could stop sinking before I withdraw it for walking around money in Vegas next week that would be GREAT
how long do you guys think this bear market will last? just wondering peoples options, please no dumb answers. 
How come it is not bouncing up enough? Everything that could crash it already has gone through. What’s wrong with the market?
Anyone thinking of buying right now - don’t. Wait. Until Thursday and Friday then see where we stand. We are going to hit lows we haven’t seen  since last year.

Buy right before the weekend. Stock market will have zero effect since they are closed on the weekend and the news cycle is usually dead by then and if not completely dead is very slow

Do people really think bitcoin will crash and everything will slowly die and phase out?? Wake up. Bitcoin is here to stay. Bitcoin will continue to rise. Relax, the next few months will be some of bitcoins best :) 
HODL strong!

Hi guys 

I’m looking at hardware wallets. And wondering do you have to have admin rights to a desktop if you’re to use your wallet?

For example, let’s say you’re traveling with an iPhone and your wallet. And the only computer you have access to is one in hotel lobby.  Oftentimes these computers only have a browser enabled and you can’t install other browsers (must use ie and can’t install chrome) and they also have USB ports blocked off. 

So for travel you need to
Have a chrome book basically?  Can a phone be used ? I read something about androids  being usable but prob not iPhones. Right ?

Thank you

Does anybody here trade with a partner, or do we all fly solo? I ask cuz some of the stupider moves I've made in day trading probably could have been prevented with a second opinion or "Dude why the hell would you do that?"
Anyone who did some trade this year have a recommended tax software?

Good article.  This is not about BTC specifically but the entire economy.  In short, the cure to the 2008 crisis was 'quantitative easing'.  But the massive amount of liquidity pumped into the economy is now creating bubbles everywhere ... stocks, housing, cryptos ...
OK looks like transfer from weak hands to strong ones is over for now. Still, I think it'll hover around 10k for a while.
Can anyone explain why you sometimes see a series of regular (eg, every two seconds) buys or sells of the same size. Someone has been selling 0.02btc every 2 secs for the last hour or so on GDAX. Why?
Hold guys. This will separate weak hands from the rest of us. Feb is the month bitcoin will take a turn for the best. Trust me. Three weeks from now you’ll be kicking yourself if you sold. Bitcoin is about to take off again. 
I bet 20 Satoshis that we willl be okay
Green dildo alert
Set your stop losses on gdax, should be a big drop once we cross 10k
I don't know a whole lot about bitcoin but intend to put in time to familiarise myself a lot more. FOMO is making me want to put a hundo in on the dip however. Someone convince me to do or not do this pls
bitcoin will die and all crypto currencies with it. we're going back to fiat people. because all that talk about troubles in the financial system for years and years is just that, right?
Say hello to more sideways trading. This will mask the slow but inevitable and permanent decline of bitcoin. Bring on the downvotes!!

Hi - is there a way on coinbase to easily see cost basis vs. current balance?

Does anyone else find this (non bitcoin related) video extremely interesting in relation to bitcoin ? Bitcoin seems like a classic type 1 civilization tech from his description. Very cool.
Sold all my BTC to buy it back again tomorrow at $10,000
This dip is caused by the Wall Street manipulators. They have thousands of short contracts in the Bitcoin Futures at CME which expire on the 26th. BTC will drop to possibly 8K, and will shoot back up to ATH's after the expiry of the futures contract.

This happened exactly the same way with CBOE a week ago, and now it is happening to the CME futures contracts. It makes sense for Wall Streeters because they make huge profits from selling off BTC from the futures, and then buy it back up to make even more money.

I swear, these guys should get arrested for manipulating the markets. Their buy/sell pattern is so easy to follow.
first
We are into the dumps again.

less volume, a bull turnaround soon!
