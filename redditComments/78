Let me give you some life advice. Don't listen to any of us shit stains on this thread. You want to invest conservative? Do you. You want to go all in? Do you. You're into Bitcoin for the tech? Do you. You're into Bitcoin because it makes you wanna schlip? Do you. You want to sell? Do you? I've been here long enough to know that no one fucking knows.
MOON.... MOOOOOOOON........ MMMMOOOOOOO. Oh shit Im a cow
Its clear now that Mt Gox was the problem! No chinese new year, no FUDs, no ban, no whales, no futures... since end 2017 Mt Gox sell 40.0000 bitcoins, around 400 milions dollars and have more 1.5 bilions dollars to sell this year and all this sell wall mix with weak hands. So, think about it... think about all good perspectives, its a new and big promisor market with a lot of money to join. 2018 have more progress with legal laws... many countryes are regulate it... we are in progress... dont be a weak hand. Dont folow the wave. Believe and be patience. Big profits coming.
I'd keep an eye open for a potential dump around 4:30 am UTC on 2018-03-10, it's 5 hours from now.

The story so far:

* 2018-03-07 4:30 pm UTC: dump
* 2018-03-08 4:30 pm UTC: dump
* 2018-03-09 4:30 am UTC: dump
* 2018-03-09 4:30 pm UTC: dump

Of course this 12/24 hours pattern could be over, who knows.

Whoever is doing this.. would you kindly STAHP?
Hey guys. I was just doing my usual Technical analysis and it looks like Bitcoin is going to go to $15,000. If its hits $15,000 it means we are going up. However, the TA also suggest that Bitcoin might go down to $1000. Otherwise it will go sideways.

This is how fucking retarded most of you TA guys sound.
Time to face it, my friends… the only top bitcoiners are going to be seeing for a while is Top Ramen.
This morning there was the tangible sense of fear and desperation as Bitcoin was going down... and since it has bolstered and gained support. Not bad!
BITCONEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECT
lol small rise and people are already celebrating? 
Yes, my portfolio is down by 24%. But I'm not phased by this weeks "news" and I see this as a buying opportunity to invest in the future. So I just dropped another $1k on BTC.

I could have tried to time the bottom, but I suck at it. Plus BTC at $8700 seemed like a decent price. I'd rather jump in a little early than a little late.
Can we just drop to 7,5k now, so we can all buy today ...and sell on sunday :D.

Next stop $9500.....
What the hell? I woke up this morning to find BTC at $8500. Wasn't it close to $12k a few days ago?
📉 - 94% June-November 2011 from $32 to $2 because of MtGox hack

📉 - 36% June 2012 from $7 to $4 Linod hack

📉 - 79% April 2013 from $266 to $54. MTGox stopped trading

📉 - 87% from $1166 to $170 November 2013 to January 2015

📉 - 49% Feb 2014 MTGox tanks

📉 - 40% September 2017 from $5000 to $2972 China ban

📉 - 55% January 2018 Bitcoin ban FUD. from $19000 to 8500
$10k in the next 3 hours?
Stair way to heaven pattern might make an appearance.
tbh I would be happy if bitcoin stays above 9k for at least 24 hrs. That's a first good step.
Check the polarity of your daily chakra before buying. 100% guarantee success in trading. 

Chakra polarity tell you whether there is support or not at price level, by sensing pulse of the market. Ancient trick. Very popular from ancient trading times and routies in China and Asia - now the land of cryptocurrency.

To test your chakra polarity, first wash your left finger to make sure no smell. Then with clean finger right finger scratch your rectum and with your left finger scratch eitehr your vagine or your rectum, or the closest organ you think you have to either. If left finger smell like ass and right finger smell like gold, then great. If not, repeat experiment only once more. This time record in phone camera your reaction when you smell. If no one to help you to record, then no need to record. 

Now follow this table:
Left Finger Smell: Ass: Right Finger Smell: Gold: Either Hodl or you Sell. 
Left Finger Smell: Ass: Right Finger Smell: Ass : You made mistake in experiment. Right finger never in ass. 
TO THE MOON!   

Down with governments and banks!

LAMBOS!

Decentralized & Anonymous Rule!
Safest time to buy could be this Sunday, let the tides settle. Too much FUD and noise around. 
Is there going to be another dump today? The ones over the last two days were at the exact same time... do they have even more to get rid of or is it done?
Next big thing in the roadmap is the SEC deciding if icos are security. 

If no. Then prepare for another dump. 
Bitcoin being bitcoin.
2018-03-07 4 pm UTC: dump

2018-03-08 4 am UTC: pump

2018-03-08 4 pm UTC: dump

2018-03-09 4 am UTC: dump

Just sayin'.
Shoulda bought at 8400 but I'm still gunshy that homeboy is gonna pop the drop here again today around 1 pm
Is this shit ever going to end? BTC is about decentralization and unironically leads to the same issue of the top wealth dictating how markets behave. There is no such thing as decentralization
Who's down to go to #OccupyCrypto?

I am part of the 99%
If you are a bear and you bring up a valid argument, I will %100 listen to you. I am in between on where I feel the markets going to go. However, if you just throw random numbers out without any real explanation, you can piss the fuck off.
Just wanted to poll you guys on your thoughts. Do you see bitcoin ever reaching less than $1000 in years to come? Do you see it sticking around and increasing for years to come? What reasons do you have to believe what you do? 
this is all just a weird clockwork pattern. I feel like I'm stuck watching the same rise and fall trends everyday
at this point we just have to make sure Asia doesn't wake up and dump on us. Prices for North America always fluctuate like this.
I'm probably wrong, like always but I want it on record if I'm right....

We will drop down to around $8,200 on tomorrows candle, which starts in about 3 hours. Then we will shoot back up and be green for the day. That will be the end of this dip and we will continue upward to 11K over the next week.
Man where should I park all those lambos
Second star to the right and straight on till morning. 
FOMO back in GoGOGOGO!!!
fight the bear !
Weekend fever setting in for btc
I think I’m officially a hodler. Bought in at ATH, was terrified of losing initial investment in January. Now I’m seriously upset that the price didn’t dip lower so I could buy more cheap coins. 😭
Anyone who was able to buy at < $8.8 is going to be extremely happy in 6 months, and everything below $10k still looks like a bargain to me.
Which one of you ass-wipes is pushing this price up?
First Post ever on Reddit, Let me start off. I invested in ATH. Slowly added more every few weeks. My Portfolio is Negative and it was all my savings working a low paying Job. Am I one of the few that wants bitcoin to crash? Look at our world today, If u work a low paying job after being highly Educated. U will understand. System is broken. House prices keep increasing and inflation is at a all time high. Don't u want equality? Do u not crave for freedom from a system that has marginalized those that struggle while rewarding the greedy. I invest in Bitcoin and Alts for my future, for the future of all of humanity. I want each one of u. Following the price to step back. Look at what u have really Invested in. Not about the $ but the significance. As a average man or woman with Debt and struggle. We need change, we need to find our place in world driven by profit. I will not sell and I will buy more. Even when it reach's 1$ a coin. I will support bitcoin and Cryto's i believe in. We need this, U need this. Poor or Rich. A Change is required. Believe in what u invest or leave. Don't care if u crash Bitcoin prices on your way out the door. We will be stronger after.  
I just put my entire paycheck in @ $8599. Hoping for the best! 
There are so many dudes here promoting Bitcoin selling all the time clamming to be masters of trades. I wonder why. I guess we need to ban all the these dudes from this forum. This should be the place for technology and hodling. People who want to trade should open new geddit call reddREKT.
Someone is trolling us always at the same hour since three days now.
Is this Groundhog Day?
I recommend we all build up an emergency shtf bitcoin fund set it aside and get it ready on gdax. So when the next mt gox dump inevitably comes and the market dives you are ready and able to take full advantage and buy the dip.  Don’t be caught off guard and you will feel so good that you can profit from it without having to sell any coins.  And remember The blood on the streets will be washed away ... the dip will pass. Don’t miss out. Stay strong guys and gals. 
Just where are people coming up with these price predictions?

"Bro, its like, totally going to be $2695 on August 15th at 5pm. Mark my word bro"
wtf is paccoin??
Who knows the price could suddenly spike and people pulling out will be burned bad. 
Any one else more concerned about why the pumps and dumps are happening at the same time everyday? I don't think it is a coincidence. There has to be a more significant meaning than just it does down at this time and rises at this time.
Market manipulation at its best.
Nothing has left the Mt. Gox cold wallet addresses recently so unless there was another avenue for the disposal of that coinage maybe this is just the fear of that happening again. Not entirely coincidental the release of that news came just after the latest rejection at 11.5K?
Would it make sense for SMTP or TCP-IP to use a token? Why or why not?

All of these projects are open sourced but have a token that needs to be used. Could this model be applied to SMTP or TCP-IP? Why or why not?


For the past few days I've noticed bitcoin getting dumped during these times:
* 10:00 - 12:00  DUMP 
* 19:00 - 22:00  DUMP

However, yesterday's 19:00 - 22:00 dump time lasted 2 hours longer, resulting in a larger dip. 
Is there a dip every year when US taxes are due since people need to liquidate a bunch of BTC to pay their taxes?
HELP ME!
I'm trying to find a comedy video that's like a fake news report on Bitcoin but it sounds like the guy is mumbling.
Enough Vegeta episodes. Let's move on to Captain Ginyu at least. I won't even ask for Frieza yet.
[deleted]
Is 9200 going to be the new resistance? That's where it dipped yesterday
This is pissing me off. The minute I want to buy at the day's lows, it shoots back up 15% in like an hour. I'm just going go about my merry way and ignore the market. 
Not just 2 days, I see this almost three months, shorting on GDAX, several time a week. You can see too, when all market start red, so the bots start shorting
lol, just rebought back my bitcoins. Guess the 19:00 - 22:00 crash isn't happening
Not sure I have the balls for this shit.
who said bitcoin going down to 3000 and spreading FUD?
Who didn't hodl?  Bunch of liars
is this move just to kill the shorts?
Well, after the mayhem over the last few days, we may be seeing light at the end of the tunnel.

This from BTCManager today:

"Back in early October 2014, a disappointed bitcoin holder dumped 30,000 coins on the market when the price was on its support from its previous all-time high. Someone thought the party was over and decided to cash out and almost drove the prices to levels seen in 2010."

The Gox Dump has has the same effect, but again the community has stood strong and there seems to be pressure on Nobuaki Kobayashi to deal with creditors in a less damaging way. 
If he distributes creditors funds in fiat, it could mean that no more large sell orders effect the market.

The upshot is that in October 14 the community defeated the Whale and that reversal fed back through the market in a positive way. 

We're not out of the woods yet but now it's clear that among other less damaging market factors; the Gox incident has largely been responsible for this fall, the public may again begin to rally in support of Crypto and recognise that the Crypto community remains united and stronger than these massive forced market swings.

The full article is here:

I fail to understand what people are freaking about. Isn't regulation of exchanges a good thing? That way ilegal trading strategies like wash trading, and pump and dumps, and fake walls will become that much harder to do. This market needs to get more legitimate and stop being the wild west. The SEC is just worried of dumb retail investors losing money to smarter, sleazier people.

Though I guess most people in this reddit sub are of the less smart retail investor kind whom actually freak out every time a stupid piece of news about regulation comes out.


So, how about those lows. Buckle up on the party train continuing! 

Choo-choo!
[deleted]
Hold on boys the charts show we could break $ 10 000 soon
Today bitcoin made circle of imagination pattern. It mean, from here only two paths possible. Either moon or down. We all know this. Then why we here? What this circle tell us? 

The answer is in your imagination. Close eye. Deep breath. Then ask - ask yourself. Ask your good friend. Ask your enemy. Ask your family. If you conscious, talk to your dog. Build your imagination first. Then think chart. Then think price. First imagination. Then chart. 
Before we had the dip I sold my btc to take profit and bought a new Imac. Im glad I didn't just HODL the whole time and took a risk. Now I have a huge screen to watch the show.
Do we have anything nice to look forward to? Or anyone got a list of "Good things to come"?

Seems like we had Segwit, Bitcoins first major hard fork, Revolut and Bitcoin Futures all towards the end of 2017.
Along with Thanks Giving, Christmas, New Year which spread word of mouth.

2018 doesn't seem to have anything to offer except FUD - even Robinhood only active in 5 states so that hardly matters. No word from NASDAQ about them offering futures. Its all looking pretty grim.

Looking forward to the bottom this time around :) 
Good early morning USA ( and the rest of the world course) how's everyone else? $9000 wow!! Have I missed anything?
Looks like an eventfull day is coming up. Ready to rollercoaster after my coffee. Late night last night
Higher higher and higher lows. Time to buy.
This looks more like FOMO than a genuine recovery 
Here we go again!
Bought at the dip $50.  In two days ill probably profit $8. I don't know how you niggas do that 9 to 5 shit. 
Just bought 50% of my funds - 26k at $8890. Will just hold it till $9900 before I sell. Easy money next week. Will keep the other 26k to see if it goes to 8k ish over the weekend or ill buy $9500 if it goes up and keep it till $10500. Buy low ..sell high..easy money...buy with money you can keep...till it gets to the price you want.
I have some good news and bad news. Good news: BTC's dominance is rising above 43%. Bad news: the price will crash by the same factor.
This is fine. *sips coffee*
Put some money aside just incase this thing wants to dive back to the depths. Hoping for a bounce back but i'm sharpening my green harpoon just incase.
this sub goes savage again lol, you will know in next 10 hours of severity of the drop and whether it continues strong. 
going 10x long on bitmex ride or die baby!!
First comment :) is it ?
Holding since 9.8K. My view: if 8K-ish holds we bounce back up hard. If it does not, we go down even harder. Whatever the case that's what I'm basing my buy/sell strategy on.
I sold everything i had in crypto (with huge losses)... I lost more that i can afford to loose. Now i think i will wait 2 years to buy back in. When i look at the 2014 bitcoin chart, it took 3 years to recover after the crash ! It could do the same here
ICEBERG! dead ahead!

Let’s go bitcoin, let’s go! Clap clap!
Let’s go bitcoin, let’s go! Clap clap!
Let’s go bitcoin, let’s go! Clap clap!
Big balls buying now, next 4 hours there could be a big dip because next sell period, nice guys, though I am gonna let you go first and check if it's safe.
Im off the a place with no internet...aka no price checking for the weekend. buy order at 8k hope it doesnt fill. Godspeed friends
Down the waterfall we go!
damn somehow i enjoy these red lines. i have capitulated anyway haha

When will the pain be over?
Fastest way to actually receive bitcoin in your wallet??? 10k and under ?
Vegeta
Vegeta time. It’s over 9000!  Where are the memes?  (Well almost). Was for a second on Bitstamp 
Is Sunday dip still coming?
To buy or not to buy????
This shit is way too predictable. Someone probably has a bot set up to liquidate their bitcoins from 19:00 to 22:00 EST. There is no way in hell a person can always dump at this exact time unless they have great time management skills
Other exchanges do it same. They make money by shorting, owners of exchanges just human, greed human. I remember case with Armstrong and Ver, when they manipulated market, insider trading. Do you believe, that this people stopped? of course not, they have tools for manipulation and insider trading. They still do it.
What are wallet seeds? Is it the private key?
Info needed 

Who controls the bitcoin price,because everytime I buy it I just buy it for the price listed ,how and where do I bid ,thx 
Buy orders are drying up

where is the over 10k meme?
down down and down
attention ..
https://twitter.com/MtGoxMon

Seems so far I was right, it just took 1 day longer for it to happen. :)
Looks like the crash is going to continue much farther this time. My tinfoil hat is on but I don't think it will help me when btc hits 5k.
Fakeout. We're going down. Bitcoin will always fuck with us.
What a place!   A few hours of BTC/USD going down, and everyone is about off off themselves.  An hour of it going down, and it will soon be a replacement for gold.  Oh, and along the way also fight off that other BTC thing.


After a careful consideration, is the IQ here really that low?   For sure, many here *should* lose their money to scammers!  
**Strategy for today** - locate the bottom if it reverses and buy responsibly.

Otherwise, enjoy the ride down :)

Good luck all... 
welp, this is bad
https://seekingcryptos.com/2018/03/09/regulators-increase-scrutiny-bitcoin-continues-sell-off-bitcoin-looks-like-digital-gold/
There's still blood in the street guys. 

You know what to do. 
Upward movement now buy hold and park in wallet and dont sell to the whales  if not sure what to do repeat the step above
You guys have lost the plot that is all I have to say. Lambo, hodl this that blablabla bitcoin was back in the hey days, it will never go to all time high never it will just keep fluctuating it goes down easier than it goes up because the professional money left the building. 
This Mt Gox douche is attacking, throwing all sorts of grenades at bitcoin.  Probable sitting at his desk having a blast....
Has the price ever gone backwards?

We have up, down, sideways, but no backward

I hereby declare the backward movement of the bitcoin price.
OK.  Let the celebrations begin!   TO THE MOON!  CHANGE THE WORLD!   Until things go south again.   
1k by tomorrow lets go bois
Whales are cashing out. BTC is highly overvalued and big money is starting to realize its time to abandon ship. The average majority will be left getting screwed over, same story different movie.

Thank you for your donation to the elite upper class again, be sure to pass by Wall St on your way to the credit consolidation office and thank your local hedge fund manager for the opportunity to gamble in his market.
It is not over yet the next dive is toward 7900 range
do you see any future for Deep Brain Chain guys?
It's tax season, the dumb asses who are on their last fiats are going to be pulling out their BTC because they didn't allocate their funds correctly. Big Fish and Small fish can be the same amount of stupid.
IMO, bitcorn will go to -$800.
[removed]
Dont buy the dips!!  How many times you guys wanna get burned?  These weak recoveries in price is all you dip buyers lol.
Crip toe is dead. Exit all crip toe.
If price break above 9300 it is the sign of bull 
What is urgently need is strong government regulation and a swift clampdown on scams.   Some sobriety among bitcoiners would also help.   
I am so happy to wake up and see it not only didn’t crash but it is higher than where I bought 🙂 good job guys 
Catch a falling ~~star~~ knife and put it in your pocket, never let it fade away!
🐈 
This will bounce between 8400-9000 all day imo
I bought $400 and it dumped.. sorry guys
did anyone check the coinmarketcap PACcoin is in 3rd place
guys check coinmarketcap, paccoin is the 3rd biggest coin?
Above 8.5k and already people are hysterical ...
Where's the drop for today? I want some cheap bitcoin.
Still 8/9k ..... Boring.  Seems like only the whales and exchanges doing the pump/dump making money.

Zzzzz ...........

michael novogratz said bitcoin will reach at 40k dollars. don't sell. just hold. high risk high return
fees are up is this a spam attack?

Still don't believe me? $7000 by Sunday.  Retracement levels mean nothing now.  If you really want to buy in,  wait until April when the price is <$4000. Though, even that may be too high.
Price too high too low don't matter. You look into your soul first. The chart don't tell you truth. You first activate sage mode by opening all gates of chakra. In the chart you see chakra first. Chart comes from chakra. Cha - k - ra. Then becomes chart. Don't put all faith in chart, but do read chart. Don't act with fait at all. Act with judgment and vigoursouly victory will come to you. If you think price go down, you sell. Otherwise hodl. Victory is yours. Just follow heart but also read chart
**2018 Cryptocurrency Crash (Elliott Wave): Bear Market Resumes**

https://redd.it/7z8u6n
I sold at 9200. My gut is telling me there’s no way it can keep going up because bitcoin lawyer can still dump his coins. The fomo is real though
LCT is +5% on Poloniex right now. From now BTC is going North... + 10k soon. 
Nice pump. 800$ dump in 15 minutes
And, there it is. The last peak we will see for a long time. Don't say I didn't warn you as you wake up Sunday morning to find the price in the low $7000's. 
It's a pity, that people don,t understand that. They still believe, that BTC will grow, but it never happen, every time regularly , the exchanges activate their bots and market fail again. They make huge money, still BTC in same position. 8-9-10-11-10-9--8-9.... and so on. I dont believe that BTC will be even 15 k. They will not be allowed to grow to such a price. 

Another big dump coming today. $7000 by Sunday. $4000 by April. 
$800-$3k is the bottom
Now would be a great time to sell what you got. AMIRITE?
2018 Prediction: BTC will be valued at about 3.5K by November.    (As confirmed earlier, the high for this year is 12K and will be reached this month.)
