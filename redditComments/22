I feel that Bitcoin needs to shake more btc out of alt-holders before it can continue up.  As a percentage of the market, Bitcoin is 36% right now, during the peak of the alt-boom in early January, Bitcoin was 32.5%.  Still feels like many alts are overpriced.
Going to keep ramming 9400 eventually itll crack and take off
I am only 20&#37; down now and it's an amazing feeling. \(Got in November the first time we hit $10K\)
Doing that thing where the price goes flat for a while and then goes very up or very down
Does lightning network poker exists yet? I could imagine it could be fun if the channel is updated at every action. 
I'm having a beer and a barbeque.  Sausage anyone?
Get ready for the Monday morning Asian pump! Another hour or two and this thing is going to start moving.
Need help with a debate guys !!!

So in my university a debate about cryptocurrencies is going to happen next week. I'm one of the participants on the side that supports the use and existance of cryptos. I need your guys help to prepare to the debate. For example what are the arguments in favour of cryptos. Any help is welcomed ! P.S-I apologize for any errors in my english
Good morning everyone.  
Why is it, that since visa/mastercard supposedly banned crypto purchase with credit cards, so many exchanges still show it as an option to pay with credit card?

I've tried several exchanges and my credit card always gets declined, with one reason notification even saying "Do not honor." My visa debit works just fine.

These exchanges are teasing me with even having the option for CC purchases.
Someone needs to "Pump up the volume"!

Just a thought, April 17th was the last day for taxes, meaning May 8th should be the 21st day for returns. We should see some heavy action around then right?
Should you use a new address every time you receive bitcoin?
I'm exploring and learning stuff about the Lightning Network. One thing about scaling is still unclear to me: if we keep the 1MB - 2MB block size, and there's 1 million channels opened and closed on average daily, wouldn't that make opening and closing the channels relatively expensive (fee >$50) or time-consuming (2 sats/byte getting confirmed in about a month)?

When a channel is closed and settled on main chain, who pays the blockchain fees?

And how can you close a channel with dust, e.g. 105 satoshi? 
every drop is being bought back just as fast. The last week has showed us this is clearly going to keep moving up. 
Toro, Toro!üêÑ..Bull impales bullfighter in the rectum
low volume breakout, on a sunday night. Think we just need more time. It was hard to sell into that move so not too many buyers above there. We need more time before a real breakout

Apparently 1 bitcoin is worth exactly $9400

More FUD on ZH .... completely untrue
People said we broke the december down trendline but everyone is drawing it from the december upper wick down but if you ignore the wick this is what you get:

BTC seems to be reacting to it right now and this would mean the down trend hasn't been broken yet?
Would be good if we could get to around $9500-$9600 for a few days and to hold it there before we push for $10k
Sell at 9500 buy at 9200, this shit's way too easy lol
Low volume and ascending wedge = bearish?
This price action is garbage. Will it ever break 10k? At this rate,  I could care less if it falls to 5k. It's all the same as far as I'm concerned.  Lame.

When will there be better security at ATMs??? This is now the third time where I have been held up, and this time I lost over 4500$!! Not to mention the times the ATM delays the transaction and you are left wondering when you are going to see the transaction. Sorry, just frustrating that these guys seemingly just hang out near ATMs and wait. Ruined Saturday night. 
Are people getting mugged at these bitcoin ATMs.. Wow.. All of our whales are getting mugged. Something needs to be done and quick. Esp. in 3rd world countries where they rely on these exchanges..
