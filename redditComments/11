Daily Discussion, May 10, 2018
Took this time before the next big breakout to buy more Bitcoin.. and I am excited to say I now own over one whole Bitcoin!
Bought @8950. Fuck it...
The road to 10k, part 2 - this time it's personal!
pay day is tomorrow, I'm buying some whether it goes up or down
Well if that‚Äôs the bull run over, then it was the worst bull run ever. 
Why is there no Daily Discussion for 11th May yet?
This dip made me giggle. 
Relax guys, it‚Äôs just a korean new year 
Why is the volume so low? Sub 5k on GDAX
Hopefully it doesn‚Äôt go below $9k, otherwise I would lose all my new investment forever 
Always a silver lining - Btrash has tanked.

:)
Support at 9000/9100 is strong. I expect 9400 tomorrow again
We're still in an uptrend with higher lows. But to be honest, I'd love to see some higher highs, as well...

edit: this post didn‚Äòt age well. ‚òπÔ∏è
Was there just a huge Mt Gox dump?
At least we have volume now...
*giggling intensifies* 

wow, definitely wasn‚Äôt expecting to wake up to this 
Hardly any panic selling after a large dump.  Looks bullish to me going into the weekend   üôÇ
Well just bought .0385 of BTC. If it keeps dipping, I'm buying more :) but definitely not selling my btc. My goal is to have 1 full btc by this year so every dip I buy to increase my portfolio.  
I'm just gonna write this here, n00b as hell.

I transferred BTC to my Jaxx wallet 3 months ago. I can see the transaction on block chain.info if I search the address, but it's not appearing in the wallet itself.

What happened?
This dip is surprising..thursday was really strong the last weeks

Kinda getting terrified of it dipping below 9K. Support has been really strong, but man...
wtf is going on with this price. BTC just cannot sustain a 2018 rally to save its life. 
I hope what happens here is Europe comes in, they go "OMG it's cheap, conference next week, history of a bullish influence, $9k held more or less.. Buy, buy, buy !!"
Well at least the volume is back. 
Wow, for the first time in a while I am actually shocked by a dip. Was not expecting this one at all üò≥
I'm 19 years old and own .25 btc can't wait to be retired at 25.  
I honestly didn't think we'd see prices under 9k again after last week, figured it was the floor, even though I'm disappointed that it wasn't the case, I'm also happy that this might allow me get more btc for cheap as I work towards owning 2 full btc
6k wooooh letz goooo HAHAHAHA HA HA HA HU HU HUHUHUHUHU üò≠üò≠üò≠
Does anyone here think next weeks conference will bring Bitcoin above 10k again? Really craving to see my holdings skyrocket in value üòç
It's a trap guys. There has literally been nothing but good news lately. The Whales are trying to FUD you into selling before next week's summit so they can buy lower.
**Buffett 'Disciple' Condemns Investor's Views On Bitcoin**

https://www.coindesk.com/venture-capitalist-disciple-of-buffett-condemns-his-views-on-bitcoin/

Venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya has countered billionaire Warren Buffett's recent derogatory statements on bitcoin, stating that the cryptocurrency is "important."

His comments come after Buffett, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, argued that bitcoin is more of a gamble than an investment at the end of April, and then, last weekend at a shareholders' meeting, he said bitcoin is "probably rat poison squared."

While calling himself a Buffett "disciple," Palihapitiya told CNBC that Buffett is wrong about bitcoin.

"Not everybody is right all the time," he told the news source, further suggesting that that knowledge about technology is not in Buffett's "circle of competence."

Palihapitiya, a former Facebook and AOL executive, went on to push for the cryptocurrency's benefits, saying it is a replacement to gold and:

"Something like bitcoin is really important, because it is not correlated to the rest of the market."

Speaking about the financial crisis, he said that "things that we thought were hedges went away" and "broke down." Bitcoin is viewed as providing a hedge to traditional finance by those who have owned the digital currency, he said.
The more it drops the more btc I make! Bc it's on sale! 
target this week: 10k8
Will America push us up today?
Tension is rising...
So New York wakes up and the sell orders come flying in!! 
We're going all the way to $9400 today. MOON shot!
Rumors of bitcoin on wallstreet + the fact for the last three years bitcoin has had all time high during summertime.... what do you guys think? Moon soon??
Interesting, seems like someone's actually dumping a ton of real BTC here, no long/short games.

Anyone thought about setting up a LN on a Raspberry Pi as a project?  

Looks like a fun and cheap project.  I'd like to have my own node :))

(Someone not banned please post over on r/btc - they might want to try something new and groundbreaking rather than just stealing.)


Bitcoin looks like my monthly statement right now. The pumps being my income and the dumps signify bills and when things break unexpectedly. I just keep hoping nothing breaks ....
damn!!!

buy a trezor directly from trezor, and dhl send me a message that tax for import are about 95 dollars!!!

then check using my mail box and import taxes are about 5usd!!!

im feeling tempted to cancel the order :(
Oh poop.

Somebody go kick vegeta awake. He may be needed soon 
Approaching 9k!

Is there a meme for that?
It‚Äôs over 9000. Hopefully for good!

Edit:  lol or not 
wtf going on?

Is this the lull before the storm?  The Concensus Meeting starts on Monday and many expect prices to start going up this coming week. 
I don't get all the negativity

A slight dip and its the end of the world

I thought you lot were made of sterner stuff where has all the positivity gone

Its a great buy in opportunity
Facebook are releasing a shitcoin
Lots of investment this year
I think most of us are bullish long term

Man up bois
Hey guys, hows the Rat Poison today?  :-)

Will we see Bitcoin at $100k within the next 10 years? 
I'm told we get banned here easily. Why?
This is the bottom. 

Why do I know that? If I had my coins on an exchange I would panic sell now. 

Whenever I did that in the past, the price started to rise and I would lose coins.

Luckily I have transferred all the coins I had remaining on an exchange to my hardware wallet last week, so I can't act on impulse anymore.
When moon
NVIDIA forecasting less mining.  Hence the drop.
Free .... Free falling 
I actually believe this is temporary 

Waiting for the right buy back in price

It has dropped a few hundred not thousands lol
Just as I predicted. We will see 7.8k here real soon.
What is causing this massive drop?

Edit: Sudden
So the comments last week got me excited and I purchased at $9800.  :/ Less than 500 usd. Am I going to lose it all?? I know that‚Äôs peanuts to most of you and I can technically afford to lose it but really don‚Äôt want to.  Is it worth it or should I just pull it out?? Sorry..I‚Äôm new to this.
Would someone who knows the latest about Lightning Network be willing to answer some questions?

* Were any major unforeseen technical hurdles revealed during the Alpha or Beta phase of LND? \(please describe\)
* Exchanges surely want to give their users the option of instant\+free deposits and withdrawal \(thru Lightning\). So what is preventing more exchanges from offering Lightning deposit addresses? Or are they still working through the unfamiliar territory of running a 24/7 uptime LN daemon?
   * If you work in a technical capacity for a crypto exchange, your voice would be valuable here.
* Would it help LN adoption if light\-wallets started using Lightning Network as the back\-end by default \(while hiding this fact from the GUI so the end\-user doesn't get scared or whatever\).
   * I.e. can we anticipate "psychological resistance" to Lightning wallets by non\-hardcore users?

Thank you to any respondents!
whats this xapo vault thing doing rounds. how does it work? i wish i may need it some day ;-)
Fuck me the suspense is unreal 
Well that dildo is the wrong colour.

Good to see something happening though.

(Massive RED on Bitstamp..)
Thoughts on Robinhood? 
An honest question, with all the effect bitcoin had globally and how brilliant the whole idea of the technology behind it, do you think that governments didn‚Äôt really dig to find who Satoshi is? I just can‚Äôt find it easy to believe that. This bit of bitcoin creation is just very very surreal for me to believe, the idea of a mysterious person inventing something this big, holding this huge amount of money and power (let alone brain), and just be able to disappear.
Sure this doesn‚Äôt change anything about bitcoin, I just can‚Äôt believe that it‚Äôs not some government agency top priority to identify him/ her/ them.
Looks like the rest of the world is just now getting around to reacting, after hearing what those 2 poser's Munger and what's his face had to say about it.
All I got to say is I didn't lose any btc and that's all I care about. I'll pay double for what the price! I'll pay $20 of btc for $40 right now 
Fuck my ass
Old generation of redditors showing up again. We may see MrManHimself soon again. 
Why?Suddenly the bitcoin price falls down...and still falllllllllllllllllllllllll...
Butter my arse!

The dickline is fading into the distance .. 
Is anyone here?
All hands to the lifeboats!!!  


Do we still expect a big up turn next week when the meeting takes place? 
This caused by stupid activity.

Bitcoin Gold up 50%, Bitcoin Diamond? - not just shitcoins - non-coins pumping for days.  

And BCash pumping.  Known scamcoins pumping.

So easy to pump Bcash - I could pump it myself by a few percent.

Now all is collapsed.  Serves all the liars and tricksters like Ver, and the day trading gamblers right.

Bollocks can never sustain.

But look - BTC is less badly hit than all the major coins!!!

What a FUCKING surprise, that something honest and established sustains.

Well FUCK ME ROGER.

Too much shit in this space chaps - 

I've said enough.

Have a good weekend :)
This market is trash
LOWERRRRRRRRRRR.
Hodlers:
Price Drops 25%. "It's only a Minor Correction".
Price Drops 50%. "This is good for Bitcoin".
Drops to $1. "You should have invested only what you could lose". 
xD
8k here we go!!!!!!
**Come on Bulls, the mood is positive, lets get it to around $9450 and keep the rally going!**

Where's your God now?
I'm betting on 3K. What about you all? :)
**Support The Bulls!**
Okay Lightning question: In order for a merchant to recieve lightning payments het must have at least 1 channel open with a customer with btc on the customer side of the channel. In the network payments will flow trought these channels. These channels will be super important for the merchant because they will be their gateway to the network. Will this not lead to centralisation and hubs that will keep these channels open as a paid service (through fees for example)?

This will be the last time you will see BTC below 9k lol
‚Äã‚Äã**Bitcoin is Hovering Around $10k**

The unsuccessful attempt leaves a small hope for a second growth and a break through the psychologically important level.
