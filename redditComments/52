I think we are near the bottom. Source: my bottom. 
Murica fuck yaa. Alarm went off, time to dump the fking market yaa.
My opinion on how we got here is on October 31st CME announces futures trading.  Institutional money knows they can exploit this feature on a major platform.  So they started buying up bitcoins until the FUD starts for segwit2x in middle November.  Segwit2x was an attempted takeover of the development team by major businesses in bitcoin such as the DCG bitpay and coinbase.

After that fud passed the institutional money continued to buy.  This happened until a little after futures started going live on December 11th.  Later that week we hit the all time high and in my opinion this is when big money shorted bitcoin on CME and sold what they bought on the run up to 19k+.  This was a big move to make money and manipulate the market with the help of mainstream media and fomo.

After a few months of shorts this is where we are.  We are near equilibrium with a lot more users, LN is live, and there's all kinds of great stuff going on in bitcoin.  

I don't think the price will go much lower, but it can.  I think we'll start to see some calmness in the market as we grow.  Bitcoin is bigger and better than ever and this is a really exciting time. 
Bears. Bulls. Battlestar Galactica.
Alright I bought some more to help the cause.  Letâ€™s get to 8k soon peeps!
Goes up a 100 itâ€™s a pump goes down a 100 itâ€™s dump. Itâ€™s that simple....
The BTC price is going to start shooting up. 

I've been watching long enough and I feel like sentiment is changing. I've never made a prediction before, but it just feels like it will start running up.

People sometimes get intuitions about these things, and this is mine. Something about the market tells me it's about to pop.

*HODL to CODL* when you give Bitcoin to your children on landmark birthdays in case you did not see here's a case for CODL (Clever Old Dad Learned) is what they might say see https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/88ug07/just_bought_the_dip_and_will_put_one_btc_on_look/?st=jfi8kmlh&sh=b4d95585

Wow, quite the rise, welcome back 7k!

Do anyone believe this is mostly bcoz of leverage trading..?i strongly believe this people are going long and short and this getting more popular day by day...u cant make profits if BTC is stable in leverage it needs to be more volatile..people in telegram and discord groups are following signals..
crypto cant grow if leverage trading becomes popular..
this is my first post in reddit
please correct me if i am wrong.
Coinbase is at it again... remember those "duplicate charges" that happened back in Feb? 
Well, I finally got it resolved at my bank and got the money back into my account, only to have Coinbase charge my account again, for even more. 
Do yourself a favor, and close your Coinbase account! 
So, if you purchased 6 months ago, you would essentially be at the exact same spot price wise. 

What's to prevent the same thing happening the next 6 months? 
Yawn... so were just gonna sit at this price forever huh
Comrades, ve moon now... 5.4.3.2.1. POJEHALI!
I would be careful with selling at this point if the goal is to re-enter at a lower price. Sure, you might luck out, but you also might not. If you sell for profit and don't plan to buy in again then that would be a different matter.

The market is different at this point than when we had a continuous downtrend. There is much more confidence and buying pressure at this level and point in time. I wouldn't be surprised to see occasional sudden spikes, which have already happened a couple of times, even during the night when everyone thought the buying volumes were low.

While sudden drops could happen, they might also be cancelled out by quick bullruns, resulting in squeezing shorters and bears. A higher price altitude would be a safer terrain for those that plan on selling and re-entering at a lower price point. Plus, better margins for gains.

After the worst crash this year to 6k at February 6th, we didn't see the 7k level again for weeks after the market had recovered and passed that price point. This doesn't mean that we can't see a worsening of the market, I just wouldn't bet on it.

This is merely my humble opinion. Stay safe and avoid risky bets.

Is there an optimum amount of nodes in a blockchain network? How many is enough? When do blockchains become "secure" (maybe robust is a better term here)? Do the number of nodes give diminishing returns on a chains robustness? Is robustness a word?

Cheers. Just some thinking. I'm  sure many of you have had some of these thoughts and there is good literature out there, so looking forward to learning a bit today about node network mechanics. 
We had 4 big pumps and zero dumps and downward trend, think its not that hard to conclude its pretty good time to sell before big dump comes. 
I have still some blood in my alcohol stream, so bear with me. I didn't see [this](https://www.tradingview.com/x/7N1fZ6pT/) happening in real time 'cause I was busy with bbq ribs but now that I see what happened it looks like all those predictions about 3.5-4k within the end of the month may be utterly wrong by a long shot. We know it's a manipulated market and we got used to pumps but that one looks quite odd to me. And not because of how much it pumped the price, which is pretty normal by btc standards. It's not a matter of how much but *where*. It happened after the long term trendline was confirmed broken [two hourly candles below the line] and it got us back into the "safe" zone. To me it doesn't look like it was an ordinary pump. It was a rescue.

/back to bbq
It looks like bear trap, pretending like bull trap
Now some action begins, will be interesting to see how it plays out.
I think the fact we didn't get as low as we did in the first week of February is a good sign. However, I still think we haven't really reached the capitulation/ despair levels yet.

Bitcoin curious here... never put money in but watch the markets from time to time...

How much does it cost in electricity terms to mine a bitcoin these days?
it strangely looks like somebody tries to keep the price at or above 7000. ps: i dont know anything.
Ay Bitcoin! Why you trying to stabilize now? Wait til I get my Lambo first.
Here's a question I have to bitcoin investors. If the trading volume of bitcoin is directly related to the price, and the trading volume has steadily decreased every month since the new year started, how do you foresee the price increasing rather than decreasing as interest fades and other better coins take more of the market?
i don't see any breakout or any big buy volume, just seems like a lack of sell volume that's creeping the price up.
We moon now?
anyone saw that fake 111 btc wall disappear?
Bitcoin who the fuck are you
Last week I lost my shit, then recently found new shit.
This is just the beginning. If we want to reach the moon we need to fight! HODL!!!
I almost forgot what it was like to wake up and see Bitcoin has gone up, lets hope this continues.  
Just bought for the first time since oktober,  i think we are close to the bottom now 
[Totally organic, no pattern, no manipulation btw](https://imgur.com/a/VPowu)
This bitch gonna moon so hard
Will BTC pass and hold above $7100 today before a potential rally to $7500? what do you think.
we need a 2nd layer solution to avoid the taxes of an on chain transaction. I was thinking LN could give you the option to settle your channel with newly bought BTC and then return your original BTC escrow.
I am so happy to wake up to some green today 
**Above $7K: Bitcoin Eyes Gains After Death Cross Fails**

https://www.coindesk.com/above-7k-bitcoin-eyes-gains-after-failed-death-cross/

Despite having witnessed a so-called "death cross" over the weekend, bitcoin (BTC) is now eyeing gains above the $7,000 mark.

The much-feared technical indicator (bearish crossover between the 50-day moving average (MA) and the 200-day MA) was confirmed over the weekend, but, as anticipated by CoinDesk, the oversold conditions seem to have put a floor under bitcoin prices.
I have one problem, I can't buy any bitcoin.

Because all my money is already bitcoins since 3 years ago.
45 BTC just sold on GDAX at $6988.99
Due to high resistance and low trading volume, bulls doesn't want to take risk, and retailers start selling on top
The price is getting squeezed nicely. Needs a breakout soon...
What is up with this bitch ass volume
I imagine a world where every country has their own blockchain, and we still have to pay a fee to swap. That's what I see happening.
New to this,  dont really understand it, but wolud like to learn from where sto start...
*Test comment, please ignore.*
Never underestimate bears,previous rally to 7300 was easily pushed back by them.
They say *Never look a gift-horse in the mouth* but it's important to have answers. How was the price kept hovering above $7000? How did it shoot up? Definitely some manipulation here.
To the people who say bitcoinâ€™s a bubble, I would say bitcoin is the pin thatâ€™s going to pop the bubble. The bubble is the insane bond markets and the fake equity markets that are propped up by the central banks. Those are the bubbles.
I think it's about time we had the talk about the bears and the B's r/Bitcoin.

Hey fellas, wanted to share an analysis of BTC price action with the community here https://youtu.be/6OKUQ37lP3Y
these minor btc movements are made by exchanges to eat our money through commission, no organic movement until Japan morning time

Guys, bitcoin can up this week?

I just read the 'Manipulation Cartel' post from 4 days ago.  It seems a loopy conspiracy to me.  Could it be that exchanges have been loaning shares to short sell,  and are not reporting it?   It would fit the events.  Options trading launches,  very little action,  but NO OBVIOUS SHORT INTEREST,  that would be blood in the water to a pro short, especially bitcoin.  Never in history did so many pro shorts pop a chubby at the same time!


Why so much worry about BTC value in fiat terms?   Fiat useless so that is why BTC will replace it and become global one world currency!    

1 BTC = 1 BTC, never you forget!
there's the sell bots again.

Hello everyone, I was wondering what options there are out there for setting buy and sell orders on BTC? I mean purchasing BTC with USD and setting my orders for when I want to buy and/or sell. Thank you

Arguing about trends?, the trend right now is that Bitcoin's future is undecided until June. At current hedge fund managers are probably steering away from buying any Bitcoin until they know more information leading upto that point. Chances are they'll just re-iterate what they've said in the previous summit, look for a rock bottom price to buy in at, after June we should be heading back to the moon. 
6am New York time, lets see what happens when America starts getting up. 
Today I got my paycheck and quarterly bonus for the first quarter2018. Waiting for a big  dump. I wish it will come before rocketing up.

big bang theory bitcoin episode on now! 
Good luck everybody.... I just close all my short and long positions.... I brought in June and rode it all the way in December... Bought some more durning the February dip, but I have some business to take care of.... I never sold durning the dip, only bought.. per say advice from my Reddit Hodler friends...
I will watch and wish that all of my Bit-coinerâ€™s and HODLERâ€™s make it to the moon!!!!

Hello I've participated in an give away on Twitter.i've sent my fraction to the address that was on your Twitter page.
when print tethers?

Just woke up. Nice to see, we're back. We passed a few important TA barriers already. Shorts are going to get squeezed.

This is going to be a good day.
Bitcoin adoption is lagging. CME Futures was a big hit, but now that price has crashed to the max who is actually interested in adopting this thing?

So i guess what it comes down to is the hodlers. If they continue to hodl and defend some kind of low for the next year or so, then a new bull market can start, and maybe people will be more keen to adopt it then.
No, the banks in America will not stop working. There will not be an apocalypse, and there is zero reason that suddenly all governments switch to Bitcoin. Won't happen. If bitcoin was more used over banks, then the entire United States would have fallen, and global currencies with it. Dream all you want for the apocalypse, but if there really is, don't you think there would be no electric grid, and therefore no bitcoin?
Oh look another 200 dollar pump followed by 24 hours of sideways/bleeding. Boring as fuck.
Hi friends!

We added the new section on Bitgur: https://bitgur.com/alerts . It's alerting service. We have 3 delivery methods: telegram, e-mail and browser push. Alert types: price range, price above/below, price change relative/absolute. 

Could anybody try it and tell me an opinion? :) 
Its going to $6500 soon
I was expecting bullish start from US morning, but they said good morning with bear cake
a lot of buy pressure at close below 7k
Bored to death, I close out the day with a little over $75 profit... 5 minutes later. 155 pump... my trading luck as of late. Goodnight BTC
In the immortal words of a Peter File...

"Ma ma se, ma ma sa, ma ma coo sa." That's right, someone better be startin' something. Daddy needs some Jesus juice.
With all the money miners have invested, they can't afford to sell bitcoin for less than about $6500. 

Only a few cheap electriciy countries can afford to do that. And those people are rich enough to hold their coins for a decent price rather than sell cheap.

We're getting to the point that a lot of people can't sell for much less than $6500, unles you are holding bitcoin that you bought back in 2017. Most of those people aren't in a hurry to sell cheap either.

The price could only go below $6500 if the people that don't have to sell decided to sell en masse. Or people just decided to sell at a loss.
who dares buying? deathcross is happening right now
