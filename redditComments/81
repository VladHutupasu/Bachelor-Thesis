lol. Just another ordinary day in Bitcoin Land.
[deleted]
If there‚Äôs one thing I learned about dips it‚Äôs DO NOT FUCKING SELL
Leaving for Basic training in a couple hours. Threw $100 into bitcoin and I have no choice but to HODL 
**BUY, BUY, BUY!!!**
FUCKING LOL @ people losing their shit over a $1000 drop. Give it time buckos, you'll get to a point where a $2000 drop or gain in either direction doesn't even make you blink. 

And you think this is 'tough'? When BTC is around $50,000 you're going to see swings of $5000 - $7000 in a day. 

Don't go full Carlos with the "WHATTTTAMMMMIGONNADOOOOO??!" shit. Just enjoy the ride. Nothing you ever invest in in your life will bring you these highs and lows the way Bitcoin will. Be thankful you're living through this. 


400 btc sell wall on bitstamp...this will be interesting...
Come On America, we need your help today. 
my bad: I bought BTC yesterday afternoon
Bitcoin is still up 38% in the last 30 days when it was trading at low $5,800s...
cute rally
Dont worry be happy ! Hello all in BTC we trust.
It's raining knives!
these fake buy and sell walls on GDAX is entertaining to watch
Getting into bitcoin feels like playing baccarat 
[deleted]
Great, it took almost 10 days to recover from 9,7k and only one day to drop 1,2k. Same thing, week in and week out. This is becoming so frustrating to watch :( 
**This is not a huge sell off, it's gone down about $100!**
fall asleep at 11.5k, wake up to 10.8k >.>
I'm turning superstitious at this point. I bought some alts on Sunday with a stop-limit in case things dipped. Then I finally figure "screw it, it's Tuesday" and moved everything into their wallets. Hours later... Boom!

However, now that BTC has dropped I kinda feel that I don't need to look at the charts every 5 minutes wondering what it's going to do.

I'm not gonna play the Tether game because I seem to mostly make crap decisions. I guess I'll just hold everything through this and see what happens on the weekly rather than focus on the hourly. I haven't invested what I can't afford and I'm in this for the long-game.

I guess my biggest fear is that these "normal" dips make people leave the Crypto Market. Maybe better education/awareness of Crypto can prepare young investors what to expect. But that's a whole new thread.
Hope you bought..
Ah man... bought at 11.2...
looks like bitcoin just bounced off support
Will be interesting to see how Asia treats this low priced bitcoin when they come online soon. 
Wolud love to see some serious bull action, like a crazy rise to $15k  
if bitcoin tests its support again, it's probably going to break it.
on the upside: at least the volume is up
As much as I want BTC to fly, I could go for a fire sale.
It's gonna go back and forth between $9k-$11k for awhile...
There... she goes.... there she goessss again
This dip is from weak hands. It steadily climbed to $11,700 but every $50 people kept calling a dip trying to freak out weak hands and finally a few at the top decide to sell and then the weak hands cash followed by the fudsters in these forums. Now it‚Äôs people in the comments saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs gonna hit 7k‚Äù trying to sound smart but really just burning the foundation of crypto looking for karma... I made my profits and the rest is just money but this is why adoption will be slow 
Is there any service that allows you monitoring huge bitcoin transactions in the network or transaction from a whale? I was thinking about this the other day since the market is so volatile, knowing that Whale X just sold 1000 BTC before the block gets added to chain might give you time to do some smart transactions before prices drop. Is this useful? will you pay a small fee for a service like this?
well fuck, I should have put a stop loss order overnight in case this shit happens
lol this CNBC FUD is funny. I'm starting think that's what caused the panic from 11.3k to 10.9k. 
[Y'all know what to do.](https://i.imgur.com/DR6TZnv.png)
Too early to buy rn?
Will the recent news of Gary Cohn resigning mess with the price of bitcoin? ETFs have plummeted but I don‚Äôt see why it should effect anything in crypto. Want to hear your opinion, please. 
Any opinions on what will happen IF the Federal Reserve does up interest rates and potentially causes a huge stockmarket correction? I always treated the stockmarket and crypto separately in terms of money flow. Is it though..
Massive drops in bitcoin internet searches. Suggesting that people have lost interest.
keeps testing right around 10.5k... jump on the floor too hard and end up in the basement....
Time to whip out 10k memes again.
Bull trap boys
Booooooouuuuummmm <3
Ok. [This is insane](https://i.imgur.com/5gviDdN.png). Try it for yourself.
Buy high sell low boys
Look at the 1 day chart. If this thing turns around near 10,300 and starts climbing again, theres a good chance we will break 12,000. We could be nearing the end of the bear. BULLISH! 
After many months, I have finally learned.  All my buys are small, fractional, and dispersed - so I stopped buying high and selling low.  So take that BTC!  I still have most of my $$$ sitting around waiting for you to tank.  So keep dumping you piece of shit - this time I'm ready for you.  The more you dump, the more I buy... and this time I can follow you all the way down to the basement.  Bring it you bitch!  Time to finally make money off the panicking ass hats.
The return of boughts will be funny after this little fall.
Is this just a temporary correction and we will start heading upwards again?
I Sold .18 At $11,323 for $2007 with a fee of $30. I wanted to buy back in at $10,908 but it shows a cost of $2004....something doesn't seem right on coinbase. Shouldn't I get it for $100 less? Is that $30 fee included in the $2007 or on top?
My transaction was confirmed with 3 sat/byte fee! Dope. 

Also am i correct that my address starting with bc1 is segwit address? 
Is there any negative news about bitcoin?
Make us proud yanks ;)
yuge buy wall on gdax
Now pulling up like an attack aircraft after dropping napalm on all the weak hands!  Torch'em!
whos done the ledger update? 
http://segwit.party/charts/

is that true?, segwit reaching 60% then fall to 30%
Is there an audio book of Mastering Bitcoin?
lol, I'm starting to read FUD TAs
Enjoying the ride? :P
Watching bitfinex orders chart, i think it will hit $10,500.. 
Oh the Whales cash out again...always the same.

When I look at this I tell myself that there is still some market share to win. 
the bulls are back in town?
If you are trading BTC, you are doing crypto wrong.

Buy BTC and spend BTC.

Thats the best way to make money on crypto.
Oh hell yeah. We're going back down.
It's seems January is lasting a very long time this year. D***mmm, where is our üöÄ, enough fulling up, let's fly soon.
Cup and handle pattern forming on the 1D chart.

Which doesn't mean a flying fuck but hey, one can hope.
[CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/05/bitcoin-more-likely-to-be-100-than-100000-in-10-years-kenneth-rogoff.html), stop spreading FUD nonsense.
I'm at a loss here... Honestly I don't hold any bitcoin currently, I am invested in a variety of alts (trx, xvg, ven, poe, kin.) It seems every time bitcoin goes on a bull run alts bleed, ALSO when bitcoin tanks alts bleed. When exactly do alts not bleed?!
Are we dead??
lol, 4 hours to go up from A to B, 5 minutes to get back down to A. Oh BTC, you so funny.
are we out of the woods yet?
the pump seems like it has no legs. now, the people who bought into this will sell more.
Come On The World, Bitcoin needs our support tonight.  We need to get to $11k 
[deleted]
I thought the big break was 15k...why are we looking at hourly/daily when we should be looking weekly?

We just had a convergence on the MA on weekly chart...heading to the bull run!!!
to be frankly, I did not expect that :(
Dont miss the next train when it will leave the gare. <3
Quick question...Do you recommned spreading out your money into different exchanges, or keeping your money with one?
I don't think RSI will go below 50?! would be a good sign if it bounces back off that; I believe. But then I don't really have a clue...
[deleted]
What‚Äôs a decent, easy to use wallet to transfer my money from Coinbase? I don‚Äôt want a hardware wallet as I don‚Äôt have very much bitcoin so it‚Äôs not really worth it atm
[deleted]
we are going to wake up the HODLERS soon 
bull bois so eager 
O.O
Did you guys see that ?
Why does CNBC keep giving Tom Lee a platform? He has been consistently wrong about bitcoin . Its not going to 20,000. I wold be amazed if it got to 13,000 TBH
@Bitcoin Twitter page temp restricted? 
U call that a dip? Pathetic.
any explanation for this huge sell off ???
Go team America!
My *newbie* observations:  Firstly, people want to HODL, they want to not focus on market conditions. They'd rather wait as they have a belief that the coin's value will rise to a super high. However that HODL dream is disrupted by the day traders who only care about making money every day. They will buy on what they see is the day's low then sell on the day's high. However this selling disrupts the HODL dream. The only way the day traders will HODL is if there is a serious momentum behind it as with the mainstream media of late 2017.  

With all these fluctuations it makes me wonder if the predictions of $1million or even $50K are actually realistic?
[deleted]
Im guessing this selloff gained some legs with the ledgernano update?
Is GDAX price chart acting funny on the 1H and 30 min timeframes for you guys as well? https://i.imgur.com/Y4MSxfx.png
looks like the buy bot is awake.
Richard Heart seems like he would be fun to hang out with except then you'd have to be hanging out with redneck flava flav
5k ples
The little bitcorn that couldn't. Next time it breaks 11k I'm pulling out completely.
LOL. Back in the same spot. It won't have organic growth.
Below 10 k on its way
$10600, sink you bitch
I just sold. Sell all your fucking shitcoins. Ver was right all along.
[deleted]
You're here to find this: yes, it's really over this time after 10 years, this one is it :( bye
buy the dip at 10k
This is the end; sell off coming. $4000 will be tested by week's end. Don't say I didn't warn you. 
10.750 incoming
How low will it dip? I need to know for my first purchase
ok wth bitcoin. I was only gone an hour and bitcoin rolls over
Fast Goes Cryto
- Draper up first, 5 years no more fiat.
- He doesn't know about WomenCoin (WOMEN) $0.002726 USD (11.69%) 
[This dip is actually good?](https://youtu.be/_XBjsjplSw8)
The North Korean news might be linked to the price drop
