Daily Discussion, February 23, 2018
Sick tired of this coin not going anywhere. Hold my beer, I'm going to buy $10 worth of BTC to spice things up. See what happens.
Sold at $10,395. Bought at $10,324. I am a trading god.
Okay, BTC, we need to talk. 

You're in an abusive relationship. 

$10k is not treating you right. 

He keeps putting you down all the time and you don't know whether you're coming or going. 

And hurts to see you getting continually dumped for no good reason.

This can be easily fixed. 

Just get over $10k and leave him behind. 

Never look back. 

And don't be afraid. 

We're here to support you.

Run, Bitcoin, RUN!!
I feel these daily threads are a great research tool for someone studying retard behaviour on the Internet. 


I'm watching these books on gdax like "Thanks stranger for selling 7 coins at $10,227!" All the meanwhile, I'm praying and do ritual dances on my 0.10 hodling.
lambos suck, i want a tesla roadster so I can travel to the moon too
Anyone else ever try to trick bitcoin and PRETEND you're going to buy some, just to see if the price drops? 
Just listened to a talk in my work (large civil consulting firm) about how blockchain technology will revolutionize the way we work. Real-use cases such as how it will be implemented with ‘Building Information Modeling’. Very positive case of adoption in a huge industry. Exciting times, this is just the beginning! 
I think somebody took that dead cat, tied some beer cans to his tail and sprayed some turpentine on his butthole. 📈
Just a thought... I got my tax return yesterday. Used about half of it to pay off some bills, but I'm considering to use a portion of the other half to put into crypto. I can't be the only one thinking this. 

You think we could see a buying influx just from tax return money?
If people stopped selling I could get my lambo tomorrow

To the Moon! :D 
Drunk Friday - Price Increase

Hangover Saturday Morning Regret - Price Decrease

Selling Sundays - Price Decrease

Boring Mondays - Nothing Happens

Anything can happen Tuesday Wednesday Thursday

Follow these  :)



It always goes up on Fridays but not until people get off work in California  because it has a bigger economy than most countries. I would say about 4 P.M the bull run starts
We just make a cat's pajamas pattern with conviction, follow through from here will be violent but rewarding.
I'll see you guys in Lambo town.
looks like it's going to be a long weekend
 Bots can manipulate crypto markets by artificially inflating the price. Their automated trading behavior leads new traders in cryptomarkets to overpay for the coins they are buying. The classic “pump-and-dump” scheme that was popular in the early nineties and made famous by the Wolf of Wall Street Jordan Belfort is still being run effectively — by bots — in today’s crypto markets. This scheme involves coordinated purchases of low-priced coin to “pump” the price and attract new investors who are easily excited by the increase. As investors unknowingly buy “the pump”, bots dump the asset in near perfect coordination. With no new buyers coming into the market, the coin quickly loses value and investors are left scratching their heads — and agonizing over their wallets.
RIP to those who panicked yesterday and allowed bots to scalp their coins up in 9600-9800 range. 
Yes! Let's get out of this sub 10k funk! Stick it to the man!!!
Stare at GDAX, think positive thoughts, remind myself to inhale/exhale every once in a while, maybe eat something today, etc. 

Hope we kill it today! Like most weeks, bought what I could afford and it's not going anywhere. 
Its a great day guys! USA USA USA
Y'all can thank me for the rally. I sold some partials last night. 

Good news is, I sold my initial investment. So now I'm just playing with profit. 
Lets make the 5% increase since 12am GMT into >10% 
Don't worry, be happy ;)
Classic Friday pump. Still loves it though.
Weekends are always fun. Until Sunday comes.... the red sildos are so strong on sundays 
Moon moon moon time baby!!!
Here we go!

My Technical Analysis on BTC in the short term
Suspects a further price drop until everyone gets their monthly salary. 
I think we will see a much brighter day for BTC compared with yday.
Alt are in green % time for BTC to arrive in it soon too
[deleted]
nano ledger or trezor?.
Everyone on here yesterday was freaking out lol. Lots of new kids playing ball.
I just realized that VISA/ Coinbase/ Whomever is at fault has overcharged me more than $700 over the past month with duplicate charges. This will be fun to get worked out. 
The Miami Bitcoin Hackathon recap is up! [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7zqhw9/miami_bitcoin_hackathon_2018_recap/)
Looks like we are going to have a Friday Night Battle!  
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7g9cd3/its_official_1_bitcoin_10000_usd/
Wake up the bull
These $400-500 dumps within 30 minutes suck. 
Kind of off topic, but somebody really should create a privacy coin called "private bits". 
Everyone: Yeeeh BTC is going up

BTC: hey guys check this out
I’m mentally driving my Lambo over the BTCUSD chart. It’s a bumpy ride and it’s fukked up the suspension a bit.
Oh look, prices are 'down' on what happens to be the day the majority of the US gets paid.
Don’t be fooled. The time to buy is now
So after 10 hours of trying, I have come to the conclusion that Bitcoin is impervious to by Jedi mind trick of trying to manipulate the price to 35000$.  It just keeps dropping.  Hmm, come to think of it, maybe I should try again, but this time focus on manipulating the price down?
YES! Ban over!
Goooooooooooooo Europe! :)
In what timeframe can we expect Bitcoins second layer smartcontracts? 
I would like to buy some cheap bitcorn. Please can we make the price dip to 9300.
A lot of people are getting in sub $10k 


Will be good day for BTC, and for nerves of the Hodlers.
Green time.
America is waking up slowly now, lets hope they continue this uptrend. 
Where going up up up!!!!
green, green and more green, im already on the paradise?
red dildo, who was the idiot who bought?
So. 1970 Dodge Charger or 1969 Ford Mustang?
Just a random question: How many of you are miners (bit- or altcoin).
Well, it looks like we're in another sleeping cat pattern.
Yesterdays Discussion thread was much more entertaining.
get ready https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7g9cd3/its_official_1_bitcoin_10000_usd/
According to my TA and to my spider senses the current hourly candle and the next will close green. It's mostly my spider senses though.

edit: one down. I suck at TA, so it must be blind luck
The bullish weekend trend looks to continue 
yes, and so several times a week on a regular basis
Idiots aside just having fun noticed every time BTC moves up by $1000 the other coins crash so why not help to get rid of the shit coins by luring more people to BTC as they steal our market share due to false promises in these shit coins people are going to loose a ton of 💰 
Took the advantage of the dip, wish I could buy more.
bitcoin has create such enormous mental world in which we all here live in one way or another... thanks guys for all the fun with you...
Are we expecting the usual Friday price rise?
Prepare for take off 
Please get me to like 15K so I can pay off my credit cards lol and feel like I've hit sort of my moon ha
make bitcoin bull again!!!
10 & 20 Week simple moving average NAV/BTC.... interesting pattern: https://imgur.com/GBlmCRO
Cryptocurrency markets are here to stay, and it’s likely the bots are as well — as long as the market remains unregulated. There is already a large volume of trading bots operating in the market that the vast majority of investors aren’t aware of. As investors become more savvy, so too will the bots. And so we’re likely headed down the path of an arms race. As detection tools get stronger, developers will look for ways around detection. As bots get more advanced, platforms will accelerate research and development to counterattack. With regulation seemingly right around the corner, only time will tell which side will win the fight until the government steps in to stabilize the market and put an end to predatory bots.
For the traders what is your favourite time for trading? I’m in the uk, it seems to me the best action is in the night. 
Looks like only bears left in USA:)
It's a warm 76 degrees celsius U+131° west meridian. I wonder how miners are keeping their equipment cool.
Waiting for next weekend.
What's up with the volume, all the alt coins are way low too.
mempool?
https://venturebeat.com/2017/12/14/how-bots-are-manipulating-cryptocurrency-prices/
Do you think that day trading is the only chance now with all this manipulation?
what's up with the mempool? it's constipated again
On 1h chart everything goes from one bull trap to another  from 2days. It is disgusting:(
Hopefully the price will stabilize. For us HODLers what matters is the long term trend anyway. 
I bought at 9200 one week ago.
I sold at 9900, regret that I didnt sell @11700
Good morning and DOWN we go. Hold on tight!
[deleted]
10500 is really close! Lets break it motherfuckerssssss
 Bitcorn is going to turn me into a slumdog millionaire.
[deleted]
Candles are red, Bitcoin not dead. 
Just bought some, price looks reasonable. 
Oh boy. Look at that bitcorn.
 Bitcorn can’t make its mind up what to do.
Arghhhh.....attack of the red dildos. 
I just bought the fucking dip
I will be able to buy BTC $@8k soon, so excited.
[deleted]
No moon- soon time for shorting again and everything will be red. Dont be naive. The exchanges bots waiting to start again. 
Volume is too low. Its a bull trap guys
[removed]
Question: is bitcoin a proof of concept or are people considering it as a viable alternative to currency? I might be mistaken, but the transaction fees seem a bit insane compared to other altcoins, I can't see anyone wanting to buy a carton of milk when they have to pay $30-$40 to do so.

Edit: (I'm not taking a stab at bitcoin, I think what bitcoin has done for blockchain is phenomenal. it's an honest question) 
[deleted]
People selling are just strapped for cash. Ive bought as much as possible 
Guys & Girls, I think btc will do what it gone do today but maybe not. 
Wow guys I just got myself a deal with some company. Yeeeeeeeeeeees they need my services to promote their brand and sell fartcoins.

Captain FUD
Having fun with my imaginary bitcoin and EMA14. Bought at 9270, sold at 9870, bought at 10200.

see guys, time for shorting-everything are red. Not just BTC. The bots start make money for owners
Just somebody make money,  (using exchanges bots) look- all market red. After several it turns green again. Relax. And forget about moon. This new time for all cripto-just shorting. that is all.
Now the most important thing is -HODL. The main owners of bots in Hong Kong. But people not aware about this, so the market will be manipulated by sucking all the blood. For a while the bots will stop, so that the people of the fool believe to the moon!!!! and then start everything again
I only know that the market is now highly manipulative and is based on naive faith "To the MOON!"
[deleted]
This dip is just the start.  Down to 0!!!
Shouldn’t we just give up here? This manipulation will last forever. Sorry for all guys that bought on December...
[deleted]
Stop feeding these whales and invest in solid coins with good tech behind them like Walton and icon!
When bitcorn doesn't know what to do so it just goes down.
psa: don't invest recklessly
Did anyone get a blockstream mens hoodie and if so how does the sizing run? Lol 
[removed]
I watched a really good Elliot wave chart analysis.  Looks like another downward trend will hit us in March, maybe as low as 4800$ before reaching for the moon.  Bring it on I say, I want to buy, buy, buy and just waiting for that low super good deal.  
Under sub 10k again! Yay!
Idiots from europe selling off no contribution from their side to lift the price they do this every day
