Daily Discussion, April 24, 2018
Out of interest is there any reason the DD threads aren't being stickied anymore? It is such a pain to have to search for!
Well folks - looks like we may have gotten through it. The last 4 mos have been hell.
Shout out to all the HODLers out there.  
Who would have thought that Bitcoin could recover from a 70% drop after it has only done that a couple of times before?
Someone said this on this forum....**"There is no better anti-depressant than Bitcoin when it's rising"**  :)
Fuck it went all in this morning (UK) wish me luck

Go big or go home lol
I am now above even. Yay!
I bought and lost 500 dollars right away...
I'm laughing my ass off at all of the "TA guys" on Trading View. Gotta love Bitcoin and its unpredictability. 
HODLing to those gains after buying in at the 6k low has never felt sweeter ðŸ‘Œ
We are well past the cock gobble resistance line. Macaffee is on target to not have to cannibalize his own cock on TV. 


boom! 

$9300 broken.
If anything I think Tom Lee's hypothesis that tax selling was keeping the price down was mostly correct. The slow rise of the price now is just the normal market movement where the number of buyers > number of sellers. As long as there is no major fud I think the price will continue to slowly rise.
Good morning everyone, just got to work and saw we have passed the $9,300 mark. Very nice to see, next resistance/test level at $9,800. Keep hodling especially with the upcoming meeting which we'll see big money come into the crypto space.
Woke up on the East coast to BTC @ $9,300. Good morning on the up and up! 
anyone else thinking we are gaining too fast?
New ATH this year?
Asia gave us the boost. Hope the America's can hold it.
I am broke until payday and the fomo so bad right now. It's over Â£6700! By my estimations we've recovered nearly half the value which was lost since early March!
9400 is going to be hard to crack
9400 on GDAX!
Looking good.

Where's that falling to 6k chap gone?
Anyone else can't take their eyes off GDAX price charts the last hour? We broke 3 major walls since 7PM EST.
No biggie.  People cashing out because it hit a certain number.  Itâ€™ll go right back up.. momentum is there.  And yes, this is just my opinion, not based on anything else.
**Come On Bulls, keep fighting!**
My TA friends

What does forecast look like today ?
Im pretty happy the way this board is run.

No spam from shitcoiners. 

/r/cryptocurrency seems to be infested with marketing companies. Its awful.
So BTC was hovering around the 8.9K mark for the last several days, unable to punch through 9K.  Then it happens today.  Any specific news that is helping today's run?
[deleted]
Is bitcoin ready for a bull run? 


Or will fees explode like last time? 
9.4!!!
To me it looks like $12k by Friday or Saturday. 
I noticed that Bcash has been pumped hard lately. Is Ver really that desperate?
Not cool asia
I've drawn some lines on a graph, and also noticed we've only gained 20% so far this week.  That means we're still definitely in a bear market, crash is imminent and we're heading to 4k. 


Ignore the fact that I've got a massive short position and I'm desperately hoping the market will fall.  That doesn't invalidate my expert analysis in any way.

 - Every TA expert on this sub. 
Remember those who said bitcoin died? lol
I just checked the log chart for the first time in a long time. 

Even there we have clearly broken out of the downtrend.

The bears have been defeated.

Profitssssss
Bit of resistance at $9330.  Lets knock it down. 
How safe is the electrum wallet nowadays? 
It started... :D 
Good morning. How's everyone doing today?
I  fomo oh gosh :\(

What a strange battle that was.
anyone else setting aside a set percentage of your income to buy BTC?
buying more baby
I wonder where this xyz123 shorter guy is now?
**Hopefully another Asian push coming up tonight.**
Amazing how far weâ€™ve come in a few weeks.  Iâ€™m finally ahead in my crypto portfolio!!! 
New A.T.H. 
/
thoughts ?
Guys...what am I supposed to do with my hands in these exciting times
This reminds me of Mt.Gox day
Well that was a shit show last night
Goodnight everyone. See you when us Americans awaken to try to keep it about even for another pump from Asia. I love you Asia.
**Keep going Bulls.**
Alright guys, not much time left to get yourself 4 figure btc, don't miss out on your likely last chance in history of being able to get it this low
and here we go a red dildooo 
**Support The Bulls.**
Funny thing is: I just can't imagine where all the money is coming from right now to push the price up. 

The "common folks" are out for now. They dropped their bags near 6k and are licking their wounds. They will fomo back in at a much higher price.

The hodlers (like me) already invested as much as they could.

Then there are short term traders, who tethered a lot, but I don't believe they will have enough power to sustain a run like this.

Who's left? Institutional money?

edit: Why the downvotes? This is an honest question. And a request for discussion.
So it's been a great day in Asia here today. What is America going to do when they wake up?
Tons of volume on LB and off site trading. Love the crypto booms when they happen 
We look so oversold actually. Ive 400$ on the sideline. Waiting for a dip. Well. Somehow it doesnt happen haha
Butter my arse!
That buying pressure is a beautiful thing to see :)

edit: trying to resist against 20 BTC + 30 BTC sell orders on GDAX...
Tiny dump to $9,200 which was expected since we can't always keep going up. (correction taking place)
We are going to be stuck at current price levels for a few days. That gives everyone some time to check their couch cushions for anything you can put towards btc. I'm currently in the process of selling my winter beater(my 2nd car) and all that money is going into btc. Let's go bulls!
Sure, but if your are long 19k may not be considered expensive if you believe the price will go way higher up. 
I see consolidation, for another big pop
I recommend you doing what you are comfortable with. Invest what are you comfortable with losing. Itâ€™s all personal preference. 
sometimes when i load back in to exchange its on 15m and i almost spit out my coffee; use to looking at 6 or 1 hour hahahaha
Loving this price movement the last few days. January-April 12 felt like a test of our collective patience. Can't imagine what it was like in those years when the price didn't move for 8-10 months.

Some really intense action today
[deleted]
$300 drops in 5 mins, lol then back up
I'll start: Oh no guys. How low do you think it will go? Market manipulation. Pure market manipulation! (Totally silent on that point while it was bullish BTW) As soon as it hits 13k again I'm out! At least there's strong support at $50.
What is considered a good volume for Bitcoin?
Tested 9.8k and we failed. Drop to 9.2k necessary now. Everything is fine. New run now 
Possible Batman forming on the 1 hour?
**Come On Bulls, keep fighting!**
welp the EU is making a bit of a mess today...
We need to keep this at a reasonable level until the Americans wake up. 
Now pamp eet
Shheeeeeiiitttt! We gona own da moon son! 
Is there such a thing as a 'good whale?' 

Something or someone helped with that spike to $9200. And there was that news story that one person/entity purportedly pushed the price of Bitcoin up last year. 

If true then that means somebody is pushing to get the value higher!
I hope weâ€™ve hit rock bottom for now 
I love the smell of profit in the morning. Oh, Bitcoin, you keep me hodling on.
Dude I feel the pumping. It's hard to explain. 
I opened a shift card with coinbase (basically a debit card) which i will use for small purchases like coffee and lunch. I encourage everyone to do this to help support the use of bitcoin for transactions. 

Plan to fund it each week with with some funds gained from trading BTC
Good morning from Europe. Price is looking good. A small correction inbetween. But that's ok.

I'm happy.
No one talking about the vulnerability found to steal private keys from air gaped computers that was released today? Israeli researchers found something...should do your research. Tried to post link to article but was denied earlier.
Soros is probably laughing his ass off from this rise. It's a shame his older brother was not as successful as him and ended up dying early.
Opinion: What is nightmare BTC development for traders short BTC futures?  What does their daily limit up disaster scenario look like?
if every individual and institution hedl i wonder what some of the bids would be. 
Just look at all those sell orders disappearing
Abra lets you trade in and out each coin without any fees... what's the catch here? If its soooo good then why isn't it better than coinbase, or is it? Wanting to add some $ to it but just want to know what I should be aware of most while using it...
Big bearish pinbar forming on the 1 hour GDAX BTC chart. Anyone else seeing it? 

EDIT - so much for that bearish candle, bitcoin is unstoppable today!  :)
Hey fellas, back with another live analysis of BTC price \+ some live trading. Open discussion for anyone interested.

Please stay below 10k for the next three months and let alt coins have their day.
