Someone should make a crypto price tracker that mimics the weather apps.

Bitcoin forecast tomorrow: 

$7500

Light chance of bears

Feels like $8200
Anyone else sick of seeing bitcoin between 6500-7000?
Market tries to go up and someone is like forcing it back down.. wonder who wants to really sell at these prices.. at this point now feels like pure manipulation to accumulate on large scale and later moon will definitely come, just need patience... whales and institutions think long term
This market is best example of "Calm Before The Storm" I have ever seen...
The price is not down, it's exactly where it should be! Before the price started it's insane exponential unnatural rise, we were sitting at about $3k (already up from $1k from just a few months before). 

It started to double fairly quickly at a faster rate than usual, and reached $6k. This was due to very positive outlook and the great potential in the long run. Then it hit $8k. At that point, justifying that price was becoming a bit of a stretch, but you could make the argument that Bitcoin had a really bright future and huge potential. 

When it went above that, that became just insanity, and it was hard to find logic and reason for the rise anymore and for that high a price. There was no change in the technology, or usage. 

So really $6-8K is a very reasonable price, it's where we were before we lost reason and logic, and this is where we are back now, because that's really where Bitcoin should be
Looks like twitter enabled the bought handle that I wont name here. Whoever owns it starts talking shit about Bitcoin right away. God I fucking hate Btrash and any jerk off that owns it.
These artificial sell walls popping in and out of existence multiple times a second are getting more than a little annoying.
I believe we will go to 6900
Is there a place in Manhattan where you can buy bitcoin anonymously and get a paper wallet? 
I like Bitcoin.
What is going to happen today? 
Someone wants the price to stick at 6740. Wonder why? Is it gilfoyle? Keepung his mining profitable?
Hi again, I need some help. Please pardon me its not BTC related though. I am trying to send an ERC-20 token from a Chinese exchange to my ledger nano S. But the exchange is showing that this is not a valid address. Could someone please help. Thanks
lol that pump out of no where
If this imitates Friday's play it will go up to **$7,100**!
How do i choose which altcoins to expand my portfolio with? I just keep going in circles on google trying to determine which to go with, is limited supply a good measure to judge with?
The order book buy side is really building on Bitfinex, I'm not sure if it's an attempt at manipulation or genuine, but normal is 2500 bids, were seeing 4000 up to 6000 at times...
right back where we started 
Bitcoin will go up eventually. Just you wait. Words from a holder who bought at $1000-$3500 and didn`t sell at $19k.
Attention: We hit the bottom on Feb 5th, onward and upward! 
Taut
For someone who bought and sold a small amount of bitcoin before the big spike, when would be a good time to get back in?  Is buying coin directly still more beneficial than mining?
Id love for somebody to tear this apart: https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610783/bitcoin-would-be-a-calamity-not-an-economy/
What's everyone's opinion on hardware wallets nowadays?  I own both, and each are excellent in their own way. 
 From what I can tell, both Ledger Nano S and the Trezor wallet were about even, given that the differences between the two were; 

* Nano S used security hardened chips
* Trezor is open source  

Ledger seemed to be the king given the lower price, however now you can pickup a Trezor for cheaper.  Personally I prefer the Open Source nature of the Trezor, given that both support passphrase encrypted seeds, it doesn't matter that someone could theoretically retrieve the seed from the device.  On the Trezor I can verify this is true through reviewing the code, however I can't verify that the Ledger isn't storing the passphrase to an encrypted seed.
This was one of my first actual large purchase with 100% bitcoin in jan 2018.
It felt good using bitcoin for what it was intended for. 2018 ram power wagon new at a dealership they used bitpay service ..The easiest purchase of a vehicle ever.

I will say it was bought with all profit from bitcoin as well.! 
Man, pump me up!  Love this .85 cent increase in the last hour.  To the moon Alice! /s
At least we‚Äôre not dropping. üëç
There! It just moved $5!
We are all equal with fucken brokers and whales in this block chain platform. The only difference is, whales are loaded and brokers are literally broke.... haha
Is this very low volume a major concern? 
$6900!  $7500 here we come!
What just happened to the BTC hashrate???
Market is quiet because of rumours about huge investors entering.  Large investors are waiting for someone to pull the trigger.  This will be an investor led boom, not a mom and pop one.
I've got a feeling we will get back to around $6900-$7000 later today when the Americans get going.
How do you verbally pronounce HODL or Hodler? Is it a short o or a long o sound?
Despite how evil I believe Soros to be, he has traditionally guessed (and gotten right almost every time) the big swings in money over the past couple decades. It makes me uneasy with his investment firm now testing the bitcoin waters. Additionally with a few more whale like figures such as the rockefellers I'm starting to think bitcoin could see a strong bull run in the next months to a year (after a corrective phase - to which extent I have no idea. My guess would be ~5k). I want to hear your ideas/opinions on this please.
Hello Bitcoin community!

I have some unfortunate news for myself but some good news for you. I am selling my Andres Antonopoulos The Internet of Money: Five Years Later in Chicago on April 25th. You can direct message me about the tickets and we can work out a way to make a safe and secure transaction. 
when will Bitcoin Get Boost?
I'm waiting on my wallet to come in still then transfering what I have in my coinbase.  One question I have is what happens when we've mined all 21,000,000?  Do we all panic?
Price seems stuck in the $6500-$7100 range for the past week.  

Low volume because not a lot of sellers left and buyers don‚Äôt like buying on an overall down trend.  
Might be stuck at these levels for a week or less until an up trend is sparked.  
**Is 10 Bitcoin enough?**
Moon now?
6900 or 6200?
Anyone else feel like it's ground hog day?

It's not dead, I saw it move.  Good for Bitcoin.
Was hoping to buy in late this weekend when it dipped below 6.5 again but it never happened. Hopes not dead yet! 
Shower thoughts, if new bitcoins mined each year was the **only** thing regulated by government would it help or hinder
To buy or not to buy at 6750... that is the question. 
Not sure I've ever seen 8 flat 5 minute candles on gdax before
Best of luck!
The low dips are slowly going up as i predicted Where my crystal ball at?
It moved.  Who's been poking it with a stick?
**Bear Market 'Largely Over,' Crypto Fund Manager Claims**

https://www.coindesk.com/bear-market-largely-over-crypto-hedge-fund-manager-claims/

Timothy Enneking, managing director of Crypto Asset Managment, LP, said Monday that the winter in cryptocurrency markets is "largely over."

Crypto Asset Management, which was founded last year and has roughly $20 million in assets under management, saw its CAMCrypto30 cryptocurrency index fall by 69 percent since its high in January. Enneking sees four reasons for the collapse.

Asset consolidation, regulatory concerns, massive liquidation by the Mt. Gox trustee and startups' selling crypto assets to pay salaries and expenses are all factors in the market's overall decline, he wrote.

"Consolidation after the amazing 2017 increase" drew back some of the funds invested in cryptocurrencies, he said.

Invsestors are also likely wary due to recent regulatory actions. While he did not cite any specific events, the report comes just weeks after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission subpoenaed startups with initial coin offerings.

It remains unclear what exactly the SEC is looking for, though an official confirmed "dozens" of investigations were underway.

The other two reasons likely had less of an impact, Enneking said.

These factors have mostly been priced into the cryptocurrency market already, which, despite the recent rout, is still up by over 600 percent in the last 15 months, he wrote.

Enneking also noted that bitcoin's share of the overall cryptocurrency market has fallen from 45.7 percent on Dec. 20 to 44.3 percent. This decline in "BTC dominance" has coincided with a decline in correlation between bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, he wrote.

While the note does not comment on what declining correlation means, it could indicate that the quality of individual cryptocurrencies is beginning to have a greater influence on their market prices.

The combination of these factors indicate that the market should begin rebounding soon, he indicated in his report.
6 hour chart shows a clear head and shoulders, double bottom and low volume. Rockefeller and Buffet moving in behind the scenes... Could this be the end of the bear market?

How can I sell shares I don't own, only to buy them back at a lower price?

Moon now?
HODL!!!
According to some analysts (don't ask me who), 6550 is the bottom folks. It is not going below that number. Solid platform is forming around this number.

Take it or leave it. You have been told :)

All predictions are out-of-backside so make your own decisions :)
Guys it pains me (after seeing it go to almost 20k) to admit that i've always (since '09 boys) thought of bitcoin as being a shitcoin. At this point i realise how it works. And am still struggling to see it's place or usecase. Not only does everything we have right now seem to be better, but also any technological breakthrough "our" engineers might ever come up with, seems to me to way better serve the current system rather than bitcoin. I genuinely feel the talent we have rn  developing "decentralized" projects is being wasted (not to mention manipulated by conmen). Socially ppl need not only a central point of control, but also a central point of trust.  Can you, r/bitcoin, honestly say you'd rather trust no one for better or for worse and take matter into your own hands win or lose?
We moon now?

I invested in alts a few days ago and maybe I picked good ones, but they're increasing in value by small amounts. I think bitcoin might do the same.
I felt a disturbance in the force. But now it's gone.
completely baseless speculation, but I feel like once we get out of this 4 month long triangle/flag pattern, whichever move it initially make will be a fakeout but on a higher timeframe (few days). It'll break upward/downward and stagnate to load up on longs/shorts and then make a sharp opposite move to liquidate all the positions. Just a guess for the traders out there.
Ew...
Almost 9 in Moscow. I feel a Russian push.

Hello everyone,

found a Chart on the BTC here. Are the bearish times coming???
Here the link: https://de.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSDT/ukONW59p/
Bitcoin is so boring now, the price is literally like something you'd buy at a store.. *Come get your Bitcorn, only 6869:- for a limited time.*  
Since early March, there has been decreasing fluctuation between peaks and valleys.  Also, the amount of time between peaks and valleys has been decreasing.  This, combined with the obvious downward trend suggests an underlying psychological phenomenon on the part of the day traders:  They're increasingly competing with each other, and not market as a whole.  Each pump might be correlated with an external event, such as regulation changes, etc.  Once the pump gets going, the day traders dump increasingly more easily, willing to avoid coming too close to the next peak.  This is what's causing the increasingly rapid cycling between the peaks and valleys.  At this point, the only thing that will cause a meaningful bull run is a massive and sustained investment by whales.  The thing about whales is, they tend to be conservative investors.  So, this massive bull run won't start until the price gets to about 2K.  Sure, there could be a "teaser" bull run at 4k, pumping us to over 10k, but this won't last.  Not until big money gets infused at 2K will the current 2018 cycle be broken.
Massive sudden volume change.  USA?
