Key levels
Support: 8250, 8000, 7750
Resistance: 9090, 9350, 9500

Going above 9.5k and sustaining the level for more than a day or two would mean a significant trend reversal. 

Falling below 7750 would break the counter-trend rally since Tuesday, followed by possibly a re-test of the 5.9k low.
Guys, I can't chip away at this 8700 sell wall with just one green dildo. Come and give me a hand.
just put in another 400$
Can someone explain market manipulation in basic terms to a noob please. I'm assuming someone with a lot of bitcoins just puts massive buy orders to raise the price. This makes small timers believe there is a bull market who then buy in, raising the price more then the manipulator just sells?

Also, I've heard of exchanges wash trading...does this just mean they fulfil their own sell orders with buy orders which creates artificial volume, or is there more to it?
Genuine Q: When BTC goes down, most coins have pretty much the exact same trend/graph look. BCash doesn't seem to follow that pattern anymore (or at least the last few days). Why?
Boring, I'm going biking.
Alright so is there some meme I don't know about where everybody says loose instead of lose or is everybody ridiculously illiterate.  
Who the hell is selling right now? Fucking idiots
clearly market manipulation going on right now
no reason for a 700$ drop
Damn feels good to see green again.
these sell wall since 2 hours are scary. might be a bad night :-/ 
ouch that wasn't fun to watch
...and here we go.
So it looks like whales that build walls found a work-around to my whale-watching app. Sucks for them though because I found a work-around to their work-around, so now even if the whales stack different orders of the same volume AND same price, I can still see that it's just one person behind a particular buy / sell wall.

Anyone else listening to Free Fallin' by
Tom Petty?
Guys, never moon, the exchanges just make money by shorting, every time. They used bots for this, more than one month. GDAX, Binnance.....
Fuck, I knew it was too good to be true. Bull Trap :'(. 
Guys...rest up good tonight. The battle for $10k resumes tomorrow and we all need strength. We may not have won the battle today but the war is is far from over. Have a good night sleep and we'll tool up with big green dildos tomorrow and batter those sell walls down. Happy Lambo dreams.
I'm currently reading up on bitcoin. A hardware wallet seems to be the way to go. But what happens when for some reason the company behind the hardware wallet vanishes and i need a new one? There isn't a way to access the bitcoins in this scenario, or am I overlooking something?

edit: Thank you for your answers. I got it totally wrong. A hardware wallet is just a fancy way of not having to enter the private key.
I created a segwit address from electrum, but I thought addresses normally begin with 1 for non-segwit, and 3 for segwit.  This address looks strange to me..

bc1qgfksx2teet8vqjhcsqtt8zgt3x0aps4k5t9gnr

Is this right?
Y'all better hope those buy walls at the uptrend stay stronk or it's discount time again
Sold off into the European close (11:30am EST), then sold off again into US close (4pm)

Obviously stock markets aren't open today, but the timing is rather curious.
Low volume. . . I assume that there are a lot of buyers sitting on the sidelines right now taking a wait and see approach. Pure speculation
been a rough week

U that say we will dip to 5k etc, what do u base this on? There is no new FUD causing ppl to sell?
There goes 8k
It's always like this, the low volume sell downs are more dangerous.
bull trap...man
Holy shit the battle is intense!
If we get through this sunday and stay above 8k, it's bull time!
When we sat at 19K these bitches said “yep I’m waiting for the price to drop to buy in” 8K BTC is dirt cheap. I wish you all knew what I know. Save this comment seriously I will eat a donkeys cock if BTC isn’t worth 1 million dollars in 1000 years
People need to understand that this is a bear market - this is going to keep happening. Be patient, hold what you have, and wait for the mood to change. 
What gives Crypto value besides its market 
moment of truth, tonight it will hit around 9k. We will pierce the 9.2k than we are "safe". If we do not we will see these big red dildos again. 
Do not panic right now . Asians are cashing out the profit . Will go up in 4 hours 😀
WTF https://i.imgur.com/6SztC7k.png
this wasnt a bull trap. actually todays a bear trap
why would people sell so much at 8k. good news recent days, no fud.
mb it gets better after the future ends at feb,14th
Come on folks, lets get past $9k today.  
is this going to moon or to dip to 7.5k tommorow morning 
Buying $30 rn a good idea?
FIGHT!!!!!
hello,everyone hope all well?
Are there a lot of Asians using GDAX?
Sell yourself out to the bottom bro.
Hello all, wasnt on today, just check now, wow, it seems that i'll wait to buy today with all this red, good end of week end to all, was fun to see the good fights of yesterday at 8700 anyway.
Well with that I go by the basic philosophy of not getting into a pissing match with a skunk. Have a wonderful night.
Have a wonderful night. I’ll just avoid getting into a pissing match with a skunk. 
:o
Can anyone give a definitive reason why btc is dropping again.   It's making such an impact on alts. 
Hey guys, new to Bitcoin. 

I am using a sports betting app (Bovada), that allows you to withdraw your money in bitcoin and asks for a bitcoin wallet. 

I have no knowledge in bitcoin so was curious what wallet you guys would recommend me to sign up with. 

Realistically I hope to withdraw my earnings into my bitcoin wallet and then cash out my bitcoin to real money. Is that possible? 

I am willing to maybe let my money stay in bitcoin and then withdraw when bitcoins stock rises. But most likely will try and cash out right away. 

My only other option is to get a cheque mailed to me. But that is a 15 day process and I'd rather do instant withdrawals. 

Just looking for any advice I can get, cheers! 
/r/CryptoCurrency is basically a scam sub with 500k subscribers. Why doesn't reddit ban them? 
Yeah Coinsquare seems like a good place to start. Thanks a lot for your help, I really appreciate it! 
its 8k trap from whales
Those people who bought on the way up to 9k
Smile. Never moon, they just make money by shorting. Look at patterns for main coins, almost same.
 Guys, noob here.. when u buy Bitcoin from coinbase using your bank account ( 2-3 days to transfer) do you get locked on the current Bitcoin price? or u get the BC price 2-3 days later? Trying to save on fees

Thanks
Do people ever think bitcoin wasn’t meant to be a mainstream currency - it’s something I’ve been thinking about lately . 

When you look at the background and the libertarian political views of many of the people ,who would be considered cypherpunks , involved in helping Satoshi write the bitcoin protocol is there an argument to be made that it was supposed to be a currency for those who wished to opt out of society and its current systems?

I suppose I’m essentially viewing it as a payment mechanism for those who wished to live outside the bounds of conventional society structures.
seems like the bots are hard at work these past few weeks
Bitcoin always falls when people get most excited 
lol I figured this shit would crash overnight. It just had a really tough time breaking 9k
Can’t. Sleep. Must. Sell. Before I wake up to 5.............
Gonna copy a comment I made yesterday.

Two reasons why I think we are in a bear market:

(a) We've just seen probably the biggest bubble in crypto history (that being the explosion in BTC's price over Dec) burst, and a lot of new people who got into crypto over the hype have been burned bad. Whereas before the general mood towards crypto was very positive, now people are licking their wounds and behaving more cautiously. This means, on aggregate, that investors are (i) less likely to invest when they see positive news / movements in the price, and (ii) more likely to sell when things start to dip. Everyone is on edge, and for many these small upswings in price are simply a way for them to recover some of the losses they have incurred. This is not a mood conducive to long term upwards growth (i.e. a bull market). You have to remember that so many new people have got into crypto on the basis that they might 'get rich quick'; they couldn't care less about the technology or its long term success, and are losing interest now that the hype is gone.

(b) There have been a number of recent problems with certain exchanges that are shaking peoples' faith in the security of their investments. BitGrail has just turned out to be a massive scam, Binance has been having issues, and there was an exchange (can't remember the name) just the other day that was hacked. This adds to the general sense of fear (cf. optimism) that, I believe, the market is feeling.

I think the key point is that many of the new investors who entered the crypto market in Dec, who were largely responsible for the massive increase in BTC's price, have been badly burned by their experiences. Without that influx of new cash the prices of many of these coins are simply unsustainable, and it is going to take time for the market to bottom out.
Here we come 10.5k!!

Anyone else get a PM about a crypto pumping group starting to pump tomorrow at 10am?
Seems like we are in for another dip
lol stuck at 8030
Let battle for $10000 commence today. Arm yourselves with the biggest, longest green dildos you can. We will fight through the sell walls, kill the bears and victory will be ours. The reward will be Lambos and pizza for everyone. Regulators.....mount up.
The 24h volume ist just way too low for a run to 9k or 10k.
TO THE MOON 
FOMO IS VERY STRONG 
Vegeta is sad 
Keep on dropping! Trying to get back in 
Gotta give credit where credit is due. The trolls and FUDsters crawl out of their caves minutes after the price goes down. 
[deleted]
Got em
Is this 24000 BTC 24hrs volume normal ? just saw 100k few days ago 
Quick questions to smarties out there CBOE Futures to expire on the 14th of Feb? What's your uptake on this? Will we see a sell of like last time?
For me the most exiting feature this year will be direct swaps. Not sure if they will work also with fiat or only between cryptos.
Whow a lot of people who are experts on bitcoin with expert experience in this forum. Tell me how to get the knowledge of the blockchain technology? I'm lost 
why the sell off?
Okey, so who got the crystal ball? How low are we going? 
Guys, is there a way to send my BTC from Coinbase to GDAX. I know I can do that with USD, but can I send BTC as well?
Are there a lot of Asians using GDAX? 
Are there a lot of people in Asia that use GDAX? 
Can Grover's algorithm be used to speed up bitcoin mining? has it?
What role might hardware wallets play in the lightning network if any?

For everyone saying it’s dropping to 5k, chill. Look at the [Chart](https://imgur.com/a/Qf5F9?desktop=1) 
After the heroic fight at 8700 the same at 8000 in other way -_-
hello all. first time poster here. i have a hash 160 of a btc address that is the same as an eth address. can anyone explain?
Called it was a trap on Friday and this will be the last drop on Monday before we go up, selling Sundays six weeks in a row now.
[deleted]
Wew! back below 8k!
So the total Market Cap has $391 Billion dollars in it right now. This is less than half of what it was about a month ago at $856 Billion. If and when all that money comes back in and surpasses it. You will then have your Lambo’s and Moons. Learn a little about the Coin Market Cap. Just a little info...
Usa will wake up soon, need your support.
Edit : sad day..
:o !

Oh my goodness, I’m currently all out, but I woke this morning with a severe case of FOMO.

I get the buy and HODL mantra, but I keep thinking I should wait for a little more retreat - eg, like sever hours ago when it touched 7800-7900.

And with Chinese New Year quickly approaching, any thoughts if this might impact the markets?  Up or down?

Personally I think TA is really a lot like astrology or phrenology, but I do think systemic sentiment is a real thing... (rising tide lifts all boats)...
See what?
If you are hoping that the bitcoin to correct further to $7k , $6k or even $5k so that you can buy it , i am afraid to say that you may have to wait till the next crash maybe in Jan’2019 , by then , probably the banks and Warren Buffet will join you . 
As for now , Bitcoin is set to climb back steadily to $12k , dip a little , then to $15k , dip a little again , then to $18k , and dip a little again , then it will rocket all the way to $28k . 
Wait no longer , now its the time .﻿
When is the next "Bull run" supposed to start?
[deleted]
What is with all this selling
Flash sale. get it while its hot
guys i one to buy btc , better to wait 24h ? will see 7k?
What are your guys thoughts on the effects of new upcoming and future exchanges that will allow for direct fiat to altcoin pairings do you guys think this will have a negative or positive affect on bitcoins price if people are no longer using btc as a gateway to buy altcoins?
Are there any fees from coinbase USD to your bank account? Noob here
I miss having my total coinbase account up higher than it is now before the big drop. lol
$800 dollar drop ugh
I like how btc is going to test support now so we rocket Monday morning.
Does anyone know anything about Elliot wave patterns? 

I am really new to Bitcoin. I just started learning about the tech and Bitcoin in December during the boom. I started to buy sub 12k. My really amateurish understanding of predictive trading tools leads me to believe that this may be the 5th wave of the Elliot wave, which would extend down probably below the last bottom near 5k before a violent bounce probably back to 10k.

Does anyone have any insights or thoughts?
Doesn't anyone ever pay attention to the Sunday dip? It's all ready Sunday in many countries where they have strict religious practices and also most Banks are closed
Low 7K coming. Idk how low it can go but I definitely see it going to 50K+ towards the end of 2018
Resistance at 8k is strong, but I really think it's going to fall below it tonight
Don't have weak hands guys. I don't think we'll go super low tonight.
Anybody hear that fud noise ?

This is a Huge Buy Buy Buy moment !!! Buy everything you can for cheap 😀. The resistance level of 8800 was crossed yesterday which shows next rest level at 10,500 . HODL and buy buy more .short term weekend volatility doesn't matter .STAY STRONG , BUY MORE 😀
We either break 9k tonight or it's a long way down. Not fudding, just my belief based on personal analysis. We moon long-term but the next few days look shaky to me. Double bottom incoming.
[deleted]
Did I just get an alert telling me Zap! has released a beta lightning wallet>>>
📉 $BTC prices fall!
₿1 = $8177.01 (03:10 UTC)
#Bitcoin $btcusd #btcusd #btc 
hide your kids hide your wife. bitcoin is going down to 5k and that's yo lyfe. 
[deleted]
Meh, i saw this coming...  they give us a day or couple of green gains, then tank us in the red for 8+ days... too obvious pattern.
Are we going back down to 6k?!? Maybe even lower? I hope not!
Bitcoin is gay tbh
Please drop around the 23rd
I feel like the Asians always take the profits imo, I always loose overnight...
exchanges start shorting as usual. Every day shorting about more than month. So bad
not just Sunday, several times a week-shorting
Friday and Saturday afternoon it goes up the Saturday night it goes down
Lots of order for when it dips to 8k
Don't mind me, I'm new at reading these charts (gdax).  But this means that there's good support at 8,000...right? 
how many btcs is considered a big wall? 

looks like there is a buy wall at 7999 of about 150 btc?  is this considered big? ie strong support to keep the price above 7999?
[deleted]
Was going to buy but I'll be kicking myself if it drops tomorrow
[deleted]
drunken ....
BUY NOW BEFORE IT GOES BACK UP!!
People were yelling short squeeze for days. What happened?
