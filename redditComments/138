Daily Discussion, January 10, 2018
Why isn't this thread pinned to the top of r/bitcoin any more?
Just watched a gigantic sell wall of 90 BTC get eaten at 14150 on Gdax. Its about fucking time.
There seems to be confusion about how lightning works, so maybe this will clear it up:

You will have two wallets.  One which is "lightning enabled", and one which isn't.

Your non-lightning wallet will be your cold storage, and your "lightning enabled" wallet will be your hotwallet.

People talk a lot about opening and closing channels.  That is a technical description.  Imagine instead that you are just transferring funds between your hot and cold wallets.

Bitcoin made it so that you could be your own bank, and have your own digital cash.

Lightning made it so that you can be your own visa, and have your own merchant network.
The amount of fud surrounding bitcoin has been super high recently, so I'm expecting a huge pump soon.
Uh oh, time to unstick the daily! üòÇ

The resistance is strong
pretty sure it's rising because one of you sold
For all the people saying it is costly to open/close a Lightning channel, wouldn't you be able to open one with a minimal fee at the sacrifice of just waiting 1-2 days for it to get confirmed? Some people like myself wouldn't care to wait longer.
Like christmas all over again. 
If bitcoin makes it through this year, it will be the undisputed king for years to come . Let‚Äôs make it happen
what's the latest on Schnorr signatures the the developers actually making their wallet Segwit capable?
I‚Äôve got a positive story about coinbase (for once), sent some euros via SEPA deposit, received within 6 hours!
Did anyone saw the 50btc purchase
Christmas is back folks!
Just like that more than 50b of cryptos market cap hot wiped
my portfolio is bleeding at an average of $20 per second. Haha, not worried at all.
Now, only if the price stays this low until payday :)

Look at this guys. Looks like ban might not be in play and might be a fake news from Reuters.

Look at his other tweets as well.
Made a transfer from Gdax. Got paperwork from my bank which was expected. Most of it is clear, and some of it is the usual KYC.

But one of the things they want is a copy of the "bank transfer order showing the sender, receiver and payment involved". What would be the closest equivalent to this on gdax/coinbase?
Today has been a dark day for Crypto, a moment silence for our bagholder brethren ...
What would a stock market crash (*see 2008*) mean for crypto? Would we see a huge influx or a sharp decline in the whole market?
Gonna be a butt clencher 
Hi folks. An update on the Korean news:

http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&oid=052&aid=0001104792&sid1=001

Which according to another kind Redditor's (named starsinsky) translation is (sorry - I don't know how to link straight through to this hence I am copying and pasting):

"Cheong Wa Dae said the Justice Minister Park Sang-ki's remarks that the virtual currency exchange will be closed is not coordinated by the government.

A Cheong Wa Dae official said in a telephone conversation with YTN that Park's remarks are the position of the Ministry of Justice and that other ministries have various positions.

In addition, the Ministry of Justice approached from the dimension of elimination of speculation, but the Financial Services Commission explained that the Ministry of Science, Technology and Information Ministry is interested in nurturing core technologies of virtual money to prevent similar reception.

He added that virtual currency-related policies will determine the best time for policies to be effective while looking at market conditions."

Edit: a couple of the more amusing comments on the post:
"The Attorney General must be dismissed. Doing market intervention this way"
"The justice department is really crazy"
Have you guys seen this? This will generate heaps of confusion

It's falling up!
Alt coins not performing that great anymore so people going back to BTC
If someone gave you a partial bitcoin years go and it‚Äôs just the keys on a paper how do you ‚Äúdigitize‚Äù them?

Is it possible to do so and retain complete privacy ? As if someone gave you cash?

Thanks

This is fucking bullshit
WEEEEEEEEEE HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA WEEEEEE THERE GOES MY FUCKING 5 DIGIT profit HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
I‚Äôm not sleeping tonight lol can‚Äôt wait to see this sale. 
WOWWWWWWW


If this is real and they gonna stop exchanges then they gonna be like China 2.0. Bitcoin is global not limited to south Korea or China so it will bounce back soon it's the most resilient coin.IMO if the government bans then OTC trading will get popular in South Korea like China.
did anyone manage to buy the dip? Stayed up a few more minutes once I saw the price beginning to recover, and here we are again back at square one...
Hodl brothers - do not be infected by FUD. 
i just checked out the lightning network github and i got to say im impressed with the amount of work going on.
Really seems ever since futures started the price has been purposefully clamped.
HOLD THE LINE BOYS!
Korea ban is FAKE NEWS! Korea is NOT banning crypto, they are just regulating exchanges. CNBC is FUD news...again...
Go for a walk, maybe hit the gym, get a coffee, call your grandma, rub one out - just get out of this thread. (and HODL) 
HODL on matess!

Bitcoin CBOE futures were introduced 1 month ago today, maybe the dip the last days was part of a shorting effort?
how easy it is to setup a way to get paid in lightning ? Do I have to run a node at the same time?
is LN in production?
Cmon why not - New ATH?
What the fuck
Guys what just happened? Is this related to FUD news about South Korean exchanges getting raided? Or just a normal shit storm. When this correction will be over duhh
The stairstep sell orders at 15,000 on GDAX are interesting
Here we go baby!!!
If you don't have an option to cash out and you notice most alt coins are going down, which coin is safe to transfer in other than bitcoin? 
The volatility is wild, 30 minutes ago they were a little low but stable and then I just check again and all the cryptos I keep up with are double digit negatives

Does bitcoin need to go below a certain amount in order for it to gain traction again?
what are your thoughts on this news guys? Does it make any difference to the price of bitcoin?
Can anyone tell me why my Coinbase alerts didn‚Äôt fire?

I freely admit that I‚Äôm a newcomer to these parts. Also freaking out a little bit right now, just like the rest of you. 

But my real question is, why the heck is the Coinbase app not honoring the alerts I set up? I had multiple alerts that should‚Äôve fired all the way down into this shithole we're currently heading headfirst into. 

I figured it was useless to try to send an email to Coinbase customer service. Not worth their time or mine. So..... anyone got any clues/fixes?
This whole thing is a sad commentary on education and comprehension. 

https://twitter.com/cryptomanran/status/951317996684873728
Missed the dip .
7 blocks in the last 10 minutes. You are only supposed to get 1. Not that im complaining :)
Is it normal for bitcoin to go down so much in price? Should I sell?
The fun of such an infantile market.  Too many new people still panic selling at the same freaking news recycled. This is exactly what Korea has been working on AND TELLING PEOPLE ABOUT for a month lol. 
Since Buffett is a hot topic, might as well post it:

Black wednesday? Every coin for sale!

Hopefully today is the day we see some rebound. If not then its another day of discount coins and Hodlin'
what website can i track the percentage of all segwit transactions? 

what percentage do we need to get this to so we can start feeling better about transaction fees?
Not panic or FUD today, it's just exhaustion/depression. Ride it out.
Would you sell a certain amount of you BTC to buy altcoins with it e.g. NEO, VeChain, ETH or Cardano?
I want to transfer my BTC from gdax to a desktop wallet that's segwit compatible. I'd use electrum, but I want a wallet where I can transfer my BTC back to gdax so I think I need a wallet that supports P2SH. I don't want to use bech32 because then I won't be able to transfer my BTC back to gdax until they upgrade to segwit.

What should I use?
What's everyone perspective on Gemini? Is it a good exchange? 
What exchanges deposit bitcoin the fastest ‚ÄúUSD‚Äù?  I want to buy bitcoin from coinbase but coinbase takes 10 days to deposit. Thanks 
Where did these buys come from?!!!
Seems like all cryptos are going down again. Hmmmmm
300btc wall about to go down

Edit: ooops
We need to call PETA, these past few weeks bitcoin had a lot of dead cats
The charts looks hilarious and sad at the same time
Looks like it‚Äôs going back up. Despite whether you truly believe in cryptocurrency or not, this is another reminder of how deep dips can go and to not invest in more than you can afford to lose. Damn, that was scary..
angles and dangles
*vomits*
Could competing currencies void the benefits of a finite supply of BTC?

Does anyone have any confirmed updates on the Korea story? Europe is waking up and it would be good to post some FACTS here. I've seen Tweets that the MSM reports are over-stated. Does anyone have more information?
Anyone knows if South Korean traders can still trade on foreign exchanges after their exchanges shut down?
I cant wait for this spam attack to be over and fees to go back to normal. But its most likely someone with deep pockets who intend to keep it going for months.
Been missing the daily stickies. It was like a conversation in here.
Done with Coinbase, can anyone recommend a good UK exchange for Bitcoin?
Holy crap, TONS of weekly and quarterly long futures just liquidated. 
Come on cheap coins!!!!!!!!!!!!! I bought more Litecoin baby #richgang #MOE

dont worry guys, next time that price is around 16k I will sell, that guarantee price skyrocket  :(
There‚Äôs too many sellers but no buyers lining up. What a rough way to start the year I‚Äôll just stop watching and wait for next year
Cmon bitcoinüöÄ they can try but they'll never stop us going to the moon.
We're about to plunge again aren't we? God forbid we just have a nice upward trend channel.
if btc/eth drops some more i might finally be able to afford a whole btc <3
dat 14.6k wall :-O

Tear down that wall
This is the benefit of not being overinvested: I start out by thinking ‚Äúshit, not again.‚Äù  And then I end up fucking gleeful the worse it gets because I‚Äôve figured out ways to free up cash to buy more. 
These flash crashes don't last long boys! 
Hold tight boys, we still have another 10% to go!!!
Its going back up! $13.5k!
Buy the dip üòä
Be careful today. When noobs panic and sell it causes a dip. When long-term investors start to think that it's not worth the stress anymore (which is starting to happen, although it's not guaranteed to continue), the result is often much steeper and deeper. 

If you haven't felt the breed of anxiety before, it's difficult to understand.  It's very unpleasant.
I don't know about you guys but do you find this whole cryptostuff discouraging now that Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger said its basically dumb for people to invest money on this. This is really messing me up, like idk what to do.

Urm.. time to buy more BTC or wait a few days? Anyone with some technical analysis insight?
Guys, I think this is the beginning of the end.  As with most bubbles, it starts with a consistent decline (30% down since Dec) and then, .... the big plunge.  

I'm bailing out while I still made some profit.
What is actually driving the price down? I know South Korea got unexpectedly removed from some exchange calculations and the China is slowing move out of Bitcoin mining. I'm not worried to much about it right now as I can just sit back and wait, but I am trying to learn what drives the price up and down?
can someone explain further the node debate in terms of scaling? i know one of the criticisms of bcash is that it will lead to a centralization of nodes since regular people wont be able to keep up. can someone explain that a little further? also how is this currently effecting ethereum?
I've used coinbase to buy since I got started. I'm still a bit of a beginner, but their ease of use and ability to buy on my phone makes it really noon friendly. Are there alternatives that give a similar experience?

Also I do not have a wallet, my coins are on their exchange. Any beginner friendly tips would be appreciated 
I finally received my USD withdrawal from coinbase last night. It was pending since Dec 18th.    A part of me was hoping for the withdrawl to get  reversed so that I could add a few coins to my position.

Edit- It was a wire transfer and I paid $25 for that shit.

Guys, I need to cash in forked coins, don't want to wait for Ledger support. Heck, I don't even want them to work on them at all, development time should go elsewhere.

After moving my coins to a new seeded wallet, how do I export the private keys from my Ledger BIP 39 words? Ledger itself does not have a private key export option but is there a paper wallet website compatible with Ledger's HD implementation that would let me claim the private keys for my **segwit** addresses?

This is the only place I really trust that people know what they are talking about for bitcoin so I'll ask and looking for some real advice. Can anyone provide some real information on cloud mining with HashFlare? I've watched some videos and I think overall it is the best route for me to go about mining right now. Looking to purchase 10-20 TH/s at a 1 year contract. Profitability looks good and break even looks fine based on current/future price of BTC. I'm interested in hearing arguments for/against cloud mining. Thank you!
How long does it take to transfer bitcoin from localbitcoin to binance? Does anyone know how much the total fee is ? Thanks 
Good to see that we're in the green for the moment. 
This is hilarious - https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-price-analysis-choppy-market-224810042.html

Trying to apply technical analysis to BTC is retarded.
Does anyone know a good lawyer/accountant in London, uk, that deals with cryptos?
Are there any charting apps for crypto of comparable quality to Think or Swim by TDA? GDAX et all charts seem really basic.
Gargantuan sell orders on GDAX.  And the news of the futures liquidation is troubling. No es bueno for BTC.
I wonder what it feels like to cancel your huge ass sell order and then watch the market go crazy...

BTC is the KING never forget
Does anyone reckon BTC will fall further? Got a feeling the dip aint done yet and really want to increase my stack :O 
lol has anyone seen panhandle.io?
Your predictions on btc in next two weeks? I feel like 20k in the middle of the next week then a small dip then slow rise.

Just came back from gym, happy to see that it's 13,3k now. Was leaving when it was 12900k , Lucky those, who went to bed when it was 14k and missed this dump to 12.9k Hopefully will be fast recovery
Everything is going red, but does it mean I should panic and sell? NO, let's HODL. Cryptocurrencies are the future!!
MSM is way too slow to report on crypto, it's a hot topic so they always want something to print but the trouble is the market moves so fast that by the time they've gone to press things have already changed. Then their articles online stay live for weeks and almost always make things look worse than they already are. This 'crash' linked to S.Korea had almost recovered yet if you Google bitcoin all that comes up is doom and bloody gloom!
I'm done. I'm only up 100% in my crypto portfolio after dollar cost averaging since October 31st! Clearly crypto is dead. Get out while you still can!

For newcomers confused about **Bitcoin & CryptoTerminology** I put together a [blog post](https://www.blockchainshop.io/blogs/what-the-block/cryptocurrency-terms-and-lingo) and also [posted on r/cryptocurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7ph2hf/a_guide_to_cryptocurrency_terminology_quick/?ref=share&ref_source=link) to hopefully help some people out.

I need help withdrawing ETH from blockchain.info.  It's setting a VERY low fee (not changable) and then gives an error that there's not enough gas.  Changing fees for BTC is pretty clear on blockchain.info but I can't figure out how to adjust gas price for ETH.  

Any advice on how to get my ETH out, please?
Why is being Bcash going up so much today!??

That was awesome, GDAX was spinning like a mofo anyone record it?

I'm predicting a major drop in BTC in the next 3 days to the $10,000 range and maybe even $8,000.
I don‚Äôt know why but since I woke up this morning 8am GMT+1 I had the feeling that today is a turning point and that we will go up, maybe even reach a new ATH soon. Just feeling very positive with everything that‚Äôs going on atm despite the decline the last few days. 

Can‚Äôt really explain it rationally though. Maybe it was seeing a big Bitcoin logo on BBC business news at breakfast this morning connected to Kodak
