Daily Discussion, April 21, 2018
Some profit taken, sells triggered. Yawn. No biggie. Dunno why some people are losing their shit. 
What do people expect? 500$ every day? Ofc people Close out their positions at the weekend. Lets stay above 8.5k and we will be fine for tje next week. 
Short term moving average is currently higher than long term moving average on all timescale charts on gdax.  Very bullish for bitcoin!!!
**Support The Bulls.**
**Come On Bulls!**
My gf thinks that price is heading for 9.2.

She will give further updates when she's finished washing up.

But it is looking bullish from under my duvet.
9.2k this weekend
You guys think this is just a little pull back with some people taking the profits? 
Should be an interesting day today. Even if it ends up trending down again, I think the market will be a lot more optimistic after yesterday which is a sign of good things to come
Following discussions with my nurse, I'm now all in for TittyCoin.

See ya suckers!!

er 
So the sensible money is returning to the fold.


The trend is still strong. Bitcoin will reach $ 10,000. Analysis shows that the strongest resistance is $ 10000
There's quite a bit of volume right now (Bitfinex). Which leads me to believe, whenever one party runs out of steam (bulls or bears) the resulting jump in price will be *big*.

I just can't tell which direction it will go...
Oh baby the resistance is about to wane
IT'S ALMOST NEIN THOUSAND!!!!
Volume has died off once more. Danger danger
in other news we're 3% ahead of what McAfee predicted ... lambo order pending

Honest question:

I've been following BTC and the cryptocurrency graphs, markets and news more closely for a couple of months now \- always trying to decide if/when I should buy \- and I'd like to ask a question that I know will probably be unpopular here, but absolutely legitimate.

It is said that BTC will go up a lot more in value as it becomes more widely accepted \(and traditional currencies inflate\) because it is limited in supply. McAfee literally bet his dick that each millionaire in the world would want at least one. I'd even go farther and say that a single BTC would eventually be worth more \(maybe way more\) than a million dollars each if it was the only cryptocurrency. However, looking at the almost two thousand new cryptocurrencies \- a couple quite successful among them \- I ask myself why would people rather not just use another \(maybe a similar, a clone or a different, maybe even "better" one \- though "better" is relative\) cryptocurrency instead of subjecting themselves to this much speculation with BTC's value?

So far it seems to me that BTC is \(at least since I started following it \- and, just to be clear, I'm talking about the cryptocurrency, not about this subreddit\) much more about speculation \(HODL\) than actual usage as payment \- personally, I'd never spend something that can double, quadruple or even x10\+ in value at any moment.

What I'm trying to ask is:

If the goal is to have one \(or more \- look at USD and EUR\) universally accepted decentralized \(anonymous?\) currency/payment system, what makes Bitcoin \(and no other cryptocurrency\) so special? Why would all the millionaires need/want BTC specifically \(which is what needs to happen in order for it to go so high\) instead of any other cryptocurrency who does the same \(or an even better\) job?

Good to see: in my watchlist now, 24h period:

BTC remains green, all other alts I watch red.

That was a strange day in the sun for alts.

Good for Bitcoin :)
Buy Bitcoin
what percent of the world's population owns ANY bitcoin?


get ready


How do you think bitcoin will look next week? I am waiting for some funds to hit an account. 
sneaking up on the breakout... psssst... *^don't ^scare ^it ^away*
I have spent about 25k on btc over the past 4-5 months and my current holdings is valued at 16-17k, let's say I sold my entire holdings, is that enough to make a significant impact on the price?

I have no plans to sell btw, just wondering how much of an impact my holdings would create
The market is really undecided now, on how to proceed...

Shorts are going down. I guess shorters are not so sure themselves anymore, that this will crash. Not sure if this is a good sign. I always liked to bet against the shorters...
We are about to slingshot around the earth.
Sunday dip coming?
What's your favourite:

8.9k or simply 9k?

I'm growing to rather like 8.9.  And you get more digits.

Any thoughts?
Roger Ver pumping Bcash. Sad.
I miss you Vegeta :(
**Europe & others, we need to hold this level atleast until the Americans wake up, many thanks.**
Good for Bitcoin.
Hopefully a lot of the other coin profits are now put into Bitcoin.....

BTCP is flying
6 hour chart :)
Damn experts and their TAs...   True talk, is Bitcoin going up  or will there be a correction coming?
Is it just me or has gate.io stopped withdrawals? Can someone tell me why it has happened? I just created the account to sell some ERC tokens I got from referrals...
Hello . do you see a bug on kraken?
broke down for an hour at home in France

Hey guys, I recently got into bitcoin via Coinbase and I have .5 BTC but planning on buying more. I want to move my bitcoin into a wallet. What are your suggestions ? 
Well guess thats the end of my time with coinbase, been using them since 2011.

Where should I move it to next?

Was thinking about doing a USB wallet somehow. Whats the modern way people are doing it?


Someone talk to me about 6-hour charts. Are we going to see some wild trading around 5pm est (4 central) today?
onward 
Not mad
4k by tomorrow. WHERE ARE YOU NOW
Would be good to see another proper charge in the next few days, getting to over $10k. 
everything is fine, we still up
Wow. One of you actually messaged me telling me to kill myself. Good job. No, really. We're all very proud of you.
Hopefully the Americans will get things back on track slowly, I would be happy if we finished the day around $8800-$8900.  It seems the Americans are doing all the hard work at the moment, the Rest Of The World needs to help!  :) 
most ridiculous price action 
People who wake up and sell right away are going to have a bad time. 
I think traders are now having a positive thoughts with this bull run of bitcoin but I hope it breaks the wall of 9k. Right now this improvement of bitcoin able some traders to recover from the previous crash
Come on,  11k by the end of next week keep buying
Reverse Head & Shoulders pattern finished soon. 

Now that the dandruff is gone, prepare for the next rise...
Where you at u/hodltill2020? Did you ever take that opportunity to get out at 10am MST? Or is preparation H on the shopping list?
She is getting horny again, lads. 
guys it has to come down a little more, don't think this is the bottom. Truth.
Huge sell-off coming. Was this the end of the bull run already?
LOWER
Glad i didnt fomo and buy into anything.  I saw this coming, same shit diff weekend.  Very predictable now.

We further our mission research and educational organization that develops medical, legal, and cultural contexts for people to benefit from the careful uses of medicines with bitcoin. At the moment, this is achievable. Before doing this research, we analyzed many sources and recipes that will help achieve this goal. But this is not enough. We are going to expand this research on the world level and make it legitimate to use alkaloids in medicine - according to our information this will speed up the process of recovery and open new heights in the field of science and medicine. As soon as we receive the necessary data, they will be investigated and sent to science in order to achieve the goal. Now we need the help of the community that supports it. This method of research will be more effective than the medicine used now. For us it will be a breakthrough in the field of science because now it really is necessary.
Why did you all have to jynx it with vegeta. Correction here we come. Alts just copped a brick to the face

Can someone please explain why we hate coinbase now? 
Everyone needs to GTFO coinbase right now.

If the US decides to ban BTC, coinbase will freeze everything.


Yay! It's going down!
you are all about to get barted. eat my shorts. just opened.
Good evening weekend traders, beginning another live analysis of Bitcoin price action and perhaps some trading! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T0wnpEafuE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T0wnpEafuE)

who think that this year bitcoin will try to raise, but return to lower remembering the previous years when after doubling the price fell to about 170usd?
Have you weighed it back to its historical minima? 600 usd 800?
