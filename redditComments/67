**US Congress Praises Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Technology**

The US Congress just released its massive joint report on the state of the economy, and for the first time an entire chapter is dedicated to cryptocurrency. What’s even more extraordinary are the number of bullish sentiments on the future of the emerging technology like:

-Blockchain Looks Like the New Internet

-Cryptocurrencies Could Outshine Government Fiat

-Blockchain Is Secure and Efficient

-Blockchain May Transform Many Industries

Bitcoin Reddit... the place where people come to lose their mind

May the crypto gods look down in favour today boys! Can I get an amen!
Starting to have retinal persistence shaped like candlesticks. Time to hit the bed.
Used BTC to buy something irl for the first time. If anyone is in Bangkok, I definitely recommend going to Bad Burger. They might hold the bitcoins too actually; they weren't using any service that auto converted to fiat, instead converted the THB amount to BTC then got me to send that to their wallet directly. The process needs to be a bit more efficient, but I'm glad to support the system and any merchants who come on board. I think adoption and daily use is the key for long term success.
I love how quickly people change their opinion. Their opinions change as red becomes green. 
i love watching this .001 buybot on gdax
Such a FUD factory in here.

Anyone who was going to sell has already sold. 

What do some of you think happens when a bitcoin is sold? It just ceases to exist temporarily until it's happy time again? Someone else buys it. 

There is nothing left to shake out of the tree and we just bounced off bottom at 7.2k.

Let me know when you guys think it is time to start buying... 8.5? 9.3? 11.5?
Good time to buy following the G20 news?
I just heard the news that Bitcoin bans Facebook for corruption and fraud.
Should I be skeptical of this pump right now?
come on guys, who sell at 7k and is buying at 8.6k?, dont be shy guys-

I have to say, actually buying a Lamborghini is definitely not a wise thing to do once BTC moons again. Urgh I don’t even want to see the monthly insurance premium on that thing. There’s a reason the Winklevoss twins still drive an old SUV 🤔 just be smart about it lol
That fucking $8600 wall man
Lets go West Coast America! 
load the Trump FUD
Asia is waking up...my body is ready.
I miss Fall 2017. 
Come back normie money.  Come back please. Bitcoin needs you. 
Lets remember it's not all about price. 

BTC is here to stay and is going to change the financial world as we know it, adoption just takes time.

We have only just begun 
I think no one knows what's about to happen
I've got no idea what's going to happen today!
be very careful.
Hopefully $10k within the next few days.
the FOMO is real
Who made the most last year during the Bitcoin assent? Anyone? $500? $5,000? $500,000? I got started too late and have only lost...no gains to date!
Manipulation or organic growth
bitcoin the most secure network known to mankind,and todays best chance at uniting the world
After participating in these discussion threads for weeks now, I notice there's a lot of people who want December 2017 to keep happening, probably some of the newer folk like myself, but in all likelihood you're better off just changing your investment/trading strategy.
G-20s have a lot in their table, thanks to Trump, steel trade and US tariff, circumventing WTO rules, China trade tensions, ... etc etc,  some $320 Billion unorganized and unstructured crypto industry will not give them that much headache, May be some strong words on regulation. A bright week ahead for Crypto, What could go wrong?
this looks promising if you haven't seen it yet.  https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DYo3q4nWsAAgzFp.jpg:large
So I've got a question - how do wallet providers e.g. electrum, make money?  Does the wallet take a cut of the transaction fee when you make payments?  
Green across the board at 7:30ampst. Now WTF
Damn missed opportunity :(
Loving the pump action today.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-Vjgx75GXQ Tom Lee breaks down why BTC is here to stay and why the value is only going higher and higher into the future....
Its gonna be biiiiiggg pump guys! Fasten your seatbelts
A lot of resistance at the 8500 mark.
fuck you facebook, who is down now?
[Theme Song to get us to 9k](https://youtu.be/ZaI2IlHwmgQ?t=11s)

LET'S GO PUMPERS!
I wonder what Trump will say about bitcoin   
[deleted]
A break above 8600 on the 4 hr should lead to further upside.... just sayin'
Fuck you to whoever put a 20 Bitcoin sell order right under mine at 8600
I'm a dev and originally was going to build a site to help people buy and hodl bitcoin. But given there's already a lot of places (coinbase, gemini, bitstamp, etc) and the amount of insane regulatory requirements, I want to try something else.

Anyone have something you wish was built for Bitcoin? What's the most annoying, frustrating, or problematic thing for you personally, or what would be really cool if it existed and you would personally want to use?

Look forward to your replies/ideas!
9k is the new 12k, for now.
Hope all the negative assholes on here is still holding for 4k.....
Just went all in... hands off the steering wheel now
Come on, Bitcoin. Beyond $8500 there's a great feasting hall with 72 virgins and endless pleasures, I promise.

Also, beer.
The chart looks like a heart chart right now of a person who has a regular resting heart beat.
FOMO!!!!!!!!
Those here who bought in at 18k, will you hodl or did you sell?
Well, that was a nice hit of dopamine. How far down will we fall this time? I need another fix. 
Are we out of the woods yet? I feel like there's another massive dump right around the corner.
Shivers down my backbone! 
That one time that I got it right I have neither bought here nor sold there because I don't trust my own TA, lol.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/vKxNxVzE/
I’m perfectly comfortable watching the market and keeping out. Things looking real fishy rn, feels good to not buy relatively high, then bitting my nails given recent prices. FOMO, what’s that?
I know history is nothing to go by with crypto. But checking out historic prices on tradingview is showing some time in march/april each year theres a fall in price, so maybe there is some theory to people cashing out for their tax. This year, maybe the fall has already occurred (in case anyone didn't notice). 

However I can tell you this, if the price dives again at month end, I'm buying in, because in may/june of 2016 and 2017 the price started climbing. We all know how the moonshot went last year, maybe it'll do so again :)


Is there a ledger with the lightning network? Are transfers transparent and viewable on a blockchain? How do I pull up the tab or transaction receipts for my LN payments? Do I have to trust the LN nodes since transactions aren't settled on the blockchain until a channel is closed?
Given the non-stop debate about tethering Bitcoin I thought this was great.

https://lambodreams.com/2018/03/19/tethergang-vs-hodlgang-meet-cryptos-lame-ass-version-of-the-bloods-vs-crips/
I saw an article a few days ago about Bitcoin saying that it was reaching all-time lows over the past week.
Do we all agree we hit bottom last Sunday?  Ok, do we mostly agree?  Or do we have hold-outs that still think this is merely a very convincing pump?  For about 12-hours I was sure this was a pump... but now... wow
[deleted]
Stop spreading false news please. One lobbyist just told that he does not support cryptocurrency regulation. This does not mean that G20 will not pave the way to more regulation. Actually several countries (France, USA, Germany,...) will actually push for implementing tougher crypto regulation. So, again, please be more fact-driven and cut this propaganda because, after reading your title, people will get disappointed when they see the probable dip following the G20 announcements (that will unfortunately/likely generate more stringent regulations)...
Fight for the prize Bitcoin!
It can not be regulated unless you regulate the internet to access it..that's the whole point that is fking govenrments and banks both...so since the west is not China .. internet access wont be regulated and we can buy and sell BTC as we want....
Stay confident HODLers, we will be back at today's highs later today. The dumpers will turn into buyers when they realize their tricks aren't working anymore.
It'll make a jump in a few minutes.

200 sma, 100 sma and 50 sma on 1 minute chart are getting very close to each other. Maybe crossing.
[deleted]
Happy to say we touched the bottom 2 days ago, I don't see us going down any time soon tbh
Breaking out over 8600 now .... target 9800 ...

Lets go Asia! 

Buy more ! ..... Buy more now! Consumption has been standardized to increase enjoyment!  (THX1138)
This is the last time we see BTC under 10k. Buy. It will be NOMORE dips. Straight forward from this point. Buy. Or you will regret.
Does anyone know around what time (GMT) we'll start to hear word on the outcome of the G20 summit's discussions on Crypto?
How do you guys see the PoW vs PoS "competition" panning out? Isn't PoS just a much better way of doing things in the long run, especially in terms of resource consumption? Just trying to learn, thanks!
Over 12K and it's off to the races. Upward and onward to 20K, be patient guys
8600 - 8700 is a key resistance level, if it breaks we could be over 9000 by end of day
Both 200 SMA and 200 EMA are being tested. The next few hours are critical for the short term trend. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/4b5R2iEB/
This is different it's gonna shoot back up again to break 8700
Is the market really dropping because US decided citizens are not allowed to buy the petro $ scam coin? This is non-news and has nothing to do with the rest of the market. It's kind of pathetic the market is so fragile.
to dump or not to dump, that is the question
My technical analysis, using the Holts-Winters method, shows a 78% probability that the price will go up or down today. This builds on my analysis last week that said it will definitely be above zero for the near term.  /s
Any minute now... look at those bots trying to keep this hubris afloat
Facebook swan dives 7% today. The next generation say that is their parents website and don't use it. Backed by a network isn't worth much when the network can instantly jump ship like MySpace.
[deleted]
USA waking up - which way will they take us?
https://youtu.be/61Q6wWu5ziY
West coast checking in happily $)
Be careful everyone, the G20 is still considering regulation. This will only be temporary if that is the case.
https://www.forbes.com/sites/tedknutson/2018/03/19/cryptocurrency-doesnt-pose-a-risk-to-the-financial-system-yet-g20-told/
I saw a LOT of people crack this weekend. Something about that slow, methodical grind down finally broke some HODLers. Complete manipulation IMO. Seems the whales are testing the bottom. Too bad if you sodl.
Going to hodl my cash until we hit 6k
Was this pump just another trap?
God damn it. 
7k incoming. Hold on to your privates.
We did it boys. GG bitcoin wins.
I think this time around we might see a power bottom at some point but lets not forget the greatest man of our century. The glory moment of his past Al Bundy's life: scoring four touchdowns in a single game while playing for the Polk High School Panthers in the 1966 city championship game versus Andrew Johnson High School, including the game-winning touchdown in the final seconds against his old nemesis, "Spare Tire" Dixon
judging by the size of the buy and then the sell.  It looks like one whale who bought a lot then sold it back off.  don't despair bois!
If it drops, the question for me is "Where should I buy next?" 7.8k, 7.2k, maybe 6 or 5.5k even?
Planning on buying from 7k down to 5k then if it breaks 5k it's not going to be pretty. Won't have reserve left at that point. It was just 10 dollars a few years ago so kind of a scary thought. I'm a smart guy and just say.. 10 dollars to 19k what could go wrong? I fear if this is a correction our price will end up under 1k but I will start my fomo at 7k and gamble.
Here's what I am seeing on coinmarketcap.com:

Crypto prices all going up and down in almost 'identical' patterns. Percentages of the top 100+ market cap coins that mirror each other and go up and down almost in unison.

To me, this tells me there is BIG money, possibly by one or a few whales in a lot of these tokens/coins. Their bots or traders put money into all or most of these coins at once, creating an illusion of a bull market return. For all of these coins/tokens to go up on so many tokens, in unison, and then go back down in unison, is pretty obvious what's happening.

Yes, the market is driven on news and emotion, but look closer - these patterns of up and down prices on coinmarketcap.com and Coinbase are following each other too tightly to be just news driven. 

Plus, there are 'Pump and dump' groups pumping a lot of coins, then dumping for profit.

Buy on bad news, sell on good news...
Bitcoin needs some Red Bull today. 
This is a dream come true. Keep pumping so I can keep dumping! this is a bear market for months at least. 
The FOMO is real and going to hurt a lot of people when this market crashes back down to reality. When Asia wakes up it's going to be a bloodbath. Everyone who bought when the market was around 270 billion market cap is going to sell for a nice profit which will cause a chain reaction of stop loss orders kicking in. Free fall. Next stop in a few hours maybe even under 250 billion total marketcap for all coins. Load up on tether now, you heard it here first.
The latest news is not good. China is going to dump.
So a man took a shit?
When do you think it's safe to buy back in? Charts says it's going to drop to around 6k. Don't want to miss the ride up in the end.
What should be the selling limit in the current scenario? 9000?
Shall one place order?
Time to buy tether and wait for the trap!

I am so pissed about people who can't take worrying news without saying "FUD FUD FUD FUD FUD" That's such an immature and stupid attitude...

Saying that preemptively because I am fu***ng afraid that a price drop might occur today. Today is D-Day or judgement day for BTC and Alts. Source below:

Bitcoin price: Will G20 regulation kill cryptocurrencies? Traders warned of price drops

https://www.express.co.uk/finance/city/933991/Bitcoin-price-G20-2018-news-cryptocurrency-regulation

He said: “Carney’s comments come as a welcome antidote to some of the more alarmist statements on cryptocurrencies that have made headlines in recent weeks.

“Though we are broadly supportive of a potential regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, the reality is this is a misunderstood industry and is still in the very early stages of its development.

“We hope this common sense approach sets the tone for the rest of the G20 summit this week, to ensure we don’t scupper the potential of this huge wave of technological development.

G20 chiefs are expected to focus their attention on concerns of crypto money laundering and how to protect consumers’ best interests.”
Bitcoin’s stable for now, sure... but it can drop like a rock in seconds whenever it feels like it. Make sure you never blink and you’re constantly refreshing your charts so you know when it’s time to start *screaming*
green green green,green every where
Dump time 
N O S T R A D A M U S
American news will not affect the bitcoin price forever. the rest of the world won't give a shit. 
I just bought a lambo with all my profits. Thanks for the pump guys!
Looks like a green and better day to me.
Make us proud BTC, time to move up !
pamp of hope
The pumping and dumping is so damn aggressive today. 
Well that was fun while it lasted
Boss:Oshit guys the crypto market is flying up, what can we do to drop it?

Clown1: We could ban bitcoin?
Clown2: Lets say we'll think about regulating it again.
Clown3: Lets just let it grow? 

***boss kicks nr3 out of the window***

Boss: Nr2 you're promoted!
Right now very confusing to buy more or wait....
I guess only hindsight will tell...
It's a gabmle, I know, but think if you could take if it shot up to 100k and you AGAIN didn't buy? For me answer is no so I HODL. Remember invest amount you can lose, ideally invest something that you were going to spend on something useless...
can anyone provide good documents/ youtube videos on how to code automated strategies using the GDAX api? looking to learn more about this stuff! thanks alot!

"Lets go bitcoin!" -baby bro cardano
Already the price is going up after the first day of  G20
I guess btc will go up in May.
Transaction fees and speeds seem to be fixed with LN.

How about power consumption? Any development to reduce this?
*sigh* Sitting this one out I guess. It will come back down I bet later today here in Asia. 
Cliff ahead boys
Early to mid-April will tell the tale
A lot of whales are paying their taxes by raising capital from bitcoin sales. Check back after April and the price will be up again.

Look for 5k bottom before mid April. Will be a good time to buy
Please neckbeards, save me from the evil, stable, easy to use money we currently have.  I need more complication in my life!
Buying is taking place in anticipation of the G20 results.  With good news,  we'll easily break $10k again.  With bad news,  this will bottom out around $5k. Glta.
Price is going sideways then down
Damn I lost $30, but imma still ride this shit to the TOP. FOMO checking in 😅
Where can we watch the G20 Summit online?? Anyone know?
The little whale that could
Here's my outta-my-ass prediction: £7750 / $10.8k by end of moth. You heard it here first!
Ugh I don't know if I should buy or not :(

Is there some major FUD holding back BTC today in Asia? It hasn't gone anywhere today. I'm not expecting a return of yesterday, but anytime it tries to rise 30 BTC or more goes up on the order book on GDAX to resist it. 
Are we expecting another drop due to this? https://www.ccn.com/indias-bitcoin-trading-volume-plummets/
Trending towards 10k
More Doom and Gloom from me!

Today, there is a story about Cambridge Analytica, a company who essentially wrote a bot to mine information and then created an algorithm to determine a profile based on your personal information, and target information to you that would lead you down a rabbit hole of dis-information in an attempt to change your beliefs or narrative.

Why this is a big deal, is because Facebook, and Google, and the Advertising community do this on a daily basis from your browser history, and from your Facebook information. They charge for this, and this is what they sell on a day to day business.

So really, this scandal is really about 'Who is in Control". Facebook is being quiet because they do the exact same thing for their advertisers, and must maintain control, and the fact that a third party did it, means that it can't happen again. 

Now, how does this apply to BitCoin?

Governments around the globe must remain in control. They have to have control over currency, money, and banks. Bitcoin was an attempt to come up with a global unregulated, un-corruptible currency. Banks, and their Governments, don't want this. They want the ability to own everything, and control everything.

Note how one Bitcoiner went to jail, and not a single banker has gone to jail. Why? Control and power.

Google, and many banks and credit institutions, are waging a secret war on Bitcoin, because it's a threat to banks, and moreso a threat to governments. 

So, what do we expect to happen?

1. Something bad will happen, and somehow the American Media will say that Bitcoin payments funded it over the 10K limit, (a banking regulation) so they can link Bitcoin to Terrorism. 

2. Political leaders, pressured by the banks, will come out with heavy regulation on Crypto Currencies.

3. Laws will be created where only 'Recognized, permitted banks' will be allowed to trade, buy, and sell crypto, and all financial transactions must be handled by a regulated banking institution, like BOA, Chase, HSBC'.

4. A false crash will happen to scare everyone off. It will be designed to hurt the reputation of Crypto, and to get everyone to move their money out of it, so banks can frame it as a 'bad thing that supports terrorism'.


It will be very important that as people we band together and stop our political leaders from over regulation from the banks. It's going to be a dark time ahead for crypto indeed.
Sell now. I've been right the last two predictions. Downvote at your own peril. Nostradamus has spoken.
Anything under 19k is not a true bull.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLf9q36UsBk
We all know FOMO ends very badly. There will be a huge dump soon probably the total marketcap will hit around 250 billion for all coins. 
https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2018/03/19/bitcoin-is-unfolding-like-the-dotcom-crash--just-15-times-faster.html 

Is this BS article a sign to buy? Lol
Could be a bull trap before everyone cashes out for taxes next month. Build up the price, then dump.  Just my guess.
Bout' time for the juicy red candy pox fellas and bellas.
Another FUD by CNBC. 
one more bulltrap.... then DOWN
Where moon?? Will be back to 7K by EOW. 
[removed]
This is a huge trap. It's going to get bloody when it crashes. Will wipe out all the stop losses and cause a chain reaction.
[removed]
This is a huge Bull Trap. Sell for tether if the market hits 330 billion marketcap. It's getting close. The whales are going to crush it soon. Tomorrow we will see a total 250 billion marketcap. That's where I draw my line in the sand and all in.
