Someone is losing a battle to keep the price below $8,000
I get the feeling that *someone* doesn't want Bitcoin to go below a certain level.

The bears are certainly trying...

it's consolidating. If it looks anything like what happened on Thursday, there may be a slight decline and then boom to 8,500 or just a straight shot there if we are lucky. I think everyone is just waiting for the right signal--the day candle and RSI show a turnaround at least for the next couple of days so today and tomorrow is risk-free. Pray to the coin gods you all. 
Everybody FOMO!
i just came
So they said not to hodl hmm
Bull Run incoming.

I would like to take a moment and thank everyone who participated in this years "Bitcoin Spring Sale".

I hope you all got some cheap coins.

Prices are returning to normal now. This was your last chance to get 1btc for less than 8k. 

But of course our regular prices are still very cheap compared to the price you'll have to pay in a few months.
above 7.5k for the weekend and its fine for the next week
Volume too low to stay above 8k. Dammit
Sentiment is very positive in this thread. Almost euphoric. When euphoric sentiment is reached, it's time to sell. Then wait for r/bitcoin to get depressive, and buy back. Bulletproof get-rich scheme.
Buy or HODL? 
Any idea why the mempool spiked to 40MB after being at 1-3MB this week?
I think there's a big move on the cards once we take out $8230, there will be all kinds of stops above that which will likely trigger any automation looking for longs.

In a thin week-end market...
ever been curious about asic pcb internals (albeit a damaged one) ? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjU--8AUfD4
Is this a good time to get out of my basement?
aah, its so boring no thrill at all... its like having coffee in the middle of a desert that too alone
 
Anyone else notice that when Bitcoin's price drops, the number of subs on this sub drops and vice versa when the price rises?
Is it time for the weekend dip?
Could do with more buying volume but atleast it's over $8k. 
Discount is over soon. Grab them while they are hot.
[deleted]
Why are people celebrating a reversal when trade volume is just free falling back to where it was last week?
bulls are really trying, but will it be enough?
I think we're very close to a break out here, very close.

No immediate impact on price due to Syria attack. 
Buying on the low 
Rise and shine!
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPkR6FGY6zw) is one of the songs I listen to while daytrading.
strange buywalls
**Good morning, 11am UK Time**
Reeeeeee
up is my favorite direction
[deleted]
Sale is finished soon. Last chance to get cheap coins.
How high do you think Bitcoin will get before people start trading it heavy for alts and another alt season begins?
Looks like a lot of people are re-investing now with the tax business nearly over.
lol I went and made food for like 2 mins. lol what. 
Slow upward movements always make me nervous.

They might look "organic" at first glance, but are often followed by a strong and fast downward correction...
I see ascending/symmetric triangle and pennant formations on every timeframe up till the daily.

Almost certain we will test the 50D MA around $8500. After that probably a correction down, $5000 is a good possibility. 

So best to get in fiat/tether up when we go up another 500, $9k area is a big resistance cluster anyway, so you're not missing the boat.

Watch out boys, another bart simpson dump is coming!
Cheap coins everyone!
Can someone tell me why it matters how much 1BTC is worth? The tech and it’s original purpose as a currency will exist at any price, so what is the reasoning behind wanting its fiat value to keep rising other than getting rich? I just can’t imagine many new users coming in at $100,000 after adoption when there’s already a Bitcoin 1% who were really just lucky enough to get in early. 

Not a no-coiner, just curious 
Aaaannnnddd once again the volume is dropping as the price range narrows. We're in another triangle and will break out either up or down. 
The sellwall at $8090 is so big. We need more volume
What do you guys think of [this video?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4&v=pOZaLbUUZUs)

So I made a little video about: 
How You can Make More Bitcoin Passively Without Losing Real Dollar Value. 

https://youtu.be/yWmavVxluWA

Don't worry about price drops, simply apply the 5 steps there and keep your current USD value in Bitcoin.
