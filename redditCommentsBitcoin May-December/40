1k pumps, my favorite antidepressants!
Holy shit. Some shorters are going to have a bad morning. 
*blows dust off vegeta meme*
All these mooners appearing out of the woodwork lol
Bogdanov, he's in
I was all depressed when I checked my phone this morning and saw bitcoin tanked another 2 hundred.  But after staring at the price and my senses slowing coming to me I was like holy crap it‚Äôs not 6700 it‚Äôs 7700. 
Pamp it
All the shorters just got rekt.
I hearby proclaim today green dildo day
This has been the most exciting 12 hours YTD.
Everyone saying that it‚Äôs pure manipulation.. of course it is. Shorts at an ATH, low volume and thin liquidity, all whales have to do is suppress the price, accumulate, fake a dump to trap bears, and pump it to liquidate the crazy amount of shorts for a short squeeze of insane proportions.

Bears got greedy, and they got burnt.
Shorters' getting rekt.
What the fuck was that!?!?
is it bull trap ??
This is the best mood I've  seen this forum in for ages.. anyone for a beer?

Or 12
I‚Äôve been slapping myself daily (metaphorically) for buying in at 8.1 months ago.  But I held. Hold I shall ...
This dump is gonna hurt.
Im sorry its my third post in the last 5 mins but WHATTTT THEEEE ACTUALLLLLL FUUUUUUUCK?!
Hey guys, I sold my bitcoin which means it's guaranteed to keep going up. (Because I always buy and sell at the wrong time). HODL!!!!
Well, it's a first man in space day, April 12 1961))
just woke up suddenly to 7800. thought my vision was still fuzzy from just waking up. nope, it actually rose THAT high. what the fuck just happened??
To nobody in particular: You want a market without regulation, then quit griping about the manipulation.
If I extrapolate the 19% price growth from the last 24 hours, I calculate that the price of 1 btc by the end of April will be $156,070. 
Me this morning (literally):

- Woke up at 5:30am for work
- drove to work sleepy AF and was wondering why I even came to work in the first place
- Got to work, turned on the computer, open the necessary programs, and opened an internet window
- Went into coinmarketcap hoping to see BTC in the $6,900-$7,100 range still
- saw $7,700 range, reloaded the page to make sure it was showing the correct price, pinched myself to make sure I wasn't in a dream, and researched why the sudden pump
- well in conclusion the sleepiness went away in a quickness and I'm more energetic to work now :)

-The End
$7.900 holy christ!
8k üëç
West Coast US gonna wake up and not know what just hit them.
We're gonna need a bigger boat
I like pumps as much as anyone, but I'm going to remain skeptical until we know for sure this isn't market manipulation meant to [wipe out those going short](https://i.imgur.com/EEMR6mA.png). 
Oh does it feel good to get out of that 6k hell hole! 
pamp eet
That‚Äôs right you damn dirty bastard, rise all the way to Valhalla 
**Support The Bulls**
It is primed to go.   I'm convinced 8.2k shortly.

As a long time boring hodler, I'm buying in for a few BTC.
Has anyone else not been able to do anything productive besides watch the price in the last couple of hours?  Or just me. 
#ready the vegeta memes boys
8k memes! Get the fucking 8k memes ready - look alive people, wtf are we even doing here.
I wont celebrate till we are over 15k.  Until then....  business as usual.
Pumpy wumpy
Meanwhile, over on the naughty step:

* they are celebrating BTC's rise with hand-wringing speculation that our mempool will fill up due to, er, not being a shitcoin & having 14x the volume of Bcash.
* Btrash is doing rather well at a garage in N. Queensland.  Pop: 231,628
* Lightning network is shit apparently.

Just a regular day over at r/btc then.
Do you guys see this?
This is gonna be all over the news in the morning lol
We just jumped almost $1,000 in less than one hour. Feels like December baby.
7.7 K - this is a proper pump now....
The short squeeze is underway. 
Tax season suppression nearing end ?
It was the calm before the storm now we have volume and a rock solid reason to believe the bulls have returned
Gimme an I.... I believe... I believe that we will HODL
**COME ON USA!** 
btc. at 13 % uprising.. This is a bull run
Somebody somewhere is laughing his cock off lol, I bet they are in tears reading some of the comments, I wonder what colour Lambo they have ordered hehe
Dear god finally
Looks like 200,000 BTC seized by Bulgaria in December were almost all sold from December to beginning of this month

Greed got me, I was waiting for 4k to buy some more, now I'll only have to enjoy my current smaller hodlings...
This is good for bitcoin.
greetings
**Come on America, you can't expect us Europeans to do all the work!**
I expect fewer people will dare to go short after this. and people on the sidelines will board again. I expect that the trend will be further upward
[deleted]
any clue about whos is manipulating this market?
**Come on bulls, show them who is the boss!**
leveraged longs are at 54.5%
yesterday shorts were at 57% when this thing started.

This little spike up is very similar to the spike down we saw yesterday before the run.  We could see something similar in the other direction
Hmmm can we get back over 8k again today? üê≥üê≥üê≥ üêÇüêÇüêÇ
There she goes again! Short sellers, prepare your sphincters for the next jump above $8,000.
If this goes to 9000K by today, I will sacrifice my first born
I'm just waiting for all of Asia to wake up tbh.
Let go bulls! Let‚Äôs get it over 8k today. All in!
This is it.
Bitcoin under 8K, *Buy the fucking dip* 
ITT: Shameless begging and baseless conjecture.


Wow, bull trap after short squeeze, classic, learned so much today!
Can someone ELI5 if the bitcoin network is sustained by miners why won't it fall apart when mining becomes unprofitable as they are paid fewer and fewer bitcoins over the coming years. Thanks.
Hulk's schlong incoming.

8.2k as promised earlier.
pure manipulation be super careful, people who shorted and were expecting bitcoin to break downwards got literally REKT, rekt like super hard, wait for it to consolidate and take a direction, entering now is a suicide 
Shorters getting rekt. 

Nice to watch.
LET'S F*CKN GO BOYCE
As someone who first got in to bitcoin in late December seeing it consistently gain is so exciting! I can't stop watching the chart
Jesus Christ. Jeeeeesus Christ. 
Couldn't have woken up at a better time
What.the.fuck
holy shit my dudes
I'm scared just now. $850 increase within 15 minutes. We'll see what happens.
WTFFFFFF

I guess George Soros just bought in!
$8000. What is happening?

That was an eventful 50 minute commute to work. Don't trade and drive. Unless the market is doing THIS
If this is indeed a bull flag forming right now, we are in for another ride. 

To be honest, I doubt it. But wouldn't it be nice?
Member when we broke 8k?
Any explanation for the $1K increase besides algorithmic trading + FOMO?
Volume starting to increase a little. 
Anyone else think maybe Soros bought in lol
Bitcoin is flexing, getting ready for the NBA playoffs
Showerthought: Since so few orders of Bitcoin bought/sold over 20k $ you should have some sort of achievement if you managed to be one of those people.
Looks like someone do not want it fall below 7500...
Don't stop me now!

Any theories behind pump? Maybe [Soros](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-george-soros-reportedly-getting-144100148.html) or reaction to Syria UK parliament vote
It's almost time boys. Liftoff baby

Stand by - history in the making for the second time within 24 hours.
Told you  :)

*Dildo erectus sp. viridi* stands up and walks the crypto plains...


**Support The Bulls as much as you can folks.**
In these moves volume increases by 10-20x.

Amazing.

Huge resources on sidelines waiting to enter the market.
All in!  Let‚Äôs go!!!
Watching the fights between whales on Gdax is truly entertaining! 
I finally broke even again. Now for the long hodl and hopefully MOON
Peoples caution and paranoia to not lose their money is whats really holding back the market right now, will see if the mind set behind this changes anytime soon.
How has everyone enjoyed the green day?
Well if you missed it OMG coin just Mooned lol All my orders since JAN sold. Thanks Mr. Whale
What do you guys think is gonna happen overnight? It can't keep growing like this can it?!
**Good day from the UK**
Careful out there. A massive short requires a lot of buyers out there to build the position.

It doesnt take much to encourage a buying run at the right time when TA suggests a pivot point. Further short covering encourages it further.

It is like arm wrestling... you give your opponent a centimetre while you twist his wrist. Then push back harder when he is compromised.

Big Short: timed small pump - FOMO - stop buy cascade - short squeeze covering - then drop the hammer all in short.  
User vitalikmybuterin wrote this yesterday:

‚ÄùFriend told me this : "Tomorrow otc for hedge funds is approved.. shorts gonna get rekd bad.. best part is its derivative guys over leveraged shorts.. likely will happen between midnight and 8 am Chicago time... " not sure if I believe but if true would be stupid slingshot up‚Äù




funny story, so i just woke up and went to the bathroom to take a shit, while checking bitcoin price on my phone, my butthole exploded, bought back in at 6550 feelsgoodman
Sell now #easymoney, buy next dip lol predictable
That price chart looks like the good old  fibonacci reverse rhino horn (pros correct me if im wrong).
Be careful if this thing dips below 7500. My bet is most people have their stops there.  This thing could head in the other direction just as fast. Stay safe out there
I look at the price increase from 6:55 to 7:35 am.  $6900 to $8000.   What could possibly justify a 16% increase in value of a currency in 35 minutes?

It does seem like this price is very manipulatable. 
When I wrote that it makes sense to buy the dips on the way down, because it might go up too fast. I got downvoted. A lot!
This is not good...
time to sell
Me this morning (literally):
-wake up for my morn poo
-check phone once seated on the throne
-let out a sigh of relief and had the most relaxed morning meeting with myself in last while!  An anti anxiety shat ftw!

Thank god I got mini rekt on a short I tried last week and learned my lesson :  Went all in yesterday morn....woot woot :-D
Where are the fudders and "its goin to 4k" guys at?

Best thing about this spike is the TA experts trying to explain it
**Fork! it, I just sold my wife for 1 Bitcoin.** 
Well I'm sure we've all noticed that yesterday's 6% smack took like a day to resolve and todays 3% or 4% whatever it was took a few hours...

Smack are getting smaller, recovery times quicker... 
Any clue why shitcoins are trending and BTC market % is going down?
Stormy's dildo has made a guest appearance.
What a weird day..
Get ready guys!! 
Fuckin' > 400 USD in one 30 min candle so far.

Hope it doesn't dump too low.

Does anyone have any news of why we are pumping????!!!!
Massive bull run on NOW.
Up 15% in minutes.

Krakens trading platforms crashed.
**Come on Bulls, don't throw this victory away now!**
We should let Lamborghini know to rise their production throughput.
Can someone please tell us why pump all of a sudden? 
Some news or something like that?
I was dicussing with a friend that we should buy soon as the price is only $6800. One hour later; $7900 o_O.
nice party here :)
The sudden rise...whats happening? :) 
**East Coast - Wave 2**
The built-in technical analysis meter in tradingview.com just switched to "buy". This is the first time in a long time.
Holy fuck, thank god my stop buy limit order filled. I specifically put it $50 higher because I knew if it ever reached this price, it would be a huge rise.
TA:

It has resumed the Mitsubishi (modified) Step Pattern.
Buy Bitcoin or not guys help........
Watch the volume guys. And yes, it's a battle.
uuuh yes we've been planning this all along nothing to worry about 
Dont feed the whales :)
What was the purpose of the little dip from 6.95k to 6.8k before the spike to 8k? It seems rather odd and totally did not expect that. 
**Come on Bulls, don't throw all the hard work away!**
Well that took forever to happen.
I saw a convoy of trucks carrying quilts.
whale fight on gdax right now!
Could someone explain what's going on here to me? I've never had this happen in a Bitcoin transaction before.

Bitcoin climbing through a series of triangles while volume increases.
We implemented a transaction malleability fix (after a 2+ year debate, finally won and demonstrating anti-fragility in an entire new way for Bitcoin.

My question is regarding all the coins that use Bitcoins open source code, but didn't implement Segwit. The further we go down the road with Segwit releases of software like Bitcoin 0.16.0, am I correct in it becomes more and more difficult to "copy and paste" Bitcoins code? And coins will be forced to some developer work themselves or find another way to keep up?

Is there another malleability fix being used for the coins that were just using Bitcoins code? I know many coins are now Segwit compatible but many haven't....
Trading bots, are the Devilllll
HERE WE GO AGAAAAAAINNNNN!!!
Damn, look at that buy wall! Hope it sustains.
holy smokes...
RIP, Tether is the only coin in red today.
It's nice looking at the 1 day chart and realizing how much there is to gain. 
Don't have any bitcoin, camr hwre after swwing the jump. What caused such a huge climb?
$7,900 BTFO
almost there.

Edit: volume swing - could go higher - 8.5?  

Def 8.2.
I you sell below 8.17, you will have trouble getting back in.
bitfenix **finex** cmon delete the fck bear walls let the market flow freely,  manipulation level 100!!!
So wtf was that about?
It's like..... a whale had too many beans for lunch, took a huge dump, then swallowed that dump back up.
It always goes up Friday.. but I think it's after 5pM?

If so, what's the high point?
Wow. 100 btc sell wall at 7,975 got destroyed in seconds.
Thunderbirds are go.

Christ, that was a crappy thing to say.  LOL
8000 is the new black.
I feel sorry for the shorters... not!
All the people with open shorts are quiet all of a sudden? Interesting. (I should say *had* open shorts). Rekt. 
I haves dreem to haves one whole of the bit coin. Since child I haves this dreem. Now no family is not alive and I haves lost everything and including job. I only ask for you to help me reach this dreem. This will make the life worth living. Pleese help this dreem become truthful. 
Arise my son! Arise! Proud Son of Satoshi! 
Now this is what i call a dildo 
Wow. I went all in with 30k yesterday...this is how the bulls repay me! Let me tell you how USA sentiment works. My boys who didn‚Äôt listen to me in Alabama are now buying in. This will be out of reach for the West Coast by the time they wake up 
"Thanks for buying at 8k, now we can afford new lambos" /whales
Can‚Äôt wait for the ‚Äúwhale manipulation‚Äù posts
Lemme get this straight.  Apparently this subreddit believes that a multi-billionaire investor, and notorious short, hatched a plan to short bitcoin a few days ago?   And this subreddit found out about it?  And this billionaire went ahead with the plan,  just now,  and it backfired?  

Would you modify that belief just slightly?

How about a famous and powerful billionaire and professional short,  cozies up to a handful of overwhelmed new and insanely rich exchange entrepreneurs,  who's shinny new money machines have just recently started seizing up as HODL takes a hold,  say late December 2017.   Said billionaire convinces said exchange owners to lend him bitcoin,  for a fee of course, ya know,  to replace the trading income that's disappearing?   Do that independently,  secretly, and simultaneously with just four or five exchanges,  and........

Or not




So it will slowly going down after this short squeeze right?Basically it's just like yesterday for me to wait it going down ...
The price is once again in that strange (for BTC) very narrow range moving sideways.

These are odd times.  I haven't seen this trend before.  No gradual decline or rise or the usual oscillations.

It is either going to be huge red or green dildos.
Beijing waking up.

8k will be breached.

Then beyond 8.2 (8.5?)

Settling at 8.2.

Don't sell under 8.17
Cor blimey, so the dip is really over. Good thing I bought a good amount a week ago.
We are like a Great White Shark approaching their prey.  First we give 8k a little tap with our snout to inspect and we fall back just a little before coming back full blast for the kill.  
I suspect Bitcoin is female: completely unpredictable and irrational.
We all want to get to the moon but It's not happening today, just wait and see.

It's just gonna drop down like 5-10% now at any time.

Congrats to everyone who bought the dip from 19k and held all the way down. Bitcoin is the future yeah it might drop below 6k but just know it will come back up. You have to understand the game before you play.
Look, we're pushing 8k now, wake up guys.

Lambo mode engage
Up 1k in 24 hours; slowly creeping back down 1k in the next 24 hours. Oh Bitcoin, you evil temptress. 
New the Bitcoin world so just getting my head around it and was hoping someone could let me know if what im thinking is right. 

So based on the original whitepaper Bitcoin is a system of electronic cash that allows for peer to peer payments meaning we dont need paypal for example . Its my understanding that the way paypal works or any trusted third party payment provider works is like below 

In a normal situation where two people wish to send money to each other over the internet they use a trusted third party such as PayPal. The reason that they use a trusted third party is to ensure that the money being transferred is actually transferred and received. If we take the example of Alice sending money to Bob Paypal would credit Alices account of they money and then debit it to Bobs account. PayPal creates a record of this process ensuring the neither party can later claim that payment wasn‚Äôt sent or received. If PayPal didn‚Äôt exist Alice could tell Bob she issued payment without actually having done so or Bob could claim payment was never received. This allows for Alice to double spend the money she owes or for Bob to request double payment. PayPal acts as an intermediator to the transaction charging a fee for the service of providing payment transfer. 

With Bitcoin payments are peer to peer meaning no trusted third party is used. Instead of paypal confirming transactions and creating a record of payment and receipt this is all done in an automated way with transactions being grouped together to form blocks and blocks being linked together in a sequential chain that can only be added to and once added to cant be altered. 

Transactions are confirmed once a block has been created and added to the blockchain. For a block to be created people have to expended computational power looking to solve for a nonce value. The nonce value is a value that gives a blocks header a certain value but im not sure what this value is .

Could someone please explain what a nonce is and tell me if I am on the right track  in terms of paypal versus bitcoin? 
price going up

judging by the comments the huge dildo we saw in btc is due to a pump and dump group... if not forgive me daily discussion 
But Bitcoin is dead!!!!! omg ??
BUY TYME ____TO THE MOON
Bought at 7300 and it sky rocketed to 7550. Have put a stop limit at 7500. Feels good.
https://coub.com/view/whvpg
wow what happened!
**Another HUGE GREEN CANDLE please!**
It appears that with slightly more volume, this may indicate a possible breakout. However it is still a moderate movement. Nevertheless the buyers and sellers may possibly have agreed on a price. There could be an increase in the number of trades today.
Dang it! My gdax deposit clears tomorrow! Now I'm going to wait to buy until it cools down a bit. 
Hi.  Need some advice.  I have been into bitcoin for a couple of years. Done me well.  However I am working with a young guy who is 16.  I am at a loss of what advice to give him.  Any suggestions for wallets for an under 18 year old in the UK will be very appreciated. He is intending to put in 10 to 20 quid a week max so bit pointless buying a trezor now. Even xapo is age restricted now (don't remember that in 2015).
Was reading Bitmex trollbox, craziest responses ever
Someone HODL me. 
**Don't throw this away Bulls**
I like what this guy has written:

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/tdwpmW45-BTC-Word-of-The-Day-SHORT-SQUEEZE/
So why the sudden jump today?  It's been wavering in the 6.6K to 7.1K range for the last several weeks.  Suddenly, today is a breakout from that range.

Any news causing this surge? 
Where is that guy, MrMan/ProfessorDingle etc etc? 
a swing up like a golf stick https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin
Only people arriving to morning workstations at this hour is Siberia / Alaska.

Nothing against those folks, but they're not exactly numerous.
It's testing.  Someone wants it over 8k.

8.2
I feel it 
Are we breaking out????!!!
Blast off.
Oh boy, it's happening, from 7720 to 7900..we might test 9k resistance in the next few hours.

I have been trying to understand what shorting is for the last few days and I have a rough idea after some reading.

Please educate me here people, so I was basically thinking about what I think happened today, if huge numbers of people were shorting surely if enough people buy at a certain point then that would stop this trend?

My main concerns in the last week or so have been what happens if people just keep shorting continually the price will never move ie pump and dump continually?

Lastly do the shorters have a get out card ie a stop loss trigger

Again you need to speak to me like a 6 year old I am learning slowly
Unfortunately I missed today's race, any advice?
I have been trying to recover from 0.2BTC since April that my father-in-law and my mother-in-law lost being deceived by a group of people. Unfortunately they are poor and without much study
Touche 
2am volume spikes
Sorry for the newb question, but what are the transaction fees for sending BTC from Breadwallet to GDAX? For now, I buy BTC on GDAX and store it on Breadwallet. But if I want to transfer some back to GDAX to sell, will I get screwed by fees?

Anyone with knowledge on this issue would be greatly appreciated!
Here it comes, next leg up....
Best Krypto day in 2018
Sorry probably dumb question, but do you guys think this is a good time to buy?
Here we go.  8.2k 
Not yet! But it could happen in a blink.
Do you think there will be more shorts to be squeezed further up?
So what the hell happened... I haven't gotten the memo yet.

Why did every crypto spike up yesterday?
Can someone ELI5 what "shorts squeezed" means?
I'm having trouble finding a good active thread on option for tumbling bitcoin and/or purchasing anonymously. Can anyone help me out? Personal reccomendations are fine however I'm not interested in tumblers that rare run by illegal markets.
Good ol' Mitsubishi Step Pattern to 100k.

Good day to you all. 
-Over $7k today folks?

-Volume is going up slowly which is a good sign. This time yesterday we were around 7500 on GDAX, today 10700.
Hello there, 

I've been accumulating some fraction of BTC (just a bit above 0.1BTC) little by little renting my GPUs time on Nicehash.

In my area (Belgium), there is a possibility to use BTC for purchasing delivery food. I've been wanting to pull the trigger on a large Hawaii Pizza delivery just to have a feel that I'm using my BTC and not just Hodling. But don't want to be THAT pizza guy. That kinda summarize my BTC experience at the moment. Since the value of the BTC is dropping, the amount of pizza I would be able to buy is constantly dropping. FOMO or Pizza?

I don't think that the BTC value of a pizza worth today 15 euro will ever pay me a lambo in the future, but at the same time I just could use fiat to pay the pizza and keep hodling and see what the future bring.

Well that was fun and short lived 
That pushed Bcash down to 0.092

Yay.

(But they'll be shouting "we breached 700 USD" as if it was some sort of victory.)

Edit: added a bit.
I literally woke up on the right side of that dildo and went all in lol

woohoooo!

this might be the bull flag breakout. wouldn't it be nice?
Showerthough - BTC, today, reached its highest price of the month so far...
Time to deposit more fiat
I apologize for such a noob question but can anyone tell me exactly what to do in GDAX to set an order to sell all of my bitcoin if the price drops to 7500? I have read their guide so many times but still don't really understand the limit/stop and taker/maker stuff. I want to ensure I realize gains from this 14% increase before it drops back down to 6500. Thanks!
Holy shit we are at 8000 dollars again. Get those buy orders ready we going to the moon.
Annnd back down it goes. Was fun while it lasted, but not really. 
8k isn't coming. Stop. After a 1k increase in eighteen hours there will be a HARD pullback.
If this turns out to be a PnD then it will further solidify the fact that Bitcoin is incapable of becoming a currency.
Touched 8000 on Bitstamp..

Will push on to a little beyond 8.2 then fall back.

I would add that I predicted 8.2k earlier - see below.

LPT: If waiting to buy, don't stop watching the market when you go to have dinner

Allot of people still waiting on the sideline because they think it's a trap. If a whale is smart, they would pump at least one more time before dumping to earn peoples trust back into BTC. After that, it might even grow naturally even with their dumps. 
Ok someone riddle me this.. On Gdax theres a red 66BTC sell order at $7,730.00 sat there. Just across the spread theres a 17BTC green buy order at $7,729.99 theres literally $0.01 difference between them.

Why don't the exchanges just match them up? I really REALLY doubt those selling/buying are going to quibble over small change that adds up to less than $1.00 in total?

**Please can you all upvote this thread, not my post but this price thread.  Thanks.**
Be patient.

8.5k coming.

Settling at 8.2k.
Volume is low = ~~bear~~ bull trap :D
Now *that* was orchestrated! Does anyone know which groups do this signalling?
Pro shorts still killing the small guy I think.   I think pro shorts made off with your fiat in the initial plunge from ATH to 6k,  I think most covered, but not all. Pro shorts are ballsy.  As the remaining close their large positions, you see these spikes.

But now the newb shorts have arrived, and their panic will add fuel to the fire.

PS: I feel like a war correspondent 
IS THE BULL MARKET FINALLY COMING? 
Did some technical analysis on the charts. I know TA can be unreliable at times but it does explain why there's an increase. I don't think it's a bull market though - just a temporary increase
Here's my full thoughts:

i think...my opinion...
if in next few hours there is a big dump....
bitcoin is over,end game.........
This isnt over yet, my TA guestimate puts it over 8500$
Let us enjoy Mick Mulvaney while he‚Äôs still in power. Without him, bitcoin would have been regulated to the ground. We were hoping for 2 more years so we can work on adoption but it looks like he‚Äôs gone too.
