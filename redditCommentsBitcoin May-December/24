sent a little btc back to gdax to sell, and it promptly tanked. goddamn it.
#~~**IT'S OVER 9,000**~~

~~*Nevermind...~~

#**IT'S OVER 9,000**
I've been putting in all my spare fiat since late last year, and though the price is important, what's MORE IMPORTANT is the fact that every day the crypto industry as a whole is getting more developed and adopted- and daddy BTC gets more exposure. The future is bright :D
lel, 303 BTC sell wall @9310 on gdax. Somebody use Jedi mind tricks to make it disappear.
Alright boys. Get ready for the biggest pumped weekend ever. 3....2.....1.....
**COME ON BULLS!**
Btc keep going up...yeah baby! :)

A lot of people on here are spoiled brats who have no idea how markets work, btc is up quite a bit from yesterday, yet people are bitching because it went down a little in the past hour? Every investment/currency goes up and down, the key is going up more than you go down, if you are gonna freak out every time it goes down, than you shouldn't be investing in anything, let alone crpto where the swings are a lot larger.
why people are shorting now is beyond me. Begging to be burnt. Been saying it all week lol
TA: A bit wibbly wobbly at the mo.
This is probably the wrong place to ask. As a freelance graphic designer that's never worked in coding or anything along those lines, how would I get in touch with someone coding a wallet so I could help out with a the UI design? I just think it would be cool to use a wallet that I helped out with.
Thanks
I am considering that perhaps bulls were merely consolidating liquidity during the previous $100 upwards pump + dump, since they didn't attempt to defend the gains. Could be interesting. If 9.2k holds, possibly a good sign, if it doesn't, back to 8.8k perhaps.

[EDIT] I know that some bulls out there have been doing great. If it turns out that you don't have sufficient backing at 9.2k then that's not your fault. If you get backing, then let's hope that backing sticks for a while. The sell pressure has been a bit hard lately at these levels.
Bogdanoff, plz. Letz 9k be ze bottom.
To be honest, I won't really have confidence in any sudden pumps right now. I'd rather see some stabilization at a point where the price can be defended properly. First we need to test where the floor is.

If sellers are so eager to sell, let them sell plenty at sub 9k, then we might ascend again with less sell pressure.
wtf just happened?

WTF

Wow. Soros fat fingered a trade lol.
Above 9k at this weekend would be a progress and appreciated so we can start the 10k rallye next week with fresh money 

huge fight at 9350 at bitfinex now. if it falls, we might dip a bit 
east coast taking as back again, weak hands
is it really the rally towards 10k

Potential cup and handle playing out?
What is a minimum functional amount when attempting to buy dips in BTC?  To clarify what I mean is, Whats the least amount to use to make a day trade while absorbing the fees?
Are these little pull backs bear traps?
Lower.
I think we're about to see sharp move up on Bitcoin. Falling wedge which is about to close. Those normally have sharp reversals. 
Hi guys, a quick question: I was wondering about an aspect of margin trading. I don't know wether this is important but let's say I got 10,000 USD in my margin account. I would like to know what is the difference between opening a short position of 5 BTC volume with 2x leverage and 2BTC volume with 5x leverage, I would have thought that I would get the same gains as long as the price dips right? I just want to confirm wether my knowledge is on point.
is Mt Gox reason for this dip ?
Pump eet 
Well, the Europeans don't seem to be too bullish. I guess we'll have to thank the Asians for saving the day...
Meanwhile, over on the naughty step:

You know, r/btc don't have a daily discussion.  

There's fucking nothing to talk about, except whinging, moaning and more mad conspiracy theories.

Their latest thing is the phrase **Becash or begone**

Which is supposed to be some sort of advertising genius tag-line - well it would be, if it wasn't wanky and embarrassingly poor.


Europe wakes up ...

There is a strong, smart, pissed off generation coming up. I’m 26 and I don’t think my generation has the vision nor any older generation but my nephews are 11 and know this stuff better than most people. 

If it’s not adopted soon, it will idle for ten years and than explode but we don’t know what this world will do this year. It’s crazy. I work in military. The coming years don’t look good. We need this now. 
I wish my generation and up were smart enough to realize that we need adoption now or we ourselves wont enjoy the freedom it brings. It’s mind numbing why bitcoin supports aren’t as passionate for adoption as the scam artist Ver is passionate scamming people. I hate the man. He stole money from me and my family with his bait and switch but I like his passion that he knows we need adoption now, not later. 
Friday, the legendary FOMO Day. 
Good morning everyone, just arrived to work and it is nice to see that we are above $9,300. Hopefully, we see some more ppl buy more btc especially since today is payday. I receive a bonus today so might put some of the money on crypto. Also, I hope we get to 10k by the weekend and hold it there in order for us to go above the $10k mark next week. 
This market needs to stop letting Ver add confusion. It’s getting criminal!!  If people want to buy Bcash, let them but don’t allow Ver to do  the bait and switch!! If my parents got conned, there has to be thousands of other pissed off families. Ideology (I know Andreas says no one owns the name) has to stop that no one owns the name when people (adoption) looking to use bitcoin are getting scammed out of thousands of dollars. Congress will act if we don’t. Please step up and don’t let this continue. 
Where do you guy see the price in late juli or early August 
What do we think of bitcoinwisdom.com? I've used it for tracking price for years but are there better alternatives?
I think it's time soon for the next leg up...

But maybe only to test 9.4k, because that's the upper border of the uptrend channel. Will be hard to break that...

*If* it breaks through it will either be corrected immediately, or it will start a bull run.
MEW hacked! If I had a Satoshi for every time I have seen or heard someone say, just a matter of time for MEW, I'd be mooning. Offline MEW folks. Difficult and time consuming to do, but well worth it. Fuckin scumbag thieves!
Please don't be another trap....
MACD and RSI cools off but didnt go further down.  I have good hopes on this.
Thou shall not pass 9.2k!

Big ol' dump
Did Charlie Shrem ever get 1&#37; of all bitcoin?
https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#3m

It is worrisome that fees are going up no matter how insignificant. Segwit and Lightning should fix this problem by now. It’s the #1 indicator we look at abd if it continues going up, it can’t be a currency. As soon as we approach $10k, fees go up. It shows what would happen if it goes back to ATH. 
Hey guys I'm a noob so forgive my noobness but had a question. I'm new to the crypto game and bought some bitcoin this morning and transferred it to my binance account. It's been over 10 hours and I still haven't received it in binance. I double checked the wallet address from the sending app and it's correct. Is this normal for bitcoin? I'm kind of freaking out. Should I be?
If we go back under 9k, at least that will be interesting.
Friday evenings are usually big pumps so
Question: Why are companies attempting to represent digital assets with non-Bitcoin blockchain tokens? What is the meat and potatoes of the reason? (Referring to things like the 'Eliocoin' not any of the Roger nonsense.)

Why can't the types of functionality that allow for these digital assets tokens, just be a normal part of the primary Bitcoin chain?

Is this the inspiration for Gmaxwell's sidechain crew?
God damn we gotta hold the 9000 wall.
TA: Classic 9k teaser pattern continues to consolidate.
I swear there are only like five people buying and selling right now. How can it be that I set to buy at a certain price and NOBODY else's trades aggregate to my price? - Say I'm buying 0.05214 BTC at $9150.01 the amount of BTC stays at 0.05214 at $9150.01 as I wait for my order to get filled.
Does anyone know the Binance actual time gap  between "trades" and "24hour" \+/\- percentage". Can't really be 24hrs, is it?
I clicked that button to get that new interface on reddit. Can't stand it. How do I get the old one back. Sorry, wrong thread. Just a quick if anyone knows. Thanks
Let the weekend pump begin! 
Well that didn’t last 
Nearly 10.000 coins traded in 5 minutes on Bitfinex. 
Big sideway movements. Something big gonna happen soon. 
I think back to $9 800 today. $9 400 is gone. 
**Pullback Over? Bitcoin Retakes $9K, Eyes Further Gains**

https://www.coindesk.com/pullback-over-bitcoin-retakes-9k-eyes-further-gains/

Having recovered from a five-day low hit yesterday, bitcoin (BTC) has potential for a move higher towards major resistance at $9,880, the technical charts indicate.

The cryptocurrency moved back above $9,000 in the Asian hours after the pullback from the recent high of $9,767 ran out of steam around the ascending (bullish) 4-hour 50-candle moving average (MA).

As of writing, BTC is trading at $9,251 on Bitfinex, representing marginal losses over the previous day's close (as per UTC) of $9,270.

A bearish follow-through to Wednesday's bearish outside-day reversal would have been bad news for the bulls, but BTC instead appreciated by 4.5 percent on Thursday, keeping them in the game. Had BTC closed yesterday below $8,765 (Wednesday's low), the bears would have had the upper hand for the short-term.

View **The pullback seems to have ended at $8,652, leaving bitcoin set to scale the resistance at $9,280 (double top neckline) and rise towards the 200-day MA located at $9,878.**
What in the actual fuck? Fuck the east coast. Seriously.
Can someone explain to me one thing? Is BTC an investment or a currency? Because in order for BTC to eventually take a major adoption by people it will first need to stablize. As of rightnow people are using it as an investment. Im think crypto has amazing potential but what is the goal if theres no stability?
I’m a broke college student until May. I put in 200 and have 500 right now. I don’t wanna sell, but idk. I need money for food lol. 

Suggestions? Grind it out? Any solid resistance predictions?

*EDIT*
I sold all my bitcoin. Luckily I sold it at the peek for these last 3 weeks (LUCKILY). Now I’m working and making good money. Time to re-invest now that it’s dropping hard again. Thanks for the advice m8s!!

Bitcoin saved my ass in college. Nice story. 😎
Thou shall not pass $9,220!

We need The Bulls to show us that they mean serious business over the next few days.
Why do I keep seeing people compare saving in bitcoin to saving USD like there's no other place you could possibly store your money?

Alright US....Can we keep it above 9k this morning?
Will btc reach 10k soon?
I told you, back to 8800 😂
[removed]
Looks like we're losing all progress again. I genuinely think 9.7k was the top for the a bit of time.
  
in 10 min market opens and manipulation starts. Fuck wallstreet. 
It was super obvious that it will drop to 8800
