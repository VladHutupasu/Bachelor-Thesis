Daily Discussion, March 12, 2018
So, what we have learned so far:

- resistances mean nothing
- supports mean nothing
- buy and sell walls mean nothing
- trend lines mean nothing
- candle patterns mean nothing
- oscillators mean nothing
- dumps are unpredictable
- so are pumps
- flipping a coin is more reliable than any TA

Is there anything meaningful in this Bitcoin world?
BTC goes into a bear market for barely a few months and many people are saying it will never reach new ATH...bullshit
God damit!! Why did i go to sleep!?!? I could have fucking sold the top and been out i was in the green damit FUCK!!!
Finally watched John Oliver from 3/11. Are we allowing #craefulgang to become a thing?
I've been watching the damn thing fall down to its knees all day long without doing anything at all, while in my imagination I sold at 9.8k and bought at 8.8k, so I'm making an imaginary profit. Enough trading for today.
Now this is beautiful. Every comment in this thread as of 7:19am seems to be smart, insightful, well thought and from actual people not the same ‚ÄúRedditor for 3 weeks‚Äù spreading FUD or smell like Bcash shills just attempting to piss people off for ‚Äúfun‚Äù. 
You never see it go up $500 in 5 min but it can drop $1k in 5 min like nothing. Typical world standard, Good things rarely happen by themselves , but shit happens all the time .....for no reason .,,,
why people wanna buy expensive bitcoin and not cheap bitcoin?, really, i don't understand, this price, after the 20k, is like a dream, 8k, 9k, it doesn't matter.

I bought my first bitcoin just last year, not 3 or 4 years ago, and this price make me happy(not at all i don't have a job for now), but can have more bitcoin with less money.

even if you buy bitcoin at 20k, still is a good chance to get bitcoin at 50% the price on January.

20k will be reached again, tomorrow, 1 month, 1 year, its a matter of time, relax and enjoy.
So anybody‚Äôs who commenting ‚Äúah itt will drop below 6k‚Äù or ‚Äúah it will be around 100k by the end of the year‚Äù
Or  12k by monday. Please for the love of the crypto gods, comment also based on what. Otherwise we will automatically assume you pulled out of your ass. 
Not judging, I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs valuable info and it‚Äôs rather distracting. 

So here‚Äôs my prediction. 
Even though cryptos were around for a long time now, the world is only catching up now. If you go on the street and ask a random somebody 50% chance they will say it‚Äôs witchcraft. And this is why it‚Äôs important to talk about it. 
So the more and more ppl will understand it and regulations by governments are settled the price will become more stable. 

The us congress had s debate on valentines day. If the crypto world world truly are in danger of crashing, then why would their defence department invest in upgrading their systems to support cryptos on quantum computers. 
Not to mention all the miners who destroyed the VGA market and made it very Very hard to buy a gtx 1080 Ti. Now they are probably part of the resistance since they have hardware investments in it as well. 

The banks hate it probably, since it can hurt their business so I am expecting a lot of media fear mongering. 

Also don‚Äôt forget 
Koreas: ‚Äúwe will ban bitcoin‚Äù
*Korea buys bitcoin*
Korea: ‚ÄúOh, we won‚Äôt ban bitcoin after all.‚Äù

Still read the news politics and tech. But know who controls them. 

Please share your opinion. I don‚Äôt mind if being told I am wrong, quite the contrary I love a healthy debate. 

That feeling when you can throw so much shit at BTC but it comes back bigger, better, stronger, faster..
Same time as yesterday
It‚Äôs heartbreaking scrolling down this post and seeing the early optimism, turn to anguish and despair higher up :‚Äô(
Why are you fucking dumping ?
bitcoin stop triggering my stop-limit order and then going under it ffs
now we can see every chart and TA analyst just got fuccked in the face and its all pretty much just a guessing game. 

Yesterday was refreshing. Being a part of Bitcoin has been exhilarating. I'm fortunate to have a disposable income to play with, and the patience to slow play my buys. Hats off to the day traders, I can only imagine the type of anxiety highs/lows that would bring. Cheers to good week with at least one good dip for a guy who needs to make his weekly buy.
these whales are rinsing everyone's wallet 
Bitcoin doesn't give a fuck.
Ok, time to play the nap card. I'm going to take a nap and when I wake up BTC will be @9.4k.
So in all seriousness, there is no price where BTC has "support." That doesn't exist and you need to understand that.
Is the coast clear yet or are there more red dildos to come?
Nice to see green, BTC is showing its resilience after last weeks FUD and not so positive news & Binance issue last week :)
Dat HBO bump.
Yeah crypto is fucked for the time being.

No big news coming, just FUD.

Regulation is great and everything but adoption by industries and public interest is in free fall - taking the price with it.

Either something big needs to happen or I'll see you all in 2020 for wave 4 I guess.
Keep on hodlingüòé
Good morning everyone. 
No one can break Bitcoin ever
It's only $200 more and it feels like it's 20,000.
ShowerThought - At least, exchanges should list mbtc / ubtc as bitcoin derivatives.
Did anybody go into H&R Block to file their taxes?
to the moon,100k,1million....lol
1% of bitcoin people have 90% of bitcoin,
manipulation,bitcoin is 100% wales manipulation....
This is a bit of a long read to say the least, but it has some very interesting observations about market volume....

Those pump and dump periods became shorter and shorter.

I'm exhausted trying to keep up with bitcoin prices. Idk how traders do this.
When Asia wakes up this will probably get much worse, sadly. 
I'm waiting for $8k then buying the dip

Pumping now, and here we go again dumping soon, or wait!!! , Maybe this time is different lol?

Bitcoin has spectacularly 'died' several times
üìâ - 94% June-November 2011 from $32 to $2 because of MtGox hack
üìâ - 36% June 2012 from $7 to $4 Linod hack
üìâ - 79% April 2013 from $266 to $54. MTGox stopped trading
üìâ - 87% from $1166 to $170 November 2013 to January 2015

üìâ - 49% Feb 2014 MTGox tanks
üìâ - 40% September 2017 from $5000 to $2972 China ban
üìâ - 55% January 2018 Bitcoin ban FUD. from $19000 to 8500
 üìâ  2018 MTGox crash from 12k to 7k
I've held through all the crashes. Who's laughing now? Not the panic sellers.
My gut tells me we never see <4k again. The world saw it hit 20k less than 3 months ago, lol. Possibility of 5x your investment... how many people in America alone play the lottery? At 4k, your odds of making money seem inevitable, therefore, I'm not expecting to see it. I know nothing, but I truly believe that 7 will be your new floor and rarely happen in the next year. Just stating an opinion for "I told you so" conversations later on. Plus, all these moody hell and damnation predictions are bummin me out, lol
I'm calling it 10.5k by friday hopefully im right but honestly we just need to make it one week without any fud bs and the upward trend should hold
Best day to buy in likely many years to come. The 200 day EMA holds, and the price won't close under it it seems. I think we have thoroughly bottomed here. Gonna buy with $1K tomorrow morning.
Woho lets make some moolah. 
Moon moon mooooooooonüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
9.2k .... Zzzzzzz.

BTC has become really boring.
Good morning,
Seems like a nice day today. Time to grab a bit of coin. I feel like buying many coins, time to make money. ;-)
Hopefully East Coast America helps us today. 
I withdrew from Bitflyer to my nano s. The transactions screen on my nano shows this https://imgur.com/a/l7UUM I've never seen this before. Why is the address "coinbase" and not a bitcoin address? Does Bitflyer use Coinbase as a backend?
Giant red johnson forming on that 1h chart. 
wtf, why so much panic sell? 500 $ like in minutes wtff 
So USA dumping on time again.
One thing I like about this small dumps... it terminates the whole "moon", "lambo", "nobody can stop us" posts around here :) bad side, it brings out the "Oh, we gonna crash", "is is mt gox?", "whales are doing this",.... :) 

there goes my charts analysis lol
3 of the last 4 business days around 8 am PST bitcoin had a noise dive, any insights?
I'm not into spreading any "FUD", but what's up with the buying/selling of bitcoin? It clearly looks like the early investors are manipulating the free market, while some of you can ride on it for buy low/sell high. Is this what's supposed to happen until the bubble bursts and something survive, just as amazon did in IT bubble? Again, i'm asking out of interest.
Is there a way to mine data on Reddit to check price predictions and compare that w/ what actually happens? 
I came here to find some relief. My back bones are cracking with each crash. Please show me some empathy. 
We have nothing to be worried about, I just rolled the dice and it turns out 9k is today's bottom.
WTF was that!!!!
Ridiculous. Time to go up now silly Btc.
Trying to understand this market is a quick way to going insane :)
Below 9k, now the price will start stabilizing 
Someone have lots of btc to dump at $8900...wonder how much they bought it for?
Today is a stressful day again. Seems like intraday volatility is getting crazier. I've got a long open with liquidation point at $7500ish. But I'm getting scared now even. 
[deleted]
Hopefully 9k will hold and start to recover
Wave coming
Time to push it a bit.

It's clearly going to 0. Sell everything. Source: my ass
We have great support at 9.2k now! We can easily go bavck at 10k! hold strong motherfuckersssssss
Jesus Christ. 
We're just a few months away from Bitcoin having been "worth" at least $2000 for an entire year, and then a few months after that having been worth at least $4,000 for an entire year. $1,000 Bitcoin will soon seem about as likely as $200 Bitcoin. 
What happened just now?
bitcoin price right now is a trench warfare.

Massive bull trap. Damn this looks ugly.

Another big red dildo! Yay!
TO THE MOON THEE MONNNER Gsdfvew areythdgfvd 

oh wait..
Most of these bounces are fairly weak. Especially for newcomers, I think it is a bit improper to advice them to buy until we have reached solid bottom of this steep stair fall. 8.5k might be solid floor with proper bounce, though it might also go as low as 8k. This is just my opinion, but considering the candlesticks and the drop volumes lately, I'd say that this drop isn't over yet, contrasted with the lower buy volumes. We'll go back up after the drop I am sure, but this is not the best time to buy. It's always hard to catch the perfect bottom, but I'd wait a bit with buying. There will always be a limit to a fall; when people find the price too good to resist buying. The positive aspect is that after a drop, where the currency is considered undervalued enough by the market to warrant a strong buy volume, there will be a healthy rebound.
Tether's business model doesn't seem bad to me. They make profits off of trading fees. After the massive run up of bitcoin recently, they must have made loads of money. I think that they certainly could have gotten enough banks to agree to lend them money seeing as they are so profitable. Why do so many people think that the money is fake?
Stop this thing motherfuckers! It really drives me crazyyyyyyy
Gamw to mouni pou sas petage stamathste na poulate
Continuing from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/83lw7w/daily_discussion_march_11_2018/dvjs468/), we just got past EMA200: https://www.tradingview.com/x/OhIRpReF/

A very good sign if you ask me. Please don't take any of this as a trading advice, it's just me interpreting information from charts.
When u see 0 volume followed by a pump out of nowhere then flatline until another pump and flatline, do you really think this is going to repeat to the moon? Whoever paid for that ride wants their money back at some point. 
I think it will prove to be very good in long term. Imagine a situation where all 21 million Bitcoin have been mined and there is a certain wealth distribution where there is hige inequality of course, and everybody is HODLing. Then essentially Bitcoin is not usable at all and the price will be absolutely stagnant. Things will be much better and healthy if there is huge liquidity in exchanges, real life use cases as a global decentralised transactional currency and of course if the wealth distribution is somewhat uniform. All of these can only happen if these early adopters/whales sell their Bitcoin and we small fishes eat them. Remember, in a ecosystem if there is nothing to eat for small fishes then entire thing falls! I'll be absolutely happy if all those early whales panic sell their holding over night today. Bitcoin may go to zero in that case. But we will all rise in a big way once after that happens. What do you guys think?
Hold your bitcoins motherfucker bastards! I want to sell at 9500
Guys urm, what is the range where you consider high volume for BTC? I keep seeing people say it's low volume, hence it's just a small pump. 
Well good morning!
Has anyone tried Wirex? It supposedly lets you spend bitcoin via virtual and physical cryptocurrency payment card. I read this interesting article on it, thoughts? http://crypto101.org.uk/2018/03/10/is-wirex-consuming-the-cryptocurrency-payment-market/

Hi, guys. I have a question about security. Let's say you have a trezor hard wallet with your BTC on it and you want to access them through Trezor wallet which is on trezor.io website. What happens if their website and all online services go down and won't recover anymore? Is there any way to access your BTC in this case, somehow offline or through other software? Just curious. Thank you!
any bad news today made Bitcoin dropping ? 
Am I right in saying that March is historically a tricky time for Bitcoin?

I just read an analysis saying bitcoin will drop to $3,500 before rebounding. I kinda believe that too. Here's a link and it's worrying I would love to take advantage of a dip like that. Thoughts?

Let's push it now or let it die.Give me want to reinject fiat show me you still alive btc.
Here we go
Edit: its 4pm right? 
I feel market is about to rebound nicely now. BTC is finding buyers whenever it goes down. Positive sign.
Bitcoin!!!! I just want to be rich. Filthy filthy rich. So filthy that I smell like semen, mud and musty vagina on top of the street where my ancestors used to live. However, uncle tom did not agree to make a kite with his son, so he decided to buy him toys instead. Samantha, Tom's sister, decided one evening that he was going to play bingo. Tom was afraid that if he were to lose, he would not be able to win the championship. The next day, Samantha and Tom went out for a drive and stopped to grab a bite. The end.
There is no future of crypto. Buy fiat and let bankster do their job. Milking cows and shaving sheeps.
Bitcoin is trending towards 8k and not 10k
In my opinion, Btc is going down hard. The 15% climb we saw the past 24h was all the fuel needed for bears to continue. We haven't been out of the bear market from 17 December......
More proof that bitcoin is trending to 8k instead of 10k
We dipping below $9,000 again today? 
The trap has slammed hard on them mice scratching round for bits of cheese

The 4hr chart is starting to show some hope finally making a slightly bullish trend higher highs and higher lows if we can keep this going into 10k we might see the end of this market shit show so long as we don't have anymore world ending fud of mt gox proportions to hit us again! 
I can‚Äôt wait until Bitcoin goes mainstream. The idea of not having to rely on a bank and credit cards is just so amazing. It feels great to have gotten in on this so early. Also I can say ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù to everyone who said Bitcoin was a Ponzi scheme.



Also Bitcoin will always be the largest cryptocurrency. 
**2018 Cryptocurrency Crash (Elliott Wave): Fare Thee Well Ten Thousand?**

Should the Elliott Wave projection continue as anticipated, then there is a strong possibility that the high of 9990 (Bitfinex) set on 12-MAR-2018 is of quite significance in the following regard: 

i. 9990 is just 46 points shy from 9946 which represents the 50% Fibonnaci retracement of the entire Bitcoin market. Either side of this key level currently defines 'bull vs bear' territory.

ii. Should 9990 present the top of a significant wave, it would suggest Bitcoin will now never revisit the psychological 10,000 level.

Like a couple years ago someone on Reddit gifted my like half a cent of bitcoin or something really small like that.

Now, I have no idea where the heck that would be stored or saved... :(

Does anyone remember from a while back redditors giving other redditors bitcoin back when it was still low and young, and where and how that would have been transferred and stored?

I know it's a stretch at this point, but would be cool to get back...


EDIT: Fuck. It was ChangeTip and it's closed. Also it was half a cent USD, not half a cent BC, haha
Anyone here think we can get to $10k in the next 6-8 hours? 
HODL tight boys, stay strong
Arm the Green Dildo Cannons.  We are dipping boys.

Hey if anybody can help I would really appreciate it. I sent bitcoin to cryptopia about 6 hours ago (current time 7:41 PM) and it is confirmed but not in my cryptopia balance. What could be the reason for this? No point in contacting CPIA because the ticket time is 27 days. Here is the link https://blockchain.info/tx/b110943919007f1451e310f4c27a4657693ba46ddc8b9699efbe187c2c6f63f6
It is 0.02964825 BTC
Brave day trading.  I am holding.
What a great day! I believe europe will give great support and with a small help from usa we ll get to 10k
One of these days we'll have a massive short squeeze of all shorters expecting the usual dump. Hope it is today.
BTC/USD 1 hour candles forming triangle pattern. Breakout coming? With cryptos, you never know...
EDIT: about 3 hours later we're getting a nice little breakout to the upside. Hopefully, it keeps going!
EDIT 2: about 3 hours later. Annnnddd.... Back to ranging again. 
Sigh...
That mini pump before that 8k dump 
[deleted]
things are gonna get ugly when Asia wakes up
Serious question - is all hope gone? Will we ever get our pink lambos?
$12.5k by Saturday night, you heard it here first. 
This is the last chance to buy Bitcoin sub 9k.
HERE WE GO BOIZ MOON LAMBO MOON LAMBO GREEN DILDO
relaxing at 9.2k for a while, preparing for the 8.5k dump 
imo I think bitcoin needs a hard reset if it wants to start a good rally (like the 6k to 11.5k rally). Right now these fluctuations are only benefiting day traders and not long term HODL'ers
the only thing that will probably save bitcoin is retesting the 6k support again. 
Bitcoin do it for the very last time - 10.5k and I‚Äôm out.
Cryptowinter is starting, time to tether up cause we will go to 4k tomorrow.. So sad
Looks like another Mt Gox dump this morning? Anyone else think so?
In USA we trust! HODL STRONG AND WE WILL SOON BE 10K AGAIN
looks like everyone is liquidating their crypto assets. 
Do you spot incoming economic war between USA and group of China/Russia/EU?
5000 btc wall on sale at 9.8k this morning started the downtrend sale.

 So forget 10k soon, unless Satoshi comes out from hiding and gives an interview to the world, or Trump says that he loves BTC,  there will no change to this shit loop pattern.

TLDR: https://i.imgur.com/F1brFLf.png
Prediction: Price on GDAX is gonna hover around 8,900 for two/three hours, then drop a few hundred dollars. I'm noticing a pattern here lol. This cycle has been repeating since last night.
Honestly I'm pretty over this whole Bitcoin getting rich shit. Once it hits 12k I'm out. Tired of that shit going up and then sinking faster than my cum dripping out my girls vagina. Sucks I had so much faith in this BS but all of a sudden we cannot get out of this loop. 8k-10k is where we have been stuck for the last couple months. Tired of that.
Less than 300 to go before bitcoin is, at its actual value deemed by the market.
[removed]
it is difficult to reach 10k
