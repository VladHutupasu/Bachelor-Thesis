Daily Discussion, January 28, 2018
Has anyone noticed how a few people talk about crypto and bitcoin these days? 2 weeks ago it was everywhere from taxi driver to news anchor were talking about bitcoin and crypto. But now it is like back in October only bitcoiners are still interested.

Maybe I am wrong 🤷🏻‍♂️
BTC warming up its turbo 
All volume on gdax in ETH 
The price got within $20 of where I had set my sell order, then it just dumped. This requires a lot of patience.
Everyday there are commercials in Japan for BitFlyer and DMM Bitcoin. It’s getting crazy over here with famous Japanese movie stars and TV celebrities. The news every morning and night is about Coinchek. Now tv programs are getting  it by interviewing people who’ve made money on it. What to make of all this? 
Waiting for Coinbase to send out a delay notification since bitcoin is picking up
Escalator up, elevator down
Segwit transaction percentage is rising. Adoption is increasing.

What factors have caused the huge mempool drop? I was pleasantly surprised when i looked.
nice run of liquidated shorts. https://mobile.twitter.com/bitmexrekt?lang=en
what the fuck
Whales are awake again.. fucking turds
I'm usually a patient individual, but this BS back and forth with the price is getting old real quick. 
all the exchanges  have BTCs price above 11,7 but coinbase is selling it for ~300/400 less... why the discrepancy? 
Just created a segwit address and transfered my btc into it.
Already got a confirmation with a 5sat/byte fee in less than a minute.

Total fee: 0.10usd

When the network is working as it should, bitcoin is simply brilliant.

Can't wait for LN and more segwit support.


Banged a Hong Kong hooker and paid in BTC. Her name was ‘Moon’. Bullish sign
I was so fucking happy with myself when i cashed out before going to bed to avoid the dip....
are Opendime bitcoin "sticks" on Segwit? 
I've been off this forum for a month. Why is the price stable at $11k? It's been like this nearly 2 weeks. Is there any reason or is this random?
Damn. Big drop just now
this guy lost $20 million in the past hour. .don;t feel too bad about your loss

tanking like it does every Sunday/Monday for the past 5 weeks in a row 

I was right again:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7tjgu4/daily_discussion_january_28_2018/dtdec1k/

The downvoted comments are the ones that are worth reading because they contain needed criticism. not the gorupthink ones that are wrong or overly optimistic

Blech. I don't like the chart yesterday or today. Where's the volume? The action reminds me of lots of penny stocks over the years - all the daily gains come in like... 30 minute chunks, the rest of the day is extremely flat. It's certainly not fun to trade.
Volume is way down.

All the weak hands have shaken out; they were driving frenetic sideways or downwards movement due to FUD. Low volume is great: it's all strong hands and HODLers from here on out. I'll take BTC at 11,000 and in strong hands over BTC at 15,000 on hype and in weak hands any day.
Not much to discuss, high 11k to low 11k

Lots of altcoin pumpers today...
Is there a subreddit or other website where I can list my website? I have a magazine that I am launching in Thursday and I’ll be accepting bitcoin. Wanted the community to know!
Train to the moon begin ?

Why is BTC dumping?

Btc showing great signs when weekends are notoriously known for being days of big dips recently. We are coming out of the slump! Monday is liftoff
Bitcoin to the moon!!!!
God you Americans are so bizarre. Last time you dragged bitcoin up to $20,000 on Gdax causing everybody else around the globe to follow only having the price to drop. Because as we all know it was far too high too quick. Now that the whole world is trading Bitcoin at shy of $12,000 youy guys are terrified to buy over $11,400 on GDAX. Do we have to hold your little hands for you? This time the pump is for real. Press the little green button. Its OK it won't hurt...
I assume as/if the tether house of cards collapses people will be desperately trying to convert usdt to bitcoin, increasing BTC price. Or will the negative press/fallout negate or outweigh that factor?
Does anybody have any sources that have calculated projected uptake rates of cryptocurrencies in the future? I need this information for my dissertation and am unsure on what the best methodology would be to most accurately calculate this. Thanks! 
Still fairly new to cryptocurrencies. I set up a small test transaction of BTC from one exchange to another. It went through in about 2 minutes. 

Sent a second, much larger, amount of BTC to exactly the same wallet address and while the transaction is confirmed, the second total hasn't shown up in my second account yet. Does this take longer sometimes?
Someone really wants to pull it down... let's find him 😡
How much are transactions roughly costing and how long are they taking, currently? 


Haven't sent anything in ages, just wondering!
Hi!
So if I want to send some bitcoin what fee should I be using atm? I don't fully get the mem pool thing. Sorry and thank you!
Are the big guys rebuying so manipulate next month?
Looks like another scam in the works.

All these people calling for 13K. It was 13K a week ago and a few days before that. Unless this is sustained it doesn't mean much.
I mean I happen to think it is finally an upside but then I know bugger all.
There will be fluctuations obviously but we should ultimately be looking for a baseline of around 15K by the end of February and around 18-19K by the end of March. That would set us up nicely for 50K by the end of summer.

Making some bank today boys. 
someone explain dollar cost averaging to me.
It's about to take off! Buy in the dip boys
It may take even years before the moon. I'm ready to hodl and buying this dip.

These are great signs for BTC however we need to break & stay over 11,600 to break this cycle. Cmon btc 
[what do you think the reason for the spike was?](https://i.imgur.com/LUL0e6n.png)
TIL that both Buffet and Soros called bitcoin a bubble. Feelsbadman, they are the most respectable investors in the world.
Bitcoin is so boring atm...cmon...do something...
Everything is highly correlated. it means a  whale can dump 1000 coins on Gdax or Gemini and literally make all the other exchanges fall, but also all the alt coins..everything. So that means a $10 million Bitcoin sell order instantly kills off $10-20 billion in total coin market cap . You really think  this can be come a currency and store of value when it is so easy to manipulate? This is why vendor adoption is so slow, among other problems. 
Btc 3 2 1 
Q re cex.io withdrawals.

I'm US based, fully verified etc.  I understand that they do not let you withdraw to a US bank account but there seems to be a way to get a withdrawal in USD to a Visa or Mastercard.

Has anyone successfully done a withdrawal this way?  Whether yes or no, please elaborate on your experience.

Thanks
Question about btc/usdt.  Eg, assuming btc is $15k and looks like it's gonna a drop, so i go btc-->usdt and btc falls to $10k, will I then be able to go usdt-->btc and effectively by 1.5 btc (since I have $15k usdt)?  Or does usdt fall with the price of btc, and not tied to usd?
Can anyone explain this BitcoinDark.  Were we given an airdrop? When did the fork happen?
All my BTC are held on my Ledger Nano in a normal Bitcoin address. I don't really plan on moving them from there, at all. Is there much point In me setting up a and transferring to a segwit address?
Is price increasing due to LN adoption or is it unrelated?

Don’t worry guys, Monday will be a break upwards, into feb which will be a smooth run up to 25k. Trust me. 
So Tethers crashing.
I am glad there is another bear trap to shake off the deplorables
The Whales have woken up
bitstamp's depth chart looking good today 
Hahaha it’s been like one month. This isn’t a get rich quick scheme. Relax, bitcoin will ALWAYS come out on top. 
I'm telling you guys, we are about to go into a bull market.
Futures liquidating long positions and that is driving prices down same as when shorts were liquidated. What the actual fuck. 
That'll teach y'all not to buy early, thinking it will rebound.

Bitcoin is the real Shitcoin. The sooner this thing is gone the better. I just hope it goes gracefully without killing the market.
