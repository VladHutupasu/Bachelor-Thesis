It' over nine.... nevermind

It's over nine.... nevermind

It's over nine-thousand! 

(10 minutes later)

... nevermind
**$10,000 by Friday** 
Come on 9k, don't be shy.
Slow steady climb is good right now keep chugging along bitcoin

Seller logic:

"8999.9$? fuck that I aint selling #HODL"

"9000$???? REAL SHIT SELL SELL SELL SELL"

Come on let’s pass 9 k
It's over 9000!!!!
I just got my tax refund. All my friends too. We are buying bitcoin with it. We figure we can buy 23 tomorrow. Hope price stays this low. 
Everyone needs to stop selling at exactly $9,000.

Sell at $8995, $8999, or $9001.

By creating a huge sell wall at exactly $9000 it makes it very difficult for the price to go over $9,000. 
its too early for vegeta. too much sellorders triggering when it hits 9k. probably back to 8.7 again now, but hopefully not 
Actually he's prettey near positive we're busting through Vegeta's hymen very soon
Anyone shorting, please can you not do it right at 9000 mark. Sell it at 8900, or 9100 may be. But not EXACTLY at 9000, please :)
Waiting for those Asians to wake up so we can crack 9k for good
anyone have a full list of all the fucks that said Btc would never again be over 9000?

Blew past 9000, choo choo!

Too many of you want Lambos 'erry day. 'Erry day can't be a Lambo day.
Another bull flag forming.
When we hit 9K yesterday dropped to 8700, this morning it dropped down to 8800 and latest one is 8900, next time we hit 9K should be hopefully holding.
We will clear $9k today and stay above it easily I think.
At least Asia didn't sell like crazy. Now it's up to you Europe. Good morning!
This would be a very good time to get through the $9k barrier, not much resistance at the moment.  I know volume is low. 
Creeping up steadily :) 
ER?  Wat?
It's only 8am New York time, I think we need to wait a few hours until the whole of the American market is in action, also it being Sunday means volume will probably stay pretty low. 
Wait, what?!

boom.
CRAB-17 ACTIVATED bogdanoff 
It's now the 23rd here in Japan, but the 22nd was my birthday. Can I have a belated birthday present and wake up with BTC stably over $9k? Am I asking too much? Thanks in advance.
9000 is going to stick one of these pushes.
omfg the 70btc fake wall keeps moving backwards, someone really doesn't want their short position burned hahahahahaha
So close..
I’ll wait 
lets play the move the giant fake sell wall back game
for anyone not day trading, 6h and 1d charts are the only thing that matter
Are there any more BITCOINS left to mine?  Is it worth it to invest in mining hardware?
So I got a Trezor wallet and moved my bitcoin to addresses controlled by keys in my Trezor.  I was using an Electrum wallet on my computer and have been paranoid about getting hacked for a while now.  

So now I don't have to worry about getting hacked?  Now I just worry about losing my pin and seed right?  Any advice on this.  How hard is it to remember a 24 word seed?
I'm seeing a massive pump right now on gdax.


Edit: And a 140BTC sell wall at $8800. Is that what a whale looks like?
What's going on with bcash? +22% today, BTC +0.75%
Today $ 9.000,- HAS to be broken !!!!
**We need another push from The Bulls**
You want manipulation, that 160 coin sell wall at 8850 is fucking manipulation.
The bears are pissing me off, come along for the ride or GTFO.
How's everyone doing today?
shorts getting burned left right and centre.
Would be good to see another proper charge in the next few days, getting to over $10k.

Ruh roh shaggy, Bcash is creeping up on us.
12tg
Vegeta in less than 3h.
got barted 
**Support The Bulls.**
lots of sell orders triggered at 9k. I don't think many will want to get burned again. Give this another small push to 9k and we should climb quickly to 9.1
Buy or sell??

My reply yesterday to someone telling people to run. Throwing it out here now in hopes of some spirited and intelligent debate, while we watch BTC make its move toward 10.. 
**************************************
Read the article! https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/17/17247946/bitcoin-new-york-attorney-general-eric-schneiderman-investigation New York is investigating - they or the US is not shutting any one exchange down any time soon. Due process would give anybody with any sense at all; plenty of warning as to when to hook up the horses and get out of Dodge. That is, if one were to carefully follow progression of the investigation and possible subsequent case. The way I see it, the investigation could not happen at a better time. I, for one do want to know if crypto lacks government and regulator backing before I continue putting my hard earned cash into it. Anyone that believes they're not going to have their way with an industry premised upon anonymity and filled with scams and the unscrupulous, whether anyone likes it or not, truly is living the dream. Since the exchanges are not anonymous, it looks like they start there. Your "GTFO of Coinbase right now" and "If" is irrational FUD bud.
No, there’s 42 of us. We bought a Trezor and buying 23 as it stands now and putting the Trezor in a safety deposit box for two years. We drew up contracts. Just an experiment. Average refund was $9600. Child tax credit helps a lot. 
Please for advice, what is the best Bitcoin wallet right now?

I got little out of the loop with the Bitcoin recently, I have some coins in Electrum 2.6.4 and on Coinbase, but Electrum does not connect to the network and I dont want to screw up and lose anything (I am little clumsy sometimes).

Thanks in advance for any advice!

over 9k within the hour.
about 3 days for 17millions of btc.
underwhelming day 
How come a "deposit" to my wallet dosent show up as a pending transaction after 13 conformations? Looked up transaction on blockchain.info and it shows correct amount at my wallet adress, but when I look in my wallet the BTC isnt there. Don't know how many satoshis per byte, but paid $0.33 transaction/miner fee. (Yes, i am looking at correct wallet, no coin)
Where would I sell bitcoin as a minor in Canada?
Theory:
TheKissRuleApplies and GrandKaleidoscope are the same person.
Puuuussshhh

**Come On Bulls**
shorters gone short
Considering the minimal price action between yesterday and today, I personally expect this to be a top and the next twenty-four hours will be a hard pullback. You can go back in the daily charts and see similar patterns.
cant wait till mt gox dumps all their 250k bcash at once 
im waiting for 6500 to get in hehehe
Break out the crappy memes boys.

Is this the sub for TittyCoin?

Where is everybody?

Americans are all awake now so I think we will get past and stay past $9k in the next few hours. 
Why the big dump?
Everyone talks about Lambos, but if I was to buy an exotic card when we moon it would be this. https://www.autotrader.com/cars-for-sale/vehicledetails.xhtml?zip=90001&referrer=%2Fcars-for-sale%2Fsearchresults.xhtml%3Fzip%3D90001%26startYear%3D1981%26sortBy%3Drelevance%26firstRecord%3D0%26endYear%3D2019%26modelCodeList%3D308%26makeCodeList%3DFER%26searchRadius%3D10&startYear=1981&numRecords=25&firstRecord=0&endYear=2019&modelCodeList=308&makeCodeList=FER&searchRadius=10&listingId=460538319
Cmon ZIL baby. Make me that Zillionaire!
Scared
Overbought and momentum is at a peak. Don't be surprised if there's a hefty price drop in coming days. Let's get out of this bear market, but I am afraid that time isn't here yet. good luck out there.

sweet, trying to get a confirmation b/c of something urgent and it's taking forever for the next block

what's the point of raising the fees if blocks can just randomly take forever

this is why this isn't taken seriously 
3 times rejected on 30 minute chart - 9K is proving to be difficult. I am still of opinion that not enough momentum to break the bear trend fully. Although we are trying..

https://ibb.co/d7CiWx

Bitcoin has the possibility to either fail or succeed. You know I just stick to cash because it ain't risky. It's what they say in Soviet Russia, "In Soviet Russia, you don't get bitcoin, bitcoin get you"
