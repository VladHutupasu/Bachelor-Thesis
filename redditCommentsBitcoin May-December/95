1K a day keeps the FUD away.

Went to poop and my stop loss nearly triggered.  Going to have to start wearing diapers.
[Bitfinex announce support for SegWit!](https://twitter.com/bitfinex/status/965983482152407041)
Guys dont worry about the skydive plunge correction down to 10.8k. We will be at 17k by March
...And Saint Hodler raised his Bitcorn up on high, saying, "O LORD, bless this Thy Holy Bitcorn that with it Thou mayest blow Thine government and banks to tiny bits, in Thy mercy." And the LORD did grin and the people did feast upon the lambs and sloths and carp and anchovies and orangutans and breakfast cereals, and fruit bats and large chu...... And the LORD spake, saying, "First shalt thou put the Bitcorn to Holy Full Node, then shalt thou count to one million, no more, no less. One million shall be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be one million. One hundred thousand K shalt thou not count, neither count thou two hundred K, excepting that thou then proceed to one million. Five millions is right out. Once the number one million, being the one millionth number, be reached, then lobbest thou thy Holy Bitcorn towards thy exchange, who being naughty in My sight, shall snuff it."[
you know the bulls are going hard when a 2% drop causes people to panic and think we are going back down
So this is what happens if a whale takes a dump. I always wondered.
12,000 coming tomorrow after this brief sell-off is over with
So whoever these guys / bots / whales are in the past few hours were thinking hey, this is so flat, let's spice things up. Yeah, we're having a lot of fun here, thank you very much.
One piece of advice to everyone, either be a bull or a bear, don't be a sheep in the crypto world. 
Warning, I just bought some Bitcoin.. the price will drop now.
# Edit: Called it! Bought at $11,800. 
What happened to the people who claimed they "lost their family and everything they own" during the dip?
South Koreans are going crazy for the Bitcorn again!  :) 
Manipulation. Or panic sells
What i want to know is why is people saying “bitcorn”
Dont panic guys...its just a small typical correction! We ll be 12k by the end of the week
I feel like we're gonna smash through this $11,700 wall very soon...
I've been buying small amounts since early last year. I never was a hardcore believer, but thought it would at least be an interesting and worthwhile investment until "better tech" came along. After the latest turn around from ~6k, I am now a true believer. I don't think this will be stopping anytime soon, and I don't think any other tech will coem around that can recreate what bitcoin has become. There is nothing like it! 
Man it's an all out war right now on the 1-minute candles on gdax.....All you see is FLASH RED, RED, GREEN, RED, GREEN. kinda exciting. lol. 
I'm going to cast the most powerful spell I know. https://i.imgur.com/7rTCyUY.png
Does Vegeta need to warm up again?
Coinbase transaction fees are extremely low right noooowwwww. Omg
Another one deployed segwit today. Now 22: https://bitcoincore.org/en/segwit_adoption/
Just a noobish question. But bitcoin bought on coinbase. Are those real bitcoin, or just a value gambling if the "real bitcoins" go up or down in price?
Thanks
Look at this! more bullish news! https://crypto-lines.com/2018/02/20/regulating-cryptocurrencies/
quick math question....

(Sorry I am not good with numbers) Let's say I have made a $500 profit with my initial investment.  Am i smart to take some (or all) of that profit and rebuy BTC even though the cost has gone up.  Assume that I want to invest and hodl for the long run.

Thanks!
FOMO ENGAGE
Bitcoin is taking over the market again. I remember when it had 32%. Now it has 39% of the total market.
WTF?
Bitcalm
What a ride.
You've had your fun, BTC. Now go back up. Pretty please?
11200 is good support if it not works then next stop at 10800
What we're seeing is sideways price action for a bit because of the 50 DMA crossing below the 100 DMA. No worries.
Whatever the outcome we all have to admit this thing knows how to keep the adrenaline flowing.
guys are we gonna crush like 6th feb or just random dip ? time to sell to usdt or just hodl for alts ..
Damn!... I was about to press the "Make this trade" button when my 0.2 bitcoins would've gave me a $3000CAD at my lunch break.. So I can rebuy now.. oh well..
I don't like how it's testing the same price over and over again. 
ElI5 whats a mempool?
Silver lining is shitcoin cash is crashing hard. Not directly proportional to btc now % wise
I wish I hadn’t sold at 10.8...

However, I don’t want it to come back down either.
what a fight around 11k
[deleted]
I literally got home from work after planning to buy some today and I literally bought the peak. Unreal. The second I bought it starts crashing. Doesn’t matter hodl til I die but COME ON. Life is stupid 
No need to panic kids. just a whale dumping his profit.  and smart people buying the dip. 
Great showcase of a weird whale selling a ton at market price instead of with sell orders, losing value in the process but manipulating the market like crazy because of low liquidity. Potentially not intentional and just needed cash as soon as possible.

Could also be someone that cashed out of alts by passing through BTC, since pretty much every alts dropped more than BTC, instantly.

In any case, it's gonna be interesting seeing how the market react. 
Hey guys, how do I check what fees to use and what fees are being confirmed in the next block? 

Looking at bitcoinfees.earn it says 100sats is the best to use but looks expensive when people are saying that 1-10sats are being confirmed. I want my transaction to be quick-ish (in the next hour or so) but also don't want to be over/underpaying.

Thanks in advance guys!
So I'm thinking about upgrading my pc and was planning to sell some crypto to buy it, what would be the best way to go about this? Buy gift cards online with crypto or cash out through coinbase? Or is there any method I'm missing.
Here's something interesting to think about

**cryptowat.ch** i guess is used by lots of folks here.

As being connected to most of the major exchanges, this site effectively collects a lot of realtime data.

Note this is a Bitfinex project. The same place where lot of folks here are talking about bots.

Now, imagine what stuff could be achieved with the right minds, correlations and mathematics behind this big data. Doesn't this allow manipulations of epic proportions?
i am checking https://lnmainnet.gaben.win/ everyday.

i see that nodes are increasing every day but total capacity is decreasing ! why is this happening? why is capacity decreasing when nodes are increasing?
Should keep the old Daily discussions so I can make fun of all the traders with their TA
If I buy a Trezor or Ledger hardware wallet, how do I know it hasn't been tampered with?
Just read Satoshi's White paper twice as a praying, put stop loss order @1500 and fall asleep. We entering a new day what it brings us will see soon
What even happened? Why a sudden drop at an exact moment? This is nothing more than a casino. It’s all manipulated.
Yawn, just some profit taking, few panicking alt coins however.
So how will EU react, pump or dump? We are waking up now. Im going to buy some.
Feels like the dips we had during the November-December ‘17 bull runs are back. Segwit support ok bitfinex and coinbase is a very big deal, people can do cheap transactions now so many people are going to jump back in. I believe this week will be a fucking rally
bitfinex+tether effect?

If 11k is new floor now im very happy. But I dont know. 
Can someone ELI5 these terms for me?

Unparsed address - 

Unspent (in relation to the blockchain) - 

Segwit - 

Hierarchical Deterministic wallet - 
Make bitcoin great again.
My tiny brain is trying to understand human behavior and is failling... When BTC was 6k people were selling like it's going to hit Zero... Today at 11.5K there is more buying happening then selling.. if today you are the buyer why all of a sudden you have more faith in BTC than 20 days ago? What makes u think 11.5K is a better investment when u could be owning nearly 2 bitcoins (if you bought when it was at 6-7K). For the record I did HODL even when it was down! 
What keyring should I get for my moon lambo?
I noticed that bitcoin discussion on reddit had become much more civilized lately but then I remembered that I just stopped following /r/btc a couple weeks ago. 
This is my new home. Just traded 100% of my alts back to BTC. 
who are the assholes that are panic selling FFS
If you are panicking right now just switch your view to the 1 day chart. 
we need crashes like this more often tbh, it make things fun!

Joining the game as of today. Starting with a small amount (0,0769 BTC). 
Now i need to learn how to get the coins of of coinbase and to my wallet.
Bitcoin is fcking dominating. Bad for my altcoins
Bitcoin rising and Whales dumping alts to Btc fun bag holder for long run 
I got in at 10k. This feels good man.
Have anyone noticed the Tether activity and 24hr trading volume?
https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/
Market Cap
$2,221,375,552 USD 
190,045 BTC 

Volume (24h)
$2,859,660,000 USD 
244,651 BTC 

Did they print more tether? the volume is more than the total market cap?

future looking pride 
I'm seeing a lot of articles today about the new Bitcoin Core client coming out, but no actual date. Is there a hard ETA yet, or not?
BTC market cap just surpassed 200b again on coinmarketcap! Youpi!
What's going on? It's dropping so fast!
Good morning Asia -.-
this 4% drop in fifteen min looks amazing
Anyone know why the market always goes crazy at about 2230GMT. Usually see a load of selling, price falling then rebound at about 2300GMT and stable?
well i finally bought big on a dip 30 minutes ago. Please bitcoin don't make me regret this.

Edit: much regret 
Welp 
Well damn :(
disgusting drop
I guess the people in vaChina wanna sell. Hate seeing 10k again- fuck it.
Red means buy more DOGE right?
Looks like it could go either way at this moment.  Going to market sell and put in a stop loss buy order.  Buy High Sell Low!
Good Morning Bottom Sellers!!!!
does anyone know when was the last bitcoin difficulty change ? and what percent ?

thanks.
A wiggle room of 1.2k is permitted
This morning it stopped at exactly 15k (AUD) and now it's stopped at exactly 14k. Why does it do this? It struggles to break into the next thousand it seems.
Back at 11K!
... For like 5 minutes
We are quite back on track, 12k till the end of the week is doable ;)
A dip at last. Been expecting this ever since we hit 11k. A dip BEFORE the down trend line or After is better than at it.
It's been 1 week since my initial investment 😬
GO UPPPP GO UPPPPP
BRAPPP BRAPPPP
I forked some of my bitcoin to alts and I just put it back in because of fomo and lost $120 in transaction fees, bitcoin is king
I have noticed many times, btc falls right at this time. This is the moment when CME market opens I think. Isnt it strange? 
Fuck this I need some meth now
Alts doing much worse. Feels good man
Massive drop out of no where.. Is that just a massive whale buying at 8PM and then selling at 2:30PM today? Anyone have an analysis of the buy/sell orders today?!
do you remember the old times?, the god times? https://web.archive.org/web/20120503224349/https://mtgox.com/

is there a place where we can point and laugh at bitconnect? 
I come from alt-land with one message: what the hell, you guys?
Red means bad, right?
Made a little "promo" video for Bitcoin. What do you think?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4StSBEyDmkw
well- if we can’t hold 10.5 we’re fucked for another major selloff.
Don't worry tether will save all
I believe exchanges are causing it. whenever the prices stabilize the trading volume goes down then price manipulation orders are being placed by exchanges and the trading volume increases 2-3x which is 2-3x profits in trading fees. They are the biggest whales in crypto market and some of them are using fiat created out of thin air (Mt.Gox, Tether, probably many others)
Anyone know whats driving the price right now?
I was just about to buy more btc but the last couple days the price has shot up should i wait and see if it dips again or buy now? 
Just keep on climbing baby..
mine is not working....dont know
The december crash actually did some good for my country's market (i think).
Back then, bitcoin price on domestic exchange is 10-25% higher than the price on gdax/coindesk/.... But ever since the Christmas crash, price is only 1-3% higher now.
Being new to investing can someone explain a bull run. Is it where the coin goes up day after day after day or is it a substantial average rise in price over a time period? 
newbie queston: [this site](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) lists fees in satoshi/byte, but the client shows it as µbtc/kb. how much should i enter there for say 200 satoshi/byte? i know this is probably a stupid question but i dont want to screw myself and end up overpaying by levels of magnitudes or having my money stuck in eternal limbo. can anyone help me with that please?
[deleted]
I know market capitalization is not a good metric for crypto, but we're less than $5 billion from hitting $200 billion BTC market cap. I think it will be a good metric for the general news media to cover and bring back more buyers.
How will the calculation of my capital gains tax work next year? I have money on GDAX and I am constantly buying and selling. Do you need to take each sell transaction through the year and add them up as your total profit? Or do you add up all of your sell transactions through the year and subtract your total buy transactions for the year to get your net profit or loss?

Why is almost every altcoin tanking? Normally they are more or less correlated with BTC. 
All my altcoins are taking a shit except my reddcoins.  Each day seems to be a different altcoin doing better than others.  I suspect everyones trading back to btc.

I'm so glad the FUD campaign of a few weeks back seems to mostly have ended, i even had to temporarily unsubscribe from this sub due to the amount of toxic threads filling my frontpage.
if prices tumble now I will smack my forehead & stop FUD stars.
For the next few hours I can picture two possible scenarios, both completely pulled out of my ass:

- we quickly get back to test 11K and slowly rise again
- we slowly go up and beat the crap out of 11.8K

Bets are open.
I spent a crap ton when bitcoin was 10 k how high will it rise?

Here come the "Bitcoin is Dead" fluff pieces and usual rubbish.
what percentage of people who will own bitcoin one day currently have bough some?
Once again my attempt to buy the dip has been foiled as I wait over a week for my fiat to transfer to gdax. Fuck. 
Long term downtrend residence vs short term uptrend support. You can almost feel the tension buzzing. 

Let the fight begin. 
If i have a wallet with a public address to pay and receive bitcoin. Does that mean that anyone can check my account for balance and transactions?

What if i don't want to broadcast this to everybody i do business with. It seems dangerous.


Don't worry, be happy.
Hey everyone, made a reddit account just now just to ask this question as it's been confusing and bugging the hell out of me.

I'm somewhat new to crypto and have messed around a little bit on GDAX, nothing too serious.  What I don't understand is every time I see this... https://i.imgur.com/6x585HF.png

At the literal lowest point of a 24 hour span, so why are people selling whatsoever?  Wouldn't you typically want to sell on a high point of the day?!  I know the joke is "buy high sell low is the way" ... but no, really, seriously, why does this happen?  And I do understand the fear of losing everything, and I can totally understand selling WHILE it's still freefalling.  But once it's reached the bottom of an arch, and levelled out due to resistance, where does the urge to "nope, I still wanna sell!" come from?
Perhaps BTC took a dive because this news about Steven Seagal's new cryptocurrency was just released.  I recommend you all immediately dump your BTC for Sensei Seagal's kung pow chow! https://bitcoiin.com/
This quite slow and steady climb is so pleasant to watch 👌😀
Bitcorn.
Good pump, now the dump 
is it true that binance is not functioning properly..due to develpmnt or .........no dont say that
I’m sure its one whale doing this. Taking profits with his ballin ass💰
Something strange is happening at $11,111. Last time it was there, it got stuck there for almost two weeks. Something similar is happening now. Anytime it starts to get upward traction, it swings back down to around that number. I don't know if it means anything, it's just an odd thing I've noticed and am not sure what to make of it.
New podcast! Crypto Sewer, check it out! Looking for guests to be entertaining and informative!

https://youtu.be/cUseemYpsQo
still looking good tho it can not always go up we all know
This is actually more healthy, two steps forward and one step back. A thousand up a day is not sustainable, remember December. A 1% increase per day will take us to over 450k in a year, which I don't think it is gonna happen. So just enjoy the discount on such days as today, if you have the Fiat to play with. I just wired 1.5k, hoping it dips even more today and tomorrow 😆
Guys! Don't worry. I, Donald J. Trump, am the whale. The best whale. A YUGE whale. Don't get SAD over the drop. We'll have the best recovery now! It'll be great!
"it's gonna break through 11.7k!" lololol
