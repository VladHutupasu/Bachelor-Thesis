Daily Discussion, May 02, 2018
Lol remember yesterday when it dropped to like 8.9k and everyone in here immediately starts spreading FUD that next stop 8k here comes the crash, etc. What’s the deal with that?  Such doom and gloom when btc has done nothing but defy expectations over and over. People in here are either bad actors doing it on purpose or are just children basically. 
My tea leaves this mornin said,consolidation is almost complete, rocket is 90% refueled, prepare for takeoff. 

I drink out of a large bowl
Rambling. I've been lurking on btc and bitcoin for a while and I feel like this subreddit tends to be more relevant to me. rBTC has more or less scared me off from contributing at all.

I've purchased computer parts, batteries and traded services where btc was a key transaction component (both direct and indirect transactions) and a lot of that stems from information I gleaned from lurking here, so thanks for being a positive influence for me. Maybe someday I can return the favor.


Slow and steady! It's been 3 months since we hit bottom. Onward and upward!
Need hookers and blow. Bitcoin, RISE!
Guys, think with me. Are we not witnessing the Wyckoff events in action?  Are we not entering phase E of the Wyckoff events?   What do you think?  Go to:    [http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart\_school:market\_analysis:the\_wyckoff\_method#accumulationwyckoff\_phases](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:market_analysis:the_wyckoff_method#accumulationwyckoff_phases)
Pay day this Friday, which will also be may 4th, should see a big jump on Friday, and likely a jump tomorrow as well in anticipation of said jump, so get ahead of them all and buy btc today, I just bought $800 worth.
This is what you call a well-rounded  argument... Bitcoin style. A proper, old-skool Twitter shitstorm

Gotta say, I'm actually really grateful there's been substantial support at 9k.
Hope it picks up soon. I want a Nissan.
Here we go ladies and gentlemen, hope y'all listened to my comment earlier and bought more while you still can
Looks like bitcoin just woke up. Rise and shine my friend. 
that was a good support line @ 9k. Time to get back on track to amili.
Told myself I wasn't going to buy any more and just wait a few months but I got a little bit more when it dipped under 9k
If you notice, anytime bitcoin approaches $9500 or close to $10,000; fees increase slowly.  If we haven’t learned anything from December 2017 and fees, we won’t get back to ATH.  Please adopt segwit and Lightning. The market will not give 4th chance.

What’s up with BCash?
Get the green dick paint out.
I accidentally bought too much bitcoin on gdax. Is there anyway that I can flip my purchase and make some money back? I went full retard on this one boys ):
Good morning all. 
Claymore, I like a lot of what you have to say but you need to stop saying “in my opinion.” I’m here to speak objectively on this matter and that may sound contradictory since this can be a very speculative subject. Are whales and institutional investors the same thing? Yes and no. There are several whales who bought large volumes of Bitcoin in its infant days and scored big. The Winklevoss twins are the perfect example of this. There are many whales who aren’t as savvy as you’d expect; they just own a lot of Bitcoin. They don’t have any connection to corporations and institutional investors like hedge fund managers, investment banks, mutual funds etc. This is what separates the typical notion of whales with institutional investors. They share many similarities and institutional investors can become whales but whales typically do not become institutional investors. Whales have been around since the beginning, institutional investors are new to BTC. When institutional investors fully mobilize with Bitcoin, we will see its largest gains ever because Bitcoin will finally have a keen sense of legitimacy. However, even today, Bitcoin is still being questioned and associated with labels like “pyramid scheme”, “black market”and “money laundering.” This is the biggest challenge for Bitcoin (and definitely not mining or hashrate as you unnecessarily brought up). Bitcoin was founded as an alternative to the greedy practices of banks and investment managers like Goldman Sachs, but it’s still perceived to be a get rich quick scheme.

Institutional investors will help bring credence to this asset class (the irony being that institutional investors are very shady people). Your remark about HODLers wasn’t necessary. I agree with you in the grand scheme of things, HODLers have very little influence over BTC’s price...but they do control their own wealth through personal decisions. Overall, you do have some good things to say; you’re just misinformed on institutional investors relationship with Bitcoin.
fun fact : in hungarian language the word "hold" means "moon" 
Switch BTC denomination to mBTC... The current state is causing price bias. That is, seeing 9000+ price causes people to have an aversion to buying BTC.

Big names really should start denominating the price in mBTC.
Looks like Bitcoin's working out at the gym for the next big match. $10k is suddenly looking like a fair shot. Other alts are taking much of the limelight for now, which isn't a bad thing *per se.* A lot of give and take between Bitcoin and the alts right now. At this rate, this rising tide just means we can all celebrate once we hit the next milestone of $500b market cap. Then it's party time going into summer!

Exciting times ahead.
**Bitcoin Bulls Seek Breakout to $10K or Higher**

https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-bulls-seek-breakout-10k-higher/

Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading in a narrowing price range over the past week, but a bullish breakout is looking likely, the technical charts suggest.

The cryptocurrency created a bearish outside-day candle last Wednesday, signaling the rally from the low of $6,425 had run out of steam. However, the bitcoin bulls ensured there was no negative follow-through on Thursday and defended $8,800 over the weekend.

While a convincing break above $9,500 has remained elusive so far, the charts suggest the bulls have the stronger hand going forward.

View

Bitcoin will likely witness a bull-pennant breakout and rise towards $9,975 (200-day MA) and $10,000 (psychological hurdle).

A daily close (as per UTC) above $10,000 could bring a stronger rally to $11,306 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from $19,891 to $6,000).

A downside break of the pennant pattern would weaken the bulls and expose support lined up at $8,490 and $8,104 (50-day MA).

Only a daily close below $7,823 (April 17 low) would signal bear revival.
Looking at all the moving averages and the recent "lower high", I'm afraid we're in for another downward correction soon.

I hope I'm wrong. I know I'll get downvotes for this, because it's so easy to downvote the messenger. I only try to be realistic...
Murica ruining the show again. Could you please not.
How good is investopedia for learning how to trade crypto? 
I would love to setup a mainnet Lightning node on my mac, but I do not know how to do command line codes, access hidden folders, or know what Ubuntu is.  

Is there a guide out there for people who aren't too tech savvy?  I know its alpha grade software and I may lose btc.
If we do go to phase E it is lambo time
does bitcoin find support at 9k?

Let's see $500 a day for the next week or two.
(((Just dreaming out loud)))
Although anything is possible.

Have a question: I just started using Armory and just generated offline address to receive BitCoin. Do I have to download all previous transaction with Bitcoin Core to just to buy some tiny potion of a BitCoin?

Another day of not knowing where BTCUSD price is going. It started well mid\-April but slowed down and lost volume in the last two days.

edit: typo
Anyone want some sats? 

Post or send me your LN invoice. Don't be greedy. Ask no more than 500 sats. Memo should be *rbitcoin*.

I don’t get why the Daily Discussion exists. If the purpose of it is to filter out repetitive content from the main page, it’s allowing too many topics to be effective. What kind of posts are expected to make it to the main page that wouldn’t be appropriate for daily discussion? It seems redundant to me.
