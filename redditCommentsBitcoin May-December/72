The two most powerful warriors are patience and time.
Jesus, just tank already so we can get going again. Frustration levels 1000%
Yesterday I just bitched all day in this thread. I was attached to my gains and tired of the bear market but as I do my research and study the space I’m beginning to feel the way I did a year ago.  There is so much happening with bitcoin and there’s so much still ahead.  Once we move past this ghost of gox that won’t stop haunting and hurting Bitcoin, we will be stronger and we’ll see greater use, adoption, and bull runs. 
We’re all fucked aren’t we
Let it be known to all, that today will be known as *The Battle for Eight Thousand*.
I just bought 90% of someone's stack! Lambo soon!
Everyone who downvoted the bears can leave excuses here:
Nobody talking about lightning release on mainnet there ?
the same people who sell at 9k because of the crypto ban on google and facebook are going to buy at 15k.


I've been in traditional stocks and crypto and have learned very much over the years. I think I finally figured it out. The market will move up or it will move down.
I don't get if Google is banning shitcoin ads/icos. Why is Bitcoin tanking?
I bought $250 for my birthday today
Good Morning 
Man, daytrading is so stressful. Always been a big hodler. But I sold at 7800 usd, thinking it would go further down to support at 7200. Of course it immediately went back up 400 usd, spiking my cortisol as a result. Let's see what happens now.. 
Damn .... I got off my flight and it's still at 8k
After completing a whole week on reddit I also learned to make predictions. My predictions:

By 23:55 GMT tomorrow (Friday) the price will stay between 7202.987 and 9632.1 USD. 

By the end of weekend: 6600-9900

By the and of month: 4400-13333

F off all predictors. Stop guessing your ass off something you cant predict. Those candles, buy and sell walls and resistance, resistance my ass. This is way beyond anyone s guess and control. 
Just bought more before the Friday rush begins 
If it goes down to 7/6K I'm def buying more
I WILL SELL ALL MY BITCOINS









joke. HODL. 
[Hourly chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/uC6OFvOp/): we're going up.

[Daily chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/xrXxWwcc/): we're going down.

My lucky coin: we're going somewhere.
Since January BTC percentage of the entire crypto market has increased from 36.1% to 42.2% (today), and prices have been bearish since. What is the significance behind this? Anyone wanna put some thoughts?
Its that time again.
I sold more than 90% of my stack. Lost a little. Will re-enter in upcoming months / years. My life is short and I'm gonna enjoy it. Bitcoin will stay. Salute.
is there a simple to install and run GUI app for macOS we can run for the new Lightning mainnet announcement?
Much down very hodl 
Well the conversation below was certainly more interesting to me that the usual Bitcoin is going to $10,000/Bitcoin is going to $6000 debate.  Best of luck to everybody.
BTC + amazing LN progress.  BTC will climb.

But much more important to me than this, - I want to see BCash stick its nasty lying face in the mud, and be priced like the shitcoin it is.  Approx 100 USD like BTG.

Sorry for the venting.

Cheers.
I bought 10 bitcoins ☺️
r/Bitcoin three years from now:
"Goodbye 90k. 89k here we come."
"I lost my family and everything I own. FML"
"On the plus side, we can soon reuse the 90k memes."
"RIP Bitcoin."
Hi :) 
Bull trap or bull run...?

Potential future meme support fuel.
Let's have a bit of hopium in this thread:
 https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/mgEMDZTa-Bitcoin-Hopium-chart/
Is there a list of all dates on which the SEC will make a decision regarding pending BTC ETF decisions ? 
Holy shit! Guys, the whales are back, but I think they are here to buy and not dump. 
Trying to further understand the actual mechanics of bitcoin (and crypto in general).  The only part of the technology that keeps tripping me up is this:

If there's no central authority governing bitcoin, how does the concept of the "private key" work?  As I understand, the public key is essentially an "address" at which bitcoin is received, and the distributed ledger creates a situation where everyone knows that address "12345" has 1 bitcoin.  The private key is necessary to spend that 1 bitcoin, and can confirm that against the ledger that everyone is keeping.  But how does a specific private key associate with a specific public address, and how does the private key successfully release the bitcoin if there's no central authority saying, "Yup, that's the right key, process the transaction."  

**TL;DR:  How does the private key certify a transaction as legitimate in a public ledger while also being private from the public ledger?  It seems like a paradox.**
Bobby axelrod bout to buy in for 300 mil

3..2..1..Blast Off!

     ...nvm
so many people sitting in Fiat waiting for that Bullish engulfing candle.  That perhaps the bullish engulfing candle comes not on a drop off down to 6k or 5k but some white swan event of an ETF getting approved or some awesome regulatory news or another country legalizing bitcoin or something and next thing you know everybody is FOMO-ing
Money finally transferred into GDAX, bought .5 at 8.3k, kind of mad I missed the bottom this morning.  Will watch the next few days see how it goes, I want to buy before the weekend asian pump.  Thiel is also bullish on BTC.
Does it rise every now and again just to make the schleps think it reached the bottom and start buying before the next dumparonny?

Starting to think this is all orchestrated somehow.... 
botcoin
Bitcoin was doing pretty damn great before that sell off. Even the amount of FUD articles changed to positive pieces. My question is what do we do from here? I am reading article that is saying miners should stop mining, people should stop buying, scam this and that and honestly I thought about getting out but just because of the SHEER amount of bs I want this community to come out on top. 
Maybe this is just what BTC looks like when whales aren't pumping and dumping? 

It's so unusual that no body knows what to do with themselves
That pump @ 10am was nice but there's been dismal buy pressure since that and we are once again trending downwards which is not a good sign. Smells like a bull trap. 
Where's the Jurrasic Park meme with neumann? "Lightning network goes live on mainnet! ....See no one cares." :(
I think we have survived the crash again. All we need now is a rumour/news, something like, Elon Musk is launching satellites to mine bitcoins in the space. To the moon!
Just cash out the enjoy the rest of your life in peace.
Can I get some good karma before the bull run? 
Maybe this has been discussed many times already but I still don't get the point: Given the idea that BTC should work as a currency, why do some of you want it to gain incredible value in very short time, and why do you think it's necessary to hold lots of BTC forever? To me, this seems to be not only two different targets, but also contradictory ones. In the fiat world, you would use a currency with a very precise gut feeling about its value looking at the goods you can buy for it, and you have lots of sources of information to see its (necessarily rather stable) precise value when comparing to other currencies. You would hold it only for the reason of being able to pay something immediately, and to keep your fortune when there is no better option at the moment. Whereas, when you want something which gains value over time, you would use shares, or houses, or rare old cars. Since I appreciate so much the underlying technology of BTC, it would be worth to see it really adopted by the public but it won't, given an average value change of 20 percent per day!

I understand that one of the essential targets of BTC is, that it must never be controlled by any institution. But, and this is what I am really convinced of, you must get rid of the soaring and the crashing, and of the daily 20 percent ups and downs.

The key question is, wouldn't it be possible to get an algorithmic solution for that stability issue?

The BTC community obviously has a lot of super brains. After the brilliant idea of implementing the LN, I think the next big thing you need to tackle is exactly this: get the BTC value stabilized by algorithms. Surely it must gain value over time when the community grows, due to the limited amount of bitcoins, but this process must be steady, foreseeable and without surprises. After you have managed that, I believe you will see lots of people adopt it as a means of payment instead of gambling, and these will then be lots and lots people who are not inside the technology but who are just using it for all the advantages it has. Smartphones are used all the time by billions of people because they are so terribly convenient, but how many of them know all the technology? It doesn't matter to them because it works anyway. I think a technology is mature enough for the really big world when a standard user doesn't need to know anymore how it works. The "user experience" of using BTC for payment must just "it's working always and everywhere", and the next key success factor is a very reliable stability of its value. 

Unless you want to keep it as something to gamble with, like betting on sports results or dealing with penny stocks. Of course the winners of this game will be at least millionaires at the end, but millionaires in fiat money, and this still ongoing gambling game will not cause any progress on the original idea of crypto currency.

Alright I’m going to pump this bitch with all of my recycling money. Hold on!!!!
Too many day traders really fucking this up. They close theyre 'positions' at night and we give them back those coins in the morning. Stop selling. Simple as that. They dont care what range they trade in, so theyll be content driving this to anywhere higher than 0.......so why not make them trade at $50k. Theyll nut up and do it if they wanna keep suckling the teet of their TA.
Good morning for the new incomers, hope you are in the little train too.
This has gone on long enough wtf
It seems no good news can move this market right now yet the first sniff of FUD and its panic stations to sell as quick as possible. 
Crazy how we speculate it will go down... in a speculative market, and it DOES 
This Bitcoin game is online since what, 2013?
Where can i find the rules, message boards (bsides financial focused like here) so i can get started.
I played a bit WoW the last couple years, but actually have very little online gaming experience.


Is there supposed to be an end to this game?

When there are huge pumps, and dumps, can we buy items to foresee such hurdles?

Obviously it takes a while to become a whale, but once you reached that level, how hard is it to stay there? Do i have to invest a lot of time to be on top of the game?
Noob tax question. I'm at $9,069 for a break even price. If it gets back up to $9,500 and I sell high, then buy back when it hits $8,400, do I need to factor in paying taxes on the ammount that I sold for at $9,500?
This just in, Google and Facebook will be banning HODL vanity license plates on Lambos.
Hope you are not all dead far on the top of your moutains holders, there is still hope !;p
Looks like a fart than a full dump... for now. Now back to the moon!
Can someone explain to me why we need to go down more before we start going up again?  
Bye
Time for the lightning network bump? 
No sell panic but clearly a lot of determination to keep this under 8400.
Wow!    that was quick!

Just bought 0.1 and I reckon that hit the wallet in under a minute!

Not traded for a while and that is radically different from the 30 mins or hour that I used to wait

Even a  Lego Lambo is still a distant dream  

Near zero buyer momentum . . GDAX
Lambos, every colour you can imagine 
I demand more FUD!
But hey, we're in the green now! Right? Am I Right? Guys?
We need to be patience. Right now all mini pumps are traps so be care and don't get caught. We need to wait until the bottom is reach and then we get in and start the recovery all together. I guess we are still far from the bottom, so be patience!
Bears are losing strength. Two consecutive failed attacks at 8k, the second weaker than the first: https://www.tradingview.com/x/O7vb6N9m/

They can't sell forever now, can they? :P This is where bulls are supposed to take the chance to strike.
This sideways stuff causes me a lot of anxiety.  I do better with extreme jumps and drops. 
These stupid little pump and dumps are just delaying the inevitable. 
Just think of this: Every time you panic and sell BTC that's a little bit more lost to big institutions who are buying up as much as possible at the moment. Goldman Sachs are publicly calling for a sell off and literally buying when people do.

Crazy how straight up devious these organisations are
The price is now around the price I originally bought in at getting kinda nervous but if this ship goes down I will go down hodling 
SPARTA we held them back at 7k, now this is where we fight!
I think it's just about to drop huge. Remind me in an hour.
Everybody ready for the big dumpty dump today? 5500 on the charts winners. Get some.
:(
Just out of curiosity, how much tax are you guys paying for capital gains?  
Sorry for asking stupid noobish questions, but what are nodes and channels?
yo guys -- where do you buy plane tickets with btc ? 
price seems to be stalbe, looking at the last 2 or 3 hours, right?
you think it will stay that way or is the dip not over yet?
just wanted to catch up with a few opinions...
Good morning fellow bitcoin entrepreneur's 
West coast signing in
Ok so who wanna revive the 90's with bitcoins official hymn? lets partyyy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlv672jqbtE
How much do a whale have to put in in order to get BTC price rise for 1 dollar?
So with the G20 coming up on the 19th what kind of news can we expect? I am wondering if there will be more regulations talked about and if the price will reflect that...
[Can someone tell me the story behind this? It happened in June 2016 and I've been wondering why!] (https://i.imgur.com/ikJcAOw.png)

Will it be possible for very poor people to use the lightning network?  Why?  Why not?
$BOOO
I wonder what Asia will say in a few hours when they wake up. Yesterday it was a definite no!
I think the FEAR gauge is at an ATH.  It certainly is for me and even most of the youtubers i've followed for a while seem fearful or basically like WTF this really could become a scary wipeout.  Perhaps this is good news 
hmm I need to check the rsi
Is there anyplace online where I can learn and understand about how the underlying technology behind Bitcoin functions? I want to know literally everything. Any good resources for that online? Be it a YouTube channel or a series of articles or whatever. 
So question...with the lightning network, will Coinbase, Bitstamp, etc all have to implement this tech just like Segwit?
[deleted]
there is a reason for this wall at 8400. which would be most likely?


Here comes the storm 
What I don't get is why the red sell orders on gdax that are further away from the "spread line",  seem to get filled a whole lot quicker than the bottom one nearest the current price. It's like the system gives more priority to orders much higher than btc value than matching the bottom order, which if done would allow the price to go up. XD 
There’s a lot of March madness go around. Could we possibly see an improvement in the technology and in influx in money. Big money?
I’ll say that it’s fun to watch lol 
More FUD!
Another hiccup / fart or is it a full dump?
Hey, what's going on with bitcoin!?
Btc was once in a funk for 3 years.  Why is everyone selling lol 
The bottom of 8k.  Feels right 
Time for Internet 3.0
The price is waiting in anticipation of the 19th
If Binance and Poloniex implement LN then what will be transaction fee when I transfer from Binance to Poloniex? 
Ha! . . the U.S couldn't deal with the metric system or 10-digit zip codes. Bitcoin?
Does anyone know if it costs anything to deposit usd money from your bank account into the coinbase USD account? 
Anybody else having trouble with Gdax after the latest page update? My price graph has stopped updating and my fiat currency now has 8 decimal places! This is on mobile btw.  

edit - it's definitely my device not the site, checked the wifes phone (same model, S7), hers is fine.
is the Lightning Network immutable and censorship resistant?
Something tells me it's going to be a boring day
I’m not getting it on my iPhone, laptop, or desktop. It happened earlier on my laptop, but a refresh solved it. 

You did clear the cache (history) right?
Been hodling since 10.3K. I feel so stupid. To anyone reading this: as soon as you make a small profit 1-5%, exchange for FIAT and then rebuy the dip. 
Whelp, there it went. :/
This thing will be approximately 9K by lunch.  It is going to be like a mad attack of zombies buying this stuff... who are all these f'n zombies?  where do they come from?
dump time?
Well,  I got my Mom  to buy today.   I'm 41,  she has an initial buy,  and is doing scheduled buys every other week.    I told her that I would buy out her position in one year if she did not like where it was at.
I've finally concluded that this year is shot for Bitcoin, no lambos this year... might be a few years in the waiting
This war is getting intense. 
Hi guys. Ive got a question. Someone mentioned to me that btc cannot go lower than 5k coz at that price miners will not earn anymore. However, the price of btc used to be much lower. So how is that possible? Please enlighten me. This is not meant to be a fud by the way. I really just want to know the answer.
bitcoin forming another bear flag?

What happens to Bitcoin if the US goes to war with Russia?
Btc is stuck in ass of someone it seems.
I’m starting to believe Goldman and all the skeptics . Blockchain is the only thing that will be proven valuable in the future, and all these coins/alt coins will go down to zero eventuallly. Who wants to own a currency that is so volatile, that when you buy it , then a week later receive it , it can be worth nothing? I hope I’m wrong! 
I cannot see BTC becoming a world currency in our lifetimes. The U.S. dollar is the currency of business and more importantly the price of oil is based upon it. The dollar is backed by the U.S. military. How do you see that changing?
The thing I keep hodling to:

Can you imagine a world where Bitcoin (and yes, I mean Bitcoin specifically) no longer exists?

Technically, I can, but it requires such suspension of disbelief on my own part that even the analytical part of brain starts to laugh at itself.

So if Bitcoin is here to stay, and every year gets adopted by more people who want to use it to move large sums of money without having to wait for their bank to conduct a transaction that "should be" instantaneous, then shouldn't the value and price of Bitcoin reflect that? Especially as it becomes increasingly finite? 

Because Bitcoin has wider adoption by general users than Ethereum, Litecoin, etc. And because it has lasting "brand recognition" I think that it will still be in the top 3 in ten years.


if the average cost to mine a bitcoin really is 8k id imagine its possible we are at the bottom here
How many times will Lightning nettwork get released? I thought it was released a few months back when price tanked to 6k. Is this a PR stunt?
Yes. Yes. More FUD! Keep it coming.
Shit, this doesn't look good. Whatever people here say, fiat is a lot more stable. 
The head n shoulders reversal is clear with wedge converging to as low as 3.3K. It will bounce back in June. See you all later :)
Fucking bitcoin literally bringing everyone down with it. 
After war peace will come and bitcoins and cryptocurrency will settle and be used and more trust will be built because of blockchain :) Or best case scenario cryptocurrency/blockchain will bring trust and peace before we head to war. Cross your fingers 🤞
little advice. its not coming back up. Sell or lose it all.
Guess all the dumb asses with 4k 5k and 6k predictions didn't buy any at 7.7k...already made $600 per btc on my lowest buys, all i can say to you fomo people is ..i..
[deleted]
lol the dow is also a couple of points higher. This cannot be a coincidence
Anyone want to give me some motivation to hodl pls
Bear trap?
[deleted]
Come on bitcoin hit my buy order. Stop teasing
Ill be the first to say it - I think we bottomed. 
Damn will this puke already . . why are people buying now???
[removed]

We need the Fed to save the market
Why are Americans so quick to support bitcoin when Russia and China are such major players? The US has benefited for decades with the influence of USD throughout the world. If bitcoin actually became the currency of choice, Russia and China would potentially control a larger share of the worlds wealth.  I understand why speculative individuals would have a selfish desire for increasing bitcoin relevancy, but what are the actual likely outcomes for the US economy with large scale adoption?
Going back down to below 8k
I think at the 6k level with bitcoin... day trading is profitable... you can buy at night dirt cheap and sell durning the day...
Couldn’t be done if bitcoin value was  below 1k.... 
get use to the new bitcoin trading ... hodling is the old way....
Sorry if I offended anyone...
