*weak hands shakedown - OMG PANIC SELL AT 7900, 
5 minutes later.. oh its going back up *buys back in a 7950*
Don't panic sell you 🐱s
The bottom was Feb 5th. That was more than 2 months ago. Onward and upward! 
Mcafee is almost in the "no eat" zone again.

There's so much pressure on the buy side of the book, doubt this is going to last very long...
Just bought another small chunk. You may rise again now.
So here's a question. Is there any standard measurement/landmark to clarify at what point a bull-run can be declared (before a peak of course) people keep mentioning it. 

 I'd be just as happy for slow, long term upward drift than a quadratic spike, but at least bitcoin isn't falling fast anymore! 
All the TA guys I'm following on tradingview are suddenly very quiet... hmmm...
Anytime theres a tiny drop. everyone panic sells. 
Ok there was the anticipated big dump.  Next step we climb back above 8k and beyond! 
One thing I have not seen much of here, is discussion about BTC derivatives.  The turning point for BTC, as I see it, was when the authorities approved BTC for derivative trading in December 2017 (link below).  Unfortunately, and fortunately for some, this gave speculators the ability to sell BTC without holding a single coin (also known as short selling).  This happens in stock markets all the time where the price is driven down not by the lack of buyers, but due to the sheer volume of derivative sellers.  You can easily find those stocks that are heavily shorted and it ultimately puts pressure on the sell side driving the price down further.

We are now in April 2018 and BTC is trading at 40% of its all time high.  This is not due to lack of buyers IMHO but simply due to the volume of sellers, specifically on the derivative platform.  Think about it, what better way to make money other than sell an asset that is trading at an all time high as there is large potential for a massive sell off.  This is why we have seen massive sell offs with BTC after periods of large gains such as, $19.5k, $17k and $11k. 

So the price of BTC is largely driven by the volume of short sellers, not the volume of long term buyers (eg; Hodlers).  Now my thoughts are that sellers are running out of steam and there is largely more upside at current prices than there is downside, this could mark a significant change in sentiment.  Not to disregard that prices have also somewhat plateaued around the 6000-6500 mark.

This is either a turning point where those derivative sellers become buyers, or continue to sell knowing that the lower the price goes the more risk there is of potential upside and that short trade being stopped out.  Sideways trading is always a good signal that sentiment may be shifting and yes we had some sideways trading recently (31 March to 11 April) which was followed by a large swing upwards. Long, boring periods of sideways trading is what BTC needs people, the more this occurs the greater the potential for upside and the greater the potential for a return of the bull market that we all are eagerly awaiting.

It's preparing for a bounce to 9k
I think the plan is to hold $8050 until the American markets get going.
Oh 8000, you're a sight for sore eyes!
Bitcoin over 8000. Things are looking up. 
Uh. Mercia. What we doing here. There's oil at 20k let's go
[deleted]
I guess btc is on the rise again :) 
Under this kind of market which can be heavily affected by unreliable news, 4/17 could be disastrous.
Whoever wins this fight at 7800 it will breakout that direction hard

Hey i was kinda right 
I love the little fudsters on here with little baby balls who start crying and cheering dips because they couldnt find those little baby balls to buy at the dip. At this point i get more joy watching you cry and buy late then making money. 
Just bought another 3 hundred dollars of bitcoin, that next big green candle is on me.
Holy shit what the fuck is going on? I woke up with new inspiration and motivation, ready to change my life, and then I decide to check coinmarketcap again feeling for old times sake feeling invincible and see BTC 8.1K WTF! THE HYPE IS BACK! GET READY FOR OVER 9000 MEMES! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT!
We may possibly be seeing a little bit of a breakout happening. Maybe.
Here we go! To the moon!!!
Was waiting for today(payday) to buy $1000 worth more of Bitcoin but of course it goes up a bunch, and every time I have bought in the past it goes down. Should I still risk it and buy at current price? 
[deleted]
Probably going to settle 7900-8k for the weekend
ouch, everyone's stop sell orders going off
**Come On Bulls!**
lol the market is just trying to deceive us in the short-term. Been through this way too many times now. It still scares the ball off of me tho. Feels like my soul is being chipped away 
Noob here. Can anyone explain why the other coins paired with USDT crash and spike with BTC? Just can't seem to understand this..... 
i missed the dip
War bounce?
First comment!
I hope the run continues. Nice to see it crack 8
According my TA, Tea-leaf Analysis, Bitcoin is going to do whatever the hell it wants. 
**Come On Bulls!**
I have to accept I only like big price fluctuations no matter up or down. A stable price for a couple of hours gives me convulsions. 
I really fcked up yesterday trying to be a smartass

Bought in last week at 5449 euros and sold yesterday at 5915 euros thinking it was a pump and dump during the 'happy hour'

Totally fell for the FOMO - I know this is scant consolation but I have not lost any money yet in my careful buying and selling just taking small gains here and there

Ok so what are my options now, would you wait for a few days or buy atm?

Have about 20k GBP good to go

And yes I know I am a fcking dick
**Bulls, keep your eyes on the game, there is still a lot of work to do.  Many thanks.**
Ok boys the weekend is upon us. It’s been a while, but I’ll be dusting off the ol’ balloon 🎈 and we are getting ready to make our way up through 8000-9000 feet altitude zone.  With any luck we’ll float above 9k in due course.  Come fly with me. 
Keep an eye out for active users in the sub. Every fucking time the active users go above 10k the price of bitcoin jumps wildly or crashes. I’ve been watching this since October. Earlier the price was $8200 with 6000 users here then it went to 11000 and the price fell to $7800 in 15 minutes. 
It was the exact same when it went from 12k to $6k and every other time between. You’ll also notice a massive spike in users with fresh accounts under 1 month start active posts or comments that try and create fear or attempt to shit on other users for asking questions. It’s as if a massive group of people are actively trying to manipulate the current price or Bitcoin. Who coulda seen that coming... 
Sorry for the noob question but is this a good time to buy reddit gold?
We need to break $8,246.61 to get back on track. :-)

https://fnordprefekt.de/
when tax season ends? 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3L4YrGaR8E4 
Almost bought $8220.
**Another push from The Bulls!**
Have no idea how it's could go up for 1k within 1hour without no reason. Some big animal had to buy a lot. 
If I withdraw bitcoin from my bitcoin wallet, is the withdraw-transaction recorded on the blockchain?
lol bitcoin doesn't want to go down... 
I'm a little concerned with the weekend though....Institutional investors dont trade on weekends. We need a little friday night pump to keep the party going
Had to sell @6600€ 

Lets see where it goes next
Is it better to consistently sell at highs and buy lows, or just to hold at a decent price?
I wonder where I can borrow $8k from.....
My goodness you guys are negative. Did none of ya'll see this coming with a very high 4hr RSI? Of course it's going to dump. 
[deleted]
Im waiting for 10k$ till then Im not getting excited. It might be one big bull trap. Please don't downvote me, its just my concern. 
This is the bart chart, we all knew that, i'm expecting for a real bull run between june and october and then i'm pretty convinced that we'll get the 35k, still just be patient, it's pretty reasonable that drops maybe to 7200, and is still better than 6800... Btc growth like that, jumping and dumping... one year ago we were close to 1000. Nothing else to say.
If the price stays above $7800 for the next 30 mins. We will have the first full candle above the downtrend in the 4h chart. This would be a very bullish sign.

Just read a story in the Independent saying an Indonesian Islamic scholar has declared bitcoin Halal. Maybe that's influenced the price increase.

Dumping 
[deleted]
The Bulls could smash this back up to $8200 easily. 
Going to sleep, it better not be less than 7900 when I wake up in 7 hours.

(This means it will probably be like 6k considering my luck with this shit...)
I can feel it coming in the air tonight. Yeah. I said it 
**Support The Bulls as much as you can folks.**
I know I'm dreaming but it would be so nice to see volume at 100,000 on GDAX and the price shooting up to $15k. 
I think we could easily hit 9k today.   Just one of those trade mark long green dildos and we're practically there.
I've been watching [this](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/YRZvdurN-The-target-of-current-bubble-lays-between-40k-and-110k/) chart since November. I know that TA with bitcoin is speculative at best but it's uncanny how closely the price has been following the prediction. 

If this upswing continues, this guy will be an absolute god.
Meanwhile, over on the naughty step:

* Someone is trolling Bcash, and doing rather a good job:

* https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8bzdyc/bch_needs_to_rise_24x_times_just_to_get_at_the/?ref=share&ref_source=link

* A post with a lot of caps, which the Bcashers rather admire:

A plea.  

My team and I visit r/btc to keep you informed.  It is hazardous to mental health.  We seek no recompense, but ask that you donate your shitcoins to any suitable charity that will save the babies.


I knew I should have bought a little more at sub7K prices, but I am also glad I didn't because the price jumped. 
Still a lot of hard work to go.  
This is a bit embarrassing, but I have a BTC balance on an opendime, I know the address of it but I don't physically have the device on me. I'd like to check the balance. Could someone please refer me to a service where i can do that? Thanks in advance
Would anyone recommend consolidating investments to bitcoin or is it worth having a spread of crypto? 
Please stay above 8k :(
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooo !!!

:)
Uh oh, on its way back to lucky 7;) Grizzly attack for now. Thursday morning wasn’t fair
Ohhhh noooo. Lol. Zero percent 
[YES!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etnUCvuADoM&sns=em)
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

8k who??  👀
Will this hold over the weekend? Or dip
Can we crush this wall at 8050?  
my technical analysis shows people really have no fucking idea what the price will do
[removed]
lets go dump just started 
I'm guessing obviously but that could have been a big player selling a load to get some money to pay his taxes, hopefully just a small blip. 
Man is there a great wall at 8200 or something?  I think is super important to stay above 7800, this is our safety net before going much lower.  If we can go sideways here, I believe we will gain momentum and try again 8200 again.
Biz down?
Here we go again, weeee!

Feels like riding a roller coaster.
A little Friday the 13th Bitcoin Price action analysis for anyone interested!

lambo, lambo, moon, moon, ra-ta-ta
Why did the price go up about $1,000 over the course of 45 minutes a day ago????!!!!

Who did this? What are their intentions? 

They obviously wanted to make a point or they would have done it quietly. This is a pump, but will they keep pumping??

There's evidence that the dollar value of the pump is equal to the amount of Tether moved around in the official Tether team wallets.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPu9i2ICdfI&feature=push-u&attr_tag=NYlEtj0p1qfahSQC-6

I'm not saying a pump is bad... we need it. But was is their end goal? 
Adoption is more important than price.
I think by now most of us can agree that there’s a lot of manipulation here. So ta is completely ineffective imo
Bears are coming.

hey guys,

just fund this chart about BTC/USD https://de.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/Wu3tZzYV/

What's your opinion about that?

Good trades to everybody
It's Friday the 13th, the last business day in America before taxes are due, and bitcoin crashed hard at the very end of the tax year, WHAT COULD GO WRONG?

Whales don't manipulate the market they manipulate the people, feel sorry for people that are buying right now shoulda bought the dips.
BTC gettin the toilet paper ready again.

Here's the bounce back to $8200!!!
Annnnnnd here come the fresh alt accounts to try and downvote or spread BS about how I’m wrong... you’re right guys no market manipulation at allllll
So much for 8k. Back to 6k by the end of Sunday. 
[deleted]
YAY. WE'RE GOING BACK DOWN. NO. SUPPORT.
6.5k again this weekend
How does a wallet work? ELI5?

I assume I buy it, it somehow uses a usb cable or wifi to connect to the internet, and then I provide some kind of code to Gemini, like an account number? And transfer my bitcoin to this electronic device? Then what happens?
Here comes the morning dump. Hopefully it's minimal and 8K can hold 
up or down?
They would just not let it go up.. fre** bears and our tether bois
This looks like a normal price increase now, The Big problem is what caused it isn't normal
It will make me understand why selling an asset like bitcoin. If you need your money put it under your bed.
So, if I use Gemini, how trustworthy are any of these services? $8k is a lot of money to invest.
Fresh new analysis about to begin for Friday the 13th!

Open discussion format with a focus on BTC.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP\_\-1lE6uu0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP_-1lE6uu0)
bitcoin needs a higher high or people will start panicking 
Bitcoin is pure manipulation, if you have bots you have manipulation.
Welp, looks like holding 8k may not happen. Plunging fast now. Weeeeeee
