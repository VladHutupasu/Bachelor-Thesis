Daily Discussion, May 13, 2018
Remember when people were complaining that $100 was too high for Bitcoin? Then it went to $1,000. Remember when it dipped back down to $350 and everyone thought Bitcoin was dead? Then it went to $20,000. Remember that time it dipped to $8,000? Oh yea, that's right now.﻿

Suppose you are in a mining pool with hash power α relative to the entire bitcoin network. Suppose that the difficulty is such that it is expected to take β hashes to mine the next block. If the difficulty of mining a share in
your pool is γ, answer the following questions in terms of α, β, and γ (the mining reward is 12.5BTC):
(a) How many shares is your pool expected to “mine”? 
(b) What is the expected reward for your pool?
(c) What is the expected reward per share, if 99% of the reward goes to those who mined shares?

I sold out for $8300 a couple of weeks ago and regretted it.So obviously I'm hoping to get back in sub $8k.It looks like it could be a possibility in the net day or two.You can't predict this stuff.
