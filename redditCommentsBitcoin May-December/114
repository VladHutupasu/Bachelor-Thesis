If it stays green most of today and tommorrow, EAGLES WIN.  Stays red and starts dipping hard, PATS WIN.  Plot twist:  crypto predicts the future.
This dip is a good reminder that Bitcoin isn't easy money. 

People think that is just bought some Bitcoin and become a millionaire next day. 

No people, easy money doesn't exist. 
I have been into BTC trading only since Aug of 2017 and been through the couple of scary dips so far. All I know if for sure that not a single soul on this reddit knows what will happen tomorrow or Monday be it a bigger dip or rise past 12k.
Everyone remember: Most people making "predictions" are actually trying to influence the market one way or the other, rather than sharing any real insight. Make your own decisions! 
For those trading or monitoring the BTC-EUR pair, here is a chart analysis I made for Bitcoin vs Euro trading so you can identify the trend, support and resistance lines: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7uz7kw/btceur_bitcoin_euro_chart_analysis_feb_3_2018/
If you are worried about price just remember the hard work of figuring out scaling is happening right now and folks are EAGER to participate:

LN may not be perfect but people are passionate about proving its worth. This alone is such a strong signal IMO.
E-A-G-L-E-S!
What everyone should know including the guy who just posted "once it goes to 10k it'll drop like a stone". Just realize that you cannot predict Bitcoin's price based on historical data or any type of technicals. Don't be fooled by previous bitcoin drops/pumps. Each time is new in its own way. We have never had such a massive drop dollar wise speaking, forget about percentages for a second. This is unchartered territory and no one really knows. I'm making a somewhat informed GUESS that it will go up, but in reality no one really knows, especially the people saying it will drop once it reaches x y or z.
I guarantee Bitcoin breaks 10k+ plus today and does it easily.

Here we go again
when you want to puke on your shoes in the morning, you buyy
Not the correction we deserved...but the one..that we needed!
If stocks continue downward trend next week, and btc stays sub 10k, thoughts on investing in silver & gold?

Remember y'all, the product hasn't changed. Just because Bitcoin is down in value, it doesn't mean the coin has lost features.
Gotta make it past that massive 200 + sell wall at 9500

Can anybody please explain why text posts are not allowed anymore?
bitcoin is a wild ride 
It's holding up so far so good
A bulltrap?!?! I refuse to believe!!!
Any predictions for btc price? 
someone explain the point of having more than a couple different coins like more than 5? (I realize this is the bitcoin page so if this is not the place tell me where to go)
Bitcoin $6k. It might settle lower than that even. For those of you who have never monitored stock tickers this may be new to you. Whoever sold Bitcoin down to 10k has now been arbitraging for over a month now. First from 10 to ~14k and now from 8 to 9k or from 8 to 10k which is a greater percentage than from 10 to 14.

Expect maybe one more round or this last $9k pump to be the end of the day trade pattern. It will then trickle down to $6kish or below while the most clever traders are done with their risks and as the noobs here are done being burnt buying at their $7k-$8k "discounts".
Is this a bull-trap?
tbh if you missed out on the rise it's better to wait it out and don't buy during the hype
Release the fomo!!!!
Wonder if any superbowl betting will be done in bitcoin.
Bitcoin had died. Bitcoin had risen. Bitcoin will come again.
Anyone else having their entry pins on coinbase being revoked or taken away? Its like they just dont want my account to have them
I have never purchased bitcoins before...can anyone explain how it works?
Anyone know the best way to deposit into bitstamp? Credit cards were declined for some reason.
I just came back from a hiatus and am happy to see that the fees are back to normal :)
Calm down guys, please dont do panic again. Will drop again? Yes... but its normal. Be patience... we wikl see a lot of drops for more one or two months and then the big pump.  Just hold. Trade is not recomend. 
I’m going to go insane if we are on our way down again.
looks like we're forming a handle
What’s with the influx of shills lately peddling their shitcoins (particularly BitcoinCash and Ethereum)?

 Are they really so pathetic that as soon as they see the price drop they start their “omg bitcoin is dead!!11” drivel?
It's >9000!  
4chan throwback, so embarrasing
Anyone know when the subpoena for Tether is supposed to take effect? I know it was issued in December but when will any more news come out about their audit?
I think there's no point of hodling, just accumulate more and more but low sell high
Reliable sources have confirmed that BTC will go back to ATH on monday

Source: just sold the last of my BTC contract payments
HODL boys
So glad I bought $10,000 at $7,850.
**BLACK MONDAY** Stock Market Crash, it's going to be bad, really bad, the only life boat will be Bitcoin.
It's over 9000!
Is it possible to implement chargeback/txs reverting for a fully decentralized system?

If no, I dont see how fully decentralized system can be adopted worldwide. No money system that does not back up human factor at all can be widely adopted, right? Or human greed will do?
I have very little Bitcoin mostly altcoins like EOS but I am 100% sure Bitcoin will be at least 75,000 this year
So I bought £500 of bitcoin just now, lets see what happens.
IT'S OVER 9000!
Is the Rekkining finally over???????
I just love to HODL and dream of 2020 $95.000 and then I cash out my lambo dream. Let's dream on dudes to the end of the sky 🤑🤑

The Stock Market May have PEAKED. Bitcoin looks like its BOTTOMED.  Would love to see all the nay-sayers start getting REKT'd in traditional markets.  Especially people who called me an Idiot for buying bitcoin.   
Dead bounce cat? what do you think?
If someone were to invest some throw away money for fun, what do you think would be best? Throw it all into Bitcoin? 70% Bitcoin and 15 in two at coins (which ones? Electrum? And?). Good places so learn more?

So why is BTC rising today?  I didn't see any specific news.
General question:
Why are analysts predicting the longterm growth of Btc ex100k/coin,  even if the btc is proven to be slow in transaction speed and its lack of functionality compared to other cryptocurencies?
hate me if you want but i made so much free btc on the way down this week. Glad its going back up so i can stop staring at the computer all day
Looking for a bitcoin friendly bank or credit union in the DC/Northern VA area. Also looking for lists of crypto un-friendly banks and business generally. I'm at bank of america now and I'm looking to make a change. Thanks for the help!

I made a little sold it gained more then I thought. Looking to buy again but also know it may crash to the point people jump ship. Its sad I hope it can recover. but things like this no one can tell the future.
Has anyone has done some blockchain analysis to see if most of the bitcoin selling is coming from one or two addresses and who they are.
There isnt enough of a sell order book for that whale dump and buyback schemeto be happening.

There is an extremely thin sell order book right now. Very very low volumes.
These sales are some few desperate people dumping at any price for some reason. I am guessing its some people who mortgaged their house to buy bitcoin at $15,000 and now simply have to get out at any price.   https://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bitstampUSD/accumulated_orderbook.png  thsts tje love link. Hereis a screenshot http://archive.fo/4lGGs/image

Either they need to finish selling or they all need to stop selling so prices can recover.

This is why people should not borrow to buy crypto

Or maybe its margin calls
Ive noticed crypto goes up more weekends when the us markets are closed. 

Been doing this 5 months, still hodling but wary.
Keep your ears to the ground, people. Enemy FUD cannons are being loaded ... 
The bear is back again its starting to go down. The dip is on. Yippee glad I sold 2 hours ago now I am buying back. Just love the game. Let's make the move and get the lambo or maybe I have to settle down with a pair of shoes?

It's climbing again. 

People, you gotsta gotsta have faith!

I see green
So I have a few questions about the sudden increase in bitcoin price on Feb 2. (See https://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bitstampUSD#rg60zig1-minzczsg2018-02-02zeg2018-02-02ztgMzm1g10zm2g25zxzvzcv).
I was watching the chart, media and social media closely that day. Before 1 pm there was a general feel of despair with a lot of people selling in panic or having lost great sums already by gambling. The price was going down constantly. People were hoping for a wall at 8000 but that wall didn't come at all. Panic was ensuing even more.
Then suddenly - boom. Within 10 Minutes the price skyrocketed. In the two ensuing hours around 150.000.000 dollars were pushed into the market (roughly 17.000-18.000 bitcoins).
What did happen there? Classic well coordinated pump and dump (or just pump?) But why did the price staid stable after that? Some really big whales performing a perfectly buy and sell operation. But what for? If you invest such huge amounts of money you don't care about the project bitcoin - you want to make more money somehow and that was a huge gamble at that point if they didn't knew something we don't... Any ideas or explanations?
Bitcoin today!!!!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGrk8nolRJU
Segwit transaction with 2sats made it in about 1 hour. 
The hype bubble popped. But the ride ain't over yet
Time to smash this massive wall at 9500 guys. Buckle up.
Ah. Yeahhhh! Break through those sell walls boys. Let's show the haters and kids that bitcoin is here to stay
Those who don't buy before Ebay starts using Bitcoin will probably regret it. :)
HODL HODL, lookup german word "HODEN"

To the moon!!!! 
Be carefull of the soon fall..Like already said before here, Monday will be a big fall, be sure to seel before it.
If you haven't sold your Bitcoin you are in denial
If you guys think that once this thing hits $10k there wont be a major sell off your just fooling yourselves... we have a long way until we start to see actual gains again.

EDIT: *actual gains

Edit 2: apparently I don’t know shit
I’m strapping myself in tight. I’ve just put 0.5 bitcoins fuel in and I know I’m heading to the moon via a stop at $20,000 first. See you in my Lambo this time next week.

That’s right, bitcoin is coming back up!!!!
Technical analysis demonstrates a return to 7500 levels to test resistance in the next 48 hours.  Which way from there, we will see.  Compounding at mid 7's highly likely.

Greeeny greeeny above 9000 :) for a while :D

How about this analysis .  Bitcoin/Crypto gets mentioned during Superbowl either via an Ad, a broadcaster or during Halftime show
Back above 9K!  Seams like it's just a temporary downturn :)
