Woke up feeling bullish, bought 1BTC this morning.....next stop, Lambo dealership.
Wake me up inside 
How many times do we have to pump and dump up and down $200
How low will it go? We don't know! Especially John Snow. 
The India news barely affected price, because this has happened many time before with many other countries and it all amounted to nothing 
I bought at 17.5k and sold at 8.2k, AMA
Do you guys think the mods on this sub are all millionaires from Bitcoin?
This is a great perspective for those of you that haven't seen it yet:

if India can come out and say they are official banning virtual currencies and the price doesn't budge I think we are at or close to the bottom. usually something like that would cause at least a 10% dip.
These pumps are pathetic. Canâ€™t even get to 7k anymore.  I miss the good olâ€™ fashion 1000k swings. At least there was more excitement. 
Yikes. 
:/
Bitcoin is going through chemical castration which is slow and painful. 
Just exited from all crypto.. ðŸ˜£ from India

the spring could be springing again soon.  PAY-TIENCE
There seems to be a brickwall around 6600.

Edit: ... aaand it's gone.

How deep into the rabbit hole do we want to go?
Those GPU mining might start looking into alternative sources of income such as deep learning like https://vectordash.com/ not sure how taxation on money earned would work here though compared to crypto. I wonder how this would impact crypto prices.

Indian residents can no longer purchase cryptocurrency through their bank accounts, according to new measures adopted by the countryâ€™s central bank.

https://www.ccn.com/india-bans-banks-from-processing-cryptocurrency-purchases/
Friends I am sorry to being out the news --
India's Central Bank today barred any banks or financial institutes to offer financial services to crypto exchanges !! 

How to go about it ? I am firm believer of blockchain tech and financial freedom but when there won't be any btc to fiat conversion then the prospects will diminish in short run.

What do you suggest , how to go about it?
The one thing I don't see people mentioning here is that the current price is just a natural conclusion to a parabolic move. Bitcoin's third. 85% drop from the high is to be expected, which is at $3000. So Bitcoin is holding up well. 

Every single time it took out the previous high after such a move it was a 1000% or 2000% plus gain, so next target is actually $200 000 to $400 000 or so.  

It might take a while to get going but this is definitely where you want to be buying a wide spread of crypto's. I think the lows are in, just a question of time now before the up trend resumes...
So in this week end BTC price would drop to 6K?

I don't think so
Bloody hell!  When are we going to get some good news?  Just seems relentless at the moment, everyday there is something to put a spanner in the works.  
B-Trash down to only 5% of the relative hashrate according to fork.lol... when 51% attack?
Do what you want bitcoin! Iâ€™m not afraid anymore, you hear that? Iâ€™m not afraid anymore!
That amount of open shorts... Market about to punished them.
Back to normal or lower.

I fully expect the DDS (Daily Dick Sandwich)from India today. How low can it go?
Kay Korea, take it from here!
Down 270 on that last 30 min candle .... big volume
Spanish tax authorities seeking names and bank accounts of crypto users .... FUD, sure, but not that big a FUD I think .... 
I think this is Bitcoins current pain...self inflicted of course, but I would guess there's a whole pile of very cautious people out there now. 

https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-04-05/i-just-discovered-i-owe-irs-50k-i-dont-have-because-i-traded-cryptos
A reference was posted to this earlier in this daily but I really do hope Spain seeking crypto buyer details from exchanges and bank accounts does not spook the market too much and surely how long before other EU countries follow suit https://www.coindesk.com/spains-tax-authorities-seek-crypto-user-names-bank-accounts/
So... buying the dip? Again? Getting broke..  
Who's buying in at $6k? 
Anyone have a good feeling about the summer? Like July/August, feel like with all the heat rotting peoples brains combined with the futures trading we might actually see 12k again by that time.
Seems thereâ€™s strong support in the $6K range. This type of pullback may be good for a potential trend reversal. As the fundamentals havenâ€™t changed, and in fact are stronger every day.
Thanks to one of the worst banking systems in the world, I think we actually might be going sub 6k boys.

I'm putting my money on 5.8k but we'll see won't we?
if you are down in the dumps about your holdings watch this new video By the CNBC Crypto Trader.  Awesome interviews and of course the legendary John McAfee who is confident the total Crypto market cap will hit 1 trillion by the end of this year  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hxH-wLctig
In a bear market, every time the price falls, it becomes harder for the bears to push the price even further down. Markets hit the bottom not because of the appearance of buyers but when sellers stop selling. They peak when buyers stop buying.

We have been at this level for a week now. Maybe we will see one last convulsion of the bears. But again there is a certain point that there are too few sellers. It's starting to look like we have reached this point. The general environment at lows can be uncertain and worrying. The sentiment of many people is that everyone will sell or that the whole system will collapse. It is normally darkest just before dawn. 
Lol what a panic here. If you dont believe in Bitcoin then sell and take your shitty system paper money. 
Im not a millionaire, I thought I would be by the time I was 30 but I wasnâ€™t even close and then I thought by the time i was 40 but by 40 i had less money than when i was 30. Maybe by my 50s idk - Michael Scott
- hodlgang
it is really starting to look like we have reached a turning point
I bought in at 10,700 a month ago and just sold it today for 6,830.  Need the money unfortunately. Owned it for less than a year obv. 

How does tax work for this?

Do I do anything besides write it off as a loss in TurboTax? Someone is trying to tell me itâ€™s considered income because I invested and sold it all within a year. 
Anyone read this article from WIRED? "A 200-Year-Old Idea Offers a New Way to Trace Stolen Bitcoins" https://wired.trib.al/0EEDq8W. This is like an equivalent of asking people to keep track of where their cash might travel to because it might had been tainted 1000 transactions ago and the law wants those exact tainted coins from them whether they know it's tainted or not.

I think the world has found a new drug - it's called bitcoin. Damn this shit is addicting. I'm glad I can now treat it like buying DIS, JNJ or MSFT thirty years ago; not having to look at it every day. It may get there, it may not. Nothing gained nothing lost. That is, as long as I don't take loans or sell my house over it. Thank God I'm smart and have some common sense! Ouch - this shit sure is addicting!!!
When you buy low and it gets even lower every time lol. So much for buy low sell high strategy everyone on Reddit seems to be so knowledgable about.
That was a nice dip right before bedtime, I had to check lol.
I put my buy order in on gdax for $6725. I feel like I'm yelling at my cats when they jump up on the counter as it's hovering around $6738. BITCOIN GET DOWN!!
I got verified from Gemini 4 weeks ago. Bought in at 8.8, thought the dip was at 8, bought again. Yesterday I bought at 6.8. What an emotional rollercoaster. Hopefully this pays off in the long run!
Dont worry, April 15th , we moon
Stay cool.  All will be fine.  Bcash is dying.  BTC will be 10k again shortly.

FUD has a short memory.
Could bitcoin go to a really high figure like 500k-1m? Please say yes to make me happy
what could the price of bitcoin ever raise .... Nothing.
people do not trust it anymore. trading platforms suck everyone empty and have no interest in the price rising because they have to pay everyone when they dump.
Bitcoin dies a slow death at the end
good

this hanging around 6600 is making me uncomfortable 
Welp, my feeble attempt at day trading this bitch has not been going well so far.  Already lost $600 usd, plus I got raped by fees, because I panic traded. I sodl the trading stack and will try to buy lower.  Still hodling my main stack as I think it will go up in long run.   
Escelator is going up one level again...
Price 150 lower on cmc than gdax?..never seen that
**COME ON BULLS!**
Pumpy wumpy


holy roly coaster Batman
Banned from r/btc

(instaban)
quiet day today for bitcoin
I often see traders mention strong support levels (e.g. $6.5k, $6.2k, $5.8k, ...). Where do they pull that information from? The order book on an exchange like Binance?
test
It's a bearbull market.
Well.. theres that.
So I thought that the r/bitcoin april fools joke was real until now...
I recently reinvested in alts and they dgaf about bitcoin dips anymore apparently
Any news?
Anyone fancy a beer?
The best time to Buy Everything (Tokens, Coins...)
Remember : 
What Goes Down Must Come Up
Bitcoin is not a ponzi scheme or a multi level marketing scheme, it's a decentralized peer to peer reverse funnel system. Stop creating unnecceary fud and slowing down eventual progress people. 

Big banks and corporate interests spreading more FUD so that they can short and buy back in at a lower price. Banksters know that Bitcoin will render their business model obsolete when BTC hits 50,000 and no one needs loans anymore. Don't fall for the FUD and sell them your cheap BTC. Stop valuing BTC in fiat (inflationary central bank controlled monopoly money) and worry about how many SATOSHIS you can accumulate. HODL!

At least my comment karma is slowly rising...

Edit: People are downvoting me. I guess it was a bull trap.
lets break 7k again. 

dread it, run from it, destiny still arrives
Stop panicking pussies
My 2 cents worth with Indian banking mandate and tax season this month the selling pressure will surely drive price down. The question is how far down and to what extent Bitcoin will recover. So many waiting for the bottom. Perhaps now is a good time to sell and buy back later as Bitcoin is unfortunately failing to hold above $7000 and is getting very close to testing February lows.
the banks have 3 months to stop crypto - does that mean people cash out into Fiat in the next 3 Month?
What do you guys think Bitcoin's actual stable value to USD is? 

The garbage online articles paint a picture of 400-1200

But the way things are going, and the noticably lightened effect FUD seems to be having lately makes me wonder (hope) it's around 4-6k

Is this just wishful thinking?
wtf just happened
Bring back the Bear Whale.
You're just throwing away money at this point. I have like $1000 (or less) just itching to be spent on a worthwhile investment and I don't really see much hope for making any return on cryptos cause I can think critically. If you take a look at the graph right now, you can see that we've already reached the point of no return so if you're just blindly going to believe that spending dip after dip after dip after dip is going to do any service to you, then you should think again for your sake. Do what you want to though. Your loss is certainly not my loss anyways. Lmfao. 
you would be shocked check out this btc adress guys

**Is bitcoin a decentralized pyramid/ponzi scheme?**

This is *not* FUD.  I am genuinely interested.   From what I can see, some people got rich, but not because goods and services of value were being created somewhere (as would be the case with stocks in a real company).    People got rich because others hoping to get rich rushed in and pushed up the price.   So it has basically been money flowing from the many to the few.   And now there is little new money coming in, whence the daily panics here over prices.

What do people think of the situation?
Guys please stop buying so we can get to 6k sooner rather than later. Iâ€™ve got shit to do, thanks.
**VERY IMPORTANT PSA**: Dear friends, please stop worrying about BTC price in terms of the useless fiat that we are going to replace quite soon.   Remember this is about freedom from governments and corrupt thieving banks, and about a technology that is going to change the world!    As a first adopter, your reward will come when BTC is the global currency.   You will be rich beyond your wildest dreams.   So stop panicking.

HODL AND WAIT FOR MOON SPACESHIP!    
I am interested in bitcoin, it reads great..THANKS
Bitcoin will remain flat as the fad is waning. When maximum supply is reached, miners cannot get any more rewards for mining Bitcoin and thus have to rely on transaction fees to make a profit. And transaction fees can only go up so much before people stop using Bitcoin. This is where the end of Bitcoin will be.
Wtf does this mean?

>Note from the moderators:

>You have been banned from /r/Bitcoin due to a comment that you may or may not make between now and the next halvening.

I have no idea why that's in my inbox.
Time to buy, or will this go down further?

6...5...4...
I think try TradeIO. Which is best and secure.
Next 5-6 hours going to be interesting.  Might be time to buy and ride a wave.
