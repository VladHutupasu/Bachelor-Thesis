Daily Discussion, February 16, 2018
I know it's popular to hate on Coinbase (and for good reason), but I had to sell a bit to cover rent and other expenses until I get a new job, so I transferred $2k from GDAX yesterday and it already posted in my credit union. Much quicker than I anticipated. Hadn't done anything since 2014, would have loved to hodl more.
Just wanted to wish everyone that is genuine on here a great weekend. 
= to yesterday. Up Saturday, down Sunday. Next week 13k
BITCOIN WILL REACH $11,000 TOMORROW
I am 100% accurate when predicting dips after the dip has happened. I am also 100% accurate predicting bull runs after the bull run has already happened.
When is Robinhood going live? Have they said? I'm on the 'waitlist' with like a million other people. 
Perhaps another good push to get to $10k and over in the next few hours. 
Lets hodl this 10k for a while
Wonder if anyone bought at 19k and sold at 7k? üòÇ 
20k....I will see you again, but not yet. Not yet..
Just bought back in at $102,000 after selling at $70k... to the moon!! 

I‚Äôm from the future by the way

See you at 12k tomorrow

And there it is....#$%^ lol

I feel like gamers have the edge in bitcoin specifically. It plays to the need for repetitive tasks to win at something and the ability to sit there for hours poopsocking 11k ;)
Lambos? 
Next stop: 10.5k
Bitcoin is over $10,500 on CoinBase HELL YEAH 
I find it harder to day trade a bullish trend like this than a bearish trend. Or at least I'm so used to trading bearish for the past few weeks that I always think everything is going to crash.
It seems fair to say the spike in the price of bitcoin has turned corporate attention to blockchain - but does corporate use of blockchain impact bitcoins adoption or price? 
Papa Bitcoin, where are we going next? 
IN THE NAME OF GOD BREAK 11K!!!!!!!!
Bitcoin is now at the disastrous low point it hit for a moment before the new year.
I switched from gdax to gemini. Did I make the right call?
What‚Äôs so great about $10,100 that the whole world had to sell?!?
next stop: 10.7k
FOMO just hit
Thanks in part to my selling, we've another $1k swing (up) in less than 24 hours... 9.6K to 10.6k...wow... and up approx. 4K in 10 days....with no end in sight?  Unreal.
When bitcoin gets a new boner it's the hardest one it's ever had. So the new one smashes 20K easily, and now we're dealing with decades. Still fast, but brutal. We hit 30K this year; a lot of people are wrecked. We don't care, we bang that skull on 40, 50,75‚Äîevery sexy number on the way up...to forever. 

HODL the MOON 
Better buy your btc now! I just sold so it's goin up!
First! Predictions for today?
So I am completely new to this, but wanted to buy some Bitcoin. I signed up with Coinbase (an article I googled told me it was the best way) and when I bought, it was refunded and said my bank (Wells Fargo) denied the transaction. Am I doing something wrong? 
I'm still a little confused on the user experience for Lightning Network.

If I'm using a LN enabled wallet (when they are available) and I send BTC to another LN enabled wallet, will the tx happen in seconds, AND be registered in the blockchain?
Who is selling? People that don't like money?
Hi all. Stopping by from your local bitcoin trading sub to deliver a [friendly message](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRCztgKFwR8). Enjoy!
10,500 wall gobbled up or lifted?
Wish I was greedier when buying the dip! In terms of where we have been this is still a dip though so might continue my pound cost average.
such a fast growth right now. im still sceptical but hoping the best. at least i bought more at 7.3
Got out @ 10,170 with 1% profit and I don't feel like getting back in without some proof of strength and stability. Volume is too low for my taste. I'll either get in somewhere around 9,8K if things go downhill or when 10K is more stable.
I'm starting to wonder if these predictable Friday evening pumps are driven by alcohol, followed by Saturday dumps driven by hangover :)
Just bought a bunch of BTC @ 9900 usd watch the price crash now...
Stop to worry like that, went up a lot yesterday, normal that it's moving a bit down. Have a good day all.
I logged into my Wells Fargo checking account today and noticed that they ‚Äúreturned‚Äù my Coinbase purchases last night. I made these transactions about two weeks ago. Did Wells Fargo join the ban wagon and I didn‚Äôt know? I guess time to get a new bank. Maybe a credit union. Fuck, I dont know anymore. This is going to suck changing banks. 
Can we get to 10.5 today? 
Keep hodl guys
Gonna push through the resistance area this time, pretty sure. heading 10500+
Currently setting up my ledger nano s for the first time.

Im pretty new to this. What adress type should I choose? Legacy or segwit? Ive heard segwit is better, but will it be able to recive the bitcoins i have on my coinbase account?

And does kraken support segwit adresses aswell?
Buy set for 9963 ;) g'nite all!
10k8 in 3...
Sell wall from here to 11100 on bitstamp. Gonna be hard.

What happened to that guy that was trying to figure out whether to buy or sell?  Now that we are right back where we started, I am dying to know how the movie ended.
Noob. Purchased through my Cash-App. Purchased $1k when it's 10K. 

What other stocks or investments went from 10k to 100k in a year? Everyone here is praying for a big explosion.. but really, what is the expectation, as I plan on letting it sit for a year. (and adding to the pot)
Clear bull trap, within the next 2 weeks this will drop then go up steadily, growth right now is way too fast too sustain.
Stop Spreading FUD About Coinbase: Blame Visa & MasterCard! (Most things in life aren't reversible, this is something that is.) üì∫: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLwVxnFBTng&t=1s
Morning guys. Looks like someone had a lot of fun selling last night. 
Stand by @9.3k
What exchange rate website do you use?
What block explorer do you use?
We need a groundhog day meme for when we break through 10k again. 
Up or down today? any nostradamus?
Get your 10k memes ready!
Wash, Rinse, Repeat
Someone was just selling like crazy

People who bought the dip, tell us how you doing
How do i get a bitcoin address? I am withdrawing some coins i got tipped on changetip and i need an address.
Looking good after hours 
Should I buy BTC  off coinbase or mercatox??
TUMESCENT
Prepare for some dip nearing 11k
Yeah it‚Äôs called Coinbase. 
Can't wait to sell a bit once we see a dip and then buy back in 
[deleted]
Like I was saying all last week if BTC held $8k it would break $10k.

We are at another resistance/support point again. It needs to hold $10k for a couple days to get to the next level $12k.  If we hold $10k through the weekend I see $12k early next week.
üí∏ $BTC prices continue to rise!

Please my friends, help! :-( My friend said me to invest money in the bitscoin so I buy the bitscoin with all my savings (30k$) and put it on paper wallet. Then I printed paper wallet to put in in safe in my bank but then my dog ate paper wallet!!!!!!! I already deleted paper waller from computer cause my friend say it is not safe to store privetkey on computer. I looked on google but I can't find a telephone number or mail of the bitcoin company so I can ask them to give me new privetkey to access my bitcoin again. Help please and thank you!!! 
prepare for the big bear after hitting 11k 
Wrong way!
