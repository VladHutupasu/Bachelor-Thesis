Daily Discussion, March 30, 2018
The market is timed.. the fall from 20k began on the winter solice in December. To the pagans, this day represented the death of the sun ‚Äúson‚Äù.

Easter evolved from the pagan celebration of the spring equinox. Good Friday is  the ‚Äúdeath of the son‚Äù.

On Easter Sunday the ‚Äúson‚Äù will rise from its death.
Anyone wanna start a group meet up at a bar somewhere and drink and only stop until we die, or the market turns green?
I‚Äôve had to cash out my tiny position- confidence is low.
I'm hoping that one day we actually get some people that have had years of market experience in Bitcoin on this forum, rather than a lot of kids who struggle to spell. 
Just moved from $6627 to $6628. Let the bullrun begin! Load em' up boys. 
Look on the bright side of it all, The price made 20,000 USD before dropping all the way down to the high 6,000's and the bottom could be much lower, everybody who told you its a bubble don't buy now, is basically laughing at you for ignoring their advice, thankfully not too many of you borrowed against your credit card to buy in at the ATH. I believe that some of those credit card companies charge 20% plus in interest. You now know that experts on reddit are full of shit with their charts and price predictions and even though they call this a community, you are basically all on your own in your own financial hell. But look on the bright side because now that reality has made itself known to you in such a dramatic fashion you can make yourselves feel better by downvoting this post. Oh how that will make me feel bad. Ha Ha

Bears may have still something to say. We'll see. Daily candle closes in 7 hours.

edit: daily candle closed, table updated with the new data. Note how RSI did not close in the oversold area [conventionally it must be < 30], so 6850 does not qualify as a historical "close" bottom.
Not a Good Friday.
Congrats hodlers
You have to love the chat. So many people say people are losers for not selling when bitcoin hit 20k well everyone is a loser for not mining when it was 1 cent. Nobody knows the future unless you are an insider. Works both ways. 
This is regoddamneddiculous. What is even going on? If this market is so speculative and the average, zombie investor just sells all when things start to drop, how/when can we ever expect Bitcoin to be a viable asset class much less a currency? ...Slowly losing trust in this heap of steaming shit. 
Can't afford to buy in so I'm just here upvoting everyone

go go go 
Breathing down 7k‚Äôs neck! Bull run coming.
seeing a lot less ctazy "HODL" posts now. Is reality finally kicking in?
Yup, passed 7k.

B-b-but the internets exxxperts told me that we would never see 7k again. Confused.

Nice work guys and gals.
So is the only reason Bitcoin has a slight rebound is because America went to sleep or something?

Last night the was this massive uptick in optimism and now we're back to writing suicide notes again.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
If It goes below ¬£4500/$6300 I'm going to buy the dip again. THESE CHANCES ARE TOO GOOD TO REFUSE!
to the floor!
Relax everyone. Bitcoin is just changing hands and it's expensive. It's not like you were going to spend it on anything. Close computer. 
We know this market can turn very quickly.  
*play the song "the sound of silence"
Using this dip to pick up some more btc and now I'm totaling 0.1 dead on. It's still not much, but it's a lot more than all the weak hands who bought high and sold low üëå
4H candle closed. Just pray to your favorite god that most traders follow this MACD signal and most bots are programmed to do so as they should, because if so, we're going up.

weeeeee, up we go!
I just want a good day/week/ hell glimmer of hope 
At times like this I wonder what the Winklevoss twins are thinking?
I bought the 15k rally about two months ago, feels bad man 
Relax guys just turn up some good music...

I used to think a day was a long time in crypto....ffs now 2 mins is an eternity. 
They were clearly planning this, had the reddit accounts set up to with it.
Why is this sub so afraid of any bad news or post about bitcoin? I understand if it is a troll but it seems like every post that says anything other then bullish news regarding bitcoin gets heavy downvotes and people crying FUD.
We moon now?
6k never again ?
Ayyyyee 7k!
Why do I get the feeling that Lucy's gonna pull the football away?
Looks like a bear flag.
The reason why I think the HODL meme is not great for bitcoin is that you shouldn't need to remind people to do that.

If someone is only holding an asset because of a meme, they do not understand why it has value. It means that eventually they will panic sell. triggering other HODLers to sell, which cascades. 

If you are not okay with bitcoin being the price it is now in 3,5,8 years then you need to re-evaluate why you own bitcoin
Ive updated my crash charts comparing this crash with previous crashes: http://www.habrador.com/p/bitcoin/
Where is the guy whose mom is trying to setup a lightening node because her favourite quilt store is accepting bitcoins?
Bullish!!!
Crashing beautifully today 
most people on here are usually wrong. Thats why I think today we'll see a rise in price. 
Could be worse.

7 days: 

BTC -21%

Lying BCash going knowhere shitcoin: -31%

At least that nasty shill is dead.

I take a simple view of things, being a scientist: I blame Bcash and Ver for a lot of this.
He‚Äôs avake .... load the dip
I don't know which bitcoin site i used but i know my email. is there anyway to find that website ?
i don't know what the fuck is going on anymore
Sell everything. Buy back moar at 6k

It would be truly epic if it goes down to 1k that was value in 2013.
The $6,600 wall doesn't seem to hold up. Waiting for $6,500 break, this is going to be madness. 
Waiting for $6,500 break. This is going to be crazy...
[deleted]
shit and the american trader are just to come
Keep dropping woot!!!! 
Coincidence how BTC stopped dropping at $6600 almost exactly. $6600 support or controlling forces I wonder.
wait the min guys some one just keep selling plz stop ur sell order ...this is absolutely market manipulation stop this nonsense  
Looks like the death cross will happen tomorrow...
So last week G20 was a bull trap so people could get out @9k?

REKT.
This is how this sub sounds today: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vHRMeRszw4
Mannnnnn. I *knew* it was a trap!
We were lower last month...this isn't done!
btc trading volume is very high today, 2 hours left of Japanese morning, they will be bullish on cheap price, as they love to buy dip
Heyyyy
moooon (?
Lmabos for *everyone!*
what the fuck is wrong with this fucking coin (and every other), who is ALWAYS falling when it goes up like 1-2-3k? Hate myself so much for not selling around Xmas, my 0,55 BTC was over 9k‚Ç¨ then, now it's around 3k‚Ç¨. Goddammit, I'm hodling for a while now, but I don't understand why doesn't it rise again.. or at least stays somewhat stable, so all the other fuckin' coins don't lose as much value.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil;
For You are with me;
Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.
HODL!
Logs in... Check price... Oh it's 6700-ish. Logs out. *continues the day*
[deleted]
Bounced from 6.6 to 7, not much of a bounce. Expect low volume through the weekend and then you‚Äôll see it go down to 4-5K
I feel a new low coming on!!
And here I am, not stressing. Still dollar cost averaging with each paycheck that comes in. 
Who is going to pay $20k for bitcoin? I know someone who needs it to get back to $20k so he can unload and break even. He said everyone needs to HODL. 
here we go
What did the red candle say to the green candle? everything that has a beginning has an end.
CAUGHT IN THE ACT!!!  [Actual Fudster trying to steal your coins.](https://imgflip.com/i/27gshp)
suspicious lack of hodl posts 
For those who missed 7k crossing yesterday, today you will have your chance to witness it yourself.
Just wait it out. Don't panic. Bring a towel.
And this one time bitcoin crashed. 
Come on 6 to 6.5 .... u can do it 
I believe this is appropriate for today:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJUhlRoBL8M
ohh myyy, 6890$ in one candle
at least volume is up amirite fellas 
Lower. :)
6.7 ... yeah, baaaaaaby, come to daddy!  0.2 more to go
6,666 number of the beast
we‚Äôve almost had a new low every weekend 
.#.MeToo
no pls god no nooooo that cant go lower again no
I really shouldn't look at the price for the next few days. But I can't help it...
Actually if you hold,  the exchanges will make less money and will do less market manipulation next time. Another reason to hold. 
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Really struggling to drop below 6600...must be all the buy orders getting triggered. I cannot even fathom what will happen if it drops 1$ below 6k
PLEASE! Go to 6.5k to fulfil my buy order!!!

Fuck it Go to 6.6k to fullfill my buy order!!!!
Even this guy doesn't know what to do...or does he?
https://bitinfocharts.com/de/bitcoin/address/3D2oetdNuZUqQHPJmcMDDHYoqkyNVsFk9r

The tops gonna blow off this fucker. LET THE DOGS HUNT
I'm sceptical of any rise because come 3-4 am GMT the price tends to drop. I'm not sure if that's because the whole world is in bed or what.
This guy has been great with live updates and following the current heavy "Price Suppression" trends by the big banker cartels..  https://twitter.com/super_crypto?lang=en
Maybe we have to accept that this is the price range bitcoin has settled at.  It's fighting like a champ to stay above 6500 yet quickly comes back down after getting over 8k.  During this bearish market I would gladly take the median average of 7250.  
[Lulzbot in action](https://i.imgur.com/nVaDJEE.png)
HERE WE GO BOIS
Looks promising
C'mon!!! PUNCH IT CHEWIE!!!
This is getting boring.  I think we are going to be stuck at this 7k for a long time.
Y u no Moon?
Bitcoin died on the death cross for us.

After two days it will be resurrected and rise to the moon.
Easter money coming in soon. Easter bunny told me he supports bitcoin. 


Now 7k is considered bullish? I'm sorry but this is pathetic.
I'm expecting a big bounce soon, particularly as tech stocks are currently getting hammered and I think people will be looking for somewhere else to put their money rather than ploughing it into equities as they have over the past 8 years. However, I don't think that bounce will come before we've had a full on crypto panic. The turning point will be when all the HODLers finally throw in the towel. So although I think we'll see 20k again by the end of the year, this won't be before BTC has dipped sub 1k first.
A "bounce" looks different. I'm afraid it'll go further down.

Hodl me!
**Bitcoin Eyes Bottom After 50-Day Low Below $7K**

https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-eyes-bottom-after-50-day-low-below-7k/

Bitcoin (BTC) prices dropped to a 50-day low of $6,630 earlier today, but a glimmer of good news for the bulls is that the cryptocurrency appears to be nearing a bottom.

To start with, BTC tends to reverse course every time the relative strength index (RSI) drops to or below 30.00, according to historical data (see chart below). As of writing, the relative strength index is close to that mark, at 32.00.


God I hope we have hit the bottom! 
Anyone using Dollar Cost Average instead of large investments?

I got in during the bubble sadly, and my current average purchase price is $11.3k and dropping. However, I have faith in the technology and believe it would take something like Coinbase being exposed as a fraud and going down or collaboration between powerful governments to prevent the BTC adoption rate from increasing.

Who‚Äôs been DCA‚Äôing BTC for longer than I have, and how‚Äôs it going for you?
$6000 here we come. 


*got me crashing so crazy right now...*
Lol, good job guys, you're losing all your bitcoins to me.
**Bitcoin price trading in a range below $7,000: Tom Lee tells cryptocurrency investors to hold on, Bitcoin will hit $25,000 end of 2018**

They're plenty of clips of Lee discussing his position and presenting his research. Here is a detailed presentation he gave discusses his position. https://youtu.be/GGberGnxiJk

Whether you agree or disagree, you cannot dispute the facts that he is informed and presenting valid research.
How the fuck is Bitcoin supposed to be mainstream adopted as a legit investment, taking in institutional money, if it crashes and 'dies' like this every year....?
'jmyers248'

"My favorite fact of it all is the media and skeptics were all saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs a bubble‚Äù when bitcoin originally had reached an ATH of $3000usd in August of 2017..and then we all saw it reach $20k shortly after..so what it‚Äôs went down from that. It went down to $6k in February and then would go back up to $12k within weeks and yes we are back down to $6k yet again, but consider the Dec/Jan boom as a sudden sprint that bitcoin took for the first time in years without any conditioning prior and now these downs and ups are just heavy breaths after the sprint. And the next sprint will be for the gold medal this year, next year, or someday in the next decade without a doubt in my mind I‚Äôm not saying btc will in fact be equivalent to $1million one day but I do most certainly believe in it‚Äôs potential to reach above $100k. due to the trends of it‚Äôs exponential growth in the past decade. It is an odd analogy I know but I don‚Äôt see any roller coaster memes much these days. All we await for is a brilliant mind to figure out a simple way to make security habitual and easy to utilize on a smart phone that has blockchain technology default on smart phones sort of like Apple Pay. When that day comes and consumer stores like Walmart implement the tech we will look back on these days and wonder why we even sweated a drop. And maybe I am wrong entirely but that‚Äôs a partial bit of my vision with it all."
I have no doubt this is being steered by the futures cartel especially after reading the Medium article. The day after futures started Bitcoin went south, Of course it also been impacted by Fud, regulation...ect. The good news is I don't think they can hold it down forever.
volume is low
Reptiloids want to take away our bitcoins! HODL!
Has anyone realised that they are losing so much money because they are following financial advice from some nobody that can't even spell. HODL HODL HODL. For those who held and still holding (note the correct spelling) from 20,000 USD, don't you feel like an absolute fool?
A steady spatter of small green candles is a sign of reversal here 
Just to counteract the agenda driven FUD posts here, I just want to say if I had any fiat left I‚Äôd be using the dollar cost average principle to buy as much bitcoin as I could right now.  Next paycheck I will be doing the same.  These prices are great. You know bitcoin will be much higher in the future so don‚Äôt miss out on this opportunity while it lasts. 
Every time we‚Äôre in the green people think we‚Äôre going to the moon. We‚Äôll probably see a new monthly low tomorrow. 
First time following over a weekend. Clearly blood in the streets. But I‚Äôm a bull and I believe we‚Äôre going to witness something special this long weekend. The bounce baby bounce 
[who did not listen](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/87h6qn/daily_discussion_march_27_2018/dwdisj2/) ?

it smells bad, so while we're at it, let's dip to 100$ so all the hodlers who acted all cool and shit because they got in at 1000$ so 6000 is still amazing get a little sweat.

Then we can go back to 9000 (because goku obv.)

ps: on the good side, we're gonna have new bitcoin pizza stories
I think the pathetic FUD people are hilarious, like a multi billion dollar market is just going to disappear. No, it has a massive following and a massive amount of believers who will continue to support it. Its worth what we make it worth.

They are either poor
shit traders and lost money
shit people in general
Or no coiners who just want everyone to be as angry at life as they are because they dont have the balls to HODLLLL

           wow

    much sell     very drop

       such low         how bottom

    so down
March 2010: $0.003

March 2011: $1

March 2012: $5

March 2013: $80

March 2014: $600

March 2015: $250

March 2016: $400

March 2017: $950

March 2018: $8,000

What will be price in March 2019 ?
Still keeping an eye open on 1D RSI and Stoch RSI. I'll wait for the daily candle to close [it's 13 hours from now] and see if it will close either above MA300 [~$7300] or below the mid-term trend line [~$6650], then it's either half in or all out. If we keep moving between this range I'll have to wait more before making a decision.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/15/researchers-finds-that-one-person-likely-drove-bitcoin-from-150-to-1000/

What did you do when you realized we've been in a 5 year long bull trap, separated into two sections?
Bitcoin is behaving like a slutcoin now. Sleeping with you on the first date.
I just see the coming few months as accumulation period for people who believe in the Satoshi's philosophy. If anyone feels unsure about the future, I recommend learning more on how the blockchain technology works and what it's objectives are.

My two satoshis on reducing price anxiety.
HODL right? RIGHT?
not meant to be FUD: crypto is the future, but who‚Äôs to say bitcoin will be the one to ‚Äúbreak out‚Äù? You all like to say that one day the whole world will be using BTC, but blockchain is still new. There will no doubt be newer, better coins created in the coming years. Bitcoin might not even be in the top 5 in a few years. 
Looks like we found the bottom. From now on we see a steady rise and a new rallye from august on. Have fun and enjoy the ride.
Amazing there are so many people here that are smarter than Peter Thiel. How nice of you to offer your advice on reddit for free when you could be out making billions with your great genius.
The people that are playing BTC like a casino are turning it into one. I imagine some are making money actively trading BTC, but most are losing. Wait till they run out of $ and just HODl'ers left, then we will see ATH.
We're still above Feb 6th prices... Bull Market baby! 
By my technical analysis, we will visit $3,500 next month, most probably in the start of month.
You heard it here first: The dip is over. The killerwhales had their feast. If you were waiting to buy in, now is the time!

Sell at break even after this tanking or sell after December
nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
pls dont no
its easter. people will close their positions till next week, probably below 6k by tuesday. then we will see the rise of bitcoin 
Over/under 6k before a rebound? 
I saw it dip under $6700. How low can it go before the bounce back? $6400 maybe, less?

Amidst all the panic, let's not forget: The longterm upwards trend hasn't been broken. It's proving to be a very strong support.

Having said this, the downtrend is also very strong.

In a few days, we'll see the final battle. The market has to decide then.

not trying to spread FUD: but do people think bitcoin will continue to rise just because it has been rising for the past 7 years? It's like people assume the sun will rise every morning just because it always does. There's going to be a point where the sun will not rise.
don't buy on green candle, just sell right now

it‚Äôs not going back to 11k this time. We are headed to 2015 prices. I hope most of you hodlers know that bitcoin is much more likely to be worth $1 than $100k. Call it fud and downvote if you want. It‚Äôs the truth and I understand you can‚Äôt handle it.
Btc price into the ravine again wtf? How come it is so damn weak and crumble so easily?
People hate on it way to much. Hard to audit something doing that much volume. How could you even start... let‚Äôs see what happens but it seems to be rock steady so far except for constant rumors from anonymous accounts.  Not shilling it. Have no opinion. Just wish I had used it more !

They whales buy big. Price goes up. They sell big and fast (with profit). Price goes lower and lower. They buy big again ... slowly (at a lower level). Price goes up. And they sell again. And so it goes on. In the meantime, a group of small fish also follows the whales. This strengthens the effect.
