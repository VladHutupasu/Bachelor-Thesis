So, Segwit imminent on Coinbase?
That whole BTC/BCH thing is so confusing for new users.  
Heh. Mentioning BCH first and BTC second and thus giving the imposter more legitimacy than the real thing. Disgraceful. 
Apparently so. There is no reason to trust Coinbase though, we have seen that they would destroy bitcoin in order to make more profit. Coinbase can get fucked; the first viable alternative and I will abandon them for their unforgivable transgressions
