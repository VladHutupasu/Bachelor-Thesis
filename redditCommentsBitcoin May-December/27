Calling any mods - Can you please make the 'Daily Discussion' thread a sticky.
Doesn't it get stickied every time?
There are only 2 available stickies. Daily discussion is a catch-all for quality lowering discussion and memes. Usually it is worth it to allot half of our precious sticky resources to. Sometimes there is enough quality raising discussion that we can put some of the best of at the top and let the daily discussion fend for itself. 

There is a reason the daily discussion never has enough upvotes to be on the front page on its own accord.
