It's doing that thing again 
Yey sold all at a heavy loss while it was going sideways (exchange does not have a stop loss) .. due to a family member losing his job and I waned to help.
Now I'm watching it rise .. 
While it was falling I was not so stressed.. but now I feel that I will lose out by being out. 

 
**Support The Bulls**
These "I raise you" posts have become unfunny now
"Bitcoin is dead" I'm not going to sell.
Vegeta incoming?

Its not a pull back, its all the sell orders being filled when we touched 8400 relax
all that hard work to 8400, just to drop back down ;_;

This is like taking a run up to kick harder. Next time we approach $8400 it's going to be with momentum. 
Do we need to prepare the 9k memes for next week?
Well I'm pissed off. RBC Visa in Canada banned Coinbase it seems. They flagged the website as a "gambling" site and as such refuses to allow transactions with them.

It feels GREAT knowing that I can't use my money the way I want to, whenever I want to, with whoever I want to. Nice !
I have 0.25 BTC sitting in Coinbase. 

I‚Äôve heard that‚Äôs relatively unsafe? Should I move it somewhere?
**The Battle For $8300**
put btc in front of your store free advertisement from this sub reddit.you're welcome.
That was a serious dump but the market isn't having it.
on bitmex, somebody's 4.3 million usd position got liquidated. whales were stop hunting
I am no bitcoin expert so I come here to try and learn something from time to time. I have observed these discussion threads for a couple months now. Occasionally, someone posts something interesting and insightful. However, for the most part these threads consist of over emotional cum biscuits who are venting their reasonless predictions and suggestions. Please for the sake of everyone reading this thread, back up your claims with actual evidence so we can try and learn something useful. Good luck to everyone. 
Upward action.....
We are back on track!

may the fomo be with you
next stop 8700-9200 range
Would increasing the block size interfere with segwit LN shoor sigs and other implementations? And would it require another hard fork?
upward tendency
Short term moving average is getting closer and closer to crossing the long term moving average on the 1 day chart.  When that happens, bitcoin might really take off. 
Damn damn damn 
Who fomo‚Äôd at $8,400?
lol, bitcoin did something I did not expect it would do
I am absolutely convinced just about everyone way understimates whats going to happen. But one small part of me, the old sensible part, worries that it might cause uncontrollable chaos. Because if you take this revolution to the end, it wins. And if it wins, governments will go broke I think. And if that happens its a shitfight. Or war. 
 push today to take it to around $8600-$8700

**Come On Bulls**

Its alright. Still early stages of crypto. Theres plenty of time to get in
My spider senses are tingling. Breakout soon. ;-)
Shake down. free coins from weak hands
A week ago I told everyone to buy. This is gonna run until May at least before a big correction. It's literally in the last few year's graphs.
So much positivity. That makes me so happy to see here these days, after months of hate, trolls, just random drama. I‚Äôve been with bitcoin and crypto since 2013 and honestly believe in the tech. Sadly though I didn‚Äôt pull all my investments in January and I‚Äôve been at the mercy of this market since then. It makes me weary of this bull run. I want it to keep climbing with stable numbers but I feel a bear trap is coming. I‚Äôm not sure who or what group is doing these market moves. I‚Äôve heard more and more accounts of closed off investor groups manipulating prices and banking profits on our pain. We need to fucking fight these assholes. This is our future and our livelihood. I‚Äôve also been day drinking.
Much more fun this way.
and here we go
Interestingly this pump doesn't coincide with a short squeeze.

Number of shorts is even going up...
Interesting...good time to open a can of beer. Cheers people

Hey people. I missed out on the value jump on Thursday and would like some honest advice am I not making the right calls. Is now a bad time to jump in? Is it a bull trap that will rise and fall? 
Quick question, is it possible for a blockchain.info wallet that‚Äôs secured with 2FA using google authenticator to be hacked? Cos I just saw a withdrawal of all my btc from my blockchain wallet
When moon?
wrong direction.
Did George Soros just fart?

0.0024BTC says the wall at $8,100 will *magically* disappear.
It's raising too fast , I need more time to invest :(
What‚Äôs up with the Wall Street Journal ads on Snapchat? They‚Äôre saying stuff like ‚ÄúBitcoin is dead‚Äù like WTF! What are they even talking about?  
Clean ascend so far. Let's test the 8500 and 9000 soon
Sell at your own peril. Next week is going to be a great week for bitcoin.
Time to HODL.
I think $9k tonight, have to take out $9.2k...

After this though I think $12k is pretty much a gonner. Only question that remains is how far how fast. 
What is everyones yearly salary, how much have you invested in btc, and how much is it currently worth?

Oh boy I wanna buy but I‚Äôm out of fiat for a couple weeks üò° (this is the Bitcoiner‚Äôs way of saying ‚ÄòI‚Äôm broke‚Äô while preserving any possible dignity)
Nothing like having the day's entire gains erased in 1 hour...gotta love it. 
200ema broken !
I'm hoping there will be another push today to take it to around $8600-$8700
Trump beating the World War III drums is the best thing to happen to BTC so far this year.
Weekend Gains are back wow. Can't wait til Monday, I have Stocks in DPW and BTC price affects it's price, it's gonna be üêª season opening hour lol get rekt son!
this $150 pump doesn't seem very convincing. 
I've won some money from a sports betting site but they only pay out in bitcoins. Where should I set up a wallet and how can I get my money out with the least transaction fees? They also offer payouts in other cryptocurrencies as well.
Here's an interesting article:

Seems that 8.5k is the stepping stone to 10k.
Congratulations on 800,000 subscribers r/Bitcoin!!! Next stop, the moon.
Jump above $8,500 happening very shortly.
[Going Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm84bbEkRj4) boys
come on drop so I can fill my short
for today i am happy with 8500+
I want to send my friend bitcoin but they use the Square Cash app and can't receive bitcoin. Is there a recommended bitcoin wallet for beginners that can receive bitcoin?
Again! Again!
It‚Äôs about honor! It‚Äôs about respect!

We've seen 6k, now lets see 9k. 
I wonder if all the people who are willing to "tether up" expected a lower price to get in again. 

This would have two consequences:

- They will eventually have to buy in at these levels if it doesn't get lower.

- It won't get lower, because most people who are willing to "go tether" already did. So nobody is left (or at least not many). Only holders. 


Am getting a semi about to pop past 8400
Would say it's not hard to see a continuation of the down trend, atleast up until June, at which point BTC will start rallying, maybe even before the world summit review. 
rebounding nicely
ALL ABOARD 8300-8400 resist soon to be broken. next stop 8700-9200 range. I knew BTC would't drop to 3-4k so im so haapppyy i went in looong at 6700 <3
BULLCOIN!

That‚Äôs why trump is in he won‚Äôt let it crash stupid 
Married with 2 kids combined income of 200k a year. About 530AM EST on Thursday morning  I invested into 1.4 BTC because it looked like it was going to jump and I figured afterwards I would exchange it all for Kin when it was at rock bottom I lost internet service for next 8 hours being in the mountains of Appalachia. When I got back into service I seen it jumped  way more than I ever could have ever imagined literally minutes after I invested. I'm still invested. I called a bull run 2 days before this as well seems as though that prediction was right as well.... I hope everyone here makes all the money they can because this is probably going to last until June...purely speculation though. Good luck all!

Down to 5k we go
Bitcoin about to hit the 7000's again. It's barely holding on at 8000
Do you guys believe bitcoin could be at 100000$ by the end of this year?
Looks they are letting it go until Monday
dump time already???üòüüòüüòü
Yes! We're getting a serious pullback! Finally!
lets see if the pump continues to 8,700
I think we can expect for awesome news this week.
Can I haz pump?
[removed]
LOWERRRRRRRRRRRR.
Right direction. Lower.
Look how everyone got paid Friday and how little the market is reacting; and with Asian influences this weekend too. So much for that theory. Crypto is loosing its popularity and credibility quicker than imagining moon shot's these days. Better set those sights for planets farther out. Imagine the possibilities spaceship fanatical's - Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus. Oh shit! And that's not shit for brains or common sense, respectfully. Well kinda that too.

Pump.
BTC didn't cross the 15 min resistance, meaning the trend is not broken. I am guessing there is going to be a march up. If it did break resistance, I think BTC would have continued to drop until mid 7,500. I had my stop loss set at 8099 and the lowest sell was 8100. I can't believe how lucky I was...
