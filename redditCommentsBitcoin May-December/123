Anyone just see Tom Lee on Bloomberg - Great interview on BTC he reckons BTC will take 5% of gold market/money which would value BTC at 25k he reckons it will be more than 5 also. Really good guy. No link online yet he was on show called what you‚Äôd miss  
This guy on cnbc just its going to zero. who the fuck are this clowns? https://imgur.com/a/Ilwg8

Does the fact that South Korea has hundreds of thousands of citizens waiting for banks to launch their exchanges bode well for btc in the coming month? Don't want to miss the train.

It's finally all synced up and in/out connections all working! I even generated a segwit address and tried sending a small amount to it. 

i've heard that you can link up other mobile wallets and stuff to work with your node. i have no clue about it, does anyone know? what else can you do with your node - apart from keeping it running to help the network?

edit - transaction fee was about a dollar and was segwit to segwit for anyone interested.
There are a lot of trades on Bitstamp for exactly 5 bitcoins.  Both buys and sells.  Are these related to the futures market?
*puts on very serious professional trader glasses*

We've got an intriguing escalator formation here
Super interesting correlation between google trends & bitcoin/usd price https://imgur.com/a/8vlRV

Hi guys!

What do you think short term about bitcoin price? Thinking to go allin on Tether and just buy under 10000 USD. Do you still think it will crash?

Has anyone read this?

//edit.  Clearly the suspect in question was involved with some shady stuff and if he‚Äôs helped facilitate movement of stolen coins that‚Äôs one thing to punish.  My observations are around the penalties just for allowing private transactions. //// 


They‚Äôve effectively criminalized privacy.  What they did to bank secrecy around the globe is just nuts. That every bank on the planet asks customers if they‚Äôre a ‚ÄúUS person‚Äù
Similarly they can go and strong-arm every exchange on the planet  for full AML/KYC info.  

Look how they attack ‚Äúmixers‚Äù in this doc. 

Sure they won‚Äôt be able to freeze your account anymore but they‚Äôll know how much you own and just say pay up mofo or you‚Äôll get 30 yrs for that $3k you owe us. 

As a US citizen you already have to disclose financial accounts you own outside the states.  Brokerages already feed every single trade to the government.  Soon for crypto unless something is done to protect users. 

It seems the only privacy that will ever come is with broader roll-out out of crypto as final forms of payment, right ? 

What is it any of their business what you do with your money?   What is it their business to arbitrarily decide that savings accounts can only have six withdrawals per month ?

I am very new to BTC topic but am cheering on for the People to take financial privacy back.   This whole premise ‚Äúwe gotta watch you so we make sure you‚Äôre not a  criminal and if you do ANYTHING to impede our watching of you that‚Äôs a crime in itself‚Äù is absolutely nuts.  How did this the greater populace submit so easily to this?  I mean people are installing cameras inside their homes and they would object if govt and vendors were open about the back doors provided.  And yet surveillance of your finances is accepted by the populace.  
Weiss ratings are out in 15 minutes - I repeat from my earlier posts:

Do not over-react. Weiss gives Alphabet (Google's parent company) an A-. It gives Warren Buffet's (arguably the greatest investor of all time) company Berkshire Hathaway a B.

So PLEASE set your expectations accordingly. Crypto is new and not necessarily:
- understood
- fairly valued / compared
- un-corruptly assessed
by the mainstream financial sector (Weiss included).

Please do not panic sell if your favorite(s) are not given top ratings. That would be the worst possible response and would give more credence to the old world financial sector than the new world of this crypto community.

Please be careful - remember that our reactive way of handling the last weeks (FUD etc.) has NO DOUBT made things more volatile and as a result WE ALL LOSE.

Hold it together folks!

If you agree with this please share it elsewhere.
I got in last May, and its scary how Bitcoin's 2017 chart mimics the classic Bubble chart.  Who could explain How this is not going to be the case?  I mean I feel like i had to fight a bloody war all of last year to hold on to my investment and if it goes back to 3k-4k that would be all for nothing.  I also don't see it could happen because Bitcoin is a product that has many use case's, currently works, and is being improved upon.  Where as the Dot Com bust for example, was because of too many companies that weren't really good companies yet
Bitcoin (rated C+) gets excellent scores for security and widespread adoption. But it is encountering major network bottlenecks, causing delays and high transactions costs. Despite intense ongoing efforts that are achieving some initial success, Bitcoin has no immediate mechanism for promptly upgrading its software code.

Steem (B-) enjoys a relatively good balance of moderate strength in nearly all the key factors considered along with a social network feature.

Ethereum (B), the second most widely adopted cryptocurrency, benefits from more readily upgradable technology and better speed, despite some bottlenecks.

WTF?

Does anybody have a guide for setting up a lightning node on Mainnet? I am willing to risk some bitcoin to try it out.
the Weiss ratings are being released in just over 3 hours - DO NOT OVER-REACT!!!

The problem with this market is over-reaction -> whipsawing -> losses (recently).

Check out the Weiss front page: https://www.weissratings.com/ Here are some examples: Microsoft: A Alphabet: A- Berkshire Hathaway: B

DO NOT FORGET where we are in the lifecycle of crypto - we are extremely early. So we should not expect As and Bs... If we expect this and get disappointed and sell, what happens? If Berkshire Hathaway gets a B (thats Warren Buffet's company) can we reasonably expect cryptos to perform as well or higher? No - let's be realistic.

If your favorite coin(s) is not given a shiny top rating, DO NOT sell it knee-jerk with your pants on fire.

I can't overstate this enough: we all need to settle down at the moment. This market has been made fragile by all of our own reactive behaviour - we have a chance today to try to take whatever news comes in a calm way and NOT shoot ourselves in the foot.

sorry for posting this in more than one place - i think it's important
Make sure you've covered the basics of Personal Finance before playing with Bitcoin/Crypto.

Here's your [Personal Finance Flowchart](https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.png).

Can someone pull up the weiss ratings data of the fraudulent mortgage backed securities of 2008.

I suck at google.  Aka these ratings are meaningless. They gave a memecoin a rating...

These are the same people that gave failing cdo's triple A ratings causing the 2008 collapse.
In my opinion this is a cosolidation at aprox 11.000, the next few hours are going to be very exciting. I think we will hit 12.000 today. A lot of new money is coming in today and tomorrow.

I've been taking a Coursera course about Bitcoin/Cryptocurrencies and one thing they semi-explained that I don't understand is forking. I understand the difference between a soft fork and a hard fork, what I don't understand is how a consensus is reached to accept the fork. 

For example: Lets say I add a new security feature to bitcoin and want to add it to the protocol. I would assume that most nodes are not owned by C++ developers. How do these nodes that have no idea what i'm trying to add to the protocol say, "Yep, we need to add that" and then convince the majority of nodes to accept it to create the fork? 

Is this a common thing with people constantly trying to add "features" to bitcoin and they are rejected? I'm just super confused how a consensus can be reached when the majority of nodes aren't going to read the proposed code to create the fork (Because they aren't fluent in C++ or just don't care)

Guys, anyone know how much are the total fees to withdraw   Euros from coinbase to a UK Bank Account (SEPA)
[deleted]
Two puzzling things my bank wants that is probably not a too big deal to ask about but I'm curious if anyone ran into it themselves. I was able to provide everything else they asked about (or well, I prepared documentation of the rest rather hadn't submitted it yet).

1. They want a confirmation that it's me who been in the control of the cryptocurrency account/wallet. I created a specific signed message of all the addresses I ever used in the said wallet, but I'm worrying this might be too complex. Then again they seemed to have a set procedure for how to handle cryptocurrency trades. A proof of ownership of the Coinbase/GDAX account would be nice and I asked the support for this but they're not exactly blazingly fast.
2. They also want information/proof on when the cryptocurrency account/wallet was created. Also asked the Coinbase support about this on the end due to how unclear the bank was if it was just not about my personal wallet.

Really not sure if it's just the personal wallet I been in control of they're talking about (I use Electrum now but some of the old private keys I used was first created on Multibit) or the one on Coinbase/GDAX (or the ones on the various exchanges I bought on in the past). And yeah I sold BTC on GDAX.
feels good right now
to buy bitcoin now or wait?

Here we go, today and tommorow will be probably big sell-off days (especially **tommorow** ) and after that we are on the bull run again! But be prepared for **tommorow** 26th of january
For anyone who doesn't understand why Bitcoin is still the most valuable cryptocurrency, or thinks its outdated tech. This is what make it valuable and, imho, still the no.1 in crypto now and for the foreseeable future:


1. Security. It's blockchain is by far the most secure - not only by design and hashrate, but this has been proven over nine years of attempted hacks, attacks, takeovers etc. It's Proof of Work method is well tested. Other cryptos are not trying to compete on security (they can't), so go after "fast and cheap" transactions instead.

2. Decentralization. This is one of the founding and most important tenets of bitcoin, and that which allowed it to even succeed in the first place. Bitcoin is consensus lead and has no central authority, whereas many other of these "fast cheap" cryptos rely on control by central nodes, companies etc. IF a cryptocurrency isn't decentralised, is there really much point in it?

3.  Development. Bitcoin is aiming to develop solutions to scalability, transaction time, price etc. **without** compromising the two points above. This is a highly complex and involved task! But it is proving possible, and with Segwit, LN and other developments down the road, Bitcoin is proving to be the most technologically advanced crypto out there. (Which makes sense, it has an army of developers behind it)
Current mempool is giving me an erection right now.
Square cash takes btc? Buy buy buy! 
i fought tooth and nail to hold my position since May.  I think it would be total BS if people get to buy sub-9k.  And its not looking good for you if you think you're gonna get it at those prices.  IMO, becoming more risky to think that each day
If China were really cracking down hard on Bitcoin, wouldn't NEO be performing worse than Bitcoin?

all passengers prepare for space travel
Guys, stop with the moon travel comments. Bitcoin already went to the moon in December. It‚Äôs time we go to Mars. ;)
we're on the point of the triangle..

Buckle up...
I just dumped all of my BTC and ETH. Throwing it back in stocks where it belongs.
input?
Been HODL through all this.  Anyone been acquiring more coin by day trading as it has been stuck in this 10k-11.5k range for the last week or so?  
Judgement tells me I can use this to my advantage.  Any advice on how to do this successfully without screwing yourself?
What's up with twitter? Is every single Bitcoin tweeter on vacation today?! Feels odd.
Yea I guess I was referring to the outperformance of Neo versus bitcoin being a piece of evidence Asia fears overblown. Always looking for positive signs out of Asia because could drive market bounce ‚Äî Thinking out loud, my view of what happened was:
1) whale profit taking at $20k - liquidity went parabolic so why not - whenever there are concentrated holders who are suddenly billionaires I figure some profit taking 
2) retail investors had chased the move higher, borrowed money long at 18k is ‚Äúweak hands‚Äù 
3) futures market gave hedge funds a reason to push the short trade and CNBC got on the train as they tend to w institutional flow 
4) there is something fishy in South Korea. My guess is that there was some engineering of a dip
5) that took the knees out and BitConnect imploding definitely heightens risk of SEC action. Find it somewhat shocking Clayton was focused on Long Blockchain and the law firms and not BitConnect/ dicey ICOs
6) market has traded like crap despite lightning and Davos. Whales have to know lightning is key and they‚Äôre not buying the dip. smart people like Hoskinson spreading some regulatory FUD so it‚Äôs hard to get leveraged long without a clear catalyst
7) usdcny going down fast, and oil higher so the two big capital flight markets (China and Middle East) probably not in a hurry to put it all in bitcoin 
Thinking what could drive animal spirits again, big NEO outperformance, Baidu blockchain, alibaba rumors all feel like the market could get surprised by Chinese government coming out and saying something pro cryptocurrency. Or Korea regulatory concerns getting firmly dismissed 

Just exploring the idea looking for some positivity to add 
Make a wish.

weiss gave bitcoin a C+, meaning FAIR
Why do people think Futures stopping on the 26th is necessarily a bad thing? It means no more manipulation for a bit.

Bitcoin Atom fork in 2 blocks... anyone know anything about it or should I not ask that here?
Wow!!! Lighting is fast, really fast!!

Hi all, quick question for those using Gdax.

I had a stop limit that filled and withdrew bitcoin to the USD account. I then withdrew that money to my bank account.  Is there a way to move money in your usd account (think top left of gdax screen) to the bitcoin portion?

Basically I have a balance (top left) in the USD portion, and I want it to go to the BTC portion.
any users here use an Samsung/Android  phone with  USB OTG With their Trezor?

Looking to buy a burner Samsung phone that also supports magnetic secure transmission Samsung pay. So far I found galaxy S6 is my cheapest option for MST but am wondering if it would work with Trezor. 

Thanks  
Question to settle office dispute:

Can anyone fork Bitcoin?  Is it really possible to tell how many times Bitcoin has been forked, if anyone can do it?

We are only aware of the popular/advertised forks, right?

I've seen bitcoin jump at 5am or so every morning just like this and despite good news it still steadily decreases through the day. Hopentodsy is different but I'm not getting my hopes up.

Stop the hype, Bitcoin won't go over 13k for 5-6 months. It will stay between 8-12k for a long time
Crap, I've been off doing a bit of paperwork and listening to Cascada (as you do). I come back and we're at $11,450.
