Very important confirmation that Korea ban is FUD in the extreme:

https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-01-11/confusion-korea-ministry-finance-refuses-support-cryptocurrency-trading-ban

Congratulations all who held!!!

SPREAD THIS NEWS. This could buck the trend of negativity we've had this week - PLEASE SPREAD THIS TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW!!!
Iâ€™ve following Bitcoin on and off for years but finally read the white paper and bought in for the first time at start of the dip. 

HODL until lambo or zero, baby. 
I just panic bought 1 BTC
I just sold my Wife and Kids to buy Bitcoin at this discount.
 
Bought the dip, fuck the haters 
Just chill and buy or hodl what you got...we were at 10k last week shot up to 17k...back down now...whatever...it's all normal..just know we are going beyond 40k this year
[deleted]
just bought more at 13.1k
New investor here. I just got in at $13.2k. Well, in 8 days I will have gotten in when it processes. Been watching it since December. Hopefully it has hit the bottom and is ready to make another run.
It's 4:20 in Cali and the price of BTC is 13210 

puff puff give
If this thing goes to zero so be it. It was a fun ride. But I'm going to hold just in case it blasts off to 30k just to rub it in all the FUDers. That's priceless.
[Korea is the new China](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8L5Lk98Ky0). This is a great time to buy more BTC.
What the fuck just happened? Dropping like a rock.
Mainstream media comparing charts. Bitcoin looks identical to bubble chart. Lots of FUD going around. But bitcoin chart has always looked like the bubble chart for example China FUD. Instead it blasted to new highs. 

What you guys think?
Just spent my last â‚¬15 for the cause on btc. To the moon brothersðŸš€
Do not fall for the FUD. Hodl and buy the dip. [History](https://i.imgur.com/WzkZ3W5.png) repeats [itself](https://i.redd.it/ht6aw9wafd901.jpg). Even if it were true, remember what [happened after China ban](https://gyazo.com/ca776368387f504d757f803f669a5cad).

how am i supposed to pay off my lambos now
Even when on an upward trend BTC flirts with recent lows again and again. 
the rebound is on! hold the line boys
Congratulations to everyone who bought the bottom.
KFC Canada is now accepting Bitcoin!
WILL YOU ASSHOLES STOP SELLING SO THE PRICE GOES BACK UP

edit: up 600 since I posted this so....

THANK YOU, YOU ASSHOLES.
We are in the middle of a war... too many people against cryptos. Too many FUDs.
A little bad news make the marketcap dump.
Crypto is more strong than that. We will survive.
A lot of money are wainying to join cryptos.
Just be patience.
2018 will be a great year $

That was a sharp drop on the 5 minute candle :(
So many FUDs last days... 
When the rain goes out... we will se a so fast PUMP that will scare wall street $
Just more one or two weeks... $
Buy the dip brothers 
why its going down again? Whales manipulating or am i missing something.
Anyone elses portfolio entirely in the red today? This shits depressing
The Square Cash app now accepts Bitcoin
I see alot of coinbase hate but I just wanted to tell a story in their defense. My wife's car broke down the other day so yesterday I sold a little BTC on GDAX and sent it to my bank around 10am. Expecting not to get the money for a week. My bank account received the money around 4pm yesterday. So when anyone says BTC is not liquid, I have proof that it is more Liquid than my normal Savings account which takes 3-5 days to transfer. While I don't like some Coinbase/GDAX things, this was a nice surprise.

Sidenote: I have other saving not in crypto that we could have used to fix the car. I don't have money I can't afford to lose in Cyrpto. 
Can anyone explain how my Bitcoin transaction from Bitstamp to Binance only took 10 mins and pretty much 0 fees? It has never been this fast or cheap over the past few months. Did I just get lucky that network demand is low?
Korea might not seem to ban crypto completly. But I'm kinda afraid they will put in more regulations instead.
Everybody talks about FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) like it's a bad thing.

If you are a seasoned investor you live the FUD; You ought to.
[LIGHTNING HERE BABY !](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*sWxRdp4IioymKlyyfy723g.png)
today taught me the power of FUD
Is this dip really anything except for whales constantly manipulating the price? If you check BTC/USD on GDAX there are non-stop fake buy/sell walls, probably the same elsewhere
If anyone is wondering why bitcoin won't stay above $14000, I had a buy order placed the moment it dipped below that number. And, naturally, I'm not supposed to actually make money in the crypto market. So this one's on me. My bad guys
the last six months have seen the most significant sustained attacks on bitcoin since its inception

constant FUD, combined with "fear I've missed out so instead I'll get on the ground floor of an altcoin", combined with multiple forks

if bitcoin can weather this storm and prove itself more resilient than ever, sky is the limit
Plays on Bitcoin in the equity markets are out there for the taking. Long Island Iced Tea renamed themselves "Long Blockchain" and tripled. Kodak announced mining machines that you rent and they get 50% of the coin mined, and they tripled.

Riot, a company that had nothing to do with blockchain and had made 3 pivots into different sectors in the last year added 'Blockchain' to their name and went from $3 to $30, and now it's back at $20.  They most recently were a biotech firm named 'BiOptix Diagnostics Inc.'. You can't make this shit up!

This is all totally insane. It's exactly what happened in 2000 with ".com".
Now that ppl know South Korea news is fud, how come the price is still dropping? Who are selling? Confused. 
Too many pussies on here crying about a little price dip. WELCOME TO CRYPTO.
Come on wallstreet money, pump bitcoin with your fat bonuses!
Been waiting for this dip, sold my altcoins for Bitcoin!
https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/11/south-korea-cryptocurrency-justice-ministry-softened-stance.html

Here's the news again on CNBC.  They basically admitting their mistake!
I just panic sold the 1 BTC I've panic bought few hours ago
With all the FUD over the past month I'd figure we'd be under $10K by now, but it feels like there's a solid floor at $12-13K.
When you think you're buying the dip...wait a little longer.
Which bitcoin wallet should i use if i just want to store my bitcoins for a short while and then send it out ?

Edit : short while. Maybe a couple of days tops.
In dire need of help. Where can I buy bitcoin for the market price with fiat other than coinbase or GDAX? The exchange in my country is showing a price of 17k USD. :(
FUD debunked, price still low. Working as intended
https://twitter.com/whalecalls?lang=en

Everytime futures liquidate the price takes a massive shit. So much for futures not having an effect on the price.

Coinbase wont accept the cent values that it charged my card to verify as valid. The result is that it keeps locking my account for 24hrs. This is the second time and now my account is locked again. It also won't let me exit out of verifying that card and add another. At this point, I think my account is permanently trashed and I don't know what to do. 
Dimon and the boys are buying in at a discount...hodl
Noob question thatâ€™s been asked a million times but I canâ€™t find a straight answer. Canadian here, bought bitcoin on coinbase and want to get it to coinsquare without paying crazy fees
just bought at 13.5k ! now lets go for a double up !!! 
the entire market is dropping.. not just BTC.. whats going on?? i mean its been dropping since xmas..
Why is Japan the only one with any sense?
Yes, south korea ban is fud. Does that mean people are going to buy back in? I have no idea. People are not rational. I could easily see this continuing to go down for any stupid ass reason.
50k by Valentine's Day?
Update on kraken:
"
I fell asleep at my desk. In a dream, the ghost of a butterfly from the future whispered to me "the dollar hit 0 bitcoin". I wake up, people around me dabbing the blood from their eyes. Progress has been made but not enough. I crack my whip -- "we aren't getting to zero like this!". The flogging will continue until morale improves. Expect another update after I make my rounds. I'm sorry I've let you down."

wat.
Going for lunch in an Asian restaurant today. They have good n-hodl-es. 
 Special thanks to everyone selling me bitcoin at cost tonight

My god. So much FUD last night.
It looks like the 12 month moving average line is going to push over the 26 month line, but for some reason it's being suppressed. It's true through 1hr intervals. Any explanation?
Boing, boing, boing.

I currently have a decent amount of cryptocurrency on a hardware wallet, with about 70% Bitcoin and the rest being ethereum and litecoin.

Im now in a situation where i need the money, so considering selling most of the bitcoin at least, maybe all of it. 

My question, and my problem, is that im only registered on a Coinbase account and with all the the recent threads on here about people not recieving their transfers and high fees, i dont really want to use them. So what other sites can i use? And is using Coinbase really a risk? 

Keep in mind Binance and Bitfinex are not taking new users, and Gemini does not work in my country. 

Cheers.
Can't decide if this armagedon or a really good sale.  Good thing Kraken is down, can't sell my Bitcoin or buy the dip.  I'm at peace because I have no choice but to hodl.
i just put a buy order 10700 EUR :)

On Jan 5th I sent some BTC from my Trezor to Gdax. I did not need it immediately, so I sent it with a low fee (107 satoshis) and it still has not been confirmed. 
I keep watching https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/ and for the last day or two have been seeing that 101-110 fees should get confirmed within 15-20 hours, but this still hasn't happened for me. 
Anything I can do without paying a ton? Just wait it out? I would gladly bump up the fee another 50 satoshis if possible.
[deleted]
is this the end? :(
This is just a theory but what if the current FUD is to shake out weak hands so the guys on wall street, big bankers and financial institutions across the globe start pumping the market next week when they get their fat bonus??
Thoughts? This manipulation is becoming a lot more frequent. Media spreading FUD to cause mass hysteria and then week later starts creating FOMO. ELite are accumulating?
NOW IS THE TIME TO BUY!!!!!!!!
Hope to see it grow today :) 
Feeling positive
Made a transfer from Gdax. Got paperwork from my bank which was expected. Most of it is clear, and some of it is the usual KYC.

But one of the things they want is a copy of the "bank transfer order showing the sender, receiver and payment involved". What would be the closest equivalent to this on gdax/coinbase?

I printed out the account statement for the EUR account it was put into on Gdax side, that also includes the withdrawal in hope that makes them happy. Also did print out the e-mail and the information shown specifically on gdax for the withdrawal (which to be honest, wasn't much).
What do people think of withdrawal fees from exchanges being so high? Almost all the exchanges are charging $10+ to withdraw. I want to be as safe as possible with my coins and keep them off exchanges but those withdrawal fees sure hit hard...
Why is the price dropping? Because of China??
Can someone explain why the mempool is so consistent? You would think with fees $10+ it would go down pretty fast but as soon as a block is found there is instantly enough $10+ paying transactions to fill the next block. Why is that? Why are people seemingly not doing less transactions at these fee levels?
[deleted]
I notice a lot of places are not accepting new users atm. Anything good still open to new users?
Quick question: If I want to make the most profit from trading Zcash to bitcoin and believe that bitcoin is the future and gonna hodl it, I should look into a high price of BTC/ZEC pair instead of ZEC/USD right?
Would anyone mind explaining to me the benefit of limiting or capping new users on exchanges?
About 8 months ago, I sent what is now worth a few $K to a TESNET account inside Ethereum Wallet. I was attempting to purchase some DAO and didn't realize I was on the TESTNET.

The transaction went through successfully - but the recipient was a wallet that has not been claimed (as far as I can tell). 

Is there a way for me to claim this wallet? For instance, can I go somewhere and say "I want a new ETH wallet. Here's the address I want it to be associated with." Then once inside, would I find my missing ETH?

The transaction is posted on Blockchain.info as me transferring BTC. Perhaps I need a BTC wallet and not an ETH wallet?

PS - I asked ShapeShift for help previously but they were unable to help saying "It appears everything completed successfully in our system, so we are unable to recover and funds. If you have access to the Test Net account you could attempt to send it to an active address." 

I do not have access to the TESTNET account.
I've had an unconfirmed transaction for a week or so because my wallet set fees too low. However, I read today that you have to keep your wallet open and be online for it to keep resending the transaction. Is that true? Do I need to be online with my wallet open and be online?

edit: it's new
Don't you see? Exactly after the CME futures, bitcoin started dipping from around 19.500$ to around 13.000$ and staying here.

There are, obviously, a lot of big traders (whales) who **shorted** bitcoin and want to keep the price low.

Read the **short theory** from the following article :

https://cointelegraph.com/news/cme-bitcoin-futures-launch-possible-economic-outcomes

They will keep Bitcoin low until 26 january, and right after that they will buy in back at that low prices.

Correct me, if i am wrong
whoops. wrong place. 
Now is the time to buy right!?! surely this is a dip!
Should i buy bitcoin rn? Is the price going to dip further?
it hit 12.8k yesterday then climbed back up. this is right around when the market should be turning. i've just bought, great price!
Many people are sure Satoshi hasn't spent any meaningful amount of his bitcoins other than early test transactions.

However wouldn't it be much more secure and private to simply give someone the keys to your address than to actually transfer it over the network?

bitcoin leverages the power of the internet yes.

However for
$0 in transaction fees
0 ms delay. (assuming face to face transaction)
and with no log.

You can transfer any amount of bitcoin to anyone.
sans market crash.

Just hand over the keys.

Thoughts?

I think I understand kimchi premium. We cannot arbitrage it because we cannot bring money out of South Korea. But can we buy 10,000 worth of bitcoin, sell it in korea, and bring the 10,000 USD back? It seems like a free holiday to me
Hi guys, here's a random question for you.

Does anyone know what is the best platform to covert BTC/ETH to Fiat Currencies in Hong Kong?  I found one called "Gatecoin" but the volumes are too low so you would take a big loss if you were selling BTC/ETH. 

Coinbase isn't supported in Hong Kong.  Bitstamp is currently not accepting any applications.  So I wonder what is the best alternative now?

Thanks in advance
Is it safe to buy my hardware wallet off amazon?
I think today, and possibly tomorrow, are gigantic in terms of where BTC goes. If we drop below 12,600 we are going well under 10k in the near future. If we clear 15k, it is going up to 20k+. You can kind of see it in the chart too. Big movement is coming in one direction or the other. I don't think the whales will have a high incentive to stop either move (they would happily buy at 8k, or unload at 20k).

EDIT* I also see a weird 15k sell wall that seems designed not to be bought through on GDAX, and something similar that reappears on Bittrex (symmetrical staggered steps). It reeks of manipulation. Not sure if it is to drive down to 8k, or for accumulation, but someone is going to send us in one way or another. 
I want to buy coins now that a dip has occurred, whatâ€™s the fastest way to do this?
After talking to some people on here and in other communities I started a "crypto merch" store. With an emphasis on bitcoin since it is my favorite. Most other sites offer cheap products and uncomfortable and itchy material. I wanted to raise the bar to match the quality of bitcoin. You can find plenty of designs at bitninjasupply.com and browse the different sections. Ill be redoing the site soon. Enjoy and offer any feedback you deem fitting. 
Charts, technical analysis, historical data... You don't have to do it but this are my entry points 

BUY1: 10600
BUY2: 9800
BUY3: 8600 
Would it be possible for the US government to set up several  accounts, controlled by algorithms, that buy and sell large quantities of BTC to manipulate the price and accumulate large amounts of it?

ARK seems like a decent enough idea and actually has a lot of the framework already sorted, but they don't seem to have nailed down any significant partnerships to make their platform more useful/mainstream. Am I missing something?
hi guys i have noticed a couple of venders cancelling bitcoin payment methods, As for the slow transaction time and the high transaction fee , what are your thoughts? could bitcoin cash be  the next bitcoin or etherium or maybe light coin.
Reckon it'll go lower with this ban news?

Post about Why decentralized networks will fall to centralized.
When are fees going to stop being so out of control? What happened to cheap instant global currency or have the developers switched to a global store of wealth? So confused cause one is transferring wealth and the other is just holding it in times of economic downturns which the works maybe facing shortly. Stock market cannot continue on this pace.
