Don't miss the [Critical Electrum vulnerability](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ooack/critical_electrum_vulnerability/) thread. 
Wallets need a new transaction batching UI. 
I should be able to select "new batch" then "add" transactions to it.   
Followed by "save and close" or "Save, close and send if fees are low".  
Later when I have a new transaction to add I'll open my batched tx, add the new recipient and amount and close it again.   
That way I can save up my (non time critical) tx's over the course of the month and then send when I have 5-10 together.

Can we talk about the new awful sticky font color choice? Can the mods get a designer to help?
It blows my mind every time I meet a person that never heard of the word Bitcoin...then again I guess it proves that there's still tens of millions of new buyers out there  
Invested €300 December, have more than doubled my money. HODL, or take back my initial investment and let the rest run?
A month ago a guy on an ask reddit thread said he would eat a sock if the price of bitcoin didn't crash in a week because his dad's a stock broker. A week later he changed it to a month. I think we should get a sock eating video /u/ialo00130
Can someone shill me on why Bitcoin will actually be used as a currency and not usurped by one of the new, more technically capable kids on the block? These high fees and high processing times are killing my optimism. I need to believe again. Disclaimer: I have my eggs in several baskets, including BTC and alts.

Just saw a fucking jack in the box commercial where the guy threw in the comment "bitcoin about to go bust" hate seeing dumb shit like that lead to FUD
Does anyone know how to calculate average transaction fee and time?

Fees - bitinfocharts has an average fee chart:

https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#3m

I guess they just monitor transactions and calculate satoshis to usd, then average over the day.

Time - we can monitor block time, but transactions take much longer than blocktime due to unconfirmed transactions. How can we actively monitor tx time? 
What is a good and secure exchange to trade altcoins if you can't use binance?
What you guys think, is 16k a good buy price or wait for more of a drop?
Dips make me happy. I mean going through the dip sucks, seeing all the FUD is hard but afterwords when it goes back up I feel like I’ve actually done something to earn the bitcoins. I’ve sweated a little and it feels like an accomplishment. I plan on hodling til btc is widely accepted as payment so I’m in it for the long haul. Looking at it this way helps me HODL just thought I’d share for anyone else who needs a little encouragement and maybe a stronger grip
Going to r/btc actually hurts me. It’s like, r/bitcoin and r/btc are so close, but they hate each other. Both think the other is completely brainwashed, and they talk trash about each other like there’s nothing redeemable in either subreddit.
This has probably been discussed but is someone working on an iOS wallet for lighting or is it still too early? “Yeah... that would be great”
Bitmom
Down almost 7% at 13k btc volume. Fuck the bots
what now? why is it going down again?
Is there anyway to add more money to the fee after you made the transaction 
It’s been 3 days 2 inputs 2 outputs no confirmations tho 

I saw someone said their coinbase got shut down because they engaged in prohibited activity, he said "buying marijuana related items" (not sure what exactly. He claimed he did not engage in this activity and he had sent money to users. But even then my issue is coming from how did coinbase assume/know he engaged in this activity? That basically means they tracked his spending what wallets he sent money to and that kind of defeats the purpose of bitcoin being decentralized if your money is tracked...is he bluffing or is coinbase actually aware of where your money is being sent within their guidlines and prohibitions? 
Weird how BCH stays a constant 2500 while the trading volume is high.
What is the deal with the disproportionate transaction fees?

I am not interested in Bitcoin for investing reasons at all. Not looking to make money off of the price fluctuations. Just wanted to try it out on my phone to use at a local place that has started taking them. 

For my first transaction I wanted to make sure I was doing it correctly, so I transferred the minimum amount of .0001 from the exchange to my wallet. So the equivalent of a little over 1 USD. But the fee was almost 20 dollars! 

So what's the deal, is Bitcoin just not intended for small amounts? I don't really intend to spend thousands of dollars in Bitcoin. But it seems like that's the only way it could be economical. Am I doing something wrong?
Price action setup here. It's about to either shoot up pretty good here in the next 15-20 minutes or so or take a temporary plummet. If it breaks below 16100 watch out I think. If it breaks ~16350 should shoot up. 
The thing I am most worried about is that ETH/BTC broke down of their 6month-long bear pattern. That ratio breaking 0.70ish was the biggest fear for me and now that it happened I am not sure about the short-term movements of  Bitcoin, still hodling strong tho
First thing which I am doing after wake up is opening Reddit...lol
the question for bitcoin is who will be right: institutions, who are short, or retail investors (especially those in Japan and South Korea) who remain fervently long. If the past 7 years - in which retail has consistently trounced "smart money" returns are any indication, bitcoin is about to soar as yet another major short squeeze develops in the coming weeks and months.

So what's tanking the price today? Is it the Microsoft news?

Going to ask again:

What's the go-to segwit address generator? I just want to setup a paper wallet, but the only thing I could find is segwitaddress.org. Their addresses are 34 characters (public key) / 52 characters (private key), which doesn't fit the 64 characters mentioned on the [Wiki here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Private_key).

I just want to pull my BTC from Coinbase, but I'm not sending it to some random address without feeling sure about it.
24 hour trading volume is very low on GDAX, what’s driving the price?
Need some help. I am looking for an exchange. It is the one that the interface includes “cards” for each type of currency. I know they have Ethereum, lite coin, and bitcoin. They also have many fiat currencies. I put a small amount on that exchange quite a while back and don’t remember the name of it. Thanks for your help folks!
any thoughts on how far the china electricity to bitcoin miners news will effect price in the days to come ?
How long does it take coinbase prices to catch up to GDAX
***DON'T PANIC ON COINMARKETCAP!***

They just stopped taking Bithumb into consideration, nothing else...
Interesting .... ETH overtook BTC as the most traded coin in last 24 hours.
2018 will be big for Bitcoin!
BTC on discount before liftoff!!!! Buy buy buy 
My another post about Tether. Thinking about how their business model works, I've realized that there are actually much more USDT in circulation than officially issued by Tether Inc.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Tether/comments/7ove97/there_are_much_more_usdt_in_circulation_then/

Ideas?
Bitcoin will be at least $40,000 Next Year
I've created my explanation how I understand the creation of USDT out of thin air that are used to pump other crypto currencies into billion market-caps and how this whole system is backed by real USD deposits of new users. Feel free to add a comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/Tether/comments/7orsm8/it_takes_around_577_days_for_every_issued_tether/
I am currently residing in Ireland and would like to know which exchange should i use to in order to invest in Bitcoin?


Which exchanges are segwit compatible? 


What are the ball park fees/transaction costs for trading in bitcoin? Which one is cost effective? Are they variable/customisable or fixed costs?

Sorry everyone, I caused the drop. I was too greedy and picked Josh ***Lambo***, Jacksonville Jaguars kicker, in the FanDuel Bitcoin bowl.
Possibly a double bottom near 15,750 now. May propel it back into the mid 16's and beyond from here.
accidentallly lost a 0.05 bet that i meant to be 0.005 today :|
Buy the dip! Man I wish I did not drop 5k on BTC yesterday, would have gotten a lot more today.... Look its at 7% correction, and if Thursday on is any indication then it should go down 20% and slowly rise again. HODL! Most experts put BTC hitting 100k within the next 2 years, buy the dip!
Buckle up boi$ looks like we are going down

Anyone wanna explain if coinbase has "penalties" for sending a profit made off bitcoin to your bank account while leaving your initial investment in wallet and either keeping the profit USD or buying more bitcoin with that profit at a lower price during a dip? I havent held for a year yet and these tax rules are confusing. 19, new to taxes and bitcoin so if you feel like being a smartass do it somewhere else my feelings won't be hurt :) just need some wisdom is all. Thanks ahead of time.
[thoughts on this?](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/05/fanduel-offers-a-chance-to-get-bitcoin-rich-off-of-the-nfl.html?__source=Facebook%7Cmain) 
It does have real world value though.  I can send money to someone in China very inexpensively, anonymously, I can store money as if it was in an offshore account if I really wanted.  I can exchange money from currency to currency pretty easily too, it’s has tons of value

Hey guys, for personal reasons (kid is expensive....) I gotta sell 0.15 Bitcoin. Should I do it right now or wait a few days? :)
So I suppose making up a fake SSN to make a gemini account would be a bad thing yeah? Would they just deny the account?

Because after searching and reading a lot of threads in the forum, I don't think I feel comfortable giving out my SSN even with the whole KYC/AML stuff that companies have to follow. I don't mind IDing and bank info but yeah, SSN is too far. And the alternatives that people mention aren't great so I think I might just not do bitcoin after all which is too bad. 
Thought you all might find this interesting...

But please just help me figure out whats going on. Anyone have experience with this website before?! THANK YOU, I REALLY APPRECIATE IT!!

Do you need verification to send/receive bitcoin on coinbase?
How would you respond if someone says ethereum is ‘very decentralized’ vs bitcoin?
Where can I read feel-good get-rich crypto stories?
I hope the 17k bagholders got out when they had the chance. Also, those of you guys on here encouraging people to buy at 17k are shitty people trying to rob people of their money

Nooooo why it dropping???
casual bitcoin user reporting in, heres my experience fwiw. just spent $33 moving btc from one wallet to another as it was made up of weekly payments of $100. then trusted blockchain.info to send the consolidated amount to an exchange for an additional $31 (as i said, casual user, so last time i sent it worked fine). looks like it wasnt enough as its been zero conf for 12 hours

regardless of whether i did something wrong, not paid enough, whatever - this sucks. bitcoin is dated tech and im glad i will never ever transact this POS ever again. thanks
Governments will eventually get their paws into crypto, or do their best to make it hard for us to use it.  Anyone seen proposals that would allow govt's to get their piece of the pie when spending crypto's for purchases?  How can they label it as an asset and a currency.  No one will be able to keep track of every purchase they make with crypto's and calculate the change in asset value.  Believe me, I'm not an advocate of government intervention, but they are coming, whether we like it or not.

Really hoping BCH bounces back soon..
