Daily Discussion, February 11, 2018
One positive side affect of this bearish market is that I am no longer checking the price every 5 minutes. I'd say it's down to around 3-4 times a day.
Its been above 8k for like 5+ days now except a short stop at 9k and 7900, isnt this a good thing? You all acting like 5k is inbound?
Battling 8.3k. Trying hard to keep the bears at bay...canâ€™t hodl on much longer...send re-inforcements armed with buy orders. Call in an airstrike of green dildos soon.
So most people here are looking to make capital gains, right? Is there any crypto out there that's stable enough to be used as proper currency yet?
Been working on [this page](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTraderNetwork/wiki/network) which lists all the crypto subreddits, am I missing any? 
I don't know, anyone who throw numbers out there is just a keyboard jockey trying to get attention.

OMG!  Yes!  Please!  Let's test the 8500 Resistance Level for the 12th time this weekend!  Good Grief~~~~
We finally broke 8.5k again? Nice
Guys, I sold at 8.5k, now it's going to the moon, don't worry.
I'm going to finally order a Bitcoin ATM. I hope it pays off. 
My TA of the last month or so. https://imgflip.com/i/24d9zg
Weâ€™re about to cruise to 9,000 comfortably in the next few hours 
It looks like we are close to completing the cock and balls line on the 4hr chart. Not a good sign. It will be a jizzbath on Monday.
Everyone trying to use their technical analysis to predict the future surely forgot what purpose Bitcoin is serving. We were unsure of hitting 10K per BTC for 2017 and yet we almost hit double in the december craze.

Chill down and enjoy 100K later this year, sell the high and buy the crash.

Halvening @ 2020 will be brutal. 

This game is long.

Have a good day.
Guys, the CBOE futures end on Wednesday and currently says they are 8610. If I understand correctly, if the price of bitcoin is lower they will earn on the difference. Can we assume that they will manipulate the market in order to lower the price until then so that they will earn as much as possible (like the last time)? And then the price will rise again after that?

South Korea's KOSPI and Chinese stocks are bouncing.  Looks like it's helping risk appetite.
if we can get through a sunday without dropping, that will be a win in my book.
Im predicting a jump to around $9000 by tomorrow night. Im basing this off of nothing. Then next week itll be $50k before dropping to 35 cents and then back to $15,568 and 12 cents by the weekend. I know the market and the market knows me. I call him marco and in my phone his contact name is ket man
Even though there is supposed to be no correlation between stocks and the price of Bitcoin, the NYSE open on Monday may possibly be interesting. 
is lightning network already in use ?
Hey Everyone! Hereâ€™s my take on the future of crypto with examples from the Winklevoss twins, Warren Buffett, and Binanceâ€™s Changpeng Zhao - and why you shouldnâ€™t worry about the daily price of crypto! I hope you like this video and that you can learn something from it!

I wont jump into it today, volume is lower and lower it's a massacre.
Hi I have read this on reddit for a long time that many people are keeping a close eye on the genesis block and if satoshi tries to move/sell even a single one from those bitcoin will be over. Do you have any explanation for this reasoning?


If someone get Trump to tweet something cool about Bitcoin then price will shoot to moon in no time. 
What's the real reason for red today?

Trust in the technology behind a currency and youâ€™ll be happy to invest in something you believe .

First!
General direction is still downwards, volatility too high. Donâ€™t expect the market to recover in the coming months.
How are we going to get to 100k when we can't get to 9k?
When bitcoin touches 7500, my turtles head touches cloth.
So was this a "bear" trap?
Head and shoulders forming?
Have spent a few hours now watching GDAX and seeing a familiar Herringbone reversal pattern.

The price is going to change over the next few hours.  Trust me.
Are there any altcoins mine-able on a cheap laptop that you can trade for btc?
No drop from Sunday to Monday. I am starting to believe it's really getting bullish again.
How many weeks has it been since bitcoin went up on a Monday morning?? this is bullish!
Looked like a bear trap to me. I think we will see 9K again today 
quite healthy that we are staying around 8k. hopefully we can hold that level for a while. no breakout to expect till end of february imo. 
Wild Price Estimates Below:

Assumptions included: 1% of existing gold is used and the other 99% is a store of wealth. dollars are in USD. total bitcoins equal approx 16,500,000 btc

1) Western Union https://corporate.westernunion.com/annual-report/highlights.html
$80Billion moved,
268Million customer to customer tx,
523Million business payment tx,
791Million tx/year,
25tx/second,
$101/tx,

If Bitcoin did what Western Union does but limited by pre-segwit and pre-lightning to 7tx/second.

7tx/s x $101 x 60 x 60 x 24 x 365 = $22,295,952,000/year

$22,295,952,000 Ã· 16,500,000 btc = $1351/btc

Assuming 99% of btc stored as wealth.

$22,295,952,000 Ã· 165,000 btc = $135,126/btc

2) Assume Bitcoins sole purpose is coffee purchases at the Bitcoin Coffee Shop.  This is pre-segwit pre-lightning btc.  Also it is still traded, used as a store of wealth and the blocks are perfectly full at 7tx/second.

Coffees are worth $2 each.

7tx/s x $2 x 60 x 60 x 24 x 365 = $441,504,000/year

$441,504,000 Ã· 16,500,000 = $26/btc

Assuming  99% store of wealth = $2695/btc

3) Assume Bitcoins only purpose is to serve the darkmarkets.  I have been led to believe that darkmarket annual sales are $100,000,000.

$100,000,000 Ã· 16,500,000 = $6/btc

Assuming 99% store of value = $606/btc

4) Assume that post Lightning Bitcoin is working as intended.  Venezuela has adopted Bitcoin.

Venezuela 2016 gdp is approx $236Billion

$236,000,000,000 Ã· 16,500,000 btc = $14,303/btc

Assuming 99% store of wealth = $1,403,303/btc


Chinese New Year on February 16.  Will people sell to get fiat for those red and gold envelopes?  (Market go down) Or will they buy BTC as gifts? (Market go up).  Or will that huge holiday ultimately have nothing to do with anything at the end of the week?

So how about this flat earth, you think bitcoin is involved?
mean while in the trenches of 8k....

Excerpt from 24 hours: to the moon! Um, no. To hell with this, bitcoin is shit, I'm going to lose everything, my life sucks. Oh it's going up. TO THE MOON!
Predictions for tonight/monday?
Y'all think I should buy now or wait till tomorrow?
Did anybody noticed that? Green dildo straight to 8.4k?
I've had this thought, it might be crazy or completely wrong as I don't mine, but figured I'd ask.

I've seen these asic units that seem to be considerably faster than gpus. From what I've read, market Instability and no resale value is what prevents these frm being the go to for mining.(again, I might be wrong, but that's what I think I've learned so far)

So, IF Asics are faster, what would it take for miners to make these their go to rigs? Gpus used to be the affordable option, but with this ridiculous gpu bubble, does that make miners take a second glance at Asics? How much will a gpu have to cost before they are just not profitable enough? How about if the market stabilizes and steadily inclined, combined with more and more people using the slower gpus? Is there a point where you would need to up the competition to get an edge?( I'm no expert, but I do see that being the trend, it will never replace hard currency, but it will stabilize and increase in value, becoming more like PayPal than the federal reserve. Bad analogy but I think you get the idea.

Full disclosure, I did this research because I hope to build a gaming pc, but with my financial situation, I just cannot justify paying almost double the price for a gpu, so I researched. I don't blame anyone, it's all about getting the right tool foe the job, I can respect that.
Any truth if bitcoin being a safe haven for people looking to get out of the choppy stock/bond markets?
Does the Chinese New Year really have an effect on bitcoin prices? I went back and looked at price trends around CNY and couldn't really make out any discernible trends.
When bitcoin drump to 5k4?

Unleash what you want but break this !
Tbh I feel like this is a similar trend when BTC was jumping around 8-9K range and it eventually crashed to 6K. It's doing the same for last few days/weeks by jumping between high 7k to mid 8K range. What are your thoughts? 
10k here we go!!!!!!!
Why would any country adopt the Bitcoin as a currency if by definition it makes it untraceable and anonymous. I mean they won't be able to tax those who use it. Enlighten me. 
vegeta incoming
A tradingview member suggested that there is huge market manipulation going on at bitfiniex, as i am a beginner (cant tell if he is correct or has made a mistake  in his analysis) i would love to have your opinion on his post. Let me know what you think :) thanks

This is just a short term weekend dump . The is still bullish for 12k level coming . From my experience of  nyse pit trader and binanace market analyst ðŸ˜€. So HODL and buy when others are fearful !
People just went on that huge vacation for lunar new year right? How does that usually affect the value of bitcoin?

If we break the 8800 wall we will reach 9k plus easily! Lets do it!!!
Any way to purchase bitcoin without verification of identity online?

Btc going to 10k $ soon
Potential batman forming on the 2hr/4hr BTCUSD chart. Watch the price carefully over the next few hours.
Iâ€™ve got someone on here -1ing all my posts. Whoever you are...Iâ€™ll find you...just like Jack Nicholson sniffing out the dirty rat in Departed.
Anyone else see a reverse head and shoulders pattern on the 4hr BTC charts?  Very bullish IMO
Does it touch 15k mark before March? 
What happen to the 10am bull run I put in 20k
everyone, I am confused. Is Peter Schiff the person who predicted the 2008 crash or was he Michael Burry?
Can some one please tell me about these two guys in short. Thanks in advance.
dont really wanna count on weekdays, as global stock markets might countinue going downward and most likely crypto will follow.
I think, any news of hard fork.... news of free coin/free dollar will bring back volume again.
------^ The FOMO is strong with this one
[removed]
can you please recommend a good website for on going and also past trends of bitcoins?
What the flying f**k.  Crashing again just barely 1.5 weeks from $6k crash.  And I thought this won't be happening till at least 5 days from now.
