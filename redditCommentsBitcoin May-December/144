Happy birthday, Bitcoin! üéâ üöÄ
What's with this sudden-drop? It took us 1 day to go to 15.400 from 14.500 and we felt to 14.500 in 2 hours

I had a dream last night that Bitcoin Gold was #1 and BTC was behind it with average price of approx $4500. 

What a nightmare...
If I spend bitcoin from a paper wallet and have not claimed any of the forks yet, am I able to do this after? 
2018 is gonna be a good year. 
Sooo, just applied for verification on BitStamp, says it could take between 24hrs and 2 weeks.... any one here recently done this?
How did people discover bitcoin 9-8 years ago when nobody knew about it?
When will bitcoin go on another turbo run? 
Any idea if this site is legit place to buy hardware:

My mom messaged me yesterday: "I want to buy some bitcoin, can you help me figure it out?"
looks like someone is trying to keep the price down again
What if people don't care about decentralization? What if they don't care about the technical stuff, and they only want to make money? What if all they want to do is to send & spend their money in a way that is cheaper & faster than the current system? 
I ask this because Bitcoin is operating on the premise that people want these things. 
However, I wonder if crypto currency will go the way of privacy in the US? One would assume that most people would be ticked off to find out that their own Government was spying on them illegally. Snowden found out the hard way that most folks don't really seem to care. I'm amazed (but not surprised) that most people don't care. 
So, if most folks don't care about privacy, why would most folks care about the advantages of Bitcoin?

what else do you guys like to do for fun?
Can someone ELI5 about forks? 

Do you have to have held btc for a certain amount of time to get extra btc from the fork? I currently only have a little bit held on an exchange. Does it count if it‚Äôs held there or does it need to be held in a private wallet? Will extra btc just suddenly get added to the amount that‚Äôs held on the exchange?
Bank Verification.

I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm doing wrong, I had no issue linking my credit card but can‚Äôt verify my bank account. 

It tells me to enter the 2 transactions that appear on my banks activity but whenever I do that I receive an error message saying ‚ÄúThose amounts didn‚Äôt appear on our records.‚Äù

At first I thought maybe I was entering the wrong order or just not correctly but the most recent attempt really just has me stuck.

2 transactions appeared on my account, they were both ‚Äú0.08‚Äù but I‚Äôm still receiving the error message. 

Not sure what I‚Äôm doing wrong at this point. 

Any advice or help is greatly appreciated.

Edit: I‚Äôm also doing this on the Coinbase app.
Noob here - Checking the current prices on GDAX, and the price for BTC is much higher for euro than it is for USD. I can only trade for EUR in my country on GDAX. 
I'm just curious if the price will regulate after a while or is this the common tendancy? Also aren't a lot of people who have access to both currencies,  able to make easy money through arbitrage this way? 
250 BTC buy wall on gdax at $14950 - who's got that kind of dough?
What are your thoughts on Bitfinex? In my country they have a very user friendly app so it would be easy to trade while away from home. (Crypto noob, redditor for 2 weeks and bitcoin hodler)üí™üèªüíµ
What exchange should i use?
First time buying and im about to drop ¬£2 grand ^_^
Also, should i go full on bitcoin or any alts too?
I think the days of 2009-2017 Bitcoin year over year percentage gains are over. No more $1,100% annual gains. From here on out, people should expect market crushing gains of between 20% to 100% annually. Who in their right mind wouldn't risk 5% of their investment dollars and take a flier/hodl position on bitcoin? 

Double your money every 7 years @ 10.2%
Double your money every 3.8 years @ 20%
Bitcoin domination is breaking everyday... Its down to 36 percent... Market cap is growing but money is not pushed into bitcoin... I have a strong feeling some coin is gna dethrone btc this year...
These slow price movements - yawn 
Hey guys so on coinbase can I say turn BTC into ETH or last LTC into ETH? I‚Äôm just wondering because I bought some BTC a while back and split it into the other two on Binance. Now I‚Äôm wanting to send them back over to Coinbase for convenience but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôd have to do everything through my bank account with USD at that point...?
When/how will we be able to claim our bitcoin private forks? Will it be supported on ledger?
