That Bart Simpson trend line is forming pretty well. 
I've been consistently putting in $750 every 2 weeks into btc. I gotta feeling we're heading to the Moon, would be crazy to dip into my emergency fund to get in before it's too late, and just replace my emergency fund money and just replace it down the line with the $750 contribution in was planning on putting in btc?
I have to admit: I enjoy watching the games.

Feels a bit like ancient Rome.
So rbtc is pretty much rbuttcoin, but focused on Bitcoin. lol

**Bitcoin Price Defends $8K But Pullback Still in Play**

https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-bounces-back-from-sudden-dip-eyeing-move-to-8400/

Bitcoin (BTC) remains on the hunt for a major bullish breakout after bouncing back from an overnight dip.

Prices hit a four-day low of $7,823 yesterday reportedly due to whale dumping over $50 million-worth of the cryptocurrency in one Bitfinex trade. The news that New York's attorney general is taking a closer look at major cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the state may also have dampened the bull mood.

The sudden price drop raised the possibility that the rally from the April 1 low of $6,425 had run out of steam.

However, BTC's sharp return from $7,873 to $8,160 this morning established the area around $7,800 as a strong support level and indicates a strong dip-demand mentality in the market. For the second time in the last three days, a dip below the $8,000 mark was quickly undone.

The recovery witnessed this morning adds credence to the bullish moving average studies.

As of writing, BTC is trading at $8,090 on Bitfinex - largely unchanged on a 24-hour basis.

**View**

BTC will likely test supply around $8,400 in the next 24 hours. A high volume close (as per UTC) above that level would signal a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.

On the downside, $7,870 (today's low) is the key level to watch out for. BTC's failure to defend the key support level could yield a pullback to $7,510 (former resistance turned support).

Only a daily close below the ascending (bullish biased) 10-day MA would indicate the rally from the low of $6,425 has ended.

There was no moon action for BTC today but overall a FANTASTIC day for the crypto market as a whole! The market cap has been steadily growing and so has the 24hr volume. I can't help but feel really optimistic...
Shheeeeeiiitttt. We gona own da moon son.
Btrash is getting some love now.  Who the fuck is buying that?
So all my friends are non believers in bitcoin. When I explain why it‚Äôs going to be huge they can‚Äôt comprehend it. 

This makes me believe we are only in the early stages of it. I‚Äôve made a bet that by July if BTC isn‚Äôt at 20k I will have to buy them all a round or drinks. 

I cannot wait to show them my account size by July üòÜ

Moral of the story: Don't play with the whales. Some of you might get rich, but most will lose a lot of money.

Think long term. Buy cheap and hold.

All in baby even my emergency dip money, I could be wrong but it just feels like it's gonna explode.
I'm a Swedish 27 y/o guy who's been keeping an eye on bitcoin for several years. I first heard of it from my brother when it was only worth a few dollars and he told me to start mining some. (I didn't and boy do I regret that..)

I've been interested in buying a few times during these years, but never really understood how to get hold of some. It seemed too complicated and I never really tried to be honest, but the last two years that changed.

2016 I started googling and found out you needed a wallet etc. There were so many wallets to choose from that I wasn't sure which ones to trust and I was intimidated. I ended up giving up (again, big regret...).

Beginning of 2017 I thought to myself that it was now or never. This time I actually got as far as getting myself a wallet. The next step was to acquire some coins to put in it. The easiest way after some googling seemed like buying from an exchange. Here is where I ran into a wall this time. To get approved (or whatever is it called) I had to send them pictures of my ID and some recent bills. I was living with my parents at the moment and the bills were in their name, so again I gave up (Regret regret regret).

 Yes, I am very lazy and give up as soon as I run into a tiny bump on the road.. BUT I am a relatively young guy. I have used conputers, played videogames and bought new technology my entire life. If I couldn't figure out how to buy and own bitcoin, how is my mom or dad going to?

I think that when it's as easy to buy bitcoin as it is to buy in-game currency in videogames, then we will really see new money flow in.

Sorry for the wall of text and grammar. Just a Swedish guy that needed to vent. I'm cross-posting this in a few places because it took me a really long time to write and I want it to be seen, hehe.

PS. I ended up buying into an ETF in Sweden that follows the 
price of bitcoin and one that follows ethereum. In december 2017.....

TL:DR Young guy that's used to new technology thought it was too complicated to buy bitcoin in 2016 and beginning of 2017. Bought in december 2017 instead...
I finally got my Robinhood account set up which is perfect timing because I just deleted all linked bank accounts with Coinbase after they made more fraudulent charges after the duplicate charges from Feb.

Would be nice to see a few big green candles! 
So we moonin', or nah?
Ahh now I see. Yea I would agree. I haven‚Äôt had any issues like that luckily. Good luck hope it gets cleared up
For the most part the price was below the EMA50 on the daily chart. Which corresponds to the EMA4800 on the 15min chart depicted here. 

It would be nice to see a real breakthrough...

#US AUTHORITIES LAUNCH MAJOR PROBE INTO BITCOIN TRADING
‚ÄòThe New York Attorney General has launched an investigation into 13 major cryptocurrency exchanges trading bitcoin and other digital currencies‚Ä¶ The Virtual Markets Integrity initiative¬†could bring about tighter regulation for cryptocurrency exchanges.‚Äô

https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/bitcoin-price-cryptocurrency-exchange-coinbase-gemini-investigation-new-york-a8309261.html
I figured it out finally, how the USA is going to cripple bitcoin.

They are going to create a new 'crypto tax' in which every time you convert USD to crypto, they will tax it like a gas tax. So you will have to convert it to Euros first, and then try and go overseas. But if you do any in America, there will be a crypto tax. They will pass a law that ALL regulated conversion companies MUST collect and pass this tax in order to be a recognized banking institution, and all others who fail to comply will be investigated for 'providing money to terrorist organizations' and subsequently shut down.

What this does is pretty crazy. It makes it MORE expensive to purchase the same things at home in the USA than with cash or debit cards, which will immediately stop the adoption of it by vendors.

Banks win, the Government retains control, and people who want to have bitcoin for 'funzies' can still do so. Plus, new banking restrictions are in place and are very hard to get or you have to pay a really high fee for a 'banking permit' to sell and exchange BTC.

Edit: yes, I do own bitcoin, and I fear for this kind of stuff.
