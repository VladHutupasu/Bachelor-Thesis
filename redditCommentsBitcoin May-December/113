Pro-tip: you don't have to pay any capital gains taxes if you sell at a loss!
bitcoin what is you doing
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Are we all delusional?

One very key reason why it's not coming back any time soon:

Bitcoin was relatively obscure until last year's run (yeah, I know some of you have been steeped in this stuff for a while) - the vast majority of people first became aware of it as an asset to be traded in the last 12 months.  It developed a brand identity (to the moon) and a mythology (if everyone moves from gold to bitcoin. . .if everyone realizes that cash money is inflationary. . .if everyone realizes the possibilities of bitcoin, yada, yada, yada. . .) that justified not only current insane valuations - but incredibly insane future projections (it's going to 50K, 100K. . .dare I say it? a million someday!!! - Lambos for everyone).  And that was fun for a while.

But it became an obvious bubble.  And the frothier it got, the more insane the mythologizing became and the dumber the money went in.  Stories started circulating of people maxing credit cards, taking second mortgages, deferring payment on student debt. . .bad bad stuff.

Pop

Now it's brand is going to be:  "oh yeah, bitcoin, that the thing my buddy lost his life savings on."  "Q: How can you make a small fortune in bitcoin? A: Start with a large one."  Its quickly become a joke, a cautionary tail - right up there with - Tulips, Beanie Babies, Pokemon Cards. . .The branding is horrible now. Throw in the bitfinex/tether scam and there isn't going to be a recovery for this. The longer it stays here, the more sentiment will turn against it - the worse it will get. Forget smart money, even the dumb money is going to stay away for a long time to come.  

Remember, the price is 100% psychology and the sentiment has turned sour.  The true believer level where you might find support is way south of where it is now.   
HOLY FUCK WHO JUST SOLD 8000 BTC on bitfinex??
I'm so good at losing. Does anyone want some advice on losing? I can tell you the worst points to buy, and exactly when to panic sell.
All aboard the 5k train! Chooo chooo!!!!!
If Fiat does not matter, why are people so obsessed with how much each Bitcoin is worth in USD??
I'm quitting. I don't want to be a bag holder for the rest. Good luck people.
For reference, [this](https://kek.gg/i/zfTPZ.png) is what a series of 50% increases followed by 50% decreases looks like. It is why posts implying equivalency between an x% decrease and an x% increase are misleading.

e.g. A 100% increase followed by 'only' a 60% decrease is equivalent to a 20% decrease from the original value, **not** a 40% increase.
i'm fucking gone. goodbye 15k(money lost not entry) see you never. 
Tell me when it reaches 7k.
I'm here to find the dumbass that said he'd eat his left nut once we fell to 7k. Too easy.
To those who have been preaching "strong support at 11k, 10k, 9.5k, 9k, 8k ...", "buy the dip", ..... please stop.  None of us have any clue so stop the hyperbole as it will just encourage newbies to get burnt.  BTC is current in bear territory, no one knows what is the floor.  It may go back up, it may stay at 8K for months, it may crash.
Let's be serious for a second. Bitcoin dropped from 19.2k to 7.4k in just a few weeks after virtually nothing changed. BTC is arguably in a better position utility-wise and adoption-wise now than it was in December.

What's holding BTC up from, say, sub-1k? Why should the price even go up?
Weeee
Crash and burn. ouch
imo it's going to be difficult for bitcoin to rise over 10k again. Too many people are looking to sell for break-even and many have bought for over 10k. There are billionaires who bought for over 10k and are in a huge loss right now.
Broken the 7200 wall. 200 to go
Three times now I've gone back in when it looked bullish and three times the price has dropped $1,500 within 24 hours.

I'm out. 

Good luck to all of you guys.
Had a dream last night that bitcoin had a flash crash to $10 and I was scrambling to get to my computer to buy a ton of them but by the time I got there it was back to 9k. I guess that was more of a nightmare and not a dream
Get ready to perhaps test a new floor.
I have been doing daily charting for Bitcoin for the past few weeks and price action doesn't look good. I leave my analysis unbiased, with a primary focus of just helping people. Here is my afternoon analysis https://youtu.be/rd7R9Ka10f0 - I plan to do daily updates, since my channel is helping subs and getting positive feedback. I wish everyone the best in their trading and have a great weekend.
So, are we supposed to buy yet another dip? This shit is getting me broke. 
Just tried to buy at 7630, purchase didn’t go through. Thought about it for a little, then sold everything I had. I’m out. It’s been fun 
This is so much like watching the Internet bubble burst.  I often monitored the Reddit equivalent of the day (yahoo stock message boards) back in 2000 and 2001.   

If what I saw back then is any indicator,  we have not seen bottom.  In order for a true historically correct bottom,  you need to see mass 'capitulation'.  

I learned this term AFTER the Internet bubble burst,  from talking heads on cable TV.   They defined it technically,  some shit like 'steeper than previous blah', plus other mumbo jumbo.

I kind of went back over the message boards after the bubble , relishing all the flames I got as I was short and screaming 'bubble' almost from ATH. 

Here is what mass capitulation looked like on social media:

1) quantity of posts (doesn't matter short/long)  drops off and stays off,  and get's noticed by the remaining.

2) unless the poster is truly delusional (it's obvious) the delusional wishful thinking posts stop completely (all hope is lost?).

3) celebrity 'posters'  (always long, today that's reddit,youtube,twitter, etc.) start to switch/defect,  mea culpa's , I'm sorry's,  etc.


Other observations:

There is something about 50% as a mental threshold.   At the top of the Internet bubble,  I could get some of my friends to accept that things were headed down after rises & splits equalling maybe 800%.  For some reason everyone who agreed it was going down choose 50% as their expected drop?    The aggregate drop for all my friends and all our ESOP shares was closer to 85-90%.

Another interesting observation.  My circle of friends and associates working in the tech sector mostly worked at 5 big Silicone Valley tech firms.  Of those 5,  two no longer exist,  three are owned by Oracle.  The best recovery off of post burst ATL was 5 to 14,  then Oracle bought for 19.

edit:format
Downtrend continues looks like a ruff Monday coming 
Say what you want, I’m out of (all) crypto. 
Buy the ~~dip~~ peak
A lot of people need to forge their own advice instead of being too positive/negative.Take care of comments you read indeed, but could be interesting too to take in consideration when you read that it's perhaps not the good moment to buy instead of laughing. Note that i putted conditional words. ;)
Seems like big players are getting out. Over 15000 BTC sold in 1h
If this support fails, get ready for the free fall.
Y'all still here?
OK. I’ve just read about what the dot com bubble was and this sounds pretty similar. Badass. Wish I hadn’t invested at 17k. :(
Just shut off the heat in my home.  I'm going into to hibernation mode.  Wake me up when my Lambo arrives.

See you in sub 5k
Panic sell
Just when you thought you were in the green 
Anyone know a good crypto app/portfolio that displays actual live prices?  Ive tried them all, and you have to swipe down and manually refresh.  I want my tablet to display prices live, fast, for various coins.  Thanks

Below 8000
Trading is very suspicious on bitfinex. 1000 btc walls getting eaten in sudden yet consistent ways. The Tether accusations may turn out to be something big..
Bought in at 10k. Im officially in the negatives.
[deleted]
Not gonna lie. I am sad.
No longer screaming for Lambos, Ill take a Lada at this stage!
Bitcoin will live forever baby. We’re just like roaches, never dying, always living.
Crypto is DONE because Coinbase only made 1 Billion in revenue last year and this year they want to go out of business.  Tired of making so much money
Anyone know a way I can lose 1% per hour for the next 5-180 days?
not a btc hodler. I get paid in crypto. Thats my only source of income. from the moment I got paid and trying to convert to dollars I lost 1200$ of my monthly salary. I dont know what to do of this.
Remember hodlers...at least when it goes to 0, it can’t go down any further.
nothing has changed.  crypto is still being worked on and improved by hardworking smart and enthsiastic people.  this recent price spike and drop really has nothing to do with my longterm view.  a bunch of people fomo'd and panic sold. money exchanged hands.  not really my problem.  thats my outlook
Worth remembering (Bitcoin):

* **May 11**: up to 30$- then crash to 3$+ in 4 months. It took 20 months to recover... (see here: https://ibb.co/ko4zLc)
* **Apr 13**: up to 230$+ then crash to ~65$ in 4 months. It took 8 months to recover (see here: https://ibb.co/d8WtDx)
* **6 Nov 13**: up to 1000$+ then crash to ~225$ in 4 months . It took more than 2 years to recover (see here: https://ibb.co/cS8R0c)
* **Dec 2017**: up to 19K$+ then crash to **X1** in  **X2** months... It will take **X3** months to recover.
 
Your guesses for **X1**, **X2**, **X3**?
Love how 85% of the comments here are now BABBY'S 3 day old account.
At the end of the day its a matter of investing because you believe the technology is valuable, not because you're looking to make a quick buck. We're seeing everyone who got involved with cryptocurrency just to cash out jump ship now, leaving only those who are actually invested in the tech and those who dont have weak hands. Buying at moments like these are the moments others will look back on and wish they bought during our current dilemma 
I need to pay off my house and I have just enough... cash out now or hold for this week and hope it hits 10k... then pay off, and take my lady on a nice vacation?
market has been so heavy on so much good news, what do the whales know?
Bitcoin stahp 
Another support broken guys
I think at this point the meme about bitcoin hitting 5000 might happen 
"Bitcoin is not a bubble" - Said the people living in a bubble.
It's pretty obvious what's happening right now with the prices. The overall trend is downward, and people want out. There are a few market manipulators with 100+ bitcoin that just sit around, wait for a steady downward 15 min trend to open up, then they buy 50-100 btc (which is enough to swing the price up a few hundred), then they sell gradually over the next few minutes. It's guaranteed profit given that the price is in a steady downward trend with low volume.
when homeless?
I know this could definitely dip lower but without question all of my intuition is confirming the value of this price right now. Sure I could wait for it to go to 6k (it might I have no clue) but I also know that in the long term these coins are going to be worth a hell of a lot more than they are today.

I'm trying to explain to family members the psychology that is so hard to shake in crypto. The desire to buy when prices are going up and the desire to sell when they are going down. The despair has set in here, people aren't buying and now it is time to make size-able purchases for the long term (trading stacks can be made after the rise IMO). 

I've NEVER been able to call a top or call a bottom perfectly however I have been able to see when we are blatantly too far in one direction.

BTC (and other quality projects) will surpass its ATH again. The discount here is too great and the despair too strong. As I watch this break under 8k, I am checking that my Ledger is safe and calling my investment advisor for more funds.

I know this may seem counter intuitive to many of you (especially newbies) but even if it takes 5 years I am certain that this technology will only being more ubiquitous in our lives.

Strong Buy in my opinion at 10k or below.
The positive: Bitcoin will teach millions of youths the difference between investments and speculation.

May young people who got crushed during the .com bubble are much better investors today.
Ah thinks there be another leg down here
Where can we read about current lightning network bugs? I saw 2 bugs since January, but no follow up.

I find lightning network news more interesting than anything in cryotocurrency.
ok, what the FUD is this now?!

correction or retesting of the bottom?

When exactly is Robinhood opening it's crypto exchanges? Does anyone know yet?
This is like watching clash of the titans...50BTC orders flying around like they are peanuts :)
Bitcoin futures on ameritrade commercial. I'm not sure of this is good for bitcoin. 
That 8040 wall is massive 
Edit: Was, holy shit can we do this? 
Bitcoin being brought to its knees here. Where could we expect a bottom? 
Support being tested guys. This isn’t good.
What would happen when the blockchain becomes long enough and mining it takes more energy than it is doing today? How would transactions continue? 
You guys think it will pass 7k today?
Historically Speaking Bitcoin Has Never DIED and Anybody who has ever sold has always regretted it within 2 year time span
It is simple each hour more and more people will be crashed and braked and they will sell.... 
Only few HODLErs will survive (300 spartians motherfuckers...)
I don't even want a lambo, I want a reasonably priced car I can drive at the Top Gear track while smoking cigars
This dip is different.

Yes bitcoin has dipped many times in the past and has come back much higher.  But that was because NEW BUYERS powered those moves back up. I don't see any new buyers at these price points.

We are in for the big one. I'm talking about a 95% dip to $999.
[deleted]
There are soooooo many people in here making predictions. You are NOT an oracle when you say "bitcoin is going to go to 5K" when it is already dropping. You guys look like complete fools 90% of the time and the other 10% are broken clocks.


Nobody should listen to anybody making a prediction about Bitcoin going in either direction. Nobody has a clue no matter what they tell you or how fancy their chart looks.

Is FUD that was proven right still FUD? #JustBitcoinThings
[deleted]
Human beings are so psychologically vulnerable to government propaganda. We had sk and Russian officials reaffirm that there is no realistic countermeasures at their disposal to effectively ban  crypto. It's virtually impossible on their end. Sure the banks can shut down transactions to exchanges, but that's one avenue of hundreds. 







I was told $8k was the floor

Long time reader, first time poster. I bought during the massive bull run in December. 

In case anyone is in the same position as me, here's my experience so far. 

I decided to sell a few days ago, even at a loss because there is a lot of uncertainty (lol) and it seemed to me (disclaimer: I know nothing about trading) like the price was headed down towards a major correction and I wanted to at least save some of my cash for potential purchases of BTC later. 

I don't really understand the 'HODL' argument unless you are prepared to see it go down to $500 before it goes to 10k, 15k, etc. I wanted to adopt a more proactive strategy and mitigate any future losses whilst also having cash to buy in at future opportunities. 

So far it seems like I made the right decision. I bought in a little bit yesterday during the beginning of this drop and having one foot in, one foot out is working out ok so far.

Best of luck everybody! 
just a month ago everyone was swearing they would buy in BTC if there would just be some grand dip... now they all chicken out xD
[deleted]
Strong support at 8250 for now.
Yay, it's up to 8k.

Wait, what?
Many casual investors have been burned by btc. So the road to recovery is going to be a bumpy one. 

I think most casuals would be happy with a quick 10% return on their initial investment. 

I preach hodl but I’ve certainly been buying during an obvious dip and selling during the rise while keeping the profits in. 
I couldn't help myself, had to buy more bitcoin. i'm optimistic about the future of crypto.
Is the price decrease related to the doubling of hash rate?
Why is there a dip in Sunday night??
4 weeks in a row selling sundays, its the only day i do day trading..its gonna fuck me over one time.
When the Bitcoin price drops I tend to hodl onto my cat. Cat just hissed and ran off with a arched back at full speed. My hands are strong and I’m getting more fiat ready to buy in, oh hey kitty come fucken hodl me while I ruin ya financially 
[deleted]
Since 1400 everyone crying, well not all open up a short position ffs. 
We should be in the middle or end of the 5th wave downtrending to 7000. I don't know if this is a small bounce or it's fighting off the 8000 which would make it healthier than most believed. I'm still not touching it until it lifts its skirt and we see the goods
its like Sparta v Persia all over again...
[deleted]
Is today the new low for 2018?
New user here, I bought BTC at $14k (just a little to play around with and wait a few years) and now price is $7.6k. I'm not gonna sell, and I'm not in a panic, I have faith in bitcoin but my question is should I buy a little more now? Or ride it out and wait? Thanks
Even an autocratic regime like China can't ban crypto. They are at their wits end trying to prevent its adoption.

Who’s portfolio is down overall? Me...invested at $17k. Total loss $15,000. No biggie.

Sometimes I do wonder who has actually got my money.
Next stop 6,2k. How about cutting all the crap and going there directly.. But noo, we have all those stupid trading bots trading every swing until some whale comes along and decides what's next. Probably have to wait one or two more days before any reasonable movement. (lot's of speculation, don't pay attention to my words..)
Do you people understand that if you get a roi of 50 times more than you what you paid that 49 other people lost the same amount of money ? You do realise that there is no value created right ? You do understand that you're in this for gambling at this point and that you have been warned over and over from responsible people who actually understand crypto.
You have better odds right now to gamble just at a casino, it's just more transparent there. This is like the subprime crisis, people in way over their head, not understand what is actually happening but they find redditors that think all will be well, so yeah why not invest!
I don't see this as another dip, we just simply haven't recovered yet. It seems like some small-medium sized whale made it seem like we were recovering and people bought on hype and now he's making his profit. The bigger whales haven't re-entered yet. Just my 2cents
Robust defence at 8000. I’ll eat my own dick for breakfast tomorrow morning if it’s less than 8k.
I predict a long term bear market for bitcoin. No new money is coming in after the bubble has burst and bitcoin still has little practical value as currency due to high fees and slow transactions. Plus, there are more and better alt coins every day. 
And down we go, $6000 here we come.
abandon ship
I'm just buying the dips but with less money each time.
Im getting either the same amount of btc or more for less and less money.  Imma ride this rocket back to the launch pad, let elon polish it up, and send me off again in the future.

no fuks given.
God, tell me this dip will touch its actual bottom
*We’re going down down in an earlier round and sugar we’re going down swinging* 🎵 
Just caught [a glimpse of whale activity on Bitfinex](https://i.imgur.com/qK2st2X.png), how do you explain this?
7400 wall just broke
At this point, only 10 percent savings interest rates could effectively 'kill' bitcoin and other crypto currencies. But given the fragile nature of our debt backed financial system, that future is a pipedream. People will continue to risk capital in order to escape the ravages of inflation and overregulation.

I truly feel bad for the new people who are having a hard time dealing with this volitality. I remember when Bitcoin would go from 8$ back to 1$ and then back up to 3$ rinse and repeat. Volitality has ALWAYS been a part of Bitcoin. If your in this for the short term, sure, sell your coins for whatever profit you have left. However, if you really truly want to hodl long term, you have to find a way to accept the insane volitality in cyrptos. You have to be honest with yourself and decide if you can handle the extreme swings without compromising your quality of life.

women and children first


this is it, today we turn this ship around!
Sold the wife, car & house, now only hodl left
Wow. Will be honest, did not take this dip very serious till the past couple days. Stayed up all night last night i just couldnt stop looking at the charts. I have work in 3 hours. =( ....ick.....fuck cam girls for introducing me to crypto!! Just messing/ going down with the ship&i love cam girls. Cant look anymore though /Good night
Wow. we may be on our way to testing a new bottom guys.
Goodness. These buy walls are getting eaten alive.
Went from 12k profit to 1k profit lol still hodling. Hodl or die
200-300 coin sell wall at 8300 has moved down slowly the past few hours and is at 8030. Big players been trying to drive it down, which happens but we gonna break free and make it back to 10k tomorrow.
probably going to be another blood bath Monday
BTC bang in shit 
Price dips, new accounts here spreading FUD, i buy more btc.

What's new guys? 
Just initiated a ACH deposit to GDax...expected to clear Friday. Let's hope we still dippin' at the weekend.
I honestly thought 7500 would hold. It seemed like a whale was interested in buying here. But no more. I don't know anymore. 
It had a couple of days of strong support at £6k but all the buyers have dried up it seems. Easily heading to £5k now imo. I think I'll just watch. 


I just bought in some more. I've been in since 2013 and one thing is always true: BTC will rise.
Damn I need some more FIAT these weekend sale prices are awesome
Disgusting decision from Lloyds Bank.. who are they to decide what people spend their money on.. what's next, cigarettes, sweets and alcohol. Even more of a reason for Bitcoin to exist
I've known about bitcoin for many years but only started investing in it when I heard about its gains in recent months.  Now, like others, I'm borderline obsessed with it.

So, as you've probably figured out, I've "lost" money since getting in.  However, I haven't sold off my investment, and I'm not trading on a margin.

Here's the weirdest thing about it.  I'm not just investing, I'm learning.  Even though my portfolio has lost value, I feel richer in a sense, because I was never able to save money in the past and now I'm actually holding onto a chunk of something.  Also, experience has taught me that there is no such thing as wasted time.  You can learn from everything, both good and bad aspects.

I'm a bullish noob.  I hold onto an asset that has recently lost value but has this amazing long term history of growth.  I'm kind of starting to understand the weak hands, strong hands concept.

These are a noobs two cents.

My friend lost his house and I lost my wife and kids. 
Dropping again. Will be below 8000 in the next hour
There seems to be a global orchestrated attack on decentralisation. Do not give up. We need to out number these evil bureaucrats making all the decisions that keep suppressing our freedom. With all these bans and fake news etc there has to be a backlash
[deleted]
i have faith it will stop with this nonsense downtrend and pop back up... but these sell walls are huge. help 
Good night 200 MA -- not good ladies and gentleman :(
Nah and fair enough. My main point is think for yourself don’t be swayed in either direction by sensationalism 
It would be sick if they promote bitcoin on the Super Bowl.  One can only dream. 
time to invertment or not any one suggestion for me thanks
How long is this up-down shit gonna go on for?
Isn't 7800 support the 200-day moving average that institutional investors should be looking at?
How do you determine it's a fake wall?
I bought some in September and some in November, so I am just starting to lose fiat value on it now. But my strategy was to hodl until the end of 2018 at the earliest. So by then even if its like only $100 or whatever it won't sting so bad, and I might as well just hodl on. 
Is there a reason transactions are moving so slow? Tried to buy a pretty small amount of BTC on Coinbase almost 24 hours ago, still not in my accounts. Cause for concern?
How much truth do we think there is behind this new China FUD?
Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
Its sad as fuck knowing everyone selling right now is getting hammered. Wowzers. My exchange just dipped under 10k Canadian for the first time I've been trading. 
Is today's drop due to China's move to block Bitcoin exchange websites?
Please don't choke Mr. Dino!

I bought around 3.5k  bitcoin in January, and now it's  down to around 2.2k. 

Then I got into Robinhood in January. I can't buy crypto there yet but I bought $700 worth of stocks. APPL, GE, AMD, a few others.  I was up a bit but after Friday's drop, I'm down like $20. 

And I recently bought in to Silver  1oz rounds, mostly American Eagles. I bought with fiat but interesting to note places like apmex and provident metals accept btc for payment as well. 
I'm in around 34 coins (34oz,around $600ish). 

My investment plan:
* For BTC, hold for around a year where I'll be in the green,  take out my initial investment, access market to figure out what to do with profits. 
Might add 50-200 month.

*For stocks, regularly keep putting in 50 - 200 a month. Collect dividends, but otherwise stay in for at least 3 years. 

*Silver - Everything I'm buying is IRA eligible. My plan there is to have silver as a hedge against other investments, with flexibilkity to add to my IRA. It's also been almost a decade sense silver was at ATH, around $40 / oz. I'm In at 17$ ounce. 
If it goes to over 30 is possibly sell some.

Looking for advice on my plan above 
7k wall being tested
If the reason you originally bought in was to be a long term holder, don't worry about what the price will be tomorrow, worry about what it will be next year. The thought of losing more and more money can make us do things we wouldn't usually do, if you're in a position where you don't need to sell, don't, and hold what you originally believed would be a good long term hold.
We need more 6k memes, come on, keep the positive spirit alive
its monday, btc typically sells off around 9pm PST Saturday nights.  look for the swoosh bottom then...and it will be a 3 digit number by then.
we are going back to 1300?-
did anyone watch the superbowl yesterday? no? maybe because it's extremely boring compared to watching THIS!
I think this is the end for Bitcoin and alts
so many financial geniuses in the sub today. Classic bubble talking points people have been saying for years and years and really they don't understand shit like the rest of us. Almost everyone who truly understands the future potential of bitcoin is extremely bullish. Only reason they are here is because of the dip. once the dip is over they will go away until the next big dip. the cycle repeats. 
9,000 bitcoin sold in 5 minutes on bitfinex, this is going deep boys
If you’re worried just remember that no one likes to sell for a loss. 90% of people are shorting and will buy back in once we reach bottom. This will create a new FOMO at a much lower price which will skyrocket the price back up. Anyone that has currently lost money, don’t stress, be grateful that you’ll finally be apart of the next massive run! 
Fuck. Just get up to 11k so I can get out

Im not selling my bitcoin till when it’s considered one of the worlds top reserve currencies !
Hello, first time commenter here. Been in this space for sometime though. I've delved deep into the tech and the story of this disruptive innovation. I am compelled to say this: it is incredible how threatened all the status quo parties are by this disruptive technology. I would like to point out the following: many news outlets reveal stories way after the fact to create fear: latest example the tether debacle that was one month old from when the media decided to spin in it two days ago 2) stories are manipulated to the point where it becomes a falsity ( example: india banning crypto, not true 3) There is a constant pressure to make sure that jack and jill don't buy crypto and get rich from it, which then leaves these very same status quo people holding the majority of the crypto... For instance today, many different media outlets are saying that banks are no longer accepting the use of their credit cards for crypto purchases. This is today's story. The banks are the very same people that feel totally threatened, so since they are the system, they are fighting back by telling you the client, what you are allowed and not allowed to buy using their credit card. Its irony at its finest. There is another amazing crypto payment platform called bitwala a german team offering a fantastic product, but the visa distributor that they had a deal with to print their crypto cards pulled the plug on them because VISA itself banned its distributor from supplying crypto payment platforms. You can see clearly- how those that are happy with the status quo will do everything they can to keep it at their controls. But what can one do? People are motivated by fear, and because their isn't a 'centralized' crypto front yet.. it is in its infancy can be compared to a baby going against 50 giants in battle... add to that people's greed at the same time, and u get a situation we are in now. I find it insane that a bank can tell me what i am not allowed to purchase with my money and facebook's zuckerberg who is part of the status quo (facebook technology is literally byzantine at this point) tells us what Ads we are allowed to see (he recently banned crypto Ads), while he receives billions for Ads we don't want to see. All i can say is this: blockchain is the people. Remember that. 
I am buying even If I am wrong and it go down to 5500$ there is straight road to the new ATH from there.

Rich guys want to earn money. 

They exists because of Your fear.

I just seriously considered selling, which I assume is what most people are doing the more it dips. I told myself I'd invest thousands once it's this low but it's easier said than done. I think the crash continues and stays that way. Rip

People should learn the difference between realized and unrealized gains/losses
I might have made a loss, but I discovered reddit and now consider all you guys my friends. Praise the Lord.
If it breaches 7k it is going to 5k very quickly. If it breaches 5k it is going very close to 0. Been predicting this for weeks. Been in cash and a few "safe" coins. We are watching the death of BTC. Not FUDing. I implore anyone still holding on to think about your position and readjust it accordingly. All the buy walls are crumbling. I just dont see where the support is. I have read at 7k the miners are in trouble. It is going to be bad this week.
This is not good, even as a long hold. Could take years to recover tbh
Always ask yourself, what is the motivation behind what someone is telling you. 

All these posts saying "get out while you can" spreading the FUD, clear hidden agendas IMO

Brush it off and stick to your own plan, think for yourself and don't make snap, rash decisions that you will later regret. 

Just sayin
People keep asking what is "bitcoin's fundamental value".

This is an unanswerable question.  There is no "fundamental value" - it's entirely dependent upon the market psychology at any given moment.  It's definitely not like a hard asset that produces a revenue stream.   It's not like a company that makes something and has an EBITDA and growth rate that can be analyzed.  It's not even like a commodity like oranges, or pork bellies, or oil that has an end user consumer and is a market based on demand for the asset itself.  It's not the least bit like gold that has desirable physical properties that make it useful for things.   

The value is only based on what people will pay for it, and they're only deciding what they will pay for it based on what they think they can get for it down the road.  The "value" fluctuates all the time.  

If we had a super computer, and could program it with a zillion variables that determine it's "intrinsic value" almost all of them would change as it approaches that value.  It's a little like the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in this regard.  

The market for bitcoin is 100% psychology - there are no fundamentals.

Play wisely.  
I think we are in or have passed the "capitulation or anger" phase of the market cycle. It could probably drop a little bit more before the upswing again but we at or close to the bottom. 
People complain because they buy at ath, people complain because Bitcoin is falling and is too cheap. 

People will complain. 
What are the smart people in the room saying about the bottom?   Where is it?
Fellas, set alerts and get on with your life. Trust me.
I saw something pretty interesting yesterday. The 15 min graph and 2hr graph looked identical. https://imgur.com/a/Rg2pa/

I bought bitcoin in 2012 and sold at the end of 2013. I didn't hit the big upswing (1k+) but i made a profit. I sold my bitcoins since i didn't think the currency would be used on an everyday basis. So i just waited for the hype and tried to get out in time. Turns out, i got out way too early. 

However, i just don't get how people time and time again posts on reddit/boards with phrases like "buy now since there are only 21mil!", "in a few years everyone will use bitcoin so if you buy early you make profits". 

Bitcoin is probably the biggest bubble we will ever have. 
I don't think it will be adopted by the masses and even IF that starts too happen, i think the governments will step in. Big time. 

And honestly, why would it be adopted by the masses? The ones who got in first, and big, are the ones that benefit from it. Why would the majority of the people in the world buy something just to make transactions? That's absurd. 

The technology has a future while Bitcoin, sadly, does not. 
Bitcoin will be $999 in a couple months. Why? Why not is the real question.

12 months ago Bitcoin was $1k.  

Tell me Bitcoin believers has the product gotten 20000% better in the last 12 months? 
this whole up and then down is highly fishy. all coins up and then all coins down. is this just bots trading ? i am wondering. simply no logic. not based on news, good or bad.
wanna buy bitcoin. vely stable. good quality

BTC sitting precariously on the daily 200 MA. Humpty dumpty sat on the wall...
The powers that be may want to crash it on superbowl sunday to draw maximum attention and make sure no one ever touches anything but good ole fiat ever again. Lol fUd
anyone calling a stockmarket crash? because like it or not its all connected.
If this isn’t scripted then I’m just super dumb.

Why would you dump it specially today when it is low? Last night or a few days ago it reached 9k+ hovering there for a while and all of a sudden when it was starting to slowly go down they decided to dump in bulk?
big money weeding out weak hands! they want us early adopters out of BTC. in a year we will see new ATH out of any imaginations.
Halfway Through?

https://redd.it/7umjf9
When lambo? When moon? 
Most people who are critical towards Bitcoin see it only as it is today and base their reasoning for why it won’t succeed on what Bitcoin is today.

They see it as a finished product, when in reality, it’s software that can and will be developed over time to overcome problems. Bitcoin is like the internet in the early 90’s.

Another fallacy is thinking that in order for Bitcoin to be successful, it has to replace national currencies all together. This is just too unrealistic and will never happen. There is no reason it can’t coexist with fiat.

That being said, who the fuck knows how it will play out? Nobody.

Hi all, new here, not new to bitcoin. What are your targets for buying the dip? 
mean while the battle to hold 8k continues
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvwQaoEB2Nw
GUYS IT WILL HOLD SUPPORT.  The Traders are playing their games but they will not let it break 7500/8k.  Sorry if you missed out on buying Bitcoin at 3k or 5k., i know you are sad, go get a hug and hopefully you can come to the realization that these prices are a GIFT.  We are living through History in the making.  Its awesome and so much fun.  Be thankful that you even have a position, as its still less than 3% of the population.  This is a CULTURAL TREND that is UNSTOPPABLE. 
Hi all, 

I have a significant amount of bitcoin (~10) in a paper wallet (the actual private key is printed on a piece of paper). To improve security measures and possibly sell forked coins, I would like to transfer the funds to a new address.

I understand the technical procedure - sweep the private key into a wallet software and send to the new address. But what security aspects should be considered?

Some online resources recommend myCelium, but while I am cautious I do not trust my Android devices to be free of malware. I plan on using a PC with a Live CD linux distro (e.g. Ubuntu) installed on a fresh USB disk. What wallet and withdrawal procedure would you recommend? Does the Electrum Cold Storage feature has any benefits for a one time transaction?

Thanks!
Price has to go lower so coinbase can recover all the dust btc they have
All wallets should have dollars to exchange for all other currencies. If the btc falls, it is no one else's fault. If we had dollars in all the exchanges, other currencies would have not fallen.
I love the idea of BTC, but its time to get up or down by it self.
Bittrex anounces that they will work with dollars, time to others take the same action.
By the grafics, we can see that the BTC will get better tomorrow, but we cannot depend on that to have other coins down down and down.
Happy sunday for all.

How much do you guys think the whole Robinhood adoption will actually effect the price?
Rumors of total market cap of crypto testing 300 billion before rebounding.   I personally think that's unlikely, but be prepared for it mentally
Will we see any futures at play again in the near future? 
Your trading skills will be further tested during this phase than on bull runs. Make the most out of it. 

Here's my take on BTC and friends at my TradingView account.

https://www.tradingview.com/u/trissjacob/
We need to HODL folks, otherwise if more ppl sell and cash in there will be solvency issues in the exchanges...
[deleted]
So I missed the day we had CPAs answering questions. I'm trying to figure out how to handle my Bitcoins and other cryprocurrencies. Am I supposed to use a 1099 or 8949? I used Bitcoin.tax and uploaded my coinbase and gdax transactions from 2017 and it generated an 8949 form, not a 1099.
Should I buy bitcoin now since it is lower than 8,000?
Which worldwide exchange represents the BTC market best?

Also I had found a site once that listed the top exchanges by volume but I can't find it anymore. Does anyone have a link?

A bit tired to see always the same things for years, its going u its "to the moon" and down "I quit i'm disgusted".
It's part of the game to have down times.
Stop to worry like that, i wont predict anything to not influence, but i'm really, really not affraid of future.;) I have loss too with BTC i bought earlier, i'm holding them.And i still buy new ones. Please no crying wall here stay strong.As someone said yesterday, its the fight against crypto and Govts, its just the beginning and in my mind we are resisting well.
Be ready guys ;)

If that support at 7000 falls down like a joke it will be quite scary.
Bye 7k, it was nice knowing you!
There was supposed to be some support at 7000 ...
Holy moly! Look at that green candle!

The owners of Bitfinex/Tether are fraudulent as they account for most of the world's cryptocurrency trading volume, while convincing the world that it was actually the world buying bitcoin the whole time
I just bought another 200 euro worth.
This is just Bitcoin giving us another chance to buy more cheap Bitcoin!!!!

Stop crying, get some money and buy Bitcoin. 

buy at 8000, sell at 9500, buy at 7500, hold. Thank me later.
Just saw a collective 1,200 BTC in back-to-back buy orders on Bitfinex.

Whales buying in, you should too.
Guys This is the WAR stage.  This has happened before at 3k and 5k and lots more below those prices before i was involved.  This is what will prove that this is the support.  The Charts can not explain this..., Its bloody out there.  Send out the FREQUENCY that you believe in this.   Ignore anything else.  Believe like its your FAITH.  Do not be SCARED.  NO FEAR!!!!!
I sold last year at $800 


I hope it fucking plummets so I can get back in 
5k here is come!!!!!!
I bought BTC when it was at $400, do you think it will crash to $400 again so I can buy more?
is that someone buying with 2000 BTC on bitfinex? stand your ground fella.. stand your ground.
Bitcoin has never been a bubble. With the world awash in trillions of unbacked dollars  some speculate that the true value of gold is actually worth $50,000 per ounce. Gold is manipulated by virtual supplies that don't actually exist. I surmise that a finite circulating supply of 21 million btc would justify prices in excess of 20k and beyond. 

Once again, prices are relative to the amount of unbacked currencies that been have injected into the global financial system at a staggering pace. 
[deleted]
guys the more hateful/FUD posts you see from bitter people that sold @ a loss and/or no coiners, the closer we are to the bottom of this crash. keep calm, hodl on and buy cheap btc ;)
Who's buying this dip? xD any cash left anyone?
Total crypto life.  I start businesses and startups for a living.  I vow to support crypto purchase options for every product I build and sell for the rest of my life.  And I will give discounts for transacting with crypto as well.  FUCK FIAT RUN BY CENTURY OLD FAMILIES LIKE THE FEDERAL RESERVE.
I'm pretty sure we're seeing an uptick in price because Philly fans aren't online to buy high and sell low. Let's take advantage of this.
This isnt to spread fud but for the sake of saving whats left of your money guys we lost the fight 7k is not going to hold for long, the bear market is in for how long?? idk but its here and we need to accept the reality of our situation i suggest waiting till march before coming back to the market hopefully by then most of the bloodshed will stop i wish the best of luck to all those still in the game remember crypto isn't going to die but the moon has set and one day it will rise again... 
usd tax returns incoming?
This is nothing. 20k and 7k are basically the same in exponential scale. After five or ten years, who cares if you started your hodling at 700 or 2000, or 7 versus 20, or 0.7 versus 2. In physics like this, they are basically the same. Please stop crying. No one is here for trivial 1.4x or 2.5x gains or losses. The target is 140x, 250x, 1400x or 2500x etc. This is bitcoin. It's all or nothing. And we all know that. That's why we're here. I'm not saying please hodl because it obvious that every rational and irrational person is here for hodling anyway.
There’s a hearing on February 6th. Any ideas on how that will affect the market? Seems like they will discuss the monitoring of fraudulent activities etc., which would be good for the consumers in the long run. Any thoughts?
We are going to have one more huge dip to 5K then we will go high there's to much money to gain in this market, people are greedy.
Ok Bitcoin can or cannot be a Bubble... For me, the bitcoin is great, with great technology, and everybody says is backed on anything, I disagree on that, bitcoin is backed by trust, by a new kind of financial system that is totally new and we didn't even start to use the potential of it... bitcoin is going to be the Gold who is backing all the other crypto like gold/oil do for fiat... And that doesn't mean the fiat is going to end or disappear or the financial system is going to be replaced, sooner or later the big whales are going to have all the majority of the coins because they have strong hands, they have the means, they control governments, the media, and banking system, and they always win...  So, in the worst possible case I can lose 100% of investment (really doubt), but in other and we can make 2x; 4x; 10x; 100x; %, I'm going to ask you sincerely, Don't worth the risk to put that extra coin on crypto and hold to it?? 
This is definitely coordinated attack on price of bitcoin. You see a price below certain point and just as it drops a sell wall shows up with 50 btc. Somebody wants a price down.
I'm not a conspiracy theorists, but it feels as though they're is a high correlation bw govt and companies within releasing statements timely. to keep negative news flowing about cryptoassets. 
Looks like the bitcoin prediction is ....patriots will win today.  Yesterday i said if it was green eagles win.  If red, pats win.  We will see.

Rejected once again on 7700 :)

If Bitcoin goes to around 6500 I will be able to triple my alt coin holdings, assuming they keep following bitcoin movements. But don't know if I should be this greedy, and instead buy now. Will we see sub 7000?
Here's my amateur prediction: We bottom out around 6.3k and reversal begins in about a week. In early March, we break out of the major down trend from 19k. Too optimistic? https://www.tradingview.com/x/9KJnCKDs/
No one will ever carry around a cell phone when there's a pay phone on every corner.

No one will ever buy things online because they prefer to see them in person.

Bitcoin won't succeed because it isn't backed by a government.

#History has a funny way of repeating itself.
And now, the end is near; and so I face, the final curtain. My Friends; I'll say it clear, I state my case, of which I'm certain.........And through it all when there was doubt, I ate it up. And spat it out...........you know the rest......By the way, I'm holding, so should you.
WTF is happening. Not again this is never ending.I want my lambo. Please rise so I can go shopping. I give up l go and hang myself 
Pull your huggies up gents. 

Now is the time to buy more. 

I really wish everyone wondering about BTC price would realize one simple fact.  Since well before the $20k surge in December, the market has been propped up by Tether.  Like it or not, now that the Feds and everyone else have caught on, Tether will no longer be "printing" 1 million Tethers every single day.  Crash to 5000 is imminent, and it will stay there until something PERMANENT is done about Tether and BitFinex.  Meanwhile, general population's trust in Crypto will take a very LONG time to recover.  If you want to be mad at someone, be mad at BitFinex and it's Tether ponzi scheme.  
On one of the discords, people are saying that it might be regulations same as in Korea for the US.

Anyone else think Bitcoin will be a safe haven for all the people losing their shirts in the stock market today?
Wow, first message I post here and all I get is "simple this, simple that, do the maths, don't invest" blah blah blah.

I think people need to realise they were once at that stage asking dumb and irrelevant questions.

Well done to you for being a pro in this cryptocurrency and trading world but no need to be an ass about it.

I have not invested a single penny and I am not planning to do so for a while.

Stop assuming.

There will always be weak hands in investing. That’s how whales and strong hands make money. What people are forgetting is the whole reason why most “smart” investors got into crypto. It’s not going anywhere. The tech will only get better guys, and so will the value. Hodl!!!!
My magic ball says we ll be 10K in a few hours! Dont be afraid and holdddddd
NO RISK NO PROFIT ! just HOLD ! all the bad news and BS will stop and again price will go up i think April/May. Nothing can stop BTC
Here comes the lipstick....
Am I allowed to post a YouTube link that has to do with Bitcoin in this sub?
I'm not even worried. 
I don't understand saying that Bitcoin has the fundamental problem based off of this dip/crash when every other cryptocurrency is going through the same thing.  Is it just that Bitcoin is by far the most well known crypto so it gets the brunt of criticism?
Bears aren't budging, but Russia is waking up and they're buying.
Better buy now...it's going back up to 9k-10k by the end of today
So many idiots "predicting" bitcoin will go down on the way down.
Been awhile since we've had such a good day to buy!

I think these dips are healthy for long run. 
Everyone is panic selling again! Stop!
Buy the dip
Every day is another opportunity to collect more Bitcoin :)
Us banks lose $100 for every dollar that is withdrawn. So they must try to kill the infant in the cradle.

This is a classic dip before an ATH. We are just in the early stages of drawing a cup. We’ll draw a handle soon and hit $21000 before the end of next week. Classic fibonacci...1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21....8k tonight, 13k at some point midweek and 21k by the end of the week. Show me the money, show me the lambo.
So lets say I buy, and then the price crashes to 1000, what happens to the value of my coin? Is it at a negative value? Sorry if this is REALLY stupid for me to ask.  
  
  
 STUPID GUY EDIT: My god fellas, don't bend me over that fast...
I bought bitcoin at about 17k on its way up. Am I worried? No. I believe in the technology and I believe believers will be rewarded handsomely. I bought it on my credit card through Coinbase and had planned the repayments would be paid out of bitcoin profits. First payment due in a couple of weeks and I believe we will start to rise up before then. If we don’t, I can always sell a little bit of the crypto to make the minimum payment.
mkay, I'm gonna give you one of the main reasons the price continues to drive down per a psychic vision.

Amazon is going to announce using BTC (as seen late last year rumors) late summer this year. They are purchasing BTC before the announcement so when they announce and it skyrockets like never before they got their share that will equal trillions. Poo-poo if you like but I'm usually 75%+ accurate. Announcement end of July with implementation in Spring 2019.

I have $800 invested since 16-14-17-10k and I will Hodl. This will be at least $1m. McAfee said that. 
Just throwing this out there, people are much more financially conservative this tine if year because of taxes. They are thinking about money more consciously and thus probably wont invest as much. However, come tax refund time, im sure we will see cryptos pick up.

And it looks like 8k had a lot of support :) for now :)

I bet the weak hands are going to buy back in at a higher price this time when it recovers. When it comes back up it’ll be pretty clear that it’s holding steady.
While I hope that blockchain technology and crypto currencies will have a future, I honestly hope that Bitcoin will drop to $0.

This community can be absolutely horrible and I don't want to see the succes being driven by a bunch of angsty,  precocious, delusional, holier-than-thou memelords. 


This place could have been so awesome, but the attitude here has really scared me away from investing.

Any educated guess what the bottom will be? Waiting for the right moment to buy in.
1 month of -ve news, bashing by bunch of ones. And the use and support falls ...which was onlything attached to it to back it up. Hope it changes.

OK, that was fun. Time go back up.
Last chance to buy low, we are going for 8k..
This is the beginning of the climb!! New ATH by the end of the Super Bowl!!
Yay all you sellers can keep putting your value into banks and governments that can shut you down and confiscate your value whenever the fuck they want.  Enjoy!
HODL Today I found this in my University gruop: 

[...something like that, actually the term used is mine.

Anyway I have already move on, the fashion was when 20 USD  =1 BTC, but today the price is much lower. And I do not think it will go back to that price.]
