Daily Discussion, April 25, 2018
OMG.  The last time we saw the price of bitcoin this low was yesterday evening.
Just threw $100 into btc. I know it’s not much but I’m new and wanna see what it does... learn how the apps work and what not... any advice?
The last two times the price plummeted like this we later found out it was a whale selling btc in 50 million dollar increments.  It wasn't futures market related, and it wasn't a macro U.S. tax day approaching sell.  Both times the market shook it off and continued its climb back up.
Just bought .03270172 of BTC since I don't think we're falling out of the 9,000 mark. If we do, well I'll just buy some more :). My goal is to have one full bitcoin before 2018 ends. Wish me luck.
finally on the front page again
To those of you who are worried about today’s dip, let’s put things into perspective. In November 2017, when prices were still around 10-11k, this is what we saw between Nov 28 and Dec 2.

https://i.imgur.com/vW3BIa1.jpg

The price fluctuated between 11.2k and 9.5k in a matter of a few days. It fully recovered and resumed its ascent.

This general pattern repeated itself several times during the bull run up to 20k. If you are trading, sure, take advantage of the dip, but to anyone thinking this is Mayday, try to put things into perspective, and realize that we can’t go up daily ad infinitum. Price corrections are healthy and necessary. The market needs to breathe. Don’t panic (unless  you’re in super high leverage with no cover :)
"REFORM THE LINE!" ~ King Theoden
Why are people fucking panicking? Upward growth with no correction is incredibly unhealthy. Just chill out and do something else and don't watch the price.
4 months in and still 40% down. I’d say I’m enjoying the ride but that would be a lie. 
The only positive thing out of this is that we will see Vegeta meme again.
Are we happy to float around $9k for a day or two?
That moment you realize big money, and not people holding .5 coins chanting 'hodl', controls the market. 
Don't panic folks, we expected a pull back around $10k, let us see how today pans out first.  We have still made lots of progress over the last few weeks.  Peace. 
Anyone else sell around 9400 and buy back in around 9700 yesterday? Fml, I shoulda waited like I usually do for the dip but the FOMO got to me when 10k was so close but so far away
GDAX is $200 below any other exchange, weak hands af
How are we down today with this Nasdaq news...the fact that they are open to becoming a crypto exchange at some point is huge news, no?
Hold the McAffee Dick Line at all costs!

I went all in yesterday

I am currently down on my initial investment 5&#37;

Might buy some more fuck it

#YOLO
I don’t actually see a lot of panic posts but sooo many “why is everyone panicking” posts lol projection 
Even in a bull run there will be bearish days, don't be alarmed over 1 bad day, if you try to time out the market you'll likely miss out on gains, just sit tight and you'll be fine in the long run
Waiting for 9K memes 
**Keep going Bulls.**
I know we are striving for decentralization and idealogs like Antonopoulos feel its worth the wait but human beings are well, human beings. They rarely give more than 3-4 chances. Fees need to be low. Lightning needs to grow significantly bigger. How do we get there by August? 
Why is it going down so much? Complete opposite of yesterday...
You all have very short memories (I call it digital dementia) A couple of weeks ago it was at 6.8k. It drops down to 8.5 after a pump and everyone freaks the fuck out. If it drops below 6.5k then there is a real reason to FREAK THE FUCK OUT. 
By the way. Sometimes people just wanna buy and sell shit. If someone makes a big dump- guess what?People are BUYING IT.
Remember when bitcoin was supposed to be a currency rather than a speculative investment?
Just want to do a shout out to Europe here. 

Thanks for nothing dudes. My grandma does more volume than you guys. And she died ten years ago.
So many newbies on this feed. Check BTC on the way up to $20k in December and every other day there was $1,000 dips 
Back by popular demand.....

**Come On The Bulls.**
One thing is for sure. Bitcoin traders are a bunch drama queens. Even worse than SAT divers. 
welp, time to bring out the ramen again.
[deleted]
**Come On Bulls!** 
So a third of the progress made in the last eighteen days has been lost in a few hours. Nice.
Dumping like a mothafucka....
**Come On Bulls!** 
Whales' theme song:

"This Is How We Do it"
Bitfinex is almost at 9k again, while gdax is at 8750 lol
This looks like a shakedown for weekhands
Coinbase FOMO unravelling once again.
The whole trade is very chaotic. Big price difference among different exchanges and huge fluctuations. No one has any fucking idea what’s gonna happen next. 
It was all a manipulation to shake out weak hands. It'll be back to 9500k by the end of the day. 
its always up, then gone down, then up & down :D stop caring, enjoy your life for a while :D
Just remember: Time in the market beats timing the market.

Think long term. If you act short term, you might make a lot of money, but it's more likely that you will get rekt.
Vegeta is coming again....
Here we go again...
9k for the 6th time, lel.
Prepare the 9k memes ... Just saying :)
Seems like sentiment has changed for the better. We’ve been from 11k back to 6ish not too long ago. Then it was pretty much straight down. Now it seems we turn old resistance into new support. 

So let’s see if we can get to 12k before the next significant dip. (If today’s dip is over I don’t consider it significant in crypto terms)
1 day chart and 15 min chart on GDAX looks reeeeally similer
come on ASIA, wake up and start the pump!
130 million Tether have been minted today.

Ffs why did I buy at 9.5 fully knowing I should wait and that was hasty 
I’m not veteran of anything really except sleeping and waking up but I’ve bought and sold BTC 3 times. I’ve sold when it’s nit high enough every time.  Gotta hold on.  
At 3:00 am Eastern time there is usually a reversal. 
Good morning Europe!

What are your plans for today?
This is a bear trap. Going up again...

Edit: Or maybe not...
[deleted]
Goddam it's depressing in here, This can still turn around, we only lost 2 days of gains.
It doesn't matter whether or not BCH is superior to BTC. The deception going on with the way it is promoted is unethical and bad for crypto as a whole. Would the words "scam," "fraud," or "misleading" inspire confidence in new investors or adopters in this technology? I'm pretty new to this, so in would say as a newbie in the game, it definitely brings me feelings of uncertainty.

Edit: grammar
This all started with a $200-$300 jump within 10 minutes, what were you really expecting? You’d think after these last few months more people would have developed a healthy amount of skepticism lol 
I would have sold my bitcoin, except:

1. I believe in it, apart from making a profit.

2. I realized it's way easier to buy altcoins with than USD.

3. It has a great record of going up in value long term. Though I think annual gains can't be as extreme as it's been (if it continues the way it has it'll be worth the entire world's real estate in 8 years), it'll still increase long term in value, probably better than most stocks.

4. If I hold USD long term I KNOW FOR A FACT it will lose value over time. Even in a savings account.

Having said that, If I were one of those people that took out a $40,000 credit card and needs the value to exceed 10K or they'll go bankrupt... I might consider selling, as there's no guarantee it will exceed 10K real soon.
Just get your cheap coin while you can imo
Damn ,gotta cancel my lambo order again (sademoji)
No exchange or wallet provider has deployed Segwit support in several weeks. Coinbase tried but failed. WTF?

Still at 22 deployed: https://bitcoincore.org/en/segwit_adoption/

You have seen square pump\-and\-dumps \(the Bart\), so to spice things up, here are triangular ones \(the Lisa\).
Random observation of the day; when I see whales stocking up on certain altcoins after a sizeable bitcoin fall, I know where my bets will be. The price sure may drop some more still, but I am not going to venture out in the wrong direction when bulls hit the streets.

View

**Bitcoin remains on the hunt for a bullish break above the $10,000 mark.**

There is a risk of a pullback to $8,650-$8,600 in the short-term.

Only a close below the ascending 10-day MA at $8,671 would abort the short-term bullish view.
The battle happening at 8800 right now is intense!
Damn i really gotta stop playing with my buy orders, shoulda held for the dip! 
I had a feeling this would happen.  Went up too fast.  Slow and steady finishes the race eventually. On the bright side, my money will be transferred soon and I can BTFD. 
Get Vegeta memes ready....
This shit is swinging too fast. Its like a hot knife on rampage. 
And we're back
9k :D

Pump dat pump!!!!
Lol the 24h Volume on BTC/GBP on gdax is over 800! Usually it's 2-300! The weak are selling!

Remember guys, don't put in more than you can afford to lose, stay safe and may the luck of the spooky skeleton be with you!
How many of those power reader google glasses things has Vegeta broke by now?
This new reddit theme takes some getting used to
Fancy a good laugh?

Vegeta, whats bitcoin price?
855-875-cash. Buy the dip! Lol
I really don't see it falling too far.  wouldn't make sense to drop much lower than 8700-ish
Is this considered a dip or a crash?  Being it has went down around $850 dollars since yesterday.
This just in....... Bitcoin is Volatile. *gasp* 
Right now the seller side is like "No nine thousand for you!"
http://www.livebitcoinnews.com/gemini-teams-up-with-nasdaq-to-monitor-market-for-abusive-trading-practices/

I leave it to you guys to decide what will happen when Gemini/Nasdaq starts to detect and publicise all the obvious price manipulations on bitfinex, binance, etc.

Don't forget it was the Winklevoss that earlier called for a formal investigation into Tethers.
Just got off the phone with the lambo dealer and told him my down payment wouldn’t be ready til next month.  “Thats funny” he said, 5 others just called and said the same thing.
**Come On America and the Rest Of The World, let us keep this at around $9400 for today!**
Why can't it just keep going up every day? Like Burger King, I want it my way. If it doesn't go to 10k by week's end,  then I'm selling it all. I will then proclaim that everyone vested in crypto is a fool and that Bitcoin is dead. Waaaaaaahh!
ever seen the walls so thin on both sides? this is a shakedown kiddos before we rocket, you sold you lost
9k!

Where are the Vegeta memes?
And another dump. So much for it having a decent recovery before closing.
It dropped because I bought, just wait a few days until I get FUD and sell, then it will spike.
I see. Thanks for the explanation.
Yeah. This isn't looking good as usual after a nice run up. Maybe next month. McAfee is totally wrong with his $1,000,000 estimate lol.

It'll stop going down at 8.2k. I'm basing this off nothing. Just a naive prediction.
Just ordered two kilograms of vegeta from my local grocery store. 
You're all so short-term it's hilarious, zoom out to the year scale you autists.
**What a great time to be alive, Banks imploding and Bitcoin ascending.** 
On your knees 😏
I bought the dip. Good luck to you all.
all that progress thrown awayy 
anyone got the 8888.88 memes?
So who here fell for the obvious bull trap?
I aint sellin!!!! hodl
I suppose last Friday of the month is near :(
What the heck is going on
Spaceships or clown costumes anyone?
Wait an hour or two until east coast joins the party, they decide where we're heading.
I'm hoping some of the pull back is a bear trap.  I was kind of hoping we would atleast hold around $9400-$9500.

**Come On Bulls, don't throw this all away!**
Weird thing about bitcoin price dropping...

It causes altcoin prices to drop immediately in value... 

Which causes altcoin holders to want bitcoin or USD, thereby increasing the value of bitcoin.
Zomfg, last time to buy under 9152 since it’s the limp dick Fibonacci Lin e
I sent some BTC last night:
txid: 891ef41a7a056120b615191386b69199877d456957f6174439d4f737e8e7ab12

first time it's ever sat unconfirmed like that. I know in 2 weeks I'll probably get it back if miners don't mine it but is there a way to speed up the transaction at all?
So is there any chance it's going to get back to at least 9500 today?
What are y'all forcasting those of you who are pretty good at reading the charts
7d  14d and 30d  look awesome  still
I sent some BTC to Binance about 1 hour ago, sent from a ledger nano selecting the normal fee, nothings been confirmed yet, anybody tried sending lately? 

wondering if i'm going to have to wait a few hours or days until it gets confirmed, I figured I would have been ok using the normal fee, I sent another one with (high fee) to make it go faster, stressful when my coins floating around the blockchain! 
Funnily enough the Alts have stopped falling. Some time ago. 
we still up, still have moving average crossed on 1d.
 hill before the mountain 
I feel like Cleveland, watching Bitcoin slip below 9k this morning...

lol, Murica full retard. 
RIP 
wow lol 
well lets hope 8.4k holds. Otherwise its real deep penetration to 7.8 then 6.8-6.5k
$1000 drop in 12 hours; can't make this stuff up. I love you, Bitcoin. 
ohhh shit here we come 8600
Here come the panic sellers, bit late to sell now people. Best of luck though. 
I'm taking screenshot now of the top comments, then I'll take another when btc stops falling. It's just amazing how the same people can change their minds so fast.
Problem with smart contracts? LETS DUMP BITCOIN >.> silly
what the fuck just happened? it's below $8k? 
Big red dildo for that a hole
Hey fellas, coming back for a little Live Bitcoin Price action update and perhaps some live trading sprinkled in if the opportunity arises. Open discussion format for anyone interested.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6\_WRBC9qQE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_WRBC9qQE)
What the hell happened? 😨
Does anyone know what's the normal transaction fee now? 
Put 7 satoshies per byte (total fee 2$ something dollars) for a quite big transaction, it's been unconfirmed for over 1 hour now.

The fuck is everyone whinging about lol
Funny how it drops during us market open.
PUMP
[deleted]
Wish I could say I thought this was the last time bitcoin would have to push past 9k...but let’s be real it probably isn’t. I do think that day is rapidly approaching though
And back under 9k.
Any reason for the mempool growing so large?  Have an unconfirmed from this morning when 2 sats was a reasonable fee!
I can't believe it - the alts are pumping again.

Very strange market behaviour.
Go to sleep Vegeta
5:00am in Tokyo. 

Some people wake up early, check the price and think: Wow! Cheap coins. Buy, buy, buy!
6:20am in Tokyo *and* Seoul.

Asians start to FOMO.
Upside down Bart formation?
hodl on !
My equity is up 6% in the last 2 or 3 hours, so I think we can presume things are starting to turn. 
HOLD (anag.)
Yea can we just pin vegeta to the top of this sub. Saves us posting him like 3 times a week ay
First ipad 2010. 
want 2 b my roommate? I Think you really need 1
Slight correction overseas. America's east coast is waking now. Hope we can take it near 10 today.
Below 9k AGAIN. Yay!
I just sold the shit I've been hodling since January when I got it when it was 15k (I didn't buy I just receive payments in it). Whole 2017 I've fucking sold the same hour I received and was butthurting remembering how April 2017 I've sold 2 BTC for some shitting 2 thousands or so. Then all of the sudden I decide to hodl in January and here we are now... 

But I've sold all of it (I need money anyway this month, so probably it wont hit 10k in April again), so expect ALL TIME HIGH knowing my luck. You welcome guys

I just hate that I didn't sold 12 hours ago at 9700 :(
Literally no reason to be holding now
Whales know how to set up bear traps on land. The end is near folks. Hide yo kids and wives.
What in the actual fuck?
This is just discount.
HODL?
Thank you America!  
HODLers right now: https://fearlessliving.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/2-free-fall.jpg

Hope we find somewhat support at 9k. Otherwise there’s a real chance to go to 8.8 then 8.4k. I’m getting real tired of being dragged back into the butthole.

Obviously thats where everyone likes to be. This is retarded.
rip 9000 lol
RIP 9k
I can handle a slight pull back but this is taking the piss! 
You guys all got jebaited. The price is too easily manipulated by the whales.
lol last night i sold everything and just got back in I knew a 2 week streak had to be corrected at some point. Next bull run is gonna be even better.
Well I guess Asia started waking up about an hour ago. 
There is again heavy resistance at the cock gobble line of resistance. Macaffee is on track to cannibalize his cock on tv in about 30 months.
I ain’t selling lol fuhhhhhh dat
TIMBER!!
All gains destroyed....or is it; sucked up. This sucks! People can put whatever trap, resistance support, whale or wall label they want to on it. It unfortunately is what it is.
It was pumped to dump. Get used to it dropping.
Last chance to sell before 5k
[deleted]
Look on the bright side. You can all post your 'over 900' memes again in a month
Told you guys to get out while you can, gonna be buying around 5k
As Professor Frink would say: "Oh, glayven!"
good to go down, chance to come in again ..... discount
Come On New York!  
F**K and I believed in 10k in next few days.
Should've sold on 9700
[deleted]
this is not correction ..this is panic sell ...any bad news? why this huge dip 
9k soon, get ready to celebrate.
Bitcoin is the best way to purchase:

Blockchains

It's not true that it's not good for buying things. 
LAST CHANCE FOR CHEAP BITCOIIN
After consulting my crystal ball, if the price continues to increase (closing doesn't need to be in the green) and the lower candlestick is as long, or longer, as it is now then that signifies a bullish trend.

Oh MT. Gox moved some BTC... About 2k..

Why are they still allow to sell?
8690 and falling :(

Any guesses folks for the bounce?
First?
Entire rally was on the back of the short squeeze back at 6.8k so we will be returning there to carry on the downtrend
This is honestly so fucking pathetic for bitcoin lol.
Oh noes. BTC price prediction: $800 EOY

Sold at 9700 and made a nice profit, anyone who thought it wouldn’t be bouncing around the 9000s for a few days before 10k was delusional

What’s Bitcoins utility? How do you guys se it being used in 10-20 years?
