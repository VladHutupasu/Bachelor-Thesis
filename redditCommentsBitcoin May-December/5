Bitcoin: Doing random shit that makes no sense since 2018
Thats literally the Perfect bart simpson weve ever had
Well I guess i'm happy, thought when I woke up we would less than 8k.  
Forecasts of 50k-60k by the end of the year seem to be impossible to me because btc should gain 8k per month then.

We are in the late 80's currently.  It's a thing, it works, no one knows exactly what to do with it, but those in the know are sure it is revolutionary.  A lot of well intentioned people are using it to make things, most of them are objectively useless.  Piles of unscrupulous people are using it to rip other people off in one way or another. Many people see no reason not to just use the phone book instead. It is difficult to use for the average person, but by no means impossible. Somewhere right now someone is being introduced to it. 
Anyone with any doubts about Bitcoin needs to read this thread from 4 years ago:

Same FUD different year.  The more I educate myself on Bitcoin and its history, the stronger my conviction that it will substantially continue to increase in value over time.

Hello everyone and welcome to Pump and Dump Festival 2018.  

Idk whatâ€™s most volatile, the Kilauea volcano, North Korea, Megan Markleâ€™s family, or bitcoin.
This is painful.
I see Bart everywhere!
This market is whack, just stay on the sidelines folks. I am a very active trader and HOLDER in a long term position. This action isn't worth trading. Let the bots fuck themselves 
4pm in New York lets move on from this Concensus gathering.  Hopefully, when these big companies and organizations go back to the drawing board Monday they will decide to invest.  
Just some thoughts on the current state of the market. Is it possible that we have reached a point where all the weak hands have been shaken out and only hodlers, bears, and people timing the market are left? Hodlers greatly outnumber everyone else hence the insanely low volume maybe? Thus this creates a situation where a single whale can pump the market and then dump once others pile on some time later for profit? I think this would explain all the "Barts." 

The people that FOMOed last year aren't going to come back unless they see/hear that Bitcoin is hitting all time highs again. This is where the institutional money comes in. They need to be buying this shit up to put the price in a good place to get people to want to buy up that normally wouldn't be in this. Whales need to think more long term and not keep fucking us and themselves long term.
Be patient. All in due time. The tech is there. The companies and partnerships are coming in. Don't expect to get rich like people who got in 8 years ago in just a few months. It will take time but it's a given that Blockchain and DLT are here to stay and progressing at a very rapid rate. Most of us are putting in money and just waiting to get rich. Can't be mad that it's taking a little too long lol. I actually feel like this is just a period of big money taking time and strategizing how they will use the crypto space. Wall street guys and large corporations don't just their money around. They are planning and strategizing. Too many big names coming in for crypto to fail. Not sure which coins will be the winners in the long run but we are past the days of 100 percent faith in the dollar and big banks. Strong hands will look back and be grateful they held on. And what has been happening lately is much more realistic and sustainable than December 2017. I want my gains to stay not come and go. So hopefully this is just big money waiting to pick where they want to invest and making smart decisions. I could do without the fomo pump and dumps anyway. I'll bet the gains come after consensus when everyone has heard most of the different pitches and find good entry points for coins they like.
I know the market often does itâ€™s thing for no reason but I was wondering if thereâ€™s some news or fud that is causing the recent downward trend?

lol
ouch
If we break 8400 tonight, buckle up 
think we have weathered the storm?
8400 resistance has broken!!!!!
**Support The Bulls!** 
Seriously like torture.  Iâ€™m turning it off. 
I just bought more at $8200. Damn you sweet sweet prices that appear to be the bottom. Now, let's go to the moon.
8k the new 6k?  
Bitcoin is acting weird. But I'm still optimistic for the future.
Some body just put up a big buy. Here we go I hope.
"You pumped it up, now I'll pump it down"
CBOE futures expiring today: http://cfe.cboe.com/cfe-products/xbt-cboe-bitcoin-futures  
Volume should be too low to matter, but maybe someone's testing the playing field.
Has anyone got a link to a site that shows daily volume traded for Bitcoin please?
Nice fail pump. It triggered my stop loss order almost right after triggering my stop buy order.
this market is looking worse and worse, not liking this no volume random spike up spike down. This is not good for the health of the market. As a HODLER I am worried.
If we go up from here, we will form a huge inverse head and shoulders pattern.

Moon soon. ðŸ˜‰
Still a sea of red \- and on day 3 of Consensus even. So much for Cons immediate influence on price. Too many people were hoping the worm would turn on a dime.  Consensus is good. Learning of global sentiment and how that drives markets is gooder for the new derelict's, kids and drama queens.
Just got back into coin last couple of week. Made the mistake of using Coinbase. Never again. They've had my funds on hold for nearly 2 weeks despite clearing the bank on the 7th. Customer service is beyond crap. Still no word on resolution. How is crypto going to move forward without legitimate exchanges? Serious question.
Bro 1 or 2 days of this bot shit and everyone is acting like a little bitch. Anyways what are your thoughts on what going to happen and why?
Haha buttcoin. 
What a crock of shit at the moment!  Looking like we will be going below $8k at this rate today.  :( 
Performing like hot garbage
**Creeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeptttttttttttttttttooooooooooo!**
 I'm a graduate student, currently conducting research on the cryptocurrency ecosystem and cryptocurrency exchanges.

If you have any free time, I would really appreciate your participation in my survey. I plan to share all my findings with the community once I get enough responses, thanks!

Seems like Bitcoin showed that it cant handle much transactions with low fees. The year back if anyone remember it started, it was great, then the fees fcked up all, a lot of interested peops lost faith in it...

I think in my opinion, the last year \(2017\) was the year that decided it all :\)
Bloody cheer up everyone!

Pump is coming - competitors dead.

Trust me.
I think were coming into "the crash of 2018". Years later this will be but a speck on the ytd graph. 
the daily pump. followed by the daily pump next night 
unfortunately lower highs since a few days 

life so easy for daytraders recently
Thanks for preventing my liquidation Murica, much appreciated. Damn that was close.
Although Consensus was tipped to start a bull run again, I think the fact that it's such a common "assumption" it was too easy a play for the whales/manipulators. Load up while cheap and lets hope the price is "released" and can fly soon.
This is how well people in Tokyo know about cryptocurrency.. What do you think?

Everyone seems conflicted.  The market doesn't want to rebound, but everyone is expecting it to with consensus so they're buying at any sign the price will hold at 8200 then discouraged when the price doesn't keep going.
Is possible to see my total bitcoin balance of a single wallet in a block explorer if i used a new address every time i received a transaction? Or am i understanding correctly that this is the point of not re-using wallet addresses?
Good morning, what do you folks expect to see today? 
Ya'll hate me when I talk shit, but it keeps going lower lol.
Reminds me  on that 6.8k - 7.2k pattern til wie had that short sqeeze. Lets hope for another one
Is low trading volume a problem? 
Upward popsicles 
21 Trillion US tax dollars missing, and the sheeple still eating the grass.
kissing my hopes and dreams good bye. No early financial freedom I think.
And it was going so well....all loaded up, 1&#37; to 7&#37; up already looking forward to the US picking up the momentum...

Kabam..! Everything knocked out. Heathen savages. 
How can we get to the moon?
Anyone brave enough that would care to enlighten us as to how one were to go about making short\-term profit trading in this volatile pump and dump, bot saturated marketplace called crypto? It's a joke!!!
Patience... Only one more small leg down. Then moon. ðŸŒ•

6k coming boys
The recent wedge has broken to the downside with high volume on the drops. Current channel sloping gently upwards looks like a bear flag. I would side much more with placing a short than a long at this stage with next support at 7,900.
Going down is actually a good thing. If we go down into the $7Ks, that means we will go back up after. If we go up now, we're just gonna keep having these dips, and go down.
