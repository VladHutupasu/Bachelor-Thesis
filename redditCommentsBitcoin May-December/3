Daily Discussion, May 17, 2018
I posted this in yesterday's daily before it closed, but I want to make sure everyone has a chance to read this.

I found this thread from 4 years ago.  It feels like we could be having this conversation today under our current circumstances.  Similar FUD, concerns and hopes.  I really think 4 years from now people will be looking back on our threads and wishing they had a chance to get on board the bitcoin train in 2018 when the price dipped.  Thanks to bitcoin's scarcity and the fact that there can be no more than 21 million coins, ever, I firmly believe we will see the price of bitcoin continue to grow substantially in the years to come.

Edit:  p.s. the OP in that thread is probably rich beyond his wildest dreams today.   So in other words, it‚Äôs not too late for us either.

It was definitely my 0.03 BTC buy that kept us above 8k. You're all welcome.

I hope this comment ages well but I personally find it very encouraging that we have managed to stay above $8k.  Over the last few days I was prepared for $7500 and lower so at the moment like I say I think it's encouraging that we are currently at $8300. 

Also volume is very low at the moment which suggests to me that we are getting into over sold territory and hopefully we will start going up again.  
Keep those hands strong guys! On the tech side the whole market overall is slowly but surely advancing in a healthy manner. The price will follow. HODL :D
The drama before the glory!
Seriously, cut the drama, what are you afraid of? It's hardly dipping under 6k. Nobody here's gonna lose money, just stop looking at the goddamn price and go enjoy some music or whatever. 
Have you people noticed the incredible amount of transactions which the network is now being receiving? [image](https://i.imgur.com/sS5PTq5.png)
I love these "explanations" like if you did know what was happening it would change anything.

BTC was ~2k this time last year. Yeah you bought in at 15k, tough shit. Figure out what you've "lost" and buy at least that much all the way down.

More than likely you'll be laughing all the way to the bank this time next year. 
Wow, Btc volume right now is sad. 
All it takes is one 1k push to gain excitement again. This boring weak nature is not new for ppl who have been doing this for 3 years
I expect the top today around 8300 and going down to at least 7800 this weeken. But is possible to fall to 7600\-7550. 

 We are  stuck in a 10K\-7000k range.... Wich is fine if you can keeping a coldmind, but sometimes is the hardest part. 
Y'all have any good songs to listen to while watching bitcoin crashing?
Do you all not realize that this shit ain't going to the moon sometime in the next 6 to 36 months, UNTIL nearly everyone is in the depths of despair.   That's the way it works.  Y'all are way too damn excited and happy for this gd thing to take it's natural course and crash land in the desert.  Not till then, will we have another lift off.  Your enthusiasm is dragging this shit out.
Hi friends!

If someone needs real-time tracker for new listings I built it. Over 30 major exchanges, e-mail, telegram and browser push alerts. Easy and free. You will be receiving short messages like "Kucoin lists SHL" after the trade begins. It's the part of Bitgur Alerting Service. https://bitgur.com/alerts 
Very narrow range.  Small fluctuations in quilt sales clearly keeping BTC price almost level.
We need the quilt guy to explain all this :)

Has his Mom and her friends stopped buying quilts using LN?

Send out an alert to find out, my American friends.

p.s. don't worry, all will be fine.
Defend 8k!!
Ready for take off! üöÄ
Yeah I should of went to vegas
Guys, just chill out! This despair is responsible for turning the market into shit. We are in the dawn of a new world and the old is trying (naturally) to maintain the status quo. Is not just about making money, all this is a cruzade. We are in war against the centralized world. cryptocoins is making possible to us to make a brand new start, a world where everything is descentralized, such as money, information, technology and what is most important, government.  So, our despair is just making more trouble for all of us. 

We need to think that some of the factors (i dont need to mention)that made the market going down is in direct relation to some of the biggest centralized institutions of our days, in the same way that are other factors as well, I mean: the comunnity going into panic. Yeah! Thats what they are triyng to do. So, relax and let bitcoin flows the river, the nature of human being is in our favor: technology cannot turn over, same as the river. #Foradescentralizedworld 
The thread in worldnews is cancer. Almost confirms the fact that we are still in early adopter territory.
Doesnt look good at the moment:(
Im a believer..and a hodler...but they keep ramming this 8k wall...we in trouble. reminds me of mt gox dump. small rest period. DUMP small rest DUMP
i was studying the charts earlier and noticed since bitcoin was invented it has had 2 parabolic bull markets. 2013 and 2017

in 2013 the bitcoin price run was basically 20 to 1000 or a 5000% increase. in 2017 it was much smaller at 2000% but still very much a run. 2014 also had mt gox go nuclear.  also note at the lowest point in the last bear market bitcoin never even got close to where 2013 started before the run up. the market low was found in spring of 2015 around $220 or 10x higher than the start of 2013 however it was an 80% peak to trough. after this it was an uptrend for years with corrections along the way. we had a MUCH smaller run in 2017 at only 2000% vs 5000% in 2013 and no mt gox blow up. it seems very unlikely to have a repeat as the news is actually really positive and you run into problems with the network in general below 5-6k minimum now. we also have already had a 70% correction with no where near as bad of news and no where near as big of initial run up. an 80% correction would be BTC 4k.  miners will start shutting down due to low profitability around 6k and or difficulty will have to fall....in fact that's already starting. you actually get more coin selling hashing power now than you did at this time last month. many of the dec/jan gpu miners are likely already leaving.Ôªø

the thing i noticed about all modern parabolic moves is they rarely if ever recover quickly. bitcoins massive run in 2013, the nasdaq in 1999. the thing that gets me though. both of those prior examples had real fundamental reasons that brought them down. 2017 really did not. people just sold....well. because lambo and beach house. 

if history repeats 2018 will not rally, it will simply be a consolidation year. weak hands will be shook out. difficulty may even fall on many alt coins. maybe even bitcoin. we may have seen the low at 6k and we may even test 5. going to 4 would be an absolute floor unless we are destined to go to zero. i'm sure a lot of miners would shut down. network traffic would fall. 80-90% of altcoins would die. 
 

my personal feeling is this may be a range bound year. we probably have an absolute floor at 5k and might go there if a hard attempt is made at the last 6k support. we also likely have resistance at 12k that will push back if we move through 10k. 

long term. this is healthy. weak hands are shook out and those of us who stick around will be able to mine easier and accumulate at good prices.

Just got an email that Robinhood has begun to allow crypto trading in Pennsylvania. Very exciting for me
Does anyone know how to send bitcoin from robinhood to a desktop wallet? Can‚Äôt find it in the app

Edit: maybe you can‚Äôt? Robinhood only for trading not simply buying to hodl?
Last year, after consensus ended, when did we start to see a noticable spike in Bitcoin pricing?

Ready to dumb into my 401k at this point it's made more than my Bitcoin in the last 8 months
Buying cryptocurrency is probably the worst decision of my life
My personal opinion on where we're at right now, 1) early adopters ran out of money & HODL'ing, (very little move in the market--this likely won't change anytime soon).... 2) crypto 'acceptance' enters the main stream; some hype in media about insitutional investors 'crossing the line' to get a slice of the pie, however, like a teen at their first party can't decide if they'll get in trouble with mom or dad for drinking & can't make up their mind, so, instead of downing a bunch of shitty beers with their friends, they end up getting emotional & forget to have a good time because they can't decide.  A week later, they realize their friend got laid because he down'd a fifth of soco after a 4 game run on the BP table and scored with the hot chick in his science class at the very same party...Translation, remember when your mom or dad opened a facebook account?  Yea, this might take a while.
Siberian new year sell off... no worry broz - buy zat dip! #NakamotoSAtoshiismygod #WhitePaperismybible
WHOEVER DOESN‚ÄôT HODL IS A FAG
bitcoin is going down, makes me feel like buying more...!!
Hey, Tom Lee. That was a spot-on prediction about Consensus 2018 skyrocketing the price of Bitcoin. Any other advice I should stake my life on?? 
Ya'll hate me when I talk shit, but it keeps going lower lol.
At noon I want to look and see 8600.  Again this is a want. 
We have extremelly strong support at 7900-8000! I dont afraid at all! We will soon get back >9k
I didn‚Äôt expect to see 8k again so fast.  Not bad. 

Edit:  well touched for a second anyway.  Keep going bulls!
My uncle works for Bitcoin. He says if we all buy Bitcoin the price will go up!
once again the best time to buy is now

Unluck is just a lack of solution(s). - BTC trader. (lmaooo)
Hello.  If I transfer a small amount of BTC \(‚â™ $1000\) from coinbase to a hardware wallet, am I creating a meaningful link between the two for reporting purposes?  Thanks in advance.

Fake guru are the worse. They're actually the cancer of any market. Better have none and let technology, faith, mass and curiosity lead.
What is the next price resistance? $7200?
Oh shit it's dipping! Time to buy
Same circumstance as tax day, everyone expects an immediate boom. Give it a few days;)
Day trading says I have more btc if buy now then I did 24hrs ago
[removed]
Lower highs. Higher lows:(
Sorry don‚Äôt mean to sound harsh but if you‚Äôre trading based on Reddit as market indicator you‚Äôre not going to do well. The price inevitably will go back up on its own because it‚Äôs scarce. 
Everyone needs to get there negative feelings out of this discussion nobody likes weak hands
Gotta love the Asians. They know how to start a party!
The recent 8.3k range action reminds me of the fluctuations at 6.8k when bitcoin was hovering around the last lowest floor. It was a relatively small-range oscillation over several days.

When the 9.7k price level broke down, I was mentally prepared for a new market cycle if it turned out that the range 7.7k-8.2k failed. However, at this point, I am considering the possibility that we might already have a new market cycle building up at current price levels. If that's the case, then I wouldn't be surprised to see some heavy purchases of specific alt-coins.

This is the lowest volume I have seen for Bitcoin on Binance in a long time.  Is this a good or bad thing?  Maybe half the market is in tether waiting to see the next move, I don't know.
Found this https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611153/specialized-chips-are-threatening-to-take-over-cryptocurrencies-and-they-look-unstoppable/
This whole thing is just flat out baffling. I suppose we‚Äôll hit rock bottom at 6.5k ................again.
Nice job at 8k bulls üëè
Buy buy buy hodl hodl hodl
this market is a load of crap. 2 weeks ago we were about to break 10k and now we're on the verge of dumping to 6\-7k. 
Is it bear time?
Like if you think bitcoin will likely to touch $40,000 by the end of this year. 
Thinking the profit ppl who buy now could have

Upside down Simpson spawn occurring. 
I think we have lower to go guys.  We couldn't sustain an uptrend rebound from 8.2k WITH consensus going on, expecting us to rebound again higher from here just seems naive.
Media said BTC got ranked 13th as best crypto, is this why people is selling?
Hi, I'm a graduate student, currently conducting research on the cryptocurrency ecosystem and cryptocurrency exchanges.

If you have any free time, I would really appreciate your participation in my survey. I plan to share all my findings with the community once I get enough responses, thanks!
