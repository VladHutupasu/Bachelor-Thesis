We're going to the moon, just taking the scenic rout. 
Soooo close, who wants 9 baby! 
There was a syndicated segment on the local ABC news program that talked about Arizona considering allowing taxes to be paid in Bitcoin and how Arizona wanted to become a leader in blockchain and cryptocurrency technology. 
The stock market feels like bitcoin lately.

Aaannnnndddd the DOW is still falling. Perhaps this may be significant? A few days ago BTC and the DOW appeared to be linked in some strange way. Now they're diverging. Hmmmm.
balloon 🎈 stalled at altitude of 8,600 ft. Please donate fuel to continue up. 
Funny how the doom and gloom people are so quiet right now.  C7rboN I'm looking at you.  We still going way below 6k ?    And that's why we hodl folks.
Lets get to 10k-12k range this weekend
Is it bad that I want another dip? I want to buy more before the bulls come.
Gee, it's a lot more fun watching the numbers get bigger than watching them get smaller.
Koreans gone premium means only one thing, Asians are back with a vengeance and things looking bullish
Vegeta powering up. Majin Vegeta this time. No going back. 
This line to buy Bitcoin at Robinhood is ridiculous
Its fucking happeningggg!!!!!
That 8700 wall is a real tough cookie
Any Borg around here willing to explain to that wall at $8700 that resistance is futile?
It's your turn America :) 
I think we ll see 9k today at last!!
We broke 8700 wall! Lets gooooo
Mr.Gorbachev tear down that wall

If we crack 9k, I'll eat a bowl of cereal and orange juice. 
9000 On gdax

Edit, wall fell down like bloop
Nice having a day off from crazy swings. :)
I don't understand the 'force out the weak hands' thinking. Yes I know we should all be in this for the 'technology' but why does anyone want less people using Bitcoin? 
8700 wall down!
to the moon pls
Mr. Gorbachev take down this wall!!
9000 in 3,2,1...

Currently at the sell walls....

BATTLE FOR 9000!!!!!
Europe been staying up late doing it's part now time for the next continent to put in some work :)
Is there a website that compares fees from exchanges?
How many times did we use the Vegeta 9000 meme? Felt like we used it 5x already this year
I'm second guessing if it will rise overnight

It stayed above 9k for like 10 minutes, it really lasted long but we need to slip it some Cialis and keep the party going. 🎉
Mempool has only 6k backlog wow
Someone really does not want the price to go above $8700 today. 
On Tue Feb 6th in the morning, with Bitcoin and the other Cryptos sinking to October levels (Bitcoin at $6000) I posted something of a rallying cry on here to buy and HLOD due to my love for Bitcoin as the 'people's currency' - a decentralised alternative to the totalitarian debt-based central banking slave system - more in hope than expectation bc at that moment I truly believed it was game over...And honestly, even if this is short-lived, I feel like I'm witnessing a miracle and I can't tell you how happy I am to see such a dramatic turnaround this week...RIIIIISE BTC!! BACK FROM THE DEAD HAHAAAAA :D (Queue Crash XD ..Bit drunk don't care :P)
https://www.yahoo.com/news/alleged-drunk-driver-busted-getting-153601433.html

Uh-oh. Which of you wrecked your bitLambo?
too much resistance
Alright, what just happened?
Fucking 8700 wall.
Who's buying bitcoin big in anticipation for a probable weekend hike? I know I am! 
I have a feeling tha this weekend will be fabulous for cryptocurrencies! 
We need a push to get past $8700 
Beautiful !! Heading to 9k wall :o
Then after 9k lets skyrocket to 10k.
:D
So, the power to use Vegeta memes...is it enough to break the wall?
[OVER 9k YAY!](https://imgur.com/WDEX3Id)
I drunk bought some btc last night. Sometimes good decisions are made while drunk.
Looks like we have a few more bridges to burn. 10k gentlemen, 10k.
Can someone post that dancing meme? I think it was from a Bhangra movie. The meme was for 7000 or 8000, can't remember exactly, I'm drunk
Yussss over 9k
8.5k here we go
are all the weak hands gone?

To the mooooon
This is the calm before the storm, which way it goes nobody knows.

As a complete bitcoin noob what should i buy and where is it safe to keep it? I constantly see places being hacked and all the money gone. What is easiest to use and safe?
Ladies and Gentlemen, we are through the financial hymen
what's up with the txn fee being so low? 
My magic 8 ball says we going up today 🚀
FYI Binance is up and running back, cheers!
How I feel about Bitcoin 

Never gonna give you up.

Never gonna let you down.

Never gonna run around and desert you.

Never gonna make you cry.

Never gonna say goodbye.

Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.
sell walls incoming.
Shaking those $$$ grubby traders out left and right.

They never hold through, they don't "believe", thus don't deserve "bottom".
9k wall too stronk
3 Good days and everyone think this the second coming...  Don't forget Bitcoin has been on a massive down trend and has kicked up like this before only to drop rapidly.  Stay SAFE.
Not sure if this is allowed here, but I created a store selling crypto related clothing, mugs, hats etc. I haven't had any sales yet but I think the products are cool. I accept bitcoin as a payment option and ship worldwide. And I have setup a 10% discount code fb10. 

I would love some feedback on the website, any problems with the system and if anyone likes products :D

Well we were over 9k for a few seconds and now are below again.  What will it take to break through that 9k wall? 

Where are the bullish whales?
Everybody I would really appreciate you helping me out with this. There is a btrash supporter grossly mispresenting the facts to business owners on the entrepreneur sub.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/7wi0oy/the_advantages_of_using_bitcoin_bch/

I am holding down the fort but it would be nice to get some back up. 
It's a trap!
Ver back with his sell walls, what a douche 
Looking really strong.

I just got paid, would now be a good time to buy or like in a couple days?
I was experimenting with mining on my PC with AwesomeMiner and i have a question how do i access my funds? Do they send it to my btc address daily or i should request a withdraw? 
Tq bitcoin 😘😘😘😘
Hey /u/theymos, I PM'd you on bitcointalk but haven't heard back, maybe here will help.

I had my bitcointalk account stolen, I sent a signed message from an address linked to a couple places (OTC WOT, bitcointalk post, etc) but maybe I did something wrong or something.

The hacker sold it to someone who's pumping alts and generally being a nuisance with my name, so I'd really appreciate if you could help me out.

Here's my account, you can see a few pages back IIRC that "I" suddenly become active again in a ton of crappy alts. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3600;sa=showPosts
It's about to go to 9.7!!!! 
We don't just become bullish after a bear market like we are in, we need to build support.
the BTCEUR walls on GDAX are sturdy af
Are we out of the wood chipper yet? 
would be very sad if bitcoin return to 15k when get a job after 2 months of bitcoin on sale.
So many sell orders
Is Binance still down?

I'm waiting for the it's over 9,000 gifs

You think we have reached a bottom here in bitcoin?

Your thoughts?

https://youtu.be/fNXKctCuzDw
I am interested in hearing peoples opinion on if they expect BTC to drop further this month before reaching for the moon.
When is this $8k shitcoin going to turn into 24-karat bitcoin?
Looking to have a nice open $BTC @ $8250
pumping people
Question about segwit:

How future proof are BIP39 seeds? I've just moved to a P2SH wallet and Electrum's warning about how BIP39 seeds "do not include a version number, which compromises compatibility with future software" kinda freaked me out. Also, [this](http://docs.electrum.org/en/latest/seedphrase.html) (see "Motivation"). I thought segwit was the future?
now bitcoin get a little lower so can make a good profit.
Would be nice to see $10k again this weekend.  
Quick questition: i would like to invest let's say 200$ into bitcoins but I have two options:

1. I invest it on my own

2. I 'join' my friend's bitcoin wallet in which he has 1000$, and he adds there my 200$ making it 0.xxx btcs) making it 1.2k overall. And whenever I want I he will withdraw my part (above mentioned 0.xxx btcs)

Will there be any difference in possible earnings? If yes, how to calculate it?
Cheers fellow Hodlers!!! 
We are on our way up and nothing or nobody will stop us.

My thoughts on the community's reaction to the senate hearing: https://www.patreon.com/reecerr

Best, thanks for everything all of you do.
I predict 40k by december. Keep hoarding. 
who is down now wallstreet guys???
Binance still down, please feedback
Nice. I like dis. 
TIL the dow is a scamcoin
can i ask why people are saying don't buy because of Chinese new year?
anybody still anticipating a double bottom?
btc will hit low 8500 and then try to break through 9000. succeed or not, it will turn downward trend again on monday for 7k.   Then a rebounce back to 8k. lastly head wards 4.5k 
Boring. Would prefer to see it going down even if losing money instead of this, it's annoying.
Should expect some pump as Binance is back
I was having some strange problems with Binance when it came back online, so just be careful. My buy orders were filled but my balance did not reflect anything had changed. Nothing ever came up in my order history but it told me I had insufficient funds when I tried to trade. Very strange, so maybe just takes some time to catch up....
slowly creeping up
It seems that our old friend want his revenge. :)
lambo or nothing
When will Robinhood cryptocurrency open up? Waiting!
