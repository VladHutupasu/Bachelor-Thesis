Daily Discussion, March 22, 2018
In general, I stopped listening to people's sentiments on here about where prices are going, but I like to come here for the community and shits & giggles. Everyone on here has been wrong, and everyone on here has been right, and nobody knows when they're being which (including myself).

I'm divining (as a game) that it will hit like $5,700 this drop (like some BTC rich maniac is laughing his ass off while scaring the shit out of everyone). But, I bought in at 8.5k, plan on buying at 8k, and lower. Because frankly, I don't see this dying. *I do* see the market being erratic as fuck, but it's part of what I love about Bitcoin right now.
**Milestone: Bitcoin Was Just Used to Buy Two Condos in New York**

Magnum Real Estate Group says it just used Bitcoin to sell two condos in New York City, in the Big Appleâ€™s first real estate transaction using the worldâ€™s most popular cryptocurrency.

Lets put it this way, ive canceled my lamborghini sv order

Ok. Can we please rally to 10k now? So I get to my "break even" point. 

Or dump below 7000, so I can buy some more.

But this is "nowhere land". Frustrating...
Well, this looks to have been one hell of bull trap. Jheeze

In summary, the Chinese government have shown a positive attitude towards blockchain technology despite its enforcement on cryptocurrency and mining operations.
Bullish news needed going viral
2020 moon confirmed
BTC drops by $500, people start calling a $3000 drop further inevitable... yawn just another day
Regarding tax selling:

As tax deadline approaches people will undoubtedly launch a new class of FUD missile , "the tax sell dump".

I remember this from the 2001 crash on Yahoo stock message boards.  

March 2001 saw some pretty steep drops  but the actual tax day was rather uneventful as I remember.

I had two friends caught in the tax trap in 2001,  NEITHER of them payed the taxes they owed on April 15.  Both chose to take the penalty,  and pay the interest thinking their stocks would recover.  They actually did somewhat,  but never enough to get them in the money.  Both sold when the market was better, but both sold down way more than 50%.

So be prepared for a longer lasting 'tax hangover',  I think it may be easy to do some math because the interest rates on unpaid taxes are known.  I actually think the tax selling effect will be MORE sever than it was in 2000 & 2001.  The NASDAQ bubble started popping early in the year 2000, plenty of time to react properly and learn about taxes.   The crypto bubble started popping right at the holiday season,  everybody was distracted.  I have a gut feel there are a lot of people stuck in a tax trap,  and a far more sever one due to percentages of rise and fall of crypto bubble compared to Internet bubble.

good luck!

Hopefully this is a bear trap.....
Can we turn Bitcoin off for 30 seconds and then turn it back on again?

So who's the guy that just sold 437 btc @ $8640 on Bitmex huh?
enjoy the rides, buy the dip and relax.

bitcoin is future-
With over a 700 point drop in one day today, the stock market is starting to look like crypto these days. These are interesting times...:)
No need for a lambo you guys already have a BMW (bitch, moan, whine)
Bought @8700, sold @8700. I'm a master trader.
Over 3 months of being -60% or worse from the ATH on BTC and ~-75% on alts. Fucking miserable market man. Everyday just is low volume sideways and dumping.



I know the dumps are upsetting, but [things are still looking ok IMHO.](https://i.imgur.com/ibK8b3u.png)

Just hodl on, we'll turn this thing around eventually.

Day traders, I'm keeping you in my thoughts and prayers.
Man oh man some of the people in this sub are reaaalll bitter. 
spike
Ugh, capital gains taxes kills my most hopeful purpose of BTC, daily transactions.

Guess we will forever have CryptoGold rather than Cryptocurrency.
Uhh.. thought we were going to the moon, why are we halting? Lambo is waiting for me.
Funny how Social Media like Facebook, Google, Twitter are banning crypto.... but with these latest data breaches... I guess they are in big trouble...
Facebook will have a big shakeup, funny how thing works out...
What we're all of you doing before crypto currency? Video games?

*yawn*
Hopefully the dump this time is a one flush dump and not a two flush...
Completely destroyed wall. Such trash. 
what the hell!!!! what happened? 
Of course, margin trading in exchanges by owners, who else can dump all market ( more than 300 different coins in same time) ? Short us usual, that they can make huge money. Soon everything will be green till next shorting.
Even though Iâ€™d like it to drop to 6.5- Iâ€™m actually bullish. If it drops to 7.8 Iâ€™m buying. I think itâ€™s going to make a bull run here real soon.
*Put him to sleep...load the Japan fud.*
I think we should be aiming for over $10k by the 1st of April and then from there we need to be having a strong couple of months.  Perhaps $15k by July.
bitcoin recovering already?
FYI. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-22/bitcoin-falls-after-report-that-binance-faces-warning-in-japan
I though that Mt. Gox bloke stopped dropping a huge dump on the market. Could some of you fine gents fill me in?
i agreed with you that mt god bloke stopped dropping a huge dump on the market.
When the stock market plunges, so does crypto. Don't look for some underlying article to explain this drop. The DJIA is already down 400 points today amid fear of Trump's new tariff declaration.

By the way some of you talk you'd think crypto has been around for years!! Video games to crypto currency.  Trade one make believe world for another...
Here are recent stats, from the past 4 weeks trend. 

THU to FRI, average **117 gain**.  

FRI to SAT average **-261 drop**. 

SAT to SUN, average **291 gain**.  

When people speak of the weekend dip, we need to understand and keep in mind, that late Saturday, early Sunday morning is typically our lowest point, but the price typically recovers and has actually improved between Thursday 5pm to Sunday 5pm. We have averaged **147 gain**  

Per usual, this is not trading advice to anybody, I'm just trying to adjust to trends, post 11k.
Come On Whales, use some of your profits to get us above $9k. 
Seems like weekend retests 8k again. Then 10k by april if no fud appears
Fuck...
Oh crap!!!  Every time I make $$$ at the track, I just lose it here!  Whatâ€™s the difference?  There arenâ€™t any bots, and there isnâ€™t any corruption or inside trading at the track!

The manipulation is real. They stealing ur coins yo! Don't sale and hold. you will feel bad when the next rally kicks in. 
Dear Wallstreet/Wallstreet Analysts/CNBC, FANG stocks bubble is about to pop. Not Bitcoin. 
You all thought it was a small one-time dump. Adorable. ðŸ˜‚
Wonder how many are getting caught in the fake bear market trap. This is a bull market 100%
Honestly if you take a step back, things are looking too bright for BTC right now to get caught up in the drama of price swings. Itâ€™s actually pretty funny reading some of the doom and gloom on this daily. I guess everyone is entitled to an opinion

Fear about regulation etc is nothing in comparison to the potential of this tech. What a time to be alive!
Type of people on this subreddit.

1- authentic- those who dont give a shit about tech but  are here for money (I am the one) and openly accept it.

2- hypocrites- those who claim to be in it for tech but actually cry over each penny they lose.

3- non-coiners- with pathetic life, who still live with their moms, some of them even with their grandparents, because their parents kicked them out.

4- those who feel good just by making bold predictions (a sub-class of No.3)

5- FUDs, which seems to be most successful group so far. 
 

Edit: Another group who tell you that you are a redditer for two weeks and have no right to say anything. Like they spent whole childhood on reddit. Fuckers
8500. Wtf is going on. Just stay put people don't sale. 
Will someone please post when the market gets back to 9K.... and for the love of Jesus, please don't post if it drops below 8K... 
Now can we call it a bear trap ?

can someone tell me in simple words what bull trap mean?
[the fluctuations are random noise](https://youtu.be/d3ur59Uk7RI) Any opinions on this? 
I hope someone might help me here related to UK Capital Gain tax.

On Bitcoin, we have to class it as capital gains tax but then there is a tax free amount of Â£11,300 each year.

Does this mean that if my gains (profits) are less than 11,300 in any tax year, I am exempt from paying the tax?

Any help appreciated - I am sure US rules will be on similar lines as well. 
Bulls are being released to do practice. 
And back in bitcoin. Feels good! Sollid :-)
Can anyone explain how whales (presumably) coordinate their dumps to maximise suppression?

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese financial authorities are planning to order a halt to Bianance, the world's largest cryptographic exchange, a major foreign exchange spokesman said yesterday.

Bloomberg said, "The Japanese financial agency will soon take measures to prevent binunas from operating without a license," they said. "They have been expanding their business without any permission from the Japanese government so far."

Earlier this month, the Financial Services Agency issued an order to shut down the two sites, BitStation and FSHO, for the first time this month. It has been confirmed that customer assets are useful for private purposes. It was the first time that Japan imposed direct sanctions on the cryptographic exchange.

Yeah, this is all over. No way this ever sees over 10K again, ever. This market is more corrupt and manipulated than any on the globe. Good luck, HODLERS. This is the end of the rodeo.

Looks like the big bank money is coming in so 12k in a week for bitcoin digital gold.
This is great!
How is the crypto weather today? Partly cloudy or hot... so whales can come out and bask in the sun.
If BTC doesn't quite moon perhaps this Lambo will do crypto payments accepted https://utoky.lu/stock/trattori-lamborghini-fl3 or if you are lucky a bit more BTC to spend https://utoky.lu/stock/lamborghini-miura-p-400 or very lucky indeed even https://utoky.lu/stock/ferrari-f40
My prediction for Bitcoins is ....
The price will go up, then down, then sideways...

Is he any good with the crypto stuff ;)
Dump soon!

edit: In case you missed it, I always predict the opposite of "goldbergger". Let's see how that works out.

edit2: Ok, I'll stop. He's cheating. Hahaha!

Hi guys,

 

My brother and I have been working on a tool to help us predict Bitcoin price movements for a couple of months and we posted it to Product Hunt today. I'm super excited about it and really want to know what people think of it. Apologies in advance if this wasn't the right place to post it.

 

Most people trying to predict prices are doing technical analysis by hand (measuring candles, checking resistance lines, applying fibonacci, etc.) and some of them are getting decent results. Wall Street does TA with bots for their algorithmic trading, which is faster and more reliable, so we made our own TA bot.

 

We combined our TA bot with a machine learning algorithm to understand how the news and other IRL events such as financial markets affect the price of bitcoin. So far we've been doing great.

 

The tool has been around 80% accurate on the couple of months we've been developing it so it's been fun to say the least haha.

 

If anyone wants to check it out or just have a conversation about what we've made, price prediction or trading, HMU or check us out at www.hodlorshort.com

Or check our Product Hunt
