Daily Discussion, May 11, 2018
Mods post these daily threads so that you guys have a place to banter about daily stuff. It's unfortunate that the only discussion that occurs in these threads is related to price obsession. We have TWO sticky spots. If mods want to sticky something that's actually **informative** or educational, we're going to do that. Because if we don't, then really good content gets lost in all the noise of people obsessing about price every single day.

If a day comes along and there's no daily thread because there's something else stickied, or the bot crashes, or whatever... it's not the end of the world. It's not an excuse to throw a temper tantrum. It doesn't mean that mods are involved in a price manipulation conspiracy, or that mods are trying to suppress bad news. You guys can stop acting like spoiled kids and start acting like adults. If you're really that obsessed about price, please log off, and go for a nice walk outdoors to get some fresh air and clear your head.

e: Previous (excellent) sticky that we had to take down because too many spoiled kiddos were threatening to hold their breath until they turned blue. https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8i60k5/a_simplified_lecture_on_how_script_works_1_hour_5/
It‚Äôs so interesting that we‚Äôve had so much good news over the past week and the markets hardly responded. We get some FUD re upbit it crashes as if Bitcoin itself were hacked.
Lots of shorts placed after going underneath 8900. Each drop has been followed by a slight rise, but coincides with buying from shorts being closed. I'm not sure if there's any real buying pressure at the moment.
The orchestra on deck sounds rather nice.  There's a little seawater lapping around my plimsolls, but all will be ok..

:)

p.s.  Much respected mods: BTC is under continued and sustained attack.  Its price is a measure of its resilience.

It is hard not to discuss price here.

But I will cease posting if you wish.  You have a reasonable point.

*E: added p.s.*
Some Payday Friday this is turning out to be ...
Man, am I ever happy I sold when I did. It's not often that you feel good about a major investment decision, but selling just before this dip makes me a happy dude. 

Keep at it, guys. I had to sell my Bitcoin because I am broke, but I firmly would have continued hodling if I was in a better financial position. Best of luck everyone, it's been a hell of a year. I may not be a hodler anymore, but I'll always be loyal to the Bitcoin community. 
lost my whole bank account gg

:(
Q: bitcoin dumping?, whyy????
A: because there are more sellers than buyers.

that simple.
Eh?

It's a conspiracy you know!!!

The mods took the money and put Roger and that weird skinny kid with a vegan aversion to salad in charge of our fun and nonsense  :)

Where can i get a nice bitcoin hoodie? bonus points if i can buy it with bitcoin.
So i'm creating a new segwit wallet and i thought they started with a "3" but this new one starts with "bc1" what does this mean? why the change?
Morning.

I woke up, looked at the price and thought, shit.

But then:

Good for Bitcoin :)
Daily Discussion 12th May is up now.....

im a afrid of tonight 
This is good for bitcoin
Its anyones game today, curious how this weekend will look. Been talking to some buddies about the dip telling them to buy in if they can afford it. Its payday but all my fiat went to bills üòë
Well, at least the attendees of "Consensus 2018" will find a nice entry price, if they want to fomo in.
Everyone abandon ship! bill gates and warren buffet are shorting! run for the hills! The winkle voss twins challenged gates and he brought in buffet to help!! buy back around 1k.
I've heard this like 5x already, got some sauce papi?
I have very simple tactic:

1. Holding my current coins in case this is the bottom
2. Having ready 500$ in cash to buy more on monday if it dips further
3. Going all in and buying 1 BTC if it falls near 6k after that
the daily thread creator was frustrated the whole day. i understand it. 
everything is fine
Best time to buy is right now 
Good thing I sold at $9800 
The price is irrelevant if you believe in the future of Bitcoin. Who cares if the price drops a little bit if you know it will be millions in 2020?
Anyone else fondly remembering the good old days of daily gains and when you could turn a tidy profit off of manual arbitrage (congested mempool has it's benefits). 
S.O.S.   

Enough happy talk about bitcoin from certain bull whales in the media. If you have cash on the sidelines, time to pony it up and help out the fish here.  Losing 9k and now 8.5k is just sad after all the gains we made the past few weeks.  We almost topped 10k a week ago. Let‚Äôs go bulls. This is getting depressing.  
What does Coinmarketcap use to calculate the \(Change 24h\) if for example: Kucoin displays a 5.7&#37;, Bittrex displays a 8.3&#37; and Binance displays a 6.1&#37; change on any given same token or coin? What is their basis if other than using a percentage of several or all exchanges to calculate? Hope this is not a stupid question?
I‚Äôm getting pretty excited for this turnaround. I think it will be quite dramatic when it happens.

Almost an hour since the last block - this is disgraceful
Please define the word ‚Äústicky‚Äù for those of us new to the internet age or over 40 years of age. 
rough day, huh 
You only lose BTC by selling.

Ergo..

Don't :)

It is that simple.

Maintain the cause of a truly decentralised and democtratised means of payment and exchange.

(And if you REALLY want to buy a fucking coffee with it - as Ver pretends to: to save all the babies needing to buy a 10 USD coffee in Tokyo with his shitcoin, wait for Lightning.)
looks like we found a price that buyers can afford.
Waiting for fiat to make way to exchange. Keep dropping..
I sent BTC from Coinbase to Kucoin. It took 1 1/2 hours to get the "Sent"email confirmation from Coinbase. 2 minutes after that, I received the deposit confirmation from Kucoin. I also sent Bcash from Coinbase to Kucoin a couple minutes after sending the Bitcoin. It took 5 minutes Coinbase to Kucoin to email confirmation from both. Is the Bitcoin delay on Coinbase, or a congested network...or is that why the world is moving over to BCH?
Volume is good.

Imo the bcash dump caused this others to sell off
If anyone is interested, I posted my very first idea to tradingview. I see a cup and handle forming with bitcoin.

The alts bloodbath we're witnessing somewhat contradicts what several believe about them following Bitcoin. Sure, Bitcoin is down too ,but not anywhere near the alts decline in percentages. Time to shake out those weak hands. When its over, there are going to be some great deals for those that have done their due diligence toward finding that 1&#37; that will make the cut.
