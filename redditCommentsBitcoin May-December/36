Fuck another Bart is forming
I've said it once ill say it again....sentiment has changed people, sentiment has changed.  There is inherently more risk in taking shorts as opposed to longs right now
Reminder: There will be an AMA later today. It might occur in the announcement thread, but it might also get a fresh thread. Either way, it will be stickied. https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8c05vr/hi_rbitcoin_im_emiliano_pagnotta_assistant/
I actually think it's amazing how well these dumps get absorbed. Really different than a few days/weeks ago.
Will it reach 9k by the end of April?
Alot of people were complaining that they needed more time to get I before btc took off again, well now is your time folks. 

For those worried that btc dropped, even in a bull run there will be bear days, if you can't handle that than you shouldn't be investing your money in anything
I want another short squeeze
cmon Asia - pull this baby up. If can hold 8, may see 9 in 24hrs
**HODL On: In Defense of Bitcoin's Best Investment Strategy**

https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-in-defense-of-hodlers/

Steven Hopkins is chief operating officer and general counsel of Medici Ventures, an Overstock.com subsidiary focused on the advancement of blockchain technology.

In 1987's Black Monday stock market crash, Sam Walton, the world's richest man, lost more than half a billion dollars in a few hours.

When reached for comment, Walton said, "It's paper anyway. As far as I'm concerned we're focusing totally on the company doing well and taking care of our customers."

He didn't care about dollars; he cared about his asset Wal-Mart, and he still owned that.

History of the #HODL In bitcoin's volatile and roller coaster past, "HODL" was the meme that bound the cryptocurrency community together. It stood for the proposition that we all believe in the future of bitcoin. It's both funny and insightful.

Here is the original post by GameKyuubi on a Bitcoin Talk forum (spelling errors and profanity included):

I AM HODLING

I type d that tyitle twice because I knew it was wrong the first time. Still wrong. w/e. GF's out at a lesbian bar, BTC crashing WHY AM I HOLDING? I'LL TELL YOU WHY. It's because I'm a bad trader and I KNOW I'M A BAD TRADER. Yeah you good traders can spot the highs and the lows pit pat piffy wing wong wang just like that and make a millino bucks sure no problem bro. Likewise the weak hands are like OH NO IT'S GOING DOWN I'M GONNA SELL he he he and then they're like OH GOD MY ASSHOLE when the SMART traders who KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY'RE DOING buy back in but you know what? I'm not part of that group. When the traders buy back in I'm already part of the market capital so GUESS WHO YOU'RE CHEATING day traders NOT ME~! Those taunt threads saying "OHH YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD" YEAH NO SHIT. NO SHIT I SHOULD HAVE SOLD. I SHOULD HAVE SOLD MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY SELL AND BOUGHT MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY BUY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT NOT EVERYBODY IS AS COOL AS YOU. You only sell in a bear market if you are a good day trader or an illusioned noob. The people inbetween hold. In a zero-sum game such as this, traders can only take your money if you sell.

so i've had some whiskey

actually on the bottle it's spelled whisky

w/e

sue me

(But only if it's payable in BTC)

It was not about bitcoin versus bitcoin cash or 1,000 other cryptocurrencies. It was bitcoin vs. the world and we ALL embraced it.

It only took 11 minutes for this post to become a meme that became the rallying cry for the entire crypto world. We were all on the same rollercoaster ride and GameKyuubi, in the depths of his frustration, had (sort of) elegantly articulated both what it feels like and the best trading strategy for an asset this volatile.

Buy and HODL.

The good traders GameKyuubi was wrong about only one thing: There aren't any good traders.

There are lots of us who believe we are good traders. But we aren't. Of course, some of the loudest voices on Reddit regularly remind us about how well they time the market. Except when they don't time the market well.

A paper published last October by the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley entitled "Do Day Traders Rationally Learn About Their Ability?" used nearly 15 years of stock market day trading data to conclude that all day traders are irrational, the vast majority of day traders lose money, and even when day traders are successful, they "irrationally attribute success disproportionately to their ability rather than luck."

This sounds exactly like the crypto trader. Any post you see mocking HODL is likely someone who thinks they are really smart because they made money by trading crypto last year.

Of course, their success was due to their unique trading ability and not the fact that the entire market rose like a rocket.

HODLing works Still, empirically, even in volatile assets like bitcoin, carefully choosing an asset and holding long-term positions has proven to offer the best return.

Warren Buffett, the most successful investor of modern times, has often said that he only invests in what he knows. His preferred holding period: forever. With that model, his company, Berkshire Hathaway, has averaged a 19 percent annual return since 1965 which means it has risen more than 1 million percent.

Theoretical models that assume participants know when markets will move against them can offer better returns but, in practice, market movements cannot be reliably predicted so even when people like Bernie Madoff try to make us think that they've figured it out, they haven't.

Long-term investment in quality assets remains the only reliable investment strategy.

Simply put, HODLing works.

More possibilities For those not interested in limiting their activity to HODLing, there are two new and useful ideas that have begun bouncing around that really do advance cryptocurrencies: #BUIDL and #SPEDN.

BUIDL has been used to help remind us that, in the words of a CypherPunk's Manifesto, "Cypherpunks write code." In order for the blockchain to really be useful and valuable, we need to build stuff on it. Watching the price go up and down either as a trader or a HODLer does nothing to make bitcoin work better.

We need to create some of the promised applications that can really change the world. To date, the blockchain community has fallen short in this regard outside of the areas of payments but there are some real wins.

Just this weekend, Voatz, a Medici Ventures portfolio company is running party county convention voting in Utah, state convention voting in Michigan and state primary voting for overseas and military voters in West Virginia, all on a blockchain platform.

Blockchain voting is a simple application, but it is one that can bring a much-needed security and transparency to elections. And we are doing it now.

SPEDN is a nod to the many of us who realize that, for bitcoin to be useful, we need to be able to spend it to buy things. And I mean everything. It really doesn't matter whether it is through second-layer solutions like lightning or forks like bitcoin cash; we need more ways to use cryptocurrencies in real-world transactions.

A focus here, rather than complaining about HODLers would be helpful. We need many more merchants to accept cryptocurrency before it becomes useful. Options to spend bitcoin remain severely limited in most areas and this will ultimately limit bitcoin's value.

As for me, I will HODL until I can buy useful stuff and SPEDN.

HODL on This year has seen intense regulatory pressure on cryptocurrencies and its time we stop pretending that HODL was stupid. It isn't and it wasn't. Anyone who doesn't like the HODL mentality needs to give HODLers something else they can do with their bitcoins.

Trading is no solution for intelligent people. What we need are new ways to use cryptocurrency.

We need BUIDLers and merchants who will let us be SPEDNers.

We‚Äôve got a pretty clear Batman formation on the GDAX 1-hr charts. Bullish!

Over 8k again. Nice!  Time to press the pedal to the metal.  Let‚Äôs get to 9k this week. Shall we?
Here we go again. 
This blows. I don‚Äôt understand why we have to keep crawling back into the asshole of the bear time and time again. I just wish this fucking bear market would die.
all these people suddenly telling everyone else to sell. Sounds like shorts are scared they'll get burned come tomorrow hahaha
So, what's on the menu for today?
Do you have to pay taxes after you sell only?

Has anyone succesfully used bisq with ally bank using zelle?
Hold position boys!
I just wired money from my bank to my BitFlyer account. It won‚Äôt be transferred until tomorrow. Bull run will happen sometime between now and tomorrow morning JST.
Good morning weak handed American brothers 
I know the market has been (to put it mildly) boring for the last couple of months. But unless the tech is going to be completely abandoned, surely it's ONLY A MATTER OF TIME until we reach and surpass the ATH. Stock up while it's cheap :D
is dumping just started ??
Hopefully most were able to make a nice little profit this weekend. Be a whale; now wait out the storm. 
As long as we don't fall below the $7,800 range (resistance), we should be good. IMHO this drop was due to people taking profits and a correction in BTC price.  
Same shit, different week.  Too predictable.
OMG we have a key reversal :S
**Come On Bulls, don't throw away the last few days progress!** 
Welcome back bears. People starting open up those short positions again 
The bears üêª will fail this time. Wrong season. Time to go back into hibernation. 
Can we just accept that this was a dead cat bounce
Due to popular demand we have decided to extend the sale for a very short time. 

The happiness of our customers is of utmost importance to us. So we want to give everyone, who might have missed out on this "once in a lifetime" opportunity, the chance to take advantage of these incredibly low prices.

But be quick! This sale ends very soon!

'Double Bart' coming up.
Long red dongs for breakfast who's eating
How much of the price of BTC will be due to the value of the dollar going down, Im thinking long term
$8000-$8040 is getting boring. Let's break out there. Shall we?
Perhaps a few last minute sellers due the tax deadline today and last night.  
well, it was a good run 
I knew it couldn't sustain itself. Very happy.
I really don't think you'll get another chance to buy below $8k. Risky if you aren't in now.
The extended "Spring Sale" is over. I hope everyone got a chance to purchase some sub-8k coins.
Liking the fact that we're holding above $300b, but that trend line could use a serious hammering. If we break it, hot damn spring 2018 will be gravey.
I dicked around on coinbase for two weeks (early december so i got very lucky) and realized ~$700 in gains. I was fully planning on reporting this in my taxes but finished my taxes with the intention to come back and add this, but didn't realize once submitted I had to wait for my refund and there's a complicated process to amend your taxes.  Is it worth it to go back and report this?

how do you us think bitcoin would react in another banking crisis?
Hold
buy

what a resistance at $8140
$9k Soon!! I will add more btc today. 
It was good while it lasted. We‚Äôll be crawling back into 7k territory.......again. #whitedogshit

Bitcoin will work. Just wait when loan crysis will come and buy everything from people who takes risks. Houses, cars...
Very happy to see the progress made was lost in a few hours. Go lower.
Good morning, New York!

What are your plans for today?
It was but a nice little pump back to the bottom she goes. 
Given the HUGE expansion of bitcoin in the next 5 years, will we see slow gains, fast gains, and what is the expectation? Is there any fact-based information out there?
ever notice how people in this sub only believe in HODLing when
what is the best investment
mining  using solar or buying coins
or should I just buy another 10,000 sheep
Nice candle.
Very likely the short squeeze will turn out to be a bull trap. Free fall to 6-7k range incoming
Remember Americans,  you do NOT have to pay taxes due on 2017 crypto trades by April the 17th.   You only have to file a tax return.  The Tax return may declare that you owe the IRS,  but if you don't actually send a check,  the IRS assess a penalty,  and starts charging interest.  And that is perfectly legal on your part AND their part.

Ultimately,  you will HAVE to pay all taxes due,  plus any penalties and interest incurred,  or the IRS will f you over.

This is important because  if you:

* owe taxes on 2017 trades
* don't have the fiat to pay
* believe strongly your coins will recover soon

It might be a wise thing to HODL,  and pay the penalty and interest.




Quite disappointed to wake up this morning to see that we had got over $8400 only to then come back to around $8100.  Hopefully when the American market gets going properly we can get back to around $8300 or higher.  Cheers. 
hmmm, price going down, could be people cashing out before tax day (?)
Hey fellas, its Monday morning so real BTC markets begin now! Beginning a live analysis and trading segment in just a few mins!

Sellers are getting exhuasted walls are trimming down
if the dip was caused by the tax season, crypto should have risen by now. 
**Surely a drop down to $7000 is a great thing?** I know everybody has hopes of going to the moon this month, but if you had Bitcoin before the spike up to $8400, then sold and it falls to $7000 then you have made yourself some lovely profit for the next round! 

It also means that all the doom and gloom from last week and predictions of $4k bitcoin is now over. The feeling this week is upbeat because it has demonstrated, proven, that there will be a lot more bullruns in 2018. 

So sell now, let it fall to $7000. Other traders will jump in, FOMO.  Then buy in with an increased position for the real bullrun!

I can.t see any one new investing in BTC
When they look at the history of the last few months
I invested in BTC at the start of 2017, bless BTC
and just been a holder except for a few coin that i have traded  in and out 
Now I am cashed up from a land investment can't see investing any more in crypto  this time
I look at crypto as an investment not as money 
every time BTC  moves up a few percent, millions of traders
sell bring the price down again .
I only see BTC jumping ahead when their is a threat of war as when the Rocket man up set Japan and the South
they were buying up big time
no new investors are going to jump on the gravy train while it is stopped or going back wards .
There are other investment that give a return that BTC is competing against 
When I trade I it seems like I am biting the hand that feeds me .
