Trading range seems very tight today compared to the last week.  Volatility way down.

11250 on coinbase would be a good place to set up a lemonade stand. Nobody is moving either way.
I’m happy to report that I have successfully figured out to do a port forward WITHOUT having to do a port forward with my router (turns out with my ISP it’s not straightforward. However I’ve got unlimited data so can’t complain too much). I’ve been using PIA VPN, but since I’ve found out some questionable people who also back bcash are on the board of PIA. So I was trialing TorGuard VPN and found out you can just portfoward through their client settings. And guess what! I’M RUNNING A FULL NODE BITCHES! 


c'mon bitcoin. let's break 12000
Can't fucking wait to get out of January, it's dragging.

HODLUJAH!
I'm starting to realize HODLING is hard and that's why it works. I would doubt it if it was easy!
Down goes the $12K wall!
This is it, gents. $12k was my target support level. Now that Lightning Network is getting more and more hype and now that there's a possibility Coinbase may support Segwit and txn batching, I truly think the king of cryptos will make his return.
Pretty tumescent right now guys
I see the smart money is dumping bcrash. Down 4.92% against BTC. It's going to go much lower, much faster very soon. The floodgates are just starting to open on this disaster.
I've been analysing my trading fees. Fucking exchanges are even more greedy than bankers. We seriously need some decentralization in this area. 
Breached 12k on gdax

Edit: ik itll prove me wrong but it always feels significant when a sell wall gets eaten that fast
13k is coming soon
Holy shit the bulls are running wild
Weak hands dump on the slides, then buy back in on the bull runs. 
Hello, guyz! Some updates on my recent question about Teachmeplease. I contacted their support on Bitcointalk, and they seem to be quite helpful. Minus 1 red flag (or I hope so).
Let’s go 12.5!
12,500!! Go BTC!
Serious question from an admitted skeptic: Where do you see the long-term value from Bitcoin coming? 

I see the appeal of cryptocurrency but anything people are encouraged to horde or that has so much violitality is not a good currency. 

And with no revenue stream coming for holding a unit and little value as commodity I don't understand where the worth comes from? 
Might be a little late to the game but to all early adopters of cryptocurrencies - - How did you come to know about this game changing technology? Was there a forum back in 2010, 2011 discussing about BTC like today? Is reddit the place for it? How do you get in early in the game? I seem to be missing the boat all the time
It’s time!
holyshit
who the hell lit the fuse on that rocket?
So is it true that what lit this rocket is Trump's shutdown today?
I think the only reason the price is going up is because a bunch of bank account withdraws just came in on GDAX. Source: just received money from bank account and price coincidentally skyrocketed.

Bought in around 12200. Where do you guys have stop buy orders placed?
Broke the wall, yep. 
do u think the government shutdown has anything to do with this pump?
Whew. Saved a little bit of my 2013 haul and I’ve been buying into this chop for the past week or so, feels good to get it moving up. 
Loving this little run. So glad I bought the January sale! Something inside me is cheering so hard for eth to surpass bcash for good!

If I want to sell some BTC for GBP is localbitcoins a good method? When I go to the site for quick buys I notice the rates are pretty bad, so presumably posting a sell trade will give me a good rate when somebody wants to buy from me?

I guess my other option is the GDAX -> Revolut -> bank dance.
Got into bitcoin a few months ago,when it was priced at 6k$ . Bought in coinbase with a few hundred dollars and hodl . I didnt check the price and any news since then. Now im overwhelmed with everything that happened. Is there anything important I need to know or do? My bitcoin is still at coinbase.
It's friday are we going to see a pump today?

Concorde has been reinstated - bitcoin in holding pattern - next we go Mach 1. 
its happening
It feels so good
c'mon baby, we're heading towards 13,5
There it is 12,500. Missed this feeling, it's addicting.
Buy now or wait 15 mins?
Hopefully, a lot of noobs learned to HODL through all of this. Either through sell-regret or HODL-reward.
Is anyone watching GDAX at the moment? There is a sell wall at $11850 for 177 BTC

Please suggest a good platform for latest news about cryptocurrency
Here's a question that popped into my head today...is the Lightning protocol something that other cryptos could adopt or is it somehow exclusive to Bitcoin?
Buying Bitcoins is a lot more complicated than I thought, and I dont want to go through coinbase after todays post on this sub. Any pointers?

Has anyone transferred with 40-50 sat/b lately. If so how long did it take? Knew it was gonna take a long time, but is 3 days much?
IRS tax question.  If a bitcoin is sent from a seller's wallet to a buyer's wallet (e.g. selling on localbitcoin or even just giving a gift to somebody), and all transactions are public in the ledgers and can be tracked across wallets.  How does a seller protect himself from being liable for taxes on gains made on that bitcoin in the future by the buyer ?
Can anyone help me understand transaction fee's, I purchased BTC on Coinbase, transferred to GDAX and then to my personal wallet, the amount in my wallet is the same amount that i had in my Coinbase. i understood that there was no transaction fee when going from Coinbase to GDAX but why was there no fee from GDAX to my personal wallet?

Hi guys, happy 12k!

Quick question, I'm trying to move my money out of my Electrum wallet and to a hardware wallet. To do so electrum is asking for my google authenticator code, which I don't have. It says I can reset the wallet by using the 12 word verification, which I do have. How do I go about doing this while making sure I don't lose my bitcoins? Thanks!
Coinbase BTC sale prices used to be standard couple hunderd above Moonstats price, now its even under, anyone input on this, like how comes
Gotta get my buys in. 

LAOS BAN BITCOIN
So much Tether FUD. No matter what happens there will always be dudes in here spreading FUD.
[deleted]
When moon 
I don't understand the FUD on USDT. Isn't the growth in USDT fueled by individual and institutional investors buying the USDT to get into the cryptocurrency market?
TO THE MOON!!!
Futures markets closed for the weekend and we're in an uptrend so I'd rest easy and buy now and take profits Sunday, I expect high 12s potentially 13k by Sunday ;)
On Jan 7 BTC was at 17,000 and the crypto market cap was in the 800 billions (the highest it's ever been and this was Post BTC ATH!) If the market had gone over 1 trillion the narrative would have been massively bullish and we would have possibly seen 1.5 within weeks. IMO world leaders were getting nervous. They know they can't stop crypto but they can slow it down. When BTC corrected down to 13500 five days later then started back up again, world leaders made their move. South Korea announced a possible ban and made a big show of raiding exchanges. China made noise about "cracking down harder." IMO, these events were timed to prevent another run-up of the crypto market. Take this with a grain of salt bc I am susceptible to conspiracy theories after 4:20 in the afternoon.
Whats all this "Lightning" i keep hearing about?

Is it like a new crypto, "Bitcoin Lightning" kind of like how theres Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold? Or will is it a new Bitcoin update, ie no separate coin
Hi, bit of a newbie here. If someone from the us buys eth or btc for me, are they subjected to any taxes or are your assets only taxes when you convert it back to usd?
It's still my first year with crypto. Just wondering whether the veterans of you can tell what made Bitcoin recover yesterday.

Apparently, it initially fell due to FUD because of those regulation announcements. So my expectation was that we need something concrete to happen to make it rise again (some announcement or event). All charts show that those drops apparently happen every January. Therefore, my question is: What made Bitcoin recover in the recent years? Was there a concrete trigger or did it just kind of happen?

Would be really helpful to get a feeling for "is the worst over?" or "what needs to happen to end it?".

Thanks!
For those who use **BitMEX**, please take a minute and post on their [sticky thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitMEX/comments/7lm5yb/a_note_on_withdrawal_fees/?sort=new) for an update on SEGWIT. 

Every post will help bring a change. Thanks!
What happens when all coins have been mined. Will mining still be possible?

Where’s the FUD???

One 15 minute candle in gdax is a single long wick from 11,700s to 11,100s.  What happened??
Hi, I have just read that Angela Merkel and Macron are going to trigger a global bitcoin crackdown. If a not official note from South Korea triggered a -30/40% of the price of the CCs, what should we expect from this? I'm afraid HODLing won't work this time and the bloodshed would be higher. I am still positive though, but what the government want and do is scary...

Long time BTC owner. I’m still trying to figure out how I get my wallet (offline ideally) for bitcoin cash and bitcoin gold? Right now I’ve got an offline wallet with my original small btc amount in it still. 
Do bch and btg have core wallets similar to bitcoin?

Cool! Now it's time to go up up up! 
whats next? 13k or 14k?
I've heard about lightning network since May '17. My memory is a bit fuzzy but it seems like people were saying it would have been implemented soon back then. Or maybe it was SegWit. Anyway, how long has lightning network been in development and are we closing in? How long until it's userfriendly and people can send their Bitcoin to each other effortlessly kind of like CashApp?

Tether's going to be the next Mt. Gox. It's unsustainable and when it collapses billions will leave the economy instantly, that's crash level shit.
Guys, why is BTC useful as a currency to fight back against tyrannical banks and governments when every BTC can be linked back to you and every transaction basically has your name on it? (Govts are putting a lot of money into improving their tracking abilities so the problem will keep getting worse)
Is this inability to break 12k worrisome?
When you look at the chart for an alt coin that has been pumped and dumped it usually has a rapidly occurring high, then a drop, then a second run up that doesn't go quite as high as the first, then a gradual downward trajectory until, if the coin has any value at all and isn't just a shitcoin, it levels off somewhere above the point where the pump and dump started. This higher leveling off could be attributed to higher awareness of the coin brought about by the meteoric rise. Looking at the BTC chart back to November or so it looks the same, like BTC has been pumped and dumped. My casual non expert prediction is that BTC will level off in the 8-10k range then slowly grow, with spikes up or down based on positive or negative events.

Hello, recently got into BTC and would love advice on how to day trade, and being up to date with BTC and other crypto.  Also block chain.YouTube and other source would be great

My friend is also looking for a expert in SE Asia that can help him in BTC and other coin trading, any recommendation on where we can look at? He has everything personal finance set up, like emergency funds, retirements, etc and he wants to go full on day trading.

Thank you!

What is Lightning network? 
We need to get the price above 12.5 today or we'll turn Bearish 
What do you think the govt. Shutdown will do to the price of BTC?
Looks like there's a ceiling at $12,600, it just passed it on it's first attempt but has failed twice since.

Anyone got any predictions what will happen if it does/doesn't break $12,600 again?

Hmmm 🤔
https://www.coindesk.com/stuck-at-12k-bitcoin-price-needs-quick-progress-to-avert-further-losses/
Looks like the calm before another storm.  Either it hits 12,500 and go to 17k+ or it will go down to 7k.
BTC will be around 12k-12,5k this weekend. Set a reminder or mark my words :)
So question... I watch a documentary on bitcoin and they were talking about how bitcoin can't be hacked like banks have been because there are too many computers or whatever, etc. so my question is if bitcoin can't be hacked like they say, then how was North Korea able to do so...?
