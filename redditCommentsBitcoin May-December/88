Daily Discussion, February 27, 2018
People, it's not going to go up in a straight line, it will go up in stair steps, with periods of going down. If you get emotional about the small movement and occasional dips then you're not doing yourself any favors, especially if you want to trade or invest. Just accept that it will move around.
Tomorrow (2018-02-28) Bitcoin's lifetime average price hits $1,000 USD. (using daily High price)

I calculated using Mt Gox data from 2010-07-17 to 2012-12-31, and then switched to Bitstamp for the rest.

We had hit $500 on 2017-11-09.

We haven't dropped below the lifetime average price since 2011-12-24.

If you use daily Lows instead of High, we are at $911 today.

Just a fun fact!

It's my birthday, all green. thanks my mom and dad.
Quick, nobody talk about the price going up so we don't jinx it!
We should all join forces and become a whale.
Looking good to break $11000 today lets go USA its your turn now
God damn it Bill Gates, go to his IAMA and ctr-F "crypt"

Good morning :) 
Is the bitcoin ppa for Ubuntu still maintained? This one: https://launchpad.net/~bitcoin/+archive/ubuntu/bitcoin
So when and who is going to work on a crypto currency movie. I think now is the time and it would be pretty amazing to watch.
What time to gdax daily candles close?
Anyone withdrawn BTC from GDAX to a segwit address yet? Just want to verify it's working as intended and no surprises.
Dont miss the train..
Seeing the recent [spike in segwit txs](http://segwit.party/charts/), can anyone confirm (with a screen shot, or txid if possible) that both Coinbase and Bitfinex are offering segwit addresses for deposits, and paying out withdraws with segwit txs?

I don't have accounts at either exchange.  Thanks in advance.
my body and my btc are ready for moon landing

Where can I view or query the 200 day moving average for Bitcoin?
Take a breath... something is coming.. i think bull time
wtf! someone posted a 275 btc buy wall on bitstamp and then cancelled again...

I sure hate to be the dickhead here. But I just did my taxes and paid a chunk that came from directly right out of and around the butthole region plus 8in of colon. So now I have to poop in a bag. So you fuckers that are short selling better keep in mind that they'll come for you. Sooner or later and I don't think that you can report losses. Have fun!

Anyone know if bitcoin in an electrum wallet will get the bitcoin private airdrop?
Btc price up or down
Bitcorn don't give a fuck about Bill Gates' comments.
I hope we break $11,000 tonight.
we fucking did it!!!!!!!!
Seems like a lot of people just learned the term "pump and dump" and are not afraid to use it to describe everything that happens.
**Bull Return? Bitcoin Eyes $11K After Upside Break**

https://www.coindesk.com/bull-return-bitcoin-eyes-11000-following-upside-break/

View

-Bitcoin looks set to test $11,000 today and could extend gains to $11,385 (weekly 10-MA). A violation there would shift attention to key resistance levels: the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline and the descending trendline.

-A daily close above the descending trendline would allow for a stronger rally to $17,400 (inverse head and shoulders breakout target as per the measured height method).

-Bearish scenario: Rejection at the weekly 10-MA, followed by a quick drop below $9,280 (Feb. 25 low) would add credence to the bearish weekly RSI and trigger a sell-off to $8,000-$7,800.
Segwit adoption 25%, nice!
10% increase is nice. Hope it jumps again next week. 
Leave the wall a dragon is coming ;o
Hopefully the next train from New York is about to leave the station. 
Volume decreasing slowly, 24H % too.Time to wait the next wave, its fading right now.(Can be wrong blabla, dont know truth blabla, but open your eyes ;)
the sell offs... jesus
Curious to see where it will stop to go down, waiting to the next bull wave.
Why is nobody talking about theBitcoinPrivate fork tomorrow?
Green Candle Time (GCT) 
Segwit transaction percentage seems to be rising steadily now. Over 22%.
http://segwit.party/charts/
So I updated to Core v0.16 but it won't generate any segwit addresses. It just generates legacy addresses starting with 1. What do
There is a recent block with only a single transaction, the reward. How does this happen?  https://blockchain.info/block-height/511243
Is there a web base that shows volume of bitcoin being sold/bought?
Good , i like it
really something unusual in the world of crypto
~10.8K resistance is strong.
Interested in knowing where people stand on reversing transaction in the case of theft - read an article today about the rise of people who have their bitcoin stolen when they are kidnapped and tortured for their private keys or seeds .

If all technology is designed to make human life easier in some fashion then shouldn‚Äôt the human element of the system always come before the underlying tech ? 
Volume has been stupid low on GDAX. 
Right now at $10,500 there is a 380 BTC buy wall. Please still be there if it dips down to there.ü§§

EDIT:

I know they are fake. It would just be nice if one was true some day.
You can't take this down!!! Do you hear me BEAR's!??! YOU CAN'T DO IT!!!
weak hands just send me ur coins to hodler for you. its better this way

There's a lot of resistance at every number.
Dont look for dump and pump. Look for true big picture. What does big picture say? Where does one see big picture?

On the chart? 

On the block exploration?

In satoshi's vision?

No. No. No. 

Big picture in inside you. Look inside you see big picture. Then you decide what to do. 
Okkkkk next train, let's push it !
To the wall guys, remember the dead at 8700, fight for them ! ahah.
i need a good tracking website
xferred from Electrum bech32 to Bitcoin Core 0.16.0 bech32: https://blockchain.info/tx/cbc09c1c342038a158f7b66a05f4f7cd036ab2761827edebdc9e4123adca3a51

1.151 sat/B...total cost just over 2 cents, though it did sit in the mempool for 3 hours.

The xfer costs don't need to be THIS low for it to be successful, I would've been fine with 10-20 sat/byte but was in no rush for this xfer and wanted to see how long it'd take to get processed with such a low fee.


lol huge buy wall at 10594 on bittrex
[deleted]
good
Huge sell wall at $10,750. Pretty big sell wall at $10,650.
What is this shitty drop....Will just hold for now, tired to see this.

The fact it broke 11k and couldn't even stay near it isn't good.
Sell it will fall shortly

Pump and dump - day trades paradise.

MY GOD THE FUCKING SELL WALLS!!
You need 65 bitcoin to move the market .5%.
Bitcoin is possibily forming an inverse head and shoulder with an upside around $17600 if we can close above $11800 with a few consecutive candles, feel free to watch my analysis:

UPPP UPPPPPPPP!!! MOON üòÇ
Anyone think Stratis will recover to former glory? like 15$+.
time to  shorting again
Hm, is it just me or that when BTC plunges, DGD (DigixDAO) increases in value? I've seen that a few times already. IS there something I am missing here?
Couting hours untill dump....
Pump has ended, get ready for hard dump to $7k.
I bet in the near future there will be a specific new brand of S&M where a dominatrix ‚Äútortures‚Äù their submissive partner to try and get their private keys, and by ‚Äúprivate keys‚Äù I mean their genitals.
Dumpening is imminent. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbbKjDjMDok
Great forecast for next few months, but one must be cautious. IT department of a Godman sachs today announced that bitchain and block chain technolog  used in bitcoin can be actually given proper use by their IT. SOon you will see more big buisness and true moon will happen. But first - control your emotion. Only with controlled emption can invester be like Warent Buffey
What are your guys thoughts about BTC and the BTCP fork happening in less than 24hrs. I feel like the only reason bitcoin shot up and stabilized right underneath the major trend line is due to general people and whales stocking up to claim their BTCP. Once BTCP is claimed, will the bots reactive causing drastic BTC fluctuations again? Just curious to hear your guys thoughts are. I certainly hope this isn't the case, I just feel like something fishy is going on. 
Can someone print somd tether so I can get lambo this year
Bots on GDAX are working hard
This pump and dump is becoming a joke. No wonder major usage has dropped nearly 70%. Once the price hits 13k I‚Äôm selling all my crypto and re investing in futures. I don‚Äôt care if I lose 4K per coin. The crypto market will be devolved within the next 12 months
I think this coin explains what all crypto is https://pyramid-coins.com
Curious to know when numbers like 666 show up does anyone get excited or panic sell. I personally get excited, not just when 666 shows but other numbers too. It would be cool to study the frequency of numbers with certain symbology behind them affect the movements.
Sing bah bah King Phillip the Black sing bah bah bahbahbahhh.
