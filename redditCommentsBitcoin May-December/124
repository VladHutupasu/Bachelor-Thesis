Daily Discussion, January 23, 2018
I am facing a moral dilemma: if I sell now the price will shoot up which will benefit everyone, except me. Hmmm 
Bloody hell! If it has to go lower as 8k to restart the fucking engine again, what are you waiting for? I had enough of 2018 all ready 😤
Bitcoin on Newsnight now... The last I remember it being on Newsnight was way, way back in September when it was the end of Bitcoin, the bubble bursting. Not one of the presenters had anything positive to say about it. Now however there is no talk of tulips and bubbles, it's about how it works, I see that as progress!
WE DONT SELL MOTHERFU***S 
10k wheeeee
Come on South Korean whales, jump back on the ship already. Missing ya’ll
Tons of good news in the books and Bitcoin still not doing great. 
After the last two days manipulation and we are still strong! I will hold bitcoin FOREVER
Dont sell.  Be smart. Be patience. Too much money wainting to join this market
I love how your emotions turn from absolute disgust and panic if you are hodling, into sweet excitement if you have fiat.
bitcoin goes up, bitcoin goes down. you can't explain that. 
Someone left me a mean inbox message telling me that I'm an idiot and that Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin and something about removing the original code and they reference "Segshit" blah blah 

I don't even really understand what they're yammering about but it was very aggressively worded and it almost ruined 5 mins of my morning :(

I didn't know where else to share my feelings.

It's a long way to the top, if you wanna rock n' hoooold
- CME contracts will end at 26 January 2018;
- http://www.goblockchainconnect.com/ at 26 January 2018;
- https://wbcsummit.org/ at 27 January 2018;
- Lighting network are already in use in some main global exchanges(eg. Bitflayer);
- Major exchanges will announce soon segwit adoption;
- 6 Korean banks are aiming to simultaneously open/allow deposits and withdrawals to exchanges as of 30 January 2017;

So , why FOD when future is still bright?
What exactly does "FUD" mean? See it often and all I can make of it is someone who is anti crypto currency.
Ok now, stop talking FUD's and panic guys, the green light is shining, just enjoy the roller coaster, "up moment".
you guys checked mempool lately? we are at like 1/2 of what it was a couple days ago, amazing how fast its clearing up
What's a good option for USB cold storage? Should I wait for the ledger nano s in late March?

The longer the pullback ... the bigger the bullrun , sounds like good advice huh?
Guys, it's important to have a certain amount of skepticism considering how little weight is given to facts these days. Before investing (or dumping) any investment, do your research into what it is you are actually investing. There are so many people who are eager to give you advice because they usually stand to gain financially from your decisions. The basis of science is peer review. You cannot confirm on your own what will happen to the "price" of bitcoin at any point in the future, but you can verify with simple maths that it does work today. Be careful out there, happy hodling.
get ready for space travel
support hodling strong
Here we go, On to a Million!!!!!!!
Everyone prep your Vegeta 9k memes! 
I’m thinking about buying either some Bitcoin or ,Litecoin . Just 150-200£ that i can afford to lose which one should i go for?
Would be nice to see a rally between now and the Friday CME contracts expiring.
What the hell did I just miss, is there a reason why rate skyrocketed in the last 2 hours?
[deleted]
Up dammit 
Anyone else think our futures friends are doing a test run for Friday? 
Hey BITCOIN. COME ON MAN! LETS PUSH THIS ISHHHHH PAST 20K!! LETS GET A MOVE ON! 
At least it isn’t free falling anymore.

Are there any wallets that work with a chrome book?

Will a Trezor/ Ledger work with a chrome book?

Thanks!
So whats with the $46million sell wall at 13000 gdax
Strap in boys
I just bought a mining contract. Has anyone done this? The ROI seems really good for BTC right now. I didn't buy a contract with any of the weird "you can earn .5 BTC a day" people. I researched it an this seems legit.
wth is happening on Finex on 11500 price? whale fight?
Just wondering... if all the alts are following BTC... why don`t I just sell my alts for BTC. What`s the point diversifying? 
how many bitcoins would it take to move the market 1%?
In these countries, the local fiat is less stable than Bitcoin

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-highest-inflation-rates-world-170226245.html

You gotta imagine that, even though BTC is volatile, if you live in one of these places, it gives you a chance to minimize your losses and even make gains. A person could at least move their money back and forth between crypto and fiat to mitigate the loss of value.
Why is everybody so afraid goddamn..The whole idea behind bitcoin is great and ofcourse crypto are the future.

All those countries just want to control the crypto, this is good for everyone! Just hodl and relax
9k coming... I love, time to buy more.
I am anxious wainting for the month of March and the prices pump so fast.
The people dont imagine how much money are waintg to join this market, and this moment is just part of the game. 
We will see big profits this year for who are patience.
Time to buy is now guys
Choo choo mofo's.  The BTC train to $20k is leaving the station...
Why are prices dipping so low?  Everytime i check the crypto everything is down.  What is going on?

OMG cant watch btc value lossing like that ..any bad news for this huge dump ?
It was always the case that the BCH hard fork was going to impact on sentiment re. Bitcoin. The same pot of money is now invested in 2 coins rather than one. Whatever dubious "features" BCH was going to add were always going to be overshadowed by the impact of negative sentiment. This was explained to Ver on numerous occasions, but there is no one as blind as a man who cannot see.
Can you feel the incoming moon? 🔥🌚
Any recommendation on this frustrating day ?
Are we out of the woods?
Struggling to find an exchange to use, I’ve been looking around for something reliable with good customer service and the ability to sort something out when it goes wrong but every website review I’m looking at has hundreds of people complaining about lost money or no response from customer service...
Why is it that gdax charts says it a low of 9945 at 6:50-6:55 am est on 5m candles? I watched that happen, and it never crossed 10k. Any ideas?
Buying orders coming in now. Lets see how the resistance is to go up. 
Well, this is interesting. Felt we were heading for $9k for sure. Can it hold up?
How long does it usually take for a withdrawal from gdax to get into your bank account?

Folks who were in before the end of 2017 ramp up.   What made you decide to put money into crypto?  Especially money that’s not just pocket change. (For me it would be anything above a grand). 

Curious to hear how people were exposed and when you had the aha moment.  Because so many of us knew about it. Heard about it but never saw it as an Investment but more of technology and didn’t pay too much attention to it

Thanks in advance for sharing. 
Invested 6000 into bitcoin and lost 3,500. I’ve 2,500. What would be the best way to get my money back? 
Hi!

This might be a stupid question but I just have to ask.

I have bought BTC for about €150 on the 18th from Bitpanda. However, now I am constantly losing value while 1 BTC is almost worth exactly the same that it was on the 18th. I am currently sitting on €132.  
  
My question is: Is there a fee for keeping your BTC in said exchange? Will they charge periodically for this?  
  
Thank you for the answer.
Get some perspective. Stop staring at the minute by minute changes. Have a look at the one-year logarithmic chart to find out where it’s all heading!
No body loves crypto anymore. Crash and burn the whole lot. Meanwhile I will still hodl because I don't care a fu@k
The US tax selling season is almost here:

1)  US was late to the party,  meaning US represents a disproportionally large number of 'bag holders'.

2) Many inexperienced noobs started day trading, and got caught exposed during the crash so near the Holidays.  They don't have the cash now to pay taxes on their winning trades in 2017,  and are sitting on under water bitcoin and praying for a recovery.

3) As the tax filing deadline approaches , more and more of these noobs realize they have to raise cash to pay taxes,  they'll sell whatever they have to to raise cash.  That includes their under water bitcoin.  

EDIT: 4) You can't get an excuse from the late payment penalty because "you have an investment that needs to go up before I could pay".  

I watched the NASDAQ during the Internet bubble's first tax related selloff,  it was by far the steepest!



Please go up, please go up! Lol
I personally think the price is being manipulated. Don't know how or by who, but it doesn't make sense that we haven't hit heavier buy resistance by now 
if(hasSegwitAdoption() && hasLightningAdoption()) {
    price++;
} else {
   price--;
}
Media.  Mainstream media dips it’s toe in crypto and thinks it knows everything in 1 min.

When my grandpa says bitcoin crashed hard I knew the “stupid news” got to him.
Don't you see?? BLIND stupid people who are selling at these prices.

They are manipulating you to sell and to keep the price low until the CME contracts are over. (26, january)

Just look at Bitcoin price untill 17 dec. (when the contracts start) From then, it went only down. Not immediately, because it would be too obviously, but slowly decreasing. They would like to drag it even lower, but don't sell, you will regret it in february
It said it before and I’ll say it again wrong way dammit 
**Fifty** BTC forks this year?

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-23/bitcoin-may-split-50-times-in-2018-as-forking-craze-accelerates

WTF - you just trying to Destroy yourselves?

Forkgen. "This is a Bitcoin fork coin generator. Use at your own risk."

https://forkgen.tech/faq

**"Q: How should exchanges decide to list one fork but not another?**

A: Exchanges should be obligated to split and distribute all arbitrary fork coins despite the systems expense and security risk. Who are they to decide what makes one fork more legitimate than any other?"
Fasten your seatbelts!
The Link on the website doesn't work. 
Location: bitcoin.org main page footer.
"Bitcoin.org is community supported: 3FkenCiXpSLqD8L79intRNXUgjRoH9sjXa"

Which Community? 
come on people relax, everybody talk about goverments, china, bots, whales etc.. last month the increase was enormus, it has to be happen. Them who sold between 19.000-16.000 waiting to buy again in the half price and then the train will start again.
Bitcoin is in very good condition. 2018 will be an unbelievable good year. #lightning 
To the moon! (And back). I'm looking forward to boarding at 5k for the next journey.
Don't tease me no more short it down!
Just researched the price trends since 2013 for this particular period, Nov-March, very similar pattern, although there is a different situation now, the only way to really help crypto is get yourself educated, do not read mainstream news or feeds that promote different actions for the benefit of particular people, if the community would stick togehter and Hodl, the Cme would go to negative, belief is what make us strong, 
on the other note, the world economy is deeply in red, when the next bubble start to burst and recession comes (appr sept-dec 2018)crypto will be the safe haven, from that on it will be no return to fiat fraud. Buy and Hodl now. Invest in good projects which are creating value for marketplace, good ICO can bring you a lot of value. Invest in people and their vision. That is as little we can do to create change, Change starts from everyone of us.
how can i trade othercoins when they all in dropping? plz help me (:
Total Crypto Market Cap by EOY: 1 trillion

% of Total Market Cap for BTC: 34.85%

Total BTC Market Cap EOY = 348,516,471,512

Number of BTC EOY = 17,000,000 (?)

Price per BTC EOY = $ 58,824
Does anyone know an online broker who doesn't have an expiration date on bitcoin shares?

Can someone explain why the prices of major coins are moving up/down almost at same time even though their prices relative to each other is market determined?  I mean, you don't see USD/Yen/GBP moving up/down together ...
Why do CME bitcoin futures matter much when all crypto are dropping? 
(WAKE UP! YOU ARE OWNED BY GOV AND CORPS!)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX6VMNpVjn8]

The top 1% did not calculate into they game that if Bitcoin falling they altcoins will became ***WORTHLESS***! Let's see how much will cost one Ripple if the Bitcoin price goes down to 7.000 USD. Last time when Bitcoin was 9.000 USD than Ripple was about 0.89 !!!! Basically what the governments did is made you sell your Bitcoins and now regulate how you can buy back them. If the altcoins what you get for exchange your Bitcoins fall down to 0 USD you can go out to the garden and hang yourself because governments and U.S corporate media just wiped your money out of your packet. This happens if you listen to them and you are speculative. You going to loose now everything! 
Hello all! I am new to crypto (been tracking various coins for 2 months). I am in for the long haul, no desire to day trade, is investing at $10,000 worthwhile? Or do people foresee a larger dip on the horizon?
How are people setting aliases for https://lnmainnet.gaben.win/?

I have a Lightning mainnet full node set up following [these instructions.](https://medium.com/@dougvk/run-your-own-mainnet-lightning-node-2d2eab628a8b)
banks need some FUD?-!
This is an example of why you should NEVER lose faith in bitcoin. +1100 up since the bottom about 4 hours ago. It may dip again but this just goes to show how quickly it can recover and everyone’s mindsets can change again. TO THE MOON. 
I want to have gdax to deposit through my credit card and withdraw to my bank account. Both are already linked, but how do I make sure this happens?
This sub is dead these days..
I sent BTC through gdax to binance 3 hours ago, 0 confirmations 226 bytes....any idea what to do now?


2:1 means that I'll get $2 back for every dollar invested basically 100% upside. Electric and maintenance is factored into the cost of the contract. Their site is seemingly really transparent
Yesterday showed us that no one can predict bitcoin. Get out if you’re scared, otherwise enjoy the incredible ride this coin will take you on! 
Hey, I'm trying to send some funds from Binance to my bech32 Segwit wallet address. It keeps giving me a "withdraw address error"

Is this because Binance does not support Segwit or bech32?
Their support hasn't been very helpful. They keep telling me to check the FAQ section which does not have a topic on why this error is occurring. Is bech32 not widely implemented yet in this regard so there can be trouble sending to these addresses? 

Thanks
Hi Everyone,
Can someone please tell me why is Bitcoin "stuck" for a month+ now?
I saw some serious action up until mid December of last year, do you think that the futures contracts
on the CME and CBOE (and soon wall street) has anything to do with it?

When will this disaster end? I'm crying every day, looking at BTC price
Im on Coinbase and the fees sucks ! Any better opinion ?
Forget about BTC mooning. I'll be happy if it goes up slow and steady... maybe a 1% or 0.5% gain a day. That would be a lot healthier.

Apologies if this was posted (I didn't see it anywhere). Hope you folks enjoy it!

Ouch!!

Wait til Late Feb, that's when the party resumes.
There's a support near 9000 usd per BTC.
Incoming bulls move out the way 
The storm isn’t over.. the new lunar year is on the 16th of February.. hodl on tight 
BTC is just responding to liquidity pressures between banks and centralised exchanges because of regulators in some countries, things will look much better in a week or two. It’s still a bull market
Oh mama. Get ready to open up the purse strings and buy buy buy...
I don't know when, but this next run up will be one you do not want to miss out on. 
Or it could be slow until late Spring. But my magic ball tells me that this shit is going main-main-stream, LN just has to take the world by storm. 

Any thoughts on Amazon registering new domains with much relation to crypto. Brand protection or is this a pivot to accepting/exchanging crypto?
Not trying to troll anyone but I’m honestly curious - how can bitcoin continue as the gold standard of crypto currency when its transactions take so long and fees are so much higher than so many other coins vying to take its place?
When will I ever learn... buy high and HODL :(
Based on the recent news with the lightning network do you guys think it will be fully operational within 6 months and if it gets adopted what percent of the altcoins will most likely die off/ which ones?
[deleted]
Since futures expires every month from Jan until March is this going to be the norm around the time they expire i.e. prices dip?

At this rate the value of BTC will be eroded further or am I wrong?


This dip will go on for a short time relatively, by next month we should be in the bull market again... If you would like to buy, now is the time to set those buy orders.
Major strip tease going on with those sexy whales liquidating short positions.

Is there a collection of common nocoiner arguments and rebuttals? Would be a nice reference to have instead of random googling and reciting from my failing memory.
Any thoughts on what Bitcoin's price should be, based on it's fundamental value, not speculation?
Dotcom vs Crypto

https://redd.it/7skzff
has the BTC bubble ends after the peak or will be the future of currency that we can use in our life ?Knowing that its founder is unknown and it is known that everything unknown does not continue to the end.

very important question for discussion
Time to give up?
