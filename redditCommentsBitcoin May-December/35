Struggled to hold 8k.... so I guess it's a good chance of falling back to 7
FOMO coming soon...
**Support The Bulls**
WTF was that?
**Bullish Outlook at the moment**
https://www.coindesk.com/8500-bitcoin-eyes-gains-with-key-support-at-7900/

**Bitcoin remains in a bullish territory for now and is looking at further gains, though a pullback is possible if support at $7,900 is breached, according to technical studies.**

The cryptocurrency's first attempt to scale the long-term descending trendline (drawn from the Dec. 17 high and Jan. 6 high) failed on Monday and prices fell below $8,000 as expected at 12:00 UTC.

It's worth noting that the Bollinger bands (seen on the chart below) show the volatility dropped after BTC dipped below the psychological mark, likely signaling indecision among the bears. As a result, it is not surprising the dip below $8,000 was short-lived.

As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,145 on Bitfinex, largely unchanged on a 24-hour basis, but could soon report further gains as the hourly Bollinger bands indicate scope for a retest of $8,400-$8,500.

And btc takes a shit again
buy when everyone sells

sell when everyone buys
But Marius said....... 
in the future 1AGI = 1BTC
Talk about obvious price manipulation.

Verge - $1.3B traded on a market cap of $1B.  It's the same coins wash traded over and over.

Most of these wash trading are through XVG/BTC.  In other words, BTC's price is artificially sustained and most of the volume is not real.

So next time anyone says there's $B of trading in BTC, think again.  It's an artificial market.
Back up to 8000? Or higher?
What ever you choose to do Bitcoin, we support you. :)
Are we Mooning guys? Or is Bitcoin playing with my emotions again.  I needz to know.
the bart simpson pattern has started again
Bart Simpson head means we will see another upward movement sell at ur own risk. 
Today is last chance to load up before take off 
We need a medic in here to stop the bleeding.
Price rise from 6.8k to 8k was all just the short squeeze. Absolutely nothing bullish about it, just too many bears. Now back down to retest 6k and likely into to the 5s
A lot of doodling around 8.1

Come on someone - this is boring.

Someone call it and make an ass of themselves.  :)
bout to rocket back to 8k. prepare for launch
There was a tiny drop back yesturday and alllll the trolls and fudsters were out but.... where dey at doe? 
great buy opportunity
It's only 7.50am in New York so we have plenty of time.  
Hey! This is my first time posting here so I'm sorry if this isn't the place for this.

I have a very low income and every cent counts. I had the idea of investing a really low amount (>30€) in a crypto currency and withdraw something like 5€/week, is this feasible? I have no interest in risking a lot of money for a chance at winning a lot or becoming rich, just a ~~low and steady~~ extra source of ~~capital~~ money.

Edit: a friend of mine is really interested in the topic and thus I understand the basics of it, but he's obsessed with becoming rich (he also doesn't have financial problems like me) and I cba to ask him for advice lol.

the 1h chart is kinda similiar to that 8.3k - 7.9k drop. we need to break out 
This might be a stupid question, but what is the advantage/disadvantage of investing in a fund like GBTC instead of directly into Bitcoin?

My friend does it this way and he says he prefers it this way because it's traded on the stock exchange so it's less shady and it allows you to do it in tax advantage retirement accounts. Only downside he says is that can only trade when market is open but not a big deal if you in it for the long haul.

Is he right? Is there something else he's missing?

What's the name of the bitcoin-youtube personality who looks like he's sitting on a throne, and may or may not have a crown, but definitely always wears a Rolex? He's brutally honest, swears a lot, funny guy. I forgot his name and want to subscribe to his channel, thanks. 
Best exchanges to buy some bitcoin?  
At what point, WOULD YOU ABSOLUTELY SELL? What is your 'it's too high for me not to sell' ?
And I must say, I've been going through these brokers to try find a second and third one so I'm not exposed to just one and they are crap. All of them are terrible. 
Yes, guys, we are back to the game. Just like someone said, when most people think it's going down, it's going up. lol
upwards
intriguing sh-t 
where's everybody at?
To the moon?
7800 has to stay. Next stop is 7500 then
With the 50 day still crossing the 200, the resistance is strong. RSi is high and stoch is trending down so this was inevitable 
Lots of great news. Propably some kind of fomo trying to rise the price.

Bears are weak
Looks like the Bulls are starting to wake up.....
I see the Bart Simpson patterns are back. 
That escalated quickly from $8,059 to $8,285 
So far,  tax day 2018 is acting just like tax day 2001,  uneventful.  Tax related selling didn't magically stop on April 15 2001 because  it's perfectly legal to hold off actually paying your taxes,  you just accrue penalties and interest. 

If we carry the comparison forward,  the low of the year will occur in early May,  as the reality of further tax related selling weighs on the market.  At some point the final capitulation occurs and after that the slow multi-year crawl.   

Yea,  history does repeat itself

Might want to set your stop sells a little lower next time so you don’t miss out when it bounces back. 
**Come On Bulls**
I was thinking of selling my bitcoin, but then I realized that when bitcoin goes down in value, all my altcoins go down in value. 

Don't sell low! Save the alts!

god save the king!
There was an article that Bitcoin and alt coin exchanges are under investigation in New York, causing the price to plummet.
There is **no way** this will go down far - stop panicking.

And the day traders - you should stop trying to day trade BTC - it is a 50/50 game - you are just gambling with poor stakes.
Does the news that the NY attorney general launched an investigation into the major crypto exchanges have to do with the price going down? 
Last minute selling to cover tax bills or is that too naive to believe?
And now squeeze all the shorts, please...
Haha I told you it was fake!
Can someone turn it off for about 30 seconds then turn it back on again? 
Remember just a couple days ago we were all happy it was 7700.  We are still hanging tough near 7900 after that dip, its a roller coaster ride but we are still trending up.
This is crashing to $7597 at 01:30GMT. Get out with your lives.

Im sick of this going sideways, Where are the FUD minions? We need to get this down to the 6's again!
My name is stokelycalm and I’m the biggest shorter. I see tremendous optimism in today’s daily discussion. I can’t wait until Bitcoin crashes to a $4300 bottom and all you HODLers are pissing you pants. I’ll watch panic ensue and buy lots of Bitcoin at rock bottom prices.
This cryptocurrency 2018 summer will grow 9000%. Dont miss the train. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMqMRs34_u8

Tight consolidation happening on GDAX right now. Up or down? I say down, cause it's about that time (although I'm glad to be wrong). Place your bets.

We will see today of the tax deadline was really an influence in the market, but at this point we have to start considering that Bitcoin's behaviour might have changed fundamentally. We are very far behind where it was this time last year. It might be that the introduction of derivatives is having a major influence.
