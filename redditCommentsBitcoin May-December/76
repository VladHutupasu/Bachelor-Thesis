Daily Discussion, March 11, 2018
Middle finger pattern is forming.
Last Week Tonight is calling out this subreddit in a story about Crypto
I've updated my crash charts (comparing this crash with historical crashes): http://www.habrador.com/p/bitcoin/
M.Gox sell the next BTC in Septemeber not before so not worry.... https://coinstelegram.com/2018/03/10/the-next-court-proceeding-for-mt-gox-bankruptsy-is-postponed-until-september-2018/

April is where the nightmare ends
20K volume on a weekend. wow. 
TO THE MOOOOOOON
I think it's safe to conclude that the recent crash has been far less severe, judging from objective factors, compared with the crash from ATH in December towards the final valley and bounce at 6th of February. This time Kobayashi hasn't sold off anything, and as far as we know the Mt Gox debt is more or less paid off.

While the price of Bitcoin is still affected by fears from the recent crash, combined with fears of near future drops, I personally doubt to see a drop below $8000 at this point in time. At the moment a lot of potential buyers naturally want to wait and see where the final bottom occurs, which reduces the demand presently.

On the other hand of the spectrum we have bitcoin miners and potential sellers that expect a rise towards 10-11k levels within a week or the coming weeks. Considering the recent crash and the fears in the market they might have to settle for 9.5k presently even though they consider 10k+ to be a reasonable market price in a market that isn't affected by strong fears.

The question is then how low the sellers and miners are willing to go below their expected sale price. On the one hand, if they wait, the prices will eventually recover from the crash. On the other hand, if they need cash right away they might sell now if they fear a further drop.

If the market sellers expects a return to 10-11k levels within a foreseeable future, then every thousand dollars below this line is considered a substantial loss of potential revenue. This is why I don't expect to see prices below 8k at the moment; it may happen as a quick visit from sellers that need urgent cash, but a few exceptions won't dictate the price for long.

This is why I think that predictions of a price below 5.8k is wishful thinking: yes, I would love such low prices to accumulate more BTC, but I don't think there would be enough sellers that would consider that price range to be beneficial. Since 11k is a definite possibility in the coming weeks, only a fool would sell below the worst crash bitcoin has seen, from which it has recovered remarkably since then. Further drops may happen, but the question is how likely a particular drop is compared to expected sale prices.

You could make quite a bit of profit with this pattern. Until everyone starts doing it 
I thought people said the price of BTC usually drops on Sunday. Is this Sunday different than the previous ones?
Next resistance at 11.5K
Charts are telling me we're going up in the next 24 hours.

[Bounced off 4H MACD trendline](https://www.tradingview.com/x/xP7sNSqD/)

[Oversold 1D Stoch RSI is rising](https://www.tradingview.com/x/hZCKlKvK/)

[Mid-term trendline broken with decent volumes](https://www.tradingview.com/x/guo9dNKT/)

[Bounced off 1D Bollinger Bands](https://www.tradingview.com/x/jg7hwbsZ/)

[Last two daily candles almost in Bullish Engulfing pattern](https://www.tradingview.com/x/jg7hwbsZ/)

[We're very close to EMA200](https://www.tradingview.com/x/zczbCpkq/)

Also, my guts. No, it's only my guts. Ignore the crap above.

edit: forgot to mention [Overbought 1H Stoch RSI](https://www.tradingview.com/x/sCH4ouag/) which would suggest a potential dump in the next few hours.

Bah. I just wish this stuff to be any reliable.


Yeah if you guys could go ahead and buy that dip it would really help my long position lol
Day and night from the predictive posts last night, lol. Doom and Gloom to Gleeful Optimism.
Massive green dildo inbound

Pumping
holy shit bitcoin, calm your tits
TO THE MOOOOOOOOON
Fucking called it. Scroll down to the comment 1 hour ago. :) 
Best website to read Live Crypto news?
Second jump incoming? :) prepare..
to me it looks like someone is angry and is trying to buy every bitcoin in existence. My guess is it's Vladimir Putin or John McAfee
So, am I caught half-way between the run-up to the 11.5K greed/panic sell?  Or is the market treading water after its $1000 morning run-up and ready to punish FOMO'ers like me eager to catch a car ride right before it goes all Thelma and Louise off the cliff?

(Hours earlier I had two good tips that BTC was on its way to 7K and another saying it was about to jump... they were each so convincing I couldn't decide what to do... so I went to breakfast).
So how does this go now with Daylight Savings Time .... is the daily close now at 8pm Eastern Time (USA) ???
Buckle up buckaroos.
it will be at 13k in 7 days wach this space
Next target 9.400k. 

Bye Sunday 
Welcome Monday 
nice pump whales, 8k by tomorrow morning. 
Is this rise related to the latest news on the Lightning Network?

How much 'profit' do you need to make before filing tax on it?
wtf is this jump?
Where are the mother fucking so called expert traders yesterday calling everyone to sell? I'm sick and tired of seeing these people mislead new comers to Bitcoin.  This forum should be to celebrate Bitcoin success and technology not to duped everyone to sell it. Moderators, Please ban anyone who encourage selling Bitcoin in this forum. Let them open new forum for their selling. Otherwise, all the new comers see is SELL SELL SELL.
This is my first week in. Is there any other color than red?
So where's that *7K by Sunday* clown now?
btc has become a trade object .... forget the ath
Market is crazy at the moment, love it
Wouldn't it be great to have another huge FOMO rush?

Waiting to jump back in like double Dutch.
Morning America. Pumping up like hell. Careful
How much of the MtGox selloff has already happened? Is there any way of finding proof of how much has been sold, such as a wallet address?
Shouldn't the Pump start tomorrow, not today?
$9400 still tough to crack

Since last week, Everyday at this time,  starting from 16:00 UTC, what will happen?   
Positive Sunday movement coming up very soon based on last few Sundays. I know it's not scientific, but it usually goes up around 1pm EST https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/81wvhe/daily_discussion_march_04_2018/dv64qmd/ 
Does the Gox whale trustee also know his wallet probably has hundreds of thousands of BCH on it as well? I mean, its been sitting in a wallet during all these forks.  Its free money to Gox's creditors. That should be a no brainer.

Well, it appears this Sunday bloody Sunday pretty well proves Bitcoin has established a sleeping cat trendline.
https://cointelegraph.com/news/google-searches-for-bitcoin-slump-in-synchronicity-with-bitcoins-price
Easily over 10k untill us wake up!
Well at least me made it one day without crashing...off to a good start again!
Question about mining - with regards to mining farms that have multiple mining machines does each machine have a set of public and private keys linked to it or is it possible to link multiple machines to one set of private and public keys ?

Where Iâ€™m confused is from what I know transactions are gathered up from the mem pool to form a block , miners add their public key to the block as the coin base then the machines try and find the nonce value - is each machines trying to find a value for one block or are they all trying to solve for multiple different blocks ?
I think the FUD bots are buying large quantities of BTC rather than selling right now. Nobody say a word about this anywhere online. Let's ride this up, my brothers!!!
It's going to 0 quick sell everything
Just pump this up to 9K so I can sell. Untrustworthy Shitcoin, I believed in you. I came in at 10.2K, to see it fly up to 11.6K, to 7.9K. Just pump it up!!
blood in the streets
Early rumours from the G20 meeting are possibly very positive for Bitcoin? 
shortest pump ever?
Yaaay we closed above 9.5ish! Tomorrow weâ€™ll prob see a small correction down to 8.5 range res, and then start climbing up again with 1-5 EW to res lvl 11.7.
If you want a stable currency, use one with a central bank
Ready for the 700$ dump?
Fakeout? Heading down again soon.
[deleted]
hmmm I wonder if this is a start to another rally or just a trap
sorry people, we'll soon be doing our regular dump.
Why won't BTC be abandoned for "newer" cryptos that can do what BTC does faster and cheaper at a mass scale? 
Bitcoin trending back to 8k
Dead cat bounce?
Prediction for tomorrow: down to $8.5K by noon (EST), and down to $7.5K by end of day (EST).


Excellent and free advice that you can make use of.
6k crash coming tonight.
