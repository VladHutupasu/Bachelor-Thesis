Bitcoin: Doing random shit that makes no sense since 2018
Thats literally the Perfect bart simpson weve ever had
Well I guess i'm happy, thought when I woke up we would less than 8k.  
Forecasts of 50k-60k by the end of the year seem to be impossible to me because btc should gain 8k per month then.

We are in the late 80's currently.  It's a thing, it works, no one knows exactly what to do with it, but those in the know are sure it is revolutionary.  A lot of well intentioned people are using it to make things, most of them are objectively useless.  Piles of unscrupulous people are using it to rip other people off in one way or another. Many people see no reason not to just use the phone book instead. It is difficult to use for the average person, but by no means impossible. Somewhere right now someone is being introduced to it. 
Anyone with any doubts about Bitcoin needs to read this thread from 4 years ago:

Same FUD different year.  The more I educate myself on Bitcoin and its history, the stronger my conviction that it will substantially continue to increase in value over time.

Hello everyone and welcome to Pump and Dump Festival 2018.  

Idk what’s most volatile, the Kilauea volcano, North Korea, Megan Markle’s family, or bitcoin.
This is painful.
I see Bart everywhere!
This market is whack, just stay on the sidelines folks. I am a very active trader and HOLDER in a long term position. This action isn't worth trading. Let the bots fuck themselves 
4pm in New York lets move on from this Concensus gathering.  Hopefully, when these big companies and organizations go back to the drawing board Monday they will decide to invest.  
Just some thoughts on the current state of the market. Is it possible that we have reached a point where all the weak hands have been shaken out and only hodlers, bears, and people timing the market are left? Hodlers greatly outnumber everyone else hence the insanely low volume maybe? Thus this creates a situation where a single whale can pump the market and then dump once others pile on some time later for profit? I think this would explain all the "Barts." 

The people that FOMOed last year aren't going to come back unless they see/hear that Bitcoin is hitting all time highs again. This is where the institutional money comes in. They need to be buying this shit up to put the price in a good place to get people to want to buy up that normally wouldn't be in this. Whales need to think more long term and not keep fucking us and themselves long term.
Be patient. All in due time. The tech is there. The companies and partnerships are coming in. Don't expect to get rich like people who got in 8 years ago in just a few months. It will take time but it's a given that Blockchain and DLT are here to stay and progressing at a very rapid rate. Most of us are putting in money and just waiting to get rich. Can't be mad that it's taking a little too long lol. I actually feel like this is just a period of big money taking time and strategizing how they will use the crypto space. Wall street guys and large corporations don't just their money around. They are planning and strategizing. Too many big names coming in for crypto to fail. Not sure which coins will be the winners in the long run but we are past the days of 100 percent faith in the dollar and big banks. Strong hands will look back and be grateful they held on. And what has been happening lately is much more realistic and sustainable than December 2017. I want my gains to stay not come and go. So hopefully this is just big money waiting to pick where they want to invest and making smart decisions. I could do without the fomo pump and dumps anyway. I'll bet the gains come after consensus when everyone has heard most of the different pitches and find good entry points for coins they like.
I know the market often does it’s thing for no reason but I was wondering if there’s some news or fud that is causing the recent downward trend?

lol
ouch
If we break 8400 tonight, buckle up 
think we have weathered the storm?
8400 resistance has broken!!!!!
**Support The Bulls!** 
Seriously like torture.  I’m turning it off. 
I just bought more at $8200. Damn you sweet sweet prices that appear to be the bottom. Now, let's go to the moon.
8k the new 6k?  
Bitcoin is acting weird. But I'm still optimistic for the future.
Some body just put up a big buy. Here we go I hope.
"You pumped it up, now I'll pump it down"
CBOE futures expiring today: http://cfe.cboe.com/cfe-products/xbt-cboe-bitcoin-futures  
Volume should be too low to matter, but maybe someone's testing the playing field.
Has anyone got a link to a site that shows daily volume traded for Bitcoin please?
Nice fail pump. It triggered my stop loss order almost right after triggering my stop buy order.
this market is looking worse and worse, not liking this no volume random spike up spike down. This is not good for the health of the market. As a HODLER I am worried.
If we go up from here, we will form a huge inverse head and shoulders pattern.

Moon soon. 😉
Just got back into coin last couple of week. Made the mistake of using Coinbase. Never again. They've had my funds on hold for nearly 2 weeks despite clearing the bank on the 7th. Customer service is beyond crap. Still no word on resolution. How is crypto going to move forward without legitimate exchanges? Serious question.
Bro 1 or 2 days of this bot shit and everyone is acting like a little bitch. Anyways what are your thoughts on what going to happen and why?
Haha buttcoin. 
What a crock of shit at the moment!  Looking like we will be going below $8k at this rate today.  :( 
Performing like hot garbage
**Creeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeptttttttttttttttttooooooooooo!**
 I'm a graduate student, currently conducting research on the cryptocurrency ecosystem and cryptocurrency exchanges.

If you have any free time, I would really appreciate your participation in my survey. I plan to share all my findings with the community once I get enough responses, thanks!

Seems like Bitcoin showed that it cant handle much transactions with low fees. The year back if anyone remember it started, it was great, then the fees fcked up all, a lot of interested peops lost faith in it...

I think in my opinion, the last year \(2017\) was the year that decided it all :\)
Bloody cheer up everyone!

Pump is coming - competitors dead.

Trust me.
I think were coming into "the crash of 2018". Years later this will be but a speck on the ytd graph. 
the daily pump. followed by the daily pump next night 
unfortunately lower highs since a few days 

life so easy for daytraders recently
Thanks for preventing my liquidation Murica, much appreciated. Damn that was close.
Although Consensus was tipped to start a bull run again, I think the fact that it's such a common "assumption" it was too easy a play for the whales/manipulators. Load up while cheap and lets hope the price is "released" and can fly soon.
This is how well people in Tokyo know about cryptocurrency.. What do you think?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3fwH6nKVbU
Everyone seems conflicted.  The market doesn't want to rebound, but everyone is expecting it to with consensus so they're buying at any sign the price will hold at 8200 then discouraged when the price doesn't keep going.
Is possible to see my total bitcoin balance of a single wallet in a block explorer if i used a new address every time i received a transaction? Or am i understanding correctly that this is the point of not re-using wallet addresses?
Good morning, what do you folks expect to see today? 
Ya'll hate me when I talk shit, but it keeps going lower lol.
Reminds me  on that 6.8k - 7.2k pattern til wie had that short sqeeze. Lets hope for another one
Is low trading volume a problem? 
Upward popsicles 
21 Trillion US tax dollars missing, and the sheeple still eating the grass.
kissing my hopes and dreams good bye. No early financial freedom I think.
And it was going so well....all loaded up, 1&#37; to 7&#37; up already looking forward to the US picking up the momentum...

Kabam..! Everything knocked out. Heathen savages. 
How can we get to the moon?

6k coming boys
The recent wedge has broken to the downside with high volume on the drops. Current channel sloping gently upwards looks like a bear flag. I would side much more with placing a short than a long at this stage with next support at 7,900.
Going down is actually a good thing. If we go down into the $7Ks, that means we will go back up after. If we go up now, we're just gonna keep having these dips, and go down. 
Since 2009

Eat my longs, man
I’m happy we’re above 8k too. Seems irrational though because it would be better for me financially if it goes lower so I can buy cheaper coins.  I’m perpetually conflicted. 🤔
i'd be happy at $12k at this rate
Look at last year.... I’m not saying it’s likely or that it’s going to happen but your argumentation is flawed 
Mr.Devasini can take us there. A trillion in tether printing and we'd be there easily. 
Why should I use a phone book to buy stuff?
Great way to put it.
I don't know how to translate the expression more accurately，so i will say it by chinese,you can transalte by google and understand by youself 。This is like a doggerel, representing the Chinese attitude towards BTC.

Easy money, really.
People should stop using the term pump and dump for bitcoin. Illiquid altcoins have pump and dumps but bitcoin is too large and too distributed.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump_and_dump

These large moves are predominantly order book related liquidations and stop losses on BitMEX and bitfinex.


I know what I’ll be hodling at the end of the day 
Tell me something, and thats i am so optimist ;\)
*I see dead Barts.*
So what are u saying to only have usdt 
You're request that whales forgo profit now in order to help btc possibly hit another ath in the future isn't logical. Money now is always better than money later, especially if there is uncertainty involved with those future benefits. Besides, it's unlikely that whales that are truly aiming to manipulate price even care about the technology. They just see an opportunity to take candy from a baby. If btc goes to zero why would they care? They would have sold at the top. 
If a whale has the ability to fuck over everyone else while making out like a bandit, why wouldn't they? This is human psychology 101. They only care about their profit margin, not about the profit margins of others or sustainability of the market as a whole.
Hodlers don't do shit to the market. The market value is established by trading and to trade, you can't hodl. If someone is buying, then there's someone selling.

> The people that FOMOed last year aren't going to come back unless they see/hear that Bitcoin is hitting all time highs again. This is where the institutional money comes in.

Institutional money is already here, in my opinion. They have been here for a while. People confuse *Institutional money* with large amounts of money, which is not true. They been here for a very long time and know how to suck the market dry. 

> Whales need to think more long term and not keep fucking us and themselves long term.

Whalers are here to profit. When the (crypto) market is dry, they will go to somewhere else. 

>They need to be buying this shit up

Thats the problem, all will look year back, and well remembered whats happened, not suitable for low fees with dat volume of transactions, its the "end" in sight? I am not against bitcoin, but this drives me crazy!
it's every cliche I've seen, in one post.
Zzzzz..... td;dr.  

It's just speculation, don't crack your little brain over it.
Honestly it's just regular market movement. We had a nice recovery from the bottom but we were due for a correction. My prediction is that we hit 7800 but then go up from there.
You could probably retrofit something if you wanted but nothing obvious 
The whole world's economy is going to sh!t even gold took a hit just hodl money will come into this market and pms as a safe store of wealth
Not specifically, volume has generally been declining for months and there's been more sell pressure than buy pressure since the price got within touching distance of 10,000.
Wtf are you doing in Venezuela?

Yes, I already pointed in this sub some time ago, the issues with taking US Dollars out of Venezuela and attempting to leave the bolivar currency. It's barely impossible, I might add
You’re delusional 
Same, I just took another mortgage on my home to buy at $8200
Doing the same. $8200 seems to be a strong resistance level. Hasn't dropped below that much for a while. 
It will be fine - 10k soon.

Meanwhile, over on the naughty step:

ZeeCash is the new BeeCash :)

Some shorts got rekt.
Ah, there’s the inverted bart I was expecting last night.   My prediction was early.  
tradingview or cryptowat.ch
1&#37; stop orders? huee
Worried? About volitilty? You may be invested in the wrong asset my dude
I have to be honest. This is no time to be a HOLDER unless you are capable of taking the fall. You may well be in the red for a very long long time.

Money is leaving and it's not coming in. It has been like this since January. 
There’s a lot of money being moved around by people “dipping their toes”.  

I’m a huge Hodler myself. I will be fine if I “lose” my two chunks (both big buys were in the 8ks) but it seems that the powers that be have us on a string.  IMO it’s simple collaboration between two sides.  You guys sell all yours....  we will buy it back and trade you the profits.  Seems like a big bag of shit right now honestly, and I’m pretty positive about it 90% of the time.
I love Coinbase, but will certainly celebrate when a competitor emerges
By 2054, 80% of the world's population will eat bitcoins as their primary means of sustenance.  Why? Because they are delicious, nutritious, and cryptographically secure.
Anyways .................
I think we'll keep going down until 7800. Then flatten out and slowly rise back up.
Yup...hopefully 4k by next month
reeeeeeee
I filled it out. Is my money stolen yet?
I filled it, may I see the study abstract?
Filled it out. Would be interested in the results as well. BTW your question with the list of coins is confusing \- never, sometimes or always trading a coin. What if a person buys and holds but never \(to date\) sells. Is the initial 'buy' a trade? I skipped it because I wonder if simply buying something is actually trading. 
The spike in 2017 happend too soon imo but d/w, once LN kicks in we'll be fine.
So your overall outlook is bullish?
When did you open the position? Risky move imo
Why america? What happened now?
It's your own choice to be manipulated though. And judging by all the panic posts I'd say they're doing an excellent job.
IMO MT Gox Trustee using strength of Consensus Meeting to dump into.  Lots of coins left and apparently the market can't absorb the size being sold.  This will go on til mid september or until bigger players wanting in step up.  Just my opinion
I think that a bunch of people, carefully selected from a set of interviews, does not provide an accurate picture of the entire city of Tokyo, or even less, an accurate picture of the Japanese society in general.

PS: I love that guy who told that he gives 20K per month to his friends to invest in crypto. He surely is an example of the average Japanese citizen. \s
If all the addresses are part of a HD keychain, some explorers let you enter the xpub and view all your addresses

Sunshine and blue skies
hopefully not below 8200, cuz i rebought
I’ve witnessed big time uptrends with low volume 
Not a problem per se just indicates an uncertain market imo
Define low volume. 
Is $21 trillion equivalent to about [20% of all US dollars](http://fortune.com/2017/11/25/lost-bitcoins/) that have ever existed and ever will exist?
No big deal.  Fed can just print another 21 T.
Bitcoin doesn't provide you with financial freedom, if you don't do something useful with your life.

It will just delay the inevitable. 
You need emotional discipline to succeed at trading. A lot of people will learn that the hard way if they sell and don't buy back in lower.
Early financial freedom comes to those who can hold through these dips. 
Probably you are thinking about wrong financial freedom. BTC community standing for avoiding banks, not for Lambos.
Apparently it has nothing to do with the increases in technology, more awareness, less fear of regulation, lower fees, faster transaction times, or just an overwhelming sense of improvement.  Apparently none of that ...
Asking about making short-term profit, then complaining of the volatility? LOL
BTC goes down: Buy


BTC goes up: Sell
Short BTC if you think a dump is coming and long it if you think a pump is coming.
Moon on what catalyst?
Doubt it. I just bought more. 8369 is still a really good price.  In a few months we will be praying for prices this low 
Hah!  Do it, wimp.
You are late to the party.

I shorted 2x at 98.
We have been down many times this year...why do we need to go down again? 
If it does down to 7k, there is 50/50 chance that it will go below 7k.

Dude, this is not an asset with some intrinsic value that gives it a floor value.
Not
I think it went backwards and stalled, but I believe that the BTC market will boom very soon. Scarcity drives economics!
you mean shorts
Username checks out
Sure there are some differences since then, but Considering such a tiny percentage of the world currently owns bitcoin, there is still a long way up to go.   Hardly anyone i know ever heard of bitcoin.   We live in a bubble on this sub.

Whales are not wizards, they're just people with a bunch of coin. They make mistakes too. Stop mystifying them, its so so wrong
That's not exactly true hodlers reduce the float which makes price moves greater all else equal. I mean reducing available coins on the market is the whole plan of that other Fork isn't it? Same reason they have a burn pile
Agreed it's cliche. But doesn't make it any less true. Being pessimistic isn't gonna help the situation. I believe in this so I stay positive until 2020. If we're still here then I'll join the pity party

Fact:  it got up to 8439 then wicked up to 8483.48 on gdax before coming back down.

> 10k soon

You don't know this anymore than anyone else. Might as well be "6k soon."
Thanks.
1% gain can buy me a nice breakfast at McDonalds
You’re what’s wrong with this 
You have a good point, but don't these whales want to make money? How can they if they never let the value increase? Also, the deflationary nature of the coins would encourage HODLING and this will eventually lead to extreme scarcity once weak hands and gamblers are shaken out by the manipulation of whales. And then HODLERS dine on the Moon...
Being a hodler is not about immediate time, 2-3 months or so, we will see our money in the distance. We are not losing we are refraining from earning more than we already will. True hodlers don't sell cause a fall. 

We won't fall as many shorters do.  
Think about why. we have been in a downtrend for 5 months. If the market establishes a real up trend that goes for more than 3 months you're going to see people coming back pretty quick. The number one rule of trading is trade the trend. I don't think a lot of people unless they have Suicidal Tendencies want to short Bitcoin but the a lot of longs question buying into a stagnant market. When 12,000 is taken out and especially if that happens on high-volume we're going to get to 20 fairly quickly. 
I got in a good price as a HODLER (around 6K). I understand between 6K and 11.5K is just a range and expected to move around a lot in there. I believe longer term with markets moving towards accepting institutional money and custody available, we will see a huge inflow of money. There has been very little volume lately, seems like people are sitting on the sidelines and just waiting. I think the mindset of original adopters is to just HODL and people like myself who are later adopters who believe in the underlying value of crypto will also HODL. This is what will create a floor in the price. It's a matter of time before price moves higher and when it does I think it will be as aggressive as the move in DEC 2017.
Lol 
I think we'll keep fluctuating until real adoption happens which won't be BTC. Then it's curtains.
Hopefully $14k 
Dude 4K would be a complete technical breakdown. Like not even in the cards. If that was to happen you really don't want to buy. Not for a while and not until you understand what happened. If it goes to 4K the chances of it going to one k are extremely high. If it goes to 13K you definitely want to be buying because that will mean we cleared the 12000 resistance and it's game on. 4k would have a lot and I mean a lot of the miners shutting down. That would have a really bad domino effect
Bitconeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeect
Haha, thanks man. Btw yes I have all your coins now.
Yea I'd say so. I'm just extrapolating from the so far repeating pattern we've seen. A relatively large spike, followed by a gradual increase and another spike and so on. I think the price will go as low as 5-6k in the next few months but in maybe 2 or 3 years, the pattern will repeat but at a much higher price. 
This is pure speculation but just look at the price from inception to now. Its not a perfect pattern but it isn't just random. 
8200 looked so massive, didn't think we'd break that. And then came Korea.
New York woke up
Dude, with the number of idiots that have over-invested in Crypto and virtually zero regulation to protect the average man whether it be trading based or media based manipulation it is literally of no surprise... Like taking candy off a baby. 
Good theory to be fair. 
I literally don't understand why this guy is not on the phone with the top 10 most wealthy crypto holders saying Let's Make a Deal? I mean if I had thousands of coins the first thing I would do is call the Winklevoss twins and after that I would just go down the list. Even if I give them 10 points off spot it's more than I'm going to get when I drive the market down taking a dump truck to an exchange. 
yeah that guy specifically was so full of shit lol
Yeah, that means few people were buying and nobody hardly selling. It’s not good.
Me too, I guess it's all just depends on what the market wants to do.
Under 10,000 on GDAX.
> if they sell and don't buy back in lower.

  That's the big problem. Many are selling , in hope of buying back lower. 
Never thought of a lambo. People that make money here in crypto that immediately goes out and order a Lambo are all morons. I am speaking of a couple hundred thousands just so we are free to pursue our true passion in life. But judging by bitcoin's price action it ain't gonna happen anytime soon.
dont aree with that at all. 
Maybe more hodl shirts?
Story of my life.  The things I get super hyped for seem to have next to no impact on the market prices.  Meanwhile if John McAfee sneezes, or South Korea does just about anything.... hang on to your hat.
the fact that 99% of traders are looking at the same charts , perhaps 
I've been shorting Bitcoin for the last week. Why so sensitive? Are you scared of a potential price drop?
Roger that short man... go short some alternatives please. Thank yewwww
Your point is what exactly? That I should have started shorting before receiving confirmation of trend reversal?
I don't fucking know. I'm just trying to find a silver lining.
*drums*  very small *drums*
Traders trade every crypto worth trading. Trading only Bitcoin is a risky move, since it positions the trader in a single liquidity-limited market.

It is preferable to distribute the investment over different crypto markets with the highest volume, in order to avoid a big slippage, if an emergency market sale is required.

Well if you're playing with millions of dollars as part of a organised cabal to manipulate prices it's likely the people actually managing the funds are employed by the whales. Those people would be very good at what they do and would be on it very much full time. It's kind of difficult to make mistakes when you both know what your doing and can dictate the price in the first place. 
the fact that you are guaranteeing wealth in your post makes it untrue. you can't promise that, that's insane. my opinion shouldn't affect bitcoin, so that's good it, way to point that out. so you are waiting a whole two years to get rich? wow, what conviction. what an investor. you are dellusional, at best. lol. people like you are the reason I read this sub, do you realize that????
I think the best option for any Venezuelan is simply to emigrate to another country. I have friends who simply left with their families. The regime will eventually collapse and then, they may think in returning.
It's only considered *broken* if an hourly candle closes above it.
Ask him :)
You could earn that and more if you actually work at McDonalds.
No u
They make money by setting Bull traps and taking the money from newbie investors, who get their buttons triggered by FOMO and then, when the market suddenly crash, they panic and immediately sell... because well, they are noobs...

This is one of the things that cryptos brought into this world. Noobs who think they can become professional traders by just watching some YouTube videos... The trading world is immensely complex and there are traders who are pure genius people, with PhDs in statistics and financial trading. 

> Also, the deflationary nature of the coins would encourage HODLING

Not really. That is a fallacy. Professional traders can still profit by doing what they do, which is trading. Professional traders have no intention to hold on for their dear life, because their main concern is risk-management and portfolio valorization. 

HODLING in the long term is for the casual investor, which does not want to be concern about the mundane issues of portfolio management. 

>  this will eventually lead to extreme scarcity once weak hands and gamblers are shaken out by the manipulation of whales

Also, not true. You assume that with scarcity, everyone will want to immediately jump-in. But such thinking only applies if there's actually a need to buy Bitcoins. For example, retailers are already adopting other cryptos, such as Ethereum and Litecoin. So that scarcity which you are referring to, doesn't actually applies unless there's a real demand to use Bitcoins, which currently there's not. 

When the price goes up exponentially, the amount of money which is required enter the market, in order to maintain the pace is also exponential. This increases uncertainty and fear of another crash.
Also, when the price goes up, it becomes more and more difficult to get a profit, equally large to the profit which early-adopters got, the 1000% ratio profit. This is a hype-killer.

That is why when someone brings those 2013 charts and states "Bitcoin will recover like it did before, when going from $100 to $1K... I honestly don't believe it". This kind of behaviour only happens once. If it gets repetitive, professionals get on board and suck the value out.

So no, whalers will always make money, even if the market is crashing.

Bulls make money,

Bears make money,

Pigs get slaughtered.

>  And then HODLERS dine on the Moon...

You don't know that. They can also dine in Hell... 


**EDIT**: Oh! There's also one thing called USDT and unregulated markets, which may well be manipulating everything from the start. Those *"whalers"*could simply be traders connected to these exchanges, with access to inside-information. **The house always wins**.
When the pump from 6,8K to 8,2K happen on Bitfinex, more than 42K of bitcoin were transacted. While what you say is perfectly possible, data sugests that even if 12K BTC is taken out, that doesn't mean that there isn't another 100K ready to be sold. In my opinion, there's a lot of bitcoin out there, in the markets to be sold.

With the rise of other altcoins and their popularity, things are about to get pretty interesting.
Bitocnnect is down more than 40,000% since ATH. Don't ask why or about it's history, but quick! go buy now! you will be the richest man evar in the near future! 'cause hey hey heeeeeeeeeeyyyy!!

Disclaimer : This post is not guaranteed to earn you money and you may lose money.
If the market sentiment is down past the wall, we usually run sideways before breaking through it.  Everyone buying near the wall eventually sells into it.  Be careful.  IMO if it really was our bottom we would already be in an uptrend past 9k.
Then the answer is yes. I don't think it would matter below 1k. But many people moving around 5-10k yeah, depends on the market as everything. 
That pressure will ease off eventually. At some stage, the buy and sell pressure will reach equilibrium.
...what is your true passion in life?  If it is your true passion, you are free to seek it...why haven't you, whats holding you back?  how much time do you spend doing fuck all?
Another useless rent seeker.
More bitcoin clothing and sticker companies for sure. 
Sold my stack at 9k and have been buying back since.  The lower the better.  No margin trading for me though.
Yeap
YES!  Finally...  an IDFK 
Lol
Fair enough :)
Sure
That employee discount adds up man
No you both
Thank you for such a quality reply. Really appreciate the time and effort. And after reading your reasoning I do agree with the whole difference in scope, both financially and in knowledge and sheer genius of the really good professional traders. Me personally? I'm one of the casual guys just HODLing along, supporting this drive for decentralised consensus to really take off as I believe (given what limited knowledge I do have) in this tech. You have my upvote!
Great post.
thank you.
I want to see Bitcoin find support at 7,900 or finish the day above the 50 day exponential moving average before I go medium-term long again. Can only trade with the wind, not against it.
In that case I hope you're good at catching knives.

Remember, the most important is the way you sleep at night. If Bitcoin is taking your sleep, then you are way too exposed.

Don't let greed FOMO you into reckless positions. There will be many opportunities to invest wisely along the way.
That's true but mentioning of moving averages you know the longer we go sideways the easier it is to get on the right side of the 200sma. You run into it by default
