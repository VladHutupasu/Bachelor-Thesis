Daily Discussion, May 11, 2018 -- TITLE
Mods post these daily threads so that you guys have a place to banter about daily stuff. It's unfortunate that the only discussion that occurs in these threads is related to price obsession. We have TWO sticky spots. If mods want to sticky something that's actually **informative** or educational, we're going to do that. Because if we don't, then really good content gets lost in all the noise of people obsessing about price every single day.

If a day comes along and there's no daily thread because there's something else stickied, or the bot crashes, or whatever... it's not the end of the world. It's not an excuse to throw a temper tantrum. It doesn't mean that mods are involved in a price manipulation conspiracy, or that mods are trying to suppress bad news. You guys can stop acting like spoiled kids and start acting like adults. If you're really that obsessed about price, please log off, and go for a nice walk outdoors to get some fresh air and clear your head.

e: Previous (excellent) sticky that we had to take down because too many spoiled kiddos were threatening to hold their breath until they turned blue. https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8i60k5/a_simplified_lecture_on_how_script_works_1_hour_5/
It‚Äôs so interesting that we‚Äôve had so much good news over the past week and the markets hardly responded. We get some FUD re upbit it crashes as if Bitcoin itself were hacked.
Lots of shorts placed after going underneath 8900. Each drop has been followed by a slight rise, but coincides with buying from shorts being closed. I'm not sure if there's any real buying pressure at the moment.
The orchestra on deck sounds rather nice.  There's a little seawater lapping around my plimsolls, but all will be ok..

:)

p.s.  Much respected mods: BTC is under continued and sustained attack.  Its price is a measure of its resilience.

It is hard not to discuss price here.

But I will cease posting if you wish.  You have a reasonable point.

*E: added p.s.*
Some Payday Friday this is turning out to be ...
Man, am I ever happy I sold when I did. It's not often that you feel good about a major investment decision, but selling just before this dip makes me a happy dude. 

Keep at it, guys. I had to sell my Bitcoin because I am broke, but I firmly would have continued hodling if I was in a better financial position. Best of luck everyone, it's been a hell of a year. I may not be a hodler anymore, but I'll always be loyal to the Bitcoin community. 
lost my whole bank account gg

:(
Q: bitcoin dumping?, whyy????
A: because there are more sellers than buyers.

that simple.
Eh?

It's a conspiracy you know!!!

The mods took the money and put Roger and that weird skinny kid with a vegan aversion to salad in charge of our fun and nonsense  :)

Where can i get a nice bitcoin hoodie? bonus points if i can buy it with bitcoin.
So i'm creating a new segwit wallet and i thought they started with a "3" but this new one starts with "bc1" what does this mean? why the change?
Morning.

I woke up, looked at the price and thought, shit.

But then:

Good for Bitcoin :)
Daily Discussion 12th May is up now.....

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8iuvsh/daily_discussion_may_12_2018/
im a afrid of tonight 
This is good for bitcoin
Its anyones game today, curious how this weekend will look. Been talking to some buddies about the dip telling them to buy in if they can afford it. Its payday but all my fiat went to bills üòë
Well, at least the attendees of "Consensus 2018" will find a nice entry price, if they want to fomo in.
Everyone abandon ship! bill gates and warren buffet are shorting! run for the hills! The winkle voss twins challenged gates and he brought in buffet to help!! buy back around 1k.
I've heard this like 5x already, got some sauce papi?
I have very simple tactic:

1. Holding my current coins in case this is the bottom
2. Having ready 500$ in cash to buy more on monday if it dips further
3. Going all in and buying 1 BTC if it falls near 6k after that
the daily thread creator was frustrated the whole day. i understand it. 
everything is fine
Best time to buy is right now 
Good thing I sold at $9800 
The price is irrelevant if you believe in the future of Bitcoin. Who cares if the price drops a little bit if you know it will be millions in 2020?
Anyone else fondly remembering the good old days of daily gains and when you could turn a tidy profit off of manual arbitrage (congested mempool has it's benefits). 
S.O.S.   

Enough happy talk about bitcoin from certain bull whales in the media. If you have cash on the sidelines, time to pony it up and help out the fish here.  Losing 9k and now 8.5k is just sad after all the gains we made the past few weeks.  We almost topped 10k a week ago. Let‚Äôs go bulls. This is getting depressing.  
I‚Äôm getting pretty excited for this turnaround. I think it will be quite dramatic when it happens. 
[deleted]
Almost an hour since the last block - this is disgraceful
Please define the word ‚Äústicky‚Äù for those of us new to the internet age or over 40 years of age. 
rough day, huh 
You only lose BTC by selling.

Ergo..

Don't :)

It is that simple.

Maintain the cause of a truly decentralised and democtratised means of payment and exchange.

(And if you REALLY want to buy a fucking coffee with it - as Ver pretends to: to save all the babies needing to buy a 10 USD coffee in Tokyo with his shitcoin, wait for Lightning.)
looks like we found a price that buyers can afford.
Waiting for fiat to make way to exchange. Keep dropping..

Volume is good.

If anyone is interested, I posted my very first idea to tradingview. I see a cup and handle forming with bitcoin.

Absolutely.  No temper tantrums here.

But do you know what happens in British submarines if they can't receive Radio 4?

Yep.  

:)
Well spoken my mod, well spoken indeed. 
I get what you're saying, but if 90% of the people want to talk about price, why discourage it just because *you* don't think that's what they should focus on? I understand your'e a mod so that's your prerogative, but obviously if price dominates discussion that is what is most important to people. 
I get lots of good info on the daily unrelated to price. There will always be FUDsters. After awhile they don‚Äôt affect you (or shouldn‚Äôt).
I feel like the daily threads are a conversation and I miss the community when they are hard to find / nonexistant. Maybe a sidebar link that makes it easy to find? Idk there has to be an adequate compromise here.
Seriously, more reality checks the better. Bravo! 
These daily posts are made to talk about daily stuff, like price and sentiment, or things affecting Bitcoin like daily news. Informative or educational things aren't daily based, so I suggest you look somewhere else if you don't like to discuss daily stuff.
The thing people don't seem to understand is just how much manipulation there is in this market. Like, all the time. It's the big boys game and they make the rules.
still under a bear market, the same god could say that bitcoin is the future and still bitcoin will dump-
We are in a bear market not just in cryptos but stock.  Investors are just not in the mood.

Last month was an all time record in company earnings but the stock market has hardly moved.
We're under continuous and sustained attack here, batten down the hatches and prepare for capsizing. 
Idk, I made about 1000 satoshis daytrading down the dip. 
best of luck to you. Hope you made some profit and were not forced to sell at a loss now.
"I had to sell my Bitcoin because I was broke" 

So you don't see Bitcoin as money?
You might kick your own arse down the street if you have left the space and can't buy back in :)
The mt gox trustee dumped 8000 bitcoin on the market crashing it. 
[removed]
sadly people blame news for the dump. its actually the other way around. news gets created after the movement . think 
yup, everyone wants their daily 1% to pay for their lunchables and go-gurt.
Maybe because the winklevos twins challenged bill gates to short bitcoin :\) never challenge one of the richest men in the world. You never know. 
Loss of trust in the market due to shitcoins.

And quite right too.

Who the hell was pumping and buying Bitcoin Diamond, and that is just an example.

The interest and resources will ALWAYS fold back into proper projects - but this will take some time.
I read a post saying it was most likely dropping due to the South Korean exchange raid.  I am a bit confused why that would cause a drop though.  I mean, if they discovered that the exchange was not really holding real coins, then if I was an investor there and had funds to pull from, I would absolutely be finding another exchange to get some real coins on.  So it should raise price due to demand for "real" Bitcoin.   
bc1 addresses are native segwit addresses.

The 3... addresses are segwit wrapped in a P2SH (pay to script hash) address.  They are backwards compatible with clients that don't support segwit. They were intended to be transitional while everyone moves to using segwit.  Services that haven't been updated to process segwit addresses properly could have trouble with the bc1 addresses.  Many (most?) services have updated already.

I‚Äôll hodl u if u hodl me?
Loool. Just tether boy.
Agreed.
Tiger is losing at tpc. pretty sure that's bad for bitcoin.
I'm not sure if asking friends and families to buy into a speculative asset is a good idea.
People I know saw the price fall, and asked how to buy in straight away.  

Techy people: fascinated with LN and who want to get involved.  Even with just a hundred dollars.
Ver is not speaking there you know..

Something to do with .. IDK .. strange, because Coinbase are his BTrash pumping mates.

Some say it is to do with not being able to get a visa..
Source?
/s
Or maybe after we finish our free\-fall back to $6,000.
Now idk if I should buy back in or wait more 
nobody knows if it will be millions in 2020 for 1 bitcoin or 10 dollars

10 dollars is closer fyi
No.
Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose. 
Be patient young padawan. 
Er.  Hmmmm.  Er...

Maybe...   Oh... Er..  Yep.

Your lack of understanding of the network is disgraceful. So when a three blocks are mine within minutes, do you poop your Pampers over that too? 
It just means it will stay at the top of the page, without being moved.  

Because it is an important post.

All fair enough.
I‚Äôm losing BTC because ONT is going down with it. Bought at 0.000866
What does this even mean? Why would anyone not be able to afford Bitcoin at the higher price, they would just buy a smaller fraction. 
You mean 'can accept' rather than 'can afford'.
BTC does not use zero confirmation like Btrash (in other words - 'we **think** you have received the funds')
It was probably a delay inside Coinbase.  They often have random delays before broadcasting a transaction on the network.  While you were waiting, you could've looked up the destination address on a block explorer, to see if the transaction was there and not confirmed yet, or if there was no transaction yet.

Selling volume?
Not as good as a cold beer.
Go away dude you‚Äôre already invalidated. Over 10k on bithumb and hit 10001 on binance. You‚Äôre wrong. 

You were nowhere during the rally and now you‚Äôre back spewing your bs. 
eww can you please switch to log
Let's not get into conspiracy theories, because you can probably tell by my name that I am rather biased.

But I blame Ver and Bcash for a lot of this.

I honestly believe that until that nasty, lying shitcoin is dead, the cryptoworld will suffer.

It has confused the market, and made the entire space appear dishonest.

I hope I am wrong.
Bitcoin has only fallen 7-8%. BTrash is dumping hard, 12-13%. This is a net positive.
Thanks, interesting.

Personally, I don't think TA works for cryptos because of the widespread price manipulation.  But that's just my opinion.
cool, your analysis, plus a guy said this week on r / bitcoin; "May 13 will be a great day of purchase" and "any bitcoin purchased under 10k will be a bargain", I will go to sleep on those thoughts.
‚ÄúCup and handle‚Äù - so funny. You will ‚Äúcup and handle‚Äù yourself all the way to the poorhouse. All that gibberish is there just to take away your hard earned money. The only sensible thing to do is HODL and DCA
It confirms it again and again and again.

not all coins mirror the exact moves BTC  \(else all charts would look the same\) .

but BTC always gives the direction with strong moves. If BTC goes up fast all Alts go up, if BTC goes down fast all\(95&#37;\) alts go down. That is no new thing. That happens at least since 2013.

* BTC sideways action= alts do their own thing.
* BTC strong uptrend =all alt go up
* BTC strong downtrend = all alts go down

and that is no believe that is just fact. You can that track back like forever.
[removed]
I'm not sure if that's a good sign.

We need people to believe in investing in cryptos, preferably BTC.  

If you think anyone who got burnt dealing with alts will come to BTC, think again.  They will just leave the crypto scene altogether.


Is he *your* mod?  Does he do your gardening too?

I touch my cap to you, my good Sir.  Brackets: indeed. 

I hope the young maid was to your liking sir (etcetera.)


There‚Äôs /r/BitcoinMarkets, but I suspect a lot of the people participating regularly in this thread would be run out due to their immaturity. I understand that price volatility can be very exciting, but it‚Äôs also one of the most boring things about Bitcoin. If you‚Äôre just here to try and pump the price, you‚Äôre doing it wrong. Share great articles and videos and encourage others to do the same. Experiment. *Learn something new.*

I realize that some people just want to make a quick buck, and they‚Äôre among the people these threads are intended for. But my point is that if mods want to sticky something that‚Äôs actually worthwhile, they‚Äôre going to do it, and they‚Äôre not going to put up with whiners who have to scroll down to find a recent daily thread. 
Daily thread was the alternative to Banning price posts. These threads are garbage dumps not content.
wasn't the whole deal about cryptocurrency to get rid of the big boys? 

now the nyse is going to kill all the exchanges worldwide, so it's again in the hand of the big boys

gg guys, FAIL. 
I doubt it.  

This is warship BTC versus brigand BCash and Slender Man.
Made lots of profit. I was a relatively early buyer. Still, with a sold around January though 
Not as money that I can spend anywhere. I get that someday that might happen with Bitcoin but you can't use it to do your day to day shipping yet 
Yup, I fully expect that to happen. I may buy a little back if it drops some more, and ride it back up 
>I had to sell my Bitcoin because I am broke, but I firmly would have continued hodling if I was in a better financial position

Sometimes there are not endless other options left. and if he can't buy back in later maybe that will also have reasons.

"Hey buddy remember later that I told you so. You wasted your BTC to buy food and stuff. HODL!! "

and yes you should normally only invest what you can afford to lose but he clearly wrote here that he needs the money.
so a lousy 8000 bitcoins control this market? 

what a joke it is then
mtgox, SK hack, S&P, whatever.

But buyers aren't interested and the money needed to keep the price at this current price is gone.
Why
Lol redditor for 4 weeks, did you forget where you‚Äôre posting? This is about as speculative as it can get. Never said family, and never said i was asking them to to make a decision they weren‚Äôt sure of. These people are already invested and don‚Äôt watch the markets as closely as people on this sub do. 

Thanks for your concern though, take it easy. 
Nile?
I hope. I like when BTC has their summer sales. 
Sad part is, by the time you make up your mind, it'll be already above 9700.
If you are too weak to hold bitcoin you can get out now. Trust in the Prophet McAfee.

It is the latest shitcoin: Volume (VLM.)  

It is a token to represent volume.

21 million trillion cap.  20 million trillion pre-mined.

Each token represents one cubic metre.

Buy VLM and you have physical space secured on the blockchain.

I bought 27 to store my shit when my gf threw me out for making us both bankrupt.
I am a believer in bitcoin in the long term. But like anything else it follows market patterns. My TA is not a reccomendation to buy or sell, I don't even do any short term trades on bitcoin myself. I have been adding to my stack every time the price drops. Just sharing my analysis of what's going on with the price. 
(Here's an interesting observation: that post of mine above has had neutral votes.  I either get massive upvotes, or downvotes when I have been twatty.  So, conclusion - there are a lot of Bitcoiners here gambling with shitcoins.  I rest my case m'lud.)
**No no no.**  Out of my window here in sunny XXXX I can see a betting office.  Idiots go in and out all day.

They come out looking miserable.

None of them are thoughtful - they got burnt.

The cryptospace doesn't need chancers like that who haven't done the research and get burnt, that is Ver's vision - but it is short term.
And you should. If "those people" leave "because of that" then this subreddit isn't any worse off.
Yeah. I don't know how we're gonna get there, but until the masses use crypto regularly and represent a larger piece of the pie, I don't see how this could work.
Aye captain but she's taking on water, FUD, and the main rudder is shot
Understood.  It is easy to be insensitive.

But if means are that short - why get involved in risky investments?
again. the "market movers" loaded up on shorts and then created FUD news. yes. they are that powerful belive it or not
Everything is good for Bitcoin :)
Aye, the Gospel of McAfee fortold all of this, and the prophecy of the uneaten dick will be realised. Protect the dickline at all costs!
Jabberwocky
Funny.  I see the same group here in BTC.
Steer by engines!!!  Full ahead starboard engine, stop port engine.

We'll turn this dildo upwards men!

(..and women..)
Aspiration? 
Because people
So sayeth the Lord. Amen!
Yes.  I noticed that.
Is this some kind of snowflake SJW board now?  

(Only kidding.  But looking at your previous posts, with more frequent references to yourself than to outside events, and concerns about the weather - you are female.  So you are not a snowflake or SJW, you are simply a woman, which is broadly similar.  :)
Hahaha... spread the love... have a great day :)
Upvoted for tolerance.  

With love
