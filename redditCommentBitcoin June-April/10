Daily Discussion, May 24, 2018 -- TITLE
We need to think hard about this ...
I’m not buying a lambo no matter how high price goes. I’m setting up for the long game.
I’ve written a detailed family manifesto for generations of my descendants to follow. The first few generations will simply hodl and accumulate.
Starting in 2500, they’ll start buying the planets. Mars first, then working outwards. They’ll rent out the celestial bodies while also selling the natural resources from them.
Eventually, by approx. 2900 my family will have enough Bitcoin to purchase Earth, the birthplace of all humanity, forever cementing my legacy as the greatest hodler of all time.
Snagged me another coin. Thanks for the pullback guys.
Where the hell is the bottom

* [U.S. Launches Criminal Probe into Bitcoin Price Manipulation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8lr35x/us_launches_criminal_probe_into_bitcoin_price/)
This one time... bitcoin went from 85 cents all the way to $29... and then it CRASHED all the way to $3
US investigation of manipulation is awesome news. I hope they weed out the bad apples and on we go from there
Everyone always posting about how it’s “good” we’re dropping so that we can buy..

Okay but at one point we need to skyrocket so we can actually see gains.. 

Let’s not sugarcoat it, it’s not looking good.
Am I missing something!?  I would have thought that the investigations into possible dodgy practices on exchanges is a positive piece of news.
Price Control is the name of the game. Fundamentals haven't changed. In a World of Oath Breakers and Deceivers, Bitcoin remains the trustless alternative.
Justice Department is looking into bitcoin price manipulation... This might actually be a good thing for us HODLERS. I have a feeling there are a good number of wall street people out there who have been manipulating price to the downside for various reasons. Their time shall come to an end. Lets look forward to FOMO and LAMBO times and party like its 1999.
Bitcoin is quite oversold right now.

RSI is almost at 30. Every time it has been below 30 it had a massive bounce back up.

It will probably be the same again but with a higher bottom. Last time Bitcoin hit 30 was in the mid 6k range.

What I hope is that the bounce up passes 10k.

Come on bulls! This is your chance to break out of the downtrend.
Bottom is in! Now, that wasn't so bad, was it?
Manipulators are being investigated, so manipulators AKA whales are dumping and exiting BTC, hence the recent steep drop in price. That leads to lower, more stable prices, enticing big money to join the party and creating more trust in the future of BTC. Incoming mass adoption and moon. Buckle in, boys. Rocket is leaving soon. 

This may seem bad short term, but this is just what we needed. This is progress!
Time for some serious discussion:

When moon / lambo?
Lambos gonna have to wait
This is a range where many major long-term trendlines collide. Doesn't matter if you believe in TA, it only matters how many others do.  
Well, at least there's some volume :p
Overall, do you think the rise to $20k last December was a good thing or bad thing for crypto?  On the positive side, it certainly brought a lot of attention to the space and also no doubt encouraged a lot of development.  Obviously it had it's negatives and currently people that bought near that level are down on their investment.  What do you think?

2.07mins to 2.53mins  :) 
well...at least we got volume back amrite bois?
Good time to buy in?
i think this market will recover knowing how it perform in the market
Let’s see if the TA’s are right, pump to 7500-7800 then dump 5k-6k. Bastards! 
As of this moment...

#1 BTC = Z$2,721,042.40

Yes, you saw that right, it's $2,721,042.

The only manipulation was the whales forcing the price up.

Now the manipulation is being investigated the price will be corrected down to 4xxx
Ok everyone, take a deep breath and hodl it, we will be diving to 6k shortly.
20k by end of july 
Isded ?
Well D.I.P. Bitcoin

Let this be the real bottom
We need to think on this.
Under 30 RSI.  Thanks for the quick FUD 
Wtf is this trash
Lada Samara now or Lambo later?
I don’t even do TA but this looks like a triple bottom. This may be a good thing.

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/triplebottom.asp
Ahhh that pure green spike into my vein. That’s my drug of choice. 
rekt
Time to buy in on the discount and HODL for my life. 
if it breaks 6.8k, we're going down boys. keep an eye for an excellent time to buy.
I have no idea where we are going

Yeah...can't wait till them Japanese start trading that stock cone man..bitcone..bitcone..BITCOONE..TO DA MOOON!
Bitcoin still broke through the resistance level and jostled below 8,000. How to behave? As always in such situations: shove emotions in the ass \(deep\) and judge soberly.

We answer the questions:

\- Is there a fundamental reason for a strong fall?

No. Not a single tangible strike on bitcoin was not enough, just look into the news. The rate falls, but not because of objective external causes, the fall is speculative \- the market is replaced by weak hands. In addition, in late spring and many traders are recording profit, which affects the market.

 \- Are there any prospects?

Yes, I said about them more than once: institutional investors and the solution of regulatory issues are already closed.

In the end: if your goals are long\-term, then such moments as now, you need to catch. Buy better in stages \- part of the purchase now, and part of the strong resistance level 7000\-7200.

It's not the one who saddles the wave on the trend \(then everyone would be millionaires\), but the one who does not panic and buys at the bottoms. Therefore, there are so few people who are really rich \- they are patient, weighed, and take unpopular decisions without looking at the mood of the crowd. The mood of the crowd now is to come out. The mood turned \- to buy. Decide on whose side you are.
Anyone else got banned from Twitter?? 
Ok so lets say you have 15k-20k USD burning a hole in your pocket with the end goal of having coins and contributing to the btc ecosystem. Do you buy and hodl or do you buy mining equipment/invest in infrastructure (btc atm or asic)? Give me your opinions.
Asking for a friend ;)
think we end the day @6800. we are bleeding to death.
Oddly, I've had an usually large amount of friends/family ask me how to invest in crypto during the bear market more than during the bull run because "now it's more affordable".  I wasn't expecting that to happen since it seems attention usually dwindles with price.  How anomalous..
OK you sons of guns, I bought the dip!  I still think it's going to test 6000, maybe more.  Perhaps not this plunge, but at some point.  I think we're at least 12 months away from the Next BIG Leg Up.  If we see a global economic contraction at any point during that 12 months, then all bets are off, we could be holding multi\-year.  But that's why it's called investing, not gambling. \(though it's really all gambling, even investing, hahaha\)
You cant stop the selling :D
[Almost no sell walls](https://imgur.com/a/5vbZOT0)
The moon is 15k away
Oh shit! What about the times I cancelled my buy orders what if they think I was madildoing?
Yeayyy A pump!! 
Hi everyone! I have a question! It's pretty dumb! 

I have held my bitcoin for a while, over a year or so. It's always been an amount that I could afford to lose, but right now I'm thinking of buying something for myself, and would like to cash out some of my bitcoin. Here's my question: 

If I take out an even number, let's say $1000, and I am in the tax bracket that pays 15% on capital gains, do I simple owe $150 at tax time? I don't know how much the $1000 initially cost, because I bought roughly $30~ week for a long time. Some of it was when it was at $2000 a coin, and some was when it was $19000 a coin! Is my question simple or complex? Thank you!
I used to use quickBT as my premier exchange in Canada, but they recently stopped support with my bank. Short of drastic measures, are there any other sites like that, where I can just do fast transfers with minimal hoops and a slightly higher service fee?
Does anyone make or know anyone who creates logos and accepts bitcoin as payment? Sorry if this isn’t the place for this sort of question
I am a happier person when I do not come here.
Oh Bitcoin you pain me so. Why do you refuse to sustain any kind of rally 
bitcoin is like real life shitting at the moment. just do nothing all day then take a massive dump.
6500 before the weekend end. 5000 by next week. 
Rocket fuel!🚀
6k here we come 
Perfect buy opportunity. Last chance to grab some coins under $7500.
It won't go below 7k 
We’re green for go 
I think we're going back up to 9k resistance, then drop back down for an 8k support, then a re-test of 10k about a month from now. 20k in September. imo ofc :)
Do not fear people. We gonna see 10k sooner or later. 
If Bitcoin were to replace the $dollar, 
does that mean that the price of Bitcoin would equal infinity dollars or zero dollars?
BTC is bullshit , but still i can make money whit it 
Either way...we going to hit 5000 or lower soon
This is big money scaring the pussies away. Regulation is good it will help to stifle a little bit of the manipulation going on.
What do you think will be the highest price for the rest of the year?
I’m comfortable. 
BILL GATES WAS RIGHT
PONZI SCHEME IS OVER NOW
SELL SELL SELL
ABANDON SHIP!!!!


Lets be real guys, straight up. It's only going downhill from now or the price will stay stable at 7k/8k. 

Tom Lee's reputation is about to go down the toilet.

Bitcore just hit 3,70 usd
[removed]
You’d have to have at least 4 bitcoins to do all of that.
The fact that you think Bitcoin won't hit infinity dollars within the hour shows that you know nothing about making money with Bitcoin.
Ha, nice!
Seems located at 7k this time
That’s $1 above everyones buy order.
Long overdue.

Let's hope we get some sanity moving forward.
*fumbles cherrypit in mouth*
3/29 = 0.10344827586

So what you're saying is it could go as low as $2068.97?
...wasn't the biggest selling point of Bitcoin was that it was out of the government's jurisdiction? And now you're thanking the government for swooping in and protecting you?

Interesting.
They can't regulate the world, so I'm not sure what people expect to come from this. Perhaps they scrutinize US-based platforms, but those aren't the biggest exchanges. 
With trump and co, I wouldn't hold your breath
It goes up and down, by a lot.  That’s what it does.  Sell a little when it’s up, buy a little when it’s down.
You can make loads shorting 
patience man, you'll have your lambo by 2020. you didnt actually thing you were going to get rich quick did you?
I’m also confused by the notion. As crypto enthusiasts would be thrilled to know that “whales” aren’t simply dumping for profit.  
Manipulation goes both ways and if whales get scared off they'll just sell and get out.
For the long term, yes.

In the meantime, it's a well known fact that BTC's price is artificially sustained by price manipulation.  Remove this and the price will likely crumple.  Don't know to what extent.
I think in the long term this can only be good news.  
Doubt this will change a whole lot.
Yeah there's no way price manipulation could have been responsible for Bitcoin going near vertical last year. There's no way the true price could be $1000.
Right now we are confirming resistance at the top of the downtrend channel.
it is time to buy and hold it for a while
Jokes on you, this bottom reversal is a huge bulltrap
Isn't this similar to shaking out the weak? Those who prefer to ride off the shirttails of the serious contributors in the investment both current and future? Those who whine over the price drop, have no understanding of risk factor yet want huge daily profits? Those are the ones who discourage future development and cause decay, just like in the equities markets. Yup, the ones who laughed @ me when I bought 1000's of Starbucks @ the split adjusted price in 2008 for $8.76/sh.... yeah, that look.. the look of "why didn't they listen", I'm still smiling, and hodling the BTC

Show me your trendlines. 
Bad. It encouraged speculators and investors who are really turning Bitcoin into a security rather than a currency. This has caused a lot of the blockchain related businesses and innovation to focus on catering to them and that market, rather than help improve usability as a currency for people who want to use it to buy their groceries.

Meanwhile adoption as a currency has flatlined. There's hardly been any progress in any usable businesses for the general public to start using Bitcoin to purchase everyday items. How many of your local stores that you use regularly have started accepting Bitcoin? For most people in the world, the answer is still 0. And that's where the focus should have been, building usability so it can become a currency you can use to buy your every day items. From groceries to gas.
We need high volume and the price going up.
What forever to buy in and you .. wait forever :)
It's a the bottom trendline so I would buy now and stop loss at 6800.
You can tell it's the market because of the way it is. 
I market perform ways in it because it is things make happen 
Well, different TAs say different things...
lol same opinion here 
There's still about 400 million tethers that can be used for the pump. They ll probably be used for several pumps on the way down. 
What is Z?
The exodus of the manipulators will start and the dumping will follow.
I want what you are smoking. 
I think if bitcoin with that value , bitcoin team will emerge eventually
which year???

because 20k by 2019 if fine for me.
Wake me up when we finish the dumpage that's been going on for the past 6 months.
maybe it was in a dump, but I am pretty sure that it will bounce back
Lol
Doubt so :).  

Yeap, I'm making a killing :P
You sold?
Or the end of a corrective horizontal triangle. Which is essentially the same thing...

http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:market_analysis:identifying_elliott_wave_patterns#horizontal_triangles
Definitely it is the best we can do right now with this bearish market, buy the dip and wait for the moon and REPEAT!
Up
after this issue of price manipulation i think it will recover if they found out that it was only few people and I hope they may found the culprit of this anomaly
[deleted]
just try gdax.com (rebranded in Coinbase pro definitely soon). It's the same company with a "Single sign on" so no need to create a new account.

you can import your coinbase funds in a matter of seconds without fees and send them back whenever you want if you want to cash out and send money back to your bank account

Just set a Limit POST ONLY order and you'll have no fees.
Gemini

Ban this tool please
where do you get that from... just F.U.D look at the Mt Gox cold wallet link i posted below!
>Bitcoin still broke through the resistance level and jostled below 8,000

I feel like whenever people through out random "resistance" levels it's just code for "that was my stoploss, please wait for it to go lower so I can buy in."
> the fall is speculative

The rise was speculative... This is the correction...
Didn't you see what the mod posted below?

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/bitcoin-manipulation-is-said-to-be-focus-of-u-s-criminal-probe
Nonsense. You have no idea if the winners planned it or got lucky or manipulated weaknesses to get results. 

Stop making shit up.  
I'm sure lots of people have been banned from Twitter.
Did this only occur recently?  A month or so ago when GDAX was acting funky, I made a Twitter account for the first time ever.  I posted on GDAX's official Twitter, informing them that the service was down for some users. (On the status page, it said they'd fixed the problem, but it was still down for some users.)

The tweet wasn't angry or anything, just informing them of the problem.  I also replied to my own post, and attached a screenshot to show them the error code.  About 20 minutes later I added additional information that the login page was working fine, but when it transferred you to the trade window is when the problem occurred.  That was it.  Three, calm tweets that contained only information to attempt to help their dev team fix the problem.  Seconds after the third tweet, I was banned from Twitter for "suspicious activity".  The account recovery system was asking me for my personal cell number in order to "verify my identity" which I refused to do.  (Even Facebook still does not have my number.)

I made a ticket explaining that I shouldn't have to give them my cell number for being erroneously flagged as malicious because the fault was not mine, it was a faulty detection algorithm.  This ticket was marked as solved but I was not unbanned.  I made a second ticket.  This time, they apologized and unbanned me.  Regardless, I'll not be using Twitter ever again if their "naughty behavior" detection is THAT sensitive and paranoid.
For talking crypto?
I think everyone! I was banned for commenting on a crypto related account. I started another account, blocked again, and a third blocked again.... Its insane 

Buy and HODL, but Dollar cost average in over a month or longer.
From my experience mining is good but it does require alot of your time. Because I didnt know anything about mining so I was always checking the equipment. And one day I got a flashing red light didnt know what it meant. So I had a bitcoin shop in Colorado fix it and I sold my antminer s9 for the same price I bought it for. And just invetsed the money from that into btc. My thing was mining btc you are paying about 350 a month in electricity, so I just invest 350 a month in btc. But if you have the time and the room for the equiptment mine. But let me tell you those antminers are loud.
What does HODL mean? Hold on don’t —?
it's profitable to mine in Washington state.
So tru.... A friend of mine who hated BTC, and I mean hated the idea, asked me how he could buy a coin the other day.... lol..... no kidding..... he used to troll people who bought at $17,000.00
sell and buy walls are useless . they are only there to create a false information. one day maybe you will see.
hA.HA. that's too far
> I was madildoing

Please explain in graphic detail what this word means.
If you did all your buying on an exchange,  you should be able to get a history of those buy transactions.  The IRS will expect you to do this,  and if you can't,  they expect to to hire someone who can.

You may have a legitimate excuse as to why the transaction history is not available,  i.e.  Exchange exit scam.

The best thing to do in that case is make an honest guess,   document it, and file that along side your tax return when you are done.





If you bought it through one exchange you can get the entire transaction log, put it in a spreadsheet, and get the exact answer.  As you’ve crossed multiple years, you may have to file amendments on previous years taxes. Ymmv
Tax is theft .. 
Always...always preface all questions with "it's pretty dumb".
you pay taxes on the profit. So what you bought and sold at. 
How dare you post a real world use case question, we only complain about things here. 
Not exactly what you're asking but maybe a place to start is the guy who made the Bitcoin icons a couple weeks ago.
https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8imj5c/ive_made_some_free_bitcoin_icons/

My GF does logo design. PM me with what you need and how much you're looking to spend.
Yup! I'm a graphic designer that has been accepting crypto for the last few months. Feel free to pm me for a chat and to view previous work : )
I do as well, you can PM me anytime. 
Fine, I don't like you either. 
Based on? 
entirely plausible scenario. a test of $6500 does seem to be in order,
however, it is also possible that it first takes a side-trip back up to 8000.

We’re all getting older. What will you tell the ppl you interact with the most about these times of Coin?
That's no moon...
maybe but the support at the 7k is very strong
more like 2k
Where have I heard this before?
This is probably third time this year
Heard the same shit about 9400 and I bought in... now look where that got me.
Absolutely not true
lel
yes indeed better to buy now than be sorry later
True, it will CRASH below 7k
i hope it will pusj through and bitcoin surpass this anomaly circling about it
Not a chance of 10k+ this year.
> Do not fear people.

i don't fear people, it's the dips that scare me.
mind=blown
Look at price at venezuela... bitcoin there skyrockets throught the roof constantly independed on the price fluctuations of dollar price. So it goes to infinity as state owned money hyperinflates.
maybe or maybe not. the support at 7 k is still very strong

Oi!! Bitcoin in 2018 is a weird motherfucker. 
30k
I think about 9980. After what happened last time at around 10.000 a lot of people that are buying now or missed out on sellout last time are setting that limit as it will be VERY hard to even reach the 9990.
[deleted]
Honestly, I think 10k is a safe bet. I’d be willing to cash out my initial investment there, and keep my profit in BTC/eth/alts. 
27000
28575
OK THX I JUST SOLD EVERYUTHING@@!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
lol, you people are here every single time the market crashes.  3 weeks later we are in the 9's, everyone has forgotten your silliness and all the other idiots are proclaiming we are going to 100k.  
It amazes me how shortsighted some people can be. I swear if ADHD was a disease, it would be epidemic in this thread.
True lol
username checks out.
You're on the waiting list.
They'll be back...and in greater numbers.
*crickets*
i think they are just here watching and waiting that this storm with bitcoin pass and horaaahhh.. another beautiful day
I predict $8k by mid next week. 
Huh, Redditor for a day making crazy claims of price prediction. Nope, no one is trying to manipulate the price a certain way. Funny thing is when you see the price go way up, there aren't as many one day accounts claiming $40,000 btc. So strange. 
Are you new?
??
Dang my current projections are that we’ll only need to maintain 1/10 000 000 of the total supply (2 BTC). My ancestral plan is counting on the majority of private keys being lost when Elon inevitably fires up his quantum laser AI rocket tunnels, accidentally causing an EMP blast that reaches from here to Alpha Centauri.
Gonna have to rethink things. The 23rd heir to my keys will need to accumulate more somehow before 2750. Perhaps Saturn’s core will yield more platinum than my current estimations? Hmmm
Oh god, I would spend every dime I have. 
Bitcoin and cryptocurrency could create a decentralized payment method where people own the wealth, not government and elites. Regulations however are absolutely a must for the success of crypto. There's just way too many scams and too many scums in crypto. 
No, they can't.  But simply by making public the manipulation is enough to crash the price.
you can go broke shorting. 
You’re not speculating a notion of speculation here are you?
There actually is no way the true price could be $1000.
21 Million * 1000 is only 21 Billion

21 Billion is just a skyscraper or two in New York, it’s not the market cap of a scarce store of value asset, particularly the latest and most ideal one mankind has ever seen.

Internet-like network effects are bound to push usage/demand for Bitcoin well beyond the multi-trillion dollar market cap. It’s not quite guaranteed, it’s just highly likely to be worth $100k plus in the intermediate future.
Also depends how many new dollars are printed.

Think of Bitcoin this way: the demand side, fiat currency, can be printed infinitely. 
The supply side, BTC, is incredibly limited, scarce and historically easy to lose.

Do the math. This is the greatest economic shift and opportunity in recent human history. The arbitrage is that most folks aren’t computer scientists or economists, let alone both. They’ll adopt it for more pedestrian reasons, after an inflection point of some kind.
Lol, people don't like this comment but it seems pretty accurate! 
What insightful commentary.  You should be an analyst. Zzzzzzzzz.....
[Thank you!](https://staffino.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/One-does-not-a779dx.jpg)
Yes you did.
Could we make it Wednesday?  I'm rather busy Tuesday.
Local stores will never really accept Bitcoin so long as their liabilities are denominated in $s. The ones that do will either convert immediately to $s or really be speculators. 
Nah, I don't buy bitcoin...  Someone in r/weedstock said you guys are a having a bloodbath so I just want to come in and check on yall, looks like things are turning around.
There's another bottom trendline at $6800. If you put a stop loss there, you might get rekt right at the reversal...
Zimbabwe dollars lol
;)
Sorry I forgot it was only manipulation if the price goes down
No
Or a reverse horizontal cowgirl.
GDAX takes 4+ days to transfer money in though, so you have to plan ahead. Plus who knows where the price will be at that point.
Ban who asks for ban please
No didn't you hear, the rise was based on it's true merits. It was worth every penny at  $18k but now its only dropping because of "Whales" who are perpetually selling apparently.

/s
I think the next thing will  happen is very difficult speculate
but eventually bitcoin will recover as the usual pattern in this market
So, I was asking a legitimate question...Where in Washington state is it economically feasible to mine?
Where? My electricity is asinine!!! 
Truth
Spoofing dicking around?lol
Thanks for the thorough response. So buying small increments every week was kind of a nightmare of a decision. 
No, you do not need to file amendments, because you are only responsible for reporting the taxable event, which is when the coins were sold.
I personally enjoy roads, schools and healthcare here in Canada.
one of those people. stop driving on those tax funded roads, using tax funded schools, going to tax funded hospitals. if you have a fire, don't call the tax funded fire department. get over yourself, get a better job, make more money. you won't sweat taxes so much if it's a miniscule part of your salary.
And prison is for the honest people who don't comply.
I feel dumb for not understanding it. Sorry if my preface annoyed ya. 
Right, but he bought at all different prices.  So the $1000 he just sold, was that bought at $2000 giving him a gain.  Or at $19000 which gives him a loss?
Based on the fact that he sold and wants to buy in lower. Like most here.
Time to retest earlier lows and clear out the weak hands. Needs to go below previous low and induce panic selling. Wouldn’t be surprised to see 3000
Lets hope so :P
8400 and feeling like shit. Stay strong brother
Crazy anomaly known as a "bubble"
Thanks for playing
So you're going to put some of your profit from BTC in BTC?
It's not that silly, there's definitely scope for further downward movement and there's no guarantee it bounces back. Personally I think it will, but it's a bit hasty to just outright dismiss the possibility of bitcoin stabilising somewhere close to where it is now. 
i think it was and looking a  possbility that next
there is t the thread 
Huh?  A Redditor for 3 weeks who has less than .1 bitcoin trying to argue with someone who has been here for years.

Get your head out of your ass.  Smart people don't keep using the same account here so stop parroting shit your read, idiot.
Gotta stay careful with those 1\-day redditors, they are the the main force behind price manipulations.
He must be! 
Lol
No bloodbath when the price is still 7500 USD and you bought at 660 USD ..
Bitcoin is up 204.35% since last year. Over the past 5 years it has outperformed Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google.
Hahahahaha that’s why I’m here.  ! I have a few btc though 
I can tell you why. Go the legal states. It's on every corner. Race to the bottom for pricing and market saturation comes on fast. Sooner rather than later it will be no different of a market than cigs n alcholol 
It's called a Pump! Or maybe a Bull trap! Or maybe a FOMO inducer! 
i think it i the best time to hold and produce better
[deleted]
really? tell GoPro that. the history of their stock looks very similar to BTC. reality is, there is no pattern.
If all of these investigations result in arrests/regulation, I think you can throw your pattern in the trash can.

I called the sec it's only a misdaweiner(I know,go ahead and down it lol)
yeah.  IF he really did nothing but sit on them then it should be easy.  30/wk * number weeks = money in, regarless of purchase price.  sale out - money in = profit.
I bet You enjoyed paying for rob fords crack habit as well you moron 
Tax is never a miniscule part of your salary and you saying that proves that you have no idea what you're talking about. The more you earn the more you pay dum dum. 
It's weird how we were able to have all of those things for 137 years before we had a permanent income tax.
Money to keep the cogs turning .. You have Stockholm syndrome .. You sound like the sort of person that would panic over a parking ticket .. 
In the uk if earn over 46,000 a year the tax is 40 % .. That seems fair ay .. you are a text book product of the system .. And you're  happy about it .. ... Obedient lemming 
~~prison~~ FEMA camps

Fixed that for you 🤛
I actually thought it was funny.
If he is in the US:

he has to total everything he paid for all his bitcoin,  then divide that number by the number of bitcoin he has to determine his cost basis for each bitcoin.

Then,  on the day he sells,  he subtracts (hopefully)  cost basis from his sale price,  what's left over he pays tax on.
You can choose to start with the oldest purchase,or the most recent, just have to consistently use the same method LIFO or FIFO
I believe that an argument can be made for both LIFO and FIFO withdrawals, which would impact the taxability of the transaction. Once you commit to a rule you need to follow it forever, however. You should not take our advice and consult a tax accountant.
She, and thank you for articulating what I meant. (if that sounds sarcastic, it's not meant to be.) 
Ssssssh!
Weak hands?  Lol!

Given the news from DOJ, it's more likely that the whales doing manipulation who will be existing.  I'm expecting massive dumps.
? I’m saying keep my profit In crypto and take back my initial investment. I’m almost to the point where profit > initial investment, I think 10k would put me well over that. 

I’m buying a house next month so I’ll need all the fiat I have available. 
You are going to feel like an idiot in a month when it’s back up. 
What?
I don't even have .1 btc. that is mad money brah. You so edgy.
I see what you did there.....
Really? You mean people actually act on what they see here? That is crazy.
I guess it depends on when you buy it.  I know folks who bought at 19k are not happen.

Now, my mother in law bought at 2k, so I know she is doing well.
100% in weedstock for me.

Bank account transfers take 4+ business days. At least in the US.
Yeah, WetSnatchy is a god damn shithole and it’s only cool there 4 months out of the year....But, go ahead and move there. 
I know I would have if I were Canadian. He was temporarily hilarious and hilariously temporary.
Holy strawman. No I do not. He was also not paid by the Feds and is dead. But I do enjoy schools, roads, healthcare, city infrastructure etc. I do not agree with the size of Government or their salaries/defined pensions but I do enjoy that having a very sick person in the family doesn't bankrupt us.
the more you earn, the more you pay. loooooooool. you clearly don't understand how the US works. tell our president that.
Bitcoin enthusiasts and morons seem to go hand in hand. 
we well used tariffs and had none of the social obligations we have now (no sosec, no medi, no wellfare, etc...). to think our government could run on tariffs alone in this day and ago is just absurd.
Except we didn’t have all those things, many are fairly new and in other cases fire departments would let your shit burn down if you didn’t pay their extortion.
I don't park illegally, so I don't have to worry about that.
You pay tax on your car, you pay tax on food, you pay tax on clothes you pay tax everything you buy with your money that has been taxed .. So no it's not a minuscule amount is it ..  You brainwashed drone 
you called me a name. awwww.  I'm a product of the system... well yeah, med school. 
and I'm happy about it? well yeah, I'm making really good money, have a career, a lovely family, and a plan for retirement.  you have a better plan? bc clearly complaining is working out great for you.
It's honestly a bad combo of not understanding taxes *or* bitcoin so i'm double dumb 
* she -- so I can total my purchase amount (~$800 that is now worth ~$1300) and divide it by the amount of bitcoin I own? (.12) and my purchase price would be $6400 across the board? That makes sense to me, honestly. 
Congrats!
You're misunderstanding. I'm not saying it can't happen and I'm hodling a small amount so I won't exactly feel silly...
#i think it was and looking a  possbility that next
#there is t the thread 

^^*bleep* ^^*bloop* ^(I'm just a bot, don't hurt me!) ^^*bleep* ^^*bloop*
In a few years 19k could very well be the new 2k.

Your tax pays for schools that teach people to get a job to pay tax . You pay tax for roads that get you to the job that pays them tax .free healthcare ..if everyone's sick or dying no one pays tax . Just In case you haven't got it yet .. They make you pay money so you can keep paying them money .. 
Are you trolling? Tax brackets exist everywhere.. the more you earn the more % you pay.. even in the US.
That's exactly my point ...😂
Tax is theft only to antisocial people who dream they can do it alone. Based on the way you add insults to your every post, you fit the profile. If only you were sincere! Move to the Yukon, far off the grid, where no one will tax you anything.
Just because you don't understand something doesn't make you dumb, we all start somewhere. Now, premding like you understand when you dont...thats dumb.
I was wrong, it shouldn't make sense.

You only have to average if you CAN'T find your buy history and all you have is receipts of money going in.

If you have your transactions,  you can match up buys to sells on a FIFO basis,  (First In, First Out).   You could also choose LIFO, (Last in First Out),  but whatever you choose,  you have to treat ALL of the asset's transactions the same forever forward!

Obviously if you want to pay the LEAST amount of tax,  you could choose LIFO (the LAST purchases you made,  which are the most expensive, are the first to be 'sold' and their profit calculated.

If you don't tell the IRS anything,  they ASSUME you've chosen FIFO!  It doesn't matter what you choose,  so long as if you ever get audited you can show you've always used whichever method you choose.


I believe that, too, I believe bitcoin can easily get into the 30k range and beyond. 
They’ll land in CB from your bank and then you’ll transfer to GDax...It’s free to transfer money from BA but costs to use debit and wire transfer. 
You are free to homeschool all you want though. Most things covered before University have nothing to do with getting a job.When you go to University you choose what you study. If you want to take women's studies and not work you are free to do so. 

People do not want to be sick or dying because it is not pleasant. Free healthcare costs the Government money, it does not make them money. We simply socialize the cost of healthcare which is by far the best way of doing it. They save people with critical illnesses and disabilities who will not contribute taxes but rather receive benefits so your argument makes no sense.

The roads are also there to deliver goods to different communities and for this thing called driving cars which is useful for all kinds of things. Trucking is very important if you like to eat.
exactly, get to the top of a bracket, you pay the same as the guy on the bottom. then start your legal write downs. it's the American way, every family is a company, or at least should be on paper.
Anyone who thinks tax is theft is antisocial that's brilliant mate .. Just bend over and take it then buddy.. 
would never dare premding 
Pretending*
Thank you. i think that all makes sense. I almost am willing to pay a higher tax to not do any of this. 
He is not shortsighted, just a shill.
Commonly known as troll.
The fact you think they have your best interests at heart is hilarious .. How much do roads cost ? Are they not already built ? university give you a list of subjects to choose from so you can study what you want as long as it's on the list lol .. Then we have student loans .. Borrow money and get in debt to study to get a job to pay tax ! Unreal 
Thank you for proving my point.  I can afford taxes and I like helping people, knowing they'll do the same for me.  You're just a sad hypocrite, sucking at the teat while complaining about the free food.
are you a top? I don't think that guy is a bottom. he may not appreciate your advances.
Premding causes cancer. 
I'll just assume you are trolling.
Sucking off who's teat 😂 Arh yes because all your tax money goes towards helping everybody ..haha .. 2 year olds are less naive then you . 
You clearly enjoy getting shafted by the government as well mate just keep doing as you're told .. Don't challenge anything .. Never ask any questions .. Make sure you Keep up with the Jones's 
Why because you can't refute any of my points ? 😂
maybe...but at least i'm not a hypocrite.
bwaaaahahahaha... I've challenged plenty in my life, was a stayathomedad, and am a male nurse practicioner. been going against the grain my whole life. and guess what, I thought like you when I was a young male too. you'll grow out of it, don't worry.
Roads need to be maintained for obvious reasons, university is optional, student loans are a choice. Work full time in the summer and part time during school and you can come out with very little debt in Canada. I never claimed the Government is a benevolent entity that only looks after our best interest. They do however provide services that most people could not afford on their own ie healthcare and infrastructure that allows you to shit down a hole in your house and have water delivered to your taps. Also why do you care about the value of your crypto against fiat if you plan to hold forever. Caring about the value implies you look to cash in eventually. Hypocritical.
Tax is important, the problem is that its not done fairly. The system is all made in a way that keeps most poor and a few rich.
Every libertarian I know is a white land owner with a gun, they advocate feudalism because they believe they’ll be the Lords. Every single one of them benefits from living in a society they wish to destroy. 
you've  accepted it ..and are defending a clearly corrupt system  That's the difference .. Not everyone sells out bud 
How much does it cost to maintain roads mate ? Compared to the total tax revenue ? Come on man that's a silly point . Student loans are a choice to people that can afford to go to school .. Not everyone's in a position to work and study ..loans are offered, pushed even .. Your healthcare is free the same as here in the uk but is it really free ? The U.K. Tax bracket if you earn £50,000 a year is 40% the USA tax is nowhere near that ! Healthcare is not free they just take it from other places .. And I'm not sure what you mean hold forever .. You can spend crypto 
sells out? is it 1990 again, I feel like I'm talking to 16 year old me. you'll figure it out one day. maybe you won't. either way, good luck out there.
I don't know the amount I was using it as an example. There are plenty of other things... transit, sewers,  etc. The biggest expense is benefits for the elderly. Should we just leave them on the street? Just a few examples. This is not me advocating bloated government or anything, simply outlining that some taxes are justified.

Your answer about schooling is a cop out. Loans are not "pushed". I was never offered a loan when I went to school as I decided I wanted to come out of it debt free. No one was trying to push me to get a loan so that's BS. I have never seen/heard a commercial for student loans. Plenty of people on my campus were drinking Starbucks and partying 3-4 nights a week. That's their choice and do not complain about student loans after the fact. Hopefully they got decent jobs. It is that kind of keeping up with the Jones's that handcuffs people, not taxes.

Our top MTR is over 50% here in Canada which is ridiculous. I would be happy with a low flat tax of say 10% and a tax on non-essential consumption i.e don't tax food but tax all non-essentials.

So is crypto a medium of exchange or a storage of wealth? If everything went haywire and they system collapsed would you rather a few bitcoins or ammo and food?
