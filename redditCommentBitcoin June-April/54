The Battle For $7k.....again!
Yet another chance. Be a whale for a day, make some cash. 
So many tarot readers.
69 dudes.  Whoa. 
Panic and pandemonium at r/Bitcoin as Bitcoin drops .5%

More at 11.
Hi friends!

I added new indicators to Bitgur Customizable Watchlist ([bitgur.com/watchlist](https://bitgur.com/watchlist)). Now you can add ATH and moving averages (EMA5, EMA10, EMA20, EMA50, EMA100, EMA200). Here you can watch screenshot: [i.imgur.com/lpSYF2p.png](https://i.imgur.com/lpSYF2p.png). I hope it might be useful for people who use EMA in trading. 
LES GO LES GO
I dont know why everyone is so excited. We've slowly seen a lack of BOTH resistance and support. The volume is being compressed which will cause a break out that can take us on a short bull run, or a devastating bear run. Considering we still have a lot more correcting to do from the reckless support of 2017 its most likely gonna break out following the down trend.

Do y’all see the coming world war as good or bad for bitcoin prices???
Time for the next pump...
Breakout
Look at the size of the bars on the 6 hr chart.  Market appears to be reaching equilibrium.  Will be interesting two days from here to see where we go.  
I threw all in yesterday, and I feel like it’s ready to blow up.
We moon now?

Funny how it take 2 hrs for bitcoin to crash and 3 days to recover 
Rise of the Alt Coins
Wow! Someone just bout 143BTC on GDAX in one pop. That's just shy of 1 million dollars.
Well, it seems that the downtrend is about to end. The dip is raising and the 7200 resistance is easy to break.
My theory for the BTC sideways movement of the last two weeks:

Obviously a lot of people (traders, recent buyers, and old hodlers), think the BTC price is going lower and want to sell. They have pushed it downward after every recent climb (on Apr 3 and Apr 9).

However, the greater force is the new whales that have been eying BTC since it's newsworthy growth last year. It is common sense to say that anyone looking to start investing in BTC for the first time and who has done their risk/reward research has picked a price point at which to buy in. This includes all the new crypto hedge funds. What is unknown is how much new money is coming in and at what price they are looking to buy BTC.

I had previously thought that 1/4 of the ATH price at 5k USD would be the largest support line of new money coming in. But, it's looking like 1/3 of the ATH is more likely, at 6.5k USD. 

To me, these previous two weeks of support at 6.5K USD suggests that 1/3 of the ATH is the magic support number at which many new whales want to buy in. Consider the quick bounce back during the Feb 5 dip. So why 1/3 of ATH? It is similar to previous BTC major corrections, but it's literally just a mental number that stands out in investors' minds: "BTC will probably fall to one third of its ATH price during this correction," is easy to say, so that's where they plan to buy in.

I don't believe in predicting the future, but as a BTC (longterm) trader, I believe in betting on the future. My bet is that there is potential for a BTC 2018 ATL of 5k USD, but I think this recent bouncing off the 6.5K USD line over the last two weeks is the bottom of the 2018 price correction. A slow and steady bull market could follow.

This is not financial advice. DYOR. Posting here only to timestamp my estimate.
Guys, my dog's shat had an upward pinch to it.  I think that's a sign of a bull run.  Yes ?
I wish it was this stable when it was around the ATH :( 
If the bulls could move it up to around $7500 I think that would make people believe that we are going up again.  
Lol .... one good thing about the slow pace is that even a $100 jump looks HUGE on the chart :)

Bitcoin is almost as boring as the game of cricket. 
With Dow set to fall up to 300 looks like great time to trade and buy some Bitcoin now 
Who's in for some long green dongs?
[deleted]
Everyone here getting excited about a 100 point move, that's nothing. We need a solid 500 point move in a short period of time to confirm any upside reversal. Still too little volume coming in right now. 
I know it's probably asked a lot but what's the cheapest way to withdraw from Coinbase?

 In the UK if that makes a difference, I read something about sending it to GDAX?

Thanks.

With more and more companies making better and better ASIC's and Mining hardware will the 21 million hard cap get reached sooner than we originally thought?
what a fight for 5$ to the next wall at 6010. 
It’s getting harder to wait to buy... I’m afraid it won’t go much lower anytime soon.

How to delete bitcoin ? 
we need more power cap'tin! She aint gunna hold! 
The battle for 7k is underway
This is it!!! All this patience is about to pay off (pun intended)

I can't take anymore traps
Anyone else bored AF. This has got to be one of the tightest price range bitcoin has ever been. If you zoom out its been like this for half a month. Everyday I wake up anticipating price movement. Only the alts seem to be benefiting while bitcoin is stable. 
If I wanted to sell a car >10k and accept bitcoin as payment, how would I handle the transaction? Thanks
Trading Analysis:

What we have developing is a classic Mitsubishi Step Pattern, with gradually ascending steps.

According to classical TA theory, if there is one more step, it will lock into this pattern forever.  Gradually ascending until the price reaches 100k
Oh look, somethings actually happening again.
HODL
Everybody all in!
To the moon!
Heh.

BTC still bullish, on the **50 week** MA !

https://www.coindesk.com/history-repeating-why-bitcoins-price-could-rise-in-q2/

Why not make it 52 weeks and call it a year.  FFS.

Still hodling tho.
Firmly believe we will see a big rise here soon back to $10k. This downtrend since the two peaks at 11k are from big owners dumping. Once whoever it is that keeps dumping coins is done we should move up. We keep getting pushed down on huge coin dumps and then move back up on low volume. If you have been looking closely at the minute/5min charts on GDAX for the past couple weeks you would see how these 2-5k coin sells have dropped us everytime there is a recovery.
Hey guys have you heard of Dogecoin its the best new currency in the whole entire bitworld!

**Bear Market 'Largely Over,' Crypto Fund Manager Claims**

https://www.coindesk.com/bear-market-largely-over-crypto-hedge-fund-manager-claims/

Timothy Enneking, managing director of Crypto Asset Managment, LP, said Monday that the winter in cryptocurrency markets is "largely over."

Crypto Asset Management, which was founded last year and has roughly $20 million in assets under management, saw its CAMCrypto30 cryptocurrency index fall by 69 percent since its high in January. Enneking sees four reasons for the collapse.

Asset consolidation, regulatory concerns, massive liquidation by the Mt. Gox trustee and startups' selling crypto assets to pay salaries and expenses are all factors in the market's overall decline, he wrote.

"Consolidation after the amazing 2017 increase" drew back some of the funds invested in cryptocurrencies, he said.

Invsestors are also likely wary due to recent regulatory actions. While he did not cite any specific events, the report comes just weeks after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission subpoenaed startups with initial coin offerings.

It remains unclear what exactly the SEC is looking for, though an official confirmed "dozens" of investigations were underway.

The other two reasons likely had less of an impact, Enneking said.

These factors have mostly been priced into the cryptocurrency market already, which, despite the recent rout, is still up by over 600 percent in the last 15 months, he wrote.

Enneking also noted that bitcoin's share of the overall cryptocurrency market has fallen from 45.7 percent on Dec. 20 to 44.3 percent. This decline in "BTC dominance" has coincided with a decline in correlation between bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, he wrote.

While the note does not comment on what declining correlation means, it could indicate that the quality of individual cryptocurrencies is beginning to have a greater influence on their market prices.

The combination of these factors indicate that the market should begin rebounding soon, he indicated in his report.

Do we trust this little bull flag?
Can someone explain the following transaction to me?

thats a big bunch of walls
seems like dumper tried hard at 7k level but fail attempted  due to huge buying pressure  
She hit a wall and bounced down. now slowly back up. hang in there boys
wow no red whatsoever when I scroll through the trade history on gdax
Well.... there's that.
Somebody had a burrito filled with Curry. Holy Crap.
Wow.. Out of nowhere..
We're now lower than the bottom of that big jump up yesterday. Big leg down incoming.
Over $7k today folks? 
Volume is going up slowly which is a good sign.  This time yesterday we were around 7500 on GDAX, today 10700.
Bitcoin is up .26% this it boys, clear shot straight to the moon.
Shorters getting rekt.
I think we can safely consider 7500 gone...
"let them in...."
Mcafee is almost in the "no eat" zone again.

What happened to Bitcoin hash rate. Down more than 60% today.
Show me your wall, and I'll show you mine...
Man. I have this gut feeling we are about to see some upward movement
is there a good explanation for why prices of all cryptocurrencies tend to rise and fall in unison?

Hello, I've been studying this market since the beginning of April (I've never studied anything over stock-market)

My father-in-law and my mother-in-law were deceived by a group of people and lost a significant amount of money (2000USD) since mid-January.

I need help to learn a little more about this market, I took their wallet from the beginning of April and I'm trying to recover what they lost, they are poor people and without much study.

All help is very important

Thanks in advice

Sorry about my bad english!
I predict a dump shortly in the next couple of hours

Hello all, a few people and I have been working on a project to link together different communities of crypto traders. Called the [Crypto Trader Network](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTraderNetwork/wiki/network) (very original, I know..). It has been going well and we're seeing some serious progress/growth. It's similar to the SFWPornNetwork but a lot less rigid, much more informal, and entirely based around creating a resource for traders and bringing together crypto related subreddits. 

I am hoping to gain some support from trading communities such as this one. I'm open to any thoughts/ideas/suggestions/requests/criticism, and I would be grateful for any support that can be given.

.......................................................................again
Yeah, but..  Good for Bitcoin.
Sad but true, having been through 2001, it feels the same.  But I struggle, I can't remember the actual capitulation.  Only a year later, in retrospect, was it obvious.  All I can say is I don't feel we've seen the true capitulation yet.
If there is a world war, you will be dead so it wouldn't matter
You mean dump...
Where? On the moon?
Acne?
Same feeling here. Nothing really shocks us anymore, even if it were to go down to 6100 not many people would care at this point. Looks like we're all betting for 7500. After that lamboland.
Not all in, but added $50k worth.  
Yesterday? That some stamina.
Tomorrow.
I think whale bears tried to push it down further last time to make new lows but the "normal" state of the market at the moment is sideways to slight uptrend. I think it's good that bears couldn't make a new low.
Shorts are also rising.

People are expecting the next btc crash soon.
The big wigs are definitely buying right now.
I personally believe the price drops because exchange platforms have to pull their money out. (That’s when people say “the whales are selling”.)
In January is was because China had made Bitcoin totally illegal. And the dip since March it’s because Japan is banning unregulated exchange platforms.
China banning Bitcoin is unpreventable.
For Japan, I’m not too worried because the government is actually very supportive of Bitcoin. The exchange platforms with licenses are invested by large companies and they are doing well. I believe the buyers (who were kicked out because the exchange platform they were using was banned) will come back to the market sooner or later.

Anyways, I’m holding and doing nothing because I’m a optimist and a terrible trader.
> To me, these previous two weeks of support at 6.5K USD suggests that 1/3 of the ATH is the magic support number at which new whales want to buy in.

I share most of your analysis but I am not convinced about figures. You said it all: these are "magic" numbers. If market follows an unpredicted move then everybody will refresh and modify price perception accordingly. Also if you look at previous crashes we can find value from -60% to almost -85% compared to highest point. Different contexts, different price impacts. We still do not know what will be lowest point and we will discover it afterwards. Those who will say "it told you so" just happen to have right guess and sometimes did not even invest since they had low trust in their gut feeling. 
Man you gotta stop takin' shit so seriously
Was too steep up there, sareh.
7.5 would be nice, but 8k is needed for true fomo 
We nearly got to $7,500 last Monday until someone crashed the price.
Thats what whales need to dump on them. 
Lmao.  So many YouTubers saying the "crash" is over.
I love TA.  Now following you.
Do it like cricket, park your pick-up next to the field, break out the BBQ, fill the back with water, get the girls in there, get the beers out and start cooking. That's how we used to do it back in the day.
but cricket is interesting...
We already had enough of this moon & doom stuff.
When moon?
I am wondering how long it will be before Reddit shuts down the cryptocurrency message boards .... I saw news yesterday that they shut down all of the firearm and gun related boards .... I guess when they perceive that Cryptos represent freedom they will shut them down as well ...
what are we waiting for lets go contribute. 
sepa bank transfer i think its 10 pence 
Withdrawing the BTC or selling BTC and withdrawing the £?
Do you mean withdraw to your bank or withdraw to you crypto wallet?
Dude Revolut, nothing but Revolut. Cheapest and easiest by a country mile. PM me if you need help. Also from UK and successfully done this many times with Coinbase and Revolut. Crypto to GBP and into my UK bank account.
[deleted]
What makes you say that?
No
No, because the difficulty increases based on the hash rate.
>It’s getting harder to wait to buy... I’m afraid it won’t go much lower anytime soon.

That's called FOMO my friend, and it will make you a very poor man.
I don't understand how you can't be in already. If an asset loses 75% of it's value it's time to buy. 
Be patient.
[removed]
Nice and slow
You can't.  But you could wipe your wallet and destroy your keys.  BTCs are still there, but cannot be found.
Im given her all shes got.
Pass the toilet roll, I've got Klingons.
Try 3 years of a slow bleed.
Where have you been all week?
Yep. I'm barely chart checking. I don't know if that's good or bad. 
Write up the bill of sale in BTC instead of USD. Provide buyer with your bitcoin address and make sure the transaction is verified on the network. Do it all face-to-face.
Buyer sends you Bitcoin, you give buyer car. Done.
Remember to pay the capital gains tax.
Nah, its making a classic gluteus maximus and pubococcygeal pattern and getting ready for a dump. 
Thank god.  I thought I was the only one who saw it.  I just went all-in.
Lol
Bro what is this a car?
The second quarter of 2018 may bring some respite for beleaguered bitcoin (BTC) bulls.

The world's largest cryptocurrency by market valuation seems to have found a bottom around the $6,500 mark, having dropped 50 percent in the first quarter - notably, the worst Q1 performance on record. Overall, its safe to say bulls have been struggling to find their feet as indicated by stagnant prices and a narrowing price range.

Yet, speculation is doing the rounds that big Wall Street names (such as Soros and Rockefeller) are set to enter the crypto space. If confirmed, the news could ramp up the bull case, as happened with the advent of bitcoin futures soon before bitcoin's December price peak.

However, history may be on bitcoin's side as well - an analysis of the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index shows BTC tends to perform well in the second quarter.

Very nice i hear.
Pssh, bytecoin it the greatest thing ever!
Just think about when after that happens though and he runs out of bitcoin or decides to stop selling, it will be one less person with a bunch of bitcoin to dump.
im pretty sure the only thing controlling the market now is hype
There still tied up in legal crap for a couple more years. I suspect we wont see them come into play till after everyones been repaid. Which is a slow and long process.

He can also do 1 of 2 things with them. Keep them and sell for his own profit. In which case he will crash the market unless he goes off chain. Or redistribute some or most back to their original owners in which case it may somewhat crash (bassed on assumption owners will sell )or be a slow bleed as some of the old owners sell and some hold but then will stabilize and head back up. Assuming he doesnt redistribute during a crash or crazy December peak when it can compound, announces his plans clearly, loudly with enough advance notice and  does it over a period of a few months it shouldn't be TO bad.

I doubt he will keep them all. He's already pretty hated and if i were him id be fearing for my safety. Especially if i were keeping them. Best way is to redistribute 3-4x the original value and be like "yeah i fucked up. But look, you still made 3x roi when every other solid investment in that timeframe made 1-2x im trying to fix it" that would help ease the sting for most people and still leave him a 10x millionaire.
Great, protection against inflation 
Syria and the Russians ? Bitcoin won't matter. Nothing will matter. You and everyone you know will be dead in a matter of months. 
Fortunately the attack was short lived. The mods were quick to notice that their privileges had been revoked and a little bit of investigating made clear what happened.  A support request went out and was all resolved in about an hour. 

Don't think they know who was responsible, only that an old admin account had been compromised.

It's all sorted now and things seem to be back to normal 
Who cares? 
and..
What exactly is your question?
Look again
No one FUD! It's a trap, so they can buy in cheaper. It's gonna go back up in no time.
Frantically dialing Lambo centre....
Good call!
Soooo, anybody notice these crashes are getting smaller and recovery times quicker? 

yes :-)
You must have blinked. 
Yes.  I think there is a very high probability of that.

Just bought me one of the "Antminer" thinga-ma-jigs. Shipped last night. I'll help out as soon as I can. 
Not true, check your source.
there are people actively working against this.
Trading between coins is easy. So, many people (or rather: bots) do that when prices fluctuate, to maximize profits or minimize losses. It works similar to arbitage trading.

This couples the prices. At least in the short term.
Har?  I don't see it moving.  It's just lying there like a dead dog.
It wouldn't be interesting.  It's kind of irrelevant.
Your lonelyness is showing 🤗
What exactly is your question?
what a terrible time to be a student  
Buy Bitcoin and Hodl
From what I can derive about your background - "studying" the market since April - "never studied" stock - etc., this is my advice:

If you engage in trading now, you **most probably will lose everything** left in the wallet you were trusted with. Sorry. That's reality.

Second: **Don't do anything yourself.** Give advice, and let your parents-in-law decide. If you pretend to know what you are doing and lose their money, they won't forgive you easily.

Third: those are your parents-in-law best options:

- hold crypto and hope for better prices. Tell them they might see the value falling even more before a recovery. Tell them they might have to wait for many years before they can get their money back and some profit. Tell them there is a real risk crypto currencies to become worthless and remain worthless while the world moves on.

or:

- sell everything for USD, take the loss and keep the remains.

I know it's not the advice you were looking for. But it's realistic advice.

You mean you "hope" dump shortly because you didn't fill your bags at 6800?
We hit "a" bottom yesterday, on the 6hr chart.  It's likely to trend up from here.
The only scam in this forum is you. 
How much did you lose?

You bought near ATH, then sold, didn't you?

The only way you can make sense of it, is to see the market fail.

Unfortunately, you showed weak hands - and now you regret it.


They'll be back this summer

Sorry for you

Actually I think it was call ReDDcoin with to D's not redcoin. But that was the coin if Im not mistaking that coin is used to pay youtubers if you like their videos. But I think its reddcoin let me know if that was the correct coin.

Wow that article is so misinformed i dont even know where to start.
Very professional Title!  No one will waste their time with it once they see the title.
I believe there will be another dump, but not yet.

I could be wrong, of course.
I understand the charts.
you called it.
Shorts are at all time high - 38,700.

For those who think there's going to be a short squeeze should do their homework.  Daily trade volume is close to 680k.  That means a short ratio of only 5%, too small for a short squeeze.

Doesnt this also mean shorts may have to jump in and buy at some point if price continues to rise ? 
Too much momentum. I'm ordering my Lambo already.
That seems totally rational.  I don't think the market moves much based on rationality or fundamentals though.  I think we see the same boom and bust cycles that other industries have, but because its more speculative, the swings are even greater.  We can try to rationalize what the market's doing after the fact, but many times the price moves contrary to recent news or technical developments.  I'm also better at holding than trading.
Agreed. Also a singular newsworthy financial event could disrupt any such price predictions. I am personally acting on my prediction, but that action is definitely a form of gambling.
Yeah, he needs to get his shit together.
don't follow please. my TA is so strong that if everyone follows my advice, there will be no profits to be made

Blatantly not true about firearm subreddits. Wtf are you talking abiut
> I saw news yesterday that they shut down all of the firearm and gun related boards

Thats just not true all and can be easily verified, why are you spreading this shit? 


Let em’ I only glean useful information from a very few reddit users. Most of the time its a mind suck.
Look at the reddit app listing on the Google play store. They boast about how you can get up to the minute crypto news on their site. So I VM doubt that

If that scenario plays out and the difficulty increases, will the global amount of energy devoted to mining increase? (Assuming these new mining rigs use the same electricity)
[deleted]
Because it could still go lower.. if I had the money to consistently buy every paycheck I would do it. Unfortunately, I have a limited amount of fiat set aside and I want to try to buy as low as possible. I suppose I could buy in with what I have now and just buy more if the price drops much lower. 
When an asset with zero (or unknown) intrinsic value loses 75% of it's value, it's called a deflating bubble.  

And there is absolutely no reason why it can't go down to pre-2017 price of <$1k or pre-2013 price of <$100.

So it's irresponsible to encourage people to buy, especially those who can't afford to lose more.

You need a keen eye and a lot of experience.

What you're looking for is a series of steps.  Looking like, steps.

That, essentially, is the Mitsubishi Step Pattern.

It's not used much in TA, because it isn't useful.

Yup, they're probably already covering, so we'll get a short squeeze and then the crowd that was too scared to buy is going to have a FOMO attack...
me too.. we will go to the moon together.
You're a con.  There's an obvious Rotherhithe Tunnel Ver reversal in the pattern, and you can't even see it from your classic vulva perspective.
It's the same troll who comes around under different variations of Goldberg.
I've actually not yet done it for withdrawal only for depositing. but you basically give your banks SEPA information and it takes longer than a usual transfer. ideally you want the money in euros. I'd recommend creating a revolut account and SEPA transferring it to that converting to GBP and then withdrawing to your bank via revolut .
You sell your bitcoins for euros on Gdax, then transfer the euros back to coinbase and withdraw via SEPA using the revolut banking app, the cost for using this method is entirely free if under £25k
I've seen. It seems, you are right. Hillarious!

Well, I bought over that easter move and I am well up and holding. Unless you're a prophet it's impossible to predict where the bottom is. 

It's cheap, it has a history of recovering from crashes. It's been 4 months already since the start of the crash. Last year this time it also took off after the last crash. 

It's just time.

The only scam in this forum is you. 
I see you have been writing about logs.

You don't understand them, do you?

You think that the base of a log affects the nature of its graph.  You really have no understanding at all, do you?

[removed]
True story. If that lot gets out of hand we're gonners. 
these aren't change transactions?
Cancelling. Maybe. Depends on how this move goes...
Not a Bitcoin thing. Its Lambos and the moon. 
I don't know how that ended up in this thread, deleted it and put it in the right place. 
Found the creep
long as there was not "oopsies, honey....I just hit the SELL button and lost 50%! What button to undo??"

j/k ...she would have sold at 60% down ;P
If you lost a lot of money and need donations, this is not the right time to invest in cryptocurrencies.
Keep waiting for 6800, I hope you never ever get to see that price ever again in your life 😉
Damn.. I thought asking random people for 0.5 BTC worked on reddit ;(
All the above

SOLD for $1.69 gentleman with the high heels
$.076
I was just joking with you man, no need to be hostile.
Phuckin A's!
My life is mostly about dumps. Huge dumps....
This will pass. When all the wannabe daytraders lost their money trying to compete with the whales.

You are my witness.  Nobody else here believes me.
Exactly that.  

Shorts got rekked but that doesn't mean there was a short squeeze.  If you don't know what a short squeeze is, go look it up.

Short squeeze at 5% short ratio?

Do you even understand what you are blabbering about?

Let me give you a perspective - most shorted stock is Tesla and it's standing at close to 200% short ratio.
That would be quite the show. I'm sure many people shorted based on the predictions by the two top TAs on tradingview. Which both predict the start of the next leg down right about now.

*If* that doesn't happen, we'll see a nice squeeze...
I hope it happens. 
Think we need Tesla's for that. 
the student has become the teacher

liked and smashed that subscribe button
Be prepared because it will crash very quickly after any big takeoff. Millions of people still barely hanging on from December are just waiting for a price increase to sell and GTFO permanently. So actually the real bear market hasn’t even begun. It comes after the next few thousand $ up.
Well what’s the value of 10 million users if it’s not zero?
All of them substantiated by nothing but hot air and furthermore, there are as many who thinks this is a bubble already in deflating stage.

Look, I would like BTC to go up too but making silly claims like yours only show the lack of maturity in the average BTC investor.
We are still in the Visionary phase. We have not moved to the Pragmatic phase yet.

Bitcoin is still too difficult to use to be widely adopted. Once it’s easy to use then it may be worth 100k

OK Dad.

Could you run that elliptic curve commentary past me again - because it was bullshit.

You demonstrated as much understanding as Wright.

Are you sure you are not Wright?  You made all the same math mistakes.
Yeah, cuz Syria is totally a super power. And it's not like all Russia does is put on a big show and then do nothing or anything right? This is the real deal boys
Anycoindirect messaged me and said that this is the proof that they sent me ~0,09btc twice and they threatened legal action if I don't send them the coins back.

However, blockchain shows 0btc for the transaction here:
https://blockchain.info/de/address/1F6ee5uAAFDyqsB1F5YGQpVy5GPZfRfXXb

They say that these two transactions are the proof that they sent it twice to me:

Are you gonna take it out of the Hot Wheels package and play with it or just leave it as display?
He's going to show his thread to a girl to get in her knickers.
I really need to know where to look for more information about this market, such as reliable news sites, etc. The injury has already happened.
Will do, thanks buddy
It doesn't...but I'm hodling out hope for that kitten picture!!
I000 Satoshis
why even bother to respond?  You lose.
Here you go mr. smart ass. 6900 to 8500 in less than one hour. Almost 25%. Man what a sick show, watching all those short positions go pop. But yeah, short squeeze can't happen, ratio too low. Let's just call it a fat green middle finger then, right?
I have no idea what the ratio is. But it will help with the momentum. I don't expect anything explosive initially.
I think it's already happening. Just the initial phase now, the momentum will build. 
Who is worth following on tradingview? 
well if it is cryptos, tesla is no good, it has to be a lambo. Green apple colour for me :)
People said the same thing at $1, $10, $100, $1000 yet here we are, at $6000.
Thats what I dont understand how do people buy in at ath but when the price declines they just sit and wait. Buy more u are already invested. You bout in at lets say $19000 the price is $6900 buy more because when you get back to 19000 you will be on top. 
People have spent a lot of energy to try figure that out and no one is really sure, but it's not zero, that's for certain. 
Dingberry is a known troll here ignore him 
Weird.

So you crit his use of base 10, and suggest base 2?

Even though you have no idea what you are taking about?

OK.
Because if anyone makes a mistake and a bunch of Russians get killed or a bunch of Americans get killed its WW III. And a mistake is inevitable when you have these kinds of situations. 
urgh that's way beyond me. would be nice if there were some easy to follow UI's for the blockchain
All these transactions are from January 2017. And now they threatened legal action?
What is your and what is their address?

First the address 1Nv sent 0.09 BTC to address 1F6. Then address 1F6 sent 0.09 BTC to himself. Then 1F6 sent 0.09 BTC to the address 1GL.
Man I wouldn't know what to do with a car like that. My main wheels is a bicycle and I have a scooter for when I step out. With a cup holder for my beer. 

A Lambo is the most useless car I can think off. 

In fact I was in Singapore and some dude was driving a Ferrari, you can hear it miles away. So he pulls off at the light, gets to second gear, has to stop for the next light. I heard that car go about 5 traffic lights, he never got over second gear. Totally and utterly pointless. 

Where I am you can't get over 80km/h in the entire country, just water buffaloes and scooters. So if I ever bought one I'd wall mount it. Just what you have to do if you make it in Crypto's I guess. 
There is no reliable news about this market. It's all smoke and mirrors. From all sides. Sorry pal.

You can learn a bit about the technology from Andreas M. Antonopoulos. He is legit.

Thanks guys!
Look never trust blindly any news be cautious to invest in cryptos cause fake news spreads like fire in the jungle here. Study the market  & the charts importantly and always trust your instinct.

Ig there isn't any reliable news sources out there but be in touch and confirm it with another sources.
trust noone

Everything Roger Ver says is widely accepted as expert in the community. Just don't listen to his old videos, he used to have it all wrong. Also this is very good and reliable advice. 
Like I told you
Lost what?  You are really are a moron.

My last position was long, you retard.
Dude, there was no short squeeze.  Trade volume is high enough to cover all the shorts.

Yes - shorts got rekked - 15,000 down.  Given the pace, probably margin calls.  But there's still 25,000 short.

Anyway, I dissolved my longs and shorted at 7700 :)


You have no idea about most things you are happily posting, as long as it paints a rosy picture about BTC.  Whether it's shorts, silly charts, DB going down, recession or inflation.

This is irresponsible as it will mislead people into buying when they should not be.

I can understand your desperation for a higher price but this is not the way to do it.
Don't understand?  Everything looks obvious in hindsight.

People who bought at ATH thought that it will continue going up.

Just like people buying now, thinking that $6.9k is cheap because it will go back to $19k.

It might not and the price might sink to $1k.  Then I guess, people in future will be asking "why did those people buy at $6.9k when it's obvious that it's on a decline".

A large base is only relevant if it can be monetised.  E.g. FB and Google - advertising revenues.  ANT Financials - fees from payment services.

Even if BTC has a billion users, it's still zero if it generates $0 per user.
[removed]
Sure but the real question is, would it be profitable?
Funny how conflicts where little is to gain always get settled quickly and peacefully.


Just ignore it, even if it wasn't a scam, it's not logical to file suit for such a small amount.
Yes, they emailed me today.
Don't listen to him. Roger Ver is a fraud.
It did drop to 67k again like I said
Lol love how now he is saying he has longs and is shorting at 7.7 . Can't wait to see you in tomorrows thread with your next BS scheme.

get REKT 

edit: 3 days ago he posted that he sold his BTC and now he's claiming he rode the long and is shorting.  Ouch, feel bad for you brotha
Well at least the exchange I was looking at did not have enough volume and stops/calls/panic buys were cascading up to 8500.

> and shorted at 7700

Maybe a bit too soon? Whatever, I closed a small short after the prices were calming down at 7.5k (at loss of course) and think we will spend some time > 8k and < 9k. I will follow the price with sell stops and I am quite certain we soon go back < 7k, maybe a week or three...
Have you bought any ? 
No I get that. What I am saying if someone is willing to buy a coin for $19000 and the coin starts going down just look at is the money is gone, lost, bad investment right. For example from the drop at $19000 I bought on the way down and Im going to sell on the way up. Buy low sell high. 18000 is lower than 19000 and 17000 is lower than 18000. So its not were the price is at its were the price is going. That's why I believe people have weak hands because when the price is going up they buy when in actuality they should be selling. So right now is the time to buy imo and Im not selling anytime soon, at least until the price is above 10k
Lol well if you bought on the way down when it hits 10 u will be a happy camper.
1 Chinese miner returned $8 billion last year. It generates a shit load of dollars per user. 
[deleted]
Profit ? No mate, this is for world domination. And it will go nuclear very quickly. China and Russia is fed up with the US. 
Sounds like a scam to me.
Contact Anycoindirect customer service. But don't reply to the email, find the official email address on their website. Ask for clarification.
I think your sarcasm meter might need adjustment.
Obviously. Jesus, is the slash S thing really mandatory now? This wasn't even a subtle joke...
No, Roger Ver Core is a fraud. Roger ver is a saint.
Noob, it's common to switch from a long to a short position or vice versa if you think the price is reversing.

I have bought/sold/short for quite a while.  Do you have a problem with that?
Yes, at 6650.  And I will continue to buy at every 50 drop below that.

So yes, I have a vested interest to see the price move either way.
I don't think the current sellers are those who bought at ATH.  

More likely, they are those who bought at a lower price way before ATH.  If you look at the top 1,000 wallets, they started accumulating way back in 2013.

As for buyers, it depends obviously on whether they think it will go up.  I do - that's why I bought a couple of days ago.
Do not confuse the money made by miners and exchanges with money generated from ownership of BTC, which is $0.

Please stop muddying the water.

Why do you always argue with the trolls/shills? Lol
I doubt that, they're making so much money off us.
I checked SPF and DKIM for the mail and it is coming from anycoindirect.eu
I understood fine. But OP seems a little helpless. So I found it important to set this straight without irony.
Right but the price reversed AFTER you sold, so rip. It’s ok, not everyone is as good of a trader as they like to pretend to be on the internet :) 
See there you go, we're in agreement. We both think Bitcoins going to go up. Simple. 
well if they bought back in 2013 and are selling while the price is going down smh they must be hard up for cash.
I'm doing quite nice from my Bitcoin ownership thank you. No matter how you want to project your view, you can not tell me that a network this size has no intrinsic value. It's got huge value. If you hold a dollar all it does is lose value. Lost 90% of it's value since 1950. There's no dividend on it and the interest doesn't even begin to cover the inflationary losses and third party risk if you put it in a bank. So how does a dollar have intrinsic value ? It doesn't. Less than Bitcoin by a mile. Yet you're quite happy to hold dollars right ? 
Ok Mr. man. Lol
Russia has to deal with crippling sanctions. They are not amused. 
Good man.
If you are trying to say I'm a poor trader, at least follow my posts.

My last position was 6650 so it's pretty good profit at 7700.

Current short is at 7700, which is in the red.

Well, my bank account says I'm a pretty decent trader.  Are you one of the salty hodler who's still waiting for the moon?
There's a difference - 

I'm prepared to take a personal risk based on my own judgement and make no case for anyone else to do the same.

You, on the other hand, have been going around spouting nonsense in an attempt to paint a rosy picture and encouraging people to buy.

If you can't discern the difference, go fuck yourself.
Don't know, buddy.  Maybe they, like us, were expecting the price to recover to higher level.

I sold my original batch at 17k when it started declining.  Some of my other friends are still hanging on, some believes this is the best price and selling now.
Only a moron will be holding cash thinking it's an 'investment'.  Investors put their money into assets which deliver returns higher than inflation.  

So your comparing BTC to cash as investment vehicles is retarded.  

The intrinsic value of cash is the convenience it offers as a currency because it's widely accepted.  Which was what BTC was designed for and failed.

You obviously have little investment experience other than reading and regurgitating from google so stop muddying the water.
Mostly just the little guy that gets fucked tho, like always. Though this time some of the big players did apparently get screwed. Doubt it will last.
For sure, everyone is up on their port on the internet :)
You not getting it at home ? You need a group hug or something? 

My view on Bitcoin is positive and I think we've seen the bottom already. Simple as that. I don't need your permission to post that. 

What country are you in ? 
Yea but if the market is being manipulated why are they going to just lower the price. They also benefit if the price increases not just decrease. So in order for the whales to profit the price has to go up. People talk about MT. Gox selling at a low price well he is probably buying them back for his personal stash. Then drive the price up to make a profit. 
The whole point of BTC is that it's supposed to be internet cash. So the comparison is fair. And it's failed so far. The crypto story is very far from finished. 

I've been coding and trading systems for 16 years. My opinions are just my opinions, if you don't like them don't read them. 
Probably.

So why are you so annoyed if you think so?

Get a life dude, this is just reddit.
You belong to a group that I despise the most.

Creating "positive views" based on nonsense which will lead people to take risks that they aren't prepared for.

Where I live is none of your business.
I just wanted to get you the local lifeline number mate, so you could phone them if you didn't like one of my posts. Maybe they'd care. I don't. 

People must take responsibility for their own risks. Not up to you to police who can say what because other people might make a mistake. 
Risks that you failed to buy into, and that you now feel bitter about due to your lack of prescience.
Sure.

And I will keep refuting your nonsense.
Feel bitter?  Lol .... I just made a tidy amount dissolving at 7700.

.... and took a short position at the same time :) 
Feel free mate. But you don't hold your arguments, you always end up resorting to profanity. You're not doing to well. 
I think we've established at this point that you can't read markets. Might want to update buy those orders. Support my positions a bit more.... 
'Dissolved'?  What, a company?  

LOL.


Oh dear ... so I'm wrong.

Ok, done - Dissolved my long at 7700, took a short at same time, cancelled all other orders.
Dissolved ... position closed ... sold.  

You just keep shorting mate. Sell, sell, sell....
Not the language of trading tho., is it?
Cough .... 7803.

I think I might have overplayed my hand this round :)

I've seen plenty people drown like this, trying to swim against a strong tide. Go with it or drown. 
Nah, I'm quite conservative on shorts.

If it goes to 8k, I'm cutting my loss.
