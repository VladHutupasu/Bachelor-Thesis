fuel's ready  for 10k who's with me? 
Get the green dick paint out.
I think this is going to be a good month 
Today I bought a burrito and a coffee using BTC in New York City - WINNING!
the FOMO engine is gaining steam
Robinhood trading just went live in my State. I believe it went live for a few other states as well. 
next resistance level is at $9,800 for those asking and wondering.
Holy FOMO
*jst wants it to hit 10k to fuck that never again 10k guy*

Alright profit takers take your sell orders off and let the price climb, take your profit around like 12k so we can have the FOMO kick in to counter the sells and stabilize there for a little bit 
9,5K yo yo yo go go go :D
Me at work *Hit 10k, Hit 10k, Hit 10k*
10k 10k 10k
Easy 11 - 12 k Next 2 weeks. You cant stop the crypto train Once it Hits 10 k ... markmywords
Good day all. 
**Hey guys - come over here** - you're missing it..  :)
This is it. Resistance broken. Better sell all my alts to bitcoin now. 
**Keep going Bulls!**
Excuse me? Which direction is the FOMO-Train?
Already reasonably positioned pondering whether to FOMO in with some additional funds at my disposal
I like May.

/e: moving uncorrelated with the stock market btw.
is bitcoin gender neutral?
what is up with these sellers. 
Can you please not sell for a moment and just hold?
Hi everybody! 
Quick question - how do I open an account for my son?  It would be linked to my bank account.  His 11th birthday is today and I want to set something up so he can follow.
[So far, going as predicted, hope y'all didn't miss out](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8gg8oi/comment/dybxq4i)
We have past the low resistance point for too long now, and the support is getting stronger each day above 8K, and soon above 9K. We're at the point of no return. 

This means we'll never see prices below $8K for a very long time, if ever. 
Prepare 9,7K sooo soon \^\^

Edit: DONE :D
get ready for FOMO.. my bitcoin podcast downloads just doubled today
Bull market is on. I want to see 10k$ this weekend 
Lol compare the comments from yesterday's thread and today's thread ahahah
**Keep going Bulls.**
**Sell In May and Go Away? Not for Bitcoin Bulls**

https://www.coindesk.com/sell-in-may-and-go-away-not-for-bitcoins-bulls/

Sell in May and go away? While the month may traditionally give equity bulls cold feet, it should probably not be a cause of worry for the bitcoin market.

Indeed, it's true the month of May is often a weak period for equities, and that bitcoin has acted as a risk asset (moving in tandem with equities) since February. As such, cryptocurrency investors may fear that a potential drop in equities could end up dragging bitcoin prices lower.

However, historical data suggests that bitcoin is more likely to build upon its April rally this month.

Notably, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has scored gains in the month of May in five out of the last seven years, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.

View

BTC tends to perform well in May, thus an upside breakout of the narrowing price range is more likely and could yield a quick move higher to $10,000.

On the other hand, a downside break would open the doors to $8,490 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from $6,425 to $9,767.4).

Only a daily close (as per UTC) below $7,823 (April 17 low) would signal a bear revival.
Im so glad we're having slower but healthier growth this time around
today is the day fellow HODLERS, going to hit our recent highs today
wooot, it’s happeningg

Just broke even. Feels fucking good man. Time to buy more.  
Seen a guy running around town today giving away bitcoin flyers and he had like 5 people standing next to him asking him out.
€8k! What a day!
Asia won’t have anything on the USA come 12 hours from now. It’s the second pay day since Tax day. But also, it’s the ‘first of the month’ Friday.

Bitcoin will hit 10k+easily by 9am
Hungarian Hold when?
pumpy wumpy
Took me a while to find this daily. Not sure why isnt this pinned. 
why does bcash pump before bitcoin?
What's next resistance level TA chappies?  I don't fucking know.  Advise please.  :)
FOMO in or wait for a dip??
I've just been described as a crypto-anarchist...and it didn't bother me. 
What is happening? This is crazy! Please don't stop!
well. that escalated quickly
$10k EOW
I wonder if this is because stocks are doing poorly. It would be interesting if bitcoin started to move opposite to stocks.
We just got back into the old uptrend! To be honest: I thought, that this would be impossible!

Even if we drop out of it again, this is quite incredible!

https://i.imgur.com/ZT6UWUV.png
10k by this weekend or next week
I wonder: Do banks FOMO?
there might be another rally upward, we just have to wait and see what ASIA decides to do.
I’ve been holding my breath all day waiting for a drop but it seems I can let it go for now 
Ok lol. Hold on now. Just chill out 
Someone trying again?...
Looks like tax returns are in, huh?
Today looks like it's going to be explosive...big bars coming. 

Hope we all loaded up. 
Some early morning technical analysis coming at ya LIVE [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4Rqg6thBfw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4Rqg6thBfw)
Today is gonna be the day when I break even. Only 1,5% to go. 😊
Likely never seeing btc under 9k ever again. We'll be saying that about 10k soon
It’s happeninggggggggg. Omg, I’m about to come
**Support The Bulls as much as you can.  Many thanks.**
Hope we can get past 10k soon
We're in an ascending triangle right now. It might take some time before breakout, but this is a very bullish pattern. 😀

BTW: The blue line is the McAfee-Dickline.


Have a friend who wants to buy in today, you guys think it's a good idea? 🤔
I believe the binance nano pump started it all this time...


This is gentlemen 
Is bitcoin mining the same as quantitative easing?
I watched a brief youtube video the other day, and it claimed that if bitcoin became a true global currency, the bitcoin mining network would required over 100% of all the worlds electricity. 


Is that BS, or a problem still to be solved? 

Edit:  I mean 'over 100% of today's global electricity supply'.  Obviously it's not possible to use more than 100% of the worlds electricity.
G'day.  Did I miss anything?
can someone help me better understand utxo's? i read yesterday that bitcoin has 4 million utxos..how do we know this and what does that exactly mean
Sup guys.
To the Mars!
Its been sitting at 9599.99 for the last few minutes. It just does not want to touch 9.6k
Hello €8k!
Is this movement partly in reaponse to the goldman sachs news? Or has that been out for a while I only read about it yesterday. 
Some heavy resistance at the moment on GDAX.
Anyone got a video link to the Bitcoin question on Jeopardy? I can't find it on YT
Over on BitcoinMarkets someone suggested the possibility that maybe alt profits going to fiat via bitcoin may be a part of the current picture. Wondering what you guys might think? &, is this kind of coupling/trading ultimately part of the Bitcoin vision?
Quick question: I'm wondering about safety in the situation below.

I recorded a little screencap clip of me buying stickers from Blockstream with lightning. I was thinking of sharing it.

In the clip the lightning "invoice" is fully visible, and in my eclair wallet the txids for opening my channel are partly visible.

Is there enough information in the lightning "invoice" for me to doxx myself if I posted the clip? What about the channel transactions? 

Sorry for the newb question! Many thanks I advance.
let's smash 10k shall we.
Forza Bitcone!
Good afternoon from india
BTC price in Bitfinex is almost $80 higher than in Coinbase. Can anyone explain to me why this is so? 
How would you describe bitcoin mining in one sentence?
I wonder what Professor Bitcorn is doing on this fine day
Does anyone know the exact meeting date of the G20 June-July summary? 
I have some already but I want to buy more
I think I will FOMO if it hits 10k
MOON
Question:  If we get 5G internet rolled out across the world in a few years, which gives us Gigabit per second speeds over the airwaves, would that make big blocks less of a threat to decentralisation?
C'mon Asia...  Don't fuck this up for us!
BTC stuck with 5 confirmations and 2 hrs so far from the last conf. what is going on? any idea?
**Support The Bulls.**
Bitcoin is going to shoot up like  a civil rights hose. Damn!
Altcoins dying right now lmao
Time to cash out
[removed]
Yo fam what’s good question so like when these fools at Goldman get in the game moving BTC are they gonna be selling futures or some derivative type shit? And more importantly who owns that actual krypto yo? I mean this nigga knows ya gots’ta hold them keys... am I right. Seed words my nigga seed words. I ain’t traded with them cats on CFTC or none like that ya feel me. I keep it strictly ghetto and do ma bidness on Binance and I always keep it Kraken too! Alright for realz though shout out a nigga if ya all know who actually would own or does own the keys / seed words on that shit! You know how we do always HODLnInThaHood - peace!

Im in bro! 
Could you STOP upvoting me for suggesting that the minority practice of painting your dick green during a price pump is somehow normal.  

It is not.

(But keep the lube and green paint ready.  And warn your partner.)
Expensive burrito! But hey! Everybody wins!
Seems you paid 5% too much
In a few years you will have spent the 2018 equivalent of a lambo. You've won so hard.
You can trade Bitcoin on margin? Do funds leave Robinhood?
Awesome!
Just hit 9,500 in tradingview
Yes and I think it will passed that eventually
Thx.

Let's stand by for a week at 9,799 then  :)
Just wanna watch him eat his foot. It can even go to zero after. Don't care. What a pompous piece of shit
Where is he, btw? I forgot to bookmark his profile. Is he still active?
This 
I am not TA expert, but if BTC crosses 10k now, it might jump to 11k very soon
But what about once it hits 19.8k?
Okay I marked your words. And when you are wrong what will happen?
Alts follow bitcoin most of the time so you're ok
10k for the weekend starting to look possible 
Uuuuupwards!
do it
May is the bitcoin love time \^\^
Yes she is! 
Over my dead body
No, I like profit.
You have to sign up on a Cryptocurrency exchange to purchase some bitcoin. You transfer fiat currency and can buy any fraction of one bitcoin there. Then you buy a hardware wallet and load the bitcoin onto the wallet. Then you put the hardware wallet in a safe place until your son is ready for his first lambo.
If it’s just for your son to follow you could just start a portfolio on coinhodler. That way you just add what you want to be his...for example if u have 1 btc Nd u want to give him 0.5 just add 0.5 to coinhodler but it’s actually in ur wallet. Explained my point pretty shit but I hope u get what I mean.
What type of account?

Exchange account? - used to transfer money from bank account to buy/sell bitcoin?

Bitcoin Wallet? - used to store you bitcoins off of the exchange, similar to a bank account.


You need both really.

I would suggest coinbase for the Exchange as it is so easy to use.

As for bitcoin wallet, I would suggest getting a hardware wallet such as a Ledger, as you want to securely store your bitcoin for many years until your son is old enough.
If it’s under $100 you are fine leaving it on coinbase. When it becomes substantial consider moving it to a paper or hardware wallet 
The price has shown to increase on paydays. Could you elaborate how May 4th will have any effect?
Wat.  8k?  Hm.  Good analysis.
Think we'll go below 9k one more time within the next few days? Don't know if I should buy now or wait.
What are your favorite crypto podcasts?
Yesterday? That was ages ago.
"Slow". "Healthy".
Something poked BTC with a stick and it moved a bit.
You can get them on Amazon.
I LIKE BIG PUMP AND I CANNOT LIE
Yeah I woke up and saw the charts, FOMOed so hard.  Gone up a good stretch since then!
Can you tell me why they claim "Sell" for the coming week? 
You are supposed to buy more before you get back to even to lower your cost basis and get back to even faster. Congrats on your milestone, I still got ways to go but not too worried about it, in fact hoping for slow rise so I can buy even more cheap btc
Congrats! I'm 4% out. So close!
Grats! I should be there soon myself. 
What did the flyer say?
Asking him OUT? like girls? actual girls?
Bet.
Japan won’t likely do anything since this week is Golden Week here and everyone is on vacation and traveling. A return to norms from us will happen Monday. 
uppity wuppity
It is pinned. Check to see if you're browsing in /new.

once i finish drinking it i'll check the leaves.  
  edit: my tea bag didn't break that's very bullish
I took the FOMO route this morning.  Bye bye paycheck.
IMO you should take it as mostly positive. Not many realize the big shift that will happen \(i.e. when some fiat will be hit by huge inflation and some other fiat will be corroded by bad state and bank finances\).
Why should it?
In the case of Mr Ver, it is a poorly defined political label that enables him to do as he pleases without feeling any shame.  

It is closely related to libertarianism - the capitalist form of which is close to crypto-anarchy.

Head over to r/btc.  They *ought* to understand what you mean, but are actually thick as shit.
Bitcoin "usually" does well in May.

Equities "usually" lower in May
More like 9999.99 \^\^ but yeah seems so, if it wont change direction xD
I'd say by the time I go to bed tonight is very likely. 
Sadly not. They know that whole market business so well that they see exactly the entry points or using manipulation towards them.
Just from looking at the charts, I'm expecting pretty big rally at some point from now til tomorrow morning USA time.
30% in my country
Well I sold the lot at 1am last night UK time just before I went to bed as there was a huge red dildo

Now sitting here 100% fiat

Wonder if your 12k prediction is still good?

If so that would make this a good time to FOMO back in
“Bitcone” lol
My personal break even point is a very strong resistance... 

I should notify all TA experts of this indicator...
There will be a very hard resistance. 

My break even point is there. I guess that's true for many other people. 

There will be lots of people who want to cash out without a loss.

I will hold, though. I want more than just: no loss.
Even the word, 'Bullish', seems quite bullish to me.

Bullish!
Is it just me, or do others think that the simple fact that “the McAfee Dickline” is an actual thing, has a chance at causing a self-fulfilling prophecy?
I always took the Blue Line to the Loop when I lived in Chicago
You could just buy half now, and half later? 
Right now after this sell off is a good time to buy.
How much money are they willing to lose, and what type of gains are they hoping for?
Wanna know what I think? I think that anything equal or lower than $7k is an excellent buy price. If you still want to buy in at current price, monitor what's gonna be like for the next hours (how much it flirts with 10k).

Do you honestly believe that bitcoin won't EVER again fall to 6k-7k levels? It's more likely for it to happen than it is for it to not happen, bear that in mind.

HOWEVER, with that said, if you plan to just hold long term, any time is a good time (except right after massive rallies) imo.
In a way yes.  Both are increasing the money supply.  However, bitcoin's expansion is pre-determined, rule-based, can't be abused and will eventually stop.  Whereas QE is used as a tool to cover-up fiscal mis-management, exploding government debts, bail out the banking system etc, and is potentially unlimited.
The power consumed by the network is independent of the number of users. Regardless if blocks are empty or full the network uses the same amount of power.

Power use is more a function of the price. As price continues to climb we can expect the amount of power used to be approximately equivalent to the amount of Bitcoin mined. 

So if Bitcoin were to reach $1M after the next halving in 2020; thats 900 coins mined per day ; Slightly less than $900Million of electric consumption per day.




Cool.  Candlelight is so romantic.
Its impossible to use more than 100% of all electricity. Also: no. It will probably use a shit ton, but it could also run on hardly anything. It can also displace electricity elsewhere. There are too many factors to say anything definite about it other than that it will probably be a lot.

Is that a problem? I dont think so. Supoly and demand.
Let me answer your question with another question: does that sound realistic to you?   
Mining operations in Iceland get a completely free and unlimited supply of electricity. Problem solved
Bitcoin doesn’t require any specific amount of electricity. The amount it burns is based on the number of people who choose to mine it. The number doesn’t make transactions any quicker. No matter how big bitcoin gets there will never be a minimum hash power required. 
Unspent transaction outputs - basically bits of bitcoin of various sizes, which can be spent by those who own them.  The amount of them doesn't really matter, and nothing to be particularly bothered about, it's just how bitcoin works.  


If you want to transfer 1 bitcoin to someone else, you could use a utxo that you own (larger than 1 bitcoin) as the input for the transaction.  Say the utxo is 10 btc in size.  That's the input that then becomes spent, an you'll receive a 9 btc utxo as change.


Wallets take care of all this automatically.

Disclaimer:  I'm not an expert on this.

utxos are created by transactions, they are "coins" waiting to be spent in another transaction. So, basically: coins.
It's touching 9.6 quite vigorously now
No, €8,1k!
Nothing tied to goldman is good news. 
A nice run has been initiated, it'll require some patience to settle above 10.5k. I'm eager for the rally afterwards to finally pierce that 12k barrier.
Everything must come to and end. But it was fun! Let's do it again sometime...
This makes sense, while bitcoin has been range bound a lot of alts have been rocketing higher yet BTC stayed still. Seems like a rotation of money across asset classes. I think we will see this happen often going forward. When BTC is stable money tends to go into the alts and when they get over stretched they often sell and convert back to BTC.
Namasteji. Tike?
Americans are cheap.

But seriously: On the other day I saw something like that, too. Usually, arbitage traders should take care of that. Maybe one important trader went out of business?
Different volume, different buyers and sellers. I have seen coinmarket cap at over 200 
AC in BTC out
Buttcorn mining
Preparing for a surprise. 
Buy, never sell.  JMO.
Right now it's more about verifying the whole blockchain - limited by memory and drive I/O. Bigger blocks won't help and they won't be a thing with 5G.
All my models say that USA will be pretty happy when they wake up tomorrow
[deleted]
Just imagine it like a sling shot. Bitcoin is creating tension - GO!
The second we're back to FOMO, that's when altcoins are gonna spring back to life, and take another chunk out of Bitcoin's market cap again. It's what happens at every cycle. 
No. Only hodl, buy, or spend BTC at vendors directly. Cash out and miss moon.
But I already cash out... I'm all out of fiat
What makes you say that? 

From a 'noob' I really would appreciate your input 
You are consistant. I'll give you that.

Reported anyway, for "repetitive content".
me too

Compared to what? to USD it is up 4.4%..

The lambo reference are beyond cliche now.
You won't really feel 5% on a Burrito. 
Think you're missing the point. People do have to use Bitcoin as money for it to have any value at all. Otherwise it's just clever math. 
Truthfully. I’m not sure how it all works but from the looks of it all you can do is buy. There is no transferring out like a wallet. I was going to transfer in some from my own funds but it doesn’t look like you can do that yet. 
It's a psychological barrier so bulls tend to get trigger happy if those are breached
depends if it breaks it
apology for bad english

where you were when btc breaks 20k?

'at home, email calls'

'buy the peak.' 

'Hodl bag until sell at 6k'

'buy back at 9k'

'moon, please?'


He is spot on. 
by friday
Maybe later tonight.
Zim/Zer is Bitcoin's preferred pronoun.  
yeah but I am talking $50, not $5000, not sure I need to invest in a hard wallet just yet.
Swissian you’re such a nerd dude. First lambo? Can you make me cringe any more?
cool i'll check
At least use gdax if you're going to coinbase. They are the same company but the fees on gdax are much cheaper. 
can i do coinbase if I already have an account?
May 4th is payday.
There's been a lot of oscillation so if the price stagnates and doesn't go into the high 9Ks or even past 10k within the next few days, then there's a good chance we can briefly revisit the high 8Ks. Why not split your chances, buy half now, and wait and see if you can buy the rest if it goes down. If it doesn't go down, you still bought some in the low 9Ks before it got higher.
Now is the time.
#bullish!
Butt pumps
Hmmm what makes you think it shows the coming week? 
I should specify. I buy almost every Thursday... I just happened to break even on this one. 
I am almost there. Just need to recover transfer fees, exchange rates etc now.

I was actually. Its back to the front page now.
with their 12% mining fee coin burning - which in itself might be a lie to pump the price.
thank you for an actual answer! Would you mind elaborating? Do you think these entities are partaking in insider trading of some form?
Good for tea.  Good for Bitcoin.
Actually "crypto-anarchism" started it all. Please don't attribute it to Bcash...

"Bitcoin is a currency generated and secured by peer-to-peer networked devices that maintain a communal record of all transactions within the system that can be used in a crypto-anarchic context. The idea behind bitcoin can be traced to The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto."


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto-anarchism
I think you are wrong. 

Do you know that Bitcoin was created in response to the subprime crisis?

Do you know what triggered that crisis? Banks fomo-ing.
Moves like these should pull back. It's very common for it to break out, go back to support and then go. It broke out at $9,260, peaked at $9.9k should have pulled back to $9.2k and then go to $12k.

None of that has happened so far.  So everybody and their dog knows we've broken through.  $12k is a week away if it is even that slow.

It's just my opinion, not trading advice.  I've loaded up to my eyebrows. I bought everything I could afford on that down move 2 days ago.

I think we're going to see big bars soon. We're not going to $10k tonight, we're going well past.  Just my opinion.
Yes maybe it is very hard to break the 10k walls but if it will break it will moon and will not stop
#Bullish!
Doubt it will ever get that low again. This rise is all because of people who actually believe in btc and aren't in it to make quick buck, once btc hits mainstream again that's when you really need to be careful, as for now, I'd say you should buy, don't see it getting below 9k again, that's the new support floor, there will be long period of Bart at around 10k, but if you are in it for long haul still good time to buy
>and will eventually stop.

Maybe. Maybe the rules change.
Thanks for the response
In peer-to-peer model it's wrong. More users mean more power consume... 
I agree, this does not seem possible.
so how many utxos does satoshis stack represent
I actually never saw it touch 9.6. Went straight from 9.59 to 9.7 when I refreshed.
It's good news. They're helping to dig their own grave.
I agree with that, although some people have a phycological thing with legitimacy and the instituations they are used to.  I could imagine some baby boomers thinking that news is a green light.  But you know, maybe btc is just doing its damn thing. 
For sure but doesn't cashing out into fiat imply a drop? Seems to be holding up ok so far. Good news for those who want a higher price.
How about the bitcoin vision? Are speculation/trading and mass adoption compatible or even desirable? Sorry, i missed the first 10 years, trying to catch up :) eg Familly member in South Africa earns in local currency roughly 12.5 to the $1... imagine the scope of those price variations in countries with comparatively low incomes? Daily, weekly, even monthly salary value price swings in a day, wow. Mass adoption... really? Or are we only talking about the west? 
Well said, buddy.
Respect.
Eeeeeww!😷
Not even to short??
Your models look too busy walking down the runway
Great response my good lad. Very much appreciate the feedback. 😄
Good boi
Things rarely go up like this without a correction afterwards.

Edit. There you have it.
You're always saying that :)
$010000?
Or he wants to accumulate more before it gets manipulated by those market crashers
Find where I said it, bro. I'll wait.
There we go.
In lambo we trust.
Can never have enough Lambo. 
I funnel some of my day trade profits to a wallet I use for everyday purchases so my btc wallet is meant to be spent on items, I am happy to support the use of bitcoin by making purchases I would normally make with fiat. My goal is to completely get away from using fiat. That's the whole purpose of this, isn't it!! 
Bitcoin has value because it has hodlers not spenders. 
It will go. 
Did you just ASSUME bitcoins preferred pronoun? Bigot
He's addressing a cold storage. A piece of paper would be a start, a engraved steel plate a safe long enduring and therefore better start.
if you already have a bank account?
What if I told you theres multiple paydays in a month?
May the Fifth Go With You.
Will do, thank you.
Typical.

Agreed.  

But there are sides to anarchy/libertarianism.  

Some are extreme left, some extreme right.  e.g.  

Far left: it belongs to everyone, so I will steal it.  

Far right: it belongs to no-one, so I will steal it!  

I suspect Bcash falls into the extreme right - a capitalist form - although Ver's followers are probably not aware of that.

*Edit: Note that all anarchists call the police when someone steals their own shit.*
They won't FOMO when they are in fear of losing everything. They try to manipulate instead.
Ok pondering whether to load up now

Edit: might wait to see if it drops to the high 7's first (euros)

So just to clarify, when was early-mid week this week?
#bullish!
> it will moon and will not stop

What makes you think this? 

#bullish
^^Bullish.
I tend to agree , excluding the possibility that negative press / exchange hack etc happens to occur which would cause short term FUD. But hey I wouldn't be opposed to buying some more at those levels!
If everyone agrees. I think it would be difficult convincing everyone to accept continuous inflation. 
Please elaborate...

The power consumed by a wallet sending and receiving transactions are trivial compared to the power used by miners finding blocks. The power used by miners finding blocks is independent of the number of users in the system and is a function of the block reward.
think of satoshis like atoms (created with an special transaction, called coinbase transaction, out of thin air with every block) and utxos are coins made with those atoms. utxos are 'melted' (consumed, aka spent) by transactions that transform them to create new utxos (coins) of different sizes.
Well when you put it like that, it's good news. 
There is no one Bitcoin vision. It is decentralized. And no drop because Bitcoin must be bought before it is sold for fiat. So Bitcoin goes sideways when that happens.
Look, I'm a hodler, that is my approach.  It is simple and lazy.

But shorting a commodity than randomly goes up and down looks like 50:50 gambling to me.
you can but its of course risky, hodling seems to be the way to go
no $10000.0
He has to accumulate more to compensate for his lost pee pee. 
5% up for the last 24 hours, there you go. 
You're the man!
Purchases you normally make with fiat? Like what? My normal purchases don't take crypto, anywhere. 
I am offended.

I do not plan to contribute anything else to this conversation.  I just want to state that I am offended and that you should feel bad for offending me.  
Sorry, I have an account on coinbase and gdax, but would like to have a second account to show him how to follow the market.
What if I told you the price of bitcoin can rise on more than one day a month?
Your signature might give you up if you post there. :\) Cudos to your opinion on bchash!
Bippity boppity boo!
Surprise!
Monday To Wednesday. So I was out a little. Still knew exactly what was going to happen. Breakout was Thursday. Out by a day. Depending on time zone actually.

I'm just wondering why people who can't make calls criticise  people who do make quite accurate calls ? Seems to be fashionable over here. Bit of group hysteria. Maybe that's why I don't see other competent traders here. They just go away.

In all fairness it is a Bitcoin reddit, not a trading reddit, but the two go hand\-in\-hand. You can't do one without the other. I'd think the group would like to encourage people with technical skills, not chase them away, 
Nothing really, but $10K is a psychological barrier. Once a barrier is broken, people look to the next one. People are strange.
#Imagine a bull..

#Now imagine something even more BULLISH

(heh - got you, now follow that with something more bullish..)
yes I think it will be a bullish especially right now traders are very positive in this community and the widespread adaptations of different coins in the market
If btc becomes the world currency and 1% of the worlds population own 99% of btc, you seriously think the 99% won’t outvote the 1%?
Have you any metric to provide? Please elaborate. 
no i mean how many utxos does satoshis 1 million btc represent. are his unused coins 1 big utxo or a bunch
Righty o then... an object of pure speculation. Fair enough :)
Lol ;-) sorry, MAN
I'd use your own coinbase account, buy the crypto you want, and then transfer to your own bitcoin wallet.
Accounts have to be verified, so I'm not sure they would allow an 11-year-old to set one up. He can follow the market on coinmarketcap.com. Why does he need a Coinbase account? What do you want him to do with it? Is he going to be trading?
>I'm just wondering why people who can't make calls criticise people who do make quite accurate calls ?

Bitcoin ain't over 10k yet.
I don't think you know what "exactly" means. 
Bullish x 2 
Bull-esque?
BtcULLISH
Minotaur.
I agree. The FOMO is yet to come, I think it will kick in after we cross 10k. That will be quite a show. 
To create an inflationary bitcoin you would have to hard fork it. The 99% of people who didn't agree with the move would stay with the original chain, while the rich 1% would have no one left to take money off of through their inflating coin, defeating the purpose. 
Bitcoin isn't a democracy it's a Nash Equilibrium. You would need to disrupt the equilibrium by messing with the incentives of miners and node runners to convince them to start inflating the currency. As is everyone is getting too good a deal and the risks are too great to change. Even if 99% of users got angry and left, unless they took the entire economic market for Bitcoin with them (technically even if machines were the only ones using Bitcoin it would still be valuable) the incentives to mine Bitcoin would still exist.
1 utxo can have any amount of satoshis, it's like a container. when you create a transaction the wallet selects which utxos is going to use as inputs and you create new utxos.  take a look at bitcoin.org
"Sorry, *person*" is what you meant.  Just because I have a penis and my name is "Mr" Evil Guy doesn't mean you can assume my gender.
i like that option
no I would be managing it but I would like him to be able to see the progress of the price.
C'mon man. I wouldn't be surprised to see $11k today.  And if that happens then my next set of targets for $12k is also out and has some major implications for May. Have you even thought about that ? Or you just going to sit there and take swipes at the guy doing shit you can't do ? 
Always a possibility. 
Shit.
yeah. I agree with you and waiting to happen. Hud'lers will be very happy with that if happened
I know I'm sorry, it's just hard to keep up these days
Of course not. You are clearly a female-presenting polyamorous bisexual snowflake. Cisgenders are so ignorant..
In that case, he can follow the price on a graph on any one of a number of internet sites like coinmarketcap.com. Even yahoo has a graph for Bitcoin: https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/BTC-USD?p=BTC-USD#eyJpbnRlcnZhbCI6MSwicGVyaW9kaWNpdHkiOjEsInRpbWVVbml0IjoibWludXRlIiwiY2FuZGxlV2lkdGgiOjgsInZvbHVtZVVuZGVybGF5Ijp0cnVlLCJhZGoiOnRydWUsImNyb3NzaGFpciI6dHJ1ZSwiY2hhcnRUeXBlIjoibGluZSIsImV4dGVuZGVkIjpmYWxzZSwibWFya2V0U2Vzc2lvbnMiOnt9LCJhZ2dyZWdhdGlvblR5cGUiOiJvaGxjIiwiY2hhcnRTY2FsZSI6ImxpbmVhciIsInBhbmVscyI6eyJjaGFydCI6eyJwZXJjZW50IjoxLCJkaXNwbGF5IjoiQlRDLVVTRCIsImNoYXJ0TmFtZSI6ImNoYXJ0IiwidG9wIjowfX0sInNldFNwYW4iOnt9LCJsaW5lV2lkdGgiOjIsInN0cmlwZWRCYWNrZ3JvdWQiOnRydWUsImV2ZW50cyI6dHJ1ZSwiY29sb3IiOiIjMDA4MWYyIiwiY3VzdG9tUmFuZ2UiOm51bGwsInN5bWJvbHMiOlt7InN5bWJvbCI6IkJUQy1VU0QiLCJzeW1ib2xPYmplY3QiOnsic3ltYm9sIjoiQlRDLVVTRCJ9LCJwZXJpb2RpY2l0eSI6MSwiaW50ZXJ2YWwiOjEsInRpbWVVbml0IjoibWludXRlIiwic2V0U3BhbiI6e319XSwic3R1ZGllcyI6eyJ2b2wgdW5kciI6eyJ0eXBlIjoidm9sIHVuZHIiLCJpbnB1dHMiOnsiaWQiOiJ2b2wgdW5kciIsImRpc3BsYXkiOiJ2b2wgdW5kciJ9LCJvdXRwdXRzIjp7IlVwIFZvbHVtZSI6IiMwMGIwNjEiLCJEb3duIFZvbHVtZSI6IiNGRjMzM0EifSwicGFuZWwiOiJjaGFydCIsInBhcmFtZXRlcnMiOnsiaGVpZ2h0UGVyY2VudGFnZSI6MC4yNSwid2lkdGhGYWN0b3IiOjAuNDUsImNoYXJ0TmFtZSI6ImNoYXJ0In19fX0%3D
You're still counting chickens well before they hatch, my dude.
No I'm not. I'm up thousands of dollars on my call already. My chickens have hatched, I saw it for what it was early, I said so publicly, I took the trade and I'm laughing my head off. My chickens are about to have chickens.
Here comes those brand new chickens...
How many hours until the price is over 10k?
12 maybe 24. Should have been over already, got damn close twice. $10k won't last long. It doesn't matter anymore. 
It matters for your credibility, Mr I-haven't-been-wrong-since-Easter.
I haven't. Who cares if it's a bit late. $10k doesn't even matter. Only thing that natters is how long it takes to get to $12k.. That's the next determining factor of consequence. 
>Who cares if it's a bit late.

You were wrong. Admit it and you'll be much happier.
Lol \- I don't see how a whole pile of extra profit makes me wrong. NAV's well up mate. And that's all that counts.

If we were at $8k I'd say ok I got that wrong.  But we're a whisker away from $10k and it's likely to go this week\-end. So ja. I'll count the money and you can have nice cup of STFU.

If we don't make $12k I'll also be wrong. 
>I don't see how a whole pile of extra profit makes me wrong.

Profit doesn't come into it. You said that we'd be at a price point at a specific point in time. We weren't. You were wrong.
I'll be wrong when I take a loss. Hasn't happened yet this year. Well actually, Jpy gave me a hiding this year, but the Crypto's have already covered that. 
>I'll be wrong when I take a loss.

You can't just make up your own definitions for words, bub. You were wrong.
Why don't you worry a bit more about your shit and less about mine. My account is busy apeshit, mainly because I took the correct positions again at exactly the right time. Again. I don't give a rats arse what you think. 
>Why don't you worry a bit more about your shit and less about mine.

As long as you don't tout your "perfect" record again, we won't have any trouble.
At $12k I will double my account for the second time this year. I think that's perfect. I don't care what a chihuahua has to say about my calls. 
>I think that's perfect.

Except for the part where you were wrong.
Wasn't wrong. We're at $10k. Going to $12k. NAV says I nailed it. All that counts. 
>We're at $10k.

Incorrect. We are demonstrably *not* at $10k. We might be in the future.
Battle for $10k was over Thursday already. 
At no point on Thursday were we at $10k.
Lol \- astounding powers of observation. 
I'm not the one who said this approximately a week ago:

>$10k next 24 hours, maybe even $11k

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8fah9t/daily_discussion_april_27_2018/dy3w4g9/

"We're nearly at 10k so I wasn't wrong about being at 10k."

This is you. This is your record.
Yeah. And we're still there. 2&#37; off. Not at $8k. Would have liked it to happen a bit quicker, but still at $10k no matter how you farking look at it. 
Almost only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades. This ain't 10k.
I actually can't respond to that without directly insulting your intelligence, which I won't resort to.  I think I'll just go drink a beer while I wait for the other $200 to appear. 
Mhmm.

If you buy 100 six packs and you receive 98 of them, do you have 100 six packs?

No.

No, you do not.
Unless they're on back order because the supplier ran out and will be delivered a bit later today. Might not have 100 of them, but the other 2 will pitch up like they have been for the last 10 years I've been ordering beer.
You might take receipt of them later today, but do you have them? No.
The beer always comes. You are hopelessly over complicating life. 
I don't see how "is the thing physically in front of you or not" is more complex than invoking a supply chain to say that the thing which is not in front of you is in front of you, but okay.
Well, you sit there and worry about $10k, that stopped being relevant days ago. But still you cling to it. Where's my 2 six packs ? In the truck man, on it's way.  With the rest of the new order for next week.

The only thing that matters now is how quickly $12k comes up. $11k is as irrelevant  as $10k. But I'll put money on it you're going to freak out about that as well.
