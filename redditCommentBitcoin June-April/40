Calling any mods - Can you please make the 'Daily Discussion' thread a sticky. -- TITLE
Doesn't it get stickied every time?
There are only 2 available stickies. Daily discussion is a catch-all for quality lowering discussion and memes. Usually it is worth it to allot half of our precious sticky resources to. Sometimes there is enough quality raising discussion that we can put some of the best of at the top and let the daily discussion fend for itself. 

There is a reason the daily discussion never has enough upvotes to be on the front page on its own accord.

Disclaimer I am not a mod and do not speak for them
It used to but the last 2 days it has not been. 
Huh, thought I saw one yesterday.  

On a related note, a while ago I proposed to the mods to have a "beginner's question" thread... Although there is one every monday (mentor thread), perhaps we could use one daily, or at least sticky the mentor one... Or add something like "beginner's questions" to the title of "daily discussions" one.  

I feel this would encourage newbies to ask their questions more, and also in one place, instead of opening new threads that won't reach the frontpage. 
Good idea.
