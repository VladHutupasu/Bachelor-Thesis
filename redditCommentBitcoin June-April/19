Daily Discussion, May 15, 2018 -- TITLE
Meeting Andreas Antonopoulos tonight. Any 'smart' questions I can ask him?
Guess who has thumbs and still isn’t worried

So what is the most important news from Consensus 2018 thus far?
when consensus moon?
Korea FUD over. Upbit cleared of any wrongdoing by audit.

**GoTenna Launches a Bitcoin Wallet That Works Without the Internet**

https://www.coindesk.com/gotenna-bitcoin-wallet-mesh-network/

If James Bond needed to use bitcoin on a secret mission in the jungle, he probably couldn't drop by a Starbucks to use the wifi.

Since internet connections aren't always available, reliable or private, cryptocurrency users need alternative ways to connect to the network. So the New York-based startup goTenna, founded in 2012 by Brazilian siblings Daniela and Jorge Perdomo, is partnering with Samourai Wallet to launch an Android app this summer that allows users to send bitcoin payments without an internet connection.

Announced Monday, the txTenna app will enable users to sync up their mobile with a goTenna device, which costs $179 per pair, then toggle the wallet app's settings to transact offline and send the bitcoin.

"You need to be able to spend your bitcoin even in disaster areas," goTenna engineer Richard Meyers told CoinDesk, citing the Perdomo siblings' recent work in Puerto Rico, where goTenna devices helped people reconnect after Hurricane Maria. "As long as you have a way to charge your phone, you can be up and meshed and communicating."

The signal needs to be within roughly a mile of another goTenna device to relay the message across the mesh network, a decades-old system for using the internet without wifi or a landline. So far, goTenna has sold more than 100,000 devices that let users tap into the mesh network.

If the offline bitcoin user is within a mile of another active device, the transaction could bounce across the mesh until it reaches a user with an internet connection.

"It offers an alternative that is more censorship-resistant," Meyers said, adding:

"It's going to obscure who you are and where you're at when making these transactions. So that's a big privacy advantage there."

This system uses a free, unlicensed radio frequency, and it isn't the first partnership to explore such potential for cryptocurrency networks.

It takes a village
Stepping back, a variety of projects since the Cold War have used relatively cheap and mobile radio setups to broadcast across firewalls and oceans.

Last year, renowned cryptographer Nick Szabo and blockchain engineer Elaine Ou published a proposal detailing how weak-signal radio transmissions could help boost security and the diversity of connections across the bitcoin network.

Then, in December, after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission repealed "net neutrality," fans of ethereum, the world's second most popular blockchain network, started flocking to mesh network technology meetups.

When net neutrality rules expire next month, internet service providers will no longer be barred from favoring or blocking specific websites and communities. It's an opportune moment for censorship-resistant tools for bitcoin transactions.

Perhaps the most important aspect of txTenna is that the cryptocurrency wallet will be an open source project.

Indeed, it was Samourai Wallet's open source communication tools on Github that first inspired goTenna's team to reach out to the bitcoin startup. The same txTenna code could theoretically be applied to iOS wallet applications as well.

As Meyers explained:

"It absolutely could work with any software wallet and they [Samourai Wallet developers] are not writing it specifically for the Samourai wallet anyway. It will be something any wallet provider could send transactions through."
Although not surprised by dips at this point... I’m a little taken aback by it. The timing is odd. I’ve literally read no valid reasons for drops of the 500 in a day nature 
Good morning all.
The last two days I called for an end to sub 9k Bitcoin, I was wrong, what I have actually been meaning to say is that I'll just shut up now. It'll be there soon
Legitimately afraid to go to sleep for fear of what I’ll see when I awake.
The Perfect 1h bart simpson 
I thought Consensus 2018 was supposed to boost the price of BTC. So, why is it faaallllling!!??! Thoughts?
This Consensus hype is boring
Will this be a good week for BTC and overcome the resistance it has in the 9k?
Reminder: Bitcoin has been worth at least $2,000 for about a year. 
We're about 2 months shy of it being worth at least $3,000 for a year. 
The all time low for 2018 was more than 3 months ago. 
If $5,800-$6,000 continues to be the low for 2018... that's a really solid win in my book. 

btc wants to breakout but theres so much resistance. insane. 
My magic 8 ball says we will go above $9k today.
I want to help my uncle be able to set his brick and mortar store front up to accept bitcoin, how do I do it ? 
(Hypothetical) can anyone point me in the right direction for set ups, videos, where to purchase little scanner pos bois, anything related, YouTube videos, anything. I want to learn how people do it cuz if crypto booms this summer I want to start a business called lucky lemons where it’ll be like a Chick-fil-A except it’s just the lemonade and possibly toasted meat and cheese sandwiches.

My other uncle (reality) is running a “factoring receivables” business working with small businesses to pay them money owed to them in xx days - right now, around 95% of it,  (so they can use it to grow now and make more), in exchange for their receivable, 100% of  it.  I can’t think of a way to work crypto into this especially since smart contracts aren’t prevalent at all yet. But I know Reddit is a host to very smart folks.

Thank you to any who reply.
Hey guys, is there any way to establish a connection between a node's ip adress and a btc adress? 
[deleted]
With LN still in beta, is it possible we will see a more comprehensible display of our balance in our wallets that are open on the LN? 

For instance, showing that we have .001 BTC, which is ~$8.55 at the time of this writing, could be hard for someone to comprehend. dealing with small numbers like this is outside the norm for most people who deal in fiat. Granted the franctions of say, $1 USD is easy to comprehend for most. We learn about change transaction (quarters, nickels, etc) in grade school. 

Would it be easier for people to read bitcoin balances on the LN in whole numbers? for instance, the above example would translate into 100,000 satoshi's. Correct? Please forgive me if I'm wrong in this. 
Cowabunga! 
Korea should be waking up soon.  Will they buy more now that the upbit FUD has been dispelled?
good luck guys, I'm going to watch the movie "the matrix", just to rest .....
**Bitcoin Price Eyes Breakout As Trading Range Tightens**

https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-eyes-breakout-as-trading-range-tightens/

Bitcoin (BTC) is stuck in a narrow $550 range between the key long-term moving averages today, but may be prepping for a breakout, the technical charts suggest.

With the bull/bear bias now unclear, the big problem now is trying to work out in which direction the price will go.

As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,760 on Bitfinex, and is trading between the 50-day moving average (MA) at $8,287 and the 100-day moving average at $8,837.

The sell-off from the May 5 high of $9,990 came to halt around the 50-day MA on Saturday. Further, the 50-day MA also acted as strong support on Monday. Meanwhile, on both occasions, the rebound from the 50-day MA ran out of steam around the 100-day MA hurdle.

The rangebound action seen in the last three days has established the 50-day MA as a major support and the 100-day MA as a formidable resistance and the breakout of this zone will likely set the tone for the next big move in BTC.

View

Another rejection at the descending trendline seen in the 4-hour chart will likely yield a drop to 50-day MA located at $8,287.

That said, only a daily close (as per UTC) below the 50-day MA would signal a revival of the sell-off from the recent high of $9,990 and would allow a deeper drop to $7,787 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the April 1 low to the May 5 high) or even as low as $7,698 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the July 2015 low to the December 2017 high).

On the other hand, a convincing move above $8,910 (expanding channel hurdle) would expose resistance lined up at $9,390.
So much for the Consensus Meeting!  :(
I hope the price drop will result in GPU prices going down...they're still 25-50% over MSRP for last year's tech and I need one for normal use. 
Dumpity dump :D 

WE WANT A PUMP NOW!
Bart head almost complete.  Ready for a jump to 8700 within the next 30 minutes.
I love the stability.  Very attractive to large investers easy to produce the jump in the morning. 
Bcash shitfork is imminent - slow market may be due to people seeing what will happen to our lying brethren's coin at that point.

Roger's chinese government coin is confusing the entire cryptomarket imo.

edit: as of now: shitfork in about 1 hour.
No value here, Lots of idiots with stupid questions and statements.
8500 being tested hard the last hour or so

No one knows where btc is going to go but with all the value and infrastructure being poured into the cryptocurrency space UP in the long term seems like a good bet in my book. 
Told you guys. As sure as the sun will rise we will see 7.8k. 
Can someone help me understand what an ideal bitcoin/crypto world would look like? Do people want it to completely replace dollars? If people are trading dollars for bitcoin then someone will always have dollars so how does crypto spread to mass adoption?

Also, isn’t it true that you can have mass adoption without an increase in price? Like if all the whales sold off as adoption increased then supply might equal demand? Thank you for enlightening me!
Closing in on the downtrend line. Now the  market has to decide...
So my Ledger Nano S just arrived, I've set everything up but just realized that my pin screen is different from the picture on their website:
https://www.ledgerwallet.com/images/products/lns/video/pin.png

Mine has 8 digits, but it looks like it should only have 4? I got my nano s from LedgerWallet.com, so it should be legit, right?
These next few days are (unironically) critical for Bitcoin.
Lads, I got a Ledger and am wondering how it works between the exchange and the hardware wallet. When I buy bitcoins at the exchange and I need to transfer them to the wallet, does it go through the network and, as such, is subject to fees and validation time? So if I want to sell quickly, will have to move everything back from the wallet to the exchange and wait for the transaction to be confirmed?
Don’t worry guys, it’s just another Bart on the chart

Edit: Mah boi's tryin out a new hairstyle
proper fight on right now 
Here come all the bot sellers xD
I'd like to discuss how Theymos can eat a dick.
On the down trend until end of June-July guys, look for that low price to jump in on. 
Every $100 it drops means more of your sold bitcoins bought by me.
10k in sight
Shitcoin Cash fork is officially live - enjoy those free coins

(there are none :)

Effect on all prices?  Let's see what the lying Chinese govt coin's shitfork does to markets and itself.
For a moment sit back and admire one thing:

We are witnessing the growing up of the first pure internet money and truly global decentralized currency. 

This is historic. This is science fiction become reality. You are part of history. 
Bitcoin just took a very sickly shit.
[deleted]
https://reddit.app.link/oiwKlLiUWM
Is there a way to see OTC orders? I feel like all these large firms and family businesses are loading up on cheap Bitcoin lately, just want a confirmation if that's available somewhere.
Fuck, hold on boys, let's not break $8000.

Nobody reads or gives a shit about his daily thread.
Lower. Told you. :)
I hope it hits like 6k again. Can't wait to buy more
Going down to 7K levels for sure. Will it bounce again? Maybe but my guess it goes down to 5-6K. 
BTC tx are slow as hell right now. I paid the equivalent of $15 and its been an hour. Nothing
Take my word for it,  this is  a VERY bad sign to crash hard in the middle of a hype fest like Consensus.  Word is getting around,  the jig is almost up.  
Love these massive red dildos.
I love how everyone freaks out when I knew all along this was going to happen. We needed to have a correction, I think the upbit news just triggered it early.  In the long run this will be healthy for bitcoin as long as we don't fall much past 7250. 7800 and 7250 are the prices this could reverse, so those are both great places to buy.
Buttcoin sucks.
I'll never forget how I got my first whiff that the Internet stock explosion was a bubble.  It was at a conference in San Jose in 2000 for Weblogic App server.  In several groups over two days you'd hear people say things like 'most dot coms aren't thriving',  'some of the dot coms are already thinking of throwing in the towel'.  It takes the industry leaders/insiders getting together to really start seeing what's happening,  besides the 'price'.


I feel like we’re gonna see a bgd any second. 

Edit:  we are due for a completion of a reverse Bart on the 1 hour chart 


Edit:  nevermind got a brd instead. My gut has betrayed me tonight. 
I'm rich making $15hr in the bay area with all the these sell thank you! This is why I never went to college
Well, reckon I should have sold at 9900, damn vacations.  With that said, I refuse to sell until it's atleast back at 9k.  To all of you other folks panic selling, have fun taking the losses.

Edit: for those of you HOPING that bitcoin crashes, you're working against bitcoin.  You wont see adoption from businesses until it's somewhat stable.  As a business owner, drops like these hurt pretty badly if I'm not exchanging for fiat on a regular basis.
[removed]
Bulls are pushing it for a few days now because of Cons 2018, but they don't have the strength to lift it. Down force is to heavy. Bears will take control again! Market needs to cool down before "big money" players dare to step in.

Ask him to do an AMA here on reddit, plz
Try getting him with the updog joke
When moon
naw, just keep posting that you are meeting him and show him all the threads.
[Ask him if he's seen this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNmRZsBKdq8)
Ask him how small businesses can start accepting bitcoin 
Apparently they decided to re-spell it "Consensus 2018" :)
That it's started? 
Bitcoin is still the new Bitcoin?
> 2018

+1
I looked on the schedule that there is a blockchain phone coming out, very interesting if you ask me.
This was intentional. Whenever bitcoin looks to break out, FUD relating to an exchange, regulation, or scam comes out. It’s so obvious yet people panick and sell every time.
so charge an extra $180 to use it. wow, and people complain about fiat fees.
Dude, just look at the price history.  Drops of 500 and increases of 500 a day are very common.

Don't even try to rationalise the reason because usually there isn't one.  It's all based on sentiments and speculations.

[deleted]
Wouldn't it be funny if suddenly, the price was to drop below 6k? :) Don't we all want cheap coins ?
Man, I feel exactly the same.  
Why do you think it would boost the price? 
It’s Tuesday 
In the past few years the price of bitcoin has never rised in correlation with the Consensus, this was all people trying to hype other people into buying.
What’s happening at the consensus? 
You think too short term...
You mean you have been reading BS from Tom Lee?

https://btcmanager.com/tom-lee-assumes-consensus-2018-will-push-bitcoin-price-to-all-time-high/

Nothing but tokens and blockchain technology hype. Snakeoil shitcoinsensus 2018. 
Bitcoin has just answered your question
I'll be honest with you - it is now absolutely impossible to tell.

Hang on to your BTC tho., it has never let me down.
At this pace we will be trying to test the resistance at 8k again shortly.
[deleted]
*"if"*
The weak hands are too strong. So much irony in that sentence...
It depends, the price is currently scraping the top of this downtrend channel. So either it breaks out or it dumps hard today.
Your magic 8 ball failed...
Better not tell you now
create a wallet , receive funds
Get a domain, then put the IP in the A field, and a couple of TXT fields, one with something like "BTC receive address: aaaaaaaaaa..." and one with something like "BTC Node IP in A record"

But whoever is looking would need to know you put useful information in the txt field. There's no standard for this with bitcoin afaik, but DNS is used like this for things like DMARC. 
been ready for a month!
Doesn't work like that...
I’ve been waiting for Korea to pump for a while now....
ayyy so was i
A moment of silence for the large number of words that have been abused here, just to say the price might go up or down... 
The previous years took a month to pump after Consensus.
It’s Tuesday 
its not instant... can take weeks for effect.... and i guess whales like to get richer too??  they must let it fly sometime
Right I'm thinking of building a new desktop
Then go see Mario
Still under 8500. Bummer. I was ready for lambo.
Yes.  Support around 8.5 seems extremely solid.
Welcome to the club
Thank you for contributing.
Why don't you add something then!?
And a few people complaining.
btw I know nothing
Exactly, I believe this is the mindset of winners in this space.
It's been hours since the sun rose.
What did you win 
Everyone has differing ideas of the ideal state of future affairs. For me ending central banks and limiting power of governments is the objective. The dollar may never completely die but will lose relevancy in global finance.

The whales only have a finite amount to sell off, and in the case of global adoption, why would they want to sell all? If bitcoin reaches global adoption you will be able to use it to purchase goods and services anywhere. If its globally mass adopted people will readily accept it as people accept cash today. Even if whales sold everything they would eventually run out and the price would have to adjust . It would take a concerted and costly effort to keep the price down in face of overwhelming demand. That isn't to say that mass adoption is guaranteed,  but if it happens it is hard to imagine bitcoins not being worth millions each. 
Adoption won't happen if we keep saying "Bitcoin accepted" and it's just the dolar exchange as Bitcoin this is $10 or the equivalent at the moment in bitcoin. That's just bullshit. 

Adoption will happen when you say "Bitcoin Accepted" and the price is 0.001BTC, I don't care if the price of BTC is at $10k or $100K is going up or down, the price of this thing is in bitcoin. That's accepting Bitcoin not working with the exchange. 
To me the ideal bitcoin world would be where Bitcoin is a digital store of value, and lightning is robust. I'd also like to see bitcoin as a universal gift\-card, where you could pay partial balances for online goods, and the rest with a credit card or bank transfer. I would rather not see fiat replaced by bitcoin at this point \(It's too easy to lose\), rather, I'd like to see bitcoin truly become regarded as digital gold.
Behold! The Market has decided!
Just, ok, I'll play along, when is the market not deciding?
The minimum it will allow you to set is 4, but you can set up to 8. In their demo they probably just used 4 for expediency. 
Make sure everything is ok before you put any crypto on it.
Yes mine has 8 also
It’s the new version. Don’t worry.
Yes to everything you've said
I just keep hodl currency on the Ledger for peace of mind and a bit on the exchanges to trade.
Bit risky keeping them on exchanges but you can miss oppurtunities sometimes.
Who is Theymos?  He owns/controlls one of the most popular bitcoin forums.

Who is he?
what kind of optics are you using? 
Nothing will happen. It will be just another crypto like any other, subject to the market scrutiny. The same happened with Bitcoin Gold.
satoshitting all over the place
Me too this morning!  Now to the moon!
disappeared .. what was it?
OTC is between parties and isn't public, i have seen OTC trades on stocks that expire after 30 and 40 years

why do you feel that they are loading up? 

not by looking at the price i hope because that would mean you have your monitor upside down
Oh I'm hodling ;) 
I like to read it, so that's not true. 
You had only 50&#37; chances of being wrong.
yeah we broke the resistance that held us up for the last 5 days. Now it is probably going to accelerate to the downside with short term target at 7500.
It will. Don’t worry.
No, it wont. From where do you take your informations? Do you have any charts or you just shittalk?
0,39 Cent normal fee on Trezor right now. for next block, absolute overpaying 0,71 cent. 

Better get a new wallet dude... you gettin fucked.

stop valuing it in $'s otherwise go back to fiat.
Messages like yours spread fear, uncertainty and doubt. If only there was some sort of term for this... 
bears need to go hibernation or get REKT
I think we'll see the lows today. They're either already in or at 7800.

Then hopefully I can get busy working the longs again from tomorrow. My wife eats like a horse, need the moneys...
Ok, so what is your point? 
So you’re at that consensus get together and hearing the same stuff or what 
What’s BGD?
TA works?
So, how much have you lost so far?
Understanding your banter would be much more interesting if you’re grammar had went to college. 
>Edit: for those of you HOPING that bitcoin crashes, you're working against bitcoin.

hey HEY... no one said we wer hoping for anything!  I just want my take-profits to fill as I jump back into the trading  rat-race
You know nothing
I don't take anything seriously from redditors who made their account a week ago.
Great guess man. Really imaginative 
really?
What's updog?
This.  I've been waiting for weeks.  Need lambo asap. 
I object to this!
Thanks, I'm an idiot!

About double the price of a ledger and you can't spend shit without a computer connected to it.
Bring it on!
Although it'd be nice to get another sale on all coins but after the last 2 6k scenarios I don't have enough expendable fiat for another fire sale. Lol. 
Marketing?
the youtubers sed so
What I mean by that is it’s a 3 day event during “Blockchain week”. Plenty of pump time a-comin 
Well in the meantime, it appears to have had the opposite effect. If this drops below 7800, I'm using my kid's college fund to buy more. This low drop will bounce hard back into the high 9k's by the end of next week. Mark this post. 
Going down fast lads, cheap coins everywhere
Maybe this market needs a reset - there is too much shit going on.  

Even the main figures at Cons 2018 have repeatedly referred to it in interviews - the continual hype, the scams and rip-off coins.

Let's have that battle - if the price suffers a little temporarily, so be it.
I'm sure trading view has that feature. However,  not talking about moving averages. 
There is "ifs" in everything in life. Sometimes you got to risk it. 
Hard to see it dumping again with consensus on at minute? 
It is certain
Yep, I'm getting rid of my magic 8 ball. 
I was waiting for you to show up :) 
Yea but isn’t there little scanner devices or something and software that will immediately sell the crypto back
To your business bank account so you don’t have an accounting nightmare with btc fluctuations 
Don’t call me Korea.
OK well that makes me feel a lot better to be fair.
The average person buying and selling almost certainly isn't paying attention to or understanding the kind of stuff talked about at conferences about the tech side of things. Most people on big exchanges barely understand how bitcoin works even at an abstract level, never mind the actual technical underpinnings.
Almost Wednesday my dudes
We should have been above $10k this week.  
I still have a 6 year old Sandy Bridge desktop that was upgraded with an SSD a while ago so it's still plenty fast for me but my old GPU just died over the weekend and I've been debating about getting a low end RX560 and waiting for prices to settle and upgrading in a year or two or getting the Mid-range RX580 (I like Radeon) right now.  Or just wait until prices come down and not play any games and go to the gym instead lol. 
John Snow, is that you??
Cheaper bitcoin.
If bitcoin were to become stable then the price of goods in bitcoin would have the same affect. The reason why you differentiate dollars from bitcoin at this point is due to the relative stability of the dollar's value. The dollar does change in value, and goods change in cost, but at a much slower rate than bitcoin, a rate that you don't really notice from day to day unless there is a time of crisis, like when the euro crashed to nearly dollar parity recently. 
I’m not surprised, but I was hoping for a surprise.
I'll try to explain. Of course the market is always deciding. But there are situations when two trends collide. 

In this case it was a short term upward trend and a longer term downward trend. At those crossings you usually find extreme price actions.

Look at the image. I did make the post at the blue arrow. The price was in an uptrend and it was meeting an older downtrend. It could have decided to break through this downtrend. 

If that had happened, many traders would have jumped in, after the confirmation, to push the price even higher.

In this case the downtrend won, after the confirmation, many traders sold. Pushing the price further down.

I set it up once, and purposely entered the wrong pin 3 times to set it up again. Is that the way to do it? Maybe I was just paranoid, but there was a tiny smudge on the instruction manual, so I was playing it safe.
That's what I wanted to hear. Thanks, man.
Take your pills m8
Really powerful telescope haha.
It is the 4th largest crypto mate - deserve it or not - with a leadership out to destroy BTC.  I wouldn't dismiss it so casually.
It's what happens when whalers eat too much... They take a dump...
wish you could see it...
If you read or listen to recent interviews with Ari Paul, he says there has been tremendous interest from institutions and family businesses. Few are buying regularly and they're signing new large clients frequently. I know it's counter-intuitive, but maybe there are larger holders who are unloading and keeping the price relatively low to have these larger clients feel like they're buying low.

Also, articles like these prove that the top 1% are buying https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-09/bunkers-for-the-wealthy-are-said-to-hoard-10-billion-of-bitcoin
I also like to, even if it's been meh the last few days.
Dang that's all?!
51% in this case. Bitcoin is slightly more unpredictable. 
Downvotes are saying these folks don't know how to make money. 
I'd be estatic at 4k.
All goods and services are all priced in fiat, even if you pay with bitcoin. The BTC price in fiat currencies tells you how much you can buy with it.
Silly comment
This conference may have the opposite effect as what is expected
Big green dildo.
I haven’t had much success with it.  Mostly going with my gut based on current events.

Please be joking.

Right after I read your comment it dumped. 

Thanks bro!
As I see it, yes
He should probably consult someone who knows.
yeah you can get an app that would create a barcode for the payment amount to your wallet. Or just a barcode for your wallet address. the customer could scan it. Think all could run on phones wouldn't need a special device per se, perhaps a tablet for the payee. Instant transfer to fiat and payment processing I haven't heard of something that does this but i'm sure there is although I don't like it. What's the point in accepting bitcoin if you'll just sell it straight away. People want to buy with it to get it circulating. I mean the fluctuations can cut both ways. Accepting BTC is going to add work to accountancy regardless. worth the aggro 
its tuesday morning in NYC now
[deleted]
I still have a Radeon 8500 running smoothly almost 18 years old
1080ti are a grand only now
No
I sure haven’t sold 😁 
If I had a business I'd do it, you can "win or lose" money but it's the right step forward. Instead of doing 10-20% discount, I think I'd take the risk, that's not really a risk since I know bitcoin price will go to the moon so... Not really losing even if I sell my product below the price in worthless fiat money. 
I don't know, wait until you get more answers or start a thread as you might get more replies.
Transfer a small amount to it.  Go through all the security.  Write down your seed words and any password or pin hints.  Then make sure that after a reset (see the manual) you can restore your wallet and recover those funds using that seed.

Then you can transfer the rest of your stash in.  Confident that you have all you need to recover them.

Don't get over-paranoid - but be careful how you store your seed.
Same. I set min up entered wrong pin and let it reset 
So, I'm stupid like you?  I'll pass.
it's literally bitcoin but 10x smaller
these guys aren't idiots and they would want to have real bitcoins to their capital, if they do this OTC as you say, where would they buy these hashes from? 
Why are you pricing things in fiat? its peg to goods and services is decoupling negatively year over year.
Go back to the toilet paper world pleb.
Btw sent 200 pages to the IRS of my buys and sells that was 3 months ago never said anything to me
Glad someone got it 😝
What if you’re capable of both? *mind blown*
Your entire post history is about your own house, living in the bay area and living on minimum wage. Keep going dude.
And how would one go about selling an older account?  Asking for a friend.
Truthfully all I want to see is a gradual climb up. I’d like it to be above 10k soon though 
Ha oops sorry. Why has it dumped now let me guess someone dropped a pin in Bulgaria? 
When will we get above $10k? 
Well In reply to the last part of your comment; I would think a small business is just focused on capturing revenue from the money just sitting in bitcoin and is less interested in being a pizza shop and investment place holding bitcoin when it could take that profit and put it into growing the business. 
Ok :) 
I got lucky and bought two at 750 each before prices went crazy.  The sad thing is, I've never use them or my threadripper to mine anything.
Most every business goal is to deal in what they know. If you sell cakes, you deal in cakes. That means you want to minimize risk from everything but making and selling cakes. So most every business will not want to take that risk on.
What are you even on about lmao
And considerably cheaper - for noobs to buy, in large quantities, who think they are buying into the real vision..
Custodial firms like BlockTower Capital sell large amounts of Bitcoin. Start at the 9-minute mark https://soundcloud.com/unconfirmedpodcast/ari-paul-of-blocktower-capital 
>Why are you pricing things in fiat? 

Every business prices everything in fiat. Can you name a single business that prices things in anything else?

The price of goods and services in most fiat currencies changes by 0.2% per month at most. The price of goods and services in bitcoin often fluctuates by 5% or 10% in a few hours. 

>its peg to goods and services is decoupling negatively year over year.

You obviously have no idea what "peg" or "decoupling" mean, so why are you trying to use them to construct on nonsensical sentence?
Stop paying for anything with USD, let's see how long you survive. 
Thanks dude and it's true I want to show others it's possible
Does more age = more money? Asking for a friend.

I think a flea farted in Madagascar
an owner not converting straight to fiat isn't now running a hedge fund. Perhaps the pizza owner should try to offer btc payments to the box manufacturer or flour supplier. I dnno man. but if you want fiat straight in your bank you might aswell use visa in my opinion. bitcoin as a middleman sounds redundant. How about offering fiat customers their change in bitcoin.
dont kill your TR !
What vision?

BTC may have a better brand but both are just tokens doing nothing much other than being speculated on the exchanges (the only people making real money).
ok, that's all correct but i still really try to think why you think family offices and whales are loading up on btc OTC

that they allocate capital to it, I agree completely, did they do that 3 years ago? Absolutely not. 

> Can you name a single business that prices things in anything else?

Fortnite prices skins in vBucks.

> The price of goods and services in most fiat currencies changes by 0.2% per month at most. 

Inflation of fiat runs atleast at 2% compounded.

> You obviously have no idea what "peg" or "decoupling" mean,

Yet you say: "changes by 0.2% per month at most" and I just pointed out inflation decouples the price at compounded rate YoY.

> so why are you trying to use them to construct on nonsensical sentence?

You're just an uneducated pleb, and I'll feel sorry for you losing your wealth.
just pay for things with credit.
Yes and karma means more money as well but even if u had a lot your account prolly wouldn’t sell for more than $25 I’d say. It’s not like those types of sites give u a great deal, it’s like a yard sale price 
I am definitely diversified into different altcoins that seem to have merit. Trying to maintain an 80% bitcoin to altcoin ratio.  I do think we’ll be above 10k within weeks. By end of year I expect to be above 20k. 
Well I see your point but I think people with bitcoin would choose the bitcoin pizza store over the non even if their pizza is to a small degree not as good or as good of a value, so it’s attractive for a business to accept it as payment because it’s a marketing tool. Also visa takes a small but good percent out of their profit so accepting btc would help them generate more profit that way too. 
I honestly hate it.  I used to be an AMD fanboy, went to Intel because it made sense and came back to AMD for the TR and wish I would have done an I9 build instead.  The memory controller for the TR and its chipset is garbage.
>Inflation of fiat runs atleast at 2&#37; compounded.

Inflation in bitcoin prices was 6&#37; in the last 24 hours. That' over a billion percent inflation if you compound it on annual basis. Obviously a predictable 2&#37; is much better than insane swings with annualized rates often climbing in to the billions.

>and I just pointed out inflation decouples the price at compounded rate YoY.

I pointed out that your jumble of random words doesn't make any sense because you don't know what any of the words mean. Your response is  to make another nonsensical word salad with the same words?

I've been successfully investing my wealth since before you were born. You are lucky that you are an ignorant teenager without any money, so your extreme ignorance of basic economics concepts won't cost you anything.
xD
Hey, Mr Debt, you only reason why you are still surviving is because of fiat.  
And what are these "sites" you speak of? My friend would like to know.
you can survive off debt
No idea honestly but they use your account for I guess bots so their bots have credibility through karma and account age. My good friend told me about it and I pass that onto you but I do not know where to find a buyer 
Sure.  It's called being a loser.
The next time you see me I will be selling skin care products and posting anti-Trump memes.  Because of my friend.
Yea there's a reason why the rich don't have savings. 
Ah nothing like a good hearty wholesome laugh in the morning. I’ll see you on the other side 
Lol ... there is a thing called net worth :)
Savings decreases Networth over time. Think about it, my debts have been inflated away and additionally my assets have increased in fiat terms. I have gained twice the networth vs someone saving .
Who said anything about savings?
I did at the start. 

> Yea there's a reason why the rich don't have savings.

Why don't you read next time.
