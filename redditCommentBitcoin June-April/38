Daily Discussion, April 26, 2018 -- TITLE
Price seems to be tied to the McAfee-Dick-Line. If it stays that way for the next 2.5 years, I'm totally okay with that.

https://fnordprefekt.de/
8.6k seems like a solid base. will stay in these ranges for a while, volume will get low too. 

1 year ago: $1200. 
9k! A real milestone!

Someone should come up with a meme for that...
Make your own decisions. I repeat, do not listen to ANYONE if they think its going to 8.5K then to 5K or they think its going to 11K... etc.. 

It is your own money. Invest wisely, do not FOMO into anything. Stay away from TradingView opinions. MagicPoopCannon is an example that "helped saved"  thousands away from the 6.6K BTC to 9.5K BTC rise.

You make the call. Your profit margins are entirely yours. $100 USD profit or $1000 USD, or $100,000 USD, whatever your level of risk suits you best and makes you feel COMFORTABLE. **WHen you trade outside of your comfort zone, you make mistakes.**

Also, have a plan of when the price of BTC goes to 11K. Have a plan when the price of BTC goes to 5K. What alts do you want. What does your exit strategy look like? Before you buy, always have an exit plan and consider all possibilities. Like i said before when you trade with a smaller stack, you are alot more comfortable to make bolder decisions. You don't have to **kill it** on each and every trade. You just have to protect your capitol, and sometimes that means cutting losses. In other words, trade gently, but if you are not trading now, start coming up with plans on what you want to do!

Edit: also learn to spot trends. If you miss out on a run , there's always a retracement. Every single damn day is an opportunity. Just because the price went +15% doesn't mean you screwed up. It means that you have to keep looking and scouting. In particular look how bull runs and bear dumps look like, and what they look like before, during, and after. There are stages to these things and you can spot them over time with a few months of practice. Don't even invest. Just watch the charts and learn. Put in $20 just to test. Try to turn your $20 into $25. You do not have to kill it on every trade.

For example. I missed out on the run from 9250 to 9377 just  now. I sold at even. I do not panic nor do i fomo, or regret selling at around my buy-in price. My goal was to cash out some alts and go back to fiat. I know there is  a retracement opportunity, and even if you miss one retracement, there are more coming. Each one with its own characteristics.

Here's a simple "trick". Set a stop buy that anticipates retracement because #1 you don't have to commit to anything, and you control the buy in price after its proven its strength. As an example you set a stop buy of BTC at 8950  after BTC goes to 9075. There's also shapes you need to recognize, flag, triangles, and of course, the shape of bull runs and bear drops. Runs / Drops occassionally look like vertical lines, but more often, they are bubbles along the way. Lower circles ('soggy bottoms') and upper circles  ('top bubbles') appear on movement up and down, and there are thus 4 types 

* lower circles + price up = strong movement 
* lower circles + price down = descending but keep an eye to buy soon 
* upper circles + price up = dampening movment upwards.. look to sell soon
* upper circles + price down = possible whale movement downwards! 

Also of course look for pre-volume pump (high volume , relatively small price movement).. Tons and tons of things you can learn every day.

My TA shows a clear Caitlyn Jenner pattern forming
Once it hits $11K it will go directly to $20K. There's not gonna be any more dips, bear markets, pump and dumps, or any more distractions. It's gonna be a one way bull run. But we need to hit $11K first. 
**Support The Bulls**
Meanwhile, over on the naughty step:

What are Jihan and Ver's miners going to do with those tens of thousands of Bcash tokens they've been earning and holding?   (Releasing them would collapse their own price.  And you even buy the mining rigs with Bcash you know!)

They have already agreed amongst themselves to 'burn' some to boost 'uptake' (read: 'price')

Although that might in itself be a lie and a marketing strategy.

There is also the hardfork of Bcash coming - but many wallets and exchanges are unprepared.  And some people think it is one of those hardforks with free coins - nope.  Nothing free.  No 1:1.  Just a slightly new version of the scam coin.

Someone is bleeding BTC and other assets to boost that lying coin.  It can't last - it is starting to collapse already.

Sermon over..

Edit: grammar.


9000! I think we will be over 10k by monday

Hello, can you see this post please respond.
Keep positive folks, the outlook is still Bullish.  Don't let some people make you think negative, I have already seen a few concern trolls appearing today. 
Anyone else painting their dick green in celebration, or is that just me?
I think bitcoin are having a hard time to break the wall of 10 k but we are very positive that it can before the end of the month we already observe how fast it can get up for an hour only.Let's wait
I love it...woke up to a chart screaming big jump at 810am .....got back from the bathroom to find I took the smaller dump.....Who the heck is selling now ????? 
Volumes are falling back down. Probably means we are going to have some ‚Äòfake‚Äô bull-runs in this bear market. Buy the dip. 
It feels like there's some market manipulation currently at play; weather the storm guys, HODL strong :D
Alts are rising in relation to BTC. That's usually a good sign... Breakout soon...
ITS OVER 9000!!
The Bulls just needed a rest, they are full of energy now!  
When moon?

Good morning New York, any New Yorkers here?
Is anyone here a master with the pine editor on tradingview.com? I would like to have the McAfee-Dick-Line as an indicator in my chart.

At least gdax is keeping Americans from trading while mt gox dumps 16,000 coins. That should help the market. Brian (BCash Asshole) Armstrong earned his namesake today. Why they use that exchange is beyond us. 
Good morning Europe. 

Time to fomo in...
Its absolutely market manipulation.  Go to CoinMarketCap and nearly every other crypto in the top 100 is up, including bcash, but bitcoin is down.  This is why the SEC won't approve a bitcoin etf, and shouldn't;  even with all this liquidity there are too many big players capable of swinging the price dramatically at whim.  So what is it today?  A whale selling another 50 million.  Hedge fund guys selling bitcoin to drop the price before the expiration of their futures contracts.  Chinese miners and Ver dumping bitcoin when its down to pump up the  bcash price before it forks, which, by the way, is not going to air-drop any free coins like bitcoin forks did.

Here we go!
melt down yesterdey from 9.7 to 8.6 but broke the 2nd line of resistance out of 3 in just a day, looking good.  I think we'll retest 9.2sh again.  I think those fomos from yesterday saw the weakening bear of yesterdays at 8.6 and enters the market again.  
**Pullback Over? Bitcoin Retakes $9K, Eyes Further Gains**

https://www.coindesk.com/pullback-over-bitcoin-retakes-9k-eyes-further-gains/

Having recovered from a five-day low hit yesterday, bitcoin (BTC) has potential for a move higher towards major resistance at $9,880, the technical charts indicate.

The cryptocurrency moved back above $9,000 in the Asian hours after the pullback from the recent high of $9,767 ran out of steam around the ascending (bullish) 4-hour 50-candle moving average (MA).

As of writing, BTC is trading at $9,251 on Bitfinex, representing marginal losses over the previous day's close (as per UTC) of $9,270.

A bearish follow-through to Wednesday's bearish outside-day reversal would have been bad news for the bulls, but BTC instead appreciated by 4.5 percent on Thursday, keeping them in the game. Had BTC closed yesterday below $8,765 (Wednesday's low), the bears would have had the upper hand for the short-term.

View
**The pullback seems to have ended at $8,652, leaving bitcoin set to scale the resistance at $9,280 (double top neckline) and rise towards the 200-day MA located at $9,878.**

**Come On Bulls, keep fighting!**
Now pamp it!!!!!!! 
Let the rally begin...
Hmm... the fuck I sold at 9150 yesterday? :))
But still doesnt look like a healthy grow... probably gonna go down anyway at some point, maybe before 10k or after 10k.

Another bull run but nothing will slow it down this time, no erc20 bullshit or mt cocks dumping
Last time you'll see +9000, sell now.
We are heading back to 6700, same pattern.
Is it me or does this seem like such a wasted opportunity from the Bulls?

The door is open for going above $9k and they seem to be sitting on their arses doing sod all.
With so much negativity on the Reddit‚Äôs it makes me think where is the sudden massive volume coming from for these big pumps! There has to be a handfull of individuals controlling this market and making a fortune..
Well, that was fun while it lasted

Morning fellas, back with another live Bitcoin price analysis \+ perhaps some live trading if the opportunity presents itself. Open discussion for anyone interested!

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvrrrI\_avqo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvrrrI_avqo)
Sorry if this is the wrong place to post but I have a technical question about bitcoin. Does anyone know whats the reasoning behind the design choice of having fees that aren't fixed price for transactions? From what I see by not keeping them fixed it creates the problem of potentially delaying a transaction forever and I can't really see any advantages. It drives miners to choose the transactions with higher fees which in turn creates a "unfair" system as transactions aren't ordered in creation time. What would be the disadvantages of having fixed fees and having the mempool "ordered" with miners processing transactions in order? Is giving users the choice of paying higher fees to get their transaction processed faster a good enough advantage over fixed fees with ordered transactions?

Edit: I speak about order a lot, but even if we don't order it, is fixing fees and making every transaction have the same chance to be processed a bad thing? Why do we want to give the miners the ability to choose which transactions to put on the block?
so the 16k btc moved to exchanges will be dumped....this damn goxx
The Asians just aren't in this game at all. I wonder why. They were the ones that used to drive this. The driving force now seems to have shifted to the US.

Then we will not have a dick eating contest. How about we settle at 990000 and then we can also see him eating his dick ?
the ‚Äú$1200 last year‚Äù argument is getting kind of old. at this point it‚Äôs more of a reminder of how much is left to lose than anything else. 
I believe in bitcoin and I‚Äôm not going anywhere any time soon, but those huge jumps in such a short period of time is exactly why we‚Äôre in this slump in the first place 
OVER 9000? There's no way that can be right
Or simply buy and hold...
Good advice on this thread? What is this
Elaborate.
I agree!  Based off of nothing but my own hopes.
Nostradamus is trading once again :)
it hit 11800 over a month ago and then plunged all the way back down to 6800...
Could be right. Many are calling 11k being the key indicator of bull market truely being back.
Haha... There's way too many insiders profiting off the volatility. Bitcoin will take years to smooth out. 
11,800 after that it's a rapid rise.
Goldbergger is back. This comment will be deleted soon, as well.
Nah. Sunday and monday dip. Above 8.8k or 9k in best case  would be good. 
I'll buy a dozen.

Relax, we're still inside an uptrend. We will stay in it for the next ca. 9 hours without any movement in price. After that I would get worried...

https://i.imgur.com/5lFC9Yg.png

The SMA200 on the 1h chart is a very strong support. I guess we will go up much earlier than in 9 hours...

If that fails, then yes, we will have a strong correction to the downside.

But you're always saying that honey.  
The 200 day moving average is at $9878 right now, which is by funny accident also my personal break even point...

From the moment we break that and stay above, it's only Unicorns and Rainbows.

Until then, I'm just cautiously optimistic.
Im not positive unless price goes above 10k soon

hello, it's ok

The simple solution to this problem is for more little guys to keep buying the coins from the whales and hold them or spend them. Stop panic selling them back on the market to the whales.   

There is a finite supply of bitcoin with many coins already lost.  The problem will ultimately correct itself. 
Sorry, I wasn't able to follow completely. Bitcoin went up from 6.6k to 9.7k, then it recently fell down to 8.7k - 8.8k, with most major alts mirroring its price movement fairly well. I guess down depends on when you bought in. For me it's still up about 28-30%.

Sure, there have been a tough sell pressure from some whales since the price reached 9.7k. On the flip side, other whales, combined with some bulls have defended the 8.7-8.8k price range for a while in spite of heavy pressure. There are many interests at play in the market.
Just because alt coins are in green on coinmarketcap does not mean they are going up. They are only up as compared to 24 hours ago but overall pretty much fucked up. Doing much worse than bitcoin indeed. 

But I agree with you that there is too much market manipulation and I dont know how long it will take before bitcoins are evenly distributed and a single person or group can not manipulate the price. 
Very simply: You want a market without regulation, don't gripe about the manipulation. An unregulated market is an open invitation to manipulation.
Only if you drive fast enough

I'm forecasting myself .25 BTC short of my goal, and I got nothing left in the closets to sell.  Shite!

Sell: NOW
Buy: 6700
Hold your horses üêé üêé üêé there buddy. We still need to take out 10k. 
As long as the market is not sure if we stabilise or not people will take profits a lot. There is not a single example were a asset just jumps back up after a crash. It takes time to build support for a direction again and then all the fomo people can join again.

Nothing's ever the same with Bitcoin, that's why TAs failed so miserably on this.
Please let this be true, I need to buy. 
In between sessions. Most Americans are in their cars going to work. 
>Is it me or does this seem like such a wasted opportunity from the Bulls?

How is sitting tight and letting someone else drive up the price so that you can sell off the back of their work a wasted opportunity? A higher price in and of itself has no value.
I suspect it was more of a slow strategic retreat back to more favorable price altitudes, due to excessive selling pressure.

Let the sellers sell at a level that favor bulls, no reason to give sellers extra bucks for coins that they appear to be intent on selling anyway. While pursuing sideways trading I wouldn't be surprised if bulls keep selling high and buying back low repeatedly in order to increase liquidity for further advances. They are investors and traders as well and need to make up for the cost of protecting price ranges.

Personally I appreciate the work of the bulls, they have endured a tough sell pressure lately and they also cannot risk to overextend themselves for the long run. So no, I don't consider bulls sitting on their arses.
There seems to be no serious bulls at these levels. Around $6K seems to be where the action is. 
Maybe in about 7 hours.  The weekend pump usually begins around then 
I mean really after a bullshit drop like that - why not sit on your hands and wait for a better price to buy? Also, there‚Äôs fresh memories of the Jan/feb/march pile of poop. So I‚Äôd think that reinforces peoples fears. Especially the newbies and folks sitting on the sidelines considering investing.

Think about it in another way: if fees were too low I would start to encode the backups of my computer in transactions and store them on the blockchain. The storage space on the great immutable blockchain is intended for transactions but it would be misused for all kinds of other stuff. We saw that throughout the history of computing: the more space became available, the more it was used. Microsoft Word used to fit on a floppy disk, now it uses hundreds of MB of data.

If blocks were larger, people would find ways to fill them up somehow. Maybe some idiotic exchanges would start adding a scan of your ID attached to every transaction... because that would solve them some AML issues and with large blocks they could (I know it‚Äôs stupid... but you never know). I can‚Äôt predict how things will evolve, but historically more space always led it to be used up somehow.

Transactions must have a price or we would succumb to spam or huge amounts of data.
Because there are more innovative ways to scale bitcoin that don‚Äôt compromise decentralisation.
Decrease fransaction fees even more?
You mean like getting paid if you make a transfere? /s

Transaction fees have a purpose and if you would think it over: it is a essential part of this system.
We have a price discovery that is depending on the cost of maintaining the system, which itself is still developing.
Maintaining the system is being paid by fees and btc rewarded (this later is for 'now').

Paying fees also helps keeping the system more stable, preventing spam over the network.

So i,m happy to pay the, especially the current amount needed, fees for the provided services.
In fact at the moment I'm regarding it to be dirt cheap and expect it will rise in the next trend toward a new top.

So anticipate and use it for your needs.

I hope we get another short squeeze
I hope we get another short squeeze
over time, the block reward gets smaller. as that happens, miners will rely more and more on transaction fees as their source of income. once all the bitcoins have been mined, transaction fees will be the sole source of mining income.

without getting too deep in the weeds, how likely does it seem that we could pick a single, hardcoded transaction fee amount that would lead to a well-functioning bitcoin economy, even as the block rewards get cut in half every four years?

i‚Äôd say fixed transaction fees would be very destabilizing for the mining industry, to say the least.
Sorry chap.  We're too busy watching Hulk's schlong.

Ask a techie.
fees aren't based on transaction price, but on memory size. Miners want to fit as many transactions (with fees) on 1 block so the transaction size matters. Transactions to multiple addresses are larger in size than 1 to 1.

If a transaction doesn't get picked up by miners because of a low fee, you can create a new transaction to the same address with a higher fee and the miners will most likely combine them to mine at the same time.

Good questions.

We're not far away from "$2,000 last year" and "$4,000 last year". We're just a few months away from being able to say Bitcoin has been worth at least $4k for an entire year. When considering this... it makes it seem much less like a bubble, and more like we're seeing increased adoption and faith in the value of Bitcoin. 
Maybe we could put that slogan over a cartoon that is popular, so it'll get the youth involved in Bitcoin too.

16000 bitcoins were moved from their wallet. Actually 16000 bitcoins dont make any difference. Their value is only 144 million USD and total bitcoin 24h volume is 10B. 144M USD should not make any difference. Its just FUD which is caused by this issue.

This is a very strange narrative that you've constructed.
I guess you were asleep that last few days then.
Hey man, I've seen plenty of bulls at work lately, they have just been facing a tough sell pressure. But I am sure they are managing fine. I'd buy them a beer if they were around. And nah, we don't really need 6k right now when there are better aims to be had.
Hopefully :) 
That sort of attitude means the price will keep falling.
99% of statistics are made up on the spot 
So treating this literally, 810,501 r/btc readers -> 81,050,100 bitcoin buyers.  Wider adoption than I thought, but barely more than 1% of the world's population.  Well, throw int other subreddits, too.
Or they could just get out.
He shorted with 100x
I'll take that back :|
It's not too late since it has dropped 55%.
It takes shockingly little time to remind you that bitcoin is less of an investment and more of flipping a coin.
It's a trap!
I hadn‚Äôt heard this particular argument in detail before and it‚Äôs a really compelling one - thanks for sharing!
And those are? Why don't we just do both?
good points. i am not sure exactly what he meant by fixed fees, but i interpreted it as a fixed fee in terms of satoshis per byte. not a fixed fee for each transaction, which would be completely untenable.
Ja, but if half your support disappears it's time to start worrying. If they've been clamped down on to the point where they're almost out of the market then the same thing will come to the West. 

European sessions are also weak. It's only late in the US session that we're getting the moves. 

It might be something else entirely of course, but it is noticeable how quiet the Asian and European sessions are. 
Hopefully. It's gaining "some" energy now. See whether it breaks the barrier of 10k. 
You're welcome to check my post history. I am as bullish as they come. I see the Mt Gox liquidation as a buying opportunity.

I check the Gox wallets weekly and hadn't seen this change before. Follow Antonopolous, Szabo, Samson Mow, Charlie Lee etc on Twitter and hadn't seen it mentioned.

Looked on reddit r/Bitcoin and saw no mention of it.

Decided it was worth posting in case someone hadn't seen it.

If that is "paid FUD", then I guess everything is...

Wash mate. If you wipe you walk around with a dirty arse all day. Asians are right. Use the hosepipe. 
Im realist, nothing more. Its same with gpu mining shitcoins. All noobs got scared and ran away.
yeah, when you just conveniently leave out the massive drops and losses a lot of people suffered, it‚Äôs a great number. lol 
4 months ago, bitcoin was worth $20K. Today it‚Äôs less than half that value. From that perspective, Bitcoin should be $4400 come August/September.
My opportunity cost is the extra work I would have with all the tax bureaucracy...
Ha. Got me.
> I know Bitcoin

Bitcoin knows you!
Bitcoin is my close uncle, he knows me more than you
It‚Äôs easy to know bitcoin. It‚Äôs impossible to know the masses.
I took the Bitcoin Master-bation class
Sorry Steve, your name - it's just a little too masculine for the sort of gf I was after.
Yes, I think he is :)
Where I come from if it's green they chop it off...
See - he knows.
Down 2 percent, but btx is up (that is also a fork? Right? ) 

But hold your horses, superbitcoin is up a whopping 111% it is truly super. 
Hunh? My wife's sister is not my grandmother. That would be weird. 
Looks like a necrotic testicle
And you want other people to drive up the price. Be the change you want to see in the world. Invest more.
I think its not 16000, its 8000
Very true
Welcome to the club
Not saying you're wrong to ask here, just saying you might have more luck there

How to get infinite bitcoin


Trololol
Ah, I told Reddit to miss me with that shit a few weeks ago
It will go down again, its too fast. FOMO kicked in.
I set parameters for myself when I'm gonna invest. I am not buying above 8k and I'm selling the profit above 10k (It's been a while) hodl the rest. I'm not a pro trader or rich to put my money all in or be trading daily. 

Perhaps I need new parameters now. I don't know but that's bitcoin this year it's been 12k-6k ups and downs.
I bought some bitcoin in the back of an Uber yesterday. Fortunately for others I wasn‚Äôt driving the Uber 
I bought a little bit of Bitcoin this morning while driving in bumper to bumper traffic to Pasadena
I've heard the rumours. Can you tell me why Americans need camo underwear ? Why exactly do they need to run around in the bush in their underwear and not be seen ? 
>I'm not selling anything.

So why do you care about what the price is?
Not asleep but away from cryptos. I didn't trust the move up and I sold when it hit $8.5k. I might jump back in at some point but not now.
Because reddit commentary has a huge impact on price fluctuations.
[deleted]
Heh :)
Wat?
Weird that you feel compelled to come to a Bitcoin sub to say that though. 

Do you do the same for everything that you consider a risky investment or did you personally get burnt? 
This consistent growth doesn't look like "coin flipping" to me. Just look at these charts:

I know.  
this has been discussed many times; search a bit and you can find some great articles on the subject.
It's really been discussed to death...
The big pumps back to back days came just as Asia was waking up. I think they already Fomo'ed in from 9k-9700. We'll see them making moves again after 9700

Bitcoin has no time schedules
Dude, it was extensively discussed on multiple forums yesterday. Also you could have said it in a better way than ‚ÄúALERT ALERT‚Äù shit.
It was all over reddit for the past 24 hours...

e.g.:

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8f6lqi/mtgox_movements_today/

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8f1wze/i_followed_the_mtgox_outgoing_transaction_bread/
Nope. Started in January. Still buying. 
The only people seeing massive drops and losses are the people who bought in at the bubble a few months ago. That's on them for short sighted investment. None the less if they actually believe in the tech and aren't looking to get rich quick that investment will reverse in the long term. 
That stuff is not as relevant as the overall price support over long periods of time. Soon, people's perspective will change from "I can't believe Bitcoin was only worth $1,000 last year" to "I can't believe Bitcoin was only worth $6-8,000 last year". Imagine seeing an entire year where the lowest price was $6000. That's where we're headed. 
3 months ago, it was $5,800 for a few minutes. We're up considerably since then. 
The opportunity cost is every other market you could have your money in rather than bitcoin.
Bitcoin knows that guy! 
I think it's time you check your privilege. Names are just a social construct built on msyogny. Born into a family of attack helicopters, a name was my only way of getting out alive. 

Now, should I bring the green dildo condoms and the six pack of Zima? Or will you? 
Lol 
No, that's MY testicle.
Jesus :D
I do when I can.  
btw from where did you get this news?
Na i don't think so ..I think we break 10k by the weekend 
Fair enough. I don't think it will go below 8k ever again. But I could be wrong. I'm sure, we'll see soon. Oscillations are flattening out. There will be a breakout soon. 

I hope it'll go up, but it might as well go down...
I'm not selling at the moment but one day I will probably sell or maybe I will just use them to buy things. 
Ok. 
No one knows what impact it has but it's a very big forum.  Is there a bigger Bitcoin forum on the internet?
If they're doing it to make money, why would they care what the price is after they sell their bags?
Its fun reading all the delusion and hypocrisy in here while I poop.  A dose of reality is needed from time to time.  
>$2.55m bitcoin

So you really think the total market cap of bitcoin by the year 2025 will be about half the global GDP?
Consistent growth?  Its been nearly 70% off all time highs in just the last few weeks.  
How long were house prices going up?

I think the market manipulation is mostly done by the Americans and Asians are being victim of it (they do FOMO and FUD easily). I could be totally wrong but u need to look at the timings of big upward and downward movements.
I saw that move and I'm in Asia. Was at about 3,4 am. Wasn't Asians that did that. Was the USA or maybe the Australians, but not Asia. 
I'd really appreciate a few links. I thought I had a good take on current events but this slipped by. I said "alert alert" as someone before asked "what are you talking about" the only other time I saw it mentioned so I believe not many must have known.

I would have thought a move that potentially brings 160,000 new bitcoin into the market would have multiple threads and people analysing the exact movements etc to determine exchange / OTC.

I'll stick to the script from now on hodlers... When moon, when lambo...
I was more responding to his ‚Äúgood sign for adoption‚Äù argument. I agree on them making short sighted investments, but the general public won‚Äôt forget that and won‚Äôt see it the same way. And we need that money to reach those highs again and to encourage more adoption
Yes, I used the wrong term. Big deal. You'll understand what I meant.

Edit: Actually, I didn't use the wrong term.

"Thus, opportunity costs are not restricted to monetary or financial costs: the real cost of output forgone, lost time, pleasure or any other benefit that provides utility should also be considered an opportunity cost."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost
As long as it is a safe space, with only masked SJW protesters shouting and screaming and wielding bats, I think it'll be OK.
Its still necrotic 
they just consolidating to one wallet and apart from this, who cares about 16000 btc sellng (exept of there are more for us :-)

https://www.cryptoground.com/mtgox-cold-wallet-monitor/
Not gonna happen
Oh don't worry it will go up, that's for sure. Patience and hodl those coins. 
And until that point, why do you care what the price is?
no one who could actually move the market would be hanging out in here and they definitely wouldn‚Äôt be taking any advice from anyone here lol 
I figure if I were a pro at this I wouldn't want to kill a market that isn't regulated, a Wild West for trading where you can do things that aren't allowed in the stock market.
Haha fair enough, can‚Äôt argue with that 
Guys it worked. MY turn 
Well I'm in the Asian time zone. Wasn't the Asians that did it. They've done nothing today.
Thats fine.

Please check within r/bitcoin and r/cryptocurrency and you will find many threads. Its indeed 16000 or 20000 bitcoins which were moved , not 160,000.

Yes I checked your history and saw you were generally positive about bitcoin. Sorry for calling you fud. 
Ok, see you at 9pm PST. 
Thank you.
YOU GUYS WE HAVE A TRADING GENIUS ON OUR HANDS!
I just want to see Bitcoin succeed and for the price to reach new all time highs.
I can tell you with certainty that the discussions on this forum do not represent a large or a majority of seasoned investors for certain.
Probably but you never know.

Asians are smart, followed by europe. Americans are those, who can be easily manipulated by fomo. And Roger ver
screamed the big gay jesus...
How can you be so certain?
Don't think so mate. America didn't get where it is by luck. They work hard and they are smart. 
But not smarter than asians and europeans.
>America didn't get where it is by luck.

Depends on whether you view not being destroyed in two world wars as luck I guess
America was mostly a European colony. Australians are Europeans as well. 
Definitely wasn't luck.
Geography isn't luck? Okay.
Might want to tell that to the Indians. Helped them absolutely stuffall. 
Yep, for sure being the only continent with manufacturing capability didn't help the countries on that continent with their economy. 100% B.
