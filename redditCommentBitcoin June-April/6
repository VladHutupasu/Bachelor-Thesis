Daily Discussion, May 28, 2018 -- TITLE
Looking at the price of Bitcoin and then going on this sub makes me feel like I'm living in two different worlds.
Honestly, when checking BTC price, who else here is now conditioned to believe that the price will be lower than the last time you checked. The fact just hit me today that I have that condition....
I need to be put in a fucking coma until this things recovers
This slow bleed is tantalizing. If we see 6’s panic selling would set in getting us to buyers market. (Just observations from previous years)
If it goes below $7k, we might start seeing a lot of panic sell and quickly drop down in the low 6Ks. 
I can feel the sidelines getting HOT
What in the actual fuck is even going on here??
what are bcasher say now?

Well time to go put my penis in a blender to pass the time until the next recovery 
Have the bankers and fudders won? We keep going down and it’s June. 6 months of bear. 
I'm from the future. It's December 2020. Bitcoin crashed from 110K to 55K and still recovering. Panic sellers. 
 I suspect we might drop below 7k in the coming days. If that's the case, I have no doubt that it's time to increase my position while it's cheap 👌
I bet Soros sold all his bitcoin for 10k each
**Come On Bulls, put up a fight!**
I should not have poked it with a stick 
wow everyone abandoning ship already
IMO those who are freaking out about price have done a poor job with asset allocation/diversification. In other words, taking on way more risk than is appropriate for your portfolio and time horizon
By the looks of this, Poop might actually be right. [I might actually bounce at 7K, up to 8K.](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/fmjAIUtp-Puff-Puff-Pass-Bitcoin-From-Tha-Clouds-To-Tha-Grass-BTC-D/)
It can be good start to new ath. More money incoming to cryptomarket. 
Booo!

I just purchased some juice and coils with bitcoin here. 

*pokes at it with a stick*
*This doesn't look like anything to me...*
Who's to blame for this drop? 
What's the official r/bitcoin response to this rigorously peer\-reviewed article: [Bitcoin estimated to use half a percent of the world's electric energy by end of 2018](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-05/cp-bet051018.php) ?

Because according to John Gruber "[This is not going to end well](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/05/22/bitcoin)" ...

#freetommyrobinson
Looks like about to break 7000, then 6000, then the panic selling sets in...then 5000 or below. 

For all the hodlers...why not sell now and buy back below 6000?
**Bitcoin Bears Still in Charge But Indecision Could Open Doors for Rally**

https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-bears-still-in-charge-but-indecision-could-open-doors-for-rally/

While the odds are still stacked in favor of bitcoin's bears, a level of indecision looks to be creeping in, according to the technical charts.

The cryptocurrency fell to a 6.5-week low of $7,142 on Bitfinex earlier today, having breached the 50-week moving average (MA) support for the first time since 2015.

Amid the continued drop in prices, though, the charts show a doji candle formed yesterday, indicating that the bears may be running out of steam and a short-term rally could be on the cards.

As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $7,210 – down 16.58 percent from the last Monday's high of $8,644.

**View**

BTC looks set to test the psychological support of $7,000. Acceptance below that level would expose the April 1 low of $6,425.

An unexpected close today (as per UTC) above $7,425 (doji candle high) would confirm a short-term bullish doji reversal and allow a minor corrective rally, possibly to $7,800–$8,000.

Only a convincing move above the weekly 50-MA would abort the bearish view. Meanwhile, a break above $9,990 (May 5 high) would imply a bullish reversal.
I just bought more.
Damn manipulators are really trying to kill this market. But they can’t kill it, just only prolong the parabolic pump to the moon.
To the mooooon
Interest in BTC has dropped, 4k volume daily has killed the price. More interest = price increase IMO. Back a couple months ago, and even a couple weeks ago we were around 20-30k btc per day. No volume now
Hope it keeps dropping before my next paycheck.. 
Making an investment shouldn't keep you worried all the time and make you check its price daily. Ask yourselves is it worth it? Is it worth worrying about its price everyday?
When something you invest is this volatile I don't think it's a healthy investment. Mental stability > $ gains
Hi all, Today is just another day in crypto. As long as we keep believing in the future of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and keep spreading the word we can be the gate to mass adoption. Please enjoy being a part of this while it is still in it's infancy... and do not forget to enjoy your life! Life is way to short to zoom in to daycharts! Zoom out for a while, it helps :\-\) I wish you all the best. With love!
Now is time to buy
wrong way, captain FUD is in charge. expect 6,5K

Genius!  Who knows - it might do quite well.

(Mods: feel free to remove if I've broken any rules.)
These Memorial Day sales keep getting better!
7000 looms; larger now than expected. Want Bitcoin to bottom quick so all can get on with the recovery. Looks to be lacking the volatility spikes and dips during the last week...just a steady down trend. Maybe the Bitcoin God's are watching over us. Translation: Bag it now while you can.
A word of caution here for individuals on the crypto Reddit subs that give advise about investment strategy, likes, dislikes, etc.  etc.  There are people that roam the subs looking for those individuals so they can sue for mis\-information, effecting losses. If you are someone like myself that enjoys helping others or gives advice, always include something along the lines of, "This is not investment advice and is only IMHO".  Crypto scammers show their ugly faces in many ways, and that is one of them.
Sell now?
Have latest developments put the smack\-down on Lambo dreamers on this sub, or what? Who enjoyed watching them make baffoon's out of themselves? Cmon kids, come out of hiding now \- we know you're out there.
Finally broke through 7.2.... 6k here we come. 
6500 in 24 hrs? Anyone Anyone?

Maybe wrong place to ask, but I want to start investing into Bitcoin a little bit and wondering if the Cash app is a good place to start or is it a waste of time? Or a credible site someone can recommend instead?
Start digging the 7K memes! It's time to make them shine once more!
someone here would have an opinion on the jpy (yen)/btc on bitflyer? everything is normal ?
I’ll wait 
I just sold my house go all in on BITCOIN AT 1.3K

I THINK I WILL BE ABLE TO BUY SHIIII@@T TON OF BITCOIN
Bitcoin is dead. 
9k this week, 12k middle of june.
7k is a strong support, We gonna to start race again to 10k
10k get ready, its time to change trend.
Rub a dub dub, yay Bitcoin!
We need to start integrating use in our society. Doing so will be the key to making us and country that does so successful. They’re are still not many places that accept bitcoin and crypto. 
Question: Is there anywhere online a tool or a programm you can download which lets you guess nonces by hand? I haven't seen anything in the like and I would like to have this to play around in my free time. I mean mega-hashing and stuff is fine and efficient but it's not suited just for playing around.
Hopefully theres a hidden Rockefeller pump at 4k
It looks like China bans bitcoin
I’m looking at my portfolio...if I look at the Jan peak it now looks like it’s showing me the middle finger.....it’s telling me that it fucked me. Feels about right 
6800-6900 and we gonna to 12k. Stay ready
[removed]
Given the current price movement, I vote to rename BTC to TerriSchiavoCoin \(TSC\). Who else is with me?

We will fall next 7-14 days, then new bullrun starts.
Easy way to bypass credit card block. Use a bovado like site which all credit cards love cause they get paid if you win and get to sue if you don’t. 

Than withdrawal immediately into a bitcoin address. Not Bcash account cause miners can reverse it. Bcash is centealized ...... works every time. I buy all my bitcoin this way cause credit cards screwed me my entire life buying college books and food. Our turn to turn the tables. They love gambling sites than withdrawal to a hardware wallet. Money is untouchable. 
Bottoming out at 1.5k in 2019 then 10k again in 2020
6900 test might happen today? Then moon?
It's not dropping below 7k so no reason to tether or sell at this point. Stay strong y'all!!
Very interesting predicts of Tom Lee - https://cryptolearningacademy.com/bitcoin-bull-tom-lee-25000-eoy/ 
https://cryptocoremedia.com/wall-street-strategists-bitcoin-91000/

I hope so much that BTC will reach about $25,000 Q3 or Q4. Coming soon enormous institutional capital inflow to cryptomarket after these good regulations. Why? because they know that blockchain/cryptomoney/digital assets/tokenization are the future of economy ! you will see! 


Tether rumors were true. Without it its deflated so much.

The minor price bumps now are exchange manipulation to trap more suckers down to the bleed to $1k
6k bois 
[removed]
How come we pay fees to the miners to send bitcoin when they are already paid by the blockchain introducing new  BTC into the market?
[removed]
It drop to 6k quickly
So much FUD. I guess all the Bitcoin ATMs are in vein because FUDsters hoping to short said so?
looking forward to 6k again.  got some greenery to exchange for it.  just being patient.
[removed]
If this forum were named "BTC Pumping" it would make a lot more sense to you.
Why?
Yuuup.  Every time I go to sleep I prepare to be poorer when I wake up.  
Yeah this is typical unfortunately. BTC actually stays pretty linear up and down when in the context of weekly trends.
You need to stop looking at the goddamn price, Mr. Weak Hands.
Just speaking for myself, but when I see BTC below 7k I only think of buying instead of panic selling
Is there even any new money around to panic sell? Whoever is in now is old money or new money with enough balls to hodl no matter what.
Well, this guy sold his stack at 9k and has been buying back incrementally since, so the lower it goes the more he buys back. There will be no panic sales from him.
As has been stated multiple times before, most of the weak hands have been long shaken out. A more accurate depiction would be how many longs get liquidated below 7k.
We were too stupid to get out at 20k.
Ummmmm....duck 'n run?
Like the logo
Excellent !!! Finally !!!
Typically right around the time my confidence goes to an all time low the market gives reason for hope.  News is mostly optimistic but I really think it’s just simple manipulation and accumulation going on.  Moon and June rhyme?
6 months is NOTHING.

Remember .... Gandhi struggled for 42 years to free India!!!
It's accumulation time. 😁
Oh boy! I've been craving a summer sale. 
Most of them, probably. All of them \- probably not. \- He's not stupid. 
We want it to hit a trendline then we'll rally.
Or poke it again....
Nah, they’re just selling their position which is the wrong way to BTC 
I dunno.... Even if i was a millionaire, I'd be piss losing a few grand. 
Christ.  Don't do that - almost gave me a bloody heart attack when I looked up at the screen.
They bought their own coils from themselves? 
look what you’ve done 
Personally I think it's still a technical correction. I've spent the past week researching pretty heavy on bitcoin over the past few years. The one conclusion I came to is people have absolutely no idea what the price is going to do. Just last year when the price began to run there were all of these sell articles and comments about 3,000. Oh my gosh it made a huge run get out get out. Now that happened all the way to 20,000 but it happened a lot less in the last $10,000. The human mind is genetically programmed to spot patterns. It could be something hereditary. Who knows but we all do it. That's useful with some things but with markets it creates a bias. The price run in 2017 to $3,000 was probably the most fearful of all. The correction that happened later that year also sparked a ton of fear. Why that earlier run was so important is because it came off of a reasonable bear Market where the price didn't really do anything so when the price began to behave differently people literally panicked. If you have the time study a lot of the posts on bitcointalk and online and go back a few years. The most interesting part of all is the crowd was most often wrong. They were fearful when they should have been greedy and greedy when they should have been fearful. When I look out the window right now in the crypto Market you know what I see? A ton of fear.
It is my brilliant opinion that its bigg banks trying to destroy bitcoin or accumulate at lower price. But who or  whatever the reason is.. im NOT selling. let it even go to 0,  i would rather thake my coins with me in te grave than to sell my ticket to the moon at this price !

Only BTC itself because it has no real usage in the world, it has no intrinsic value etc. 
More sellers than buyers 

What is the percentage of the world electricity used by payement method that could potentially be replaced by bitcoin? If Bitcoin replace those method of payement all that energy will be spared. Also when bitcoin goes stable and the energy spend securing the network is enough to render any attack too expensive to be successfull. There will be no incentive to make it more secure than it should be \(let say the miner rewards get in equilibrium as well so no extra miner have incentive to get into the game and drive the difficulty of the network any higher\).

then Bitcoin will be sucessfull.

Funny thing is, if Bitcoin doesn't go to an exagerated value, there will be no incentive to mine or secure the network more than it should be. It's a self regulated phenomenon that still need to converge to an equilibrium.

\- A stable BTC will have enough miner to secure the network without incentive to add more miners.

\- an overevaluated BTC need more security, but more miner will join in because it get more profitable.

\- an underevaluated BTC doesn't need more security because the benefit of attacking the network isn't worth it, and miner will leave the network because it isn't profitable for them anymore.

The difficulty adjustment is taking care of all that.

Unless a significant par of the network is leaving at the same time wich would decrease the confirmation time for a period of 2 weeks. And even that could be taken care of\-chain by the LN Network.

Also, the provider of electricity will adjust their rate following environemental requirements that might change in the future should the situation get out of control. That will also change the cost of securing the network \(driving miner out of the equation and driving the price of BTC to a new lower equilibrium\).

This electricity consumption is moot because how much energy bank are spending to secure your cash?

How much energy banks and payement provider are spending in their high rise building all over the world?

Your peer reviewer article needs to put thoses value against each other to declare any winner.
you are getting banned in 10.9.8.7.6.. reason "spamer"
> What's the official r/bitcoin response

Fcking lol
Start spraying it on the motorway bridges...also I asked him to create a Coinbase or Binance account...wanted to transfer some goods to him...I guess I will have to wait...
How can you be both pro-bitcoin and pro-racism?
because what you said might also not happen?
Or it just bounces here. I hold to the bitter end... 🤘🏻
The chart is a parabola. Just in the wrong direction.  
It's probably just MtGox doing us a favor and offering us a nice sale. Be grateful.
It also means that most people are holding at those prices. The trading is now between traders, panic sellers and accumulators.

As soon as the interest is refreshed, this might take a while, there will be less coins to trade and the price will shoot up.
That argument goes both ways. Price increase causes more interest.
if you need to wait until your paychecks come in to buy bitcoin, you probably shouldn't be investing in it, or anything other than your personal savings for that matter...
A society of chaos is much better than one stuck in linear (unnoticed/injected) habits that are keeping people at their basic existence level rofl
Dude, that's what makes it fun! :).

For me - Stocks = Work, BTC = Sport
Yeah everyone should bail so you can scoop it up cheap right?! Or you're shorting and will get rekt soon. 
zoom out? that makes the crash even bigger.
Awwww :)  I'm feeling all squishy now.
Later it will be time to sell at a loss
yes it is the time to buy at the lowest price and when this market will regain its strength i think if this will do, we can have our money going to the moon
Just did. Now we wait, still got some on sidelines for if we see higher lows.
Man the lifeboats!  

Women, children and, oh, thank you Sir.  

Women, children and Mr Ver first!   
this is good for bitcoin

If I had more money, I would buy more BTC. I bought the 6k dip and I bought some this dip as well.
On the contrary, buy as much as you can now!
Is this a joke? Even an idiot knows you don't sell now...This could get ugly. Buy and hold all the way down; Bitcoin trading 101.
We're just resting. We'll be back soon.
Holy shit these posts get tiresome. You kids really want to call people out on every dip just so that they can call you out once the price goes up again? Grow up

Do  you want crypto to succeed? Or should crypto die completely?
You be can hope.
You have no idea what you're talking about, do you?
maybe he designed a scheme and cashed out. and after years it turned out to be something wonderous. just like someone try to poison you and you end up being a superhero.
Shameless self promoting. Insta block.
GDAX is owned by Coinbase. Funds on both are FDIC insured. I use Coinbase and transfer out from there because the user interface is simple and easy to understand. If you really are a beginner, I recommend Coinbase. This is NOT investment advice. This is common sense.
Coinbase is easy for beginners. Transfer money there but don't buy your bitcoins from Coinbase. Use their exchange called GDAX (will be Coinbase Pro in the future). That way you don't pay extra broker fees. Theres plenty of videos out there, just search for 'coinbase no fees' on youtube.
Good place to ask. Recommending Coinbase for entry. Anyone that tells you different is either dis\- informed or trying to scam you.
Lots of good advice here.  Yes GDAX is the cheapest and quite good.  However you specifically asked about the Cash App.  I have used both and do think the Cash App is the easiest and allows you to buy more per day (unless you are willing to wire money to fund).  The "fees" work out to about 1.3% which is not horrible.  
gdax best
Where did you buy BTC at 1.3k at the moment \(USD I guess if you didn't specify the currency?\)

Who in his right mind would sell BTC OTC 5\-6\* below market price? Are theses tainted BTC bought OTC or what?
I'm glad that natural selection helps with making stupids homeless...
So is Root Beer!
Bitcoin is alive.
i hope it will hit the 12k in the middle of JUne,2017.
lol
The reality is that for domestic, local purchases it is unlikely to happen. After all, the cashier who sells sth to you is paid in fiat, the goods are paid for in fiat etc. The real market appears to me to be international. I read just yesterday of a fine arts house in London which accepts bitcoin. Suppose an item is sold by a european (Eurozone), sold in London for GBP, bought by an American.  Say the sale price is 1 million, I would guess the transfers/ fees of $ to GBP to Euro would be 3-4% of the transaction amount. If the buyer can use BTC, and especially if the seller accepts BTC then it makes sense all round.
I hate to be the “relax” guy. But... 
I can smell the tears in your posts. Go take a shower or watch some comedy series, or whatever, there goes my advice.
12k aint happening, 9k is the max if they have enough tether to pump it... 
You say no one cares about Bitcoin but you are on here daily telling us no one cares.  See the irony of your ways? 
I do. The market sucks right now. But the technology is awesome. The market will get better in time. 
Pssh, don't talk like that about BTC religion
Btw why don't you preach your stuff where BTC is not known lmaoo
No one is buying your drivel, go fly a kite Gilbert.
I feel like you’re glass isn’t even half full. 
Have been listening that since Jan.
 We will fall next close to zero days, then end starts \^\^
Thanks for the insight \- I'll be buying in at 1800.
we say this at every price. its getting old. 'everything is very possible my friend'
ok.
Everything is very possible my friend
moon seems quite far.
how do you know? easy to drop below 7k
im fine if btc have a bull next year....
you don't need bitcoin to implement blockchain

in fact, bitcoin is a failed payment tech
Sorry but Tom Lee has *never* made an accurate prediction.

And each time he screwed up, he comes up with some ridiculous excuse.
Is this the same Tom Lee that invest in Tesla?
Can you elaborate further? What do you mean, Tether rumors were true? Are you talking about the 1:1 parity with USD ?
Stop throwing out FUD without facts. 
How many accounts are you posting under? At least 10.
Nah too much support at 6900
Sure, like your measly percentage has kept it flat\-lined. Good one. Damn! Just when you think you've seen 'em all, you've seen another. 
Mining and processing of transaction (e.g. confirmation) are two separate jobs.  Think of it as production and ongoing operations cost.
The miner would mine empty block if there was no incentive to add transaction into it.

Also the network is bound to only have the transaction as incentive because the block reward is converging to zero with time.

Everyone(pool) is fighting to find the next block. When you are a miner you(your pool) spend a lot of energy and when you find a block you are granted the block reward (value decreasing has the time goes by) this is creating new BTC on the network and you are allowed to insert in your block some of the transactions sitting in the mempool. To optimize the return of your investment you’ll pick the most profitable transaction (highest paying) to be inserted in the next block. This is a bit like the knapsack problem. With time, because the block reward is diminishing, the miners will only have the transaction cost to compensate them for the cost of their effort. When the block reward will be close to zero, they will not be printing new BTC anymore and will “only” have the role of securing the network.
If I got 1 satoshi for every time this is said, I would be richer than Warren Buffett by now.
Well, technically, you can't call it a Ponzi as there is no operator/hub.

It's decentralised (lol).
Yes, it is now. It wasn't intended that way. Shame on Satoshi. Whats wrong with that boy? He or she or they or whatever its origin forgot to factor greed and slimebags of the world into the equation. 
Shorts will get REKT again soon, they always do.
not at all, the fees are doing the ATMs in, at the moment.
Too late at this price.
How many shrubs does 1 BTC go for these days?  About 10,000?
I doubt that it will get much lower. We're at the 400 day EMA, which was the barrier during the last two drops. We might overshoot a little, $6800 is being thrown around, and I find that possible.

But 6k? I highly doubt that.
Sent 5 btc
Is this your private key? 
Because the price makes him feel sad as he is at a loss, but coming here makes him optimistic.
Yes. Having as little information as possible has always been a sound strategy.  Especially for volatile investments.  
low 6Ks and high 5Ks is where the strong support has been. That's probably where it's gonna stop dropping and people start buying. But since we've already been there recently, if we visit that again, there could be less confidence this time around, and we could end up a little lower.
20k is the highest btc will ever be.  Its slowly downhill from now on.
Gandhi liked Hitler and called Hitler, my dear friend. 
Roger that... continuous prodding...
Yep, I think they should be bagging it for another day. 
Im waiting to buy back in, if i did today i would get 20&#37; more BTC for my money than before. Tell me again how that is the "wrong" way to BTC? 
If you had an investment portfolio of a million dollars in ANY asset class, your portfolio would swing by thousands of dollars on a daily basis

Edit for math: I'm a few drinks in. Weekly basis is probably more accurate 
I'm not a millionaire yet (and I'm not relying on crypto to make me one) and this temporary loss of funds isn't pissing me off. I invested money I can live without so I don't lose sleep over dips.
Lol should've added a new line. 
There, fixed

Thanks Obama

If it has no intrinsic value why ppl paying 7k to get one? 
thats is the case since Jan
For every seller there is a buyer.

It's just that the sellers are willing to part with their BTC at a lower price than the market price for some reason.

The seller makes it go down because they are selling. Without sellers no buyer can get BTC \(bar mining it\).

Buyers cannot make the price go down \(they'll drive it up\), Sellers can.

So why a seller is selling bellow market price? or even below what they purchased it for?

the loosing sellers:

1\) Fear, they fear that BTC is going any lower and that they'll be the bagholders and no one wants to be the bagholder.

2\) Because they need money and BTC is the last of their liquidity so they have to sell/spend it at the current value even if its a loss.

3\) late comer that need the money.

The winning sellers,

1\) they've purchased those BTC at a lower price than they are selling it even it it's below current market price and they don't believe it will go any higher and don't want to be the bagholder if they feel like BTC is overevaluated.

2\) They are still selling with a profit and don't believe in any more profit and they are parting their BTC because they need the liquidity for a better performing asset whatever it might be.

3\) Long time Hodler that need the money.

Once we run out of late comer that need the money AND long time hodler that need the money. The BTC will just be recirculating and stabilise at some value that the miner will agree to spend energy \(money\) to secure the network at.
Not just the banks but also the cost of energy needed to melt gold down and recast into new ones should be taken into account and you would see the energy consumption by Bitcoin is moot compared to the traditional methods.
Thanks! #weaponized
Maybe we need to put into meme an accurate account of energy and money spent by banks to secure the status\-quo payment methods?

Because if people like John Gruber are arguing this as a problem, it's not gonna be #goodforbitcoin, no?
wtf’s a spamer... r u a bcashboy son?

Islam is not a race and all Mr Robinson was doing was showing massive rape gangs the main stream media would not. How are you for Bitcoin and banning freedom of speech is the real question?
Yeah the sell wall is weak as hellllll, will rocket once volume picks back up 
Thanks mom, but you have no idea if I'm investing $10 per paycheck or $100 or $10,000.

Don't assume.
I stay away from bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies. They are like ebola or plague. 
I agree with you brudda
Why do you think so?
Yeah, sell all your BTC now, why are you even here posting things? :)
[deleted]
Dude.. 
Hmmm.... OK
Only about 10 USD - I might buy a few to support the cause.  It might actually do well.

Edit: removed one word
Wow you're edgy
Pissed at the thought of it? Same here. 
Even at 9k it's a bad decision to sell. A rally can happen at any time now. Selling means risking missing it.
Actually, Bitcoin *trading* 101 would have you sell in a bear market. 
> Grow up

Where's the fun in that? 😄
Not calling anyone out. Believe me \- no kid here. Tired of it too and done on purpose now.
Read this guy’s comment history. He’s a sick puny fuck. 
I want all the lambo/moon crypto bros to lose their ass. After that I could care less. 
keep in mind when you are talking to eternal pessimists they actually dislike success and thrive on chaos. i think quite a few people in here would like to see it all burn simply because it would harm other people. school shooter mentality just down a notch 
It's the definition of a Ponzi Scheme in its purest form.  If the bottom drops completely out of crypto alts, it fits  perfectly.
Actually, I think it is the greatest Ponzi Scheme of all because, unlike Bernie Madoff, Satoshi's real identity is unknown.
transfer funds on coinbase, move them on gdax (instant & free), buy the coins without fees thanks to limit orders. So yes, gdax best thanks to coinbase...
He did not say at the moment, he says he's going to get in when it's 1.3k
needs cpr.
The issue is that at some point or another, that BTC has to be converted to FIAT. At the lowest possible level, this will be at the stage of property tax. Why would the vendor take the financial hit of conversion to FIAT?
> GBP to Euro would be 3-4%

for large sums, the fees are usually around 0,02%
I'm nobody. 
The average joe doesn’t know about the technology or understand the product/service. I don’t think we get to the moon without widespread support and adoption. 
You shouldn't invest in something on the hope's of a glass being half full, or empty for that matter \( shorting \). A lot more due diligence than that should be done before any sort of investment is made. 
Father! Is it...over? 
Seems very close to me. Don't you see the signs? It refused to give in to the bears, the 6k flag bears wave is not happening. A rally is in the oven and it's gonna be big. It will be short lived as a lot of weak hands who bought at the big december hype wave will want to dump, but you'll have the chance to sell some of your BTC to rebuy later.
That's just my opinion. I'm not a financial advisor so please do your own research. 
Tom Lee has been making successfule investments for years mate :)
That guy is spreading fud. The entire market cap of tether is less than 2% of Bitcoin. The whole damn thing could be insolvent and it wouldn't be as bad as they make it out to be. Bitfinex also makes so damn much money off that Exchange even if there were some Shenanigans last year there's no way they're going to let it unwind completely. It would kill their Cash Cow. Like even if you assume the worst case scenario of them double spending they could easily refund that account with enough time. That's just not a happy-go-lucky scenario either it's simply more profitable
Printing Tether to buy BTC and raise its price. No more printing, no more buying and shit keep spiraling down. 
Tether has been artificially pumping BTC since Feb 2017. When it got audited and stopped pumping in January of this year, that was when BTC collapsed. They printed more tether to pump it than any time in December which made it go to 20k
what?
Isn't that what mining is; confirming the transaction as real?
Thanks, great explanation.
Decentralized*
Of course not.

Satoshi was just trying to fleece his local pizza shop for some cheap pizza.  Never intended it to be like this.
Probably, that's why timing is important.

In the meantime, the longs got rekt'ed.

Goes both ways so not sure why you gloat over it.
Hasn't your Mom sent you to bed yet?

You see - if your trading is so good - why do you spend all your time trolling here?

I know you've already been banned from r/btctrading.

Seriously, I will tell your Mom.
It's an address using the old non-segwit format. Since he's a redditor for 6 days, I'm going to assume he thinks someone is going to send him free Bitcoin. No one has, which is good.
Not any more...
That's a bingo
Good :)  Hopefully he will be feeling good from the price and here soon.
Try: The reality is that BTC is dying.

But this sub pumps it up to try and desperately keep hope alive.
Trust me, the more you look at the price, the more biased your actions will be, and the more stress you'll go through.
Well, another and better buying opportunity then. Will buy more if that happens, and would feel like a whale accumulating
On point.
To nullify your first action, not to double it lmao
Nice
Im not holding your bag, im keeping it..
Because people are desperate for fast gains without any vision and stability as you can see it from here (e.g. lambos, moon etc.). 
greed and hope, and hope is about to be gone :) you silly
There's so much wrong here I'm actually impressed.
Sellers are not selling below market price, whatever a seller sells for, at the instant if the transaction, that is market price.

It's up to him to come with this argument for his point to have any meaning? Why didn't he made his research to the end, was he afraid to find that Bitcoin was more eco\-friendly than the status\-co?

e.g. "These LED lightbult of X lumen that are menacing to replace my energy saving vapor of mercury lightbulb are sucking so many watts if we take into account all of the LED lightbult around the world !!!"

this argument only provide the consumption of the LED lightbulb on the table and the sheer amount of them globally. It doesn't provide the global energy consumption that the vapor of mercury lightbult need to produce the same amount of lumen. Nor does it provide any argument on the eco\-friendlyness or lack of toxicity of the vapor of mercury lightbulb and only say "these are energy savings lightbulb"

Does the LED industry has to come up with the burden of proof that vapor of mercury lightbult are less efficient than the newly introduced LED? that the LED is more eco\-friendly and less toxic than vapor of mercury lightbult?

Is it the responsability of the purchaser of a new technology to make an informed decision on what lightbulb technology to buy at a certain moment?

I think that the free market will stabilise and choose the winner.
That is something everyone should be paying attention to.  Once the bears run out of coins, the price is going to shoot back to 9k again.
I don't need to know, yet I can infer that it's definitely not 4 figures, and you would be dumb to "invest" anything at all given your financial situation. 
I think you mean gambling. 
Why do you hang out in bitcoin subreddit then?
Or you live with your mom and have no money. Sad life to come here to bash other people's investments.
What?
It's a tired phrase, but once again points to flaws in the decentralized and uninsured system that is crypto. 
No doubt who’s ever behind this is brilliant 
No, I think it's called zero tolerance for that kind of horseshit. 
The last rally looked like an attempt to create panic sell. A weak one tho.
Wrong, you accumulate more cheap coins in a bear market, and sell when high when the rally comes. Buy low, sell high, you know?
And why would you want that? Who hurt you so badly?
lmao comparing trolling a subreddit to school shooters 
so satoshi who was likely hal, now frozen has been running a ponzi from cryo? absolutely no one in the early days knew it would catch on like this. as long as people believe something has value it does. a rare comic book can be 100k usd all day. if you're just a pessimist like many of the others here complaining isn't going to change the minds of hardly anyone. if we didn't see bitcoin as a monetary system we wouldn't be using it 
That means nothing. The facts they left an half job that is still in need to be completed and not yet decently implementable after 10 years are a better topic for your accusations xD
B\-I\-N\-G\-O

Retailers currently pay 3% fees on credit card sales. I think Bitpay charges 1%? 

Nevertheless, there is little incentive for consumers to make payments with bitcoin instead of a credit card. The only exceptions are purchases for gray market or illegal products, but other currencies have better fungibility than Bitcoin for such transactions.

This is why Btrash is such a joke. It literally has no use-case whatsoever.

IMO, Bitcoin has a competitive advantage in the area of cross-border money transfers because it avoids banks' currency conversion fees, which from personal experience can amount to up to 8% above market rate.
Because he/she accepts the amount of BTC that they are happy with which will obviously exceed by a small margin the amount that they would get in fiat
True
I agree. It will come, but it will take time.
Sorry dude. I was just trolling the troller. Serious Meter was about a 2 there 
What do you mean by that? 😅
Moon will never happen again
It will drop. Only needs a few more dollars
It's not the Tether cap that is the problem, it's the other markets where USDT is being used. For example, Bitfinex does not distinguish USD from USDT. It's the same thing for them. This means that in the USD/BTC pair, USDT is used to buy Bitcoin. This is blaint market manipulation and most likely, fraud.
Let's stop ignoring the fact that Tether accounts for the majority of daily BTC trades.  BTC/Tether daily trade is 10x bigger than the entire GDAX daily trade.

https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/#markets
Well, that's not true.  They have never stopped printing and neither were they ever audited.

In fact, they just printed another $250m

https://cointelegraph.com/news/tether-mints-250-mln-of-new-usdt-tokens-rekindles-controversy
Better put on a bigger tinfoil hat son. Your head is too big for it.
But Tether never got audited. They ceased relations with the company hired for such.
Transaction request -> Transaction data + Transaction fee -> Transaction data added to block -> Mining -> block added to blockchain -> Transaction confirmation + new BTC

That's my limited understanding
Decentralised is correct. The Queen's English is the true original vision of the English language. American English is not English as it didn't stay true to its original whitepaper. 

Decentralised (I'm in an ex-British colony)
lol
r/btctrading?  I don't even go there, what are you talking about?

I know you are fascinated with me but the feeling is not mutual.


Most people here should have at least some bitcoin, or else they wouldn't be here.
I love that expression.

Never heard it.  But I like it.
If you can't look at the price without freaking out, it's a good sign you are gambling money you can't bear to lose or you are investing with no real strategy.

Invest and hold is a fine strategy when you have strong historical data supporting that move, like the DJIA:

http://www.macrotrends.net/1319/dow-jones-100-year-historical-chart

But when you have very limited history, and you are dealing with disruptive technologies, investing and holding becomes less sound.

I don't think anyone knows enough about BTC to buy and forget it yet.


Stopped at an odd number of pokes.  We’re good 
So as long as there will be desperate people Bitcoin will have some value? Are we going to get more of them in the future or everyone gets this vision and Bitcoin disappears? 
If intrinsic value is how you measure things please explain to me how the US dollar is the most powerful thing in the world? If that one is too deep why don't we try Fantastic Four issue 1 from the 60s? It's worth like $100,000 right now or I could translate that into gold if that's how you see money I'm not quite sure?

You know why I think money has value? Because we believe it does. That goes for the US dollar that goes for gold and it goes for Bitcoin along with Fantastic Four issue 1. Those things all have value because people believe they do.
Well there is always a spread between potential buyer and seller *before* a transaction occur. At the time of the transaction the market price will be updated. Then there will be a new spread between potential buyer and seller.

Let's say there is a willing buyer at x and a willing buyer at x-10
no transaction is being made because they don't agree on the price.

A buyer has to buy at the price of the seller.
Or a seller has to agree on the price of the buyer.

Ohhhh I see, so what you’re saying is the only people who should be investing are people who make more than what I make! 

Shucks!
 Better luck next time? I need to be less poor!

You’re so full of shit. You have no idea what my financial situation is. 

Go eat a hamburger and die of cancer.

Yeah gambling on my decentralized uncensorable internet money protocol.

Sounds like you have no fucking clue what is what.


I run a real business that brings in real money. 
Admit it you guys all for crypto but in the end, you all want to exit with fiat money:) That's why you are all obsessed with bitcoin's price in... usd:)  that alone proves that fiat money > crypto. 
it's called a dead cat bounce
No, you sell when you think the price will go lower and buy back at a lower price. You can either do this with you own cash or on the margin. That's trading, you thinking about investing. Totally different strategy.
Crypto killed my parents. 

In all honesty I know crypto bros in real life and they are annoying as shit. The whole bitcoin culture is like a cult. 
He has deep regrets for not having bought at $30
It's really not that far apart. People that get off on trolling and harming others don't usually stop with small time things. They push it and push it until they get pushed back. Some people might stop with a little internet trolling but as we have found out a lot of people like to push it further. Their lives are so miserable that the only thing they know how to do is try and spread that misery to others. I don't think you trolling type realize how destructive being this way is on your own mind. The laughs that you get are actually programming yourself to get off on negativity. You're enjoying things that should repulse you
The fact that you have to say "who was likely hal" proves my point.  What have you purchased with Crypto?  The vast majority of companies that are accepting it do so as a publicity stunt.  Let's say you owned a Lamborghini dealership and actually accepted Bitcoin.  When someone purchased a car with Crypto, would you keep the Crypto or convert back to fiat as soon as possible to avoid the downside risk of losing your profit or even more?  For instance, lets say you sold a $400k Lambo a month ago with $60k in profit.  You held on to the crypto and instead of being up $60k, you are now down $40k.  I am one who believes big government and big banks have far too much control over our lives and would like to see an alternative succeed but doubt it ever will.  Sure there is value in blockchain but ultimately, the tech is free.  Crypto will be regulated by big governments one way or the other whether users want it to be or not.  I currently have no skin in the game but I made the Ponzi Scheme statement to get people to think.  If it sounds to good to be true...
Scrambling the words would probably make more sense. Geez man \- get the GED.
That, he might be able to rent a place with a portion of the value of his house untill BTC drop to 1.3K.

That is some way of shorting BTC, he'll get liquidated if he's renting long enough and if he run out of fiat he get at the BTC rate of today before BTC drop to 1.3k. \(asuming he want to buy a house back at some point\).

Once BTC drop to 1.3k and you buy all the BTC you can with the left over money you have. What makes you think that BTC will not go down any further? How much time do you think will be needed for the BTC to go back up for you to purchase a significantly bigger house \(in my country, price of real estate just increase as time goes by\)

No matter what the BTC value might be at your point of entry, Only get into the market with money you're able to hold on in BTC without needing it for everyday life \+ planned and unplanned spending. You'll be sad if you are forced to liquidate below your point of entry and later see that you have wisely invested but didn't had the means to hold on to it.
yes of course that's the way to the lambo life


So the purchaser is overspending?
You did well. That "you're" always triggers me too
A biblical reference.

If it's never going to happen again, why are you on the Bitcoin sub? What's your interest in a dying asset?
I don't doubt there are some kind of shenanigans but there is no evidence to figure out exactly how many or what type. Unless they are audited no one really knows so you're guessing either direction. The only thing we know for sure is if they do something to compromise their entire Exchange all these millions of dollars a year they make are gone
It's the classic deaf/blind/mute monkeys scenario.

People here are so scared that either they will ignore or attack anyone who post what is obvious.
You have no idea how much of that is hedging, day trading, really anything. High volume does not necessarily mean high fraud. In fact you can reasonably conclude with what the market cap of tether is a lot of that trading is already heavily in Bitcoin and just shifts back and forth. I mean I know you have an opinion and like most people on the internet you have no interest in any other opinions you just want confirmation of your own but really the facts don't support it. Not completely anyway
I apologized once. 
My apologies. 
Heh.  So why don't you head over there to discuss your 10 USD trades?

They are experts like you!  (*cough*)
That's irrelevant to what I said, but okay.
I do look at the price when I am interested in that. I am a long term holder who has been buying Bitcoin - and only buying - since 2014. I am merely giving advice to you as you seemed concerned with daily price action.
*Poke*

See?  It moved.

.... it moved up $3.  Damn, I'm good.
That, my friend, is the $T question that everyone wants to know.
It's a psychological cycle. If you look at how long a lot of these Reddit accounts have been active it's like 3 months. You have a lot of people who probably bought when the price was quite a lot higher and now they are feeling despair which is the last part of the bear cycle. Usually once they sell there is a feeling of relief. At that point they may remain pessimistic as doing so helps them justify what they did. Around that point in time the price usually turns around and begins to go up again. Then they experience the next thing. Disbelief. I could keep going with this cycle but it happens again and again and again throughout history. Personally I believe the Bitcoin story is going to do one of two things. It's either going to go one hell of a lot higher or it's on its way to zero. Even if it is on its way to zero that's not going to happen anytime soon. You may notice none of the big money investors are heading for the door. Retail investors are taking off but you don't hear about the Winklevoss twins selling. Hell they are probably buying. Beings this Market is unregulated I can tell you with a fairly High degree of certainty the way it would end. Another price run will take place and it will go above the last. It's hard to say how much but probably at least 25,000. While that Euphoria is building and when we take out those previous highs a lot of people are going to come into the market. That's exactly where you will see the big holders begin to push their coins and sell off. The last thing those people are going to do is unload into a bear market
every ponzi disappears.. you don't recall tulips and beanies? right?
I know it's at the point where you're unable to afford buying bitcoin until your next pay check, and that seems like a pretty unstable and dumb thing to use your funds on, but hey, it's your money. I don't eat meat, but thanks. 
You are not buying the protocol, you are buying a fraction of a unit of said money, who's price is not bound to anything technical.

Furthermore, there are groups of people manipulating the price so that in the long run they win and you lose, just like the house in a casino.
How do you know they're not money coming from cashing out btc. Such an half thinking
Sorry to tell you this but your lemonade store in front of your mom's house isn't a real business.
Cool.

Yes, most of us are in for the money.  Isn't that rather obvious when 80% of the posts are about the price.
Of course we're here for the money. However, I fully believe in the technology and can't wait until it's adopted so I can use it as it was intended. 
That looked different, too vertical, as if someone bought and then sold once a bit fomo kicked in
Why would you wish bad on strangers? You're obviously a shit person and deserve "whatever happened to your parents" to happen to you as well. 
or to keep the 300 to 400 bitcoins i mined by experiment on my laptop at around 2007/8
Well said. 
I think the bottom line is if more people feel like you do this whole project will collapse. Pessimism will Doom everything it touches. This project can very easily succeed in one of two ways. One is a store of value and the other is a digital Cash System. In order for number 2 to happen the value of each coin has to be a hell of a lot higher than it is. That will draw in more investment and more development . regulation absolutely has to happen. If we continue in this death spiral it's likely you're going to read a news article that Goldman Sachs changed their mind about setting up a crypto desk. You're going to see the 200-plus hedge funds start to close up. Then it might be a race for the door between the big money investors like the Winklevoss twins. If that happens the project is over. But it doesn't have to go that way. Development can continue. People are worried about how the regulations are going to go right now. You also have the question on when the lightning network is going to be fully operational and out of the beta phase. You don't even really need a firm date on that you just need progress to continue to happen. Personally I really want to see this project succeed. I love the idea behind it.
Keep on the topic
what i don't understand why would anybody do this with bitcoin? Do this with big tech companies who are bulking of cash, have a low PE ratio, hold it for decades and see your money explode in value
Honest mistake. I rarely proofread and autocorrect is a SOB
🤗
I think he saw the moon; could be wrong tho.

https://youtu.be/9HyzHb2qPjQ
Haha nice one!!! Well let's hope so... I am actually more than ready for the return of the bulls!
Because it's an interesting sub.  The value of a currency shouldn't be expected to rise so dramatically. So I watch 
Yes, I doubt if anyone knows how far down the rabbit hole this goes.

And ultimately, the price impact is still up to the market to decide.  

Even if there's a real prosecution and Tether goes up in smoke, the market may still decide to ignore it and the price remains intact.
By obvious, do you mean your constant rhetoric to support your short position? Pretty hypocritical to talk about tether/market manipulation when you are in here attempting to do the same. Save your breath.
Well, look at it this way.  A 'normal' trade volume is about 5%-10% of circulation.  BTC is around that as are most cryptos and even stocks.

Tether's circulation is $2.5B but their daily trade is $2.6B (more than 100%).  What does that tell you?  It does nothing but is used to wash trade by a few individuals to bring up the prices of other cryptos.
We agree on a lot of things (reading your comments all the time) but just don't let little kids fuck you up. Be the bigger man and leave the discussion for what it is. If we keep reacting this kindergarten will never stop.
I have never claimed to be anything near an expert nor that I'm good at trading.

Go see a shrink.  Your posts are saying that you have a low self esteem, which leads to a tendency to attack anyone that you think is successful (even if it's just your imagination).
>>I know it's at the point where you're unable to afford buying bitcoin until your next pay check,

You don't **know** shit about my finances. Again, you're assuming I don't have money until next paycheck. That's your assumption, just like I assumed you ate meat because your comments are like colon cancer.

Knowing =/ assuming.


>Furthermore, there are groups of people manipulating the price so that in the long run they win and you lose, just like the house in a casino.

Casino games have endings. 

Buying btc and hodling has no ending.

Added with the fact that I've only been investing what I'm willing to lose each month, I don't care if they manipulate the price. In fact I'm hoping they can keep it lower for a couple of months so I can accumulate more.

Remember if you're 100% staying in Fiat, you're also playing the game btw. Fiat in banks let's them leverage our money for risk taking in the stock markets, when they lose we bail them out, printing more dollars and devaluing our own. When they win they get the profits. And when they lose they are too big to fail so they break even, or make profits anyways. I'm done playing that game.

I understand the BTC rules the rules are open source, I like them better than FIAT which has closed source rules, so I'm buying more btc and leaving fiat progressively.

ROFL!!
I don't like markets that can be controlled by 'someone' 

>You're obviously a shit person

I won't argue that. 

>and deserve "whatever happened to your parents" to happen to you as well.

They're living happily into their old age in retirement. Thanks for the well wishes. 

Sorry dude. Really. To say most people who post here are a bit on edge lately would be an understatement. No reason to talk shit. Apologies.
Let's say BTC finally get mainstream and is used as a currency or medium of exchange. BTC finally get stable at x USD and doesn't move anymore than \+\-0.5&#37; on a monthly basis and is unafected by the news because everyone knows that it isn't going to the moon and isn't going to be banned because it's now legit for everyone everywhere.

A lot of people might still have some BTC they've purchased significantly more \(x in this exemple\). These will be the final bagholders and will never recoup their "investment".

What will the value of x be? but it has to converge to a stable value no matter what this value may be or no one will use it for anything else than a speculative asset.

For the moment if you want to use it as a currency, you have to spend and replenish for BTC to artificially be stable for you. For this use case, depending on your country you'll be spending more money and time doing it than using traditionnal debit card or cash valued in FIAT.

I don't think any legitimate business will use any liquidity to do this. They will use their liquidity to do business wise decision like pumping it into R&D to develop their next product that'll put them ahead of the competition, buy another company whose product offering will help them against their competitors, pay dividend to their shareholder to had value into owning a share in the company and keep the value of their share high, ...

I don't think the shareholder of big tech companies will appreciate having the liquididy of the company being used recklessly and this will be visible in the quarterly/yearly results and will drive the value of the share to the ground.
Exactly
Another monkey.

Anyway, I closed my short yesterday.  And if you think that what you or I write here on Reddit has any impact on the price, you are a moron.
Wash trading I'm sure. Speed trades. Lot of day traders but it still doesn't give any evidence of how deep it goes. This news has been out nearly 6 months already 
Agreed.
You guys and your lovers quarrel. 
If you had money to buy now why would you wait for your next paycheck to come in and made your original comment? Yeah...you wouldn't. I wasn't insulting you I was giving you actual advice.
> I understand the BTC rules the rules are open source..

First, the rules for fiat money and the stock market is open source... it's called the law.  Those assets are more complicated than BTC.  Perhaps that's why you feel it's more "open".

Second, fiat/stocks are not only regulated, but are protected by their rules.  If someone robs your bank, the FDIC insures your loss.  If someone lies in a report to shareholders, they can be prosecuted and sued.

The dollar is accepted everywhere and is far more stable in value than a BTC.

The stock market has a 100 year track record of making money. Also the stock market is a complex body of investments, allowing for diversification.  People with different levels of risk (i.e. a new investor vs someone retiring) can change their mix intelligently. 

So BTC is not a better currency.  And BTC is not a replacement for a properly diversified wealth growth strategy.

So that leaves you with two real uses -- BTC can be 1 piece of a wealth development strategy, and it can be an instrument for speculation.

You have admitted you aren't using it for method #1 -- so all that is left is gambling, whether you want to admit it or not.
"crypto killed my parents" care to reiterate?
It doesn't mean it was meant to be a scam. They could have dead meanwhile, or it could be a way to give anyone time to jump in before the price gets too high, etc. Many possible reasons. I still think it will reach 50k.
Agree - there is nothing new here.
Because I set limit orders dude, not market orders. 

IDGAF what the price is currently at, my limit orders are way below that price so I don't need the money right away.

Again let me go back to my earlier point on how fiat money isn't open source. There is no LAW as to how the Federal Reserve is supposed to operate. There was also nothing in the law that said the banks were too big to fail, these are major concerns. Main street got sold out, wall street got bailed out. 

>Second, fiat/stocks are not only regulated, but are protected by their rules. If someone robs your bank, the FDIC insures your loss. If someone lies in a report to shareholders, they can be prosecuted and sued.

First off, the laws were written thanks to lobbying on the part of wall street. Just because corporate buy backs are legal, doesn't mean I want to play that game anymore.
In a nutshell, stock repurchases or "buybacks" are just a way for corporations to pay executives and other employees at the stockholder's expense. At first glance it looks like companies are paying money to loyal shareholders when they buy back shares of stock. However, don't forget that companies also give stock options to executives and other employees, and these options end up putting new shares of stock back in to the market. When an executive exercises his stock options, he is essentially getting brand new shares of stock for an older, lower price, and then immediately selling them to the market at the higher current market price.

That's all legal, and it's bullshit.

>The dollar is accepted everywhere and is far more stable in value than a BTC.

Might be accepted everywhere but the stability of the dollar is an illusion, otherwise I could buy a Ford for 1922 prices.

>So BTC is not a better currency. And BTC is not a replacement for a properly diversified wealth growth strategy.

BTC is not just a currency, but regardless if you're so sure it's just tulip-mania, then you should short it.

>You have admitted you aren't using it for method #1 -- so all that is left is gambling, whether you want to admit it or not.

Call it gambling, IDGAF. I'm voluntarily investing my money in btc, and I've yet to lose money. My experience with gambling is people tend to drink alcohol, play a game and lose money.
Nah
By day, he is u/HAHA_ButtCoin. By night, he becomes the market-capped crusader... BITMAN!
Yes, me too. Time will tell.
The performance of stocks in the aggregate is well established.  What you think about individual stock situations is irrelevant to your ability to use them to create wealth for your future self.

As for inflation, there are real economic reasons (i.e. GDP growth) that cause it. The value of our money is actually tied to productivity and trade, unlike BTC:

If BTC actually attained supremacy and started being used for real country-to-country trade, it would suffer inflation just like the dollar does.

As for you not losing money, that would mean you have been buying bitcoin slowly for a long time, or that you made a large BTC purchased before the spike.  
Either way it proves nothing about the value of BTC as an investment going forward, especially given the fact that it's been tanking for months.



You said I was gambling when I bought btc, yet you have no idea what my purchasing strategy is.

Gambling sounds a lot like what you wish it were, I'm assuming you hold no coins?





BTC is deflationary, there is no reason it would inflate because the number of btc asymptotically approaches 21 million. In 2 years the next halvening will happen and half as many bitcoins will be mined per block, and then we'll have another halvening 4 years after that. Deflation.

This is the opposite of fiat, which is just a parabola unbound by asymptotes.

Let me restate this concept. Bitcoin is hard to understand **because** it's at the intersection of 

1. Game Theory
2. Cryptography
3. Computer Networking and Data Transmission
4. Economic and Monetary Theory.  

So when you're criticizing btc you're going to have to criticize the other aspects as well, like encryption and privacy features, scalability issues. It's not just a currency bound by economics. It's an asset, a store of value.. increasingly seen as global hedge precisely because of the way it is. 

All four of those things apply to modern banking/markets based on dollars.

The only special feature of BTC is decentralization (which implicitly enables anonymity, scalability and independence from central authority).

Those are great things, but those things also have costs.  I.e. theft and price manipulation is hard or impossible to rectify because it's hard to figure out who did what and where.  And there is no governing body to which you can go for recourse.

I don't need to be anonymous.

Established markets are scaled fine for my purposes.

And I can neither escape, nor do i care about, centralization.  I have to report my income, bitcoin or not.  I am law-abiding, i don't need to mask any transactions.  And the FDIC actually gives me a degree of financial security which i appreciate.

It's fine to believe in blockchain -- but don't try to give me bullshit arguments about BTC in it's current form being better for me than dollars.  That is nonsense.





Your needs to not be anonymous do not translate to the rest of the world, where people live in autocratic dictatorships, or where their government is continually debasing their currency week after week (Venezuela, Argentina.. etc).

Furthermore, you must understand game theory, cryptography, computer networking, data transmission, economic and monetary Theory better than the rest of the world which has looked at bitcoin's code, therefore you should be shorting bitcoin am I right? Because dollars are obviously superior than bitcoins right?

It's not like bank accounts could be frozen at the drop of a hat right?

Oh yes they can.

>Saudi Arabia said it has only frozen the bank accounts of individuals and not those of the companies they own or manage, as the kingdom seeks to ease tension among global investors over a crackdown that’s seen princes and billionaires arrested.

>The action, described by Saudi authorities as an anti-corruption drive, applies only to individual accounts held by “persons of interest,” and not to corporate ones, Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority Governor Ahmed Abdulkarim Alkholifey said in a statement on Tuesday. “It is business as usual for both banks and corporates,” he said, adding that there are no restrictions on money transfers “through proper banking channels.”

>The arrests, which included Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, one of the world’s richest men and a shareholder in such global companies as Citigroup Inc. and Apple Inc., have reverberated across board rooms and financial institutions in the biggest Arab economy and globally.

>Earlier, three people with knowledge of the matter said the central bank ordered banks in the kingdom to freeze the accounts of dozens of individuals **who aren’t under arrest.** Already, as much as $33 billion in personal wealth belonging to the richest detainees has been put at risk.

Try freezing my bitcoin transactions. 

Bitcoin's can't be stolen like dollars out of bank accounts.

>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — Depositors at bailed-out Cyprus' largest bank will lose 47.5% of their savings exceeding 100,000 euros ($132,000), the government said Monday.

>The figure comes four months after Cyprus agreed on a 23 billion-euro ($30.5 billion) rescue package with its euro partners and the International Monetary Fund. In exchange for a 10 billion euro loan, deposits worth more than the insured limit of 100,000 euros at the Bank of Cyprus and smaller lender Laiki were raided in a so-called bail-in to prop up the country's teetering banking sector.

>The savings raid prompted Cypriot authorities to impose restrictions on money withdrawals and transfers for all banks to head off a run. Christopher Pissarides, the Nobel laureate who heads the government's economic advisory body, forecast Monday that the bank controls could be in place for another two years.

This can't happen with bitcoin. 

And before you say that this is all happening outside of the US, and would never happen in the US... let me remind you the entire global financial system is linked. When Greece went under we feel it here. 

>Italy’s political convulsions have raised new fears about the future of the euro, the single currency of the European Union that was introduced 16 years ago.

>The possibility, however remote, that a populist Italian government would renounce the euro and revive the lira currency has unnerved many bankers and investors. Stocks tumbled on Tuesday on the fears, and the euro fell against the dollar to its weakest level in six months.

So what happens in Italy affects the stock market here. What happens in Greece and China affects the stock market here, because algorithms and high frequency trading are the norm, and we don't have true price discovery anymore. 

Btc is a completely different animal and trying to compare it to fiat is like trying to compare CERN with a carrot. 
You're talking like you have this great overlap with both the benefits of BTC, and the negative aspects of fiat arrangements.  

I would suggest that you don't have a lot of overlap with either, and you're telling yourself you do because you want to believe it.  

You're also intentionally ignoring issues with BTC trading/theft, the potential for negative affects from government intervention, and the distinct possibility that newer cryptos are going to be disruptive to BTC in the short term future.

You need to be looking at your investments in a much more sober, pragmatic way.  Just free advice you can freely ignore.

I'm not intentionally ignoring BTC issues, I just think the issues are different than what you do. 

Having your bitcoins stolen is like having your wallet stolen. I mean this ironically: it's not a bug, it's a feature.

If some crypto comes in the future to dethrone BTC, you bet I'll be aware and shifting my investments over to it.
