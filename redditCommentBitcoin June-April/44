Daily Discussion, April 21, 2018 -- TITLE
Some profit taken, sells triggered. Yawn. No biggie. Dunno why some people are losing their shit. 
What do people expect? 500$ every day? Ofc people Close out their positions at the weekend. Lets stay above 8.5k and we will be fine for tje next week. 
Short term moving average is currently higher than long term moving average on all timescale charts on gdax.  Very bullish for bitcoin!!!
**Support The Bulls.**
**Come On Bulls!**
My gf thinks that price is heading for 9.2.

She will give further updates when she's finished washing up.

But it is looking bullish from under my duvet.
9.2k this weekend
You guys think this is just a little pull back with some people taking the profits? 
Should be an interesting day today. Even if it ends up trending down again, I think the market will be a lot more optimistic after yesterday which is a sign of good things to come
Following discussions with my nurse, I'm now all in for TittyCoin.

See ya suckers!!

er 
So the sensible money is returning to the fold.


The trend is still strong. Bitcoin will reach $ 10,000. Analysis shows that the strongest resistance is $ 10000
There's quite a bit of volume right now (Bitfinex). Which leads me to believe, whenever one party runs out of steam (bulls or bears) the resulting jump in price will be *big*.

I just can't tell which direction it will go...
Oh baby the resistance is about to wane
IT'S ALMOST NEIN THOUSAND!!!!
Volume has died off once more. Danger danger
in other news we're 3% ahead of what McAfee predicted ... lambo order pending

Honest question:

I've been following BTC and the cryptocurrency graphs, markets and news more closely for a couple of months now \- always trying to decide if/when I should buy \- and I'd like to ask a question that I know will probably be unpopular here, but absolutely legitimate.

It is said that BTC will go up a lot more in value as it becomes more widely accepted \(and traditional currencies inflate\) because it is limited in supply. McAfee literally bet his dick that each millionaire in the world would want at least one. I'd even go farther and say that a single BTC would eventually be worth more \(maybe way more\) than a million dollars each if it was the only cryptocurrency. However, looking at the almost two thousand new cryptocurrencies \- a couple quite successful among them \- I ask myself why would people rather not just use another \(maybe a similar, a clone or a different, maybe even "better" one \- though "better" is relative\) cryptocurrency instead of subjecting themselves to this much speculation with BTC's value?

So far it seems to me that BTC is \(at least since I started following it \- and, just to be clear, I'm talking about the cryptocurrency, not about this subreddit\) much more about speculation \(HODL\) than actual usage as payment \- personally, I'd never spend something that can double, quadruple or even x10\+ in value at any moment.

What I'm trying to ask is:

If the goal is to have one \(or more \- look at USD and EUR\) universally accepted decentralized \(anonymous?\) currency/payment system, what makes Bitcoin \(and no other cryptocurrency\) so special? Why would all the millionaires need/want BTC specifically \(which is what needs to happen in order for it to go so high\) instead of any other cryptocurrency who does the same \(or an even better\) job?

Good to see: in my watchlist now, 24h period:

BTC remains green, all other alts I watch red.

That was a strange day in the sun for alts.

Good for Bitcoin :)
Buy Bitcoin
what percent of the world's population owns ANY bitcoin?


get ready


How do you think bitcoin will look next week? I am waiting for some funds to hit an account. 
sneaking up on the breakout... psssst... *^don't ^scare ^it ^away*
I have spent about 25k on btc over the past 4-5 months and my current holdings is valued at 16-17k, let's say I sold my entire holdings, is that enough to make a significant impact on the price?

I have no plans to sell btw, just wondering how much of an impact my holdings would create
The market is really undecided now, on how to proceed...

Shorts are going down. I guess shorters are not so sure themselves anymore, that this will crash. Not sure if this is a good sign. I always liked to bet against the shorters...
We are about to slingshot around the earth.
Sunday dip coming?
What's your favourite:

8.9k or simply 9k?

I'm growing to rather like 8.9.  And you get more digits.

Any thoughts?
Roger Ver pumping Bcash. Sad.
I miss you Vegeta :(
**Europe & others, we need to hold this level atleast until the Americans wake up, many thanks.**
Good for Bitcoin.
Hopefully a lot of the other coin profits are now put into Bitcoin.....

BTCP is flying
6 hour chart :)
Damn experts and their TAs...   True talk, is Bitcoin going up  or will there be a correction coming?
Is it just me or has gate.io stopped withdrawals? Can someone tell me why it has happened? I just created the account to sell some ERC tokens I got from referrals...
Hello . do you see a bug on kraken?
broke down for an hour at home in France

Hey guys, I recently got into bitcoin via Coinbase and I have .5 BTC but planning on buying more. I want to move my bitcoin into a wallet. What are your suggestions ? 
Well guess thats the end of my time with coinbase, been using them since 2011.

Where should I move it to next?

Was thinking about doing a USB wallet somehow. Whats the modern way people are doing it?


Someone talk to me about 6-hour charts. Are we going to see some wild trading around 5pm est (4 central) today?
onward 
Not mad
4k by tomorrow. WHERE ARE YOU NOW
Would be good to see another proper charge in the next few days, getting to over $10k. 
everything is fine, we still up
Wow. One of you actually messaged me telling me to kill myself. Good job. No, really. We're all very proud of you.
Hopefully the Americans will get things back on track slowly, I would be happy if we finished the day around $8800-$8900.  It seems the Americans are doing all the hard work at the moment, the Rest Of The World needs to help!  :) 
most ridiculous price action 
People who wake up and sell right away are going to have a bad time. 
I think traders are now having a positive thoughts with this bull run of bitcoin but I hope it breaks the wall of 9k. Right now this improvement of bitcoin able some traders to recover from the previous crash
Come on,  11k by the end of next week keep buying
Reverse Head & Shoulders pattern finished soon. 

Now that the dandruff is gone, prepare for the next rise...
Where you at u/hodltill2020? Did you ever take that opportunity to get out at 10am MST? Or is preparation H on the shopping list?
She is getting horny again, lads. 
guys it has to come down a little more, don't think this is the bottom. Truth.
Huge sell-off coming. Was this the end of the bull run already?
LOWER
Glad i didnt fomo and buy into anything.  I saw this coming, same shit diff weekend.  Very predictable now.

We further our mission research and educational organization that develops medical, legal, and cultural contexts for people to benefit from the careful uses of medicines with bitcoin. At the moment, this is achievable. Before doing this research, we analyzed many sources and recipes that will help achieve this goal. But this is not enough. We are going to expand this research on the world level and make it legitimate to use alkaloids in medicine - according to our information this will speed up the process of recovery and open new heights in the field of science and medicine. As soon as we receive the necessary data, they will be investigated and sent to science in order to achieve the goal. Now we need the help of the community that supports it. This method of research will be more effective than the medicine used now. For us it will be a breakthrough in the field of science because now it really is necessary.
Why did you all have to jynx it with vegeta. Correction here we come. Alts just copped a brick to the face

Can someone please explain why we hate coinbase now? 
Everyone needs to GTFO coinbase right now.

If the US decides to ban BTC, coinbase will freeze everything.


Yay! It's going down!
you are all about to get barted. eat my shorts. just opened.
Good evening weekend traders, beginning another live analysis of Bitcoin price action and perhaps some trading! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T0wnpEafuE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T0wnpEafuE)

who think that this year bitcoin will try to raise, but return to lower remembering the previous years when after doubling the price fell to about 170usd?
Have you weighed it back to its historical minima? 600 usd 800?

BTC is fine, just needs to be reeled in. Shitcoins gotta shit 
Yep, the bulls must know that they can't throw all this away so easily.

Lie. Most true bitcoin traders have no girlfriends as they have fully dedicated their life to bitcoin trading...
I think there is a very good chance of that.
I think it will test 9k again. The high test at kraken was 9075. Will be interesting to see if the next test goes higher or lower.

I rose my buy stop to 9350 for now. Don't want to be stopped by a fake out just to see it crashing right afterwards (can happen at 9.3 as well, I know, but less likely). 
I also refer to bitcoin as titty coins. 
Itâ€™s all about pornhub club these days, plus I heard they come with free nuts
Up! 
i hope it will break the wall of 9 k and it will be total moonlighting
Nein, Nein, Nein!!!
DAS IST GUT
What does it mean?
I love this chart. As long as we're above the "McAffee Dick Line" I'm happy.

https://fnordprefekt.de/
this is very encouraging.  Man, imagine if McAfee is right.  We'll probably all be millionaires in a few years.
The lambo jokes are getting so old not to mention most dumbass bitcoin traders, even if they do turn millionaires, you canâ€™t just order a Lamborghini with money. You have to take a driving test, be pre-approved, have the money paid in fulll... you canâ€™t order a lambo until you already have the money. I get it youâ€™re being sarcastic and will never own a lambo but you suck all around!
I couldnt find the tempo here. but i still liked it
That one sucked. Lol
"It goes like this, the 8k, the 9k". Drop the k behind the 8 and 9. 

Hallelujah tempo seems fine.
It's a good question. I would say it has to do with people's opinions about the future of BTC. Many people believe that crypto will be the currency type of the future and that BTC will be the standard bearer because it seems to be getting more attention than others in terms of pioneer businesses accepting it as payment, etc. In other words, BTC will be more valuable in the future because people will trust its value more than other cryptocurrencies in the future, the same way that people around the world today trust the USD, EUR, and GBP more than other fiat currencies.
Your the right type of person to make money 
You see their is a great investment in crypto
Spread your investment if that is what you see is best
jump on the gravy train
not every investment is a winner in life but you only need the odd one to to be and your life jumps to a new leavel
I started with a range of crypto in the start of 2017
be just stick to be blue chip crypto stock
you need to learn more about economics, the history of money, how loans and debts work globally, and then learn how blockchain works more intimately and what exactly BTC has behind it that no other cryptos do despite its ancient tech by todays standards.


once you know it becoems cleary why it could reach such value.
To answer your question, the only relevant attribute that BTC has is it's brand value.  As the tech is open sourced, there are plenty of alts that are actually almost identical.

And while there is a lot of speculation activities on cryptos, I very much doubt they are used in real world applications at the moment.  

Yes, there are plenty of noise about BTC being the currency of the future, alternative to gold, etc but most of it are just hyperbole to justify the "value" of BTC.  Take away the noise and BTC is just a number generated on the network and any value that people put on that number is pure speculation.
Yes, we're all the same person in this thread. Except for you. It's all a great conspiracy to get you, yes you Itplanb, to buy more Bitcoin.
WhyDontYouTryIt is actually my gay alter-ego.
No.  Although I suspect we're both European.

BitcoinAlways seems to worry more about the price more than I do - I'm strictly a long term hodler.

I worry far more about Btrash and the lies surrounding it and its effects on the future of crypto.
That's when you trade in and then trade back when they're green.
A very small one, under 1% I have heard.
to..
For ?
Vegeta
Oh that's easy.

Let me tell you.

What will happen is that there will be ... fuck..I lost my internet connection again ..

This *always* happens when I am trying to advise the whole planet how to be millionaires.
It will look like Cary Grant.
50k
It wouldn't even be noticed.
Same thing happened to allot of us, just increase your volume of BTC via alts in the mean time.
It wouldnâ€™t make a noticeable impact on price. People are regularly buying and selling 1000s of BTC
Tomatoes
Don't think so look like it's getting ready to go up anytime soon 
It's 9.2 k. Zoom out a bit and you'll see why. 


Yes, there's been some serious pumping.

PLUS:

What has been under-reported is his centralised miners donating  12.5% of their funds to 'the cause.'

(by 'burning' BTrash to encourage inflation.  Burning effectively means sending their mined coins to an irrecoverable wallet.)

Link to BTrash burning:

honestly, who tf buys Bcash anyway
why would one dude pump that

A live cat bounce.
Yeah thats the only one i watch haha
yes
It appears that they are all down for maintenance.  
hardware wallet.  Trezor or Ledger Nano
Electrum is a good and secure software wallet: https://electrum.org/

I'd say, this is your best option for now.

If you want to keep your coins *really* safe, use a hardware wallet like the ledger nano s: https://www.ledgerwallet.com/products/ledger-nano-s

Although I believe that this investment only makes sense for larger amounts.

You could also use a cold wallet for safe keeping. It doesn't cost you extra, but is a little cumbersome. Here are some instructions: https://medium.com/@tednobs/how-to-create-a-secure-bitcoin-cold-wallet-82f82be4bfa
Also it may be cheaper to not fuck with coinbase theyâ€™re really evil with fees could try gdax (run by coinbase but no fees for buying) or localbitcoins (much simpler then GDAX)
I use a trezor, great for bitcoin pretty shit for other cryptos but safest option imo provided u buy it from trezor or a certified retailer
Tether. Just youtube coinbase and tether

Naw.  12 hours ago, the Kimchi Premium was 5%, a sure sign that Koreans were overbuying.  It's back down to a healthy 2%.
Why...who would actually do that? 

"Err..just woke up, time to sell some Bitcoin with my eyes closed, no need to check the market, why would I do that" 

Have been since that 1k spike in 15 min.

This would be good for bitcoin.
optimistic... i like it 
Yeah... I got screwed over pretty hard. It's ok... used to it by now.

From here on we're going up!
[deleted]
Profit taking from the day traders. Hopefully sentiment will stay the same next week and continue to build again.
Many of these alts need selling off - BTD up 70%? - mad and unsustainable.

I expect a lot of sensible money will fold back into BTC.
Hi. How do you know if there's a sell-off coming, is it based on data or a hunch?
claims to own bitcoin. yet always wishing it lower. typical lying no coiner
crippledmaniacdemon â€¢ 2 points â€¢ submitted 1 month ago
Super glad I pulled out of this shitty market.
Too right! It was bound to correct after that clear break through the downtrend line. The question is will it bounced back up off it and by how much?
The least you could do is engage in the fucking community before you shill your shit.
There are a lot of lines there.

Which one is your favourite?
We appreciate your input, many thanks.
Think your in the wrong thread bro
I'd say, that's exactly how Bitcoin was meant to be. Completely around the system, no fiat involved. 

Just do it.

I believe, the laws are not up to the task to deal with this kind of situation, yet. So I wouldn't worry. Even if you would get into trouble, it would be a very interesting lawsuit...

I mean: What are you doing? You buy some Bitcoin and instantly exchange them for goods. No problem here. The problems arise, when you wait 2 months, they gain 100% in value and then you exchange them for goods. Then you'd have to pay capital gains tax on the increased value.

Even then, it's a gray area, because you don't sell Bitcoin for fiat, but exchange them for goods.

This is a prime example of a usecase, that will keep courts and lawmakers busy in the coming years...

The danger you are personally in depends highly on the size of the transactions. If you want to buy a cellphone for Bitcoin, nobody will care. If you want to buy a multimillion dollar villa. People might suspect money laundering...

Edit: I have to add: I am not a lawyer.
Thanks in advance
They're stopping decentralization by being able to block certain vendors like WikiLeaks from accepting Bitcoin donations
I have always hated Coinbase. I will never use them. Ever. 
Why the fuck would the US ban BTC? Did I miss something? 
Yeah OK buddy.
If you want people to follow your advice atleast provide some more info
Don't be silly. you realise the US isnt the whole entire world right?
If that happens, it's not just coinbase but every exchange based in the US.  

But I very much doubt that an outright ban will happen.  A more likely scenario is that the NY investigation is able to prove that an exchange is complicit in fraudulent practises such as price manipulation or money laundering.  In such cases, yes - the government does have the authority to seize all assets the exchange owns. 
Is your .1 doing nice?ðŸ˜‚
Bart Simpson will not be enough to stop this juggernaut this time. 
Ouuuuuu bad call 
I'll just buy more then. For now it seems like we're heading towards new ATH

Wut
Washing up completed.  Gf's off to her yoga for 2 hours.  

Maid will be here here in 5 minutes for 1 hour.

If I get this right, I can research TTC.
It's steady at the moment, I will be happy with $8800-$8900 for a little while. 
If we keep this momentum up we'll be at $12k before the end of the month. May is going to be huge. 
Means it's week-end and some people should just farking relax already.

What an utterly useless response. The man (woman, dinosaur, whatever) is here with intelligent questions, trying to learn.  Your response is "yeah, you should learn about money and bitcoin, then you'll know."

This is a prime example of why your mother doesn't love you.
Lol ... sure :).

So a pseudo currency that is created from thin air (like fiat), with it's value speculated on unregulated exchanges and traded around by a niche group will change the global economic model?   

Look, the speculation is fun, I have made some money but let's not kid ourselves about it's impact or value.
I'm a long term hodler.

9.2 is very *woody*:

I'm not going to lie here, if that community is that commited I may buy some and sell it all at the next ATH seems like a scam coin that if you get in early enough and get out soon enough, you could make some sexy profits
[deleted]
I feel the same as you do about team evil. However they own so much of the supply that it would make pumping very easy I would imagine. I just get the feeling in the back of my head that Rodger would throw whatever he could add it to make the price higher and try and draw people in. Hopefully the reality is people would just use that for a selling opportunity and dump into the pump
I do!
ego
Trezor is expensive.

Why not store everything offline in a USB?
Tether? Are you kidding?
Whoâ€™s mans is this smh tether can fuck right off
They are locking accounts.

The entire purpose of BTC is to have control of your own money.

Coinbase lost my trust. 
Either, whatever works. 

EDIT: I suppose I prefer something with 2FA so someone cant break in and steal it.

Theyd need to break in and hold me hostage too.
Great job. First factually accurate post lol. I decided to not do it. Whoop dee fucking doo. XD
Yeah. I'm actually a little upset by it.

Dude, it dropped down to 82-somthing, like I said it would, that should have been enough to cover fees. 

Why the hell did you not get out?
I've learned to ignore him all together. Still love him though.
Guys...
there's the 1k candle and 1D chart EMA crossover so yeah shouldn't be more than that 
10%+ growth in only 1-3 days is not sustainable, and any humans involved will hedge their bets (especially the day traders). It will consolidate and start again, hopefully still bullish.
Showed you the screenshot. .189. Do you ever say anything that's factually true?
Great job. First factually accurate post lol. I decided to not do it. Whoop dee fucking doo. XD
He used to pretend he was a fan of his own youtube channel " hey guys this guy is amazing hes going live ive been following for weeks hes spot on" then we called him on his bullshit haha
But only barely. Alkaloids and Bitcoin share quite a big userbase.
Here is a cultural community that unites all the ideas of use. And despite your high rating this does not give you the right to act as a negative. And we were not mistaken in the choice of sending a message because this section corresponds to our goal.
I agree with this, a lot depends on the size of the transactions.  I would say if you are buying the odd thing here or there no one will care but if you start buying items worth over say $500 and a lot of them, then it could start looking a bit dodgy.
Bastards. I've been alarmed by some FUDders in this thread that my bitcoin is at risk by being left in the coinbase wallet. True? 
No, it's FUD.  But it is true that the NY Attorney is investigating the operations of the exchanges.
We dont need another Mt Gox. GET OUT
Yep, need a wallet.

liquidation is at 9376. eat my shorts
Right, because a 2k rise over the course of a month while still being down 12k from ATH is a clear indicator of a major breakthrough to new highs.

Confirmed: my maid now recommends TittyCoin.

All looking very bullish from here.

Hello, do you think the momentum continues or we will see a valuable fall? I imagine that everyone is going to want to make their profits?
i dont have time, i would be writing for over an hour and i dont owe him anything. 

The information is out there, that was my point.  dont personally attack me because i have better things to do and still wanted to give a small lead.  

btw that was a super lame one liner even for reddit standards. jesus. If you are that upset i didnt elaborate may i jsut ask why you even care about a strangers opinion? if you struggle to get the bigger picture too just DYOR, its the only way you will ever understand blockchain and the ecosystems governing it, not from one reddit person explaining
im not interested in deconstructing the intimate details of all of this. its 4AM and you are a reddit stranger.  

you can have ur opinion, its fine. me having an opposite one really shouldn't upset you or make you question your own in such a way.  

But this is a bigger picture thing, the direction society is going in technology, financially, the past trends and economics and their similarities and parallels, along with the very technology of blockchain itself, and crypto currencies independently of them. its very big, and this is infancy. it might be unrecognizable soon, like internet in 1985. you need to see the bigger picture and try to link it together, and then you see potential, as i said. potential.    

your life as you know it today, will seem prehistoric in 20 years from now. realise this. in terms of money(as a small mundane part of the massively different world you will live in), cash is not even likely to exist

like i said, no time or energy to spend hours debating and explaining all of these with reddit strangers. DYOR and thinking.
same person confirmed 
science
There's not much action on both sides because nobody knows whats going on but only because we have showed signs of being bullish the past few days I'd say it's not going to end just yet.
How about 88.9k?
Which brings us back to the question...
where'd ego?
You can't just use any old USB stick--it has to have software installed on it to act as a wallet. That's what hardware wallets like Trezors and Ledger Nanos are. If you don't want to pay for them, you could print out a paper wallet, as long as you're not worried about losing it or someone finding it. Another option is to put a "paper" wallet in a file format on an encrypted USB stick instead of printing it. But since you don't have a huge amount, I agree with the user who said that the most sensible option for you is a desktop wallet like Electrum.
Why are they locking accounts?
locking in what way? i can still access my funds. transfer to and from 
That doesn't answer my question. What are you looking for?
The edit still doesn't answer my question.

Do you want to trade or do you want to keep your coins safe?

You can't do both.
Ignore them. 
Look at his post history, he should go through with it
[deleted]
I keep a Google sheet that compares the % difference between KRW and CAD prices (Quadriga is usually in-line with International exchanges anyway)...

But it'll also show up here: https://www.bitcoinforecast.com/korbit when the Kimchi Premium goes +/- 5%.  When BTC dips and the Kimchi Premium is in the negative, I buy.  Koreans suck at HODL and are great at FOMO.
I'm just gonna go ahead and say thanks.
Damn this guy is whitty both names in a single line.

srsly, think about it... Long period of bear market. I think we got a strong signal we are very near or may have finally neared the bottom. But with the bears so close behind there will be some doubts, some soul searching... We will need to invite the bears back for tea and if they fuck the place up, we may have to try that bottom again. Unlikely but the more likely scenario is they will come and start talking shit and the bulls will gore them in their anuses and they won't come back until September

yeah I hope it continues its right track right now. This market gaining supports right now and it is better for this community
Go sell them and spend it all on some fat rims for your wheelchair, nocoiner.

Ikr? And he would occasionally slip up and say "check out my channel"


Thank you for your comment. We support your reply.
I think that's taking it a little too far. I'd opt into a hardware wallet personally if you have 1+ BTC invested
Coinbase is insured like a normal bank. Crypto kids don't like it because it's too "mainstream," as in it's actually setup like a bank and is federally insured. This means that if they are hacked and they're bankrupted, your investment is guaranteed by the feds up to $250K, iirc. That amount of security comes from working with "the establishment," therefor the anti-establishment, conspiratorial crowd hates it mostly because it comes with it a certain level of accountability that is antithetical to the decentralized anonymize nature of crypto. As in, it makes money laundering and subversion more difficult and government surveillance easier. But that is all beside the fact that Coinbase is by far the safest exchange you can keep your investment and is arguably safer than a hardware wallet if you don't know what you're doing (which is 90+% of people invested in bitcoin). If you are a normal person who hasn't drank the extreme techno-libertarian cool-aid and just wants to try their hand, coinbase/gdax is where you should keep your investment and do your trading.
I dont leave my funds in exchanges, other than my trading stack( coinbase). The rest is is a secure wallet
Hell yeah

I don't think that making a claim that there is indeed a "bigger picture" will hide your ignorance :).

Ok kid, I think you have exhausted your list of googled hyperbole so please go to sleep before you mum yells for you.

Eh?  I'm reporting you and myself to the mods.

I'm not breaking any forum rules, and won't be accused of it.

Edit: I can't report myself - but I have tried.  I have reported you.  I won't be accused of breaking Reddit rules by a poster.  The mods can look through my history and decide for themselves.
Let's cross our fingers 
Too tinny.
Deleted people buy it?
Id ont know
Yeah.
Then I'm not lying till I'm proven wrong. ðŸ™‚
Ok thanks :)
Heh.  :)
No, ya got greedy. 
He's impotent.

Still don't like being called a nocoiner as it's factually untrue. Good idea though. I like the creativity.
And what amount do you have? Hmm?
Great job. First factually accurate post lol. I decided to not do it. Whoop dee fucking doo. XD
Reading this is better than comedy :) 
Thanks! Good advice for a noob hodler
His Bitcoin's are stuck in escrow due to complex Nigerian tax laws. You just need to pay the fees to get the coins through. -western union preferred.
I'm pretty sure he doesn't even make sense to himself

I worry about the blatant sexism on these boards.  




He's almost fit for r/gatekeeping
You cant handle someone who has a different opinion to yourself. I think the only child here is you.

I worked in app design and building for a long time and now am shifting towards blockchain solutions as a layer to traditional problems because of how revolutionary it is. 

Like i said, this is my job, and ive seem how tech has moved and understand how blockchain or similar technology is going to be a base level of society in years to come
Without the average person even knowing they use it.  Im not going to explain intimate details because it would take fucking hours and unless you are an OS or App developer would probably be a waste of time.

Once again you are free to have your own opinion. Why are you attacking me because mine is different? Thats really childish or maybe shows you want me to change your mind but arent mature enough to ask me relevent questions.
lmao it was a joke, lighten up dude 
*"I see deleted people"*
Don't end it. Keep living and spite them

this is no place for snowflakes
You linked to a picture of some numbers with 'BTC' after them. Literally proves nothing.
*In b4 he asks: "do I need 2fa?"*

If they get hacked you're fucked. And since they are a large institution, they are a major target.

How hard is it to just create a quick offline wallet and send your coins there.
HA HA. It's called a 401 scam.
It works better when the person calling people stupid has clever insults that actually make sense. 
Wut
It seems your assumption is sexist. 
Lol this is the problem with reddit and why its a shitty site.  Tou have a different opinion and people either attack you or censor it with down votes. Im not even invalidating anyone with my posts at all, im not gate keeping what so ever.

If you are virwing me this way its because you think i have some knowledge you want and might value but i cba to open I dialogue so hes baiting it out of me
In an immature way.


Let me ask a simple question so that we are on the same page -

How is the price of BTC related to the use of blockchain?

Really simple question.
K.
(spoiler alert)
Thanks.
That's fine. Understand you're wrong.
I mean, I was asked to screenshot the amount I have. That's my Coinbase. Don't believe it? Not my problem. It proves the amount I have because I know it's mine. ðŸ˜‚
I knew there had to be a conspiracy  behind internet pages not loading when the internet down.
Oh, believe me - there's no information that I want or need from you.

All I'm point out is that you have made a grand statement that is pure gibberish.
I 100% agree with that someone should do their own research. It's just weird to me that you take the time to comment "lol do your own research", while with your knowledge you could probably give the dude an ELI5 answer in the same amount of keystrokes, that's all c:

Super glad I pulled out of this shitty market.
That's probably because he doesn't like the real answer.

Which is that there is no differentiation between BTC and the alts from technical and functional perspectives and the only intangible difference is BTC's brand value.

The answer really is that simple.
Im bad at simplifying information lol, it would be long winded and hard to follow. Google is full of good resources 
Great job. First factually accurate post lol. I decided to not do it. Whoop dee fucking doo. XD
