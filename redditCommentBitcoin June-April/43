It' over nine.... nevermind

It's over nine.... nevermind

It's over nine-thousand! 

(10 minutes later)

... nevermind
**$10,000 by Friday** 
Come on 9k, don't be shy.
Slow steady climb is good right now keep chugging along bitcoin

Seller logic:

"8999.9$? fuck that I aint selling #HODL"

"9000$???? REAL SHIT SELL SELL SELL SELL"

Come on let’s pass 9 k
It's over 9000!!!!
I just got my tax refund. All my friends too. We are buying bitcoin with it. We figure we can buy 23 tomorrow. Hope price stays this low. 
Everyone needs to stop selling at exactly $9,000.

Sell at $8995, $8999, or $9001.

By creating a huge sell wall at exactly $9000 it makes it very difficult for the price to go over $9,000. 
its too early for vegeta. too much sellorders triggering when it hits 9k. probably back to 8.7 again now, but hopefully not 
Actually he's prettey near positive we're busting through Vegeta's hymen very soon
Anyone shorting, please can you not do it right at 9000 mark. Sell it at 8900, or 9100 may be. But not EXACTLY at 9000, please :)
Waiting for those Asians to wake up so we can crack 9k for good
anyone have a full list of all the fucks that said Btc would never again be over 9000? 
#Kakarot!

#Kakarot!

##Kakaroooooooot!
Blew past 9000, choo choo!

Too many of you want Lambos 'erry day. 'Erry day can't be a Lambo day.
Another bull flag forming.
When we hit 9K yesterday dropped to 8700, this morning it dropped down to 8800 and latest one is 8900, next time we hit 9K should be hopefully holding.
We will clear $9k today and stay above it easily I think.
At least Asia didn't sell like crazy. Now it's up to you Europe. Good morning!
This would be a very good time to get through the $9k barrier, not much resistance at the moment.  I know volume is low. 
Creeping up steadily :) 
ER?  Wat?
It's only 8am New York time, I think we need to wait a few hours until the whole of the American market is in action, also it being Sunday means volume will probably stay pretty low. 
Wait, what?!

boom.
CRAB-17 ACTIVATED bogdanoff 
It's now the 23rd here in Japan, but the 22nd was my birthday. Can I have a belated birthday present and wake up with BTC stably over $9k? Am I asking too much? Thanks in advance.
9000 is going to stick one of these pushes.
omfg the 70btc fake wall keeps moving backwards, someone really doesn't want their short position burned hahahahahaha
So close..
I’ll wait 
lets play the move the giant fake sell wall back game
for anyone not day trading, 6h and 1d charts are the only thing that matter
Are there any more BITCOINS left to mine?  Is it worth it to invest in mining hardware?
So I got a Trezor wallet and moved my bitcoin to addresses controlled by keys in my Trezor.  I was using an Electrum wallet on my computer and have been paranoid about getting hacked for a while now.  

So now I don't have to worry about getting hacked?  Now I just worry about losing my pin and seed right?  Any advice on this.  How hard is it to remember a 24 word seed?
I'm seeing a massive pump right now on gdax.


Edit: And a 140BTC sell wall at $8800. Is that what a whale looks like?
What's going on with bcash? +22% today, BTC +0.75%
Today $ 9.000,- HAS to be broken !!!!
**We need another push from The Bulls**
You want manipulation, that 160 coin sell wall at 8850 is fucking manipulation.
The bears are pissing me off, come along for the ride or GTFO.
How's everyone doing today?
shorts getting burned left right and centre.
Would be good to see another proper charge in the next few days, getting to over $10k.
[deleted]
Ruh roh shaggy, Bcash is creeping up on us.
12tg
Vegeta in less than 3h.
got barted 
**Support The Bulls.**
lots of sell orders triggered at 9k. I don't think many will want to get burned again. Give this another small push to 9k and we should climb quickly to 9.1
Buy or sell??
[deleted]
[deleted]
No, there’s 42 of us. We bought a Trezor and buying 23 as it stands now and putting the Trezor in a safety deposit box for two years. We drew up contracts. Just an experiment. Average refund was $9600. Child tax credit helps a lot. 
Please for advice, what is the best Bitcoin wallet right now?

I got little out of the loop with the Bitcoin recently, I have some coins in Electrum 2.6.4 and on Coinbase, but Electrum does not connect to the network and I dont want to screw up and lose anything (I am little clumsy sometimes).

Thanks in advance for any advice!

over 9k within the hour.
about 3 days for 17millions of btc.
underwhelming day 
How come a "deposit" to my wallet dosent show up as a pending transaction after 13 conformations? Looked up transaction on blockchain.info and it shows correct amount at my wallet adress, but when I look in my wallet the BTC isnt there. Don't know how many satoshis per byte, but paid $0.33 transaction/miner fee. (Yes, i am looking at correct wallet, no coin)
Where would I sell bitcoin as a minor in Canada?

shorters gone short
Considering the minimal price action between yesterday and today, I personally expect this to be a top and the next twenty-four hours will be a hard pullback. You can go back in the daily charts and see similar patterns.
cant wait till mt gox dumps all their 250k bcash at once

Americans are all awake now so I think we will get past and stay past $9k in the next few hours.

Overbought and momentum is at a peak. Don't be surprised if there's a hefty price drop in coming days. Let's get out of this bear market, but I am afraid that time isn't here yet. good luck out there.

sweet, trying to get a confirmation b/c of something urgent and it's taking forever for the next block

what's the point of raising the fees if blocks can just randomly take forever

this is why this isn't taken seriously 
3 times rejected on 30 minute chart - 9K is proving to be difficult. I am still of opinion that not enough momentum to break the bear trend fully. Although we are trying..

https://ibb.co/d7CiWx

Bitcoin has the possibility to either fail or succeed. You know I just stick to cash because it ain't risky. It's what they say in Soviet Russia, "In Soviet Russia, you don't get bitcoin, bitcoin get you"
First comment?

hello guys has anyone notice that the value of Greencoin on Yobit is different from the value in Coinexchange??

im having a problem transfering my Greencoin to Yobit cuz the account are temporary turn off. any help 
The goal is to repeat that 9000 times
$100,000 today
Ahhhaha. You’re funny dude. But this isn’t a comedy forum. 
9k is thinking he used to be 19k, so he feels devalued.... We just need to encourage him 😀
9k was raped few times before so confidence is lost. Needs community support. 
bot sellorders. 
I always put my sell orders 10$ before the round numbers cause I know It's gonna go straight back down lol
Has gotten it 
Where are the memes??? This is big IMO. Strong confirm on the bull run starting

That’s a big tax refund, go you!
This is probably the most legit thing I've read all day.
Buy 23 what?
What if...everyone just stopped selling?  *Mind blown*
This guy has some theories in him
It's bouncing off 9 k now, chewing away at sell orders.
That's so typical. Leave all the heavy lifting for the small guys. 
the nostradamus guy always made me laugh though  
Nostradamus went bullish since the 1k pump. He thought it would hit 8200-8300 but looks like no. 
Reversal on the 1d chart.
Erry day man. erry damn day!
Well not true, some days are moon days. 
We don't need your kind of negativity around this forum.  We all love Lambo's.
It's every day bro!
Pooomp eet again.
Woops!
Low volume mate, let's be realistic. Might do sideways most of the day.
Merrican's have been pushing it for days already. Expect more of the same. 
Saw on tv a paid infomercial for bitcoin yesterday
oida?
And busted...
I'm positive that will happen.
Eventually we'll break through the 9k barrier and then 10k is within reach. Then wallstreet will run around yelling "BTC over 10k AGAIN!"
Do you think we will see 50D break over 200D ?
No, they done now. Mine TurtleCoin. 
Mine Doge Coin.
Hard. Get one of those Cryptosteel things. 

https://cryptosteel.com
I have my wallet and the seed phrase in a safe where I live.  I also have a copy of the seed phrase on a piece of paper, laminated, in an envelope marked "DO NOT THROW AWAY" and stored in a relative's home safe.  It's not 100% secure.  My relative can hate me one day and steal it or somehow a thief get access to it and is aware that 24 words is a seed phrase.  If I had a good amount of crypto I'd probably look into more secure ways, but this should do for now.
Remember? If you’re not using it every day (losing your wallet every day) you won’t be doing much remembering. Write it down keep it somewhere safe. 
[deleted]
That's a dolphin.
Those aren't real. There was a sell wall on Saturday that was 200 BTC that the price sped right through and it vanished at the very last second. They are there to intimidate, they aren't real.
No.
Hardfork
Clearly just spoofing. Some whales just haven't done with their accumulation...
160 coin is a wall?  

I think you should look at the volume on bitfinex.
That wall is like the US/Mexico border and we're Mexicans trying to get through.
But mah indicators and moving averages are telling me to short
Not too bad thanks.  Could do with the price getting and staying above $9k
It will be fun watching the <$9k short positions being covered soon.
Slow and steady - climbing to 9100 today would be more worth for the upcoming weeks than a pump to 10k
Sunday night to Monday morning statistically seems to have a tiny dip
Alright Bcash, let's see who you really are...
My, its old man Ver from the centralised shitshow brigade...
BABIES!!!!
Came back to see downvotes, I am dissapointed.

Maybe. Its still Sunday tho. 
Buy, spend, rinse, repeat.
Yes
I did both. Multiple times. So hard to tell now.
hold
No one can advise you. Might drop back but the buy pressure is strong. Longterm.is 9k still a good.opportunity to buy 
Up or down for sure. Unless it stays the same
Green Dildos with a chance of Red Hail
Either above 9k or below 8k soon
Turbulences ahead...
STORMY

Why take the risk?  Just move it off the American exchanges.  You are not supposed to keep it there anyway unless you are trading.

How will you divide it after the two years? Will it be based on each persons initial investment or just evenly? Very cool idea 
You should update Electrum to the latest version. 3.1.3

You still got 18 minutes, let's see.
within what hour 
Sunday to be fair
Just staying above the downward trend line is a nice win for bulls right now 
Because the node isnt up to date. Try using a different node or if you're running a full node, make sure it's synced with the block chain.
Bitcoins are only for adults. 
There should be plenty of demand otc but coinsquare is my gateway 
As your gay alter ego I have to agree.
That's all she's got captain, we cannot give her anymore!
Yeah hell it's going to be boring, I think you should sell everything.
Bulls are tired. Looks like a little correction ahead.
Think positive.  What has happened today is perfectly fine, it can't keep going up several hundred everyday.  
Fuck off
A dream never came true
Everyone watching space to break the critical resistance level, 9.2k...... if it breaks above, it is positive momentum continuing which is a good news
Only ButtCoin accepted here, try your look in r/GoneWild

The zombie apocalypse could be any day now. So before your wife goes and blow your coins, get one of them. 
There are too many altcoins increasing their value at crazy rates, and they increase the value of bitcoin itself.
The crypto market is not about holding. It's about easy daily profits.
Nice, 
"Decentralised", right.


Welp, guess it’s time to sell it all then, derp derp derp
Lol
The fees are not controlled by anyone, so don't worry.
Don't be a mong. 
I dont understand so cryptos are shit reeeeeeeeee
9k is difficult because there is tremendous resistance to surpass $9K. The whales have limit sell orders to ensure it either doesn’t pass $9K or returns to $8800-9K levels. What does this mean? It’s definitely not a good sign. It’s indicative of a fatal crash. 
why are you even here?

Here’s the winner for today’s dumbest comment of the day award!  Check back daily, we always have a winner. 
How can't you be sure of something so simple?

The prices are different because one of the exchanges are restricted. It is generally not possible to do arbitrage with assets that can move across the world within 10 minutes, unless you have a lot of fiat liquidity and are well connected.
^
bots putting them exactly at round numbers has to be because of "muh psychological effect"
selling is for bitchs.
No its not. 
Or he’s got a lot of friends
BTC
I think if we include the law of supply, lesser volume means it will result to a high price but maybe it is not applicable to this market because sometimes volume is being hold by whales
Then all the news would talk about would be it's an insane bubble even bigger than they say it is already. There would be solid proof that this is all speculative with no real value as nobody does anything with it other than holding it endlessly. Many people would start selling and the price would dive. Similar to what happened in December, but much much worse. The price going up and down is healthy for real growth.
Easy: Order books emptied at the ask side. No orders taken at the bid side. No trading. No meaningful price.
The Americans have failed today. So the europeans have.
Lets go asia.
Asia deff drives the market. At least this turnaround 
A rari a day?
Maybe today.
Most people dont realize that volume comes when somehow a bot trading is triggered by a big price gain or price drop. Not the vice verse. So stop staying “low volume”. Volume will come when the price moves side ways significantly. 
I hope so, that dip just now was not very nice. 
That can only help. 
You’re a terrible liar!😭 *runs back to the bedroom and throws himself onto the bed while crying uncontrollably*
I can’t wait til that happens. RIP That guy that’s been posting that “article”  *10k never again* 
Any good links on how to get started?  I am computer literate and am new to mining.  Too the Moon!!  1D=1D 
Wow that's pretty cool.  That'll survive a fire.
Well do you think most people even bother to memorize it?  What I was planning to do is give the copy of the seed to my sister for safe keeping but what if her house burns down or she somehow loses it.  How many copies of your seed are there and did you memorize the seed?   
I've heard it's a bad idea to try to be clever like that by transposing words.  
You don't say
I don’t doubt it, but anything over 100 is rare on gdax.
You missed his point. There are obvious fake outs and manipulation happening at the moment on GDAX. Hopefully buyers will start nipping into their sell block bit by bit.
kind of sordid your type of fun... watch 9356.9 at kraken for a good laughter, because that's where my short will touch the stop... if it goes there :)


I would like a quick rise in the next few days just to get it moving again but slow and steady is fine as well.
this is such a stupid statement, bumping to 10k would clearly be better
Tomorrow’s price at noon on west coast USA will be the price we put in contract. We are all friends since grade school. Wives are friends. The contract is in case someone goes through a divorce. 
Thanks. Does it support Lightning and stuff? I have read there were some fishy problems around electrum but I don't know details. Thanks
Sounds reasonable, It is a couple of thousands afterall. Will think abour it, thanks. :)
I noticed that you can buy them in twos -- do you need to have a backup?

9k would be good psychologically.  9.2 even better.

9.2 by Monday and we'll be discussing 10k next weekend.
Right on. I bet that thing under stears like crazy. Could be really fun. 
Eww
Yeah if you just got in...lol
Why would they put a sell order at 9k ? I don’t understand why they wouldn’t want it to surpass 9k.

Total newbie here, still learning how this whole system works :)

Are we talking about pump and dump ?
I don't know. In fact, the internet is not a form of government, we can search up whatever we would like to except we are monitored by the government. I'm here because I'm interested in bitcoin. 
Actually as you mention it. Since cash is really not a good idea. For people who would like to have large amounts of USD (above $1M). They really should buy short term government bonds instead, since bail-ins are the new rule come the next crisis. Also it is better than savings accounts.
Dude, inflation is 2% per year.  

But yes, cash is intended for convenience, not investment.
Because there is a lag sometimes and other people have commented literally in the time between you writing and submitting your response.
You're a charmer.
You're an idiot for humouring such a moron. 
Wonder how that works. Do they create a huge whatsapp/telegram group with everyone that receives a tax refund? 
but 23 btc like 23btc or like 0.00000023btc

/s
I don't think $9k will last very long today. 
I'm sure as soon as they've all had their morning green tea they'll climb into this. 
So being so bossy.

The same bots who buy also sell as well. Now think hard on this.

Bitcoin can jump big numbers if new volume enters with passion.
The dip from $20k to $6k wasn't very nice. I don't think we have to worry about $9k to $8.85k
Maybe later on today. 
That would make me very happy, he has got to be the most annoying person on this forum.
[deleted]
I don't think it's manipulation.  It's just sellers who thinks that's the best price they can sell for.

And because there are multiple exchanges, if the price were to move up on another exchange, the bots are smart enough to re-price it higher.  

These are just normal market dynamics.
Pumps are correlated to low volume market times. If there is a pump this is a sign that the volume is far too low. If there is a steady grow instead, which correlates to cross market moment or new money flow into the asset, and there is high volume too, this means it is by far harder for individuals to dump the market down again.
[deleted]
No Lightning. All wallets which support Lightning are still in early beta. Electrum is your best choice if you don't want to use a hardware wallet. If you have more than approx 1 Bitcoin, or want to be totally safe regardless of the extra costs, I would recommend a hardware wallet.

Electrum Versions before 3.1 had a security problem. 

https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum-docs/blob/master/cve.rst
[deleted]
If you're using electrum there is an option in the bottom left corner that allows you to choose nodes, try a new one. Idk about other online wallets, don't use them.
Eat your broccoli son.
Same as everywhere but it works for getting cash in and out. I am with hsbc 
I'd post a picture of the moon, but policy doesn't allow it. Family forum this. 
Maybe bitcoins recovers slightly but we are far from moon. maybe if it surpasses the 9 to 9.5 k walls.
Are you farking stupid or something ? We are just starting the moves off the lows, 1 month behind schedule, probably 500% below where should already be, you can see the momentum and you think this is where we're going to go correct ? There's no correction for a month or two mate. This is explosive growth time. Bitcoin is about to unleash its inner Kraken. People will speak about this summer for years to come. 
What makes you say that?
I wouldn't complain if it did :) 
What's kd?
waiting for 850
Agreed, lol (law of attraction)
[deleted]
Cash doesn't grow 2000% a year. In fact from the moment you receive it inflation starts eroding its value. FIAT currencies have a 100% failure rate. They all fail eventually. So is FIAT safer than Bitcoin? Absolutely not. 

The best approach is obviously to have both. 
Why are you being so unpleasant?
as long as it doesnt go down from 8.8k its good 
Someone needs to push the price and it triggers a bot trading.

Last week when we gained 1000 in 30 mins the volume went from 4 billions to 8 billion in those 30 mins. We did not have 8 billions to start with. Now think hard on this one too.
True :)
Ok.😃
2 word transposition can be brute forced in fractions of seconds, and I am pretty sure there are already programs out there simply trying every imaginable combination of transpositions, switches and flips which can possibly be learned by heart, and it won't take a second to list them all.

So your transposing is pretty much useless with a serious thief, might work for an evil relative though - unless they seek advice from a nerd.

Edit: this is what I use for things I need to keep safe: there is that one odd and silly sentence from my very early childhood I know I will never forget because it's burnt into my brain forever. I use that as a passphrase for a modern encryption algorithm. Edit2: of course you need a computer for that, and if you don't trust your internet connected devices, you will need an airgapped device to do the encryption. And make sure your passphrase doesn't get written to the disk, or better, use a device with OS from a RO device and RAM disks. Security is hard. 

Edit3: 

> separate cryogenic storage of the seed and numbers transposed with three separate company's

As I wrote above, this is useless because the company holding your transposed phrase is the company holding the faith of your bitcoin. Seriously, encryption by transposing is cracked since the roman empire.

So if you go the route of three separate companies, then split your seed into three junks of equal size and store one junk with each company, if you want to take advantage of paying for 3 companies at all. 
I can agree with you. Even though I stated it in a comment. I find it hard to believe that a few people are trying to manipulate the market. But sometimes it seems very plausible. 
No, it was 160 coins that jumped simultaneously from 8850 to 8880 and several other values, purposely avoiding the mid market price.
[removed]
how?
Thanks a lot for your answer. That's good advice, and it's good to know I don't need two. All the best
I dont either. I allways use Electrum too. Will look for way to switch node. 

How could a node be 60 conformations behind?
Ok thanks

No idea what graphs you're looking at, but things don't look all that promising to me
Just that we have had a few attempts at $9k and I think when the American markets are in full swing we will get past it.

Hi in, I'm dad!
Come on ... BTC dropping 60% in 3 months is safer than USD dropping 2% in 1 year?

Hmmm.
Because I am a grumpy piece of shit.
You're waaaaay to tense about this. Bitcoin is going to go up for a while and the current trend is very likely to accelerate. 
I'm just below my all time equity highs. The DD is only in Bitcoin. It won't last long. Hour or two at most.

On the contrary, I believe there is big time manipulation happening.  But not in the form of setting up walls.  The STORM and Verge pumps were very obvious examples.

In fact, I believe that the HK based exchanges (bitfinex, binance, etc) are working closely with the whales on this.  

Now, this is the rumour - it's all controlled by the Chinese triads.  That's why the Chinese government stepped in and ordered them out of HK.  Don't shoot me for FUD ... as I said, it's just rumours here in Asia.

If it isn't synced, it will be an infinite number of confirmations behind.. until it's synced. 
I didn't say I can spell. Not really required to read markets. How many languages do you speak by the way ? English is very far from being my first language.
Not looking at graphs. We were at $6.5k a week ago. We're at $9k now. Looks very promising to me. Looks like momentum.The kind that carries. 
As an American I can assure you, we are poised to fuck everything up for everybody.

it's what we do!

And yet it’s up over last year ....
Checkout withdrawals of gold from the NY Fed. And upcoming plans of a gold standard in China, which is perfect for them since they are a large exporter.
If the US is forced onto the gold standard, which is becoming ever more likely, there's some estimates floating around that the $ ounce price of gold could be as much as $53 000 an ounce. And I promise you it's not going to be gold's value that changed. 

The dollar is just a printed piece of paper and its value is a perceived value. When that perception changes it will happen quickly. 

The world is very rapidly moving away from dollar dominance. We have no idea what it's going to do to the dollar, but it's not going to be anything positive. We're likely to have rapid changes in the dollar value in the next few years. 

I'd rather be in Bitcoin than the dollar. In fact I am. 
What's DD?

No doubt.  And possible double that with time or crash to half.

My point isn't whether BTC is valuable or not but rather, that the volatile price makes it a risky proposition compared to the dollar.  

Then again, no pain no gain :)
Yes, the dollar is just a printed piece of paper and BTC is just a computer generated number.

Only difference is that the dollar happens to be the currency accepted for products and services and BTC is not.  

Thanks, but not getting sucked into discussions on hyperbole like US being forced onto gold standard (rofl).
Good job. 
Draw down. So Bitcoin did 9k went to 8.85k, so DD was 1.66% from the high of the day so far. 

Hardly earth shattering for something that does 2000% a year.
Well, you sell your shit and have a small holiday. Me, I'll just sip my beer and watch the bottom line explode. 
Bitcoin always gonna be one Bitcoin. Amirite?
Ok.
Same arguments were true for CHF and what happened to it ? Lost 50% of its value in 1 tick somewhere in the last two years. Not even the Bitcoin crashes are that severe. And it's not something you read in a book. It's not history. It happened in our current time frame and financial systems. 

Meanwhile both Russia and China are starting gold backed systems including oil for gold. You better start thinking about it. 
Ok cheers.

Yep.
Russia and China are just tired of the dollar hegemony (everyone outside of America is) and yes, this, together with yuan denominated oil are their way of pushing back.

But America going back to gold standard is not going to happen.  The entire American economy is fuelled by debt and a gold standard dollar will mean hyper inflation and instant annihilation of the American economy.  It doesn't take an economist to tell you that.
When ?
And a debt laden system is going to continue to work ? Doesn't take an economist to work out that's not going to continue for much longer either.

That I agree.  But the problem is due to more to irresponsible deficit spending rather than fiat per se.  

The solution is to rein in spending at every level.  This include the American citizens, with an average household debt of $137k!  
Money has always been debt, yet here we are.
Ja, sell mate. Take that holiday. It's better for you I think. 
Money has almost never been debt. Go study the history of money.
