wow, down almost $200 during my shower lol
He sold.












pamp it.
Serious question. If you bought BTC for the altruistic reasons that people talk about (an FU to the system, deflation, savings equilibrium etc) then why does the price of 1 btc converted to USD matter? If you care about the price, it implies you are waiting for a gain to convert it back to FIAT which defeats the purpose.

Honest question.
It seems bulls and bears have shaken hands and now everyone is confused. 
Investing in bitcoin rn is like taking care of a sick child. You just wait until its done vomiting and having diarrhea then show it a little love without too high expectations. 
And down to sub $7k we go :(
Meh. Lambos are overrated anyway.
Here comes another red dildo month
It’s really very funny to see folks moods change sooooo drastically over 500 swings.  

Yesterday: this is awesome. I’m so happy I bought. Look at all this green. It’s going to the moon!

Today: omg I’m going to kill my self. It’s dead. China to blame! Get out. Run for the hills. Lol. 
Remember waking up to days like
"damn we didnt break 11800 today"
RIP 7k
FUCK ME - I've just learnt a lesson! I had a limit buy set up which I had forgotten about. It ended up buying a little bit of Bitcoin as it was coming down. What a waste of a few hundred dollars!  Learn from my folly! 
I'm going from a Lambo to a Ford Pinto.  At least, I'll find out if my Girlfriend is a gold digger.

Would you rather be a prisoner in jail for a year and come out being a billionaire for the rest of you life or only a millionaire? Honestly that guy is richer than Roger Ver now. At age 32, people die trying to become a billionaire at such a young age.
Hoping we can rally after that China tariff news.
Yesterday getting back up to $7.5k was a great start at a recovery, for the market to just slump back today is really frustrating. 
Dow just pulled a 500 point come back in one day Let's hope the same for btc 
No one said it would be easy, people that bought years ago had to wait a long time before they made serious money.  
The markets filled with so much pump and dump now that even guys like me don’t trust the market anymore. Another great piece of tech ruined by shady hands. Oh and for the alt account shills that will try to write strategy about my post. You’re the reason why it’ll be dead within the year.

This is painful.  :(
Im no expert at analysis but the last 4 (maybe 5) times it reached at/around 6200 it went up - maybe it’s nothing but just saying

My 12 year old son could make a deposit on a Lambo. 
I have found an old 12 word seed in some files i thought i lost. I cannot get the seed to work anywhere except in electrum, and in electrum its an empty wallet with no tx history. This doesnt make sense as i have tx written on my same paper that should be from this seed. 

Ive tried a multitude of things and searched online. There was a discussion about a guy finding a 2013 seed and there was a list of words that not all his words were on, but another list that they were, but after he says that the conversation ended there. Nothing about how to gain access to it
Got a feeling we are gonna see a juicy rallye now
Large red dongs
Personally I now think do not buy as the drop has surely not finished yet. Sunday was $6400 and Friday was $6600 still opportunity to buy cheaper later today or tomorrow.
Seems like there is nearly zero correlation between traditional stocks and Bitcoin. A year ago I thought that if the stock market experienced a correction, Bitcoin would do well. That hasn't been the case though.
don’t worry guys, you can still get your lambos. You’ll just need about 59BTC is all

I don't care about adoption. I'm here to make some *moe-nay!*
Silly Bitcoin doin that down thing again. Other way now thanks. 
**Lets go Bitcoin!**
last chance to buy under 7k boys!!! Lmao
come down baby bitcoin so I can buy you and ride you for all you're worth
Well... I've been through many crashes from 2015 to today... Nothing new, except that now we're on the news all the time...
i mean like, who didnt see this coming?
That was a prime example of a bull trap.
I gave my 2 month old son a check for 3 thousand dollars. He said he wants to invest in bitcoin instead. Im holding back my tears. Im so proud
if you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention
Rise you magnificent bastard. 
The whales are trying to make you think the price is dropping. You can clearly see the last few hours where they dumped and the price went down like 3 times. But then you  also see the price gradually go back up naturally by us normal people.
It's time for another rally soon.

Can we get it over with, please?

I'm not selling, but I also can't buy anymore. So this price level holds no interest for me...
I wish I could see the expression on some of the fudsters’ faces the moment the line of giant green dildos come.  Would be priceless.

lol bitcoin dropped because Mt Gox CEO did an AMA on reddit, would you look at that rofl
Dropped straight into the golden pocket and rebounded out.  Should go up from here, wave 2 here we come to around 7900 with a 1:1 extension
everybody please dump there shit and drop to 1k.... sick of this shit
What I don’t understand is how will bitcoin or any alt coin be used to pay for anything when it’s so volatile. Say you take a payment in whichever coin pick your favorite and then the price dips like super fast then what? Also say you want to cash out your crypto don’t you have to pay a fee like thru Coinbase or Gemini? So it isn’t really free payment after all is it?
I think general trend looks positive - strong support at 7k.  I wouldn't be surprised to see 8k within 48 hrs.
what a great $50 run. TO DA MOON 
Inevitable decline as expected to $6400
**Come on BULLS!**  **Show us you are alive!**
I said I wasn't going to do anything today because I was mad at America for being weak while I slept, but I bought anyway because of those hot hot prices. Today is looking better than what happened last night. (I'm in Japan) Sadly, when the east coast of America wakes up and they see the hard gains Asia (and I hope Europe when you guys get up) have made they will go all limp dick and fail to keep it up and sell for gains again. 

Prove me wrong, America. Do something for the rest of us today. 
Here's some good news: BCash 8th by trading volume today.  That is terrible.

When Bcash finally dies, the cryptomarket will take off again.  I'm convinced of it.
Fuck bitcoin. This is so laughable it's pathetic.
It’s been a rough couple of months but I have a feeling things are going to turn around for bitcoin soon.  Last few days of bullish activity was a good sign.  This sudden drop back to 6k range won’t last long. 
Hold on to your hat boys...100k imminent.
what is the news for today?

Look 👀 at me closely. eye to eye. FUCK MT GOX. now lets move forward.
Oh dear!
This is not feeling good.  perhaps capitulation in a scary way will come.  Confidence could get destroyed.  It certainly is getting close for me.
Have we hit bottom? Can I buy now? 
I asked yesterday but didn't get a clear answer. If I want to accept bitcoin in my shop, what do I need?
https://imgur.com/a/z0UF1
Stop talking about the price and use bitcoin for the technology. Buy vacations, furnish your apartment, settle debts etc. By using it and therefore giving it a value outside of speculation you will increase the adoption and therefore long term value. It's a great currency to use. So use it. 
So it was “mooning” at 7400. What do you say now?
While I *do* believe that there's a lot of market manipulation going on. 

What some people here attribute to the *"whales"* is just ridiculous! 

A lot of the price changes, e.g. "gradual growth and then sudden drop", have always been typical for free markets.

That's "market psychology for dummies".
Let the downfall begin boys. 
looks like whales try to put up fake sell walls to convince ppl to sell. lol
[removed]
So who is it now?..Don the Con?..China?...Cartel?
you must be a fool to think btc will go up to previous height like in december. Average joes are all gone. Where do you think new money has to come from? It's not that bitcoin is dying, there are just too many people already in it. Most of these people are positive about btc and crypto, but no new money is coming in cause average joe is not going to get his ass burned twice. Conclusion: btc will go down under 1000. No new money means price won't rise (enough), which means people will lose their patience and sell, bringing down more and more holders with them. 
I'm so bored with bitcoin lately
Bitcoin: 39. My portfolio: 0.
Are we going lower than 1 April dip?
I heard a cryptocurrency ad on the radio this morning in Quebec from financial advisors who say it is risky and to do research before investing as you risk losing it all. Was fun to see how it is slowly reaching out to the world.

**Bitcoin to Hit from $10,000, to $100,000 & even $1 Million USD**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9bmMWi-O54

Due to Bitcoin's revolutionary "blockchain technology", Bitcoin's has a potential to go up from a $10,000, to $100,000 and even $1 Million USD, per Bitcoin.

Bitcoin has proven to be the best performing currency in the last 5 years. Not since the internet was released, Bitcoin is the most important invention the world has ever had, and [almost] no one knows it yet.

Everyone can video chat for free, to anyone across the world. Now, with Bitcoin & blockchain technology, practically "anyone in the world" can send money directly to "anyone in the world" (in a Trusted & Decentralized way) without using a costly third party (like PayPal).

They say, it will happen despite of the level of belief & understanding -- just like in 1994, when people didn't believe "Internet shopping" and "Email communications" would work for the masses.)

Note: The population of the USA is ~320 Million People; and there are only ~16 Million Bitcoins in existence. The World population is 7.4 Billion People; and there will never be more than 21 Million Bitcoins in existence (which will happen around 2140) ~ Everyone can't have "more than one" Bitcoin.  (When will you get your "more than one" 1 Bitcoin?)
Where are all the “mooners” now?
As expected, the China tarriffs will make it go down, especially since it's on a downtrend now that it couldn't hold 7000. Just look at the 1 hour candle on gdax, there couldn't be a more obvious down trend signal, at least short-term.
Thanks bitcoin for ruining beach 2018, I will be fat from eating all slaughtered bull meat :S
failing to break 7k about ten times. pathetic.
Would be nice if today was all just one big bear trap.  
WE ARE SINKING!
At least for the time being, Bitcoin seems to be little more than a plaything of daytraders who are trying to set traps for each other. Unless some *fundamental* of Bitcoin changes drastically one way or the other, it looks like the price is going to continue to meander sideways for a while. Food for thought at https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/regulation-and-apathy-hit-bitcoin-market/articleshow/63546481.cms
The powers controlling this sell off want complete capitulation and then they will start buying. If you are still feeling at all hopeful then you are not where they want you yet.

Where can I track the total number of bitcoins being sold and the total number of bitcoins being bought daily? Is there a site that tracks this for all stocks?

Anyone think we will see a big green candle in the next couple of hours? 
Uhhh... So a huge Russian celebrity (Olga Buzova)  just announced her own cryptocurrency (BuzCoin) and I am scared it's going to take people away from BuzzCoin :(. https://youtu.be/jqFg5JGHIjg
Question, is this true? Or even partly true?

Wallets like exodus and Mycelium are all running “on top” the Bitcoin Core wallet. Does that question make sense? 
I’m considering making a tutorial on the core wallet and a teacher of mine said this, but I’m not certain. (Maybe the tutorial will stay really simple)

Are all the Light wallets running bitcoin core wallets behind the scenes, with the core wallet doing the work and exodus just being a nice user interface on top of it?

Thanks

What are your thoughts on where Bitcoin will be price wise and apoption wise in 5 years time? 
🎤🎵When you walk through the storm, hold your head up high.... 
I have a buy order ready at 5940. I have no idea why, I just do.
Imo widespread adoption is a ways off because of what happened in December and January. Bitcoin made headlines, and started pulling in investors who typically wouldn’t be interested in bitcoin, but didn’t want to miss out. Then once enough got in, bitcoin bit back and hard. The drop was amplified by new money being concerned of a sharp drop in value, causing even more selloffs. In order for bitcoin to be adopted more widely, it has to stabilize to get those investors who risked it and lost the first time, to invest again. 
The more widely-held a belief that the existing trend will continue, the less likely that it will. Markets hit the bottom not because of the appearance of buyers but when the sellers stop selling. 
This is an impressive pump. Hope none of you guys shorted. 
I think a lot of us have lost site of the big picture. Short term up swings and downswings shouldn't determine if you jump ship and sell. Where is bitcoin going to be in 2022? 2030?
What in the world!?!?!  Everyone is still here talking about BTC and the cryptocurrency markets?  I took a few days off, sure I'd come back and find everything worth a nickel... and then I'd make my big move....
$6900 (on GDAX) the new line of resistance? 
5.5k boys get ur dicks out
Imagine in a few years the bitcoin you currently hold might be worth 10-20 times its current value.  Consider how much better your financial security/happiness would be at that point.   That thought makes me smile even through the tough times we face today. 
Under $5000 in 2 months.
Going down to 4-5K, will see a bounce back to around 7K but it’s all downhill from there. It’s been a downhill drive since ATH but they still buy the “dip”. 
Bitcoin down this morning due to China announcing new tariffs on the US in retaliation.

I am a HODLer and optimistic on long term but let's face it, the bear trend continues. No need to fool ourselves around with small ups and downs.

https://ibb.co/gK15ux

I keep my stance that we need more lava building, more adoption, more development, more pressure from people and more people waiting on sidelines to enter.....

So far that pressure is not big enough to break through.

But the question is that will that pressure be big enough to be sustained and take us to all-time-highs again in 2018?
Ok, this got to be the last dip before the pump. Or this is truly being suppressed by the so called “Cartel”. Makes no sense. 
Hard to have confidence in anything that it’s followers refer to as dildos. It already has a nickname. “Candle” 
[PSA - Message of the day. ](https://imgflip.com/i/27gshp)
Think, the more that sell, the more that gotta buy back in the momentum pump to moon. 
Looks like we have another faction keeping it from falling below 6500 because that's what it costs to mine a Bitcoin
[deleted]
$6500, here we come. Just like 3 days ago.
BTC is dead. Its time to move on.
The people will still believe in bank system until their money is not available anymore 😂😂. Then its the time for us. 
The big drop will have caused doubt in the market. Tonight I think Bitcoin’s value is more likely to go down. 
I would like to sink this ship lower honestly, then start the water pumps.
Tone Vays says we are testing 4900.  Which sounds pretty realistic. 
Time for the real flush out, plz!!! With a little dab of volume, moon it is 🌙 . 
$20k by 8 am boys and girls! 
red dildos!!kkk
I bet some of you will scream 'to the moon!' again when btc goes up again next time. Fact is: party is over in 2018. We're in a long term downward trend and the end/bottom is bearly visible, even if you use your binoculars to try to catch it. The moment suicide hotlines are set in place, is the moment you need to invest in btc. People need to die first, jump off the golden gate bridge, before you're able to get your lambo. 
How low?
A scammer could get over 2k likes, why can't bitcoin go under 6k? Only the good deed suffers.
So weak. 
No sign of the hash rate dropping yet.  Presumably there will be a price point where miners start dropping out of the pools?  
Hope the value gets more down.
So someone put child porn into the blockchain and germany is pretty pissed
What I want to know is when the government is going to address bitcoin?

6.5k has not been able to attract new investors.... nobody wants to buy now, only wales pump and daily trading action....I love the btc and for a healthy and lasting climb I want sub 4k price
curious if there is anyone here who voted for hillary or bernie in 2016? my hypothesis is there are few big govt supporters in crypto and the socialists are going to use the state to try to steal our crypto?

I don't necessary care about the USD value, I care about the objective value (purchasing power). It just so happens that USD is relatively stable to purchasing power so it's convenient to measure against.
get out of here with your logic!

[deleted]
The nice thing about Bitcoin is, that you don't need to be altruistic for it to have a positive effect. The whole system is designed around economic incentives. 
You're in the wrong subreddit, this subreddit is to relentlessly shill bitcoin as an investment while spreading bullshit acronyms to make it seem cool.
Because having the option to sell high and use that same money to buy 10X the amount of bitcoins you just sold is a normal thing to want?
The price of an item in bitcoin will likely go up and down with the USD value of bitcoin.
[deleted]
I agree. Buy and keep for 10 years until you can spend it without converting to fiat. My main concern is that storage remains a serious risk for most of the world's idiots. Their phones seem the most likely storage facility with biosecurity. But even then there has to be a back up. Nanos and Trezors just won't cut it. Its going to take several years of work before the hardware catches up.
The banking on bitcoin doc said it was made to directly interact with fiat currency like that. For example the last few times the market cap reached around 100B its value increased a bunch
Why does the price of gold matter if mattered in USD? 

Part of this is a hedge against inflation. If your money is trapped in cash it will lose 2-3% annually to inflation. 

If it's in stocks you risk a down market and most people aim to get 7-10% gains per year. 

Bitcoin has value as a store of...value. USD may or may not exist in 50 years. Bitcoin and gold probably still will. In the interim you can change it to whatever currency you need to materialize goods and services in your life.
Stupid folding doors anyway. Give me a Ford Taurus over that.
Well people tend to panic when money is lost, it's sad. Making money is good . Losing it is bad. Did you expect different 
Bro imagine some of us who are now down 12k since December. You wake up every day to see 500-1000 down, hoping for just 3 days of green back to back.

Nope, wake up to a gigantic red middle finger.
this is man that look graph at minute....
open eyes and tale a look at 1d or 1w....
Those were the days.  
That sucks, but unless you think the end is nigh, hold onto it for a day or so and you'll have made a couple of dollars.
The value of that is priceless. Good luck, my friend.👍
Thanks for making me piss myself.  Now I need a quilt incontinence pad (QIP for short).

I was just wondering about the same thing, and not just the tariff but on Mar 26 China started trading oil for gold back Chinese Yuan (futures contracts) that was in the the works by China for over 20 years and kept getting delayed and now it’s happening, this is big news.

I want bitcoin to rise but not at the expense of the North American economy....Hope everyone can win, said the eternal optimist
It means bitcoin is not out of the woods yet. The Inverse Head And Shoulders was supposed to signal a reversal, only to reverse like $400 and slump back down today, which is a bad sign.
i m to much disappointed as u r ...hop it ill back up buy tomorrow  
Nah, not gonna happen...
depends on the month LOL
~1%
did you read the Mark Karpelès AMA?
DOW Jones down 500 points, and yes bitcoin is tied to market health whether people like it or not.
Moving averages game
The last 4 times it reached 6200? What currency are you talking about?


Well, basically everyone that hasn't figured out that there are other chart options aside from the 1-minute and 5-minute charts.... look at a 12-hour chart and you'll need a bottle of scotch.

Try harder, son. 
Thanks for the chuckle 
Just buying Bitcoin really isn't enough to raise the price at this point. We need to come together as a community so that we can educate the public on block-chain, lobby our governments for fair taxes laws on cryptocurrencies, and develop payment methods for regular purchases. If we could start using Bitcoin as an actual currency, instead of a stock, then we'd see a lot more adoption.
That's because nobody wants Bitcoin. All eyes were on it three months ago and it failed.
That’s what I’m wondering ? Holy crap 
I don't get it what are you talking about?
We're going to the moon.
did you search the tx transaction.
new pornhub category in 3..2..
Bitcoin went crazy due to shitcoins getting insane returns, now that the pyramid was completed Bitcoin price will return to its still fast but not insane climb to the moon.
A lot of people say that Bitcoin follows the stock market closely.  When stocks are doing well so does Bitcoin.
Totally incorrect. 

If I have 10k to spend, I want it to make money. When things are going up, that's where my 10k is going. If things go bad, sell sell sell. 

Now, if you are a small time guy like me, and you have bills, seeing you lose your 10k when you have bills suddenly becomes a big deal. If you got 5k in the market, and 5k in bitcoin, loss is loss and you panic and pull your investments out because it's sinking, regardless of the status of bitcoin.

You are making the assumption that people are buying for HODL and really they are buying to make money today, because bills are due today. 

Does that make any sense? My point is TLDR that investors are investors, and it doesn't matter what the stock or currency is. They invest to make money, and if the market bears, so does the currency. The whole concept of 'if the markets tank currency will not' is complete fallacy. The first thing someone does when they need money is sell crypto to pay rent. If the market crashes, crypto will head right there with it.
Can that be block chain powered?
Easily, unsubscribe will filter to your liking 
Nope, America can get fucked. Woke up here in Japan this morning to see the broke dick selling and weak buying that happened since the east coast of America woke up. I'm just going to sit here and do nothing today. 
because 6.6k has absolutely no support. It has proven in the past. The next support is 6.4k - 6.5k then 6k.
Do you think it could fall to $6500?
+1

Although I have lost quite a bit of money in the process. 
sub 4k very likely....
That’s right sweet talk that whore trick 
A whole bunch of excited mooners when the price went to 7400
If that was a bull trap then it was quite elaborate.  That did not look like a typical pump and dump at all.  
That implies that there's about one entity pushing the price up or down, and that they're the bulk of the movement meanwhile the mass (and probably not so massive) of individual investors/traders are like guppies with their 0.005 contributions to price fluctuations.
lol

Oh yes I have, this is all the doings of the Quilt Whales.
That is what I say before I am about to have sex with the wife.
Looking at that steady bot buys - its quite an opposite.. They cant generate enough fomo

Goldbooger I think you might be right for a change 
did it died again?

This chart looks like a blond with open arms and legs. Seriously, have a closer look, or I am way too horny. 
Do you have any recommendations? I'm going to research on my own and I'd like to have my own wallet but I'm not really sure where to start. 
lol in december btc went from 10k to 20k, this is the hangover. if you think the party is just going to start back up you havent watched markets for very long.
I'm tired, I don't understand?

Maybe your price was as high, or higher, than existing sell orders?
If you have post only on You can't place an order that would be immediately filled (that would be a taker order and would incur the fee). So the price you were specifying must have been higher than the current price.

If you're trying to set up an order that will trigger as q price starts to rise, you are looking for a stop order. These always incur a fee AFAIK. 
Noob!
What timescale? 
Yeah that must be it
It dropped because the moving averages crossed.  Its about to begin the next bull wave.
Ok so what's a "golden pocket"?
That is what I was learning about today. Saw opportunity and shorted till fib retracement. Hopefully well go up now. If yes that would be a nice lesson for me 😄😅
I don't think any coin will be used to replace fiat. That's why I don't buy any coin that tries to be a currency except for BTC. But I see BTC as a speculative store of value now.

But the counter argument I hear is that we're still early in crypto. After a couple of years, and after more and more people own BTC, the price should not be as volatile because the "BTC wealth" is distributed to a lot of people rather than 'whales accumulating'. Still don't believe any crypto will be used to pay for things.
It's rare that that actually happens. For example, I never spend any of my Bitcoin, when i need to use it as payment, I buy some at current market price and then instantly spend it all, if that person cashes out as soon as I send it. 9 times out of ten the fluctuations won't matter. 

Small amounts, the price change is irrelevant, and in large amounts the difference is still far less than the cost of a wire transfer.
you are paying for what it is worth at the time. just like any currency in the world. 
This assumes you value the product being bought in fiat. _If_ there is enough adoption that the merchant bought the product from their supplier with cryptocurrency, and enough other things can be bought with it, people will stop thinking of the price in USD or EUR or whatever. Cashing out fees are much higher than trading/transfer fees because fiat is involved, so this helps the fee problem too.

Whether or not the above will happen is one of the big questions, but there is also a common argument that bitco doesn't have to be used directly as a currency to be valuable, if enough people adopt it as a store of value. 
That's where bitcoin needs to go. Some technology, like a bitcoin debit card, needs to be developed that can either cheaply convert the coin to whatever currency the vendor uses or have the vendor accept the coin as payment. That's where I can see crypto going to the moon
trend looks positive ?
open graph 1days and repeat this...
Feels a bit tense in here...no, lol.

I’m a long term holder too so I don’t really care the next 48hrs.
But I am watching to see if we stay above that Feb 6th low....why would a long term holder care, because even if those of us who bought over a year are still way up I absolutely do want to see that Feb 6th support level hold, and as we all know, it’s likely that “if” we break below our Feb 6th low, the odds are it will be within the next few weeks. Every week we stay above that support level the law of permanence creeps into investors minds.

For many of us, we still have a hard time buying because we remember buying at cheaper prices. Every week this price becomes more part of what is consider the normal price and the memory of buying $2000 Bitcoin becomes  farther and farther into our memories and replaced with the new norm.

Respecting the support level of Feb 6th is a pretty big deal for me. Because if it doesn’t hold then we need to rebuild the permanence of value at the new price.

Gratitude for the people who haven’t sold. It’s a sign of solidarity that I admire.

General trend isn't positive, it was negative, the rally to 7500 was brief and the hour candle looks like it's reversing back down.
Then back to $7200-$7500 rinse repeat, perhaps or down lower this time.
I have filled my fridge with slaughtered bull meat! It will last entire summer 😋
You sound quite ..... American
I hate Bcash just as much as the next guy, but I don't see how its demise will spur on the market.
Why? That is completely illogical
Nope, not untill tether bubble is busted...
hashtag denialstage
Not to be a party pooper, but whatever momentum bitcoin had the last few days is gone. 
source?
I feel that right now is very important moment, if this goes back to 7k, many ppl may believe it's recovering and invest more. If it falls farther, everyone may start selling.
No offence, but you are so deludedly bullish, and have been for a while. Just yesterday you were posting that we definitely wouldn't hit $7k again (it looks as though you've deleted the post/s). Wise up, man. 
I am totally ready to buy 1 BTC for 100,000 Pennies.
price went up $500.- in the last 4 days! 
They pumped that btc with empty tether very nicely - now they have slowly deflate this bubble in order not to get busted....I cant wait bitconnect scenario with tether :) shit will be juicy
Once simply does not move on from MT GOX. We will all keep getting fucked, over, and over, and over again. 

Or grandchildren will know the plague on humanity that is MT GOX, and their grandchildren, and their grandchildren and so on and so forth. Now and until the end of time.
>Confidence could get destroyed.

This is what we might actually need. Another panic sell-off, so we can restart the market cycle for good.

But I'd like it to be over already. It's no fun.
I think we have but we may still bounce off it again until enough steam builds up to conquer 7k.  Great time to buy.  Wish I had more fiat to put in.

Who knows but buy with cost averaging. Don't go all in 
A bunch of quilts, apparently.
A whole bunch of tax knowledge. Bitcoin isn’t considered legal tender in many countries. So there are tax implications for accepting an asset as payment.


BTCPay, BitPay, Pretty sure you can post your wallet address and people can just send to that if they'd like.  
do you mean, like an actual physical shop, or just an online one?
I guess either way the requirements should be the same. 

we need chipped card wallets...
Why would anyone use btc for large expenditures now when the price is in the dumps? That's no different from selling it into fiat at a loss and using fiat for things. Using btc for transactions will remain pointless with this volatility anyway, who wants to accept something in their business that could be worth 0 in a years time? 
Ya'll get so caught up in the ups and downs. It goes up a bit and everyone thinks it has to keep going up. Goes down a bit everyone comes on here like it's the end of the world. In the words of a great Australian hero, just fkn relax aye 
I just banked on the dip. Thanks I guess.
Maybe platforms like kraken, bitstamp, gdax etc are the big whales,who knows
Don't forget that every time the price action changes direction it's always either a "bull trap" or a "bear trap". Oh and, simultaneously, when the price goes 5% in one direction it's always either a start of a bull run or the end of Bitcoin.
You underestimate the Quilt Whales who are sucking all the money out of this thing for their luxurious and colorful bed covers.
Not happening.  I'm holding the line with me <1 BTC!!! #Resist
Not whales the Italian Cartelli
This article is a special kind of stupid
Maybe I am thick, but what does that mean? You have 39 bitcoin and no cash?
No one knows. There's a strong case for under $6k levels. 
You mean how this message is reaching out to the world ?
So did I listened to these so called financial advisors 3 years ago and missed the opportunity to be a millionaire. lol 
Wait till you graduate to trading in the nude!
H like....hoooorseshit...Ahum....

We all know when there is a 6k target it's gonna get there
Redditor for 1 week
Truly, people should be happy that bitcoin is at least floating around 6k. Even if it went down to 5 or 4k, that's a great feat for what's currently only a speculative thing. The most exciting part of all this is that it's still so new that nobody knows what bitcoin is yet! They don't know if it will live, die, become a currency, or a store of value.

But, its staying power isn't out of the question. I'm not religious, but in my city the police reroute traffic on Sundays for a mega-church downtown. Some say that God isn't even real, yet "God" has palpable effects on us.
Out of curiosity, what keeps folks from using another cryptocurrency instead?
**"You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make the sheep drink"** *or something like that.*
That's .05 btc divided evenly to every American or .002 divided evenly to every earthling.  (I went with 8 billion world population.)
BitcoinAlways I hate everything about individuals like you. You people are like televangelists preaching prosperity theology to desperate people looking to get away from a life of poverty for some financial freedom. The reality is Bitcoin may NEVER hit 1 million, but if it does, it’s a very long time from today. I think by Jan. 2022, Bitcoin will hit $40,000 which is a very realistic projection based on past trends. However, that excites no one especially by suggesting that Bitcoin will first experience tremendous stagnancy for the next few years. I predict by Nov. 2018, Bitcoin will be $4000. Today, it’s about $6800. This news does not excite anyone even though it’s far more realistic than your bullshit.
thanks for posting need to be reminded of the positive stuff
Dude, you you promised me in March BTC will be 12.5. Remember?
Lol ..... blockchain has been replicated literarily to over a thousand alts so if that's your preposition, it's pretty silly.  

And scarcity means nothing if there's no demand.  I can safely bet that there's less than 16M Beanie Babies out there.
The term moon recently switched from an astronomical body to getting caught with your pants down.


Their rocket crash landed. Just after taking off. 
don't worry we are still going to the moon. Just small delay in launch. Happens all the time. 
They forgot their space suits before taking off
Oh, we're mooning. Just have to pass through this here door. A moon door if you will. ^^^Mooooo^^ooooOOOO^^OOONNN ...splat
Yep, just a bunch of FUDers like yourself!
Those of us that bought several years ago have seen multiple moons already. At this point it's house money to play with. 
But,but,but,but,but. “Bitcoin is free from governments”
Probably heading towards $3-4k now based on the trend
If you purchased at $6500 6 months ago, you would have exactly $6500. Breaking even is a win at the casino. 
A bear trap on a long decline is very unlikely, sadly.
WHAT ARE YOU SINKING ABOUT
So , you are saying it won't go up drastically because there is little use right now for it, and that people are both slow and lazy to accept bitcoin at small businesses across the country?
Exactly ! We have more room to go down and we might stay low a long time ... Still extremely bullish on the long term, HODL and accumulate !
Hyperwave broke, if 4k doesnt hold we will visit 1.3k before going back up. Sadly it seems likely
Pro tip:  Number sold = number bought.   

Look up "Volume"
What does "usual bull and bear traps" means?
I think it’s more likely we’ll see the $6-7k region before that happens.
That bitch) 
March = Yes (API), April = No
5 years is too far. I cant even think where it will be after 5 mins. 
Bitcoin may no longer exist in 5 years. There could be a massive war in 5 years.

You could use basic inflation theory though.
175k per coin in 5 years.   Adoption wise you will start to see it accepted by major online retailers like amazon. Probably see it being accepted at Whole Foods and target and Walmart type retailers as well.  People will just pay using the bitcoin wallet bar code on their smart phone.    The prices will still be in local currency (e.g usd) but you can pay the total bill in bitcoin.  Similar to Apple Pay.       

Bonus: in 10 years bitcoin will be 300k+
HODLers prefer to stand under a tree during a lightening storm.
No, you should take cover.
I have a buy order ready at $1
Maybe I should set one at $280 which is when I unfortunately sold all my bitcoins.
We may clearly see who is desperate in this sub posting these lame assumptions to prop up melting hopes ..mustve bought at 19K LOL
All pump will be dumped, this happens a lot, especially in recent days.
I did
Dont worry, admins from exchanges do short as well. 
100,000,000 satoshis
$0,04 because the world will work with the dollarcoin issued by the FED
Ah ... another sign of the desperate justifying a deflating bubble.

"Don't look at TODAY!  Look into the FUTURE!"

It's a variation of:

"Look at the price on the way up the peak of the bubble!!"

I'm going to go ahead and group you in with the "Bitcoin will hit 1 million" guys. 

have a nice day crazy pants! :)
Ya and if not, it always worth seeing macfee eat his own dick. 
My mom reminds me of that wonderful scenario every day, as she predicts she will be the next lottery winner.
what if the world uses dollarcoin issued by the FED And btc is $0,003

will you still smile? 
Shouldn't be a "K" behind the number.  Need to find that symbol for cents...
Lol
I rather not associate bitcoin with political news anymore.  Ive realized btcs ups and downs have nothing to do with holidays, news, politics, stock market, etc..
Bitcoin is its own roller coaster ride non associating with others, therefore NOT PREDICTABLE.
But when you read the actual news on here it says that’s NOT the reason. Hmmm 
3....2.....1 and bammmm, deleted. 
aw you and your mom sold your 100$?

Again? I though it "was done" 2 years ago.
My friends are buying :)
Hahahaha. Thank your friends for me when they buy back in at 12 k in june

It's the Stock market, People are taking profits from crypto to cover losses simialer to what happens to when altcoins go down following Bitcoin. I think the Cartel is reavaluating their next move since they were recently caught by a very brave exchange who stood up to them.
is it really easier for you to believe a conspiracy theory than believing there’s just not enough interest in BTC right now? 
Ooor, just maybe, no one thinks it's worth more than this and is willing to pay up to prove it. 
makes no sense? It makes perfect sense to me. 

if whales and the cartel are suppressing BTC a lot of people will never see gains and have to file a loss on tax return and forget a new ATH.
This post is proof that the fudsters have no sense of humor at all.  

Did you have a nice day off yesterday? I see you guys are back in full force today.  
This forum has very little to do with Bitcoin's followers, this is just a collection of odds balls from all over the world :) 
At least their not calling them Didlos
I feel the same way about the 'cash out' phrase. There are a lot of young/immature proponents of BTC, but let's be even-handed here: there's life outside of the noob 'traders' on reddit and 4chan. 

There's serious activity in BTC from hedge funds, billionaire investors, financial markets, and nations like Japan that consider BTC legal currency. Heck, the SEC/CFTC/IRS and Senate consider cryptocurrency to be more than just magic internet money; a point that should give pause to skeptics.
Most likely if you're selling right now it's to stop the bleeding and you never want to think about bitcoin again.
Depends on the country. Some countries are less than 2000 USD and other countries like South Korea are as high as 26000 USD
And this is why I put solar up all around my home.
Without instrinic value, the door to $0 has always been open whenever sentiment dictates.
Where does 6400 support come from? Why that number?
Just like 6 months ago. Your money has been effectively wasted if you HODL for 6 months.
is dead for you...
many people are in earning mode
Bye. 
Yup, can wait to move my money from an insured bank account to an exchange waiting to be hacked. 
At least I can buy lunch with my actual money. Enjoy having every bit of worth squeezed out of you by this pump and dump.
My money will not be available anymore in bank soon as every month is a new dip and a new bags filling for me. If it continue like that for all the 2018, at the eoy I will have only BTC!! :)
At least until the lights go out.  Or you can't log in to your account.  Or you can't withdraw from your account.  My money in the bank increased slightly over the past 30 days while Bitcoin is down 40%.  I am not a proponent of the banks but I do not believe Bitcoin will be the solution.
I think there’s a lot of money on the sidelines thinking the same thing.

Hillary lost. Bernie lost. The GOP controls the executive branch, legislative branch, and judicial branch. How on earth are the liberals behind a state conspiracy to take your bitcoins?
Although not from the US, I was cheering on Bernie from the sidelines
Um Bernie supports auditing the Fed, teamed up with Ron Paul. Hillary was an authoritarian Liberal, Bernie is a libertarian liberal, Trump is an authoritarian conservative, Ron Paul is a libertarian conservative. There are two axes (actually more but) Left-Right and Libertarian-Authoritarian. 
do you have any tin foil I could borrow by any chance? 
This doesn't even make any sense.

It's like the "Libruls r comin fer our guns!!!" bullshit times 10.
lol!
This same question was asked 3 months ago and people were saying 9 or 10k - look what happened.
I feel that we need to test the early February lows before the market will be happy to go higher. So around 6k then bounce upwards. However, if we stay around 6k for a few days, we could go lower to 4.5-5k
It's going to take MONTHS or even YEARS to go back to ATH. People can't immagine how much new money was put in at ath and how much hype you need to get back to ath. This hype won't come back cause hypes only come once. So you need organic growth, which takes months/years. 
My low prediction is July (or as late as July, maybe some earlier).  Not sure what the price will be, but I think it will be another 3 months before we really start recovery.

ATH... Roflmao
Now go back and source that linked comment with a link to this comment for added fun.
FUD
So will USD always be the benchmark?
That would require a crystal ball no?
how often are you doing that though 
How can you price something in a currency that swings like BTC?
Care to elaborate?
Actually, I think you are into something here, look how difficult (rightly) that it is to have access to your current stash of crypto across multiple sources with multiple passwords and authentication.      Now think how difficult it will be if you (and your saved passwords/devices are not available....... Suspect that many will just disappear
agree, this is an issue.  Crypto type banks need to exist.  Perhaps its companies like Coinbase or Gemini.  Or perhaps traditional banks will eventually have custodian services.  
Well of course it's value goes up when it's market value goes up. It would have to...
Market cap***
So it's a store of value then. I agree. It's not a currency.
This should not be unexpected when investing in something as volatile as bitcoin.  Have these people panicking never looked at a long term chart?  Bitcoin has had many large "crashes" in the past - and yet people are surprised by a 70% decline.  Very short sighted thinking. 
Study the moving averages.  It's not going up consistently any time soon.
Thanks bro. Appreciate the advice. I’m not happy it’s dropping. It’s demoralizing... however, I also watched (without buying) it go from 1,000 to 20k and finally bought in at 8k. I’ve no doubt it will be above 8 k in 2018. But these dips can and will control your whole day if you allow it. No one has ever been buried with dollars or digital coins. Aaron Rodgers: RELAX

According to coindesk, ideally we would be atleast at $7k today.  

https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-bulls-need-to-defend-7k-as-corrective-rally-stalls/
Yeah. Just wishful thinking. Wake me up when September ends and either btc is 50,000 or 5. 
I thought that was good news?
Not yet I will now though.
Usd. It’s the same for any fiat with btc?

Being a long term roller-coaster rider. What you view on recovery for rest of 2018? 
Well we are doing well so far. Nobody likes to acknowledge it though... we accomplished far more than everyone expected
Why would the government want to give up control of its own currency? 
People have been saying this since it was under $5...how new are you?
So salty, go and buy some, release yourself from that bitterness and daily trolling that you subject yourself to.  
Really? Take in consideration how Bitcoin started...

Lol? Look at all the FUD we have endured throughout the years, thats pretty incredible tbh.

Id say it reached similar levels of development as google or facebook did on their first nine years... keep in mind its a decentralized project... the biggest of its kind?


it didn't fail....it just fizzled a bit....
Sex. It's always about sex.
On point.
You don't have 10k to "invest" if you are using it for bills. And what you are describing "make money today, because bills are due today" is gambling, not investing. The first thing I do when I need to pay my mortgage is get on ditech online and click "pay now". No need to sell cypto, no need to sell stock, no need pull from my 401 or ira. You need a lesson in budgeting. If you cannot pay your bills with your salary, you should not be sinking it into a volitle speculative asset.
We love leaving surprises for you boys to wake up too!
wut?
very likely.
Perhaps it isn't lost, but just stuck kinda way the fuck up there at 9k like me?
Good riddance.
Nah, it will be hard to even reach 5.8k
She loves when I talk dirty, makes her get down low. She loves to take my money then take a huge dump all over it. Mmmmmmmm.... 
Pump and dump is something different than a "bull trap".
No, it doesn't.
He is always right. At least in the comments he didn't delete.
It's all about the equation F=MA, when you see A increase, you would think M will increase when M sees A increase, which will inturn cause F to increase. As a physicist, you should know that. It works both ways - up and down.
More like marriage 
It was waving at $7k.
I really don't see what you are seeing. But maybe that's why I would be a bad trader.
The hangover has lasted almost 3 months.  It’s time for another party 🎈 🍻 party 🎈 
There you go, someone gets it :\)
Thanks for replying.  I was confused because I had used it before.  
In this instance I was setting the price to slightly lower and slightly higher than the current value of BTC.  So a Limit Post Only can only be placed if it is for a lower price than the current value of BTC or not too close to the current value?
Definitely!
nah, look at the timing of the crash and the reddit post
Between 0.618 and 0.65 retracement.  This is where you should be buying on the dip and hence the name, the Gold Pocket.
We all understand how a transaction works. He's asking about the volatility. 
You know how lang that takes? When in Europe the national currencies switched to euro, there were special calculators for people to make the transition, because everyone still thought about value in the old national currency! In Belgium for example, a bread costed 1.5 euro... And everybody was calculating: 1 euro = 40 francs, so that's 60 francs for a bread. Okay. And even today, in 2018, family sometimes talks about big amounts in francs! 

Now this is what happened with the switch from national currency to euro, which was supported by the government, they issued special calculators, posters, campaigns etc etc. This is never going to happen with a switch to bitcoin. If such a switch were to happen, it would take so many decades...
I assume you are still watching the chart - genius.
Although I've held for a long time, I'm still very interested in the day to day prices.  I'm absolutely confident that people who bought at a relatively high price will get their returns - and that the major coin will be BTC.

The big question of course is how long this will take.
And so what?  BTC owner for 5 years - arrogant dolt.
Such a stupid comment
OK, but I disagree.
LOL! I am American. I live in Japan though. 
Because the (temporary) damage caused by Ver's failed, dying and lying project has been worse than widely appreciated, and has been underestimated.

Just let him have this...
Nope. I was watching the uptrend over the last few days very closely.  There is significant organic buying interest again I think because some people were expecting freefall below 5k. Didn’t happen.   Bottom is somewhere in the 6k range.   

The reason we are lower today is due to the irrational reaction to sudden FUD of the Chinese tariffs and stock market volatility. This is temporary and really has nothing to do with bitcoin.   I think once this passes bitcoin will continue its steady upward rise until 8k. Then it will accelerate.  I’m hoping for a slow steady rise after that but could start spiking as fomo kicks in.  
“Not to be a party pooper...” -> poops all over party

Untrue. Have never made nor deleted any such post.  You must have me confused with someone else.    

And time will tell how deluded I am with my bullish attitude. 
oh, I meant pesos. 5500k usd  lol
price went down $400.- in the last 1 hour! :D
I am starting to believe that. I reinvested at 6.5k and I had a feeling that these cocksuckers would come crawling out of their hole to fuck us all over again but didn’t anticipate so god damn soon.
just awful i see no real bottom anymore other than like 1k
Stocks recovered today
So I'd just give them my wallet address if it were in person, but I'd have to have bitpay etc. Or would any of the platforms work? Ie: coinbase, gdax etc.
That will never happen.  You think nerd money is going away? Did band-aid get beaten out by its competition? Velcro? Think before you speak. Bitcoin is the 1st cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency cannot be put back into pandora's box. End of story.
Wasn’t that Ali G of the Staines massiff?
This crash actually has a reason behind it though.
Yep, that seems to be the case more and more on this forum.  
"bull traps" and "bear traps" are not signs of market manipulation, but exactly what I was talking about: "traditional market psychology".
Means bitcoin fucked me over 39 times with it's nice dipppppssssss
Haha, no not this particular message, I suppose else where in the world on a remote radio sation someone is also advertising about Cryptocurrency.
You wouldn't have been, though. You would have doubled or tripled your investment and cashed out. We can all say in hindsight that we would have bought in at $100 and made millions, but it doesn't work that way in reality for the great majority.
These messages were mostly warnings on how to be careful about your investment. But its the first time i hear them mention cryptocurrency in their ad.
I believe the "H" symbolizes bit coins numerous ups and downs and the interactivity between them.

Not entirely silly. Anyone can start a Walmart competitor but it doesn’t mean people will shop there. Bitcoin has more security and more distribution and is more decentralized. And there’s the network effect too. Try starting a new Facebook and it’s not so easy. 
He appears to be on a boat and in distress
Yeah, exactly. 
No, I'm saying that the daytraders are driving prices, and that there has to be a fundamental change to knock the price out of its current channel. That fundamental change is more than what's been going on day-to-day anyway.
And I believe next level will be 0,13$. "Seems likely". Lol guys do you actually read yourself before posting something that ridiculous?
Bull: prices in market are rising. Bear: prices in market are falling. Traps means that the bull market is rising and suddenly it change it direction, thats why is called a trap, same thing to bear trap market.
I think we'll see 7.2 - 7.3 in the next few hours. Then down.
exactly every single drop concern me lot now onward.... price drop significantly and still going down that really bother me a lot 
[removed]
I hope you are right, I would be very happy with $25k per Bitcoin.
I have a buy order at 0.75
Im willing to sacrifice for the good of the bitcoin community
In all seriousness, I agree with you.
Are they really "that crazy?"  Next time i'll go with jeans.  Thanks for the tip.
You do that McAfee gets paid for tweeting about crypto
Maybe Bitcoin value will stay down until he eats his own dick, then after he is done eating and digesting his own dick the Bitcoin gods will be pleased and then Bitcoin value will shoot up over 1 mill
Literally just checked Coinbase then his tracking site before coming here to watch everyone cry. I should just bookmark it. 
Actually in my scenario he’d eat his dick either way since bitcoin would have to grow more than 100 times its value to reach 1 million per coin in a little less than 3 years.   I’d love that to be true but I think my prediction of 10-20 times current value by then is more probable. 
Hello there funny guy.  You must be a nocoiner.  Oh, and a redditor for 5 days...
I know 😂
Bitcoin is corelated with fiat apocalypse. Every abd news, market colapse... bitcoin rises
I wouldn't bet on anything right now.
Just checked the Stock market, Looks like it will not end the day that bad so this shouldn't be affecting Bitcoin
Really? Source? Sounds like awesome news
The question is what made people give up bitcoin ? 
Typed it with a smile on my face. So whose the ASSumer now haha!
Dilly Dilly!

He never invested any money. He is a paid troll.
It's just a pump and dump playground now. That's all it's good for.
Prepare to see bitcoin drop even further and never recover. Be smart think about your mental and financial well being.
You can buy bitcoin and get your privat key, so you need no exchange. But believe what you want. People didnt learn from the bank crisis in 2008. Bitcoin fucked up because of moon and lambo people like you. 
Yes, there is a lot of money on the sidelines that would not invest into an asset that cannot go one day without a major sell off and loses value by the minute. Oh and it is also manipulated by who the fuck knows?
haha and which comes first!

>Hillary was an ~~authoritarian Liberal~~ center-right liberal tending towards neoliberalism, Bernie is a ~~libertarian liberal~~ Social Democrat (considered extreme nowadays lol), Trump is an authoritarian conservative (add strong tendencies towards protectionism), Ron Paul is a libertarian conservative (or right wing libertarian).

Depends on the stability of the currency in your country, many latin american countries will soon (5-10 years) experience a doze of Venezuelan magic... if that happens maybe it will be easier to measure things in satoshis :P
Didn't say it was gonna happen. Just saying people like having that option available. And based on what happened the last few years, people are willing to take a chance that it will happen again...And it did.
Totes malotes dawg
It can operate as both if you want to.
Whatever it was, that tweet didnt do anything good for the bitcoin. Everyone knew it was BS.
Imo $7k is already too low of a consolidation from 7.5k. Anyways that's out of the question now looking at the price.
it's not. Imo it adds even more FUD after reading all his posts.
When do you think it did hit 6200 the last time? In my book it was in February 2018 and before that in November and October 2017. And before that: never.
You mean 1M
> What you view on recovery for rest of 2018?

It'll go up or down or sideways. Noone knows.
However... Wider bitcoin adoption (either as means of exchange or store of value) should push the price up.






The ONLY accomplishment is that it's price is speculated higher than anyone expected and it's now crashing slowly like a deflating balloon.  

That's a fact that people here are experiencing and understand.
Can you explain "give up control of its own currency?" Not sure what you mean.
They won't.  Period.  

It's an instrument of fiscal policy, which the fools here will not understand.
He’s only 2 days old. Just look at his reddit account. Paid shill.
Facebook and Google blew up and were gaining new users exponentially... merchants are dropping bitcoin because it isn't effective...
Ask yourself what is BTC intended for (other than speculation) and you will have the answer - it's a failure.
Lambo = sex
You failed!
11.5K for me. 
One day it will climb back up. 
That's the spirit! Buy high/sell low. 


I just can't see a trap being set up by thousands of people at one time. Then it would just be a "natural" movement of the market.
Haha no.  Guess you flunked physics 101. 
Well played. 
This chart looks like its inviting me to invest. 
Lol happened at the same moment 
I think the only limitation is that the order would be a maker order that gets added to the order book, rather than being immediately filled due to an existing order. As such, if the highest existing BUY order is $100, you can place sell orders for anything above $100. It's quite easy to accidentally go the wrong side of the price, for a limit order to work, the deal has to be *better* for you than the current price (i.e. higher if you're selling, or lower if you're buying).
No, it crashed because the moving averages crossed on the 15m and 1h charts.  Look at the charts.
Thanks
Whoever buys the bitcoin takes on the risk of the volatility. (For example, the store isn't taking the risk because their instantly converting $22.71 worth of bitcoin). 
I didn't suggest it was an easy change, nor that it would ever happen for certain... The point is if you want to use bitcoin to buy groceries we need much wider adoption. But the value of bitcoin doesn't depend on being able to buy bread with it.
lol
Agreed. I’m able to be patient 
He's a known troll
Can I come live with you?
I don't think Chinese tariffs and trade wars have anything to do with bitcoin, that's only with stocks. 

Your "thinking" and "hoping" are nothing but pure speculation. And you are basing your confidence that the price will go up on the hope that it will since you want to see bigger returns for yourself.

I'm not sure that's useful for anyone.
gl
If that is true then I apologise - and I hope you're right, I just doubt that you are. 
...which doesn't make my first statement wrong. 
lol :D
We are currently above 6.8k so there is nothing stopping you from taking profit and buying in again at a lower price if you believe MT GOX will have any effect on the price
I'm pretty sure, there are a lot of investors waiting on the sidelines. Waiting for the moment when pure desperation kicked in, and the price falls really deep, to get a lot of coins for cheap.

But then again, this is just my personal feeling. Because I don't see the technology go away anytime soon.
not really
Could well be. I was thinking of Trent from the Punchy massif
Which is?
They may or may not be. The thing is that not every price swing is a "trap".
annnnnddddddd guess who controls market psychology... hint, it's not the minnow investors
39 times must be understating it, surely? Yes, hurting me too, I am down about 8% - but is only on around 10% of my investments.
At first I thought the message about risky investment was reaching out to the world. 
I heard some similar ads few years ago and accepted their "too Risky" idea. And should have known that more risk means more profits back then...
Or going off the grid
Or, if cryptos are so effing great then why do you have to have a half hour discussion with someone to convince them they're work looking into?  
ROFL!

The other possibility is that the cryptos we know today will be dusted to the bins of history and great-grandchildren can tell stories of how stupid you were.  
You comparing a digital token with FB and Walmart?

FB generated $15B profit for it's shareholders and Walmart generated $13B.

BTC?  $0

So anyone paying more than $1 for BTC is overpaying.  The only reason why it's priced more than that is pure speculation based on the belief that it may be worth more in future.

Let me help you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR0lWICH3rY


I would love to buy at that price though, I only feel comfortable doing small buys at this level
What an idiot.  So what are you even doing here then.  I think the technology is great and it is. Just a matter of time before it catches on. 
Found the guy buying at $19k. 
I have a sell order at $1M. Let's see where it goes first.
be a man and go pantless, it's the only way to roll my friend.
Duh!
buy the dip!
If that were the case, btc is just acting like precious metals. The value doesn't inherently change, it just adjusts for a drop in the purchasing power of your currency. Also, calling a potential tradewar market collapse is getting ahead of ourselves. 
The value dropping 70% in a couple months
They did not give it up.  They just got scammed into buying high and are now illiquid or too scared to buy.  When well known top holders are telling you that Bitcoin is going to 100k or 1 million each, they create a FOMO.  This is no better than a Ponzi scheme.  In just the last month, Bitcoin is down more than 40%.  There were so many sell signals all the way down from the top but FOMO turned these fools into HODLers.  HODL in my opinion is Holding On Despite Logic.  The exchanges are prone to hacking, scams abound, no regulation=no recourse, the blockchain technology is free, it is too volatile to be used on a wide scale and yet people pay $6800, $10,000, $15,000, $19,000 and more for one coin out of 21 million.  It is a shame because I believe most of those that bought at the higher prices did not have the money to lose.
How would anyone here know how much some random person on the internet invested or not? This very statement speaks volumes about who the 'troll' really is. Besides on what planet would someone get paid for trolling?
uh, I just lost $300 thanks. I lost it because I was listening to all the nonsense about how great it's going to be. IN order for it to be great, it really is one step short of a banking revolution, and it's highly unlikely that banks will allow it.
Thanks so much for your concern :)
Lol.
Zimbabwe dollars
You're right.
Are the coffee shops everything they're hyped up to be? Would love to someday buy a joint there with BTC 
Substitute Left and right for liberal and conservative, you are correct.
It might be boring, but it's the level I want before I'd be willing to buy a few more bitcoins
How can something that loses over 50% of its value be an inflation hedge? 
Think of this what you want, but I like to use this as an indicator of how well the Bitcoin price is doing. Not so well, lately.

Right, in October the day graph showed 2 big red candles, one slightly lower than 6200, thus the four times. Theres a baby red in October too for the maybe 5
Maybe one day. 
Very useful insight, smh
It seems you are just another sheep that cant see past the price. Can you explain me why then does this asset have a futures market? Why does every big institution has investments in the exchanges? Why do regulators agree its here to stay and they should help it grow?

I said similar levels of development... Its harder for users to use and understand Bitcoin since it requieres you to see the Truth of the financial system, but from the number of wallets and transactions Id say we are experiencing similar growth
BTC has worked perfectly since its creation. Its a success by every metric 
Just wait
Didnt sell anything. Over my dead body. 
No one sets up traps. Are you positive you understand what bear and bull traps are? 
A bull trap can be a collective effort of false expectations.

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bulltrap.asp
I want your drugs.
I appreciate the explanation. I think I will need to dedicate some proper time to studying this! Thanks again.
If it's known, why did you have to say it? Obviously you're a troll projecting your own self. Based on your comment history, it's obvious.
Sure if you can clean my house. I don't like doing that.
That’s my gut feeling due to my observations. Take it or leave it.  I don’t really care.  
I would rather buy “hope” in this market. Charts and all shit TAs have proven wrong time and again. Everyone is sending random TAs in every direction and changing opinions literally as bitcoin moves from red to green and vice versa. 
Not a problem. Apology accepted.  
 just outdated 
No.
Imo the investors that are waiting are not going to be spurred to coming in again until there’s a few month of stabilization. I don’t see why they’d be prompted to move in once it falls to a certain level or if it starts going up again when the last few months have shown that even if it goes up, it’ll fall twice as hard. Plus the mass inflow in December was a lot of new investors who got their fingers bit hard with the drop, those investors are not coming back for a long time.
probably true question is -- whats cheap --
"trap" is just the word for this particular pattern. Don't take it literally. A "bull flag" or a "bear flag" aren't actual "flags", as well.
The technology is great. But is BTC? Maybe it will be another coin. 
I'm wearing only my shorts and topless.

And I will continue to do that till it reaches 9k.
Look at every big corp - 1 bad news = -9% of share price. Look facebook, tesla, uber...
Yep, with plenty of opportunities (and signs) to get out.
Personally, I believe you're a volunteer troll.
.75 an hour in Indonesia
Who makes two vastly different statements over a period of 5 mins and then deletes them ? 
I agree. Dont listen to any expert in here. Just do what your own research tells u to do. Many people are here just to create FUD or FOMO or they have this hobby of making bold statements.
That is not a thing anymore
Oh god yes its the best Weed I ever had, and You can buy super strong edibles too. Didnt See one that accepted BTC tho
too expensive I think
So your prediction has just been pulled out your arse? 
How much is it up in the last year? Don't buy during high speculation periods.
What's the last useful insight on bitcoin that you've seen?
I sold last night my time when when the dip happened. It triggered my Stop Order. (can I be blamed for selling then?) I bought in again this morning with a little extra on top because the getting is good. (my time) 
Just some Chivas 
Lol
I hate messes almost as much as I hate cleaning them up.
Just the price on its own is cheap already. But they watch the sentiment in the market, and that's not desperate enough. People are still too optimistic. And when that's the case, the price can go even lower.
Well, no. A "trap" is a price action contrary to the signal preceeding it. For example if you see a bull flag followed by the price going down, that's a bull trap. The price approaching major resistance level and then going back down is not a "trap", since most traders (as opposed to gamblers) are not going to open positions before the breakout is confirmed, and therefore won't become "trapped". I keep seeing bull traps and bear traps mentioned here every day, even though there are none in the charts.
I cede that possibility, but bitcoin currently has first mover advantage, publicity, and notable players (Winklevoss twins, John mcafee, Tom lee etc.). Not to mention a vast network of nodes and miners with a vested interest in seeing bitcoin succeed.  IMO bitcoin is unstoppable in the long run. 
You're naming the 3 tech companies who had massive problems in the past two weeks. Using them as the focal point for the market as a whole instead of seeing they are the exception is your call, but I wouldn't recommend it.
Look at dow jones, nasdaq, whatever and unzoom to 5 years or to max. It looks like bitcoin at 30. Dec. 2017. Everything is going downward. https://www.google.cz/search?q=dow+jones&gws_rd=cr,ssl&dcr=0&ei=193EWoX0LKvU6ASa9amgDA
If you are talking about me, I am not a troll. I am actually someone who invested, but to be quite honest, none of the stuff people say here, makes any sense to me. It's all hypothetical and not real. When people say that it's going to be 100k in 6 months, I am like, it was 6k for the last 6 months, so what is different? That more banks in China said so? 

I agree that the technology is amazing. But you are asking people to give up two things: CASH which they will never do, and PAY EXTRA to convert their paychecks into Bitcoin which it MORE difficult to buy things with. There is zero added bonus, and well, people are lazy. Just as Apple Pay failed to gain enough marketshare, but was a great idea, so too will be bitcoin. 

Everytime I watch the videos with people talking about global currency, one thing strikes me as odd. They keep talking as if the United States and global economies are going to suddenly collapse, and go to war, and dollars will be worthless. Here is the thing. If I am in America, and the thing collapses, Dollars will be very valuable in America because nobody will have any. We will all be on bread lines and looking for spare change. Electronic currency will be of little to no value because the first thing people do when there is a problem is allow "ONLY CASH". Not Credit, Bitcoin, or any other currency. I think the same fo the Euro or Brit Pound. If you are living in those countries and things go bad, having Pounds on hand is where the wealth is, not electronic currencies. 

So while I don't disagree with the premise of Bitcoin, I think it will take a revolution to get it to where it makes millionaires out of the guy who bought $1k worth. By that time, Governments will either outlaw it, or find some way to tax it because the Banks control everyone.
Aren't all predictions?
That is obviously an exception not the norm.
The one from kodaplays. 
Same, but don't clean it up too good or I won't be able to find anything. There's a balance.
To give some perspective as an outsider, $7000 for an internet token is not 'cheap'.
Cheap for me is $16 when I originally bought Bitcoin in the year 2011.
No, I was answering to and talking about goldbergger. But maybe this is your other account?
You are focussing for BTC to replace the current payment systems, which it will most likely not. However, I truly believe bitcoin will be better than gold. Gold is a 8 trillion market, enough gains for me.
Not really, a prediction is based on some sort of data/theory that backs it up. Not saying your wrong, and my predictions are right. But In your case I might as well just close my eyes and put my finger to the screen.
Is Silver not a hedge against inflation if you bought it at it's peak? Gold? 
Right? I know exactly where everything is at on the floor. Straightening things up upsets that delicate balance.
How about $0.00007 for 1 Satoshi?
no. I am not jewish. I thought you were talking to me.
I suppose that's true. I'm not a fan if precious metals in 2018. I have posted before I see btc more as a storage if wealth then a currency. 
Silver and Gold hold their prices because they are accepted as precious commodities and held in reserves by governments.

BTC is a digital token that is nothing but an entry in an electronic ledger.  Similar tokens have been forked or using other technologies resulting in over 1,000 alts.
That almost escalated to a love story. 
This is true! When things are packed away in closets even if you know where it is you have to dig it out and then put it back. Nothing you use regularly should be packed up like that. 
It can be both. Certain things need to happen with law and tech in order to get there.

Bitcoin isn't something you look at in it's current condition. It's something you look at as the framework for building a new system. 

Things will change as time goes on.
>Silver and Gold hold their prices because they are accepted as precious commodities and held in reserves by governments.

What happens when large governments start holding Bitcoin/Crypto in their reserves? 

>BTC is a digital token that is nothing but an entry in an electronic ledger.

You should do a bit more reading. Or you're intentionally over simplifying. 
Who says this is over? :D
BTC may not even survive as an item of interest beyond this year.

That's a possibility that can't be ignored.
Yeah they said that in 2014 too.
