*eats his popcorn 🍿 watching shorters getting rekt*. HODL
Consensus FOMO kicking in. See y'all on the moon.
**Support The Bulls!**
Wow looks like this is FOMO time. Glad I loaded up this morning.
Everyone's saying consensus is a dud and then this happens lol.
Happy to see that push this morning. Was honestly feeling pretty down a couple days ago but my belief in Bitcoin will never die! 
After leeching off other people's nodes for such a long time, I finally managed to setup my own node running on a spare Linux machine. Feels good.
After all the BS it's still here...... always bouncing back......just buy it pussies... damn... 😁
as a chinese,watch live all night is so hard,but i don,t want miss btc pull up!

Hey folks do you think btc will reach 10k by the end of this year?

Did Snoop Dogg just buy into bitcoin?
The f guys what’s up with blocks... been waiting for hour already for confirmation. 
Legal gambling has to be good news right? 
Nice to see the upward price movement with high volume. Last few weeks it was the complete opposite.
9k never felt so close.
I know you hate this question, but let’s have a meaningful discussion and try to analyze what is the possible answer of this months old question: When moon?
Is anyone here attending the Consensus meeting over the next few days?
lol, wtf just happened xD
Anyone else at work and listening to the Consensus live?
Look at that greeeen dildoo!
God I love bitcoin
Could do with a huge $1000 Green Candle! 
The bulls are back in town!
Just a little run away from  5 digits 
Here we go guys. Don't be surprise to see big pumps during consensus 2018.

Woohoo! 😄
eat my shorts
6K NEVER AGAIN!

Nice volume, thanks New York.
I just witnessed a lot of broke dick spoofing on both sides just now. Stupid bots...
got a ways to go if we want to get to the 200 day moving average.  looks like the volume has dropped since the bump
I really don't know what to think of this rise. Sure, I'm always happy when the price goes up.

But it looks suspicious to me. 

A return of the Bart times?

Anyway, I hold and buy the dips. Everything will be fine in the long run...
I finally made the switch to segwit after months of procrastinating, seeing the recent hike in fees gave me flashbacks from December lol. 
Here we go.  Dilly Dilly 
Let’s get to 10k this week !!!
There’s a good chance that we’ll see a spike after the consensus followed by a massive dump. We will keep seeing spikes and dumps and will not reach 15k until Mt Gox (the giant terd stain) is scrubbed and finally forgotten.
What is going on with confirmations? I sent a transaction 3 hours ago with adequate fees (well over adequate) and we're looking at 22k unconfirmed now when it was only 6k unconfirmed 3 hours ago
looks like another bart simpson pattern
I said that yesterday would be the last day of $8k BTC, I was wrong.  Today will be the last day of 8k BTC
The whole 2018 has sucked so far when are we going to get into the 100k region that's what I expect of bitcoin not this piddley mother truckin SHIT...........COME ON....
Are we still expecting a surge upwards as it's Consensus week? 
**Come On Bulls, don't waste this week!**
The FUD from shills is like a manual.

Price goes down: Haha never another $15.00 buttcoin

Price goes up: Hurr durr muh free tx's 


So bitcoiners, how did the weekend treat you all? hands up who was able to use BTC in their day to day activities this weekend?
seems like it's going to be a bumpy ride of volatility/uncertainty until these Mt. Gox coins are flushed out
let it get it..!
Vegeta memes when?
Bruh this is getting me crazy fr.
long bart, or wide bart?  
I want to help my uncle be able to set his brick and mortar store front up to accept bitcoin, how do I do it ? 
(Hypothetical) can anyone point me in the right direction for set ups, videos, where to purchase little scanned bois, anything related, YouTube videos, anything. I want to learn how people do it cuz if crypto booms this summer I want to start a business called lucky lemons where it’ll be like a Chick-fil-A except it’s just the lemonade and possibly toasted meat and cheese sandwiches.

My other uncle (reality) is running a “factoring receivables” business working with small businesses to pay them money owed to them in xx days - right now, around 95% of it,  (so they can use it to grow now and make more), in exchange for their receivable, 100% of  it.  I can’t think of a way to work crypto into this especially since smart contracts aren’t prevalent at all yet. But I know Reddit is a host to very smart folks.

Thank you to any who reply.
it's a woagee market

woa - it's  going back to moon

gee - it isn't

don't be a woagee
hi when moon
We are going to go down from here until the end of may as this was an event triggered push but i expect it to pick up in June and go to the moon
Lubin just got ass r····d by Jimmy Song at Consensus haha
MtGox moved 44k BTC to another adress. They are getting ready to make next big dump. 
For people who say blockchain tech is useless read this    https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hsbc-blockchain/hsbc-says-performs-first-trade-finance-transaction-using-blockchain-idUSKCN1IF01X
Any place to see Consensus online?

Alt
we need to go to 1,5k again to weed out the non believers and moon boys
[removed]
Very happy to see it lose all its progress.
I just want my money back at this point I don't even want a dollar profit is that really too much to ask?
[removed]
Use their tears to salt it
Popcorn and bear steaks, nothing better
will do by hodling!
Thanks.
this is my favorite comment on the thread
i....totally...understand this comment...
If bitcoin doesn't hit 10k by the end of July, I'll eat a dick.
By end of this month
Maybe.
More than 20k.
12k target for a month 
i hope not, my goal is 0.5btc by EOY, and with btc at 8k is easier than with btc at 10k or 20k.


> "Opening discussions, though a tad one-sided in their projections"

Can you explain?
hodizzle
Not sure, same shit here going on 3 hours; the unconfirmed was at 6k when I sent it in now were looking at over 22k unconfirmed
What do you mean? 
Aaaaand it's gone!
20 July 1969
If we don't see bitcoin at least around 17k before the end of the year I would be surprised.
We had a massive bull run that may not return for a few more years. But the pipes are being built so I wouldn’t expect to wait too long...maybe 2019
Honestly for me since the two, or three failed attemps to make 10.000 a big floor \(and so is becoming roof\). I didn´t expect the moon, so I move Hold to Trade just a month ago, cutting losses and saving profits. I am ok with this situation, of course I prefer moon, but this situation is ok too, but I understand that most of the holders were upset. 
No, but perhaps taking a peek into the livestream: https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2018/live/
wached too xD it will just go down again :/
Oh I didn't know you could do that. Where can you listen/watch it?
> Anyone else at work and listening to the Consensus live?

Fed shilling the dollar 
Weak bulls are weak. They want to go to sleep.
Soooooo. you’re saying this is from Mt Gox?
I now own .75 coin.  Not a lot but it’s a lot to me. 
If 6-8k is shitting the bed, and it's "the bottom" of 2018... I look forward to December of 2018. 
"redditor for 3 months"
  
This is cute. Going down 80% is a Bitcoin bear, this is nothing. 
Fuck yeah!
Ideally we would get above $9k but $8.8k at close today will be ok. 
Classic case of self-FUD :)
Consensus, bub.
Shit this is looking like a Bart forming dammit 
Dilly Dilly🍻
When Moon? When Lambo?
You people continue to give too much credit to the Mt Gox trustee...
It's convenient to blame Mt. Gox, but really, moving such a small amount is not such a big deal. 
Do you know how much Gox have left?
woo big spikes today

https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,24h
I really hate those sudden pumps. I prefer slow steady growth. Those pumps stop a lot of people from trading because at a certain point one agent can just dump. 
I agree.  Where are the bulls to pick up where the Bart left off?
I’ll save you the trouble.  Tomorrow will be the last day of 8k.
No.
I don't know, can you repeat the question ?
Yes. 
Perhaps
Let’s go bulls, let’s go!  Close the daily on a green instead of red. 
bulls are tired, need to rest now... Imma let the bears take over
"Hands up who was able to use BTC in their day to day activities this weekend?"  \- the same order I've heard when police came to my home yesterday
Drug dealers?
It will go mainstream any day now....
Helped friend set up first wallet,  sent some BTC
Hopefully later tonight. 
Bart will be here soon, no doubt.
You might want to start that as a new thread by itself. Might get more attention that way.
in the monsoon... 
Not sure which interview you watched...
wat?
I perceived it as just the opposite. Lubin appeared like a genuinely nice person who tried to stay on topic and have an actual conversation. Song repeatedly interrupted him, behaving like an obnoxious wannabe rock star.
Watched it - accurate description.  Will be interesting to follow their wager.  I think Jimmy's getting a little too cynical for his own good, but still probably correct.
Bitcoin and shitcoins need infrastructure for developers. Song does not understand this.

I guess Bitcoin and related industries should just stay as-is. That's the argument he seemed to be making.
I'm a simple man.  I just hodl.
This is FUD, show proof.
Which, if it crashes the price a bit, would be a good thing for investors, or people wanting to get more. The lower the price the more likely I am to grabbin coinz, like L4D Louis and pills. 
That's less than 10% of daily volume

Do you mean an address? Yes you can use all of them.
Ctrl
F4
as long as anyone under 18 can buy coins, there will be moon boys. gotta take advantage of those that haven't felt the pain of losing real $.
I thought I read somewhere that address didn't belong to Mt Gox.
The price rising is not "progress". The price rising is "profit". 
GTFO No Coiner
Now you can fuck yourself, you crippled pathetic demon!
There’s a real good chance that it will settle in at 7.8k
What price did you get in at?
I used to get so nervous about this stuff. Now it’s just entertainment.  It goes up, really high. Then it comes down. Then it goes up higher. Lol it’s not hard.  It’s just the frontier of the whole fucking money world.  Might as well hang out 
I'll buy your coins. 
Of course It is too much to ask, were about to blow the top off roof at 10,000 this month, and now you want out?
God, one little correction and everyone thinks it's all over and bitcoin is dead. This is nothing. The price can't just go up forever, there are always corrections.
What kind of dead cat bounces several times a day?
honestly, i'm using gut feeling and absolutely nothing substantial here, but I feel like bitcoin is gonna retrace to 6k in a few months, hope not tho
Buy too. K thanx 
really? why? lol
lol
Fu.. that’s what I hate about BTC... even when you put normal fee... it’s still can stuck for hours 
Two blocks in few minutes... without my transaction... guess 20 sat is low again?
The Gambling industry in the US is probably about to explode with today's ruling. I'm guessing many new companies will sprout up to fill the market and many of them will probably be just online companies. To me it seems like Bitcoin can easily make its way onto these sites as an option for account funds. 
https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2018/live/
That's not a lot?
Is a lot bro
Bruh trying to get there, myself. People don’t talk about how much they have but know that most people who actually own crypto hold less than 1 BTC.
it's gonna be a HUGE amount soon.
you should try to not disclose the amount of bitcoin you have. Unless your reddit account is 100&#37; anonymous.
True. :-)

But I also have (h)opium. I really want this TA to be right:

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/h8Bhc0kS-BITSTAMP-D/


I doubt that they all come together in a big hall to press the buy button in the same second...
pffffff  child
I am absolutely sure that the Mt Gox trustee does not have ANY interest in the daily discussion. Its a fact that Mt Gox is and will be liquidating. If that reflects the average cost of BTC so be it.
200k BTC is a small amount? 
$1.3 billion worth
200k. ish
So what happens to my transaction? How is it that I sent it hours ago and its just sitting around not getting confirmed when it should have been long ago with the fees on it
Yeah but it is kinda funny when the shorters get rekt as a result. 
Thanks!!
Maybe
in hindsight, it kind of makes it look like im a really shitty cybercrimes detective  
You should have asked how old she was...
Song and Lubin talking about shitcoins
Lubin shills a different shitcoin at every event...


Winning
Yes it's FUD https://www.cryptoground.com/mtgox-cold-wallet-monitor/

not a mt gox wallet. but that of a casino

Progress.
No.
Nah.
ahem
I'm curious to know as well lol
13k...
"correction"

Bitcoin has reached its ceiling.
Dead cat on a trampoline.
all of my transactions are instant on coinbase and GDAX
Yep idk, not sure what is going on this is really insane though I for sure will never expect BTC to handle my transactions in a timely manner again.
Yeah I’d rather use crypto than share my personally identifiable information to gambling sites.  

I say this will be good for bitcoin ™ 
Not sure if that will be necessarily good for Crypto, although I have no idea really.
Thanks awesome. I'll be watching it all day lol.
It isn't wrong yet!! lol
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.  Hopefully the event can push it over 10k and maybe we'll see some FOMO after.  I dunno...  I just want my lambo already.
I heard he only sold 8k recently.
if you fees had been adequate, transaction would have been included already. I like this block explorer: [https://blockchair.com](https://blockchair.com) it estimates how many transaction are to be confirmed before yours gets included.
TT_TT my wallet weeps at the sight of those numbers. 
\-icious
I read the Mt. Gox coins were being donated to my pet elephant.
 The next round of court hearings will be held on September 18, 2018. Kobayashi confirmed that additional liquidations might be coming, subject to the bankruptcy court approval

Go to hell where you should belong to, demoon!
yeah, I am happy to be wrong about my prediction.
Read the comment history. Seems like one big cluster fuck. 13k buy in on some shady site
Ok, talk to me again in december and we'll see where we are at.
Haha .. Ceiling ! ... Brilliant 
yup, everyone knows that a deflationary currency never increases in value, especially over long periods of time. 
lol
At that point the analogy makes no sense.
You get confirmations instantly? Between another coinbase account? :) If you send it out to me on my software wallet (electrum), you think it will be instant? Or if you pay for something in real life with it, let's say a coffee in Japan (I've heard many streets shops support it there) - you think it's going to be instant?

Transaction will be, but you have to wait for confirmations if you want to use these funds that you send. 
just for info: are you guys using coinbase as a source for your transactions?
Isn't this what LN is for? I have done about 400 LN transactions and moves and purchases the past few weeks, and my lowest fee was -1 satoshi and my highest fee was 2 satoshi. Always instant, and I only had to pay for 3 blockchain transactions so far. One to open, one to refill a channel, and one to refill again.
Same here. I think for many people crypto still doesn't feel like real money. Perhaps there will be some kind of psychological effect where people are much more willing to send in crypto instead of taking that hit of submitting credit card info.  
Well, there are some projects that allow bets with crypto currencies.
Same here bro.
8k today - 8k next week- 44k in September...........until they are played out.
Well, I guess coinbase decided to send my transaction with inadequate fees then :( so stupid
ouch
Yea coinbase. Will never again, final straw was this. Still unconfirmed, 4 hours or longer now 
I’m not, using electrum on my pc, good old fashion way :)
24 hour trading volume is over 780,000 Bitcoin. So about 1% of the daily market activity is going to make a big difference?
Or to the wrong address? Hopefully not.
did coinbase implement segwit yet? what are the first 3 characters of your coinbase address?
[removed]
New coins instead of same back and forth.
That would have sucked! Lol ended up confirming in like idk 5 hours or so.. crazy can't put up with that when I'm using btc for conducting business. (Legitimate business, guys)
1Nv
And what's even more interesting, how few hours ago 1 block was found in like 1 hour 20 minutes and NO ONE here said a thing besides me and 2 other people... which really shows how much in reality people use bitcoin... Some of us use it yeah, but most of the people here go on praying "I SEE 9K TODAY!" while selling and buying BTC inside some bitfinex without even using it in real life at all. That shows that real value of this thing is WAY LESS than even 8k.

Sorry for the rant, just tired of this thing messing up my plans when it's important, and working like magic when I don't give a fuck.
yup, this confirms it, they still haven't upgraded to segwit.
