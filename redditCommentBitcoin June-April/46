Daily Discussion, April 19, 2018 -- TITLE
Fuck it...I'ma go drop acid instead of worrying about Bitcoin today.
Gratitude for Bitcoin, 
It is beginning to feel la bit like late last summer again. After the UASF won a 2 year+ very heated debate and Bitcoin finally got a malleability fix implemented. 
IMO that changed everything and demonstrated a whole new level of anti-fragility, within Bitcoin.

Just thank you to everyone in the community. Changed a lot of lives already.
Hey Merica... there oil at 20k
Surprising that this time altcoins are pumping without bitcoin increasing proportionately or significantly.

Any thoughts on that? 

BTC dominance slightly reducing as well...
I üëè can üëè feel üëè it üëè coming üëè in üëè the üëè air üëè tonight

Oh HODL üëè
We've been fooled so often in the past weeks by slowly rising prices. I just can't bring myself to fully trust it... yet...
**Come On America, wake up!**
**The Road Is Open For The Bulls.....**
seatbelts motherfuckers
go bitcone
Feeling more optimistic than I was a week ago for sure. Still feeling slightly cautious as I feel we need Bitcoin to pump into the 5 digits and find support there for the general public to be brought back in. Still have some skeptic friends who believe this is a dead cat bounce and that the general public is going to have been too traumatized by the post-$20k crash to be lured back in, but I think many of them are still ripe for some good old-fashioned Satoshi Christ evangelism.
Stop analyzing every single day.  Watch this plant grow 
On the 6th April I posted this when BTC was 6700  https://ibb.co/cW6Qp7

I'm now back to claim my gratitude and thanks from you all.  You're welcome 

We did ask for steady growth 
who the hell is pumping BCash.  I got some for free at the fork but since then I've never met a REAL person who actually wants to buy it
All dips are being bought up. Bears are losing. 9k coming fast. 
I invested another 750 dollars last week by going into my savings figuring that I can replace that savings with my upcoming check which is tomorrow, would it be crazy to invest another 750, with the thought process that I can replace that with the check after that?
Looks like a lot of orders just auto filled at ~8290-8300

Big buy orders popping. here we go! and tmrw is fridayyyyy yay
its happening boys!!
We did it!  Congratulations guys and gals!

As a Bitcoin expert, I can say with absolute certainty that the price shall go up, or down, or possibly stay the same.
It feels like it wants to big green boner
really nice buy down at 8,170 on GDAX I saw a nice block of 21 BTC get bought which immediately stopped the down move and we ripped higher off of that

8170 is the line in the sand for now guys
**$8,300: Bitcoin Seeks Direction at Key Price Hurdle**

https://www.coindesk.com/make-or-break-bitcoin-nears-key-resistance-hurdle-at-8300/

Bitcoin (BTC) remains in bullish territory today, but a major break above the long-term descending trendline has been elusive.

That failure on the part of the bulls means the cryptocurrency needs a major move above $8,300 soon to lessen the risks of another sell-off. The trendline resistance is around $8,285 currently.

However, soon before press time, BTC was closing in on that target level and changing hands at $8,226 on Bitfinex (up 1.4 percent on a 24-hour basis). So, the next few hours are likely to determine the pattern going forward.

View

A high-volume break above $8,300 would confirm a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change and open the doors for a move toward $8,800 (10-week MA).

Repeated rejection at the key trendline hurdle would boost the odds of a deeper pullback to $7,510-$7,200.
It really hurts missing out on the rise like this. Unfortunately I had to sell all my crypto to pay my taxes sadly.
Crypto AD ban could a blessing in disguise - more organic growth
8300 BABY
relax,  pump ain't done yet üòé
Good morning Europe!
Lets have a really positive end to April and then kick on over the next few months.

Bitcoin is like a mother to us all, fight for her! 
Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for liftoff.
Next stop, 8700 hopefully by Friday night. Keep it going.  BUY BUY BUY!  ALL IN!
God I'd be nervous if I shorted because of the tax day fud.
Will it cross? Where's betting guy??
**Come On Bulls**
Now, what?
Hope some of them altcoins gainz flows into btc next hours/days
:D dat greeny dat greeny :D
I believe this is the start of a long bull run, and I want to margin trade on the long position to make more money. Poloniex has been "verifying" me for weeks and so has Kraken. I doubt they'll ever get their shit together. 
       I live in USA. Do I have any options or do I have to miss out? 
Looks like this is going to be a battle.

Green dildos should be coming soon.

People are slowly and surely coming back to BTC and cryptocurrency in general. Good $ign
HODL!!!

Ridiculous Bcash shitcoin pump over.

Now maybe some genuine investments will move into BTC.
HODL!!!
Now that we have crossed... do we stop at 11,800 again...lower then that? or do we hit the stride and take off.
Your TA's have no power here, this it bitcoin
hey Sub, I decided 2 share my btc story with u, a subreddit I never registered, only observed until now.  

about 2yrs ago I've read about btc and it was love at first sight. Put all my savings (wasn't much - I'm still yung) in it  ‚Äì because I believe in it. 

Now consider this a more philosphical point of view ‚Äì btc helps me live in a country with very high living costs and get the best education I could dream about, even made some profit for my mom. You see it's not about cashing out, I see it more as a reserve, which could grow with all of us and in times of need you can reach out for it. No one needs luxury items, its about being financially independent/ flexible and helping others. <3 have a nice day and keep hodling <3
So what's all this "massive botnet pump and dump" everyone's been going on all about?
This sideways movement around high 7000 low 8000 is a classic example of what traders call consolidation in which market movers accumulate more coin before it spikes higher.  It is a BULLISH sign!
The short term moving average is above the long term moving average on every timescale chart on GDAX right now.  Not bad bitcoin, not bad.
we all wait.....
next wales dildo....
to quote Mr Sulu "THE NEW SCREENS HELD"
I'm gonna point my miner at solo.ckpool for a bit. 

WISH ME LUCK!
curious if theres anybody here that sells coins via LocalBitcoins?  I'm considering signing up as a way to make extra cash and promote the industry in my area.

Less than an hour to go.  Let's see if we can breach 8300 tonight.  This is our chance!
I'm trading totally unafraid (not recklessly, mind you) because I know that no matter how low the BTC drops that [it will come back up](https://youtu.be/QPkR6FGY6zw), and even surpass the current level.
Can bitcoin's dominance percent affect its price?
Buy order for $18 mil on Bitfinex @ 8250 appearing and disappearing. I think we can safely presume the long side manipulation has started. 
BTC Shorts have been increasing in last 3 days even though price has been gradually increasing.

Interesting.
tense moment. Will we make it past the 8380 from before the dip?
Are you guys ready for a big pump? Personally expect that when 8500 is broken near 10.000 will be reached in a few hours/days and I‚Äôm normally really not the one making these big price predictions but this resistance area is just to important to be ignored by the big players.
today we break the walls of 8400 for good
Meh, still waddling sideways in the channel between the last high of 8915 on 3/23 and the low of 6603 about 10 days ago, sort of like a drunk who's trying to make his way to the liquor store for another bottle of Cold Duck. Anybody who claims to know the direction this thing is going to go in the next 30 days (other than maybe still sideways) is nothing more or less than a *liar*.
Today will go down in history as the Battle at Log Downtrend.
Hey can someone help me with different wallets ? which is best... and whats the fee differences ?
https://news.bitcoin.com/yes-you-can-buy-your-world-cup-ticket-with-bitcoin/
Is that true?
Hi guys,

First ever reddit post but I've been watching this sub for a few month now.

Question: Does anyone here think that we will see downward movement in price if 50 day SMA is not met today?
I'm guessing but I think the next hour will see us past $8300
How do you guys keep up with the charts?
 Can't even sleep well anymore, if I stick to holding is it possible to make gains too ? 
This is it.. We are adopted.. Amazon wants us.. Pornhub.... Wow.
Hallo an alle,
habe heute einen interessanten Artikel zum BTC gefunden. Der Chart zeigt seit einigen Tagen Auff√§lligkeiten, die an Notenbankinterventionen zur Stabilisierung von FX Paaren erinnern. Es wurde best√§tigt, dass Miner einen Kurs von √ºber 8600$ ben√∂tigen um mit Gewinn Coins sch√ºrfen zu k√∂nnen. Ist eine ziemlich gef√§hrliche Entwicklung wenn Ihr mich fragt. Was denkt Ihr dazu?
_______________
Today it was confirmed that the break-even point for miners is at 8600$. I found an article that shows a pump and dump on the btc over the last days. That is extremly dangerous for the BTC if it turns out to be true...

Is Bitcoin correcting?  I see red candles.  Let's take a vote.
[deleted]
Is it Bitcoin Season or Altcoin Season, or is this a Bull Trap? Any thoughts?
And we're back down again
SELL!!!
I need to have a better understanding as to how in the long term Bitcoin will stay valuable.  If its supply is finite then  i imagine it will have a cap on its price which would happen once the last coin is mined?   I can't think of another example of something on earth that is valuable and definitively Finite (sorry could be a stupid question and haven't had coffee yet).   They always seem to find more Gold and Oil so that's more unknown/guess work.
Bull market will not start until May/Jun
Hey fellas beginning a livestream of BTC price analysis and trading, open discussion format for anyone interested.

What do you guys think about this? Future of Crypto payments in retail markets.

What are the implications of gifting Bitcoin? Who pays tax afterwards?

They say that day trading is a skill, so practicing should make you good at it right? How long someone should spend to go from newbie to advanced ? 
If I want to convert my investments to fiat money, I heard that I can use Gdax or Coinbase. Which one would you guys recommend, and why ? 
Once we breach the 8391,23 barrier we might be heading for 8461,78.


Anyone know why bcash is on the rise?
[deleted]
(ELEC) and (OMG) going to break out soon. 
Its time to admit that Lightning Network is dead end. Even shitcoin like Verge can be accepted as payment without Lighning Network. How is this possible? 
Based on the DATA

What will happen Friday Morning, Friday Night, and Sunday night? It seems it crashes Friday morning, and Friday after 6pm it goes up up up, then sinks a little on sat, and is good Sunday night again.

Is this consistently what happens? Can anyone screen shot every weekend and see?
What is bitcoin you can't buy anything with it as the fees are too high
Can't. Break. 8.4k. üôÇ
Have a nice trip!
Well, it *is* bicycle day.
GREAT IDEA.
Do you really want us to bomb 20k?
I think alt season is back again. If bitcoin starts crashing than BTC dominance will go back up again.
Just some groups pumping around. It might be because they can't dump Bitcoin anymore. So they're pumping and dumping alts in relation to Bitcoin.
It‚Äôs another sign confidence is back in the market; however, as soon as BTC goes on a huge bump, money will drain from alts and dump back into BTC due to FOMO. Same thing happened last year. 
haha me too.  Waiting for that long red dildo but praying for the greens.
I rarely comment on short term price but I want to agree the bullish indicators are getting stronger.
We have been consolidating in the low 8K range.. .while very  gently trending upwards since that big pop up on April 12th.
Even if we just stay at these levels and gain 1% per week, as time passes the price low set on Feb 6th becomes more ingrained as a belief that the price did indeed bottom on Feb 6th. And market psychology shifts, as it is already.  We will see more TA charts showing ascending channels using the Feb 6th bottom as a start point and the law permanence sets in.
 
It sure is! Come on, bulls, come right into the pen. Never mind that guy over there with the meat cleaver, he's just sharpening it because he's bored. I *promise* you that if you come into the pen, Bitcoin will moon! 19000 here we come!
Hah I see you were on Krown's yesterday...
They will think its a dead cat until ath, and then they will think its a bubble. 
Grow and crash*
I upvoted you on that day. I was with you then and I'm with you now. 
That‚Äôs awesome üòé
Steady growth is the best way up. Definitely 
It was and has always been Jihan and Ver. lol if anybody actually thinks there's a real demand to own Bcash. 
Bcash volume has been super low like $300M, even lower than lesser coins. Although it recently spiked up, don‚Äôt be fooled, it doesn‚Äôt have much of a community base. 
Invest what you can afford to lose, but I feel like in 5 years we‚Äôre gonna wish we invested everything 
I had the same thought process and decided to go ahead with it because these low prices won't always be there. as long as you know you can replace it, I don't see the harm in doing so, and you will make more money in the long run as opposed to waiting and the price possibly getting higher. up to you though chief
Just shorted at 8350. Not time yet. Probably rebound to 4500 before we go up again
Teach me sensei ;P
1d chart should be enough indication.
rebuild week by week, month by month ... you still got loads of time!
Hey, that's what it's there for. You can't hold forever...you got to use it for purpose sometime.
One minute of silence for him and all the rest of the guys that missed this rise (sigh)

Binance, bruh.
So you want to go on margin because you "believe". Honestly, you should think it over. For example, at what level do you put your stop loss? Or don't you? Are you at least able to calculate where would be your liquidation price?

By the way: if you use BTC as a collateral to trade BTC on margin, shit can hit the fan really quickly as your margin level goes down in some kind of feedback loop when BTC takes one of it's crashes.

What is crossing?
And which way will it go?
1.5137
Depends on the exchange and what the order book looks like, surely.
It varies is the simple answer depending on market depth.  It could go up $100 if 10 Bitcoins are bought and then it could only go up $5 if 10 Bitcoins are bought.

Watch the market on GDAX and you will get a better idea.

Amazon can't use bitcoin because its too slow, at least until lightning gets more developed. My bet is Amazon will make its own altcoin.

This is incredibly inaccurate. The same shit was happening from 10.8k to 11.2k and it crashed by 40%.

I stopped selling on LBC once they implemented KYC on vendors.

paxful.com is basically the same type of p2p exchange but US based and with better support and interface
If I want to sell for sterling I sell exclusively on Local Bitcoins via bank transfer.
 I've always been happy and never been ripped off. Although some people have been.
 It's sometimes a bit annoying when someone accepts a trade and then waits to see what the market does before they complete. But other than that it seems OK to me.

what
Momentum seems to be accelerating.  I‚Äôd like to see it over 9000 tomorrow.
That will change one day. It's sometimes easier to make wealth than it is to hang onto it.  Just keep putting some aside in a trust or something so when that day comes and you don't recognise it you'll still have money at the end of the day. 
Oh really?

Tell that to the people who bought at 20k, 18k, 16k, ......
But what happens well you sell Bitcoin for a nice gain and it just doesn't come back down.... That was the normal for the last 4-6 months of 2017.....
Im not much of a trader but do traders buy back in again at a higher price in a bull market?

PS I agree 100% that the price of Bitcoin will come back up, regardless of how far it drops. For 9.5 years with 100% accuracy BTC has always broke above the previous all time high price and gone way above it, over and over for nearly a decade. This recent time will be no different, in fact the run up might be even greater than the last run, because thats been a pattern too..... That give us 150k Bitcoin easy, because we ran over 2000% on the past bull run. Assume $6500 was bottom we get $130k bitcoin so I'd say we see $150k for a week but maybe touch $175k for an hour or so like the way we touched 20k for 15 minutes but 18k was the price for about a week. 
Of course. Think about the Saudi princes who were arrested for "corruption" last year. What if even one of those guys decided to stash their wealth in Crypto's. The alts can't even absorb one of them. It has to be Bitcoin because it has the highest market cap. So a dominant position can lead to price increases. 
But i think the market is still bear 
We're going through. Question is how big is it going to be ? I've been expecting another $1000 jump for days now. It's on the cards. 
Well that happened sooner then expected. Now well see. 
What makes you think that ?
Yes, more than likely another pump at the latest support but we'll see if it can sustain for the next couple hours to really know.
a lot of wallets allow you to set the fee. Some exchanges cover the fee. I'm not currently sure what a minimum fee should be to see it confirmed promptly. I can check what i've paid historically.
Charts mean nothing
There‚Äôs a good chance we could breech 8300 in 4 hours or so. 
It's been a 2 day battle, would be surprised if it ends before EOD tomorrow.
Start using Stop Orders. That way if it dips when you sleep, the server will sell for you and you get sweet sweet gainzzz. Then hopefully it hasn't gone back up when you wake up and you can set a buy order to make sure you don't buy back in too early.
If you hold, it's worthless. 
Pornhub wants Verge. Amazon is making a patent to de-anonymize bitcoin to sell the information to law enforcement. No "us" is being adopted.
Nothing dangerous about it. If mining becomes unprofitable, and miners drop out of business, the difficulty will decrease. And mining becomes profitable again for the remaining miners.
Break even depends on country and in some places it's less than $1k.

yes
I think we might break the 8400 barrier and head up to 8700
Duck shooting here.

And we are going back up.  Buckle up WOOOO HOOOOO!
Happens every morning in Europe
Not so fast, we might see a break above resistance soon.
Uh dude, you've got it horribly backwards. The whole reason people even bet on Bitcoin in the first place is it's finite supply. 

Most currencies get their value buy how much is in circulation and demand. Bitcoin is no different. As time goes on, more and more coins will be lost from irresponsible wallet holders and thus the value should rise.

They estimate there are already 4million lost coins out of the total 17 million mined. -it hasn't even been ten years!

Tldr; fuck you.
> If its supply is finite then i imagine it will have a cap on its price

is this where you're going wrong - why on earth does the first thing lead to the other?!?!
So because theres only 1 Mona Lisa, the price is capped?
Your question requires a long, complex answer. This is one of the better written pieces I've found: https://medium.com/@vijayboyapati/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1

Your point is rather strange as resource scarcity is indeed a strong driver of price. If you stay very general the more finite it is the more valuable because a growth in demand cannot be met by supply growth. Which means price increase. Hope I was clear. 
there is techincally a finite supply but can never be fully mined. The difficulty increases exponentially
why?
[deleted]
fuck yea tax me daddy
You and the person receiving the gift play rock, paper, scissors and the loser pays the tax. You're welcome.
like any asset

you can gift $14,000 to whomever tax free every year

you pay tax on gifts over $14,000 in any one year

when you 'gift',  the asset value transfers at the value on the date of the gift.

the gift receiver would only pay tax on any appreciation AFTER he is gifted and sells asset.

If you give someone $1000 worth of bitcoin,  then 10 years later they sell the bitcoin for $10,000,  THEY would owe long term capital gains tax on $9,000.
In the U.S. system, gift taxes are paid by the person making the gift. However, there are annual exclusions and a big lifetime exclusion, see http://www.willkie.com/~/media/Files/Publications/2017/12/2018_Estate_Gift_and_GST_Tax_Exemption_Increases.pdf  *Caution however* that many states also charge gift taxes, and their exclusions are generally not so generous as Uncle Sam's.

Outside of the U.S., gift taxes are usually paid by the recipient, but this varies from country-to-country, and some don't even have gift taxes.
"tax" LOL

There's no skill in trading. The more you think you actually have skills, the more delusional you become, and the more likely you'll shoot yourself in the foot. It's mostly luck, and a little bit more luck. 
You need luck, not skill.

The price of BTC is so heavily manipulated that TA makes zero sense.  And anyone telling you otherwise or giving advice that price will go up or down is full of shit.

Sure you can day trade and any trade has a 50/50 chance of being profitable at any given time.
Well i did it for two years full time, and lost about... ehh 125k, im better at it now but i trade s&p mini, not bitcoin, bitcoin is a shit thing to day trade. 
Also dont do it unless you got stacks, the best day traders lost a shit load before they got good
With day trading the big thing is the trend of the market - in a bear market , unless you are shorting, no trades will win.  However , in a strong up ward bull market, it is actually hard to lose, once you get the hang of it.  The basic technique I use in an upward trend is to buy the pull back, ie. buy the dip.  This works because even in a bull market  it doesn't go straight up - it will always pull back before the next spike.  So if it is a sustained bull market, like we might be entering now, it is pretty hard to lose.  On the other hand in a bear market like we have come out of it is hard to win.  That's why traders say - 'the trend is your friend"  
Decades. You'll never stop learning. 
At least a short enough period of time so that by when you have gained at least slightly-greater-than average experience and skills, you still have some significant money to trade with.
It‚Äôs the same company, but if you sell it on GDAX you will have to pay about a quarter of the fees for the actual sale if you do limit sales instead of just being able to sell for market on Coinbase 
what if i told you .... Gdax is Coinbase
I'm assuming USD fiat, you can also use Gemini and Kraken. Of the 3 i prefer Gemini for fiat deposit/withdrawal.
Its the same company .... so it wont matter ... you will get the exact same shit execution from both ...
I like the precision in your predictions. 
I‚Äôm going to take the conservative approach I figure through some insanely complex T/A that I never bother to explain that we are heading to 8461.77.üßê
Same reason as Bitcoin Gold is rising - 'tis shitcoin week.

So it's gonna breeze right through 3,4,5,6,7...right
What about (WTF) and (MATE)?
[deleted]
What?
Because no one is using Verge.... 
Way too early to claim LN is dead. I'm giving it two more years before I get remotely concerned.
My god shut up
I gave up on paterns. Everytime you think you see one the opposite happens. 
It's more consistent than TA that's for sure
Ermagawd I had to spend 3 cents to move 5k the other day. The fees are brutal amirite?
lol
oh your back, what happen to 4k? Nocoiner life still hatin eh?
Exactly.
we dont bomb the oil itself. just the people protecting it. we take over and conquer it
LOL! That‚Äôs so true. 
So are you saying that when bitcoin drops out crashes, is dominance increases?
It is not pump and Dump of a selected few mate. Most of them are up and showing positive growth like a start of the bull run. It is unusual in my short experience because I have always seen them linked to BTC closely
One of them in particular who said this to me the other day has been in the finance industry for years and has made a killing off stocks. Guy's probably retiring at 50-55 latest at the rate things are going. He's also the same one who advised me to sell off my Bitcoin right as it was at $17.5k. Saved me a major heartbreak there for sure. Really intelligent guy. And I do agree there is *some* merit to his thought process.  

Back in Oct/Nov and after, we were coming off the China FUD and noticing many among the general public setting up new Coinbase accounts at record setting rates and buying up cryptos. Right now, it's more or less clear that many of those FOMO kiddies who pumped it to $20k aren't coming back. At least not for a while. For cryptos to go parabolic again, we need more new money and not just the institutional investor money pumps we're witnessing.  

So I'm a cautious optimist myself for now. Enjoying the pumps, but hopeful we can get the general public excited for cryptos again.
Well in that case you just have to feed it 
It's just a seasonal cycle, come spring this baby will bloom again. Naddadimean.
Aww shucks I feel special now
I think some newbs might buy it just because it‚Äôs on Coinbase and it has the bitcoin name.  They should take it down. There are far better altcoin choices that should take its place. 
good points thanks for response!
Dollar Cost Averaging. So you don't end up losing the $750/weekly if Bitcoin tanks (you never know, hope not). Just put $200 (or whichever your amount is) every Friday (or whatever day) FOREVVERRR (LOL), but as long as you can comfortably put more without worrying. 

So you still have your 'Savings' account along with your 'Bitcoin' account. And both will have a good amount in the long run!! :0)
It likely will go down again, but you shorted at the beginning of this upswing, which is a bit early.
You should follow the advice of your username hodltill2020. 
I did the same this morning, but tight stop loss and little leverage.
LoL!
I'm sorry spawn, but you have to have been a redditor for 4 months in order for me to teach you.
Nazi Punks Fuck Off!

For those who don't know: "88" is a code for "Heil Hitler". "H" is the 8th letter in the alphabet.
In 2018 we use reusable rockets. 
Yes, and the fed rate hike caused the entire economy to dip back in March. Which we are now recovering from. No where but up from here my friend.
In 1969 we made it to the Moon, but space shuttles still "liftoff" even though they don't go as far anymore. Down the line we will make it as far as the Moon again and even further, but in the mean time, it will take many "liftoffs" before we can make those historic achievements reality.  
Since that month has passed, 8500 has become the new moon.
You're really actively searching for all kraken related comments, don't you?

I have to admit, I like that.
The lines 
atm looks uppish but who knows
Unless we have an unexpected giant red dildo between now and then, we should see it bump up around then. 

Edit:  may even see a bump a little prior due to the anticipation. Could be why we are higher in the 8200-8300 range currently. 
I thought it was 1.337

Please explain 
I looked at a chart :)

The burrito place?
Interesting point you make - when analyzing sideways price movement the big question is "is it accumulation (ie market makers buying low to sell high) or distribution ?"(market makers selling high to take profit).  So it could go down from here - but I don't think so - it just feels more like accumulation to me - there seems more positivity in market at the moment.  But like everyone else I don't have a crystal ball!
And wails are a type of sound people and animals can make
cool thanks for reply.  realistically not sure how much time i have to do it 
thanks for reply.  Seems relatively easy to get setup to sell coins.  I wonder though if there is enough demand for the service in my area to be worth my time.  I think when most ppl make the decision to buy its much easier just to sign up for an Exchange
what?
20% swing in total volume over the past 24 hours... we're in for a fuckin gooooooooooood night
He just did...
Yes. I keep trading even if the price is high relative to the past. The market stays within a price range for a time. I'm also holding some and letting that ride out.
I'm glad binance notice this already before bitcoin could be dominated by alt
Agree.

My point is that all the shorts got rekked only last week and for it to start growing so soon ... hmmm.
That would be great. As long as the next wave stays above the temporary bottom at 8200 I think we're set.
We are in for a weekend ride. Stay seated firmly. We are going to 9K. 
to be completely honest, naive optimism. However we did test 8400 last week and have been quite consistent in being above 8000 since.  
Higher probability indeed... I think we could see up to 9200 before next MAJOR retracement. Overall, I will always be long on BTC but I still think the market needs a confirmed bottom before real robust growth. We might have found it at 6-6500, but TA says we have higher probability to retest these ranges - down to about $4800. I might have missed the boat but my 5400-5800 orders are still in.... ( I exited around the 10200 range and continue being patient. )
You could be right.
> Then hopefully it hasn't gone back up when you wake up

Just hold. 
You are the guy who was sayng BTC was going to 4k. Maybe your bags aren't being adopted but we, the premiums are.

Just out of curiosity how does everyone feel on who is the bear and bull of the world? As someone living in the US it seems to me like the price always drops overnight (except for very recently beginning with the morning pump from the gods). So that would mean Europe and Asia are selling. Can anyone else confirm this? I'm probably just looking for patterns where there aren't any.
europeans arent even awake.
Damn cucks!
yes good points
i agree to stop thinking today LOL
It‚Äôs capped at ‚Äúpriceless.‚Äù
good point
thanks for sending will read later today
thanks for response very clear.  Its just weird to wrap my head around the concept that there will only be so many Bitcoin.  I can't think of another resource that is definitively finite.
oh yea forgot about the difficulty.  it always amazes me how well designed Bitcoin is
So what is happening?
Yes, is a very small range, who can deny. This is a 1% profit, my fee is 0,48% (buy and sell) . I did two times today 
  
     8090-8220 // 8130 - 8265. 

That means around 1,10% net profit. Penauts but feed at the end. 
Your testosterone level will level off after puberty. It's ok to be angry, we all through it when we are kids. They are better ways to express yourself though. Not many people respond well to name calling, you may learn that as you grow up. Cheers!
I mean, if you don't like the government services that "tax" provides, I guess that's funny. 
Worth a shot? Isnt it?
For someone daytrading a 50% success rate is actually great it all relies on minimizing losses and letting your winners run
Good to know that ! Thanks 
Ignore this troll it definitely matters. Gdax you can use limit orders and pay $0 fee. You can also withdraw crypto to any address from gdax for free(They pay all tx fees). They are the same company so you can link your accounts and transfer free/instant between the two.
No tits and or asses involved.
Some people. It's very obviously 8461.76
*snicker*
Heh - like Bitcoin Gold, which is outperforming Bcash over 24 hours and neck and neck over 7 days.

Massive adoption for BTG too, eh?

It truly is the battle of the shitcoins.

..and everyone knows you're over here to shill Bcash.

edit: clarity.
He never said breeze, just that the next major resistance is at $8,800, you still need buyers to get up to that point. 
brb afk lol

Yea. It does seem, that week-to-week payees like me, seem to buy in with their paychecks once they get home from work, from 6pm-9pm. Also, it seems to consistently dip Monday mornings from about 6am until 11am.
I've literally never said it would go to 4k. I'm not one of those.
In hindsight it was easy to see that the price at 17.5k was a bubble, and honestly i dont want crypto to go parabolic like that, its unsustainable. Slow and steady is cool üòé

But what i mean is, the skeptics of bitcoin will stay skeptics, dont trifle with them, and listen to your friend from finance when he says dont put it all on bitcoin. 
It's good advice.

Speculating in BTC is fun but remember that it's just a number on the network you are buying, nothing more.  So play with spare cash that you can afford to lose.
...it IS spring.
Exactly, like bytecoin! Of all the altcoins I have ever seen, that one is simply the most totally-not-a-scam coin out there. 

Unless they come out with bytecoin cash! *Gasp*
Lol at your lol. He could buy back in for a slight profit now.

Lol, you condescending fuck.
Lol...but..but I was not born 4 months ago. 
they used reuseable rockets on the space shuttle bruh
We have a team that helps get people the support they need wherever you may be.  Thanks for the compliment.
Which lines? There are so many of them...
No it was 9001
Yeah, it's just the math
Ok :)


No, Lynyrd Skynyrd 
Thanks I can always rely on r/Bitcoin for fabulous answers. And look, someone downvoted me for asking a fucking question! I love you guys.
Indeed. Perhaps Andrix was thinking about leeks - one of the symbols of Wales?
Maybe if you are in the US. 
It's only decent value for me as exchanges seem to deal in Euros and Dollars and I avoid the exchange rate.
But it  might be worth a try some people might not want to sign up to an exchange.


buy?
I don't really understand how a single broker could have any influence  over who dominates what, 
I think that short rekt event was a bit exaggerated. A lot of shorts are coming down from >10k. Those just hit stops inside the profit range. Those are naturally looking for ways to resume their positions.

Always
It usually hasn‚Äôt. You often buy back much lower than you sold. In December did you sell? No? That‚Äôs a lot of gains missed out on that would mean more BTC later. This isn‚Äôt rocket science.
His points on Amazon and Pornhub are accurate.

Can you guys focus on the points instead of attacking the poster when you don't like the news?
He is, just click his name look at the comments. hes a FUD goldmine.  but you know what isnt gold? his bitcoin portfolio hahahaha

Jfc. I've never said bitcoin was going to 4k.
From what I have witnessed Asia and America go against each other while Europe watches like the man in the middle and takes profits from both of you. 
some are!
We like to take profits made over night lol
> I can't think of another resource that is definitively finite.

Sorry, what? 
Keep that up for a month, its a 37% profit; keep it up for a year and its its a 37 times profit :)
You're an idiot.
Fair point.
Sec while i find our previous convos

It's easy to said when you had deleted that comment...
It's a metaphor.
I was born yesterday!
The short term moving average line is about to cross the long term moving average line (upwards) on the gdax one day chart. The lines are currently touching.  This usually indicates a large bump is coming.   Should happen in about 3.5 hours (or at least it should start happening). 
[deleted]
Hey, I'm not sure.  But it can't go on forever.

FFS, I swept up my free BTG a while back - a few hundred dollars worth - and it is doing as well as Bcash.

(32% in 1 week !!!)

There is some real shitcoining going on :)
thanks for reply
buy
You must be loaded if you know what the markets going to do while you sleep. 
Watch out, you'll get b&
> his bitcoin portfolio hahahaha

Price is still lower than 1 month ago where you digged up all those comments. So, theoretically, if he buys back now, he'd still do it at profit.
I've never said it'll go to 4k and you still can't find proof. What you're providing is only proving me right. I'll keep waiting though.
Liar, liar, pants on Fire.
But they're not in the office, yet.
Lol
gotta call it right every time ;)
Not really, im just a guy that pays a ton in taxes. But I make enough to not worry about it, it's a small percentage, after my cpa gets done with it. Gotta pay to play. I love things like, roads, public parks, police, fire departments, public health. I could go on. You may not feel the same, but that doesn't make me an idiot. Tax evasion is an idiot move, it got Al Capone.
Go right ahead.
Oh.
Don't interpret too much into the lines on GDAX. They are chosen quite randomly.
Exactly how high are you rn?
There is so much spoofing of the bid stack that you cannot determine this .... its simply too fluid and unpredictable
Yep it is odd, I still can't really see why anyone would buy BCash, it got up to over $4k at one point, truly unbelievable!
If you smartly set a stop order to sell, it will always go passed where you set it on a dip. I'm not talking about little dips. I'm talking about a pretty decent dip of more than $300. After a larger dip it usually moves sideways for hours before recovering or dipping further. Look in the history of this and you will see I am right. Even if I was wrong one time, you will have made so much from it, it won't hurt you to be wrong that one time. 

Edit:

Just for fun I predict we will have a Bart form here on the 5 mins chart. I think this run up is done for now, but if I'm wrong, big deal. That means we will just go up. 
You don't have to know what it'll do you just set a stop limit in case it drops..you can also set sell orders to take profits before the next resistance line.
Look through my comments and point out where I've said it will go to 4k. I'll wait. The other guy couldn't do it. üòÇ
Don't worry guys, we got it ( haven't arrived to the office yet) get your spacesuits on!
Tell me about it :(

LOWER. BITCOIN IS DEAD.
?   Seems to be a pretty good indicator of direction on the 5 min, 15 min, 1 hour and 6 hour charts.   I would think the 1 day chart would be the best indicator of them all. 
[deleted]
Ha ha.  :)
I'd give that a 6
Yep.  But that was when it was suddenly released on Conbase under circumstances that are still being investigated.
Or it does Bart. You sell. It runs to 9k in the 6 other hours you sleep while you're tethered. Smart.
Imagine if you set a stop order, the price dips, then it runs like December. You're all basing this on luck when you could just hold long term and reduce stress.
Nocoiners... I feel sympathy. You hold nothing, You are on the sidelines watching the bullrun. You missed the bottom and are now lashing out at those with superior investing iq.
It's been ten hours...they've all gone broke.
Need more, theres TONSSSS
That's not how the market works. Watch an exchange as recommended to get a better pictures. People put in buy or sell order at a price. If they move then that's the current price. If people started putting in sell orders at 8k but no ones buying them then the price goes down. If someone suddenly drops X bitcoin and it scares the people buying they are going to buy lower. Sellers see the price going down. They panic. Sell lower and the price moves lower.... Hope that made sense... 
Yep, that was very shady indeed.
Using that same logic you could also say it could go to $4000 or even $0. I've yet to see that happen. I'm in Japan so when I'm sleeping nothing usually happens while on America's watch after 11pm my time. It's now 10:39am here now and we had a small pump. 

TL; DR:

Your fear of stop orders is that it could dip hard and then pump hard making you miss out while you are sleeping. This has never happened in such a short time frame, but silly fears are just that.
Yeah that sucks when it happens but if you had good reason to set the stop then it's whatever. You should never trade with 100% of your portfolio in a single position. Most trades I do are 1-5% Of my total crypto. If making trades is stressful you are way in over your head. 
Prove. Me. Wrong. I'm. Waiting. 

Also, I have about .25 bitcoin.

Not a no-coiner.
get a life dude lol 
You're proving me completely right. I've never said it will go to 4k. Take a fucking seat already.
No, it's too complicated. 

1.5137 is much simpler.
It depends where you set your stop orders, they're usually high to increase your gains so it wouldn't have to "dip hard". Mostly I was just implying that it's all luck in this space. December was very fast.
Been holding since October, still better off than most people hereü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I'll see you in 2020.
you did, it was deleted on the 16th, smooth
That's great for you dude! Most people here aren't using their bitcoin to short on bitmex though lol there is definitely bitcoin to be made in bear markets as in bull markets 
Future you says thanks.
This is borderline stalking lmao. 
'Cause on my end I don't see any comments I deleted on the 16th. Again, I'll wait.
And where's your proof?
Or CFDs with Dai;)
Man, if you have a weak heart. This game is not for you...
I don't. I like fucking with people though. It's apparent everyone else has a weak heart. :/
OK, just don't do it often in real life. You'll gonna get killed...
