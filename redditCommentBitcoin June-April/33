**Up 33%: Bitcoin's Price Just Had Its Best Month of 2018**

https://www.coindesk.com/33-bitcoins-price-just-best-month-2018/

Bitcoin's price rose 33 percent against the U.S. dollar in April, making it the best month of 2018 for the world's largest cryptocurrency.

Data from CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) shows that May began with bitcoin's price at the $9,244.32 mark - a 33 percent jump from its April 1 start of $6,926.02. This marks the greatest rise in bitcoin's price this year, and one of only two months where it rose at all within the period.

**Let us all make May an even better month!**
Come on guys ! Let's rerererererererereretest 9k
Looks like operation HODL the McAfee Dick Line has been a success 👍
~~It's over 9000...~~

It's over 9000...
Fucking tuesdays eh 
Bit of resistance to 9k today. Cheeky.
Back to ramming 9k wall again
I need 0.25 more BTC before it takes off again, but I've run out of stuff to sell! Payday just doesn't come fast enough.
Who’s ready for a good ‘ole Tuesday afternoon rally!?
Let’s kick it into warp and get over 10k by the weekend 
Interested in holding some long term bitcoin, it''ll be tricky finding a good price between now and July. 
the resistance is strong, but it's futile.
OVER 9000!!!!!!!
I mentioned yesterday the price was still gonna retreat. There's forces on both sides controlling the price. It's not a one way street. We are still following the bear line trend. But we are coming up at a junction where the long term up trend is crossing the bear line. That's when we can see things really turn around. Expect to see prices above 10K next week. 
**Keep fighting Bulls!**
Kanye big ups Bitcoin several times in his big interview with Charlemagne. Say what you want, its a good bump. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxwfDlhJIpw&t=1373s&app=desktop
Over 9k again! 
I do know one thing though, bulls they come they go. Saturday through Sunday Monday, Monday through Sunday yo. Maybe I love you one day, maybe we'll someday grow, till then bitcoin just get yo drunk on the fucking 10k road. 
My friend introduced me to this thing called Robinhood. Should I buy BTC from there or do it somewhere else? Thanks in advanced 
When you see big money buys like we are now, someone knows somthing, and its about to sore
BTC needs an initiative.  A purpose type cause.  Going green lol. Like that 
200 coin buy 
r/btc trolls are out in force tonight.

Dont know if its manipulation... and the bulls want down now or what
well, we did finally break out.. 
Yo guys been a long time spectator now (3 years) but have a quick question.

So i have about 9 friends who all want to invest in bitcoin, some want to buy £100 and others want a whole Bitcoin.

Now I'm going to have to set up a wallet e.g. electrum for them and and an exchange where they can sell for Cash e.g. Lunos (even though it is a wallet) 
Now obviously i would like the lowest fees possible (i have used "coinmama" in the past), they will be buying via debit card, so it would be bloody lovely if i could do the process within an hour or so rather than spending the whole day over at my mates houses.

So can you recommend me places to buy and wallets to store them in and a place where they can sell.
Many thanks Y'all
With the closure of 2018Q1 at 9000ish, what are your pessimistic and optimistic predictions for the end of 2018Q2?
#$9000!#

Never thought I'd see the day!

I need to double my bitcoins to get out of loss :/. Any helps? tips?
Omg what the heck just happened on GDAX. 101 volume for a 5 min period...
must feel bad to have shorted at 8.9k 
Good morning all.
VirWox just closed my brand new account and refunded my money.  What the shit?

Hello,

unfortunately we have received high risk indications for your account. We
have therefore refunded your payment and closed the account.

Bah, paypal, yeah? bah!
Anyone knows how many bitcoins are lost? 
Ie: lost wallets over the years ?
tough week ahead guys. well, last wednesday we were at $8600 so still everything fine i guess
What the fuck was that sell off all about? Used to be bad news driving drops like last night. 
Red across the board, still not managed to beat down 10k and been on 9ish for 2 weeks now.. 
Damn quite funny we were at $9700 already, now HEAVY fight against $9k again.

1d chart on gdax looks oversold to me
Why is a Bitcoin priced in dollars, instead of dollars being priced in Bitcoin?

If we want true adoption, this is something that should be taken care of.
Call it whatever but it is simple logic. 

Swing low to swing high, it is the time for pull back, it can hit any of the potential algos....

https://ibb.co/dr6ftn
Abandon ship lads
Woohoo!!!
This is all a bit shit isn't it?  Never mind, at least lying Shitcoin Cash is doing 3x worse over 7 days.  So some people have woken up (Or Roge and Jihan have run out of money to pump it with.)

There has to be a crypto breakout eventually - could happen anytime.
[removed]
Please stand-up
yes.
Happy cake day
I really think that the McAfee Dick Line has an psychological effect on a lot of people 
How original
....this is good for Bitcoin


*sobs*
I hear that, I've been buying $750 worth every paycheck, currently at a little more than 1.5 btc, would love to double that before we reach the moon but money isn't coming in fast enough. 
Got 100M to throw?
[removed]
buy in pieces. average your price.
Resistance to go up or down?
UNDER 9000!!!!!
i read it in a fortune cookie
Aaaaand it's gone!
Did you say [I love you](https://youtu.be/QPkR6FGY6zw)?
If you look at crypto as an investment then yes but if you think they have some future potential as a currency i don't think  you should use an app which does not let you have access to your own holdings.
There are only a handful of states where Robinhood will allow you to trade crypto. I signed up hoping to reduce the high fees I pay on Coinbase, but it’s not an option here in Georgia.

If they offer it, I would use it. But I would likely move my crypto to an offline wallet. You only get what you pay for.
If you are only into crypto to earn Fiat then yes. If you are really into crypto technology then no. Robinhood does not actually give you real Bitcoins. They hold the bitcoins and will offer you fiat back when you want to "sell".

Pros: Very simple. Just buy and hold.

Cons: You will miss out on actually owning Bitcoin. That means you cannot use it in the future. You also miss out on any free forks and airdrops that require a real Bitcoin wallet. You don't get to really experience what cryptocurrency is. They treat it as a stock.
I recommend Gemini, Kraken, or GDAX for US residents; Bittrex is also an option. Binance (lots of alt pairs) and Bitfinex (lots of volume, VPN required) are good if you have another way of depositing/withdrawing/trading fiat for instance on another exchange. And BitMEX is good for high leverage and maximum rekage (VPN required once to sign up).
Nice shill
Someone's ass will be sore from those red dildos
told ya

*soar
I thought "Moon and Lambo" is the noble cause.
„Fuck the banks“ works for me.
I just want 1 :(
just shaking off the weak hands amirite 
Why can't you all get separate wallets?
Have them all get their own coinbase account.    
My recommendations would be what i'm currently using:

- exchange: Kraken

- wallet: Samourai (Android)
Pessimistic: not below this level.

Optimistic: impossible to judge.  25k at least.  

Bitcoin is female: completely irrational and unpredictable.
This day and every other frickin day 
Yeah.  This is a unique occurence  :)

There was a meme for it, but it wore out.
And it's back bellow!
Let's hear it from the West Coast!

(Cornwall)
Good luck, and good to hear from you Mr Lennon.
Cheers from USA
best tip: don't try to gain back losses. You will take unnecessary risk and just lose more. 

The past is the past nothing changes that. 
Id like to double my btc too plz
Buy and hold. We're going to go take out $20k. 
Good, we need to get to $9 300 before the US kicks in. 
I short whenever it gets above 9200.
be patient the price will come back. 

At least you got a refund. Some brokers will simply freeze it.
Nope. It is not possible to be sure, but you can try to extrapolate and have an idea, to determine the wallets without output transactions since 2010 or 2011. But even still, it is no possible to be 100% sure.
Self fulfilling TA

Testing lower moving averages is actually a good thing in the mid-long term

That's what happens when margin funds are available only at premium interest rates.
Because you can't pay your taxes in bitcoin.
you mean just reversing how it’s displayed?
When merchants start to price their goods and services in BTC, then yes.  Otherwise, it's just silly.
Smart.
Oh, you must be on the Shorter’s Cruise.  

Yes abandon ship and come over to the HODLER’s warship. You will be happier here, I guarantee it. 
>There has to be a crypto breakout eventually

The market can remain irrational for far longer than you can remain solvent.

Yeah because we all want to be millionaires in a couple of years and if the line holds, the dream starts to look possible. 
Thanks, I try.
Shoot, well done getting to 1.5 though!  I wish I could put in that much each check, I'm still under a whole coin.  Keep that pace up though!
I wish. 
What reserves????

If you want to avoid fees entirely trade on gdax.
If he was shilling, he'd have used a referral link. 
You told us what? There is only range action 0 real movements since a week.
Get outta here small fish
i will have to as they live at different address and don't all know eachother
do you actually know any women?
I'm confident NASDAQ's participation will drive the price up considerably, but that's in 2018Q4 right?
I think vegeta retired or something.  Definitely need a new meme. 
Stop bellowing.
And back above!
Peace and love from Indian autonomous oblast (Ilford). 
Chuck us over a pastie 😀
We have to take $10k first.

Which, according to your claimed ability to read the market like an old movie, WILL happen this week.  
Price moving *gradually* is a good thing. Up down, up down.. that's fine and doesn't bother me. Crypto suddenly dropping like 5% across the four major players isn't though. 
And they'r  gone!
Heh.  That sounded technical.
Essentially, yes. 
It would be just confusing and has nothing to do with adoption. Imho it would put people off if you bring that up in normal talks. 

>"BTC went up to 9200 crazy right? No you don't understand the Dollar dropped to \(gets out the calculator  2 min later\) 0,00010869 BTC . BTC should be the real measurement  of things because 0,00010869 BTC for one Dollar sounds so great and everyone can remember it so nice! "
I am back on the Longer’s Cruise. but for a while I sailed with the Shorter’s Pirate Ship around. When I went back on the Longer’s Cruise I suddenly had 3 times as much gold.  

On the hold'ers Warship they stopped paying people for 3 month I heard and you still had to pay for  food and lodging. 
Don't assume I am not solvent mate.  

I'm tens of thousands of dollars up - whatever happens.

Stop making assumptions.
got 7 bitcoins begging for more? lol

The best scenario is if BTC gets to $950k-ish... we practically achieve the same result and McAfee still needs to eat his dick.
Aaaand there it is again! 
He is shilling the site 
Not really.  It sort of dropped 4.96%.
Ok :(
sounds like he knows most of them
Apart from my Mom and my sister - no.  But I still have my opinions.
I do not think so.

The only thing you will see is tons of negative publicity when NASDAQ starts complaining about price manipulations on the other exchanges.  Which we all know is happening but is silent when it suits our needs.
Network effect - it will grow in value.  The only doubt is the timescale.
Swing it!
Heh.  Unfortunately he deleted his post.

You must know Gants Hill roundabout - is it still a tourist attraction :)
:)
$10k doesn't really matter, you're seeing the battle for $10k right now. When we break out here, which will happen before 5th of May, we're going straight to $12k. I can smell this breakout. Alt's are already on the move. Everything is green.

I'll even give you dates, $12k about 15th \-20th of May.

$12k I suspect is going to be a problem. Going to take a few tries to get through there. 2 weeks maybe.

After $12k the whole world is on notice we're going to $20k. There's nothing between $12k an $20k. That will happen very fast.
2 or 3%..get real
Nope 
Well played 😆
>Don't assume I am not solvent mate.

I'm not. Reread what I wrote, it's not a long sentence.
Dude, I am generally a fan but you are nitpicking an aphorism...
No, it's scientific notation. It's 7.7 x 10^-5 , so .000077 BTC.
He was asking if he should do it somewhere else though, but I definitely understand the defensiveness in this climate. 
my point is that it is still range action with low volume small drops, small pushes but nothing which shows any real direction. Unless you are scalping on 15 min charts you can forget about these movements.
Brutal!
Doesn't price manipulation "exhaust" the manipulator, though? Would you care to explain to me how it works exactly and what its implications are to the near future of BTC?
[deleted]
ROFL!!!!

Doesn't matter?  You are so full of shit.

Here's what you said for the record - [Mr_P_Pui Talking Cock] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8fj22g/daily_discussion_april_28_2018/dy5ina9/)
Oops,That was supposed to be 5. It went from around 9400 to 8900 last night. Not to mention the other major cryptos took a hit too.
4h chart -> EMA50 is gone
Your unneeded warning directly to me, to remain solvent, implies a risk of insolvency.

There is none

Lighten up.
Ah, just assumed 7.704 meant thats the amount
Gants Hill roundabout is a, er, roundabout on the A12 in Ilford.  

It is certainly not a mosque.  Lying troll.

Why is everyone so combative and twatty tonight?  Are you losing money?

Tough shit.


Saying 5% or even 15% price moves aren’t fine screams overinvestment, be careful brother.
Yeah I’m not overly concerned about 4h charts, my comment was pertaining to mid-long term trends / averages 
You still aren't getting it, my guy. There doesn't have to be an anything.
Nah I get it. Knowledge is power though! Take as many math classes as you possibly can.
My investments are fine. I love how asking about weird price movements gets me nothing but attacked on this sub lol. If the "discussion" around here isn't about hodor then it gets shit on. This sub is a dumpster fire.
My opinion? Bitcoin is in a massive dead-cat-bounce. 
Heh.

You're not 10% as clever as you think you are.  You can't see possibilities beyond your realm.

You see, if the cryptomarket does well, I continue to benefit.  

If it crashes - I am still solvent, because my wealth does not depend upon it.

Which bit have you failed to understand - you presumptive, half-witted noob?

(And I mean that nicely.)
I've seen people get paid random amounts of btc in these comments before today too, are there just people sitting on big wallets that hang around to throw scraps to the heathens like us or are people throwing their precious coinbits around like it's pennies to beggars on the streets?
You want a real answer, buyers weren’t buying anymore.  We weren’t breaking any higher, so there was a sell off to the short term EMA on the 1d chart where we got support.  Now we’re cycling along at this level trying to entice more buy in.  If it doesn’t happen before EMAs cross on the 6hr chart, we’ll probably see it drop toward the long term EMA on the 1d chart.
I think so too. Not to $0.00 but something low. Perhaps even a low as high as the $6,500 price range. I think the bouncing can go on for months unless a sudden influx of adoption or something game changing happens to interrupt it. 
he’s just saying there doesn’t *have* to be a break out anytime soon, as in it’s not the rule 
Allow me to bold what you missed:

>>**There has to be a crypto breakout eventually**

>The market can remain irrational for far longer than you can remain solvent.

It's not like I was directly responding to a specific statement or anything.
I honestly don't know. Just remember that with a sub that has a volume this high, there are users who have motives that range from philanthropic, to informative, to predatory. 
Heard this at 6500 a couple weeks ago. Fudsticks need to change the record.
Yep, I believe in that also.
But you used the term 'you' - you refers to me.

What you meant then, despite your allegedly precise language, was:

>The market can remain rational for far longer than some people can remain solvent.

I would agree with that.


*ahem*
Hey all you predators out there, I'll accept your predatory donations in whichever coins you prefer to prey with. 
Lol, 6500 was the bottom of the 6hr chart. If you were listening to me, I was saying buy.  Now we’re about to see another down cycle on the 6hr chart (likely).  It may be time to sell.
> Your unneeded warning directly to me, to remain solvent, implies a risk of insolvency.

Grow up. Stop crying for attention. 

He gave you a simple answer based on his opinion. Read it and leave it. 
Good lord man, you just keep arguing it.  OP that you are responding to just parroted a very common warning about trading in any market.  Quit taking shit so personal. OP did not mean YOU in the specific term, but YOU in the plural term, speaking to traders in general.

If you (and this time I mean you specifically) have never heard this before, well man, you really havent done much studying on trading and investing.  Good luck either way though.
I don't really care what you agree with.
And at 5k, 4k, 3k and 2k. "No one wants bitcoin no mo'."

This dump is China/Ver trying desperately to maintain the peg after the whack bitmain cash got from the lawsuit today.
Words of a true Scot.
Are all you money losers on this forum tonight?

Lighten up - and STOP GIVING EXPERTS ADVICE.
There's no registered lawsuit... 

Every time bitcoin value drops, you people blame it on some shit. 



Drops and spikes have literally nothing to do with external factors most of the time.  Movement in the market is directly tied to day traders buying and selling in response to market indicators.  
The mere threat of a lawsuit forced Ver to make a raft of changes to bitcoin.com.
The lawsuit is all but guaranteed to proceed after that admission of guilt.
Uhuh, you're a daytrading chump who misses out when the price spikes 1k in minutes.
You keep doing you, champ...
Lawsuits don't work like that. Neither do admissions of guilt.
Uh, no, because I read market indicators and predict the spikes of 1000+ and buy in before they happen.  I also predict the big drops and sell a large chunk to buy back at lower prices.  You’re an ignoramus who doesn’t understand market fluctuations, and are at the mercy of people like me.
Sure thing. Completely random behaviour on Ver's part. No fear whatsoever. Clown.
Damn you reTArds are a riot!
Believe in whatever you want to believe. This supposed lawsuit is pure comedy material. 
Bitcoin users wanting the government to intervene with their regulations.
