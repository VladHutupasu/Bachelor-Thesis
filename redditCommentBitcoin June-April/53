1k pumps, my favorite antidepressants!
Holy shit. Some shorters are going to have a bad morning. 
*blows dust off vegeta meme*
All these mooners appearing out of the woodwork lol
Bogdanov, he's in
I was all depressed when I checked my phone this morning and saw bitcoin tanked another 2 hundred.  But after staring at the price and my senses slowing coming to me I was like holy crap it’s not 6700 it’s 7700. 
Pamp it
All the shorters just got rekt.
I hearby proclaim today green dildo day
This has been the most exciting 12 hours YTD.
Everyone saying that it’s pure manipulation.. of course it is. Shorts at an ATH, low volume and thin liquidity, all whales have to do is suppress the price, accumulate, fake a dump to trap bears, and pump it to liquidate the crazy amount of shorts for a short squeeze of insane proportions.

Bears got greedy, and they got burnt.
Shorters' getting rekt.
What the fuck was that!?!?
is it bull trap ??
This is the best mood I've  seen this forum in for ages.. anyone for a beer?

Or 12
I’ve been slapping myself daily (metaphorically) for buying in at 8.1 months ago.  But I held. Hold I shall ...
This dump is gonna hurt.
Im sorry its my third post in the last 5 mins but WHATTTT THEEEE ACTUALLLLLL FUUUUUUUCK?!
Hey guys, I sold my bitcoin which means it's guaranteed to keep going up. (Because I always buy and sell at the wrong time). HODL!!!!
Well, it's a first man in space day, April 12 1961))
just woke up suddenly to 7800. thought my vision was still fuzzy from just waking up. nope, it actually rose THAT high. what the fuck just happened??
To nobody in particular: You want a market without regulation, then quit griping about the manipulation.
If I extrapolate the 19% price growth from the last 24 hours, I calculate that the price of 1 btc by the end of April will be $156,070. 
Me this morning (literally):

- Woke up at 5:30am for work
- drove to work sleepy AF and was wondering why I even came to work in the first place
- Got to work, turned on the computer, open the necessary programs, and opened an internet window
- Went into coinmarketcap hoping to see BTC in the $6,900-$7,100 range still
- saw $7,700 range, reloaded the page to make sure it was showing the correct price, pinched myself to make sure I wasn't in a dream, and researched why the sudden pump
- well in conclusion the sleepiness went away in a quickness and I'm more energetic to work now :)

-The End
$7.900 holy christ!
8k 👍
West Coast US gonna wake up and not know what just hit them.
We're gonna need a bigger boat
I like pumps as much as anyone, but I'm going to remain skeptical until we know for sure this isn't market manipulation meant to [wipe out those going short](https://i.imgur.com/EEMR6mA.png). 
Oh does it feel good to get out of that 6k hell hole! 
pamp eet
That’s right you damn dirty bastard, rise all the way to Valhalla 
**Support The Bulls**
It is primed to go.   I'm convinced 8.2k shortly.

As a long time boring hodler, I'm buying in for a few BTC.
Has anyone else not been able to do anything productive besides watch the price in the last couple of hours?  Or just me. 
#ready the vegeta memes boys
8k memes! Get the fucking 8k memes ready - look alive people, wtf are we even doing here.
I wont celebrate till we are over 15k.  Until then....  business as usual.
Pumpy wumpy
Meanwhile, over on the naughty step:

* they are celebrating BTC's rise with hand-wringing speculation that our mempool will fill up due to, er, not being a shitcoin & having 14x the volume of Bcash.
* Btrash is doing rather well at a garage in N. Queensland.  Pop: 231,628
* Lightning network is shit apparently.

Just a regular day over at r/btc then.
Do you guys see this?
This is gonna be all over the news in the morning lol
We just jumped almost $1,000 in less than one hour. Feels like December baby.
7.7 K - this is a proper pump now....
The short squeeze is underway. 
Tax season suppression nearing end ?
It was the calm before the storm now we have volume and a rock solid reason to believe the bulls have returned
Gimme an I.... I believe... I believe that we will HODL
**COME ON USA!** 
btc. at 13 % uprising.. This is a bull run
Somebody somewhere is laughing his cock off lol, I bet they are in tears reading some of the comments, I wonder what colour Lambo they have ordered hehe
Dear god finally
Looks like 200,000 BTC seized by Bulgaria in December were almost all sold from December to beginning of this month

Greed got me, I was waiting for 4k to buy some more, now I'll only have to enjoy my current smaller hodlings...
This is good for bitcoin.
greetings
**Come on America, you can't expect us Europeans to do all the work!**
I expect fewer people will dare to go short after this. and people on the sidelines will board again. I expect that the trend will be further upward
[deleted]
any clue about whos is manipulating this market?
**Come on bulls, show them who is the boss!**
leveraged longs are at 54.5%
yesterday shorts were at 57% when this thing started.

This little spike up is very similar to the spike down we saw yesterday before the run.  We could see something similar in the other direction
Hmmm can we get back over 8k again today? 🐳🐳🐳 🐂🐂🐂
There she goes again! Short sellers, prepare your sphincters for the next jump above $8,000.
If this goes to 9000K by today, I will sacrifice my first born
I'm just waiting for all of Asia to wake up tbh.
Let go bulls! Let’s get it over 8k today. All in!
This is it.
Bitcoin under 8K, *Buy the fucking dip* 
ITT: Shameless begging and baseless conjecture.


Wow, bull trap after short squeeze, classic, learned so much today!
Can someone ELI5 if the bitcoin network is sustained by miners why won't it fall apart when mining becomes unprofitable as they are paid fewer and fewer bitcoins over the coming years. Thanks.
Hulk's schlong incoming.

8.2k as promised earlier.
pure manipulation be super careful, people who shorted and were expecting bitcoin to break downwards got literally REKT, rekt like super hard, wait for it to consolidate and take a direction, entering now is a suicide 
Shorters getting rekt. 

Nice to watch.
LET'S F*CKN GO BOYCE
As someone who first got in to bitcoin in late December seeing it consistently gain is so exciting! I can't stop watching the chart
Jesus Christ. Jeeeeesus Christ. 
Couldn't have woken up at a better time
What.the.fuck
holy shit my dudes
I'm scared just now. $850 increase within 15 minutes. We'll see what happens.
WTFFFFFF

the pamp before ww3
I guess George Soros just bought in!
$8000. What is happening?

**A big push to $8200 please!**
**COOOME  ONNNN BULLLLS**
That was an eventful 50 minute commute to work. Don't trade and drive. Unless the market is doing THIS
If this is indeed a bull flag forming right now, we are in for another ride. 

To be honest, I doubt it. But wouldn't it be nice?
Member when we broke 8k?
Any explanation for the $1K increase besides algorithmic trading + FOMO?
Volume starting to increase a little. 
Anyone else think maybe Soros bought in lol
Bitcoin is flexing, getting ready for the NBA playoffs
Showerthought: Since so few orders of Bitcoin bought/sold over 20k $ you should have some sort of achievement if you managed to be one of those people.
Looks like someone do not want it fall below 7500...
Don't stop me now!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgzGwKwLmgM
huge sell wall at Gdax. here we go! 
To the moon 🌛
Any theories behind pump? Maybe [Soros](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-george-soros-reportedly-getting-144100148.html) or reaction to Syria UK parliament vote
It's almost time boys. Liftoff baby

Stand by - history in the making for the second time within 24 hours.
Told you  :)

*Dildo erectus sp. viridi* stands up and walks the crypto plains...


**Support The Bulls as much as you can folks.**
In these moves volume increases by 10-20x.

Amazing.

Huge resources on sidelines waiting to enter the market.
All in!  Let’s go!!!
Watching the fights between whales on Gdax is truly entertaining! 
I finally broke even again. Now for the long hodl and hopefully MOON
Peoples caution and paranoia to not lose their money is whats really holding back the market right now, will see if the mind set behind this changes anytime soon.
How has everyone enjoyed the green day?
Well if you missed it OMG coin just Mooned lol All my orders since JAN sold. Thanks Mr. Whale
What do you guys think is gonna happen overnight? It can't keep growing like this can it?!
**Good day from the UK**
Careful out there. A massive short requires a lot of buyers out there to build the position.

It doesnt take much to encourage a buying run at the right time when TA suggests a pivot point. Further short covering encourages it further.

It is like arm wrestling... you give your opponent a centimetre while you twist his wrist. Then push back harder when he is compromised.

Big Short: timed small pump - FOMO - stop buy cascade - short squeeze covering - then drop the hammer all in short.  
User vitalikmybuterin wrote this yesterday:

”Friend told me this : "Tomorrow otc for hedge funds is approved.. shorts gonna get rekd bad.. best part is its derivative guys over leveraged shorts.. likely will happen between midnight and 8 am Chicago time... " not sure if I believe but if true would be stupid slingshot up”




funny story, so i just woke up and went to the bathroom to take a shit, while checking bitcoin price on my phone, my butthole exploded, bought back in at 6550 feelsgoodman
Sell now #easymoney, buy next dip lol predictable
That price chart looks like the good old  fibonacci reverse rhino horn (pros correct me if im wrong).
Be careful if this thing dips below 7500. My bet is most people have their stops there.  This thing could head in the other direction just as fast. Stay safe out there
I look at the price increase from 6:55 to 7:35 am.  $6900 to $8000.   What could possibly justify a 16% increase in value of a currency in 35 minutes?

It does seem like this price is very manipulatable. 
When I wrote that it makes sense to buy the dips on the way down, because it might go up too fast. I got downvoted. A lot!
This is not good...
time to sell
Me this morning (literally):
-wake up for my morn poo
-check phone once seated on the throne
-let out a sigh of relief and had the most relaxed morning meeting with myself in last while!  An anti anxiety shat ftw!

Thank god I got mini rekt on a short I tried last week and learned my lesson :  Went all in yesterday morn....woot woot :-D
Where are the fudders and "its goin to 4k" guys at?

Best thing about this spike is the TA experts trying to explain it
**Fork! it, I just sold my wife for 1 Bitcoin.** 
Well I'm sure we've all noticed that yesterday's 6% smack took like a day to resolve and todays 3% or 4% whatever it was took a few hours...

Smack are getting smaller, recovery times quicker... 
Any clue why shitcoins are trending and BTC market % is going down?
Stormy's dildo has made a guest appearance.
What a weird day..
Get ready guys!! 
Fuckin' > 400 USD in one 30 min candle so far.  

8 days loss made up in a few minutes.

Hope it doesn't dump too low.
HOLY FUCK
#\#Dildoing
yay
I think this is Soros getting in.
Time to go all in, this won't be shorted any time soon
Soros and zucc finally bought.
I swear they trying to break a record or something. It's madness!
Gemini began block trading this morning. Is this it or that not visible to day traders?

Beautiful strait GREEN line!

Wtf was that
What in the fuck?
What is happening? :D GO TEAM BULL!
Does anyone have any news of why we are pumping????!!!!
Massive bull run on NOW.
Up 15% in minutes.

Krakens trading platforms crashed.
**Come on Bulls, don't throw this victory away now!**
We should let Lamborghini know to rise their production throughput.
Can someone please tell us why pump all of a sudden? 
Some news or something like that?
I was dicussing with a friend that we should buy soon as the price is only $6800. One hour later; $7900 o_O.
nice party here :)
The sudden rise...whats happening? :) 
**East Coast - Wave 2**
The built-in technical analysis meter in tradingview.com just switched to "buy". This is the first time in a long time.
Holy fuck, thank god my stop buy limit order filled. I specifically put it $50 higher because I knew if it ever reached this price, it would be a huge rise.
TA:

It has resumed the Mitsubishi (modified) Step Pattern.
Buy Bitcoin or not guys help........
Watch the volume guys. And yes, it's a battle.
uuuh yes we've been planning this all along nothing to worry about 
Dont feed the whales :)
What was the purpose of the little dip from 6.95k to 6.8k before the spike to 8k? It seems rather odd and totally did not expect that. 
**Come on Bulls, don't throw all the hard work away!**
Well that took forever to happen.
I saw a convoy of trucks carrying quilts.
whale fight on gdax right now!
Could someone explain what's going on here to me? I've never had this happen in a Bitcoin transaction before.

Edit: never mind, it got confirmed, just was showing no confirmations for 6+ hours. all good. :)

Bitcoin climbing through a series of triangles while volume increases.
We implemented a transaction malleability fix (after a 2+ year debate, finally won and demonstrating anti-fragility in an entire new way for Bitcoin.

My question is regarding all the coins that use Bitcoins open source code, but didn't implement Segwit. The further we go down the road with Segwit releases of software like Bitcoin 0.16.0, am I correct in it becomes more and more difficult to "copy and paste" Bitcoins code? And coins will be forced to some developer work themselves or find another way to keep up?

Is there another malleability fix being used for the coins that were just using Bitcoins code? I know many coins are now Segwit compatible but many haven't....
Trading bots, are the Devilllll
HERE WE GO AGAAAAAAINNNNN!!!
Damn, look at that buy wall! Hope it sustains.
holy smokes...
RIP, Tether is the only coin in red today.
It's nice looking at the 1 day chart and realizing how much there is to gain. 
Don't have any bitcoin, camr hwre after swwing the jump. What caused such a huge climb?
$7,900 BTFO
almost there.

Edit: volume swing - could go higher - 8.5?  

Def 8.2.
I you sell below 8.17, you will have trouble getting back in.
bitfenix **finex** cmon delete the fck bear walls let the market flow freely,  manipulation level 100!!!
So wtf was that about?
It's like..... a whale had too many beans for lunch, took a huge dump, then swallowed that dump back up.
It always goes up Friday.. but I think it's after 5pM?

If so, what's the high point?
Wow. 100 btc sell wall at 7,975 got destroyed in seconds.
Thunderbirds are go.

Christ, that was a crappy thing to say.  LOL
8000 is the new black.
I feel sorry for the shorters... not!
All the people with open shorts are quiet all of a sudden? Interesting. (I should say *had* open shorts). Rekt. 
I haves dreem to haves one whole of the bit coin. Since child I haves this dreem. Now no family is not alive and I haves lost everything and including job. I only ask for you to help me reach this dreem. This will make the life worth living. Pleese help this dreem become truthful. 
Arise my son! Arise! Proud Son of Satoshi! 
Now this is what i call a dildo 
Wow. I went all in with 30k yesterday...this is how the bulls repay me! Let me tell you how USA sentiment works. My boys who didn’t listen to me in Alabama are now buying in. This will be out of reach for the West Coast by the time they wake up 
"Thanks for buying at 8k, now we can afford new lambos" /whales
Can’t wait for the “whale manipulation” posts
Lemme get this straight.  Apparently this subreddit believes that a multi-billionaire investor, and notorious short, hatched a plan to short bitcoin a few days ago?   And this subreddit found out about it?  And this billionaire went ahead with the plan,  just now,  and it backfired?  

Would you modify that belief just slightly?

How about a famous and powerful billionaire and professional short,  cozies up to a handful of overwhelmed new and insanely rich exchange entrepreneurs,  who's shinny new money machines have just recently started seizing up as HODL takes a hold,  say late December 2017.   Said billionaire convinces said exchange owners to lend him bitcoin,  for a fee of course, ya know,  to replace the trading income that's disappearing?   Do that independently,  secretly, and simultaneously with just four or five exchanges,  and........

Or not




So it will slowly going down after this short squeeze right?Basically it's just like yesterday for me to wait it going down ...
The price is once again in that strange (for BTC) very narrow range moving sideways.

These are odd times.  I haven't seen this trend before.  No gradual decline or rise or the usual oscillations.

It is either going to be huge red or green dildos.
Beijing waking up.

8k will be breached.

Then beyond 8.2 (8.5?)

Settling at 8.2.

Don't sell under 8.17
Cor blimey, so the dip is really over. Good thing I bought a good amount a week ago.
We are like a Great White Shark approaching their prey.  First we give 8k a little tap with our snout to inspect and we fall back just a little before coming back full blast for the kill.  
I suspect Bitcoin is female: completely unpredictable and irrational.
We all want to get to the moon but It's not happening today, just wait and see.

It's just gonna drop down like 5-10% now at any time.

BYE BYE ALL NAYSAYERS SEE YOU AT NEXT STOP *MOON*
Fuck all the haters. This has been beaten down by some huge seller for weeks. About time the bulls took over. 
This is not going to work, people are still too positive. If this was the real bottom then everyone would say this is fake.

Been waiting since around 6600 to buy in thinking it might go a bit lower, wake up to this today, say fuggit and fomo in at 7800 hoping to make some money today if it goes back above 8k. We shall see..... if not oh well

Congrats to everyone who bought the dip from 19k and held all the way down. Bitcoin is the future yeah it might drop below 6k but just know it will come back up. You have to understand the game before you play.
Look, we're pushing 8k now, wake up guys.
Unexpected sale of a few hundred on an Asian market.  

Stand by. 8k consolidation coming.

8.2k cert.

8.5 possible.
we moon now?
Looking at Cryptowatch..there are always long reds following long greens, someone just made some big money while everyone was jumping on his self created green...the dump is incoming.
Lambo mode engage
Up 1k in 24 hours; slowly creeping back down 1k in the next 24 hours. Oh Bitcoin, you evil temptress. 
New the Bitcoin world so just getting my head around it and was hoping someone could let me know if what im thinking is right. 

So based on the original whitepaper Bitcoin is a system of electronic cash that allows for peer to peer payments meaning we dont need paypal for example . Its my understanding that the way paypal works or any trusted third party payment provider works is like below 

In a normal situation where two people wish to send money to each other over the internet they use a trusted third party such as PayPal. The reason that they use a trusted third party is to ensure that the money being transferred is actually transferred and received. If we take the example of Alice sending money to Bob Paypal would credit Alices account of they money and then debit it to Bobs account. PayPal creates a record of this process ensuring the neither party can later claim that payment wasn’t sent or received. If PayPal didn’t exist Alice could tell Bob she issued payment without actually having done so or Bob could claim payment was never received. This allows for Alice to double spend the money she owes or for Bob to request double payment. PayPal acts as an intermediator to the transaction charging a fee for the service of providing payment transfer. 

With Bitcoin payments are peer to peer meaning no trusted third party is used. Instead of paypal confirming transactions and creating a record of payment and receipt this is all done in an automated way with transactions being grouped together to form blocks and blocks being linked together in a sequential chain that can only be added to and once added to cant be altered. 

Transactions are confirmed once a block has been created and added to the blockchain. For a block to be created people have to expended computational power looking to solve for a nonce value. The nonce value is a value that gives a blocks header a certain value but im not sure what this value is .

Could someone please explain what a nonce is and tell me if I am on the right track  in terms of paypal versus bitcoin? 
price going up
Buying Bitcoin
**Support The Bulls**
Wait wat
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) moonman
WHAT THE FUCK
How much coin has to be bought to drive the price up $450 in 20 minutes? 
judging by the comments the huge dildo we saw in btc is due to a pump and dump group... if not forgive me daily discussion 
But Bitcoin is dead!!!!! omg ??
BUY TYME ____TO THE MOON
Bought at 7300 and it sky rocketed to 7550. Have put a stop limit at 7500. Feels good.
https://coub.com/view/whvpg
wow what happened!
**Another HUGE GREEN CANDLE please!**
It appears that with slightly more volume, this may indicate a possible breakout. However it is still a moderate movement. Nevertheless the buyers and sellers may possibly have agreed on a price. There could be an increase in the number of trades today.
Dang it! My gdax deposit clears tomorrow! Now I'm going to wait to buy until it cools down a bit. 
Hi.  Need some advice.  I have been into bitcoin for a couple of years. Done me well.  However I am working with a young guy who is 16.  I am at a loss of what advice to give him.  Any suggestions for wallets for an under 18 year old in the UK will be very appreciated. He is intending to put in 10 to 20 quid a week max so bit pointless buying a trezor now. Even xapo is age restricted now (don't remember that in 2015).
Was reading Bitmex trollbox, craziest responses ever
Someone HODL me. 
**Don't throw this away Bulls**
I like what this guy has written:

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/tdwpmW45-BTC-Word-of-The-Day-SHORT-SQUEEZE/
So why the sudden jump today?  It's been wavering in the 6.6K to 7.1K range for the last several weeks.  Suddenly, today is a breakout from that range.

Any news causing this surge? 
Where is that guy, MrMan/ProfessorDingle etc etc? 
a swing up like a golf stick https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin
Only people arriving to morning workstations at this hour is Siberia / Alaska.

Nothing against those folks, but they're not exactly numerous.
It's testing.  Someone wants it over 8k.

8.2
I feel it 
Are we breaking out????!!!
Blast off.
Oh boy, it's happening, from 7720 to 7900..we might test 9k resistance in the next few hours.
[deleted]
I have been trying to understand what shorting is for the last few days and I have a rough idea after some reading.

Please educate me here people, so I was basically thinking about what I think happened today, if huge numbers of people were shorting surely if enough people buy at a certain point then that would stop this trend?

My main concerns in the last week or so have been what happens if people just keep shorting continually the price will never move ie pump and dump continually?

Lastly do the shorters have a get out card ie a stop loss trigger

Again you need to speak to me like a 6 year old I am learning slowly
Unfortunately I missed today's race, any advice?
I have been trying to recover from 0.2BTC since April that my father-in-law and my mother-in-law lost being deceived by a group of people. Unfortunately they are poor and without much study
Touche 
2am volume spikes
Sorry for the newb question, but what are the transaction fees for sending BTC from Breadwallet to GDAX? For now, I buy BTC on GDAX and store it on Breadwallet. But if I want to transfer some back to GDAX to sell, will I get screwed by fees?

Anyone with knowledge on this issue would be greatly appreciated!
Here it comes, next leg up....
Best Krypto day in 2018
Sorry probably dumb question, but do you guys think this is a good time to buy?
Here we go.  8.2k 
Not yet! But it could happen in a blink.
Do you think there will be more shorts to be squeezed further up?
So what the hell happened... I haven't gotten the memo yet.

Why did every crypto spike up yesterday?
Can someone ELI5 what "shorts squeezed" means?
I'm having trouble finding a good active thread on option for tumbling bitcoin and/or purchasing anonymously. Can anyone help me out? Personal reccomendations are fine however I'm not interested in tumblers that rare run by illegal markets.
Good ol' Mitsubishi Step Pattern to 100k.
yes gonna happen overnight

Lambo ordered, all the extras ;P
Good day to you all. 
-Over $7k today folks?

-Volume is going up slowly which is a good sign. This time yesterday we were around 7500 on GDAX, today 10700.
Hello there, 

I've been accumulating some fraction of BTC (just a bit above 0.1BTC) little by little renting my GPUs time on Nicehash.

In my area (Belgium), there is a possibility to use BTC for purchasing delivery food. I've been wanting to pull the trigger on a large Hawaii Pizza delivery just to have a feel that I'm using my BTC and not just Hodling. But don't want to be THAT pizza guy. That kinda summarize my BTC experience at the moment. Since the value of the BTC is dropping, the amount of pizza I would be able to buy is constantly dropping. FOMO or Pizza?

I don't think that the BTC value of a pizza worth today 15 euro will ever pay me a lambo in the future, but at the same time I just could use fiat to pay the pizza and keep hodling and see what the future bring.
5ORO5
Well that was fun and short lived 
That pushed Bcash down to 0.092

Yay.

(But they'll be shouting "we breached 700 USD" as if it was some sort of victory.)

Edit: added a bit.
I literally woke up on the right side of that dildo and went all in lol

woohoooo!

this might be the bull flag breakout. wouldn't it be nice?
Showerthough - BTC, today, reached its highest price of the month so far...
Time to deposit more fiat
I apologize for such a noob question but can anyone tell me exactly what to do in GDAX to set an order to sell all of my bitcoin if the price drops to 7500? I have read their guide so many times but still don't really understand the limit/stop and taker/maker stuff. I want to ensure I realize gains from this 14% increase before it drops back down to 6500. Thanks!
Holy shit we are at 8000 dollars again. Get those buy orders ready we going to the moon.
Annnd back down it goes. Was fun while it lasted, but not really. 
8k isn't coming. Stop. After a 1k increase in eighteen hours there will be a HARD pullback.
If this turns out to be a PnD then it will further solidify the fact that Bitcoin is incapable of becoming a currency.
Touched 8000 on Bitstamp..

Will push on to a little beyond 8.2 then fall back.
 nigga plizz https://postimg.cc/image/uu8625but/
my TA told me this would happen i ain't surprised
I would add that I predicted 8.2k earlier - see below.

That was the last bull flag, guys! To the moon!

[deleted]
Allot of people still waiting on the sideline because they think it's a trap. If a whale is smart, they would pump at least one more time before dumping to earn peoples trust back into BTC. After that, it might even grow naturally even with their dumps. 
Ok someone riddle me this.. On Gdax theres a red 66BTC sell order at $7,730.00 sat there. Just across the spread theres a 17BTC green buy order at $7,729.99 theres literally $0.01 difference between them.

Why don't the exchanges just match them up? I really REALLY doubt those selling/buying are going to quibble over small change that adds up to less than $1.00 in total?
Hey all, about to begin a livestream on BTC price analysis and wanted to extend an invite to the community here! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHjTYuuiVFE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHjTYuuiVFE)
I can't transfer my bitcoin from bitcoin.com wallet , why there is no button to transfer whats wrong with it please let me know if anyone know about it. i have bitcoin in my wallet but in sent section it shows 0.00 btc. but i have 0.023394 btc in my wallet please help me guys 

To all the people who shorted BTC. 
Thats the fucking game😂😂
Who is going to short ! 
11:30 GMT pump slowly approaching.
Lambo boys are back, a few more and i will sell
[deleted]
**Please can you all upvote this thread, not my post but this price thread.  Thanks.**
Be patient.

8.5k coming.

Settling at 8.2k.
Volume is low = ~~bear~~ bull trap :D
Now *that* was orchestrated! Does anyone know which groups do this signalling?
Pro shorts still killing the small guy I think.   I think pro shorts made off with your fiat in the initial plunge from ATH to 6k,  I think most covered, but not all. Pro shorts are ballsy.  As the remaining close their large positions, you see these spikes.

But now the newb shorts have arrived, and their panic will add fuel to the fire.

PS: I feel like a war correspondent 
IS THE BULL MARKET FINALLY COMING? 
Did some technical analysis on the charts. I know TA can be unreliable at times but it does explain why there's an increase. I don't think it's a bull market though - just a temporary increase
Here's my full thoughts: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWZo00bIkx8&feature=youtu.be
i think...my opinion...
if in next few hours there is a big dump....
bitcoin is over,end game.........
This isnt over yet, my TA guestimate puts it over 8500$
Let us enjoy Mick Mulvaney while he’s still in power. Without him, bitcoin would have been regulated to the ground. We were hoping for 2 more years so we can work on adoption but it looks like he’s gone too. 
[deleted]
That was like viagra on speed.
Lmao this was me. With BTC my eyes just go to straight to the last 3 digits now. And boy, mfw I noticed the 7.
Prepare your anus!
It’s great!  Finally some action. 
YTD?
When the price drop whales buy more coins? So what do they need with a bunch of coins that are declining? Nothing. Thats why when they have bought up enough coins they manipulate the price to increase and they sell at a higher price for profit. Its not that hard if nobody was buying crypto then thats when you know crypto is dead until then buy low sale hig, sell high buy low, hodl what ever makes you happy.
Heh.  This is hodler heaven.

Probably, it went up 1000 dollars out of nothing. Doesn't look natural to me... 
it's a shorters-get-rekt trap.
maybe. 

We're still in the downtrend channel. We need to stay above 7900 for a longer time to break free of that.
Sign me up.
I'd settle for a 40!
Its pronounced hodl! :))
Eat a hot curry and put the toilet roll in the fridge overnight.
looks like someone got an itch to buy like 3k bitcoin at once. and everyone promptly boarded the hype train. 

This was not the one to sell on
lol Buzz
It's called a [deathbed conversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deathbed_conversion).
Lambos all round boys!
This story, although well written and informative, is worthless without the result of your research... 
I raise you at $8k
It is worth noting that people buying isn't necessarily a pump.

That is rather like thinking that every time it is sunny, the Feds have forgotten to control the weather.
I look at this like sports betting. Those shorters... they're betting against Team Bitcoin. 

Some of them have a bigger gambling problem than others. Some lost their lunch money, others might have lost their house.

That sucks, I guess. But am I gonna cry about it? Nah. They were rooting for the bad guy.
I could live with that.
Assuming that it's manipulated, what good does it serve who to wipe out the short positions?  

I mean ... what's the maths here?
Agreed, nice to see some activity, regardless if we dip again. 
I think when Asia wakes up we have a chance at 8k
[deleted]
same.
Vegeta is 9k not 8k. 

Edit:   Never mind I am told I am wrong there is an 8k one too. 
Let us be friends!
Hodly wodly.
You bitcoin nerds are so unfunny. I swear the way you guys talk and that internet jargon is fucking annoying. Speak English, stop talking like little kids.. I hate hearing this crap everyday. It’s always stupidass words like moon, lambo, hodl, Bulls etc. I hope you all get run over by a semi.
meanwhile at the legion of doom....
Lol...nice
I saw this 2 days ago.
So much volume my browser keeps crashing.
 full on cpr
Yep tax season ends Tuesday 4/17 and my Delta portfolio just went up big time in 2 minutes ! I was just thinking of selling some BTC for some alts , so glad I waited to finish a cup of coffee, that’s all it took !


Matt black, like I always do. 
This is good for battleships. 
It’s not going to 4K. There are too many people watching bitcoin price and would fomo back in way before it ever reached that price.  
Yep.

Even things that are bad for Bitcoin are good for Bitcoin.

When will the world realise this simple truth?
Hi.  Welcome to a friendly forum.
Ummmm, shorts wait for price to rise to put in their positions, they don't do it while the price is low.
Yes.  A major confidence boost in BTC.  Shorting has become much more risky.
Looks like it is slowly trending back down since it peaked at 8k. How far back down will it go?.....
Teaches them for daring to short the great Bitcornholio. 
Mammals of some sort
Not so fast, we need some time to come up with new over 9000 memes.
Definitely a she: completely irrational and unpredictable.

I was considering using my wife's movements around a clothes shop as the basis of a random number generator.
Just tell him that his new name will be Satoshi from then on.
He will understand.
hahahahahahaha 

I'm pretty sure we're not going to see $9MM today.. Let alone this year
I hope they don't all jump up and down simultaneously.
We hit 8k once, Then some weak hands let it go
Plus tomorrow is Friday and people get paid. I think it’s going to be a weekend to celebrate   
Yup it’s happening!
Embittered Bcasher.
So no different than any other day in here?  Or any other crypto sub for that matter?
It’s going to continue up, there will be many dips, and each will recover to the prior level.
The less miners there are, the more profitable it is.  The more miners there are, the less profitable it is.  This is because we are sharing block rewards among all miners in a pool.

Ultimately many of them will exit, but only down to a certain sweet spot where the others are incentivized to stay.  After all, if too many exit, then suddenly there's money to be had by joining back in.

Unfortunately, I think the ones that stick it out through the end will be centralized in areas with cheap electricity & no govt regulation, and a lot of the most powerful hardware and largest mining operations.  Centralization is bad for the network integrity, but it won't fall apart.
oh no don't gimme that. You said buy now before it hit 8.17 because you can never buy it at that price again. guess what? it's that price again lol. everyone knew it was gonna go up that high, your specific ass prediction of 8.17 and to the moon was wrong though. just sayin
When the majority short, whales pump..
Thanks for the advice. I admit I was on the outside - but only because all the 'analysts' on Twitter kept saying it was going to drop. Next time I will listen to my instinct. I'll just have to wait this out.
Man the harpoons! It's whale-hunting season :)
lol came here to say this!!

Edit: Long live the green dildo
I hope this bull run will break the 7.6k marker looking to be bullish right now
Good for you.  And good luck!
Consistently? All the gains were in an hour, It has been sideways all day
Don't listen to the negativity mate.  Well done and nice work.
I realised about 3 weeks ago I needed to delete the Coinbase app and stop checking. It’s been making me miserable since I bought in late December. Not looking at it every day was a complete help. 

I checked in the price today by chance (there was a link on BBC) and it’s the first good news in ages!

Been looking at it and checking back regularly like you. 
If there's a drop on the way it will be epic.
Lol ... everyone had a conspiracy theory when the price dropped by $300 but no one is asking when it shoots up $1,000 :)

Anyway, it's due to large purchases of close to 40,000 BTCs on Bitfinex within a 30min span.
Guilty of trading and driving lol
Half an hour ago ? 
Pepperidge farm remembers
Likely a short squeeze. BTC was heavily shorted in the region between 6-7k.  
It's what a sharp increase in price is called because it forces those who had short positions to close those positions, most of the time at a loss. 
This was a "short squeeze".
I suppose a lot of money on the sidelines waiting to come in, but very cautious until someone pulled the trigger.

That 1k pump has cost some market manipulators a lot of money if they want to buy back in again!
Yeah I think it'll start to stabilize sub 8,000 but creep up.  Especially after April 17th.
A little!?  It's gone up lots!  
Better hope that's not the single reason behind this bump, because if so it'll drop just as fast very soon.
r/bitcoin, now with commentary by Stephen A. Smith...

How many? Do you know?
Yes if it does, everyone will jump off the ship!
$7725.... noice
What? that 15BTC one at £5,470?
wont last long
Edgy.
No dude, lol, no.
we are the bulls. Horn up bro
I wouldn't call this market held back. I'm up 30% yesterday. 
am i just paranoid or am i just stoned?

Mr Whale is thanking you, because he knows rest of the year is up and you just sold all your coins to him. 
OMG isn't even close to its "Moon" yet. People that know anything about the project are waiting very patiently...

Top of the moning to yah gov-nah!

No one in the UK says Good day.

It is good morning, hi, good evening, hello - never good day.
In a nutshell, that's what I'm a bit wary of. I'm glad that we're finally seeing more predictable consolidation patterns, but I'm not going to let a single green candle be a sign that we're going parabolic in April.
Very refreshing in this sub.
Well damn. 
will you icyhottotheballs if BTC goes over 9000 today?
Go back in there and squeeze those buttchecks mister
Almost as predictable as retarded comments making predictions.
But it's not that easy, Because most people were waiting for the price to go up before they bought, now they have bought the price will go down and they will sell rinse and repeat. 
If you sell your Bitcoin, you will realize capital gains tax, which would wipe out any profits form today's bump. Just hold onto your Bitcoin until you need to spend it in the future.
You're good at this.  You should have a Youtube crypto-channel.
Does that mean it's going up or down?
Yeah. I see 7500 and 7440 as major support. If it breaks 7440 I can easily see 7100 or 7k
OK bud.  **Were stayin' safe.**

Ah've got the beans and guns holed up under the tarp in the cave.  It wi take some real shit to tak us out.

Taurus was entering Uranus.
Pump precedes dump .......
Have you ever heard of supply and demand?
> What could possibly justify a 16% increase in value of a currency in 35 minutes?

A whale's thumb slipped off the scale.
The short term moving average crossed the long term moving average on the 6 hour chart probably triggered a lot of buy pressure.  
Mother nature gives with one hand....
You’re disgusting dude. Nobody cares about your experience taking a shit.

They are squeezed:

Some people call that hodling :)
Unnecessary panic selling by many many traders.  Stop losses triggered on the dip.
Mexicans
Silk road degenerates 
Quilt Whales
The only manipulation was keeping the price down. This is just natural.. 
No every move is manipulation. Maybe it's just a fight between long and shorts, like it always is. 
It's only Thursday. It will dump as we enter the weekend tomorrow.

Don't buy the top!
To be fair on these boys, I've been looking at the TA cheat-sheet and there's no predictive pattern for:

'humongous erect green dildo emerging out of nowhere.'


So true haha
Maybe a contributory factor with this green zone at the walls right now is the plan of some European countries to put blockhain in their financial system and it boost the trust of the people with the cryptocurrencty
I think you ask it in a wrong way... Bitcoin is trending right now 
[removed]
This is the bull run we are waiting for...
Soros got in because there was a swing coming on the 6hr chart.  
You'd need to go back through all the data, but this may well be a record dildo within that timeframe.
Much more likely, this is a short squeeze driven by Bitmex and Bitfinex shooters getting liquidated. 
People more resilient than ever - could go a long way!
supporting...
cant get into coinbase god damitt
Don't question the Crypto Gods! Be gone thot!
Just saw this... wwwhhhhaaaaat happened where....? time to check Korean / Japanese news?
The Rothschild’s or Soros just bought in LOL.
SoroS
The buying cue for traders was the bottom of the 6hr chart, which triggers a big upswing because all sellers stop selling and all buyers start buying at the same time.  These jumps aren’t 1 guy deciding to buy or sell all his coins.
Hit bottom on the 6hr chart yesterday
No news, simple ta. I knew this would happen.
'Krakens trading platforms crashed.' Shocker
All of a sudden!?  We have been waiting nearly 4 months! 
Something like that. 
John McAfee said he's gonna eat his balls as well if we don't hit $1m in 3 years. 
the wind blew to the left. 
When it was clear the 6hr chart had bottomed out, there was a mass buy in by all traders, and sellers stopped selling.
U still should. 
🌓 
Whales. Expect it to go down again in short term
We got to a tip of a triangle and had to go up or down, thankfully we went up this time, which is a good sign. We still have a few downwards-going lines to breach though before we can celebrate (including the main one at ~8.8-8.9k now).
Moments before the rise it was saying 'sell'.
I certainly wouldn't use that indicator as a signal.
Only you can make that decision.
My gut prediction is it will drop again today and then Friday will gradually rise (might pump too). Probably dip on Sunday.  Within the next two weeks we’ll start to see a genuine organic bull market starting once USA taxes are paid on April 17th.  I’m planning to rebuy and hold on next dip. 
Buy
You'll see a lot of small dips and larger dips, and each one will recover until the 6hr chart peaks.
Are you krilling?
my guess it was to bait people into opening more shorts before pumping it past 7000 to trigger buy orders and squeeze the shorts, pushing it even higher as they close.
Quilt Whales
wait, let me just switch channels from bitfinex on tradingview to gdax...
It's a transaction with multiple outputs (e.g. one sender, multiple recipients).
I had assumed that you could trade in the region your ID has been verified in, and not on IP/geolocation. So if you used (for example) a UK passport to verify your identity when signing up, you'd be given access to the EUR & GBP markets. 
Yes you can - it is based on your login and not on your IP location. I am currently in Romania and have no problems (though GDAX had to change my location to the UK in order to get verified!). So that was a hassle, but no problems now based on location.
https://i.imgur.com/fPvABbl.jpg
No they're not. They are just the natural consequence of free markets. If you like Bitcoin, you like free markets. Wait, it will all play out just fine in the long run...
We hit the bottom of the 6hr chart (moving averages crossed over) and might hit the bottom of the 1 day chart. 
That's pretty darn specific. What are the winning lottery numbers again?
Agree as to 8.17. Disagree as to 8170.
Just pump it over 8k already    So close 
No sweat.  There are other markets.  8k incoming.  Then 8.2

Possibility of 8.5, but that percentage is getting lower.
Just wait.
We couldn't break the resistanc at 8k. So we fall to the next support which is 7800. If it doesn't hold we fall again. 
Be aware it is Friday the 13th
Why don't you at least try to
Well, I did not announce here that I had a short position but actually I do have one, and it's still alive. It's a small position (just started to build it up) and no, I don't use crazy leverage so I am fine. I am actually thinking about adding to it now, but first I'll wait and watch what happens. My first target is 6k, and I think we'll be there soon. Yes, I think this is a short term bull run. And if I am wrong, well then I will take a calculated loss.

Please note, I don't make the market, I just go with it. And trading last years bull market was much more fun than this shit show right now.

Been waiting for it to rise so that I could put in some new short positions -- wasn't a safe bet when it was hovering in the 6600s or 6700s. But I'll take 8000 and feel pretty good about it all.
I always dreamt of owning a lambo. Please help!
No family, no job, no home. Only a sole wallet remains. SoS
Somebody get this man a Bitcoin!
Lol
arise chicken
Looking too long for a dildo now.  We need a new word for that one.
Buying in now? After 25% raise? Good luck...
From the west coat staying in EU.. woke up late and watched the 🚀 
Congratulations dude. Glad it worked out for you
You’re about 2 hours late for those haha
Haven't heard that one yet. maybe a handful of people have suggested it but that doesn't mean 'this subreddit' thinks it. There are currently 10 thousand people online.

My magic 8 ball says yes
It’s caution while waiting for the 1d chart to crossover.  When moving averages on the 1d chart shift, your guess is as good as mine on the top.
Spending waaaay to much time thinking about this...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Di_dqMWsp8
Well you’re an idiot. Maybe, the whales are female because they’re unpredictable and irrational since they manipulate Bitcoin’s prices. But, Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that doesn’t get to choose its own fate. People and investors that.
Rofl
You must be fun at parties.

I signed it, but I think it's useless.

Amazon *will* accept Bitcoin when it'll be profitable to do so. Bitcoin is on the right path, but it will take some time.
I think its more important for us to get paid in bitcoin, wages etc

What does this pump have got to do with USA? A lot of people are saying 'Go America', I didnt get the reason behind it?
Any news?
But my alt didn't 😭😭 What's happening
Buy high sell low right?
I'd wait longer to have even more regrets later
At 7500 the FUD will strike back and make you sell at a loss.
Been there done that.
*Doomp it again.*
Yes. Prepare your lambo order.
Bought 20k worth at the very top, I'm hodling hard with my friends laughing at my current loss lol... I believe bitcoin is part of the future though 
It will never again drop below 6k now.
Crescent Moon
Someone missed the dip 
No dump incoming.  Look at the volumes and intents across all markets.  < 2% probability.
Short it! With 25x Lev ;)
Tesla mode engage
Yeah, this wreaks. I just can't pull the trigger. Nothing happened, there is no reason for this bump. 
All of this is great for bitcoin. Not dropping below 6k shows how fantastic BTC is holding long term value.

Even crazy fluctuation, we are doing significantly better than years ago.

Its this that gives confidence to investors that are willing to take on a bit more risk. Since the government said they wouldnt ban BTC, Ive been doing 1k/week
Um no
Look on the right hand side and there are links to topics, like Bitcoin for Beginners. 
**Save The Babies**


Not necessarily a lot, if all the bears decide to pull their sales at the same time the buy is happening.
No, the 6hr chart hit a bottom yesterday.  This is traders buying in mass because they know it’s going up for a while.
Just a whale who needed a new lambo!
Bend over then
I'd call 9K as a decent signal. Remember, it's bitcoin. 
Same :/

market manipulation
Heh.  Not a good day for trolling.  Good for Bitcoin.


..in the air tonight?

Anyone got that drumming meme to hand for its next set at 8.2k?
See FAQ >>>
Google shorting.  There is a strict financial definition based upon the future value of a commodity.

I think that, sometimes in the crypto-space, the term is used more loosely to mean buying at a dip and selling at a high over a short time period - day trading.
Start quilting. 
Advice, were on a bull run. buy
This is an opinion, not a investment tip
Just hold. Rest of the year should be up in my opinion anyway. 
Just hodl what you got.
It is not going to 9k today, nor going to under 7k. My suggestion is buy at around 7.5k and hold a little while from there. Just my opinion.
Where?  Don't scare me
Lol - fairly low bar this year. 
It moved15% up in the last 24 hours. I'd wait or buy in dips 
With Bitcoin its best to buy as needed for purchasing and if you want to invest, you need to invest a small, set amount on a regular basis and commit to never impulse buying. Its not good to impulse sell either but at least with that the worst case scenario is you lose out on an oppurtunity to make a lot of money.

I have automatic withdrawals set up so I invest about $100 a week into crypto and if I want to use BTC for a purchase, I do a one time exchange of just enough for the purchase and spend it immediatly.

The biggest mistake you can make is trying to play the market. Get the phrase "is this a good time to buy" out of your head because no matter what you will always be gambling. Small, regular investments over long periods of time is the strategy most likely to work. Sure, you might think about buying in big time and then later finding out you would have made a killing if you had done it, but for every situation like that there are 100 more where you buy in and end up selling at a loss because you panicked or invested more than you could afford.

Bitcoin investing is for the money you have left over after you pay off all your high interest debt, max out retirement contributions, and establish a cash emergency fund (3 months living expenses). Think of they money you invest in BTC like the money you would spend on luxury items.
Yes
Can you HODL for a year or longer? Then any time is a good time to buy.
Plenty.  Only 17k out of 40k closed their positions.

There's still 23k short.  
BTC spiked, the others followed.

If you want the reason, you need to talk to a female.
It happens a lot in Hollywood.
It means that there aren't enough sellers in the market when short sellers try to close their position.  When this happens, short sellers are forced to buy at higher price which pushes the overall market price higher.  

Usually happens when there's a sudden upswing in price, which results in margin calls and short sellers don't have the money to top up.

Unlikely to happen in BTC because the volume of shorts is very low and shorts can be closed quite easily.
It is morning in Europe - that's where a lot of the bullishness is currently coming from.
I only cry when I think about saving the babies.
It will take a few days, if it comes.  Looks like we might be hitting the bottom of the 1day chart, which means we’ll be in a true bull market, so no more giant dumps.
[I can so just sit here and cry](https://youtu.be/7Ks_wf1O0mA) 
No, it’s the real deal
Should I lock my door?
Nonsense 
You keep posting this, but it really is nonsense.


No.  

8.2k.  

Not 9k yet.

Thanks, cheers!

first of all volume doesnt mean anythhing. secound it could be sell volume more than buying yesterday thus more volume . volume is useless as an idicator
lol just don't order extra pizzas to get a feel of how it is to use Bitcoin IRL.
Pay for pizza with €15 worth of BTC then buy €15 worth of BTC. You'll use your bitcoins and end up with the same amount.
you don't actually think this is only Soros right? 
But... you posted this less than a month ago:

> Sell now. I've been right the last two predictions. Downvote at your own peril. Nostradamus has spoken. 

(3/19/18)
Now I’m late for work but idgaf 
You should google what bulltrap means. This isnt one
Do a stop order, sell at $7500. Put all your bitcoins by clicking on your number of bitcoins. For example if you have 4.3 BTC, click on 4.3 and it will populate the funds you wold get at a stop order of $7500. GDAX now tells you the fee associated with that order. That’s why I hate stop orders. Limit orders have no fees. And yes you are a noob.
Because it will keep going up and up and up and everyone will become lambo rich. Like December. Very smart buying on long greens.
Yep.  We're at 8.1

I called 8.2 hours ago, and am getting crit for being imprecise.

I was only trying to save the babies.


UP 12.5% in last 24 hours.
Why do you think so?  I frankly don't think BTC is predictable to any reasonable extent in the short term.
Agreed.  I get that Hodlers are excited, but it's waaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyy to soon to be planning a trip to the moon
1 hour, sideways for 17
lolol
o really :)
Just the Tip? =D
> Will push on to a little beyond 8.2 then fall back.

How do you figure this?
May go higher than that with weekend buying coming soon 
Please kind sir, can you just say that you predict 100k by Monday please? Thanks
well let me tell you that I predicted 16k by the end of the month. 
[deleted]
Well done you predicted a 10% change in either direction on a “currency” that moves on average around 5%+ a day.... hahaha. Watch this I also predict a 10% change in next few days 
Are you being serious? 
But are we still popping, Mr Bubble?
Thats like saying that either Team A or Team B is gonna win. Just stupid.
Guys guys, I found a shorter ( ఠ ͟ʖ ఠ)

Somebody missed the train.
the only need is you to stfu
Thought we were done with this 4k, 5k bottom talk. Last week it was every other comment. The last two days have been quiet.  It was nice. 
How much did you lose with your shitcoins mate?
What the FUD are you talking about?!
Dumbass, looking at the long term chart, we just hit bottom on the 6hr and 1day charts.  This is a bull market.
Lol ur noon now domo is since ur not hodling
The **last** thing a FUD like you should be doing is looking at a long term chart - heh.

You doubt incorrectly - match what matches. If it doesn't match, it doesn't trade
Maker/taker fees?

Did the math for you, it's almost 300 bucks to buy 16 btc at the sellers price, that's why. (Gdax, 0.25% fee)
Where would you draw the line? 
That’s how markets work, bro.  That’s how movement occurs.  It’s a constant back and forth push between people trying to buy at one price and sell $20 higher.  The wave builds on one side and retreats on the other then builds and retreats.  All day long.  When equilibrium is reached, tension builds until somebody gives.  Then everybody panics, buys or sells at whatever price they can get, and then the whole process starts at a new price point.
There are a certainly a lot of coloured lines and arrows all over the place.

Where is the one that predicts a 1000 USD increase in price within 30 minutes?

It is Roger Ver's Btrash wallet.
Dude, short sellers bring liquidity into the market.  No doubt we can argue that they are the bad guys rooting for a lower price but as proven, they can be wrong and get rekked.

As long as there's trade, whether long or short, will involve a buyer and seller and money flows through BTC.  That is what is good for the market unless you want to see it stagnant.
Bitcoin is a commodity, Its doesnt have the acceptance to really be called a currency because most of the bitcoin transacted consists of buying and selling on exchanges.

When the majority of transactions represent people exchanging BTC for goods and services, it'll be a currency.

Until then, its a game, and a very risky one. There is no cheating because anything goes. Accept that and treat it like any high risk investment, then be twice as cautious because crypto is a whole new thing.

Or be an idiot, think you know where the market is going, and help the smart investors out there get rich.
Just took a small short for a small profit at target right under 8k. Wish me luck! :)

My theory is that some London investment traders are going long into Bitcoin and hitting the buy button right before goong to lunch break.
You're considering selling at the start of what *might* be a market reversal? I know we need to go a bit further and hold these prices for any kind of confirmation but that's still ballsy. Good luck sir is all I can say. 
It's natural to go down a little after a sharp rise. Don't you see the bull flag forming?

I'm usually more nervous when the price goes slowly up. Normally that means an incoming dump.
Don't be silly - of course it will go down at some point.  It is the extent that matters.

Do you expect it to go up endlessly and monotonously?

It will be 12k by Monday.
Relax, holy shit..
It's pinned bro
Well this is fucking disappointing
Happening now.
You called it. I like you.
I think you mean bull trap. 
Short term moving averages and long term moving averages.
lol

"redditor for 10 minutes"
Says the guy on the bitcoin reddit page
That would be the bull flag target. Yes. But I have my doubts...
I don’t think this pump is over either.  Should be a long day.

You would do better begging for money on any subreddit that isn't this one.

You naively think that bitcoin subreddit readers have bitcoin, so they're likely to give you some. If they were likely to give it away freely, they wouldn't have any to give you.
PSA: This is incredibly straining on the heart.
It's ready.
Year to date? 
I'm pissed already.  hic.
holy cow, this is huge no matter if it dumps again
Where did you see 3k btc were bought? 
For fucks sake
**Deathbed conversion**

A deathbed conversion is the adoption of a particular religious faith shortly before dying. Making a conversion on one's deathbed may reflect an immediate change of belief, a desire to formalize longer-term beliefs, or a desire to complete a process of conversion already underway. Claims of the deathbed conversion of famous or influential figures have also been used in history as rhetorical devices.

"Pump" in the crypto world tends to be used to describe situations where a coin rises in value suddenly, which is what it is. A $1,000 rise in value within an hour? Don't tell me that's organic.


Totally agree, I prefer to go with the positive Bitcoin.  
>I look at this like sports betting.  Those shorters... they're betting against Team Bitcoin.  

Football team mentality isn't really conducive to a good investing mentality.  

> They were rooting for the bad guy.  

I'll never understand this sentiment here. What law out there states Bitcoin always has to rise? How is this any different from simply betting on a thunderstorm?  

Sweet Jesus the Bitcoin permabull sentiment reeks in this sub.  




Think of it like horse race betting. If you want to win anything by betting on one horse, someone has to bet against you or in this analogy, another horse. Your win is someone else's loss and vice versa. Just as it's illegal to rig and throw games, it's illegal to wash trade (albeit tough to detect and catch) which is what some of us believe is happening. My friend's gears get grinded when I compare margin trading to gambling, but it's as close as you'll get in the crypto world!  

There's suspicion that one or more whales saw short positions at recent highs and saw the opportunity to go long instead on Bitfinex and essentially wipe out the shorters, i.e. take their money.
How much did you lose mate?

(Appeal for meme.)
No way.  I'd give that a 5% probability based upon the data.
No way. In fact, I give that like a 1%. What data are you looking at lol. 
Naw my dude. The next crash is gonna be in June. And it's not even gonna reach the Feb bottom. A lot of stuff happening in May for Crypto causing it to rise and then correct itself.
The original Japanese is 8k and we'll hit 9k this weekend.
This is why I come here, for the intellectual stimulation.

Lambo mango.
You don't understand irony, do you?

Never mind, your comment good for Bitcoin.
you mean like a vision?
Good choice, you smashed it earlier
Battleship coin? How many battleships you've got? I have 5 battleship 
It's good for Bitcoin, that they don't.
Feels so good to be bad 😏
And yet they did enter a short position a the low point.
Omg you’re back? God help us 
9k vegeta is legendary. No need to come up with new 9k memes.
Good, I am not trying to give up my kids anyways lol but it would be nice tho ahha
[deleted]
Did you read that on a Chappi ? If they all jump up and down at the same time they'll move the earth ? 
If we get over 8k again tonight the fomo will really kick in.  Will be fun to watch 
If you're talking about me, you're mistaken.

I didn't even get any free bcash from the hardfork, because their shitty software doesn't support multisig wallets.

Also not bitter, and I don't know why you would think so from someone disliking begging / conjecture.

How can you be so certain?
Good explanation. To add onto it for clarity, at some point, all 21 million bitcoin will be mined and the only reward to be shared will be transaction fees for on chain transactions. This will drop the number of miners drastically as the rewards for mining will have dropped drastically and a "sweet spot" of no. of miners vs rewards will be reached. 

Someone with more knowledge on the matter please correct me if I'm wrong there
Nope.  I wrote

> Don't sell under 8.17

and that is still good advice.

Sorry I was out by 2%

Not bad as I called this hours ago.

And it will destroy the market once again. Or China is back in and we normies don't know it yet, or this is some sick manipulation.
Won’t happen until the short term moving average crosses the long term on the 6hr chart.
How do you know that's the source? (genuinely curious)
This was predicted yesterday on coindesk. 
Those were the days
Feels like a year ago.
Let's see what it's like at noon. Still early to call a breakout, but if that is what we are seeing, this will be a hell of a day on the floor.
He means the last 30 minutes after the small dip.  8k to 7.6k now at 7.7k
LOL
Lmao!!!
I don't have the numbers, but seeing how that price got barely crested by some exchanges and the market contracted hours after - not so many. A lot was probably automated too.
no, there was a 250btc wall a few minutes ago on the BTC/USD pair.. which didnt last long
We need to keep charging!  :)
So like, $3
I went to a shrink to analyze my dreams
Both, sir 
I am pretty sure OMG will go lower in the future. Buy low sell high cant worry about anything you dont have no control over.

Ya must be hodlers lol. Im a buy low sell high guy. But seeing the charts shoot up was crazy.

I thought it was just "y'alright?"
We are getting more Americanised these days, we say 'Hey' a lot now as well.
That's not how capital gains taxes work, hence being called capital *gains*. It's a tax of the profit, not the sum. Sigh
Yes.
So at 6:55am everyone was like, I need Bitcoin?
Are they rappers?
No, what is that? Some pokeman game or something?
Out of all answers, this is the most irrelevant.
So if I was a whale, I could sell to myself at an inflated rate and create an increase in value. Since all these transactions are anonymous, I could create a huge profit for myself by pumping and dumping over and over.    

🤔.  
I bet some people do

haha. And we dont want to see that.

Yeah it just got confirmed within the last hour. it was showing 20% confidence and no confirmations after six hours but I guess whatever happened happened and it's good now.  Thanks!

I forgot to add that Romania is also an "unsupported country"
Just watch and wait.
We just getting started. No turning back. Full thrusters 
No.  It will go beyond 8k, then to 8.2k - be patient.  It might take 2 hours.
As long as the short term moving average is above the long term moving average on the 6 hour chart, every dip you see will recover to the level it was previously at.
Are you serious? Shorters are one of the main reasons why the price went down so deep. This is a free market, and they can do what they want. But they won't get my compassion when they get rekt.

Hopefully, they will now think twice before shorting. This should make the price a bit more stable in the future.
Fair enough. I'm more speaking to the people who come on here announcing their short positions and troll holders every time btc dumps. No doubt a lot of people just got burned

I hope it keeps going up good luck to you all I made a profit I was happy with
Yep, yesterday the coindesk regular said that a $1000 move was possible, although he said in either direction, thankfully it was up :) 
Because of the time in the states people are sleeping. When they wake up FOMO....hopefully
It was a bull-run joke, Mark
BITCONEEEEEEEEEECT?! :')
The tried and true method 
Hahaha. 
I’m either selling when it goes up or just holding it, worst part is I’ve done this before. Some people (me) never learn
Same here man, I feel you. So I would not just blindly rush in with the hype again!
People are also saying it will never reach $20K again.  

You’re crazy if you think we can’t continue dropping
We dont know that we hope it doesnt. lol

No matter what, there will always be that single guy who was fucking sleeping when everyone was buying and he missed the dip. Now that guy is on reddit sitting on a pile of hope. 
It will be below 6k in a week.

Actually I literally just received my deposit haha. About 3 hours too late.

Thanks for the response I appreciate it.  I currently use armory and for a non techy like me was damn difficult.   I thought electrum was the very similar.  I don't think the kid I'm trying to help has the skills or the spare computers for an offline machine.  He asked me how to buy 10 or 20 quids worth a week so I tried to explain it.  I realised due to his age he's limited to a bitcoin atm.  I hoping it may open his mind a bit and help him save.  I wish I did at that age!  I thought the risk for a few 100 quid at the end of the year a XAPO wallet would suffice.  He can buy at the atm and vault it from his phone. Too young though.  Are there any decent services like XAPO?
 Have to be 18 to have though.
We were getting manipulated downwards too, don't be offensive on the forums because you didn't buy in. 
Hostile response much. What would your mother think of you speaking like that?
I feel that green dildo 
Ok thanks
Don’t have to buy when you never stop buying.
You're on the wrong side of a steam train mate.


BAD ADVICE!!! Im sorry but that is esentially day trading and unless you do it professionally like 40 hours a week or get lucky, you are going to lose in the end.


No!  You are supposed to buy high and help all of us.
This is really great advice, thank you so much!
More than a year. With someting as volatile as crypto, any money invested should be money you can go at least 5 years without IMO.
Yeah but whats the general baseline for the last month or so?
Female here, what does this mean?

No reason?

Haha, very funny.
Its afternoon in Asia. You know Asians are more productive after the mid-day nap. 
Yeah in Syria, fuck Assad, go Donald
Did $1000 yesterday. Lots of momentum. 
I'm not even worried about $9k, going to go like it's not even there, but $12k is another story entirely. Pretty important we get through there. 
I'm talking volume not price. 
LOL, volume meaningless - sure about that?
Then I'm better of paying with the banking apps because no fees and no worries. The only thing that would beat the banking apps would be to time the market between the purchase of the BTC and the purchase of the Pizza in BTC, but there are fees associated to buying a small amount of BTC with a service like coinbase if I'm not using the BTC coming from my Nicehash payement. At the moment, I just cannot use BTC as easily as my Euro.
This is a market swing on the 6hr chart.  Seeing that coming is why Soros decided to buy in when he did (presuming he did buy in), but the swing was going to happen with or without him.
His dogs and pet snakes also. ( = banker's buddies)
A niggas not allowed to change his mind?
You still work ? Should have sold at 20k...!
This tool wasnt active for 2 weeks and now he talks shit after huge spike. You missed the bottom, cya.

A true expert 
I was just thinking that.  I have Alzheimer's.
That's a lot of alot
Isit? 

Sorry, arethey?
For the past couple of weeks, I’ve been calling every jump about a day or two in advance, and nobody believes it’s possible to understand the charts and see upticks coming before they arrive.
Ahh i see, fees were unfactored. But I still don't get something. If the 17BTC is traded, whether @ $7730 or $7729.99 the actual difference is a gain/loss of $0.01x17 on either (alternate) side isn't it? 

In essence, compared to the $328.5 fees which'll be paid anyway, that extra $0.17 will be just like the first line of a really good novel, compared to the rest of the text.
Wait, so you don't understand trend lines yet you'll tell everyone what your predictions are? Based on what?
there is no fields to complete? i mean they don't tell me to do so, just give me a backup phrase for login to the wallet  in another device, and also i am unable to get the bitcoin . com wallet ?  i have a bitcoin.com wallet and i got there some bitcoin but  after deposit i can't withdraw those BTC , in sent section there is no sent button and when it says put you amount i click the number to put amount but it is not happening please help me i need you help. how can i transfer those btc ?  
Dude, shorters increase the volatility of the market. 

Yes, I'd prefer it to be stagnant when compared to highly volitile. How can we expect any merchants to accept Bitcoin in their shops if the price is so unstable?

I'm not generally against shorters, they provide a necessary corrective. But the gamblers can stay away. Hopefully they got burned enough to be more careful in the future.
They can go to casino and play black or red its the same. 

Hope you did a snort before that short.

extremely rough estimate based on depthchart. for it to move that far someone must have bought a shit ton. i didnt actually see 3k. sorry for my outlandish speculation. 
Can I buy paleo or should I wait it out till the next swing 
Thanks man, much appreciated! 
Why not organic?

If there are thousands of people at the point of buying, and they see movement, you don't need whales to explain that.

The volumes had, until that point, been so small, that even my own portfolio could have moved the price slightly.

Don't seek conspiracies everywhere is my message.  Because you will always find one.


"organic" is such a misused word around here. 

Sometimes the value fluctuates in extremes, because there are lots of bots involved and they all listen to the same indicators.

That is not necessarily a bad thing. It's just the way it is.

Of course, when it goes down, I will cry "manipulation" with all of you. lol!
> Sweet Jesus the Bitcoin permabull sentiment reeks in this sub.  

It's not that I'm a permabull, in fact I am pretty bearish right now. I wouldn't buy today. 

I am an enthusiast. We are building the revolution here. Lots of people are in this for the money. I'm not.

People who short Bitcoin on margin are rooting for that revolution's failure in exchange for some material wealth. I'm just not a fan of that type of person.


Well it's a Bitcoin sub... many of us actually believe in and want Bitcoin to succeed regardless of day to day price movements.
By nature, shorting is less ethical because you bet on failure.
Ok ... but to trade 40,000 BTCs to wipe out 15,000 short?

Unless you are suggesting that the 40,000 are not real (wash traded) and the intent is to get the shorts to cover their 15,000 for real?
I’m new to the terminology so please explain in layman’s terms, “One or more whales saw short positions at recent highs and saw the opportunity to go long instead, and essentially wipe out the shorters, I.e. take their money.” I tried to short bitcoin and missed my order by $78 dollars. I lost my bitcoin but still have all my cash. Please summarize, is bitcoin going back down again???
There are Vegeta memes for 8k and 9k.
Moony woony. 
No, I mean I read the 6hr chart reaching the bottom and threw all in.
Yep.  Even this misunderstanding is good for Bitcoin.  

Which supports the original hypothesis.

I have to admit to a degree of cognitive dissonance setting in here, so I'm popping over to r/btc for the immersion cure.
Someone posted to me angrily saying we should grow up with our Lambos, to the Moon etc.

He couldn't see any irony in the r/Bitcoin DD posts.

Well of course there isn't.  It is all entirely serious.  

Which is good for Bitcoin.
A few may have, but I would guess not many at or below 6650.
I'll eat your bollox if it do baby boo
No, but of course it isn't true.  But I thought it was funny.

Mass Earth: 6 x 10^24 kg

Pop Earth: 8 x 10^9

Mass of all humans (about 70kg?) 6 x 10^11

Which software? - you could still claim your Btrash you know.
Taurus is entering Uranus.
I spent two days watching the 1m 5m 15m 1h charts and it clicked.  The market oscillates at different frequencies and amplitudes. 20-40 point swings on the 1m chart, 40-100 point swings on the 5m chart, 100-300point swings on the 15 minute chart, 300-500point swings on the 1h chart, 1000-? point swings on the 6h chart.  Whether it swings up or down is dependent on the moving averages on each chart.  On GDax for example the averages are on 12 and 26 point intervals. If the short term moving average on the 1m chart is above the long term then it will push the average higher on the 5m chart.  As long as the short term on the 5m chart is above the long term, the 1 min will rise and dip, almost always recovering, until the moving averages catch up with each other on the 5m chart.  Then the 5m may oscillate back up or jump down.  If it goes down, but the short term moving average remains above the long term on the 15m chart it will recover.  However, if the 5m dive pushes the short term below the long term on the 15m chart it will cause a bigger dive.  Then what happens on the 1 hr chart becomes important because if the short term moving average is above the long term there, the 15m cycle will recover and swing up again.  All the charts interact with each other, and since I figured this out, I’ve predicted every jump and dip (on the 1hr and 6hr charts) and the amplitude of the jumps and dips within a day of them happening.  I think of it as similar to the function of electron orbitals.
You’re on r/bitcoin. What exactly do you expect to hear besides moon, pretty ponies, unicorns and rainbows as far as “predictions” go?
Alternatively, mining will become more about maintaining security in the underlying bitcoin protocol, and profitable to businesses not simply for the mining rewards, but for securing their layer 2 businesses etc.
It’s entirely possible that the sweet spot will be more than the current hash rate. Depending on number of transactions and capacity when that time comes 100 years from now. 
> I you sell below 8.17, you will have trouble getting back in.

It's..... 8.06
what if someone sold at 8.16 and now can buy at 8.06 lol no trouble there

I told you that it was pretty darn specific.
This is traders responding to market cues.  Absolutely not manipulation.
Do you have a source? I searched but couldn't find it.
Ok.
Bit more than that. 
higher than bat pussy
Lol ... is that where you set your buy?  :)
That too.
Yes, I misspoke. I was assuming a rather low cost basis where selling one's position would realize a gain enough that the capital gains taxes may not be covered by the single day 10% gain. I was writing from my own perspective.

I agree, if someone bought two days ago and sold today they would still see a nice profit even with a short term capital gains tax.

Hopefully, I can hang onto Bitcoin until after there is some sort of capital gains exemption legislation.
Thanks. I guess the call to either buy or sell here is obvious.
Big buy order, short squeeze. Nothing special about that, and time plays no role either since trading is worldwide.
You know what's most relevant for price? Supply and demand, the dynamic duo of crypto.
I wasn't serious.
I mean I was gonna say thanks for the price jump the last 24 hours Amigos but nvm. Phuck U Too!
we're gonna build a buy wall and you're gonna pay for it

Everyone here thinks every trade is a manipulation. You know what, sometimes people just buy shit. 
who care I am rich
Well, you asked...
True. And it's definitely nice to see it saying buy for a change. No doubt.
Cool story bro
Yep, interested to know what the answer is. I should think the answer is yes you can trade from Russia as if you're in the US. 
I don't disagree with you, just saying dang, if you got a crystal ball to know the exact number like that, gimme Lambo too!
Shorting does not magically push the market price down and most positions are settled in cash instead of actual Bitcoins. So unless you go short and have a ton of Bitcoins to dump, you're not really doing anything for the market price.
Shorters is peoples to guys, come on.

Also, I like making pun of peoples usernames *rimshot*
No doubt. I was actually watching that spike in a self-made chart view that shows me single trades from kraken as dots, one dot per trade. Well kraken spiked up to 8500. I saw huge liquidations happening as spikes of simultaneous trades covering about .25% to .5% of the asks in the order book each spike, and even more. Some spikes could be huge long positions being opened as well, but I doubt that between 8000 and 8500, in that range it should have been mostly shorts closing and liquidations. 

Heh.  Genius!
Also looks like a syringe, let’s call it that!

Damn, I'm spending too much time on this.
Ok, little kid.
go USA . gooo
hehe
you might as well just get out at or above where you just bought it and wait for it to go down, you can def get in cheaper
Nothing is impossible.  But I think the likelihood of a significant dip is as likely as you making your money back.
Lube on the way, enjoy dear friend
Well if you are talking about buying you are to late. This is the time to hodl and sell.
Lol .... seldom but yes for this time.

And it's still 7.8 ... phew
OK!!!
? Asking someone to wait till this price cools down or buy in dips to dca is bad advise?

What are you talking about mate?

Seem to be rising since Feb and at 40k+ yesterday, was at ATH before it crashed.
Great.  So use your random thoughts and emotions to answer please.

You may need to light a few candles and have a bath first - but no rush.
Assad himself will be fine and in a bunker, because the orange one childishly tweeted his intentions: 'they will be coming, nice and new and "smart."'
Did $1000 because the 6hr chart bottomed out and traders responded to the cue.  Won’t have another jump like that without another cue (crossover on the 1d chart).
[deleted]
Well, yeah. From you initial post I got the impression you just wanted to use bitcoin. Btw. you can buy bitcoin without fees on gdax.
Yes and no, we can only speculate, for sure it wasn't Mother Teresa
I did, didn’t everyone here?
He might be right, I don't trust this sudden spike at all... 
Ask a woman, they understand random shit.

No idea what you're getting at. The person to take the order will have to pay the fee. If you sell for that 1 cent less, you lose the 17 cents + 300 buks on fees, because you are the taker. The maker in this case, aka the buyer, doesnt pay fees.
Ouch :)
Don't you want the money flowing through here instead of the casinos?

Umm not sure if I should break this news while you being happy about this rally

We just touched a very strong downtrend line. It's at $7900 at the moment. This will be a hard nut to crack...
I gotchu fam. Check your BTC wallet.
Ohh you said "pup's" I was like thats alot of bitcoins.
Most of the volume was 1-200 a min for about an hour. Started with about 700 in the first 3 minutes. 

Diying down now. 
All indicators right now indicate it should keep going up for a bit, but it’s never a guarantee.  I think it will swing down again, but not until the moving averages cross on the 1day chart, which could be a very long time.  Look up moving average crossover trading strategies.  I’m still all in at this point.

When did I say it was only a whale orchestrating this? How do you think liquidated shorts work? A whale pumps Bitcoin, induces those thousands you speak of to FOMO back into Bitcoin, then dumps. It's the dump that I would wait for before buying back in. 


I don't see all price pumps and dumps as products of manipulation. If that's what you think I'm arguing, I'm not. But for a $1,000 pump in under an hour as shorts are at their peak? There's a juicy opportunity for a whale to go long on Bitfinex through wash trading. 
>It's not that I'm a permabull, in fact I am pretty bearish right now. I wouldn't buy today.

>I am an enthusiast. We are building the revolution here. Lots of people are in this for the money. I'm not.  

Bitcoin will find its place as an alternative currency price tanks and bulls be damned. In fact, it's when a coin moons suddenly and bit too long with NO pullback for an extended time I get worried.  


> People who short Bitcoin on margin are rooting for that revolution's failure in exchange for some material wealth. I'm just not a fan of that type of person.

I just view it as glorified gambling and nothing. I have neither the balls nor the wizardly TA for it.  
I can understand wanting it to succeed, but most successful investors are going to be those who accept the bulls *and* the bears for what they are and not view any bets on Bitcoin bearish as rooting for the bad guys. There's no team. The real enemy of Bitcoin really is the threat of irrelevance. If Bitcoin can gain mass adoption, we'll certainly all be riding the gravey train.   

That being said, things are looking better for Bitcoin and the crypto markets as a whole. I'm just not ready to make any trades based on any assumption that this is the turnaround. I may buy back on the next pullback, but we'll see.
What law of ethics would that be? And since when is Bitcoin losing value even temporarily a sign of "failure?" To borrow the sports team analogy used by another earlier, is betting on a team losing unethical?  

Would the solution be to end all sports team losses and make participation trophies the norm?  


A fair point.  It does have the sense of being unethical.

But in 'betting upon failure', you may well free up financial resources to invest in something more valuable and ultimately successful.
Is taking profits in anticipation of a pullback also unethical?  The net effect is similar.

What about miners shorting BTC in order to lock in their future profits?

Having differing market views, and expressing them, doesn't strike me as unethical or less ethical.  In fact, I respect short-sellers more than the ignorant FUD-spreading nocoiners who don't even have the balls to put their money on the line.
Capitalism and ethics? Come on. 
don't feed the troll, look at his comment history.  Salty that he got liquidated, get rekt.
Oh? The only one I was aware of is the OVER 9000 one.

One should never trust what you read on a bubble gum wrapper. 
I thought that the expression “move the earth” meant “move the dirt,” not “move the world.”

If so, the real question is whether 6x10^11 is enough to start an earthquake.  Given that the Seahawks fans shake their stadium enough to show up on seismographs, I am certain that the entire worlds population jumping up and down on a single tectonic plate in Asia would cause an earthquake, and depending where they jumped, possibly a tsunami or a volcanic eruption.

Tectonic plates are floating on a molten sea.  We are all standing on the rough equivalent of a cherry pie’s top crust.  If enough people jump on one spot, it’s like a knife cutting through the crust.  Ergo moving the earth.
Perhaps eventually I will. Then I can flip it for real bitcoin if there are any suckers left.


At the time my googling said bcash didn't allow recovery of funds from multisig wallets.

For now I can honestly say, "Bcash? I wouldn't take it if it was free!"
You are definitely on to something here.  Too bad I didn’t see your comment until just now. 
Sometimes intelligent analysis is welcome. 
You're worried about 100 dollars?
Doubt it.

[deleted]
Yeah, if it breaks that then I'll go long for a while.
I just mean it's irrelevant because it doesn't explain anything. Supply and demand are always acting forces in capitalism. Unfortunately they're unsatisfactory answers to explain anything beyond that.
No doubt.  But $300m in less than an hour, just when shorts are peaking is well, .... hard to believe it's unintentional.  Not complaining though.  

Also noticed that the volume is picking up after the peak.  Maybe it's my turn to get melted :P
agreed.
Heh

Or it could go up, who knows 
Depends on if you're doing dollar cost averaging.
Good luck. I gave you advance notice, don't want to hear, must feel. 
Ah, yes. But first, Bitcoin needs to double in price so I can order my lambo bathtub.
You greatly underestimate the force of the FOMO crowd, the masses are coming...
Just total volume, buying and selling.

I legit sold some at $19500. Only .1, but I still sold some :)
Being doubtful is good. Spreading fud on nothing isnt.
Its not random you just dont know all the factors involved.
Thx.  I feel more confident now.  This is like a safe space.

Muchado about no thing
Thankyou ped-ant
Oh so the person on the lower end of the trade pays the fees? I don't trade myself so I've no idea. What happens if both trade for the exact same price? Does it charge both the 300? Or split it? 
He's euphoric
why did it have to jump 1k in a fucking second :'(
Bitcoin be finish if dump, ooga booga.
Thanks paleo
Claiming this is a pump and dump is to short sighted. This happens in low volume trading, big up or down swings. There is not much resistant amongst the bears, they are exhausted after months of dumping. The price will always follow the path of  least resistance. 
Well you did write:

> I'm going to remain skeptical until we know for sure this isn't market manipulation

I was merely pointing out that you don't need conspiracy theories to explain every market move.




Well what I'm saying is that a lot of us aren't active/day traders. We're hodling and rooting for Bitcoin to succeed. :)
No.  You also need to consider the pressure.  A human can only occupy around 1 sq meter.  The impact of jumping up and down in that area has bugger-all effect.  Multiply that non effect over a large area, and you have a non effect over a very large area :)
Well yea.... if your gonna b that specific.... it beats the whole purpose.... You just set yourself up to be wrong. You could have just been like everyone else and said 8.2 lol
Ok bud, I went all in two days ago and made thousands today, but you go on doubting it.
Okay, that was more of a "it could go up or down" post to me.
Enough to buy beer for a year. That is what life is all about after all. Beer. 
It explains price movements. It's not meant to explain anything beyond that.
You answered your own question. ATH shorts = good opportunity for a short squeeze. Price goes up, forces shorters to cover their losses, further driving the price up due to the subsequent increased buying pressure.
What kind of bot is this? Read my message, I don't need support.
it wasn't going to go up further man
I'm feeling it bro ....
You could be right.
Google 'hidden variables'  

Heh.
I'll laugh when the price drops again, but until then I'll let you have your temporary moment. Enjoy
I'm 45. But I like books.
Ha hah - 
Thats the 1 cent difference you mentioned. If there is a sell order for 8k, you can't buy for 8k without paying the fees. You place an order for 7999.99 and wait till someone sells it to you.
I know. I had my limit sell at 7180 and got rekt as it soared past it. I thought I was being smart too when I set that last night since it was the upper bound range.  Damn 
Mongo only pawn in game of life
I should say, I think there will be small dips on the way up that should all recover to previous levels until the 1day chart sees the short term average cross down over the long term.  That can happen very suddenly though.  
It's not a mere conspiracy theory if the opportunity and motive are there for wash trades to fuel longs.  


Look. I'm hopeful for Bitcoin's success as much as anyone. But the timing of the sudden spike to coincide with shorts at recent highs was just way too coincidental. If you think this is part of a trend toward sustained growth we'll see all of this week and next, feel free to buy in.  

Just note that if this is just another fakeout designed to induce fomo, it won't have been the first. 
I don't mind being a little wrong.  I'll take the flak.   :)
I went all in two years ago. Does it matter?
It said there could be a big break out and there was.  :)
So $10
Thanks for letting us know.  Not a bot, but if you ever do need support you are welcome to contact us this way or through a support ticket.
I think in the long run it will. Oh well
Dang, cutting my losses - closed at 7925.

I will wait it out for next dip.

What happened here?
I refuse to acknowledge yesterday... didn't happen. Totally didn't lose a bunch money. Everythings fine.
Fair enough.
Yes, because I know when to pull it all back out so I don’t lose the gains I make on the upswings.
$10 for a year's beer ? Where the heck do you live mate ? I want to move there. 
true! you just have to decide what you want to do, i make moves in short term with the long term hold as an overarching theme. sometimes you may take losses in short term trades, if you can minimize the losses rather than maximizing you will still come out winning mid term
What dip - there'll be no dip IMO.
So nicely put.
Freakonomics is really interesting.

OK, it is a bit hipster.  But there are some really interesting insights.
Just a bit of a troll who was telling us off for being cheerful.  Who deleted his original post.  So nothing made much sense after that, hence all the deletes. 
No one knows. You would be worlds richest man. Congratz.
Was obviously joking, but brewing your own, you could probably do a year’s worth for <$50.  Depending on ones level of alcoholism...
Yeah I know what you mean. I’ve reached my goal of how much BTC I want so I’m thinking about just forgetting about it and checking back in a long while, for my mental health lol
Nothings for certain here bro.

Crazy stuff happens.  $350 down in minutes, $1,000 up in less than half hour.
[deleted]
Perhaps I will be.  Perhaps nobody else knows.  I figured it out watching the charts nonstop for two days, and it clicked.
Give it up mate. There's no further shorts to be had. You're farting against thunder.
