BTC needs to stop tickling 9k's balls and do something
High Bitcoin ATM fees are the largest barrier to wider Bitcoin adoption. Most Bitcoin ATMs are selling bitcoins with a 20 to 30 percent fee. PBS did a segment the other day on Bitcoin and a reporter put 20 dollars into a Bitcoin-ATM and only got 13 dollars worth of Bitcoin. This is a PR nightmare in the making. We should not be defending this behavior with free market arguments we should be boycotting these ATM operators. Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APIyzN6f_Lg&feature=youtu.be&t=2093
These bears need to fuck off already. How many times are we going to play ping pong with 9k? Die motherfuckas
Another day of Bitcoin slipping her panties off, then putting them back on again.
perhaps this Bcash pump is going to flow into BTC.  whoever is pumping it is using it as a way to get money into crypto without making BTC sky rocket but eventually it will flip over.  Or there is some insider info going on and the 32MB block increase is popular?  Outside of Traders who are just looking for make a quick buck, I've never talked to anybody who is pro-bcash.  Sorry to even bring this up here - just looking for opinions
We are one small pump away from getting out of this bear market, needs to hit 9300

This 9k$ resistance is ridiculous. 
Big battle taking place right now!
9k is the real resistance test
Reminder: we hit 'bottom' back on Feb 5th which was nearly 3 months ago. Onward and Upward! 
I'm back home from work. 

As far as I'm concerned, the bull run can start now, so I'll have some evening entertainment...
well looks like bitcoin broke 9k lol
Wow we’re flying now.  Maybe 10k by weekend?   This is the bitcoin I like to remember 
I am the first one :-) 
Looks like btc is taking a deep breath before the next attempt to break through 9k...

C'monnnnnn bull run!
Bear market seems to be dead. Gotta love it!
Yes! We did it ladies and gentlemen!
its happening lol
It's 2am here, let me sleep!  
<pours coffee>
IST OVA NEIN THOUSAND!!! Schnell!!!
Good morning!
**Support The Bulls.**
Please let me wake up to 9.2k 
I think thus slow increase is beter than the mad rush of December. Less excitement but more sustainable in the long run. You know, dicks being safe and all that, even at this slower rate
Good morning, New York.
Hi, I’m relatively new to crypto and had a question directed to the bitcoin community and would like to hear others’ thoughts. 

If Bitcoin prices were to moon (astronomically), do you think alts in general would moon with it? Or do you believe that Bitcoin might stand alone at the top and all of our trading and hodling should be directed towards getting more BTC? I feel like the only time I get more BTC is to trade into alts although I know I should add more to my profile. Thanks for your opinions in advance. I’d like to hear from this community!
That tease @ 830am EST
Sideways trading folks. This is a Salamander market
(Don’t they walk sideways)
Its been an interesting weekend, wasent expecting such resistance for 9k but i was surprised that we didnt have massive dips after each test
What a battle! I think we will see 9.1k within the next 24 hours. 
is bitcoin wallet same address can be useful for many time transaction please help me .....
Wallet... where do you keep your coins... always on exchanges or got a private key wallet.. im kind of new at btc.. so let me hear what wallets you use...
Hi!

I've been following r/coinbase for a while now, and there seems to be a lot of issues with them by users. I currently have Coinbase but have not encountered any issues.

I'd like to buy a bitcoin or two at this time (which I'll need to do in increments), but now I'm debating if Coinbase is the right platform for purchasing? Is there an objectively "good" platform for purchasing Bitcoin?
[deleted]
**Come On Bulls, don't throw this away!** 
another underwhelming day, we’re getting there though 
Asia contingent about to get going. About to get that 9k, but then right back down to 8950.

I may throw some bones at Bcash for this pump about to start
Bears need to pull their sells right now, selling too cheap
Another battering ram to 9k
here we goo
damnnnnn
I was getting worried for a minute, Here we go boys
Be prepared for a slight pullback guys. dont panic
I could get used to this.

My "break even" is at 9900. This will be a big moment for me.
I got into crypto so I could buy a sweet car. Now that I have enough I can't get myself to pull the trigger for fear of what my portfolio might be worth in 5 years. I struggle trying to decide. 
l0l why are ppl buying bcash? A hard fork will still makes it trash.
today is the dayy 
Suddenly less ass holes saying "I'll see you guys when it hits 2k"
[deleted]
5.40am West Coast time, I think we need to wait until it's around 9am there for us to get through $9k.
[deleted]
hole in the ichimoku cloud right now

break through please
How do I open a channel for eclair mainnet app? I want to buy something from Blockstream
We see some high spread spikes on GDAX for most currencies today. Coupled with quite high volumes that is a sign of heavy live/day trading. Had some success/luck at it today with a nice +3%. However it looks like Vegeta is going away so I will stay on the side until market tension is resolved. Easy to get burned in these situations.
Just moved my stop sell up by $400... Nice.
Just out of interest, what are people setting their stop loss at?
What was ATL bitcoin dominance? Is it now? 
... and we are back in the "comfort zone".
Let’s actually friggin go bois



Also why is this unstickied
This climb up again from 8.90k to 9.18k from 5 min chart,  In 1 min chart I think this is by wave.
Good morning Asia:)
We moon now?
Where are you all today?  Nice work folks while I was asleep.  Cheers. 
**Bitcoin Price Climbs to 40-Day High Above $9,200**

https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-climbs-40-day-high-9200/

Bitcoin's price climbed above $9,200 on Tuesday to hit a 40-day high, according to data from CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).

Following a steady increase over the past week, the price of world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization jumped above $9,000 soon after the morning trading session began around 00:30 UTC, after which it continued to climb up to as high as $9,220.97 at around 2:00 UTC.

The price is at its highest point since March 14, when bitcoin dropped $800 within one trading day to reach a one-month low around $8,000. Following the plunge, the cryptocurrency's price declined to as low as $6,593 on March 30, reflecting what is now a 39% gain since that market bottom.
What time is the pump happening?
**Come On Bulls.**
**Show us you mean business Bulls and we will follow.**
[deleted]
Not really expecting a lot right now. Last Friday was my first paycheck after Tax day and I went all in, as did many others in the US. I expect some selling off until the next pay day Friday.

Japan and Korea ain’t shite they won’t be driving this price up anytime soon this afternoons 
[deleted]
Heading down to 8825 for everybody who still wants to get in to jump in.

**Could be THE ASIA PUSH!**
Volume is picking up...
I'm hoping that when the American markets get going properly today that volume will increase markedly and we finally get over $9k and stay over.
I'm looking at Bitcoin ticker and that's exactly what it's doing!
I agree, total rip off and overall it's bad for the market. 
So buy a Bitcoin ATM and charge 7% ... you'd make a fortune, right? 
Worse than a one armed bandit
Hmm, the only thing worse than high fees on ATMs is no ATMs at all. Which is really worse for adoption?
Each time it touches 9k that's another bunch of sell orders taken out of the system.  Soon they'll all be gone an we'll break through on the way to 10k.
He's a lumberjack and he's okay, he works all night and he works all day.

Now let's sing the 'quick drop and then bear-trap bullrun' song.
BTC mistress knows how to tease well.
BTC mistress knows how to tease well.
I’m guessing because of the fork coming up that people are buying. 
No, we need > 11600 to get out of this bear market. But I agree, if this goes higher than 9300, then we might get a new test of 11600 in the short term.
4.12K 4.12K 4.12K 4.12K 4.12K 4.12K 4.12K 4.12K 4.12K 4.12K 4.12K 4.12K 4.12K 
Wait 'til the alts collapse - it will be happy heaven.
"We are the Bitcoin. Resistance is ridiculous."
These past week has been brutal. Bears are not giving way, some big shorts in play.
To break 9k I think we need the services of the one and only Carlos Matos.

Only he can help us.
We're up around 50% from the bottom as well - yet the muppets in here (aka short sellers) still spreading fud about a bear market!
I thought you work at this sub. 
We sure have been tested by fire.
We all agree to hold off until you commented! You seemed like you needed this. ;)
There isn't enough to indicate that we are out of the decline yet man...this could simply be a pit stop. 

But let's not worry about that, let's worry about what color we gonna get our lambos in. :)
Bears can't even break 8800 this is a good sign.
I'd be cautious with the words bear and market. We aint truly out of it untill we reach at least somewhat 13/15k ish.
lol you wish
Good moaning
Good morning. 
Morning!
wake this guy up
Get your ass up!
**WAKEY WAKEY**
Your wish is granted :)
Nd it worked 
Ituitively I would agree with you, BUT a slow increase in price is very often a sign of a fast drop approaching...

That's what I'm afraid of...
33% increase in last 11 days. No mad rush here.
I'm fine with these slow increases but like others have said I am also slightly fearful that it means a drop is coming.  Would be good to see Bitcoin get over $10k this week and then it can slow down. 
I agree, especially with SEC currently considering two ETF items and their main reservation has been price volatility. 
Hard to say, but the crypto market as a whole is quite closely tied in sentiment so _I_ think most alts would see a big boost too, although probably less astronomical.

If bitcoin moons, it could be because of a new 'wave' of adoption for some reason, and I think bitcoin has the big advantage of a very well known brand. I can't imagine my mother in law purchasing some obscure utility token, for example, but maybe bitcoin eventually. Bitcoin is also easier to buy than most alts, which require purchasing bitcoin or one of the other 'big' coins first.

Whether to hold any more BTC obviously depends on your opinions and goals - my personal feeling is that alts are *much* higher risk/reward - much more likely to crash hard, but also more likely to 10x / 100x in a short time period.
It depends. Since most alts are traded on a crypto to crypto basis, with btc pairings accounting for the most volume, a sudden rise in btc would cause a sudden rise in the dollar value of an alt coin/token regardless of its satoshi value. Market sentiment may either agree or disagree with this new valuation and will react accordingly. For example, the market may feel that a certain alt coin/token is now overpriced and will correct its satoshi value to a point by which its dollar value seems more reasonable. Generally speaking though, the better/more unique/more useful the project is the more encouraging its reaction will be to a bullish move in bitcoin, although frankly it's pretty hard to know this until after the fact has occurred hence the Efficient Market Hypothesis.
I think Bitcoin will eventually account for about 30-35% of the total crypto market cap and alts typically follow papa Bitcoin though there have been some exceptions. There are many who believe that the sole purpose of some of the alt-coins is simply to allow the creators of the alt-coin to buy more Bitcoin. 
A few cryptos will rise while most will fail
Salamanders can regrow missing limbs, damaged organs and even brain tissue.

But they don't walk sideways.
Crabs walk sideways.
Wat, no they don't
Your bitcoin wallet address is not expended upon first use. You may continuously transact bitcoin, either through sending or receiving, without needing to generate a new wallet address. Hopefully this helps clear up any confusion.
To answer what you're actually asking, yes you can post it at the top of your blog and ask for donations.
Yes, you can use your wallet address multiple times.  It will not expire.
Don't get paranoid.  I kept several coins for years at blockchain.info.
Trezor
I finally got a Trezor wallet.  It feels so good not having to be paranoid about getting hacked.  
Gdax, yes
[deleted]
I prefer Gemini. You can deposit $500 a day and they advance you the loot until your ach clears their account. You just can't withdraw any balance where the ach hasn't cleared.
I've had no issues with Coinbase and it's easy to use for a newbie. 
Did you see that? A rush of red it looked like a big dump. :(
Do you want me to bring your heart meds?
Literally?
looking good .. shorts starting to snap

Some profit taking going on. 
Congrats. Your time has come.
Ouch, didnt buy more at bottom to average out?
Let it run another month or three, split it. Go buy the car, keep the rest in. Problem solved. 
Buy the car. Follow through on your goal. 
Car baby 
Set your parameters, don’t get greedy. Actual profit is always better than the unknown in my opinion. 
Get the car 
Think. you don't want to waste your gains on a certain loss.
Go and buy the biggest piece of shit you can find, if it gets you from A to B your crypto will allow you to get a beast in a few years
Buy the car, unless it's over ten grand. I can't think of a single reason to spend more than few grand on a car.

It's a hard fork to knowhere - 32Mb blocks, when it can't fill its current blocks.

And all the wallets and exchanges will need to update for its 'self-fork' - but take-up is slow.

I'll never understand Bcash - but if the general public are convinced.

BTC should get off the back foot and promote itself a bit more.
'fewer'
6k here we come lol
15th may
do you mean west coast? it’s 9 on the east coast now 
No and no
Smart.
My coins are in my hardware wallet. Can't "stop loss" that.
$25
Usually just below a major resistance line or half the distance between the buy price and the target price, below the buy price. Ideally both.
https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/

Last chart is a "dominance chart".

Found it by typing "bitcoin dominance chart" into the google searchbox. Google is a great website, you should try it sometime...
so close yet so far

Right. Once the most urgent sell pressure has blown off its steam sufficiently at 8.7k - 9k, the continued climb should be easier. Then 9.2k will be the next major barrier, unless we skip it with a bullrun. If the momentum is positive enough most sellers don't mind to raise their sale prices.
Not yet, give it some time
Not on my charts.

It's 6am in Tokyo...
Not for a long time, because hardly anyone actually uses Bitcoin ATM's. It doesn't make sense to do so for most folks.
Each time it touches 9k that's another bunch of buy orders taken out of the system. Soon they'll all be gone an we'll break through on the way to 6K.
That fork is only the catalyst. The reason people are buying is because of emotions. Many Bitcoin investors are getting impatient and frustrated with Bitcoin remaining stagnant while Bitcoin has repetitively shown gains of 20% everyday. Eventually, when the cryptocurrency market falls again in the new few weeks, Bcash will be the biggest loser. And it could happen exactly around or before the Bitcoin ABC fork being released on May 15th. Thus, I would not encourage anyone to believe to stick with Bcash until the fork is released. That’s purely speculation, you still have to be very cautious. 
> I’m guessing because of the fork coming 

ElI5?
That only makes sense if the fork will produce two coins of value. The old coin will be abandoned. Are they betting that there will be two working strains after the fork?
so I'm assuming that would mean 32MB blocks are something that the big players in this space really want then.  Such as Miners and Coinbase
I'll still call a bear market till we hit new ATH.

Only part time.
Hell yeah we have. 

Heh.

He’s not responding! He must be in a jizz coma.
Like the slow increase during 2017? 
0% in like 30 days or like -30% & +30%
Oh my bad. I thought those fkers had the ability to get up on their back legs and run sideways?

Who does that? Gecko?

Someone Google it I’m waiting
What about wallets like exodus or electrum
Gdax and coinbase are the same thing really.
Cool, thank you!
Makes sense, I can just continue to buy it there. Thank you!
The daily limit is also good for me to trasfer in, because it forces me to dollar cost average

I've never heard of it, thank you!
Behave yourself :)
Yes please!
I *did*. A lot! I started with $15000.
Someone needs a snickers. 
Dude wtf
maybe its maybelline
Agreed.  But in the medium to long term my financial pals agree that speculating in many of these is pure gambling.

No doubt there are profits to be made though.  But it can't last.
6k yes, 2k that's just cynical however I suppose anything can happen.
Thanks.  
Yeah I meant West Coast. 
Thought I was the only one
Thanks. 
Some of those bloated shitcoins with massive market caps make me uneasy. 
[deleted]
Great!
everyday, and i love it
It might be shit to you but a lot of whales no doubt read this forum and it provides them with a bit of motivation.
?  That’s exactly what happened yesterday, right after I posted the comment.
Looks like my comment was pretty much spot on, the Asia push got us past $9k.  
So you’re saying that Bitcoin ATM operators won’t realize profits for the foreseeable future without charging higher fees? Hmmm...
Well let's wait an see who's right.
thanks for reply good points.  
I don't think that's how it works. 

You want it to hit 30k?
is he over 8000, or 9000? I can't remember.
[deleted]
Tbh if you are starting up and have small amounts coinbase might be useful (as much as I hate it because of the fees) just because of how easy it is to use but if you decide you want to invest more definitely go hardware wallet route. I personally started on coinbase Nd moved to binance as my main exchange (when I buy other coins... not a trader more so hodler) and trezor as my wallet as I learnt more about crypto.
Eh, not even close.
we are still up, everything is fine
Hot damn
wow, someone really thought BTC would never go under 15k again lol 
I'm not really saying that will happen. Was just trying to demonstrate that your logic works both ways. You could say the same when it was trying to break 11.7 before and we all know how this ended up.
Don't question his logic...this man is a trading god!
goku is over 9000
If you have <$500 in crypto then I really don't see how spending $60-$100 on a HW wallet is justified.  For most people with investments that small, it's "screw around" money anyway and losing it won't be devastating financially.  And if $500 *is* a life-changing amount of money, why the hell are you investing it in crypto? 

I have less than $500 invested and keep all my coins on desktop wallets.  Yeah it isn't the most secure storage method, but as long as the user has good safety practices it's pretty good. 
Lazily worded, maybe, but pretty close. They are different products from the same company. If you want to buy bitcoin on gdax with fiat, you need to deposit your fiat with coinbase. This is where the majority of the issues/complaints arise, so if the concerns around coinbase are worrying the person asking the question then gdax isn't the answer.


One is a broker, that buys BTC below market price and sells it above market price. The other is an exchange, where you can buy from others without fees. You can deposit directly into GDAX, no 'need' of Coinbase. aka Coinbase = shit, GDAX is pretty good. It's cool if you want to give additional info, but atleast make sure it's correct.
