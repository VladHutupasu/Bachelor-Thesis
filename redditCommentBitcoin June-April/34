damn 10k is tough to reach. hope we have a good week with some good news
Tonight; 8PM EST
Overall a decent weekend! Pretty impressed staying above 9k even though i didnt do much trading. 
I'm ok with this, I get paid friday and was planning on buying $750 more so this allows me to buy cheaper btc. I dont want btc to rise too fast too soon, want to hold as much btc as possible before we head to the moon
Can someone help me with [this issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8f8bkz/comment/dy2meam?st=JGMKMQU9&sh=cf07690ahttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8f8bkz/comment/dy2meam?st=JGMKMQU9&sh=cf07690a)?
I bet there's a simple explaination to this.
HODL THE $9K!!

What are bitcoin fees like at the moment? I haven’t bought any coins in awhile. 
I don't know how to read tea leaves but is higher lows and lower highs indicating a breakout, one way or another?
Buying the dip lol
Bitcoin don't give AF.
Would like to gage the scene after these small dumpies:

Bullish = upvote
Bearish = downvote
This pattern we're busy doing is actually quite bullish. Boring, but bullish. I think we'll break out before mid week.

hodl me
For God sake people this is the same shit that happened last week and it was even s bigger drop than this, we made it out fine. Pretty sure most of these panic posters are just trolls anyways but I just don't want others to panic because of these trolls. We are still hoovering around 9000, we'll be fine, just be like me and see it as a buying opportunity. I have invested over 25k in btc and still want to invest more before we go to the moon, so slow rise is what I'm hoping for anyways.

**Bulls - Keep up the fight.**
It might go up. It might go down. And no, I'm not talking about the Bitcoin price. I'm talking about my weiner. 
10400 10 4 good buddy
Does anyone know what total volume traded is like these days?  As volume is low on GDAX but I'm wondering whether that just means less people are using GDAX and have moved to other exchanges. 
Go Bitcoin!

We need a higher high.
What will the month of May bring us? Curious to hear some legitimate predictions! 
Why did *fake satoshi* try to sign a key.. It would be better to say that I am satoshi but I lost the private keys...
He must have known he would get caught very fast..
Warm up Vegeta
Guna bounce from 9k to the moon
time to rebuild the portfolio ... the April movement gave us a glimpse of how things can stand, which currencies will have the potential for bolder growth. we will keep the balance, calm, we know that this market will grow a lot and that 2018 will still be very positive. do not make hasty decisions. stay calm and make good choices, keep your portfolio. we will still have many oscillations until September and then we will see rapid growth.
Here's my prediction for the month of May:

We are going to see institutional money come into the crypto space as well as millionaires. We can expect this around the 2nd-3rd week of May especially due to the consensus taking place in New York.

Little drop shook out some weak hands. Who sold like a dumby haha
it's crashing, it's crumbling and I'm prepared. Until the grid falls apart feeling fine.
This is a good time to buy.

I just did. 

There's a new, flatter and more sustainable uptrend forming. Which happens to be the McAfee Dickline.

The price might fall down to 8760 for a very short time, but I believe that it will bounce back over the dickline very quickly.

Are there any reliable Euro and Asia bitcoin news related sites?

What’s up with the dated, irrelevant and totally shitty FUD article posts guys .. most of the new posts are crap from some days. Can we ban these bots/shills ?
[Checking BTC price lately](https://giphy.com/gifs/muppets-annoyed-vwI4mYEHP8k0w)
Why is there so many big sell orders popping up at 9299.00 😡 fkn weekday daily corporate pump and dumpers 
Guhhhh, under $9K again...
So pumped boys, after so much work I'm now only 0.2 BTC away from my goal! Still gonna take a ton of work, but it finally feels like it's actually possible!
My name is stokelycalm (spelled backwards). The stupid mods banned me. I’m here to say I’m the biggest shorter. To me nothing is a greater Hardon than watching HODLERS piss their pants and lose their money. We all know Bitcoin will revert to $20K+ but I’m a shorter who believes it will fall to $4k before it returns. I’m stokelycalm and I’m the biggest shorter. Please thumbs up my comment lol
Welp I’m selling this isn’t good #NoHodl
Hi again, r/Bitcoin! I'm still in need of some more responses for the quarterly reddit cryptocurrency survey!

Below 9200, first step on the path to 8k!
first yeah！
Holy shit though, I'm new to bitcoin but this must be the most boring thing I've ever laid my eyes upon.
It’s the whales driving down the prices .. the market was great all weekend with no whales about
shake out the weak hands
Hey fellas wanted to share this portfolio tracking and balancing spreadsheet for the community here.. link is in the description of the video for anyone interested as well as some live bitcoin price analysis!

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps\-xE4muyec](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps-xE4muyec)
Is anybody tracking that Mt Gox wallet? Large spikes in sell offs could indicate fear in the market
Im afraid its going down.  Cant break the resistance and a whale doesnt want to fill anymore.  Anyway its the whale who created these huge spikes at random 5min chatrs that creates the momentum. 
Ohhh these Satoshis bout to get it. Imma buy the hell outta yall. Keep going down and see what happens. 
I made $$$ + more bitcoin
A lot of trapped shorts from the 25th of April dump.  I’m expecting a lot of buying interest at 8800.
[removed]
This drop is a very bad sign. Do not buy. It will go much lower. 
Breakout very soon. I hope it will go up, but I‘m afraid it will go down.

1-2 hours max.
BTC today.
https://youtu.be/oUbpGmR1-QM
Down down down! Next stop: 8k
Load the Korea fud
Yeah. We do hope that with in this week it will break the 10k walls
..... Wtf major price drop around that time... If it keeps dropping we might have a physic 
give us a hint
🤔 interesting.
You might want to wait what with the next mt gox sell off wait tiĺl you see a sharp drop thats what I'm doing 
with segwit, signatures are still stored inside the block. it’s just in a different place.

in segwit, the signatures are called witnesses and they are stored in the witness merkel tree.
Too technical..

**To the moooon!!!!**
The mcafee dick line must hold! Long live the mcafee dick line. 
Lol, stick around a little longer and you will change your mind.

Lots of people have very different, very strong opinions on bitcoin.
I think you're in the wrong sub
Currently going through at 1 satoshi
Certainly indicates a positive trend.  Breakout?  Who knows.
I believe it’s just the opposite. It’s when the highs and lows converge to a wedge that we generally see breakouts. 
I think it is not yet a dip. It is just a little setback maybe traders taking some rest but pretty sure this is not a dip
Good tactic you will always get more upvotes in this sub :P. Since you didn't even specify the timeframe.
Most of the serious traders with a big investment is holding their btc right now. they have a more positive views that this market will be mooning. Just waiting for the right time
No :D
>Pretty sure most of these panic posters are just trolls anyways

They are shorters.
I hate having to sit here and watch this. I need to know how the market reacts unfortunately since I think it will determine the next few weeks
You're like that one single housemom that is cheering on her chubby kid playing soccer because he can't keep up with the rest
Hodl your weiner.
look at the volume on bitmex, a lot of traders moved there.
Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I think this should help:

Coinmarketcap > bitcoin > sort by Volume (24hr)
https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/volume/30d?c=e&t=b Click the time periods to get a different perspective.
Volume is low. Last 24 hours is maybe 30&#37; of a busy day. I think we need to crack $12k before it will get really busy.

I know from fx days there's only really 2 busy days a week. Let me lay it out for you.

Monday : Everyone is pissed from Sunday BBQ, need coffee...

Tuesday: Everyone still got the Monday blues, trying but not too hard . Looking at the charts

Wednesday: Feeling better, put in some orders. See how it goes.

Thursday: Holy crap, haven't made any money this week. Buy some shit.

Friday : Half day. Take the profit by lunch, hit the bar.

Saturday: Ugh, Fridays sucks. Hair of the dog, 10 am beer.  BBQ !

Sunday: Hair of the dog, 10 am beer. BBQ !

Shit happens Wednesday's and Thursday's.
Daily reaction volume on these topics are also very low. When in a bear market we get about 700+ comments a day most of them are spam "end of the world". Now we hardly get 200+ with still some occasional trolls.
Well that would be 9.7k. Thats tough
It will go up/down/sideways
May the 4th

(go with you.)
It would look a bit crap if you are Satoshi himself, and you lose your fuckin' private keys.

Bit like Satoshi rolling up at Bitcoin.com's scam site; accidentally buying Shitcoin Cash, then sending it to the wrong wallet.  :)
What are you talking about? Link?
yea... no
We will wait for that time and I think they will do it with a big bang. So don't be caught sleeping.:)
September...?
Yes these traders are the people who have weak heart to handle this market. Maybe they are not oriented very well how this market works
*sheepishly raises hand*.  I held out for a while, sold my small trading stack at 9000. Rebought at 8995.  Feeling dumb. Lost a little on trading fees. Not terrible, but annoying.     
Well, if you believe so, take a short.
I like this terminology
It’s been the US bailing out the world since the crash. South Korea has been a no show and japan hasn’t done much either since most of them bought in long time ago. No whales in Europe but trout and gold fish. 
What Country are you from again?

What are you referring to? I don’t see any fud.
Because fiat can be exchanged for goods and services and also pay my tax obligations.
Cool dude!  

I somehow think I will be responding to a (deleted) post :P
I can only hope you get another ban :)
People tend to lose mind when the lose money. So I completely understand you. 
Good luck I guess
I sold my tiny trading stack.  Hodling the rest as usual 
Not a bad idea, but give it like 45 minutes
And I just bought back in. Hah. Pointless panic selling. I suck at this. 
Sure, why not. I don't feel like dealing with SpecFlow today anyway.
Done:)
Soooooooo..  It will go either up, or down, in a week, but possibly two.
I'd love to know where you're getting this "logic" from...if you can even call it that.
I see that it'll have a hard time to stay in the uptrend. But I don't see an intersection. We already left all the previous downtrends (linear and log scale).

*If* it goes down, which is a possibility, it would form an entirely new downtrend.

Or I'm blind...

Or we go back to the old downtrend, but that would mean around 5-6k, nearly instantly. I find that hard to believe...

https://i.imgur.com/3J0s9bP.png
Every three days someone is calling for a "deathcross" critical moment back with shitty TA. Then we just move on with very standard price action but nobody is there anymore to compare actual performance with original predictions. Rewind. Erase. Repeat.
Depends on the time window of the moving average you are taking. 
Above 9200, first step on the path to 10k!
I think it is more likely to be at 9k again and within this week it will break the 10k walls
What a sucker
Second
Firs....ohh!
Try fx. 
This is what Bitcoin needs. Stability. Without it, it fails at everything. If only it could stay this way then we may have something to work with. 
>this must be the most boring thing I've ever laid my eyes upon.

Are you shagging my girlfriend?
I dont belive its an issue now .... I heard the coins were moved to Kraken last Friday where they will be sold off-exchange .... says Jsnip4 anyway
2 month old fud doesn't work the second time. sorry u fell for it the first time bud. 16,000 btc is not a large amount, nor is 200,000. That amount is traded pretty much daily. 
which exchange are you looking at? I have the same sentiment.
[deleted]
Hey Lenny, can you stop spamming?
You short'n bruh?
For pete's sake, it's just a $300 dip.
Might recover. Good support on the 1d chart. But we shall see.
Maybe, maybe not why maybe it will be a good news for the late comers who wants to buy their shares of bitcoin and this will be  a chance for them
*two hours later*
3 hours later
Go home.  You don’t get it 
I think this is just a usual push and pull scenario but if you are looking at this community looking stronger I think the 9k wall is very easy to recover for bitcoin
pants come off
No I don't.
Love how this sub is such a rich source of knowledge and information.
Whoooooha - **Unexie** - you sold at 6600 Euro on April 13th!!!

Now let us boys have our fun.




You normal Johnny Boy! Your a normal kid just like everyone else!!!! 
HODL! HODL! Steady........

(￣ー￣；
On the eight day we **HODL**
When it breaks 10k you’ll see a marked increase in the comment volume here. 
I would be happy with 9450 to break the trend.
My birthday. :+)
Go with you

Anything which doesn't fellate bitcoin is FUD.
[deleted]
You aren’t blind, we left the down trend already 
I'm not seeing it either.  We've basically been in a big channel for the last few weeks.  Maybe we don't hold that upward slope and drop out of that channel, but I don't see any major intersection up ahead that would drive that kind of move.  Not sure what OP is talking about.
You were saying?
Huehue
Yeah, if only...couple years down the road perhaps.
I do not know, maybe I'll try to confirm your opinion ... already I tried bitcoin, I can confirm that it's not boring ..
Not at the moment, no. Why?
Moved to kraken, an exchange, to sell off exchange? 
It may not be large amount but we all saw its impact. Fear
> 16,000 btc is not a large amount, nor is 200,000.

I wouldn't mind having 16000 BTC. Won't ya hook a brother up?
it's either that , hold what you got. or panic sell. typically the first choice is best. we all know dam well it's gonna go pass 10k soon. why not stock up and x more.
Oh BTW i sold at 9.4. i was not waiting around for the mt. gox dude to sell off. im not doing it outta fear or anything. i just want more =)
Hes the resident troll
Sorry for the delay. We are experiencing technical difficulties...
Me neither
Yes and rich also with the opinions and emotions of the people losing and gaining in this community
And sadly it's impossible to buy back at a lower price? 
Maybe before the end of this day it will break that 9.5 k .4 hours ago has it at 9345., so I think it can break that
**To the Mooooon!!!**

*Edit: made it bold.*
THX
Any reason to justify huge pump would have done the trick anyway. Traders *need* these highly speculative moves so I bet at any time you will always find a coin pumping 15-20% a day event if you have never heard about it before.
That's utter rubbish. There is far more involved in the future of Btc over the next 6 months than the price in the next week. Utter rubbish!!!!
Please, show me a chart where I can see the *intersection* you are talking about...
ummm... no.   It might suggest a future trend but it does not set the trend.
Hurdurrr
Maybe but trying to explain that to this subreddit is like getting blood from a stone. Stability doesn't mean you can't profit from a move in price, it simply means you have to use margin to compensate for the lack of volatility. Just look at fx, people can make a lot of money if they know what their doing but I suppose that's the problem here, most people in crypto don't know what they're doing and because of this they erode any half-decent fundamentals Bitcoin may have had for the sake of making a quick buck. Anyway c'est la vie! 
What you saw was the natural and obvious conclusion to a parabolic move. Had stuffall to do with Mt Gox. They might not have helped, but I don't' think they're dumping enough volume to make much of a difference.

The other day we traded 10 000 coins in 5 minutes. They're only planning to move 16 000
Yes you do.
Why not buy back?  I've made mistakes and lost up to 15% of my portfolio.  

But I learned, and although I rue that lost 15%, my portfolio is still worth an awful lot of money.

I have a simple idiot rule: that I won't get FOMO again.
Bye
More u guys deny.. more its going down 🤦‍♂️
Dude, I'm sorry, but if you don't think a 16,000 coin dump will "make much of a difference" you don't understand the workings of this market. 
Those MTGox coins DO have the potential to move the market in a big way. Hopefully they get traded OTC or are drip-fed into the market, but regardless, small investors are still at the mercy of other large holders who are capable of crashing the market pretty hard. 
Those large balances are the elephant in the room. They are there for all to see but nobody really wants to acknowledge them. 
Posts that do acknowledge that we investors are at the mercy of some random BTC millionaire get downvoted because, well, let's just try and push that idea out of sight and out of mind (a human trait that seems magnified in this crypto world, along with a couple other characteristics we have).
In my opinion there are still a few shakeouts to come before this market settles to the point where we can use crypto as actual currency (no shit Sherlock) and I think a lot of investors will unfortunately get hurt in the process. The reason I think this is because I believe in the general idea that there is no free lunch. 
This space seems overpopulated with people that haven't learnt that basic premise, but that's ok. I think that's mainly because crypto is populated by a relatively youthful majority and the youth can bounce back if they lose a chunk of dough. 
Anyway, I believe Bitcoin is here for the long term. I think it has a solid foundation and a resilience that other coins do not have. Be careful not to invest more than you can afford to lose and you can ride the market without worry as it plays out. There will be swings larger than today's 5% to come and it's not worth the stress to have too much invested on them. 
I think there's still time to gradually get into the market. 
Disclaimer: I suck at predicting which way this thing goes. 

So do I
https://imgur.com/a/hinROyV

Don't worry.
What's denial got to do with this ? More guys like me see buying opportunities the more we support it by putting money into it. I'll do 100&#37; on this move in the next 48 hours. 
You for real mate ? Calculator mot working or something ? 16 000 coins isn't even a morning in Bticoin. 
Told you.
I didn't say I was worrying.
Aren't you the piker who claimed to be able read the market like an old movie and that it will go pass 10k early this week?

You really are full of shit.
Not the point. The total volume of coins traded in a day is meaningless when the average trade is as small as it is. 
A daily volume of 1 million coins is made up of 1,000,000's of trades each hour, half on the green side/half on the red side, with the average trade < 0.01 BTC. You better believe that selling chunks of volume into that market will move it pretty hard.
I know someone who is scalping 1.80% per trade using "just" 30 Bitcoins. He's making multiple trades on each side per day. This on a small exchange with a daily volume of 400 or so BTC. He's taken his initial investment off the table and is making a tidy income for himself with a simple scalping bot. He would screw that market for himself and lose all profit in commission if he put in a market price sell of 30 BTC though. Instead he's able to bounce off the walls he sets up on each side. 


I said hopefully early this week. Prophet I'm not. I don't have a 100&#37; hit rate just like everyone else. But of course the week is very far from over. Not even Tuesday yet in some places. 

I bought this. I love moves like this. How you pay the bills.
ROFL!  Changing your tune now?

"hopefully"?  "Prophet I'm not"?  

Here's your brag - 
[Little Piker] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8fj22g/daily_discussion_april_28_2018/dy5ina9/)
I know what I said. And I stand by it. We should do $10k this week, hopefully sooner rather than later. At least I have the balls to make the call.
Typical piker behaviour.

Every retard can make a wild claim.  That's not "having balls".  It's called bullshit.
Don't you think perhaps you should wait till the week is over before you call bullshit ? If I miss it, it will be by a day or two at most.

It is only early Tuesday still or can't you read a calendar either ?

You and your mate are exactly the same, useless. Can't trade your way out of a wet paper bag.

Blind man with a guide dog can see were going past $10k, I don't think we'll even stop there. Going straight to $12k. 
Zzzzz .....

Now I'm sensing that your claim of 10 years of fx trading is baloney as well.
Who cares...phone life line tell them, maybe they'll care.
