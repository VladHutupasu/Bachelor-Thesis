*weak hands shakedown - OMG PANIC SELL AT 7900, 
5 minutes later.. oh its going back up *buys back in a 7950*
Don't panic sell you üê±s
The bottom was Feb 5th. That was more than 2 months ago. Onward and upward! 
Mcafee is almost in the "no eat" zone again.

There's so much pressure on the buy side of the book, doubt this is going to last very long...
Just bought another small chunk. You may rise again now.
So here's a question. Is there any standard measurement/landmark to clarify at what point a bull-run can be declared (before a peak of course) people keep mentioning it. 

 I'd be just as happy for slow, long term upward drift than a quadratic spike, but at least bitcoin isn't falling fast anymore! 
All the TA guys I'm following on tradingview are suddenly very quiet... hmmm...
Anytime theres a tiny drop. everyone panic sells. 
Ok there was the anticipated big dump.  Next step we climb back above 8k and beyond! 
One thing I have not seen much of here, is discussion about BTC derivatives.  The turning point for BTC, as I see it, was when the authorities approved BTC for derivative trading in December 2017 (link below).  Unfortunately, and fortunately for some, this gave speculators the ability to sell BTC without holding a single coin (also known as short selling).  This happens in stock markets all the time where the price is driven down not by the lack of buyers, but due to the sheer volume of derivative sellers.  You can easily find those stocks that are heavily shorted and it ultimately puts pressure on the sell side driving the price down further.

We are now in April 2018 and BTC is trading at 40% of its all time high.  This is not due to lack of buyers IMHO but simply due to the volume of sellers, specifically on the derivative platform.  Think about it, what better way to make money other than sell an asset that is trading at an all time high as there is large potential for a massive sell off.  This is why we have seen massive sell offs with BTC after periods of large gains such as, $19.5k, $17k and $11k. 

So the price of BTC is largely driven by the volume of short sellers, not the volume of long term buyers (eg; Hodlers).  Now my thoughts are that sellers are running out of steam and there is largely more upside at current prices than there is downside, this could mark a significant change in sentiment.  Not to disregard that prices have also somewhat plateaued around the 6000-6500 mark.

This is either a turning point where those derivative sellers become buyers, or continue to sell knowing that the lower the price goes the more risk there is of potential upside and that short trade being stopped out.  Sideways trading is always a good signal that sentiment may be shifting and yes we had some sideways trading recently (31 March to 11 April) which was followed by a large swing upwards. Long, boring periods of sideways trading is what BTC needs people, the more this occurs the greater the potential for upside and the greater the potential for a return of the bull market that we all are eagerly awaiting.

It's preparing for a bounce to 9k
I think the plan is to hold $8050 until the American markets get going.
Oh 8000, you're a sight for sore eyes!
Bitcoin over 8000. Things are looking up. 
Uh. Mercia. What we doing here. There's oil at 20k let's go
[deleted]
I guess btc is on the rise again :) 
Under this kind of market which can be heavily affected by unreliable news, 4/17 could be disastrous.
Whoever wins this fight at 7800 it will breakout that direction hard

Hey i was kinda right 
I love the little fudsters on here with little baby balls who start crying and cheering dips because they couldnt find those little baby balls to buy at the dip. At this point i get more joy watching you cry and buy late then making money. 
Just bought another 3 hundred dollars of bitcoin, that next big green candle is on me.
Holy shit what the fuck is going on? I woke up with new inspiration and motivation, ready to change my life, and then I decide to check coinmarketcap again feeling for old times sake feeling invincible and see BTC 8.1K WTF! THE HYPE IS BACK! GET READY FOR OVER 9000 MEMES! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT!
We may possibly be seeing a little bit of a breakout happening. Maybe.
Here we go! To the moon!!!
Was waiting for today(payday) to buy $1000 worth more of Bitcoin but of course it goes up a bunch, and every time I have bought in the past it goes down. Should I still risk it and buy at current price? 
[deleted]
Probably going to settle 7900-8k for the weekend
ouch, everyone's stop sell orders going off
**Come On Bulls!**
lol the market is just trying to deceive us in the short-term. Been through this way too many times now. It still scares the ball off of me tho. Feels like my soul is being chipped away 
Noob here. Can anyone explain why the other coins paired with USDT crash and spike with BTC? Just can't seem to understand this..... 
i missed the dip
War bounce?
First comment!
I hope the run continues. Nice to see it crack 8
According my TA, Tea-leaf Analysis, Bitcoin is going to do whatever the hell it wants. 
**Come On Bulls!**
I have to accept I only like big price fluctuations no matter up or down. A stable price for a couple of hours gives me convulsions. 
I really fcked up yesterday trying to be a smartass

Bought in last week at 5449 euros and sold yesterday at 5915 euros thinking it was a pump and dump during the 'happy hour'

Totally fell for the FOMO - I know this is scant consolation but I have not lost any money yet in my careful buying and selling just taking small gains here and there

Ok so what are my options now, would you wait for a few days or buy atm?

Have about 20k GBP good to go

And yes I know I am a fcking dick
**Bulls, keep your eyes on the game, there is still a lot of work to do.  Many thanks.**
Ok boys the weekend is upon us. It‚Äôs been a while, but I‚Äôll be dusting off the ol‚Äô balloon üéà and we are getting ready to make our way up through 8000-9000 feet altitude zone.  With any luck we‚Äôll float above 9k in due course.  Come fly with me. 
Keep an eye out for active users in the sub. Every fucking time the active users go above 10k the price of bitcoin jumps wildly or crashes. I‚Äôve been watching this since October. Earlier the price was $8200 with 6000 users here then it went to 11000 and the price fell to $7800 in 15 minutes. 
It was the exact same when it went from 12k to $6k and every other time between. You‚Äôll also notice a massive spike in users with fresh accounts under 1 month start active posts or comments that try and create fear or attempt to shit on other users for asking questions. It‚Äôs as if a massive group of people are actively trying to manipulate the current price or Bitcoin. Who coulda seen that coming... 
Sorry for the noob question but is this a good time to buy reddit gold?
We need to break $8,246.61 to get back on track. :-)

https://fnordprefekt.de/
when tax season ends? 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3L4YrGaR8E4 
Almost bought $8220.
**Another push from The Bulls!**
Have no idea how it's could go up for 1k within 1hour without no reason. Some big animal had to buy a lot. 
If I withdraw bitcoin from my bitcoin wallet, is the withdraw-transaction recorded on the blockchain?
lol bitcoin doesn't want to go down... 
I'm a little concerned with the weekend though....Institutional investors dont trade on weekends. We need a little friday night pump to keep the party going
Had to sell @6600‚Ç¨ 

Lets see where it goes next
Is it better to consistently sell at highs and buy lows, or just to hold at a decent price?
I wonder where I can borrow $8k from.....
My goodness you guys are negative. Did none of ya'll see this coming with a very high 4hr RSI? Of course it's going to dump. 
[deleted]
Im waiting for 10k$ till then Im not getting excited. It might be one big bull trap. Please don't downvote me, its just my concern. 
This is the bart chart, we all knew that, i'm expecting for a real bull run between june and october and then i'm pretty convinced that we'll get the 35k, still just be patient, it's pretty reasonable that drops maybe to 7200, and is still better than 6800... Btc growth like that, jumping and dumping... one year ago we were close to 1000. Nothing else to say.
If the price stays above $7800 for the next 30 mins. We will have the first full candle above the downtrend in the 4h chart. This would be a very bullish sign.

Just read a story in the Independent saying an Indonesian Islamic scholar has declared bitcoin Halal. Maybe that's influenced the price increase.

Dumping 
[deleted]
The Bulls could smash this back up to $8200 easily. 
Going to sleep, it better not be less than 7900 when I wake up in 7 hours.

(This means it will probably be like 6k considering my luck with this shit...)
I can feel it coming in the air tonight. Yeah. I said it 
**Support The Bulls as much as you can folks.**
I know I'm dreaming but it would be so nice to see volume at 100,000 on GDAX and the price shooting up to $15k. 
I think we could easily hit 9k today.   Just one of those trade mark long green dildos and we're practically there.
I've been watching [this](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/YRZvdurN-The-target-of-current-bubble-lays-between-40k-and-110k/) chart since November. I know that TA with bitcoin is speculative at best but it's uncanny how closely the price has been following the prediction. 

If this upswing continues, this guy will be an absolute god.
Meanwhile, over on the naughty step:

* Someone is trolling Bcash, and doing rather a good job:

A plea.  

My team and I visit r/btc to keep you informed.  It is hazardous to mental health.  We seek no recompense, but ask that you donate your shitcoins to any suitable charity that will save the babies.


I knew I should have bought a little more at sub7K prices, but I am also glad I didn't because the price jumped. 
Still a lot of hard work to go.  
This is a bit embarrassing, but I have a BTC balance on an opendime, I know the address of it but I don't physically have the device on me. I'd like to check the balance. Could someone please refer me to a service where i can do that? Thanks in advance
Would anyone recommend consolidating investments to bitcoin or is it worth having a spread of crypto? 
Please stay above 8k :(
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooo !!!

Uh oh, on its way back to lucky 7;) Grizzly attack for now. Thursday morning wasn‚Äôt fair
Ohhhh noooo. Lol. Zero percent

8k who??  üëÄ
Will this hold over the weekend? Or dip
Can we crush this wall at 8050?  
my technical analysis shows people really have no fucking idea what the price will do
[removed]
lets go dump just started 
I'm guessing obviously but that could have been a big player selling a load to get some money to pay his taxes, hopefully just a small blip. 
Man is there a great wall at 8200 or something?  I think is super important to stay above 7800, this is our safety net before going much lower.  If we can go sideways here, I believe we will gain momentum and try again 8200 again.
Biz down?
Here we go again, weeee!

Feels like riding a roller coaster.

lambo, lambo, moon, moon, ra-ta-ta
Why did the price go up about $1,000 over the course of 45 minutes a day ago????!!!!

Who did this? What are their intentions? 

They obviously wanted to make a point or they would have done it quietly. This is a pump, but will they keep pumping??

There's evidence that the dollar value of the pump is equal to the amount of Tether moved around in the official Tether team wallets.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPu9i2ICdfI&feature=push-u&attr_tag=NYlEtj0p1qfahSQC-6

I'm not saying a pump is bad... we need it. But was is their end goal? 
Adoption is more important than price.

hey guys,

just fund this chart about BTC/USD https://de.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/Wu3tZzYV/

What's your opinion about that?

Good trades to everybody
It's Friday the 13th, the last business day in America before taxes are due, and bitcoin crashed hard at the very end of the tax year, WHAT COULD GO WRONG?

Whales don't manipulate the market they manipulate the people, feel sorry for people that are buying right now shoulda bought the dips.
BTC gettin the toilet paper ready again.

Here's the bounce back to $8200!!!
Annnnnnd here come the fresh alt accounts to try and downvote or spread BS about how I‚Äôm wrong... you‚Äôre right guys no market manipulation at allllll
So much for 8k. Back to 6k by the end of Sunday. 
[deleted]
YAY. WE'RE GOING BACK DOWN. NO. SUPPORT.
6.5k again this weekend
How does a wallet work? ELI5?

I assume I buy it, it somehow uses a usb cable or wifi to connect to the internet, and then I provide some kind of code to Gemini, like an account number? And transfer my bitcoin to this electronic device? Then what happens?
Here comes the morning dump. Hopefully it's minimal and 8K can hold 
up or down?
They would just not let it go up.. fre** bears and our tether bois
This looks like a normal price increase now, The Big problem is what caused it isn't normal
It will make me understand why selling an asset like bitcoin. If you need your money put it under your bed.
So, if I use Gemini, how trustworthy are any of these services? $8k is a lot of money to invest.
Fresh new analysis about to begin for Friday the 13th!

bitcoin needs a higher high or people will start panicking 
Bitcoin is pure manipulation, if you have bots you have manipulation.
Welp, looks like holding 8k may not happen. Plunging fast now. Weeeeeee

Yeah man.  I‚Äôm even cool with living at 8k for a bit. Then see how 10‚Äôs ass feels.  I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs perfect

You're a prophet mate. 
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp

"Generally speaking, a bull market happens when prices rise by 20 percent, usually after a drop of 20 percent and before a 20 percent decline. Since they are difficult to predict, bull markets can typically only be recognized once they‚Äôve happened."

70% from ath is a small drop?
agreed. last minute tax filers. 
to long didnt read
You could be right, I have also heard that there is the possibility of it breaking out downwards after a long side ways period.
We won't see sub 7k ever again.  
It depends on the timeline
not really..
What's being announced then?
I agree, we are barely holding on but most importantly still holding on.
No not really but it could happen 
then you'd love r/buttcoin
It‚Äôs not enough, you have to buy more 
Bitcoin rule #420: control your emotions
But but muh TA based on shit not related to bitcoin says we'll be at 5k soon.
again...

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp
no one knows. in longterm 8k might be still a good price to buyin, i dont see a drop 6k again unless there is massive fud
I believe it will go down again. But not back to 6500. People have seen how easily it can rise again, they will use the next dip to buy in before it's too late. At least that is my plan for my next purchase.

So, I'd wait a few days for a larger dip.

But I could be wrong. The price is really unpredictable.
Just dollar cost average.  What can you afford to tie up long term
?
If you're living pay cheque to pay cheque, don't buy Bitcoin.
Build a time machine.  Buy it yesterday.  That's what I'd do.
Prob just wait a few days. The price has gone only down for the last 3 months. This is the first two consecutive green days in a long time. 
You had to sell bitcoins (plural) because of taxes!? Damn boy,how much taxes you got over there!
I took $ from home equity before I sold off at shit prices
already passed there... lol and this  looks like just the beginning...I just hope it stays above 7200 by 4/17, so that pump actually means something.
Dhodtosteoyclhclyclhclhdgsyehlx!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is retarded
They follow BTC.  It's the real deal.
USDT is like real USD you pay on coinbase. The coin/coin pairs are technically crashing as well. You just don't see it because every coin is down the same percentage.
Arbitage trading between different coins.
The dip was like a week long so, no excuses!

Thanks so much to everyone out there who works to develop these technologies! Exciting times ahead
Second 
Yeah, come on bulls, run forward... INTO THE BULL TRAP!!!
Why did you fuck up? You made a profit.

Other than that: Nobody can predict the price. Buy small chunks. If it goes down after your first buy: buy a lttle more. If it goes up: wait a little. Cost average. And hold long time.
Don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself. The FUD is real. Accept it, learn from, hodl on. 
Euro and GBP?
What's your problem? You made 10%. You are fine. This will drop, relax.

Don't worry. I'm staring at the price as hard as I can so there's no way it's going down now.
You welcome
I may agree with the second part lol 
So, I am often a poo-pooer here. I feel that it's like /r/politics, where people put really unrealistic nonsense here fuled by hopes, dreams, and lies. During the election, there was so much 'hil could do no wrong' that I had to respond and play the devil's advocate. 

Unfortunately, I seem to always buy before the dip, and sell and then lose money. 3x it has happened. Everyone says lambos, I buy, and then it crashes $600. Story of my life.

The reality is this is GAMBLING and what people say has no meaning, it's all nonsense to be sifted through for the information that is truly helpful.

Right now, I am looking to learn about wallets, but I am being reported because they want their BTC to go up, so only positive nonsense is being upvoted, and the voice of reason is being down voted.
It's more like: every fucking time the price of bitcoin jumps wildly or crashes the active users go above 10k - it's just people getting excited about price action, normal thing.

And you can't manipulate the price from here. Even if you get to do all subreddit readers to do what you want - and you don't - but even then the volume would be ridiculous low. A few millions $ perhaps.
!redditsilver
I like reddit cash better.
no we dont, it can go even lower, then can bounce back even higher, its always steadly going up even some of us dont see it ;)

I've always felt that Rage against the Machine aren't half as good as they sound.
Always buy at the top price.  That way you know you are getting quality Bitcoins.
You will regret it in a Year ;)
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsqueeze.asp
It's not being manipulated. Nah.
Well it should on the ledger somewhere. Right?
It is because Bitcoin is a lady coin, and is unpredictable and irrational.
Yes.  

If you withdraw it, it has to go somewhere.  

If it has gone somewhere, that needs to be recorded.

The Bitcoins don't really exist - it is really a series of transactions and movements recorded on a distributed ledger.
Withdraw how? You can only send bitcoins from one wallet to another one. And of course this will be recorded on the blockchain.
Its been pretty solid the past few weekends. Saturdays were amazing. I am pretty sure it's about time to pump. The day chart looks amazing
Welp I don't reply on my own comments often but hot damn that was well timed
I think it's better to just hold till Nov/Dec maybe. Then you're going to have to be on the toes if it's anything like last year. 

Another approach would be to split your account in two, use half to hold and half for active trading. 
It's only nice to hold during a bull market. I wouldn't say we are out of the woods yet though. Right now I would sell high and just put a stop-buy order slightly below my sell just in case it does go up. I still think bitcoin needs to dip more but we will see.
If you don't like tax forms, just hold. And buy dips.
Most don‚Äôt understand trading brah 
Not true at all.
I agree with this somewhat, although it needs to break the 8927 high on 3/24 to reverse the 2018 trend of constantly decreasing ceilings.
since Jan btc every little spike get me lot of hope then next day it's turn out a very disappointing deep mil of times this repeated and mil of times I got exited only this time I m not excited coz next day I might see another deep  I would be very happy if I m wrong 
If you‚Äôve been paying attention, once the weekend hits and the regular markets close, Cryptomsrkets get an infusion of all kinds of ‚Äòthrow away‚Äô fiat from investors looking for stuff to do. This bull run will magnify normal weekend gains
Yep Ôºåme too.i am not a bit happiness with the btc raising 
one year ago you were close to 1000, 4 months ago you were close to 20000, now your happy with a jump to 7200?
That overall trend is going to zero. 
Thx ur analysis ,i hope what you said will get it 
Good observation. However no such as a bullish sign as long as whales exist. It‚Äôs always a whalish sign.
They did that months ago
hmmm

Trying! 
That's a really roundabout way to say "Buy Bitcoin"

Not that I disagree.
Nope, I bought the dip.  


I'll sell soon at the top. 
dont forget the bears.
The green arrows say the price should be about 15k by now.  He's way off.

Yes, it will hold or dip. Or rise.
Yes we can.
Can we build it?

First Law of Bitcoin: Never sell Bitcoin.
Not so fast. Going back up 
It was short term moving average crossing below long term moving average on 15m chart triggering a sell off, which triggered stop losses and a further drop.  Then when everybody who realized stop loss was unnecessary had to buy back in, price came up and resumed 1m oscillations at the long term average on the 1h chart.
What‚Äôs the significance of 7800?

Lambro, lambro, moron, moron, ra-ta-ta
Short covering mate, not to lose money. In todays market's you find bots sitting there watching levels and if it is breached the bot will start closing, that hits another bots levels and so on. That's why we get flash crashes, or spikes like these.

It's not all manipulation and pumps and dumps. Sometimes shit happens for technical reasons. 
short being covered ,Highest volume on bitmex.Go look at longs chart and shorts chart.

Its not manipulation and has nothing to do with tether


The mystery is killing me.  Who gave the order to Pamp Eet?
Dont get me wrong I am not an expert. But bitcoin is controled by the people, we dont realize if we hold that drives up the price, but the whales who own the majority of the bitcoin know that they can control the people (not bitcoin). So they sell a bunch of bitcoin at once which drives down the price and at the same time while the price is crashing they buy more bitcoin. So when the people who are afraid of losing more money sell their coins the whales buy them all up, and when there are no more weak hands to sell the whales start to drive up the price because they bought the coins at a discount and they need to sell the coins. If you want to get rich like a whale you have to think like a whale.   
Pretty sure those 2 go hand in hand
Adoption is desirable.  But adoption and price are almost independent of each other.

(Shhh, don't tell Roger...)
Only an idiot will agree with that sentiment. There's a lot less manipulation here than you and everybody else thinks. As I pointed out to someone else, sometimes people just buy shit. Or sell shit. 

TA is worthless, but not because of manipulation. It's worthless because it comes from an era where people read charts with pencils and rulers. This is the computer age, computers aren't meant to stare at screens, they're meant to crunch numbers and do high volumes of repetitive tasks over and over and over. None of that involves a friggen line on a screen.

Interesting that most of the charts you "find" are by the same author...
Jason Vorhees slashes bitcoin in half?
Taxes are due Tuesday the 17th this year.
Some people like to see some sign of health before buying though. It's fine to buy now, as long as you don't put everything in during the climb (and it was good if you had a chance to buy the dip too). I feel that it's best to buy in stages. The more volume, the harder it is for whales to create greater volatility, but I agree that whales often like it when people react quickly or predictably.

It's one of the best exchanges. Founded by the Winklevoss brothers, who are invested in bitcoin themselves. They are also licensed to trade in New York, an approval that is not easy to get.
You know, you can buy a fraction of a Bitcoin?
Gemini is supposed to be very secure, haven‚Äôt tried it myself.  I use gdax ( no fees on limit orders).   Best thing to do once you get your bitcoin for security is buy a hardware wallet like Trezor or Nano. And put your bitcoin on that.  
Lol if you have to ask that question dont use it.
They just rised their fees for small player. I woudnt use it
bollocks!
Can you tell your bots please to raise the price?

k thx
I don't see what you're seeing.
lol what the fuck

CNBC knows people will always click on a Bitcoin link.

I used to click on the FUD because I also run a website and know that traffic=more articles.
Want lambo, but also want to see him eat it ü§î
That's not tradingview.

edit: Watching right now. Wow! This guy is a quack. Are people really basing their trading decisions on his opinions?

edit2: After finishing, I *do* agree with his conclusion, though.
Spurred on by whales (note the transactions of over 50 btc that just went through). There's a good chance that it will level out soon (and they'll buy back in), but who knows.
Probably just guys in NY city grabbing some profit before the weekend
lol.....obviously not enough words like 'lambo' and 'moon' and 'moon-lambo'
Of course there is that possibility.....I guess my point was more about derivatives and short sellers and how i beleive the sentiment is shifting.  Anyway thanks for reading i get a bit tired of the same old crap on here 
Indeed. In my timeline it was *always* on the rise.
You blind?
I bought some more. You can thank me later.
While smoking a j...
Love this @bennidez 
I feel like 420 and control of emotions don't belong in the same sentence. 
Trump did it. 
I always saw 6k as the floor that's why I wanted to invest as much as can at that price to hopefully make up my losses quicker but now I'm worried to invest, literally has gone down at every point I have bought, including 7300 lol
around 7800$ Will be the short term low with lot of resistance
If I was living paycheck to paycheck i probably wouldn't have $1,000 available after get paid to spend on Bitcoin. 
You don't even have to build the time machine, just remember to build it later.  That's what I'd do.
Remember what I said.
sorry I meant the dip we had an hour ago lolo
Nooooooooooooooooo
Edgy.
ummm ...... No... no trap.. its just a pure & clean bull run
Because if I had held my nerve I would be a lot better off now

I know in this game you have to follow through on your convictions and not think about 'what could have been'

Anyhow would you buy now or wait?
Have to trade in euros on Gdax here in the Uk, don't ask long story

Yeah bought at 6k and they were all poorly minted
Haha üòÜ 
At these levels it was late to the party inexperienced shorts getting squeezed.  I'm pretty sure the big money shorts are mostly covered by now.  I actually predicted this about a week or so ago.  Don't mistake this for the next bull run. 
....Withdraw to convert into a currency such as USD
I do like that idea of splitting it in half, trade some, hold some
it's not about if im happy with that or not, its about its reasonable, cryptos in general are for long term, bc in short term its pretty obvious to see this kind of movements.
If it goes to zero I will buy all of them. 
Omg. Lmao. 
Cool.  
:)  
Good luck.
They will always have a place in our memories.
The advice is to buy when everyone else is selling, and sell when everyone else is buying. If shorts are at an all time high.... then everyone is selling. Time to buy.
It is.

300 days moving average and an upper line of a major downtrend channel.
Down?
why do you guys talk about bots like its a thing, this is not an mmo . everyone can set a price they want to buy and sell at and then go about there day
I guess I didn't consider this, though I know about the bots. Still, seems like an inorganic pump to me. Many crypto experts feel the same way. Covering the shorts might be a big factor too.

Still, that's a very quick rise. $1,000 in 45 minutes!!!!
Well we need to make the boys crash every time.
If you Must know it was me.
How is TA worthless? Every major indicator has shown over last week that we are over sold and bottom is forming. This rise was very predictable

FTFY
Mr. Taxman's wild ride is getting good towards the end.
rule 1: wait for confirmation of breakout

a lot of people waiting to see it break 10k before buying. and by a lot, i mean i heard one podcast where one dude said he was going that
The price is dropping thats should be the time people buy yea it might not come back up but you are still buying more coins at a discount. 
My post history on this sub has always been positive. I‚Äôve owned bitcoin since 2015 and been in the crypto world since 2013. I believe in the technology and enjoy its uses but I and many others are worried about market manipulation and unsustainable patterns that cause the market to fail. It doesn‚Äôt always have to be a bull market (although I love it) but when a group or groups of investors try to hedge the market and kill it you will feel the same way. Todays been positive but just stay weary of a bull trap. The pullback may be around 8100-8200 with current buy and sell orders. 
I see that now. Their comment history seems to fluctuate from it's the end-of-the-world! Bitcoin to 1k! one day to the occasional suggestion to buy like crazy. If that's not trolling, it certainly seems to suggest that this poster is on a different astral plane. 
That is rude to call someone a troll. I am entitled to my completely uneducated opinion like everyone else here. 
[deleted]
I googled the wallet Nano, and I don't still understand how it works. So I have people threatening to report me for trolling, when clearly I am asking a normal regular question as to how it links to my account, and how I withdraw. 
I am pretty sure its gonna move, yes!
Thank you. I have lost a few hundred already, buying in at 7, and it dropped to 6500, then bought in at 8, and it dropped to 7500. I purchased only a few hundred, not the full 8k. But I am considering getting a wallet, but I don't know how they work, and everyone is bullying me here calling me a troll for my lack of knowledge.
yea, but like if I buy $800 worth, it would have to like quadruple to $32k to make it even interesting for me (meaning I would have $3,200). Otherwise tying up $800 for $100 or $200 really ain't worth it.
guess i was right
I by bots you are referring to people that work at the exchange ok I will submit a request.
Nate is a known troll. Ignore.

You missed the quilts? Oh shit man. That was a good one. Wonder how those ladies are doing. 
That's a bingo, but short to medium term it is probably going down. $1300 is still a possibility.
My guess is that he rotated his monitor upside down during the bear trend, denying the truth, unable to face the harsh reality.

He was so delusional about it that he eventually believed the inverted chart to be true. Now btc is on the rise again but his monitor is still upside down.
You better control that.
just hodl and you will be fine with these prices. it just dipped to 8050 now, maybe youll just wait for the weekend
so if you simply held you would be in profit now. 
Thats why you DCA and don't lose your shit if it's down 5-10% assuming you planned for this long term and you can actually afford to lose it. 

If this scared you you need to re evaluate your ammount you're investing or if you actually believe in crypto's (or btc's) long term fundamentals

If you're trying to trade this on a short duration, don't.
I see my target for new buys around $7000. But we'll see. If we don't go there, I already have enough in my bags...
Shit.  I hadn't thought of that.  Or rather I have now, as I jumped back to 2011, thought of it, sold a pizza for 10,000 BTC and came back again.
That‚Äôs some dip!
But its BBQ season and I like bull burger :(
Dude, if I had a Bitcoin for every missed opportunity in this market I'd be a millionaire. Can't beat yourself up about it. 

If you are just going short term I would probably hold off on buying for at least a week or so and see where the market goes. Even if it goes up and you miss another opportunity there is still so much room for Bitcoin to grow. But short term it could definitely fall back down. If you want to go long term then I'd say yes buy now and hodl for at least a year. 
what stop losses are you using? or did you just choose a 10% take profit and get out then? do you use trailing stops?
I signed up on GDAX yesterday and transferred my coinbase funds because I wanted to set up stop-loss without having to check every 5 minutes.  First half an hour spent trying to figure out why the Fuck it was only selling bitcoin for vergcoin.  Then I remembered a post on this sub about how bitrash was the default for GDAX.  I clicked on the menu top left and changed it to BTC/USD.
lol!

Didn't expect anything less from a /r/The_Donald member.
Yeah, I wonder what the effect of this will be. Shorters were forced to buy Bitcoins. They are not holders, so I imagine they want to get rid of them...


Sell.  You're selling your bitcoins on an exchange. 
Then you have to send them from your wallet to the wallet of an exchange. This transaction will be on the blockchain.

If they are already on an exchange, they're not in *your wallet*. They are in the wallet of your exchange, and even if you sell them they will most likely not be transferred to another wallet. This won't be recorded on the blockchain.
Currently I'm only holding, we're in such early stages of this years rally, but later in the year I'll go to a significant portion into cash and use a portion of that cash to fund speculative trades for the day-to-day income. 
For real. 
This time bitcoin is crashing upwards.
What do you write? Romance Novels?
What are some of your works? Anything published?
Most of these guys sweat looking at screens, a gym would kill them. 
Man, I didn‚Äôt really understand any of that. 

Sorry!
I actually almost sold when I saw that dip start, but forced myself not to hit the button based on that crossover info I shared previously.  So hard to trust when you see it dipping like that.  You can see everything I said happening right now.
What‚Äôs the significance of that?
Because some of us, myself included have written hundreds if not thousands of them. All the exchanges have REST API's. Anybody who is half professional and has money will have at least some form of automation going, wether it be semi-manual batch orders or fully automated systems. Something like 90% of exchange volumes globally is automated. You'll be very hard pressed to find professional people still sitting there punching in orders. They simply punch in parameters and the machines take it from there.  
Well, spread the word. Most people here seems to think all movements are manipulations or attempts at manipulation and that's simply not the case. These markets are small and easily moved by bigger orders. Simple. 

Of course there are attempts at manipulation as well, but they're fairly easy to spot and as long as no one panics they generally don't work.  The most obvious of those are big sell orders just above market to try drive prices down, but the moment you challenge those and take a nip out of them they disappear. 
That isn‚Äôt what a lot of TA ‚Äòexperts‚Äô have been saying for the past few weeks. In fact the vast majority I‚Äôve read have been saying sub 6k was inevitable and many calling for 4,3,2 and even 1k in line with the downtrend.

To be fair that hasn‚Äôt been broken yet but I‚Äôd definitely question that there was a consensus of a bottom being reached / the recent move up being very predictable  
I think a lot of people are willing to easily dismiss what they don't understand.
On forex for example you have 20 000 to 40 000 ticks per pair per day, so if you trade say 30 pairs you'd have roughly 1 000 000 value changes per day to profit from. 

And you are staring at a line ? 

In crypto's you have over 1000 instruments x ticks per day. Go do the math. 
We need more journalism like this!
You have a history here troll. Look at your bad Karma. Get back in the containment unit.  
Okay. But you did write earlier that you switch from "moon" to "bitcoin is going to zero" for lolz, so I'd surprised if you don't wear the "troll" label with a certain amount of pride.

> I have lost a few hundred already

You haven't lost anything if you hold.
Go to bitcoin.org and read the suggested wallets section and the summary of each type. I recommend Electrum. 
with 8k I wouldnt get a wallet because you will probably lose everything needed to access your info. With 8K  stick with gemini, or poloniex. Buy high sell low, repeat, then create a reddit account and give advice like an expert. Welcome tobitcoin.
Exchanges are trustworthy enough to make purchases. 

You can (and should) withdraw your Bitcoins to your personal wallet afterwards, for maximum security.
You are a troll if 800 makes me a $100 or $200 thats good, your in the wrong place you need to go to brovada for those kinds of return (quadruple).
You clearly aren't ready.
thanks. it worked.
Nice one :) 
Who says I've ever sold? I have never sold, I just bought at wrong times because it always goes down when I buy, I have put around 25k in btc and it's currently valued at little under 15k, all I've done is buy to try dig myself out of red quicker, just been pumping money in at wrong times, in the long term I'm still confident but still sucks to be in the red by so much in the meantime
The key here being will it recover before the averages cross on the 1hr chart, or will it cause a crossover?  If it crosses down there, we see another dip, if not, we see it start to rise again.
I have been in this space for about 3 months now have never fully commuted just buying a couple of btc here and there

Considering going all in ie 10 btc I have a hunch we will see gains in the near future
Non I just make random buys/sells when I see change
Hurr durr, I read your history, checkmate Drumphie.
They have to buy them because they HAVE to return them to the exchange that lent them the coin to short in the first place.

Coins bought to cover a short go back to the exchange
So he figured out how to buy and store, but not sell? That sounds totally legit. 
Heh!

I'm working on a remake of 'A Beautiful Mind' about Nash.

The sequel is about Dr Craig Wright.

The working title is *A Beautiful Moron*

It's an Australian production.  I'm trying to get Kylie Minogue to play Roger Ver.

i can't go to the bathroom without selling everything first
- when you "open a long position" is when you buy bitcoin, say at 10k
- you should then make a "stop loss" which limits your losses. you'd say... "sell if it goes below 9.5k" 
- the atr (average true range) is a number which shows how much the price fluctuates in the last week or so

so if you open a position now at 10k, and the atr is $500 lately, you could make a stop loss at 9.5k

obviously if the price goes down to 9.5k, you've just lost $500, but it's better than watching the price drop to 6k, right?

if the price goes up to 11k, you could move your stop loss up to 10.5k, guaranteeing at least $500 profit. this is called a "trailing stop". if the price goes up to 12k, you could move your stop loss up to 11.5k 

this is one way of guaranteeing profits while limiting losses. this is like, rule zero of trading


I set a stop around 7885 when it was over 8000 and it sold while I was at work. With some quick maneuvering I was able to rebuy 10 bucks higher with a small fee. Not terrible but annoying.  I‚Äôm learning and i appreciate your insights. Thanks. 
cool, i didn't know about the API's thanks
Depends which TA experts you listen to.

A good TA expert will never say that he/she is 100% on anything. It is a game of probabilities and managing risk. As long as you are significantly more than 50% correct, you are classed as decent enough TA expert as you should be practically profitable.

If you are close to 80 to 90% correct most of the time, this is great and we should all try to listen to that person. Marius Landman is one such expert who in these circumstances cleraly said that it will not go below 6.5K and the only way is UP now. Let's see if he is correct or not over the next few weeks.

100 % correct TA never exists. It is just not possible. 
What you think TA hasn't been explored programmatically ? Without exception it's paid programs. You know why ? Cause they can't make money trading. The best example is probably autochartist. 
Takes one to know one?
You are correct. I do not troll with a hidden agenda. I simply like to shake things up in this forum. It's more fun and funnier to deal with all the painful swings which this market endures. 
Is that one of those usb things I buy at Staples?
Uh, yes. That's why I am here. I lost money already, and seem to always buy before a dip :(
Is this mainly driven by bots?
Ah, I learned something new today. 

I'm just glad I'm not a daytrader. It would break my neck.
2 minutes til 10 EST, should see a jump just after 10 as the 15 min MAs cross over.  Might take til after 10:15.
You must be new to the internet
Yeah I have a simple linear regression model and it called the climb early yesterday morning, nothing this large though. Reactionary pump right now fuelled by emotion rather than actual analysis.
Despite that, I would love to see a bull run again. 
Spoken like a true troll.   Too bad your fun times may turn some new investors away.  Guess you just like to short. 
I looked at your post history. You are just trolling me...
Wtf? How old are you kid?
When you buy crypto currency you will lose money, but if you sre losing money and coins then you are doing something wrong.
It‚Äôs driven by the buying at one price and selling back on ~$40 higher increments at the lowest (fundamental 1min) oscillation. Bots and day traders.  You can see it clearly with the bathtub that sloshes back and forth between buy and sell walls set about 40-50 points apart after a big jump.
As long as they‚Äôre able to continue making money, they‚Äôll buy at higher levels and sell at higher levels, which requires new money coming into the market to feed the traders.  When money is being taken out, the traders want to buy at lower levels and will sell at lower levels out of desperation.
I tried for six days and it made me physically sick
Cool.  Too bad I‚Äôm out of fiat or I‚Äôd put more in 
Lol I am going to buy one. I just don't know what they are or how they work. I will look into it. I like the paper one from an ATM.. but all this is still learning for me. I lost about $400 already, but I am working to save $8k to buy.
Yeah I‚Äôm all in as well, just making predictions to try to verify my hypothesis.
Reported for trolling
Not much of a bump.  Guess they‚Äôre onto you 
I think you are trolling me. I have been completely honest in fighting the trolls in this forum, arguing agains the faux lambo guys and what not. But ok.. it's unfortunate if you feel that my honesty is not what you want to hear.
Yeah, ran out of momentum after the bump on the 5m chart previously and crashed against the sell wall at 8050.
Honestly my friend, if you are asking these kinds of questions, you should not be putting money into this.  Your pursuit of knowledge is admirable.  Imagine you went to purchase a car and had absolutely no idea what an engine, wheels, and steel or aluminum were.  That is where you are right now.  Take some time and do some research. Get into the market when you are informed and you will be much happier. To make another analogy, It's like playing an instrument. The first time you pick it up you will be laughably terrible, but if you keep at it you will get a little better every day.  You need to learn how to play a few songs before you start writing your own.
