The IRS extends tax filing deadline for one day following computer problems on its busiest day

https://www.wsj.com/articles/irs-experiencing-computer-problems-1523982788?mod=e2tw
Struggled to hold 8k.... so I guess it's a good chance of falling back to 7
FOMO coming soon...
**Support The Bulls**
WTF was that?
**Bullish Outlook at the moment**
https://www.coindesk.com/8500-bitcoin-eyes-gains-with-key-support-at-7900/

**Bitcoin remains in a bullish territory for now and is looking at further gains, though a pullback is possible if support at $7,900 is breached, according to technical studies.**

The cryptocurrency's first attempt to scale the long-term descending trendline (drawn from the Dec. 17 high and Jan. 6 high) failed on Monday and prices fell below $8,000 as expected at 12:00 UTC.

It's worth noting that the Bollinger bands (seen on the chart below) show the volatility dropped after BTC dipped below the psychological mark, likely signaling indecision among the bears. As a result, it is not surprising the dip below $8,000 was short-lived.

As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,145 on Bitfinex, largely unchanged on a 24-hour basis, but could soon report further gains as the hourly Bollinger bands indicate scope for a retest of $8,400-$8,500.

And btc takes a shit again
buy when everyone sells

sell when everyone buys
But Marius said....... 
in the future 1AGI = 1BTC
Talk about obvious price manipulation.

Verge - $1.3B traded on a market cap of $1B.  It's the same coins wash traded over and over.

Most of these wash trading are through XVG/BTC.  In other words, BTC's price is artificially sustained and most of the volume is not real.

So next time anyone says there's $B of trading in BTC, think again.  It's an artificial market.
Back up to 8000? Or higher?
What ever you choose to do Bitcoin, we support you. :)
Are we Mooning guys? Or is Bitcoin playing with my emotions again.  I needz to know.
the bart simpson pattern has started again
Bart Simpson head means we will see another upward movement sell at ur own risk. 
Today is last chance to load up before take off 
We need a medic in here to stop the bleeding.
Price rise from 6.8k to 8k was all just the short squeeze. Absolutely nothing bullish about it, just too many bears. Now back down to retest 6k and likely into to the 5s
A lot of doodling around 8.1

Come on someone - this is boring.

Someone call it and make an ass of themselves.  :)
bout to rocket back to 8k. prepare for launch
There was a tiny drop back yesturday and alllll the trolls and fudsters were out but.... where dey at doe? 
great buy opportunity
It's only 7.50am in New York so we have plenty of time.  
Hey! This is my first time posting here so I'm sorry if this isn't the place for this.

I have a very low income and every cent counts. I had the idea of investing a really low amount (>30€) in a crypto currency and withdraw something like 5€/week, is this feasible? I have no interest in risking a lot of money for a chance at winning a lot or becoming rich, just a ~~low and steady~~ extra source of ~~capital~~ money.

Edit: a friend of mine is really interested in the topic and thus I understand the basics of it, but he's obsessed with becoming rich (he also doesn't have financial problems like me) and I cba to ask him for advice lol. 
[deleted]
the 1h chart is kinda similiar to that 8.3k - 7.9k drop. we need to break out 
This might be a stupid question, but what is the advantage/disadvantage of investing in a fund like GBTC instead of directly into Bitcoin?

My friend does it this way and he says he prefers it this way because it's traded on the stock exchange so it's less shady and it allows you to do it in tax advantage retirement accounts. Only downside he says is that can only trade when market is open but not a big deal if you in it for the long haul.

Is he right? Is there something else he's missing?

Best exchanges to buy some bitcoin?  
At what point, WOULD YOU ABSOLUTELY SELL? What is your 'it's too high for me not to sell' ?
And I must say, I've been going through these brokers to try find a second and third one so I'm not exposed to just one and they are crap. All of them are terrible. 
Yes, guys, we are back to the game. Just like someone said, when most people think it's going down, it's going up. lol
upwards
intriguing sh-t 
where's everybody at?
To the moon?
7800 has to stay. Next stop is 7500 then
With the 50 day still crossing the 200, the resistance is strong. RSi is high and stoch is trending down so this was inevitable 
Lots of great news. Propably some kind of fomo trying to rise the price.

Bears are weak
Looks like the Bulls are starting to wake up.....
I see the Bart Simpson patterns are back. 
That escalated quickly from $8,059 to $8,285 
So far,  tax day 2018 is acting just like tax day 2001,  uneventful.  Tax related selling didn't magically stop on April 15 2001 because  it's perfectly legal to hold off actually paying your taxes,  you just accrue penalties and interest. 

If we carry the comparison forward,  the low of the year will occur in early May,  as the reality of further tax related selling weighs on the market.  At some point the final capitulation occurs and after that the slow multi-year crawl.   

Yea,  history does repeat itself

Might want to set your stop sells a little lower next time so you don’t miss out when it bounces back. 
**Come On Bulls**
I was thinking of selling my bitcoin, but then I realized that when bitcoin goes down in value, all my altcoins go down in value. 

Don't sell low! Save the alts!

god save the king!
There was an article that Bitcoin and alt coin exchanges are under investigation in New York, causing the price to plummet.
There is **no way** this will go down far - stop panicking.

And the day traders - you should stop trying to day trade BTC - it is a 50/50 game - you are just gambling with poor stakes.
Does the news that the NY attorney general launched an investigation into the major crypto exchanges have to do with the price going down? 
Last minute selling to cover tax bills or is that too naive to believe?
And now squeeze all the shorts, please...
Haha I told you it was fake!
Can someone turn it off for about 30 seconds then turn it back on again? 
Remember just a couple days ago we were all happy it was 7700.  We are still hanging tough near 7900 after that dip, its a roller coaster ride but we are still trending up.
This is crashing to $7597 at 01:30GMT. Get out with your lives.

Im sick of this going sideways, Where are the FUD minions? We need to get this down to the 6's again!
My name is stokelycalm and I’m the biggest shorter. I see tremendous optimism in today’s daily discussion. I can’t wait until Bitcoin crashes to a $4300 bottom and all you HODLers are pissing you pants. I’ll watch panic ensue and buy lots of Bitcoin at rock bottom prices.
This cryptocurrency 2018 summer will grow 9000%. Dont miss the train. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMqMRs34_u8

Tight consolidation happening on GDAX right now. Up or down? I say down, cause it's about that time (although I'm glad to be wrong). Place your bets.
Hey fellas wanted to invite the community here to this live analysis of BTC as well as some trading, open discussion format for anyone interested.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46Hgi\-rqG4o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46Hgi-rqG4o)
We will see today of the tax deadline was really an influence in the market, but at this point we have to start considering that Bitcoin's behaviour might have changed fundamentally. We are very far behind where it was this time last year. It might be that the introduction of derivatives is having a major influence. 
You called it right on time. Good job ... I guess.
Respect.
Thanks for telling us so we can track you down!

/IRS
Good morning Ian!
@IRS Here is his wallet: 3D2oetdNuZUqQHPJmcMDDHYoqkyNVsFk9r ;)
Maybe 60k bloody dildo's over the past 4 months.
60k ?
2020
By December maybe half of that...Merry Christmas to all of us.
Funny!
No we have to wait for the HODLERS to sell so BTC can drop to $7400 then everybody on the sidelines (including me) who have some hardcore FOMO see this as a last opportunity so jump in, then you have the volume, then we can all go to the moon!
Today hodl, moon soon
you jinxed it *again* 
That seems almost certain.

EDIT: BitcoinAlways is right, it might drop a little but over it’s headed up.
Ignore the negative idiots on here, the general mood is good at the moment.
Congrats.
fellicitations the friend, already of the profits  ;-)
chill
Tyler Durden quoted you on Zerohedge https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-04-17/bitcoin-tumbles-after-mystery-whale-dumps-50-million-one-trade
Wasn’t out of nowhere. I sold this AM in anticipation.  Bought back at 7870.
Any noob can do 100x.  Is that really a wall
just another sale ;-)
Crickets? There is a goddamn battle going on right now.

Or did you mean crickets in this sub?
More like no chance.
9k$ is coming soon...
All the fiat I’m comfortable with investing is already in BTC, but here’s an upvote if that counts for anything 
That was someone trying very hard to stop the short term moving average from crossing the long term moving average on the gdax 1 day chart.  Let’s give them the collective middle finger and buy more. 
That, and the sudden spike up last week makes me wonder if there are groups coordinating their buy and sells.
Sorry I tripped on a wire
Support at $7900 breached lol. Now what?
It seems that 8k$ now is the reasonable price for btc for this time until we have new money to FOMO.
This on the heals of institutional buying, is just what the doctor ordered!

We will lose a lot of weak hands in short order.

That should make for a quick bounce, and back above 8k, without even breaking a sweat.
what did he say?
Agi will dominate the whole market, 3 years, EASY!
That’s how markets work.  Some new money comes in, pumps up the price, day traders swap it back and forth until they reach an equilibrium, then either a bunch of people throw more money in or take it out to take the price to a new level.  Over and over.  
Except Bitcoins volume yesterday was very low. 
Ah the great unknown..
I'm buying cocaine and guns thru bitcoin.
nah, that just means we are not going backward... for now I guess :)
Why? They going to stop selling crypto at midnight? Buy for less tomorrow. 
Yeah and test $0.50 and then test $0.00005.

Real numbers everyone
And the fudsters are back again. Anyone notice how it is like clockwork?  So interesting that there is so much fear on the part of the nocoiner that they spend so much time and energy trying to save their antiquated fiat loving asses.

8300 tnight
Yeah its tedious, but yet it's comforting in a way as well.  I think very soon (next hour or 2 hours at most) we are going to see a super duper candle, I don't know which color.  But I'm making my first prediction ever it's green and it will take us back up to mid 8300's within 2-3 minutes when this candle starts.  Final answer I'm locking it in.
8700+ by Friday night 
Maybe they were simply highlighting a weakness in the current rally. A balanced opinion is better than a biased one which is clearly something this sub is yet to fully understand. In fact the persistent optimism feels a lot more like desperation which to be honest doesn't really help your case for widespread adoption very much. Might be better to just shut up and let people think for themselves without forcing the words 'moon', 'hodl' and 'lambo' down their throats every five seconds.
And just for a bit of encouragement. Onassis used to sell cigarettes from a wheelbarrow. He became the richest man in the world. 
You would need about 5200€ to get a steady 5€/week assuming 5% annual return in the stock market (historically, returns have been 7%/year over long periods). Bitcoin is way too volatile to guarantee any sort of steady source of money. If you want to invest in Bitcoin, "buy and hodl" is the only reasonable strategy. 
You want to do a one time deposit of 30 euro into BTC and withdraw 5 every week while the 30 euro stays the same? Thats a 15% increase every week. Doubt that's going to happen.

Besides that, if every cent counts, don't invest in crypto's because you might as well be losing 5 buks a week.
"Steady" source of capital. Then crypto is definitively not a good pick for your need.
Actually this is very standard pump and dump on a 75-80$ price range. Zoom out and you will see one flat day with low volume so far. 
If you don't own your private keys someone could remove your access to your money.
He won't own any Bitcoin. 
Main advantage would be the ease with which he could have some exposure to btc within a tax-advantaged retirement account. But with a little footwork, he could establish a checkbook IRA with an LLC and hold any crypto or other asset on his own without paying a gigantic margin.

It's not cashing out - it's used to pump up BTC price and volume through wash trading.
Busy pumping using Verge.
Richard Heart?
Sound like you mean Richard Heart. Always has that candle next to him too lol
That's a guy you don't want to follow. Sure, he's very rarely wrong, but hates to admit he's wrong and extreme with his opinions. Also shills his shit project, and anyone challeging the project is bashed with imaginary tech he pulls out of his ass.

Edit - person you're describing is Richard Heart
Easiest is Coinbase 
GDAX. There are no fees for buying and selling when you do a limit/maker order. It's also free to transfer your btc out of GDAX to your wallet or another exchange (they pay the transfer fee).
Bitstamp
Gemini. Easiest is probably with the Cash App if you're in the US.
In all seriousness, if BTC was worth like 100k a piece, that means it's seeing huge adoption and consumer confidence is surging. I'd happily spend it, but I wouldn't convert it back to USD.
25% margin.
I will absolutely take the initial money i put as soon as I doubled. Then forget the rest.

..as inevitable as the completely unexpected 12% (1000 USD) gain in 25 minutes?

TA is meaningless in the market at this present time.
Back to bear territory? Bull run ended months ago. Don’t let the pumps fake you out. 
If 8200 was the high, the next floor is probably around 6400.
...again.
I love the smell of rekt shorters in the morning.
It smells like...victory.
GRRRRRR
Bulls not showing much strength either
not on my exchange damnit.
What exchange are you looking at
Don't see it either. You might be seeing the future here. Selling your feed ? 
I wasn't expecting a sudden bull run. But selling pressure should decline from now on...
How many more times are you going to repeat this story? :)
This is not the stock market so I’m not sure if that’s an appropriate comparison. 
FWIW, the wealthiest investors will usually go on extension and will not pay their taxes until their last extension runs out, i.e., September 15 for business entities, and October 15 for individuals. There are many reasons for this: (1) Their returns are usually much more complicated and can't be worked out quickly; (2) They usually invest in LLCs and limited partnerships, which often have their own complex returns, and thus don't crank out their Form K-1s until late August or September, (3) They like to hold on to their unpaid tax moneys for liquidity, and (4) There is a theory that goes around to the effect that the IRS in any given tax year only has the manpower to audit so many returns (which is true) and thus (this is the theory part) by the time the IRS gets to the returns late in the year their allotment of audits for that tax year have already been used up or substantially diminished, lowering the audit rate further if not eliminating it outright. BTW, this is one of the reasons that U.S. investments markets get weak in September and October (when most of the largest drops historically occur) because entities and wealthy investors are having to liquidate some positions to generate the cash to pay any tax liability they didn't estimate and pre-pay. The upshot is that the April 15 (or 17) tax day is mostly for wage-earners who are not big investors, if at all.
If so, I should be in a better spot financially to buy more. And then be prepared to dump in December.
Lol ... New York Attorney has no way of enforcing outside of well, New York.  

Yes, he can kick a fuss when the exchanges ignore him but there's absolutely nothing he can do about it.  Heck, even the SEC has no enforcement outside of America.
Plummet you say?
How is it 50/50?  You just said there is no way it will go down far...  Pick a wish and stick to it. 
Dude, most of the volume for the last 2 days are FAKE.

It's a massive pump using Verge to wash trade.  If it doesn't induce new cash inflows as intended and the pump stops, the result will be ... quite obvious.

So let's not be too certain of anything.
Ya think? Does it matter, they are just trying to get information from foreign actors. They want to be in a position to move on these exchanges if they think the exchanges are not following the rules. Notice Coinbase is not mentioned, because they are not concerned about legal activities.

We will see a nice bounce back, and rather quickly. Nothing to see here, go back to your seats, not to worry.
and I bought in literally just a few minutes before the article came out on the internet, talk about shitty timing 😫
Did you see BitMex or OKEX on that list of exchanges? 
Conbase, Bcash, pumping.  Not BTC.

 - I blame Bcash for a lot of this.
Of course this is the beginning of end.
I think naive. Must hodl
Could do with the Bulls showing some real strength tonight and getting back to $8100.
USA Dollars and UK time noice 
LoL!
Doesn't even know what bear trap is.



[–]fan_of_hakiksexydays 3 points 3 days ago
Unfortunately, I had to sell my Bitcoins because of taxes. I think a lot of people are gonna be buying again after tax day.


Someone sold low
LOL if you wanna troll, you should probably learn the difference in bear and bull trap
Already shorted at $8112.70 easy money. We're probably heading toward $2-3k range based on projections.
You mean "bull trap" but it is hard to tell, since trading is still within the channel of the last significant high of 8915 on May 23 and the most recent low of 6603 from a couple of weeks ago. It also still hasn't crossed the 90-day moving average of 8354, i.e., the market has slightly improved for bulls but is largely still mostly just waddling sideways within the high-low channel.
Meh, the price is still just waddling sideways within the high-low channel. Deal with it.
I guess you'll find them all here, but I don't know of a simple list:

https://www.reddit.com/r/lightningnetwork/
Check out [yalls.org](https://yalls.org/).
I will listen, and then make my financial decisions based upon the rap song.
So I'm venturing a guess here, but we're probably going to break to the upside for just a short period of time then eh?
You're right here. Just keep posting, I'm sure your parrots will be along shortly.
and you need to swallow a dick. should have bought at 6 like the rest of us nocoiner
and I can't wait until you lose all your money betting on the completely wrong direction and have to watch from the sidelines :(
Short hard or go home I heard some sites do 1000x leverages - just imagine how much you could make
Lmao! In your dreams. No idea what a hodler is, do you now? You can pry the bitcoin from my dead cold fingers ;P
Timmeh
Where you at cripple?
Why don’t you ask your penis?  Oh wait, nevermind... 
@Therippleeffect. Sorry if I'm too serious with this but showing the Hindenburg air disaster where people died is not suitable content for a 'Rick Roll.'  I like jokes, I'm happy to view memes or click on vids but not like that.
Amazon was just awarded a patent for streaming data marketplace of BITCOIN transactions. (US Patent 9947033)
Are people really stupid enough to fall for this shit?
Looks very much like a bear flag. So, I hate to say it, down.

Edit: aaand I was wrong again. I'm just so glad, that I'm not daytrading.
... 8x increase from last year at this time is way behind?
Doubtful. Most people with serious holdings likely filed an extension.
He probably just went to school all year.
Thought I had more than that ;-)
God bless us, everyone!
This
There will be no $7400. Maybe $7700, maybe. By Friday it will be $9000 and won't look back. 
I just wondered what would happen if I pressed this strange button. Sorry!
If I buy it drops, if I sell it goes up

Lol, always somehow end up back in profit though

Think I am addicted to this shit now, there is no way out


I can't wait to be a noob!
Clarence sale "end of life" stock
obviously I meant in the sub lol 
I'm sure he meant in the sub.
how soon?

Thanks  :) 
Institutional buyers won't catch the falling knife.
the bottom was 6.5k, it will not happen again... it is only going to go up now. this is what Marius said.
Nonsense.  There is no new money coming in.

It's wholesale collusion between the exchanges and whales (probably the same people).  They are buying/selling BTC/Verge among themselves to generate fake volume and pump up BTC price.

How else can a single coin be traded 1.3x times in 24 hours?
Trading using USD is low.

But at $7B total, it is not low.  Unfortunately, it's made up mostly of pumps using Verge and Tethers.

https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/volume/24-hour/

Ah, a wise choice indeed my good man.
They aren't illegal in some countries
Because as I have been saying(trying not to be too repetitive), the short term moving average is extremely close to crossing the long term moving average on the gdax 1 day chart.  Once this happens it should increase buying pressure significantly. 
What is the point for fudsters. They cant possibly think their comments on Reddit will sway the market. If they’re no coiners they’re just the “old man yelling at millennials” to get a fix (pissing vinegar and discouraging anything new)... I don’t get it
Lol
This isn't unreasonable, considering previous bubbles fell to just above where they began. I consider the beginning when we broke gold parity, so $1900 doesn't seem out of the question. That being said, I'm still too scared to sell all of my BTC, so I still have my never sell pile. 
I'll raise: 8500+

The charts are pregnant for a breakout.
There is usually a big buy Friday night, as the week to week paychecks buy a fraction more of BTC
Thanks a lot for the motivation kind stranger! :) 
Thanks for the numbers, that way I can almost objectively see how it's a bad idea to try it! 
Okay, thanks :)

The numbers were just approximate but I guess the point stands. 
Steady source of capital.... sounds like a job. 
Maybe that wasn't a good choice of word, what I really wanna know is if investing a really low amount could translate in earning something like 20€/month.
[deleted]
HODL is not an acronym
Yes, thank you. 
Thanks, yes that's the guy. 
Richard's advice saved me $20k in profits.
KYC verified is so long process.
Does GDAX allow my country to trade in their platform? 
I lived in Dubai.
Gemini is in NY, not a good time.
True. If you could use it to buy what you need then there is no need to convert back to usd. That’s really the ultimate goal. 
Look at the last h&s it broke upward. 
You think these whales trade blindly? 
The time it took to go up 12% is irrelevant, if it still stayed below the trend line. Data is never meaningless in any market. 
you wreaked your shorters last night huh...
But we are hodling!
I was looking at the coinmarketcap website. When I hit refresh it showed $8,285.
That's what most think,  just watch....
probably until it stops being true.
It's human beings trading an asset in both cases.  Human nature has much more to do with it than the mechanics of the actual asset.
Interesting.  If you look at the two lowest points on Nasdaq post 2000 bubble,  Oct 2001,  and Oct 2002.  That could also explain what I've attributed to people paying interest and waiting out the market.  I actually know two people who did it in 2001,  weak emperical evidence at best.  It may be a factor,  but I like your theory better.
this morning? when it dropped from 8300 to 7880 in like 20 minutes.
So you have no concept of time?

It is 50/50 day trading.

Not 50/50 long term.

Do you know anything about anything?


Rubbish.  The bulk of BTC volume is wash traded using other cryptos like Tether and now Verge.
We are getting close, one big green candle and we are right there.
If you can only list one time to be used and understood across all the nations of our planet (not just the USA) then GMT is the standard.
Whew that is a relief, I was thinking it was headed toward 1k-1.5k  range.  
Bollox alert!
Appreciate the link. 
I will do the same - i can't do any worst than I currently am.
I'm just looking at the order books on gdax, seems more pressure toward the downside for right now... but you know as well as I crypto never stays the same lol.
He'll be living in a cardboard box on a Nokia 3310 checking the price.
Bitcoin down to 7800s ... ahahahahah. So much for losing my money wrong direction bitches 
I won’t have to pry it. You will voluntarily give it up after bleeding so much. Be ahahah. Bitcoin down to $7800s.
Right here. 😘
That doesn't even make sense contextually. 😂😂😂😂😂
You're right I apologize
Ja, last year by this time we were already past the previous parabolic high. This year we still have to go 300% just to get there. We're behind. ..

We should be at about $25k already. 
Exactly. Plus there were some issues with the IRS website causing even more people to need extensions. If tax season is really pulling the price down, I expect it to continue for at least another few weeks.
That's definitely a 12 year old crypto day trader. 
Yes sir.  Blockchain tech is going to transform almost every aspect of our future.  Bitcoin is the 4 star General /Admiral  with alt coins being a mixed bag of high ranking officers to recruits. It doesn’t matter what we say or think, Bitcoin is going to be worth well over a million one day and we have to pass 30k to get there.
You make me remember end of February: There will be no $10400. Maybe $10700, maybe. By Friday it will be $12000 and won't look back. 
loke I said relax m8
Oh no, poor Clarence.
You are smart.
Roger that
Because there aren't any. It just sounds cool to these kids. What "institution" is sitting there with all this excess money saying, we are about to load up on BTC? And, what would the point be for said "institution"? To hodl? Wtf kind of plan is that for an "institution"? It's delusional. Can someone please name one of these "institutions" that is just ready to buy up these coins?
Say thanks to them then cause it needs to get some volume and atleast get to 10k so people would start buying
Interesting. So, how much do you think Bitcoin would be worth without the artificial volume and pumps? Like 5k or 1k? Or less?
So those coins are an even better deal now! What happened?
makes sense hopefully we get some fireworks this week
Could be bankers, govt officials/employees, middle men in general, etc. as well as curmudgeons. They potentially have a lot to lose when bitcoin takes over. 

Oh, and they probably try to spread their FUD all over. Not just reddit. 
We really gotta get back to 10k soon... I lost $100 so far, and would like that $100 back.
i think we will wake up to 8500... gentlemans wagerrrrr
Well I wouldn't mind having an extra "job" to earn money sitting in front of my PC.. 
no
Zoom out again, and we are in a sand box. Zoom out again, and we are in a snow globe. Zoom out again, and an alien is shaking the snow globe. 
Hang On Don’t Leggo
Says who?
Depends if they have teeth. "Most toothed whales use clicks in a series, or click train, for echolocation, while the sperm whale may produce clicks individually. Toothed whale whistles do not appear to be used in echolocation."
Don't they just spin the wheel and do whatever it lands on?
It is certainly a possibility that you are right. It would be a perfect example of a bull trap.

I'm happy either way. If it crashes, I can buy more cheap coins. If it goes up, I'm happy for the coins I already own.
:)
Yeah but one key difference is this is a global market for one main asset (bitcoin) where many are not even paying taxes.  Tax day ramifications and deferred payments may not be a big enough factor to change the momentum, which in my opinion, is now headed upwards. 
thats not a plummet baby boy
That's not what you said.  What are the odds long term?
And moon
Igy
I told you guys.. .should have listened
The orderbooks can be deceiving.
Bitcoin can go to 0. I'll still keep it. Strong supporter of the tech
and that's why it's funny
No worries.
what if i told u last year was retarded
Lol
How many times has this been posted and not happened? 
Has he got his wings yet?
Soros Fund Management gave approval to its overseer to start trading crypto in early April. Passport Capital started two crypto funds earlier this year and is seeking $150 million in funding.  A lot of crypto businesses are acquiring Wall Street executives to add legitimacy and draw the attention of traditional investors and investment firms.  We certainly have a long way to go, but I think there's more "big money" interest in crypto now than ever before.  
Think again - shorts have increased during the same pump period.

Why are you so sure that it's not the same group setting themselves up for another windfall by cutting the pump and crashing BTC later?
No idea, mate.  I think the important points are (a) concentration of ownership remains high (whales) and (b) unregulated exchanges.

As long as these two points remain true, price of BTC will not collapse.

a couple of whales dumped.  The line hasn't crossed yet.  We'll see what happens when it crosses.
It SHOULD make sense but the last time the one day kissed it the bottom fell out ...3k drop....guess were gonna find out soon
It's all of the above
Quite a conspiracy!  Keep going!  This is fun. 
I lost 70,000 on paper :)

It will be back!  Don't worry.
So you are willing to sit in front of your pc for 20 pounds a month. You don't really value your time do you?  Go back to school, get a real job.
Okay thanks :) 
Hold on to dead life
Everyone who knows where it originated from ?
yea I have no idea how to factor that in,  on the one hand the effect is limited to some percentage of the whole market,  but on the other hand that market is so thinly traded,  that trends in a small percentage of the market can move the whole market.  I think it's a wash TBH.
Just a gas leak in the pump, all fixed
A long view is not the same as a short term view.

A short term view will be increasingly randomised the shorter the term.

I know it will get cold in winter; but that's not the same as gambling on a temperature increase within the next hour - on any day, winter or summer.
Nonsense.
that they can be, RSI plays a big role too... just observe and act, all we can do.
I don't care if it was or not. Fact is this time last year we were already making new ATH's, nearly every single day. We're at least 300% away from that and that's not going to happen in a month or two unless this lot explodes. 
17 no's and one yes equals yes.
So basically you are saying people will buy cheap coins. 
That’s because there was major FUD happening last time, including fears that the mt gox trustee was selling large amounts.  If not for all that happening at once we’d probably have crossed 12k  
Reminds me of slimey little worms, crawling out of the rotten woodwork, looking for scraps to eat
I do try not to be boring. 


ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED???  IS THIS NOT WHY YOU ARE HERE???  🤣
It's hard to convince people that an alternative currency (which is technically anti-government) is the right thing to do. Banks will be all over it.
You're browsing reddit, should I tell you how to spend your time? Jesus fuck people are sometimes so dumb. Also, you know nothing about me and I didn't ask how to improve my formation. Go back to life and learn it's basics.

Tell me how successful your life was/is 39 y/o redditor.
it could, if you can continuously trade successfully and make enough to get past all the fee's trading on the margin.

this is however, an extremely risky approach and its sounds like even in low volume, you'd be gambling more than you can afford to loose. -and there's a damn good chance you will loose, especially if your new.

there are other ways to get a head start in a dead economy but they involve the sale of that which may require jail time.

just go fill out surveys kid!
Except you can't base your prediction on historical data in this gamble...
why do u need it to do what it did last year that would be boring...let btc do its thing homie
I would if I had any fiat left. 
Major FUD. I know I'm going to be for Halloween!
I feel successful, but I'm not content, and I'm finishing my nurse praticioners licence. I'm getting paid to browse reddit in between patients. You looked at all my comments, you can see what I do for a living. No reason to get salty. You want a steady stream of 5 pounds a week, go get a job. 
You asking for shit advice on how to get a stream of 5 pounds a week on a 20 pound investment? And I'm the one that needs to learn it's basics. Your parents owe society an apology. 
D... Dad?

Jokes apart, What do you mean by filling out surveys?

And thanks a lot for the insight, I guess my idea wasn't as good as I though! :) 
Last year it was going up at least. This year so far it's barely budged. I think I prefer last year. It wasn't boring no. This is. 
That sucks. Bills come first. 
Calm down man. Not everyone is fortunate enough and am sure you'd agree, we can be a lil patient with new folks. He ain't asking for money, is he
if you're absolutely desperate for income, and there are no jobs what so ever, you can make a small amount of money by filling out surveys for companies. it wont be worth your time, but if all you would be doing with that time is jacking off anyway, it could be worth looking into.

Also, I'm glad I didn't wear the condom that night...son. :)
Did you expect bitcoin to repeat 2017 every year? Were you expecting 100k bitcoin this year
He asked me to tell him how successful I am/was/is.... so I did. And I would agree that success is what you make it. I worked (and so did my wife) hard as hell to get where I/we are today. My mom didn't help me, I signed up for the military to pay for my schooling. I literally signed my life away for a chance to go to college that wouldn't financially cripple my mother. Any person over 18 (and under in some cases) can do exactly what I did. No luck, just hard work. Some people aren't willing to do that. That guy, is one of those people. 
I'll add to that.... there is a serious shortage in nursing right now, and it's not getting better. Our population is aging, and we need good people healthcare. If you want a pretty good paying job, get an LPN license, it's cake work (pass meds, run to a random code), but the hours can be long. But you can make 60k per year easy. Want to make more? Get your RN. Work in a hospital, get specialized. Want even more? Get your BSN, work in a hospital, and manage nurses or get into teaching (with your MSN). Want to double that? Get your nurse practitioners licence. Then you can do simple surgeries, open a practice, get into family medicine, be a PCP. The sky is the limit with that bad boy.
Okay, thanks. I'll give it a try :)
At some point it's going to reach a maximum value, but I do expect at least a few years of crazy still. I don't know how long it will last. But a repeat of 2017 is very likely. 

So yeah I do think there will be repetition for a while, certainly $100k is possible, but of course if it did what it did last year we will see $400k by Dec. 

Which is still low compared to some of the other targets.
