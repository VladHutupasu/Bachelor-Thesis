Daily Discussion, April 07, 2018 -- TITLE
After extensive research of about two minutes. I have concluded that the whales are trying to make a 2D platform game. Look at the last 24 hour. Tell me that doesn't look like a Super Mario level.
Trolls, they mostly come at night, mostly.
To anyone thinking Soros authorizing his portfolio managers to trade crypto currency is automatically bullish, I encourage you to look up the trade he is most famous for...
772 Bitcoins traded in that spike on GDAX.

Ah, the Daily Thread. The best source of pure, unrefined FUD and autistic screeching about how terrible bitcoin is and how we should all feel bad for having anything to do with it.




The real test is trying to get past 7.5k, which was the previous high. If it doesn't get past 7.5k, then it's another failed attempted like last time, and so many other times.
Wait, is MrManHimself still posting on here? I blocked him yesterday for spouting the same unsubstantiated negativity over and over and over and over.....While he thinks what he is posting is very clever and insightful, all that he is doing is spreading FUD and using "brilliant" hindsight to try and prove his point. I have never seen anyone with so little of a life before. If bitcoin dies, I will move on with my life, go do something else. This poor basement dweller spends hours on this sub, trolling and spreading FUD for all he is worth. All he is managing to do is showing that he is actually a poor sodd that lost his shirt with bitcoin and he is so scared that anyone else can be successful. So scared bitcoin will go to the moon, he cannot go on with life. All he has ever done was ask for proof or ask "what do you really mean by saying this or that". Not one valid point ever, not 1 shred of proof for what he is sprouting except: bitcoin did this and bitcoin done that", ignoring the fact that bitcoin also did GREAT in the past. I advice everyone to block him. The peace from silencing him is worth at least 20 bitcoin. Don't bother trying to reply to me MrJokeOfTheSub, I will not see it anyway. NOTE: r/bitcoin: a community dedicated to bitcoin. If you do not believe in bitcoin, then go away, we do, and no amount of trolling or FUD from you will change that. Side Note: I am truly sorry for your financial loss, but how about giving others a chance?

Edit: spelling
I like how everyone just assumes there is going to be a breakout and the thought of a stagnant price not being a possibility. It seems like a large group of this subreddit expects that the price should and will be rising by thousands per month. I'm convinced that most people here know very little about how any of this works and likely bought in months ago while the price was higher.

How many times has it been now during this drawn out downward spiral where, we see a brief upswing, and everyone comes out of hiding saying "we've hit bottom! 6900 has major support!!!11!. If it breaks through though, it will hit even large support at 6400. If it breaks through 7k then it will continue up until 11k." ? People are really pulling this all out of their ass.
>Mods, please ban immediately

u/MrManHimself is WunderBaah.
We may actually push through 7k.

Interesting.
I promise you someone here was taking a shower when the price pumped. It always reverses direction when one of us are in the shower. They love phucing with us. Lol
How about a $1000 increase every month.  So around $15k by December.....
Somebody give me a xanax, we are back under 7k.  I'm freaking out over here.  Hopefully the extended release version.  
If people can stop selling from prices $7k to 7500 will be fine;) 
Such a low volume. The last months this was an Indicator for a drop coming. Lets see what happens 
Going Down to $6650 to complete bart simpson on the hourly
Does anybody have any experience accepting bitcoin at their business or paying in crypto at a local small business?  And if so do you know if its easy for the Business owner to convert to Fiat?  And any idea what the fee's are associated with accepting crypto and converting to Fiat ?  
Careful guys, this might be a trap.
good girl
i dont trust this shit, $6.5k again tomorrow.

There's something fishy going on. I've been watching the charts for the whole day. Then, when I had to do some shopping for a few minutes, the price shoots up.

It's always like this. I kid you not!
Could be because of this anti-FUD regarding India?

Bitcoin’s 24 volume on coinmarketcap is only 3.6B USD which is quite low, and is only around 3% of bitcoin’s total marketcap (116B right now). What does this mean in terms of price fluctuations ? Is it a good thing ? 
What was that?

Holding above 7k.

This is the Soros effect (publicity & endorsement) - whether you like it or not.

And being a clever man, Soros will build BTC, not destroy it.
The price is slowly going down, which is usually a good sign for another pump coming. Whereas the price slowly going up is a sign for an incoming dump...

Really just the opposite of what one would expect...

how secure is the protection of a password protected electrum wallet?, can upload to a remote server?
Anyone got any hypothesis on why BTC is still hovering after the 6.5k crash?  

This seems very different from previous crashes (10k on 17 Jan, 6k on 2 Feb, 7.5k on 10 Mar).  In all these previous crashes, BTC recovered very quickly.

Any guesses will be appreciated.
Fuck these last few days, it's anyone's guess. Impossible to trade, if we break 6900 we should be going back down for a bit, if we beak 7100 we're going up. But neither of these has any support it's just flat lining. I do believe that we are just about through this bear market tho.
I went to a show called Drunk Shakespeare in NYC last night. They improv throughout and at one point an actor used a joke about value disappearing and referred to Bitcoin. This reminds me of mainstream mania at the top, but the opposite

Alright, tax season is over. Let's start this up again. We see there a Bitcoincash now. That has to go. It confuses new users. One thing I realized is that US customers is all that matters with regard to price. Refunds are coming now and if the community cares about the future they will keep it simple and easy rather than needing a computer science degree to operate. We see lightning is coming on but without uers, whats the point to scale? These hardforks need to stop now. Mistakes were made and passions ran high but lets move on and ignore the 8/1 fork and move on with 2nd layer. We need better interfaces. Coinbase hurt the market more than anythingby allowing bitcoin cash on its services. If they keep allowing hard forks, no one will invest. There is one bitcoin. adding blocks is just centralizing miners to have more power. Coinbase would be wise to get ride of bitcoin cash and any future hard forks. Enough ideology of the free market will decide. The free market are uneducated and we are just confusing new users. Enough. Apologize, remove it, focus on adoption and ease of use and lets go. This year will be the last time the current generation gives bitcoin a second look. 2 weeks all.... enough of editors allowing FUD. Lets get this right in the next month and take back the years lost that bitcoin cash and coinbase cost us. Get to work.

A breakout happening now? https://youtu.be/4WyukZ6oYgA
Watch out guys, now that Soros wants in, I wouldnt be surprised if he hires people to spread fud online and then short the price.
I think Bitcoin will fall below 6000. 
The Sun literally just came out from the clouds at my house and then i checked the priced - could be a good day...
Any predictions on the weekend dip?
Bit of a speculative question but wondering if any of you guys have had this before...Trying to sell my Bitcoin on Bitpay. When I click on Coinbase and Sell then put in the amount it says "Connecting to Coinbase" then "Error. Unknown error" and won't connect. Also, when I try to buy Bitcoin it says "Error. The access token is invalid." I have bought and sold many times this way previously. Any ideas what's going on?

Why do Bitbugs think Bitcoin replacing the current fiat system would be better. Have you seen the concentration of wealth that Bitcoin has among the top 100 wallets?? The world would be bought for and controlled by chink miners.
"Doublethink lies at the very heart of Hodl, since the essential act of r/Bitcoin is to use conscious deception while retaining the firmness of purpose that goes with complete honesty. To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact that has become inconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary again, to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed, to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one denies-- all this is indispensably necessary. Even in using the word *doublethink* it is necessary to exercise *doublethink.* For by using the word one admits that one is tampering with reality; by a fresh act of *doublethink* one erases this knowledge; and so on indefinitely, with the lie always ahead of the truth."

**URGENT PUBLIC-SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT: REGARDING 23 APRIL**

*From:* https://www.inc.com/business-insider/stripe-no-longer-accepts-bitcoin-payments-goobye-april-23.html

"Stripe, the $9 billion online payments company, is putting an end to the product that enabled retailers to accept bitcoin as payment.

Citing a decrease in use by both retailers and customers, Stripe said will wind down support for its bitcoin payment application and stop processing bitcoin payments entirely on April 23.

"**Empirically, there are fewer and fewer use cases for which accepting or paying with Bitcoin makes sense**," Stripe product manager Tom Karlo wrote in the announcement. 

When Stripe first enabled bitcoin payment process in 2014, advocates for the cryptocurrency believed that it could be a cheaper than credit cards like Visa, which charge seller-side customers a fee on top of each transaction, and more accessible to people in part of the world without banks or stable currencies. 

"Our hope was that Bitcoin could become a universal, decentralized substrate for online transactions and help our customers enable buyers in places that had less credit card penetration or use cases where credit card fees were prohibitive," Karlo wrote in the blog entry. 

*That hope, it turns out, was misplaced*."

**END OF PSA**

**URGENT PUBLIC-SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT: UNDERSTANDING LIMITATIONS OF BITCOIN**

*Borrowed from*: http://www.scmp.com/week-asia/opinion/article/2122500/why-bitcoin-fever-bubble-waiting-burst

The cleverness of the underlying technology doesn’t mean that bitcoin is viable as a form of money. And it certainly doesn’t mean that the legions of punters rushing to buy bitcoin as an investment for the future can be confident of earning superior returns, or indeed any returns at all.

Enthusiasts like bitcoins because their supply is limited. The pace at which bitcoin “miners” can create new units automatically declines over time, with the maximum possible number of bitcoins fixed at 21 million. To converts, that limit means that bitcoins, unlike the fiat currencies issued by the world’s central banks, can never be debased by governments intent on printing as much money as it takes to pay off their debts.

Yet despite their scarcity, bitcoins possess no intrinsic value. Unlike hard commodities – copper, say, or even gold – bitcoins have no utility value. And unlike securities such as bonds or stocks, bitcoins do not carry the promise of a future cash flow that allows investors to put a hard figure on their value today.

Bitcoin enthusiasts argue that much the same can be said for fiat currencies. With interest rates around the world close to zero or even negative, conventional currencies also offer no income streams, and hence carry no real value. They are nothing more than an illusion, a confidence trick perpetrated by cynical governments on their gullible populations.

But that argument misses a crucial point. Fiat currencies do have an inherent value. The US dollar, for example, has value because the US government insists that Americans must pay their taxes in US dollars. And if they fail to pay their taxes, the US government will send them to jail (unless, of course, they are rich enough to employ expensive accountants and lawyers to devise legal tax dodges). That threat creates an underlying demand for US dollars which lends the currency a real value.

Without similar backing from a government, bitcoin lacks any inherent value. Yet even if it were to win the status of legal tender, bitcoin would still have critical drawbacks. In particular, the very factor that enthusiasts like most about the cryptocurrency – its limited supply – ensures it will never replace conventional currencies as a widely-used form of money. That is because if the supply of a currency is limited, and the quantity of goods and services in the economy grows, it follows that the price of those goods and services in that currency must fall. And if prices are falling, businesspeople become increasingly reluctant to borrow to invest, because they would have to sell ever more stuff to service their debt. But with falling prices, customers defer their purchases, which means selling stuff gets ever harder.

In short, the widespread adoption of bitcoin as a means of exchange, unit of account and store of value would depress demand and discourage investment, leading to economic stagnation and a rising real burden of debt. It would be a disaster.

Bitcoin could still have a useful future as a specialist means of exchange for internet transactions. However, no one is currently using it for that purpose. Instead it has become a vehicle purely for momentum-based speculation. But with no intrinsic value to support prices, and with alternative cryptocurrencies springing up by the hundred and threatening to negate the very scarcity that is touted as bitcoin’s chief virtue, the bubble that last week propelled the price of bitcoins to a record high is clearly unsustainable.

**Read it again.  Carefully**
S.S.D.D
Hi everybody, I have a question about the time of transactions. I've sent a little amout of bitcoins on some website, the website says that my bitcoins will be credited after 2 confirms, is anyone knows how long would it take now? And is there any services that helps me to to estimate the transaction rate and time, cause I used to send money by stellar, and thinking about using credits blockchain with the fastest tps, however I'm dealing with bitcoins now. thank you.
Oh look! America is awake.

Nice film reference
it is hard to define "night" since members of this reddit group basically cover all world time zones :)

For those too lazy to look it up, Soros apparently made a billion dollars in one trade by shorting the British pound. 
I'm an atheist, but that man is the devil himself
agreed, I don’t see a person that vehemently slams crypto having a 180 thought revolution unless he can make his money and fuck everything else. 
Sadly, there are quite a few who believe that his involvement (which is yet to be confirmed) would be a confirmation that bitcoin has a great future.   I have just had an exchange in which I vainly tried to explain to some fellow that it is possible to make money from something that is going (or predicted to go) to the dogs.
Crypto's is as good a vehicle as any to bet against the dollar. I don't think anybody sees dollar strength for years to come, so hopefully that's his bet.  
Where can i See than trade, Thanks
on gdax its so funny watching this shiiiaaat :D
you take that back, everyone here is a saint.
Ever tried one of those online autism tests? - I did the other day and got a bit of a shock :)
the war begin xD
But the real, real test is trying to get past 12k, which was the previous high.

Then, the real real real test is trying to get past 19k, which was the previous high.
seems uptrend started coz btc also reject to go bellow 6400$
The bears are exhausted from all the selling action we may make it this time . Go Bulls !
The highs keep getting lower.  So forget 7.5K.
this essay makes it a little hard to believe you do have a life 
Excellent point, the guy is best ignored.  
Yep, he's trolling along with plenty of time on his hands. My guess is that he has already sold his stack since he is constantly begging for another chance to buy back at a lower price. It would be hilarious if he wasn't able to buy back in without a decent loss.
Do you mean spouting, or sprouting?

You need an editor.
It will be interesting to see how MrManHimself responds to this post. 
> Wait, is MrManHimself still posting on here? I blocked him yesterday for spouting the same unsubstantiated negativity over and over and over and over.

You blocked him yesterday, but yet here you are, reading his clever and insightful comments (but not "gettin"  them) and writing at length about him.  You aren't very bright, are you?

> Don't bother trying to reply to me MrJokeOfTheSub, I will not see it anyway.

That's funny.   That's the sort of thing angry high-school kids say to each other while knowing full well that they will be reading.

MrManHimself seems to have got you really excited.   Perhaps too excited, judging by your long, vulgar rant.   That can't possibly be good for your health.    Try to find some means of relaxation.   Perhaps some weed and a wench for a bit of in-out/in-out?  Or something.   Good luck, friend!
Have you looked at it on a chart ? It could carry on for months, but last time this happened it took out the last highs in less than a year. It's already been 4 months since the move down started, momentum is fading for shorts, in fact we couldn't get to $6000 again. So if history repeats itself we should start heading up now and take out $20k before the end of the year. Because that's what happened last time.

So no it's not coming out of the ass, it's just looking at what's happened before and thus is the most likely to happen again. 
> stagnant price

lol!

Hopefully it will be less volatile in a few years, but right now there are not enough market participants to even each other out. And there's too much money to be made in a volitile market.
> everyone just assumes there is going to be a breakout

Nobody I've talked to says that.

You're starting with a false premise.
Observation today : bears seems determined to not let it go over 7K for long but they're losing momentum (not as easy to really push it down as a few months ago). Just my two cents, out of my ass.
I bought at 6.5K and sort of pissed that we are back to square 1.
The quilt guy ?
I’ve been wondering what happened to him, he’s too anti-FUD to be mrman though lol 
Can I ready those "It's over 9k" memes for the third time?

I actually was too but there are around 10k people and it is a Saturday morning so I suppose it isn't anything special. 
Especially if they were having thoughts pertaining to puberty.
You might need some opiates. I don't believe the bears are done yet...
A small dip in the day in nothing to worry about.  I'm worried about you, you might fold under questioning.
Some people have to sell and make money from the pump.   But not to worry.   The rest can make use of the opportunity to buy the dip, accumulate more coins, daily-cost average, etc.  All win-win.
Things will get worse, and then they will get better. Then the cycle continues.
Another day, another 12 reports that bitcoin will rise and another 12 reports bitcoin will fall.
Nobody uses bitcoins to pay for any real good and services.   They are more like gambling tokens in a casino.    So you won't  get any answers, I'm afraid.
A sweet, sweet trap. I enjoy watching it.
as always, this is just crap :D

I always like the ancient Egyptian references in trading analysis.

little late :D its been like few minutes xD
Nah.  There will be no U-bend blocker this time.
The press release said that his fund will be "trading", which is different, and to me at least indicates short-term attempts to make money off the highs and lows.
*sells more to trigger you*
Tech investor Tim Draper, whose recent re-entry to India’s market was prompted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s promise to crackdown on corruption, nevertheless criticized India’s negative stance on cryptocurrencies during an interview with The Economic Times published yesterday, April 6.

Draper had returned to the Indian market in February 2017 - having exited it in 2016 due to a perceived lack of “rule of law” prompting Draper Fisher Jurvetson to sell their entire Indian portfolio - when the Mumbai-based startup backer Blume Ventures joined the Draper Venture Network.

India’s central bank had announced on April 5 that they would no longer deal with crypto-related accounts - not the direct government ban on crypto which had been falsely rumoured in early February. India’s Ministry of Finance had also criticized cryptocurrency as a “Ponzi scheme” without “intrinsic value” at the beginning of January.

Despite his positive outlook on Modi’s ability to stamp out corruption, Draper calls the Indian government’s denial of cryptocurrency as valid tender as “the stupidest thing,” also referencing China’s similar stance:

“If I had a meeting with Modi, I would have let him know he is making a huge mistake.”

Draper notes that “Bitcoin and [B]lockchain are the best things to have happened for business,” adding that “countries such as India, where billions of rupees are wasted on inefficiencies and needless paperwork, will benefit most from the ease and security of blockchain.” If India makes cryptocurrency illegal, then, according to Draper, “other countries will raise their hands to get all the [Indian Blockchain] entrepreneurs:”

“If the local authorities are banning crypto, then companies in the space should move elsewhere. The government needs to realize that it is stifling innovation and should instead be creating an environment where these ideas can be tested and promoted. They have the choice to be trendsetters and attract the world’s best engineers and coders, or lose their best and brightest to other regions.”

Draper, who is a Bitcoin (BTC) enthusiast, said during the interview that Bitcoin “should be the national currency” of India, for Draper believes that its “global” nature and ability to store value will make it “acceptable everywhere for transactions” in a few years.

Draper also spoke about the potential for Blockchain to “roc[k] the venture capital business,” creating a competitive virtual environment where only the “flexible and reinvent[ive]” will be successful:

“Down the road, you won’t have to physically leave a place to choose a better government. From wherever I am, I can get social security from Chile, healthcare insurance from Canada, education from Russia. The whole system will be much more virtual.”

In regards to investments in future Indian Blockchain and crypto startups, Draper mentioned that Blume Ventures and Boost VC had co-invested in Unocoin, and that he will “continue to seek other opportunities.”

One of Unocoin’s co-founders, Sathvik Vishwanath, had said earlier this week that the central bank has not taken the “right direction” in regards to cryptocurrencies, citing that the bank’s ban will “cause panic among a few million people in India who are already using [cryptocurrencies.]”
Some bears got rekt.
People with agendas use thin markets to push things around. Best to wait till there's good volumes going to see what's really going on. 


China bans bitcoin.
"Pump" is the first part of "Pump and Dump". Pump up the price with small positions, short the whatever with large positions, and then dump the small positions and try to create downward momentum and panic selling. It's an old, old game, which persists because it is usually pretty successful. BTW, in a regulated market it is illegal (at least in theory) as "market manipulation", which of course it is.
Probably not. 

But then again, what I've learned from watching the charts for the past months: 

If it does the same thing three times in a row, it will do something different the fourth time...
I love Trading Analysis.

It makes so much sense when applied to BTC.

And, of course, people who understand it love to give away their secrets - rather than becoming rich themselves..

I'm not going to jump to a conclusion about a potential Soros effect. To be honest I am not a fan of the man but he is certainly intelligent so I expect that he has hired talented traders for his funds, regardless of investments.
These last few weeks have been the accumulation phase for Soros and many others.  Accumulate when the price is relatively low and then disperse your stack when the price gets high.  
Why would you want to do that? You can create the same wallet on different computers.
If you do that you're going to get hacked. I also get the impression you're not using 2FA, you got some serious opsec lessons to learn boy.

If you're reasonably comfortable with command line have a look at zenbot and gekko trading bots.

I've paper traded with them for a couple of months, they're an excellent way to halve your gains and double your losses.

They won't make you money dude. They are only good for whales to keep volume going. They serve no other purpose. There are some like Profit Trailer that only helps you earn a few bucks here and there IF the market is good but you would make even more by holding in a good market so no point. 
If bots were guaranteed to make money then wouldn’t everyone use them?
I want my time back!
MrManHimself joined on the same day. 
I think not. 
Yep.   Should be there by late June.
Hope so. Want to see it at below 3000. Then you can make big profits.
It's been so weird. Yesterday hovering around $6600 for nigh on 24 hours. Now at the $6850 mark. It *seems* like there are people playing with the market so I wouldn't be surprised to see another mini pump to $7500 but who knows?!
I predict...that my prediction will be wrong.
Its the weekend so most of the manipulators are off.  When Soros is asleep, buy the sink.
Access token invalid usually has to do with 2fa and the timestamps not being synced.

Bitcoin is not *per se* against rich people. Just against banks.

BTW, most of the top 100 wallets are exchanges, not persons.
I don’t think that Bitcoin will replace fiat, but a crypto currency WILL back a global currency. (I believe this is China’s next power play)

Still unknown how far the currency aspect of Bitcoin will go, there’s certainly credibility for it as use for digital goods/services over fiat - no intermediary services required. Just look at how silkroad became so successful.

Anyway, store of value is where Bitcoin is right now, many will disagree and also use it as a negative for Bitcoin, but it’s fact (IMHO)

It doesn't matter , it's all gonna ride on the lightning network, Bitcoin by itself will never be mass adopted for payments
whats your take on big players like Soros just trading the market and not giving a shit about the Asset itself.  For example they can just play the game of it going down $100 or up $100 all day and make bank doing that
This is why I hate myself for thinking about pride every day
Yes, I do.  It's going nowhere.

Actually no, I don't think everyone's opinion is welcome. Some days ago some of my posts didn't show up at all and they were merely critical about that ridiculous 'cartel' conspiracy narrative without being offensive. And each of those posts were posted only once. While I think /r/bitcoin is far better than /r/btc, there's still room for improvement.
[pokes with the stick from a distance]

Are you a troll ? 
This is a very timely and appropriate warning.  We have too much in repetitions about hodling and why it is good, reviews of bitcoin history, same stuff about volume and support and "what will happen today", the alleged bright future of bitcoin, and so on.    Do we need all these repetitions clogging up reddit and taking up our bandwidth?  I don't think so.
Tidy your room.

>But that argument misses a crucial point. Fiat currencies do have an inherent value. The US dollar, for example, has value because the US government insists that Americans must pay their taxes in US dollars. And if they fail to pay their taxes, the US government will send them to jail (unless, of course, they are rich enough to employ expensive accountants and lawyers to devise legal tax dodges). That threat creates an underlying demand for US dollars which lends the currency a real value.

I find it very unlikely that taxation is what creates "inherent value" for fiat currencies. Taxation means there's some need for that particular currency, but no evidence is shared that argues that that need is what drives the value. 

For example, consider the United Arab Emirates. There is no income tax and, until recently, no VAT either. Government spending was done through the money raised for oil. Yet they still had a functioning fiat currency. According to your argument here, this should be impossible.

The reason this is possible is because currency gets its value from what others are willing to give up to get it. Taxation may create some small amount of demand, but it is not the only source of demand, and is not a necessary component of demand.

>Without similar backing from a government, bitcoin lacks any inherent value. Yet even if it were to win the status of legal tender, bitcoin would still have critical drawbacks. In particular, the very factor that enthusiasts like most about the cryptocurrency – its limited supply – ensures it will never replace conventional currencies as a widely-used form of money. That is because if the supply of a currency is limited, and the quantity of goods and services in the economy grows, it follows that the price of those goods and services in that currency must fall. And if prices are falling, businesspeople become increasingly reluctant to borrow to invest, because they would have to sell ever more stuff to service their debt. But with falling prices, customers defer their purchases, which means selling stuff gets ever harder.

Your scenario here doesn't really seem to make sense - as you said, bitcoin would increase in value as the quantity (and quality) of goods and services for sale grows. If this leads to a high level of deflation that discourages investment broadly speaking, then the quantity and quality of goods and services for sale would no longer 
be growing. The deflation rate should be tied to the productive capacity of the global economy, which means that is should reach some sort of balance - if it's growing really quickly, investment is discouraged, if it's shrinking, investment is encouraged.
I agree with most of these points. But a couple of critical points are left out. I believe Arizona just passed a law that you can pay taxes in BTC. Bitcoin is a world accepted form of currency I believe the first. When people around here tote the line “that you are your own bank” in the bigger picture I believe that it is a way to fight back against the central authorities. To give people the sovereign right to keep them, in-line a check. Now, speculation the artificial belief that BTC is going to save the world and this and that. Its a completely fabricated illusion and as it was stated to me yesterday by another reddit user. This is purely about business.
......also I might add. Really, the intrinsic value of BTC is in the person holding it and the person willing to buy it. It’s people. Now, greed is an original human behavior and THAT is what will drive it to the ground.

That could be seen as semi pro-bitcoin. Bad Mr Man, Bad!
What in the actual fuck are you talking about. No one sees dollar strength in a 4% unemployment, rising rate environment that already has contained inflation??? Also, why don’t you just just trade direct currencies/futures if that’s your play? If your bet is specifically against the dollar there are a ton of other much more efficient ways to do that. There’s one reason and one reason only he’s involved: it’s a massively inefficient market that creates short term trading opportunities.

Shorters shitting their pants, nothing better in this game
I tried one of those tests recently and it seems I am in the vicinity of bordering mild autism territory. Not that I was shocked. If I had made the same test 20 years ago I would have scored pretty high. Still trying to figure out if a lower autism score is necessarily an improvement. :D If you work with programming, graphics and other detail- and perception oriented fields where a high degree of independence is a plus, it's possibly a benefit, within reasonable limits.
Then, the real real real real test is trying to get past 1 million in 2020. 
Been reading his posts for days, while on this sub, looking for true insight, just finally got tired of his posts. I still believe in BTC, so yes, I spend a fair amount of time here, and the essay, took 10 minutes to type. So except for the failed attempt to put me off, any other insights to Bitcoin perhaps? Do you have something meaningful to add to the sub?
Indeed. 
Not trolling, friend.  Just presenting reality as it is, by way of doing the community some service.   His hard facts are yet to be countered in a logical and evidence-based way.   The response so far has been just an excess of emotion, which is not helpful matters.
My apologies, English is my 3rd language, how many language do you speak?
MrManHimself's response to the disturbed fellow is given above.   I hope he can find some way to cope with the, admittedly, rather painful facts that must be put forth.   Clearly, just "blocking" MrManHimself is not working for him.
the plot thickens!

History won’t repeat itself in the same way. It will be a lot harder to get the same amount of new money as last time.
Sure, it's wildely volatile, but over a larger picture it could remain at a relatively flat price. I'm not saying money can't be made on tbe day to day swings. Good for you and whoever else that has been successful at doing that. And lol at those that think everyone should be helplessly holding for the long run.
We need the quilt guy.  

It's his Mom and friends who have been supporting all the buy walls.
He is just helping his mom transporting the quilts and convincing the unionville town’s brothel to start accepting bitcoins.

I bet 0.01 Bitcoin against you. 

What is considered a breakout to settle the bet?
Right, Soros is likely busy with other matters of affairs and the people responsible for his trading funds will likely have relatively strict guidelines, at least that would be my assumption.
My thoughts are, he said what he said about it being a bubble, while it sold off he was setting up to buy. I think if he does buy it won't be short term, but rather long based on a philosophical stance on it. But of course I am only speculating.

The market is not impressed...
Many here are not very bright and also have extremely short memories.   See the excitement over the "above 7000!"?   Happens every week.   And in between, tears as the thing goes down.   

Further, people fail to see a very important trend: in all the down-and-ups, the tops of the ups keep getting lower. From 12K to  11K to 10K to 9K ...  in just the last couple of months.

Nah. I doubt that anyone would pay MrManHimself to do any kind of related work, since I don't think he would be profitable enough. He's more likely just a speculator on the market that attempt to make profits from shorts, while urging newcomers to sell at suboptimal prices for his own benefit. All while telling people he wants to help them from the kindness of his heart.
It's just my intuition. Do you think that it'd going to rise ?

My Boss wants to get rid of his Bitcoin bc he believes it is heading for much lower levels...rightly or wrongly...I said pay me in Bitcoin this month and I'll liquidate same as I always do...Now I'm stuck with it and none too happy! I don't want to get caught holding the Bitcoin at the end of the day, regardless of whether it goes up or down, I just want my wages in my Bank asap!

So there is a Server time sync issue between Bitpay and Coinbase and that's stopping transactions at this time?
Just watch the video, it’s very appropriate for this sub
I like your consistency 
Man it's so hard to get these things right
I'd say that it's a possibility that we'll see 6.6k-6.8k whenever the current peak is discovered. After that point however it's far harder to make certain predictions. Also there may be some surprises along the way since whales generally enjoy disrupting past patterns. Just don't be too comfortable in your certainties.
Wouldn’t exchanges just be the new banks?

How's Silk Road and its founder doing these days?   Some success.

If you don't mind your supposedly stored value swinging up and down in such a wild manner that you can't financially plan for even a few days ahead.
ok 
While this post is already 14 hours old, it is still one of the more entertaining comments today.
You seem to think I'm saying that Bitcoin is a bubble and that Bitcoin believers are delusional, and that Bitcoin will collapse, or something. Actually I did publicly predict that Bitcoin would fall below $10k back at $12k, as did in fact many experts and others, so the idea that nothing is predictable except in hindsight is not exactly true. But I wasn't trying to make a bearish statement with this post, actually the opposite.

What I can tell you from my personal experience with hodl is that it is a form of self-deception, a willing blindness to logic and reason. What I can also tell you is that it made me a lot of money and I am going to keep doing it. If logic and reason will lead you astray, you must blind yourself to them. You must exercise doublethink. Just as the party makes its own truth in 1984, hodlers will make their own truth by hodling. 


That is what is called refreshing.     Some will have forgotten, and the day will soon be here.
Lightning network is going to be a huge disappointment.    The technical issues will be clear soon enough.   But the real issue is that the bitcoin community insists on focusing on clever technical "solutions"---LN, SegWit, this or that wallet, etc----that have nothing to do with the fundamental problems that detract from real use of bitcoin.   
> trading the market and not giving a shit about the Asset itself

There's hardly any big money player that gives a flying fuck about Bitcoin. They are in it to make money. 

Most ppl in general are trading Bitcoin to make actual money. Because that's all it is for now. A get rich quick scheme.

You think they give a shit about hodling ? Using it as currency lol? About decentralized? None of those things matter. It's a basic pump and dump

Get in low, ride it to +50% or whatever profit range you had in mind and leave a winner.

That's what happened on that bullshit manipulated ride up to 19k. Big money pushed it up and sold the fuck out. It would have a sustained move up if they actually believed in "hodling"

Only fools are hodling. The minute you are in a decent profit range, cash the fuck out. 

Don't care about no damn future use as a currency, as a decentralized tool, etc etc. Ppl just wanna make money. Could care less about the morals of this asset lol. 
You can't make money at the scale of Soros with that kind of trading, that's just peanuts to them. 
Not sure other then if people can see an opportunity to make money they will try and get in on it. 
Gay pride?🏳️‍🌈
Sometimes I wonder what makes a cunt like you tick, then I realize I don’t care.

This is a daily discussion page.  It is for the moderators to decide what is appropriate.

The writer limits his example to US dollars.  I see no reason to believe that it is necessarily to be extended to any and all currencies.   

Still, let us consider this.   Let us suppose that the US dollar has value for the reasons given by the author.  And according to you, that does not apply to the United Arab Emirates dirham because "no tax until ... revenue from oil ...".

Here is a question: what is the (mostly) standard currency for trading in oil?  **What currency have the sheiks been taking for their oil for all these years?  Why?**  The UAE dirham is not a free-floating currency; it is pegged to the dollar.   Why? What do you think would happen to the UAE currency if  USD tanked?

> Your scenario here doesn't really seem to make sense 

As indicated above, I did not write that.  But let me try and take a *guess* at what the author is alluding to: contrary to what bitcoin zealots think, "limited volume of money" is ultimately a disaster; and we know that from past "experiments".  Indeed, one of the most important jobs of a central bank is to periodically adjust the money supply---increase it or reduce it, as appropriate.   There is for example, the idea that the 2008 economic disaster was "the result of printing too much money, which is why we need something like bitcoin.  Actually, not quite.  "Printing" (or "quantitative easing", as the Federal Reserve called it) was actually the solution!

Bitcoin cannot function as, say a national currency, precisely because the volume is limited.   And when the author states that *"if the supply of a currency is limited, and the quantity of goods and services in the economy grows, it follows that the price of those goods and services in that currency must fall"*, my guess is that with a limited volume of money, prices in an expanding economy must literally become smaller---for the very simple reason that there is only so much money to be divided all around.
> I believe Arizona just passed a law that you can pay taxes in BTC. 

You should have read beyond the headlines and the misguided excitement of the bitcoin zealots.  What was passed was only first-stage legislation.   Know how much legislation reaches that stage and then goes nowhere?   

> Bitcoin is a world accepted form of currency I believe the first.

People around the world certainly use it for speculation and criminal activities, but it is definitely not a form of currency.  Nor will it ever become "a world accepted form of currency".  

> “that you are your own bank” in the bigger picture I believe that it is a way to fight back against the central authorities.

The only people who care about such things are criminals, social misfits and teenage geeks in parents' basement.   All others are not into fighting governments and banks and what-not; in fact they rely a great deal on such institutions.    Even those who are here daily yelling about how they will hodl because they are in it for the tech and what-not are really just after one thing: government-issued money (i.e. real money) in a government-regulated bank (real bank).   That's the  planned end-game for all.
I’m teasing. It just seems that when it’s been a good day here in the Far East America sells off all the gains when they wake up.
Accepting bitcoin for payment is a real hassle for business and one with zero advantages; a few places try it as a curiosity that they hope will bring in some new business, but they quickly give up in despair.      That is why bitcoin will never really function as a currency or money.

He uses his wealth to ruin countries and bets against the country. His NGO's are currently importing all the migrants to Europe. In effect he is busy destroying Europe. A lot of people don't like that. 
I see no reason to debate the issue with you.  There is plenty of information available to those with eyes to see.
Soros is a good man.  It is mostly right-wing nut-jobs who hate him.   
Correction, he is a self-made holocaust enabler.
Dollars role as a reserve currency is about to end. And I've had this inflation debate a few times now here. I just have to go buy a small bag of crisps to see the inflation. You'll be lucky if there's 5 pieces in there. We're on the cusp of 1930's type event. A global hyper-inflationary depression. 

There is a ton of ways ja, and none of them are coming close to what the crypto's are doing. How much is gold up in the last 3 years and how much are the crypto's up in dollar terms ? 
My score was heavily skewed by the fact that I am rather solitary and don't particularly need or want to be in social groups :)

In other words, while I don't look at car number plates and see crazy mathematical patterns - I just don't like talking to people - heh heh.

Nevertheless, I am apparently on the spectrum.  :)

There.  Fixed that for you.
I dont think so. Goldbergger was a clear troll who admittedly trolled. His posts were also very short.

MrManHimself ( for Godsake can you shorten your name somehow MrManHimself?), is more detailed who, I would say writes a more clear and detailed answer. He is very much like wunderbaah, the quilt guy. 
Who is Goldberger?
It might not repeat, but it will rhyme...

It's not about new money. It's about what the current holders of the money think the value is. It doesn't take just new money to send it up, it takes the current holders to decide the value is too low I don't sell at this level. 

The more it goes up the less likely current holders are to sell. Everyone watching Bitcoin knows its low. There's a few short sellers but they are getting less and less convinced as you can see by the slow down in downwards momentum. And in fact Friday there was a big short cover as you can see by the jump. 

So now as we start hitting the levels going up more and more people are going to cover driving the price up and less and less will be selling, they'll be holding out for higher prices. 

And we have the next leg up. And historically it will be maybe 1000%, maybe 2000% up. I think you'll find sellers thin on the ground once it's confirmed we've turned. I think that will be at $12 000

Heh.
Yes.  It was rubbish.
 ~20% or more change in price within the next 7 days of this post? idk.
Busy doing what?
The fact that hes said (and probably still believes) that it is a bubble is unrelated to his making money off it.   Nothing to do with a "philosophical stance". Think about this: who really makes the big money in a bubble?   A few smart people, or the final bag-holders?

I don't know what his plans are, but I'd be surprised if they were long term (in the sense of "hodling").    My guess that he will, if he indeed does go in, stay long enough to make his money and then get out before the bubble bursts.   
 “Down the road, you won’t have to physically leave a place to choose a better government. From wherever I am, I can get social security from Chile, healthcare insurance from Canada, education from Russia. The whole system will be much more virtual.”  I never thought about this possibility.  I can't even begin to comprehend how awesome it would be but at the same time I'd be surprised if governments allowed it.  Exciting times to be living through this
I took this screenshot some 6 hours ago at Bitfinex:

https://i.imgur.com/hg9JTAW.jpg

While the 4 x 400 stacks of bitcoin in the bids section of the orderbook earlier today may have been a bluff in the sense that the cash owner might not use his wealth anytime soon, I did see a stack of 100 bitcoin eat up a fall earlier today, until it was pulled to let the footsoldiers do the rest of the buying. Some whales will be bluffing in the orderbooks but overall there have been some great poker-game quality action with interesting fall-reversals and odd tricks.
Is it ever?
I actually have to agree with this butthole here. Lol
Buy moar.

Btw, how is Lisk doing?
And they're going to sell it to you for $20 so you can make mega bucks forever ? 

No mate, do the work. Learn how to code, essential life skill anyway. And become independent along the way. Most brokers offers REST API's now days. Nothing teaches you the details of what's going like having to explain it to a computer. That's when you really learn.

He's pretending to be the man hence, Mr Man Himself.
I honestly don’t think it’ll go there. But in the wild west anything can happen.
>  I just want my wages in my Bank asap!

Lesson learned.  Next time don't listen to the "be your own bank!" crap.    Take fiat, to a real bank.
Well if you really want to be a pro, buy at 20k, sell at 5.9k.
$6.6K is coming within a few days.  I am 100% certain.
No, because you don't need them to exchange value.
You are right, banking has a rich history and is more than just providing loans.
Yep.  But the bitcoin zealots will never see that.   They keep talking about P2P even as exchanges are raking it in from the larger and larger numbers that rely on them.   

Oh, and what can these "new banks" really compete on the services currently offered by the "old banks"?
Sorry, didn't really explain much as I was typing from my smartphone.

>Really? How many of the very few merchants that supposedly take bitcoin actually rely in intermediaries to promptly exchange it to fiat?

It's about choices, for us in the west, I'ts not really a problem using third party services to process our transactions - we can afford it. The true power is YOU are your own bank and processor (or atleast the network that you are part of is). Where the likes of PayPal may take high fees, or cause problems with chargebacks, YOU have more control.

>How's Silk Road and its founder doing these days? Some success.

Silkroad died because the owner was stupid enough to link his dark web identity to his real world identity - but that irreverent. Again, the desire to process you own payments is very powerful and it means governments CANT stop you - even if it was made illegal.

>If you don't mind your supposedly stored value swinging up and down in such a wild manner that you can't financially plan for even a few days ahead.

Store of value is not the same as being immune to inflation/deflation. It means that if you have 1BTC, It cant be taken away from you because of its fixed supply, immutability and cryptographic keys.
So are you saying that the hodl strategy made you a lot of money or you did the opposite? 
Hodl was a brilliant strategy for over 8 years, it was a terrible one over the last 3 months. 
The day where you finally admit how retarded you sound around here even with the trolling? I'll wait. We all have the time to wait. We have long time preferences here if you haven't notice yet.
Well if someone has never seen the article how is that refreshing. It would be considered New to them. Stop the Fud before I call "Fudbusters"
100% agree with you that the speculative phase precedes the adoption phase.  and this market is a traders wet dream.  But wouldn't you agree then or that logically they will pump up once again pass 19k and then another crazy crash?  I imagine theres more money to be made if it bubbles again versus either going sideways for 1-2 years or even bringing it lower.  But if they do bring it lower i feel like it will still pump up pass 19k
ahh good point.  so he needs to make it pass ATH's, have a huge FOMO event and then shit gonna get crazy?
Mods, please ban immediately for abusive and vulgar language!   Thanks!
Heh.  The list of Mods is down the side of the page..

I respect these boards, and if the mods tell me off - fair enough - I will always comply.  

But I won't have trolls telling us what to post.
Then how would you remove posts?
Fair enough, someone said he is wunderbaah, the quilt guy.
I dare you to kick me out
Who is "we".  You and your imaginary friend?
Your knowledge of Scandinavian folk tales is as lacking as your knowledge of cryptocurrencies.
bro you is cray
>The writer limits his example to US dollars. I see no reason to believe that it is necessarily to be extended to any and all currencies.

Well, that's the claim that was being made. If the argument is just that "US dollars derive their value from being taxed, while this is not true for other currencies", then it's not really relevant for Bitcoin, is it?

The claim was:
>But that argument misses a crucial point. Fiat currencies do have an inherent value. The US dollar, for example, has value because the US government insists that Americans must pay their taxes in US dollars.

I provided an example where this wasn't true - a fiat currency that did not get inherent value from being needed for tax.

If the argument is that fiat currencies gain their value because there is a demand that exists for them... this is true for Bitcoin too. The argument that fiat has some sort of inherent value that bitcoin doesn't is wrong. There may be some base level of demand for fiat currencies for taxes, but this isn't where most of their value comes from.

>Here is a question: what is the (mostly) standard currency for trading in oil? What currency have the sheiks been taking for their oil for all these years? Why? What do you think would happen to the UAW currency if USD tanked?

This has nothing to do with whether Bitcoin has inherent value or not. For a while, the US dollar has been acting as the world's reserve currency. 

I don't know what would happen to the UAW currency if the USD tanked. I think it would depend on the reason for it tanking. If a weak USD indicated a general slowdown in the US economy, decreasing global demand for oil, it would go down, presumably. If the weak USD was due to some other reason, then it's possible it wouldn't affect it so much.

> "limited volume of money" is ultimately a disaster; and we know that from past "experiments"

I'm not aware of disastrous experiments that clearly show problems due to the fixed supply of currency, rather than other problems that have traditionally accompanied it (challenges with the divisibility of currency, or sticky wages, for example).

I agree that in a Bitcoin-only world, monetary policy is no longer a tool that governments could use. I don't think we'd ever end up in a Bitcoin-only world. If we did, governments would have to rely on fiscal policy to the extent that they want to impact the economies of their citizens.
Tell that to the 3.5 billion people underbanked/without banks

Bitcoin is for them to join the global economy
yeah, well I respectfully disagree with some of those points. But lets see there are certain points that I do agree with. Mostly from the original post. That wasn’t written by you.
[deleted]
Please troll better. We can see through your flawed Keneysian economics.
Seen the "moon"-"lambo" types around lately?  Probably not.  People are beginning to realize that BTC is slowly but surely going to the dogs.   Plenty of bad attitudes all around.
Sorry for your loss.
Except none of that is, like, true? His NGO’s generally support free speech and anti discrimination/xenophobia efforts across Europe and the United States. He’s not ‘importing’ anyone... mostly he is just funding social studies and higher education. 

I’m not sure what you mean by betting against a country. Trading against unsustainable monetary policy (if you are referring to the British pound trade) isn’t a moral stance for or against anyone. 
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/george-soros-ss-nazi-germany/

It takes all of three seconds to realize that’s a lie. I really didn’t set out to defend this guy here but it irks me how just devastatingly incorrect you all are...
If dollar's role as a reserve currency ends, it's the end of the American economy (which is fuelled by debt).  We are talking hyperscale inflation, recession and massive increase in unemployment.

I wish you wouldn't make such suggestions lightly.
Right, that's the independence factor which puts people into the autism spectrum even though we don't memorize meaningless strings of numbers or see crazy patterns everywhere. If you are used to focus on details and analyzing structures this benefits you in many lines of work. The problem with the strongest autists, if I may speculate, is that they may not be able to have the self-control in order to distinguish between that which is useful and purposeful and that which is not. Although if well channeled, they could be successful writers among other things.
Lol.....I know, but I enjoy seeing everyone's true opinions ( not just plain old FUD), what they get from their charts, links they post that has insight to bitcoin related matters, etc. ;)

Edit: spelling
There is nothing fundamentally wrong with "preaching absolute deterministic outcomes for the future", if they are based on sold facts and deep and broad analysis.
You are right, of course. He just got under my skin, thinking of all the people he might talk into selling at a loss by playing on their fears. This a sub for discussions around bitcoin, not for people who wants nothing to do with bitcoin, like he pretends to be.
He claims he did the blocking yesterday.   But here he is today, totally agitated and ranting away like like a man possessed.   
wunderbaah, on the other hand, offered some nicely tailored stories. MrManHimself doesn't seem to be capable of that.

Maybe he is just himself.
Real name: Mann Himsel. Shortening it would be like taking off a piece of my worthy "member."    I hope you can see the point.

These are very serious matters, and, accordingly, we endeavor to be clear, detailed, and logical.   

No relationship to "wunderbaah, the quilt guy".   Is he too a really splendid fellow, like MrManHimself? 
Your brother from another mother.
...and that's why I love you. Hodlers are the backbone of our infrastructure. without those sexy beasts like you, all we really have is a bubble.
I liked him. He had some good stories.
It must get a bit cold under that bridge.
Wont happen. Same shit as wallstreet bonusses
I was more thinking about what will happen in the next few hours...

If it goes below 6800 you win. Above 7100, I win.
He's as old as the Dodo, don't expect him to personally be sitting in front of a screen trading.
being a billionaire 
Based on his philosophy and theory of reactivity, I think he is setting up a position in favor of it at this time and in the long run, using his statement as game tactics.
That scares me for more reasons than I care to list.
(Which is none)
The vulgar language is not helpful.  Please mend your ways.   Thank you.
Horrible like every other coin lmao it’s depressing 
[deleted]
Sorry, I didn't catch where we had a disagreement regarding the fact that he is trolling.
Not trying to be my own Bank just doing my Boss a favour bc I thought I could sell BTC immediately as has previously been the case...suffice it to say this is the last favour I do for him bc this is pathetic! Just waiting for feedback from Bitpay who don't work weekends and Coinbase who quoted 5 biz days before a reply but could be indefinite due to workload! The tech and support provided by these exchanges are too overwhelmed by the demands placed upon them clearly! 
Cool, show us a screen of you 100x leverage on a short call or stfu. 
Sounds like a decent possibility. I'll leave it to the market to decide.
> Store of value is not the same as being immune to inflation/deflation. It means that if you have 1BTC, It cant be taken away from you because of its fixed supply, immutability and cryptographic keys.

I will skip the rest of your obvious misunderstandings, but this one is too huge to ignore.  "Store of value", is a standard term, means pretty much what it says and your "re-definition" is bizarre.   Sample this:

*A store of value is the function of an asset that can be saved, retrieved and exchanged at a later time, and be predictably useful when retrieved. More generally, a store of value is anything that retains purchasing power into the future.*

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Store_of_value

See if you can relate bitcoins wild volatility to "predictably useful when retrieved".    Perhaps a "contra-example" will help you.   Right now, I have $10 in my pocket; in a week I will go to KFC and there use my $10 to get same type of meal that I got today; both KFC and I can rely on $10 having pretty much the same value next week that it does now.   Same thing with all other transactions, e.g. rent, utilities, etc.  Why is my monthly rent a fixed number dollars for the next 18 months?  Because my landlords can generally rely on what he will be able to do with a fixed number of dollars over the next 18 months.  Store of value.

On the other hand, nobody can count on what one can do with bitcoin on a weekly basis.  Not even on a daily basis.   And fixed supply, immutability and cryptographic keys are of absolutely no help in that regard.

Both. I hodled until I didn't. 

I'm still a huge bull though for the long term, and being a Bitcoin bull means ignoring certain tricky questions by eloquent well-spoken people.
Stock indexing doesn't always beat active trading, but it's still a much better strategy for 99% of people. It is much less stressful and much easier to do. And it works better on average. I believe the same about hodl vs. timing the market.
Alright, we'll wait.   In the meantime we can go back to the charts and watch BTC sinking into oblivion while the sheeple repeatedly miss what is happening with each pump-and-dump.    
If someone has already seen the article, then it is re-freshing, which is important given the "action" date.   If not, then it is fresh.   In either case, my contribution is a valuable public service.
It's too volatile to predict. Who knows if there will be as many big money pumpers as last time on the ride to 19k...maybe it run out of gas at 12k this time and they leave.

It's definitely a traders market right now. Even in stock. Volatile markets across the board. Those caught simply trying to time a swing trade can get burned easily so be careful.

Don't hold and be greedy with profits. If this dumpsters to 4-5k and you wanna swing it. Go.for it. Just don't say I'm gonna wait till 19k! I'd take profits and run even at 10k. You'll neveer be sad with profits

Those that said BTFD at 12k are getting royally fucked. The first drop is never the floor lol. There's always plenty of room to fall. Just be patient for an entry and don't be greedy on your exit

Roger ver?
The mods will remove the posts.
Dude, they talk in the same way and they troll in the same fashion.
I'm telling you, "the quilt guy" was a roll play troll pro Bitcoin.

Now he's come back pretending to be "the man".
Well I commend your commitment to the act.

Trolling in character as "the man". Actually haven't seen that one before.
[deleted]
yes.
No, I am not Cray.  
Try and use your head once in a while.  How and where are they going to get the bitcoins?   
You really should think a bit before you rush to the keyboard.   By way of encouraging you, let me give you just a small example: in order to receive BTC payment in that wallet, a business must calculate a fiat price in BTC.   Why, because it is fiat that is the real money; that is how he pays his suppliers, for utilities, rent, etc.   Now, how often does, say BTC/USD price change?  The never-ending cries of anguish on the "Daily Discussion" thread should give you an idea.   Then you have the whole business of having to wait for confirmations and what-not.   Are you starting to get the idea?   Good.   

Thinking of using third parties to ease the pain?   Sample this:

**Stripe, the $9 billion online payments company, is putting an end to the product that enabled retailers to accept bitcoin as payment.**
.....
**Citing a decrease in use by both retailers and customers, Stripe said will wind down support for its bitcoin payment application and stop processing bitcoin payments entirely on April 23.**
https://www.inc.com/business-insider/stripe-no-longer-accepts-bitcoin-payments-goobye-april-23.html

Now, go off and finish your homework.


> Please troll better. We can see through your flawed Keneysian economics.

Oh, in that case I better switch to **Keynesian** economics!
Yeah, on a reddit sub com because that is really what changes the momentum. 
He admitted Nazi collaboration out of his own mouth. The internet is your friend. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9tKvasRO54
It is true that I can spend hours, days, thinking about mathematical problems, and trying to visualise them in my mind (I have a maths physics approach, rather than a pure maths one.)

But these are real problems - not just strings of numbers.

So if that trait puts me on the spectrum, well tough - it just means I use my brain in a way that a lot of people don't.
Yes, but the 10 minutes to write what is essentially “ignore trolls” and addressing a person who won’t see it gives the impression of not having a life. I’m just messing with you lol 
The future hasn't happened yet, that's why a nuanced approach is generally preferred. Add the minor matter that you haven't provided any solid facts yet, except proclamations.
It is indeed a sub about bitcoin.  But why should that be limited to misguided propaganda, "moon!/lambo" nonsense, etc., especially when it is clearly evident that the whole thing is going to the dogs?   
It's all part of the ribald and energetic daily discussion.  Without others like him we wouldn't know about quilts :)
I know. Wunderbaah also pretended to be bullish and here this MrManHimself is a FUD
He was splendid in his own world, very much like yourself. 

Next time you make a new ID, would you like to use a simple short name ? Your this name is not very convenient to type. 
what about those charts? you know, 12k?
We are all brothers, my friend.  And what I am trying to do here is save my brothers from inevitable calamity.
Not really.  The heat from my computing system keeps me warm.
Actually more chance it will than Wall Street bonuses, if some people took some profit from the recent high , then got slugged with a tax bill, cashing some more out now to cover the bill is very possible. Not saying this is the cause just a very real scenario.
There likely won't be much change within the next few hours. I think 7 days is pretty convincing when you look at how stable it's been lately. 

I am convinced however, that the price will be lower than now in the next 7 days. Will it go up a few times before then? Probably yes.
That's complex. You'd have to do exactly all the things you have to do with a sophisticated bot. Call a list of orders, modify them, design the interface.  To code something like that is a lot of work. 

Bitfinex (who do batch orders) has done some of that for you so they can get the revenue from the trades, but if you want more you'd probably have to pay for it or do it yourself. 

Can't we just argue the same point like we're on Facebook?
Does anyone believe this is an issue which I can fix myself? I have cleared Cache and restarted phone and app. I'm guessing its an issue with them not me but I could be wrong
Sucking up to the boss is always to be recommended, but not at the risk of losing your pay.
"stfu"?   Please mind your language.  Ask politely, and I may show ... 
>While these items may be inconvenient to trade daily or store, and may vary in value quite significantly, they rarely lose all value. It need not be a capital asset at all, merely have economic value that is not known to disappear even in the worst situation. The disadvantage for land, houses and property as a store for value is that it may take time to find a buyer for those assets.[6] In principle, this could be true of any industrial commodity, but gold and precious metals are generally favored, because of their demand and rarity in nature, which reduces the risk of devaluation associated with increased production and supply.

Further down the page on the same article. 
The only problem is that BTC is finally, slowly heading to its real value, which is near-zero.  In such a case, neither hodling nor timing is very smart.  The best thing to do is to get out.
Well its better to state that you are refreshing or repost an old article. Because if not you can cause panic and spread fud.
Well, I had not seen this article before, so its new to me.  So, thank you for posting, MrMan.  January 23 is new enough for me.
i agree with your perspective but think there are too many forces at play outside of simply making money to stop the train from passing 19k again. Thats like saying Bitcoin is Dead - yet again.  It should of died a long time ago, especially after Mt. Gox but it didn't.  Its stronger than ever.  But that being said, i will be taking profits here and there.  Perhaps when it comes back the harder decision will be when to take profits.  Lets say it passes 19k, goes to 30k and you take profits, then it pulls back and goes to 50k.  The game is going to get crazy
Are you aware that advising the Mods is against the rules of this board?

In attempting to tell your community how to behave, you are breaking clear rules yourself.

Anyway, I shall write nothing more on the matter.
He's the man, maaaannn
Please don't be insulting; I am no troll.   What I am stating are hard facts, given as a publicly announced warning.   I realize that some will not like such hard truths, but they are.     Sensible people act now will thank me later; the rest will shed bitter tears.
If we let them join the global economy maybe they can do something that someone somewhere will think is valuable to them ans they will get BTC. 

Maybe you should be the one using your head..... 
Have you eaten all the meds that the nurse gave you yet?
We have the typing police here too. Oh boy am i scared lol. What are you going to punish me with? What a sad life you lead.
He admitted to trying to fucking survive as a child in a regime that wanted to exterminate him. Not whatever bullshit you posted

Edit: just as a psa the above video is an ad for a book called The Big Lie , The Nazi Roots of The American Left. Just so everyone knows what kind of nut job this asshole is
Right. And there are also times where solving a particular problem won't necessarily give any immediate benefit, while down the line it may result in unexpected, positive results.
Lol...good point. :D
The sun will rise tomorrow.   I think I may state that just like that, without a "nuanced approach".   What I present about bitcoin is no different. 
MrManHimself has nothing to do with FUD.   His is simply a mission of truth, reality, and cautionary warnings to those who are about to get fleeced.
>  would you like to use a simple short name ? Your this name is not very convenient to type. 

I won't do that, as it would confuse my numerous followers.   If you need something shorter to type, just use "Oracle", which is what many of my followers use in p.m.
Huh?
I won't bet on the next 7 days.

But we can bet like this: Whereever it goes first, no matter when.

7100, I win.
6800, you win.
Ok. I won't bet on the next 7 days.
Haha :D
Dude that Mr man guy is a psychotic shill for JP Morgan. Just laugh and don't engage.

I commend you for accepting your paycheck in Bitcoin. Cheapest way to sell is on gdax, just go there, apparently you already have a coinbase account which means you have a gdax account.

If you sell at a price slightly above or below market price, that will make you a "maker" and you'll pay no fees
Yes.  Note that these are things that "are not money".   So I take it we are in agreement that bitcoin is not money?   Second, none of the things in that category can be compared with bitcoin.   Take a look at the examples.   Which of this is similar to bitcoin in its wild volatility? 

Bitcoin belongs to what the rest of the article deals with:

"**Speculative instruments are not stores of value**. *They may "have value" when purchased, but are not "a reasonably stable store of future value". As mentioned above, the key to defining if an asset can be considered a store of value, is that it can predictably retain purchasing power into the future*.

*At various times throughout history, people and nations have famously made the mistake of believing that they could "store value" in speculative instruments, misunderstanding that* **ones personal choice to invest in a speculative asset does not automatically convert that asset into a proper and predictable store of value**."

Bitcoin is the "famous example" of our times, and it will all end rather badly, as have all other "examples".
I think it would be helpful if the mods could attach a troll badge to characters such as MrManSuxHimself so that newbs wouldn’t fall for his antics. 
False.
Ok, I will behave now :) 
Would they be 'bitter tears' of laughter?
[deleted]
I take it you don't care much for the hard cold facts of reality?
LOL!    How about you just stick to things you know and understand?  OK, friend?

I get huge satisfaction from eventually seeing a result.  I'm on holiday at the moment, and there are 2 areas I've figured out, to a lot of satisfaction.  

This could easily be misdiagnosed crudely as autism (although I don't mind.)  For example, I can't remember dates or phone numbers - so the mental activity isn't narrow or trivial. 

Interesting.
What a sad life you have to be working as a troll during the weekends.
I wouldn't bet if it were like that because it would just be based on sheer luck cause the price flunctuates regardless if the market is failing or not.

But I would say it will reach 7500 or more before crashing back down below 6000
Good. You're a smart man. (or woman)
Yours is a fine example of what is commonly known as a "bad attitude".  
Quite possibly.  The insane have been known to laugh even while crying bitterly.   That will be the hodlers.
Can't make any sense of what you just wrote.   Please learn to write properly.
How about you just stick to the coloring books okay?
Your username alone should preclude anyone from taking you seriously
If you are in the spectrum as a result of being a strong individualist, there's no reason why you can't consider both details and a wider picture. Both perspectives relies on similar skills. Yup, I will remember numbers for as long as I need, generally about 5 seconds. Photographic memory is not in my book.
You don't like what I write?
> Next breakout

Then you didn't understand OP. We had 3 breakouts in the past 24 hours.
Looks like you were wise to chicken out on the bet..it hit 7100 on gdax a bit ago.
You’re getting a little repetitive in your comebacks. Alzheimer’s get ya already? 
Now why would a 1200% return make me cry?
I sorry, I don't engage with trolls of the intellect of a Neanderthal
It's off cause I don't think this forum condones gambling and I don't think the price will drop that low within the next few hours; I already said that the price will probably go up like two times because the price fluctuates so quickly and my hunch think it's due for another increase in price anyways.

I am only convinced that the price will be lower than the price right at this moment 7 days later. Not going to bet on it anymore but if I had to hypothetically, I would bet at most $50.
I said before that the price fluctuates too quickly to make it a convincing bet, which is why I am more confident in waiting 7 days to see the result. It may be 7100 now and it may even reach 7500 very soon but I think that this is only temporary and the price will continue to decline in the coming days since it's been like this for months. I don't want to bet on something that takes only luck to find out.
No, not yet.
With such words, you will never make friends or influence people.      Try and improve your attitude!

By the way, who were you "engaging with" when you responded to my comment?
lol!
Don't take it seriously I was just joking with ya man, just wanted to point out it would have been a loosing bet.

I agree, if we break 7200 and hold, we should see some solid gains. But right now it's a damn toss up as far as I can tell.
