Daily Discussion, April 24, 2018 -- TITLE
Out of interest is there any reason the DD threads aren't being stickied anymore? It is such a pain to have to search for!

Shout out to all the HODLers out there.  
Who would have thought that Bitcoin could recover from a 70% drop after it has only done that a couple of times before?
Someone said this on this forum....**"There is no better anti-depressant than Bitcoin when it's rising"**  :)
Fuck it went all in this morning (UK) wish me luck

Go big or go home lol
I am now above even. Yay!
I bought and lost 500 dollars right away...
I'm laughing my ass off at all of the "TA guys" on Trading View. Gotta love Bitcoin and its unpredictability. 
HODLing to those gains after buying in at the 6k low has never felt sweeter 👌
We are well past the cock gobble resistance line. Macaffee is on target to not have to cannibalize his own cock on TV. 


boom! 

$9300 broken.
If anything I think Tom Lee's hypothesis that tax selling was keeping the price down was mostly correct. The slow rise of the price now is just the normal market movement where the number of buyers > number of sellers. As long as there is no major fud I think the price will continue to slowly rise.
Good morning everyone, just got to work and saw we have passed the $9,300 mark. Very nice to see, next resistance/test level at $9,800. Keep hodling especially with the upcoming meeting which we'll see big money come into the crypto space.
Woke up on the East coast to BTC @ $9,300. Good morning on the up and up! 
anyone else thinking we are gaining too fast?
New ATH this year?
I am broke until payday and the fomo so bad right now. It's over £6700! By my estimations we've recovered nearly half the value which was lost since early March!
9400 is going to be hard to crack
9400 on GDAX!
Looking good.

Where's that falling to 6k chap gone?
Anyone else can't take their eyes off GDAX price charts the last hour? We broke 3 major walls since 7PM EST.
No biggie.  People cashing out because it hit a certain number.  It’ll go right back up.. momentum is there.  And yes, this is just my opinion, not based on anything else.
**Come On Bulls, keep fighting!**
My TA friends

What does forecast look like today ?
Im pretty happy the way this board is run.

No spam from shitcoiners. 

/r/cryptocurrency seems to be infested with marketing companies. Its awful.
So BTC was hovering around the 8.9K mark for the last several days, unable to punch through 9K.  Then it happens today.  Any specific news that is helping today's run?
[deleted]
Is bitcoin ready for a bull run? 


Or will fees explode like last time? 
9.4!!!
To me it looks like $12k by Friday or Saturday. 
I noticed that Bcash has been pumped hard lately. Is Ver really that desperate?
Not cool asia
I've drawn some lines on a graph, and also noticed we've only gained 20% so far this week.  That means we're still definitely in a bear market, crash is imminent and we're heading to 4k. 


Ignore the fact that I've got a massive short position and I'm desperately hoping the market will fall.  That doesn't invalidate my expert analysis in any way.

 - Every TA expert on this sub. 
Remember those who said bitcoin died? lol
I just checked the log chart for the first time in a long time. 

Even there we have clearly broken out of the downtrend.

The bears have been defeated.

Profitssssss
Bit of resistance at $9330.  Lets knock it down. 
How safe is the electrum wallet nowadays? 
It started... :D 
Good morning. How's everyone doing today?
I  fomo oh gosh :\( 
https://cryptowat.ch/markets/bitfinex/btc/usd/1m

What a strange battle that was.
anyone else setting aside a set percentage of your income to buy BTC?
buying more baby
I wonder where this xyz123 shorter guy is now?
**Hopefully another Asian push coming up tonight.**
Amazing how far we’ve come in a few weeks.  I’m finally ahead in my crypto portfolio!!! 
New A.T.H. 
/
thoughts ?
Guys...what am I supposed to do with my hands in these exciting times
This reminds me of Mt.Gox day
Well that was a shit show last night
Goodnight everyone. See you when us Americans awaken to try to keep it about even for another pump from Asia. I love you Asia.
**Keep going Bulls.**
Alright guys, not much time left to get yourself 4 figure btc, don't miss out on your likely last chance in history of being able to get it this low
and here we go a red dildooo 
**Support The Bulls.**
Funny thing is: I just can't imagine where all the money is coming from right now to push the price up. 

The "common folks" are out for now. They dropped their bags near 6k and are licking their wounds. They will fomo back in at a much higher price.

The hodlers (like me) already invested as much as they could.

Then there are short term traders, who tethered a lot, but I don't believe they will have enough power to sustain a run like this.

Who's left? Institutional money?

edit: Why the downvotes? This is an honest question. And a request for discussion.
So it's been a great day in Asia here today. What is America going to do when they wake up?
Tons of volume on LB and off site trading. Love the crypto booms when they happen 
We look so oversold actually. Ive 400$ on the sideline. Waiting for a dip. Well. Somehow it doesnt happen haha
Butter my arse!
That buying pressure is a beautiful thing to see :)

edit: trying to resist against 20 BTC + 30 BTC sell orders on GDAX...
Tiny dump to $9,200 which was expected since we can't always keep going up. (correction taking place)
We are going to be stuck at current price levels for a few days. That gives everyone some time to check their couch cushions for anything you can put towards btc. I'm currently in the process of selling my winter beater(my 2nd car) and all that money is going into btc. Let's go bulls!
Sure, but if your are long 19k may not be considered expensive if you believe the price will go way higher up. 
I see consolidation, for another big pop
I recommend you doing what you are comfortable with. Invest what are you comfortable with losing. It’s all personal preference. 
sometimes when i load back in to exchange its on 15m and i almost spit out my coffee; use to looking at 6 or 1 hour hahahaha
Loving this price movement the last few days. January-April 12 felt like a test of our collective patience. Can't imagine what it was like in those years when the price didn't move for 8-10 months.
https://cryptowat.ch/markets/bitfinex/btc/usd/1m

Some really intense action today
[deleted]
$300 drops in 5 mins, lol then back up
I'll start: Oh no guys. How low do you think it will go? Market manipulation. Pure market manipulation! (Totally silent on that point while it was bullish BTW) As soon as it hits 13k again I'm out! At least there's strong support at $50.
What is considered a good volume for Bitcoin?
Tested 9.8k and we failed. Drop to 9.2k necessary now. Everything is fine. New run now 
Possible Batman forming on the 1 hour?
**Come On Bulls, keep fighting!**
welp the EU is making a bit of a mess today...
We need to keep this at a reasonable level until the Americans wake up. 
Now pamp eet
Do you know that you can earn as make as much as 9.9 BTC weekly simply by investing your bitcoins. Visit btctradefarm .com to learn more today!
Shheeeeeiiitttt! We gona own da moon son! 
Is there such a thing as a 'good whale?' 

Something or someone helped with that spike to $9200. And there was that news story that one person/entity purportedly pushed the price of Bitcoin up last year. 

If true then that means somebody is pushing to get the value higher!
I hope we’ve hit rock bottom for now 
I love the smell of profit in the morning. Oh, Bitcoin, you keep me hodling on.
Dude I feel the pumping. It's hard to explain. 
I opened a shift card with coinbase (basically a debit card) which i will use for small purchases like coffee and lunch. I encourage everyone to do this to help support the use of bitcoin for transactions. 

Plan to fund it each week with with some funds gained from trading BTC
Good morning from Europe. Price is looking good. A small correction inbetween. But that's ok.

I'm happy.
No one talking about the vulnerability found to steal private keys from air gaped computers that was released today? Israeli researchers found something...should do your research. Tried to post link to article but was denied earlier.
Soros is probably laughing his ass off from this rise. It's a shame his older brother was not as successful as him and ended up dying early.
Opinion: What is nightmare BTC development for traders short BTC futures?  What does their daily limit up disaster scenario look like?
if every individual and institution hedl i wonder what some of the bids would be. 
Just look at all those sell orders disappearing
Abra lets you trade in and out each coin without any fees... what's the catch here? If its soooo good then why isn't it better than coinbase, or is it? Wanting to add some $ to it but just want to know what I should be aware of most while using it...
Big bearish pinbar forming on the 1 hour GDAX BTC chart. Anyone else seeing it? 

EDIT - so much for that bearish candle, bitcoin is unstoppable today!  :)
Hey fellas, back with another live analysis of BTC price \+ some live trading. Open discussion for anyone interested.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e\_wpcJhjaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e_wpcJhjaw)
Please stay below 10k for the next three months and let alt coins have their day.
Not sure why they are doing that, seems daft.
Seems they dont want or can't sticky more than 2 threads ? Everytime something else get stickied th DD disappears.


If you have commented in the DD before, you can simply go to your profile and click your last comment
UPVOTE THE CRAP OUT OF THIS. I agree.
i usually make a comment and someone comments on it, then i just click my history lol
We have all survived. The strong remain.
The way I look at is the last 3-4 months have been on the job crypto training, what to do and what not to do, who to believe and who not to believe . 
It was painful to go through all the ups and downs at the time ( kind of like boot camp for crypto) but once your on the other side and can become a wolf instead of a sheep it is now paying off and was so worth it !
Don't jinx it
painful
so painful....somehow didn't lose much of my position 
Some of us who purchased in 2013 had a few years of 'hell'.  I was just hoping we didn't have to wait that long for a bounce.  Things are looking promising that we won't, thankfully. 
I'm still 6% down. But that's better than 60%. 

Far better! 😊
Hodler checking in. :)  I had a dream early this morning that I checked the price and said, "Wow. It is at $40K!"  But then I looked at the price again and noticed there were more zeros.  It was actually $40 million!  Nice dream!  At least the price is going in the right direction! 
[deleted]
Good luck
DCA
Lol whoa. Don’t forget to HODL. 
Congrats! I'll be there this week hopefully. 

RIP
You got sharked. Buy low volume during dips, just around the bottom. Also, don't listen to any buying advice on Reddit. 
https://www.imgur.com/GfJNU68
Lol.
Hodling gains is easy. 

I've been hodling after buying in (a lot) at 15k, and buying dips (as much as I could) to average down to $9900.

Tough times emotionally. But now it's starting to get better... 

I'm still afraid of another crash. One could say, I'm traumatized.
Nice! I think I said it on Sunday - $10,000 by Friday.
This may lead to a self fulfilling prophecy next tax season, so heads up for that. 
Which big meeting? Been in hiding until the market recovered. 
> Woke up on the East coast to BTC @ $9,300. Good morning on the up and up!

Damn Bro you sleep in late
Yes
Yep. I predict a retrace back to 6800-7500 so solidify the base then back up over $10K. Need some serious volume to support this. I've bought into this before with low volume only to see it dip. Not FUD just gut for me and not financial advice!
It's fucked like that.
By June or so, this move should start accelerating soon, as the momentum builds. We're way behind where we should be for the year. I think May is going to be explosive. 
Yeah bulls have sharpened their horns and are out in full force, get out of the bears or die on impact!
I just bought the dip.
You enjoy spamming that shit don't you
Idk about today, but it's probably gonna stay between 9K and 9.4K for a while before hopefully approaching 10K, which is going to be a real test and some heavy resistance (200 dma, major trandline, nice round number). I'm staying cautiously optimistic until 10K is broken.
[deleted]
looks like if it reaches 11k until friday we will holding it
Agreed. Too much paid shit on /r/CryptoCurrency
Wall finally gave way 
You want to hold long term yet seem to care about short term price fluctuations, that does not add up. 
You shouldn’t buy based on price fluctuation but rather buy because you believe in the technology. Doesn’t matter what the buy in price is if you hold for a long time. 
It's a pretty good time to buy, unless the price goes down. Then it won't have been a good time. But then it will be a better time. Unless it goes up. Then it will have been a good time to buy.

[removed]
Same answer as always: Nobody can tell you that. The market is still very unpredictable.

Sentiment is good, but a bad drop can always happen out of nowhere. Or it doesn't.

You have to make up your own mind.
Is bitcoin ready for a bull run?

Or will AntPool spam the network with junk tx's,
Segwit has a better adoption now. So I guess, Bitcoin would be able to handle it better.

But I don't see a similar bull run like Dec. '17 happen soon. That would need mass euphoria. Right now we're working on getting basic confidence back.
Now that LN is implemented, pressure on fees will increase the speed of its implementation and improvements.
We cross 10 and things are going to get fast.
It slowed down alot. stuck at 1400
Lol, since we broke the 8500-9000 area it's impossible to draw a downward sloping line from the top of 20k on 17 December even on the logarithmic scale (on the linear scale it was not possible since we broke the 8k barrier). So people must be really desperate to still claim to be in a bear market from a TA perspective. Only thing they can hold on to is that we haven’t broke the 12k barrier yet.
[deleted]
You're right.
I think it will break the 9300 resistance. Before the end of the week the 10 k will be the target
latest version is very safe
Safe enough to use as your main wallet. Bitcoin Core is still the safest choice as always though.
he still waiting for 4k
Not too bad, how about you?
Yep, plowing in 10% with dollar cost averaging from every paycheck.
#10kneveragain
#1kbychristmas

LOL
Crying, and rocking back and forth in a dark room somewhere probably.
He had his motives for sure.  
3% remaining on mine :) - we probably bought around the same time ish...
Congratulations! That has to feel good after weathering the last few weeks. 
just scrolled down and read MR_p  555
Grab whatever is close to you and hold on for dear life. 
Sit on them.

Buy more bitcoin with them 
Just a bit of profit taking. It's good for Bitcoin. It was getting a bit ahead of itself. So rather than a crash bit later we get a healthy correction and we can keep going. 
I keep saying people need to lower their stops.   Just hodl in a bull market 
A lot of money was building up, sitting on the sidelines waiting for the bottom.  It's flooding back in now we're back in a bull market.


This latest bull run coincided with the news that Soros, the Rockefellers, and the Rothschilds were getting on board. This may be big institution money. 
All the people who took money out at the top are probably putting the money back in now.
Lmao where did you get this info from
Lol @ 'the common folks are out for now'. I'm sure you have a ton of evidence to back up that statement.
Nothing. This whole reversal has been due to Asia
This is terrible thinking.  Time in market is superior to trying to time the market.


Till June actually. 
>We are going to be stuck at current price levels for a few days.

To be honest: I don't believe that.

I expect another drastic jump soon. Just don't know the direction...
I expect another pump from Asia, like last night, when they wake up to see this movement.
Do you think I should buy long?
why the sigh of relief now? We've already retraced beyond this from the low this year.
I’m hoping it doesn’t breach 10k until the weekend. I have some money 💰 transferring on Thursday or Friday so that I can buy MOAR bitcoin. 
Batman ? He doesn't even have super powers. 
Kindly take your incel behind back to 4chan please.
No it's not somebody or someone. It's a group of people called institutional investors. 
Dolphin
Nobody is pushing the value higher. The market is doing a fine job of that on its own. 
The sell side of order books are pretty thin; while the buy side has gotten beefier. Could be whales pumping; but that's also what you'd expect to see in a bull market. Impossible to know. We could ATH soon or this could be a big bulltrap. Always accumulate if you understand and believe in Bitcoins long term potential. Just understand that potential may never be realized.
Whales aren't bad or good. They are just traders trying to get the best value for their money like you.
I'm almost back in black

As long as you're happy. Asia aims to please. So we'll tap out and you guys just run it up a bit for the Americans and do a proper hand over please. 
Tell us about it
[deleted]
Sounds like a bunch of baloney. 
Laughing gis (Jewish property confiscating, Nazi collaborating, British Pound crashing, Ukrainian coup funding) ass off.

https://youtu.be/rd39zUvreOU
This was it. Surely no one is YOLO shorting right now. There may be traders with small hedges, or a bit short and the rest on the sidelines, but anyone going all in short has to be betting on 0, and that's much less likely than $15k in the next few months. 
This video should explain how to trade on Coinbase without fees. 
https://youtu.be/yOlCR6xYJg4
i use it to buy altcoins 

downside : you are not really owning your coins \(ex i bought DGB last week\) i can't transfer it to my DGB wallet :\( 
jinxed it
Don't think you quite understand how this works. If Bitcoin doesn't go nothing goes. 
Scram kid!
Get out of here! 
I agree. 
I posted this so I can find this thread easier next time ;) 
Seems it’s more like stupidity to invest only to sell in downtrend - if they couldn’t lose why go in with whatever amount at all? 
Oh I totally agree with you in that. Learned a lot over the course of the 1st Quarter 2018 with regards to BTC and cryptos. Lost 70% of what I put in [in paper that is] and now like most of us am in the recovery. 
Give it another couple of hours.
I feel like this is how things were supposed to progress.  The huge jump around the holidays was due to FOMO and unsustainable.  This upward trend is more indicitave of the future.  HODL my friend
Heh.  Nostradamus is trading.
Thanks, are you a bluenose?
FOMO
Sick of waiting for the 'right moment'
I never listen to any advice in crypto
9.9k was IMO still a good price to buy in.

You can de-traumatise by trying your best to avoid FOMO from now on, and hodling.  I'm sure you know that - just my opinion.
man that is only a few months.  smart move buying more low.  You will be sitting pretty in a year.
This is me :-/  Only I bought in a lot more dips and lowered my average....but yes PTSD :-D
might be 10k today
See link for further details on the meeting:
https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2018/
Yeah I'm self employed so my mornings are flexible lol
Volume is high and increasing though.
short lived
He bought the dip

*load Korea FUD*
Tsk.  It's in the whitepaper.  If BitcoinAlways doesn't write **Come on bulls** at least every 6 hours, the entire blockchain collapses :)

p.s.  **To the Moooon!!!**
It makes me think I'm helping and some people find it motivational :) 
I enjoy it, motivational
Thanks
I will kiss your face if it happens.
UPVOTE: Buy into the tech & the team & the honesty if you're a long termer.
Lol... Yes, buy some. DCA what you're willing to lose.
Eh?  Was that really so rude, or did I miss some irony?
God I hate Btrash.
$12k is the next big level. We might struggle there, last time it failed and we went back to $6.5. I'm not even worried about $10k, that's going to go today. 

I suspect we'll get to $12k by week-end and then struggle there till next week sometime. 


Bitcoin will drag it up. Doesn't matter how you try cut it, or how much anyone hates this Ver guy, it's one of the best performers in Crypto space this year. 
https://datamish.com/d/000000004/btcusd?orgId=1&from=1524493291070&to=1524579691070

Seems like people thought shorting close to 9500 is a good idea. They'll learn...
Why is it 'to early' and why is this 'to fast'. Have you ever ever looked at the movements of cryptocurrencies before? A 33% rise in 13 days is everything but 'to fast' especially after the bottoming out of the market after a 70% decline from the top. Your just spewing bullshit. 
How many times have you predicted an imminent drop to 6k in the past few weeks?
I'm hoping that we will get past $10k by Friday. 
The safest choice is a hardware wallet. 
How to be more safe? Do I have to stay offline?
Find where I said it though. Oh right. You can't.
Painfully tried.
if you don't mind, for how long and what is your ROI(%)?

(do not respond with your holding amount)
#NeverForgetti
It’s been a tough couple of months. Things are looking so much brighter now.  Very happy 😃 
This is not "info", but personal opinion that I would like to discuss.
Call them "weak hands" or whatever you like. 

Fact is: Many people, who were hoping to get rich quick, left the market. Disillusioned. It'll take some time to get them back in.
What reversal?
True story.
but but.. a jump only goes one direction =o 
when you're right, you're right.
(Mandela effect, just demonstrated..)
Bitcoin waits for Nobody.
Well seems like you got plenty of time. You might actually be in a position to buy sub 9K. 
but every cool toy
Kindly calm your tits and chill with the gatekeeping. 
A-ha! So they are invested in Bitcoin and see the benefit of it going higher and then they make a big buy to spur the market forward?

Whatever the reasons of this bull run it will be beneficial to all especially to all hud'lers, go moon!!
Cool. Thank you.

You r too wise. Makes sense. I hate the cash settlement. Make them deliver coin. 
would be perfect if gadx was mobile. I'm usually away from my computer most the time. Abra being on my smartphone makes it soooo much more convenient. Just hate that there are no charts to watch so I switch back and forth to coinbase for tracking and just use abra for trading. Well that's the plan  for now atleast, pending no mind changing. 
yea I hate that part about it also. Guess I'm lookin at it more for trading all day instead of hodl... 
This has been proven wrong recently. Don't know about the future but for time being, ALTS have moved up much quicker than BTC. 

I am down 30% on my BTC portfolio and only 6% on my ALTS - all bought at roughly same time.
We share the same experience with that lost but we are now very positive that we can recover eventually. Market are very positive right now and maybe because of this we can cut our losses
heh
Unfortunately, yes. 
KAKA
When I bought it, I just said to myself “well it’s a growth asset, and on average it should be a better deal NOW than LATER”. Served me well. 
> 9.9k was IMO still a good price to buy in.

I think so, too. But it was hard at times to convince myself...
A few very hard months. Full of self doubt.
Or you just didn't buy as much initially... ;-)
Thank you. Seems exciting. 
Lol
I love yours posts dude, keep it up!
Volatile coin is volatile 
*DONT CALL US THAT.....CORE!*

Yeah, I see the resistance too, I think the test is 11,800
bah i bought at 8800 just before it dropped, but i held through  
He justs go around saying the same all around the sub, and I just keep hitting that downvote button
[deleted]
Got my buy orders at $500 who's coming with me /s
They are not exclusive, you can use a hardware wallet connected to Electrum wallet. You can use Electrum wallet connected to Bitcoin Core.

Do all those things and you get private keys held on a hardware wallet, Electrum's feature richness and Bitcoin Core's full validation and privacy.
That's debatable considering Ledger was hacked by a 15 year old.
Use Linux. Backup and encrypt your seed words and store them in several different locations. 
tired I presume.  Take it easy.
Did you buy yet? Or still waiting for 4k
I started in January, so it's not a large amount yet. The dips to around $6k and $7k in February and March are profitable, the rest is still in the red (for now I hope)
What's your source for that 'fact'?
The reversal since 6.8k
down until friday so i could buy
Pepperidge Farm remembers.
I’d be happy with low 9’s at this point.  Trying not to be too greedy.  Hurry up money transfer. 
Getting a virus on your computer can lead to the compromise of your Bitcoins. News at 11. Seriously though, the whole point of an air gapped computer is if you want to out a virus on it you need to be handling the hardware. This is a pointless attack.
You can use GDAX via your browser though
On my iPhone, I can log into Coinbase and both watch charts and trade. It's not an app, just the website that I'm logging into. \(I think Skipper may have answered this below, though\) :\) 

Regardless, I understand wanting to trade from your smartphone. It's super convenient. Good luck on the trades! 
true! great for people who want it exchange for fiat right away
And if Bitcoin goes to $1000 tomorrow will your alts still be up ? I don't think so. The alt over perform either way, positive or negative, but they won't do a thing without Bitcoin. For time being anyway. 
Good result for you last night, hopefully we can do the same tonight :o
TOP KEK
any price under $10,000 is a great deal 
That's entirely possible!  I was trying my best to get more in at ATH like everyone else lol..... but it was alot harder to get fiat in at that point thank god :-D   And I got lucky and my gut was right on both "bottoms" since then when I went all in with what I had at the time.  Bit of luck def helps in this endeavor :-P  
I love you both
Thanks man :)
.. and a CEO you know.
Something like that, but once we're through there's nothing till the ATH. We'll get to $20k awfully fast. 
also bought some around 6k

Better sell then.
Very good point!
It required quite a somewhat unrealistic set-up as well as physical, unnoticed access to the device and has been fixed by Ledger.  
I see what you are trying to say though, but an online/hot-wallet, be it Bitcoin Core, Electrum (both are great choices for their purposes) or anything else, never will be as secure as cold storage.
How to
I bought your mom.
This "Daily Discussion" thread over the past few weeks gave me that impression...

And it seemed plausible to me, because I was on the verge of doing the same more often than I could count.
Ah, that one. That seems like decades ago, nearly forgot about it.
easy
and the interface is alright IMO. 
ahhha didn't realize that. Thanks a lot for pointin it out.
Bitcoin won't go to 1000.

Yes you are right that generally BTC is the daddy king and all ALTs typically follow the trend.
USA
Cri man squa f and c double time
I love all three of you.
CEO peepz are always crazy 
anyone else thinking 100k ? 
get rekt.
I agree. But I would choose paper wallets over a hardware wallet for cold storage any day.
google paperwallet
So she can drive you around in your maxi cosi?
Sometimes the vocal minority might seem like a majority...
Think I found the problem. This DD thread is just a collection of memers and manipulators. If you think you can get an ideaof how the crypto market works from these threads i have to dissapoint you
USB
And my axe!
If we do half of last year it's $200k. If we repeat last year it's $400k. $100k is a very low target. 
player_one is right we need 12k first hahahah
\
If they have access to your hardware wallet wouldn't it be safe to assume they could have access to your paper wallet? A paper wallet without a pin seems less secure than a hardware wallet with pin protection.

 I'm just playing the devils advocate, not trying to start an argument or anything negative. 
Yup.
Probably. Still: For a bull run, much money is needed. 

I just wonder where it's coming from this time. I believe this is very different from December 2017.
