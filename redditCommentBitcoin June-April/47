That Bart Simpson trend line is forming pretty well. 
I've been consistently putting in $750 every 2 weeks into btc. I gotta feeling we're heading to the Moon, would be crazy to dip into my emergency fund to get in before it's too late, and just replace my emergency fund money and just replace it down the line with the $750 contribution in was planning on putting in btc?
I have to admit: I enjoy watching the games.

Feels a bit like ancient Rome.
So rbtc is pretty much rbuttcoin, but focused on Bitcoin. lol

**Bitcoin Price Defends $8K But Pullback Still in Play**

https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-bounces-back-from-sudden-dip-eyeing-move-to-8400/

Bitcoin (BTC) remains on the hunt for a major bullish breakout after bouncing back from an overnight dip.

Prices hit a four-day low of $7,823 yesterday reportedly due to whale dumping over $50 million-worth of the cryptocurrency in one Bitfinex trade. The news that New York's attorney general is taking a closer look at major cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the state may also have dampened the bull mood.

The sudden price drop raised the possibility that the rally from the April 1 low of $6,425 had run out of steam.

However, BTC's sharp return from $7,873 to $8,160 this morning established the area around $7,800 as a strong support level and indicates a strong dip-demand mentality in the market. For the second time in the last three days, a dip below the $8,000 mark was quickly undone.

The recovery witnessed this morning adds credence to the bullish moving average studies.

As of writing, BTC is trading at $8,090 on Bitfinex - largely unchanged on a 24-hour basis.

**View**

BTC will likely test supply around $8,400 in the next 24 hours. A high volume close (as per UTC) above that level would signal a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.

On the downside, $7,870 (today's low) is the key level to watch out for. BTC's failure to defend the key support level could yield a pullback to $7,510 (former resistance turned support).

Only a daily close below the ascending (bullish biased) 10-day MA would indicate the rally from the low of $6,425 has ended.

 Hi, I'm usin Coinbase as my Wallet for trading and storing mined Cryptocurrencies, in the security settings I stablihed a 2-Step verification password with Google Authenticator. It was working fine most of the time, but recently I changed my presonal cellphone so I had to redownload the Google Authenticator App, since then, I don't know why, the codes that the Authenticator generates isn't working at all. Can someone please help me with this issue, I'm realy desperate because I can't login to my Coinbase account anymore. Thanks in advance.

All in baby even my emergency dip money, I could be wrong but it just feels like it's gonna explode.
I'm a Swedish 27 y/o guy who's been keeping an eye on bitcoin for several years. I first heard of it from my brother when it was only worth a few dollars and he told me to start mining some. (I didn't and boy do I regret that..)

I've been interested in buying a few times during these years, but never really understood how to get hold of some. It seemed too complicated and I never really tried to be honest, but the last two years that changed.

2016 I started googling and found out you needed a wallet etc. There were so many wallets to choose from that I wasn't sure which ones to trust and I was intimidated. I ended up giving up (again, big regret...).

Beginning of 2017 I thought to myself that it was now or never. This time I actually got as far as getting myself a wallet. The next step was to acquire some coins to put in it. The easiest way after some googling seemed like buying from an exchange. Here is where I ran into a wall this time. To get approved (or whatever is it called) I had to send them pictures of my ID and some recent bills. I was living with my parents at the moment and the bills were in their name, so again I gave up (Regret regret regret).

 Yes, I am very lazy and give up as soon as I run into a tiny bump on the road.. BUT I am a relatively young guy. I have used conputers, played videogames and bought new technology my entire life. If I couldn't figure out how to buy and own bitcoin, how is my mom or dad going to?

I think that when it's as easy to buy bitcoin as it is to buy in-game currency in videogames, then we will really see new money flow in.

Sorry for the wall of text and grammar. Just a Swedish guy that needed to vent. I'm cross-posting this in a few places because it took me a really long time to write and I want it to be seen, hehe.

PS. I ended up buying into an ETF in Sweden that follows the 
price of bitcoin and one that follows ethereum. In december 2017.....

TL:DR Young guy that's used to new technology thought it was too complicated to buy bitcoin in 2016 and beginning of 2017. Bought in december 2017 instead...
I finally got my Robinhood account set up which is perfect timing because I just deleted all linked bank accounts with Coinbase after they made more fraudulent charges after the duplicate charges from Feb.

Ahh now I see. Yea I would agree. I haven‚Äôt had any issues like that luckily. Good luck hope it gets cleared up
For the most part the price was below the EMA50 on the daily chart. Which corresponds to the EMA4800 on the 15min chart depicted here. 

It would be nice to see a real breakthrough...

#US AUTHORITIES LAUNCH MAJOR PROBE INTO BITCOIN TRADING
‚ÄòThe New York Attorney General has launched an investigation into 13 major cryptocurrency exchanges trading bitcoin and other digital currencies‚Ä¶ The Virtual Markets Integrity initiative¬†could bring about tighter regulation for cryptocurrency exchanges.‚Äô

https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/bitcoin-price-cryptocurrency-exchange-coinbase-gemini-investigation-new-york-a8309261.html
I figured it out finally, how the USA is going to cripple bitcoin.

They are going to create a new 'crypto tax' in which every time you convert USD to crypto, they will tax it like a gas tax. So you will have to convert it to Euros first, and then try and go overseas. But if you do any in America, there will be a crypto tax. They will pass a law that ALL regulated conversion companies MUST collect and pass this tax in order to be a recognized banking institution, and all others who fail to comply will be investigated for 'providing money to terrorist organizations' and subsequently shut down.

What this does is pretty crazy. It makes it MORE expensive to purchase the same things at home in the USA than with cash or debit cards, which will immediately stop the adoption of it by vendors.

Banks win, the Government retains control, and people who want to have bitcoin for 'funzies' can still do so. Plus, new banking restrictions are in place and are very hard to get or you have to pay a really high fee for a 'banking permit' to sell and exchange BTC.

Edit: yes, I do own bitcoin, and I fear for this kind of stuff.

"The prices still undervalue."

Based on what? Serious question.
Almost! I sold last night out of frustration, but I didn‚Äôt stay away for long at all, and came crawling back within 30 minutes
There's an upright bart right now.

Eat my shorts, man.
I don't think you should use any money that you can't afford to lose. If that is your emergency money, you have to realize as soon as you put that money into the market, it could disappear in an instant. The $750 that you're putting in every two weeks seems solid enough to me, but just my 2 cents.
Are you not entertained?!?!
*Moonituri te salutant*
Haven't been there in a while. What's the hot topic there at the moment?
the whole move from 6800 is pretty weak in volume compared to the downmoves still. 

It just jumped so hard because shorts where on all time high. So some big buyers forced a chain reaction which closed 50%  of the shorts on bitmex in an hour(there where several 10million liquidations on shorts). This needs a lot more buy support following just the price tells you not much.


That‚Äôs a big whale. How do you find the exchanges where a dump or pump is happening? 
It‚Äôs always confused me how people know where it‚Äôs going on
Also, interesting update üëç
I hope so! I own $1k worth.
if he is not promising to eat his dick - I'm not buying it..
Don‚Äôt worry. You‚Äôre not going to the moon. You‚Äôre headed for LV-426. (No googling)
Is the clock on your new phone correct?
Ok, I can help. First do you still have your old phone with the original Google Authenticator App? Because that is what you're going to need to access your account. Your new phone wont have the same code as the old phone unless you saved and used the same secret key that coinbase generated when you used with your old phone.

Just ask Mr Pui (= chicken in Romanian btw) if you want to know where the price is going. He claims to know all of his trades for the whole year so he must know what the price will be at any point. I do not.
Really? Hardly any movement in the last 6 days. Looks pretty stable atm, just trading in a small range.
They are coming in waaaaaaves!
Do you have any source for the "rocket launch effect"? Or did you just invent the term yourself?

3.5 mil
Enough to make a winning lottery ticket today look like change.
On the low end, $100k, on the high end about $2 million. My estimates are based on today's dollars in the low end of $1 trillion market cap and high end of $20 trillion (~2x gold's market cap) 

Around 50 million USD.
Banks will either own it or destroy it, so tough to say.
A mil or close to zero. Not going to be close to a mil. 
Why has the price increased so much today?
what happened to your bitcoin bro ?

No Bitcoin for you.

*Bitcoin emergency dip money* lol
Seriously? This is NOT the type of bet that you go all-in on -- it is just total speculation, and for the last couple of months, mostly day traders playing poker and trying to set traps for each other.
Yeah I went all in on my emergency dip money too a few days ago.  Hopefully won‚Äôt need that for a while. 
No offense my man but if you think going on a website and using a credit card to buy bitcoin, combined with downloading a wallet and sending it there is ‚Äútoo complicated‚Äù....you may be just be a moron. I know that‚Äôs harsh...but really.  You‚Äôre 27. You‚Äôre an adult. That‚Äôs not young enough to use I‚Äôm young as an excuse imo. 
It took me about 3 days to get my head fully around it all and that mainly consisted of watching the hundreds of youtube tutorials

It is super simple to get 'setup' the hard part is when to buy/sell/hodl

I just use GDAX have never bothered looking at another exchange and I only buy BTC

Get your finger out of your ass grow a pair of bollocks and man up

Good luck :)
I agree with you 100%. I'm a 31 year old Canadian and I've been PC literate my whole life but I still can't get my head wrapped around this. It took me a long time to figure out how wallets work and how to convert fiat into coins without paying huge fees. I got so fed up that I ended up withdrawing all my money from my bank accounts and walked accross the city with over $10,000 in cash in a duffel bag to the local exchange. I didn't exactly feel like I was participating in a digital revolution. 

It was easier to get into the market we would see a huge surge of new money. 
Young guy..You're fucking 27 y/o. I believe even Coinbase has an app where you can straight up buy BTC. Getting 'approved' on an exchange is not harder than setting up a regular bank account. I think the 'I am very lazy' is the only problem here. Next to that, posting this shit everywhere because it took you a really long time (what, 15mins?) to write doesn't make sense and only proves how lazy you indeed are.
If you used computers and bought technology all your life than wtf was the problem with buying btc? Coinbase has an app where you can buy btc with your credit card.

Kinda serves you right that you are at -70% right now.
[deleted]
Nobody can tell you that. The market is highly unpredictable.


According to coindesk we will be trying $8400 in the next 24 hours.  

https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-bounces-back-from-sudden-dip-eyeing-move-to-8400/
Crescent mooning.
We may land on the dark side of the moon tho :/
watch any chart including the history of btc when a 70% crash happens it goes sideways where people slowly acquire are a low price after the initial crash.

I don't say the next bull run won't come but this was no dip where we jump back to 20k in a month. 

So when his was the bottom (which is not yet clear) we will gain slowly for a while. 

Trusting the price direction is a slow process until you reach the point where people fomo in again. 

All those lines..
Always buy.
Don't try to day-trade BTC.  If you believe in it - buy it.

It is a long term investment.

Bitcoin is like a lady: completely irrational, illogical and unpredictable.  Only in the long run will you realise just what a mistake you have made.

..was that a bit sexist?
Buy when it dipped. Don't sell before moon.
If the bears win, price is $30,000 in 5 years. If bulls win, it's $35,000. 

So you should sell, to me. 
You should be able to send it from you're wallet to their wallet....no middleman
For 0.1 Bitcoin a wallet like https://electrum.org will be good enough.
Depends. Are you considering buying more or not? If yes, get a Trezor or Ledger Nano. If not, paper wallet is good enough.
Great contribution to the discussion.
Where do you pull these numbers? The lottery?
That was me, I sold my house and cashed out 401k! cuz I wanna be whale... will be sleeping in the Samsung 80" tv box for 2 weeks and then, lambo and penthouse filled with hot bitchez!
I think either it will or it will not.
no
fosho!
yes, no, yes, no...
yes
maybe
$9k today. We'll leave the consolidation with the same kind of move that we came into it. So a big jump is on the cards if we make $8.5k
Nobody knows. There seems to be a lot of resistance at $8200 on GDAX. In the next few hours it will be interesting to see what Europe decides to do when they wake up. 
Maybe, maybe not. What it looks like to me is that there is a lot of ALT buying going on. Bitcoin still serves as the base currency exchange medium on most crypto exchanges, so naturally, it goes up for that reason. However, it falls or remains steady as people convert it into their desired ALT coin.
Or we could just lean back and hodl.
$250,000
Yes. You can't transfer money from Indian Bank Accounts into Crypto (It's not just banks' decision, the govt has asked to stop ICOs or exchanging INR to Crypto). But there's no regulation on you accessing websites. The internet is very open there. 
There's also no legal issue if Indians who acquired Crypto earlier or from abroad want to trade it online. Just that they can't purchase it with Indian National Rupee (INR) right now.
GDAX
Depends where you're from tbh
Honestly just get it. I think its extremely undervalued for 2018, let alone the long term future.

I bought another 0.5 on the dip, would be buying more, but I have to spend about 20k on various home things this spring and need to keep cash + emergency money.
nah, you just need 50BTC, nbd
Dem some big walls Mhmmmmm
You win with this comment. I keep thinking we‚Äôre moving ... but 8200
Yeah the dives are getting shallow
Who's panicking?   :)
uhh nope, shorts have been increasing since the big squeeze that kicked this bullshit "rally" off.  Longs closed hard on that pump and have stayed pretty low, seems twitter/youtube/reddit are bullish with their words but not with opening their wallets and putting money on it.
I don't think you know how covering a short works. 

If you want to get out of your short you have to buy which is pushing the price up. 

Also after the big jump up the shorts are increasing again not decreasing. Longs are decreasing. You didn't check and stats and just made wild guesses..

This is not a prediction where the price goes just facts. Trading based on running long and short positions is the worst thing you can do anyway.
Ummm, shorts will short when the price is high, not when it is low. The shorts will go out of the market as the price heads toward the floor, and will come out when it gets closer to the ceiling. Here, the price is somewhat closer to the last recent high (8915 on March 23), than the last floor (6600 a couple of weeks ago), so it is natural that the shorts will increase.
If short sellers were really 'trying to get out of the game' they would be buying (longing) to close out their positions and pay back the margin they borrowed, not selling. Judging by the volume it's more likely hesitation from the bulls since this is the third time they have been rejected from the 8200 mark. It seems everyone is counting on some big whale to come to their rescue and push prices up without really looking at the charts to form a second opinion. 
This, and his other videos, convinced me to keep my Bitcoin even when the price went down.

I disagree! I believe $8301 will be a key point to test the upward resistance.
I'm already sleeping in a Lambo......bed....

**Don't go over the top!  Exchanges have welcomed this move.**

What Crypto Exchanges Are Saying About New York's New Inquiry

https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-exchanges-saying-nys-new-inquiry/

Some of the startups named today in the New York Attorney General's cryptocurrency exchange "inquiry" say they welcome the move.

As CoinDesk reported on Tuesday, the office of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has launched an inquiry into 13 cryptocurrency exchanges. The exchanges named were Coinbase's GDAX, Gemini, bitFlyer USA, Bitfinex, Bitstamp USA, Kraken, Bittrex, Poloniex, Binance, Tidex.com, Gate.io, itBit and Huobi.Pro.

Schneiderman's office sent letters to the exchanges, along with a detailed questionnaire that probes the firms' ownership, leadership, operations, terms of service, privacy policies, trading volumes, use of "bots," relationships with financial institutions - among other areas.

CoinDesk reached out to the 13 exchanges, and as of press time, five - Gemini, Bittrex, Poloniex, bitFlyer and Bitfinex - replied. Coinbase was not immediately available to comment, and the other exchanges have yet to respond to requests.

In a statement, Gemini CEO Tyler Winklevoss said his company "applauds" the Attorney General's inquiry, stating that "we look forward to cooperating with and submitted our responses to the questionnaire."

"We continue to embrace thoughtful regulation and collaboration on our mission to help build the future of money," he added.

A representative for Bittrex struck a similar note, also stating that the exchange welcomes the opportunity to respond: "We look forward to working with NY Attorney General Schneiderman on our shared goal of improving transparency, accountability and security across all virtual currency trading platforms."

Josh Hawkins, vice president of marketing at Circle, Poloniex's parent company, told CoinDesk:

"We welcome all initiatives focused on increasing transparency and accountability in the space and look forward to working with the New York Attorney General's office. Protecting crypto currency investors and consumers has always been Circle's first priority."

BitFlyer USA, by way of compliance director Hailey Lennon, echoed the remarks about transparency, stating: "Transparency is important for consumer protection in this industry. We received the letter from the New York Attorney General and are reviewing the requests asked of our US exchange."

Kasper Rasmussen, communications director for Bitfinex, offered a more measured comment when reached.

"We can confirm that Bitfinex is aware of the New York Attorney General's inquiry regarding our operations, controls, and general user protections. Bitfinex is committed to compliance with authorities and regulators worldwide and we look forward to responding to this inquiry."

When reached for follow-up comment on the launch of its inquiry, a spokesperson for Schneiderman's office said that "we plan to make the information public at the end of the process since the goal here is to bring much-needed transparency and accountability to the crypto marketplace."

She declined to "comment or speculate" about potential legal action against the exchanges.

There is no reason to expect any of this to happen.  
dont spread fud fuckboy
So you saying that you have to pay both a sales tax AND capital gain tax?  That's ridiculous.

American tax system sucks.
Governments love crypto, they are making a fortune through taxes on it, they won't ban it now.
It is allready taxed more than gas if you day trade, Up to 40% per trade, That's insane.
now that you have that all figured out, mind if I borrow your time machine for a sec?
Na, I think it's pretty clear for now that without a concerted G20 effort, it's a competition for as lax regulation as possible (barring ICOs of course)

Look 4 posts further down. I showed it there.

No we're not bitcoin was worth 1000 last year. Today it is worth 8000. That doesn't sound like a bear market to me..
Double Barttom
well ye it all depends on the timeframe you trade on. 

The hodl'ers here should just watch the monthly chart every 3 month. That would save them a lot of time :) 
lol thanks for the info
Tax
> e 

wait, you sold because BTC went from 8,1k to 7,9k?
I'd suggest you not to re-enter the market then, this stuff is not for you LOL

Damn coin bags over here!
googled it, that's deep.
Big things have small beginnings.
Yes, It's correct
I do have the original phone, but that code won't work either
Code from your old phone should work. You may need to reach out to coinbase
Hardly any movement in the last six days? Maybe if you're ignoring the $1000 spike in less than a minute six days ago, the $300 spike in less than a minute five days ago, the $300 drop in less than a minute half a day later, the $300 spike in less than a minute three days ago followed by a $300 drop a few hours later, the $200 drop in less than a minute yesterday, the $200 spike in less than a minute this morning, and the $200 drop in less than a minute about an hour ago.

*Cough* 1969.
Yeah, that's a problem that conmen know only too well.
I‚Äôm okay with that if it‚Äôs at 19k I‚Äôll be sure to pay with my btc 
Also, I think you win this bet. New ATH by the end of July.
You must be a non believer
Nah, that‚Äôs when the short term line should fully cross the long term line on the 1 day chart on gdax.  Today it just touched it. 
Any number in the 5 digits is ridiculously underpriced...
It *was*. Just wait.

I come to this sub for the last 3 month instead of watching comedy central - so worth it... comedy gold every 2nd post...
If you tell me when the best time Is then please let me know cause sometimes you just need to go with your gut feeliing.
Like I wrote in the post: The second time I gave up was when I had to get my account approved by sending in passport and bill pictures. If it was as easy as going on a website and buy some with a credit card then I would have done it a long time ago because I shop items online every week by doing that.

I understand that it is possible and "relativlely" easy to buy bitcoin today,, but I would have to guess that a lot of people give up at that stage like I did. 

To be honest I think the concept of private keys and electrical wallets is a bit troublesome too, but like I said, I am a very lazy person.
No need to be hostile. Everything has a learning curve and this guy was just voicing his opinion, one I agreed with when I started.

Transferring to a wallet from an exchange felt like a risk. Nobody wants to risk their money over an admin mistake like that.
Same, I spent about a week learning everything I could before I invested a penny into crypto.  Thankfully it was during a period when I had some free time so it didn't take me away from much.  However, I don't expect most people who work 9-5 with a family at home to commit that kind of time.  
In my mind 3 days of research is such a commitment for the avarage person. But it will hopefully change in the future :)
Setting up a bank account is something I personally consider very complicated compared to buying items online or in-game currency in video games.

Ps. It took me over 30 minutes to write. I am not good at english nor at expressing myself with text.
Be nice. His opinion counts.
I didn't find the app back then, is it new? If so that is awesome, one more step into mainstream usage! 

Like I wrote, I couldn't get approved on coinbase due to me living at my parents place and the bills having their names. Why do we need to be approved? Why can't we buy bitcoin like we buy items online or in-game currancy in games like LoL or Wow?
I had to have my bank reverse the fraudulent charges because who knows how long it would take Coinbase to do it. My case was given to "a specialist" and then I was never contacted again. I'm starting to think "we assigned your case to a specialist" is Coinbase slang for "fuck this guy". 
Come to the Dark Side. We have cookies!
Actually, I hid most of the lines for this screenshot. I have many more... ;-)
Lol, not at all.
Wait - is it *investment* or *currency*?
I will not ever sell, I only will by goods with my bitcoin, and replace the bitcoin spent on goods with USD Cash buying more bitcoin
What wallet can safely be linked to my phone? Right now I would probably use Coinbase but I'd like to remove the middle man as you said.
For context:

UK
The Independent is a respected British newspaper. I understand that one might not like the subject of the news but a reactionary post won't discredit its truthfulness. The worldwide Bitcoin market is huge and won't likely be influenced by this forum.
This is good news ‚Ñ¢
It could be. If they create rules so exchanges somehow are able to ban deliberate sell and buy walls that are placed there to control the value of Bitcoin.
The 'fee' that you pay to the exchange to buy/sell will essentially have a 2% tax included in the exchange. All they need to do (the government) is make it the tiniest more expensive than regular cash, and they win the war.
I didn't say ban, moreso tax. The sales tax is 8% where I live. It wasn't that high years ago, it kept going up. People say that the government is making a fortune, yes, but they will raise the tax if it conflicts with bank's interests.
that's exchange fee not tax

But think of the 9000% grow!!! Trus expert"s man
he got 0.50 USD in there, somebody took the bait about a month ago it seems 
Thoughts and prayers for the lost joke. 
holy shit this is the most flawed logic/reasoning I've seen yet.  Even using it you forgot to mention it peaked at 19K and has already fallen to 8K.  Given it was 1K like you said...still a long ways to drop.
Perfect. üëå 
lol. 
Depends on how you look at it. If you're trading by the hour, it is extremely volatile. But since the last high on March 23, the price has been vibrating in a channel between that high and a floor somewhere around 6500.
I said 6 days because the 1k spike is more than 6 days ago. I follow in GBP and there has been little more than 100 either way since then.
Cash me outside how bout dat?

You're living on a dream, dude.  
yeah, Cryptosanta does not exist for me anymore, and it seems like jewbus is not coming back to save us... ;(

How about landing on moon with a tractor ?
Not with your life savings you don't. 
There is never a best, or even a good, or even a fair, time to go all-in on a speculative investment with living money. The only money that should ever be invested in something like this is true "surplus", i.e., money you can afford to lose without too much pain. Sheesh, might as well buy a lottery ticket, as there you know there will be at least one mega-winner somewhere; here, you don't even have that, but no more than a general hope that it will start climbing again.
Just..wat..

The concept of private keys is troublesome? Do you even crypto?
For me that all depends on your strategy

If you are a day trader you are watching like a hawk one would assume

If you are a hodler then you maybe check in hourly or every few hours or even every few days

I am a bit of both but if I am really busy I will check when I wake up then maybe at 6pm
It took 3 days because I am thorough in my research

In reality it took a couple of hours, just when it comes to money/tech etc I like to be somewhat 'educated'

Godspeed, Bulls.
For large amounts in the UK try Coinfloor
I'm in the UK so I know The Independent but it like most papers writes sensationalist headlines, it's not a major probe.  They sent a questionnaire to 13 exchanges.
I wonder what newspaper (wordwide, if any) deserves to be respected these days. My money is on none. Can't find a single one with journalistic integrity.
His post wasn't "reactionary" nor did he try to discredit The Infependent in any way, he simply posted on what Coinbase reported on this matter (with included quotes from various exchanges).

Besides... I don't see why a probe/investigation/inquiry of the exchanges by the NY AG should be perceived as negative for bitcoin (as your post implies). Exchanges should be (thoughtfully) regulated and held accountable.  


Like they managed to control the stock market? LOL
They say it's the hope that kills you 
Expert eh ? Must be legit. 
It will be missed.

Hehe, I'm trying to "crypto", but I don't find it "easy". Isn't the point of bitcoins and other cryptos that it will be used globally by EVERYONE? 

Most of my friends and family thinks it is too complicated to use.
I'm not talking about the duplicate charges from Feb which were supposedly the fault of Visa. Coinbase told me to have my bank reverse the duplicate charge (so I did). A month later, Coinbase said I owed them for the amount of the reversed duplicate charge and a few days later, they suspended buying on my account and charged me AGAIN (without my authorization) for the duplicate charge that had been reversed. 

So I did what they told me to do and they charged me for it and effectively disabled my account. 
The whole point is that I *do* understand the difference in those words. So many BTC proponents insist that it will replace fiat. Well, OK. Then it's currency. 

But others, like the OP's post, view it as an investment. Unless you're thinking of the "security" of a money market fund, then dollars aren't an investment.

So, which is it?
We shall see
Btc has been in a steady climb for 3-4 years.... do you even log chart bro.  Look at this, does this look like a complete correction to you, or one that's like 30% done at best...  https://www.tradingview.com/x/KN55MQgD/
Glad it worked out for you!  How much was did it cost which procedure did you use?  I see different types of transplants.  Thanks in advance.
Did it hurt.

Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight
Its great when people try to tell you how to spend your money


Keep reading and learning, it will become easier.

Improved user interfaces and better marketing are coming.
[deleted]
When the duplicate charge was reversed, were both transactions reversed and you received 0 btc? Or what? 
I don't care.  It is like asking if a camel is a horse or a cow.  It is neither.
Might not be today, but does it really matter if it's tomorrow or another day or so ?
that might have been the dumbest comment i've read about bitcoin this week. congratulations. 
[deleted]
Oh I will. I just hope that the day will come when people like my friends and family won't have to "read and learn", only use.
?
I made an actual purchase for $300 on Jan 23rd.
On Feb 14th, my checking account was charged for $300 again even though no such purchase appeared in my Coinbase account. 
I reversed the $300 Duplicate charge from 2/14  through my bank and did it according to Coinbase instructions. 
($600 left my account and I only received $300 back)
A month later, Coinbase notifies me that I reversed payment on the legitimate transaction that took place on Jan 23rd. (I did not). 
I had already moved my Bitcoin off of the exchange so they insisted I pay them back in USD for the reversed charge and that my ability to buy had been disabled. 
I opened a support ticket to dispute the error, and while my support ticket was getting looked at, Coinbase charged a different account that I had "synced" with them without my authorization. 
The level of incompetence and poor customer service there is astonishing. 

damn, that‚Äôs a lot of money for hair. But it seems to have really made a lot of positive changes in your life so I‚Äôd say it was money well spent, good for you man!
Damn dawg. You paid 19k for hair? That's some balling ass shit right there.

Personally, I'd rather people knowing what they are doing before they decide to use, but to each his own.
I agree. And honestly, as mentioned previously, Coinbase is probably the easiest to do (providing you can ID yourself) to get started with credit card payments into crypto.

Step 2 is then transferring out to a wallet. The easiest I‚Äôve found is Bread and LoafWallet. I‚Äôve never tried a full paper wallet myself.

On the other hand, some big banks have dreadful user interfaces for paying and moving money around - so it is not unique to crypto.
[deleted]
Yes, but most of a country's population use fiat without much knowledge in economy. I'm just saying that I hope the day will come when it's natural for us to use bitcoin. I believe in it.
No. I was talking to people on the phone.
