The entire market is being manipulated by people buying and selling Bitcoin.  
Bart pattern completed...
Oh FFS, can we pick a direction already.
Great accumulation time guys, the calm before the storm- whether it be days, weeks or months the market will boom once again. HODLers will prevail! 
It's very funny to see all of these libertarians complaining about the rich manipulating the price at their expense. Welcome to the unregulated free market 😂😂
 I’m sure I read a futures contract ends today.

Ppl will cash in on the “vacation”
What's going on with this sub. First I see there is 90k online, refreshed the page and it dropped to 81k
Seems like this cycle's almost done. No more weekend pumps as people don't want to be dumped on on Mondays, volume's dying down more and more. Either a new cycle starts when hedge funds stock up and then dump on the crowd at the end of it, or winter's coming.
Just my observation, but it seems like someone  (insert group, whale, institutions) is keeping it at these levels to accumulate. I could be wrong, but it sure looks that way.
I was considering giving away some bitcoins.. to a young guy...  he just graduated high school probably with a high grades.. .. and is a libertarian and a bitcoiner.. 

But then again - you should never give away real bitcoins... 

I'll just give him a hardware wallet.
Reposting this message from John McAfee.  He speaks truth here. Worth the 2 minute listen:

I’m sure I read a futures contract ends today. Does anyone think this may cause a run?
Bitfinex low volume is getting scary. 
lol bitcoin is testing support
History repeating pump->dump->bear market? Things i bought with bitcoin ehm 🙈
Well I’ve been totally accurate so far people. BTC between $6800-$7700.
Deja vu. Why does this shit look so familiar. The last time prices were a straight line, it was at 6.5k. This must mean we are close to the bottom. Even though I think the bottom is around 7k.
Don't let bears get to your head. Stay agnostic to your charts:

Good luck :)
coincidence that the volume is so low after the report of US wants to go after manipulators? i think not!. they all stopped maybe lol
I hope these whales realize they're negatively affecting people's lives. I haven't invested anything I can't afford to lose but if this shit took off I'd definitely be able to spend more time with my kids. I make great money but I work 80 hrs a week and maybe spend 4 hrs a week with my kids. Pump btc to 50k and give me the freedom to spend some quality time with them please!!
told yall.. see ya at 6k.  might goto 5 this time.
im buying on the way down so it doesnt matter.  i know it'll go back up, could be months from now..  but it will..  i just buy on the dips and average cost the ride.
When this bear market endS? Does anybody knows?
1K

HERE WE COOOOOME
Well, maybe 7200 is a hole, it would be great, and start next rally to 10k.... but right now is 50/50. 
we're crashing again
Lower.
Why are you guys still hodling BTC, isnt it time to sell for a blockchain project with an actual future?
I don’t like to reveal my technical analysis since I’m right 90% of times and I’m so convinced whales read the daily discussion...thus the butterfly effect. But, I predicted this weekend of stagnancy just like I knew last week would fall miserably. So, what’s happening next week? More stagnancy.. Bitcoin will not fall below $6700 until June; however it will hit $7K by month’s end before recovering a few hundred dollars. We have some very unexciting times ahead. That’s just the cold hard truth. Whales right now want people to be comfortable with stagnancy as opposed to sharp falls. They will continue to manipulate volume to lure inexperienced traders and daytraders which represents the bulk of their new money during stagnant days. As soon as people see stability through stagnancy, they will look away come June 5-6 where another big drop take place far below $6700 to $6300 and beyond. Until then, Bitcoin will remain between $6800-$7700.
No manipulation. BTC is legit like everything that leads to a sharing of easy money to all its commercial actors involved
This Dick MUST be preserved !!!!

BUY BTC !!

(#KeepTheDickOn)

the problem is no\-one more cares probably :D
How dare they!
I'd prefer it was being manipulated in one direction!
I love how these big whales are so malicious. One last short squeeze before a huge dump. Just to fuck everyone up.
whales are in control rn. 
Says your intuition which is based on nothing. I’m a shorter and I’ve been winning over the past few weeks.
Exactly. This is what the government exists to protect us from.
Yep, you want an unregulated market ... don't complain about what happens in an unregulated market.
Main fud topics are tied to regulations and ban, not manipulation
I always read when they end but never when thy start
BCash should be priced < a hundred dollars like all other hard forks - maybe it is gradually finding its level.
bit-con trash
Gone down to 40k since I posted that 6 mins ago
I see different numbers
btc religion loosing sheepies.... shabat shalom mazel tow bitchez
Winter is coming,  but we have a few more weeks of Fall to get through.

see what I did there?
Do you mean they have chosen to stop buying? What do you think they are doing to keep it at this level?
If they wanted to accumulate, it would be better to simply crash and pick up the pieces...

No no no, they want the Fiat... and the whalers are fighting amongst themselves now.
Are you the guy who gave his son an Action Man 'Deserter' action figure for Xmas?
Maybe put something on the HW wallet, your call though.
So, you gave him something because he graduated?

When I graduated form high-school, my father told me that I was just fulfilling my obligation. He also told me I should be the one offering him a present, since he paid for everything.
Holy shit. Lmao. He’s wild 
damn, he’s really packing it on lol 
we are slaves, but the most people love it  because they dont have the brains to live there own life
Good story, how does it relate to cryptos though? How will cryptos safe us from being 'slaved'? 
Come to Jeebus
He needs to change the battery in his smoke detector.
He’s obviously drugged out of his mind even though he’s making several sound reasonable statements. The only question is what drugs is he on? And my guess is it’s certainly some  hallucinogens (lsd, mushrooms, etc) but also mixed a little with stimulants like cocaine, amphetamine, etc. I would take anything he says with a grain of salt. I mean this is a 72 yr old murderer, pedophile, drugs abuser... he is like the ultimate piece of shit who got lucky working for Lockheed at the right time giving him the needed inspiration to create McAfee antivirus software. His life today is like his net worth: it’s tanked completely...how would you feel if you lost 96% of your peak net worth? $4 million is still a lot of money but if I lost 96% of my worth, I guarantee you I would be rambling on Twitter, sedated and stimulated with drugs...providing spontaneous misconceived lectures on philosophy, economy and history...hoping to maintain some sense of relevance in my life that has no purpose...John McAfee.

He is kind of a bandit. He organized pumps and dumps and involved in ripping off people.

He is bad for crypto money. Actually we should neglect him.
CME futures expired yesterday, iirc Bitmex at the same time, not sure about OKEx.
What’s new?
Nawh.  It actually being manipulated 
Yeah, feel the same. Higher lows each time.
Thank you my brudda. 
i agree thanks for the info 
Whalers care about profit. Don't expect other thing than that.

Realise that you're probably being hopelessly optimistic.

Answer this: Why *should* bitcoin hit 50k? Even if you believe in the technology, it's not going to hit 50k just because you want it to. 

If you believe in the tech, leave your BTC where it is and HODL. Don't even think about it and stop expecting to retire in the next 10 minutes.

If you don't, sell now and forget about it. 
Please don't complain about not profitting quickly on a volatile market. Be realistic when making any kind of investment. Markets are always going to be manipulated, and manipulators only care about THEIR profit. Make their actions work in your benefit by playing your cards right.
> I hope these whales realize they're negatively affecting people's lives. 

That's their goal - to fuck with as many people as they can before going into their direction that they favour. 
Sounds like you're doing it to yourself.  
It will never hit 10K, so yeah - spend more time with your kids - they are only real investment you have, dummy...
Much more profitable to short down and cover low. Then, you can re\-evaluate which way to bet and will have the cash to do so.
Well... one of my favorite movie quotes is from the Crow when he said "it can't rain ALL the time"
When your H1-B visa is approved.
In ten minutes. 
1BTC here we come.
Korean fud, we've seen that before
FUDster motherfucka, mods ban his ass now! It won't go below 4k boyz - buy ze dip, lamboz are waiting!
ye right 50/50. You know there are more options like a rally to 8k and then down again?

but if it is 50/50. I guess you took out a big long than stop loss 6700 profit target 10000. Still 1:6 risk reward ratio looks great but people on reddit never put their money where their mouth is and just write random numbers : \)
Agree we are really 50/50. 

Barrier to grow is the double top at 11700 and for down, if we look on past years, it already decrease 80%, that is almost 3900 based on actual most time high. No one think going so low, but can append.

With new actors and futures, the security of the protocol and is usability in the real world, with cheap fees of lightning protocol are the keys of success. 
Oh no we suck again, are we getting close.to the pincher pattern or something of that sort?
Wu is worried about a 51% attack on shitcoin cash.

Could only happen to a shitcoin, never to BTC.
If bitcoin falls, ALL coins will have an nuclear winter after that.
like Verge, Bitcoin Gold, or Mona?  

Those that got a 51&#37; attack recently?  

You know which others coins can easily suffer another 51&#37; attack? almost everything else.
PPC? Pretty sure PeerCoin faded into obscurity a few years ago.
> since I’m right 90% of times

lol
R/iamverysmart
Cool man
Based off the history of bitcoin this actually looks to be the case. We are falling into a hibernation period but we will eventually return to similar highs like last year and possibly even higher. 
Shocking! Bitcoin was supposed to reach 1M/btc without any market movement or adoption, by sheer existence alone.
That leads to injury and blindness.
Keep hodling till the price rises.IT will helps you gains eventually...

Giveth and taketh.  HOLD
Yeah, still this foreplay BS is annoying.
So tedious though
Why are you even entertaining him?
Some hard life lessons being learned here hopefully. 
some start years before
Why do you hate BCash so much it just tripled in a month from $600 to $1800 before the dip, those returns are better then what bitcoin will get you all year
I see dead people
No, they pull stops to a certain depth, then they slowly buy over a period of time without bouncing the price too high. Wash, rinse, repeat.
Not if they don't  want to scare all the peasants.  They like to leave a little ray of hope.
Have you read *atlas shrugged*? That idea of giving.. 

This guy has no problem making money.. he will most likely be a self-made millionaire(or whole-coiner) at some point.  
Nevermlnd.  Defeats purpose you would have seed.
Your father sounds like an asshole.
Has to stop listening though after I realized his smoke detector battery was dying 
especially when you still need to work for fiat to buy crypto with at this point lol 
I’m surprised it took this long for the feds to launch an investigation. 
I hardly see us going under 6k. I have been monitoring Bitcoin price history daily for years.
I'll be fine regardless of what happens in this market. I don't care if it takes 10 months or 10 years to profit but when it's being manipulated drastically it's hurting the market and a lot of people in the process.
That was just rude and unpleasant.
US criminal authority aren't Korean, duuuude....
I think not but im still waiting until it rises again, I think it depends on community news.
Winter? Try decade.
There always have been stagnant periods of time between volatile seasons. This is just Bitcoin being Bitcoin, nothing to worry about.
Exactly! How dare people buy or sell it they are manipulating the price lol
And baldness, I heard.
nope, these folks never learn......
I thought Bcash was to save babies - what's all this talk of its price Bcasher?
It tripled its dollar value because Bitcoin tripled, and shitcoins are tethered to bitcoin.
Close your eyes to make sure their mind is dead too
Ah! The big FOMO emitters, which attract every noob out there into spending their savings, in the hopes of getting lambos...

I wonder how many hopes have been smashed in these last months... 
A very shitty book written out of hate. Overextended for its content and lacked imagination. 
It is incredible how 3 movies were made from such a shitty book. 

It's a book for the simple minded. Then again, so is Objectivism.
you know she died poor and was on welfare for the last part of her life, right? 
Ayn Randers are like Scientologists:  batshit crazy with that wide eyed stare.
I also might give him a token paper wallet with a small amount.
I though that at the time, until I wen't work in the real life, where no presents are given for doing my job. 
he has freed himself of being a slave to the smoke detector and it’s whims 
"Investigation" The SEC on WS is just there to make retail feel like there's some kind of policing force. When in all acctuallity the don't do squat. Same thing with this so called investigation, just a show. $ talks everyone else is a observer.

LOL if you think there is A) Anything they can do about it or B) will be able to find it. 

The government is famous for taking problems under investigation to try and fix it. This is a psychological ploy to make people think the governement is all powerful. When in fact they can't even stop Stupid kids from choking on kinder egg toys. 
I agree, I'm thinking 6800~ range but the looks of it.
But you don't mind if BTC is manipulated UP?

Who is talking about Lambos? 
I hope a lot..... greedy must be punished...
Why so much hate on objectivism...? just because you just feel hate?
It is not as bad as the story of karl marx

But you do get a present for doing your job. That is what getting paid is. My parents gave me a gift for graduating highschool and college. I got a well paying job afterwards and am doing just fine. I don’t exactly see the correlation between getting a gift for graduation and not functioning when you “wen’t to work in the real life”.
Lol
What's comical is that people believe the hypocrisy which is the government. 'This dip is because the government is investigating market manipulation'. Isn't releasing this news manipulation in and of itself?? If there was a real reason for a competent government to examine wrong doing and manipulation, with actual intent to penalize, fix, and regulate it, they would have done so long ago whilst keeping it as hush as possible. The fact is that the US government is as big of crooks as those manipulating the crypto market and a lot less competent too. They are just too dumb to realize that crypto markets will never be completely regulated if at all. These dips are fully the cause of large money interests (governments included) manipulating price in order to shake out scared bitcoin owners so that they can accumulate; simple as that.
Or that the powers of US regulators are largely restricted, by both law and practicality, to enforcing against manipulators within US jurisdiction. If somebody in Asia or Russia manipulates, good luck to their doing anything except maybe sending a nasty letter by international mail.
Nope!
You sold it then?
32MB per block... 

How many nodes are online after two years of full nodes... 

And all that talk about 1GB blocks... 

Yes! putting twitter like features on the chain is not going to play out well.

You're*
What about the time when it lost it all again after the fork?
*"Lambos"* -> The hopes and dreams of every millennial who thinks they can get it without actually having to work for them.
I was criticizing the book. 


at least that fucker worked for his money and he didn't die poor or on welfare like ayn Rand 

BUT still a great book :-)
That's not a present. That's the payment for my work. 
**Getting paid is NOT a present. It is an obligation from the employer to the employee in return for the employee's executed work.**

A present is a offer a person gives to another person, without having to receive something in return.
Agree 100%
Ya
Still got some btc though just making a point the Bcash isn’t Btrash 
Look buddy, I don’t give a fuck about your nodes and blocks.  Keep worshipping your bitcoin and small gains while I’m making maximum profit 
Sorry man, I didn’t know this was English class.
No, I get the term. What does that have anything to do with what I said?
ah, same folk that "voted" Bernie ;)
Fine, if you see it that way. But you still fail to address the other 90% of my comment.
And yet it is.
Good for you.

Keep up the good work!
The ray of hope -> The hope to achive the lambo.
Sorry to disappoint but I'm not US American. 
Ahh, gotcha.
sorry to hear...
