Daily Discussion, May 13, 2018 -- TITLE
Remember when people were complaining that $100 was too high for Bitcoin? Then it went to $1,000. Remember when it dipped back down to $350 and everyone thought Bitcoin was dead? Then it went to $20,000. Remember that time it dipped to $8,000? Oh yea, that's right now.﻿

Does anyone have any experience with London Block Exchange (https://lbx.com/)? It looks like finally there is an exchange which accepts payments from UK bank accounts in £GBP.

I think The Bart™  just closed.  Bought the dip 
Volume is so low right now. Next move may be up or down but either way it will be again an irrational +/-10%
Is this a legit rebound?

Suppose you are in a mining pool with hash power α relative to the entire bitcoin network. Suppose that the difficulty is such that it is expected to take β hashes to mine the next block. If the difficulty of mining a share in
your pool is γ, answer the following questions in terms of α, β, and γ (the mining reward is 12.5BTC):
(a) How many shares is your pool expected to “mine”? 
(b) What is the expected reward for your pool?
(c) What is the expected reward per share, if 99% of the reward goes to those who mined shares?

I sold out for $8300 a couple of weeks ago and regretted it.So obviously I'm hoping to get back in sub $8k.It looks like it could be a possibility in the net day or two.You can't predict this stuff.
First
Up Up & Awaaaaaa. bitcoins dead.
Yes! I prep coins.

https://www.bitgild.com/ is great! and I have verified that the coins are authentic.

Remember when the death of the emperor Nero in AD68 was followed by a brief period of civil war in 69?  Four emperors in one year - madness.  Those were the days.
Remember when Bobby Boucher showed at halftime and the Mud Dogs won the Bourbon Bowl?!

Remember when you and I held hands and promised never to part?  Then you ran off with that barmaid who turned out to be a coal miner from Utah with breast implants?  I bloody remember mate..
Remember when BTC was 19,700 USD  :)

Think one thing and bitcoin does the opposite.
Kind of like this place.
They should just use r/Bitcoin.  We have far more noobs.
To the moon or missing it?
Does the man have Parkinson?
In essence, he is saying that the cost of production will increase and consequentially, the price will increase (regardless of demand or value generated).

Yeap, he's high.
His interviews are must watch material.  Truly a fascinating guy. 
me and another guy; °), it should be all ..

Flip a coin.  

That is as accurate as any expectation, projection, calculation or whatever analysis.
Aye Aye..Capn!!!!
Make it so.
Looks like a scam. 
Address registered as Canary Wharf.

What you can do with all these guys is make a couple of small test transactions for minimum amounts.

Also, why not give them a call?

You can buy from individuals using localbitcoin etc.
Waiting for the android app, but the fees look horrendous.
Drop to $8420 needed for that. 
Bart has a bad haircut today 
That could be a huge bear flag breaking out...
Price seems to go up when volume is low lately.
Looks like The Bart ™ may be closing off now. 
Dead cat.
I am in fear of an inverse March Simpson.
Looks like a bart for sure 

Edit:  if it magically breaks the 8650 resistance level it could escape the bart. 
Well, a lot of them made solid profits shorting above 9.5 and closing at 8.2.

Seems that it's building up today again.
Written in Canadian?
Bitcoin has the same averaged 10 minute confirmation times for all blocks since it was created.

You should just hodl until you learn how it works.  If you want instant transactions, use lightning.
Thank you as always for the insightful comments, The BitcoinAlways.
I guess you needed the money to reattach your dick?
Wow lol this u will regret 
How much did you have?
What are you talking about?  It is currently sub $8k so go buy if you want.

Too funny!
Great story, love to hear more!
5 years from now we'll be saying: "remember when BTC was $100k? Damn, that was cheap".
As was last year's rise to $20k.  Pump'ed by Tether.
But if you think it'll be the opposite...doesn't that mean it'll come true?
He wents to fly to the dark side of the moon xD
I think he's high on drugs. 
Hey I have a berry like that
Cap'n we ain't have enough power, we're going to have to eject the dilithium crystals into the sun and surf the shockwave...
You got your Bart m8!
How longs it been like this?
I'm trying to figure out what the bart simspon pattern is... I'm picturing the shape of his silhouette, but idk if thats what it is? What the hell is the Bart Simpson and Marge Simpson pattern!?!?!? Lol
or English
😆
It's always a pleasure. 
Yup.
.20
It’s above 8k.

8500 > 8000
Member chewbacca?!
'tis too painful.
Just recently actually. Normally huge price swings in either direction involved large volumes.  But just watching bitstamp, all of the upward movement the last month or so has been when 24h volume is under 10k btc.  
Price jumps suddenly with a big green candle/dildo pissing off the bears.  Then stays choppy with small up and down oscillations for a while creating small spikes. Then it suddenly drops with a big red dildo leaving many bulls butt hurt.   The end result looks like Bart Simpson’s head.  

There is also the upside down bart pattern which is the the reverse of the above. 
K let us know how it all works out.  
Oh okay lol
Sorry ... silly me.
