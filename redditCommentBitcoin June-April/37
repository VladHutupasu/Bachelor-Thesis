sent a little btc back to gdax to sell, and it promptly tanked. goddamn it.
#~~**IT'S OVER 9,000**~~

~~*Nevermind...~~

#**IT'S OVER 9,000**
I've been putting in all my spare fiat since late last year, and though the price is important, what's MORE IMPORTANT is the fact that every day the crypto industry as a whole is getting more developed and adopted- and daddy BTC gets more exposure. The future is bright :D
lel, 303 BTC sell wall @9310 on gdax. Somebody use Jedi mind tricks to make it disappear.
Alright boys. Get ready for the biggest pumped weekend ever. 3....2.....1.....
**COME ON BULLS!**
Btc keep going up...yeah baby! :) 
[deleted]
A lot of people on here are spoiled brats who have no idea how markets work, btc is up quite a bit from yesterday, yet people are bitching because it went down a little in the past hour? Every investment/currency goes up and down, the key is going up more than you go down, if you are gonna freak out every time it goes down, than you shouldn't be investing in anything, let alone crpto where the swings are a lot larger.
why people are shorting now is beyond me. Begging to be burnt. Been saying it all week lol
TA: A bit wibbly wobbly at the mo.
This is probably the wrong place to ask. As a freelance graphic designer that's never worked in coding or anything along those lines, how would I get in touch with someone coding a wallet so I could help out with a the UI design? I just think it would be cool to use a wallet that I helped out with.
Thanks
I am considering that perhaps bulls were merely consolidating liquidity during the previous $100 upwards pump + dump, since they didn't attempt to defend the gains. Could be interesting. If 9.2k holds, possibly a good sign, if it doesn't, back to 8.8k perhaps.

[EDIT] I know that some bulls out there have been doing great. If it turns out that you don't have sufficient backing at 9.2k then that's not your fault. If you get backing, then let's hope that backing sticks for a while. The sell pressure has been a bit hard lately at these levels.
Bogdanoff, plz. Letz 9k be ze bottom.
To be honest, I won't really have confidence in any sudden pumps right now. I'd rather see some stabilization at a point where the price can be defended properly. First we need to test where the floor is.

If sellers are so eager to sell, let them sell plenty at sub 9k, then we might ascend again with less sell pressure.
wtf just happened?
https://cryptowat.ch/markets/bitfinex/btc/usd/5m

WTF

/e: https://datamish.com/d/000000004/btcusd?refresh=20s&orgId=1&from=now%2Fd&to=now%2Fd

Wow. Soros fat fingered a trade lol.
Above 9k at this weekend would be a progress and appreciated so we can start the 10k rallye next week with fresh money 

huge fight at 9350 at bitfinex now. if it falls, we might dip a bit 
east coast taking as back again, weak hands
is it really the rally towards 10k

Potential cup and handle playing out?
What is a minimum functional amount when attempting to buy dips in BTC?  To clarify what I mean is, Whats the least amount to use to make a day trade while absorbing the fees?
Are these little pull backs bear traps?
Lower.
I think we're about to see sharp move up on Bitcoin. Falling wedge which is about to close. Those normally have sharp reversals. 
Hi guys, a quick question: I was wondering about an aspect of margin trading. I don't know wether this is important but let's say I got 10,000 USD in my margin account. I would like to know what is the difference between opening a short position of 5 BTC volume with 2x leverage and 2BTC volume with 5x leverage, I would have thought that I would get the same gains as long as the price dips right? I just want to confirm wether my knowledge is on point.
is Mt Gox reason for this dip ?
Pump eet 
Well, the Europeans don't seem to be too bullish. I guess we'll have to thank the Asians for saving the day...
Meanwhile, over on the naughty step:

You know, r/btc don't have a daily discussion.  

There's fucking nothing to talk about, except whinging, moaning and more mad conspiracy theories.

Their latest thing is the phrase **Becash or begone**

Which is supposed to be some sort of advertising genius tag-line - well it would be, if it wasn't wanky and embarrassingly poor.


Europe wakes up ...

There is a strong, smart, pissed off generation coming up. I’m 26 and I don’t think my generation has the vision nor any older generation but my nephews are 11 and know this stuff better than most people. 

If it’s not adopted soon, it will idle for ten years and than explode but we don’t know what this world will do this year. It’s crazy. I work in military. The coming years don’t look good. We need this now. 
I wish my generation and up were smart enough to realize that we need adoption now or we ourselves wont enjoy the freedom it brings. It’s mind numbing why bitcoin supports aren’t as passionate for adoption as the scam artist Ver is passionate scamming people. I hate the man. He stole money from me and my family with his bait and switch but I like his passion that he knows we need adoption now, not later. 
Friday, the legendary FOMO Day. 
Good morning everyone, just arrived to work and it is nice to see that we are above $9,300. Hopefully, we see some more ppl buy more btc especially since today is payday. I receive a bonus today so might put some of the money on crypto. Also, I hope we get to 10k by the weekend and hold it there in order for us to go above the $10k mark next week. 
This market needs to stop letting Ver add confusion. It’s getting criminal!!  If people want to buy Bcash, let them but don’t allow Ver to do  the bait and switch!! If my parents got conned, there has to be thousands of other pissed off families. Ideology (I know Andreas says no one owns the name) has to stop that no one owns the name when people (adoption) looking to use bitcoin are getting scammed out of thousands of dollars. Congress will act if we don’t. Please step up and don’t let this continue. 
Where do you guy see the price in late juli or early August 
What do we think of bitcoinwisdom.com? I've used it for tracking price for years but are there better alternatives?
I think it's time soon for the next leg up...

But maybe only to test 9.4k, because that's the upper border of the uptrend channel. Will be hard to break that...

*If* it breaks through it will either be corrected immediately, or it will start a bull run.

Please don't be another trap....
MACD and RSI cools off but didnt go further down.  I have good hopes on this.
Thou shall not pass 9.2k!

Big ol' dump
Did Charlie Shrem ever get 1&#37; of all bitcoin?
https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#3m

It is worrisome that fees are going up no matter how insignificant. Segwit and Lightning should fix this problem by now. It’s the #1 indicator we look at abd if it continues going up, it can’t be a currency. As soon as we approach $10k, fees go up. It shows what would happen if it goes back to ATH. 
Hey guys I'm a noob so forgive my noobness but had a question. I'm new to the crypto game and bought some bitcoin this morning and transferred it to my binance account. It's been over 10 hours and I still haven't received it in binance. I double checked the wallet address from the sending app and it's correct. Is this normal for bitcoin? I'm kind of freaking out. Should I be?
If we go back under 9k, at least that will be interesting.
Friday evenings are usually big pumps so
Question: Why are companies attempting to represent digital assets with non-Bitcoin blockchain tokens? What is the meat and potatoes of the reason? (Referring to things like the 'Eliocoin' not any of the Roger nonsense.)

Why can't the types of functionality that allow for these digital assets tokens, just be a normal part of the primary Bitcoin chain?

Is this the inspiration for Gmaxwell's sidechain crew?
God damn we gotta hold the 9000 wall.
TA: Classic 9k teaser pattern continues to consolidate.
I swear there are only like five people buying and selling right now. How can it be that I set to buy at a certain price and NOBODY else's trades aggregate to my price? - Say I'm buying 0.05214 BTC at $9150.01 the amount of BTC stays at 0.05214 at $9150.01 as I wait for my order to get filled.
[deleted]
Let the weekend pump begin! 
Well that didn’t last 
Nearly 10.000 coins traded in 5 minutes on Bitfinex. 
Big sideway movements. Something big gonna happen soon. 
I think back to $9 800 today. $9 400 is gone. 
**Pullback Over? Bitcoin Retakes $9K, Eyes Further Gains**

https://www.coindesk.com/pullback-over-bitcoin-retakes-9k-eyes-further-gains/

Having recovered from a five-day low hit yesterday, bitcoin (BTC) has potential for a move higher towards major resistance at $9,880, the technical charts indicate.

The cryptocurrency moved back above $9,000 in the Asian hours after the pullback from the recent high of $9,767 ran out of steam around the ascending (bullish) 4-hour 50-candle moving average (MA).

As of writing, BTC is trading at $9,251 on Bitfinex, representing marginal losses over the previous day's close (as per UTC) of $9,270.

A bearish follow-through to Wednesday's bearish outside-day reversal would have been bad news for the bulls, but BTC instead appreciated by 4.5 percent on Thursday, keeping them in the game. Had BTC closed yesterday below $8,765 (Wednesday's low), the bears would have had the upper hand for the short-term.

View **The pullback seems to have ended at $8,652, leaving bitcoin set to scale the resistance at $9,280 (double top neckline) and rise towards the 200-day MA located at $9,878.**
What in the actual fuck? Fuck the east coast. Seriously.
Can someone explain to me one thing? Is BTC an investment or a currency? Because in order for BTC to eventually take a major adoption by people it will first need to stablize. As of rightnow people are using it as an investment. Im think crypto has amazing potential but what is the goal if theres no stability?
I’m a broke college student until May. I put in 200 and have 500 right now. I don’t wanna sell, but idk. I need money for food lol. 

Suggestions? Grind it out? Any solid resistance predictions?

*EDIT*
I sold all my bitcoin. Luckily I sold it at the peek for these last 3 weeks (LUCKILY). Now I’m working and making good money. Time to re-invest now that it’s dropping hard again. Thanks for the advice m8s!!

Bitcoin saved my ass in college. Nice story. 😎
Thou shall not pass $9,220!

Alright US....Can we keep it above 9k this morning?
Will btc reach 10k soon?
I told you, back to 8800 😂
[removed]
Looks like we're losing all progress again. I genuinely think 9.7k was the top for the a bit of time.
  
in 10 min market opens and manipulation starts. Fuck wallstreet. 
It was super obvious that it will drop to 8800

Hope so, was a disappointing week.

This is a propaganda against hodlers. 
Where did you order from?  I bought one a few days ago from the official website. I heard a lot of people had problems with the Amazon ones.
Like at all? Over the last year they added a lot of things to it that made it a little more complicated to use. It’s possible you are in the wrong chain or network 
I believe many people here actually bought in higher than the current price. Theyre not spoiled but either scared or losing hope.
I think it's mostly short-sellers trying to spread panic once the price drops a little, in the hopes that it'll drop further and they profit.
You talk like an over privileged whale yourself. Yea people freak out because many have invested their hard earned money without having seen any gains and only negative return on their return. It’s very normal to freak out when whales are constantly manipulating the market. Yea maybe these peoples shouldn’t be investing but it’s addictive especially when you’re trying to recoup your losses. Your arrogance and condescending attitude is not necessary here, you ass.
I disagree. It's going straight up. Soon we'll reach the end of the wedge and then it'll have to decide...

GDAX leading the dump again, New York preparing for the weekend
Dafuk was that
No.......
fees should just be a percentage of the overall value of the trade.  multiply your buy/sell x 100bps \(or whatever your fee is\) and subtract that from your profit.

Also multiply by .28 to set aside the tax pmt for uncle scam
Thought so...
Exposure is exposure. The margin is simply how much money you have to open the trade.  So in your example you have either $50 000 or $20 000 to trade. $10 000 x 5 leverage or $10 000 x 2 leverage.

How much of that you use \(your exposure\) determines your profits or losses. The temptation is always to put down a bigger position, so you only have $10k of your own funds, but you can put down $25k \(this is your exposure\) on a position and incur profits and losses of the $25k position, not the $10k you have.

You have to be extremely careful with margin on Crypto's. These things lose up to 50&#37; or gain up to 100&#37; in a few hours. So lets say you chose to go 5:1 and put down $25 000 on a short and Bitcoin doubles. You'll lose your account and then some. In fact it will be a loss of \-$12 500 and you only have a $10 000 account.

The correct use of margin is actually to reduce broker or third party exposure. So instead of depositing $10 000 with your broker, you only deposit $2000. But with the margin you still have $10 000 to trade. That way if the broker folds you still have 80&#37; of your money left. If your position gets into trouble you can bail yourself temporarily and remove the money again when the crises is over.  This reduces the amount of time your money is exposed to a third party's risk.

Hope that helps and made it a bit clearer.
No difference.  If x is the price change:

5x X 2 = 2x X 5 = 10x.  

With 10k, your account is cleaned out when:

a.  Price drop by $1k when you go long.
b.  Price increase by $1k when you go short.
In both scenario's your cash equity is $10,000 at the time the trade closes.  You are able to short 10 BTC with proceeds from the short sale being $100,000 ($10,000/btc) leaving $110,000 as your total assets, but your equity will be $110,000-10*BTC so as the price of bitcoin drops the value of your equity increases so both cases are the same. 
I don't know how to margin trade, but I just have to tell you that if you came to this sub to ask how to short BTC, people will probably think you're trolling :)
no
* 1- 1800 btc are mined daily
* 2- if those coins arent buyed at the current price, then the price will fall until that coins will be buyed.
* 3- goto 1

bitcoin isnt like gold, gold supply is controlled by price, if price increase gold production increase, if price decrease production decrease. In bitcoin 1800 coins are mined daily.

Fees are currently at 1 sat to get into the next block https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#1,2h

People should learn to look up there own fee rather than use the wallet default which is normaly alot higher than needed.
Lightning Network won't affect fees until ppl can actually use it to pay for daily goods. That's still a ways away, we need more channels open, more nodes, and more liquidity available. That will come with time as the applications that use LN and make it more accessible to users are developed, and as more stores start accepting it. There's a network effect with LN where we need to reach larger adoption before it really becomes useful. When it does, it will start chewing away at on\-chain transaction fees since a lot will be off\-chain. Until then, help support LN and persuade vendors to support it :\)
Don't worry. The use as currency is still years away, much time to optimize... 
Thats not normal. Where u bought the btc? And youve sent it to the deposit adress which is shown on binance?
This isn't normal, maybe post some screenshots so we can see whats going on?
Cause they can’t control Bitcoin?
Cause they want centralized tokens?
Bitcoin's technology is fairly limited, so the sooner we look for more high throughput solutions the better. Something like Steemit couldn't run on top of Bitcoin without completely flooding the main chain in it's current state. (1.4 million average transactions per day)
This miner is hodling his proceeds and keeping them off the market.

Yo welcome! :D
They spent all their money on shitcoins..  :)
Because the current price on your exchange is higher and people will prefer to sell to buyers who are offering higher price.

Duh?
It could be your exchange has low volume. Which one are you using?
I don't use binance, but I can tell you that UTC is the official timezone for Bitcoin trading. e.g. daily candles close and open at 0:00 UTC.
Very far from over. I think we'll go take out the high of that spike. 
But price ended up the same. Could it have been the Mt. Gox guy finally selling? If so, he sold many of them for too little. Or maybe it was someone getting liquidated?  
As more people get into Bitcoin (either for investment or for use), adoption and liquidity increases and volatility decreases. On the longterm trend, volatility is decreasing.
Stability will come with liquidity.

Recommended: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYvvSV4mjH0
the long term goal is .... you are at risk that one day your government will face difficult problems and will decide to solve their problems by creating lots of new money.

 They can create their new money at the press of a button, to create trillions is as easy as creating billions or millions.

 You may live today in an advanced country, but the day may still come in 20 or 30 years time.

 You may have worked hard to accumulate 100,000 dollars, and it could get wiped out by hyperinflation.

The fixed production schedule of bitcoin removes this possibility, so as long as lots of people reach consensus that it is valuable, then that is why it should hold it's value, even if governments mismanage things.
Take a look at the ideas behind "sound money." You might find some answers there.
It's whatever your imagination wants it to be!
It will stabilize as more and more people hold and use it.  I think it will take a few years before that level of adoption occurs.  For now it is the investment of a lifetime.  In a couple of years using it to pay for things will be second nature. 
now is a pure 100% gambling...
50% go up
50% go down
Take out your 200 and keep the 300 profit on btc. 
Omg you shouldn’t be gambling with monthly bills money 💰.     This type of behavior is the cause of much of the stupid panic selling.  

If you believe John McAfee’s prediction that bitcoin will be worth 1 million each by end of 2020 then your $500 investment could be worth 50,000 by then. Your choice.

> Why do I keep seeing people compare saving in bitcoin to saving USD like there's no other place you could possibly store your money?

I don't think folks act like there is no other place to store our money, rather we believe Bitcoin is better than a system where a private party can arbitrarily print additional currency which reduces the purchasing power of the money we already have.

> You have to be extremely careful with margin on Crypto's. These things lose up to 50% or gain up to 100% in a few hours. So lets say you chose to go 5:1 and put down $25 000 on a short and Bitcoin doubles. You'll lose your account and then some.

The part I don't get is the leveraging. Just to follow your example, let's say I borrow 25k USD and open a short when BTC hits the price of 10k USD. With a leverage of 5:1 would't my margin of 10k USD get liquidated *way* before the price of BTC hit 20k USD? The math behind leveraging gets me confused :s
Oh snap, I thought I was in the right place. Do you know which sub would be more appropiate?

That said, I hadn't considered that interesting bit of difference between bitcoin and other markets.
That's the most cockeyed logic I've seen in years.

Gold miners don't mine slower or less when the price is low. Too expensive to be at anything but peak production. They simply hoard the gold till they can get a better price.

Similiarly a Bitcoin miner doesn't have to sell. They can also hold for a better price.
Someone should hack your btc wallet for such a stupid logic.

yeah the depost address in binance matches the address I sent it to. I'm 100% certain on this aspect. I bought in the IOS cash app which doesn't note teh transaction ID so I can't check confirmations like in other apps...last time I use this app I know that.
..and thanks for the response thomas
I looked on the blockchain for the address I sent it to and there's no record at all so something's up. I sent a message to support for the cash app and I'll post what they tell me when they respond. Thanks everyone for your quick responses I really appreciate it.
GDAX
I’m hoping for that too😆
As far as I heard, Mt. Gox coins went to Kraken, not Bitfinex.
So crypto is only a temporary investment?
100 percent go up mate. 

Just zoom out the chart.  ....

Money always travel from impatient hands to patient hands.
I have split in bcash and bcoin. I assume getting rid of the bcash is the better option?
Not a bad option to consider as well ...
I have all my bills paid, $100 in the bank, and $500 in Bitcoin. 

$100 to survive two weeks. Starting work, I’ll be making $800-$1200 a week depending on the construction site. I’m not sure if I should cash in the Bitcoin for a little more wiggle room though. I’m afraid it’ll boost.

I sold 0.25 Bitcoin at 6k, and a month later it went to 20k, so I’ve been a bit more skeptical selling my coin since then.

That’s why I’m wondering when the next resistance will be. 
I need to start charging for sex.

resistance is futile
(They could do with a few like him over at r/btc.)
Yeah that made sense..
say .....yah

Yes it would, look it's very simple. All the leverage does is give you more money. to trade. A $10k position short at 5:1 will give you exactly the same losses as a $10k position at 1:1. 

A $10k position is $10k regardless of  your leverage and will incur the same loss or profit at 5:1, 3:1 or 1:1. $10k is $10k.  

The broker will margin call you when their requirements are no longer met. So $25k position at 50% loss would be -$12.5. You only had $10k, so yes, account is gone.  
No worries, hopefully someone can help you out with an answer. I wish I could. I'm a bit new to all of this.

This is a good point. The mining investments is what changes the only difference is that more mining investment in gold mining means higher supply inflation, whilst bitcoin mining investment only affect the supply inflation barely.
He might be overstating the effect on the market, but he did succinctly describe a prime difference between BTC supply/demand and gold supply/demand that I had not considered before.
Maybe. Maybe they start selling off.
Ok, now we’re getting somewhere.  I’d say somewhere between $1000 and $20,000.
Ehm.nope? Dns issues..if you use cryptonite or take the warning seriuosly you are fine.
they just posted about withdrawal issues so I think I'm good. I just have to be patient. Thanks everyone for taking the time to respond.

$10k next 24 hours, maybe even $11k
It is temporarily an investment. At some point value will largely peak, or at least grow at a much slower rate, and volatility will reduce...

Past performance is not indicative of future returns.

Enjoy hodling my bags.
That's up to you. If you're asking me, I would sell the bcash and keep the Bitcoin. 
> That’s why I’m wondering when the next resistance will be.

Nobody knows. Bitcoin is unpredictable.
It pains me to say this but if I were in your position I would sell. You are just taking too great a risk. Build up a little cash buffer first to get you through your usual monthly expenses and then after that get back into bitcoin ASAP. 
I can say this I’ve regretted every sale I’ve made over the year looking back. Had I hodled all those times I made a small profit I’d have huge profits. But I did take profit and invest in alts 
Get a job snowflake
Although to be fair, as long as 8.7k-8.8k holds, if we drop back there, the general upwards trend is still fine. It's possible that the sell pressure has just been too strong for a while at this price altitude.
That's just rubbish. 

Here is where you can find real information on the subject:

Okay Thanks for Clarification
The "lawyer" moved btc from multiple wallets to one single wallet. Noone knows what this means. Every youtuber has already covered this topic and it already has been posted over 10 times in the daily threads
No it doesn’t. If you visit a stocks sub for example, I’m sure no one mentions Bitcoin. It doesn’t mean that Bitcoin doesn’t exist. That’s how communities work in general. 
It does, but I don't see what tether has to do with this. The folks who use tether expect that to happen and it's a feature of that crypto because it's a trade off....if you want to park your money into something that is not very volatile for a while, you can do so, and probably escape some tax liability in the process.
I just woke up, and it's at 9170. Did something happen?
Then he should have said: "It is super obvious that it will drop to 8800"
Yes - that was a poor display of probability :)
Yep.  Just a big, messed up, gdmble.

I don't know what I'd do without advisors like you :)

EDIT: You changed your spelling from gdmble to gamble, and didn't declare the edit.   :)
(Could some one else do this please, I'm getting bored.)
#It's A LITTLE OVER 9000

What's with the...is that supposed to be sarcasm? shorting creates buying pressure next time it dumps hard compare bitmex to gdax
I think you are confusing him further.

Assuming that BTC is $10k and his initial fund is $10k.  In which case, he can:

a.  Short 1 BTC (1x leverage, 100% equity)

b.  Short 2 BTC (2x leverage, 50% equity)

c.  Short 4 BTC (4x leverage, 25% equity)

Assuming 0% maintenance, he loses his $10k when:

a.  BTC reach $20k with 1 BTC

b.  BTC reach $15k with 2 BTC

c.  BTC reach $12.5k with 4 BTC

Anyway, he can't lose more than $10k.  Exchanges will impose a maintenance margin (e.g. bitfinex is 15%).  In which case, no matter how much he has leveraged, the exchange will liquidate and force sell when he loses $8,500.  Bitfinex's max leverage is 40% equity or 2.5x.

I hope it’s either $999 or $20,001.
You're right. It wasn't a hack in which they broke into people's wallets without their control. But what was done can still be termed a "hack," can it not? It seems like we're arguing semantics here..
I ll buy you a Kookaburra cricket kit if it does happen. 
Thanks for the clarifacation. Ive been looking into crypto for awhile now but i saw a video yesterday saying if its an investment its worthless
> Past performance is not indicative of future returns.

This gets repeated here like past performance is never indicative of future returns. When you look at Bitcoin up until now it's bloody likely.
I am not talking about past performance. I am saying zoom out and then it will be easier to trust the future.
Well, I’ve paid my rent and I have food in the fridge. I’m on campus for only 2 weeks until I go home and start making solid money. Idk if $100 is enough for 2 weeks of food and gas.

Also, my dad is always willing to give me money. I hate asking him for it though. Mexican pride thing. 

Also, I’m TOTALLY investing much of my summer money!
Yeah. I flaked this year. Had too much money and didn’t need a job. Next year I’m gonna work at least 20 hours a week. Lesson learned.
Yes. My secondary uptrend line is at 8900 right now. So that would still be fine, but not *that* great.

It would still be north of the McAfee-Dick-Line, though. :-)

It's also in line with the 200 hour moving average. There should be much support there.
[deleted]
Actually no, that guy is just full of bs.
Has the trustee made any public comments on what he doing by moving around this money?  Some transparency would be nice.   I think it’s utter bullshit that one guy artificially has the power to hold this market hostage. 
>If you visit a stocks sub for example, I’m sure no one mentions Bitcoin.

They also wouldn't compare saving in USD to saving in an index fund, because the comparison is moronic.
Just the artificial printing part. Nothing else really. 
It was super obvious that it will drop. It still is, but it used to be too.
IT'S UNDER 9000
Those.
How does shorting create buying pressure? When price drops, long positions on Bitmex get liquidated. GDAX doesn't have that problem. 

I'm not denying that GDAX drops harder than Bitmex, your reasoning just seems weird.
Tell that to the crowd that owned Chf at 50:1 two years ago or so. 

The brokers do their best, but if you're in the market with leverage there is no guarantee the broker can get you out before it goes negative. In the Chf example the change happened in 1 tick. From one quote to the next there was a 50% value change and nothing in between. Some brokers went under because of it. 
Ok this makes sense, thanks for clarifying. Btw, I didn't know you could short bitcoin with 1x leverage.
Well, yeah, but that’s early August.  No way does that happen in late July.
if it was a DNS issue, then it's not a hack at all, and it's not arguing semantics - if my car breaks down so that I can't get to my bank, my bank has not been hacked
Cricket not very big where I am. You can send one of them mini golf things. 
Don't mistake crypto with Bitcoin... I was only talking about Bitcoin. I stay away from everything else...
You think that bitcoin is going to be a thousand times as expensive as it is now at some undetermined point in the future?
That is literally what you're doing. You're looking at past performance and using it to forecast future returns.
Ok then. If your dad is willing to save your ass if you fall flat.  However, just realize that you are living on the edge.  

There’s definitely a huge upside potential with bitcoin.   Not sure where we are headed right now in the short term. Right now we are above 9k.  We have failed to break 10k over the past few days.  If we can’t do it by Saturday night then we could see another pullback to 8.7k levels.
Not sure what you really want people to tell you, seems like you want to hold, and so you should. Only really you know if it's financially feasible.

Why don’t you work 20 hours a week and get a job this week? 20 hours is nothing. 
Your posts doesn't make any sense.
not really
Let him dump it all at once and get it over with.

We will recover by the end of the year, plus extra.
I wonder how they value those stocks? Perhaps they compare it to.. I dunno, USD? 
Because Bitcoin strives to be a currency whereas stocks do not.
[I understood that reference!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndBjraV-3UY)


Not so obvious to me...
ITS OVER 9000
>shorting creates buying pressure next time it dumps hard compare bitmex to gdax

Please, do explain.
When you short something what do you do to close your position?
Yes, of course.  But with a max 2.5x and 15% maintenance like on bitfinex, it's unlikely to happen.  And frankly if it does, good luck to the exchanges trying to recoup the money.
But the DNS servers didn't break down -- someone hijacked them to redirect MEW customers to a phishing website in Russia. It's a fair point to say that the site itself was not hacked, but this was clearly a hack.

That will done at 11K
I think of BTC as a safer store of value opposed to risky alts 
Nice straw man.
You don't know what I am doing so stop making guesses.

By zooming out, you realize that peaks and troughs are normal part of this game irrespective of which asset. Hence one doesn't feel anxious when BTC drops by 200 pounds. It is just normal.

I am not predicting the future, I know the future. BTC will be over 100,000 in a few years, so get in and stop resisting 😄
Because I’m on campus and getting a job now would require me to stay the summer... Whereas in 2 weeks I go home to 20/hour, 60 hour weeks.

I do admit I SHOULD have gotten a job. I made bank last summer, but wasted thousands like a dumb child. 
Using USD to mark the value of a particular stock at any snapshot in time != comparing the performance of the stock with the performance of USD.
Look around you. Everyone here is treating it as a speculative investment.
RIP in pieces, Mitch.
It's not shorting, he got it the wrong way round.

It's long positions on margins.  When price drops, long positions on margins get liquidated and selling is forced by the exchange.  Which creates more selling pressure.

I am using Bitfinex, and I used my crypto positions as security to buy more coins on margin. And I see my available amount is climbing and climbing and climbing. The temptation of course is to keep adding and then you get hit by ones of these's \-50&#37; moves where both your security and your margin trades suddenly take a 50&#37; hit. Ja....so I keep the margin trades light.

Even 2.5:1 make me sweat with this lot. 
So even if the MEW URL was correct \-\- you used your bookmarked URL that you always used successfully before \-\-  you got misdirected to the phishing site?  If so, that is huge. How can you tell? 
Spot-on !
> treating it as a speculative investment.

Well its also that until the market rate normalizes  in 10 years or so. 
But like already said by somebody else.. this is a Bitcoin sub - most people here are confident it will go up and a lot of them probably wouldn't be here if they didn't. so they want more Bitcoin before it does..

Check out the Bitcoinmarkets sub and you'll see a completely different mind set...

Ok, so you still don't understand why they compare bitcoin with USD? wow
Apparently fools just ignored the warning that the site was insecure \-\- incredible. How could anybody do that?
https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2018/04/25/myetherwallet-dns-hijacking/

Here is an article that explains how it was apparently done. I wasn't affected by it personally. I don't know why people store their coin on a website they're not trading on.
Oddly enough the market was more normalized 7 years ago than it is today
Bitcoin markets is where the adult bitcoiners post. 
Feel free to elaborate on why comparing the performance of USD over a period of time with the performance of bitcoin over the same is a meaningful exercise and not mental masturbation.
That's true but because it was 10x less people moving BTC around so it had drastically less activity. If I had to make a guess,  It probably won't normalize until all the possible BTC is on the market or closer to it
Because they are both attempting to be currencies. 
So not until after everyone here is dead?
I hope for all of our sakes, it will become less volatile much sooner than 2140. 
Yes, and? Who saves money in USD?
Lots of people mate. There are many fiscally conservative people that put money into a savings account. That's even more so the case in countries like Germany where investing culture isn't as big as in the US where people tend to buy real estate or stocks. I hope you understand the comparison now.
If the point of the comparison is "look, you can do better than this terrible option!" then you're setting a strawman on fire.
I think you might want to do some research into what bitcoin is about, here's [Satoshi's Whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) as a start
