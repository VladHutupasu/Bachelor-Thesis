Daily Discussion, April 15, 2018 -- TITLE
It's doing that thing again 
Yey sold all at a heavy loss while it was going sideways (exchange does not have a stop loss) .. due to a family member losing his job and I waned to help.
Now I'm watching it rise .. 
While it was falling I was not so stressed.. but now I feel that I will lose out by being out. 

 
**Support The Bulls**
These "I raise you" posts have become unfunny now
"Bitcoin is dead" I'm not going to sell.
Vegeta incoming?

Its not a pull back, its all the sell orders being filled when we touched 8400 relax
all that hard work to 8400, just to drop back down ;_;

This is like taking a run up to kick harder. Next time we approach $8400 it's going to be with momentum. 
Do we need to prepare the 9k memes for next week?
Well I'm pissed off. RBC Visa in Canada banned Coinbase it seems. They flagged the website as a "gambling" site and as such refuses to allow transactions with them.

It feels GREAT knowing that I can't use my money the way I want to, whenever I want to, with whoever I want to. Nice !
I have 0.25 BTC sitting in Coinbase. 

I‚Äôve heard that‚Äôs relatively unsafe? Should I move it somewhere?
**The Battle For $8300**
put btc in front of your store free advertisement from this sub reddit.you're welcome.
That was a serious dump but the market isn't having it.
on bitmex, somebody's 4.3 million usd position got liquidated. whales were stop hunting
I am no bitcoin expert so I come here to try and learn something from time to time. I have observed these discussion threads for a couple months now. Occasionally, someone posts something interesting and insightful. However, for the most part these threads consist of over emotional cum biscuits who are venting their reasonless predictions and suggestions. Please for the sake of everyone reading this thread, back up your claims with actual evidence so we can try and learn something useful. Good luck to everyone. 
Upward action.....
We are back on track!

https://fnordprefekt.de/
may the fomo be with you
next stop 8700-9200 range
Would increasing the block size interfere with segwit LN shoor sigs and other implementations? And would it require another hard fork?
upward tendency
Short term moving average is getting closer and closer to crossing the long term moving average on the 1 day chart.  When that happens, bitcoin might really take off. 
Damn damn damn 
Who fomo‚Äôd at $8,400?
lol, bitcoin did something I did not expect it would do
I am absolutely convinced just about everyone way understimates whats going to happen. But one small part of me, the old sensible part, worries that it might cause uncontrollable chaos. Because if you take this revolution to the end, it wins. And if it wins, governments will go broke I think. And if that happens its a shitfight. Or war. 
 push today to take it to around $8600-$8700

Not to be all aluminum foil hatty or anything, but has anybody else noticed a sudden increase in super positive comments from relatively new accounts?

If you buyin right now you got brass balls

Its alright. Still early stages of crypto. Theres plenty of time to get in
My spider senses are tingling. Breakout soon. ;-)
Shake down. free coins from weak hands
A week ago I told everyone to buy. This is gonna run until May at least before a big correction. It's literally in the last few year's graphs.
So much positivity. That makes me so happy to see here these days, after months of hate, trolls, just random drama. I‚Äôve been with bitcoin and crypto since 2013 and honestly believe in the tech. Sadly though I didn‚Äôt pull all my investments in January and I‚Äôve been at the mercy of this market since then. It makes me weary of this bull run. I want it to keep climbing with stable numbers but I feel a bear trap is coming. I‚Äôm not sure who or what group is doing these market moves. I‚Äôve heard more and more accounts of closed off investor groups manipulating prices and banking profits on our pain. We need to fucking fight these assholes. This is our future and our livelihood. I‚Äôve also been day drinking.
Much more fun this way.
and here we go
Interestingly this pump doesn't coincide with a short squeeze.

Number of shorts is even going up...
Interesting...good time to open a can of beer. Cheers people

Hey people. I missed out on the value jump on Thursday and would like some honest advice am I not making the right calls. Is now a bad time to jump in? Is it a bull trap that will rise and fall? 
Quick question, is it possible for a blockchain.info wallet that‚Äôs secured with 2FA using google authenticator to be hacked? Cos I just saw a withdrawal of all my btc from my blockchain wallet

0.0024BTC says the wall at $8,100 will *magically* disappear.
It's raising too fast , I need more time to invest :(
What‚Äôs up with the Wall Street Journal ads on Snapchat? They‚Äôre saying stuff like ‚ÄúBitcoin is dead‚Äù like WTF! What are they even talking about?  
Clean ascend so far. Let's test the 8500 and 9000 soon
Sell at your own peril. Next week is going to be a great week for bitcoin.
Time to HODL.
I think $9k tonight, have to take out $9.2k...

After this though I think $12k is pretty much a gonner. Only question that remains is how far how fast. 
What is everyones yearly salary, how much have you invested in btc, and how much is it currently worth?

Oh boy I wanna buy but I‚Äôm out of fiat for a couple weeks üò° (this is the Bitcoiner‚Äôs way of saying ‚ÄòI‚Äôm broke‚Äô while preserving any possible dignity)
Nothing like having the day's entire gains erased in 1 hour...gotta love it. 
200ema broken !
I'm hoping there will be another push today to take it to around $8600-$8700
Trump beating the World War III drums is the best thing to happen to BTC so far this year.
Weekend Gains are back wow. Can't wait til Monday, I have Stocks in DPW and BTC price affects it's price, it's gonna be üêª season opening hour lol get rekt son!
this $150 pump doesn't seem very convincing. 
I've won some money from a sports betting site but they only pay out in bitcoins. Where should I set up a wallet and how can I get my money out with the least transaction fees? They also offer payouts in other cryptocurrencies as well.
Here's an interesting article:

Seems that 8.5k is the stepping stone to 10k.
Congratulations on 800,000 subscribers r/Bitcoin!!! Next stop, the moon.
Jump above $8,500 happening very shortly.

We've seen 6k, now lets see 9k. 
I wonder if all the people who are willing to "tether up" expected a lower price to get in again. 

This would have two consequences:

- They will eventually have to buy in at these levels if it doesn't get lower.

- It won't get lower, because most people who are willing to "go tether" already did. So nobody is left (or at least not many). Only holders. 


Am getting a semi about to pop past 8400
Would say it's not hard to see a continuation of the down trend, atleast up until June, at which point BTC will start rallying, maybe even before the world summit review. 
ALL ABOARD 8300-8400 resist soon to be broken. next stop 8700-9200 range. I knew BTC would't drop to 3-4k so im so haapppyy i went in looong at 6700 <3

That‚Äôs why trump is in he won‚Äôt let it crash stupid 
Married with 2 kids combined income of 200k a year. About 530AM EST on Thursday morning  I invested into 1.4 BTC because it looked like it was going to jump and I figured afterwards I would exchange it all for Kin when it was at rock bottom I lost internet service for next 8 hours being in the mountains of Appalachia. When I got back into service I seen it jumped  way more than I ever could have ever imagined literally minutes after I invested. I'm still invested. I called a bull run 2 days before this as well seems as though that prediction was right as well.... I hope everyone here makes all the money they can because this is probably going to last until June...purely speculation though. Good luck all!

Bitcoin about to hit the 7000's again. It's barely holding on at 8000
Do you guys believe bitcoin could be at 100000$ by the end of this year?
Looks they are letting it go until Monday
dump time already???üòüüòüüòü
Yes! We're getting a serious pullback! Finally!
lets see if the pump continues to 8,700
I think we can expect for awesome news this week.
Can I haz pump?

LOWERRRRRRRRRRRR.
Right direction. Lower.

Pump.
BTC didn't cross the 15 min resistance, meaning the trend is not broken. I am guessing there is going to be a march up. If it did break resistance, I think BTC would have continued to drop until mid 7,500. I had my stop loss set at 8099 and the lowest sell was 8100. I can't believe how lucky I was...

Bitcoin at 7k
Me: exchanges are closing
Sister : why don't you sell a little to get back some money
Me: what?, To buy back again at 15k?, Not, in my mind that money is gone. 
Today: Bitcoin at 8k

No, after all those histories about guys who lose Bitcoin or sell because "Bitcoin is dead" I'm not going to sell.

Sitting in front of computer, eating a packet of chips and watching price going up, is not really hard work.
Rofl .... what hard work?

We are just sitting here getting fat on our snacks.
yeah we knocked a big chunk out the wall and filled a TON of sell orders. now we bust it
I use quadrigacx with them and so far no problem. They did stop me from sending funds once but icalled them and they unfroze it right away.

BMO has banned debit card purchases too. 

if you are in alberta. ATB has taken a pro bitcoin stance.
Google Mt.Gox and you'll understand why its never a good idea to keep money on an exchange.
[deleted]
Bots working. 
I don't think Bitcoin is something you can physically place anywhere sir.

Was it long? Must have been like 20x or something, hope he was only using such large margins to keep the majority of his coins off the exchange.
I decoded your message and agree that we should hit ATH within the next few days.
/r/btc down the hallway, poindexter 
20k by end of week?
I am with you generally but crypto and bitcoin are part logic, part nuts :)

The fun is in the language of the common people and understanding the sentiment of the people who are traders or normal investors. It is a great mix of people here and whenever you are feeling down due to bitcoin, come and spend some time here, you will be kept entertained :)
let them vent out mate. they are traders who lost something. venting would really help them calm. this is one way to let their disappointment be gone. but i hope they have this another thread where they can vent out and another thread for the happy customer.
Im with you on this one, but you can get one thing of value from this thread - sentiment. The traders that post emotions here reveal sentiment in weak hands which will play a roll in the temporary volatility of the market. I like to call these threads my "weak hand news". 
So McAfee going to have eat his dick or not ? 
Got long at 6700 (3.5 btc total) I have stop loss at new support no fomo here just trading and making money ;)
I hope so. 
No. Yes.
So should I go long? I feel youre best person for advice on this topic.
Armour-plated Lambo to the Moon!!!
It's already war mate. Trade wars have started, they will be followed by hot wars. Just how it works. 
War?  Nah.  If governments feel that cryptos challenge their control of money, they will just ban it.
ok will do it
[deleted]
There are many like you.
I want to buy big at $5k, but it seems to be surging upwards. Not mad, just sad I didn't invest sooner. I make more money in the summer so was hoping to invest big this summer before the price skyrockets:(
So you think there might be some shilling going on here? Like, those guys who caused the sudden spike yesterday are selling today, and looking for buyers?

Maybe. Some of the comments I read here today sound a bit odd.

Again, last years bull market lasted the whole year and there is no reason to believe the bear market is done in 3 month. Unless you don't believe there was a bear market to start with, of course, just a correction down from the peak.

Well I believe there was a bear market, there is a bear market, and this run maybe will go high over the next few weeks, maybe break 10k, I don't know. But I am convinced at the end it's <7k again. And from there... who knows.

Sorry. It's my opinion. I might be wrong, but be careful with your money. If you think it's time to invest, don't invest more than you think you can wait several years for to take profit. And don't invest what you can't afford to lose.
I'm fairly new to this sub but last week  I started noticing fairly new accounts posting a lot of unessisary "memes" and trying to stir up fear while not so new redditors are acting like they want to have discussions. 
conspiracy? - am gonna stock up on beanz an guns jus in case.
True, but at least we went from super negative to super positive comments.
You just been liquidated son!
RIP
It can go to 5k and will still rise again. You don't understand block chain 
9k memes at the ready.
Been telling my friends the same this past week! Glad I just about got my fiat deposit in time :D feeling like a boss lol
And I just realized my username. LOL
A bear trap traps bears, it's not a trap set by bears.
I think you mean bull trap, a bear trap means it would hit 8500, and then all of a sudden drop to 8000, and then moon to 9000, cucking the bears.
You jinxed it.
> Number of shorts is even going up...

O course. Bitcoin is short term high now. People are selling their way up (dollar cost averaging the other way around). And no, they are mostly not setting epic targets like $5k. Just short term short trading for the next dip...
The shorters are gonne get hurt badly
People use support and resistance to set orders. So in this case since the last high was $8 200 or so and it held it's just obvious to put buy orders above it or stops for shorts above it.

Markets work like this, they sprint from consolidation to consolidation. Also a week-end, so thin markets. Levels getting hit. Just how it works 
Similar programmed bots listen to the same indicators and react at the same time. Then all the limit orders come into play, creating a cascade...

Of course, whales who know the indicators can use this knowledge to their advantage... But they are often not as important as many people want to believe.
I really don't think the spikes are a bad/manipulating thing myself. It's just that big players are trading the markets at the moment with different viewpoints on where the prices of the crypto's are going to go. Every time an previous resistance is broken there's just an over demand because the one that believe the prices will go up are then buying aggressively because they think this really is a good opportunity to buy while it's still possible while at the same time the shorters are closing their positions because they can't handle the losses anymore or are changing their viewpoint on basis of the recent price development. Just my point of view. Expecting a change in sentiment to go slow and gradually is just not how these markets work.
Dollar average, buy some Bitcoin today's, and wait, if price falls buy more, if price rise, buy more. 


Buy and hold. It's not traps, it's not manipulation. Don't over trade. We have several months of gains ahead. That was not financial advise by the way, just an opinion. 
Fomo
Mate, nobody knows this.

You should at least be prepared for a crash, don't go all in just yet.

This guy (e.g.) paints a pretty dark scenario:

Not sure what the big deal is with tax day. Everyone should know what they owe at this point and have already taken that money out and have now reinvested what they have remaining.
The suspense is killing me.  I need one more dip before Bitcoin moons.
Ouch
Thanks will check it out 
Bitcoin waits for Nobody
Nobody puts Bitcoin in the corner!
This is typical. WSJ is owned by people with a vested interest in the establishment and fractional reserve banking system. Media outlets have proclaimed bitcoin to be dead at least 200 times over the years. Still it just keeps growing 
There was a study published. As the price goes down more HODL memes = good time to sell.
yeah, 9k is fast approaching
Nice try IRS.

I make around 50k a year, have invested 23k and it's currently worth about 14-15k lol. I am not worried though! I pump more into it when ever I can to get back to the green quicker! I've got my lambo already picked out!
Fuck it.. Ill play.
I make about 50k a year. Started buying bitcoin late Aug. 2017 have 13k in, currently worth about 13,600
$65k, 0.25 BTC. 

Bought a good chunk near ATH, so I‚Äôm down about 50% of my investment. 
I just started my own business and have almost 20k invested, 2BTC. I am down about $2500.
Man I must be Oliver twist my income is merely ¬£15k per year. I have about 0.03BTC altogether XD 
I run around a $12500 deficit. No job. Invested around $1500 currently worth $36,000
$30K, 20K, $105K
I bought 0.1 BTC at the 7k peak, lost $150 and sold.

Bought back in two days ago, and I am up $10.


Income 538k, currently holding 0.  Total gains 650k.
Wait for Monday morning.
nope. the 200ema on the daily is at $8708.
Honestly, a few missiles fired at patches of desert by the orange baby have nothing to do with this.

You don't need to set up a wallet if you are not holding long-term. Just open a coinbase account and ask them to send the bitcoin to your coinbase's bitcoin wallet address, then you can withdraw for fiat. 
If you're looking to hold long-term, look into getting a [Ledger wallet](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/).  It's a safe(r) way to store your coins offline.
I took a payout from Bodog on a winning bet in BTC. Worked OK for me.
Everybody here is hoping this stepping up to the price of bitcoin. I hope it can recover, many are waiting for the right time to sell their coins

How you know sorry just curious
Just a bunch of stupid fuckers with their stop losses set at 8200 who will now have to buy back higher.
No, up is where we go.
How does one short in a bull market and make money?
Thats how you get hemmorhoids.
If he's on android I recommend the samourai wallet, its still not finished but it's on the playstore and it's my favorite wallet so far. 
Exodus. I like it. 

People who tether up will just end up buying for around the same price they sold. It's no biggy. Even if it doesn't go lower, it's alot less stressful than holding when prices aren't moving and/or dipping a little. 
You sound like a fucking advertisement.
1.4!!  Nice man, that's going to do quite well for you.
Wow that's huge for a couple of hours of investment you already gain and of course, you have that kind of leverage to trade
pffft...Bitcoin will never see $5k again, not even in it's yearly crash. 
lol were at -0.77% for the day. and you say 5k your retarded go home
Would be amazing but I would be very happy with $20k or higher. 
Just my opinion, we should be happy if we reach a new ATH this year.
Why don't you have a look at last year?
no
End of next year I think. This year I would say might get close to 50k
Last Monday the market dropped when New York woke up. We also saw a drop on Friday as America finished its week. Read into that what you will.

Why is it the right direction? Just asking, I am uncertain how things will go, so I am about 60% of "bitcoin money" in cash.
*losing. You people sound so fucking stupid when you try to make a point but don't even know English that well. LOSING people...not loosing. 
Lol k.  I like how slight growth with relatively stable and consistent value the last few days somehow translates into crypto failing.  Is stability in value not essential to a currency?
Yo dude ... this is heresy to the BTC zealots gathered here :P
Good luck with your yearly 3% ROI lol
A smart investor places their capital in both, with a spread that depends on the level of risk you want to take on. But you're not smart, are you Doc? 
Lol - yeah you buy them stocks man. Get some more dollars too. 
What do you mean lucky? That's a terrible sell
Not anymore. Say goodbye to your coins.
shite if this guy said it, it must be true... 
expect ATH?
What? I hope you are right but still holding it. I hope it will be a big run.
Is the source this time also your back side? 
> Fomo

Well that is what i wrote. 
Even tho the money I lost  I will earn back and it is not such a big of a problem, but somehow I feel guilty that that money could have helped someone. It is stupid because it is my money. Is there a term for money spending guilt? :D   
And I think with age it is starting to become a problem.  Being disabled (hence the age because it progresses with age) - I hate that i'm dependant on others so I think subconsciously I try to "repay my debt". Everything I do is not good enough for me. I have been tracking Bitcoin since practically its start but managed to overcome my "inner voice" only by the end of the last year (yeah I know ..) when my friend gave me courage. I waned some independence but now if it takes off again or it drops I lose. Probably the healthy thing would be to ignore the charts and go on with my life but it is starting to become more difficult (because it is interesting not even from investment standpoint but everything else). Stupid but perhaps I waned to vent where no one knows me.
Like what they say in a game of poker - someone throws in a fifty, an the next guy says, I'll see the fifty an raise you 100 / a gold watch / whatever.  Basically outbidding each other in terms of bitcoin popularity around the world.

Ha.ha.ha. maybe he is referring the hard work being done by whales to pump the price of bitcoin but cannot sustain it to break the wall. I think we need that dragon from the GOT to burn that wall
Thanks for the info. I  tried QuadrigaCX before - They didn't freeze my funds but I had to wait 2-3 days for the funds to clear... Still annoying, but better than nothing :)

Ha ha.

Government might make things marginally difficult, but how exactly would governments go about banning BTC?

Malta for example is actively attracting exchanges.  You could simply move all your trading to Malta or other sympathetic states.

As for the blockchain - how would a government shut that down? 

Now don't be silly.
My understanding is the 17th is the last day to do taxes in the United States and some people think once everyone's done doing their taxes they will get their money right away and use it all to buy bitcoin and cause the price to skyrocket. 
Hence the aluminum foil addition ;) It's just an observation and I'm really curious if I'm seeing pink elephants fly or maybe others noticed it too :) 
Yeah, but I don't trust the sudden spike in combination with this observation. Maybe I'm just paranoid... 
And you don't understand humor
*blockchain
False alarm...
Self realization of one's username checks ouy
It‚Äôs a trap set by bears to catch unsuspecting investors. 
Or maybe it does what it did and hit $8400 and tank to $7900 without reason after perfect systematic growth from $6700-8400.... try again Redditor for 3 months  
Yeah I figured some bitch would say that. I want it to climb to 20k but common we all know the whales are in charge and won‚Äôt let us be happy until they either make ridiculous profit or destroy the market cap.

Thanks for the frank replies.

Not true. People do know. I already know all my trades for the year.

Some people says that tax season = dip. 

is interesting to verify the effect the end of tax season. 
There‚Äôs been claims that the exchanges keep their money in btc and have been gradually selling btc to cover taxes.  They might know what they owe but have still been selling.  
Sell wall, what a Surprise. 
Bitcoin never sleeps.
Relevant user names. 
You didn't HODL. If you are going to invest, then invest lol. If you think you can day trade bitcoin it's just too hard to predict right now. 
I'm roughly in the same ballpark. But in Euro. My losses are not as bad, but not much better either.
omg I hope this is a joke
But what about the 2021 model of Lambos the year our prophet McAffe proclaims our victory 
It's monday morning now. What should I be looking for?

Great. Thanks.
> many are waiting for the right time to sell their coins

In 2025 I'll see what my stack is worth and decide what I want to do.  Until then I hodl.
Let the boy dream 
Half way there now https://i.imgur.com/aFBxCy6.png 
There have been at least 3-4 instances when the price jumped a few hundred dollars around 1pm EST on Sundays. This was when the price had a positive movement in the prior days. I guess it didn't happen today or has not happened yet...
you mean 8400
Yeap.  Just like the other bunch of stupid fuckers who had to cover their positions at 8,130.
Way to expensive. If you arent a total noob, check out electrum. 
I was more talking about the effect on the market...

When so many people are still in tether, they can't crash the market as they used to do on the way down.

And they will be a strong market force on the way up.
Stop acting like a child, you're responding with emotion. The recent bull run that we had went up 1k in 30 minutes. It was not a natural bull run.
Lol .... so there are people who are grounded in reality here :).

Or I can say whatever I want and I won't be silenced for having a dissenting opinion.
Greetings
I am 100% sold all on the 13th, don't know what to do now

3% is better than -30%

In 3.. 2.. 1..
Earned every satoshi of it
I e transferred 2k to QCX from RBC and it took less than a day.  
If you only have BTC you don't have to worry about that other stuff. The ledger guide is here - https://www.ledgerwallet.com/start/ledger-nano-s 

Not too much involved. The most important thing is to properly secure and back up your 24 word recovery phrase (don't store it on a computer!) 
Haha, if there's on thing I've learned, it's that if there are a ton of open positions for a large total sum at the same as your position. Close that shit now! Those wale-cunts love nothing more than to liquidate people.
Not really. We have the very real prospect of a US market crash 1929 style and a dollar hyper inflation. 

It might even be a conservative target if people give up on the current system en mass. 
Well ordinarily I would go long in light of a bull run. But I trust everything you say so I guess I'll hodling too. :)
They don't have to shut down the network nor do they need to take it away from you.  But they can make it illegal and some of the governments have done so: 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_bitcoin_by_country_or_territory

I doubt if this will be wide spread but if cryptos starts to threaten government's control, it's not difficult for them to make it illegal.
> some people think once everyone's done doing their taxes they will get their money right away and use it all to buy bitcoin and cause the price to skyrocket.

Is that before or after all those wall street bonuses finally hit the market?
[deleted]
No.  I don't think so.
Yep. Because I told people About...A..We3k..Ago üòÇ
Will you settle the fuck down?
In his scenario the crash happens at $8800. So, no.
No. 

Most of the TAs failed in the past weeks. It's interesting to look at different perspectives, but nobody can predict the market.
What do you mean by that?
I find it impossible to believe to be honest, someone would of had to have hacked your email account plus cloned your phone.  If they were capable of that then they would have cleaned out thousands of accounts.  
Yeah we will see I guess, just not sure what people think is going to happen. 
Gotta go big if you want a lambo
Big green dick, but a small one.
That's ironic since Coinbase itself is a gambling business.
You could also use Gdax to post a limit sell and that way you won't have to deal with fees. Gdax and coinbase are owned by the same company so after you make your coinbase account you've already got a gdax account. 
You were saying?
Thanks still learning here
No, but it is the natural start of one after a 70% crash. It's exactly what you'd expect to see as people aggressively start to turn their positions around. First they have to buy to cover the shorts and then they have to buy the new position. Of course it's going to cause spikes like this. 
aww did someone miss the dip now they mad
Chill son
Bahhhh bahhhh black sheep. 
Looked at your previous posts. Not only are you completely wrong with every post about Bitcoin, you are a troll. Blocked
[hi](https://i.imgur.com/MFDJk.gif)
Buy! 
Tough call, I empathise. Don't take advice from anyone, do what you want. But for sure I am buying on a fall, dunno about a rise.
Btc to $250 this year by December get out now!! Stocks and bonds seem safer 
Projecting my frustrations...lol. Alright bud you got me. 
April 16, 2018 Bitcoin Price = USD$8100.

April 16, 2017 Bitcoin Price = USD$1176.

588% YoY since last year.

I hodl.
Everything has a crash cycle.
Noone cares what you think.
We aren't here for safe
Sureeee, enjoy the couple of percent you're going to make this year till it crashes and you lose everything.

**Legality of bitcoin by country or territory**

The legal status of bitcoin varies substantially from country to country and is still undefined or changing in many of them. Whereas the majority of countries do not make the usage of bitcoin itself illegal, its status as money (or a commodity) varies, with differing regulatory implications. While some countries have explicitly allowed its use and trade, others have banned or restricted it. Likewise, various government agencies, departments, and courts have classified bitcoins differently.

They are *trying*. That much is clear...
Means I already know what trades I'm going to do for the year. I'm not trying to guess what to do. I know already. So when someone says no one knows, wrong. Some people do. 
You should not learn by studying these patterns, past performances is not indicative of future results. 
Nooope. Stopped by a while ago.
Uh, okay?
It seems that your comment contains 1 or more links that are hard to tap for mobile users.

Bye? 
Serious question what makes you say that?

I am gonna wait for another 48 hours before I make a decision have around 20 -30k GBP on the sidelines

If you look at my previous posts you will get an idea of where I am at, have not lost any money yet but have not gone 'big' yet

Have generally bought 2 btc and sold here and there to make smallish profits

Longterm plan is to hodl but I like the buying/selling its addictive
We may not see a fall in the short term now that the trend is upwards, this will attract new investment methinks

I am thinking now is still a good time to get in, will wait to see what happens in the next few days
I‚Äôm all for bitcoin, but it‚Äôs clear you have no understanding of the stock market lol
Well, the probability of that happening is zero and you should know that since you claimed to have traded stocks.
Yea fair enough thought it was a good reply, just thought old mate here may be a little bamboozled. 
It's like "whale academy".
I understand that I'm just trying to get a grip on how people predict a movement based on what? 
True. Take my own and everybody else's comments with a grain of salt. My comment was based on prior movement I noticed in the past.  I don't day trade, I'm in it for the long haul. Been adding to my Bitcoin position every week with an exit plan sometime after mid 2020s.
Piss off fat fingers bot!  They can pinch and zoom if they care.  
Also dangerous. I'm a hodler. I'm in profit at the minete been hodling since September. I'm in no rush to sell. I just think the bear news has died down, the chart pattern is similar to previous years. And the price has held strong above 6600 for a while now. Just my opinions of course. 
First time I traded stocks was in 1998. What's clear is you have no understanding of Bitcoin or you wouldn't waste your time with stocks. I do more in a month than you can do in a decade mate. Just saying. 
Stocks will lose 50% to 80% of it's value in the next two years. If you actually did know what you were doing you'd have realised by now they're going to crash the markets on Trump's watch so they can blame him. All the Fed has to do is raise interest rates and cut QE. 

What did they do a month after Trump got elected ? 

You don't even know stocks man. Are you stupid or something ? Stocks crash every 10 years or so. Roughly round about now. 
Hope you are exiting into stuff or other forms of capital. And not another currency
Cheers buddy

I don‚Äôt see how you‚Äôre in a position to say that when you‚Äôre sitting at over 50% down from highs lmao
Lol ... it's what I do for a living.  

And based on what you are writing, I can tell that you are clueless on stocks other than cut & paste from the web.  In fact, I can even quote where you have read them :).

[deleted]
Because I bought easter you twat (you know when those stock markets were closed). I'm up 30% last 3 days alone. And I'll likely do another 30% today. 

edit: Just worked it out, actually 37% last 3 days. 
If you can't tell stocks are about to crash then there's something wrong with you. Seriously. Then this game is not for you. 
You're crap at it. And no I don't read about stocks. I don't do stocks. Stopped that years ago. 
I'm not going to explain it anymore. It should be obvious to anyone who trades where we are. 
You‚Äôve got a bit of a potty mouth, don‚Äôt ya.

And I dunno, that 30% looking real sketchy right now LOL

I‚Äôm glad you at least know the markets were closed on Easter, I‚Äôm proud of you!
Then you don't have a clue but come here and spout nonsense like "stocks will lose 50% to 80% of it's value in the next two years"?

You are a joke, all by yourself :)

Look dude, don't judge.  I'm pretty confident the spare change I make toying with BTC is worth more than your entire portfolio.
[deleted]
Doubt it. 
Of course be easy to tell. Let's just wait and see exactly when stocks crash. I think 2 years max. 
But that's my whole point. The Fed's are going to crash the market on purpose. Trump is the fall guy. Everyone knows a crash is unavoidable at this point. It's just a question of who gets blamed. Trump is perfect. 
When you are in wealth management, you meet all kinds.  And you quickly learn to discern which are the clients that are worth your time.

So yes, I'm pretty confident.  I will spare you the embarrassment of my readings.
Well, your time is better spent looking after your BTCs since that's all you have.  Especially since it has already crashed 60% :)
[deleted]
I was a registered FM/FA myself man. Stopped practicing a decade ago. And I must tell you if I had to pay you for your Bitcoin calls I'd want my money back. 
How long have you been trading stocks ?


You will be lucky if it's a civil war. History says otherwise. It's going to be WW III.
