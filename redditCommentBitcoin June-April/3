"Brussels vows to retaliate against US tariffs in coming hours"

This is good for bitcoin!
A nice spike at binance up to 7699 ;\-\) Someone bought over 550 BTC
There we go; another day... same discussion... have fun!
Alright bitcoin gods, we’ve suffered enough. Time for a couple FOMO-inducing short squeezes as a sign for the faithful to Hodl on. 
HODL strong guys, historically the second half of the year tends to be much more exciting for the markets :D
We all have to express the price of a bitcoin in the price of a satoshi, than we will moon. Because people accept a rise from 0,0075 to 0,0150 easier than from 7.500 to 15.000. It's a psyologically thing. So let's talk satoshi! It will prevent that we have to watch mcafee eating his dick ;-)

By the way is there a satoshi logo?
**GO BULLS!**
Im going to set up my own lightning full node and i have a question regarding the hardware required. I know i will need an external hdd or ssd of 500gig or more. does the manufacturer/quality of the drive itself play a role in preformance? should i not try and find a more economical option when shopping necessarily ? thanks for any input 
Someone's been buying 0.006 btc-€ every second or two on kraken for days, now s/he's selling the same way.
Really 
F MAY GO AWAY
so I guess 7k was the bottom?
Expecting a huge green dildo to take us at 8k instantly.
in theory, would it be possible to send btc to the wallet i'm sending from? could i send btc to myself?

MACD crossing on the daily imminent.
Does anyone know the prince of 1 bitcoin in 2025? 
here we go again
Hoping we can see 8k today if we close above the downtrend line.............
Bought the tip

Sold the dip

Hey, so if BTC hits 20k and stays steady it means its a race to mine BTC all the way up to 15\+k electricity costs per BTC mined?  
What if BTC hits 50k, its a race to spend 40\+k electricity per BTC?

Is there a way around this? Am i misunderstanding something? Is it feasible to spend 10 times electricity the mining is taking now? 20 times?
Well we’re quite a ways off from a cool 1mil and global energy production is a product of demand. There’s lots of new and clean mega energy projects such as fusion around the corner, I think those that have invested want to see a return on older projects like nuclear , etc. U should look into the 3rd industrial revolution and others who believe many technologies like block chain, AI, quantum computers will disrupt everything we currently understand about energy, money, industry, etc.
The volume is not high enough for a breakout  IMO. Still waiting for that spike before I buy. It's more likely we move to the upper stratosphere far short of the moon "unless you're a flat earther, in which case you are already close to the moon and deserve the following. Then we plunge down to the Earth's core where some of you will obviously get burned. Looks more likely to me we go down to at or below 6.8k. Better to wait until we are on the upswing than to jump in not knowing which way this is headed. 
June is going to be huge!

We are bouncing nicely and easy headed to 14k! Lambos for eveyone..  ignore the rest of this message as it only applies to those who actaully want to make as much profit as possible. These whales look at the same charts as us. They know that most everyone here has a concensus that we have hit the "bottom" and its buy time for everyone. If I was a stealthy whale waiting  patiently for an ideal time to dump... hmm, I wonder when that might be?
Ready yourselves for the bloody turd droppening.  Might be a small turd this time.
No, it decreases adoption which is key right now. 
Is it possible to fork by accident?

Let's say each node connects to four other nodes. It's pretty easy to imagine an island of five nodes all connected to one another, and no one else.

In reality each node connects to 200 others\(I think\). But is it possible to have a accidental division in the network as I've described? Has anyone calculated the odds?
Under what conditions would you support a blocksize increase?
You know what?  On 1d chart, 100ma is moving under 50 ma.  This is positive sign.

With 845,000 readers on this sub, it's really quite simple, EVERYONE dig deep into your pocket or credit card and BUY 1 BTC..... Price should jump to well over $11,000 USPeso
So bitcoin is crashing again. Good time to buy at 6500
Haha i sold all minee before the dump, you dumb fucks
Just wanted to inform that a fantastic new crypto coin market analysis tool has launched called CoinAI.

https://www.banca.world/coinai/index.html

It provides forecast models and portfolio optimization based on artificial intelligence and big data mining. It is in alpha right now but is looking very, very useful with completely interesting metrics.

Free to use for now but it will eventually require the purchase of the token BANCA for use.
the BTC monthly MACD looks like its about to cross over and go into a 3 year bear market.

Bring it, Brussels!  Just don't bring any of your goddamn aluminum with you!
I'm more interested in Italy. Euro collapse is #1 in my possible reasons for bitcoin to reach 1M usd. 
wow I hope this will be a positive movement for Bitcoin community. traders became lazy because of the stagnant movement in pricing.
I think this will bring hopes for the hudlers

Yes and then? its a whale that will soon dumped again
yea, that was funny
I'll start: "Bitcoin to da MOOON!"
:) when moon when moon
Whats the number of shorts these days ? Havent looked at it for a while. Should we expect a short squeeze like we have had when btc went from 6.8K to 8K ?
I used an old hard drive that was laying around and it works pretty great since about one and a half years... Just go for it, you can always upgrade later.
Probably an arbitrage trading bot.
Sadly yes.  
Yep, 8k+ by Monday.
Someone is just trying to make money on you guys 
Without any reason?
You've been sitting on the toilet for too long
yes.
ha.ha.Why you want to do that
1h?
1 bitcoin.
According to latest tendencies, it could possibly be either female or male : )
Prince Asics Miner
Well.... you see.... for McAfee's sake..... the price better be well north of $10 Billion US Peso's.
Much higher than today or near zero
If bitcoin is worth more, the reward is greater. It's feasible since the higher price pays for the extra electricity it costs.
Thank you redditor for a day. Always a red flag to me when someone creates an account and their first posts are aimed to spread fear. Just a "coincidence" it so happens to be on a pos day. No bias intentions here. /s
You're going to wait until after the 1000 point Spike to buy?  Dumbest thing I've ever heard.  Should have been buying on the way down.
Do not worry, they only want to hear positive sounds here. Before you know it, you are, according to others, on medication. Only they know it all.
When your moon is crying they will embrace you
Correlate price deltas with the first and 2nd derivatives of this graph:

https://blockchain.info/charts/my-wallet-n-users?timespan=1year

And you'll see some interesting data. 
Did you just make a prediction based on a tweet that got 2 likes, from an unverified account with a space bull as the profile picture? Seems legit.

\[Edit\]... It's your own god damn tweet too. 
What bounce are you talking about?

We have flatlined for a week.  It's lying there like a fucking dead fish.
Whales ? you mean the trading platforms? 
Don't you think it will first go back to +/- 6.600? It would make a perfect triple bottom.
I hope this is true but right now I think it is more accurate it will can reach the 8k market but until there is no big news or adaptations in the usage of bitcoin it will climb slow 
No were not bouncing nicely. It was a bart simpson bounce pretty much followed by a questionable rally
Yes but it would be resolved once the network becomes whole again, the shortest chain would get orphaned.
If everyone else moved on and I was by myself :(

Or when we all have to upgrade to the hardfork that changes to a quantum resistant algorithm and we might as well increase the blocksize.

Until then I will be too lazy to upgrade.
Not going under, could be or maybe but 100 and 50 is closing the gap.
Your chart is in linear, not log scale, and doesn't show the last 1-2 day's rise. In the log chart we've already bounced off the bottom of the triangle. 
Bro, I struggle to buy .01 BTC at a time!
Ha.ha. good point. if every one here just buy 1 bitcoin it will a huge movement . Looking at bitcoin I think this is still a good coins and will eventually  rise again
i can afford a bitcoin at $11000 but i wouldn't put that much money into crypto...lol...
If normal currency is so bad, why do you buy bitcoin with it, instead of buying it with bitcoin?
What chart are you looking at lmao
Why would it be crashing again? I don't think it will go lower than about 7.400 anytime soon.
Mwah, I'd say wait a few more weeks to buy at 2500
Child, go run with scissors.
Great move dumbass
Redditer for 2 weeks, and literally every one of your posts is this copy past comment. at least be original in your shilling if you insist on trying to get people to sign up to you system
must buy the coin to use it??? how many times can I lol? bring another shitcoin to market! good luck
You can't just put Coin and AI together and expect to become a billionaire. Doesn't work like that.
[deleted]
LOL
It's going to zero, what are you talking about? We all just hang out in here because we don't believe in anything related to bitcoin and think it's going to crash
nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo hold me tighttttttttttttt
Sent a couple BTC. Enjoy.
yes it will happen, the whales take charge

I meant to put in 0.550 sorry about that!
First small dump, then moon.
Good point. Thanks for sharing. 
Sure, of course.  And 10k by next week.  /s
I think it can reach that 8 k the possibility is good
Potential EMA crossover on the 6h chart would be the reason.  Brings an upward swing of 1000-2000 points.
That’s just my TA.
damn, how do you know that?!
thank you!
i don't wanna do that, i was just curious.
1D.
I mean feasible more in an ecological sense i guess. If we're now at the level of Ireland in electricity consumption, how much is too much? How could BTC ever get to a cool 1million$ since that meant the electricity costs to mine would race towards that price, and thatd probably be big chunk of the whole electricity in the world?
Prices cannot scare me. Bitcoin could fall to 5k and that wouldn't shake me. I have bought bitcoin at a level it's never going back, and been hodling since :D
So what is it yout fear exactly? Caution, a drop to below 7k or that the Earth isnt flat? it is only my opinion, I thought that was the point of this forum. My apologies snowflake, didn't mean to scare you.
Thank you redditor for 2 weeks.
You are exactly right. I admit I could be wrong. However if it did drop down to 6.5k would you not have preferred to buy at the lowest point? Buying in on a strong upswing you are going to make a profit. My point is don't jump the gun. I don't claim to be a professional at crypto investing. However I did stay at a holiday Inn express!
That is very apparent. I would prefer someone's honest opinion that I could research myself as opposed to someone just blowing smoke up my butt. Ohh well to each their own. To the mars!
No bitcoin graph is complete without the dick-line ;)

An increase in wallets and interest in blockchain technology is always a good thing however just like the number of credit cards doesn't dictate what your credit score is, the number of wallets created doesn't dictate the value of btc. im just looking at historical data and there is always a very noticeable spike in volume during a significant upswing. Just because we saw a bounce at the triple bottom line does not mean we can't dip down further. The last spike in value was as big as this current one before a plunge. 
lol
good point if there is a change in this week it was very minimal
I mean institutional investors
Probably not. Everyone is expecting that. That's why I say probably not. It's kind of like the 6th of the month Theory that has been gaining traction. That trend is going to end very very soon if everyone thinks it's going to happen
Within 10 minutes after a expedited difficulty adjustment. 
Not mortgaging enough of your wives.
ha.ha. I feel you bro. I have been in that feeling last year.
Monthly
Very likely it could drop below 7400 but I do believe 7000 is the bottom.
You [guys](https://gyazo.com/02981849247a6d8505d0bf6e4e479e5a) are a good fud-team, or maybe the same guy with multiple accounts?
Lol!

You must be losing a lot of money to respond to every negative post ... even an obvious troll post :)
Actually 7 months.  Where do you get this BS from?  My post history is also a lot longer than that.  Maybe you should learn to read.
Maybe you should actually check out the tool.  All I was trying to do was tell people about a seriously useful trading tool and took all kinds of crap for it.  Crypto is full of friggin idiots.
Damn how did you know i was depressed. I’m on the brink of suicide. I feel like Travis from taxi driver. I’ve never been to a psychiatrist before and I’m scared to go to one because what if there’s nothing wrong with me and they just tell me to go home. I’ve been an outcast all my life, I just don’t understand what’s wrong with me. Maybe my IQ is too low to understand my problems. I should just end it all. I just want someone to care.
I think right now bitcoin is very stable in 7.5 ka and it is climbing although at the very low manners
Don’t send any to non-segwit addresses!
just too bad the coder forgot the moon part in the loop command.. 
It takes an army to do that.  The army is gone.  I know exactly what you are saying.  But there are examples in other markets where what you describe has happened.   In those other examples though, the traders \(volume\) hadn't already vacated the building.  


FTFY:  "Potential EMA crossover on the 6h chart, while maintaining Q1 volume,  would be the reason"  

prediction*
You could pretend to send it to yourself for a similar experience.
Ha.ha. you have a good sense of humor bro. take care..
So, what does it mean? Up or down?
I think I made myself pretty clear. The fact that you immediately retort with insults solidifies my point. Thank you.
:)
Yw.
So, my strategy for this downswing was to sell my stack at 9000 and for every 250 point drop, buy back a percentage of the stack, then when a market reversal is signalled put the remainder of the stack in, so no matter how far down it goes I have more left to reinvest, which means a portion of what I've got will have been put in at the bottom.
If you want an indicator of a price spike, the second derivative of wallet growth is what I'd pay attention to. The blockchain is great, because you can get this information in real time, every 10 minutes, like magic..
So this is your pump and dump account?
I know they say to zoom out but fuck
I had expected it to test the 7.560 mark again and maybe touch 7.590 and then drop to a point on the extrapolated ascending line/staircase that was formed before the last 'pump'. But anyway, we'll see. Right now it seems likely it won't even retest 7.560 again before it dumps.
I don't respond to all your posts...
You're also a troll.
Just passing through, but you have  a tag beside your name "Redditor for 2 weeks"
Yeah man, just go into Daily Discussion and spam your tool which is not even relevant to discussion. We're the idiots here.
Laying the sarcasm on thick haha. I'm glad I'm wrong.
Yeah, that's sarcasm. You don't need IQ to "understand" your problems.
You're right it will have cost you a lot as to compare to the segwit wallets
Crossovers on the 1h chart are still producing the usual 200-300point spikes, there's no reason to believe a crossover on the 6h won't produce the usual 1000-2000pt spike.
Random guess*
and save the fee

lol, thanks! cheers, mate!
Last time we had an upward cross was the beginning of Apr. That was the run up to upper 9k.
In other words it a bullish signal.
Since you were nice enough to say thank you. I just wanted to say you're whalecum ;)
And I think that is very smart. I know btc will be up to 9k and way beyond so you have nothing to worry about. 
Roger that! I will and thank you
heh, but fuck. 
Hello Permabull
ha.ha. I love the memes everytime we have a crash or we have a moon. Every body here have a reasons of their existence in this forum some are learning what is the market status through this arena
No I’m completely serious. Now my cries of pain are taken as sarcasm...

Tears mistaken for tears of joy.
there's no difference sending to a segwit vs non-segwit address, the reduced size only occurs when sending from a segwit address. 

At any rate, nobody tip OP pls, they will become a seagull which tries to steal your lunch every single day. 
You could also pretend to pay the fee, by pretending to lose a few cents down the back of an imaginary sofa.
This little thread sliver is showing some wisdom.  Kind of rare on btc sub.
Right, and anything I buy back is more Bitcoin than I sold, and the goal is to increase Bitcoin holdings on every market downturn.
I think it will hit the 10k marked in the market
Would 1 bitcoin solve your problems?
haha.lol. I hope this wisdom will bring  push to this market.

probably not. i live pretty comfortably.
