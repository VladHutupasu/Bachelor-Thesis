**Up 33%: Bitcoin's Price Just Had Its Best Month of 2018**

https://www.coindesk.com/33-bitcoins-price-just-best-month-2018/

Bitcoin's price rose 33 percent against the U.S. dollar in April, making it the best month of 2018 for the world's largest cryptocurrency.

Data from CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) shows that May began with bitcoin's price at the $9,244.32 mark - a 33 percent jump from its April 1 start of $6,926.02. This marks the greatest rise in bitcoin's price this year, and one of only two months where it rose at all within the period.

**Let us all make May an even better month!**
Come on guys ! Let's rerererererererereretest 9k
Looks like operation HODL the McAfee Dick Line has been a success üëç
~~It's over 9000...~~

It's over 9000...
Fucking tuesdays eh 
Bit of resistance to 9k today. Cheeky.
Back to ramming 9k wall again
I need 0.25 more BTC before it takes off again, but I've run out of stuff to sell! Payday just doesn't come fast enough.
Who‚Äôs ready for a good ‚Äòole Tuesday afternoon rally!?
Let‚Äôs kick it into warp and get over 10k by the weekend 
Interested in holding some long term bitcoin, it''ll be tricky finding a good price between now and July. 
the resistance is strong, but it's futile.
OVER 9000!!!!!!!
I mentioned yesterday the price was still gonna retreat. There's forces on both sides controlling the price. It's not a one way street. We are still following the bear line trend. But we are coming up at a junction where the long term up trend is crossing the bear line. That's when we can see things really turn around. Expect to see prices above 10K next week. 
**Keep fighting Bulls!**
Kanye big ups Bitcoin several times in his big interview with Charlemagne. Say what you want, its a good bump. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxwfDlhJIpw&t=1373s&app=desktop
Over 9k again! 
I do know one thing though, bulls they come they go. Saturday through Sunday Monday, Monday through Sunday yo. Maybe I love you one day, maybe we'll someday grow, till then bitcoin just get yo drunk on the fucking 10k road. 
My friend introduced me to this thing called Robinhood. Should I buy BTC from there or do it somewhere else? Thanks in advanced 
When you see big money buys like we are now, someone knows somthing, and its about to sore
BTC needs an initiative.  A purpose type cause.  Going green lol. Like that 
200 coin buy 
r/btc trolls are out in force tonight.

let me see his through 
Dont know if its manipulation... and the bulls want down now or what
well, we did finally break out.. 
Yo guys been a long time spectator now (3 years) but have a quick question.

So i have about 9 friends who all want to invest in bitcoin, some want to buy ¬£100 and others want a whole Bitcoin.

Now I'm going to have to set up a wallet e.g. electrum for them and and an exchange where they can sell for Cash e.g. Lunos (even though it is a wallet) 
Now obviously i would like the lowest fees possible (i have used "coinmama" in the past), they will be buying via debit card, so it would be bloody lovely if i could do the process within an hour or so rather than spending the whole day over at my mates houses.

So can you recommend me places to buy and wallets to store them in and a place where they can sell.
Many thanks Y'all
With the closure of 2018Q1 at 9000ish, what are your pessimistic and optimistic predictions for the end of 2018Q2?
#$9000!#

Never thought I'd see the day!

Bah, paypal, yeah? bah!
Anyone knows how many bitcoins are lost? 
Ie: lost wallets over the years ?
tough week ahead guys. well, last wednesday we were at $8600 so still everything fine i guess
What the fuck was that sell off all about? Used to be bad news driving drops like last night. 
Red across the board, still not managed to beat down 10k and been on 9ish for 2 weeks now.. 
Damn quite funny we were at $9700 already, now HEAVY fight against $9k again.

1d chart on gdax looks oversold to me
Why is a Bitcoin priced in dollars, instead of dollars being priced in Bitcoin?

If we want true adoption, this is something that should be taken care of.
Call it whatever but it is simple logic. 

Swing low to swing high, it is the time for pull back, it can hit any of the potential algos....

Abandon ship lads
Woohoo!!!
This is all a bit shit isn't it?  Never mind, at least lying Shitcoin Cash is doing 3x worse over 7 days.  So some people have woken up (Or Roge and Jihan have run out of money to pump it with.)

There has to be a crypto breakout eventually - could happen anytime.
