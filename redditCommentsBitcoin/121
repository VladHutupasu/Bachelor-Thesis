Daily Discussion, January 26, 2018
remember when we all have FOMO at 19k lol those were the days
Time for a ridiculous bull run
These discussions are basically the blind leading the blind. Don't look for advice here, it's all speculation.
Dont look at the price, look at tomorrow 
R we all gonna die?
We heading over 11k üöÄ

Edit we over 11k üöÄüöÄ
I've already met my cap on referral rewards, but if anybody wants a Robinhood referral link to get the free stock and fight Coinbase, message me. I am so excited for Coinbase to have legitimate competition. Fuck those guys 
today proof positive the cme is just a boogy man we just need to get over.
You're welcome. I just bought some more Bitcoin which means it will drop in value by a few thousand within a few days. Just remember to thank me when you snatch up cheaper Bitcoin!@
HODL
whats the cause of the dip?
is it coincheck? https://cointelegraph.com/news/japan-coincheck-exchange-freezes-all-withdrawals-as-up-to-723-mln-leaves-its-wallet

i keep hodling anyway!
Futures close at 11am? We're moving up fast. 
Just had a transaction for 9 sats/byte that has been unconfirmed since December 16th clear. 
What does "Buy the dip" really mean? I'm not talking about the definition, but rather the application. 

If you're a disciplined investor, you should be going in risking x% of your assets and no more, and you should have a buy-in strategy, a specific financial goal, and an exit strategy. Where does "buy more whenever it dips" fit into that?
It‚Äôs all a Fugazi
I don't really know anything about markets, trading and all that stuff.

Could someone ELI5 for me how "wallstreet" would be deliberately driving the price down to win on futures (I keep seeing people allude to this)? I mean, I get that whoever is short (some wallstreet guys) stands to benefit from the price going down. But for each person in a futures contract that is short, their has to be someone on the other side of the contract (some wallstreet guys) that are long, right? It's zero sum. One wallstreet guy wins, and the other loses?  So how would the short wallstreet guys be manipulating the price down? Wouldn't the long wallstreet guys in the other side of the contract be doing whatever the opposite is to manipulate the price up? No?
Futures just expired and we see an immediate surge in buying. Should be a decent run.

So futures expiring was a non event just like futures starting, death spiral theory, difficulty adjustments, segwit 2x, tether and pretty much everything else? Is non story the only universal truth. Satoshi have you foresaken us to witness a chain of nothing‚Äôs whilst getting rich off your chain of blocks. Is this our future? Do we look to the stars and seek reflections of reality? Is time dilation going to screw our blockchain when we chase the stars? I don‚Äôt know but I am long as fuck right now.
Probably the last chance to buy such a good dip before we shoot off to the moon on Monday. 
I started investing in this space in May 2017 and i have to admit this is the first time I'm actually getting bored.  Its funny how the WSJ had an article about the fact that your friends and family don't want to hear about your Bitcoin fascination anymore and now people like me don't want to talk about it anymore anyway.  I've already made my investment and know for a fact that at least in the long term between my BTC or ETH, one of those will at the very least double in price from these levels.  And That is absolutely the worst case scenario and most unlikely.  A more probable scenario is that both of those coins and others will do very well.   

In addition, the main reason i was telling people about crypto in the first place is because i see it as an amazing financial opportunity and would feel guilty not telling ppl about it.  Well I tried that, and now the WSJ is saying shut up too.  Good thing is now i won't feel guilty when this shit starts to get real again.  Perhaps in a few weeks....
Are we heading below 10k?
Can someone shine some light on the question why cryptocurrency is always flagged as a means to money laundering? The exchanges I signed up for asked for strict ID verification and I wouldn't know how to get $10 into the system and 'launder' it. Cash, however, if accepted by say a car dealer or like here in Sydney by builders, is very easy to launder by buying goods or services using cash and theb reselling. I am seriously struggling to see any damaging regulation in the cryptocurrency market that's constitutional. Some regulation, and thereby acceptance and stability, may be good for the overall market.
we have to hodl thats all i know - no matter what - weak hands will lose money ober time thats for sure
Anyone buy the dip?
Idk I don't like the look of electrum. I don't like the changing addresses. What wallet do you use?
The mempool is in incredible shape today!
When do you think we will see stable mainnet  lightning network enabled wallets on macOS, Windows iOS , Android etc? 

I really think this is the key, then having exchanges or even banks that can convert from bitcoin to fiat more or less instantly to a persons bank account/card ( say within 10 minutes) will really make this a viable payment system.  Though I guess if there are lots of people only using bitcoin amounts there is no need to convert to another currency.

New peak incoming since the drop 17 hours ago.
So what about the futures?, Bitcoin is still alive?, Ready for moon?.
when bitcoin start to make a bull run do alts loose more of their value because their trading pairs are in bitcoin?
One of the most interesting parts of bitcoin and blockchain in my opinion is that the blockchain can be analyzed.  My vision for this was initially that a company could create a management dashboard using blockchain data to analyze their financial position in real time.  With [Howard Schultz recent comments on bitcoin](https://www.coindesk.com/starbucks-chairman-hot-blockchain-cold-bitcoin/), my question now is **with the lightning network striving to be the way to buy coffee with bitcoin, will the coffee shop still be able to benefit from the data accessible to them through blockchain analytics?**
Lot of FUD at moment, don't fall into this. Hold and enjoy this trip to new highs.. üöÄ
Did anyone else just see someone buy 60BTC in one transaction? I wish I had 660k to throw around like that.

Suddenly a huge green candle appears!

See all the red in the streets? Buy the dip. Today was payday for me. Perfect timing :)

Past two years in a row, bitcoin dwindled at the end of Jan, then took off on bullish runs in Feb - I expect the same here to happen.
We are just about. The whales will get the price down
Does anybody know if there's a website or app which messages you when bitcoin goes below or above a certain price? So I don't have to maniacally pricecheck lol?
Here we go!
How much sat/byte should I set my transaction at considering current market conditions? Electrum is wonky as usual.

I wish to pay as little as possible as long as transaction confirms within a couple days or so.

Conspiracy theory: what if the Coincheck news was supposed to coincide with futures manipulation fears to crash the market .. but it didn‚Äôt work.
Why is everything so slow now?

Stock market is mooning in the other hand
the expiring futures pump
Guys lets face it Crypto could become a niche product, a collectible like baseball cards.  Its a great product but only cool to a small demographic.  The majority of the population just doesn't give a shit.  They are fine having an authority control their water, food, air, money, and even their Daylight Savings (kudos to V. Buterin for that twitter post).  

Yes I'm being sarcastic but also half serious.  The average person really doesn't give shit about the use cases and potential game changing technology behind Bitcoin and others.  They like to Get in Line, be told what to do, work "their" jobs and always take it up the ass deeper and deeper.

I imagine a big reason people invested in this space like me is because they are sick and tired of the old legacy elite power systems.  Obvious its the big reason Bitcoin was created in the first place., but the problem is will the Sheep ever wake the f up!  Or they gonna be like cool, the Fed released a Digital currency, my boss is like you want lame ass dollars or the new fed coin man!  Yea! Hey Johnny sorry about your Bitcoin, this Fed Coin is so cool, its like cash without a bank account and I don't have to think for myself.  
another dip, another time to buy

GAH! I'm tired of waiting on coinbase to distribute forked bitcoin cash over. I'm thinking I might have to try to make the move happen on my own....but I am a bit afraid of fucking it up and losing everything. 
Doug polk just said that satoshi didn‚Äòt want segwit in bitcoin. Why is that?
Advice for buying more BTC if price hits $10,900 tonight?

What are some things to consider when you decide to invest in a coin?
I have a Ledger Nano S with funds on it. I'm paranoid that I wrote down the seed wrong (I doubt it but I'd like the peace of mind). **How can I verify I wrote down the seed correctly?**

If I reset the device and the seed was written incorrectly, I lose my funds due to stupidity. If I test it with a wallet online, I risk exposing myself to thieves. Can I check it offline??

Thanks for the help.
I'm not going to get all preachy and tell any of you what to do. All I am going to say is that I purchased for the long haul. I am in. I believe that BTC could trade at 3000 this year and I also believe that 50k is possible. 

I am really new to the space having only gotten on the train in December, but fuck all. One thing has become pretty clear to me. No one knows what the fuck they are talking about. Some people get lucky and people think they know shit, but they don't. 

Will I speculate? Sure. I'll also be the first to admit I don't know shit. I know that for me, buying Bitcoin was the right decision. I honestly believe that Bitcoin is going to change the world.

$10k about to be tested for the third time.

Every time a support (or resistance) level gets tested, it weakens as long-term orders get filled and taken out. At some point, those orders get exhausted and the level breaks. 

Anyone eyeing $7k?
I made a lil crypto song and dumb video. Can I get some love? https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0Iq5Zl5vsGo
Hold strong guys!! We hit 12k the next 12 hours! Its only 43200 seconds
Selling Sunday

https://redd.it/7t7kbl 
Stop being spooked by all this FUD. The worst is over, we will not see a new low before a new ATH. Starting from Monday we‚Äôll see a good run and early feb a new ATH
I don't feel like we're gonna go below 10k today...
Don't think we are gonna go below 10k
Don't expect anything to happen at 4pm. This isn't going to turnaround until Monday at the earliest. 
I understand the GBTC 91:1 split was supposed to happen today. It doesn't seem to have happened yet; will it be after market close, I guess?
Keep selling, folks. I've got a buy order set for $10,650 that I want filled today ;)

Same here. It seems like lower priced alts are better for holding because the potential for bigger returns. I can't imagine bitcoin going up 5 or 10 times what it is now. If it drops to 5000 or so then different story. 
Damn, failed breakout @11400. Preparing for another bear run eh?
Is it me, or is bitcoin just dead :-(
Anyone else watching the stockmarket and usd. I have an itch that maybe its ALL going to crash.
Ffs...BTC hits $12,500 and I can unload my last .77BTC and pay off my car. So annoying...should have sold off everything when I paid off my house.
what is going to happen when it expires?

And the weekend coming... boring, boring, boring

So this is where the 99% ... the 'Have Nots' hang out.  Sigh ... such an angry, irritable and delusional bunch.  Deriding fiat, yet measuring your precious BTC using fiat.  Trashing alts, yet not understanding that most are based on the same tech as BTC.  Wanting BTC price to go up, yet not understanding that it's this price swings that makes it useless as a currency.  All the traits of the 99% Have-nots.
i want cheap bitcoins plox
