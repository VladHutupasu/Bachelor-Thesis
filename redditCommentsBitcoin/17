What stage of Cryptocurrency adoption are we in?


Innovators (2.5%) - I think this was between 2009 - spring of 2017


Early Adopters (13.5%)  - summer 2017 to present.   I think we are still in this stage.  Do you agree?


Early Majority (34%) - maybe begins when price breaks 75k.  Early adopters finally got their family members to invest.  To the moon!!! 


Late Majority (34%) - price breaks 300k. People start to use it regularly as currency. 


Laggards (16%) - price breaks 1 million. Almost everyone knows about bitcoin and many are actively using it.

How is the SEC meeting on monday going to affect the price this weekend?

Have anyone thought about the fact that the first government issued crypto currency is a fraud?

Bitcoin is supreme 
So we happily got the balloon over an altitude of 9,700 feet.  For this flight I took the liberty to paint a giant green dildo and a message ‚Äú10k or bust‚Äù on it.   Let‚Äôs do this!
10k incoming 
FOMO hitting hard!  
Ok my Daily Discussion is this.

10kneveragain my arse. To the moon!
Good morning Europe!! ‚ù§Ô∏èüá™üá∫
Let's see if the bulls can push us over 10K!
Where are the fudder dudders recently? Btrashers are given vacations from their shillfarms on rallies or what?
Where's the Kaboom? There was supposed to be an Earth shattering KABOOM!
**Keep Fighting Bulls!**
May the 4th be with Bitcoin! 10k today?
Price won't fall. If you want cheap Bitcoins, better buy now. Before it's too late. üòÑ

Remember that time when I said: "This is your last chance to buy below 8k". And people got all angry with me? Where are they now?
Real noob here sorry,  but I'm looking to buy some Bitcoin. I have a (software?) wallet - Electrum. If my PC is turned off, and I send Bitcoin to the wallet address, where does the money go until I turn on the PC, surely my wallet is inaccessible if I'm offline?
Still early in the day, I expect later this evening we will have an attempt at $10k
Bitcone ! 
http://bitcointicker.co just popped up a message that bitcoin just had a 24 hour low of $0 on bitfinex! I missed it, but did anyone else get to buy in at that price :)
Ready up your 10k memes bois
Flying high now baby!!
Got my big green dildo out for tonight! 
Steady now, steady does it 
10k, 10k, 10k!!!!
The lotion is ready.....
Paint dick, green paint..
Next stop 10k
Good morning.
Love me some Bitcone...
Now look here chaps.

There's a shallow woman who won't fuck me until my BTC portfolio is worth over 50k.

Just a few k off.

Could some unselfish bastard push the price over 10k for the sake of my knob?
When Bitcoin hits $1 million will people still buy? At that point the price would have to climb to $2m just for someones $20 dollar investment to double to $40. 
Assuming we hit $1m Bitcoin in 2023, thats 15 yrs from genesis to $1m. So will it take an additional 15 years to go from $1m to $2m? 
...And have to wait 15 yrs for that $
20 dollar investment to become $40?
..Thoughts??
My personal portfolio is at -0.93%

Hasn't looked that nice in a long time. But there's a very strong resistance at my break even. 

It's as if the market *knows*... 

*spooky*
Hello there.
Toying with the Goyim. Get used to it. #goldmansachs 
What's funny is that everything after 4/20 has been sideways price action lol.
Stand by Europe for a day when BTC will slip her panties up and down around 9800, but never *quite* take them off.

As Europeans you are probably used to that.
If bitcoin hits 10K this weekend, what would happen in the next 7 days after that?
BTC vs Gold:  Much discussion about this, and a great deal of misunderstanding I suspect:

1)  Does the usability of a store of value affect its price?  

There's actually very little evidence of that.  That's a starting point.

2)  Is Gold or BTC a better store of value or a better means of exchange?

Well, BTC is very volatile - but the volatility trends upwards - so that's part of the appeal :)

Regarding means of exchange: 

Consider this: if you have 10k's worth of gold under your bed, and wish to sell it - at the current 'market price' - How do you do that?  Think about it.  Where do you take it to sell it?  Fact is, you can't.  (Except maybe at a Cash for Gold type place, or some Gold scrap dealer, or on the black market, where you will lose 30-50% of its 'value.')

If you have 10k worth of BTC in your wallet, where can you exchange that? - hundreds of places, for a small percentage fee.

Sermon over.


Question:
What is the best way/site... To convert Visa/MC gift cards to Bitcoin?
Long lower shadow on previous day candlestick is a bullish sign. :)
Come on 10k!
The past few hours on the gdax 5min view (for GBP or USD) seem to be showing violent rises and falls. Does anyone have any theories on it? Don't think I've seen that sort of patterns before! 
Go, go, go!!!
Tension is rising...
Huminah huminah shizam!

A little data for anyone who may want some insight: My last four bitcoin purchases (from most recent to least recent) were at $9060, at $7200, at $6700 and at $6350.

Around $500 equivelent purchased each time. I consider myself a casual buyer.
**Bitcoin Sets Sights Above $10K After Bull Breakout**

https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-sets-sights-10k-bull-breakout/

Following a bull breakout last night, bitcoin (BTC) looks set to test $10,000 and could possibly move higher over the weekend.

Bitcoin closed yesterday (as per UTC) at $9,759 on Bitfinex - the highest daily close since March 7 - signaling the upside break of the week-long narrowing price range we've been anticipating.

The cryptocurrency also clocked a two-month high of $9,875 yesterday. At time of writing, BTC is changing hands at $9,776 and remains on the hunt for a big break above the $10,000 mark, as indicated by the bullish setup in the technical charts below.

View

BTC looks set to test the 200-day MA resistance of $10,015. A close (as per UTC) above that level would strengthen the bull grip and could yield a sustained rally to $10,455 and above.

The outlook remains bullish as long as prices hold above the ascending 10-day MA, located at $9,290.

An unexpected close (as per UTC) below $8,652 (April 26 low, pennant low) would signal a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change.
Red lambo or black lambo?
