Fuck it...I'ma go drop acid instead of worrying about Bitcoin today.
Gratitude for Bitcoin, 
It is beginning to feel la bit like late last summer again. After the UASF won a 2 year+ very heated debate and Bitcoin finally got a malleability fix implemented. 
IMO that changed everything and demonstrated a whole new level of anti-fragility, within Bitcoin.

Just thank you to everyone in the community. Changed a lot of lives already.
Hey Merica... there oil at 20k
Surprising that this time altcoins are pumping without bitcoin increasing proportionately or significantly.

Any thoughts on that? 

BTC dominance slightly reducing as well...
I üëè can üëè feel üëè it üëè coming üëè in üëè the üëè air üëè tonight

Oh HODL üëè
We've been fooled so often in the past weeks by slowly rising prices. I just can't bring myself to fully trust it... yet...
**Come On America, wake up!**
**The Road Is Open For The Bulls.....**
seatbelts motherfuckers
go bitcone
Feeling more optimistic than I was a week ago for sure. Still feeling slightly cautious as I feel we need Bitcoin to pump into the 5 digits and find support there for the general public to be brought back in. Still have some skeptic friends who believe this is a dead cat bounce and that the general public is going to have been too traumatized by the post-$20k crash to be lured back in, but I think many of them are still ripe for some good old-fashioned Satoshi Christ evangelism.
Stop analyzing every single day.  Watch this plant grow 
On the 6th April I posted this when BTC was 6700  https://ibb.co/cW6Qp7

I'm now back to claim my gratitude and thanks from you all.  You're welcome 

We did ask for steady growth 
who the hell is pumping BCash.  I got some for free at the fork but since then I've never met a REAL person who actually wants to buy it
All dips are being bought up. Bears are losing. 9k coming fast. 
I invested another 750 dollars last week by going into my savings figuring that I can replace that savings with my upcoming check which is tomorrow, would it be crazy to invest another 750, with the thought process that I can replace that with the check after that?
Looks like a lot of orders just auto filled at ~8290-8300

As a Bitcoin expert, I can say with absolute certainty that the price shall go up, or down, or possibly stay the same.
It feels like it wants to big green boner
really nice buy down at 8,170 on GDAX I saw a nice block of 21 BTC get bought which immediately stopped the down move and we ripped higher off of that

8170 is the line in the sand for now guys
**$8,300: Bitcoin Seeks Direction at Key Price Hurdle**

https://www.coindesk.com/make-or-break-bitcoin-nears-key-resistance-hurdle-at-8300/

Bitcoin (BTC) remains in bullish territory today, but a major break above the long-term descending trendline has been elusive.

That failure on the part of the bulls means the cryptocurrency needs a major move above $8,300 soon to lessen the risks of another sell-off. The trendline resistance is around $8,285 currently.

However, soon before press time, BTC was closing in on that target level and changing hands at $8,226 on Bitfinex (up 1.4 percent on a 24-hour basis). So, the next few hours are likely to determine the pattern going forward.

View

A high-volume break above $8,300 would confirm a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change and open the doors for a move toward $8,800 (10-week MA).

Repeated rejection at the key trendline hurdle would boost the odds of a deeper pullback to $7,510-$7,200.
It really hurts missing out on the rise like this. Unfortunately I had to sell all my crypto to pay my taxes sadly.
Crypto AD ban could a blessing in disguise - more organic growth
8300 BABY
relax,  pump ain't done yet üòé
Good morning Europe!
Lets have a really positive end to April and then kick on over the next few months.  
BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY 
Bitcoin is like a mother to us all, fight for her! 
Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for liftoff.
Next stop, 8700 hopefully by Friday night. Keep it going.  BUY BUY BUY!  ALL IN!
God I'd be nervous if I shorted because of the tax day fud.
Will it cross? Where's betting guy??
**Come On Bulls**
Now, what?
Hope some of them altcoins gainz flows into btc next hours/days
:D dat greeny dat greeny :D
I believe this is the start of a long bull run, and I want to margin trade on the long position to make more money. Poloniex has been "verifying" me for weeks and so has Kraken. I doubt they'll ever get their shit together. 
       I live in USA. Do I have any options or do I have to miss out? 
Looks like this is going to be a battle.

Green dildos should be coming soon.

People are slowly and surely coming back to BTC and cryptocurrency in general. Good $ign
HODL!!!

Ridiculous Bcash shitcoin pump over.

Now maybe some genuine investments will move into BTC.
HODL!!!
Now that we have crossed... do we stop at 11,800 again...lower then that? or do we hit the stride and take off.
Your TA's have no power here, this it bitcoin
hey Sub, I decided 2 share my btc story with u, a subreddit I never registered, only observed until now.  

about 2yrs ago I've read about btc and it was love at first sight. Put all my savings (wasn't much - I'm still yung) in it  ‚Äì because I believe in it. 

Now consider this a more philosphical point of view ‚Äì btc helps me live in a country with very high living costs and get the best education I could dream about, even made some profit for my mom. You see it's not about cashing out, I see it more as a reserve, which could grow with all of us and in times of need you can reach out for it. No one needs luxury items, its about being financially independent/ flexible and helping others. <3 have a nice day and keep hodling <3
So what's all this "massive botnet pump and dump" everyone's been going on all about?
This sideways movement around high 7000 low 8000 is a classic example of what traders call consolidation in which market movers accumulate more coin before it spikes higher.  It is a BULLISH sign!
The short term moving average is above the long term moving average on every timescale chart on GDAX right now.  Not bad bitcoin, not bad.
we all wait.....
next wales dildo....
to quote Mr Sulu "THE NEW SCREENS HELD"
I'm gonna point my miner at solo.ckpool for a bit. 

WISH ME LUCK!
curious if theres anybody here that sells coins via LocalBitcoins?  I'm considering signing up as a way to make extra cash and promote the industry in my area.

Less than an hour to go.  Let's see if we can breach 8300 tonight.  This is our chance!
I'm trading totally unafraid (not recklessly, mind you) because I know that no matter how low the BTC drops that [it will come back up](https://youtu.be/QPkR6FGY6zw), and even surpass the current level.
Can bitcoin's dominance percent affect its price?
Buy order for $18 mil on Bitfinex @ 8250 appearing and disappearing. I think we can safely presume the long side manipulation has started. 
BTC Shorts have been increasing in last 3 days even though price has been gradually increasing.

Interesting.
tense moment. Will we make it past the 8380 from before the dip?
Are you guys ready for a big pump? Personally expect that when 8500 is broken near 10.000 will be reached in a few hours/days and I‚Äôm normally really not the one making these big price predictions but this resistance area is just to important to be ignored by the big players.
today we break the walls of 8400 for good
Meh, still waddling sideways in the channel between the last high of 8915 on 3/23 and the low of 6603 about 10 days ago, sort of like a drunk who's trying to make his way to the liquor store for another bottle of Cold Duck. Anybody who claims to know the direction this thing is going to go in the next 30 days (other than maybe still sideways) is nothing more or less than a *liar*.
Today will go down in history as the Battle at Log Downtrend.
Hey can someone help me with different wallets ? which is best... and whats the fee differences ?
https://news.bitcoin.com/yes-you-can-buy-your-world-cup-ticket-with-bitcoin/
Is that true?
Hi guys,

First ever reddit post but I've been watching this sub for a few month now.

Question: Does anyone here think that we will see downward movement in price if 50 day SMA is not met today?
I'm guessing but I think the next hour will see us past $8300
How do you guys keep up with the charts?
 Can't even sleep well anymore, if I stick to holding is it possible to make gains too ? 
This is it.. We are adopted.. Amazon wants us.. Pornhub.... Wow.
Hallo an alle,
habe heute einen interessanten Artikel zum BTC gefunden. Der Chart zeigt seit einigen Tagen Auff√§lligkeiten, die an Notenbankinterventionen zur Stabilisierung von FX Paaren erinnern. Es wurde best√§tigt, dass Miner einen Kurs von √ºber 8600$ ben√∂tigen um mit Gewinn Coins sch√ºrfen zu k√∂nnen. Ist eine ziemlich gef√§hrliche Entwicklung wenn Ihr mich fragt. Was denkt Ihr dazu?
_______________
Today it was confirmed that the break-even point for miners is at 8600$. I found an article that shows a pump and dump on the btc over the last days. That is extremly dangerous for the BTC if it turns out to be true...

Bearmarket in 2018? Mohahahahahaaa, not when dracula is in the game. *Wink*
Is Bitcoin correcting?  I see red candles.  Let's take a vote.

Is it Bitcoin Season or Altcoin Season, or is this a Bull Trap? Any thoughts?
And we're back down again
SELL!!!
I need to have a better understanding as to how in the long term Bitcoin will stay valuable.  If its supply is finite then  i imagine it will have a cap on its price which would happen once the last coin is mined?   I can't think of another example of something on earth that is valuable and definitively Finite (sorry could be a stupid question and haven't had coffee yet).   They always seem to find more Gold and Oil so that's more unknown/guess work.
Bull market will not start until May/Jun
Hey fellas beginning a livestream of BTC price analysis and trading, open discussion format for anyone interested.

 8250 sell - 8170 buy, just add +15$ and repeat. Just a thought.  
Episode 9 of the greatest cryptocurrency podcast in history is out, this week the guest is Roy (@startaletv on twitter, ceo of globalhalo). Listen here: https://soundcloud.com/cryptoweekly

What do you guys think about this? Future of Crypto payments in retail markets.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PF5dlvKxCVs 
What are the implications of gifting Bitcoin? Who pays tax afterwards? 
[removed]
They say that day trading is a skill, so practicing should make you good at it right? How long someone should spend to go from newbie to advanced ? 
If I want to convert my investments to fiat money, I heard that I can use Gdax or Coinbase. Which one would you guys recommend, and why ? 
Once we breach the 8391,23 barrier we might be heading for 8461,78.


Anyone know why bcash is on the rise?
[deleted]
(ELEC) and (OMG) going to break out soon. 
Its time to admit that Lightning Network is dead end. Even shitcoin like Verge can be accepted as payment without Lighning Network. How is this possible? 
Based on the DATA

What will happen Friday Morning, Friday Night, and Sunday night? It seems it crashes Friday morning, and Friday after 6pm it goes up up up, then sinks a little on sat, and is good Sunday night again.

Is this consistently what happens? Can anyone screen shot every weekend and see?
What is bitcoin you can't buy anything with it as the fees are too high
Can't. Break. 8.4k. üôÇ
