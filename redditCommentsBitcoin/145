Can we get a price/daily discussion sticky again? Upvote for mods attention
The Daily Discussion threads get renewed daily. There will be times when mods choose to sticky a different thread, in which case the Daily Discussion thread will still be available on the front page. 
They seem to keep replacing it, it's frustrating. Personally I'd rather see it there all the time and that don't invest recklessly post removed. It has been up there long enough and people do whatever the hell they want. 
OR

Let's discuss here lol

When is it hitting a billion?
Fuck! looks like I jinxed it lol
