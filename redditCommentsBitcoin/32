Who let the bulls out?!!!
[deleted]
A couple of hours of flat lining around $8500 and then another big break out to $9200 please or higher.
It feels like December again, prepare the 9000 memes!!
Well boyz, 
I’ve went from pessimistic to optimistic. I’ve held through that Mt. Gox crash right on up. Sold some and bought back at 6.5k Survived the recent free-fall and I had my finger on the button to sell all if it reached that point. It didn’t. I feel better now than I have before the November spike. I feel that we’re on a good path. Stay real and don’t get too cocky and If you do then you better own a lambo. Happy 420!
Closing in again on the "McAffee Dick Line".

Strong resistance there.
10k by the end of the month, I had a dream and I'm very attuned to the environment so it must be true 
4/20 let’s see bitcoin get high 
Is it just me or is Coinbase raising their fees in the midst of extremely high volume? As if I didn’t have enough reason to hate Coinbase/GDAX, they pull this crap raising their fees up to 3x the normal 0.25% fee to buy and sell Bitcoin at market prices on their exchange. Not to mention, lately GDAX has indicated “partially degraded service.” Is this a conspiracy by Coinbase, a sudden move to take advantage of this dire moment? I swear once I can get into Robinhood, I will never trade with Coinbase. I despise and hate everything about them. They are the new Mt. Gox.
Thanks to all who add a word or two
It enjoyable to see what everyone is saying
have a great weekend
GET HIGH AND HODL

I'm confused. According to those fucktards who predicted the end of the world within the end of the month shouldn't we at 4k by now?
Chronic & Crypto.  This ain't a game.  This is my life!
Most stoners are buying to get more weed money or bitcoin network is blazing after dank dabs - either way i thank 420 for this sexy candle
Vegeta incoming !!!
I would like to take a moment and express my deepest gratitute to all the stoned buyers.
GG lol Shorters get rekt
**Come On Bulls, show us you mean business!**
[deleted]
I just realised it's 4/20 and BTC is high AF rn compare to a few weeks ago.
Here we go bois. 8500->8720
Quick get the memes
[deleted]
GET THE MEMES OUT! VEGETA INCOMING
Why would anyone attempt to short anything when it has this type of momentum, shouldn't they all wait til the momentum tails off
We got rejected. Quick give Vegeta some magic beans!
When the pump has come 👏

And the nite is dark 👏

And the shorters 👏

Are the only commenters we'll see 👏



No I won't 👏

Be afraid 👏

No I won't 👏

Sell a BTC 👏

Just as long... 👏

As you HODL, HODL by me  👏
When Bitcoin hits the new ATH, how could one know when to sell in order to  buy back in in the pullback?
These bastard bears are not giving us an inch around 8500!  
The only thing bad about bitcoin steadily rising is that I don’t have enough of it yet.  Wish I was here   A year or more ago. 
8700!!! w00t
Its Bitcoins turn to be amazing
itshappening.gif
Time to cash out our altcoins we hoped would take off the last 4 months but never did and go back to bitcoin. Please don’t let the transaction fees skyrocket again. We can’t take that again. Hope this lightning thing works as advertised. We’ll see soon. 
Here we go boys, here's that 8800 resistance we were all expecting. Let's go bulls! We got this shit
Double pay day today my glib globs!!
over 9000
bitcoin broke the $ 8500 resistance and will continue to move up on the short-term uptrend
Bitcoin is wake and baking on 4/20. Let’s keep that high going baby!
Shorter's getting rekt.  


Where you at bears?  Where you at? 
Right now the price is above the MA50 in the daily chart. If we can manage to hold it there, and maybe finish another whole candle above, that would be a very bullish sign...
**Stay On Your Guard Bulls**
I was hoping to get to a full bitcoin before the next rally. Oh well, to the moon! 
Hopefully this steady and slow climb up atleast means we won't see any crashes. 
Lord they are pumping Bcash hard haha
Realistic market cap at the end of 2018? 

I say $700 billion full market cap. With majority of it belonging to top 5 cryptos.

I hope shitcoins get flushed soon, vitalik is right.
Anyone see an attempt at $8600 in the next 5 or so hours?
what the hell is going on
**Support The Bulls**
TO THE MOON
FOMO SEASON
Sheeeiiittt..... 12K by Sunday?
So, now I wonder if we're going to take on $9.2k this week-end. 
Everyone, take heed. Those friends/family members who acted like complete jackasses and crowed to you about how they didn't lose money by avoiding le ponzi scheme Bitcorn? They're back. And they'll be asking you for advice on how to make easy money for that new car or house!  

That being said, I'm not pouring anymore new fiat into Bitcoin until we get the next rejection. I'm not sure whether we'll pass prior ATHs. We have many who bought at the top and didn't sell, so we may see a dump-off before the next run-up. 
btc 20k! Moon soon, then lambo
IT'S OVER 9000
Don't worry people - that was unsustainable and driven by some mindless altcoin trading.

For example: Bitcoin Gold up 50% in 7 days? - completely absurd.

Steady climb is better.  But 9k is still possible this weekend.

Good for Bitcoin :)
**Support The Bulls**
Do we have a bart pattern forming here?
Just bought 0.1 of a Bitcoin a few hours ago, and low and behold the price jumped up shortly afterwards.

I didn't realize just how much sway I have over the crypto market.
new day boies
How about some of those shitcoins gains flow into btc pls?
Lets have a really positive end to April and then kick on over the next few months.
pump it up!pump it up!
Where is https://www.reddit.com/user/stokelycalm when you need a good laugh?
Can the Americans do something already....been 3 hours since that last move. Enough time for breakfast, coffee and a poop. 

So lets get back to the machines and hammer it. 
**Come On America** 
All the experts who are good at reading the charts, how's it looking? When's the next resistance point? Should I buy more btc now or wait a little?
On here I see just about everyone looks at the charts and the index’s and stuff like that more than anything it sounds like. I look at the book more than anything when trading and I day trade, usually like 2-4 buys and sells a day and I usually always take a profit even if only a couple of dollars or I sell/buy neutral to be on the safe side if I don’t feel comfortable with predicting which way the market is gonna go. Just curious if people watch the book more, less, or about the same as the charts and RSI and trend lines and stuff? 
So, what's new.  Nice to see 8.5.  Any signs of it breaking out?
Roger and his goons and puppets are pumping bcash hard 
Prepare for the next breakout...
I live in a popular city in Sweden and I wish to get my hands on some Bitcoin stickers to raise some awareness to the general public. There are literally thousands of people walking outside my apartment everyday & I could just sneak out at night on my way to the shop and relister it whenever it gets removed. Have noticed a trezor sticker around here but that doesn't help BTC very much.

Where can I buy some?
Some interesting stats to keep an eye on and compare differences before and after any major shifts. My bet is there will be a lot more $1000 to $10000 addresses after the next run
https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html
We pumping now boys!
Pump it up babyyy
Oooh honey child!
Reason for pump? I feel if I buy now I will get burned later 
Thunnnnderrrrrr
5:00 payday on east coast. 
And this is just the start. Watch all the shitcoiners jump into btc now. Then the fomo can really kick in. 
M00n
Welp, we are above 8800.

[Doc Brown is bullish](https://imgflip.com/i/28fm7b)


I bought at 8.3k in March and HODL'd at 5.9k. Wish I bought more then! 😭 Fomo to the max.
When the alts correct, much of that dough will be coming back into BTC :)

That's approximately 1 metric-fuck tonne (= 100 shitloads) of investment.
Europe will be waking up soon. Are they going to take profits? Highly likely. Please don't though.
getting closer...
Didn't really expect $9.2k to come up this week-end
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS+
Markets work in cycles. Period.

Don't lose your faith if the correction now takes us back to  mid to late 7k as extreme correction to the recent run from 6.5k. 

If that happens and it pivots from there, it will be a good buy opportunity for traders.

For the rest of hodlers like me, anytime is a good time to buy 😁
Well, that was fun
I know I keep going on but this is a crucial period for Bitcoin, please buy as much as you can, even if it's only $10 worth.  Many thanks.  
Whooohooooo...!!
Forrest Pump
I made almost as much today with btc as my take home paycheck for work. Maybe it's time to retire and have btc be my job/hobby, or I'll just wait til I'm back in the green first(only $8,000 to go!)

Only about 8% of Americans own Crypto as of March 2018 according to CNBC. I do not know what the percentage of ownership is for the rest of the world? However, I would say we are all considered "first to the party".
Bull run officially on?
to the moon!!! 
So how big is this going to get ? 
holeee shiettt 420 greeny green green
To the moon!!!!
She's correcting down now people. Damn stoners
Bart pattern averted. For now...
Massive money coming into altcoins. Not a good a sign imo
For those looking at GDAX; that sell wall at $9000 is not real. It will vanish at the very last second. Keep buying right on through it. Pretend it's not there.
We are waking up in the US and this is the first pay-check Friday after Tax day...it’s on. I did my part already. I, like many, have cut my retirement contributions in half so I can invest more in bitcoin every two weeks
What’s up with the bcash pump? Roger been stacking up btc during crash? Was hoping for bash’ death after this crash.
Who else bought bitcoin  at 16K or more and still holding
On a strictly technical level we still have not broken out of a massive wedge. However things appear a bit promising that we are headed in the direction of a breakout. It seems this idea of a fractal pattern has some merit. I have no idea why that would be so.
Just want to toot my own horn a bit here.

I called this shit perfectly all week.  See below:

The short term moving average line is about to cross the long term moving average line (upwards) on the gdax one day chart. The lines are currently touching. This usually indicates a large bump is coming. Should happen in about 3.5 hours (or at least it should start happening).

Short term moving average is getting closer and closer to crossing the long term moving average on the 1 day chart. When that happens, bitcoin might really take off.

Sell at your own peril. Next week is going to be a great week for bitcoin. Time to HODL.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ce908/daily_discussion_april_15_2018/dxfubc0/

Nice! Had an order trip after 26 days on Gdax. It pays to be patient!
Go Team Bitcoin!
Buying Bitcoin
should I set a close sell stop already or is this downward trend only temporary? 
6 hour chart looks great, do not fear

The reason why bitcoin isn't moving much is because everyone is buying their asses off with altcoins
6542 . Is this the breakout? Is this just fantasy?
Does anyone use Abra?
like a week ago I asked for 420$ on 4/20, 600 is even better
Anyone updated the 9k meme recently?

Be good to have Vitalik in it somewhere.
Good morning Europe! Wassup?
BTC are Back his own track . just HODL !
get your memes ready
IT'S OVER 8950!
don't be shy...
Which exchange will determine meme launch?

Quick discussion - hurry!
slowly sneaking up on 9000...
someone break out the vegeta meme
This is going to be a fight.
Good for Bitcoin..
A lot of the main coins fell back a little from the highs of earlier, hopefully we will climb back up later on today.
Mamboons rdy...
Prepare for second approach...
I'm relatively new to this, I first bought btc last January but I've been buying the dips (but not all) ever since. I'm gonna break even when the price reaches 9000. Now I've set my sell stop at 8700, is that OK or should I just hodl for now? 
**Come On Bulls, don't throw this all away!** 
and here comes the reversal, trading sideways for a bit me thinks
mum asked me to buy her 1 BTC yesterday to use as her retirement fund/pension hopefully going to see her in a lambo at 60
420 - great day to chill, buy a Lambo, and let the smoke roll out the windows like Cheech and Chong! 
3 last days looks good for crypto. Hope it lasts...
In moments like this i love crypto :D (+100$ in 2 min)
All of these 2 - 25 BTC buys are a beautiful thing to see on this Spring day!
So glad I dipped into my savings again for another $750 to put into btc yesterday.
Next stop 9900
We just got paid. First Friday without the uncertainty of knowing if we owe taxes or not. Taxes are done. Time to buy. 
5:00 on the West Coast. Payday after tax season is so good plus waiting for the refund checks which is just the FED printing $’s causing inflation. Any currency relative to the $ will increase. 
Poor shorters...
Why its always that 1hr spike always create the huge climb? Could anyine explain? 
Too the moon 🎑 
will we see it dip back to under 8000? im not done buying cheap dips yet

If you've observed a BTC crash - observe an altcoin crash within the next 7 days.

:)
Things are looking bright :) 
I think we'll easily reach 9k.

But there is silly money going into some really low quality alts. 

That can't sustain.

The question is - when that altcoin market corrects, where will the money go?  

Out - or into established coins.
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo !!!
**Europe & others, we need to hold this level atleast until the Americans wake up, many thanks.**
It makes me so happy when people talk shit about me and claim I've said certain shit and they simply can't find the evidence to back it up.
Here come the little tiny teeny weenie profit takers taking tiny teeny weenie little profits. No wonder bitcoin can't break 9. And if it does, it won't last. 2017 was sure fun while it lasted; before it turned into just another FOREX.
