Does anyone know where I can apply to become a paid FUDster or altcoin shill? I could really use the extra cash to buy this dip
Never bought crypto nor slightly interested in ever buying but by golly this reddit thread is my goto daily soap opera. 
We're in 8K purgatory... 
Why do people get so excited every time the price rises for an hour 
Activate quantum immortality !
Had to get gas in my way to work. Def a sign a pump is coming. 
But. 
Took a shit at the office. Def a dump signal. Beware, another one is coming after lunch. 
I now know why acquaintances who've been investors longer than I only look at their portfolio a few times a year, because FUD is difficult to ignore and is contagious.

Having said that, my FUDy-duddy mood today is saying that this fluctuation at 8k is looking a lot like not being able to break through 9k last week, and 10k the week before that.
Exchanges should price in mBTC units rather than in full BTC units.

Unfortunately there's a "unit bias", i.e. a lot of people are not aware of the fact that they can buy fractions of a bitcoin.

If these people see **7.80 USD per mBTC** they'll think "hey, I can afford that! :)"
I deeply identified with this, not going to lie.

I bought in at the end of November, rode the wave all the way to the top, checked this sub every day, read articles constantly, my whole life was crypto. I finally sold when bitcoin came back up to my buy in after the huge crash, now coming back and looking at this sub it's so clear to see that it's full of people with no idea what they are talking about acting like they are experts and anything positive about BTC price being upvoted, and any negativity being downvoted. I'm sure there are some people here who actually have some clue, but these daily discussions are just pure fear, hype, and unsubstantiated speculation. 
I’m not selling hodl gang 
I am done with this market. Where do you get a bot from ?
This sub further confirms that we're in the "Anger" phase of the market cycle. "Depression" coming soon to a theater near you!
Something really strange happened to me earlier today: one of my smaller sell-orders triggered today at 7250€/BTC... I mean, I'm not complaining, I just don't understand why anyone would buy at that price-point right now.

Any ideas?
Welcome to a new Episode of BOT WARS. Now, live on GDAX. Who will win? The 167 Sellwall or the 2 50 and more little Buywalls ? 
I’m calling it: sideways action until the weekend

Too the moo......oh wait.  Fuck
**BULLISH!**

Whether the price increases or decreases, it is good for bitcoin! If it decreases I can buy more and it's on sale, but if it increases then its going to the MOON!!

The price can go to $0.01 and I won't even care, even if it shoots up to 100k, I still won't sell, cryptocurrencies are the future and I shitpost optimistic shit here to cope with crashes.
You won't believe what just happened! My mother just called me to ask about Lighting Network. I helped her setup a node. Apparently all of her friends are talking about it, and they've even seen stores (including their favorite quilting store) start accepting (and even encourage!) LN payments. Wow! We are going mainstream. This is incredible! 
This looks just too good to be true, so take it with a grain of salt. 1D Bollinger Bands show that volatility has never been this low since mid november, suggesting that the price will change direction one way or the other within days. 1D Market Momentum suggests the direction is up and 1D Stoch RSI suggests it's a matter of a day or two. Fingers crossed, everyone.

oh great another 8.1k -> 7.8k dip, wasn't expecting that
This is the market right now:

 mercury retrograde should last 3-4 weeks I suspect this will affect the price. 
When moon?
Got to love the huge buy wall on GDAX that is doing virtually nothing.  
Will we see bitcoin at ATH again this year?

I want to believe it will but the hype of crypto currency seems to have died. Don't get me wrong I still believe in crypto but now it's not like before were everyone at work was talking about crypto; there is no more FOMO (which is what skyrocketed price up so quick imo)

What do you think?
Stocks are getting destroyed too. Will this make crypto more attractive?

Oh look, just woke up, nother red day. Yaaaaayyyyyyyyy. *puts gun to forehead* 
Have we reached the bottom folks?
https://blockchain.info/de/address/1N52wHoVR79PMDishab2XmRHsbekCdGquK

who tf is this
My charts show that we’ve reached the bottom. Short term still volatile, but we will see a nice rebound up to 15k in the next 1-2 weeks.
I'm calling it: I'm obsessed with bitcoin 
Seeing Tom Lee for the first time on CNBC right now.   He looks nervous,  his body language and eye movements are screaming "I'm full of shit,  I don't believe what I'm saying"
From what I've seen in the past, sideways action for this long usually results in a break downwards. If it does break upwards though, it never lasts very long.
Free faaaallliinn and uh freeefallliinand uh!
From Bloomberg Technology:  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-28/crypto-s-billionaire-trading-king-has-suddenly-run-into-problems

So we have a "coin" created by someone that is anonymous, a market that is unregulated and prone to hacking and the largest exchange does not have a physical address or a bank account.  This will not end well for the HODLers.

Oh - and the blockchain technology everyone points to as the reason why it will go higher is available for free.

i see 8200,300 max. we never grow more than this per day. 
Bears attacked thats why it dropped sharply
That´s gonna be another fight against 8100 and then a dump to 7800 at night
It looks like only bots are trading with huge and random buy/sell walls popping out at gdax
GDAX freezing not working for me
My brain hurts reading this.  Everyone needs to some day trading (on binance) to learn the purpose of altcoins.  Dafuq u think USDT is for lol?
dang someone put up a 500 coin buy wall. ok ok
How much electricity does it cost to make 1 btc in china or in europe?
We are in the BB era.      A.k.a (Boring Bitcoin)
well, but popularity is growing in Africa! :)
You guys are missing the plot by focusing on the price.

The important news is Hong Kong's clamp down on exchanges and how they are fleeing.  Some may just decide to 'disappear' in the process.

Dropping below 7k today
Ruh roh, are we going to die shaggy?
I think people are getting fed up of crypto. I was in for 4 months had 16 different cryptos. 60% bitcoin. Got totally sick of looking at the price all the time. Feel happier with it just in the bank making a guaranteed £30 a month. I know bitcoin could be £30k by Christmas but I really don't care. Too much playing with my emotions. My mate who got me into crypto also pulled out.
this will see 6k again before 9k
Everyone's so angry at the 'whales' when the 'whales' were just like you 2 years ago. Sitting in their mom's basement in chat rooms, complaining about the 1%. They got lucky, BTC mooned and in a short period of time went from basement dwelling to beach living. You can always go back to playing your State Lottery! Better odds!
Are we actually still worried about the price at this point?

 We have been below the current price recently and new investors or people who believe in the technology got in. Many people who invested in December got out or are holding on for dear life. People who got in early either know the game and HODL or sold to get a nice gain. People sitting on the sidelines are comfortable waiting to see a clear move in either direction. Most weak hands have sold by now.

Long term I believe in bitcoin not only as an investment but as a solid alternative to conservative monetary systems. For any major move upwards, media coverage has to pick up again and we need a few weeks of a solid upward trend.

So instead of checking the price every five minutes I am now trying to do more reading on the tech side and explore how I can actually contribute to Bitcoin and cryptos as a whole. Because ultimately, the motor that is driving bitcoin is the community that has to develop bitcoin into a valid currency for daily usage or a solid store of value.

Where do you see the future? Is bitcoin gonna be digital gold or can it be a serious currency?

Edit: sorry for long text but just trying to get a discussion going that involves more than moon and doom.


Don’t let them get your coins guys, it’s madness to sell right now 

Don’t believe the hype 
Wow - this bombshell. Lets make cryptocalendar ! https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/87qaa5/there_is_no_physical_evidence_to_say_that_today/
There’s only around 50 people who own the large majority of bitcoin. They have to get bored or collaborate or something for this to go up. We found a price point 7800-8100 I believe that is the only solution. The craze is over.
Well, I was going to wait for 6k... now I’m thinking this is about as low as it’s going to go for now. I’m debating whether to wait or buy now and sell when I can get a 10-15% profit and try to buy lower later. Thoughts?
Is it me or is something happening?
Remember this . 
7500->7200->7500->6800->7200->5000 
Then 2 months later with a very good news -> 30000
Close your ears boys....this gonna be loud as hell: "HODL!!!" I am a small tiny miner. Mining on my gaming peecee..lol. I am not in a financial position to buy, even in the best of dips, I can only slowly accumilate by mining. Luckiy I can afford the electricity without having to sell my BTC. But blockchain is a technology with almost limitless potential and application. It is not going anywhere. It's here to stay and so is grandpa Bitcoin. Nevermind the doomsayers and weak hands. Hold on for dear life people. Give the Corporations, Bankers and Goverments time to acclimate to the new and improved future. They will come around eventually and then it will be our time to lift off.

Going forward, we fishes should group up to try and counteract some of the whale pump/dumps.  For example right after a whale pumps we could give a signal to the rest of the fishes to sell. Then all the fish sell at once. Then the whale gets rekt.  

Same for right after whale dumps we should buy.   Power in numbers.    What we’d need for this to work is some kind of smart phone app to send push notifications to our group when it’s go time. Has anyone tried this yet?  If not, I propose the name “Fishies Unite!”   Any good apps that can handle this? 
Today is gonna be a Green day :raised_hands:
What is the average investment for most of the common people in crypto? Half a coin? One coin or ten coins?
Mayday Mayday.  Cheap coin on sale please buy
BTC is getting destroyed. Definitely seeing sub 7k within the next 5 days.

Finally some good news...

Just major price manipulation for short futures contracts expiring tomorrow. After American taxes are done on April 17h, BTC is going to breech 15k again. 
Time for big cash out!
Not touching Bitcoin until it reaches $4,500.
I'm calling it: 100k in 10 days
SELL!
No, Its not time yet for the big move, I think low 6's are coming, Then on to real money
Like this post, if you have no clue where btc is heading and feel others also have no clue.
It's finally over guys. Bitcoin is done
I’m calling it, 6K by end of April

Does anyone know what time the futures contracts end today? 
bitcointicker.co doesnt seem to work properly for bitstamp chart.... what's going on..?!?!

Dat chart is trolling us
Every time it drops below 8k it jumps back up. Even if it gets to 7k it won't be for long.
how long until we break out (either up or down)?
I'm here from the future. It's November and asking for 1BTC is not 8K.

The alt coins are where the money will be made (and lost). They have a much better chance of 'mooning'. They also have a much better chance of disappearing!

Do we actually need Bitcoin to become a currency?  I mean I personally would prefer it to become Gold V2. 
This little volatility is insane
the GDAX depth chart is looking like this with that 550 coin buy wall

I know right, we need Dennis Rodman in here. All I can do is hope we are still 7k when I wake in the morning.
How does the futures market affect the price? I used to hear about that all the time, but no longer hear about it.  Did something happen? 
Scotty, I need warped speed now or we're all dead!!!
What is this shaize? CRAP.
Interesting prices, im hesitating to buy more, am i crazy ?
Hope my SEPA gets in on time
thats sound great
RIP 7500 buy wall :S
Such nice discounts for Easter 
there we go , sub 7500
Sub 7400 now, anyone think this dips under 7k?
Millions of worthless, unbanked dollars. 
$3k coming... time to buy soon...
Where's that LAMBO Guy?

It's great to have a regulated new currency, but when banks are still in power, not so much.
Is Bitcoin really dying right now? I could have never imagined the whole crypto market could go to zero so quickly. There is no bottom anymore, everything is lost now.
I am still not fully getting it. I watched a bunch of videos you guys sent me, and I understand that having a bank-free currency is great, but what I don't get, is that the currency price is based on the US dollar, and that other currencies globally are also based on the US dollar. If I purchase one US dollar Bitcoin at $8,000, and then sell it into Zimbabwe dollars, you still come out with the same (based on the USD) equivalency. 

The fact that it (price) goes up and down, makes no sense to me, as it's then based on demand? Or value of the dollar? And if it becomes the global standard, how does one Bitcoin labor hour of debt in the USA become 8000x the labor hour of Zimbabwe, when it's a global currency?

Also, how do you go to a bitcoin bank, and borrow for a mortgage? Is there someone who takes US dollars (a bank) and buys bitcoin, to loan you bitcoin to buy a house, and you pay back then at the current price? What happens if it goes way down, do you then pay more or less depending on the value of the dollar, if you are getting paid in dollars? I have so many questions. It just seems so much like a fad to me because it's overly complicated, especially when the US Government can print a trillion in paper and then use that to give to Iran, Israel, and other countries as 'aid'. None of it makes any sense when those currencies have no real value.
im calling it: 30k in 3 days
[deleted]
If you are selling at this levels its stupid.
Oh gosh the pump got dumped... nobody saw that happening 🙄
watch the charts. Watch the order books. You're dreaming if you think this can pick up and sustain momentum in the short term. We need a drop down to 6k again to create more hype when everyone starts to buy in again.
in days like these i love to blocks idiots-
Good morning all! So yesterday we didn’t have the massive crash the doomsayers were predicting. We reached a plateau of approximately $7900. Now’s it’s time for the whales and daytraders to make their money for the week - and I want a small piece of it. I’d like to see a steady pump to $9000 - are you with me?!
**Can a Satoshi be divided? and what is it called?**
Shields collapsing Captain!
We're still within the channel on the Pentarhudi chart: https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/YRZvdurN-The-target-of-current-bubble-lays-between-40k-and-110k/. For those unfamiliar, notice when it was made and how well it tracked the rise to 20k. Don't lose hope.

Could be worse, I could be invested in Bcough
GDAX down... adding a new coin mayhaps? 
All this bot buying looks like whales accumulating to me. I think we'll have to await to around Consensus before they finally let it go up
Multiple tests of 7.8k-7.9k over the last few days and it has held. Bottom reached?  Time to load up? 
I sold at just below 9k and re-bought at 7.8k, plus added some extra funds. The market should have improved by mid-April.

I expect to see a revisit to 9k within a week or so, which would mean a decent 15% profit from 7.8k. In a less optimal scenario I might have to wait 1-2 weeks extra. That's fine, I don't need fast returns. My main bitcoin stash is for long-term holding for 2-5 years.

It appears that the bounces have been adamant at around 7.7k. A similar scenario played out during the last dip to 7.3k; at 2.5% over the McAfee prediction line it seemed like bots bought up bitcoins and consumed the fall successfully. It was just a bit hilarious to watch it happen again, at 2.5% over the McAfee line, when certain traders were so certain to revisit 7.3k - 7.5k.

The McAfee line will fall one day, though that day is not today. Nor is it tomorrow or around the corner.
calm before the storm
What side of the political spectrum are people who believe in bitcoin typically in? Just curious

Who’s ready for MOON TIME?!?!
the end is nigh!
We’re up for the day folks, from this point we can be certain btc will never drop again.
Whales are waiting for $5850 - $5950. So do not waste your time here daily with your idea/news/fuds/charts/technical analyst/prediction/etc . Hodl your coins and do not scare.
If you are noob or kids. Do not cry here. Please sell your BTC asap and make us happy. Because after that we will see market recovery sooner.
NICE volume spike on gdax! Almost to 8k. A few hours before we reach 10k on our way to the moon. Hold on everyone it’s happening!
HODL!!!

If the block tech did something useful, it may make a btc pop again. But the usefulness of the block chain tech just isn't there for anything outside crypto right now. So why buy into a useless tech? Make some real world applications for us. 
Thanks gj.  You made an account just to post that... I'm honored. 
I don't know when the market will go back up, but I am practically certain it won't happen before tax season ends in the US. Too many people (myself included) who aren't sure how much more they'll need to pay in taxes, or how much they'll get from their return (if at all).  

I'm not saying it will go up after everyone gets their returns, but it definitely won't happen before.

Lots of people being forced to cash out to pay for their gains in December too, even if they're now at a loss.

People who really can analyze the BTC pattern or the people who can affect the market, you think they would ever come to this subreddit to ask/give opinions?
A $50 drop followed by a $100 rise right after, wat.

Whyyy spongebob? Whyyy???...
This is now the norm so get used to it. Bitcoin will never 'moon' again. Think about it. You're expecting people to start buying at such a low price and eventually they will. But pay $9000, $10,000, $12,000 or $15,000. Who will pay that much? So we're stuck and will be confined to small blips moving forward.
Where are we headed? What are the experts saying?
Why Bitcoin Could Drop To $3,500 Soon (BTC)
https://etfdailynews.com/2018/03/28/why-bitcoin-could-drop-to-3500-soon-btc/
It's called Bitcoin Core and not Bitcoin Moon for a reason.
I hope this is the bottom but im still unsure. Im thinking people will invest after easter with it being such a younger market and college kids are getting money for easter and instead on saving it throwing it at crypto. But its just a guess.
Nice to see a spike, hopefully we will be rolling to 9-10k in no time! 
I’m calling it: 10k by midnight tonight.
Omg I called this drop two days ago and 3 to 7 days will be at 7.5k to 6.5k just saying and I'm a high school drop out pays to live in the bay area dumping 500k when btc at 2.5k in 15 weeks
My hot tip was correct. GDAX down and btc will be sub 1k with in hours. Hate to say I told you so.
Hot tip from the top: market is about to severely crash to sub 1k and never recover. Sell now and save yourselves. Over and out
