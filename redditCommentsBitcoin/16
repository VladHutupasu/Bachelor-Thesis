Daily Discussion, May 05, 2018
Hopefully I‚Äôm wrong but I suspect it may take all weekend to really break 10k. The amount of people who are going to sell every time it gets close has to be massive. It‚Äôll take time to get through all of them is my guess 
Another stack of shorts just got rekt on bitfinex. Nice to watch. üòÑ
No cheating now, hodl your memes. 
Crossed 10K on binance
Guy who wrote 10k never again deletes articles, changes name*
ring ring.... 
A- they bought it at 9959.00..
B - send it sideways and then domp it.. put Vitalik on the line..
So close to 10k
I have just hit break even. Feels good! üòä
so much edging
Buffet and his demented friends' comments is having little effect, people are slowly realizing they're off the hook. The conferences in May will give real insight to people still new to btc, enough with ignorant craptalk.
Puuusssshhh
10k come at me bro
So close...
For everyone watching 10k it has never been hard to break in the past. All we're missing this time is massive fomo.
Can someone who is like REALLY smart help out here... On the BTC futures that are listed on CFTC and what Goldman will soon be pushing... I take it that people who are buying these DO NOT actually OWN the keys or seed words correct? The banks / firms still do? If so I can see this being an issue move folks getting wiped out... NOT YOUR KEYS NOT YOUR CRYPTO. Am I wrong in this??? Thanks. 
question: what kind of really cool and crazy things will bitcoin specifically enable in the future when it's truly adopted by everyone on the planet?

i get micropayments but what else?
Hodl the line!
Obviously I should have bought at 6k, but should I buy now or wait? 10k fomo
It's all good guys, Mongolian new year sell off... buy the dip...
I‚Äôm not Bcash supporter at all. I actually know people working with the Japanese embassy to have Ver come before a house sub-committee to answer questions on bait and switch tactics which defrauded a lot of the older generations. (Allegedly)

I am all in for Bitcoin but scale ability isn‚Äôt we‚Äôre we need it now. The market never lies. Once it‚Äôs ready, the sky is the limit. We all play out part. I am relying on the devs to hopefully have bitcoin retail ready by end of year. I will do my part in keeping confusion out of the market and the likes of Roger Ver will not be part of this technology‚Äôs future if he continues his tactics. That is guaranteed. 
You will hear about it soon around July what the investigation has turned up. For the devs, please keep doing what you do best and we are year to support you. 
Dat 10k hole is about to be penetrated
About $100 to go on GDAX. Itshappening.gif
What do you guys reckon will happen when we touch 10K ? FOMO or big sell off ? 
*Don't breathe...*
Big 10K sell wall for BTC on Bitfinex
Can I pay an online retailer by using a GDAX withdraw? Is that a safe way to do it? I've been trading for almost a year, but never actually bought anything with btc...yikes I know
Will we breach 10k today?
yes [  ]   no [  ]
If bitcoin hits 12k alts are gonna go insane
*Obliterate* that sell wall at 10k, bois.
This market manipulation is giving me a strange form of blue balls..

It‚Äôs as if J.P. Morgan himself is keeping Bitcoin from ‚Äúclimaxing‚Äù to 10k.
Su Su na - Keep fighting !
Here we go!!
C'mon, PUNCH IT CHEWIE!!!
When 1 BTC = 10 M?
bought some more at 9480 ish - this is got to be close to the bottom!
Some whale is having none of this. Bidding thousands just below market. 
**Keep going Bulls.**
Time to dust off those $10k memes
[deleted]
can you please explain to a noob - isn't Bitmain capable of pulling a 51% attack if they dominate the mining market with their ASICs and own majority of nodes?
one more short squeeze then fomo cream all over the bears mouth 
Hello üëã 
10k come come :D
It's pumping.
only $75 more and we are at $10k.
today is the dayy
Noooooooooooooooo   :)
Are we waiting for the American markets to be in full swing before we try for $10k?
Yo Yo...my t-food is poppin!
We are making a meal of this this 10k ... Come on bitcone !!
wow my uncle posted some BTC jam on Facebag, anyway if he is ^^^^ old fashion guy

I take get a gold plated jeep instead of the lambo
wondering how the wankers at r/buttcoin feel now
Hello. I come to tell a problem about "kraken". I placed a purchase at 9530 lever 5 . FOR 0.5 BTC, when the price hit the target, the order was automatically canceled by 
 kraken for a false reason. I think I change my platform for this reason.  when the US will be at 10K dollars, I hope that Europe will push for 10 K euros;
lame
The end of the weekend pump?
My body is ready.
Looking for suggestions. What is the best simple phone wallet for small daily transactions
Hope this is those bots/ppl who were gonna offload at 10k and we can retest is later 
January correction has made me so skeptical that I just sold all my btc at 9580 USDT. Now, it's back up :| 


FML
Is this all just the build up to go for $10k again today or maybe we will have to wait a few more days?
Just used crypto to buy some stuff online. Just a matter of time before credit cards are not used anymore.
I‚Äôm thinking about taking some profits guys....argghhh
Don't like where this is going.
We're very close to reaching the Golden Cross (counterpart to the Death Cross that occurred 1 month ago). I consider this to be very bullish because I expected the bear trend to last longer. Some people think the 2017 bull run is still in play.

Approaching singularity...
We‚Äôll pass 10k it‚Äôs just going to be a tough go at first.  Psychological factors and the fact that there are probably a number of people looking to sell in the 10k ballpark.  Momentum is there though and will continue to roll on soon enough.

*in before the dog pile - yes this is just my opinion and my statement is based on nothing more
Here we go. Sunday pump. It's a thing now.
Time for a dip
doooomp it...
Wont make me popular here :)

Sold the lot at 9600k

Want this sucker to drop

Fuck hodling take profits and get back in lower
She's about to squirt...
Maybe we hit 10K and 10am EST?
Big walls, will fall. 
Technically we are still in a wedge. However there are some faint indications of a possible upward break out beginning to form. Volume is increasing while price us rising. Any large investor will have lost out on discounted prices if this pans to be true. 
My VERY GOOD source says 12k in 2 weeks (Friday the 18th to be specific) then dip of about 10-15%. Privileged information so y‚Äôall should feel lucky
Looks like the balloon is out of fuel this trip. We‚Äôll have to set her down for a while.  Maybe next weekend üí™

Watching someone buy 1 BTC every four seconds on GDAX... XD
Good morning fellas zombies of crypto, about to go live with some new ideas on good ol' Bitcoin! [https://www.twitch.tv/krowncrypto](https://www.twitch.tv/krowncrypto)
If you know that you need burn 24hours * 6/h * 12,5btc * 10000 usd = 18M dollars/day just to maintain same price as yesterday... Then you know that today price is just too high. Maybe about 8-9k is right one. Now you buy it for too much...

Watch this carefully. If fees go up as we approach $10,000; it‚Äôs not sustainable. 
SELL SELL SELL!!! - it is going to crash to one dollar!

Hi again, r/Bitcoin! This is the last chance to fill in the quarterly reddit cryptocurrency survey. (yes that means no more seeing this post in the daily every couple of days!) The survey where every 3 months I collect responses from the reddit crypto community to see how the community has changed since the last few surveys.

**If you would like to fill in the survey, you can do that [here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfhkUsvWO4xAHnXQ1kjOl9tvmubEw_NquQNb3gwCMQN7LJLVA/viewform?usp=sf_link)**

For those of you who haven't seen the results to my previous survey, you can see that [here.] (https://redd.it/848snp)

Live results of the new survey here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xhw-pnaJrYZ_zizH46Sxz6hoccY4vfTstzz_MZ2ekaM/edit?usp=sharing

Thanks for your time!
Roughly 1,800 BTCs more to be sold before it hits $10k on bitfinex.
Hello fellow holders, how much BTC are you holdin' rn?
Bitcoin won't go above the 200 DMA until the death cross is reversed. Bet.
