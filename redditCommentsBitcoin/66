Daily Discussion, March 20, 2018
Everyone needs to be on the lookout for shady clickbait "news" domains! Just because you see a submission that makes you think "This is good for Bitcoin" doesn't mean you should blindly upvote it. Some headlines are only written to drive traffic to their site for a little ad revenue and affiliate marketing. *Rarely* are these sites actually offering exclusive, well-researched news. 

Please report clickbait domains and consider warning others in the comments so they don't end up being blindly voted onto the front page.
I just bought 1 BTC!!!! To the mooooon!!!!
Come on all over the World, lets get Bitcoin back to where it belongs.  Over $15k 
Bull run incoming
the bulls are putting up a fight
Hey guys have you ever seen that episode of Dragon Ball Z and Goku's power level is really high and Vegeta measures it and he says "it's over 9000" and then Nappa says "what that's impossible?"

It's a really cool episode and reminds me of what is currently going on with the price of bitcoin. Of course the price does fluctuate and so it may go above or below 9000 again at any time but for the time being the price of bitcoin is similar to the situation of that episode of Dragon Ball Z.
Please letâ€™s fucking hope this isnt another pump and dump. Please just crack 9k and be on our way from here. As much as i love to trade the swings and buy cheap coins im bored with this bullshit. I need a new ATH to quench my thirst. 
IT'S OVER 9000!!!!!!!!!!!
Everything looks great! Confirming the bottom of the channel sets up extremely bullish long-term projections. Only short-term projections show bearish performance. The vast majority of Bitcoin's history indicates dramatic returns if you buy using a DCA strategy in periods like this.

It is surely going to $10k at this rate
Good day to you all. 
No trade volume then $250 jump in two minutes.
Over $9,000!!!!!!!
Uncertain situation. We keep bouncing on the mid-term resistance, we failed 3 times to get past SMA200 and EMA200 and the death cross is getting closer. And yet the 48h trend is bullish. Bitcoin, Y U SO incomprehensible.

**$9K Ahead? Bitcoin Looks North After Bull Breakout**

https://www.coindesk.com/9k-ahead-bitcoin-looks-north-after-bull-breakout/
More time and thought has been put against bitcoin by Banks, Google, and Facebook, than time and thought about fixing the school shootings. 
Nows the time to break through 9k guys, lets get this shit done
It's going up boys
So how does one get started with bitcoin these days? I used to have some 3 or 4 years ago, but not anymore.

What's a decent secure wallet for small transactions? What's a decent exchange? My plan is to invest some of my savings, but small ammounts of 20â‚¬ here and there over periods of time.

I've googled these things but the information is all over the place, I don't know what source to trust. I am fully aware of the risks and don't intend to invest more than I can afford to lose. Cheers :)
We gonna break the 10k mark again! We need to have a good volume to create a huge support point.
We goin up, next stop 10300
Get the memes ready
Woot wooot woooot !!!!!
the fomo hitting me real hard right now guys...
Be on the lookout for these key resistance points:
$9,200 if we break it look for the $9,800 resistance and if we break that as well next point of resistance will be $11,200.
Where the Vegeta memes at 
N O S T R A D A M U S just fomo'd back in

If we get over 9450 and hold we can avoid a death cross on the daily
8500$ is quite hard to pass and hold right now. 
The price has been roughly around the $8500 mark for the last 36 hours. It's like a pregnant pause of traders wondering if it's going to turn bullish on the path to ATH, or down? If nothing happens within the next 12 hours I think the whales and day traders will be doing a little dumping in time for the next round of pumping.
Good night all. Looks like BTC is stalled. For the last two nights my sell Stop Order has been triggered due to dips of $300 or more. I hope it doesn't happen tonight as it will be for a loss. I'm afraid to go to bed without once because I would likely wake up with it at $6K. 

Anyway, good luck to everyone. Hopefully the volume picks up. Good night!
Breaking out of ascending triangle on the hourly chart .... initial target 9000 .... Asia! Lets see some buying over there!
Apparently [my ass](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/85rir4/daily_discussion_march_20_2018/dvzljs2/) is a reliable source.
Pump ?
If I use Shift card(Bitcoin Debit card), am I going to pay capital gains tax on every purchase?

Did anyone use this last year? How did you do taxes?
breakout breakout!!
Ready the 9k meme cannons!
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5ve17r/best_moon_gif_ever/

MOON!
9000!

That wall got eaten so fast
Boom. $9000. 
$9000 feels so damn comfy its good to be back here. 

This is big. We couldâ€™ve easily fallen farther to 6k from where we were sunday. Kinda shocked we didnâ€™t tbh. 

Still not totally out of the woods as this could get dumped any minute but I think $9000 is significant enough to push towards $12k again. 
FOMO setting in right about now - Iâ€™m waiting for that guac though.
Vegeta it is $9k.
[More Than a Feeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSR6ZzjDZ94)
Is there an app that can wake me up when it hits 10k?
Went to vegas and busted... Bitcoin you're my only hope...


**Past $9k again!** 
print 300m tether, then puuump it

This will invariably get downvoted, but (good news notwithstanding) I donâ€™t know why more of you guys arenâ€™t skeptical about a near-$2k rise in 48 hours, especially given the bearish trends/sentiment that was so pervasive over the weekend. 
Dont panic if it dips again as people take profit. Theres many traders who bought Sunday and just made close to $2000 per coin in less than 48hrs
Just buy and pump this shit.
Is anyone else concerned that there isn't an ascii version of star wars on the Bitcoin blockchain?  How can it be the currency of the internet if there isn't an ascii version of star wars on the Bitcoin blockchain?
We're only going to knock nicely on the door of $9000 so many times. We're either going to turn away or kick down the fucking door.  
Massive green whaledick incoming. 
If someone would buy $88m of BTC (approx. 7600 BTC) on GDAX, the price would increase to $15.2k.
Dafuq?!?!?
I'm so happy! 2 pumps in a row \o/
We moon now?
btc cross 8800 support level seems we can see bull run soon

Nearly there! 
**GO ON MY SON!** 
$9,000 baby!
Vegetime !!!
tightly hold guys.........
At times like these, it is important to remember that Bitcoin is still a volatile asset. It is rising at an alarming rate and it won't last. Be responsible with your investments and do not bulk buy, a sell off can happen any time. Our goal here is for a stable rise in value, it is unrealistic to think Bitcoin will go on another parabola. Invest responsibly!
Any good documents, links, vids I can use to shoot down FUD from people would be great. 
Where is a strong resistance level right now? Everything looks bullish,,,but even more so like a bull trap.
I donâ€™t think I could look at any more insight, or charts and have any idea where this goes... however, the charts look exactly like the ones from dot com era abs the nasdaq...  just saying.  I hope it goes to 30k by December. But every man for themselves.

Pls sell, I want to see how 1$=1BTC looks like
I have funds pending in my Coinbase account. I hope the price doesnâ€™t shoot up before I get a chance to buy. Then again, I donâ€™t know if I should wait longer to see if it goes down again. What to do, what to do...
fomo bought a bit lol. hopefully it doesn't bite me.
Man if that little jerk dumps more Gox coins into the market......

THEY ALL GUN GET BOUGHT
Not saying I know for sure this is the turnaround, but if it is, let's remember the lessons we all took from this bear. Think about how you felt when the price rose in December and when it tanked after and let's take that as a reminder not to allow our emotions to drive bad decisions. 
Umm Bitcoin where are you going? 9k is the other way.

At any rate [these three big guys](https://www.tradingview.com/x/PEKzZ76T/) are more than enough for now, after two hellish weeks a strong bullish signal is more than we could hope for.
N O S T R A D A M U S
OMFG, 40 BTC buywall at 8939. Jesus.
I've been using *Coinbase* for my dabbling with Bitcoin daytrading. I have found that whatever the price is on Bitcointicker.co, Coinbase's price is approximately $130 less. Is this because Bitcointicker's price is a cumulative value of different exchanges or because Coinbase's listed value of Bitcoin is bad?  I once sold a small amount, then bought back when it was $300 cheaper and I broke slightly better than even.

I am going to try *GDAX* but need a second ID.

So where are the other reports about G20? Kinda quiet?

How come Coinbase haven't implemented Segwit yet? 
What is moving the price higher today? I've looked through the thread and the news, no big bullish news stands out.
$300 million in Tether tokens printed? Yeah...I don't see Bitcoin crashing back down anytime soon. And no, I don't think it's a ponzi that'll crash anytime soon either. Given the rumors and circumstantial evidence that keeps piling up, I think the Tethers are backed. What's NOT backed is the grounds for engaging in wash trading and price manipulation. But it is what it is, crypto wild west be damned.
A G20 meeting happened, results were decent for bitcoin. that's the price uptick today.

google "bitcoin g20"
some pumping guys, crossing 9K now ..... hold tight....
Damn, I wish I bought more dip.
well, the end doesn't look so bad,
Don't believe all the articles you guys read online about Bitcoin. All these people saying Bitcoin is going to ZERO but for example this article at Forbes "Bitcoin's Bubble Is Bursting. How Low Will Prices Fall?" was written by and old lady whose probably never even held a Bitcoin or used the technology! FRAUDS!!

Stay strong guys, when this is back over 20K we will be all laughing at their ignorance :))
I don't think there is any real way to time a bottom, I feel like you just need to be IN. At the end of the day if you didn't participate then no one wants to here your FOMO stories.
Is there an app I can load on my droid that allows me to set triggers (audio alarms) that would let me know when a particular coin hit the price I set the trigger? For example...I have coin on letssay Binance and I don't want to have to watch Binance on the computer or my phone. I also don't want to set a sell stop order on Binance. I want to be able to log into Binance after the alarm sounds on the hand held and trade in real time; logged into Binance on a computer afterward. Please don't mind telling me if this is a stupid question. Just be cool. Thanks

Question about IDEX. looks like it withdraws(send coin) back to the address that made the deposit. Is that correct?
Whatâ€™s a trustworthy trading app? I was going to start with coinbase but looking at past posts about it, it doesnâ€™t seem very liked. 
Quick questions

1. Does Bitcoin have to be decoupled from the rest of the market?
2. If the above scenario does happen, does it lose it's value?
3. With LN Implementations will that bring BTC back to peer to peer currency status? (Minimization of fees, rather, almost no fees and lightning speeds?
4. What other things does BTC have going for it in the long term that helps to keep its long term HODL status?

Thanks yall.

Is there a major bank that is crypto-friendly ? 
I live in an EU country and IntesaSanPaolo bank just closed my bank account without any reason (an employee there told me unofficially they are closing all accounts related to crypto . My transaction were pretty small.
Cryptocurrency is important but blockchain technology is where the money is, as its the technology of the future. I found this interesting article that talks about studying blockchain technology, with Andreas Antonopoulos, check it out http://crypto101.org.uk/2018/03/20/study-digital-currency-with-andreas-antonopoulos/
Good morning everyone, lets get way past $9k today :)

Looks like point 1 of the Elliot wave is hit. Pretty optimistic the next 3 or 4 days are going to be big!
My guess, goes back to 8K bounces back to 9K only to see 5-6K. SMH
Volume is too low, The average Joe hard workers are still not buying...I wouldnt be suprised to see 7's soon
Anyone worried about the story that has just come out about bitcoin having child abuse images embedded in its block chain, meaning it may be illegal in most countries 4 miners and people running full nodes to download it. Maybe hostile government's won't even need to ban it it will already be illegal.
Good morning my Bitcoins Brother from a different mother and hopefully different father also...

Price seems to be testing the Nostradamus prediction. Mystic forces of darkness and cold hard calculation and research collide. Downvote at your peril.

My technical analysis: nice to see this floor hit the ceiling in the rebound from the reversal back down from the top.  Acquire to sell but keep hodl'ing.
People have sorted out their taxes and are now putting in as much as they can. 
The fomo is really kicking in to gear now. The whales love it because they will dump in to it.
Looks like the death cross point has arrived. Does this mean it will definitely go down?

DONT BUY THE PUMP ITS A BEAR TRAP

So is everyone who mentions anything about CP being in the blockchain  going to get downvoted into oblivion.  Sorry guys it's truly over now. We will never get mainstream adoption thanks  to this news. The pump is simply whales milking their final profits from you guys.
Is that another $300m tether just got printed? 
To bring everyone up to speed that are just now waking up in North America, the East seems to be asleep today. Volume is very low. I have no idea what the cause of this is, but it sucks. I was hoping Europe waking up would correct this, but it seems they haven't showed up today. Did everyone buy what they wanted yesterday?
