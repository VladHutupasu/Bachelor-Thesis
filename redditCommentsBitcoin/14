Who else is hodling despite the dump on the weekend? Raise your hand -_-/
I mined 100BTC back in the day because I was a nerd and it was cool. 

It was 50BTC after a few days, then another 50BTC after 3 more weeks. It wasn't worth it at the time, and it was only worth a few dollars.

I wiped the drive, and I no longer have the computer...

Damnit.
I find Buffet and Munger calling it scumball activity particularly offensive in that it‚Äôs pointed not towards the technology itself but directly to it‚Äôs users. Like countless others I use it for buying on Newegg and Overstock, I trade it regularly for investing in other assets, and firmly believe in it‚Äôs potential. Am I therefore entitled to be insulted by someone who invested in companies like Monsanto or Procter&Gamble? How do you call activity like investing in companies who have no sense of moral or ethical values?
Here we are now. Hung up at the Macafee dick line again.
There is no SEC meeting today, Its just the wall street journal spreading fud   https://www.msn.com/en-us/finance/news/ethereum-price-takes-a-knock-ahead-of-rumored-us-regulators-meeting/ar-AAwT5yi
when i was at school in the uk, i used to do payed surveys online & PPC. done it for about 3 months ended up wit ¬£12 and 3.1(ish) bitcoin never bothered transferring the bitcoin out the account. used to get like 0.05 BTC per survey etc.


If the price drops below the dickline, all hell will break loose. https://dickline.info/ 

I am100% certain of my prediction because of my fool proof dickline based technical analysis system.
I heard there is no SEC meeting today. Actually I also didnt find any such official statement. 
Is it a FUD?
So with the revelation that the alleged SEC meeting today is fake news, can we all relax a bit?     I‚Äôd like to get the balloon üéà ready for our upcoming weekend voyage to 10k. 
The elevator is going *up*!
Gdax charts looking good. Up we go 
I have respect for Warren Buffet, but he really shouldn't comment about a technology he doesn't fully understand. His two cents easily sway a large number of people who buy or sell based on his personal opinion. He already [admitted](http://fortune.com/2018/05/06/why-warren-buffet-was-wrong-about-google-amazon/) that he was wrong about Amazon and Google.
morning everyoneÔºÅ

Hi I'm Greg, and I'm a **HODLoholic.**

We're good! Come on back guys.

Alrighty friends, let's do some live Bitcoin Analysis! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqHCk4JBzCU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqHCk4JBzCU)
Almost 1 million to sell in 9400$ \(Bitstamp\). A big wall, where is the zombie dragon when is needed?
I have a theory. Big investors know that 10k+ means fomo from the small time investors and therefore will continue to dump and accumulate in the 8-10k region until it‚Äôs squeezed dry then we will see a new high 
Will we dump under 9000 ?
I've only been invested with Bitcoin now for about a week, so this is my first major dip. I didn't panic sell, I've all but got the panic screams under control. Onwards and upwards!
Bill Gates: "As an asset class, you're not producing anything and so you shouldn't expect it to go up. It's kind of a pure 'greater fool theory' type of investment," Gates said. "I would short it if there was an easy way to do it."

Wow, gates knows so much about bitcoin! He doesn't even realize you can short it on CBOE.


I'm looking for any opinions on what effect the BTC wealth distribution might have on the markets should BTC reach anything like what is predicted (say US$50k +). I think this wealth distribution is the elephant in the room myself, but would like to hear any opinion on the matter. Any links to known articles discussing this would be appreciated.

I prayed there would be a pullback before my fiat cleared and here it is :') stock up people!
**Keep going Bulls!**
Even the government knows that it was the beginning of the futures that had the biggest impact on The 70% fall in Dec 17'.       https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/07/launch-of-bitcoin-futures-dragged-down-prices-fed-paper-shows.html
...btc rising from the ashes :) 
Buffet and Gates are some of the biggest Frauds and liars in history.  I wouldn't be concerned about their opinions on Bitcoin.  The SEC meeting is way more relevant
$9k memes ready to go!
So what do we think will still be around in 5 years, Bitcoin or that breathing corpse Charlie Munger? What a complete joke of a human being. 

Warren Buffett is the real satoshi...
Eff is everyone?
