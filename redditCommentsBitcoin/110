HODLed through the whole dip but sold when I started losing money around 6k. I am literally the worst investor in the history of investing maybe ever.

for those that dont plan on selling anyway... why stare at the charts and give yourself high blood pressure? :)
forbes just put crypto on its cover--positive coverage

Headlines after dip: "Bubble burst, BTC dead, gg, experts say."

Headlines after boost: "BTC to reach 100k by end of 2018, experts say."

What in the fuck. 
Right NYC, we've done our part in London...

The Bitcoin Hate-Brigade in the office has been strangely quiet these past two days. I wonder why? :D
Here we go.It's your turn USA we did our job already
Jesus Christ like, some people are really, really phased by 100-200 USD price movements. Pipen down will ya, ya bollox
What the hell is going on? Everyone told me bitcoin was going to 500. Glad I hodl
 If history repeats itself, I feel another dip coming after it reaches a plateau. But what do I know lol it’s BTC....
I wouldn't mind this run slowing down a little. Slow and steady wins the race.
Last night I finally had a good night, after several nights looking at the charts in my phone until 5am . I just wanted to share my story, thanks.
Everyone picture a giant 9 in the minds for 10 seconds 
I went to bed last night convinced it was another bull trap., and we'd be at 6k., and eventually all the way back down to 2k.  and two year bear market. Crypto dead., etc.  Sitting in bed this morning afraid to get up and check price.  Im blown away, this is the most amazing thing to see.  Mother F-ing YEA!  Congrats to all the HOLDERS!
Could see 12k today LOL
I don’t know about u guys but I kinda like this 8k support for now, slow and steady. We are going to need vegeta for 9k support though
I think the very positive meeting yesterday is finally sinking in with a lot of people that now realise that Bitcoin is here to stay for a very long time. 
Come on Robinhood. Get in the fight. Open your exchange!
So there are 95 k banks in USA, after including the energy demands of armored transport, employees vehicles, heating, cooling, and electric,  doesn't it seem to be it is possible that bitcoin could possibly use less energy than fiat banking system?
Good video worth watching folks...

Bitcoin drops from 7.5k to 6k in a day, and it is the end of the world, end of bitcoin, we are all deluded and going to lose our money.

Bitcoin rises from 6k to 8.2k in a day...

RADIO FUCKING SILENCE.
Get Vegeta memes ready for 5pm-ish GMT.

You heard it here first.
Can anyone confirm that this is a suitable method to calculate bitcoins historical volatility on excel for January 18.

First get the closing prices from each day in January,

Then calculate Ln(P/p-1) for each,

Then calculate standard deviation for all the days and multiply this by the square root of 30 (number of returns).

Watching that 8200, 159 BTC wall go down on Binance in 15 seconds was beautiful
Any South Koreans here?  Are they still buying Bitcoin? 
i know that buy high and sell low is cool, but remember that the idea is buy low and sell high.
Good holding gents. What's the best site to track trade volume?
Very positive news guys. They also want a piece of the cake.

Anyone else see Bitcoin as Gold Version 2, Digital Gold?
Y'all are acting like it's the end of the world. You thought Bitcoin would just continue to rise without dips and people taking profits along the way? Seriously we just came from the depths let's celebrate that rather than worry why we aren't at 10k already

LOL @ all the idiots selling off in the middle of a huge upswing
the fomo will hit hard tonight when USA wakes up. To think of how I was hodling yesterday and almost told Jesus to take the wheel @6k
Guys is this a confirmed bull run now?  Should I spend my last wad on bitcoin, or hold it just in case?

Troll question: I've been on vacation for a week and I check and BTC Is down 15%
Yet everyone here is super hype on it
this 8k wall holding on for dear life
Higher highs and higher lows off of the $8k support.
passed out bull bounce?
The current exchange value trend for BTC on GDAX seems to be mirroring the equities markets. At 12:00 EST the equities markets started to turn south, and over the next 45 minutes so did BTC. I believe that the synchronous action in both crypto and equities markets over the last few days is continuing. I don't have a lot of data to work from, but I think overall investor sentiment may be having an unusual influence on the BTC exchange value, rather than a specific concern re Bitcoin.
how delayed is my exchange?, still show a green candle.


damn son, dat 250BTC buy wall on binance
Can we get another CFTC Giancarlo hearing set up for tomorrow?
If OKEx's volume turns out among the top in the next few days(like on Feb 5th), we can be sure it's some greedy Chinese whales in action spreading fake FUD again.  They got caught this time:

When you panic sell at 6,600 and Bitcoin goes up 30%.....

eating those sell walls like cake
Look at the chart.

Rebound, small recovers like this is a normal situation in this long downtrend movement (in fact it is normal for any trend)

For now nothing big happens.

We could see a new way down in some time...

You are panicking and crying and see the end of the world when it goes down 
(Dammit I should sell before it fall down to 0)
and do the same when it goes up ( Dammit I should buy before it is skyrocketing right now)

Take it easy ladies. Loosen your seatbelts if You want to take a long ride with this market

A wise monk once told me, " Quickest way to lose your bitcoin is to sell your bitcoin"

Wise words from a wise monk
 
Bitcoin 0.15.2 has been 100% complete on Github for a while now. What is the process to push an update? How is it decided to go to the next version?
I know, but yesterday in the morning Bitcoin was traded around $5800ish, it’s clearly a bounce back.. fingers crossed for the $10k soon 
Hmm, finally have to be carefull now.
Edit ; I sold, out of the wave atm.Stay safe.
Like i said before, rewind to last week.  We've seen this before times and times again, it'll rebound like its gonna do something great, then the bots swoop in and tank the shit out of it.  Im skeptical, still holding, still accumulating btc here and there..
ok let's try it again
A nice and steady rise is what we want ideally.  Like $1000 rise every 2 or 3 days for a few months :) 
[Deep "ravine" in BTC price has historically signaled the beginning of the end of a slump.](https://imgur.com/a/ililg) Some time (~ a week) after ravine, price has stabilized or turned upward.
Bouncing back now... :/
There is the 4.30pm European sell off. Like clockwork every day.

Great. We're practically right back where we started this morning. 

However, good news for anyone who missed the take-off this morning and wanted to buy in. Here's your second chance, guys.
Simba, remember, the ones who are telling you to sell are the ones that have already sold earlier than you...Remember who you are... remember...
What would happen if we crowdfunded a campaign popularising bitcoin? Magazine / TV adverts etc full page ad explaining in layman’s terms why it’s the future and how to get involved. Does popularity and awareness = demand? 
What I think is happening is traders are buying at bitcoin’s 200 mma, which is around 7600-7800, and then normies are buying over it because they think it’s going up. Traders also probably caused the dip to 7600, where they will buy again
One minute its at 8050 next its at 8000 never watched the charts this close its a fucking addicting stressful kick
Long as we hold Above $7200 we should be fine over night 
WHO JUST CASHED IN FROM 7600 T0 8K??
I expect memes when i wake up tomorrow
The bitcoin is Weeeeee!

I want to try day trade, basically I’m about to sell so the price is definitely about to skyrocket so keep hodling fam I’m taking one for the team.
It's already Feb 8th in 90% of the world including Eastern US / South America and we're still commenting on 7th Febs daily thread... #salty
hello 8k :)
So.. when is it going to 5k?

Haha.

Dream on #nocoiners 
Told ya, 6k was bottom and now we are reversing. It wasn’t a crash, it was a gap fill back to 6k. We spiked wayyyy to quickly to 20k in too quick of time. Look at the climb from 1-6/7k. Took months and there was steady climbing that built support as there were tons of transactions and buyers at each level unlike from 10-19k. Now that we filled the gap we will climb back to previous levels and reach new highs. Meanwhile all the people who have no idea who stocks or crypto work got out and/or got burned for being unknowledgeable and we rise. See ya again at 20k+
Buckle up spacemen, we're going to the asteroid belt!
starting to look like buying at 6.5 was the right move
When it was at 6k yesterday people were only going to buy when it went lower. Today when it's past 8k people are swearing they will buy at 6k. These people need to be taken to the back and shot once and then shot again for good measure. 
bitcoin has tought me that markets are 100% psychology. you can have the best product. but doesn't matter.
I just pre-ordered a ledger nano s!
Just want to keep my coins safe while I hodl. Can't trust exchanges anymore.
More traders getting fucked as we speak.

I'm enjoying this so bad
Is no one concerned with Tether anymore? Particularly given the news about the euro tether details from today?
is there still chance for bitcoin to drop its price , go below 7000$ and any update in binance? iT HAS BEEN DOWN FOR SEVERAL HOURS
where are all those guys who were yelling btc is dead over last 2 3 days? Where are you now? Still feeling the same or feeling FOMO and buying at higher costs? 
BTC wont die. What do you thing what would be the curreny over Mars and Moon? USD!! Thats gonna be crypto my friends
So at the end of the day HODL is the answer to life, the universe and everything.
LET'S HUNT SOME BEARS, SHALL WE?

Are we stuck at 8500??
Be careful now
Well, after kicking myself over and over again for laughing at my friends who bought 2 years ago, and making my apologies since lol, is anyone buying in/more at $8200?

great, my exchange instead of lowering the price just got more expensive.
Time for shorting. They make money, relax. Its continue more than month
Bot manipulation market ? On GDAX I see large walls dropping and disappearing to create a down trend.
A little bit lower and I'm buying moar!!!

I absolutely love reddit.

So many excuses today for why this won't keep rising.

LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!
What will people say when it is, say 15k again?

What will the excuse be? Will you guys claim its dead still?
Noob question, how much interest do the exchanges pay on bitcoin in their wallets?

There are only a couple of options if you are playing around in Bitcoin!

You should be HODLing period, and not watching every day.
-or-
You should be HODLing AND taking advantage of the lower prices with extra cash you have set aside.

When the price is back up in the next few days, weeks or months, you will will look back on this week or so and say, "Why in the hell did I sell" or, "Why in the hell didn't I buy more".  Selling at the low is just stupid.

FOMO SHOULD goes BOTH ways.  When the price starts going up (buy buy buy) as well as Fear of Missing out on GREAT deals when the price i down (buy buy buy).

Bitcoin is not going away. 
too many false FUD = CCC (courage, certainty and confidence)
Warning, I just FOMOEDback in, nows probably a good time to sell! 
A wise man once told me...”watch out for the doji star”. 
on what basis is the price going to go up ? cannot see any upwards movement withoiut news. Expect another sell off this weekend. Only thing that puzzles me , is who is engaging in this down and then up game ? Who's selling knowing that it will bounce back up again, before going down again .
I’ve got fear again.
If it's another big dip, just do what Giancarlo's niece do. Hold On to Dear Life and buy more if you can.
I told you guys China still needs to sell before the complete ban. If China doesn't sell before the ban there is no way they can get their fiat currency back. There are people in China who are trying to emigrating out because of this ban.
I know Americans and Europe have been bullish lately but y'all gotta chill.
I got a hunch we'll scratch 9k at some point before morning
Don,t worry, soon time for shorting, gdax bots never sleep
Some reporters create intentional FUD. Like this one.https://ethereumworldnews.com/author/rebecca/
All her recent news article were negetive stance on every news that was related to crypto. Now also she is posting the India is 'taking steps' to make crypto illegal. Which is COMPLETELY FALSE. India is trying to make regulations on profits made on crypto, which doesnt make 'crypto illegal'. Is there a way were we can track down such FUD creators and dislike their news articles and push them aside?
Guys, please tell me, am I in a bull trap or am I rocketing to the moon?
My only regret is not buying more during the dip and holding out for $5K
Looking strong.

Needs to stay above $8k for the next couple days. If not it could test $5k again 
Boo hoo "I don't want to see 6k." Give me a fucking break. It's not magic, either everyone sells and it takes or we hold and it goes up. All you scared pussies are ruining the value.
Would really like to see 5,5 to 6k one more time and I'll load up big.

So what is Your idea of the next event that will have a big bullish impact on the price? I'm thinking something in the line: the financial crysis of 2018. Poeple getting out of stocks in panic, moving to ~~safe-heaven~~ assets like gold or bitcoin.
I have 2000€  i‘m willing to invest in crypto without being emotionally attached to it. I never invested before (I turned 18 yesterday). Any advice? Should I wait for the next drop of price that a lot of you are talking about?

Since bouncing from exactly 6000 (Bitfinex), the market has staged a 30% rally from the lows.
This is thus far the largest rally since the downtrend sell-off leg that started on 20-JAN-2018.

There were two bounces within the downtrend that began on 20-JAN-2018; i.e. as follows:

1.23-JAN-2018 to 28-JAN-2018: 22% bounce

2.02-FEB-2018 to 03-FEB-2018: 19% bounce

Given the current bounce from the 6000 lows has now exceeded the average 20% bounce size, it may suggest that the downtrend which began on 20-JAN-2018 is now complete; and by extension, it may suggest a completed wave structure which has ended the first leg of the crash.

The expectation would be a Primary degree b-wave bounce which may retrace up to 38.2% of the Primary a-wave decline which began on 06-JAN-2018.

However, there are previous levels of support which may serve as resistance as follows:

1.9350: approx previous line of support/resistance.

2.9946: 50% Fibonacci retracement level of entire market.

3.10298: 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the decline which began on 06-JAN-2018

Any one of the aforementioned levels may serve as targets for the bounce, with the average being 9865.
However, exuberance may propel towards the psychological 10000 given the proximity.

Elliott Wave Principle: Key to Market Behavior, Robert Prechter:

"b-waves — b-waves are phonies. They are sucker plays, bull traps, speculators' paradise, orgies of oddlotter mentality or expressions of dumb institutional complacency (or both). They often involve a focus on a narrow list of stocks, are often 'unconfirmed' by other averages, are rarely technically strong, and are virtually always doomed to complete retracement by c-wave. If the analyst can easily say to himself, 'there is something wrong with this market', chances are it's a b-wave."

Speculative and idealised Elliott Wave model indicative of price and structure, not time:

Fucking hell bitcoin is racking up value fast. As a new buyer I stuck £100 on. seeing the price rise so drastically, it's now £300 invested, with more ready to come on top.

Damn this has sky rocketed. Will it dip again?
What a massive dump, stupid bots, we want to believe!
A retracement to a higher low on a high-timescale chart would give me a good feeling about this. Even though we are above the breakout level, we still need a close above this level. Until then, my Lambo order is still on hold.
Seems to be strong resistance at 8100

Question for the Bitcoin Community - As part of my college course I am currently enrolled in a module much of which is centered around the history of bitcoin . I am completely new to the world Bitcoin and still finding my feat in terms of understanding everything so please go easy on my below post in terms of things that may be wrong or dont fit with your views on bitcoin . As part of the course we are currently looking at the difference between bitcoin and bitcoin cash - if you've a few minutes read the below and let me know whats right and wrong and what else I need to know about the split in the community in terms of parties working in both communities , issues and solutions to both parties ideas. 

I appreciate any feedback you could give. 

Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash
August 2017 we saw the creation of a hard fork from Bitcoin’s original blockchain ledger. The fork was created as a result of a debate that caused a split into the bitcoin community. The debate was centered around the issue of scalability in the bitcoin blockchain . The following outlines below what I believe to be the arguments presented by both users of Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash on how best to solve the scalability issue . Open to any corrections of details people may have on either sides arguments . 

The Issue of Scalability.

Under satoshis original whitepaper for Bitcoin we know that individual’s transactions are grouped together to form blocks. Each block has its own blockhash made up of four key components 
1)	The Hash of the previous block 
2)	A time stamp of the new block 
3)	The merkle tree root hash which is the method by which transaction are bundled together from the transaction slush pool  with the first transaction hash in the bunch being the coinbase of that bundle . 
4)	Nonce – This is the puzzle minors need to solve in order to complete the block . To solve the puzzle requires brut computing force so minors must expend computer processing power to find the value randomly that satisfies the puzzle. Upon finding the value the blocks hash is then complete and at this point the block is added to the blockchain .

When a block is added to the blockchain a miner ie the person whos cpu solved the nonce to create the block is rewarded in two ways – 1stly with the issue of newly minted bitcoin  and 2ndly with all the transaction fees that people wishing to send bitcoin transactions to attach to their transactions . 

The issue with scalability surrounding the blockchain prior to August 2017 was that each block could had a maximum blocksize of 1MB which allowed for roughly 250,000 transaction per day to be processed . The issue was that as more and more people began to use the Bitcoin network it began to run slower as users who were unwilling to pay higher fees had to wait longer for their transactions to be added from the slush to a block and confirmed . How to solve this issue of scalability in the blockchain is what ultimately lead to the forking of the blockchain in August 2017 and the creation of Bitcoin Cash .

Bitcoins solution to scalability – 
Bitcoins solution to its scalability issue include the creation of both Segregated Witness ( Segwit ) and lightning protocols. Segwit was introduced to increase the blockchain blocksize from 1mb to a maximum of 4mb with the current protocol allowing for blocks to be 2mbs in size . Segwit also allowed for the creation of layered networks on the bitcoin protocol that will ultimately lead into the adoption of the lightning network . 

The lightening network is a way in which payments can be chained together outside of the blockchain. It works by allowing participants to transactions interact only twice with the blockchain ledger , once to open and once to close a set of transaction . In-between the opening and closing participants enforce digital IOUs against one another with either party having the option to end the current transaction string of IOUs and cash out for the balancing amount . 

Bitcoin Cash’s Solution to scalability . 
Bitcoin Cash creators changed bitcoins protocol such that the block size was increased from 1Mb to 8MB thus allowing for more transactions to be confirmed in each block helping the network to run quicker . 

If you owned Bitcoin prior to August 1st 2017 you also own Bitcoin Cash ( I Think) . Because the chains forked I think so do the public and private key address in the underlying system which means if you sign into a wallet that supports bitcoin cash you’ll find some which at the time I wrote this was roughly 952 USD per coin . Is this correct? 

Thanks for all your feedback.
we'll climb to $9000 and people will still be convinced this is not a bull run lol
5-6K a dream now 
It's under 9000!!!!!!!!!!
fighting for 8k
3k then 300k
Hypothesis: BTC and the crypto markets are starting to align with the equities markets. We believe that this is because investors are still struggling to figure out how to handle this asset class and are defaulting to the same strategies they use for equities trading. We are paying close attention to the performance of the equities markets during each day (follow-the-sun) and are factoring those markets into our micro-trend analysis (dailies). For example, look at the Asian equities markets today and compare with the BTC trend at the moment. 

https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/stocks/world-indexes/asia-pacific
ITS OVER 8000!!!!!
Everyone needs to stop reacting so sharply to these trends. Everyone is trying to make money, but these fluctuations make Bitcoin unstable. Ironically, its being rejected and losing so much value because it fluctuates so much. You're not making money by day trading and you're not out smarting the swings. Only invest discretionary income. HOLD!!!
anyone else think we’re seeing a bulltrap? don’t think we’re out of the dip until we clear $13k
Its over $8000 now! To the Moon! :)
Waiting for 6.5$k to buy more
Double top formation has been formed, looks like we might go down from here.
Will yanks wake up and FOMO this to the moon?  
Just bought in a 8500, preparing to hodl long term....
Head and shoulders.
actually annoyed it's climbing right now. Started to skyrocket about 10 minutes before I was going to buy
Serious question; Is it possible to day trade bitcoin? 
See? What did i tell you guys?
just me or volume lower than yesterday?
The only reason it's not going above 8 is i havent sold my hodl position. as soon as i do itll go up. One could be convinced to be compensated for doing so. Any takers? ;)
is bitcoin going to the moon?
Daily pump in action :)
Who thinks it will dip to 5-6K? 
Not good.

This needs to hold $8k or we test $6k again in the next few days.
Holy FODL. Bitcoin broke support under $7800.

See you at $6,000 boys.
Bitcoin's fatal flaw. Put a gun to my head and you get all my net worth in a world that embraces bitcoin. Argue against this, otherwise bitcoin is through.
Low 6K please!!!!
Ups its happening its turned around going down again. Will it hit $5000?
I sold, see you later in next wave guys, be careful now....Stay safe.
lol, so many of you people need to be patient and have some foresight.
I obviously can't predict the future, but I've thought long and hard about bitcoin, and in my opinion, people will not adopt at these prices.  Therefore it's going to take an ugly crash for the wealth to be re-distributed.  Someone please feel free to remember this comment in 1 year.  I will eat a sock if I'm wrong and that the price is anywhere near $50k within 365 days.  
wow this is certainly a big bull trap
Who thinks it's going to dip again? How far?
anyone else want bitcoin to crash or are you all fully stocked?
Low 6K please!!!!
drop to 6k please 
while i can't predict the future, i will make a prediction based on my past experiences since the 1800 correction.  This will be the best time you will ever be able to accumulate bitcoin at these prices. 
expecting it to drop hard anytime... it cannot go this high and hold it's position.. it just doesn't work this way

Lets define a **World Bitcoin buy day!** Once a year on a given day, everybody in Bitcoin buys 100 Dollars/Euro worth of Bitcoin. Best price pump in the world!

Take your pick: 

* Black Friday?
* Chineese new year?  
* Other day?
Time for a bounce? (Revised)

https://redd.it/7vv9bd
here comes the drop
there we go.. breaking the 8k point, when some guys warned the people here that it's just a temporary bounce people started calling them FUDers and pesimists.. 
It's a temporary bounce amid a nasty downtrend, dont put your money in yet stay aside till a real uptrend comes. 
stop the brainless hype and fomo!!!!!  
SELLL AND BUY AT 6K
seems like the dead cat bounce over? 1k incoming

Some are thinking of the brutal awakening that will probably follow this rise.
I think they are right, but it can still grow a little today or tomorrow before it.
Dont be too confident, some predators are waiting in the dark to unleash their terrible sells ! Be safe and enjoy, atm it's decently rising ;)
$1m sell wall just was destroyed on Binance in less than one minute.  How sentiment can turn.....
Off to 8500. Should be over $10k within a week.
It just broke 8k on my chart.

Next stop? 7k?
Right back to the shit hole.
Vol went from 87K to 50K in 24 Hrs on GDAX
Why does everybody think bitcoin is an ever going up commodity, it might as well drop to 100 and never return.

I'm putting together 10-20 people to create a fund to short BTC. Who wants to join? We will just share the profits (2x-5x) if everything goes as planned. It's risky, but the upside is very good. Reply ASAP.
To the Moon! :D 
The chart can’t just go up and up
