I expect to start seeing some interesting things happen now that the majority of the US is headed back to the office...aka sitting at their desk dreaming of being a crypto millionaire.
"Ten years in, nobody has come up with a use for blockchain"

article making rounds freaking out people right now.
Where is the volume? Nobody trades Bitcoin anymore? On GDAX it just feels like it's just me swapping Bitcoin with my buddy down the street. 
Could someone tell me what may happen to the value of Bitcoin if there comes a time where there’s another recession? Won’t most people be looking to sell bitcoins for $/£/etc, since those currencies are more useful atm compared to bitcoin? Thanks 
Yo you trying to sticky this shit? It's not at the top of the sub
Would it be feasible or cheaper to exchange for foreign currency through Bitcoin instead of conventional method such as bank or money changer? 
Just had an eye opening read about Crypto general and ETH + BTC in detail.

Probl. one of the best Papers i ever read on the subject, try it out people and give the author some probs.

What's the best site for trading between alts?
Currently have 2,000 euros ready to buy with, was meant to do it a week ago but i've been having second thoughts.

Have a friend/mentor who studies charts and  he keeps saying its gonna bounce to 25k at some point, but bitcoin seems to be dropping? His words:

 "You're scared, it bounced off resistance and onto a high support
a higher support than last week
which was 11k
just be patient man"
Should i go for bitcoin or alt? need some advice
Thanks and Happy New Year

What do you think about BTC's value? Do you think that it will raise substantially within the next couple of months, as predicted, or do you think that it will continue to raise steadily? Furthermore, what do you believe would be better in the long-run - ETH or BTC? Last but not least, what is the best platform for altcoin trade? 
I want to sell as I am a bit tight for cash currently. I currently have my funds in my GBP wallet on coinbase and am struggling to figure out how to get the funds into my bank account. Any advice?
Have there been problems with coinbase over the last few weeks? I've got a buy with them pending from the 21st Dec. I've bought with them before and had no problems.

To make it worse it's literally impossible to contact their support. Their email address bounced back, their FAQs don't seem to mention any delays and their live chat bot thing is useless.

Any ideas?
Can someone explain how to read/understand a depth chart on gdax? 
Thank you Peter Thiel
15k we made itt!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Hi, I created addon for Firefox and Chrome for crypto prices on Binance. Pairs with BTC, ETC, BNB and USD calculated from BTC.

I would be happy if you people would give it a try :)

Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/crypto-prices-binance/hjldnpiclhlaomebmfifoffocgabipje
Please help, Coinbase lost transfer on 12/12 (self.Bitcoin)

Throwaway for obvious reasons. Please help me get my money back. I've opened a support ticket, I've emailed support+reddit@coinbase.com. If anyone from Coinbase is reading this, Case ID: 1653972.

I did an overnight transfer of €100.00 to Coinbase on 11/12. The amount was never credited to my account so I opened a support ticket. They got back to me only with generic mails. 

I sent the info over to Coinbase support and never heard back.

I understand that their support team must be swamped with requests right now, but this is ridiculous. I don't know what to do. How to get their attention. 
Alright fellas help a newby out, i have around 1k in coinbase and i want to begin to transfer my money to either an online wallet or cold storage, what are some good options and how do i go about using them?
Is any off You guys experience any BTC withdrawn problems from Bittrex??
I don't understand what the transaction fees are or how they work. How is it that I can send Bitcoin from Bitstamp to Binance for free? I often read about there supposedly being a Bitcoin transaction fee of upwards of $20.
I still need more people to participate in the cryptocurrency survey

please take a few minutes to fill out (completely anonymous)

Calling it right now, huge slump in bitcoin price in February for college kids cashing out a portion to enjoy spring break. 
[This could cause a surge in BTC or could go the other way around](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/02/e-trade-begins-cme-bitcoin-trading-as-of-tuesday-evening.html?__source=facebook%7Ccrypto) 

Either way, I can’t wait to see what happens on the next episode of this wild ride!!!! :)
Riding this to the moon! See you on the other side HODL'rs!
I wish I had never invested in this. I bought in at 17k and it looks like I'll never break even at this point. fuck my life.
Bitcoin has been flat a few weeks now... time to hold less bitcoin and diversify more to alt coin s?
I give alt season another week.
Bitcoin newbie here, I send some Bitcoin but it never arrived. What did I do wrong?
