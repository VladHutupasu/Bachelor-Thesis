I just panic bought 0.2 BTC
the robinhood pump
I made a bitcoin shirt as a joke while all my coworkers poke fun at me for investing with the price volatility. Hodl on tight!

Will it be possible to fund multiple Lightning channels with one batched main chain transaction?
Kinda funny watching the sell walls disappear for a second and bitcoin shooting up only to suddenly be held down again. It's like trying to hold a balloon under water.
**China unbans Bitcoin! (Time to panic-buy!)**

Cryptocurrencies will test hard how much personal freedom is there in the world. Country by country.
So Bitcoin is one of the biggest bubble in history, but effect in global economy is almost zero?.

Yeah...
Okay, so looks like Bitcoin's taking a 2nd stab at another run. Let's see if it sustains. 
The "normal" fee when sending BTC from Blockchain is now $0,28 (11 sat). Priority fee is $5,67 (222 sat).
Gamble of the day... Futures expire tomorrow, how many people are going to cash out hoping to catch the dip, and how many are going to close their eyes not look at the charts for 24 hours? 

Im a fan of day trading, but with the speed LN is growing it feels like a risky move and could be out of pocket 
South Korea allows crypto put that money out :)
I am like those skeletons behind computers waiting for Bitcoin to reach $12k (at least). Still waiting...!!!
what happens to bitcoin when the US financial market crashes? To me it would make since that it would go up but I have seen other say the opposite. 
How will the contract expiring effect bitcoin prices?
whales whales are acting up sank to 10,800
wouldn't be surprised if the futures are a non-event.  Then maybe it pumps on Sunday.  Or we continue sideways until Super Bowl.  And then there is some Ad on tv and everybody freaks out.  
Huge spike at the moment on GDAX!
I'm hacking on a cool Bitcoin widget for Android as a hobby project (no ads or so), hopefully someone will find it useful here. It updates itself every 15 minutes during your active hours, so it doesn't drain your battery. I just updated it with some stuff that got suggested by fellow redditors last week.

If you'd like to try it and leave some feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.paramsen.bitcointools - please drop a comment or a review if you got any suggestions, cheers me up to see your reactions.

I got my first ~50 users from Reddit last week that tried it out, and 80% of them are still using the app, so I believe they like it.

Another site deployed Segwit now. Not sure which one, but the deployed number was 18 yesterday:
https://bitcoincore.org/en/segwit_adoption/
I went through the wiki and a few others websites and Bitcoin really don't seem as complicated as I thought they were.

Pretty much the ways people are making money off of the Blockchain technology is by

Mining

ICO's and Projects (very broad)

Using altcoins' utilities

And buying and holding/trading?

For someone hoping to get into crypto, I think this makes it a lot simpler. I'd appreciate it if someone could let me know if I missed something.
again market is falling any bad news guys 
I've just finished writing my thesis on Bitcoin and price predictions. I am a 43 year old with a PHD in mathematics and applied sciences and have been studying stocks and data analysis for 25 years. My BTC prediction is that the price will likely rise with a probability of say 50% and we could see a dip at a estimated 50% probability. I think with the CME futures ending tomorrow we might see the price go up and then go down followed by up and down movements which result in the  price changing every few seconds. 
How long do you think we will be stuck in Limbo (<19k)? 

When I was asked in late December what I thought the average January price would be and I said “11k”, a lot of people chastised me! IRL & in multiple crypto reddits. They were easily triggered.

This is slightly a low effort shitpost comment so feel free to remove it but HOLY SHIT GUYS LN IS SO FUCKING COOL OH MY GOD. I've spent all morning reading about how it works and just DAMN. I'm so impressed by the ingenuity of the cryptocommunity.
Robinhood just announced they will be doing no fee bitcoin trading. What does this mean for bitcoin?

Edit- they will be offering free trades for about 16 different cryptos
Shit is getting so fucking old at this point 
Amateur Miners : Feedback requested. 

Over the past few months at least I have seen the rise in people becoming "Bitcoin Miners". Facebook groups, Telegram groups etc all popping up for people to 

A: Post pictures of their Rigs
B: Ask questions about hashrates
C: "Having had my rig running for a couple of days I’m now starting to think about wallet solutions"

I think its good to have questions about hashrates, overclocking etc, my worry is that there are so many people getting involved in mining that have no idea what they are actually doing. Is this a good thing? 

I've run a bunch of surveys on these groups, asking if they knew what they were doing - like do they know what the roles of the miner is on the network etc and its a pretty clear no, the majority has no idea what they are doing. 

Is it too small and insignificant thing to be worried about? Would like to hear other peoples views on the matter.  
Got a quick question. I recently stumbled on my bitcoin wallet I made in 2014. I forgot my password though, is there any way to check to see if I have anything in the wallet? It was set up on block chain. I went to the site and don’t know my “phrase” so either I’m going to have to sit down for a while and try multiple passwords, or just forget about it. Any ideas? 
Ive never used Localbitcoins service & was wondering if its legit? I know its listed on the FAQs and it probably wouldnt be if there were alot of issues surrounding it, but could y'all shed some light on that experience (for those who have used it) or why its not a good idea? Is the online option better than meeting in person? Thanks
Is Lightning useful for the Darknet Markets?
How many business days have people typically waited for their money when withdrawing from GDAX? They say 3-5 but sometimes longer. I'd be moving the funds to Chase if that helps.
Please someone HODL me... So cold and scared.
Did those involved in BTC back in 2010-2013 obsessively check exchange values or is this more of a recent thing?
So I'm sorta freakin' out...

Sold $21k worth of bitcoin in mid December, $10k in early Jan, and $5k worth of eth in mid Jan, totalling $36k.

I'm in contract to buy a home in mid April, with a mortgage committment deadline of March 1. Applying for the loan next week and realized I'm probably quite fucked as none of the crypto proceeds are seasoned, and I'm not sure how to go about sourcing it when the line of questioning inevitably comes up. 

Does anyone have any experience with using crypto proceeds for loan approval?
I'd rather it just went up $1 a day than bouncing around like a freaked out beach ball.. it's doing my head in.
If you didnt believe that prices will fucking rocket after Feb...eat shit! I am certain of it now with Robinhood joining in. Better buy now!

Once you've opened a lightning channel - what happens if you run out of funds? Does that channel close and you need to reopen a new one?

Is there any way of topping up an already existing channel without having to make another main transaction on the blockchain (I'm assuming the answer is no).
Stop selling your BTC for cheap
Anyone looking to join Robinhood? We'll both get a free stock and also move up on the early signup list for cryptocurrencies. DM me for the referral link!
Let me tell you something son, everyone want 8k. 8k ain’t happening. 

8k is apparently as obvious at the flippening was. Long as hell.
What time do futures end tomorrow? Anyone know

So I just read this article (https://blog.bitmex.com/the-lightning-network/) which says that once the Lightning Network is up and running, the person receiving bitcoin in a transaction will have to be online to "sign" and receive the payment.

I currently have a website with my bitcoin public address from my paper wallet listed at the bottom of the page for visitors who would like to donate. 

Since this is cold storage and not online, does that mean  people will not be able to donate once the Lightning Network is up? Or they still will, but it won't count as a Lightning transaction? If the latter, does this mean the transaction fee will still be crazy high? Or is the Lightning Network expected to cause transaction fees to lower for transactions done on the underlying blockchain as well?
My weekly rant because I am still a noob.

I don't understand the point of 95% of the tokens out there and what am I going to possibly do with it.

Bitcoin I understand, its a currency that I can potentially buy a Doritos bag with at some point in my life. What exactly am I going to do with an alt-coin that is designed only for online gaming, photography or casino, when I don't use any of that stuff.

This coin space is really getting redundantly ridiculous. Everything seems vastly inflated. Yes, I admit, I am a bit jealous of people who made millions investing in terrible alt-coins, and maybe I am venting for this reason. But I also admit that I can't invest in a token or a coin which I deem virtually useless to me as a person and rather extremely high for the purpose it is designed for. 

I feel each token is only useful to those that are actually going to use that platform. The funny thing is a lot of us (including myself) never ever ever ever plan on using those platforms. We are literally just playing with digital codes and trading them based on news and speculation, or gambling in hopes it will increase a percent or two. 

Not meant as a FUD, its just something I am really trying to get my head around.

Hey guys! Would appreciate some help on some questions about selling products for Bitcoin:

What would be the best way for us to set up bitcoin as a payment method? Should we open a Lightning Node?

Also, if lets say our product is 10USD, do we set the price in bitcoin as a fixed price (arbitrarily 0.001BTC as an example) or does the price in Bitcoin change every day depending on the price of 1BTC? 

So lets say today 1BTC is 10k so we set the price as 0.001BTC, if at a time 1BTC becomes 20k do we set the price to 0.0005BTC?

If we are missing anything we would love more input and help! Thanks so much in advance! #fuckfiat
Recommendations on alt-coin exchanges binance like? Theese fees are killing me! (And no verification req)
We keep hearing "price will go up", "buy the dip", etc.  Can someone point me to any source of good reason to support this?  I mean, we can reasonably expect price of a company stock to go up when earning report is good.  So what's the basis for BTC or is it all just FUD?
https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/E25dvVua-BTCUSD-Potential-new-low-on-26th-of-January/

What do you think? It seems very logically that tommorow Bitcoin price will fall at least under 10k$ based on this **strange "coincidences"**. The "coincidences" are that exactly after the start of the CME contracts, price went slowly from 20k$ to 10k$ and exactly on 17th of january (when CBOE first contracts expired) price had a dip.

Most likely there will be a dip also tommorow, when first CME contracts will expire.

What will happen tomorrow? After the futures expire? Predictions for Bitcoin and the entire market.
I’m not psychologically to another red day today 🤬
Guys will the price go up or down in the coming few days?
The price is being clamped and walked down. I'm afraid futures is never gonna let it organically grow again.
Are there any exchanges where I can deposit BTC and sell for USD, to have USD balance while waiting for ID verification?
How is bitcoin ever going to be a real currency?

I bought a little when it crashed and I’m just finding out it’s the least practical thing ever invented... why would I ever want to pay a bunch of transaction fees and then wait an unknown amount of time for a confirmation?

With my cards my bank pays me to buy things...
Oh ill just post here so nobody sees my comment, sweet idea mods.

Guy to cheer you up check the new crypto anthem lol https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0Iq5Zl5vsGo
Hey guys just need some clarification regarding all these new government regulations. 
Firstly, as long as there is one country in the world without anonymity regulations, what's stopping criminals or anyone for that matter from sending all their crypto there?
Secondly, even if global anonymity regulations were to be in place in the future, how would governments ever regulate moving crypto by the way of cold storage, or people creating their own private wallets?
Cheers!
8k tomorrow 
Futures trading will be the death of bitcoin 
dropping hard. It will be a long time before bitcoin recovers 
I've got a question on LN. 

Let's say I have a lightning app on my phone. Do I have to open a channel (and therefore adding a lightning entry to the main blockchain) each time I connect to the web and want to pay for sg? 

Assume I pay with this LN app 5-6 times monthly. If each time I'm opening a channel, the system has to write it in the main blockchain, how's this different than paying as a single nowadays btc transaction?

I get that if I'm connected and opened a channel, I'm able to pay with very small amounts of fee and almost instantly. But what if my phone restarts or losts connection? Or I'm just using this rarely?
