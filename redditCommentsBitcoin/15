Good morning Europe. 

The dickline is holding. All is good.

Slow day, still over 9k, a good day. 
Everyone's complaining about the dip even though it's been soaring for the last three days. Surely it's just a good time to buy more? I'm a newbie, so correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm tempted to invest more today rather than be discouraged.
Whenever bitcoin reaches a new “important” number it dumps one or two times before breaking through.

Good morning. I think its still prudent to push for SegWit adoption. Currently its around 30% so there is plenty of room to grow assuming people dont have to use the legacy format. 

Fees are not too bad right now so probably most people dont care, but there could be a surge in demand any time and at that point you will be glad if your wallet or favorite exchange support SegWit because it can save alot on fees, and the higher they get the more you save with SegWit :) So just wanted to get that off my chest. Have a nice day and happy trading or whatever it is you do :)
Okay, I can’t actually believe I’m seeing all of these fudsters right now. Do you guys just sit and wait for the moment you see a red candle to post? Zoom out and notice only a couple of weeks ago we had a $1000 drop in only the course of a day, and you’re telling me this couple hundred dollar drop is the end? 
Nice Sunday morning discount. Great dip to stock up on.
We failed to break $10k, but bulls haven't yet lost their strength. The duel's still on, you see.
Haha I hate life
each weekend higher highs. 
That was "the dip".

Upwards and onwards!

... or it's a bear flag.
10k rejected. LOL. remember a week ago when people cried that 9k was rejected. LOL
Why's everyone so doubtful? This happens all the time, and it always recovers 
Anyone know what time the SEC meeting is at today?
LOL everyone on here so quickly to turn on bitcoin. Give it to Wednesday and the hype will be back
**Keep going Bulls, everyone that loves Bitcoin really appreciates your efforts.** 
In plain simple words, anyone has a clue why this ~400us drop ? Is this a Weekend weak hands effect only ?
Weeeeeeeeeekend sale-a-ton rollerrrrrrr coasterrrrrrr 
was just about to post I think a big spike is coming. U dirty old girl you.
Damp eet
Not enough people paying 10k for one Bitcoin, that's all. 


$10,000 rejected.... 
I guess the psychological level of $10,000 is not quite ready to be broken. I see no fundamental changes in the market. I would assume that we back up and get another run and go at it. Which as much as I wanted to see it break it is probably a healthy thing going forward long term.

I will say this also. The sell back volume was not as great as one would think. Which leads me to believe that the price can and will easily resume it's upward trend.

We will see.
MORNING!!!
I think the whales were building up a momentum trap to sell off right before the SEC hearing of ICOs tomorrow. If hearing goes well it's gonna pump again really hard.
Bunch of drama queens in the comments ... Time to put on your big boy pants fellas .. Stop crying over a few hundred dollars lol
Is there a guide on how to accept Lightning payments on Woocommerce shop? (Yes, I know there are risks.)
Really hope we can stay under 10k for at least another 2 weeks (payday), I need to buy more cheap btc 
Life is good in Hodlland %)
"the price of freedom is eternal vigilance"
The good news is that all the other top cryptos still seem to be tied to bitcoin price. Bitcoin maintains its dominance.

Morning traders, back with another live analysis of BITCOIN! [https://www.twitch.tv/krowncrypto](https://www.twitch.tv/krowncrypto)
I used my Bitcoin to fund my HappiStar account to join their [Bitday Bonus](https://www.happistar.info/promos/may-bitday-bonus/)! I did not regret doing it because I was able to earn more bonuses!! 
You are correct, it hasn't recovered in the last 3 months. However, for the last 10 years bitcoin has crashed numerous times yet continues to hit new ATHs. 
guess fun is over:(
really bad time to sell now. 
Come on drop ya bastard

this thread has 200 replies in 20 hours. bitcoin interest ded
The bad news is that all those people that watched the price fluctuate between $9900 to $9960 for days waiting to post their $10k memes are out of luck. The good news is that you can bring back the $9k memes soon, and maybe the $8k and $7k memes too if you are lucky.
10k to dumed 9400 lol
