Looks like Bitcoin showed us some love on Valentine's Day. It'd be nice if it could hold its support at $9k.
I know all the HODL chatter can get redundant and desperate sometimes, but I would have given into my panicking inner monologue a while ago if it wasn‚Äôt for it. Cheers
Only 11000 to go.
Oh my. It's happening. It's really happening. We're recovering.
Happy Valentine‚Äôs Day Bitcoin. Thank you for your nice gift. 
who let the bulls out
This is the best the 4H chart has looked since December, getting more optimistic.
The second this thing hits 10K, all hell will break loose as FOMO will rocket this ship back towards ATH.  Everyone on the sideline hoping for a rational double bottom will be kicking themselves as they punch the buy key - not wanting to miss out on the pleasure of the green play things.

Then we'll go back to the more meaningful posts about moons and lambos.  Frankly, I'm not a lambo fan.  But I might get a jet pack to chase all the drones around my hood.
Just donated to my favourite podcast using bitcoin. The transaction fee was ‚Ç¨0,08. Good stuff.
so glad to consistently BTFD. Still profiting now even after entering @ 15k.
Oh, we‚Äôre gonna blast past those 9.5 fuckers and take some names.
This will be north of 10K before my bubble bath is over.
Houston!  We have lift off!!!
Sold at 6500, bought back in at 9700. 

**Roast me / AMA**
next stop moon
wtf prompted this surge? usually dips are attributable to something, even if its an educated guess.
hopefully we get some media support again when jounalists write "bitcoin over 10k again". that would be nice.
Just smashed the 9500 wall and pushing 
Mr.Gorbecov tear down that wall
Am i alone to be happy with how it's evolving or what ? It can't take 10k in a week...But with how it's evolving aren't you confident ?? :o
So many salty xcoiners hoping for a crash.
Holy shiet look at all the buys..  green green!
why would you sell before the hearing is beyond me

the decline was over since days, investors jumping on the train before it's too late again
For Valentine's Day Satoshi gifted us a big green dildo to go bullish on the 4H
fuck it all in!! balls deep fam!
It's great that nobody has mentioned the futures expiring today. Even if they're net long, this is GREAT! If we're up like this at market close, it 's off to the races. 
I sent a low fee transaction today! 1.01 sat/byte and it was confirmed in just 12 minutes. Not bad for a $0.04USD fee
It appears as though the market has forgotten that bitcoin died last month
sooo, who's still waiting for that "2nd support test @ 6k"

Rip boys
gdax is looking like a battlefield
Let's give some love to Bitcoin today!‚ô•
Happy Valentine day to BTC and BTC Loversüòç

Upvote this spike is helping you cope with v-day blues
Well there are some positives going on for bitcoin markets right now imo:

-Chinese New Years starts on Friday
-US CPI was higher than expected (yeah you can spin this into a negative and tell yourself the Fed is going to raise 
  rates more than they initially thought but you just never know they have not suggest this as of yet). I foresee this rallying all the way up till closer to the Fed meeting, when we will get more information.
  Fed meeting in March. 
-10k is a nice even number, psychology suggest that people will continue to purchase because the psychology behind 
  it tells us so, always watch your evens as you begin approaching them. 

I am not saying we do not dip back into the 8k range but I think right now market psychology is that this thing is going to push 10k. We probably push it too soon and break back down, then bounce back up, and then as we get closer to the Fed meeting we will see a wedge form where the market will suggest it can break either direction. 

I may be putting too much into the Fed meeting and what they will say about rates and the economy of the US. 

Watch out for irrational exuberance. Once this thing breaks 10k there is no reason we do not break through that and go higher past that. 

I am looking for us to break out to 12-14k before the Fed meeting. If the meeting ends up saying they see threats and blah blah blah we arent raising rates. This thing will explode. If they do say they are going to raise rates or take further action against inflation, I expect this rally to get crushed. 

Either way there should be opportunities to lose some money in there. I have been pretty good at that so far. Ill probably be on the wrong end of this either way. 


Did I just watch a total of 130 BTC buy orders eating through the 9k wall in a split second?

##Moon Math Update

Go to http://moonmath.win for the full moon math table and rainbow charts 

Applying the moon math table to Local Bitcoin (LBC) volume projects 20 million
USD per day by the end of April. That substantially surpasses all mining demand.

LBC volume is considered an important indicator because it's an exchange of
last resort. Most people using it would use anything else if they could. IMO,
it predicts growth of new markets.

Come on folks, there is still plenty of hard work to do. 
Happy Valentine's Day Bitcoiners!!!. Thank you for so much, sorry for so little
If the value continues to rise, will we likely be looking at transaction fees surging again, making bitcoin hard to move/use?

If this happens, will this be a big problem for bitcoin?
Damn it I sold half back at 8k.....fml not sure if I should buy more or sell off....
US Congress BULLISH on blockchain technology!

anybody checking out the buy orders on GDAX right now??
Now i can goto sleep.
TO THE MOON!
IM VERY HAPPY TODAY

In a nutshell: can we attribute the rise in price to anything in particular or, like all BTC movement, do we just have to wonder and speculate?
I just bought more as we approach my cost basis, I wanted to take a shot to lower it again.
Valentine's day and Wall St is gifting big green dildos for everybody.

Get ready everyone, once Bitcoin breaks 10k there probably won't be much resistance all the way up to at least 15k.
My technical analysis: Bitcoin will bounce off of 9k repeatedly, each time with a higher low.  This will continue until btc bounces between 9000 and 8999 for the rest of eternity. 
Price manipulation? I mean a $600 jump in 15-20 min. Maybe not, probably just salty i some some at $8,900 at 6:30

Here's what the Singaporean regulator said about crypto speculation:
"But the speculators and the people who are making money out of this speculation of the cryptocurrency (market) are perhaps negatively impacting the whole experimentation of cryptocurrency."

I find this to be pretty disturbing.

Your thoughts?

Nice to see that BTC can have a nice bump on the CPI jump.  Of course, I am sure nothing is related to nothing.  Probably just means we're out of milk.  Hold tight for a brief dip as I buy more.

Painting the tape is a form of market manipulation whereby market players attempt to influence the price of a security by buying and/or selling it among themselves so as to create the appearance of substantial trading activity in the security. Painting the tape is an illegal activity that is prohibited by the Securities and Exchange Commission because it creates an artificial price for a security. The term originated in a bygone era when stock prices were largely transmitted on a ‚Äúticker tape.‚Äù
Ohhhh... so close!!

Help needed - As part of a college course I am doing I have been tasked with trying to explain what Bitcoin is in 500ish words. I've given it my best shot below - If you could read it and help me out with anything baring in mind word count I'd appreciate it a lot . 

(2) Your boss asks you to send them a short report on what Bitcoin is, what do you tell them?

According to its founder Satoshi Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash that engages in disintermediation allowing users to send payments directly to each other without the use of a third party. Bitcoin is a system that removes the necessity of trusting a third party to process payments between individuals who wish to buy and sell goods online as well as providing them with the anonymity that cash purchases do in bricks and mortar commerce. The Bitcoin system replaces trust in a third party such as PayPal with the use computer technology such as a hash based proof-of-work system and cryptographic signatures.

Users of Bitcoin interact with eachother anonymously using cryptographic signature technology. If we take the example of Bob wishing to buy a product from Alice, Alice would provide Bob with her public key address to which Bob would send her an agreed amount of bitcoin from his public key address. Alice then decrypts any payment sent to her public address using her private key and at this point can send Bob‚Äôs bitcoin she received on to another person as she has proved by using her private key to decrypt the transaction that she is the rightful owner of the coin now. 

Alice may be worried that Bob has double spent his bitcoin by also sending it to another user but this issue is solved by the way in which transactions are confirmed by the Bitcoin system. When Bob sends payment to Alice this transaction is broadcast to computers connected to the system known as nodes. Nodes collect up the transactions and group them together into blocks. Each block has its own unique identifier know as a hash which is made up of three elements 
1)	The Hash of the previous block
2)	A Merkle Tree Root- Which allows for each transaction with its own individual unique has be grouped under one hash.  
3)	A Nonce ‚Äì Which acts as a puzzle nodes seek to solve using computational power. Because each block is made up of transactions with individual unique IDs each nonce is a different unique value.

As each block‚Äôs hash begins with the previous blocks hash they form a sequential chain so that users of the system can confirm transactions based on their position in the chain. Blocks are added to the chain if 51% of all nodes in the system agree that the transactions within the block are legitimate ie the transaction are not double spending. Here Alice would be advised to wait for six blocks to form on the blockchain after her transaction has been confirmed as due to network latency transaction may be confirmed once within one block that is later be rejected by the network. 

Nodes in the system are rewarded for correctly forming blocks that are added to the chain with newly issued bitcoin and transaction fees users attach to the transaction they wish to send. In a situation where Bob wished to reverse his payment to Alice he we need to re-do the proof-of-work done by the other nodes in solving the nonces and have control over 51% of the nodes to approve his new block in a Sybil attack. For this situation to occur Bob would have to expand an extremely amount of large computational power incurring massive costs to do so as well as rendering all of his coin worthless as the entire system could no longer be trusted meaning nobody would use it. Therefore Bob is better off using his computational power to earn bitcoin to spend then devalue the entire system . 

Let‚Äôs go to $9800 tonight! And tomorrow $10k
let's tap that $10k, c'mooon who's with me?!?
BULL RUNNNN

Bitcoin is up and Tether just printed another 60 million. Anyone worried about this?
Wonderful.
I would not be that surprised if we passed $10k today.

So, I've got a few bitcoins bought from bitfinex when it was 8.2k and I feel like selling now and wait for it to dip again but also feel like this is the last chance to get in at such low price... not sure what to do.
December Bitcoin reaches 10K everybody gets Lambo, January Bitcoin reaches 10k everybody jumps into traffic
February Bitcoin reaches 10K everybody gets Lambo
We have strong order books and lots of market buys on gdax. Looks like we are going to make it!
For fucks sake Europe, please stop dumping.
i dont trust it. Dump inc 
Hey guys!!!!
I am new to crypto/bitcoin, I was wondering if you can buy in more than once???
Say I bought at 10k and it fell to 9k, can I buy in at 9k again and have 2 buy orders from the same account?

And if I can, how does gdax know which one out of the two I am trying to sell if, let's say, it goes up to 11k??

Meaning, I would be making a 1k profit from my 10k but-in order and 2k from my 9k buy-in order. How does gdax know which of the two will sell first when I sell at 11k??
hopefully the congress meeting will send us to 10k
Looks like we are trying again at $9000  
The battle is real.
Come On New York!

Major Notice: Bitcoin is far & safely out of the bubble zone. I feel that beanie babies and tulip bulbs are out of the question as we approach the $10k mark. Invest wisely from this base mark rising back to $20k in a few months time... March/ April to be speculative.
Oh god it's easy to make money sometimes. 
The only thing worse than the falling price of Bitcoin is a dirty bowl.
when Vegeta?
Nearly 100 from 10k. Let's go!

tickle the balls more sub reddits only $250 left to hit $10k... lets buy in. By BTC Advocate.
Guys, have you noticed how the exchange ALWAYS goes up between 6-10am/pm, always that range.
I assume it's because when it's morning here it's evening in china, and vice versa. People start to invest after they get back from work.

So this means that the next 3-5 hours will be steady, quiet, not much ups and downs. After that, it's either downhill or uphill.

Now although it is scary because you never know when people decide to pull out their profit, at least we know the time range at which it will happen‚Äîor so I assume.

Get ready for the next hit folks.
I'M HOLDING
