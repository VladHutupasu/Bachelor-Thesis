Daily Discussion, February 22, 2018
So you're saying the price doesn't go up continuously, every day? 
Fuck these detours and u-turns. I demand a straight fucking line to the moon.
10k stronk af. 1 upvote = $1 for green dildo
Did BTC miss earnings estimates, is that why they are down?
Don't hate whales; be a whale. Be honest with yourself, you want to be  whale. 
I do.
Ppl freaking out about this drop from 11 something to 9, it‚Äôll be ok.

Patience. And balls. Lots of balls. And maybe whiskey.
Every person here should officially disregard this sub, or at least these daily threads, as anything helpful or useful. These are just unhealthy. No one here has any clue what they are talking about. The amount of new accounts this sub seems to draw is overwhelming, and all of them are either bad actors spreading fud, dopes who shouldn‚Äôt be playing the game to begin with, or hand-wringers who just come here to say things like ‚Äúwho else thinks it‚Äôll go up today?‚Äù Or ‚Äúanyone else see us going down to 9.5-9k range??‚Äù with absolutely nothing to back it up. Not that anyone has anything to back a claim up here because we all know nothing.  Anyone asking for advice here, and then acting on advice from whichever random idiot responds first, is a fool. Thread is cancer. 
Price is going downwards and there are a few articles about it. If Bitcoin falls below $10,000 will it likely scare a lot of people into panic selling?
just bought some btc. past movements one thing I clearly know is, when it comes below 10K, you should invest more!
You bunch of pussys 
Im down 200k in two days. Happy weekend everybody. 
Makes me laugh, when Bitcoin is going down the 'I told you so' brigade come out in full force, they are no where to be seen when Bitcoin's price goes up.  
Please stop. My arse cheeks can only get so clenched

Why are you guys selling? How am i supposed to buy a house with a 12 car garage but only buy 6 cars, if you keep selling?
Popcorn mode on:)

The most obvious dip ever after it failed to hit 12k tbh. I don't think it will go too much further down.
Dips over, now moon.
So I'm a noob, but everyone seems to be freaking out about everything so lemme bring some nieve positivity to yalls discussion. I put a few hundred dollars into this shit. I'm having a blast and learning a lot about the market and its volatility. Every day I wake up and it's a new adventure. Is today the day I turn a few hundred into a Lambo? Is today the day I watch my money go up in flames? Who knows!? Clearly not anyone on here because there's a million different opinions/theories regarding the market. So do what you're gonna do (probably buy high and sell low cause you're a bitch) but as long as you're truly abiding by what I consider to be the golden rule, which is to never invest more than you're ok with losing, than you really shouldn't be this emotionally invested. Just have fun you guys, next stop, the moon!!

Tl;Dr = we're all just gambling
UPPPP!!!



 UPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
Now $9800. $10k is not holding.

I don't get it. Why is there still massive selling?
Just take a little break folks.  Let the markets do their thing.
Buy high sell low. No other way around it
Really don‚Äôt understand why people are hoping for it to go down to 6k again, just so they can buy cheaper. It took alot of great news and firepower to  bring the price up. I‚Äôm afraid it won‚Äôt come up as fast as before. Too many investors got burnt. Thanks whalesüëç
Thanks to slow bank transfer times I had to wait to take advantage of the dip until now. By having to wait I just scooped up some more btc at sub 10k price. Yay!
That's a dippy boi right there.

plz if u cant go up don't fall 
[deleted]
Bunch of fake ass walls.
i buy a little with every paycheck, no cares about current value.  usd is dead to me.  bunch of bullshit about the current drop in value though, obvious manipulation, but it gives all of us an opportunity to buy in and cash out when it spikes again..  i guess thats the point of all this for alot of people and those behind the manipulation..
One of these days we will find you whales and stick this red dildo where it belongs!
From a purely TA perspective, there was a peak of 19k at 17-Dec followed by a big drop to 10k, a peak of 17k at 6-Jan followed by a drop to 9k, 12k peak at 28-Jan followed by drop to 6k. Each peak is lower than previous and also each drop more severe. Thus the recent recovery's failure to break 12k may be seen as significant and people may be expecting a drop below 6k. 

The market can be self fulfilling. Personally, I think the fundamentals are a lot stronger now. And I hope the sentiments will also prove more positive. Just keeping my fingers crossed that TA will prove wrong here.
hold onto your asses people. Just look at the graphs..HODL and buy more! Flash sale on Bitcoin
$9600 trench warfare. below that every man for himself.
The real question is, "How much is 1 BTC ACTUALLY worth?"
If the "Whales" pump the price up and down doesn't that mean the current worth of a Bitcoin is inaccurate? ...asking for a friend...
btc by this wknd will be 12k+ just sit back have a Gray Goose 
If you told me two weeks ago we would be at 10,000 I would have given you a kiss. If you told me we would be at 10,000 two nights ago I would have given you a diss.
Too much good news is bad for BTC, so down it goes like shit falling off a monkey's ass with stomach complications, until some bad news kicks it back up again. Go figure!!!¬¨!
10k we are coming! Prepare memes.
In this moment of stress I call upon all of you at 30 minutes past the hour we will shout UP UP UP YOU GO TO THE MOON. Get ready 7 MINUTES TO GO AND WE WILL BE BACK UP.
PUMP IT UP: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HtyF0jux2Q

Breaking! This just in: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7g9cd3/its_official_1_bitcoin_10000_usd/
Got in at 11,000. Want to sell and rebuy when it dips lower, but it'll probably jump as soon as I sell lol 
Speculators.. Who's doing this yo-yo s***? When the price stabilizes it will go up. 
Damn, Bulls seem whipped right now.
I wonder if any whales read or post in this thread.  
USA and EU gave everything to keep btc around 10k. its your turn asia. good night. 

(meanwhile waking up at 7am CET tomorrow, btc at 8.9k)
How low will it go? Im ready to buy
[deleted]
Everyone sell it all. It's crashing. Panic sell. Flip cars. Set shit on fire. Do dumb shit.
I was told there would be lambos. I even ordered the air freshener on amazon.
testing 9k tonight kids,hold on to your hats we are in for a ride
I have a goddamn plan. Screw the charts, I'm going to watch a Vikings episode and when I get back BTC will be over 10K.
Next stop? 

‚óè 8k 

‚óè6K

BUY THE FLUFFING DIP

Anyone using Kraken that doesn't live in the US?

I'm new and wondering how long will it take for them to credit my account after I wire transfer them the money?

Once my account is credited, how fast are the transactions? 

How long is the withdraw process?

Thanks and yeah I know I'm about to lose all my money.
Where do we go from here? To the moon or to the sun? 
So here's the dilemma. 
bought at 8500 (‡∏ø0.08126	+ mined 0.0033)
hodl and hope for the best.
or
sell and hope it goes down and when if it's 6k again buy. and hodl and hope for the best? :D
Time for you Americans to shine! 
There is almost no resistance at 10k, this should be easy.
Anyone with some free time willing to PM me and help with some Segwit questions? Mostly about using a segwit wallet / transferring btc to exchanges.
You can actually see bitfinex freeze up a bit when the prices hit certain multiples of 100,  like they hit a large pool of limit orders they have to process,  and they slow down,  THEN they start reflecting the action resulting from the flood of sells or buys.  

Or my internet is flakey?
Fire up the 10k memes folks. We‚Äôre back. 
So... in the rare event that it drops below 7k again, where do you think the true bottom is? 6k for a double bottom or freefall to something like 2k?
We are all air lovers because we like the weather and HODL it for god sake...
Love that humor, Skalinas

9.5 k today
Hey guys can someone recommend a good site to turn BTC into fiat and withdraw via bank transfer for US customers? I had a Coinbase account but they lowered my limits years ago. I have been using Gemini for awhile but someone recently hacked my account so I had to freeze my account and I don't know how long the process takes to unfreeze it. Any recommendations are greatly appreciated. Thanks!
[deleted]
Imagine still having bitcoin.
Bought when it was at bottom yesterday, happy to see we are still holding, even if we are not far from where i bought i'm confident now.
Oh good. We didn't hit 9.5K and this is *very* good news, I'd expect a slow and steady grow today.
Sell before it drops below 10k
Do not sell I repeat do not sell.
Bitcoin would be more useful if it was treated as a currency.  Y'all are just reliving history of penny stocks, complete with the many exchange services that turned out to be scam artists who cut and ran.

The worst thing for Bitcoin as a currency is people who just hold onto it, hoping for their big payday.  If you want to gamble, there are less risky ways to gain the same profit than to follow whatever the 1000 people that make the top 40% make of the trends.  

I mean shit, today's dip from news that doesn't actually affect Bitcoin and altcoin...it's clearly price manipulation and y'all are falling for it time and time again, with the least experienced people essentially giving their money away to the rich.  
Hey all. The Bitcoin whale-watching app I shared a little while ago for Python coders is now hosted sustainably online so now coding experience is required to use it :)

Always remember to ignore the drama and focus on the technology.  These are positive times for Bitcoin.  
Can someone explain to me why it took until 2008 for a system like blockchain to emerge? I realize that it was a stroke of genius in both computer technology and economics, but somehow it seems as if it could have also occurred in the two decades of internet development prior. 

Am I missing something trivial like bandwidth and storage capacity becoming cheap enough for a system like this to become sustainable?
Hell yes just bought some more at that sub 10K price
Im optimistic today.  I smell a good $500 jump at some point today
Just got slightly above $10k  
See you again at 6k
These bitcorn red dildos is really stretching my chocolate starfish.
the rich people control the markets like they want... they buy on 6k and now they push down the market again and buy again on low prize....Rich become richer . Normal people become poorer nothing has changed.
[deleted]
This is how they get your coin, they scare the weak and buy up cheap. Most who sell will end up buying higher. Institutional buyers do it all the time on Wall St, now they are here. GL everyone.
We are bouncing back!
I sold a tiny bit @9700. It will only go up from here. My loss is forever your gains.
I don‚Äôt want to jinx it but it seems like 9.8k may be the new bottom. Thoughts?
[deleted]
i got downvoted a lot for cheering for the whales. please upvote me now coz i'm cheering for the bulls! let's break that 10k wall. fk em whales!
I have a stop loss ready at 9.5K. Just sayin'.
It's just the Whales selling to get the price down.

The question is now whether to buy the dip or not.
Why is dropping so hard?
Mostly Bullish but i hate that and chart stink.Time to be safe.
[deleted]
shit guys, we ran out of Tether..
Easily under 10k. üôÇ
It's really funny to see how bitcoin doesn't really have any price support, but every $100 is resistance.
I got in at 11.7k. Is it gg for me or not? I don't mind holding LT.
anyone else think 9k-8.5k will be the new bottom?
i clearly see a rising trend because i can smell it.
All of red because the exchanges bots still shorting. They do it almost two month.  They can fail all coins in same time, just insider trading 
Sell, you fools... And leave some for me at $6k.
Check the 1day chart. You find it optimistic .. ?
FULL BULL CYCLE COMMENCE!

Bitcoin heading for 9.5 K
While the blockchain has value, these constant $2-3k dips are not helping the community.  It's looking like a pump n dump scheme.  I've been using BTC for years and I'm even becoming afraid lol.
Not sure if to buy or wait a few hours. So bloody pricey in NZ, google says it's currently 13847 but the cheapest I can find is 14623 fucking sad.
What about BTCP fork?
Sell or keep?
Silence before the storm
[deleted]
Still don‚Äôt understand why in the world would whales day trade with expensive ass BTC and not alt coins? I‚Äôm sure they would get much bigger gains. 
Discounts incoming. 10,000.10.
How low we going today do you think? Because I plan on buying this dip.
The Zaif news has scared off investors.
I have a couple of technical questions:

Can anyone explain to me the following about mining?
1) Are miners free to choose whatever transactions they want to include in the block (both number of tx to include, and which ones?)
2) If they can choose, then why do we see empty blocks mined? Surely this is really unprofitable and against their own interests? And if not, then I still don't understand how or why this happens?
3) If they can choose, could this be an (attempted) way to combat criminal activity? I.e. the authorities could make it illegal for miners to include certain transactions known to be criminal? (Regardless of whether it would work in practice).
Transferred some BTC from gdax to kucoin and it was almost instant. Any reason for this? Segwit?
[deleted]
Can someone help me with some Segwit questions? If i created a segwit wallet on Electrum, can i freely send btc back and forth to GDAX to trade? or will I run into issues?
When will it stop?:(
America, Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, Middle East.... lift it up... this dildo is facing down.

Idk, I imagine myself selling and then seeing bitcoin go back up and being upset. I won't sell when my emotions are telling me to.
The market is deciding whether to correct the recent uptrend or continue to correct last year's bull run.  This is a significant moment for the short term (1 year) projection.

Great day for making some extra bitcoin on the dollar right guys? Dont worry, this is good for Bitconnect.
Curious how down it will go
DCA. bought a couple hundred.
Looks like we are staying around $10.2k at the moment, hopefully around 7am-8am New York time we get some positive buying.  So the next few hours.

In my next life I want to be a whale
Isn't it a bit unusual that alts appear to be pretty much unaffected by this dip? Most of the time when there's a dip in BTC alt market goes all red, often dropping considerably more than BTC itself. Right now, if you look at coinmarketcap prices in BTC, it's mostly green.
What do people think of EIDOO  for a small investment? Is it shovelware?
I expect going flat all day. And before evening massive sellout to 7k‚Ç¨.
off to 5k we go guys.

Bear trend for at least 1 week. Both $10k and 8k‚Ç¨ have been breached.
We DONT sell motherfuckersssss!! We own the future of world‚Äôs currencies and wont let anyone taki it from our hands! We are the strong! NOT the fuckin whales! If we dont sell they will buy nothing!! STOP selling your fortune
If bitcoin goes under ¬£6,000 i‚Äôm selling. Surely if it can dip -¬£2,000 , there‚Äôs no hope.

Bubble will pop :D 
Lets have a good day folks, think positive!  We can get back to where we were over the next few days, lets start with Europe getting us back to around $10.5k 
I sold my newest BTC, will buy again lower, good luck.
If you haven't sold yet you are going to regret it like that pretty young waitress that eyed you but you were too nervous to say anything.

If you bought at this $10k "base" I don't know what to say to you.
Full Bull Cycle Commence!
dow jones down = bitcoin down

#FML
There's a 1000 BTC buy wall on bitfinex. Surely this cannot be easily broken.
This Zaif news is hitting the price quite hard. Expect 9500 by morning 
literally the millisecond after i click my mouse and the sell order goes thru, the trade history bar fills up with green orders and the price goes up $50 loooool
