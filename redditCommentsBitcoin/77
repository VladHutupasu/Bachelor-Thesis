Daily Discussion, March 10, 2018
This buying the dip and losing another 6% each day is starting to get old 
Me yesterday: "Ooh it's so far down, great time to buy!"

Me today: FUCK. FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUUUUCK
I'm curious as to the average age of a r/bitcoin user. The level of aggression to posts in a discussion thread is hilarious. This daily discussion thread has made the subscription to r/Bitcoin totally worth it. Cheers
well that will teach me a lesson to not get greedy and try to sell for $10 higher lol.
* Looks, its a good time to buy bitcoin.
* No, its too expensive.
* .
* what about now?.
* No, its too cheap.
WTF?..Gemini under maintenance?..how am I going to short now?
"throw your doubts away, believe in technology" - easier said than done
Been up all night!

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray that Bitcoin doesn't sink
And if it does before I wake
I pray Satoshi my bits to take

Green dildo time 
Buy at 8600, think itâ€™ll pump back to 9400+ this weekend for small EZ profit?

You wonder why Binance/Okex/Huobi volume has been consistently top 3 when the entire market is down? This guy knows it!

Is Bitcoin going to go up or down? Asking for a friend 
I'm mining bitcoin using nicehash, apparently if I send the BTC to coinbase, there is no fees. So I created an account on coin base. Thing is, I'm under 18 so can't verify, so if I send bitcoin to my coinbase account, will they be locked till I verify? Or do I only need to verify when I buy using fiat? 




  Also what are the fees for withdrawing on coinbase?
Why are we down again?

Ok, now is it the bottom?  Asking for a friend 
This message is mainly for the newbs here, but if you are feeling queasy right now about your investment in Bitcoin maybe this will help you too:

Bitcoin (and Blockchain) is a truly beautiful innovation that is here to stay.  If you feel nervous about the price volatility at this early stage of development, I encourage you to read some of the first e-mails by the creator of Bitcoin Satoshi Nakamoto and the reaction from his e-mail group:

https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html


Here is the original white-paper:

https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf


At times I get nervous too when I look at the price, as I have a lot invested in bitcoin.  At these times it is very reassuring to read these early writings on bitcoin and it reminds me why I'm invested.  


Another thing that helps is to watch some youtube videos by the Winklevoss twins. They have been true believers in bitcoin almost since the beginning and believe the price could eventually get to over 300,000 per coin (marketshare of gold).  There are others like John Mcafee that believe it could easily get to 1 million per coin by end of 2020.   Even if it only gets to 100k by then that's still 10x your money today!  And by holding bitcoin longterm you are helping this amazing system (based on pure math) succeed.  It could really change the world and you could be a part of it.  Think of this before you panic sell in the future.  


To repeat my earlier advice, follow my lead and get some money ready on the side to buy any significant drops caused by the Mt Gox guy dumping.  You will thank me later if you buy when you can and hold long term.  All the best to my fellow hodlers.  
To $10,000 or $8000?
Set a buy order at 8400 and go enjoy your weekend...
This thread really has become a place where nooblets who bought v.high without seeing BTC chart before want to fomo other nooblets who dont know what BTC even is, so that they dont get stuck on high price.

On the oppposite end, there are also many nooblets who want to FUD other nooblets into mass selloff, because they are poor mcdonald workers and dont have money to realistically invest when price is relatively high.

To be quite frank with you, I come here for fun and daily troll. Please writhe some more for my entertainment.
Tell you what guys, if I ever become a multi billionaire I promise that I will buy $1 Billion worth of bitcoin which will increase the market cap by at least $60 billion!
Donâ€™t feed the whales folks. Have a nice day. 
Gonna bounce back to 7700-8000 then shoot back to 10 during the week

Tag me during the week to remind me how correct I was 
My gut feeling is that today will be generally positive. 
Good morning America. 
So.. according to 1D Stoch RSI oversold, a beautiful bounce on *both* 4H MACD and 1D BB, we'll go up within a few days.

I don't think this is very reliable in a manipulated market but hey, one can hope.
Hello, can someone explain how to get a list of lighting nodes and their connections? I understand that the protocol makes it such that new connections are "broadcasted" but to where?
Another day, another bitcoin.

9400 tough wall to crack 
How do all the bitcoin exchanges synchronise the price ?? 

would really appreciate a valid reply  
Goodbye, beautiful money :'(
**We need a BULLISH BREAKOUT!**
Time to buy back!
The dip that was promised

Thank you very much stupid whale, I took the chance to buy more.
The dip which keeps on dipping.

Some TA, if you are that way inclined.

Cue the abuse ðŸ˜€
Lightning needs to hurry the hell up already, or better yet take your time so we all can buy more cheap coins. 
1) Do you think BTC will break 15k within 1 year from today?
2) Do you think BTC will drop below 1k within 1 year from today?
3) Do you think BTC will break 30k within 2 years from today?
4) What do you think will be the Low and High for 2018?
Is GDAX really better than Coinbase?
Question: How do developers go about improving bitcoin while keeping it decentralized? Are there rules or limitations or do some developers have more power over others? Could someone explain? Sorry for the noob question
I think it's safe to conclude that the recent crash has been far less severe, judging from objective factors, compared with the crash from ATH in December towards the final valley and bounce at 6th of February. This time Kobayashi hasn't sold off anything, and as far as we know the Mt Gox debt is more or less paid off.

While the price of Bitcoin is still affected by fears from the recent crash, combined with fears of near future drops, I personally doubt to see a drop below $8000 at this point in time. At the moment a lot of potential buyers naturally want to wait and see where the final bottom occurs, which reduces the demand presently.

On the other hand of the spectrum we have bitcoin miners and potential sellers that expect a rise towards 10-11k levels within a week or the coming week. Considering the recent crash and the fears in the market they might have to settle for 9.5k presently even though they consider 10k+ to be a reasonable market price in a market that isn't affected by strong fears.

The question is then how low the sellers and miners are willing to go below their expected sale price. On the one hand, if they wait, the prices will eventually recover from the crash. On the other hand, if they need cash right away they might sell now if they fear a further drop.

If the market sellers expects a return to 10-11k levels within a foreseeable future, then every thousand dollars below this line is considered a substantial loss of potential revenue. This is why I don't expect to see prices below 8k at the moment; it may happen as a quick visit from sellers that need urgent cash, but a few exceptions won't dictate the price for long.

This is why I think that predictions of a price below 5.8k is wishful thinking: yes, I would love such low prices to accumulate more BTC, but I don't think there would be enough sellers that would consider that price range to be beneficial. Since 11k is a definite possibility in the coming weeks, only a fool would sell below the worst crash bitcoin has seen, from which it has recovered remarkably since then. Further drops may happen, but the question is how likely a particular drop is compared to expected sale prices.
HODL is a valid strategy as long as the long term price target you have based on whatever valuation model you're using is higher than the current market price. When the recent price action outstrips your long term valuation expectations, it makes no sense to HODL.

Here is a little protip:  Sell high, buy low

Whatâ€™s the difference between Bitcoin and NASA?

Bitcoinâ€™s actually going to the moon.


To $10,000 or $8000?
What is Mt. Gox and can we kill it?
I don't know about you guys, but I'm ready for another six weeks of red dildos.
Diarrheacoin is back!
This Crypto's price has been propped up like Weekend at Bernie's
Bitcoin continues the downward trend in 2018. Sideways movement is going to chase away many 10X investors
25k in 8.6 hours you dense cunts. I run this fuckin game
Good morning America! Love you!
Who thinks we'll see 10k briefly in the next 48 hours?
I just wish people who have accounts for less than a month stop spreading FUD. Iâ€™m not trying to impose views on others. Read why bitcoin is created, why hodl. Thereâ€™s more to it than profit.

To $10,000 or $8000? 
Luckily the prices are moving back up again !
The chance of this flipping to a green candle today is pretty high. Bitcoin has only had this many red candles in a row 1 time in the past 6+ months and that was coming off of the ATH. 
Guys the faster it goes down the better.

Rip off the bandaid! And let it slowly heal :-)))

What a wall of worry...

Back in the green and it's going up fast.
lmao were all dead...
Dip buyers be like:

https://i.imgflip.com/264xdp.jpg
Can it go down to 4-5k already. Stop teasing us. 
so all coins price is based off of BC because the exchanges exist where you can turn any crypt into another, but how do you guys select altcoins when diversifying your portfolios ? ;P
down btc


RIP 9k buy wall
Fake buy walls are real though
The futur of the crypto will be decided by G20 members. Just hold and pray..  1k or 17k in 1 month...

why low sales volume have such a significant impact on the BTC?
I am wrong ?

How long is it taking for transactions to be confirmed right now?  

Last time I sent a transaction it took 6 weeks to be confirmed! (last year with a very low fee)
Mining is supposed to be close to the margin cost. According to [this article](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/03/09/bitcoin-mining-energy-prices-smalltown-feature-217230?utm_content=buffer5eea4&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer) mining only costs $2k USD per bitcoin. Prepare to dive dive dive.
well look like bitcoin rolled over...
Buy low sell high
What effect do you think market manipulation through sentiment wrangling (FUD, FOMO...) ultimately has on long term community growth and usage?  Anyone else find it strange that the SEC statement was also released on FUD day, the timing was spot on.

Here we go again... 
What would happen if every person in Europe and America bought $100 worth in the next 3 hours? 
End of Bitcoin is upon us.


 Just kidding what do I know. 
btc is in downtrend,strong downtred from 17 dec, i am btc fan,but now i have all my btc sell, 100% sure ,double bottom..... at least double bottom...
1- We are in a bear market for while now, meaning no new money coming in to sustain the price or increase it. A lot of people will stay out of this until things improves. Bitcoin drops as hard as it goes up, don't bet against the trend

2- We need to retest the 6k to make sure its a true bottom

3- No one knows what the hell is going with Mt. Gox bitcoins

4- Sentiment toward bitcoin price is mixed between bitcoiners

5- There are still issues with the stock especially with USA tariffs and the effect on that is glob
NateTGreat20 is right. I think 6-7k will be our new best friend.
I'm getting ready to restock tomorrow evening or Monday morning.    Sure could use some help from the Mt. Gox guy!
[deleted]
buy high sell low..when shorting lol
Still 8.5k+.   This is boring.
Boys kick you ass and run. It's a trap . You will end up as a beggars. 
10K is a long, lost memory. 9K will likely not be seen for a while either. Here comes 7K.
