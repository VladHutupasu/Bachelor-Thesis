Only 11 more months until Chinese new year 2019! Just keep HODLing boys!!!!
When you feel bad always remember that this guy \*proudly points thumbs at himself\* bought at 11500. Then at 9800. Then at 8000.
Every time I buy there’s a significant dip right after. Am I missing something? This has been nothing but a headache for the last few months 
**LONDON, March 18 (Reuters) - FSB (Financial Stability Board, FSB), which coordinates financial regulation for the countries of the G20 , on Sunday rejected calls from several countries who called for regulation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.**

The FSB, however, stressed the need for greater international coordination in monitoring these rapidly evolving technologies, which still represent a tiny sector equivalent to less than 1% of global gross domestic product.

"The first assessment of the FSB is that currently, these crypto-assets do not pose a risk to global financial stability," said Mark Carney , president of the FSB, in a letter to finance ministers and governors of central banks, which will meet in Buenos Aires on Monday and Tuesday.

Mark Carney, who will leave his post next year, when he resigns as Governor of the Bank of England, noted that his successor would oversee a regulator more inclined to review existing rules than to set up new ones.

In his letter, he also said that the FSB, which has conducted a series of banking and financial reforms after the 2007-2009 crisis, will focus on the current rules rather than design new ones.

"As the work of the FSB, which aims to fill the fault lines that caused the financial crisis, is nearing its end, the latter will focus more (..) on the implementation and rigorous evaluation of the effects. reforms approved by the G20, "said Mark Carney.

such sell, much pushy, wow
In 365 days what are we going to be talking about here in this chat 
This is just a grand psychological experiment.  Soon all of our money will be returned to us with a note that this was just an experiment about crowd psychology and that there really never was anything called cryptocurrency.

Then part B of the experiment will start - as we are all monitored for signs of despair and disbelief.... and an uncontrollable longing to read Reddit or stare at the screen full of green and red lines....
I just wanted to do something good for once in my life. I’m not sure how much will I have left.
The next few years is crucial
My node just went online on Lightning mainnet and I want to express my happiness about that 😎
Cannot believe we’re struggling to hold $7500 at this point. What a shitty couple of weeks. 
People waking up with the St. Patrick's Day hangover are not gonna be happy to see today's price...
Another pump! Now over $8300.
This is becoming one convincing pump.  I am FOMO'ing at the mouth....
How the hell did we get to "Hope" already?

Reading this commentary I am going to invest in:

Largest green volume on a daily candle since mid December .... very bullish
Bitcoin represents decentralized money and all I keep hearing is "G20". Who gives a shit if the G20 meeting goes well or not? If everybody in control said Bitcoin was shit I wouldnt care. Sure the market would care but Bitcoin is going to become what it is going to be become regardless.

Its really ridiculous. People believe in Bitcoin because it allows you to escape the legacy financial system and then when people in that system take shots at Bitcoin everybody sells. Pretty retarded.
There's this hilarious plugin on tradingview that supposedly "catches" the bottoms and everytime it finds one, another follows shortly after. lol
I'm one of the people on the sidelines waiting to buy once it bottoms. Bitfinex does margin trading but doesn't allow US residents like myself. Coinbase does but you have to be a bajillionaire. Amyone know of a place that allows margin trading? 
GG 📉
Will the G20 conference really make a difference? 
these next few minutes are cruciably crusial 
Looks like Nostradamus was right, haters still gone hate
Decentralized tech  Centralized control
In less than 30 minutes the price has gone from $7546 to $7839, almost a $300 increase. So is this the market just picking up or is it deliberate buying from whales for their next pump and dump?
gotta love the manipulation
Guess a big dump is comin lol

Is there a particular site / source we're watching for g20 updates? 
Lost 3000$ of my hard money on crypto
Last night have a nightmare about Bitcoin at 2k. 

But was a nightmare not because Bitcoin was at 2k, was because i didn't have money to buy the dip. 

Just sold all my Bitcoin, can't take this anymore. I'll be back in a few months and see how we are doing.
How many pump and dumps can we have in a day before everyone finally gets wise?  (Of course, this means I mis-time them all so I am just bitching.  But seriously, how many?!?!)

It is unreal. 90% of us on Reddit gets it... who the hell are these people?

I know everyone here hates the thought of regulation - but frankly, regulation would legitimize this as an alternative currency or store of wealth AND would work to prevent this rampant manipulation.

Or do we hate government and regulation more than we hate being manipulated and losing all our money?

Right now we have the worst of both worlds.  We get taxed on the cash out (1099 is in the mail!  Significant transaction report is on its way to the Treasure Department each time you have a large transaction come from the exchange and back to your account).  On the other end, we are (mostly) small fish at the whim of bots, whales, and inside trading.

If anyone asks why I am here, I am here to CELEBRATE the technology.  (LOL)
Pump and dump, don't fall for it, probably going to double pump this one.

Edit: there's your second pump, time to short
The buy wall @ $7500 lasted a whole 4 seconds. Bitcoin getting absolutely wrecked. 
Bottom 1k 2k or 2 dollars?
bigfishh posted this.....

The entire ecosphere really feels like a wet dog, that is trying to get dry again. What does he do? Shake his fucking body. That's exactly what is happening whenever Bitcoin moves either direction at the moment.

Bitcoin loses value, Alt lose double/tripple their value.

Bitcoin wins value, Alts cannot keep up with gains from Bitcoin.

This is why, despite going down and sinking hard, the dominance is almost going up faster than before, now being close to 46%. Gotta give it to the dips man, they're healthy for Crypto it really does feel like it. All the hype is shaken off all of these ICOs that haven't delivered a single thing, but a white paper, but are worth billions of dollars?

All recent news is good and Bitcoin will probably exit g20 on a positive note, and who will not leave on a positive note or at least is heavily endagered? ICOs.

Seems like that dominance going back up could this time be a more long'ish trend. At first Ithought we'd see a stop 48%, but this really looks like, with a BTC bullrun always coming first, we might head up to values of 62-65%, obviously possible higher.

What do you guys think?
Fuck this shit....
9k by the end of the week due to good g20 news and more. Buy now or regret
I've been thinking about making my own coin soon. Anyone can do it so I thought long and hard about a good name and I'm going to call it Buttcoin. Anyone want to invest? I of course will pre mine 20 million coins so if anyone buys I will make pure profit. I heard it's going to moon!
Reason why pumping:

guys prepare the 10k memes :P
That moment when no one is glad anymore that btc is going up because everybody thinks it will go back down soon.
It’s sad seeing the crypto market be reduced to a joke from manipulation so badly. I want to believe that Blockchain tech will allow us to strive forward but with weak hands in the market and this much BS it’ll slowly turn into a sad meme and falter.

welp, it’s been real guys 
So on Friday 23 it's either Hel or Valhalla. Cool.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/GNxW8OBr/
Im trying to guess when the US wake up will they see this price of $7600 and think BUY or SELL?  There’s no stock-market issues so more likely buy?
we are dropping again, another pump that got no where 
Any thoughts on the up coming G20 meetings?
I personally can't see anything that negative. What are your thoughts?
Question: I took my bitcoin off the exchange and put it into a mycelium wallet. 1. What is a good segwit wallet to transfer to, 2. Is segwit part of that smaller transactions fees, Lighting Network bag? 3. What else is segwit good for?
Where are all the Lightning Network field reports?
Anyone think it dips under 7k today? 
Sunday sell off say we will break $8000 on Monday
If you have come to reddit for investing advice, you have already failed. Never knew the world had so many fortune tellers. How many people here are rocking magic eight-balls?
Altcoins are going up now in relation to BTC. Is that a signal?
May 15 will signal major change in world finance as Uranus enters Taurus. What this means for bitcoin is still up in the stars.

Edit: teehee at the Uranus joke I love it
Okay I gotta ask. Why the spelling of HODL
Have we hit the bottom yet folks?  (around $7300)
Sigh 
Whales are just gonna poop all over the pump you watch, after rekt bots start selling and we back to 7300
Would be great if some whales appear in the next few hours, creating a strong support point at 9k.
How are people doing their taxes with lost transaction information (btc-e was seized by the FBI)?
This is beatuiful
The sudden charge to 7900.
Ive experienced so many of these pumps recent weeks. Just followed by 500$ dumps within 5 minutes. I dont trust this shit anymore:(
Can you feel it?
and we going down again :D
wtf just happened
Fuckin whales bitcoin never dies
Totally organic movement. Nothing to see here, please move along.
Pump some good old fashioned fomo into the veins of the people bitcoin
What song to play during these hours ? 🎶🎶🎶😉
Seems to be stuck on 8300.00 any barely moving!
I can believe it!! Looks like very soon I will be able to afford 8bg card for my gaming needs....

This a buy opportunity, can’t wait for next week.

>\>supposedly decentralised currency

>\>price is controlled by whales

Gee, such improvement.
the pump is slowing down guys :(
Just sold half a btc...seemed like a good idea...might not be though...and ain't that the truth :) A 1000 rise in a few hours seems like a good place to drop some BTC :/ Hodling for hodling's sake seems a bit foolish when you can make an honest profit!
Stop Sell orders going out (and stop prices raising) like there's no tomorrow. 
hold on fellass!!!
>"He fell for the pump... dump it"

https://i.imgur.com/PoahUK9.png
Welp, I'm out. You guys that are still hodling have bigger balls than I do. I still managed to make a very hefty profit. I'll be back buying when bitcoin is in the triple digits.
I should have bought more at 7400
😭😭😭😭😭
To all the **trolls**, I love the smell of **Bitcoin** in the morning.
I love these pumps and dumps!  Literally happening every hour or two!  And every single time, enough people are falling for it!  Do folks just not look at the 1m and 5m charts?   Is everyone's screen stuck on a 1w chart?

The rank manipulation is stealing from all of you!  You have two options.  Hold or stay on the sideline.  Until enough folks do either (or both) this stairway to hell continues.

I mean really, doesn't everyone want to get the bottom over with so we can start over and get on with life? 
state of the art  manipulation
He thinks he's about to make it.
**The way I see it is.....balance of probability using recent regulation means the G20 will be good for Bitcoin and the price could easily rise very quickly.  Now is a good time to buy so I am buying today.  All the best.** 
Drop was maniupulated af, buyers won now. Reversal back to 12k incoming. Rip all those weak hands who sold at 7300. 
Well I sold... waiting on a dip now to buy back. Surely its coming.
The death cross is nigh. Time to make the donuts 
Just woke up here in Japan. Check my phone to see my Stop Order got triggered at $7700. The day is starting right, men! I have a Sell Stop Order to sell at $8000 if it dips back down to there.
I’m gonna take the garden hoes out of my exhausted pipe and go back inside now 
omg do you guys see the 800 bitcoin?
I used to come here for hope it's becoming very negative 
I sold my position, waiting for the next drop to buy back. Good luck all.
MASSIVE DILDO YOO
A 246 BTC buy wall on GDAX just dissolves like as if it wasn't even there. Fucking useless. Why do people do that? They put it up and then as it gets close they take it down. It doesn't intimidate anyone. The selling side knows it's going to be taken down. The buy side is always broke dick when it comes to those things.
Read that some lost their cash.
Probably deserve it.
Many lambo dreamers got bit in the arse due to greed and borrowed fiat.
Just HODL or get out of the game.
 
You know why its going down so slowly? Because every time, someone tries to guess the bottom, so it will take 6 months of decline to find real bottom. Just stop buying bitcoin and we will find bottom faster.
I'm really guttered I missed out to buy the dip! :'(
Weekly candle closed over the hyperwave trendline at 8096 .... very bullish
Over the resistance at 8300 .... now bumping up against the longtime downward trendline .... very bullish ....
Bitcoin rose with pedestrians rushing to participate as it climbed to its heights. That market segment is gone. Now it's just a speculators chase for bites of volatility before the price is down to actual value, which is low. All the detailed TA comments sound like the stock market did in 2007. It's clearly over. Buying dips now is chasing a falling knife. Buy some equities. 
Lost 3000£ of my hard money on crypto 
Just remember: For everyone who is selling at this price, there's someone who happily buys.
BTC is just going though a bear stage. It will come back to 10K in less than 3 weeks.
My magic 8 ball tells me the gains we have seen in the past four hours is a trap. What does yours say?
Bitcoin bitch slapping alts atm

BTC Dominance at 44.8% and rising.
That order book on GDAX though... Over 3K bitcoin on the buy side down through $7200. That's a lot of resistance to overcome. Granted some of that is probably fake orders that could disappear quick when it gets there, I'd guess most of that is legit. 
West coast checking in.
BTC dominance of Crypto Market: 
December 2017: 55%
January 2018: 33% 
Today: 45% and still increasing

To everyone thinking if BTC is dead, think again. Prices are low but bitcoin is slowly monopolising the market again. This means institutions are dumping their BTC loads and the market is diversifying to smaller investors. This is a good sign for BTC stability. The big guys knew it was going to bottom twice, no market bottoms once and turns into a bull immediately. Stop letting your emotions override you, just be responsible with your investments.
Thanks
Bitcoin dominance is rising... as it should! Almost at 50% 
People need to grow some scones and wait for the bounce at the very least.
Patience... Easter is near... There will be interaction in the global market...
its easy to say just HODL. everyday I'm feeling more and more sicker just seeing this price keep going down. only thing that bring smile on my face some of the memes and gifs. 
ETH is extremely over sold on all daily, 4 hours, and 1 hour charts yet I'm so afraid to buy.

What do you think?
Anyone noticed over the past week there is always a buy order 10.5BTC always about £40-50 above current price?
How far is it going to go before a significant rebound
Serious question: I am very well off financially. I have invested about 1/20th of my annual income into BTC. Do you think it’s stupid to keep it in there right now? 

I’m okay with losing at least 50% of that, with the intention that it will go back up. Do we see bitcoin going to sub 4K honestly? 

I know none of you are financial advisors, but I’m curious how many people are in my situation.  
Question...

If you could get out now and maybe make @$300 of your $1000 investment would you?  
what happened??! LOL 
Here we go. 
Never would I have believed we would be fighting between 8 and 7, these numbers were a distant memory
Ugh such hope for a moment
Platform exchange owners Love it $$$$$$$$$$
This is good shit! If you know the dump is coming you can play the game too  - why shouldn't everyone here be able to  join in and have a dump?
the rise of Sunday ...


I really don't understand what is keeping most of these alts alive when they just follow bitcoins trends to the letter, they exactly follow what bitcoin does so why dont investors look to bitcoin instead?

Just met up with someone for a face-to-face Bitcoin purchase with cash. Glad I didn't get robbed. 
I converted into USDT at $8150, should I hold for awhile longer? What do you guys think the next support line will be.
Sometime in mid April two major trend lines are going converge. Hopefully that’s where a major breakout upwards occurs
I was hoping Europe was going to wake up in a buy happy mood with the change in direction, but it seems they are waking up to sell. :/
This is your last chance to sell at 8k. You will not have this chance 10 days later. Mark my word for it. 
we are going to penetrate the moon 
I've never seen so much fomo. Please be careful, guys.
What seems dangerous for Bitcoin is the very strong fall of the altcoins, more important than Bitcoin. So no one will be able to buy Bitcoin, the fall of the altcoins leads even more to the fall of Bitcoin!
My personal take on what is happening, is all the alt coiner whales are exchanging to BTC and then cashing out to FIAT.  We need all the altcoins to fail before we start to trend up again.   
It's weird how to took the market so long to react to the good news from the G20, seemed to come about 3 hours after the news or this rise has nothing to do with that news?  Who knows! 
Awfully starting to look like last time..
Pumpers can’t even get it over 8.5k? Gonna have to do better than that! 
Bitcoin is officialy dead now.
https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/bitcoins-death-cross-looms-as-strategist-eyes-2800-level-1344825

Maybe my plan to buy from 6.5 down to 6.0 isn't such a good idea after all ....
Might rebounce some now on a shorter time frame, but the upcoming death cross and G20 FUD has become a self-fulfilling prophecy already. 

Hence, I might sell some. I'd rather sell some now and buy back in at $9k+ than to see it drop to $5k, unable to buy back in. That's really the equation right now in my head.
And now the price is going up a bit $200+. Some more pumping before the dump. I’m beginning to think there is something to the whale conspiracy theories!
Noastradamus forgot to take his morning shit. He will be back soon with another prediction.
I guess this has become the hard line for me.  I’ll wait and see what happens and then sell everything at 7k- or buy in with what I sold at 14k? I’m leaning more and more to selling it all.
My friend gave me a Radeon rx480 last year. Would mining bit-coin be a good idea? Will it use up a lot of electricity and be really loud? I'm under 18 and Idk if my mom would get mad if I she thinks my Computer will spontainsly combust. 
this is for your own good bitcoin
*Can someone please be nice and explain how the price will eventually go back up? What if no one cares about crypto currency? I mean half of the world still doesn't even know about it or cares to even put money into it, so how will the price rise? People keep saying the price will skyrocket within a couple months but HOW???? What if everyone stops believing in Bitcoin and sells everything. Bitcoin is not even being brought about, mainstream wise, so how will others wants to invest in it? I keep thinking that no one will want to put their money into it because they think it is a scam or just simply because they need their money rn and they don't want to waste their time.*
Pumped back up to $7400 so big dump coming in a couple of hours. 

Shits getting way too predictable but so easy to trade. 
[TRUE HODLERS NEVER GIVE UP!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7un2db/hodlers_currently/)
Hope everyone got the dip
If we start posting suicidal posts will the whales show us mercy?
Hi moon
For our final course of the weekend, we’ll be serving a major dump 
Is this the final bait?
We did it boys. Keep up with the memes.
Well, there went my payday loan... I gotta get to the track... keep an eye on things while I am gone.
Afraid I wasn’t going to be able to eat tonight. 
Lulz
Wtf was that green dildo?
to all those who sold the bottom let this be a lesson to just HODL. don't gamble by trying to predict the market. It could go back down but could also go up 10% tomorrow no one knows. 
Sell now and regret later..
if you sell now i will stab you, we all worked hard creating this gigantic dick 
Fuck cryptomining it's destroying the gamer market why the hell are those things made with gpus.
Everybody is reassured this is a double bottom so we won't go lower than 6k. But than it would not be capitulation, so logic dictates BTC will go to 1-2k
Charts show 5k coming soon.
Can this be linked to Russian president elections?  The green dildo appeared the minute he was announced the president again... Can the bitcoins be used by his corrupted oligarchs and system and now they pumped some elections stolen money into bitcoin and out of the country?
The dip is over guys !

Buy now if you're waiting to buy.
bitcoin is done
$5900 - $6500 is maximum dip. Then we will go to moon within 2 months.
Remember when bitcoin goes up it goes wAy up 
I’m assuming the “hold” people are not holding anymore? 🤢😛
I have about $850 in coinbase. How much would it cost me in fees to sell out? 
Dawg the g20 meetings haven’t even happened. This is clearly manipulation 
[deleted]
g20 meeting hasn't even happened and price already on the rise? Either this is inside trading or a whale is buying to cover their position. 
OK now the trip downhill starts.. see u under 7.5k

bitcoin is delaying an inevitable crash to 7k 
if you have money on the sidelines and have not bought at least a little right now you are crazy.  
Anyone think we’ll see <7,000 by tomorrow?
Todays bitcoin price hardly matters. It dropped from 8000 to 7500. So what if it falls 3%, by the year 2021 btc will be 1,200,000 each. Buy it now while its low. Why people are selling bitcoin i have no idea. Short selling sure, but not holding any btc? Crazy mistake.
Tether -> stoploss @ 8k -> pls bitcoin dont come and get my stoploss edit: yes i believe it will go up again (and in the tech, ofcourse)
[deleted]
Red dildo incoming 
get some money...
...end the DIP...

:(
Who sold and got rekt? Be honest.
Guys I called this recent drop to the minute. My next prediction is that we are really close to the bottom if not already there. The charts look like it wants to retouch at 6k but I predict it will bounce just above. We will not see any 6k bitcoin for the near future. Nostradamus has spoken.
[deleted]
[deleted]
[deleted]
Where do you see it bottom out finally? my guess 2-3K midterm and then accumulation period before next run
6k€ wall was fake...
well, the dip is over.
Dont get emotional, guys. 

The big fish are buying right now. Just hodl.
