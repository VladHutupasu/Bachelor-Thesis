I've never seen bitcoin price stay this straight for a long time. It's as straight as a horizontal line, it's a straight as my gender
I have studied that line for several hours now, and I finally came to the conclusion that the price can go either up OR down.
Meanwhile, over in the naughty corner:

- Bcash perilously close to declining further to ‡∏ø0.09

- Bcash is hard-forking itself to a 32MB block size, even though its volumes are now so poor it doesn't even need 1MB.

- There could potentially be 2 versions of Bcash after their self-imposed and silly fork.  Let's call them Bcash Core and Bcash Cash.
(pokes it with a stick)
I am contemplating the famous saying "be greedy when there is fear in the market" ....

So simple yet so unnatural to act upon...
I posted this deeper in a comment thread,  it's important so I'll kind of repost up here:

"BTCUSDSHORTS" on Bitfinexis BS and it's not true short selling. It's some synthetic representation of buy interest vs sell interest, total hocum IMHO.

A short sale is when you borrow a share from an exchange, and sell it immediately.
You have to give that share back to the exchange at some point. When the price goes down, you buy a share on the open market, return it to the exchange 'covering your short'. You sell high, and buy low so you profit, instead of the reverse, buy low sell high.

* Shorting in the equities market is regulated and controlled.
* An exchange will only lend you the share if you have other assets in the exchange to cover incase you never return the share. Only the better exchange clients are approved to short typically.
* Exchanges have to accurately report how many shares they have lent out to short sellers.
* The only skin in the game for the exchange is the trading fees, which in a short sale is a double whammy, the exchange is guaranteed two fees.

Now in the unregulated crypto markets, the exchanges are NOT required to report coins lent for short sale.

Factor in that crypto started crashing almost as soon as the first CME options started trading, (options are NOT short selling). They gave a clear indication no one was very interested taking the short side of an option, hence little short interest was observed.

To a professional short seller, little short interest in a market in an obvious speculative bubble was a dream come true, and they borrowed and sold, crashing the market.

Bitcoin Shorts are hitting an all time high while the market swallows their shorted coins: https://www.tradingview.com/chart/tXd4V5lS/

If BTC can make a run, the shorts are going to suffer immensely.  Should be epic if we can get a whale to step up and get the bids started...

Soooo the price manipulation is getting a little ridiculous. The jagged jumps and dips... So natural! But seriously WTF?
Who fell for the bull trap at 7.5k btc few days ago, and what was your thought process for buying in?
Once the reality that we are at or close to bottom sinks in there is going to be a rush of smart money back in that‚Äôs going to shock a lot of people.  The question is, how soon. 
When the US wake up and see the Bitcoin for $6580, will that make them buy at a perceived good bargain or panic sell?
Is this Black Friday?
Shorts at ATH's.  cmon ppl this is gonna be epic get the popcorn ready
so this is how bitcoin will bottom out - with sideways movement
lol reading through these old memes: https://www.google.ca/search?q=bitcoin+sideways+meme&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjn08b7rabaAhVHd6wKHcs9DQkQ_AUoAXoECAAQAw&biw=1440&bih=746#imgrc=_
LOL, what a response to Indian FUD, Tim Draper said that Bitcoin should be the national currency of India (not Rupee).... 
Hey everyone!  Just got home and noticed that Bitcoin has flatlined all day (since I went to bed).  If someone could get some AED shock paddles and revive Bitcoin, that would be great!
That‚Äôs a really exciting line 
imagine if you wake up tomorrow and prices still stay like this, that would be legendary. 
fuck. yes.
It's Aliiiiive! Buy now! 
It goes every Fri even like clockwork
Man this last few months sure have cut down on hodl posts, last time when it hit 6k there was so many of them.

I guess many of hodlers sold or are so bummed out they don't even bother until there is 500$ pump than they squeal to the moon few times and go silence again. 
I‚Äôm really getting kind of annoyed at all the cock throbbing ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt like the tech bro?‚Äù type people. We put money into this so called tech and all it‚Äôs doing is shitting the bed. We are allowed to be angry and you can shut the fuck up about the tech, because yeah sure, it sounds great, but I‚Äôm still pissed I‚Äôm losing money now. Should I be like, ‚Äúhell yeah! Still in the red since December! I love bitcoin!‚Äù Because no thank you. I‚Äôm allowed to be salty. 
Reading this thread (and so many others) depressed me. We bought bitcoin back in the day to buy and sell stuff without going through banks and paying fiat. It was cool to have digital cash and buy shit online you couldn‚Äôt buy with fiat. Silk Road etc was why we bought it-we were part of the decentralised future-buying bitcoin was anarchic-we were cyberpunks! Now it‚Äôs just about the fucking money and lambos and bullshit. We made money in December because we invested in something we believed in and got lucky but we still have bitcoin because we believe in s future not controlled by big banks and the man! Fucking grow up and stop worrying about the price in $. It‚Äôs about being able to bypass the system and do what we want. Bitcoin is still the future-relax and enjoy the ride üòé

Bitcoin is turning me into a top athlete. Every time I'm frustrated with the price I go for a run. I'm running marathons here....
easy baby don't wake the bearss
It's still in the wedge and has yet to break.
We can't expect new money till we at least get back to 10 K I would imagine. Unless we raise the money on our own to attract new adapters I certainly don't expect change.
welcome aboard Mr. Taxman's wild ride,  keep your seatbelts fastened,  keep your hands inside the cart at all times,  here we go.............
So either off a cliff or to the moon from the point 
with such a linear price, it would be easy to use in everyday transactions?
u guys dont like flatline, here comes the drop
lol someone tries to dump and the bots buy it back up to the exact same price wtf
We go through here it's the end of the the pain...

https://www.tradingview.com/x/wHHQpndW
All im thinking is... sunday and monday is coming, expecting the usual drop off into the mariana trench.
The pumps are so short now because bitcoin has erectile disfunction. 
we‚Äôre getting real close to my breaking point. This is absolute bullshit and I am getting ready to walk away and never look back.
LPT: it's less convincing if you're writing an essay convincing people why BTC is undervalued. If you're so confident about it eventually going to the moon, you want it to fall so you can accumulate unless you just trying to pump and dump. 

I really don't understand why people who are so confident that something is undervalued would want to pump it up so quickly. If anything you want it to stay undervalued. Then again...how does one value crypto...

But frealz..why is BTC $6k and not $1?
Another day, another drop. Time to get my buy orders ready.
So i sold at 7800 on the way down. How much longer do i wait before buying back in?
Ummm... it just me or does it appear BTC is trying to maintain $6666?    

Whoever is doing this, please stop-it.

sub 5.5k by the end of next week
What experiences do people have with buying from BITMAIN?

E.g.  How long did it take to ship (preferrably Europe), how much import tax did you pay, some problems to watch out for? Thank you :)
Anybody know if there's a site that shows large buy orders or sell orders? 

I'd like to eliminate a lot of the noise with these .001 orders.
Whales aren't going to make much money if it keeps dropping. I'd not be so sure about 4k. 
Just looking around at the markets in full on a 1 yr chart:  
Volume up in gold and silver, crude
Volume down in bitcoin, stocks (or flat depending on chart).
The tide might be changing.
Don‚Äôt think shorting Btc is never going to stop. Especially with stupid cme futures. It‚Äôs all bad. 
How has the price remained near static for hours?
Somebody just took a huge dump 
That was fun to watch
Don‚Äôt cut yourself short.  Let me enjoy this beer and watch some good pump 
Is a twap!
I dunno about y‚Äôall but I would party hardy and throw in on some coin at 6900 
üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª
Well at least my heart beat 
See 6900 is another head fake. Down to the danger zone again.
Friday = pump day right?
Hi friends! I'm Bitgur.com developer. It's modern and useful cryptocurrency price index site.  

We added night mode. Could anybody take a look and tell me impressions? Thank you in advance. :)

If you look at the chart since December 15th, it's heading straight into the toilet.
The interest rate on unpaid Federal tax is determined and posted every three months. It is the federal short‚Äìterm interest rate plus 3 percent. Interest is compounded daily. 

There are certain hodlers that are crunching the numbers right now,  trying to decide to eat the non payment penalty and start paying Uncle Sam daily for the privilege of hodling.    

It will be a bit crazy until the 16th or 17th,  but afterwords,  look forward to continued selling pressure,  the WORST kind,  slow, drawn out, maddening!
Is this where all of the part-time TA experts hang out?
[deleted]
for everyone that has a boner over that small pump.  Zoom out into the daily 7500 is the next line in the sand.  til then bear market.....
I think there is an equilibrium of sorts.  Run of the mill bulls and bears tussle at the current equilibrium,  then a large short is covered,  and the equilibrium is upset,  but eventually returns.

What really sucks for you guys is that one of the most important pieces of information you need to at least have a fighting chance to day trade,  you don't have!  

How many coins have the exchanges lent to short sellers?   How many have been returned (shorts covered)?  How fast is the ratio between the two changing,  etc.  You need to know that if you are going to succeed as a small investor in a big pond with big (shorting) fish.

You don't know because crypto exchanges are not required to report it.   The SEC figured out a long time ago that not reporting short sales was disadvantageous to the small investor,  and they regulated it.   

I have now formed a new opinion,  BTCUSDSHORT on bitfinex (the exchange that recently stepped in major dog doo, another thread),  is an attempt to divert attention away from their short lending practices.   If a noob somehow stumbles across the concept of shorting and asks,  bitfinex has an answer , "short interest,  ah, here's this index we cooked up,  it has the word short in it,  this IS the droid you are looking for!".  It is not.

So ,  there is really no way to predict where things might go, everyone is flying blind.  Also keep in mind,  TA evolved 100% in the age of short sale disclosure requirements.  Applying TA to a market that is not transparent regarding short sales is probably not going to work,  IMHO.

Good luck everyone,  I think you'll need it!






this is the bottom. BUY BUY BUY!!!
were MOONING bois strap in

This is not the beginning of the end, gentlemen.

This is the end of the beginning.

Stand by.
What is lowest and highest amount you paid for Bitcoin. To start myself I) LOW = $6590 II) HIGH = $9425 or III) Waiting to buy first bitcoin (waiting for bottom) Note no need to post BTC amount just price paid in USD for comparison. 
Pumpity Dumpkins!
Lets have some opinions.....how long until we get to over $10k? 
Whale formations buying in ? (8pm CST)
I realized there is a new generation of FUDs and Trolls on this sub now. Many new names but same strategy. 
Man, fuck this *sideways trading* shit. I want whales, up and down. All the time!
7k never again
Bitcoin is dying? Ha. Fiat is dying a slow and painful death, the collapse of the Fiat dollar is inevitable. Why did you get into crypto? If you came only for 'moon' and 'lambos' you may not see the bigger picture. In the end, when it all comes crashing down, whether it's BTC, real estate, or precious metals, it's good to own and hold items with a use case and of scarcity, instead of toilet paper fiat dollars mass-printed at a whim to fund false government promises and a warfare/welfare machine. The future of Bitcoin is still open and is up to all of us. The future of fiat is predestined, and it does not end well.

Whenever we get to 6800 it just means it will not hold...How come we are getting to 6800 all the time?
The date I'm waiting for is April 11, I really hope something huge happens. Here's why:

I'm probably wrong but who knows.
Could someone please elaborate if the number of shorts I am seeing on www.tradingview.com, which is quite high as compared to previous months, has much of a significance in terms of bitcoin near future price? u/theFoot58

good girl
She likes it
I've been lurking on this forum anonymously during this entire bear market and I must say most of you guys are completely delusional when it comes to price analysis. And in my fair opinion you deserve to loose all your money. Most of you guys are bagholding and got trapped with the holder mentality which makes 0 sense. Anyways most of you already left reddit and moved on. Smart money sold the top and will be back on capitulation and they will sell again once you suckers flock back in. Use your time to learn technical analysis instead of making hodlers memes.
As we go on..... we remember...... all the good times..... we had together........ *lights in the air* RIP BTC
This is the last time you will see BTC under 7k. April will be the start of the run all the way through to December again. 
Are yall ready to dip past 6400! It should happen in less than 8 hours.

My short positions can't wait, I've been waiting 2 days for the price to budge, and now we've finally got enough momentum going!!
Just in case anyone is wondering why the price is doing what its doing:
Those moves are 100% correlating with the amount of shorts being added/closed right now. You can check for yourself and see that when the price pumped in the exact same time frame, about 3k btc short positions were closed aka bought back on bitfinex.
Dont be fooled guys - nobody is selling to the shorters atm and they need to buy back at some point
**George Soros set to trade cryptocurrencies - Bloomberg**

(Reuters) - George Soros's $26 billion hedge fund is planning to trade cryptocurrencies, Bloomberg reported on Friday, months after the billionaire investor called the virtual currency a bubble.

Adam Fisher, who oversees macro investing at the New York-based Soros Fund Management, got internal approval to trade digital assets in the last few months, though was yet to make a wager, the report https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-06/george-soros-prepares-to-trade-cryptocurrenceis said, citing people familiar with the matter.

A Soros representative declined to comment.

The financial world has been divided about betting on bitcoin <BTC=BTSP>, a digital token.

Billionaire Warren Buffett and JPMorgan's <JPM.N> Jamie Dimon have said they will not invest in cryptocurrencies, while Wall Street banks Morgan Stanley <MS.N> and Goldman Sachs <GS.N> have been open to clearing bitcoin futures.

Last year, Soros's hedge fund took an 8.99 percent stake in Overstock.com Inc <OSTK.O> to become the third-largest shareholder in the online retailer. The shares of the company surged when its unit held an initial coin offering.
Mate I have hardly any myself-I spent most of it online before it was worth $ and then made some cash when it went mental but that‚Äôs just luck-still buying stuff online when I can because it‚Äôs so cool to buy something with BTC!!! Love it üòç 
Damn you, Bitcoin! Slow down! You're going to upset the whales!!!! 
I have my stop-buy-limit order just above resistance. Let's see if we break it. So far, prices are back to what they were this morning, which is a start. 
oh nice I wasn't expecting this
Lower. There's no support anywhere. It's all manipulation. :)
Doesn't matter if BTC has no real value. Remember:
https://imgur.com/a/xzZRm

HODL - Warren Buffettt HODLs and he is very rich - doesn't matter that he hodls tangible assets which produces value YOY, Bitcoin is a new paradigm that produces value out of internet magic! HODL HODL!
I beleive bitcoin needs test the $0k support so we can start to see an incline in the price. lol You guys are weird when the price is going down you buy and hodl when the price is going up you buy and sell its easy. So right now we are in a bear market its fine if you are losing money but you should not be losing coins, That is were alot of people mess up because they are losing money and coins lol pick one or the other in a bear market.
For those impatient with the current state of the market John Mcafee has this to say:


>Patience young man. Let me remind you of a legendary story: The young bull says to the old bull - "Let's run down to the field and fuck one of the cows". The old bull says- "Let's walk down and fuck them all".



- John Mcafee Twitter 4/4/18
You don't buy Bitcoin because of the price, you buy because you understand and are a fan of the technology.  The price and potential financial gains of being an early adopter are just a result of being an early adopter. Late Adopters get the benefit not the gains.  If you understand this then you can survive the storms and will be more comfortable with your capital risk tolerance

See you then.
If you boys and girls are serious about the crypto game. We need to bring on new investors. Friends family, relatives, your worst enemies, the gang members down the block. Everyone has a handle, figure it out, use it, and spread awareness.

Apparently this is why the gun debate always looses in America, cuz we win on the home front. Now I can neither confirm nor deny, but it sounds palusible.

Any exposure is good exposure is good exposure, stickers, posters graffiti, porn. You name it, get on it. Don't worry about what they say or their laughter, if you just keep hounding the point home they will eventually see things your way. (Usually at the next ATH unfortunately)

I'm not saying to scam them of course, educate them on the risks and make sure they don't go all in, but make sure they either buy, or discuss it with the next person. That is the only way we can prevail..numbers.
