Did anybody see that scumbag Ver is removing BTC as a default wallet on his website. (Not going to name it here).

This guy does nothing but deceive people into buy a shitcoin so that he can make money. Does nothing but talk about how "adoption is increasing" while they barely fill a 10th of a MB per block. Such a deceptive piece of shit.
I guess this is why the stock market doesn't open on the weekends, to prevent drunk people from selling off for no reason
So many drama queens in here it's funny!  We have gone down about $200-$250....just chill the fuck out!  :)
Interesting market right now. So many moving averages are converging. I guess the bots are as clueless as we are on how to proceed from here on...
This is quite rare in global markets. All quiet on the western front. Mexican standoff. Don't nobody breathe.
Amazing how a market can just drop 5 billion in overall value in just 1 min. Kinda hoped it would gain 5 billion in 1 min not drop :P
Fasten your seatbelts.
well I can't say I did not expect this to happen. 
Weekend Dip...
There's a lot of complaining. I understand, but truly I'm grateful that bitcoin is bouncing around 7.4k and 11k at least. That's a solid foundation.
I would like to commence today's proceeding by saying:

Woopah Malta!
I'm looking at the 1hr on gdax.  

Volume in the 7-8pm Mar 23 up move 8.65k-8.92k 1369BTC

Volume in the 5-6pm down move 8.95k-8.62k 1389BTC.

Literally within $20-30 on price at both ends and 20BTC on volume.    

Says a hell of a lot about the state of at least the gdax market (basically balanced buy/sell wise) within this 8.6-8.9k range.  I have not pulled up cryptowat.ch and looked at the other exchanges in the same time frame yet.

EDIT ADD:  Looking at Bitfinex  https://cryptowat.ch/markets/bitfinex/btc/usd/1hr - Almost identical in price, 3375 BTC on the way up, 4760 BTC on the way down.  I'm inclined to think we just put a double top in here ~9k and we should expect a move to 8.4k.  If 8.2-8.4k can't hold we may revisit 7.3k.
"a pleasent Saturday here in America,  the market seems to have settled,  I think I'll look away and go finally have some fun with my weekend."

Dr. Evilwhale: initiate dump 
Good day. 
Good today
Awaiting Goldbergger's daily predictions. The one that doesn't end up getting deleted is usually the one that comes true.
Well, that was underwhelming. Seems we are in a standoff again.

Where’s Goldberg 
so is no one going to mention this dip or what 
down down prices are down, just broke local support
n o S T R A d a m.....ssssssss
Every dip offers new chances. I think the best way is to work with two Pool, one for HODL, and one for daytrading. Now are Day Trading times. I think this up and down will  go on for a time. 
Newbie here. Can someone explain what exactly is happening when the price dips 500 dollars quickly all of the sudden? Did someone just sell a lot of it? How much? 
Should rename this thread to **Daily FUD**
And so it begins: Sunday Bloody Sunday :S
Seems like a good day very unusual in crypto world. 
A little early to call it a breakout, but we're getting close. Looking at the one year chart. Seems to look like a large triangle. Very thin market for Bitcoin. Next few days (hours?) could be kinda interesting.
Can you feel it?
Fomo is real today.
Yeah fuck you whales where ever you at.
Sometimes I wonder: Is a "Whale" something like "Bigfoot"?
above 8.5k by the end of sunday and we will good for the new week (hopefully no fud then)
China's new central-bank chief, Yi Gang, promised to implement changes quickly, saying “there will be a series of reform and opening-up measures” during the next three weeks.

Pump in the next week, after this, the announcement: the chinese regulation. If it really happens, so we gonna have a rally at April.
Hmm..the old trick knee is acting up, the bulls are tramping to go!  PUMP IT!!
another day in bitcoin, +5% increase and then a -5% decrease.
https://twitter.com/Blockstream/status/977644693965045760
and now we are going down, bitcoin, you are so predictable nowadays
Anyone know what cryptos will be supported by the crypto-fiat pairing on Binance?
[deleted]
Vegeta incoming?
The door is open for us to hit $9k within the next few hours! 
Hey Goldbergger, I added a #10 for you

"Just like most people here now, I believe $7500-$8000 is coming soon. All signs pointing to it.

1) Death Cross coming soon

2) Not enough volume

3) Weekend sell off - people cashing out.

4) Japan FUD still has residual selling

5) Anytime some FUD like above happens, other governments or institutions usually jump in trying to bring the price down even further in attempts to take down bitcoin, although they fail to do that, it would affect the price to go down much more.

6) Still below 200 day and not able to cross above 9000 with multiple tries

7) Downtrend still hasn't finished.

8) Just look at the 1 hour candle chart on GDAX. It showed a brief reversal momentum, but now continues downward again. Even the 6 hour and day candles show the same, at least for short term.

9) Many other reasons.


10) 3 hours later I will look like a complete moron
erm, guys...https://blockchain.info/address/16rCmCmbuWDhPjWTrpQGaU3EPdZF7MTdUk?sort=0
humpty dumpty had a great fall... (just now)
I'm really upset with how hard it is to use bitcoin as a payment. Everybody's up in arms about the price, yet they don't realize what a shitshow it is when trying to use it for its intended use.

Trying to buy a laptop. Went to Newegg and found what I wanted only to find out that their 'bitcoin accepted!' is through fucking bitpay and their bullshit payment protocol code, which my wallet (samourai) doesn't accept.

Thought about buying a gift card for amazon or newegg from Gyft or a similar site. All of which requires me to transfer my coins back to coinbase and then I have to authorize the site (with a daily limit worth hundreds of dollars of btc) to take the money from my account.

This not what bitcoin was meant to be. We have a lot of work to do.
I suggest for people to study several of the top altcurrencies and their market depth, examine where traders expect, or intend, to sell and buy. Traders bought BTC heavily at 7.5k and appear to have sold a decent amount at 9k. Some traders may have sold at 8.3k-8.8k. Considering the low volumes, I'd say that trader impact is fairly high at the moment. My observation is that there is more sell pressure than buying pressure at this point and the descent volumes have been overall higher than the ascent volumes recently.

My speculation is that the most active participants right now, traders of various kinds, are waiting for at least 8k-8.5k until they rebuy. The more patient traders probably look for 7.5k-8k.

I have been wrong many times so far so don't pay attention to my speculation. However, check the market depth of both bitcoin and major altcoins yourself and make up your own mind based on the data that is available. While I had preferred to observe an upswing to 10k soon, that's not what I see yet. Add the tax season with bitcoin and altcoin owners needing to make sure to finish paying their taxes, which adds some sell pressure.

As a counterbalance to my observation, a number of miners probably will have a decent resistance to sell below 8.5k-9k. As a result, the resistance might be strong enough to keep the price over 8.5k. It is also possible that some traders might want to pump up the price to 9.5k-10k before selling, so don't take my speculation as investment advice. If the resistance is strong enough at 8.5k, then traders might have to adapt to the situation and reconsider their strategies. If not, I'd say that 8k is definitely a possibility. I doubt to see any prices below 7.5k though.
It's funny, almost like the world just held hands and said "stop trading on GDAX for a few". Even the 5m chart is full of vacant space where the market was just frozen. *twilight zone music plays*
Prepare those $9,000 memes boys and girls!
We got out of the 3-days downtrend channel [red] and the road to 9k is paved but I'm not going to claim victory until we break through the monthly downtrend line [orange], which would require 9.5k by monday.

fomo + weekend + TA = no investment today (for me)

Some  alts are already springing like fresh tulips, help me Lord to stay disciplined ...

they are coming...

with big horns....

the bulls....
What's with these gaps on Gdax? Can anyone explain? 
Still too early to tell. Looks like a breakout continuing to form and gaining ground very, very slowly.
In Binance BTC/USDT pair, the price went to 8999.95. Never felt so deceived and heart broken. Seems like been waiting for that 9000 mark forever.

No means No... except if you’re a whale!!!
Welcome to another edition of "Pump or Dump?".

We are closing in to another jump. Place your bets if it will go up or down...
No moon
What can be done to give bitcoin a less volatile value?
What color lambo are you guys gona get? I'm thinking electric blue 
Have the traders gone on holiday today?
I get it guys, were all waiting to make money. But shouldn't we talk about ways to help crptocurrencies become actual viable currencies?
Is there a place to sell crypto domains for bitcoins? I've been trying to google it but cannot find anything.
Now between 8900 and 9k. Very thin market. Down to a hundred bucks.
What in the world is happening to BNB?

edit: ah the Malta news
For those interested in following charts, we're now moving within the borders of this wedge, which will break one direction or the other within tomorrow this hour.

edit: broken way before than I expected. 
A slight rise across the boards.

Lots of good news in the past couple of days, but not much climbing to show for it. 
why so many people desperate for sell? 
What’s preventing everyone from making a run on the bank so to speak ?
boredom and despair.... I hope easter's gonna bring something...
with future trading so far all the traders who have taken a long position would have done their money so you would think future trading will take a dive and not affect BTC to the  same degree in the coming months
Yesterday was a pump for STORM, today Binance coin, other coins are red,it is not difficult to guess where the artificial pumping comes from
Such a relaxing sunday!!
Today was snow in Vancouver (((
Q1. Please fill in the blank (10 points). 

When US wakes up, it will ___________ . 
Personally, whilst keeping an eye on the BTC price, I am hoping the girl in my building will come and cook me breakfast as promised, and it will turn into sex.
And tether is spending the first 70m of the 300 m...70m got added to the circulating supply on the 22nd. Guess what...price go up.
Volume is extremely low and may get less. We appear to be at the point of a large triangle. Not a market to be in right now. The tension mounts...
Breakout. Downwards...
despite  has lot of good news this dip make no sense ..seems like market manipulation or Mt Gox sell not done yet
Whales sunk bitcoins 90 minutes ago, attacking it by dumping at 8400 since then it ran on quicksand.
yawn
The only confidence that you can have in bitcoin is that the whales and exchanges won’t let their cash cow go into freefall, at least not yet 
Looks like we going down to $8000 sorry boys whales are playing with us
Whomever is selling are all running 24/7 operations,  they know it's them against the individual hodlers.  The individual can't watch 24/7 and react,  and the sellers know this.  They wait for a lull in trading, and inattention.   My guess is somehow the sellers figured by now,  people are fatigued,  it's a popular day in the west to recreate and socialize,  and many will be away from their screens, out of the way!

Insidious bastards!


All the amateurs who jump to buy everytime bitcoin scratches near 9000 will get burned when it drops back below 8700 because then they sell and the cycle continues and eventually will have no fiat left to invest when the 'real bull run' starts...

We're still in the weekend, last week of the month, there isn't enough volume, just a few milking profits out of the amateurs who FOMO in as soon as the price comes in arms length of 9000 and then get burned over and over...

The ones like DeballeravanAntwerpen claim 'TA is useless....it's all about emotion". Ignorance is bliss because TA is based a lot on emotion.
HODL - Holding On Despite Logic.
I’d halt from buying until we begin recovering from the dip we’ll see in the next few days due to Asia’s regulations

Pullback to approx 8000 underway, followed by final bounce to approx 9500, and then crash to approx 4000.

This is my game plan, I am expecting BTC to break above 9K today and by the end of the weekend could be at 10K and on monday I think a nice push higher to when this recent down move began at about 10600 which is where I will start trimming my position. From there I expect price to pull in but don't have any idea where it will bottom out so I will start to build a small position and have ample cash on hand to slowly build up my position again. then MOON
Are we ever gonna get past 9k today??? 😖
on the way to 9800. crucial point. if we break that wall, we will go like a rocket in the coming weeks, with a small correction in the meantime. if we don't break through the 9800 then we fall back to 6300
Mark my words.
By the looks of it, binance will be shutting down its operations in hong kong with no choice but to move to malta that houses much lighter exchange regulations

We'll be testing 7,5k waters soon unfortunately
sell
