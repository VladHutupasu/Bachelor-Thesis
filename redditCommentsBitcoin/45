Daily Discussion, April 09, 2018
Someone just decided that "nope, Bitcoin shouldn't recover". Impressive drop.
I love when people post the graphs and say "this is why it's going up/down". It makes me think of religious fanatics trying to convert.

No one knows where the price will be tomorrow. There is no big whale selling. There's numbers on a screen. The spoon doesn't bend. I am you, and we are me. We all return to the egg. Break free of the charts before their trend lines bind your wrist and cloud your mind. Find peace! 
Holy crap!! Down $350 in minutes! That was interesting to watch on GDAX.
To the moon..
I wouldnt doubt if a large amount or a few millionaire keep buying bit coin. Sell when hit hits 7-8k then all dump at one time and keep doing it over and over to keep it in check.
Thou shall not pass!
Everything will be good in the end. And if it's not good then it's not the end. 

(read with indian accent)
I'm getting worried about Mcafee's dick now.
Aaaand we are down (again)...
I swear everytime the price is green and I see a comment that says "going to the moon" the price goes down. Y'all be jinxing it
GOODBYE CRUEL WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Market manipulation like these are casting a dark shadow over cryptocurrencies market. I saw yesterday on Bitfinex some market spoofing around 6 p.m. UTC time.. 
why I am saying this? Because first of all, bitcoin came as a result on market manipulation, corrupt banking system and widespread injustice on financial market back in 2008.
Recently, it was often heard that cryptocurrencies markets do not need a regulation, and it was raising a red flag to me. Because it is like saying we do not need cops.. well, guess who will come then, and who would rule? Yes, gangs and criminals.
Well, with such liquid market and possible high gains, it was a call to those kinds of people.. and cryptocurrency society didn't do anything to regulate itself, but instead of that, YT is full of videos tagged with #Lambo, #toTheMoon, etc..

I personally think this is a last call to regulate things properly, or hand over those markets to various sharks and people like Soros, Rotschild, Rockefeller and others. 
This trend is never gonna stop if everyone is just sitting on the side waiting for a miracle. The whales found their new strategy. The price is just gonna go sideways with sudden pumps/dumps everyday. 
What has been the longest bear market in Bitcoin?
To all of you saying these massive dumps that occur within a few minutes are normal market movements, you are wrong. Unless you consider market wide manipulation by groups with deep pockets to be 'normal'. This would be illegal in almost every other market. The same people probably flick through these threads laughing at everyone's stupidity and how easy it is for them to make money. 
The manipulation isn’t even subtle at this point. 

Just an organic plunge out of nowhere with no bad news right? 
ripperoni 4k lets go
When will we see any light at the end of the tunnel? 
Trading Analysis:

That long flat bit today is a slightly higher than that long flat bit the other day:

Bullish!!!
Finally some action - for better or worse.

If that's not manipulation, then what? Classic spoofing scheme.
What most you you folks think, whats the future of btc? 
Well my holdings have officially halved. Great. 
It's hard not to despise many of the people on this subreddit who seem to think that Bitcoin only exists for them to become rich through speculation.
I hate to say it because I’ve been in crypto for over a year and believe decentralized currency can better the world’s concept of money but the everyday masses and their money will not return until this blatant obvious manipulation by a few somehow ends. The market is being decimated by it. If some sort of self regulatory body and at the very least a few restrictions on manipulation isn’t put in place 
the market will not go mainstream and flourish. 
I gave in.  Tethered up at 6700...with my luck now watch it go up.  It's kind of weird now actually wanting bitcoin to go down.  First time taking this route.  
Is it just me or does it feels like Mondays are the new Sundays when it comes to bitcoin?
I couldn’t lose more money in a short amount of time if I were at an upscale gentlemen’s club. I went to bed feeling upbeat.
These pumps and dumps are absolutely disgusting. Another reason to hate humanity.
At least the volumes are back...
i've been away on a world tour fudding other crypto sub reddits... what have I missed here?
I don't like to have an upset tummy over dinner with these prices wobbling up and down, so what I do is have a quick look at this 8 year span logarithmic scale before heading off to my club    :)

snooze fest, where is elmer fudd?
so much sideways movement
Thats a clean red dildo
ouch, that dump was quick and slick
ok, I am looking at situation on Bitfinex, but similar happens on another exchanges AFAIK. Huge sell orders... a moment ago they were removed, and the price spiked up...
a moments after that, a new sell order have been placed (800-1200 BTCs). 
As this is happening on another exchanges, to me it looks like bots programmed at the same way. Who would have such amount of BTCs and such intentions to drop the market? 
The Bcash guys got back the Bitcoin twitter account. Weird.

I'd love to buy pizza with my BTC, is possible?
31567.48 Longs v.s. 35868.28 Shorts on Bitfinex atm.
when ~~moon~~ the 17.000.000 btc is expected? 
Pizza
large scale manipulation...silly market...
Not sure why most in here are against stop losses. Everyone who had it set at 7k saved themselves a nice bit of coin.

My first TA and price prediction. What do you guys think?
Am I the only one perfectly fine with the price staying at these levels? That way I can buy more now while its low. I'm confident that bitcoin will be worth a lot more some time in the future and I'm patient enough to wait for that. The fundamentals have not changed, we havn't even had any serious fud in a while, in fact weve had a lot of good news.
So I just read that George soros is manipulating the market...... Great.

Coming from a forex trading background. Currencies normally trade sideways for 90% of the time. Trends for the remaining 10%. Of course trading currencies(I mean traditional pairs like EUR/USD or AUD/USD) normally at least one of the 7 majors is trending. Now crypto is similar most of the time it is range bound then off it goes on a trend. However it is very hard to find a trending crypto while the rest are range bound as they all follow BTC's lead. So you have to recognise when they are range bound and trade accordingly. (Whew that was a lot of typing)
Just remember, when someone states that BTC has no intrinsic value- That you the holder of BTC is the intrinsic value as opposed to a group of people putting their trust into another institution which is completely necessary for government to work. BTC gives YOU a way to check all of that.
Unless something big happens in Bitcoin, this is just going to keep going down.
Ok everyone before you flip a lid we are not done on the down side and on the TA we have not fully formed a double bottom til 6k.  Can't take the heat stay out of crypto
Meanwhile, over on the naughty step:

Strangely quiet over at r/btc

More whingeing about losing the Twitter handle

Something about LN being shit.  

Usual stuff.  

Really rather quiet.  Maybe they're all over here  :)
I'm sick of hearing all this absolute shit about manipulation and "bad news" making the price drop. These pump and dumps is just normal day trading combined with people that have never invested before shitting themselves only to buy back in later, rinse and repeat. You're making it so easy for the rest of us to make money on these swings when you know half the market will panic sell at a $100 drop in price.
What just happened to the price? It dropped like $600 in a matter of moments - who sold so much and how much was sold?
Bitcoin just dropped by $350 .... any idea what happened 
It failed to break resistance, that's the trigger of all the weak hands. It will be fine, relax.
can send money from a segwit address to a legacy address?
Any idea what those manipulators at Bitfinex are trying to do? They did at least 5 spikes from friday night till sunday, spoofing with 1,000 btc orders, and then they suddenly started to sell pushing it bellow 6,700 and spoofing in the other side. WTF! 

See a lot of ppl claiming price manipulation and the may be right based on what we saw on bitfinex.

But I'd like to remind people that it's common place for day traders to short following bad news, especially if we're at a Shakey breakout. 

The news from Pakistan is likely what caused this. plus, India is still in recent mind, all this is probably what's giving the shorters the courage to sell.
What are the current transaction times like? I’ve been waiting for over an hour and still unconfirmed. I thought this issue had been resolved. 
Funny thing is, nobody knows if it's gonna fall or rise suddenly right now. 
Wall 6600 appears unbreachable. 
Set a limit order for .01 BTC at 6.5k... I’m just a protozoan swimming in a whales’ ocean. 
I done my little part - bought at 6,650.  

Will buy more at 6.6, 6.55 and 6.5.
Until I discovered this message board I had no idea the Bitcoin world was in this state. Seems like everyone who hasn't made money in the last 2 minutes is suicidal. You lot should try forex. You wait a week for a 0.5% move at 50:1. 

EurUsd hasn't moved more than 30 cents in a decade. 

Or gold, wait 10 years for few percent gain. 
This is good for bitcoin.
It may not be 5000, but i told yall yesterday to expect another massive drop..  but you downvoted me.  People dont listen, take these crazy up and down swings to your advantage, buy low sell high, rinse repeat..  whoevers manipulating the market is giving everyone a chance to play and make money.  Holding is obviously a bad deal right now.
If this year follows the last two years, price will start rising in Mid April-May. If you are waiting for a really low bottom then you have about a week or so, safer to just buy now because it doesn't look like it can get much lower. It has tried many times. The only reason it can get lower then 6.5k now is if a huge whale tries to FUD everyone so they can buy even lower before May. Jus my two cents. You can check out last year's early April and see for yourself, it was pretty much sideways too just like now.

In addition to that, The lowest last year's April fell was just about the price of their previous November Which is where we about stand right now. Our price is matching November's price. It shouldn't get much lower even if it does. So buy or miss the train. Again just my opinion and guess. I am 50% sure that I am 100% right. LOL
I normally have it set to only trigger if it dips $300 below the current price.  I would be ok.  At the lowest I would do it at $150 below current price. As a result I was fine on this dip. Waiting to see which way it will go and then will buy back in.
Okay?
Here a song for my feelings toward bitcoin.

Can someone tell me if its safe to use Ladger Nano S on a computer I am not really sure about. I have been using my computer for office use and have downloaded many files. Should I just format the computer before using Ledger Nano. Thanks in advance.

Heads up guys, Rockfella money moving into BTC
whoa, time really flies when you're having fun engaging in bitcoin/crypto discussions. 
These people started a TV show called Sharkchain TV for startups utilizing blockchain and AI it looks like it gives a chance for entrepreneurs to get funding for their projects, also could be good marketing for companies just starting out. Looks like they are going to start filming it soon, pretty interesting.  http://sharkchaintv.com/

Thar she blows mates. Just broke resistance. Not sure what all of this really means. Another trend being challenged is: When Europe and Asia wake up, it usually rebounds. No worries if it does - when America wakes up tomorrow we'll be sure to blow that theory out of the water. Ain't no low we can't test. Yes, being sarcastic.

price on your smart phone
Hello, does anyone know of any block explorers where I can list multiple addresses at the same time? I have an HD wallet and have gone through loads of addresses, I'm looking for a complete list of all transactions (including to each other) in one place. 

Ideally I'd want to export to csv as well. 

I have electrum but their export function does not include the addresses, only the transaction hashes. 
I think this is going to be it. Thought it was yesterday, but it didn't stick. See how this goes. I think 7500 tonight.
5k here we come
How about 9000 Bitcoins being bought today to get us near 20k of volume on GDAX? 
More than 3.000 coins and only 1 whe dont know creator and is decentralized... BITCOIN will be always BITCOIN. 
The botton is coming, and we will see a reversal line up on chart. Dont wait skyrocket at this moment... maybe after september, when MtGox finishh all sell wall and dont mix with market anymore. 
In june we will watch more clear rules about regulamentations around world and then big investment will back... institutional money are in a hungry to join.
If you ask me this is your last chance @ cheap coins. When (not if) when Bitcoin hits 20k again it'll start the same media frenzy we had during last december. 
any bad news why dump so hard 
Surely you don't need to sell that many BTC to buy a new Twitter handle?
It seems that the dump was done when the American market was pretty much out of action, any chance the Americans will push it up again? 
i love btc forever
Hey US, there is only Buy option left for you ahaha. Or you can try shorting in your pants ahaha
Price keeps re-crashing after a spike because a lot of people are still desperate to get out after the big crash at the start of the year. Look for spikes 'n crashes for the next 12-18 months until the new-buyer community stops fearing bitcoin will go to zero. 
tbh bitcoin was close to breaking 7.5k. It ran out of steam and fell short.
Looks like the whale that bought on the 6th and drove up prices sold this morning and caused the drop. Anyone know how much that trade (s) was worth?
Good luck everyone on the loss plane it feels good without cabin crew ( FUD regulators)

soros spare us... .
Whales shaking the tree to catch all the coins that drop out...
So we havn't dipped further than the 5.8k february low, seems like recovering is in order.
how many bitcoins does the average redditor has?
[deleted]
And there you go. Can't hold itself up. Again. This market is absolute shit.
its feels like its ready to explode soon!
[removed]
I see Soros and his filthy cohorts have arrived.
I’m new to this with just relatively little invested. But this is silliness now. If price manipulation has taken hold why should anyone hold, or use bitcoin as a store of value at this point? I’ll be back in when regulation can curb this obvious abuse by the few very wealthy
Remember: $180 / $1,200 x $20,000 = $3,000. You ain't seen nothing yet.
Today is the turnaround day, road to 8k is back up in action
Those perma bulls should get sued for manipulation and luring investors in. They are just as immoral as wallstreet bankers.
[removed]
GODDAMN we are attacked left right n center. Wealthy cunts are playing with our lives. This is our fight back, Soros or not Soros some old shit will not fuck it this time. We stand together, fuck the whales fuck them all. Bitcoin will not falter EVER. fuck you hook nose cunts. Go down cunts you have done pushing , now we fuck you . Enough is enough, you are **nothing**. nooooooooooothing. The sun will always rise above the dark.
I’ve just come back from a deep neural net conerence. AI everywhere right now. So it can drive a car? Bet your ass someone has it trading bitcoin too. Bots you call them.  Personally i think its mainly neural net bots moving btc price in random ways right now, squeezing money out of the market by wild manipulation and tricks.  Sadly its seems most of the market atm. The only thing which attributed to the big rise last year was so many fomo chumps entering the market.  The chumps are now gone, uninterested and burned.  Without a big paradigm shift in tech i dont see them coming back.  And thats years away at best...  so i cant see a turnaround anytime soon. And taking it one step further, if we’re this shakey on no news, what happens when some bad news comes out?  I think another tank is far more likely than another moon at this point.
I still own bitcoin so not trying to ‘fud’ or whatever. Just speaking my honest mind.
good moment for buying right now, there is some positive movement not including this dump. Buy and wait for pump than sell. 
oh my gosh, just realized Soros and Buffett are both 87 years old. Why is Soros investing in bitcoin at such an old age. The stress is not worth it and these guys aren't going to spend it all before they die of old age.
It's quite common for breakouts to fail initially. Lot of buy interest here. 
Stocks are falling massively, as well...

Put that $10,000 into BTC. Bitcoin is trading at $6727.65. Before everyone goes batshit and condemns this call. Lets let time be the ultimate judge. Call me any horrible name you like if it is not worth $20,000 by end of year. Cash out then and make some serious gains, although when it reaches those lofty heights again cash out would make more sense at 25k to 30k

25 minutes ago @Bob A @John Key  Ok lets bet $10 on your call. If it goes down to $10 I will send you one whole bitcoin, if it doesn't you send me one whole bitcoin. Would it be better to pay for your call now or at the end of the year?

Bitcoins doing it does best in 2018: Drop in value. 

3 digits, here we come. 
I've been on r/bitcoin , ending in dirty downvotes

List'ning to the weakhands, thinking 'bout this 'n' that

They said, "its Soros, its the stock market, its FUD, look at this projection, Bart Simpson, this and that."

Turn it down a little bit or turn it down flat

Pump it up, when you don't really need it
Pump it up, until you can feel it

Down in the pleasure center, hell-bent or heaven-sent

Listen to the propaganda, listen to the latest slander

There's nothing underhand that weakhands wouldn't understand

Pump it up, until you can feel it
Pump it up, when you don't really need it

Bitcoin been a bad dip, like a chemical
Though you try to stop it, Bitxoin like a narcotic
You want to sell high, you want to talk to buy low

All the coins you bought for your portfolio, putting up your temperature
Why are we still here? Just to suffer? Every night ... I can feel this price... and the market... even my lowball orders... The money i've lost - The comrades i've lost... it won't stop hurting. You feel it too don't you? I'm going to make them give back our past

every exchange should ban market manipulation , if they want they easily can find the person who is doing this again and again and let us know who is that fucker 
How can price go down when institutional investors are buying tens of thousands of BTC over the counter?

This doesnt make any sense guys. Hodl me and tell me its gonna be ok :(
