Yesterday we issued a couple temporary bans to accounts who were spreading fake news about a supposed SEC meeting, apparently in a widespread attempt to manipulate markets. Those accounts have been labeled and will be banned permanently if caught doing anything similar. 
Does anyone else have a wife that gets mad every time you buy bitcoin or is it just mine? 
For those calling this a sell off. Take a look at the 30 day chart: https://prnt.sc/jf8wyg

This is a bullish chart: Higher lows, higher highs... If it breaks significantly down then you might have the start of a point but until then this is still a promising chart in the mid term. 

Hate to use the cliche but zoom out and don't panic over short term moves
I just bought the dip at $9100, any buyers with me? 
Hodl the dickline!

same procedure every sunday-tuesday. will go up again from tomorrow on
We're below the dickline! Now's the time to buy - we'll be back above it in no time. Buy when everybody is selling and sell when everybody is buying, right?
What is the "dickline" i keep reading about? Im kinda new to crypto
Did my part. Added another dollar cost average buy in =)

what's wrong with rats? I like rats. A friend of mine has one as a pet and they are super friends!

I hate that Buffet guy.  Why did he say that crap??  Other than Margaritaville, his songs all suck.

I just bought the dip @ $9,120

Now i can go to eat with that warm feeling in my heart i get when i'm doing my part.

ARE YOU DOING YOURS??
Not many shorts on Bitfinex over the last few days, but an increase of shorting this morning. Something to keep an eye on.
Meanwhile exchanges and whales use these stupid dinosaurs Warren Buffett and Bill Gates sentiment on the BTC market to short it for their own personal benefit. Next day, CNBC: "Bitcoin drops $600 after leading investors call it rat poison"
**Keep fighting Bulls!**

To the Mo.......Ocean!!! Aw yea getting me some more.
all this crying....Buffet has nothing to do with this simple correction,,,,buy more btc...we shall overcome
Would it be wise to have a hardware wallet and an Android wallet at the same time?  I just bought a Ledger Nano S and am planning to store almost all of my Bitcoins on that, and then maybe around $500 to $1000 worth of Bitcoin on Mycelium for spending. I was thinking that if my software wallet gets hacked, then my hardware wallet would still be secured.

Quick question, if I transfer btc between my hardware and software wallet, the chances of my hardware wallet bring hacked is pretty low, right?

Sorry for being long winded but I'd be super grateful for any answers. Thank you!
I'm of course bullish on BTC long\-term but I have a feeling that Mr McAfee will be eating a sausage dinner come the end of 2020
Now the NYSE wants to sell Bitcoin.. is this a good thing or bad thing?? Look what happened the bitcoin on December when the futures started..

The 9k memes are getting stale now
Next week is consensus conference. Every year after the conference BTC has gone up between 10/70%.  So there’s that 
mcafee is a lunatic he needs to stay away from crypto. give it a bad name

Any recommendations for bitcoin exchanges? I had to sell everything I had(which wasn't much) at Coinbase since Xfers will stop supporting Singapore due to legal reasons.

Ready for 5k. I dont think we are out of this bear market yet. We need more pain for a sustainable growth after. Too many kids still in the game.
6k here we come
Here we go back down to 8k in the next week then back up 
Back down to sub 9k hahaha
[removed]
Back to sub 9k. possibly 8k if it doesn’t hold at 8.8k
Berkshire Hathaway wants to destroy cryptocurrency. 
The fight for the anal depths of 9k is back on again. Back to 8.8k and if it breaks that then 8k is easily attainable.
And straight down...

 Guys I have question if I understand it correctly, If for example vechain goes to 7 dollars, and I bough it at 3.5 dollars, and then I trade it with etherum which is for example 700, it is logical then to trade it to USDT on binance and leave it there for a while while vechain probably goes down, or should I trade for etherum and send it to GDAX and trade it to eur and wait? what is better option? 
I hope you all realize that McAfee's $1,000,000 prediction is backed up by nothing. It's simply an exponential function applied to the price of bitcoin. An exponential function can be applied to anything. Will it follow it? Possibly. Is it a guarantee? Absolutely not.
