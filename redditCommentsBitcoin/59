Reddit: Last chance to buy the dip!
Come to me 6,5k bitcoins 

Every1 asking for a bull run but no1 wants ride it
In times of trouble, I like to look here ;-)

https://fnordprefekt.de/


What's up? I haven't looked at the charts for 8 hours. It should have gone up by now...

I guess I need to look away harder.
I say we hold no longer, and start taking advantage of the violent ups and downs..  take these opportune times to profit..  I'm done wasting time holding onto bags, imma start swing trading, because its obvious we wont be seeing 20k anytime soon, imma take advantage of these ups and downs to accumulate btc without spending any money..  fuck it, i say you all should too.  instead of holding.
Bitfinex trading volume just 28k btc today last week it was 90k
Bags getting heavier each day. 
Hard to hodl! At $-1000 I was uncomfortable. At $-1500 I almost got out. At $-2000 I got out and it bounced back so licked my wounds and jumped back in swearing I'd never do that again! Now down $2700!!!!! What was I thinking! So sick of just watching money go bye-bye!!
lol right after I sell there's this huge pump. Fuck me
Vegeta is no where to be seen
Please do not FOMO. This isn't a recovery. That's what the whales want you to do. Also don't open a position right now.
Patience paid off for those of us who held off on a $8,350 buy back yesterday. Trust your gut, ignore your nerves. I say this and watch it drop another 500 out of nowhere, I will be eating shit for buying back too early. Where's Goldbergger? I need affirmation
Everybody panic! 
So...CNBC reports Bitcoin drops below $8000 after Twitter Bans Cryptocurrency ads... but Jack Dorsey Twitter CEO states Bitcoin will be the single global currency.

What's going on? What's going on?
Death cross or mining problem and energy consumption too high!
every time bitcoin try to go up a sell wall appears-
Fasten your seatbelts!
Y'all see that?!  WHAT IS HAPPENNINGGGG
Yup! The dildo is strong with this one!
If theres not enough buyers to pump just let it fall.
Does anyone know how much fiat concurrency has actually flowed into Bitcoin total?  Obviously the market cap is not an accurate indicator of that.
I sense anger in you Bitcoin...
Anger leads to FOMO....
FOMO leads to buying high...
Buying high leads to selling low...
Selling low leads to not having a Lambo....
Not having a Lambo , leads to fat chicks....

The rise back to 9,000 was nothing but pumps the whole way.  Very little volume and organic growth in between the pumps.
nice fake-selling walls someone is building on gdax (200-250 BTC)
This continued sideways movement will slowly drag the upper limit down. Leading to a price between 7 - 8k
rip 8k
rip 8k, now its getting interesting
What was that fucking sudden big drop ? 
i wish it went up that fast and easily
Id say given our obvious liquidity problem we do not want this: https://www.coindesk.com/cboe-argues-for-allowing-bitcoin-etfs-in-new-letter-to-sec/
Someone knows something, selling 10 btc portions whole day (europe day) on gdax
why is bitcoin down today? is there some news I missed?
a person here, could tell me that these sales do not come from mtgox liquidation, with certainties ???
How much % of the total btc is owned by the big boys?

Bitcoin ain't dead, it just smells funny. 
Is that a dump and pump ?
investing in crypto increases your chance of heart attack 
A lot of money was chasing the stock market today.  The Dow closed up 669 points.  It was just a lot more exciting than the crypto market.  And the Twitter and Facebook crypto ad bans didn't help.  Markets are fickle.  There are a lot of places to invest money.  People want a winner.  The media's fear uncertainty and doubt about bitcoin is published daily.  We're in a price slump.  And people are worried about losing their money.  Bitcoin is still amazing.  Segwit.  Lightning.  Cheap transactions.  A committed Core.  But good public relations?  We don't have that, and we need it.
Dont you see it ... We slowly and surely dying. 
Internet bubble sheme ... Too much invesment for few applications.  Money just leaving the market
another shit show day, cause why the heck not.
get your 8k memes ready bois
Tharrr she blows!!!
If BTC does make ATH again, may want to invest in Volkswagen who owns Lamborghini. Apparently there are a lot of potential buyers here.
And it’s where I Fomod in this morning. 
Wonder how many traders got burnt again
Makes me happy to see a whale lose money like that.
I want to get off mr bones wild ride 😢
BSI - Bitcoin SCREWED Index reading today; hope you like the color red!

Where the hell is the bottom?
If you look at the charts the curling pete has now scored 6 out of 7 under the eye of sauron on the hundred day chain... it’s pretty clear if the next shot is wide we’ll be looking at a dismal performance for the rest of the quarter, but if the next two hurls line up with the vertical broom we might actually be on the warpath for a reverse double diver... exciting times if you know what to look for!
get rdy for the reverse slingshot back to earth bois

 6,5k ft into earth 
But when it goes to 8500 by morning everyone here will be like oh man! Oh man! We’re mooning. It’s really happening.  Goes down 5%.  World over 
RIP [this guy](https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/8568681) who just lost his entire portfolio by shorting 100x @8020.
Bought at $7880 and buying every $100 it drops till I run out of money.
Low-$7’s by tonight is possible. American hours aren’t strong buyers without good news. 
just waiting for that bear market resums guy to post his shitty TA
remember the good old days when we had nice rallies upwards?
Has everyone sorted out their tax returns for this year now? 
Massive green dilly on GDAX !!!
Lot of exchanges trap going around today, sell immediately on top of these trap before the red candles burn, stay safe
This market takes more dumps than an infant. Its clearly being propped up and theres no interest in buying anymore.

Just keeps going down, down, down... 
All this thread has is blind faith and unfunny memes trying to mask poor investment decisions 
Just FOMo’d all over the place

My evil NRG couldn't hold. I have failed you all.... I will retreat back into the shadows to lick my wounds. 

I suppose the one consolation to the low bitcoin price is that BitMain (and the other manufacturers) will soon have to be offering ASIC miners at more than a 50% discount just so purchasers might break even by the halving in 2020.
I usually charge for my advice and predictions, but just this once I really want to help the community.

From my free prediction service: We will be in the range $7.5K to $8.5K for the next few months.   $7K at the end of summer and then down from there.    Please trade and invest accordingly!
Mining is absolute now under 8k. Panic?
What are the tax implications of selling your bitcoin at a loss?
at least a good move. not that 0.00001 increase every 10 seconds
Why does everyone get excited over any bull run that happens. Celebrate when we have a strong run through 9k. 
what a boredom Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
[deleted]
Bitcoin is the  manipulated, no doubt
some guys really dont want the 8k to be crossed. sad 
the more tries fail, the more we go to 7k by the day
I am selling high before they dumb it with big red candle
I can only think of a few thousand reasons to sell
but hundreds of thousands of reasons to hold
who really knows what the future holds in a couple of years
At the end of every year it's like a wish I bought now, well I'm doing it this year fuck it.

Buy and HODL. Volume is low... once sellers dry up and traders ru out of cash, only HODlers left. We go to the moon again. GLTA
L O W E R 😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
The FUD campaign is getting old. How are the mainstream media groups still pushing the story that BTC is dropping because twitter bans crypto ads. So Twitter banned ads for cryptocurrencies...WHO CARES!!! Since when are companies like Twitter trying to push some sort of agenda. Twitter, google, facebook, etc. saying things like "It's to protect our users," is such a crock of shit. It is an individual's decision to invest in things with no bearing on the company who puts up a paying client's advertisement. HEY TWITTER, you would allow Coca Cola or MacDonald's to advertise...well that made me fat, so it's your fault twitter. Do we see the fault in this logic? Basically what we have is a government and "powers that be" smear campaign to try to disrupt our disruptive market, and guess who they're in bed with. I'll give you a hint...Google, Facebook, Twitter...their user voluntary source of info on everybody. Don't let them win, It's time to WAKE UP and stop being one of the SHEEPLE!!!
Price is falling like a slaughtered animal. 
A serious bear trap would make me happy today. 
Interesting pattern repetition. 

I guess I see it, because I'm a human being. And human beings like to see patterns, even if there are none. It's part of human nature. 

Still...

Why do you Americans say Mom instead of Mum?
Feb we saw a low of 6.9k, now it's 7.9k, y'all need to calm yo tits and see what April has in store for us. 8.9k hopefully? I don't mind if this is the case
This is painful to watch. 
All in guys
At this point I’m saying screw it 
7k by Thursday?
Its nearly 300 billion, used to be 700 billion, its getting lower day by day
Where are we going?
https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/6GuxadAx-Manipulated-Dump/

Should have listened to this guy in January. He called it to a T.

Meanwhile we've been getting dumped on nonstop
How are there still any weak hands left after the last 3 months on the rollercoaster 🎢 ?    No bad news lately.  This is pure market manipulation.  We’ll be back above 8k soon.  Too bad I didn’t wait until today to place my buy.  😤 
Let’s all stop crying and relax 
can we just dip to 6k or 4k or whatever?-
[deleted]
Its ok guys keep buying the dips. BTC is worth so much more than 8k in the long run, i mean theres more than 2 and a half major retailers worldwide accepting BTC. The value is limitless. 
LOLOL. It's doing so bad. This is a bear market now.
Time to buy 
I'm gonna call it. BTC is officially dead guys.
[deleted]
What I wanna know is who is buying all this coin on the way down during the dips?
I am new to reddit there are a number of very good reasons I chose reddit for my upcoming/newest effort.  I am known in the Canadian media as the, "Thorn In The Side Outspoken Advocate For The Homeless"  I am going to take my efforts to the moon and back using crypto and reddit for a huge very modern approach to assisting the homeless.  I am in beginning stages and now focused on Doge for my project.  Google Jason McComb Homeless Awareness Canada to see some of my many past successful efforts.  My newest effort is going to reach New Zealand at the same time as Canada then everywhere between.  Details are coming with a new website soon.  Old twitter @HomelessMcJason new one for this @Crypto4Homeless.
My reddit is https://www.reddit.com/user/Crypto4Homeless/ any help would be so very much appreciated much thank you! 
Anyone else see Bitcoin being worth around $80k by next March? 
I think im at that point of buy all the way in and forget about it for 9 months.
It may have been a pump, but here my brothers, is where we turn the tables and don’t let them dump. 
Hmm... my bags are pumping, that shit is suspicious.
I hate Bitcoin!

aaaaaaaaaaand its gone, now wait for the dump until 7.5k
I can tell you with 50% surety that Bitcoin WILL go up!
It's over. It was fun while it lasted. Well no, it wasn't. 
Bitcoin is becoming a big joke. 
All of you people hoping it will go lower by spreading BS FUD... you know you can buy a fraction of BTC, right? You can probably afford .001 BTC and join team HODL. :D
When Asia wakes up, btc will jump to 8.8k just watch it
[deleted]
Can anyone make statistics of percentage of mined bitcoin which is UTXO and second one, which will show how long after mining it was spent?
Where is the next support?
I never really understood the situation of people from 3rd world...tried to verify in a couple of crypto places with my 3rd world ID instead of with my 1st world ID. I got "sorry we do not verify IDs from your country" AND my accounts got blocked so I cannot reverify with the 1st world ID. There cannot be much of a new retail, ever probably, if this is how it's going to be.

Any reason why it is falling? The whole market looks forthy

Boo!

Finally, drop to 7k and get this over with
I view the situation as a litmus test for both bitcoin and the altcurrencies. Almost all major altcurrencies are lower at this point than they were during the crash at 6th of February, while bitcoin is hovering just below 8k. This is about 2k higher than its lowest point this year in comparison.

While bitcoin has bled, the altbleeding has been far more severe, contributing to leverage bitcoin's market dominance. As a newcomer, the situation shows me in practical terms the level of stability that bitcoin possess under pressure in comparison to its forks. If the recent crashes have been a correction of sorts, it appears that the most noticeable sets of overvaluations have involved the alts.

When bitcoin is sufficiently undervalued it will bounce as a result of the degrees of profitability involved. If I remember correctly the last time it bounced was at about 2% over the McAfee line; we're seeing the price hovering at 4.5% over that line at the moment. It will be interesting to see how it performs this time. Not saying that I agree with McAfee's prediction - I don't, however his prediction provides a direct line to compare the low-end spectrum of the price with.
So it happens a lot to me when trading on bitmex that de stop limit is triggered yet the order does not fill, I leave about 10 dollars spread between the triggering price and the limit price. Is it because of a gap or am I missing something ???

Thank you for taking your time and helping.
What options do I have for a cold storage wallet? My requirements are:  
* I can generate addresses offline  
* I can sign transactions offline(I transfer unsigned transactions by usb)  
* bech32 addresses  
* supports HD wallet, bip32(I only have to backup one thing!)  
* I can backup the master node(master key and chain code)  
* I can backup wallet accounts(the ext priv and pub)  
* bip44 so I can split my coins into "long term account, beaten with wrench fake account, daily account, change account etc"  
* run on desktop(I want to run it on a raspberry pi with no wifi wrapped in a Faraday cage)  
* open source
Bitcoin death cross is a joke -____-
At least that spike cut the week long bs
So does the other side of the world wake up and decide to sell low? I understand miners need to cover their bills and people need to get the money back but...is there something I am missing here? I do not believe we will just go back to 20k in the blink of an eye but what is causing this?
Lmaoo did u see thst on gdax all the but/sell bots were gone and it candled up 170$
someone deriving it up and down to make his money, better to sell high before he dumb it
Who's assed if it's down or up 0 or 100000. It's all fun! 
I think it tried 4 times to break 8k zone, failed to do, creating more chances of down town 
Remind me again. Why “Must” Bitcoin price continue to drop?

Oh yeah because it’s been trending that way for a while. Such an arbitrary reason but I guess it’s the name of the game. 

Seems to have nothing to do with fundamentals IMO
I feel some might bears got control to keep it below 8k, I am scared they could dump it with big red candle
He sold.  Pawmp it.
DARK MAJIK.... EVIL FORCES IN CONTROL NOW
MASSIVE PUMP.... 3............ 2............ 1.................. fsssssssss 
Bitcoin savers club anyone? For people who save their fiat to buy bitcoin on a regular buy basis how much bitcoin have you aquired so far? Im thinking of doing this in the aim of getting my 0.5 btc to a whole coin 
those idiots sellings like idiots for nothing would be the same idiots buying bitcoin back at 50k.

let them sell and buy those cheap bitcoins.
The truth is that Bitcoin is still on track to go to 1million. Of course it will crash many times before it hits the 1 million mark...which by the way it will need to get to this or higher for 1 satoshi=.01 and this is when L\N will take over as Bitcoin's price will stabalize
[deleted]
Exchanges are trying best to trap users by little uppish movement then drop it down badly
[deleted]
so still possible for bitcoin to reach 1M by 2020.
Cryptos are a new thing. there was so much shit that happens. Shit that happens with all new things. I think when they make a reset and start new some of that shit won't happened again. Thera are so much learnings. A reset isn't possible. So i think it will go down and up in close range maybe between 6 - 15 k. It takes a time to stabilizes and provide a heathy rise to new ATH. 
To keep in mind for the rest of the week 
futures contract expire on the 29 of March
they were taken out on the 15 December 2017
There was three sets of contracts started on the 15th
ending in January , February and March
So expect a lot of pushing and pulling leading up to 11 am N Y time on the 29th Friday
Then you can expect the price of Bitcoin to be pushed around all weekend and on Monday for the start of the new contracts
Just going on what happened with the last contracts
start dates and finish dates
Be safe stay in coin

U even hodl bro?
do you guys think we have bottomed this week? 
"temporary bottom, reversal" plez
time to buy 
I smell Mt Gox selling before it dropped to 7k or 6k
DARK MAJIK
I have a pattern....you see long red dildos and you at the bottom of one of them...its buy time...you see long green dildos and you at the top of one ...sell time...especially after a few days of going nowhere...
No matter if it goes down to $1.   Bitcoin is not about price in crappy government-issued fiat.  It is about power and control taken from governments and banks and given to the people.   And decentralization and anonymity.   Right, boys?

1 BTC = 1 BTC !
Everyone selling now, will Fomo in at $20k
"Look, man. I just need Bitcoin to do what I want it to do when I want it to do it." Where's the fun in that? If life was like that you'd kill yourself after a month.
how does one do a leveraged buy or short?

I can't seem to find a platform
These type of pumps comes from exchanges when everyone sell and sleep they push it, because they make money when you buy it back on high price, Japanese morning is still on sell orders they are smart, what goes up comes down
I'm just waiting for Michelle Obama to come out and endorse BTC. We'll all be saved! 
[deleted]
Peace out, weak hands...
The last 2 dips under 8k didn't last longer than 24hrs. Too juicy of a price to pass up.

See you doom and gloom dudes later, I'm gonna catch up with the astronauts on Tuesday afternoon.
See?  Back above 8k already. I told ya this is pure market manipulation by the whales  🐳 
HODL HODL HODLGANG.

Cmon ya’ll. Don’t be selling. You should be buying on the dips. Experts are predicting $30,000 this year and higher. No need to sell out.

Meanwhile, I might unload a few and play the volatility game. We’re in a range.
Lol just sell. Everyone wasting their time.
Welcome to the day of carnage. 
[Not a financial advice but just my research based on few TA specialists]

If it pivots up from just under 8K (7.8k most probably) with a clear green candles and confirmation, this might be the last best chance to buy. It is the start of wave 3 which is normally the longest and never the shortest of the 5.

It is just prediction as many others. no need to get agitated, just do your own research and make your own decisions.

TA is only good when markets are left to do what they want to do, in the case of BTC, we all know that there is too much FUD and influences hence TA is lesser relevant. 

But I will be buying more at 7.8 Pivot if it happens. Thoughts welcome...
9k by thursday
Hope you guys did what I said, stay safe
most of the selling pressure is from Japanese who own 55% share of btc, they are fed up of Binance 
Hey guys, I am 21 and I just bought my first home! its a 3/3 and I plan on renting the other two bedrooms. I am considering accepting bitcoin for rent  (instead of shit fiat). If I understand correctly, there would not be a taxable event until I sell the coins, and have income tax or capital gains tax.Or is there an immediate tax liability due to it being rental income?

I do plan to declare it. I have no plans to evade taxes.

damn this market is so manipulative
I need money for rent come on baby 
SOOOOO..heard that coinbase is announcing ERC20 support , and what does it mean for our bitcoin?

Sorry folks, but it won't be going back up this time.

fucking noobs. Great go sell. See you at a new all time high. HODL
You guys need to stop bitching. Roughly 50 million people are invested in cryptocurrencies.   That is just about 1% of fhe population. The cryptomarket is still very much in its infancy. The blockchain technology is a world changer, wait for it to be used . So you lost a few hundred of dollars, so what. When this bear market is over, btc starts bouncing back up at a ridiculous speed. Just be smart this time and lock in profits
Is that true that 90% of market is traded on Chinese exchanges? If yes that would explain a lot. 
[removed]
A whole lot of bitching in here today. Either sell up or shut up 
You all remember that theymos post stickied when Bitcoin was first at 9k? I would take care to heed those words. 
Hey man, I understand what you are saying. My apologies, a condescending tone was not my intent. That’s my opinion and that’s my lifestyle and it’s the issues I see with many people these days. It had no direction towards your situation at all. Everyone has a different situation in different areas with different income levels so my opinion may not be accurate across the board. I was making 50-70k bar tending in touristy bars in Florida working the heavy seasons in many locations. The property I purchased was 165k so definitely different than in your area. I just get a little annoyed with people who do nothing to improve themselves or their career, make minimum wage and work minimal hours and then come to the internet to complain about how impossible their living situations are. Trust me man, I wish I had bought more btc back then! I had many opportunities to purchase bitcoin between 2012-2016 and unfortunately I did not understand the tech and it was too scammy/speculative for me. Good luck to you man, I hope bitcoin moons and we all get rich.

Too much gloom here.   First thing to remember is that this thing will only keep going up, and eventually we will win because we are the early adopters.  Like Apple or the Internet or something that in the 1980s.  We just have to wait until it's the world currency, like Thiel has predicted.

Second thing to remember is that even if we never make any money, it doesn't matter, because we are in it for the tech.  And freedom, fighting governments, banks, and so on.   Providing anonymity and control over one's own money.    We are the vanguard of a revolution such as the world have never seen.

So, even if it sinks to $1 per BTC, we still win!   
Does anybody know of some good articles/tutorials for trading over $10,000? I'm also getting eaten alive on fees/market markup as my investment grows. It's possible this is normal but the market sits at $8,050 and I buy coin at an exchange rate of $8,200. I'm going to hit the Coinbase and Squarecash weekly buy limit at 10k very soon. Any thread or article to help guide me through not shooting myself in the foot would be appreciated
1 BTC = 1 BTC !

Never forget!    Forget bogus fiat pricing!

Are people seriously asking advice? "Why yes, Bitcoin will go up tomorrow, hold steady for a day then drop again". Now go invest accordingly...
