If I lost money with bitcoin last year, the IRS owes ME money right? 
Oh cool, $1300 more and I'm back in the green.

The worlds richest BTC-address is buying and growing larger and larger during times like these. 
So are many other rich BTC-adresses. None of the 20 richest ones are selling large amount in the past days. 


Keep hodling.

To the moon boys, want to buy my lambo back.
I just FOMO'd in. This had better be good.
Who else is all in?! HODL
Got to try and stay positive at times like this, I know it's hard but it has to be done. 
Soon all the FOMOS will be complaining they aren't in BTC. Anyone who's long, don't sell. Lets get the FOMOS in at higher prices
This *8500* seven hours long movie is getting boring. 
Anyone else think that the market is in limbo and is waiting to see what happens at the G20 meetings next week? 
Don't fucking sell. They will buy it for millions...
looks like bitcoin skipped leg day
I think we'll be hitting over 9k within the coming few hours. Personally I doubt to see much more sub 8.5k action for a while. I don't think we will moon, probably there will be some 9.2k sideways action, perhaps some peaks towards 9.6k. I could well be wrong so don't take it as investment advice.
Countdown to drunken fomo in 3....2.....1....  happy st Patrick’s day weekend!
God dammit.
The stand for 8K. Man your positions ... gentlemen.
I have recently developed a revolutionary analysys tool and I'm ready to test the prototype on the field.

[It was heads we go up, tails we go down.](https://i.imgur.com/PMo05hc.jpg)

On a serious note, I don't like when the price gets stuck after a pump. I'm expecting a drop soon.
I simply don’t understand the negativity. “Drop to 5k already!”  Why. Why would you want that.  I don’t care if the charts say that’s what supposed to happen. What in the hellll is typical about crypto.  Fight back to 8500, then to 9.  Then to 11.  Drop to 5. Jesus 
Is the knife still falling ?
Hey it me america. I’m awake. Today is gonna be a crazy one. Hold your dicks
Woah. Jumps lol 
the fomo engine is gaining steam
East Coast America woke up happy, hope it continues all weekend.

We are going to test upper resistance today, get your helmets on. Form frontline whale 🐋🐋 🐋 formation, hodlers cover the rear! HODL strong!! No moon 🌒 without sacrifice!! 
what happened this morning??
oddly quiet in here 
Ive been trading this for a week straight and I’m exhausted. Today Im taking a break I feel like if I stare at charts another day my eyes are gonna bleed. 

Im taking a break until Monday come what may. Hopefully we start next week with a more bullish tone. 

Good luck everyone. 
second friday of the month.. people are getting paid.. thats whats happening.. or at least i'd like to believe so

good news in crypto world USA Tax Friendly Crypto Laws 
I want to stop going through the bank to buy crypto, and I have some spare cash. So I think I’m gonna try out LocalBitcoins and try to buy some face-to-face. 
Anyone have a deck of cards?
Was that a whale?

Lots of people bitching about low volume and the pricing falling. I have a feeling this is due to the G20 coming up next week. People are afraid there will be bad news, but I think it will be mostly good. The leaders want regulation which  I think is a good thing. Once good news comes out I think we will see a rise in price. Notice I didn’t say moon. It will be significant though.
If I may be so bold: Can someone add "things that add value to bitcoin" to the daily discussion topics?  It stands to reason that fans of crypto should be bragging to everyone about how it makes everyone's life better, not just "well... I got mine."
Go on, kill bitcoins, I dare you. Wall street cronies and degenerates, oh wait, you don't have enough money to dump bitcoin? Aw..too bad!
I'm sick. I am not in the mood for this shit. Up. Now.

30 dollars down not a good sign especially at this time.I just want pumps non stop till we touch the moon and then I can land
I hope someone can help me out here, this is a 101 question. 

I'm a sex worker and I use crypto currency for my work. I know how to do everything using my cellphone and my wallet and I've become pretty savvy at it. I've been asked by a nonprofit to give a workshop on crypto currency for sex workers, and I want to make it accessible, so I want to teach them how to use a paper bitcoin wallet because some of the attendees might not have cell phones.

I know how to make a wallet on blockchain.info, how to make a paper wallet at a bitcoin atm, and how to scan the private key and sweep the paper wallet, but I'm hung up on the idea of importing a wallet, specifically I've read that if you import a wallet and spend part of the bitcoin, the entire wallet is depleted. Where does that bitcoin go? Will it still be available for the user with the blockchain.info wallet, or will it be gone forever?

So far I'm planning to just tell attendees to just sweep their paper wallets and destroy them, but I heard that importing can have a benefit by allowing money to be sent to the public key, then having it immediately available on the wallet. This might be helpful for girls who maybe only get 20 minutes of computer time at a library or drop in centre, so they can get in, post their ad on a website, then leave. It also means that they don't have to type or scan the private key every time, which exposes them to potential keylogging attacks. It can also be difficult to type it in every time if you're disabled or addicted to substances.

If anyone can help me out here in plain English it would be much appreciated. 
Has gone up a good bit last hour..
Time for mooning music. https://youtu.be/ldd2QgSSXP0
Seems like lnd has swayed some large capital into the market
Anybody fall for that? Im not biting...
I wonder if some big fund opened a large position this morning based on Peter Thiel's [recent comments Bitcoin being the next gold.](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/15/peter-thiel-is-betting-on-bitcoin-to-be-the-online-equivalent-to-gold.html)
I guess $8500 is the new point of new resistance. 
Make sure you pay your taxes on Bitcoin cause CNBC said so.   Trololol.

I wonder if you can get a write off if u invested and lost. Hopefully shit backfires as such.

I wonder how much tax USA has been missing out on per year since 2008 to make them start caring
Well I’m out of fiat until the end of month. This sucks.  Will prolly be above 10k by then.  Enjoy this dip while it lasts.  
Does anyone use bots for gdax, if so which ones?
Weekends as always good. Dips from tuesday on.
All hodlers out there, young and old, lend the price chart your power
Down it goes. Get ready to buy the dip! 
Seems like all the Lord Modi swigglers taking a shit. Everyday at this time.
So is there somewhere new to go to see the nodes that are open on Mainnet? The websites seem to all be down now. 
This thread has become so toxic...
enjoy the calm and low price.

we are going to get pumped to heaven 
Works all day to hold 8500 drop 400 in minutes
Monthly bottom is 8k, because I say so.

And yes, that's one hell of a TA, I may teach you guys a thing or two in the spare time.

edit: ok, doesn't hurt to share a secret I guess. It's an ancient technique developed in medieval China: you pull a market price out of your ass and tell everyone that's the bottom. If you're right your karma skyrockets. If you're wrong you blame whales.
Bitcoin's morning wood.  After it busts, it'll limp back down to 7k
If you use a hardware wallets with Electrum, I need your help.

Please generate a brand new wallet and mnemonic phrase. Connect your hardware wallet to Electrum.

In Electrum go to `Wallet` --> `Information` and reply here on reddit with the Wallet type, Script type and Master Public Key. Also reply with the first three addresses in that wallet. Also say which hardware wallet you use (Trezor, Ledger, Digital bitbox or KeepKey)

Afterwards don't ever use the wallet you just generated, because anyone will be able to spy on it since you published the master public key. Obviously don't ever post a real mainnet wallet master public key because of the privacy issue.

I'm working on [Electrum Personal Server](https://github.com/chris-belcher/electrum-personal-server) and don't actually own a hardware wallet myself.
Feel bad for the people that sold low but I lie. Screw them! lets go.
i said last night 8k is the new bottom and am standing by it.  Looking forward to getting off my computer soon for the day and waking up tomorrow to a price of at least 8250 and then ill watch it spike to 8790 tomorrow and break into 9k on Sunday

My average price is $7300 for BTC. HODL, or sell and try to get the dip if it goes as low as people are suggesting?

Edit: dip, not tip. haha.
Woop woop!
Well thats a good thing. I was preparing for a substantial drop if it stayed below 8350 after 6pm pst. Still trade carefully! 
Whats the correlation between US market and Bitcoin price movement. I see it fluctuates during market open. 
I also believe we will go down to 6000-7000 before we can rise again.

On the other hand, everybody seems to believe that. And that's a good sign that the opposite is true.

We will see soon enough...
Because of the short duration and sky-rocketing intensity of the recent buy (an hour and a half ago) that these are programed institutional buys?  Basically an institutional pump and dump?  Or is there not enough volume to reach that conclusion?
Has anyone else noticed that 11AM is when the dump usually happens?? Today could be the first day without that big dump...
IS it  a good time now to buy bitcoins ? I decided to buy only a week ago and by the time the money was ready on the exchange the drop happen and. until now Im still debating weather I should buy or not ?!!!! 
I passed on buying at 8200 this morning because I was sure I would see 8k again by lunch. Surely we will see under 8k again by the end of the weekend, right?
Took 20 min just now to move btc out of bitstamp
i bought the all time high for the day (for now).

AMA.  
READY TO LAUNCH IN 10..
How does everyone calculate their profit/loss in trades? Seems like most of the exchanges don't provide that on their platforms which is a bit strange. I've been working on an excel doc and building scripts to provide me my Profit/loss updates at regular intervals when I'm in trades that get sent to me via my phone. Will probably share how to to build at some point after I fine tune things.
bitcoin may have skipped leg day this morning but at night it knows he's gotta work out those chicken legs.
anyone full of dip yet?
On a positive note. I brought my BEP to $8,850 today.
Only if we could look into the future...
What would we see with Bitcoin????
Kinda new, but on GDAX what’s it mean when it’s been green dots continuously?
I'm a bit tired of this up and down mess, but I've been killing it predicting the dips. Got out at the top of this one at $8316 as it was clear it wasn't going to hold. I will buy back in when it crosses my Stop Order.
What's going on with market? We have so many positive news worldwide about crypto and its dropping like crazy. Any clue? 
Bitcoin I command thee, RISE!

"There And Back Again: A Hobbit's Tale"
This sub is a disaster.
It's not FUD, it's the truth catching up with Bitcoin.
Bitcoin can't even stand up.
Trade volume rock bottom.
Online interest rock bottom.

Why buy now when its guaranteed to go way lower?
There seems to be a general long term trend towards a bottom of 4-5k. This is similar to the mt-gox crash earlier. Price moved from $1000 to $200 back then: 80%. This time it should move from 20k to $4k - a little more because there is more awareness today. 

Price drops over the weekend because traders stop trading (they have jobs too) - and most cash out their gains. Price might drop to 7.5k this weekend. During the week, the price will stay between 8-9k next week. Then a drop to 7K next weekend. This will continue till we stabilize at a low (possibly 4-5k)

Yes, it can bounce back - but the possibility is low. 
Looks like a classic pump. Shame.
Will a dump be coming soon? 😟
Can you feel the fear in Rotshield's eyes? #sponzoringdailyFUDinyour newspapersandnews

There will be no moon. Go back to watching tv and staring at your phone.

All the charts say we are going to push back over 10k! 
Long time lurker here! Hope people use Bitcoin as a means of exchange now that price seems to have stabilized.
I hate green dildos.
I'm happy that the price of bitcoin is falling and see the value of my bitcoins blow away. I started using bitcoin just to order drugs a year ago. While the price of bitcoin increased, it became possible for me to order drugs for free.
I've spent about 1 - 2 bitcoins on drugs in 2017! It wasn't until mid 2017 that I began to study what bitcoin really is and invested more money.
Anyway, now I am living a much more sober life and always make sure to invest more money the few times I buy than the value of the drugs.
Dont count on it. It is decidedly so. Signs point to yes. As i see it, yes.

If we plot this 1 negative and 3 positive answers on a graph, we get an upward slope, which means buy more today.
The whole f'ing day has been rekt liquidate sell sell sell sell sell then takes a poop comes back and buy buy buy etc. At the same price almost. Afterthat a whalecall drop a stinky turd at 7900 or 8030. Meanwhile you have these guys spreading fud and reason with Mt gox, which is really just selling at the 8.6k range beginning of the week or whatever....Can we just go on with our lives? 
Uhhhhhhh.  Okay. This is like the hunger games 
Guys, guys. You know how I know that the price won't go below $7,830? Because I've been sitting on a buy order at that price all day. And knowing my luck, it will go to 7,830.01 and bounce up far out of reach.
Can we go to 5-6k already and get this over with. WTH are these day traders smoking? 
TGO THE MOON WREGERTHTE OTMOONNNOMHONNJN rewgefradsr
trade volume is at rock bottom!
Thought I'd share my interpretation of the current daily candlestick chart. So far the last two candles have been star doji's, this represents indecision between the bulls and the bears. We're currently forming a third doji, and in sequence this is known as a Tri-Star. The Tri-star pattern should be confirmed if the price action remains stagnant and the current candle closes near the opening price.  
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tri-star.asp  
A Tri-Star generally speaking indicates a sharp reversal of the current trend. I thought It would be worth mentioning as a potential possibility. Cheers!
