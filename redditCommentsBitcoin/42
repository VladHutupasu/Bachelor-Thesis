The Battle For $7k.....again!
Yet another chance. Be a whale for a day, make some cash. 
So many tarot readers.
69 dudes.  Whoa. 
Panic and pandemonium at r/Bitcoin as Bitcoin drops .5%

More at 11.
Hi friends!

I added new indicators to Bitgur Customizable Watchlist ([bitgur.com/watchlist](https://bitgur.com/watchlist)). Now you can add ATH and moving averages (EMA5, EMA10, EMA20, EMA50, EMA100, EMA200). Here you can watch screenshot: [i.imgur.com/lpSYF2p.png](https://i.imgur.com/lpSYF2p.png). I hope it might be useful for people who use EMA in trading. 
LES GO LES GO
I dont know why everyone is so excited. We've slowly seen a lack of BOTH resistance and support. The volume is being compressed which will cause a break out that can take us on a short bull run, or a devastating bear run. Considering we still have a lot more correcting to do from the reckless support of 2017 its most likely gonna break out following the down trend.

Do y’all see the coming world war as good or bad for bitcoin prices???
Time for the next pump...
Breakout
Look at the size of the bars on the 6 hr chart.  Market appears to be reaching equilibrium.  Will be interesting two days from here to see where we go.  
I threw all in yesterday, and I feel like it’s ready to blow up.
We moon now?

Funny how it take 2 hrs for bitcoin to crash and 3 days to recover 
Rise of the Alt Coins
Wow! Someone just bout 143BTC on GDAX in one pop. That's just shy of 1 million dollars.
Well, it seems that the downtrend is about to end. The dip is raising and the 7200 resistance is easy to break.
My theory for the BTC sideways movement of the last two weeks:

Obviously a lot of people (traders, recent buyers, and old hodlers), think the BTC price is going lower and want to sell. They have pushed it downward after every recent climb (on Apr 3 and Apr 9).

However, the greater force is the new whales that have been eying BTC since it's newsworthy growth last year. It is common sense to say that anyone looking to start investing in BTC for the first time and who has done their risk/reward research has picked a price point at which to buy in. This includes all the new crypto hedge funds. What is unknown is how much new money is coming in and at what price they are looking to buy BTC.

I had previously thought that 1/4 of the ATH price at 5k USD would be the largest support line of new money coming in. But, it's looking like 1/3 of the ATH is more likely, at 6.5k USD. 

To me, these previous two weeks of support at 6.5K USD suggests that 1/3 of the ATH is the magic support number at which many new whales want to buy in. Consider the quick bounce back during the Feb 5 dip. So why 1/3 of ATH? It is similar to previous BTC major corrections, but it's literally just a mental number that stands out in investors' minds: "BTC will probably fall to one third of its ATH price during this correction," is easy to say, so that's where they plan to buy in.

I don't believe in predicting the future, but as a BTC (longterm) trader, I believe in betting on the future. My bet is that there is potential for a BTC 2018 ATL of 5k USD, but I think this recent bouncing off the 6.5K USD line over the last two weeks is the bottom of the 2018 price correction. A slow and steady bull market could follow.

This is not financial advice. DYOR. Posting here only to timestamp my estimate.
Guys, my dog's shat had an upward pinch to it.  I think that's a sign of a bull run.  Yes ?
I wish it was this stable when it was around the ATH :( 
If the bulls could move it up to around $7500 I think that would make people believe that we are going up again.  
Lol .... one good thing about the slow pace is that even a $100 jump looks HUGE on the chart :)

Bitcoin is almost as boring as the game of cricket. 
With Dow set to fall up to 300 looks like great time to trade and buy some Bitcoin now 
Who's in for some long green dongs?

Everyone here getting excited about a 100 point move, that's nothing. We need a solid 500 point move in a short period of time to confirm any upside reversal. Still too little volume coming in right now. 
I know it's probably asked a lot but what's the cheapest way to withdraw from Coinbase?

 In the UK if that makes a difference, I read something about sending it to GDAX?

Thanks.

With more and more companies making better and better ASIC's and Mining hardware will the 21 million hard cap get reached sooner than we originally thought?
what a fight for 5$ to the next wall at 6010. 
It’s getting harder to wait to buy... I’m afraid it won’t go much lower anytime soon.

How to delete bitcoin ? 
we need more power cap'tin! She aint gunna hold! 
The battle for 7k is underway
This is it!!! All this patience is about to pay off (pun intended)

I can't take anymore traps
Anyone else bored AF. This has got to be one of the tightest price range bitcoin has ever been. If you zoom out its been like this for half a month. Everyday I wake up anticipating price movement. Only the alts seem to be benefiting while bitcoin is stable. 
If I wanted to sell a car >10k and accept bitcoin as payment, how would I handle the transaction? Thanks
Trading Analysis:

What we have developing is a classic Mitsubishi Step Pattern, with gradually ascending steps.

According to classical TA theory, if there is one more step, it will lock into this pattern forever.  Gradually ascending until the price reaches 100k
Oh look, somethings actually happening again.
HODL
Everybody all in!
To the moon!
Heh.

BTC still bullish, on the **50 week** MA !

https://www.coindesk.com/history-repeating-why-bitcoins-price-could-rise-in-q2/

Why not make it 52 weeks and call it a year.  FFS.

Still hodling tho.
Firmly believe we will see a big rise here soon back to $10k. This downtrend since the two peaks at 11k are from big owners dumping. Once whoever it is that keeps dumping coins is done we should move up. We keep getting pushed down on huge coin dumps and then move back up on low volume. If you have been looking closely at the minute/5min charts on GDAX for the past couple weeks you would see how these 2-5k coin sells have dropped us everytime there is a recovery.
Hey guys have you heard of Dogecoin its the best new currency in the whole entire bitworld!

**Bear Market 'Largely Over,' Crypto Fund Manager Claims**

https://www.coindesk.com/bear-market-largely-over-crypto-hedge-fund-manager-claims/

Timothy Enneking, managing director of Crypto Asset Managment, LP, said Monday that the winter in cryptocurrency markets is "largely over."

Crypto Asset Management, which was founded last year and has roughly $20 million in assets under management, saw its CAMCrypto30 cryptocurrency index fall by 69 percent since its high in January. Enneking sees four reasons for the collapse.

Asset consolidation, regulatory concerns, massive liquidation by the Mt. Gox trustee and startups' selling crypto assets to pay salaries and expenses are all factors in the market's overall decline, he wrote.

"Consolidation after the amazing 2017 increase" drew back some of the funds invested in cryptocurrencies, he said.

Invsestors are also likely wary due to recent regulatory actions. While he did not cite any specific events, the report comes just weeks after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission subpoenaed startups with initial coin offerings.

It remains unclear what exactly the SEC is looking for, though an official confirmed "dozens" of investigations were underway.

The other two reasons likely had less of an impact, Enneking said.

These factors have mostly been priced into the cryptocurrency market already, which, despite the recent rout, is still up by over 600 percent in the last 15 months, he wrote.

Enneking also noted that bitcoin's share of the overall cryptocurrency market has fallen from 45.7 percent on Dec. 20 to 44.3 percent. This decline in "BTC dominance" has coincided with a decline in correlation between bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, he wrote.

While the note does not comment on what declining correlation means, it could indicate that the quality of individual cryptocurrencies is beginning to have a greater influence on their market prices.

The combination of these factors indicate that the market should begin rebounding soon, he indicated in his report.

Do we trust this little bull flag?
Can someone explain the following transaction to me?

https://blockchain.info/tx/1e90a49f438b6c872b68e7a74813c54ecec8b210a3df6bb3f4e5605a637fd048

Well.... there's that.
Somebody had a burrito filled with Curry. Holy Crap.

We're now lower than the bottom of that big jump up yesterday. Big leg down incoming.
Over $7k today folks? 
Volume is going up slowly which is a good sign.  This time yesterday we were around 7500 on GDAX, today 10700.
Bitcoin is up .26% this it boys, clear shot straight to the moon.
Shorters getting rekt.
I think we can safely consider 7500 gone...
"let them in...."
Mcafee is almost in the "no eat" zone again.

What happened to Bitcoin hash rate. Down more than 60% today.
Show me your wall, and I'll show you mine...
Man. I have this gut feeling we are about to see some upward movement
is there a good explanation for why prices of all cryptocurrencies tend to rise and fall in unison?
RIP

Would be kinda interesting to know how many females are among us on the coinage reddit's. Awe forget it - the implications are endless.
Hello, I've been studying this market since the beginning of April (I've never studied anything over stock-market)

My father-in-law and my mother-in-law were deceived by a group of people and lost a significant amount of money (2000USD) since mid-January.

I need help to learn a little more about this market, I took their wallet from the beginning of April and I'm trying to recover what they lost, they are poor people and without much study.

All help is very important

Thanks in advice

Sorry about my bad english!
I predict a dump shortly in the next couple of hours

Hello how are you? I have seen that they are talking about new icos and all that, but not long ago I heard a coin for youtubers ?? I want to know more about the subject!
Out of interest, anyone here got a Baikal N+? I've seen the stats,  just this evening, and it looks too good to be true. Unless they burst into flame within 6 months? 
Bitcoin is bipolar AF
Sorry folks but this has been nagging at me for awhile. Why do people post a receive address only? Do they really believe someone's gonna send them something? What am I missing here? Or worse yet...please tell me people don't blindly send to these. If they do - phuck it...send me some! On second thought; forget that last sentence.
See how resistance becomes support, doesn't matter which market, the rules are generally the same.

Sorry i wanted to post this on verge sub but they have blocked me. Thanks for your cooperation 
Hello all, a few people and I have been working on a project to link together different communities of crypto traders. Called the [Crypto Trader Network](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTraderNetwork/wiki/network) (very original, I know..). It has been going well and we're seeing some serious progress/growth. It's similar to the SFWPornNetwork but a lot less rigid, much more informal, and entirely based around creating a resource for traders and bringing together crypto related subreddits. 

I am hoping to gain some support from trading communities such as this one. I'm open to any thoughts/ideas/suggestions/requests/criticism, and I would be grateful for any support that can be given.


TETHER UP BOYS

The Eastern Seaboard is beginning to wake up and she's already starting to turn....down. Hey day traders - definite pattern there! Who knows; maybe a new trend line in the making. Any ideas on what to name it?

Cmon phucker - what's another 130 to ya. I've got 4k in sell orders riding on you hitting 7000 and you just can't do it can you? 
If I shorted just a few dollars on BNB futures as many times as I read on reddit and bitcointalk about how it was going to bounce for a couple weeks before the burn(in 2 days) during the last month, I suppose the - if my grandma had balls she'd be my grandpa logic would apply too. Or maybe it's the dazzle 'em with brilliance, baffle 'em with BS logic that really does apply to all here. Saddest part of all is, I wonder how many peeps will be reading up on it after reading this - and throwing their money down before the 14th. The logic was same as with a pharma in stocks and buying in before phase 3b data release on a promising drug. For drug stocks - great strategy! For crypto's - you're on your own!
