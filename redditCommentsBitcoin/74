Is this the part where 9k holds and we jump back to 10k


Oh cool, this is today's bottom, I'm buying. Ah wait, it's going down. Damn it's going up, I have to buy *fast*! Umm no no stop that, it's going down. Aaand it's going up SHIT NO IT'S DOWN AGAIN I'm not buying. Been at this three hours now.
Mods will you unpin the old discussion thread? It took me longer than I care to admit that I was reading old comments.
This quote needs to be preserved.....from about 8 hours ago.....

**Jedi_Ghost_**  **"In the real world I would have been considerate and told you everything is going to be fine, BTC will hit 200k by December and your flaming orange (or shiny gold wrapped) lambo will be delivered to the moon to a parking spot with your name on it. You of course will already be there , riding your stash of bitcoins , waving your cowboy hat screaming Yeeeeeha!**

**But...this is Reddit, nothing to do with the truth or reality or competence of any level. You'd get more useful information by walking into an opium bar in Shanghai and asking any of the drooling comatose patrons about the future of BTC.**
During the 9.5 years since  Bitcoins creation everytime Bitcoin has dropped by a % like it has it has always come back and gone far above the previous all time high, this has happened 100% of the time, repeatedly, and I don't think this time will be any different.
Its a question of patience... 
It’s seems that bitcoin is struggling to maintain its erection

\**yawn*\* I fell asleep at the trading wheel, did I miss anything?
The backlog is up to 15k, any thoughts why?
This market fucking blows. All I do is be a degenerate gambler on bitmex now that its near impossible to make money elsewhere
what about that big green shlong coming up?
And here comes the afternoon dump
Those ups and downs today are ridiculous!! We all finally gonna hate bitcoin! 
honestly if you're buying in right now, you have balls of steel. 
What happened to the Mt Gox wallets? Yesterday they went down to 75 wallets containing about 2000 btc each and today they are up to 80 * 2000btc
Any projections for the low? I’ve heard 9000, but it’s 8800 now. Hmmmmmm
**Down But Not Out: Bitcoin Remains on Hunt for $10K**

https://www.coindesk.com/down-but-not-out-bitcoin-remains-on-hunt-for-10k/

Bitcoin (BTC) is reporting losses today, having failed to beat the key moving average resistance on Monday, however, the technical charts continue to favor a rally to $10,000.

Bitcoin ran into bids in early European hours yesterday, rising to a four-day high of $9,885, adding credence to Sunday's bullish "outside day" candle. Further, BTC also witnessed a bull flag breakout (a bullish continuation pattern) on the hourly chart.
Yes. The world needs to be united otherwise we would just destroy ourselves
Be thinks he's going to make it... 
First post...this is fun to watch
It's actually kinda funny how similar bitcoin look to this chart lol: https://chart-patterns.netfirms.com/bearflag.htm
Its spring, can I just start putting leases on Lambos already? I'm not going to pick up chicks at the local high school with my damn station wagon!
that dump tho
Which one hurts more ? Investing 10K and losing all, or saving 10K but missing out on making 50K ? 

To me missing out on making big money would hurt more than losing my current amount of money.
Looks like we’re gonna kiss $8500 before noon
I understand the allure of consistent profits from trading, but if you're not trading on insider info or extremely lucky, you'll lose money in the long run.

Buy and hold beats every single strategy out there.
Hi!  Pardon me if my understanding of bitcoin is inaccurate, but does anyone else feel as if Bitcoin could potentially help to pave the path toward one world government?  Please, no name-calling. Im not a conspiracy theorist, but the thought of it being used as a tool to eventually centralize world authority seems possible.  Im wondering what everyone's thoughts are?
Anyone else see a bear flag?
Well, crypto is in a bear market and is pretty darn boring.  But considering world events and rising tensions, I still HODL strong.  All it takes is one event to throw off world economies and put us into a recession worse than 2008.  And next time that happens, there will be no bail out as there will be no money left to bail anyone out. There is no Plan A.  USD continues to decrease in value, US Deficit keeps rising...HODL strong to your Crypto.  GLTA
About to really do a hard long dip here. :(
I hate to agree with this analyst but she's been really accurate predicting when it goes down.  https://cointelegraph.com/news/goldman-sachs-bitcoin-has-potential-to-drop-below-february-low-of-5922
I dont understand the people selling at 8.9-9k range, it's still so cheap and as soon if/as we go back to 8.5 we're gonna pump up so why risk it?!
such a boring day today. Whales are going to get frustrated and say that's enough. 
Hot damn
If they truly smother Bitcoin by hijack, just as they disable anything that will take away their profit and power, the digital revolution will become a physical revolution...Yea, Them.
Can someone suggest me reading material on how to use a hardware wallet securely? I’m thinking of getting a ledger nano s. Need to take my btc off Coinbase to hodl, thanks

You would think that traders would team up and as they see the price go down all will pitch in then later turn it around and push it up again...hahah but no way ...as soon as someone gets it going one direction it gets stopped by a huge buy or sell wall...same with cars ...half have indicator lever on one side and half the other....humans.....
8k soon
Calling it by Thursday we’ll be at the 10.5k range..... I think
time to dump it 
Good time to buy...whoever is dumping at $8900 like yesterday will run out eventually.....
Hold your breath boyos we're going for a swim in the waters of $8k


.....with a stone attached to our ankles. 
Win for long term holders. People who do swing trade RIP. 
bitcoin now is basically a trench warfare-
Getting close to dump time!!  When the hell is this going to stop?  They wanted wall street in the picture and they sure as hell got it!!!  Watching as I continue to get Rekt!!!!

Out of trade for now, will jump in back later, nothing interesting at this moment, just dead animal jumps.Good luck.
lol each small pump gets shut down by the bears
Sell all ur fucking shitcoins iduots
Looking good for my $9500 prediction posted earlier in the thread :) 
Larger investors and bots are squeezing out every last wanna be trader. This is going to continue until there is zero point in being a day trader in this space, then things might progress again
I live in Malaysia and coinbase does not yet allow me to sell bitcoins or buy them.. Is there any other recommendation that I could use to convert any bitcoins I have to transfer it to my bank account? I'd very much appreciate the help, I'm new to all this!
Big sell walls @ 9025 and 9050. Trump would be proud. 
Alright that’s it I’m staying put. I have a stack of BTC and BNB I’m going to step out of the market for a few minutes. 
Do you think there will come a time when the price of Bitcoin is far more stable?  Like go up or down less then $100 for weeks?
Is it my connection or gdax website is down?
Almost 4pm and I am wondering if will we see a dump.
Hey guys I have some noob questions about day trading bitcoin. I've never traded anything but I have some spare cash (2k) and I've been watching the markets like it's a sport and would like to try my hand. Am I right at assuming that it wouldn't be worth it for me to try and time jumps and falls due to the transaction fees? Like if I bought in at 8800 and sold at 9400 with 2k would that be worth it? 
I guess day traders right now are feasting on easy buy and sell targets
2h hr chart not looking bad
Anyone think the futures expiration today may be the reason price is being kept at around 9k?
8.5K mark
time to trigger the alarms 
I agree it can’t grow forever, but we aren’t even close to the point. In 2018 will we break our ATH maybe, but we will smash through our ATH within the next few years almost with 100% certainty.

Every month Bitcoin stays at these current prices it becomes the new norm, and the idea of $1k BTC from last year seems farther and farther away, and the downside risk gets further and further away.

I don’t mind the market getting boring in BTC we made enough gains to last the next few months...just create new support and I’m happy. But I said this at $3k and it just kept going up...so it could happen anytime, I prefer a slow controlled rise.

Crazy I know.
VOLUME UP, FUD UP, price range bound!!  Me thinks we're going up boys, Goldman's gotta make their coin!  
calm before the storm

Bitcoin continues to show that it is trending to 8k instead of 10k
By the end of 2018 btc going to the Moon :) 25k at least :) 
Oh my god I am a fool for buying btc! I am panicking and going to sell everything!! Why did I invest my rent money into this?!?!
Bitcoin is trending towards 8k with the upper limit shrinking. 
Daily pump is starting. Get ready to sell at 9600

I am noob and logging in here after week in bed.
and gone mad by seeing it touching 9k
and are rumours of 8k...?

 Awesome!](https://twitter.com/ClothingWhale/status/973653065524953089)
I often read comments referring to the people who brought at the ATH being weak hands who won't stick around much longer... I mean if you held from ~19k through 4.5k and back up I'd say you pretty much qualify as a Hodler now. 

I personally think 'weak hands' were shaken out in Dec / Jan.

Because the value is related with the number of users so we can find some simple cycle:

BTC:(2009-2011) 2 years correction, Bitcoin was born, people began accept and use it. (2011-2013) - 2 years bull run, (2013-2017) 4 years correction, (2017-2021)- 4 years bull run, (2021-2029)- 8 years correction, (2029-2037) 8 year bull run, (2036-2051) 16 years correction....

The ATH will x100 every bull run cycle, this mean we might see the price of 1K2 on 2013, 120K on 2021 and it might reach 1,2 M on 2037.

Do you think I'm crazy?
When LAMBO?
I already sold my bitcoin , now waiting for more crash. I think bitcoin will hit $8000, after $7500 then straight to $4500. After I will start buying . I am sure more crash is coming soon within 24  hours . Keep you money sitting on exchange then after a hard crash you will be able to buy truck load of cheap bitcoin . Good luck friends.
