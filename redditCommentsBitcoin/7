Consensus FOMO kicking in. See y'all on the moon.
**Support The Bulls!**
Wow looks like this is FOMO time. Glad I loaded up this morning.
Everyone's saying consensus is a dud and then this happens lol.
Happy to see that push this morning. Was honestly feeling pretty down a couple days ago but my belief in Bitcoin will never die! 
After leeching off other people's nodes for such a long time, I finally managed to setup my own node running on a spare Linux machine. Feels good.
After all the BS it's still here...... always bouncing back......just buy it pussies... damn... üòÅ
as a chinese,watch live all night is so hard,but i don,t want miss btc pull up!

Hey folks do you think btc will reach 10k by the end of this year?
As the week and the conference progress's , we should see a nice nice pop in alt's where the sentiment is positive. Opening discussions, though a tad one\-sided in their projections \- were interesting and informative. Hopefully too,  for those hesitant to jump in. It all bodes well for the industry.
Did Snoop Dogg just buy into bitcoin?
The f guys what‚Äôs up with blocks... been waiting for hour already for confirmation. 
Legal gambling has to be good news right? 
Nice to see the upward price movement with high volume. Last few weeks it was the complete opposite.
9k never felt so close.
I know you hate this question, but let‚Äôs have a meaningful discussion and try to analyze what is the possible answer of this months old question: When moon?
Is anyone here attending the Consensus meeting over the next few days?
lol, wtf just happened xD
Anyone else at work and listening to the Consensus live?
Look at that greeeen dildoo!
God I love bitcoin
Could do with a huge $1000 Green Candle! 
The bulls are back in town!
Just a little run away from  5 digits 
Here we go guys. Don't be surprise to see big pumps during consensus 2018.

Woohoo! üòÑ

6K NEVER AGAIN!

Bitcoin: consistently shitting the bed since 2018

Nice volume, thanks New York.
I just witnessed a lot of broke dick spoofing on both sides just now. Stupid bots...
got a ways to go if we want to get to the 200 day moving average.  looks like the volume has dropped since the bump
I really don't know what to think of this rise. Sure, I'm always happy when the price goes up.

But it looks suspicious to me. 

A return of the Bart times?

Anyway, I hold and buy the dips. Everything will be fine in the long run...
I finally made the switch to segwit after months of procrastinating, seeing the recent hike in fees gave me flashbacks from December lol. 
Here we go.  Dilly Dilly 
Let‚Äôs get to 10k this week !!!
There‚Äôs a good chance that we‚Äôll see a spike after the consensus followed by a massive dump. We will keep seeing spikes and dumps and will not reach 15k until Mt Gox (the giant terd stain) is scrubbed and finally forgotten.
What is going on with confirmations? I sent a transaction 3 hours ago with adequate fees (well over adequate) and we're looking at 22k unconfirmed now when it was only 6k unconfirmed 3 hours ago
looks like another bart simpson pattern
I said that yesterday would be the last day of $8k BTC, I was wrong.  Today will be the last day of 8k BTC
The whole 2018 has sucked so far when are we going to get into the 100k region that's what I expect of bitcoin not this piddley mother truckin SHIT...........COME ON....
Are we still expecting a surge upwards as it's Consensus week? 
**Come On Bulls, don't waste this week!**
The FUD from shills is like a manual.

Price goes down: Haha never another $15.00 buttcoin

Price goes up: Hurr durr muh free tx's 


So bitcoiners, how did the weekend treat you all? hands up who was able to use BTC in their day to day activities this weekend?
seems like it's going to be a bumpy ride of volatility/uncertainty until these Mt. Gox coins are flushed out
let it get it..!
Vegeta memes when?
Bruh this is getting me crazy fr.
long bart, or wide bart?  
I want to help my uncle be able to set his brick and mortar store front up to accept bitcoin, how do I do it ? 
(Hypothetical) can anyone point me in the right direction for set ups, videos, where to purchase little scanned bois, anything related, YouTube videos, anything. I want to learn how people do it cuz if crypto booms this summer I want to start a business called lucky lemons where it‚Äôll be like a Chick-fil-A except it‚Äôs just the lemonade and possibly toasted meat and cheese sandwiches.

My other uncle (reality) is running a ‚Äúfactoring receivables‚Äù business working with small businesses to pay them money owed to them in xx days - right now, around 95% of it,  (so they can use it to grow now and make more), in exchange for their receivable, 100% of  it.  I can‚Äôt think of a way to work crypto into this especially since smart contracts aren‚Äôt prevalent at all yet. But I know Reddit is a host to very smart folks.

Thank you to any who reply.
