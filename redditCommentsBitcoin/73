Daily Discussion, March 14, 2018
I have good news and bad news.

The good news is that [we bounced on the short term trend line](https://www.tradingview.com/x/zO3nAz5k/).

The bad news is that this stuff doesn't mean shit.
Im the worst investor ever
#THE ~~CAKE~~ MOON IS A LIE
Ran out of xanax again
Thinking about prostitution to earn some more fiat for BTC. ZJs are going for $25 
The falling knife
O Almighty Bitcoin please ascend to the Heavens in the fullness of your glory that you may shower us once more of your blessings and save us from the blight of fear, uncertainty and doubt. 
I told myself I’d sell if it hit 13k. I didn’t. Then I told myself I’d sell if it went down to 10k and I didn’t. I don’t know if I’ll be able to hold on below 7k. I hate this shit. Sorry for the FUD. Just being real. 
Its beyond a bloodbath at this point. It has to be a blood pond or blood lake now.
*Titanic violin scene*
Don't worry about a thing, 
Cause every little thing is gonna be all right...
Just bought $50 worth like I do every Wednesday...
Whats frightening is Europe still has to wake up and see this which will cause more panic dumping 
Moment of silence for Stephen Hawking. 
Every time BTC breaks out of $8k, it gets whacked again. Someone's determined to hold it down. 
Fuck it, I’m buying some more now.  que sera sera.    
I'm testing a new way of losing money by using the MACD/RSI signals combo. I'll let you know how it goes.

[so far I'm losing quite a lot, so I'd say it works as expected]

I just feel sick since I just started investing in crypto a month ago when it looked like the price had leveled off.

I should of just stuck with tech mutual funds...
A fool and their Bitcoin is soon parted.
get your 8k memes ready bois
That's it. I've had enough! I got a super hot tip to put all of my assets into Toys R us.. I'll soon be an overnight millionaire.
Just popped up on the Bloomberg feed:

> Suddenly, Bitcoin seems a bit boring. It might be hard to believe. But after the 1,400 percent rally of 2017, with wild swings along the way, the great crypto craze has cooled, at least for now. For the past month, Bitcoin’s price has stalled between $8,500 and $11,300 -- a minuscule range by its standards. And internet searches for “Bitcoin” have plunged, suggesting public interest has, too.

> “The general public is now realizing that this is not a risk-free, get-rich-quick, investment opportunity and general interest has since diminished,” said Lucas Nuzzi, a senior analyst at Digital Asset Research.

> Online searches for “bitcoin” fell 82 percent from December highs, according to Google Trends. Tweets that mention the coin peaked Dec. 7, at 155,600, and are now down to about 63,000, BitInfoCharts says. And the number of bitcoin transactions is off 60 percent from its record on Dec. 13, according to Blockchain.info.

> December brought “Bitcoin Craze Propels Coinbase App to No. 1 in Apple’s Store.” Now there’s “Bitcoin’s Wildest Days Are Over as Regulators Circle.” Indeed, Bitcoin’s been in the news for all the wrong reasons lately.

> Its price slumped Wednesday after Google said it would prohibit cryptocurrency ads, following Facebook’s move from January. Major banks including JPMorgan and Bank of America banned crypto purchases on their credit cards, the Securities and Exchange Commission has stepped up cryptocurrency oversight and Congress is holding hearings on how to treat the digital coins. Earlier this month, Allianz Global Investors argued the the coin’s “intrinsic value must be zero.”

> “The story with Bitcoin is pretty straightforward,” said Roger Kay, president of research firm Endpoint Technologies Associates Inc. “It went up fast, and then came down even faster. Consumers who flocked to it late got burned. They are in the shadows now, licking their wounds. And others contemplating how to get rich quick are acutely aware that what goes up can come down, and maybe Bitcoin isn’t the way to go about it.”

I had to find another way to make money so I am shorting Volkswagen AG stock.  Something tells me there will be fewer Lambos sold this year.
Although I am seeing my portfolio shrink by the minute, it's kind of exciting. Those last few months have steeled me. Hodling on with the perspective to buy more if it falls really low. Long term I am believing in Bitcoin and I don't need to worry being in the red for a couple of months.
stop whining you lot. i started investing in crypto in january.

think you have it bad.
got in at 18k, anyone on the same boat ?
I get it, Bitcoin goes up and bitcoin goes down but seriously why is the entire crypto space just bleeding right now?
Does anyone know if I can view the Daily Discussion Thread for February 6th, 2018? That's when Bitcoin dropped to the 6,000's. I'd like to see what people were posting then.
It's counter-productive, but I can't stop looking at the price. Kinda silly since my coins are in cold storage and I have limit buys at regular price intervals set up.
gg no re bitcoin
Stephen Hawking was Satoshi
So, I managed to ween myself off checking Crypto prices 100 times a day to the point where I stopped checking every day. The last time I looked was Monday morning...

I'll just pretend I never looked and go about my business again...
I swear to God I can't take it. I've been waiting a fucking week for prices to dip so I could buy in. Last night I decided to buy at $9200.00 since no big dips were happening for so long. Look what happens as soon as I buy. For Christ's sake!
Ok Boys ~$7920 is where we hold them. This is where we fight. This is where they die.

Give them nothing, but take from them everything!
Why shouldn't BTC return to a sub-$5k price?
Whelp!  Looks like it decided to drop again - stairway to hell.  Sigh.  Hopefully the thought police will come back and order a BTC celebration.
Thought you folks might be interested in this...

you guys ready for round 3 ?
One positive for today, Omkar Godbole from coindesk dot com says that Bitcoin is headed for $8k, over the last 3 months he has been wrong atleast 80% of the time.  God knows how he gets paid for the shit he writes.
When in trouble or in doubt, run in circles, scream and shout.
TONIGHT WILL DIP UNTIL HELL!!!!!!!!
fight the bear ! we going up
If the banking system could snarf up all the btc during periods of FUD, could then, the same banking system, control the btc and utilize it’s intrinsic value to rehash the current USD power structure?
Bitcoin holders right now...

Alright boys, hope you loaded up because THAT was the last time you'll be able to buy bitcoin below $8K!!! (for real this time)

/s
Can I have some good karma on this day of buying bitcoin?? 
I have done research most of my life on market trends and I can tell you for a fact I have figured it out. The market is going to go up or down from this point on. Don't take my word for it but I think I nailed it.
My plans for this year was to get at least 0.5 Bitcoin, but that was with Bitcoin at 12k.

But if this trend continues maybe a can get a whole Bitcoin!!!

So yes, I'm happy with the current price. 
I bought bitcoin for breakfast. Love starting a day with a low price. Cheers
tfw when is dip but you are a poorfag with no fiat to buy dip
Doesn't look encouraging at all. Looks like we'll be waiting a bit longer for a true reversal. Was hoping we'd be out of the woods sooner, but guess that's not happening for a while. Pains me to say it, but we may just have to rely on institutional money to bail us out by propping up Bitcoin. 
Continue ze dump 
Wow ..... I haven't seen such negative sentiments for a long time.

Liven up!  BTC is far from dead and the pumps and dumps is going to continue for awhile more.
Just another daily discussion Manic/depressive day! Too much discussion is bad for you people and me too
RIP OF THE BANDAID LETS GOOO BOIS

Pump and dump?
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

stop checking the fucking prices and come back end of the year



I sold my house and bought BTC, ETC, & OMG with the profits...
This is a comment I'm quoting from someone who commented on a Coindesk article.  Curious on peoples thoughts.  I agree that if true they can only bring down the market so far.

"Options market closes at the end of the trading day Eastern time today March 14. They (Killer Whales, owners of the option exchange, and MTGox trustee) always short the options market and they have the control (bitcoin) to manipulate the market. Adoption is at about 9500, so they (the options controllers) have purposely gambled the price to a short using the option funds to pay for their losses. (They raised the margin to 44% to increase the ability to short deeper and still not lose.) But one thing is for sure, the Killer Whales have a LOT of bitcoin and cannot afford to CRASH the market. Fear selling below 8300 to 8500 will present incredible buy opportunities for the big guys or those in the know. I personally bought in at 8800 and will wait for what I believe will be the next two week run up toward 12K. This is my personal SWAG and individuals should not invest funds they cannot afford to burn. I am not a financial consultant and any risk should be based on your own due diligence"
Why is Google waiting until June to ban ads?  Doesn't really make sense as they could ban immediately
We're about to get gox'd again, 3 month chart looking too familiar.
The main reason I'm not worried about bitcoin falling too far down is that some people's greed is quite reliable. We've been down to 6k before this year, and it bounced up to almost 12k on GDAX. Someone who has a lot of coin (and is greedy) won't miss an opportunity to make a huge percentage on a pump.
Currently it seems mr McAfee might end up eating his own dongy after all.
There's a buy wall of 162 BTC on gdax at $8k. Trying to hold the line...
When is this shit going to end already? Wall st people that offed themselves in the 2008 crash look like pansies compared to this. EVERY DAY is the equivalent of that dip 
I’m using this thread to bitch about this bear market. Just getting tired of seeing the drops however I’m not buying any more btc either right now. Once I get my taxes paid and some more money for investing I’ll be buying more btc and perhaps others are Doing the same. This feels a bit like the spring of 2014. 
Well fuck 8k just broke 
Has anyone seen a reversal candle pattern and that is why they are buying now?
I lost $7,000 last night on long positions. Redeemed about $2,000 today shorting, I feel better that I didn't just bend over and get ass reamed by whales/ be a bitch and accept my fate..

Keep holding strong

Depression is easy to fall into and it's real in this market. A lot
 of times in life when things are tough that's when you need to be most optimistic..conversely when things are great thats when you should be concerned.
i am also not selling, i have faith in bitcoin
Not sure what people are so afraid of. This is just mtgox inertia effect, pure and simple. It will fade off over time and in a matter of days or weeks we will be back in business and you'll laugh at yourself for being so emotional now.
Hello, as a forever non-investor in bitcoin. Not that its bad to invest, I just happen to invest in a different market. I just want to thank everyone for entertaining me. This sub is a national treasure. 
Just cashed out and bought my Lambo. Dont drool too hard, boys.

wow so now you can't advertise on google, youtube, and Facebook.  And you can't use credit card.  They are basically trying to shove crypto underground.  Next thing you know CNBC will ban talking about it
1 year ago... btc was at $1k .. relax.

I see strong support at $500.
Bitflyer's Lightning trading software (Bitflyer's GDAX) is so fancy. I'm not use to it as I do most of my trading in USD. Got some money I wanted to put in and just fumbled an order and bought too soon. I quickly sold off, but lost $3.00 in fees. :/ Oh well. Buy Stop Order is set, so I don't miss out while I sleep tonight. I have a feeling we aren't done going down yet though.
Is this dump due to Google Ads partial or temporal ban of ICOs? I think it is only consequently FUD and another opportunity of speculation
Keep Celebrating!!!!!  Rome is burning!!!!  Where is that fiddle?
Can't always go up, this happens. Bitcoin always rebounds.
When bounce
Have my tether bag in one hand and my coins in the other. Long term so I really don't care which way it goes. I just want to go fast in either direction and stop farting around. 
Tired of these drops. Ready for the $1k per day climbs! 
More pain to come?

Maybe by the time BTC price starts going up again I will understand the gdax order book list. But I don't mean to jinx it as never....
Broke below $8k
We're about to test that 8k buy wall.

Edit: And here we go. Buckle up.
what are all these sales, who? Asia wakes up, it's 7am.
Is that Mt Gox shitting again? Not him according to this: https://www.cryptoground.com/mtgox-cold-wallet-monitor/
what just happened
Guys I have a question.. I’m new to crypto, just started the beginning of 2018. I just placed a stop buy in GDAX for $8,000 when the price was $8,200. It’s now saying I have a BTC balance but the price never went to 8k. Does this mean I bought market price? Please help. TIA
What alts do you guys have in your portfolio? 
Rule #1- Only put in what you can afford... but no one ever follows the rules.

Rule #2- Read rule #1 

I want to pull my eyes out
Is there a floor here?
I’m so close to fomoing. Anybody ready?
bitcoin is not cheap enough
Investment firm says bitcoin value is zero: FUD. God damn lets get this price moving up
When LAMBO?
This is annoying

Good god. Is $6k the next support level?
Does anyone know what website had [this](https://i.gyazo.com/e5742391ed606634948482226a922fb4.png) as their icon? Found a screenshot and realized I had minded in 2014, not sure what website by bc was on.

This shit's crazy, I love it! I'm in for the long run, Bitcoin - do me proud.

Bitcoin continues its trend towards 8k instead of the hopeful 10k.
Starting to wonder if this shit is worth it lol
$12.5k by Saturday night. 
I was thinking long term when investing in crypto.. but seeing as our British prime minister seems to want a world war I need my money now to pay for sand bags, tinned food and a Jeep with enough fuel to drive to New Zealand. 
This isn't fun anymore...
6k incoming
We never got a strong bounce from a drop.  Imo this needs to have a sudden drop lower than 6k, followed by a strong fomo bounce to be bullish again.  
Some holds are in red, but i'm still believing and i refuse to sell, am i alone in this case ? ;p
Fuck
Is it safe to assume btc will keep going down?
Looks like I overpaid for my Beanie babies this morning...
I just bought the whole dip lol
Cashed out the little BTC I hold into fiat at 7850 - will re enter at 6000 and hopefully have 10- 20 per cent more BTC - that's the plan anyway - but with my timing it will probably rally now!
life is like a Bitcoin

it goes up, it goes down

it almost never goes just right.
Huge discount on the price today, excellent time to buy
Look at bitcoin as a house. Say you buy a house, when the housing market crashes do you sell your house lol no you hodl on for the ride. #hodl on tight
Loool GREEN LAMBO MOON MOON LAMBO DILDO LETS GOO
I started in july of last year. So much fun. Put it in and it doubled in a few weeks. This isnt fun anymore. Now im scared and pulled most of it out
Fuck this, now I just want my money back and peace of mind. No lambos and moons anymore.
Google and Facebook banning adds just goes to show how much banks are scared of bitcoin and how far they are willing to go.

This is a moment of revolution that we are living through. We have a front row seat to one of the most exciting periods of our lives. 

Embrace this moment because the fight will be a part of history. We will be telling our grand kids about this one day and explaining how you had to use dirty bills  to buy things and how banks controlled everything! 

We need to stay strong and buy more bitcoin!!
Fully prepared for this to revisit $7500-$8000. 

Good chance to scoop up more but with the dump this morning and the general downward trend I don't think we're finished. When America starts waking up it will get dumped on further. 
The lower this goes the bigger it'll bounce. We witnessed this with the drop to 6k recently. Bounced to 11k in a week.. thats almost double. I hope this drops, because once we hit the bottom its money making time. 
7,500 approaching.

WHERE IS THE BOTTOM???
TimeLock your coins rookies.  
Bought below the 200 day moving average. Time for a reversal FOLKS!
Being at 7k is so depressing. Makes me feel hopeless in a sense. I will HODL no matter what though. Something this unique was not created for no cause.

I hate to cave in and say a bear market is here, but I'm not sure how this will miraculously turn around.  I think the fact that you can't advertise Crypto now and buy with a  credit card make this market completely different from how it was before the ATH of 20k
You know what I like about this community? We might not like each other all that much and we fight on the way down and we fight on the way up. But we kinda build some sort of connection on a weird level.  *keep it weird fuckers.

it might go sideways for some more weeks, it might even drop for some more weeks but the coin will rule again, sooner or later.
we are dippening again
The dumpening v 3.0
O.O too fast to type

bbye 8500

Sooo when everyone buying runs out of money...we hope sellers is done too......

guys be careful buying into this dip might fall too fast 
Seems like we're going back to earth.

next support to 6 feb double bottom,
but i think wales want 3.5k.....

lol. I'm not even angry, this is amazing.

They want to shake the BTC out of everyone. Oh hell nah
large drop but very little bear volume going on. what could be the reason immmmmmm? (manipulation)
I was wrong... This might be one of those times to sell and wait for the support
I think we're at the point were investors are everyone is wondering *'will it go down further or should we jump back in?'*
Help please! I have a mistaken order on GDAX it says "pending" and it won't cancel . . 
$8100 inbound.

Sub 200 SMA at the moment. Not good news.

International FUD day!
We bring this on ourselves by reacting to every little stimulus
Around how much money do u guys have in bitcoin rn?
I was hoping that when today's Cboe's Bitcoin futures contracts expired the price would bounce quickly.  But I guess not (yet anyway.)
Are we just buying Mt Gox at the price they determined to sell at? If they sell too quick the price goes down, if they sell slow the price stays relatively the same. If this is the case, they might have decided to sell in between 8-9000 over the next few months and we should get used to them controlling  the market not letting it get too high by selling off as soon as it start reaching 10,000 to bring us back down to 9,000. 
I love buying 6k of bitcoin at 9300 last week and watching it go up and then crash all while my money is still pending 
Is it better to buy from coin base or Robinhood? I heard robinhood does not charge a % fee and it comes to the account within 1 business day? 
Good God, Here we go again hang Onnnnnn...
Asia says whutt?
GDAX buyers and sellers just making faces at each other . . 
Well, this is interesting. Have a look at the market [momentum](https://www.tradingview.com/x/aSRn1K4Z/), which is one of the few indicators I tend to trust. See anything unusual? The sell momentum after the price increase has lost strength. Meaning that people / bots / whatever have been selling *less* than before even though the price has been basically the same between the two momentum periods. In short, it looks like buyers have surprisingly regained some trust in the market in the last hour. So there's a high chance $8000 is actually today's bottom. We'll see.
They said bitcoin was going to hit 2k! why is it going up. My tether is waiting.
What is the status on the darknet markets? They seemed like a big deal when Bitcoin was first starting out. But how are they doing today? Are they just a niche thing or are they buzzling with activity? Does anyone know?
Closing all stores! Where am I going to buy my toys? 
This is depressing
we are all waiting for you to sleep so we can do the things that will make the numbers move in a direction
GDAX just gave me the 'view only' message.. WTH? It says BTC/EUR trading is not yet available in your region, but it was fine a few mins ago. Anyone has this issue? 
Tried to breach the 200 day avg.
I've stayed with it for so long that it's probably just as likely to rebound half-way or so as to go to 6k
24 hour volume is back to 36k on GDAX
Looks like you lot had a bumpy night, hopefully we start going up now. 
what are the chances that if i buy a BTC now it would be the actual btc somebody lost in MtGox? there should be a way to track/prove it, no?
See you at 5K. Keep buying that “dip” lol
TO THE MOON!!
i wish i didnt spend my 2 bitcoins in 2014
It's all going to shit. I wish everyone well.

A year ago, Bitcoin was at $1000.  What has changed fundamentally from a year ago?  If you bought a year ago, you are up more than 800%.  Even if this crap does rise again, it will be a slow go.  In my opinion, Bitcoin has a better chance of going to $1500 than $15,000.  But again, it's just an opinion.  But seriously, can someone explain to me what has changed fundamentally since it was $1000 just one year ago?  
Ok will buy more, still prefer to lost money than the next train, crazy or not will see
Google banning crypto ads, but also coming meeting in the EU maybe causing worry. Maybe price won't recover to 10K until after the EU meeting?
What does FUD mean and why do people write hodl instead of hold? Thanks.
HODLLLL turning into SODLLLLL
Daily scheduled 5% drop.  
I'm thinking down below 5k this time

Even though its more risky...much more fun than having the money in the bank for 5% per year....fk the government and the bank  ..i..
Calm your tits we shall be glorious again.
wales have a surprise,i think....
everyone now have buy ready at 6k-6,5k....
and ...surprise ! oh,oh btc is a 3.5k...
how much further do you guys think it will dump? I have not checked all day and just now saw the dump. Should I take my BTC out and then put it back in after it dumps some more or just hodl on to it?
Either 7.2k or 4.8k for next support
When LAMBO?
Reverse was at $7700 who ever sells now will loose to the strong hands your choice
I bought a vacation with bitcoin today and replenished my funds immediately. Stop worrying so much about the price (speculating) and actually use it as a currency (more transactions/use the more it will grow over time) because it's pretty dang easy to use. 
Isn't there a halving or a release of BTC this year? What implications will that have on supply/price etc? Anyone?
We're buying the dip, you can thank Europe later
theres no new money coming in anymore theres money on the sideline waiting imo we will fall to 5-6k before we gain some traction sorry to break it to all the moonboiz
Welp, I’m out. This market is complete and utter dogshit. 
Time to make bitcoin great again!
Keep buying the dips until 3k guys, its the only strategy that works. Selling now and rebuying when the bubble has fully popped is for losers that like money.
its over for us, told this sub that bitcoin is going to ruin the entire crypto market 
Below $7800 and falling fast :(
blood on the street presents great buying opportunity.
Okay. I'm selling everything. This is fucking absurd.
Guys just chill out.

Price has never and will never be relevant. 
All ready for some capitulation? What is your breaking point?
Looks like we're gonna test 8.4k-8.5k resistance again. Here's to hoping.
I know it's hard to remain positive at times like this but these are the times we have to stay strong and remain positive. 
If anyone is remotely interested in the Tėther situation, I recommend watching this: https://youtu.be/5KXHgh2rTTw?t=9m31s
Just cancel my lambo order.... it’s a Toyota Corolla for now...
Does Lamborghini take a Corolla as a trade in...
This bear market is draining
A good indication of when bitcoin hits the bottom is when it hits its "WTF" price. A price where no one thought it would go that low. Usually the price doesn't stay at the bottom for very long and bounces back.
Well volume picked up ...and $8200 is holding...
What would happen to bitcoin if sha256 becomes as broken as sha1?
Huge amount of buy walls around $8300 so who knows we may have hit a bottom (for today). 
Guess Asia chose to dump
It seems like one entity selling on GDAX. The buy(green) walls come down in an instant without all the coins being bought.
Lube is ready 
there is no god
What we need right now is a nice rumor. Anybody?
Going to 6k is what I see charted with very high confidence.
We touched the bottom, welcome back up hodlers.
I didnt sell, show me your love now Btc.i deserve it. (Bouhouhou ;p)
Everybody says to invest in bitcoin only what we can afford to lose. If we believe that, and that everybody is really investing only what they can afford to lose, there is $470B at spare in this world. Imagine all the good it could do. But instead we choose to gamble!
Ladies and Gentlemen!

Welcome to the crash of the week. 
Time to buy and I'm like William Wallace on the battlefield.

*Hold.. hold.. HOLD.. NOW!*

I wish I had about 100k to throw at bitcoin right now
Right believers !!! , make a guess, what would be the next support (pivot) ? 

Come on, share your thoughts.

I say 6K again ...
This bitch is going straight to 10k
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-14/bitcoin-pop-culture-moment-fades-as-fad-gives-way-to-regulators

Interest in BTC is fading - that means new money flowing in may be reducing.

I think I should probably cancel my buy orders and see what happens over next couple of days.
Will be a rough middle of the night... 7300$ by morning
$7900
If you are invested in cryto for the long haul or day trade this is the perfect time to buy. I bought in last year when it went from 700 to 2000 at the start of last year. Was a newbie buy low sell high. But I realized what BTC is about I stuck it out and took some profits at 17000. Now I am buying and hodling, I understand the game so if you are a newbie buy and hodl this is the best time to invest and you will see home unstopable this crypto stuff is.  
With the greatest respect, if you don't like Bitcoin or don't believe in the the tech, can you just **FUD off**, thanks.
I know I will get flamed for this, but I think bitcoin is going to be coming down a lot more in value... I won't even attempt to guess how much, as I don't want people screaming at me about providing proof, etc.

I sold my BTC at 20k, and I've been waiting ever since for the right time to jump back in. I do see the value with "HODLing", but with BTC being as volatile as it is, I think it's probably better to find a middle ground, and make calculated decisions to buy/sell, and not deviate from your own logic by way of emotion.
And the USA wakes up to byers price of the week.......
This is brutal. This is going to 6k by tomorrow :(
We just can't have a cryptocoin that is based on what is shown in the news, any bad news will trigger a massive sell...
Has anyone else notice on the gdax 1 day chart that there’s a pair of tits? Maybe it’s a sign?
YouTube armchair analyst predicts a possible hard drop to $7,684 because of the bears dominating the market. 

It's an hour long with some waffle but just skip through that.

Maybe those trolls from G20 do something.
Is there anywhere in Iowa that I would be able to spend Bitcoin? Maybe at a store or a restaurant or something. I don’t know why I want to spend some but I do want to. Not a lot though, obviously, this is still an investment to me. However I do believe that mass adoption and actual use is more important than investment. 
Isn't the google news bullish for BTC, people rarely promote bitcoin off ads, the altcoins bring down the legitimacy of BTC, and this helps kill off more BTC competitors.

Whatever the present BTC price is on GDAX or Binance  that would be considered the "spot" price, correct? If so, is their a correlation between spot price and the futures price? . . I guess I am wondering if there is a effort to bring down the spot price to be more in line with the futures market's ranges. BTC as a commodity being way overpriced to them and needs to be "reeled-in" before it is completely institutionalized? Whales, board of trade, Wall St. etc. after all are in control of this thing.
Could someone suggest wallets and exchanges for someone interested in investing in BTC in Canada. Would love to be able to get a coin if it drops low enough. 
Sorry for asking stupid noobish questions, but what are nodes and channels?
Here we go! **$8598 and falling!**
ULTRAAAAAA COMMMBOOOOOOOOOOO
Bought 50% of my funds...leaving the rest to see if it goes even lower...
the dow is also down 
Gonna bounce
Sooo anyone wanna call the bottom????
Might not even make $8200...selling slowing down on all the charts...
Saw everyone freaking out and thought shit had been going down hard. Looked like just the usual 8am or 9am PST dip though? This has been happening almost everyday for over a week now?
I know of something like that isn't it called transgression marketing? 
A recent phone call just saved me from the bear trap!!!  I was all FOMO'ing as it went back to 8.4... and now it is trending down again!  Go bots go!
just got the email from robinhood yet my stupid app won't let me buy yet, anyone else?
buying the dip I guess
Yesterday I was able to trade the tight swings a little with success . . that's gone today ;< 
They can try but they won't win.
There’s something queer happening on Cryptocompare, the bitcoin value is jumping up and down by about $700 every minute.
Trying to find a legitimate exchange to sign up to in Canada. People have suggested Quadrigacx and coinsquare, but with a bit of researching all I find is lots of people yelling scam as they wait months trying to withdraw money. I would really appreciate some suggestions on other options that have a good history of paying out customers and reasonable rates. Thanks in advance!
What happens with all the lost bitcoin?  For example, if you die and your wallet info is lost forever.  Or if you just lose it forever yourself.  Over time, wouldn't inaccessible bitcoin accumulate?  How does this effect the bitcoin economy?  Would it?  Does any of that lost value have an effect?

Good time to buy or wait for Asia to wake up?
$8500 followed by the real drop.... lets see some more blood :D


I got into bitcoin and other cryptos to try to save a bit of a nest egg with the hopes that I could see my investment grow I've seen ups and downs but honestly if I do well I hope to use some as a down payment on a home and the rest for my  kids college education. I think lambos are great but I believe most people with 200k would find other ways to spend it to help improve the lives of the people around them. If we would spread more down to earth finacial dreams of ours we may find more support. And hopefully make it harder for tv personalities to make fun of us. Any financial dreams of yours u would like to share? #hodlGang 
Wow It sounds like people here are pushing the fud that they are publishing . Downvote remember we controll this thread not pay to play. Any positive post about anything bitcoin are immediately followed by spam of fud same topics are pushed that are recently published this is a tactic and reddit is a tool don't let people influence u to much here. odds are lots sold and are hoping and will do anything to drive the price down in order to buy back at much lower prices 
See this gox thing dude cmom
Turned 1500 into 5k over the last year ty bitcoin!!
All my bears can go and do whatever they want.
Was that a new bottom? I kinda hope not, cause I had a stop loss order at 7999 lol.
Don't want to scare you with reality but every stock and crypto coin is a ponzi scheme. If the money stops flowing in it drops and could die out. So what happens if everyone starts selling Intel? and no more buyers. The stock drops to nothing. Just remember traditional stocks and crypt is just gambling.

Wow.   Very unusual.   The numbers on this thread have been going up much faster than BTC has been going down.  Any correlation?   
if it doesn't drop how to buy low ? 555
Pack it up, see you at goblin town guys ..

This is awesome, I've been looking for a good entry point for a while now. Let's take this party down to $2K!
anyone ever notice that the negativity of this market is particularly from wealthy figures and old whites? Just sayin old whites 
Typically when I see volume high, price rises shortly after.  Is that correct? 
[Anyone know how to do this?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/84jn48/is_there_a_bitcoin_calculator_that_can_calculate/) I suck at math and this is a pain in the ass on Bitflyer's Lightning. (Bitflyer's GDAX)

wtf lol
Which way will BTC go when USA wakes up?
Bitcoin already up 5% today. BUY!
And the buyers beat the sellers once again...and back up we go slowly but surely.....
Do you know some global ideas for growth?
Back in the game at $8,100. Hopefully it’s up from here. 
The [hourly sell momentum](https://www.tradingview.com/x/RH8B9Yey/) is fading but there is no indication yet that the [daily sell momentum](https://www.tradingview.com/x/aT2iDd5g/) is fading as well. We'll have to wait until tomorrow.
**New thread started, see you there.** 
John Oliver really fucked this entire market.
Down, down she goes! 

Saw misguided hodlers ragging on some guys bear market prediction (which is spot on) 

Good luck hodling for no reason - this is going to be a nasty ride for some of you.
Don't post bad news. Bad news = fud. So if anything bad happens, don't tell us. I'd rather be ignorant and happy than know the truth and be sad. That should be the official policy of the bitcoin community. Ban bad news.
can anyone give me a bitcorn for like treefitty
1% owns 99% of bitcoins, they dictate and control the market. Bitcoin continues to get hit by a non stop wave of bad news, in my opinion, created by people associated with the bank industry and stock market. Google and Facebook are probably concerned about their own stocks after the stock market plunged and I don't doubt that the fact they banned bitcoin ads has something to do with that. Do I really understand how buying a coin helps the technology behind it if it's already created and ready to be used? NO. Do I believe it has benefits? I want to. Now.. if you want the technology to survive and thrive so the value goes up. Don't try to milk every dollar. Hold. Because you are killing bitcoin.
$12.5k by Saturday night.  
OMFG
The big news of the day is that Google is banning cryptocurrency ads. I'm sure that will affect market confidence

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-14/google-to-ban-cryptocurrency-initial-coin-offering-ads-in-june
The past week when we went back to 10.8 or so and then down has been pure manipulation down imo. We went from 10.6 to well under 10k in a minute candle on GDAX from a huge market sell. All drops since have been 1000+ coin market sells that have tanked the price. It's not a bear market, it is people trying to drive the price down. Look at the sell wall going up? Thin as hell. Price spikes back up as buying pressure is there but then big market sell to a lower low. Been happening now for the past week. Once we break up again I think we should see $12k+. 
Keep calm hodl gang!
are you the kind of people that always cry because buy ATH???, then take the chance y buy now.
Atleast volume is up :)
that looks like it might've been the bottom
Unconfirmed transactions are piling up right now. Trying to send bitcoin and it's taking forever.
Deadcat bounce! boing boing boing!
The current squeeze is fine.

Lose hands are going to leave.l; someone is going buy there coins.

Better news all major alt coins are falling at a faster rate. Is it greater lack of confidence in Alta bs btc? or is it people trading in to be on the buying end of bitcoin transactions as prices drop?

Let’s find out.

 If you look on the chart you'll see that exactly one year ago price was "just" $1000, even at 5k price will still be up 400% since then, but has bitcoin's utility gone up 400% since then? I don't know anyone rushing to go buy bitcoin for its utility, we've got Visa or Paypal for that, so there is mostly speculative buyers in this market, "hodlers". And for that, speculation, bitcoin remains a fine tool. 
Post from 6 February.....[–]berlin_x 1 point 1 month ago 
Looks like a bull trap to me... long term trend is still negative, trading volume is high, trend line resistance has not been overcome yet... What do you guys think? So can all the fomo people on here pls fk off somewhere else....
Who's is dumping at $8700? Is there any fud news?
I trust in 8600 support, now waiting to btc to go up.
This is honestly pathetic if this dump is caused by the google ads news. like seriously guys that has absolutely nothing to do with crypto and its place in the future. I mean you don't see ads for the USD do you?
the moon
Lambo & chill?
Why are we dropping again there is no major bad news 
well guess bitcoin breached the bear flag
Bitcoin lost another 300 usd, as I was driving.
It has begun...
Waiting for the $8,000 dip to buy some more. Anyone else on the same page?
whatever is happening isn't happening fast enough
Anyone know why the buying and selling froze for a few minutes on gdax? , I thought it was a service interruption but it wasnt.
Just look at that one minute chart, it wants to go lower.  LIMBO baby!
looks like we are going to drop to 5k min. Hodl and ride it out.
Time to bail out?
I can't bring myself to sell... I'm too afraid it'll moon without me. When should I sell?
People need to realize it's whales selling downticks at a small loss on exchanges while accumulating more bitcoins on bitmex via leverage.

the exchanges bots are working hard, soon everything will be green, till duds think about whales
You got no say, you have been on reddit for 4 weeks, very insignificant time just like your opinion. 
Where are the people who downvoted me yesterday when I called this?

I'd like an apology. Thanks. 

edit: lol @ the downvotes. Hows that HODLLLLIN goin bois?
Guys, it will go sub-3000 (if we are lucky, may be 1k). I'm not saying it will not go back up to 100k, and buying the dip here is a bad long-term strategy. But you can't extrapolate based upon the BTC bull markets and not also recognize how far down this thing goes in bear markets.

Why is it that I find myself thinking this rhyme based upon what is going on today, when recalling the flop in February?
i selling one of my lung for 1 btc, anyone?
guys. we need to get going.. pump this up for the end of the week to close above the line and unleash the bulls for smashing this bear line. #BITCOINDONTGIVEAFUCK!
Welcome to Black Wednesday!
If this is all the google news does to the price then I think we're going up soon
Boring same FUD/FOMO posts every day. All the negativity when the price drops a little and everyone is super positive when the price goes up a little. I saw noone talking about bitcoin dieing/no new money/blabla when the price went close to 10k a few days ago.
If you look at the negative news in last two days alone you will find at least 20 different stories which are anti-crypto, google banning crypto ads and IMF’s convicted chief’s shitslang being among the top stories. It didnt do much to the price seriously, I mean it was going 5-10% down anyway. 
dead cat bounce?
Google and YouTube won't allow Crypto advertising.  The powers that be sure are scared aren't they, but how will Crypto continue if you can't find it?

hello, I want to make a video about crypto and some of the bad falls that have happened. I see so many about the successes and only see random reddit comments about how people lost everything. 

 I'd like to get the word out there and am looking for real people to talk to who did put everything on the line and lost everything. Let me know if this is something possible within this thread. 
This reminds me of that SEC meeting drop. People sold off right before the meeting but then the meeting was positive and price went up again.

The price will probably go up during or after the G20 meeting.
Time to tether up boys! /s
Sorry duds, you lost your LAMBOS (TESLA, Pizza...) still exchanges make insider trading and price manipulation
Be care, bull trap and then we keep going down, just like the last 2 big green candles in 15 minutes chart.

Price predictions for the evening/night? I personally think it's going to stay around the 8k - 8.4k area for a while, before making any sort of significant swing up (or down, who knows).
Anyone have any data on the number of trades in crypto that are bots only?  I've read the number is as high as 99% of trades are bots.  Someone who knows code should be able to build an AI that analyses all of the trades and picks the trading patterns so we can see when the bots are selling and buying.  Bots are programmed and are therefore predictable.  Anyone know of anyone tracking this?

Everyone I know is getting out, luckily I got out at 11500. I know loads of people that are waiting for 10k again and then drop their bags. Even with Google censuring crypto.
