Is there a site that still tracks days destroyed? I've asked a couple times and it gets lost in the "Daily Discussion" bullshit.
You could try https://oxt.me/charts then /Transactions then BDD.  Click to drill into a month.



Apparently Jameson Lopp asked the same question a number of months ago:

This one tracks the [past 30 days](https://fork.lol/blocks/cdd).
I saw your comment. I think there is one but forgot the link.
