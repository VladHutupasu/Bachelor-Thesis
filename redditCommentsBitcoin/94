Holy shit this market is so impatient and knee-jerk.
as long as it stays above 10k im happy. we went from 6k to almost 12k within i think 11 days or sth? thats  not healthy and everyone knows it. little correction for a few days to 10k and its absolutely fine. let the weak hands sell. its mid february, some guys need to learn to relax and see the long term development.

we got some good news for bitcoin recently, it will rise again, next step would be 12k then in march
I went from 6 coins in Nov to 3 coins now...just hodl it not worth trying to pull before the dip. you end up loosing more in the long run.
Why are we stuck in $10,500 purgatory? 
At times like this I find the best play is to leave this forum.  
Prepare for the panic posts. I see they have already started.
Buying opportunity approaching

Bought a little bit just now. Hope you fellow comrades will follow as well. This is a great price opportunity based on the recent movement toward $12k.
Bulls r back
A lot of people think these occasional pull backs are very healthy for long term growth. 
I thought I would share this - https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/07/bitcoin-education-at-high-schools-and-colleges.html. 

My cousin goes to this high school and they teach about crypto in one of their finance classes. Pretty interesting and I love the fact that they are teaching them young! 
Why bother to daytrade when it is safer and more to gain by hodl.
I just don't get it when bitcon is known to be volatile.
You will never manage to buy at peaks anyway 
Bought at 18,900 sold at 6,000. Bought back in at 11,700 sold at 10,200. Am I doing this right? 
Wow, I did not expect all this pessimism on here today. I am excited about all the Bitcoin news this week. Try zooming out to the 14 day view! I just bought more.
Fox4 news in Kansas City is currently showing a Bitcoin 101 special!
Just another day with Bitcoin folks.  
Hoping 10.2k is the bottom...I like big bottoms. 
After almost 10 years and consistently growing interest, enthusiasm, and price, how can anyone believe with any sincerity that Bitcoin is going away?
Sorry folks, this is my fault.  I bought some yesterday afternoon and should have known it would make the bottom fall out of the market.
What is the reason for the absurdly high fee at Bitcoin atm’s? I went to a RockitCoin atm earlier and the price of bitcoin was at 12,435 while on Coinbase it was at 10595.  WTF no thank you 
Simple, the one whale that took a big dump yesterday triggered this selloff. Can’t blame him. Oh well, here we go again. 
Get those 10k memes ready again, boys.
see you guys at saturday/sunday ATH, and next week again on wednesdays dip ! :)
So heard an ad today for a mortgage lender where one of the things they listed as a good use for your loan would be to buy the btc dip. Clearly a wise plan.
A lot of you are so incredibly weak emotionally when it comes to this. It's honestly really sad to see.
I hate crypto but I’m not selling 😂

Its not yet sunday mr bear
America wake up!!!
Hi im complete noob and got excited about bitcoin and crypto so i found its easy to buy on Coinbase and bought about $2000 worth on there, now im wondering should i move the BTC and LTC and Ethereum to a wallet for safe keeping or is coinbase safe? I know fuck-all about crypto other than i am ahead 62%
Been waiting for a dip should I buy now? 
They will sell, take profit. then pump back in
stop market selling your coins in this environment.
For people that were thinking about buying this is a good opportunity.  It's like $1k less then yesterday.  
shit stop... need 12k!
Do we have an update on the Tether subpoena FUD?

Has China official put crypto on their great firewall yet?
Bought more @ 10.2

Saw a reverse triangle pattern forming in the cloud..... Obvious bear den.
I know people are worried because of a 5% drop, but the single most bullish signal (50EMA crossover of the 200 EMA line) happened yesterday evening on the 4h chart. This is really the only signal that comes before every bull run.... Maybe I'm naive, but why would it be wrong this time? It's a normal dip after 2 weeks of a bull run...
Put in a cheeky buy order for 9500, I’m hoping for a quick dip and straight back to 12k!!
Coinbase? Is it working?
So Coinbase is fucking itself lol.
Oh good. We've just closed a pretty nice green candle on the 4H chart.
Guys it's Feb. 22 time for a new thread.
Bitcoin is going to go so high up idk why people are selling or not putting all their money into it
up down left right WTF IS THIS BS
I said 12k by end of this week ! WTF are you doing guys ???
Aliens have invaded! Quick!  Sell while you have the chance!  They are crab people!  CRAB PEOPLE!!1!!1
I guess we`re in Elliott Wave 5.2
https://youtu.be/9sQuu5FWAmw

It`s all a selffullfilling Prophecy, everyone said it will pull back near 11.800 to 12k and then break through 12k to go up, so no surpsrise for now. If everyone says it, everyone will adopt it, so the next prohecy would be that it will go up ;)
Good days are coming! HODL
This is bullshit, I want a refund!
For those of you waiting for a mini-dip this is your chance to buy. 
All those salty people who try to fear because they sold. thats fucking cancer. late 2017 investors have sold or just doesn't care anymore. thats why the volume is so low and now easier to manipulate. downvote everyone who fud guys. they don't do it because they care about you or your money, but because of their own greed. they also dont care about blockchain and what itcan do for the world. just money. fucktards. 
I switched teams, on da Bears now
Hi! New here.  What's everyone's favorite app they use for buying/selling?  I'm not looking to invest too much - just $100 so nothing with really high fees.
So the 6% profit takers? 
One dippy boy today.

Hey everyone, made a reddit account today just to ask this question as it's been confusing and bugging me.  And, I accidentally posted this on yesterday's topic, so I'm re-posting here instead...

I'm new to cryptocurrency and have messed around a little on GDAX, nothing too crazy. What I'm confused about is every time I see this: https://i.imgur.com/6x585HF.png

It's at the literal lowest point of a 24-hr span, so why is ANYONE selling at all? If one was to sell at all, wouldn't one typically want to sell on a HIGH point of the day?! I know the joke is "buy high sell low" ... but guys, really, seriously, why does this happen? And yes, I do understand the fear of losing everything, and I can totally understand selling WHILE it's in a freefall. But once it's reached the bottom of an arch, and "straightened out" like in the pic due to resistance, whey would anyone still think "Nope!  I still wanna sell!" ?
Someone sold 12 BTC on Gdax
Here come the FUD boys, where were you hiding ?
Crows.
Stay Strong, trust BTC.
BFD. BTFD...
I'm looking to buy more btc w/new money.  Sick of wiring new money into coinbase/Gdax and buying there because of the fees.  As a US resident is there a cheaper alternative?
Look at the 6 hourly chart. Looks like a correction (happens every couple days) then then it will continue its upward trend 
When hodlers hear the bear whales and panic sellers coming....

bulls or bears?
I believe exchanges are causing it. whenever the prices stabilize the trading volume goes down then price manipulation orders are being placed by exchanges and the trading volume increases 2-3x which is 2-3x profits in trading fees. They are the biggest whales in crypto market and some of them are using fiat created out of thin air (Mt.Gox, Tether, probably many others)
[deleted]
is it just me or does bitcoin generally accelerate down faster than accelerate up? seems like the down goes faster whereas the climb up takes longer and lasts longer
when the exchanges bots are disconnected, everything will turn green again. it's time to see the connection
[removed]
Do I need to move my BTC from a Legacy address to a Segwit address if I plan to HODL?
wow, the mempool was almost empty this morning

https://blockchain.info/de/charts/mempool-size?timespan=24h
With the low tx fees and increasing SegWit support is it worth moving BTC from P2SH to Bech32 addresses?
[deleted]
Many years from now, when billions of people use Bitcoin every day to buy their coffee, people will be amazed that Bitcoin was once one of the most volatile investments. Supply and demand will be so perfectly balanced that the value of the US dollar will seem like a risky investment in comparison.
such a strange depth chart last weeks. can't get a hold on it 
LOLOL. A LOOOOT of you panic so incredibly easily. Sideways price action for a few more days and then we'll go up.
Going to bed... up to asia if i wake up happy or miserable😁
[deleted]
why the volume is not growing as compare to BTC price
Damn it BTC, do something, don't just stand there.
Don't worryyyy and just buy if you haven't yet, see you in few days
Too many red dildos. Red dildo make me sad.

It’s buy time.
Panic sell so I can buy more!!!!
I have decided to not look at the price for at least 24 hours, too much stress and I don't want to start back taking drugs
It's hilarious how much this sub goes into meltdown everytime there is a dip.
you're welcome for this rise.  I sold some of my stash.  be nice to me or I'll buy some and wreck these markets!
Am I correct that trading volume is really low? I wonder why it's so slow.
Aaand we're going up.
According to Investopedia: What is 'Capitulation'
Capitulation is when investors give up any previous gains in stock prices by selling equities, to get out of the market. Capitulation involves extremely high volume and sharp declines. It also usually involves panic selling. The term is a derived from a military term which refers to surrender.

BREAKING DOWN 'Capitulation'
After capitulation selling, many traders think there are bargain buying opportunities. The belief is that everyone who wants to sell a stock for any reason, including forced selling due to margin calls, has already sold. The price should then, theoretically, reverse or bounce off the lows. In other words, some investors believe that capitulation is the sign of a bottom.

Investors can only identify capitulations after they have occurred. While traders often attempt to anticipate capitulation selling or buying, the reality is that capitulations are outcomes that result from the maximum psychological and financial pain that can be endured by investors before liquidating their positions. (To learn more, see: Profiting From Panic Selling.)

Using Technical Analysis to Identify Capitulations
Capitulations often signal major turning points in the price action of underlying securities and financial instruments. Technical analysts can visually identify capitulation using candlestick charts. Hammer candles often form at the end of a selling frenzy when the lowest price is made, as capitulation sets in and signals a price bottom followed by a reversal bounce on heavy volume. Traders who wanted to sell their positions have done so as panic reached a climax. As fear starts to subside, greed may set in and reverse prices.

Bitcorn giving me a limp dik today.

Does anyone like seeing how in a sea of red, bitcoin's dominance keeps going up?
I like big green dildos.
https://i.imgur.com/pIwYNIg.png
These Fk'ers and their FUD talk, really has me considering pulling out $1,000 worth and keeping it 'until it drops to 6k'.......ARGH!!....WHAT TO DO??
Those who sold at 6k waiting for dip may soon celebrate.
America save Europe please!
-> looks at bitcoin prices. Sees it's almost the same price as 24 hrs ago.
*sign*
Y'all know bitcoin has to test sub-10k prices sooner or later. So can we get this over with by going to Point A to Point B with little resistance please?
Bitcorn might bounce to 12.8 but then will probably fall to 9. This is indicated by the helmet formation it is currently drawing with a japs eye at the top. 
Apparently BTC got fond of the 11K area.
Good luck 
its dropped 7% in the last 24 hours.... its going to zero guys. sell sell sell. i told you so, its worthless. bitcoin is dead...

fuck off. end of rant.
I was expecting a larger bump in segwit txs since Bitfinex activated it.  But I haven't seen much movement.

Can anyone confirm that Bitfinex is giving segwit addresses for deposits and sending withdrawal requests with segwit outputs?
I have my shit in Coinbase. Should I move it to GDAX?
When the drop started, I thought it would go much lower than the first drop level. I'm not shocked at all by what we are seeing now. For the time being. 
The Zaif news has probably devalued BTC
What are the various scenarios that would result in you losing your coins on lightning network?

-I've heard that being offline is one but sounds vague 
I love how the BTC dominance percentage continues to increase. Trust the process.
Ok, I’ve been thinking about this: This sell-off is good people who bought in at 6-7k and are making a profit. PLEASE SELL. There’s a small chance that you will be able to buy back at that price. Bitcoin is a long game. Happy selling.
Dam that's the last time I sell when it's going down, ended up buying back in and losing $200 that's the fucking third time now!
When do you guys plan to cash out btc? What would be your selling price? 
these whale geeks collude with bots to do price fix during their pumpin run-ups. 11.8k to  10.5k read in between the lines.
I feel like more and more are exiting altcoins altogether, in favor or BTC or fiat.

BTC dominance has been on the up for a while now and the sentiment seem to be more and more positive everyday. 

I wonder if the altcoin market will suddenly crash to oblivion or will just slowly die... 
Do you think the price of bitcoin, since its been in existence, is more influenced by news or development?
hey guys, I wanna invest some more in bitcoin. What do you guys advise, invest now or wait until tommorow or later?
Can't wait until Robinhood allows Bitcoin trading. Then you can press the Start Over button on every dip. 
Japan and SK not even up yet. I thought with all the good news and no FUD as of late we will not see 1-2k dumps this quick. 
What is Asia gonna do???!!
Anyone know why LISK went down so much after their Rebranding?

Haha! that was sarcasm on my part regarding bitcoin. As Americans however- we’re fucked. 
Question: at what amount of cash or BTC does it make sense to daytrade? 50 USD worth of BTC at a 1% gain would net you 50 cents. Minus transaction fees. For example.

I don't have cash to invest right now, but I'm mining my way up. Was just wondering when to get into it.
I like making my own luck rather than HODL'ing and relying on others. And in the end, if I screw up and lose it all, then I've lost nothing but the electricity.

Is it too late to get rich with cryptos?
Shoutout to the bros/sisters that bought at 11.7 and didn’t sell cause they believe in the product/coin.  

TLDR did not sleep much these last 24 hours 

Edit 1: I sold my ETH at a $9 loss and used it to short BTC for a $9.50 profit. Only good trade I made all week.
Crypto market is only down 20% YTD (market cap weighted)... https://imgur.com/CL87vtI
There is no selling pressure. On GDAX, from 10,400 to 11,000 USD only 400 btc are on sell orders. Still why btc is falling!!! WTF
what's with all this selling?
[deleted]
Next stop 9.5k
[deleted]
Bitcoin is easy lol. I originally bought at 3500, then sold at 14000 (going down). I then rebought at 8000 and just sold at 10700. 

Now I'm waiting for it to go back down below 7000 (hopefully) so i can buy more.


For all you people saying "HODL" i just want to say: It's better to sell high and buy low. That way you *actually make a profit*. 
After studying the devastating effects that centralised currencies can have, like in Venezuela where the price of a coffee has risen by 718%, we decided to write a blog post studying alternative solutions. We concluded that cryptocurrencies can definitely help bring millions of people out of poverty. If you want to learn more: https://crypto101.org.uk/2018/02/20/banking-the-unbanked-how-digital-currencies-and-blockchain-technology-can-help-reduce-poverty/
EW analysis and trading psychology seem pretty relevant here. This crash happened at almost exactly 100% gain from the low of 6k. Perfect time to cash out, given the gigantic crash that just preceded this reversal, which has been on everyone's minds. It's the C leg
Back to Bear: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYisjFQP85E
Noob question: I want to take the approach of asking if I can pay in Bitcoin at every in-person transaction I do. But I also want to set up a Segwit wallet. Can a Segwit wallet do transactions with a legacy wallet normally?
Come on fuckers! Hold your fortune! Dont panic sell again and again
[deleted]
Is there any reason to panic?
I'm calling this bottom at $10,327.17
congraz to those who held during the nice 8k to 11k rally and made max profit. I didn't have the balls to hold for that long because I knew one day this day would come. Just didn't wanna get caught up in the shitstorm. 
Will it stay over 10k? I hope so... 
This is just sideways price action, like I said, because of the 50 DMA going below the 100 DMA.
The best thing about Bitcoin is that right now whatever price you buy at, it will go either up or down. I bought at a high of $11,729. It dropped to around $10,200. The major cause 0f these crashes is PANIC. That is the only reason it has such extreme dips. Plus GDAX should do a better job executing the trades to the penny. As all of you have seen, the trading board should not sit for 5-10 minutes. This fuels an explosion. Plus they are executing trades at higher and lower rates than what BTC is at. The good thing about panic selling is that it clears the way for the next high. I base my buying and selling on the order book zoomed out to $10. A good flat vertical sign on the buy or sell side is a very good indicator of when to buy and sell. I call these $5 or $10 vertical lines soldiers. Price  right now $10,835 and not enough green verticals to go higher. Yup now at $10,797. Hope this helps. A lot of sellers and buyers making huge mistakes without looking at this verticals. Remember not to invest more than you can lose. It looks like we may wake up tomorrow at 10.9 or 11K, Good luck everyone.  
Good old days of waking up in the morning just to see red everywhere.
Price is going to drop below 10k this week 
Bitcoin reached $12k the other day and you mean to tell me some of you didn't take your profits? I don't doubt that some of you were up 50-100%. 
I'm done with this cryptocurrency bullshit. Peace.
Afrika and south amerika r holding btc at 11k... with bananas and king kong.
Now Pull/sell out.... and buy at a low/dip
dont let these whale run away with our loot lets sell together with them and wait for 9,5k where they started pumpin...
Capitulation - We are no way near there yet, and I believe thats where we are headed before they stop the games
Tether or do you think we will bounce up soon? (inb4 downvotes because tether mention)

It was too good to be true for past  several days...
I'm a noob who bought in at about 7000, does anyone think it will drop that low?  Would I benefit from selling now and buying more with my profits later?

Most of you aren't very emotionally resilient when looking at price action. Personally, I'd only ever actually feel something if it went sub 4k.
Whales pumped a lot so they have all rights to dump now and take the profit.

Safe strat: be patient and buy when rsi is at 20 and sell when it's at 80. You will always come out positve
Always follow one rule in crypto: Never sell at loss. Sooner or later you will get a point where you will make profits. 
Bitcoin is on its way down to $7.5k and some of you are still holding on like it's a long lost relative. I may as well be in r/wallstreetbets.
Sell till you can and wait for a new dip!

I think its about time other crypto currencies break away from Bitcoin. Yes, it's the Genesis, but there are far better alternatives that are superior, IMO.

start buying!
So, price is dropping because of segwit implementation and therefore less profits on mining?
If BTC drops any further you will be able to find me in the kitchen pouring boiling hot kettle water into my eyes.
Goodbye gains.

Ok guys it starts looking as something more than just correction...
Godammit. Resistance *rejected.* Now some people are saying it's possible we could see $6k again!
