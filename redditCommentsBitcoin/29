BTC needs to stop tickling 9k's balls and do something
High Bitcoin ATM fees are the largest barrier to wider Bitcoin adoption. Most Bitcoin ATMs are selling bitcoins with a 20 to 30 percent fee. PBS did a segment the other day on Bitcoin and a reporter put 20 dollars into a Bitcoin-ATM and only got 13 dollars worth of Bitcoin. This is a PR nightmare in the making. We should not be defending this behavior with free market arguments we should be boycotting these ATM operators. Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APIyzN6f_Lg&feature=youtu.be&t=2093
These bears need to fuck off already. How many times are we going to play ping pong with 9k? Die motherfuckas
Another day of Bitcoin slipping her panties off, then putting them back on again.
perhaps this Bcash pump is going to flow into BTC.  whoever is pumping it is using it as a way to get money into crypto without making BTC sky rocket but eventually it will flip over.  Or there is some insider info going on and the 32MB block increase is popular?  Outside of Traders who are just looking for make a quick buck, I've never talked to anybody who is pro-bcash.  Sorry to even bring this up here - just looking for opinions
We are one small pump away from getting out of this bear market, needs to hit 9300

This 9k$ resistance is ridiculous. 
Big battle taking place right now!
9k is the real resistance test
Reminder: we hit 'bottom' back on Feb 5th which was nearly 3 months ago. Onward and Upward! 
I'm back home from work. 

As far as I'm concerned, the bull run can start now, so I'll have some evening entertainment...
well looks like bitcoin broke 9k lol
Wow we’re flying now.  Maybe 10k by weekend?   This is the bitcoin I like to remember 
I am the first one :-) 
Looks like btc is taking a deep breath before the next attempt to break through 9k...

C'monnnnnn bull run!
Bear market seems to be dead. Gotta love it!
Yes! We did it ladies and gentlemen!
its happening lol
It's 2am here, let me sleep!  
<pours coffee>
IST OVA NEIN THOUSAND!!! Schnell!!!
Good morning!
**Support The Bulls.**
Please let me wake up to 9.2k 
I think thus slow increase is beter than the mad rush of December. Less excitement but more sustainable in the long run. You know, dicks being safe and all that, even at this slower rate
Good morning, New York.
Hi, I’m relatively new to crypto and had a question directed to the bitcoin community and would like to hear others’ thoughts. 

If Bitcoin prices were to moon (astronomically), do you think alts in general would moon with it? Or do you believe that Bitcoin might stand alone at the top and all of our trading and hodling should be directed towards getting more BTC? I feel like the only time I get more BTC is to trade into alts although I know I should add more to my profile. Thanks for your opinions in advance. I’d like to hear from this community!
That tease @ 830am EST
Sideways trading folks. This is a Salamander market
(Don’t they walk sideways)
Its been an interesting weekend, wasent expecting such resistance for 9k but i was surprised that we didnt have massive dips after each test
What a battle! I think we will see 9.1k within the next 24 hours. 
is bitcoin wallet same address can be useful for many time transaction please help me .....
Wallet... where do you keep your coins... always on exchanges or got a private key wallet.. im kind of new at btc.. so let me hear what wallets you use...
Hi!

I've been following r/coinbase for a while now, and there seems to be a lot of issues with them by users. I currently have Coinbase but have not encountered any issues.

I'd like to buy a bitcoin or two at this time (which I'll need to do in increments), but now I'm debating if Coinbase is the right platform for purchasing? Is there an objectively "good" platform for purchasing Bitcoin?

**Come On Bulls, don't throw this away!** 
another underwhelming day, we’re getting there though 
Asia contingent about to get going. About to get that 9k, but then right back down to 8950.

I may throw some bones at Bcash for this pump about to start
Bears need to pull their sells right now, selling too cheap
Another battering ram to 9k
here we goo
damnnnnn
I was getting worried for a minute, Here we go boys
Be prepared for a slight pullback guys. dont panic
I could get used to this.

My "break even" is at 9900. This will be a big moment for me.
I got into crypto so I could buy a sweet car. Now that I have enough I can't get myself to pull the trigger for fear of what my portfolio might be worth in 5 years. I struggle trying to decide. 
l0l why are ppl buying bcash? A hard fork will still makes it trash.
today is the dayy 
Suddenly less ass holes saying "I'll see you guys when it hits 2k"
[deleted]
5.40am West Coast time, I think we need to wait until it's around 9am there for us to get through $9k.

hole in the ichimoku cloud right now

break through please
How do I open a channel for eclair mainnet app? I want to buy something from Blockstream
We see some high spread spikes on GDAX for most currencies today. Coupled with quite high volumes that is a sign of heavy live/day trading. Had some success/luck at it today with a nice +3%. However it looks like Vegeta is going away so I will stay on the side until market tension is resolved. Easy to get burned in these situations.
Just moved my stop sell up by $400... Nice.
Just out of interest, what are people setting their stop loss at?
What was ATL bitcoin dominance? Is it now? 
... and we are back in the "comfort zone".
Let’s actually friggin go bois



Also why is this unstickied
This climb up again from 8.90k to 9.18k from 5 min chart,  In 1 min chart I think this is by wave.
Good morning Asia:)
We moon now?
Where are you all today?  Nice work folks while I was asleep.  Cheers. 
**Bitcoin Price Climbs to 40-Day High Above $9,200**

https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-climbs-40-day-high-9200/

Bitcoin's price climbed above $9,200 on Tuesday to hit a 40-day high, according to data from CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).

Following a steady increase over the past week, the price of world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization jumped above $9,000 soon after the morning trading session began around 00:30 UTC, after which it continued to climb up to as high as $9,220.97 at around 2:00 UTC.

The price is at its highest point since March 14, when bitcoin dropped $800 within one trading day to reach a one-month low around $8,000. Following the plunge, the cryptocurrency's price declined to as low as $6,593 on March 30, reflecting what is now a 39% gain since that market bottom.
What time is the pump happening?
**Come On Bulls.**
**Show us you mean business Bulls and we will follow.**

Not really expecting a lot right now. Last Friday was my first paycheck after Tax day and I went all in, as did many others in the US. I expect some selling off until the next pay day Friday.

Japan and Korea ain’t shite they won’t be driving this price up anytime soon this afternoons

Heading down to 8825 for everybody who still wants to get in to jump in.

**Could be THE ASIA PUSH!**
Volume is picking up...
I'm hoping that when the American markets get going properly today that volume will increase markedly and we finally get over $9k and stay over.
