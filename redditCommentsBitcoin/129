Daily Discussion, January 18, 2018
We should talk about the correlation between the end of futures contracts and the dip and immediate rebound of bitcoin‚Äôs price. If these people intentionally caused a dip to short their first contracts and buy in low on their new contracts, then they are responsible for ordinary people losing millions of dollars.

I coded an Android BTC widget app (that doesn't suck). Started out as a personal hack, but it might come in good use to someone else here: It shows the daily/weekly rate change, current rate, and optionally your investments if you add them. There are no ads or anything, would be cool if someone likes it: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.paramsen.bitcointools

It's better than many of the other widget tickers imho. Try it out and give some feedback. 

^It ^would ^^also ^^be ^^cool ^^^to ^^^get ^^^reviews ^^^^from ^^^^others ^^^^than ^^^^^my ^^^^^mom
The head of the CME said "We will tame Bitcoin" what he meant is "We will manipulate the price to make money"
Finally in the green after 27 hours of hodling 

never sell
Mr Whalebachev, tear down this wall!
Prepare the 12k memes

Edit: fuck spoke too soon
I just bought 2 BTC lol you‚Äôre welcome gui$$$
Even more bullish prediction by someone from Wall Street. Good news for BTC and some positive technical predictions in this article.

https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/18/fundstrats-tom-lee-is-even-more-bullish-after-crash.html

Reaching 25K by end 2018 he predicts.

people who are waiting for 8K = Who didn't get to grab it when it went 9k
Im new and i have a question.  Why is id verification, state, ssn, bank account information necessary to purchase coin? Isn't the idea behind cryptocurrency that its supposed to be anonymous and cant be regulated or tracked? 

It defeats the purpose of cryptocurrency if all the exachanges follow regulations its just regular currency at that point.
It would be cool to say you were one of the first to    be on the lightning network.... 
what kind of nerd places a sell wall at 11,730
What's with the increasing number of BCH shills and tipper bots recently? can we ban those?
The weak have been purged and now the market is filled with believers again. As we all know, the tech needs time to mature. We need to be unified in giving it the time to mature (SegWit adoption, Lightning Network, etc).  Remember this lesson Noobs: crypto has wild price fluctuations as institutional money attempts to manipulate and destroy our marketplace. Don‚Äôt let them bully you into selling! Wall Street has deep, deep pockets and they are not truly afraid of crypto yet. They will lose 5% of holdings just to murder BTC and all the cryptos.

Remember:  ‚ÄúFirst they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.‚Äù

Greed makes us lose sight of the cause. I started HODLing because of a belief in the people and decentralized asset control. Bitcoin is not at that ideal and probably never will be - but it is better than the corruption and institutionalized, organized, and legal manipulation that has plagued our systems for a long time - even well before the 2008 crash.

This is our chance to get back some of our own control and power over our own economic futures.  Don‚Äôt let them divide you. Be happy for ANY crypto that does well.
So, I was [coding](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinTechnology/comments/7qkw04/so_im_trying_to_parse_the_blk00000dat_running/) a bitcoin blockchain .dat file parser in C++ and learnt so many things. Now I finally understand all bytes in a transaction and a block. Next step would be to code private key to pubkey in C++ and then signing and finally I can create my own transaction and broadcast it to the world. It just makes me feel happy that's all. Just wanted to tell everyone that it isn't difficult at all.
So do you all agree that next time when the price increase like last month, you should sell part of your coin to secure profit?
I'm waiting the time when coinmarketcap changes to this:

Suggestion: Can we get something like a **Development update** post regularly posted and stickied in this forum? It would really help a lot to know what's going on, what news is happening.

I'm subbed to the bitcoin digest but it's not exactly easy to go through and there's a lot of emails there.

Some dev communication from a summary news source would be great.
**Please be careful of the [dead cat bounce](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deadcatbounce.asp).** This may appear to be a recovery, but note the two different pictures being painted on GDAX by simply changing the candle interval from 15 minutes to 1 day:

So, it's just broken the 12k sell wall and is fluctuating for now. Is this a bull trap?  Or did that already happen?
Please ELI5 to me what is tether USDT. thx
I bought my last batch of bitcoin at 14500.  Since I bought a lot earlier, I'm still above water but I'm so mad I didn't wait.
Is there a time where the whales did not report liquidating a long position? They seem do it very often.
Man...this is a bouncy ball! Sold at 19 on 19th December, bought at 9.6 yesterday...right now we're at 11.9! What's not to like!
Oh it dropped a few hundred..Oh it's going to crash to 8k. The mentality of weak hands

This thread is getting saturated with FUDers. This is getting quite annoying. Additionally, there are all sorts of theories floating around about price manipulation. People, you need to understand, everything as unregulated as this will have manipulators taking advantage. If you could manipulate the price, you would too. Regulations etc. are good for BTC in the long run. Also, bitcoin is by far the most distributed among all the cryptos. People are holding small fractions of it all over the world. It is the most difficult crypto to manipulate. As for the price, think of it: If you were a new investor looking to get into the market, would you be willing to do it now? Would you not rather wait? 

I am waiting for more countries to ban ICOs and all the shitcoins. There are those that have such low volume of transactions, that two people can transact amongst themselves and raise the price by 500%. Those need to go. Have faith in BTC. 

Yea I think recovery 
How long does it take for coinbase to process a transaction? My status is still pending after buying on the 15th; is this normal?
Sold the dip, it going to the mooooon...
Wall is coming down
sell walls are insane on gdax @ 12k almost 300 lol
So I'm kind of ignorant, but, does the lightning network require a new coin like segwit2x?  Or is it not a fork at all, just a different program in additional to the bitcoin program?
Has Coinbase stopped verification altogether or am I just having bad luck?

Waiting a week and a half for a single transaction is really inconvenient if I'm trying to get a hold of ICO's or Altcoins. 
Is there an update on conbase getting their shit together?

Quite the sudden drop, any theories?  All the news I can find from the previous hour is good.  

Speaking of which, what's the best place for up-to-the-minute BTC news?

Guys, How secure is having avast antivirus on your computer when you are having few bitcoins in desktop wallet for daily use?
not a lot of people trading on the gdax right now.  the trade history is so slow you can actually read what it says!  

I think everyone is a little tired/gunshy right now.  Give it a few days and watch things heat back up after people have had a break (myself included)
I've never sseen that beautiful green positive stick. WOW. JUST WOW. TO THE MOON!!!
Just convinced my mom to invest 15k in bitcoin lol, we need people like her to drive the price up so we can dump and make that major profit.

Moon Tower, baby! Kegs are on the way. Everybody's gonna be there!
god dammit... looks like i missed the absolute bottom waiting for fiat to be deposited.  just buy in now or wait and see if it drops a bit again?
Bittrex still isn‚Äôt accepting new registrations. Any recommendations for other Bitcoin day trading sites?

A lot of fakeouts happening üòè
what % of my portfolio should bitcoin be? Right now I have 8% bitcoin, 60% big cap and like 32% small cap. I hear you should have 50/25/25 or something like that but I just love my alt coins so much, it is hard to do that for me and I feel like they can grow so much more than bitcoin...thoughts?
Why on livecoin.net people buying BTC at 13k+ ( Full buy wall of 13k+)
So I made a mistake when sending some bitcoin. When setting a custom fee on the blockchain wallet I accidentally set the fee too low at 82 sats/byte. The transaction has no confirmations after 6 days. Is there any way I can speed this transaction up or is it basically stuck?  
Fake buy & sell walls WTF
This reminds me of the drop a few weeks ago, a few days before Christmas. Once the price had recovered, it kept going up and down, up and down...

Hope soon we get the final word on the S. Korea exchange ban
There's no reason we should sell in low now. it's just correcting by itself 
Why can't it seem to push above 12k? When it's near it dips back to like 11500 again.
Alright time to put our money where our mouths are. All you millions of GDAX customers, trade that damn BCH for beautiful BTC while that damn stupid shitcoin is still worth diddly squat. Who's with me on this one....Kill that f@#$cking coin.

Bought .2btc in early December at about 13k. Couldn't hodl anymore when it dropped to 9 was feeling sick watching myself lose hundreds even though I believed it wud go higher over time. Decided to bite bullet and sell. Knew it was a mistake to sell once I pressed sell but alas I sold. Lost 600$ looking to buy back to try and cover loses. Any ideas on wen I should buy and how much.
Prepare the seventh rocket boi$$$$$
@bitcoin still hasnt been shutdown yet.

And google has it on top 3 results. Even before bitcoin.org

Makes me think twitter and google are complicit.   Roger paid twitter and paid for some google SEO.  

Shit is fucked up.
Dead üê± bounce or recovery?
Seems to be linked to mainstream news these days. If it's all fear stories then we'll slide again. If quiet, then might continue to creep up.
XVG just saved my ass. Loving this.
Pour one out for me - I sold when it was low
So what, this is just wallstreets game now with this futures bs and bitcoin will never go back up past 20K because of the rich elite??
Can we sort this thread default by Top or Best?

New just encourages people to spam FUD 
Anyone who can't see the blatant Coinbase/B C H manipulation is a dumb f***. The game is rigged folks
We will hit 13k today
I'm a bit nervous about the crashand the chances of recovery. 
What's more, I'm worried for the small projects like teachmeplease or similar that I support. Will the situation affect them?

I hope that you can now learn that always the same movement, big dump... big pump, its a strong market with big profits long term.
Remember .. always HOLD and be patience.
You can sell on top and buy on floor, but its too dificult for noobs found the target, and there are diferences between price to buy and sell, its more easy just HOLD !!!!
I wonder when the decision will be made about legality 
so i think i understand multi sig..can someone explain basics of schnorr tho

Bitcoin Tax! Say I live in the UK and sell Bitcoin for Euros (not Sterling Pounds). Do I have to pay tax on that?

What is the fastest exchange to sell Bitcoins?(not coinbase)
Is the easiest/fastest way to move from crypto -> fiat through coinbase?
It's still my first year with crypto. Just wondering whether the veterans of you can tell what made Bitcoin recover yesterday.

Apparently, it initially fell due to FUD because of those regulation announcements. So my expectation was that we need something concrete to happen to make it rise again (some announcement or event).
All charts show that those drops apparently happen every January. Therefore, my question is: What made Bitcoin recover in the recent years? Was there a concrete trigger or did it just kind of happen?

Would be really helpful to get a feeling for "is the worst over?" or "what needs to happen to end it?".

Thanks! 
I made a transaction using mycelium (https://blockchain.info/tx/a6df9a5a253650570803790cda617d29426297070e3b2a959188451890de9253).

I selected a low priority fee, and the transaction confirmed fairly quickly.

The thing that I'm confused about is the 0.0002851 BTC left in the wallet.

I learned that this arose because I changed the fee after setting the output to maximum (ie I should have gone back to the transaction amount and selected 'maximum' again once the correct fees were known).

The thing is that I didn't think that this was possible as I thought that full outputs needed to be spent and that any 'change' would be lost as a change address linked to the paper wallet can't be generated. However, this points to either a partial spend or change going back to the original legacy paper wallet.

Can anyone explain *why* this happened?
Awesome, thank you! 
i am really going crazy right now !! i bought it at 19300usd and i am still holding it !! when will i see some profit??? i am waiting its been a long time !! HELP ME!! 
I'm out guys. It was a fun ride. I just can't handle these dips and I don't see this correction ending soon. May the force be with you. 
Maybe we will need to be more patience in next weeks, I think in March we will see strong green lights on chart and big profits.

I read that bitcoin can only do 7 transaction per second.  How many more will it be able to do with Segwit and Schnorr and other ideas?  Do you think once we have Lightning Network working, that 7 tx/s will be enough? Or will we some day need to increase block size?
Warning: The following is based on nothing more than a hunch.

We are done moving much and will settle in between 10k and 12k for the next couple months as the dust settles in Asia. I realize that's a big swing, but I think we'll see it stay closer to 12 than 10 for the majority of time.
would it be a good invest to move actually ETH -> BTC ?
Hello Everyone,
I am new to this site and wanted to know how does someone go about posting a business that now accepts cryptocurrency payments for design services? I just want to be sure to not post and violate any rules. Thank you for any help.
Price going downnnnnn
I don't buy all these claims that "it's a correction and the price will go up".  There is nothing to substantiate that.  Facts - (1) it has not recovered from it's Nov/Dec ATH and has been on the decline since then and (2) each "correction" took it down 20%.  
Next "correction" will either take down to $8,500 or much further down if panic sets in.
It‚Äôs going to keep doing this guys. Drop, drop and then rise a bit (fake recovery) and then drop even lower. Be patient before putting any more in, the ‚Äòdip‚Äô is far from over.
From a technical perspective, this is one ugly chart.  Anyone who is thinking of buying again better do so with limited amounts of $$ and plan to average in as it goes down/up.

https://imgur.com/a/slt36
Do you guys think the recover will be today, or tomorrow? 
I reckon it'll drop if it ever hits $12.2k. In 2013/2014 after it's drop following the high, it retraced 84.7% of it's value (we saw that in the last couple weeks when it hit $17k again) before falling. The next high in 2014 was at 61.2% of the ATH, for the current ATH that high will be just below $12.2k.

Edit: Just as a prediction, final low will hover around $4.4k with the lowest being at around $2.7k, that is if history repeats itself.

Is bitcoin value only high right now since only a few people have access to the said cryptocurrency?

How long will it go up for? I'm kinda sketchy buying right now seeing the graph of the last few days
Just got another $30 worth of BTC, now I'm trying to figure out how to use the excess balance on this visa prepaid card (between $5-10) to pick up another little bit so I can actually use the balance for something that's not sitting around in a card forever.

You have to be a complete fool to believe that bitcoin will be up now. People bought at the bottom, and now merge with a small profit, what kind of growth can be!
Is it plausible, optimistic I already know but here goes...

Trump, baffoon that he is has a head for business or so they say. Might put the thumbdrive with silk road booty into knox and quietly accumilate bear share or 51% hopefully. then declaere that bitcoin is the bees knees?

Crazy? lor plausible


Isn't it obvious what's happening? In a five year perspective, using a logarithmic scale, BTC has always sloped upward until a breaking point, then sloped downward for a few months, sometimes more, before sloping upward again. The two last breaking points were April and December in 2013. I believe we are there again now,  and the trend will be down but tending to slope upward, the turning point probably from two to six months away.
