Daily Discussion, March 23, 2018
Most of the ALTs are tightly linked to the big daddy's movement (Bitcoin). 

What is the point to TA the smaller coins if they will more or less take the same swings as BTC?

Conclusions (happy to be corrected)

1) Market of ALTS is highly dependent on computer trading while the volumes are low like nowadays. It is difficult to fight with bots on ALGOs.

2) BTC chart is the key and that is mostly run by the bots as well. The only ray of hope is NEW PEOPLE, NEW MONEY and increase in interest in BTC which will supress the bot trading.

3) You will mostly lose against the bots in bear markets.

Happy bitcoining.... (good and constructive criticism welcome)
by the time we've "confirmed" that bitcoin has reversed, bitcoin will already be up 80%. ignore these buffoons, either buy because you think it will go up or sell because you think it will go down. don't get the worst of both worlds.
Guess what Mr Buffett said as golden words...

(((Only buy something that you'd be perfectly happy to hold if the market shut down for 10 years.)))

His best investments are those which he bought for cheap, the companies did well and he held for long time generating compound interests.

There is no rocket science here guys. If we believe in bitcoin and distributed ledger, just hold and don't panic with these rides. These only add to the fun.

If you are in a hurry to get some profits, I stress, LEARN trading. LEARN / Study and Master the trading. Only then get into it otherwise you are fighting against bots and your chances are slim.

For rest of us, happy HODLING... (take profits occasionally though ;) ) 

Lets get to $9k folks and keep it going for a few weeks or months.  We have had decent news recently, nothing really bad at all.  LN is taking shape slowly and the future is bright.
If you guys see the troll(s) on here please report. It’s terrible to see this sub decend to nonsense.

Thanks for the company guy's . I really believe in Satoshi white paper and the cypher punks
Just so people know, goldbergger is the forum troll, otherwise known as turdbergger. 
Looks like the moderators banned him (goldbergger) or maybe he just deleted a lot of his recent posts. 
It’s friday, so today I can cheat on my diet....
I guess I’ll try a Whale burger, no mustard , extra ketchup... 
We just broke through 8700. That is a very important marker. I might even get optimistic...
Apparently we're not the first community goldbergger has devoted his time to trolling: https://www.reddit.com/r/vergecurrency/comments/7m7umt/dont_listen_to_goldbergger/

10K by Monday, enjoy the weekend guys. Buy some beers with BTC 
These daily discussion threads should be renamed to 'here's my guess on what the price will do today' threads.  

**Very well played Malta!**
falling wedge blah blah don't buy now blah blah bitcoin to 7k blah blah LOL IT JUST JUMPED $250. friendly reminder you can't predict bitcoin
You folks get very excited over $200 increases or decreases which makes me think you are very new to this market.
I have a feeling we are in for a good weekend.
Is bull season starting?
So I am getting ready to buy my first sizable amount of bitcoin.  It has been a big decision and a lot of hard work to get the capital, but I'm ready to put it in.  How does one go about finding a good entry price to start the purchasing process??  I've seen people talking about dropping down to around 6k and others blowing up to 12k.  I don't know charts and really am on the fence about buying now or waiting...
All in on BTC?
Good Morning from Europe, this fine Saturday morning...

Anyone who agrees that we have started the wave 3 of Elliot wave and our next target should be 11.5K ? (stiff resistance at 9K to break)

Or perhaps a correction to 7.8K then up for 11.5K to complete wave 3?

Honored, sir!  Part of my original quote to Bloomberg that was left out of the article.  "Malta is very progressive when it comes to crypto and fintech. We think it is a good place for other crypto businesses to look into as well." https://twitter.com/JosephMuscat_JM/status/977115588614086656 …
Well this is a shitty way to start the day!
It sounds counterintuitive but if NAFTA gets signed, investors may come back to more *speculative* markets such as cryptos. 
Early April is when we'll have a clear indication of if the bears or bulls will win out. We're still stuck in this wedge. The price movement the past few weeks means nothing to me other than to confirm that it's 50/50. I have money on the sidelines if we break to the downside to cost average and I have scalping and reallocation strategies if we break to the upside. Just be prepared and have a plan and you'll make money regardless in the long run unless we drop to 0 which I give a 2% chance.... I like my odds.
Yahoo is relevant again?

I am sick of watching these whales screw with the market.

Guys, I'm sorry if this doesn't belong here. If not, please redirect me. I've been reading and doubting to make a move for a while. I have a few USD that I could invest in BTC. Should I do it now? Just buy and hold? Where should I buy?
EDIT: Thank you all for the answers.
lol what's up with bitcoin doing 180 degree turns lately
which one of you randomly put 40 BTC at 7006 on GDAX BTCEUR? this makes no sense
At last, we got out of this damn three-days downtrend channel. Hopefully we're safe enough to face the weekend.

Go baby, go!
got some doll hairs. do i buy now or wait for the potential weekend dip? i'm thinking wait. 
I've asked before and I don't think anyone heard me. Can we turn bitcoin off for about 30 seconds and then turn it back on again?
Good morning. Did I miss something?
We gonna have a rally in the next hours
bots can manipulate crypto markets by artificially inflating the price. Their automated trading behavior leads new traders in cryptomarkets to overpay for the coins they are buying. The classic “pump-and-dump” scheme that was popular in the early nineties and made famous by the Wolf of Wall Street Jordan Belfort is still being run effectively — by bots — in today’s crypto markets. This scheme involves coordinated purchases of low-priced coin to “pump” the price and attract new investors who are easily excited by the increase. As investors unknowingly buy “the pump”, bots dump the asset in near perfect coordination. With no new buyers coming into the market, the coin quickly loses value and investors are left scratching their heads — and agonizing over their wallets.

Unfortunately, this scenario plays out all too often in cryptocurrency markets. As Business Insider has reported, there is no shortage of coordinated schemes where a group of traders use bots to simultaneously purchase coins to drive up price. Investors hear about the coin, get caught up in the euphoria, and buy in, hoping to make a quick profit. What they are left with is anything but.

With more and more “retail” investors joining the crypto space in recent weeks, chasing the Bitcoin boom, it’s likely even more people will be susceptible to pump-and-dump strategies.


How to spot a bot
It can be extremely hard to detect where bots are at work without advanced analysis tools. They’re easier to spot in hindsight.
Cryptocurrency markets are here to stay, and it’s likely the bots are as well — as long as the market remains unregulated. There is already a large volume of trading bots operating in the market that the vast majority of investors aren’t aware of. As investors become more savvy, so too will the bots. And so we’re likely headed down the path of an arms race. As detection tools get stronger, developers will look for ways around detection. As bots get more advanced, platforms will accelerate research and development to counterattack. With regulation seemingly right around the corner, only time will tell which side will win the fight until the government steps in to stabilize the market and put an end to predatory bots.

Do you guys use terms like whale, pump, dump, crash, moon, and HODL in real life conversations 
CryptoChainBank.com and ReactionCrypto.com have been put up for sale on godaddy.com auctions.  These domain names could turn into big advertising/wallet sites.  I noticed that a bunch of crypto domain names are selling for quite a premium.
We are going to push hard thru 10k very soon.
who is up and who is down?
Im up :) 
its almost weekend pump time daddy
Even if you fart loudly in public it may trigger FUD these days. I lost the sense of which one is a good news for crypto and which one is bad. 
Currently only 7% of Binance trading volume are from Japanese customers hence lets take in context.

This news should make the market go up, all exchanges should move to countries that are more relaxed like Malta.

Is it drop o' clock already? Time flies.
Random public opinion question, what exchange do you use and why? What features make it a good exchange?

I use Hitbtc because I bot trade and the maker fee rebate and websocket trading API works well enough. There's a lot to be desired in terms of execution speed and reliability though...
Nothing will change until these bots are out of the way. None of us can constantly compete with the money and tech.  Nonetheless, I will continue because I believe in the concept and its future.

I think he path is paved now back to 9k.

Can you feel it?
Rising nicely just in time for the weekend dump. Love this market.
lots of people will sell their profits made from this pump before the weekend, hopefully we stay at 8.5k range till monday. 
Price is pumping, stop moaning about whales.  

Where's the evidence?

Day traders constantly moan when the price goes up.

Doh!
For those who don't know why Bitcoin is pumping, here is the huge news that came out. Yahoo is opening a crypto exchange. Imagine how many new investors this corporation with a known name will attract. https://www.coindesk.com/yahoo-japan-launch-cryptocurrency-exchange-2018-says-report/

Pump or dump? Which one is next? Place your bets here.
Nice pump. Time for dump.

I think we might need another violent shakeout before we can *really* rise again. Fasten your seatbelts.

My personal target right now is around $6900, which corresponds with the EMA 400 on the daily chart. We'll see...
looks like we are heading to 9k today. Cant believe I sold out to the deathcross talk so soon. 
guess market cannot decide whether the binance thing is good or bad 
Yahoo are launching an exchange and BTC is at $8.5... get em while they're cheap!
Trader here. 

Got burned BAD with that spike this morning. If you knew what that cost me you might vomit 😋

Drop in the bucket and still way up but still stings.

No point to this other than to vent.

Everyone talks about how USD is backed by nothing but faith. But what is Bitcoin backed of then? Newbie asking

The exchanges does not hide that they manipulate the price, while everyone is looking for whales. all manipulations come from insider trading on the largest exchanges.

Can we go one day without fud?
I'm just happy to see the market reacting to external events again, instead of arbitrary pumps and dumps.
Last Sunday Bitcoin fell to $7400 and I don't recall their being any major bad news. Now that the price is slowly descending what's the realistic lowest it might fall to this weekend?

[Quick Poll] A quick survey to see how much investment do we have in BTC, for readers of this subreddit.

I will give my response after first response by someone else (if we get it). 

Choose 1 of the following as of today:

A) Zero investment in BTC
B) Less than $300 invested in BTC
C) Between $300 to $1000 invested in BTC
D) Between $1000 to $3000 invested in BTC
E) Over $3000 invested in BTC

There is no hidden agenda here, it will be good to gauge the profile of the readers here around BTC. There is no shame if you fall in category A or E, it is all relative.

Let's see how many can be bold and open?

BTC is over. It is only a matter of time before we are back in the hundreds. I'd say by the end of April,  sub $1000 will be a reality. All these 'positive' news stories have done absolutely nothing but bring the price down. Maybe by 2020 there will be a chance of breaking $10k. But, with all the financial turmoil and FUD, there is no way this sustains above $1000 for much longer.
