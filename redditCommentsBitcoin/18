Get the green dick paint out.

Today I bought a burrito and a coffee using BTC in New York City - WINNING!
the FOMO engine is gaining steam
Robinhood trading just went live in my State. I believe it went live for a few other states as well. 
next resistance level is at $9,800 for those asking and wondering.
Holy FOMO
*jst wants it to hit 10k to fuck that never again 10k guy*

Alright profit takers take your sell orders off and let the price climb, take your profit around like 12k so we can have the FOMO kick in to counter the sells and stabilize there for a little bit 
9,5K yo yo yo go go go :D
Me at work *Hit 10k, Hit 10k, Hit 10k*

Good day all. 
**Hey guys - come over here** - you're missing it..  :)
This is it. Resistance broken. Better sell all my alts to bitcoin now. 
**Keep going Bulls!**
Excuse me? Which direction is the FOMO-Train?
Already reasonably positioned pondering whether to FOMO in with some additional funds at my disposal
I like May.

/e: moving uncorrelated with the stock market btw.
is bitcoin gender neutral?
what is up with these sellers. 
Can you please not sell for a moment and just hold?
Hi everybody! 
Quick question - how do I open an account for my son?  It would be linked to my bank account.  His 11th birthday is today and I want to set something up so he can follow.
[So far, going as predicted, hope y'all didn't miss out](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8gg8oi/comment/dybxq4i)
We have past the low resistance point for too long now, and the support is getting stronger each day above 8K, and soon above 9K. We're at the point of no return. 

This means we'll never see prices below $8K for a very long time, if ever. 
Prepare 9,7K sooo soon \^\^

Edit: DONE :D
get ready for FOMO.. my bitcoin podcast downloads just doubled today
Bull market is on. I want to see 10k$ this weekend 
Lol compare the comments from yesterday's thread and today's thread ahahah
**Keep going Bulls.**
**Sell In May and Go Away? Not for Bitcoin Bulls**

https://www.coindesk.com/sell-in-may-and-go-away-not-for-bitcoins-bulls/

Sell in May and go away? While the month may traditionally give equity bulls cold feet, it should probably not be a cause of worry for the bitcoin market.

Indeed, it's true the month of May is often a weak period for equities, and that bitcoin has acted as a risk asset (moving in tandem with equities) since February. As such, cryptocurrency investors may fear that a potential drop in equities could end up dragging bitcoin prices lower.

However, historical data suggests that bitcoin is more likely to build upon its April rally this month.

Notably, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has scored gains in the month of May in five out of the last seven years, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.

View

BTC tends to perform well in May, thus an upside breakout of the narrowing price range is more likely and could yield a quick move higher to $10,000.

On the other hand, a downside break would open the doors to $8,490 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from $6,425 to $9,767.4).

Only a daily close (as per UTC) below $7,823 (April 17 low) would signal a bear revival.
Im so glad we're having slower but healthier growth this time around

Just broke even. Feels fucking good man. Time to buy more.  
Seen a guy running around town today giving away bitcoin flyers and he had like 5 people standing next to him asking him out.
â‚¬8k! What a day!
Asia wonâ€™t have anything on the USA come 12 hours from now. Itâ€™s the second pay day since Tax day. But also, itâ€™s the â€˜first of the monthâ€™ Friday.

Bitcoin will hit 10k+easily by 9am
Hungarian Hold when?
pumpy wumpy
Took me a while to find this daily. Not sure why isnt this pinned. 
why does bcash pump before bitcoin?
What's next resistance level TA chappies?  I don't fucking know.  Advise please.  :)
FOMO in or wait for a dip??
I've just been described as a crypto-anarchist...and it didn't bother me. 
What is happening? This is crazy! Please don't stop!
well. that escalated quickly
$10k EOW
I wonder if this is because stocks are doing poorly. It would be interesting if bitcoin started to move opposite to stocks.
We just got back into the old uptrend! To be honest: I thought, that this would be impossible!

Even if we drop out of it again, this is quite incredible!

https://i.imgur.com/ZT6UWUV.png
10k by this weekend or next week
I wonder: Do banks FOMO?
there might be another rally upward, we just have to wait and see what ASIA decides to do.
Iâ€™ve been holding my breath all day waiting for a drop but it seems I can let it go for now 
Ok lol. Hold on now. Just chill out 
Someone trying again?...
Looks like tax returns are in, huh?
Today looks like it's going to be explosive...big bars coming. 

Hope we all loaded up. 
Some early morning technical analysis coming at ya LIVE [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4Rqg6thBfw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4Rqg6thBfw)
Today is gonna be the day when I break even. Only 1,5% to go. ðŸ˜Š
Likely never seeing btc under 9k ever again. We'll be saying that about 10k soon
Itâ€™s happeninggggggggg. Omg, Iâ€™m about to come
**Support The Bulls as much as you can.  Many thanks.**
Hope we can get past 10k soon
We're in an ascending triangle right now. It might take some time before breakout, but this is a very bullish pattern. ðŸ˜€

Have a friend who wants to buy in today, you guys think it's a good idea? ðŸ¤”
I believe the binance nano pump started it all this time...


This is gentlemen 
Is bitcoin mining the same as quantitative easing?
I watched a brief youtube video the other day, and it claimed that if bitcoin became a true global currency, the bitcoin mining network would required over 100% of all the worlds electricity. 


Is that BS, or a problem still to be solved? 

Edit:  I mean 'over 100% of today's global electricity supply'.  Obviously it's not possible to use more than 100% of the worlds electricity.
G'day.  Did I miss anything?
can someone help me better understand utxo's? i read yesterday that bitcoin has 4 million utxos..how do we know this and what does that exactly mean
Sup guys.
To the Mars!
Its been sitting at 9599.99 for the last few minutes. It just does not want to touch 9.6k
Hello â‚¬8k!
Is this movement partly in reaponse to the goldman sachs news? Or has that been out for a while I only read about it yesterday. 
Some heavy resistance at the moment on GDAX.
Anyone got a video link to the Bitcoin question on Jeopardy? I can't find it on YT
Over on BitcoinMarkets someone suggested the possibility that maybe alt profits going to fiat via bitcoin may be a part of the current picture. Wondering what you guys might think? &, is this kind of coupling/trading ultimately part of the Bitcoin vision?
Quick question: I'm wondering about safety in the situation below.

I recorded a little screencap clip of me buying stickers from Blockstream with lightning. I was thinking of sharing it.

In the clip the lightning "invoice" is fully visible, and in my eclair wallet the txids for opening my channel are partly visible.

Is there enough information in the lightning "invoice" for me to doxx myself if I posted the clip? What about the channel transactions? 

Sorry for the newb question! Many thanks I advance.
let's smash 10k shall we.
Forza Bitcone!
Good afternoon from india
BTC price in Bitfinex is almost $80 higher than in Coinbase. Can anyone explain to me why this is so? 
How would you describe bitcoin mining in one sentence?
I wonder what Professor Bitcorn is doing on this fine day
Does anyone know the exact meeting date of the G20 June-July summary? 
I have some already but I want to buy more
I think I will FOMO if it hits 10k
MOON
Question:  If we get 5G internet rolled out across the world in a few years, which gives us Gigabit per second speeds over the airwaves, would that make big blocks less of a threat to decentralisation?
C'mon Asia...  Don't fuck this up for us!
BTC stuck with 5 confirmations and 2 hrs so far from the last conf. what is going on? any idea?
**Support The Bulls.**
Bitcoin is going to shoot up like  a civil rights hose. Damn!
