This sub goes full retard everytime btc crashes.
My 7 hard-earned tips for newbies in the crypto space (from 3 months of experience)

1) resist FOMO and only buy at the crash - even if it means you have to wait for weeks (what goes up must come down so wait patiently)

2) the small cap coins with small price tag have bigger risk but bigger multiplier as well. If you want stability and low risk, go for top 5 inc. Bitcoin, if you want multipliers and big rewards, go and hunt for good $0.001 and $0.01 coins (be careful though as they carry bigger risk)

3) Don't just HODL - do take some profits when you can. HODL what you truly believe in. A bit of TA and swing analysis don't hurt. Mix the two together and diversify your investment strategy.

4) Euphoria and all-time-highs are not to sit and watch. Stick to your strategy, know what profits you need to take and act. BEFORE it comes down again

5) Don't disrupt your life. Know how much time you are going to give to crypto everyday.

6) don't invest an amount which if it halves, takes your sleep away. Invest carefully. Small investments of $10 and $20 are fine to start with. No shame in it. In fact, small investments are best FOMO-KILLERS.

7) >95% advice in crypto space is just people's opinion. Try to find and subscribe to those 5% who know this space much better than others.
I FOMO bought at 20k. I panic sold at 6k. I bought back at 11k. Am I the next Warren Buffet?
Wow I look away for 5 mins. RIP money
Silence of the Lambos
A minute of silence who bought the "dip" last few hours or yesterday...
My strategy is simple - Buy now, Regret Short term, Be thankful in Long-term
BE LONG TERM MINDED FOLKS! This only a slight hurdle 
To be honest, I'm actually relieved about these Mt. Gox revelations. We finally know why the price dropped so much, there is actually a reason behind this "unexplained" 75% price decrease. The trustee is still holding a ton of coins, but at least there is a little less uncertainty now.
So we are almost 72-hours into this sell off.  Going from roughly 11.7K to 9.7K... the last dip took about 5 days... and the "Great Flush" to 6K took about one-month.  So almost done with the dip and then on the way to 12K?  Or more to go?  Market psychology.  Manipulation.  Anonymity.  Absence of oversight.  What more could people ask for?  Oh, that's right.  When moon?
to those saying they are out, we went down to 6k and then got back up to 10k . This is nothing
When you buy the dip and it keeps dipping. Nobody wants to invest in this shitty market when low volume drags us up and then we get dumped on with 4x the volume 
I'm buying the dip.  WITNESS ME!
calling the bottom at 8450
Inverted head and shoulders my asshole. It all means nothing. The price goes where it goes, no one can predict anything.
Good luck with all trades today. 
I’m Ray Charles to the FUD 
lol, got back in @9.8. Talk about buying the dip.
Bought at 8.5k then pulled out at 11.2k then bought back in at 11.6k 😂 dumbest decision I’ve ever made in my life. And stupid Coinbase takes forever for the transaction to go through I’m just watching my money go down unable to do anything. 😕
I WILL HOLD MY BITCOIN GOD DAMN IT !!
Lol I just lost 2k and feel like shit
Just natural bull/bear market cycles. Move along. 
Sigh here we go again another insider crash to try to kill crypto
Bought back in at 9.7k. I was thinking about selling my loss to jump in lower but fuck it I’m going to chill out and enjoy life.
Lots of discussion about how the top 1% own 40% of coins. I don't see how this is relevant.  Like how would this not happen?  Everybody in the World gets air dropped the same amount of coins?  Its just the way markets and capitalism work.  Just my opinion, maybe I'm wrong
Guys, I don't come over here much. I usually am in the trading subreddits. However, please don't act irrationally here. We may have reached a local bottom. However, if this looks like it will get worse (e.g., breaking 8.5 and 8.2), please don't just HODL. There are many ways to preserve your gains, including taking a portion out of cold storage and shorting, or maybe just selling to fiat until it clears out if you can't/won't short. 

To the people advising desperate people to ignore evidence and "HODL" through which may be a year+ bear market (or maybe even a decrease all the way down to a lower fixed price), please stop. It is really just setting people up as bag holders. 
Don’t buy just yet. You don’t want to catch a falling knife 
Why is everyone selling? You must be strapped for cash? Bitcoin is volatile but it is going to explode. Upwards.

You live and die 1000 times a week BTC. Can't say its not fun...
From POLONIEX:

	"BTC is currently under maintenance or experiencing wallet/network issues. Deposits and withdrawals will remain disabled until a solution is found, which may require an update from the BTC team. Any updates must be tested and audited before enabling."
I was told we were going to the Moon.  Instead I think the pilot is steering us into the Sun?
Mt Gox guy strikes again?
 Mt. Goxnorrhea Claps Back Electric Bugaloo
The 15 min chart is forming the stairway to hell formation

Everyone restock on 9k memes. We'll probably need them again at some point.
I guess Tom Lee and all the bullish bitcoin analysts are going to be wrong. Bitcoin probably won't hit 25k by the end of the year. Not when the trustee is selling whenever bitcoin gets too high. I'm glad we finally found out who caused the crash to 6k because there had to be an insane amount of dumping on top of the panic that went on during the time. If the Mt. Gox news never happened bitcoin probably could have reached 25k by the end of the year. But this is seriously going to affect bitcoin for a couple of years. I'm guessing bitcoin will probably oscillate between 5k to 10k unless the trustee auctions the rest to a billionaire at a discounted price or the judge says no more needs to be sold.
buy when there's blood in the streets even if the blood is your own
Nobody knows how low it's gonna go, and no one should care. It'll come back up eventually, just be patient.
There seems to be a lot of confusion about the Mtgox bancrupcy trustee and his BTC selloff. Here is what we actually know (from official records and information given to people present at the creditor meeting):

- The trustee sold around 36k BTC + 36k BCH between December and February. The average price was around $10.4k/BTC.
- The proceeds from the sale almost exactly equals the total claims filed (where 1 claimed BTC is fixed in value to ~$460. In fact, it seems that after reaching this threshold the trustee stopped selling.
- The trustee still holds ~165k BTC + BCH. He announced he MIGHT sell more in the future after consulting the court. 
- No mention has been made of how other bitcoin forks  under the trustees control will be handled.
- The addresses for the remaining Mtgox Bitcoins are known. If the trustee moves them, anyone watching the addresses will know.
- At the moment the court is contemplating moving Mtgox out of bankruptcy and into civil rehabilitation, since the rising price of BTC means that the assets exceed the liabilities. The point of this would be to make it possible for the surplus to go to the Mtgox creditors instead of the Mtgox shareholders. A decision is expected in the coming months.
- A majority of the creditors wish to be payed in BTC rather than fiat. The trustee is still investigating if this is possible according to Japanese law.


Dump happened at the exact same time yesterday.....
People who thought they'd got the dip. https://youtu.be/DYJY20zPtqo?t=28s
[deleted]
I felt a big disturbance in the force (and my btc fiat value).
this is going to be a long week
when will this nightmare end
Shaking my head at those 0.001 sell orders. Why invest in crypto in the first place if you can't afford to lose that?
Buy the dip boys
Market Cap will bottom when only the true HODLers are left!  Hodl Strong!💪🏼. Let’s see how much stronger we are this time! Last it was like $280b? 
Pathetic 
Hello darkness, my old friend. I've come to talk with you again. Because my bitcoin softly deepens. Left me broke while I was sleeping....
My last $500 is in.  Let the dice land where they may.
We did not come this far, just to come this far, the swarm is headed towards us but we will hang in there.  

Bitcoin can't be stopped, we put our money and faith in a mathematical framework that is free of politics and human error, it will be everywhere and the world will have to readjust. 
A mix of various quotes. 

Mine:
Bitcoin value is not in the price, if you are just here for that then you will eventually shit your pants and miss the point.
Fuckit I bought some when it went down to 7K last month...Im gonna buy some more if it gets there again!....this aint a a short run...its a marathon!...if you are scared don’t get in!...we don’t need pussies in here!!
To everybody selling. You are retarded. Grow a pair of balls. 
these fake buy and sell walls are more fake than a prostitute having an orgasm in a porno 
I just want to share my feelings. I bought at 17.5k, and I am sad and panicking. However, I consider bitcoin to be long term investment, I do not plan to withdraw bitcoin to fiat until 20-30 years later (I'm in my 20's) I believe I will be right after all, but it is the contradicting emotional feelings and rational thinking that bothers me.
Why don't some of you guys see that every time a whale sells(Mt Gox included), they get weaker and the assets get distributed as they are bought by smart money people buying the dips? Every time there is a sell off by these people, it's VERY healthy for the advancement of BTC. You think 12k to 9k is big...imagine at 100k if they sold everything. Better to weaken the bastards now while BTC is still down 3k than to lose 10's of thousands later
I feel like everytime we get back to 9900+ someone dumps coins lol
To the moon . . . 
someone knows what just happened?
Had to be a whale. The 15 min chart volume on GDAX went from 200 to 1600. Let them sell. If you care about the tech stay in. If you only care about making money then sell or attempt to trade and get burned.
 WTF VEGETA
That's a big wall at 9000 let's see how it goes 
im temped to sell(small amount)
kinda sad to see how big whales like the trustee is basically controlling the market. 
Looks like it's settling at £6.7k
\**Looks at his balance and laughs hysterically*\*
This may be a stupid question, but how is any minable cryptocurrency viable if mining is basically equivalent to printing money.
Calm before the storm? or the wall to strong at 9000
Wowww, double top on the recovery in a downwards trend... Getting ready to buy yet lower in a couple days :)
Jumped back in at 9,300.  
What if satoshi nakamoto sells his 1M Bitcoin? 
I’m open to suggestions on when is the best time to buy more. I keep getting the timing wrong.  Bought at 11.6 as it was charging up only to have it fall almost immediately after.  Bought more at 9.9k as it was creeping past 10k.   Then it fell again.   Now it is 9.3k and I’m tempted to buy more. Should I wait?  
I need a job and money!!!!

Damn bitcoin :(
What are your predictions in the next 24 hrs... More likely to go back up to 10k or down to 8.5k? 

Seems to be rising a bit.  What are you guys going to do?  Buy now, or wait it out?  Are you expecting a larger dip?  Of course no one actually knows, just want to hear some input, I plan myself on buying a bit, just waiting on when..
Hi all, I've been waiting on the sidelines until this morning.  Purchased at just over 9300.  I see a broader trading range between 9000-12000 that could last for a couple more repetitions before it breaks either way.  
Damn, dude, never thought of that thanks
It is shockingly hard to buy Bitcoin in Canada. BMO one of Canada's main 5 banks just banned online CC/debit/interac/wire transfers to anyone selling crypto... To protect consumers form volatility...

Get those Vegeta meme's ready.
Ok, against my better judgment - I am locking in losses now - with the expectation that this market is about to fill up the out-house with shit (so why get covered in it OR get locked up in days of illiquidity).

Stand by, massive rally on its way.  I really hate this.  Trading BTC = window into the soul.
11k buy... sigh...
all the FUD people are just getting super predictable at this point. at least have some creativity. 
Is it possible to confirm if this is mostly the mt gox guy selling?
So when should I start panicking? 
"........dump it all"

Um... Mr. Karpeles sir... may we advise against..

"I SAID..... dump it."

Meh.
I exchanged my crypto for USDT when bitcoin was trading at $10,000 (instead of selling off for fiat currency). So that I can buy at further lows.

I feel this is a good way to be in a position for quick buys and not waiting for the fiat to cryto transactions. Haven't seen anyone talking of this trick in such situations. what do you guys think ? Sane logic ?? 
Don't people dollar cost average any more?
Dumb and dumber up in here.
I was given an amount of BTC in form of a paper wallet approx. 5 years ago. Can someone briefly explain forks to me?
who sees a healthy bounce like that and 5 minutes later says, "oh looks like it's time to sell"
It's going to be an up and down until it shoots up again, don't be fooled by FUD and keep calm and HODL on!
[deleted]
HODL has been easy until now as I was always confident it would go back up but now I just don't know...this one is very hard to take 
this drop is going to be epic 
AS I WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH

Just spoke to John Mcaffee.

8k tonight, 5k end of March, 100k Jan 2019.
Be patient
Aaaand were back on the way down.... 
Another big dump on Bistamp 481 btc
For those stressing about USA taxes, my friend (also a very good tax attorney) made a [free tax calculator/spreadsheet for 2018 crypto gains](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1looBx10QOf_6ntrtv9YSSkseNI18LR5rxxUWTFYmFx4/edit?usp=sharing) under the new 2018 tax changes. He is new to the space and is genuinely curious, from a tax perspective, how this is all going to play out as the IRS wakes up from 2014. He also doesn't think this tax uncertainty should keep people from fully participating in the crypto market. I hope this helps those who just want a quick $$$ answer on their taxes, and people should pester him to make a free 2017 calculator! Cheers
So MtGox disclosed sold BTC and it drops. Jesus people relax.
Woooooo.... what a nice droooopppp. If you did short BTC you are one lucky guy!
6 hr chart falling off a cliff
This is just like a real life version of that “Bogged” clip that was making the rounds a couple of days ago 
ridicolous manipulation - im out for a few months, hodl and chill 
Honestly if the price holds around this level that's 30 percent gains in a month. Astronomical by any investment standards but not what day traders want to hear I know
If I sell the btc I have on coinbase, does the funds get transferred to my bankaccount, or does the dollars stay in coinbase so I can use them to buy btc at a later stage?
Its a blood bath : G20 fears ??
Whale market sold a chunk there IMO, should crawl back up to 10k then hopefully 11.
I think there is plenty of time to buy. I expect it will reach the 8500 support level. If it goes thru that it will be into the 7000's before this done. 
Thoughts on the Roadmap to March Madness?
Hi guys ! Do someone know a bit about Ledger nano ?

I sold at 11,500 and just set a stop buy order at 9800. Does anyone think this is a bad idea? 
Asia bout to decide this market 
at this point the market seems to be waiting for another dump
aaaaahhhhh
Next support is 0.5 FIB, then 8500 . .wow
here we go again
Ugh.. when will this diarrhea stop?
On the bright side, at least we arent hearing too much from those trolls lately calling for down down down and 6k or crash, among things in their vocabulary.
Dollar Cost Averaged my position to an average price of 10200$/btc.  I have a few hundred bucks left to buy low.  I'm just gonna HODL and buy the rest of my position when I deem it to not go much lower.  Anyone think it'll be at 10k anytime in the next two weeks, even briefly?
Now where is that uber-accurate TA person when you need him? And I do not mean the one who keeps posting FUD here.
Watching the gdax order book light up is mesmerizing 
With this rate, I dont see it getting back to 17k anytime soon
Did something big happen? Why is the price so low? Is it purely fear that Mt Gox is still holding on to 160,000 bitcoins and that Japan and China are cracking down on crypto?

It feels to me people are feeling bearish now because of all the regulations taking place, but after the regulations have been implemented or when the Japanese and Chinese find a new way to enter the crypto market this all will be nothing. For example, after China cracked down on chinese exchanges, those exchanges moved to HK and are now operating with greater volumn than before. People from China would actually come to HK just to buy crypto.

Would really want to hear your thoughts. Please comment.
7000 in the morning!

No spare fiat. get ready US bank. I'll send you some cash advance money soon. kappa. 
When moonbo? 
wtf  
that is all
What comes next? 
Last time the market crash stopt at 300 Billion,   now we are at 350. Will it be the same, more or less. Trying to calculate when I will buy. Buy low, hold forever, or sell when the price becomes insanely high. Don't let the dip take you. Last time I had a breakdown, this time I see opportunity.
bitcoin is a bubble? it looks like hyman-minsky model?
is 20k possible in this year?
Im just sitting here, waiting for mt. cocks to plunder his other 180k coins on the market... This guy needs to be taken out.
Apparently I was right, what follows now is the testing of 9.3k threshodl, should 9.3k fall the next target will be around 8.6k so watch out now. If we continue dropping past that we may even hit new bottom C: Honestly it's iffy whether MtGox case can sustain so much selling that it'd crash it so hard. Definitely a number of people will back off now though, so rally back looks grim.

//EDIT So apparently we broke through 9.3k, welcome 8.6k bitcoin, better than drugs indeed.
Must be ellen sellin..... -no balls
https://i.imgur.com/VA7lfpF.jpg
So, I understand the gist of the Mt. Gox crash leading to this crash, but where are those mr.gox bitcoins from, the ones that are being dumped into the market now? Why does this person have all these btc? Are they the stolen bitcoins or just leftover ones that mt. Gox had when they shut down
I don't understand how everyone and their mother is shorting BTC right now.  There is some weird manipulation going on with the market.  We have never seen this many red candles on the daily with so much loss in volume.  Something is up.
Loosely,  120 days ago things were at 7500.   120 before that they were 3 k.  Things are fine.   I have only ever been at a loss when it comes to bitcoin, recent adopter.   I can't believe everyone here so badly needs value to increase to be happy.
I think everyone should sell me their bitcoin cheap, and then  in 20 years I'll buy a flying Lambo yacht when Bitcoin is the world currency.
Holy fuk @ that red dildo. Goodnight sweet $8800

edit: goodnight $8700. Fucker is falling fast. 
I think 8k min but idk what I’m talking about 
Bitcoin is die. Bitcoin is life. You can't predict both. It is like yin and yang. Like sweet and spice. 
Wait for golden petal of life formation under graph and then wait. Price will be achieved. Goals achieved. Great life. Enjoy life. 
I’m out
Time to buy more...
Can anyone name a single utility that BTC offers right now to justify a 9k price valuation?

I need the answer for my school science project. Thanks guys.
I don't think Bitcoin will ever crash too much to not be absorbed and brought back up. Bitcoin has made a name for being worth a lot of money. If people hear that it's all of a sudden really cheap, they'll just buy it again, making the price go up.
Morning all! Could this me the start of a mini pump and dump cycle? Jump in at 10k jump out at 12.5k.
DCA when buying during these dips. 
I started as a noob so I made some bad trading mistakes last year. Now I know what I am doing but I do not want to sell the mistake trades from last year. Plz give me one big green dildo to 14k and I can start again with trading like a Professional. Not influenced by those facking guys which are spreading stupid fud.
So, 4H RSI and 1H Stoch RSI oversold. Plenty of room for going up in the next few hours.
A bit of a gamble but inverted head and shoulders might be at play. $9.8K-$10K possible within the next few hours, hopefully. The alternative is not good at all... 
Feeling nervous yet bois?
We're going through a double bottom. The price will drop to around $6000 mid-March. After that, we're going to the moon.
Here is an observation - When BTC price is rising or stagnant, trades using Tether > trades using USD.  But when BTC price is dropping, it's the other way round.

My interpretation is that in a convoluted way, Tethers are being using to pump up/maintain BTC price and later cashed out in USD via BTC.  

Happy to stand corrected.
Wont go below 5k
Flash sale.... *fires in background*
Pump it and paint a bull flag 
And my funds clear two hours after the price starts to go back up, arse!
Is buying this dip a good idea, or should I wait to see if it tanks even further? I feel like if it hits below 8k a ton of people will sell
There is a case for $3k... It has happened to BTC before and could happen again. There's no certainty about anything but it may happen. Just be aware.
I am 100% convinced that the price drop was a whale selling. The volume spiked to 1600 BTC on the 15 min chart for two 15 min intervals then went back to the 400 we have been seeing for a week.

If you sell now you are stupid.
[deleted]
Price is just speed of  transfer wealth to bitcoin. Every 10 minutes there is shift of 125000$. Is it slow? I dont think so.
Bought at 10k , not even worry if it goes to 7 k, good trade everyone
Can someone explain to me why this criminal with 180K btc left is allowed to just play with people's lives ? If 2013/2014 wasn't enough he's now doing the same thing just because he can ? Why doesn't the government confiscate his funds ? In my country that's what happens when you declary Bankruptcy, you lose your house, savings, etc to pay back not keep the money so you can play with thousands of peoples lives and potentially bankrupt millions.

I wouldn't be surprised if this guy turns up dead in a few weeks as I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one feeling the same. 
Ah so Bitcoin just dropped because Mt. Gox was trolling the market. That makes more sense. 
www.mtfud.com
...wtf
Someone else dumping bitcoin now?

Background music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSUIQgEVDM4
GDAX - can anyone explain to me specifically what to do to set an order in GDAX so that if Bitcoin goes back up to 9500, I automatically place an order (preferably with limited fees)? I tried reading up on limit/stop orders to do this with a sell order and I screwed it up and ended up selling at my lower limit. Thanks for any help!
Not again..
I'm really glad I saved up some fiat for this occasion!
Anyone else see the glitch to 58000 lol.
Someone should replace the „insert korean FUD“ line in this bogdanov video with some random „china bans crypto once again“ line. Maybe the guy spreading the china FUD right now could help?
Is it the pré-G20 collateral dommage effect. Fear of bad annoncement 17-18 march ????
I have a question.

After months of bloodbath on both sides (BTC and alts). What will happend to alt-coins when BTC is starting the upwards/bull-trend again?

Usually alt-coins go down when BTC rises, since people sell their alts to buy btc to gain value. The last months we have seen alts value plummet down the drain. Do you think alt-coins will go even further down to new levels we haven't seen when BTC rises after this long correction? Or will they stabilize on the red levels they have now?
Is this just a case of the whales knowing they can get reduced prices for Bitcoin because of the Mt Gox seller and therefore why bother to increase the price at the moment?
I want to place an order on GDAX only if the price goes up to 9600. Would I do that through a Stop Buy order set to 9600? When I try it, I get a message that says "This order may fill at a price less favorable than the stop price. Are you sure you would like to continue?" What does that mean? 
What happens when news interferes with TA? Do traders consider the change as part of the wave pattern? Do they continue the same pattern at a lower price? Bitcoin seemed set to break the previous peak at 11.8k until FUD struck thrice yesterday, but now it's a different story.

If this push doesnt move it, we got another big poopy commin tmrw
Is there any respite for us or shall we just run for the hills?
The Shorts and Longs are having a meeting right now about it . . 
how many fucking sell coins does whomever this is have jesus haha
IM out also boys.ill buy back when i can turn my remaining money into a few coins at the low
lots of green but small amounts
Rally commencing, I just sold some.
BTC bout to go in dry on 9k support. WEEEEEEEEEEEE.
Going straight down to 8.5 k
Coinbase not accepting my credit cards. Is that coinbase or my credit cards?
It sucks though seeing alts crash even though they have no relation to Mt. Gox at all.
no reason i find for this ridiculous dip  defiantly individual selling chunk of btc 
The read walls tho 
WHomever it is, is keeping the price at a range after they dump. kept it at 9800 then 9300 now 8600 it never leaves those ranges no matter what.   Then every 12 hours or so, they dump it
End the bloodbath!!
GG for today... New game tomorrow.
I think it's going back up
The moment that I did a EMT to fund fiat to my account at exchange, it's starting to go back up. well...
When Vegeta 
Here it comes!
bull trap?
If it happens in the very short term, it will happen tomorrow. Hoping not though. Hoping not.
Sure doesn't look like the currency for the world today, does it?    Just another speculative token tumbling in value.   Where are the *to-the-moon!* guys?  We sure could use a positive attitude.
For the love of God Almighty please stop buying these "dips". These aren't dips, these are the first streams gushing through the cracks on the dam. 
Here's my prediction: $6k by march, then 9k in september, then for the next 18 months it will be in a holding pattern between $10-12k, in August of 2019 it will form another bubble and go to $35k, crash back to $5k in the next 3 months and then go to the MOON after that starting in December of 2021, topping out at $85k by March 14, 2025.
[deleted]
Can’t make it back up to 9k anymore
the dump is real. RIP
7000's Saturday  . . 
Now price will test 6k..free fall no support lines 
6k coming again soon! Get ready for round 2.
MtGox is going to crash the bitcoin market twice aren't they.. What the fuck. Confiscate their coins! 
**2.1 Bitcoins**, and you're set for life. :-)
Binance,bitfinex, bitmex, gate.io,  etc. The main digital currency exchanges have been shielded by GFW, and the price of bitcoin is bound to fall sharply in the coming period. SELL your coins ASAP. Good luck!
This is a fucking joke lol.
Goodbye student loans. 
So the mtgox trustee still have 160k btc to sell...he will stuff up the price every time he dumps 30 to 40k like this time.
Tempted to buy, shall I wait longer? 
What's up with this Bitcoin price?🙄
looks like Asia is about to dump again
after the bull masket of 2017, a bull market in 2018 would be so great.

lol I knew this shit would happen
Dollar cost average when buying these dips. Don't throw all your money into the pit at the same time 
I started investing in crypto December 2017, so I don't know how MTGox exchange worked in the past. With what today's exchange does MT.Gox look like in terms of size, volume, reliability?

Coinbase

Binance

Kucoin

Trade Satoshi
Please keep dropping! Christmas came early this year.
So there are still more than 150,000 bitcoins waiting to be sold and the price is already $8k-$9k already. This time it sure goes below $5k.
Oya, seems like I was right again. So let's go new lows :D

Weak hands shall light us the way into the abyss.
1 day chart.Big red lolilol knives.Don't know when they will hit the floor and stop to cut the cake.But we all know what happen after a movement in one direction, the other come next. The question is when now, that's all.Anyway, those who are selling like that and making it going down know that it's not in their interest to push it too more down or they will break our toys and no one will want to play with.I'm waiting to buy more, hesitating to wait more to be honnest, and i'm still holding old BTC that are in red now with this price, but no way i would sell them now, it would be ridiculous.
The amount of fake walls is hilarious. Watch them turn to nothing when the price comes near. 
for all bitcoinhaters ... have my money already been made ... and you?
You can be happy that it went down, so do i :)
It gives us the chance to only make more money.
gtfo we are going to look down on you from the moon
ABANDON SHIP GUYS, I REPEAT ABANDON SHIP!!
When is this archaic, non useful diahrea coin going to stop dumping? Its like its been fed 2 family packs of laxatives and the alt coin market is the toilet bowl.
It's time we face reality guys...were all dead the charts are literally a stairway to hell right now cut your losses buy back when its under 9k again

Be a whale. I say it everyday. Stop the "buy the dip" mentality and look at volume/price objectively. Not the time to buy yet; but keep your eyes open.
Test - which crypto will make the greatest gain in 2018? 
lol at who ever is buying now

8k coming soon
I was about to buy at 9280 but then regretted it, it looks like its gonna drop even lower than that
the inflation comes to an end, 8k by morning ?
The next bottom is $3k
Everyone needs to sell now. The end of Bitcoin is now. Even the Bitcoin millionaires agreed that this is the end of bitcoins run. There's an end to everything always.
I keep telling everyone, $7000 by the end of Sunday. No one wants to listen. The end is approaching and all in the know are selling off. Just wait. BTC is < $3000 by April. 
It appears we're once again crossing the downtrend line. Mr. Kobayashi, please get your hands off the keyboard and let us pass. https://www.tradingview.com/x/yaUJEKKs/

Apparently the Mt.Gox trustee still has many more BTC to dump? If true I might sell while I'm ahead, and wait for a deeper dip before I buy more
Bullish scenario: A high volume break above $11,000 in the next 72 hours would mean the sell-off from March 5 high of $11,700 has bottomed out around $9,577 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement) and could yield a much-awaited bullish break above the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance.
What a great time to buy :)
The obvious solution to this mt gox problem is for btc holders to move into altcoins. The whale that exists in btc is way too dangerous right now. 
Tax selling

Thank god for TA, we all saw this coming. Classic inverted head and shoulders, easy game.
The most useless feature on gdax is the 'depth chart'
People killing the messenger. Many commenters had very accurate posts here yesterday and earlier today. Some people are interested in analysis and other perspectives. If you only want to read about "lambos" and "getting to the moon", chances are you're not an investor but a gambler. 
I think I'm going to start reporting people for shitting on TA or taking the piss out of it. It's really starting to generate a negative atmosphere in these threads.
Why did no one listen to me? I've been called a troll and many other choice names.  I said last Sunday that BTC will be $7000 this Sunday, and it's right on track. The falling knife cuts deep. It will be < $4000 by the end of March. This fairytale is over.  I seriously suggest selling all now before you lose more. Unless, you like watching it fall into the depths of hell.
if we don't close the day above 9.3k....than we are screwed

For my last act of the night as a show of support for bitcoin I will buy some more bitcoin right now - half of what’s left of my fiat stack.  Maybe you will buy some too.  I hope to wake up to a stabilized bitcoin in the morning higher than before.  
Bitcoin = Shitcoin = Ran out of steam = hype is dead = snail shit coin.
