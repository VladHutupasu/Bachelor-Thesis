[Daily Discussion] Monday, May 14, 2018 -- TITLE
#New post: [\[Daily Discussion\] Tuesday, May 15, 2018 →](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8jipk9/daily_discussion_tuesday_may_15_2018/)
Let me begin by saying I have tremendous respect for all of you trading this market. Truly, truly so. There is chop and there are scalps to be had. Nevertheless, in any market where trading has become balkanized over a number of exchanges, regulations are lax or nonexistent and (most importantly) volume is extremely low, I am left to conclude that the ability to trade leveraging TA techniques will result in outcomes that are no better than 50-50 overtime. As a quick aside, I’d highly recommend reading “When Genius Failed” about the collapse of LTCM.


What needs to be accepted is the fact that far better equipped and resourced institutional participants have entered the fray. Make no mistake. BTC has crossed the Rubicon. Be it Goldman Sachs or the NYSE, every single major financial service provider is taking the entire crypto space as a serious market. They’ve no choice. Their clients are demanding the service and their clients are also demanding the accumulation of BTC at “attractive levels”. 


I am sharing this with you all in that I’ve operated in this very space (legacy financial services) for more than 20 years. Any name you see as “thinking” or “building” a crypto platform has already begun that process. Know, without question, that these groups are operating in this space, and trading with and against you, as I type.  


While I am fully prepared for all of your down votes, I must vehemently counter the fact where many of you continue to press the case that selling and downward pressure occurs solely because “sellers want to sell”. To a certain extent, yes, but when you evaluate the Bitfinex order book closely you will find that this downward pressure at the moment is being very well managed. Without question buyers at present are far and few between. Until that changes there isn’t any chance of a material break out on the upside. At the same time, however, the manner, size and timing in which sell and buy orders arise makes – again for me – it rather clear that there is what I will describe as “forced” accumulation. 


My meaning behind “forced” accumulation” is simply that the above-mentioned institutional actors will operate in a way where enough pressure is applied so that the more typical market participants (you and me) either sell out of fear of the price falling even further or those selling under the expectation of buying at a lower level. To the latter group I would advise that such a strategy will work until it doesn’t.    


Where do I see all of this going? Not that any of you asked (explicitly or otherwise), but take the following as intended; nothing more than one person’s outlook. Over a period of time, and I’ve no idea how long, institutions and accredited investors will be buyers of BTC. Slow, steady and unseen. This will be done through OTC markets and exchanges. There will then come a point in time when the period of accumulation has reached a point of saturation and the price for BTC will then rise and – for me – will rise both quickly and unexpectedly. We are, after all, speaking to an asset class where supply and demand will end up carrying the day. 

I will remain long term invested and for now I wish you all good trading days ahead.

Wow, I lack attention to detail. I absolutely realized Consensus was going on and also know that it has been a buy the rumor, sell the news event. However, I had no idea where it was happening.

Just checked into my hotel for a work trip and saw a guy having a smoke outside wearing a shirt that says "talk crypto to me."  30 second google search says its happening down the road. Will tally and report on all t-shirts re: BTC viewed after 5pm EST. 

Edit: Will absolutely be stalking bars outside of event after work hours.
I decided I’m here for the technology. My portfolio went from 4500$ to 1500$, so I guess I’m not here for the money.
Can we now agree most of us don't have a clue what the price is doing short term? 
So, it's been an interesting 72 hours to say the least. 

The market spent the entire day yesterday pushing relentlessly upwards, but dropped like a stone when it hit resistance between $8,700 and $8,800. The result was a breakdown below a bit of a janky bear flag that formed following the $9,400 to $8,200 drop:

https://imgur.com/a/sI9xlbL

The target for this breakdown would be roughly $7,000, which seems a bit excessive at the moment, but targets are what they are, regardless of whether I think they're especially likely. They're just math. 

In the short term, there's bear flag-ception going on with a small flag forming on the 30m:

https://imgur.com/a/W7nG2A7

This one breaks down at around $8,360 at the moment and breaks up at around $8,500 at the moment. 

So if you're out of position like I am, you're looking for an opportunity to short a breakdown of the smaller formation. Or possibly a short at the top of the formation with stops $50 north of the resistance line if if possible, although we might not get the opportunity.

I had a bit of an off weekend with two poorly timed entries in a row (one long, one short). Funnily enough, they were both at current price, so had I been more patient with both I could have closed at breakeven instead of taking losses on them. A good lesson that trading within consolidation periods = bad idea. 

EDIT: !short BTCUSD 8400 10x 100%

While a pump to $8,500 is possible (perhaps even likely), I'd rather get in early than have to wait for a breakdown and for Bitmex's servers to make it impossible to get into a decent position.
I'd argue that not even bots are making money scalping the past few hours.
BGD II, electric boogaloo.
I like to zoom way out from time to time and look at the 3D chart with guppy to get a squinty\-eyed high\-level view of what's happening.

[https://i.imgur.com/168z8GT.png](https://i.imgur.com/168z8GT.png)

As you can see, zoomed this far out, it confirms the sentiment of indecision that many have right now. Fractally speaking, from the formation we're in, both up and down have occurred in the past, according to the very limited sample of data we have.

Some of the smarter Wyckoff traders I follow on Twitter are undedcided right now as to whether we are in reaccumulation or distribution, or reaccumulation masquerading as distribution. A medium term trade right now is nothing but a gamble IMO.

I continue to hodl for now.
**Position Bot operational**

The bot should be up and running now. If it missed your commands just PM [/u/position_bot](/u/position_bot) with your commands.

Any problems just report them to be. 
Edit: Sorry for how long this post got; I was away from major chart watching for the weekend and needed to throw up a bunch on the page to get all my ducks in a row.

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/x4V9yBaR-Horizontal-Analysis/

Medium term chart for me is all focused on horizontal levels; the flags I'll talk about secondary. The two main levels to point out: ~8.2k, and ~7.8k.

8.2k coincides closely with the 50% FIB retracement from ~6.4k to ~9.9k. In addition, it is the beginning zone of a high volume node (right of chart) that also coincides with a pretty good horizontal support level (orange line). In blue I've highlighted areas of interest for this horizontal support; it served as quite the resistance post BGD (other than a momentary bart above it).

7.8k coincides with a slightly smaller high volume node but has also been a pretty strong horizontal support/resistance line on the timeframe we're looking at. It, too, coincides  approximately with the 61.8% FIB level.

These are the two major supports I've been watching in recent times and will continue to watch. FWIW, we seem to have topped out in the approximate zone of the 38.2% FIB level.

*IF* 7.8k breaks down, we'll possibly encounter some token support at 7.5k but more likely be headed to a retest of the lows.

So how do we get some inkling of whether or not 8.2/7.8 will hold? Well, who really knows. But this is where the flags come in. In yellow, you can see I've drawn two congruent flags. Depending on how lax you want to be, you could see them as already breaking down, but with heavy 8.2k support right there below it, in my opinion that's the level to really watch. The target for the smaller flag would be around 7.8k when adjusted for the heavy supports, providing more confluence. If you take that large flag as valid (it's not as well formed, but pretty apparent on longer term charts than 4 hours),  then we're likely looking at testing the bear trend lows again.

The flags breaking up is harder to trade if you want a great entry. The current "top" is around 8.8k, but it'll continue going up. Entering here could be a great position if 8.2k does hold and the flags end up breaking upwards; however, that's looking risky. 8.6k could be a decent r/r entry place - if we do manage to get back up there it's likely for a retest of the top of the flag at least; you'll probably have an opportunity to exit at break even if 8.8k fails again or something.

Anyway, my current state for those who care: Been 80% fiat since a little over 9k, bought in significantly for a short time around 8.2-8.3k, but exited too quickly at the initial return to 8.35k as I got skittish and held that 80% fiat all the way through 8.7k and back down to where we are now. Planning on entering 30% between 8k-8.15k and another 30% between 7.8k-8k, with stops on those below 7.75k. If we don't get down to those levels I'll be fully bought back in by the time we get back above 8.65k.


...Longer term chart that's similar to pretty much everyone elses: https://imgur.com/a/Fcf1pHh  
Yellow lines are the current big triangles. We broke out of one but seemed to meet heavy resistance at another line. I realize the beginning of the less steep resistance *seems* less convincing, but at the time of that 13k top 13k was really heavy resistance. Huge parabolic walls on order books in the upper 12ks all over the place. Take that FWIW; just what I anecdotally remember. More important is that support line. I don't really think we ever fall under the steeper downtrend again; however, that yellow support seems to be vital and that falling would be the final straw, imo, for a very long bear market somewhat similar to 2014. 

The high volume node in the low 8ks-high 7ks is very evident here as well, plus the failure swing + bear div apparently signifying the end of the recent uptrend on the daily RSI.
Short from around $8,700 with stops above $8,900. 

Pretty good r/r, and I figured I'd try shorting closer to the top than the bottom this time. 
I just found this posted in the ethtrader sub. 

https://i.redd.it/3pu9czjlipx01.jpg

It's a schedule of the talks at consensus starting today. Maybe helpful for someone here.

I just saw that there is no presenter of bitcoin. Is that normal? Is it an event exclusively for alts? If yes, should we still consider it for our trading behaviour this week? 

Have a nice trading week everyone.
My short from 8,670 got stopped out by $1 or $2 at 8,755 overnight. Sucks when you're right about the direction but get your stops wrong by just a few dollars. I was long from 8.3 to 8.7 though, so still a good weekend of trading.

I torn about re-opening a short here. There seems to be a return of bullish sentiment, but the graph indicates we are going lower imho. I wouldn't be surprised if we just bart around here for a while now.



Just a friendly reminder to not do anything rash this week.
So is it more bullish we can’t break down through $8,200 or more bearish we can’t break $8,900? 

We just gonna float here in no mans land ? 
Interesting thay you guys are posting positions, while I’m here getting the system overlod error
Now this is the BTC I like and enjoy to trade
I had a pretty interesting morning. Went to quote a plumbing job and the building was  filled bitmain miners. I estimate that had 400 miners running but they are just moving in and look ready to scale at least 20x of what they had running. First time seeing a mining farm of that scale. 

Anyways to keep this post related to trading, i am still out in fiat and will only re enter once 10k is broken. Still bearish on medium timeframes  
Reposting this as a top-level comment because I think it's important. 

As should be obvious to anybody with eyes, the bitcoin market has no fucking clue what it wants to do right now. And here's my opinion as to why. The market is caught between numerous short-term, medium-term, and long-term trends: and they're all conflicting. 

The medium-term bear trend was broken a few weeks ago when the market broke the [log resistance line](https://imgur.com/a/t3nTPvp) at $8,500. 

The longer-term bull trend broke several months ago when the [log channel support](https://imgur.com/a/zFMgN4G) broke down.

There's a [short-term bear trend](https://imgur.com/a/qERLiOG) formed from the $9,950 high and the $9,400 bounce that's being tested at the moment. 

The [short-term bull trend](https://imgur.com/a/vOd1kCu) formed after the big green candle was broken to the downside last week.

[This is the only bullish trendline](https://imgur.com/a/VUarUvt) that's still intact, and it's quite a ways down at the moment.

So ya, we're in a short-term bear trend and a medium-term bull trend...but the trendline for the medium-term bull trend is more than 20% below current price. 

It's a shitshow.
This weekend sucked. After 9,300 wedge broke down, I DCA'd at 9,000 and 8,600 (June futures, entry was 9,475) and decided to cut loss at 8,700 on Friday.

I opened a short at 8,738 today (June futures) and plan to ride this until 8,100.

BTW, ETH ratio is holding up pretty nicely.
I generally think Consensus is a dud for BTC but some cool announcements come from it, e.g.:
https://www.leaprate.com/cryptocurrency/exchange/former-oanda-and-alpari-ceo-daniel-skowronski-launches/

If you had any experience with Oanda you will know that the matching engine works great. I know mex is working on it but having competition via a smooth platform for leveraged trading *with a fiat onramp* could be a welcome sight for both retail and institutional players.

As [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8j9i8m/daily_discussion_monday_may_14_2018/dyyfsav/) pointed out, institutional funds are already here and institutional platforms are working on products.  The funds do not enter in the way that is popularized. They won't just pour money in and let it rise, they will try strategies to get the entry down to where they want it.

What does this all lead to? bigger bets incoming -> higher volatility.   

I see both recent lows and highs being hit --- 6k and 10k --- on xbtu18 prior to expiry.

From friend at consensus2018:

The sentiment around BTC & ETH at consensus2018 is "exciting without the euphoria & leemurs".

Also said:

"I had no idea that BCH was viewed widely as a highly manipulated joke."


Anybody else think the simplest TA methods are the most effective? Trend lines, Fibonacci retracements, H&S, flags, res/sup level, etc.. The more complex and the more obscure patterns(e.g. Gartley), the less effective it seems because perhaps other people don't view it that way and act on it.

Also, imo, Elliott Wave is only good for setting target sell price. That shit never seems to work (look at D4rkEnergy..) and people seem to always tweak the waves to make them fit to the current prices ("Oh, that was wave 4")

Fractal idea
Wtf is this? Consensus opening ceremony?
Wtf is going on
This move fucked my strategy up big time. Just waiting now out of position. 
Underwater on a short again

It’s starting to feel more normal losing money than making money 

My body is ready 
I can't wait to short the bottom of this move at $8,400 again! /S
It's official. Trading Bitcoin = Gambling.

Anyone who tells me otherwise is lying to themselves.

Nothing makes sense anymore. It's just barts up and down, and it's a fucking joke at this point.

I'm on the right side of this one though.
I'd be careful going long here... we're butting up [against the resistance line since $9.9k downturn.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/osrjrDD5/)

If we happen to break above this line, I'll be more sold on a reversal
Not sure if this was discussed earlier, but was more than a little surprised at both the number AND size of the total liquidated longs listed over at Bitmexrext over the past 5 hours.   

Example of one of the larger liquidations below. 

https://twitter.com/BitmexRekt/status/995865092129525760

the bbands on the 4h are getting pretty tight again, volume is kind off picking up although its still pretty low.There is a bullish divergence on the lower timeframe rsi's but thats about it. My guess is that we go up to test 8700 or 8800 again, if we fail this may be the catalyst to push us down to 7800. A bounce from there would be nice although seeing how previous support acts as resistance i find it tough to believe that we will be revsiting 10k in the next few weeks. Either way it opens some nice positions to pick up cheap alts and scalp some extra btc.
This is quite ridicuous.
Is this what barting is?
Some people got BitmexRekt: https://imgur.com/a/2QzIwfA
Just closed out the other half of my 5x long from 8.4 (opened Friday) at around 8.7. This market is just feeling weird so I'm gonna take profit and sit on my hands for a little while. 
These barts are probably devastating to trading bots lol.
I’m shorting this with a tight stop loss. Short at 8750 5x leverage. Stop loss at 8860. Highly skeptical of the BGD and no significant retracement so far. I’m keeping my SL close in case I’m totally wrong & this things blows through 9000
Coming up on 5 hours of sideways right now, +/- 1%. Pretty remarkable given the volatility of the past 18 hours. 

Downtrend: https://www.tradingview.com/x/LInHDdVe/  
Pennant: https://www.tradingview.com/x/tRi7uFrA/  

There's really not a lot to chart at the moment. The downtrend log line from our 9900 top is just overhead. We were in a bull pennant that faked downwards and then reformed as a pennant again. Volume is decreasing as we chug along sideways. RSI is cooling off. It feels like everyone is just holding their breath.

Shorts rose steadily overnight, but dumped back to pre-BGD levels since the BGD. Longs are down against shorts, but still outnumber 3:2 (about typical).

Holding my short from 8750. Got one add (doubling position) above with a market stop absurdly tight above that. I'm either going to be very right or very wrong. 
Adding to my short here, with stops above the resistance line. Average now 8828. 

This will retrace eventually. And bouncing of the resistance line means the market is respecting it even though it only has two touches.
Alright, what the fuck is going on with the market today
Interesting to note that at about the same time as the spike this morning, the Supreme Court \(in the USA\) announced it would allow states to legalize sports gambling if they wanted to. Many online sportsbooks currently accept bitcoin, and there is definitely a parallel between gambling and cryptocurrencies.  I see this news as actually less beneficial to bitcoin, as legalization should push cash more to the forefront and scale back the usage for crytos in this regard, but interesting to note nonetheless.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/14/us\-supreme\-court\-rules\-for\-new\-jersey\-in\-states\-fight\-to\-legalize\-sports\-betting.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/14/us-supreme-court-rules-for-new-jersey-in-states-fight-to-legalize-sports-betting.html)
Price action since 9900 seems like its just been a series of bear flags within larger bear flags.  I see bear flags on literally time frame.  It's not as clean but even the daily time frame looks like a big bear flag with the pole from 10k down to 8200 and some chop between 8200 and 8800.  Don't see how anyone can be bullish with price action like this.
Bull pennant broke down:

https://imgur.com/a/oOrprWG

Could bart, could find support somewhere between $8,400 and $8,700. 

Crazy world today.

EDIT: Called it a flag initially, which was inaccurate. It was a pennant.

I bet thomas lee is stroking his dick so hard right now. 
Got into position at 8600 yesterday...  Was about to sell for a small loss and then..... a Wild BGD appeared...
!short XBTUSD 9400 10X 100%

I already opened and closed this position, but i wanted to update the bot to make sure there's not a gap in my trading history.

edit: That's going to be a hard one to fix. /u/justanotherlogin I'm going to close it at breakeven in a moment. Could you remove it from the DB?
this market is ABSURD, are you kidding me? jesus how can you play with my emotions like that
What is bart? I left for a couple weeks and now everyone is using bot commands and saying bart. 
I think at this point everybody is waiting for a fakeout and then a big market sell or buy on bitfinex to kickstart a BXD... boring... :( 
As a bull with a good entry... Chill out boys. Euphoric/reactionary trading is what has been getting burnet lately.

Be skeptical of yourself.


So yesterday when we started grinding up I was toying with the idea that we might be in a giant bearflag since out 8.2k low including all our BGD's and Barts, except for the dump earlier today which briefly saw us break to the downside of the flag, but we pulled back to the upper boundary of the flag. 

Right now we're grinding the top of the flag, but we're nearing our resistance line from 10k -> 9.4k. this will be resolved in the next ~~3-4 hours~~ more like 5-9 hours (whoops), and if we fall out of our flag here, we have the immediate target of 7.7k. Breakdown currently would be at 8.55k, though there is some horizontal support at 8.3k. 

Just maybe something to keep in mind before we get all elated with the price action.

I think it's busy drawing Bart's nose before going down.
Model price based on tx rate: 7-day average: $4837, 28-day average: $5176.

 Model price = 10^-0.638 \* (tx per day)^2.181 / # total coins.

Explanation is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2hyl9c/daily_discussion_wednesday_october_01_2014/ckxhy9y) with [historical graphs of price vs. model](https://i.imgur.com/HnZQ9rv.png) (last updated 2018-04-09) and [graphs of other correlations](http://imgur.com/a/7koaG) (last updated 2017-01-30). The code is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2oyrfq/code_for_tx_model/) if you want to improve on it.


**Accuracy of model and recent bearishness**

 Note, that this model has been doing relatively well if it is within *the same order of magnitude* of the price. That is to say, it is not a very accurate predictor of price, and to be within a factor of two of the market price (as recently) is effectively no strong signal. However, the prediction did dip just before the recent pop.

**Batching, UTXO count and so on.**

I have seen no convincing evidence that batching is currently a major effect to reduce the daily tx rate, and a cursory examination shows a similar dip in the UTXO network measure.
I am interested, long term, in alternatives to tx rate (given lightning etc) but I do not think UTXO count is a convincing alternative over, for example, unique addresses.
Parsing the blockchain directly for outputs per block is one possible alternative to deal with batching, payment channels notwithstanding.
Long from the bottom of this candle, and short from the top of it.  I am now a prisoner.

Edit:  and the market is just as indecisive.  Doji smack in the middle:  https://imgur.com/BAhUnmB (actually 15 min woulda looked better)

Edit 2: let the long go after the 100% retrace.  And added to short to bring ca down to the top of the last candle of that mini bart.  I hope I don't get double faked out here.
I've seen too many people forget about rule 1 and rule 4. We, as a community, expect excellence from everyone, all the time. It doesn't matter if you are offended by what someone says. The communal expectation is that we are excellent to people who are not excellent to us. If you can't do that then you should report and ignore.

Please stay off my radar for rule violations.

Bear flag forming. I think this will go down and test 8200 again. 
Bitcoin (or its masters) seems inclined to create maximum confusion on these big short term movements. Kind of expecting to see another big green candle before a drop.
Closed half my short from 9440ish at 8378. Still waiting to jump back in with the rest. Today seems even more “could go up or down” than the last several. 
it's barty time! 
I think I make magical pancakes... got tired of staring at the charts and went to make pancakes just to get my mind off it for a while... Well I guess I better haul ass back to the kitchen and make some more pancakes!!!

lol bgd 8 minutes late but I’ll accept 

No homo
Looks pretty bear flaggy on the 1h.
Great time to remind the noobies that alot of people in this space succeed in trading less rather than more. I have my long from 6.6 still open. I said I'd close it at 10 and should've but I was away on vacation and I have a strict zero trading policy when with my significant other. I'll look to close it at 10 soon and open another long at 12. I generally hate shorting, but depending on the resistance at 11.7 I may open one, just haven't decided on a target to close it if I do. Best of luck fellas. And to the moon! 
Yikes shorters getting rekt 
Andddd we are back to where we were yesterday before the dump. This seems very manipulated / orchestrated ever since the drop 9300. It seems like two main camps of traders are trading this market.
I'm relatively new as a trader, and have really enjoyed following this sub for the last few weeks. Among the lessons learned so far, the hardest one was to not sell too soon when a trade move is confirmed. I've made the same mistake twice now. When things turn out right it's equally important to keep your cool as when they go pear shaped. 
Hours of pennant formation, followed by breakout only to put in some wicks above 8.8? This market is a shit show. 

Currently in an underwater short from 8745 with stops above 8.9

Edit: No longer underwater :) lowered my stops. Back to bed. 
Stops hit on my short, flipped long,  Not sure what the news is, but there's apparently news?

!short XBTUSD close 8599
damn. that was unexpected.
This resistance may be really really tough:

Does anyone here trade successfully on a 1d timeframe? I love the corn and I love the sub, but I hate spending my wake hours staring at charts. I'd like to subscribe to your newsletter if you do so.
Bitmex has recently introduced its version of a put option with a strike price of 7500 on May 18.
Textbook bull pennant formed on 1 hr and smaller time frames. Just broke upward as I was typing. 
Who else is feeling excited right now?
You bet against the house repeatedly, you're going to get burned eventually. Consensus effect is playing out nicely. Can I start to gloat a little now, u/two_bit_misfit ?
My 9180 long from last week sometime got stopped out for a pretty significant loss. Trying again here. As much as I'd like to believe we're out of the dog house, It just feels like too much too fast.

I don’t know about us versus them. That kind of tribalism is unhelpful. Decentralization is a critical priority.  Second layer is essential. Do second layer and optimize the blockchain in ways that don’t risk further centralization. Once that is done, we can see what further changes are required.
Long post of analysis here.

For reference, here's a zoomed out overview of my chart (edit: Ignore that little blue arrow way back in Oct. That's just my marker for where I first bought bitcoin):

Closer view: 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/sHIdZnSU/


Since January, we've been trending up and down in approximate 30-day cycles (that coincide roughly with the 5th of each month), creating lower highs and higher lows. And we'll likely be breaking out of this triangle formation by the end of June (though it's possible we could break out this month). 

A break **down** would give us a target of about 1.3k. A break **up** would give us a target around 14.4k. I personally discount a break down because we spent significant time at the beginning of April trying to push down below 6k again and failed to do so. It really felt to me like the bottom was in at that point. Also of note is that if you follow the down trend line from peak of 19.8k to the peak of 17k to the peak of 11.8k (Feb 20), it goes directly to April 4th where we did some weird *barts*. I think that was the pivot point and the market trying to find its new baseline channel. 

If you look at where we are right now, we're tucked back into that upward channel started by bart formations on April 4th. That to me, is a huge bullish sign: We're going up. But will we go down again before we go up? **I see three likely scenarios:**

* **1)** We're in a downtrend cycle, so I'd expect bitcoin to make another point of contact on the bottom of the triangle by early June. If we do that, I'm thinking a low of about 7150 between May 24th & June 3rd and we would climb upward through June and break out (up) end of June or early July. 

* **2)** Because we're close to the end of the triangle and already have enough points of contact for it to be a valid formation, we might not complete this down trend cycle by touching the bottom again. We could instead continue up the "bart channel" and break out/up from the triangle this month (probably between May 25th & June 1). 

* **3)** A third possibility is that we follow up the bart channel and have a failed breakout (or attempt to breakout) of the triangle, then drop down to the bottom and have the breakout later in June. If we do that, I'd expect us to climb until we're back in the bart channel as we head toward the target of 14.4k.

Of course, bitcoin is bitcoin and anything can happen. Any random awesome or awful news could dramatically affect the market. And of course TA is only a tentative guide, not a rulebook. But assuming this all plays out the way it appears, I think no matter which way we break out of this triangle, we'll be seeing 14k by the end of September. 
I'm not sure if I'm even bullish in the medium long-term (next 2 years or so) any more, and It has nothing to do with the price action. 

I'd like to see adoption increasing rather than just the number of traders/speculators. All bullish news has been about new trading desks opening up etc, while the bearish news has been things like vendors ceasing to accept BTC as payment, increased difficulty in anonymously acquiring BTC etc. The best bullish news we've had is LN, which is clunky as hell and makes BTC even less noob-friendly imho.

I'm starting to think adoption is much further away than many people think, and that we will make much lower lows (sub 6k) before that happens. 



Alright, let's hear how *this* movement is actually *bearish*. Ripping through $8800 was surely a sign that the worst is yet to come.
I feel pretty bad for chewy for closing his short at 8700\+

Not because of the money, I'm aware it's peanuts in the grand scheme. But I know how much that hurts. Happened to me yesterday when I closed my long from 8250 at 8350 and watched it pump. Felt pretty damn stupid thinking "Why in gods name would you close right before Conensus"?

Was debating all day yesterday to short and thought that if we make it to 8700\+, it's a bad idea. Well, it would have been an excellent idea. Going to take a break from trading with this chop. It's brutal. We're just barting around like no tomorrow.
Oh yes Oh yes! Somebody give me a bro fist.

Humor aside, when I posted [this prediction](https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8j9i8m/daily_discussion_monday_may_14_2018/dyyajqz/) a few hours ago, it clearly failed to entertain some of the redditors of this sub, I learnt my lesson!

My predictions were based on the current price movements, which largely resembles to that of the period between 7th - 12th Apr and other factors, however, lets not get into the details. It is history now.

All the best to everyone, I do not think I will be making anymore predictions here, apart from taking part in the daily discussions by providing my input wherever I can and by seeking advises when I need them. But in no way I am going to post any of my observations/predictions moving forward. :)

The only thing I want to say to fellow traders is that be a leader, not a follower, be a learner, not a knower. It doesn't take a hawk's eye to see price patterns, with enough attention, anyone of us can spot them and make winning trades with the right actions. I spotted the price patterns, decided to double up my stack and I am happy with my decision.

Those who lost part of their stacks, I pray they make double the amount they lost as soon as possible, and those who won, keep it up, you are doing a great job!

As for my long from $8,402, I am riding it not planning to close in near future. Cheers!
We should make Bitcoinmarkets T-Shirts and Hoodies. Would you guys be interested in discussing designs? I’ll organize the merch and ship ‘em out if we get enough peeps.

On second thought, let’s just design the logo and everyone can order the shirt themselves, so you don’t have to give me your address. But if you want to just order it, ill do it

Maybe the new logo?

Edit: Ok, I’ll start a new thread for it

Seeing a lot bullish news pop up... ~~ETH not a security~~ (source needed), CME launching a price reference rate for ETH (no futures yet though), Goldman Sachs launching futures for BTC. Florida accepting BTC for taxes lol, the FED dude being rather positive. The dump earlier today and the pump feel a bit manipulated so I'm staying out of position for now. Closed my entire short from 9800. 
ok, I'm bullish again. Carry on.
Going to have a good laugh if we are back at 8400 in a couple hours
Going all in today. I might be wrong, but to me the bear pennant seems less relevant seeing as we just went up just hours before we turned down.  Expecting a modest bounce to 8600, but if it fails to materialize will pull out by later today. Edit: I've checked the charts, and we are not in oversold nor overbought territory as far as I can see. I agree with the view that we are going down eventually, but from what I see right now, there's room for revisiting the 8600 region today. Stops at 8330.

Lift on sports gambling is HUGE 
This latest development with sports betting becoming legalized in the US is something that is tangibly bullish for the long term:

>The Supreme Court cleared the way on Monday for states to legalize sports betting, striking down a 1992 federal law that had prohibited most states from authorizing sports betting. The 6-3 ruling is a victory for New Jersey and other states who have considered allowing sports gambling as a way to encourage tourism and tax revenue. 

The betting industry in general is well positioned to be disrupted by crypto from different perspectives, both in terms of the platforms used (for example cryptographic betting platforms that ensure transparency and public tracability of internal odds) and also as a payment method to avoid oversight and increase speed/security. Gambling also seems to be a natural fit for crypto ownership, hell most of us here are really engaging in educated gambling by trying to predict market movements. There was a point where half the transactions on the bitcoin network in the early stage were being used to transmit bets to SatoshiDice, one of the earliest bitcoin betting sites.

What I would really love to find is some indication of what percentage of online sports betting is done in Bitcoin currently. I've searched to find a source and can't find anything substantial, unsurprising since its so new. What would your guess be for the total % of bets placed being in Bitcoin for sports bookies?

5/14/18 UPDATE. Things have been crazy at the office, so I’m a little more removed from the markets than I’d like to be. I don’t have a forecast on where we are going, but I promise I will put one together within the next 48 hours. My last update was technically on [5/10/18]( https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ic411/daily_discussion_thursday_may_10_2018/dyrd7oa/), but the last real update I did was on [4/25/18]( https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8eqr52/daily_discussion_wednesday_april_25_2018/dxyoabr/). In the meantime, I’ve cleaned up some of my charts and have a thought where we might be heading in the ultra-short term…

Here are the charts:     
Here’s the [macro view](https://www.tradingview.com/x/hbx7RMrb/).     
Here’s the [new channel](https://www.tradingview.com/x/3RqYyD54/).     
Here’s the [super zoomed in view](https://www.tradingview.com/x/V5enyKGK/).     

I believe we’re in a small downward channel, which is indicated in black on the charts. Possible sources of resistance are the pink and gold lines within the channel. The pink line is drawn from the ATH to the peak where we blew off the top on 4/25. Further, the gold line is drawn from a top on 4/30, 5/3 and 5/13 20:00:00 UTC. Per the chart, I will be buying in the $8,060-$7,975 range and offloading towards the top of the second bounce up (if it appears). Further, if we decisively blast through the black resistance along with the pink and gold lines — that would be very bullish.

How does one quantify the distance between top and bottom B bands? What is that difference called? My arms are getting tired of holding a ruler up to my computer screen.

Wow now this is a bounce!!
Look at those 5min candles!
Pretty sure the recent barts are a consequence of Bitmex having higher volumes than the 'reference' spot exchanges. Could be a trivial enough task for a group of whales to load up massive positions on Bitmex, then push the price whichever way they need it to go on spot to collect juicy profits.

Out of my short from last night. Got extremely lucky that June futures lagged that spike, and mashed market close at 8480ish and got out at 8495 when swaps were pushing 8600 [as mentioned here](https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8j9i8m/daily_discussion_monday_may_14_2018/dyyj5f7/).

I'm not touching this for a little bit. This is madness. 

!short xbtusd close 8495
Back to bart eating shorts now?
This battle over 8750 on gdax is nuts.  WTF is this day?
Flag broke up, dumped into the flag again, flag broke down.

I bet the next step is pump into the flag again and sideways till tomorrow! 
This is really exciting... we didn’t Bart yet which is weird so do you go long here or is it a time delayed bart?
Held onto my short that I opened at 8375 but had a much more unpleasant and glued to the screen weekend than I wanted, so I still paid for it.
Day One. Consensus. It begins.

The world is changing and some are squabbling over $400 in either direction. Enjoy the rat race, but it's small potatoes relative to where we're headed over the next 25 years.

Can't wait. See everyone tonight!
What a surprise to wake to. Held my long from 8350, closed it for almost no profit.

Going to take a break from the screens for a day or two. Good luck to you all!


100-day MA + log-downtrend right above us, let's see how this will go. I really have not the slightest clue. I have lost all sense of direction from the recent movements.

If the bulls can keep up this momentum, we’ll close the day with a green candle 

Edit:  guess we don’t want to close green. So close...

FedEx is extremely bullish on Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto. They unveiled a bluetooth tracking device that will eventually integrate with crypto and ensure trustless delivery of goods.
Told you.
This may be dumb, but I had a 25% stack increase on my short last night and this looks like a bart, not a bull flag. 

!short XBTUSD 8750 10X 25%

edit: entry was at 8810 on June futures. Stops up a couple percent.

edit 2: Wanted to post it in case it moved quickly and I looked like a hindsight trader. I'm basically just playing with the profits from my short last night, and I'm willing to take a small hit on them considering I was gifted a much better exit than I should have been. I would not be surprised by a huge movement in either direction here, but *traditionally* these huge 15m candles retrace slightly if not significantly. BTC loves maximum pain and a test of 8500-8600 seem plausible. 

edit 3: Closed at 8800 (8860 on June futures). No thank you BTC.
With the massive amount of resistance above us at $8,800, this would potentially be an attractive place to make a big buy. Think about it, slippage is your worst enemy so you'd want to pick a place where you can expect a lot of sell pressure. I do not know what the price will do from here, but thought this was worth mentioning.

edit: interesting...
I’m all in instar and this shit hurts.
Sl hit during the night, time to reassess things. Will probably reopen around 8450.

!short XBTUSD close 8400
when we broke above 9200 a few weeks ago I have been buying back in. am up to 50% in and will be adding on dips. 

will profit take around 12k and 17k before adding big if 20k is broke.

On the down side I will start cutting losses if we break below 7500 
Holding through up and down I just stopped believing in move up.

We broke down a wedge, now we're in clear bear flag that started on our drop from 8.7.

I knew I'm gonna regret not flipping this position at 8.7 and I do.

Flipped for a small loss.

EDIT: yeah, right before that move up...
Closed my short at a loss and opened a long to ride this BGD. Someone just market bought 5k of BTC so I don’t think this is going down anytime soon.
I'm playing around with trying to apply some Wyckoff logic to what's happening at the moment. It looks like some serious accumulation is happening by some big player(s)...

Would it make sense that 9.4 down to ~8.6k was the mark-down phase from distribution to accumulation again? Or perhaps we're in re-distribution right now, to be followed by another leg down for accumulation again?

Something like this: https://www.tradingview.com/x/frcJp7x1/

Paging /u/SloppySynapses :)


Expecting a push down after hitting a certain line several hours from now.  I see it premature.  Its like trying to work an ill person to work hard.  An ill person needs rest before he recovers completely.
What is a BGD?
It i wanted this I'd buy bonds. /whine
Again exited fully to fiat at essentially break even when accounting for fees. Failed to maintain 8.8k and topped out at the downtrend resistance; don't want to take a loss here and I'm still biased bearish short term.

!long ethusd close 720

Edit: God damnit, /u/justanotherlogin, I suck at posting positions on mobile. Should be 720.
Quite a precarious test of that pennant it broke out of.  https://imgur.com/Ix7gehF (edit, with centerline)

Could be a double fake out and make a big move (either direction is faking out at this point).  Or maybe its just going sideways into a drunken bull flag on the 1hr~30min.  
Everyone's seems bearish here. I'm bullish. Even though the charts look rather bearish. I've got tight stops thats for sure.

Stealthy creeps here we go.
Is anyone letting their long from 8350-ish ride? Seems to me like we will bart back down to 8200+ in the next 12 hours.

I can’t imagine whever is doing this isn’t making a killing
These moves don't make any sense to me. That's why I HODL. My trades are almost all just to rebalance my overall portfolio.

Interesting little report by etoro here: [https://www.etoro.com/blog/from\-the\-markets/who\-are\-the\-crypto\-investors/](https://www.etoro.com/blog/from-the-markets/who-are-the-crypto-investors/)

Notice the traders' experience level data.
That was a lovely pump, would be a shame for it to 'fall over'

(sad italian music)
The hostility on here is at all time high. I took a long position @$8350 with a target of 10.2k and got downvoted into oblivion
everyone is now expecting it to bart (myself included) which is why it somehow will not.

edit: nevermind, here it comes.  longs were very trolled by the BGD today *sigh*
The last two times I started to feel slightly bullish, we dumped hard from 11.7k and 9.9k.

We probably just topped out now too.

This market is so annoying. Wake me up at $12k please, I wish I could just forget about crypto until then.
Or sideways, but generally speaking, that is what markets do..
Looks like we found support on, and then bounced upwards from the 50-day MA again? (orange line)

 With Consensus going on and a move like this \- seemingly out of the blue,  no real resistance lines broken or anything of the sort \- one must consider the potential that some sort of news has broken, no? I know this isn't a *totally crazy* move for BTC, but I think the possibility should be considered.  
!long xbtusd close 8725
This is a tough one to call. Opened a short and a long last night - short got stopped out at 8.5 - I'm mildly in profit now. Now the question is whether to reshort or hold the long. Wary that this might just be some major stop hunting.
[deleted]
Move up more and some bears be under water but more will be at the liq shop.

Bart up and down is quite fun :D For some.
I swear I always choose wrong when it comes to taking profits or holding a position, but then again I guess having some profit is better than having no profit
Bot is down, but I closed my short at 8777, and managed to get long at 8798.  10x, 100% of my stack.

Our pennant broke up, so I'd expect us to rise the length of the pole (about $500).  Should we get there, I'll be closing half of my long at 9150.  The other half will ride in case we want to make another run at 10k.  If this ends up being a fakeout, I have my stops set at B/E.

The major hurdles I see ahead are the downtrend line from 10k, which is just overhead at ~8915.  Then there's 9200, which has served as both solid support and resistance in the past.  Good luck out there everybody.
Minor rejection off that downtrend line. 

Let's see what happens.
Bounced heavy from the res line with a 2h shooting star. But on the other hand we have still this descending broadening wedge on the 12h.

The mid\-term RSIs \(4h and 6h\) have recovered, so we might test the support line of this wedge which would be around 7.3k right now \(adding the time it would take to get down\) and would be perfectly in line with the possible large scale pennant. I doubt we complete these patterns so perfectly, it would be too simple for Bitcoin.
Looks like UpBit was cleared of any wrongdoing.

Weekly View - https://www.tradingview.com/x/hRzuoBjT/

We hit the middle BBANDS but didn't pierce it. BBANDS have a few general guidelines. Once you close candles outside them and then close back within the BBANDS price tends to return to the mean of that BBANDs (more common and accurate with higher time frames obviously). If they pieces the mean and trade below and that closing below then they tend to do the opposite (meaning a close outside of the weekly BBANDS which would put us in 5Ks at the moment. Doesn't have to work this way but it's a common way to use bbands.

Daily View - https://www.tradingview.com/x/1CIltY9w/

OBV looks like it may develop a bearish div so maybe something to keep an eye on. Out largest volume node below us is 8K which we would likely fill in some of the volume profile. The ichimoku is in the (green!) cloud but it looks like it about to TK cross bearish which usually isn't great. I use the TDI along with Ichi to try and pick up some really high probability trades and at the moment most of it seems to be in consolidation with odd breakouts but hitting resistance everytime. TDI is showing a red 8 but wont finish a 9 count which isn't exactly bullish because it generally means the bearish momentum hasn't been totally exhausted so I think we may have seen the extent to the cool off period that that system gives already. We have HVN nodes above us with horizontal resistance so it's a tough battle upwards. Coupled with the the cloud is kind of a consolidation area I can see it price flipping until there's enough room on the momentum indicators to take us down.

In terms of TD trades you have the 1/2 hour being possible setups although there's resistance from a bullish cloud beneath. 3 day is in the second candle of a bearish countdown but it could price flip if we continue up a little more but the 1 day should give you a relief bounce unless we break below 8200. Then all bets are off. A bullish case there I would guess is a strong bounce in the 72-500 range that will look like a real bottom but I'm not holding my hope for anything great there but maybe I'm overly bearish so lets wait to see how ti turns out)

IMO it's bullish long term for bitcoin to go through a slightly larger and I think the earlier we test the lower resistance the healthier the recovery will be(5K minimum IMO). I can see if we bounce go sideways for a long time people will be disinterested but then that's when really smart money looks at it again when all the hype is gone(but not buried).  If we go below 5K I can see despair kicking in at 4K and a massive capitulation drop which could really accelerate selling amongst people who invested mid last year that may need the cash(granted most of these people are not going to move the market) 

It makes people much wiser to market mechanics and a bunch of techies are generally(probably - I'm generalizing) not the best when it comes economics and the marketsplace and complexity within financial institutions outside of the actual bitcoin community so it's a good reality check (especially when the community can be said to be in somehwat it's own bubble with virtually every sub like r/btc and r/bitcoin being a massive circlejerk. When you trade you come face to face with something you initially don't understand about bitcoin because the fundamentals pretty much say that it should only ever going to go up (giving that it is accepted as value). 

So I think fundamental understanding (and there's a lot of people who think they know a lot about btc and blockchains but a lot are jumping on the hype train) can sometimes cloud our thinking. Especially if you spent 6 years non stop reading on bitcoin. A lot of the hype is BS but there is a really interesting tech there that could be revolutionary. You even see it with traders who make a killing on the way up then we go up 100% in a few days crash 50% and they're still calling for 100K, like chill dude these things take time...

Of course your gonna believe it's an obvious choice to be a global 'currency'. Rest of the market (ESP Wall St) don't give a shit about BTC itself they are trading to make $ and to have a foot in the door in-case the some real applications come to BTC beyond what it is now.. Im bearish until 10K+ and would like to see some really strong direction from BTC to put too much on a trade. At 10K I'm cautiously bullish(providing no OBV divergences or any other massive diverences) until 11.7.

Best decision here would be pick a trading system and just wait for buy or sells based on ones that work for you. Like Ichi + TDI + RSI and of course some SMAs such as 50,100/128,200 is pretty good if you get them both(TDI+Ichi) lined up for perfect entries with MA's and RSI to support then you can make some monster trades. You have to be patient but then they come your almost instantly in the money especially if your looking at longer term MAs. I think the trading is going to get mind numblingly boring for a few weeks if we move down below 5K. LEts wait and see
this is getting mighty tight 
Gates stocking up on his Fentanyl and ran outta bitcoin.
To my earlier post, consider for a moment that when we do have real volume which direction does BTC move? This is by no means meant as a "victory lap" - I am not anywhere that naive - rather a point of reference for consideration. Nothing more.

I think the most worrying thing is that there is no attempt to hide what is going on. There is no serenading the normal people while you scrape off profits little by little. This is straight up smash and grab which is going to put off a lot of people, old and new.

This is a short sighted play in my opinion.

!short XBTUSD 8850 5X 30%
Bitcoin faced major resistance last week around $9600, and like mentioned in my previous report, we are retesting the 8k zone.

When we look at the indicators on the 4hr candle chart we can see that the bullish momentum is building up in the market again, however there is a ton of resistance above $8600 – $8800. The bulls have a lot of work to do to get us through this ceiling, but with the right price action it sure is possible on the shorter term.

I can see quite a bit of bearish talk on the candlestick patterns, as well as a possibility that a new longer term bearish trend has emerged. If this is the case I would expect the support level around $8000, short term, to get tested again, and $7100 could be on the cards should the above mentioned fail.

Best case scenario here in my opinion would be some sideways trading for the Bitcoin USD pair, between $8000 and $8800. This will be quite a healthy correction in my opinion and necessary if we expect a break above $9600 to test the illusive 10k barrier.

Please remember this is crypto and anything can happen, be prepared, bulls and bears will battle it out this week. Safe trades

Got a short in @8750. Stops above 8830. This is retardation in its final form if this doesn't retrace to at least 8600. 
buying 8300,  there's trendline support and horizontal support.   If this area holds, it's a huge win for the bulls.  
I think this is a bull trap. We visited $8300 too many times, and the only thing preventing us from going lower is a massive buy wall. 

seems to me some whale is unloading in this range, and the big green candles is him pumping us back up, and then the big red candles is him selling after waiting for some buy orders to get put up above his walls 
whens this ponzicoin finally gonna crash

Cautiously starting to add to my stack here. Some very minor buy orders already triggered on the dump, but bigger orders are in the 7.6k-7,8k area to beef up my stack again. Our previous support trend is somewhere near 7.8-7.9k currently, Bearflag target is about 7.65k.
Moved my stop on my 8.65 long from Friday to just above break-even. Looking to close at 9.5 sometime later this week.
Welcome to the coin flip markets.  
Kind of seems like we've just seen a bearflag breakdown try to be painted but market isn't believing it. Sell volume on decline.

4hr close above 8400 would be good for bools. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/2qUWnVlw/
I'm surprised how static the price seems. Had a slight surge yesterday which quickly came back to the pre surge level. And here we are again.

If you do think we would go lower, who exactly would be selling at these levels? People who bought in run from 8000ish to 9900ish? Perhaps if we hit 7500ish these individuals would be looking to exit, but any further and we are back to the lowest dip level.

Anyway that's just my thinking. I was long from 8630, scaled into a larger position at 8430, 8550 and then sold on the surge at 8720. And now I'm long again from 8390.
I did some scraping with alts earlier, but now I'm concerned to jump back or tether. buys and sells are both anemic. order books are so thin. And I think the entity that shot that BGD has no more ammunition for today. 

IMO BTC keeps finding higher lows. Yesterday it was 8200, today it was 8300. Creeping back to the top with a little help from Mr. Green. Credits goes to u/TheEchonomist for that term. 

Coinbase now at >20M users. Scarcity.
This isn't how bull runs start, we might see 9.2k but doubtful. Be skeptical. I for one find bgd bearish overall.
!short xbtusd 8750 5x 100% 

R:R seems good from here if this recent action is gonna continue its up and down repetition. 

Fully expecting it to go to 10k now. 
I would like to send a couple of coins to people who have no accounts or the slightest idea what bitcoin is or what the blockchain is.  They need an account at the exchange I send it from?  Coinbase is where the coins are. Any help would be appreciated. 
Futures premium non-existent. Opened a long on fut and shorted swaps. Advice on stops? I'm thinking 8.15 and 8.5 respectively, keeping it tight - thoughts?
I wasn't really sure of the significance of this line (Daily close from ATH), but been keeping an eye on it ever since it traced the resistance of the pennant we broke up from on 3-May.  Looks like we're up against it again.

https://imgur.com/a/j3gBw2t
The only thing I can find now is we about to break 4hr tight Bollinger Bands. 
I have been trying to catch all dips recently, so now I will short from 8740 and of course it will pump to  9200 quite fast.

But on the other hand my favorite 3h ma cross formed here https://www.tradingview.com/x/rWhkqWBC so I might just back out. Never trade hungry and unprepared is the lesson here lol
I'm long from 8350 (after having set a hedge short at the same price that got stopped out at 8.5) and am thinking about opening a hedge short on swaps here - advice on stops? (In both directions?) 

I'm thinking long stops at 8.6 and short stops at 8.9.
Wow it has shot up a good bit. So is it time for it head back down for a few hours? You guys gonna be shorting?
Anyone else thinking about hopping into a long? $8,800 was convincingly broken and I could definitely see us retesting $9,200 support turned resistance
Interesting development. Think I'll move stops on my 8835 hedge short to break even at this point.
Seems like we could just be in a giant descending wedge on the 4H 

I’m not sure if it’s valid, but it’s something I’ll low key be keeping an eye out on 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/hEMwSJqE/

The bottom of the wedge would put us around $7,800 which would be a good R/R for a long with a target of around $8,200-8,300 for a breakout 
textbook fakeout/dead cat bounce. wont break critical 8900$ resistance. it will sooner be $7000 than $9000
I think I will start scaling in some shorts now, Consensus is basically here, and some good news may push us up a little further in the short\-term, but imo this shipping is sinking again.

Going to add a little short here and will keep adding to it if we rise further unless we see some crazy news.

Bitcoin and alts \(especially alts\) have been pumping hard leading up to this, and i cant see there being much more room after this event. Fully expecting bitcoin and alts to drop like flies by the end of this, but it won't be the first time i've eaten my words so don't use this as trading advice, just giving my opinion.
It looks like a HUGE diverging triangle from ATH in December. So it looks like it could go down to 7200 mid term and then BGD up to ATH before end of year
[deleted]
Well, I'm bearish, waiting on 7600-8100. You know what this means ...
Looks like we are back in the ascending channel from 12 May. I have a long opened in June futures and will be scalping from the top with swaps.
[removed]
Time for the Big Dumper to pay the piper and cover. What was this about a "bear market" that so many in here were discussing during the Friday's weak little dip?

Or maybe you guys are thinking this is a bull trap or fakeout. No. Bears are getting gored.
Oh, is that what we're gonna do today, we're gonna consolidate +/- 100 all day?
Damn it, I think there is a case to be made for a 2014-16 sad time market; getting to 9.2 then falling down below 5.5k would like allot like 2014

If we retest 9.2 and it goes shit; cri

Looking at a week candle chart and macd, july 6 2014
lol, opened up a short as a hedge @ 8400 (in Yen equivalent) for my underwater longs - never been happier to see the price jump up 4% within minutes :p

EDIT: Underwater Longs
well looks like its back to the $8400 range, which means we should be testing $8000 sooner rather than later. 
this feels like the early december rally, albeit a slow-mo version. alts and btc spiking up from nowhere. i remember LTC was the first one to radically surge from the top coins, then loses steam, then the spikes go to the other coins. or maybe i'm just reminiscing the good ol' days. 
Price is my new friend. As said yesterday, it only wants to go up (at least from my observations). Someone somewhere (Let's call him/them Mr. Green) is doing all in it's power to keep the price stable and also keep increasing it. I strongly doubt there's anybody else more powerful than Mr. Green at the moment.

The occasional sell-offs we are seeing in the past 24 hours or so are the people who are convinced that the price is going to go down. I was convinced too before I actually figured out where the price wants to go. For these traders, they have all their reasons to believe in this case and I fully respect their opinions.

You might also have noticed that as soon as the price starts to go down, we hardly see any buys. Only when there is a small break and the sellers cools a bit, we see price moving back upwards very quickly. I will never challenge this price movement, I do not want to go against it, I want to go with it. 

We have also noticed low volume price growth, which is no different to that of the last months growth. Furthermore, the price is behaving the same way it did last time we were in $8,000 range heading to $9,000 in our rally last month.

My prediction is that, we might see another increase in price today, we might not but the chances are high that we will and we might revisit $8,700 range, perhaps we make a new high today above $8,800. I am not so sure how many shorts are opened at the moment and what is the ratio. But in the mid-term, I can see the price going up, once we cross major resistance levels if we are able to, I can also see the possibility of short squeeze (only above $9,500 range and not too soon either), this could also help fuel the prices and we might see another BGD that might look like that of 12th April. This BGD has very high chances of clearing $10,000. 

In bearish case, if the sellers somehow manage to overcome Mr. Green and revisit $8,200, it is highly likely that they will not be able to plummet through it, or being the ultimate wall $8,000.

Pardon if this doesn't sound right to some of you. This is my prediction based on the calculation of the probabilities, and also taking into consideration the price movements between 7th - 12th April and comparing them to the ones we are currently experiencing. Of course there is also probability that I could be wrong, just like the wrong long that I opened yesterday at $8,652 which stopped at $8,540. I am now long again from $8,402. 

If you have something else in your mind, perhaps some productive feedback, I would love to hear. Cheers! :)


I guess it's time to move over and let the big boys play for a bit. I'll jump in when the absurdity subsides. 

!short xbtusd close 8600
There seems to be a [broadening bottom](https://www.tradingview.com/x/iae9IaOh) right now of that what looks somewhat like a bearflag. 

My bet is that we will bounce off that edge and slowbleed until the next spike in volume.
Could someone please explain to me why the Bitcoin Futures is actually not suppressing the price?  IF they are cash settled then doesn't that just mean they are placing bets - like gambling?  How could that affect the price?  Id imagine the only way to control the price through futures would be to have a ton of physical bitcoin or to buy it, and buy/sell according to what direction you want the price to go.  
This magically always happens at 5:00pm cst 
Kind of a brain damaged Bart forming. Wouldn't short it, but you do you.
That was a beautiful bear trap. I missed the action this week end and was just waiting to buy this dip. Clearly I wasn't alone.  
Alrighty, since we've quite clearly reversed, time for some new levels.

first resistance is resistance line from symmetrical pennant a week or two ago at about 8.8k. Then we have the resistance line from our downtrend at 8.95k and last support probably turned resistance at 9.1k. 

Before I get all bulltard again, we have to see where this inverted Bart will land. Second, a word of warning, this might be a deliberate FOMO pump & dump for consensus to suck the amateur traders in. I'd use tight stops during and around the end of the event in case of a dump. this all seems a bit too good to be legit to me. 

Goodluck and sorry shorts :(
I'm not at all sure what that was supposed to accomplish. Maybe it is to get the bulls excited again? I feel like anyone who just bought at 8.4 would easily sell now for a nice profit. The markets are just so illiquid that a move like that could just be a fat finger and won't have a long term impact on the price. Well, it could. But that requires going sideways here for enough time that sentiment changes and you're not just in a bull trap.

tl,dr; don't fomo. Wait to see the long term reaction from this move.
FYI: 44k btc were moved from the gox wallet.
https://www.cryptoground.com/mtgox-cold-wallet-monitor/

 Edit: it is "just" 28k btc 28k bch

As pointed out, the transactions are a couple days old.
[deleted]
there still is no need to be upset.
Urgh, i should cut my losses (avg 7.5k € entry)

But it hardly affects my total profits at this point.

But a 6k revisit seems much more likely, providing a much better buy oppertunity for long term.

Can't decide here tbh

!long btcusd 8529 1x 90%

prob gonna add if there is a temp retrace. this is gonna go higher after such an enthusiastic start. any news from Consensus?
Wow.. I feel so powerless :( 
How can one possibly expect this pump using TA.. :(

It may still head back down, but the Bulls are doing a great job maintaining 8800+ so far. I was expecting a strong rejection if we didn't clear 8900 resistance. Looks like we're taking the stairs. Decent volume on that BGD as well. Hopefully we see some continuation here and paint another Bull Flag.

Edit: I should never post again.
Am I crazy to think the 4h chart is now showing a fully-formed Eve & Adam double-bottom?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/SzrXdRaS/

That would place the target price around 9300.
BTC price broke down but there is room for revisiting higher 8000s before finally going down, judging from the RSI on various time scales.

!long xbtusd 8443 1x 20%
!long xbtusd 8327 1x 50% stop 8200
!short xbtusd 8394 5x 100% stop 8502
Does anyone here really think BTC now forms part of most investors ‘long term’ strategy, or is BTC now just being shorted to death...?
Consensus seems to be clear longs are closing now, shorts increasing. There was no reason for this BGD. Down we go.
so 10 minutes before consensus starts we get this.  

Whale heard everything he needed to in a pre mixer? 

A fakeout stop hunter?

thoughts?
Is anybody seeing this as a potential bounce off the long term linear trend line that started back around July 15th ($2k price) ? I know, meh linear trend line but still.

Edit: see chart here, maybe some confusion on what I was saying:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/yq8fsmXP/


Stopped out (by choice) of my long at 8.65 at a tiny gain. Looking to buy again soon with a bit of lev since it's lunch money. If we drop, I buy back what I lose so kinda can't lose. Looking to enter long at $8500.
Transactions taking forever! 2+ hours. I needs me BTC.
Volume in those recent weeks tells a very clear story. Halfwits willing to sell a revolution for mediocre short-term profits are running out of coins. Chart of course still looks like a bear market, so buyers are still waiting hoping to get in at lower prices, but sooner rather than later they will start realising there are no more idiots dumb enough to sell that low and we'll move towards a more reasonable price range.
Fell asleep as I was setting my stops 2 hours ago. Was up 4% profit.

Just woke up 2 minutes ago  to fucking $8,800 and I’m now underwater? 

This is so fucking irritating. BTC officially makes no sense anymore 
This could be it..check out zcash..went bonkers in few minutes..I put zcash in BTC ETH category

I made my first trade here today, but I now noticed I messed up the syntax and it registered my SL price as an entry price (https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8j9i8m/daily_discussion_monday_may_14_2018/dyyahyn/). Is there a way of correcting it?
[deleted]
Has anyone seen this cloud-based trading bot?

https://www.cryptotrader.tax/trading/crypto-trading-bots-an-introduction-to-cryptohopper-how-it-works/
I seriously lucked out today. I generally trade counter-trend too often, selling ETH last night at $730 and buying back at $710, hoping to ride it to the top of the bear flag before selling again. I got stubborn when it started dropping, and decided to hold despite my losses, hoping it would pump at the start of consensus. The BGD saved me big time.

Anyway, the market is looking pretty strong all of a sudden, with volume slowly increasing and alt ratios recovering. I also doubt a $400 BGD would be formed just to be sold into. If BTC can push past this heavy resistance around $8800-8900, we may be looking at a bullish couple of days ahead. I’m crossing my fingers at least, considering I’m still long from below.
I'm betting the legalization of sports betting throughout the US will put strong downward pressure on crypto prices over time.

bull flag incoming
I think I found the reason for the pump. 

Supreme court lifts ban on sports wagering.

My analysis in a nutshell: If we can't hold here, we're going to 7800. If we continue falling from there, we are going to 7250. If we fall from there, all bets are off and goblintown awaits. Though if we do find support on any of these levels I think there will be considerable upside. Past 10k and retest 12k at least.

Does short-bus have another LRD dump in him? Sure hope so. Still looking for that 8.5 long entry.
Conference is over within a day and price is only dumping lololol. Hasn't looked this bad for bitcoin since announcement of mtgox hack 5 years ago lololo
am i the only one who read this in a deep baritone black man's voice?
>There will then come a point in time when the period of accumulation has reached a point of saturation and the price for BTC will then rise and – for me – will rise both quickly and unexpectedly.

This is why I've stopped trying to time the market, and I'm just holding on to my coins now. I can no longer time or predict the market with any sort of accuracy, because at this point there is too much potential good news and bad news waiting to arise. The hardest thing for me is going to be dealing with the regret in price drops, not because I'd be in the red, but because I could have bought \*more\* bitcoin with the same amount of USD. As far as risk:reward goes, right now it's too risky not to have any bitcoin \(from my own personal assessment which I do not intend to imply that anyone else should feel the same. Look around you, draw your own conclusions\).  
>What needs to be accepted is the fact that far better equipped and resourced institutional participants have entered the fray. Make no mistake.

There's absolutely no doubt about that. And I too noticed the managed downward pressure you're talking about. It suddenly stops when the price dips a little too much, it's very controlled, the buy side too.

However I don't think you can put all the big players in one category. Some are here to make quick money from the huge volatility (aka pumping & dumping). It's all a little more complex than that, but you're certainly not wrong.
I hope you're right sir! 
great write up, and I could not agree more
Great read and agreed on the effect of new and better equipped market participants on TA. It is the reason I've stopped trading intraday and focus almost exclusively on the +1D charts.

Thank you.
Just in case you missed this yesterday, I've been seeing something kind of similar. Really great write up, man kudos.

Did you talk crypto to him?
> buy the rumor

I think the whole market forgot about this part.
That’s pretty cool!
Thing is... nobody bought the rumor
Sounds familiar hahaha. 

I FOMOed in at 17K, so I have no option but to hodl and wait. 
You decided? :)
It could be worse, my altfolio went from $100k to $5k haha. 
I bought at $33, but have had many buys and sells since then.   The most recent was a long at $9500.

Still not rich.
Well not really, this was the second attempt on 8800 resistance from yesterday only with more volume
Or long term
It’s a crap shoot at this stage no matter what anyone says. I even think the odds of success are against most of us. 
Damn, you are out of luck. 
>While a pump to $8,500 is possible (perhaps even likely), I'd rather get in early than have to wait for a breakdown and for Bitmex's servers to make it impossible to get into a decent position.


The new classical type of metatrading, trading before servers crash instead of markets crash
I got stopped out on my short a decent amount below where you manually closed, and I actually re-opened right about where you closed. I was glued to the charts last night, and I definitely felt for you--been there many times. I'm trying to remain patient with my position. Largest I've ever had--full stack 10x short from 8680 (June futures entry). 
cosmic poetry that is 
Which traders on Twitter are you referring to?
[deleted]
Very similar to the chart I've been using, although you're using a straight line rather than Log linear regression.

It's very interesting that we appear to be in a massive falling wedge from the ATH on the 1D, 1W and 1M charts (which happens to meet *just* above the aforementioned log line)
yep this is exactly my feelings of the market as well. we're in a super critical period where we can break down or break up in the next month or two. god i hope this is a repeat of 2013 and not 2014-15.
thans man!
so do you have a wiki or faq for bot somewhere? have you considered adding time element to your bot? like closing bot against market after certain time if specified on comment and calculate roi against market. how about number element? maybe initialize some account with 1000 tokens on database or even better initialize erc20 token on testnet to track how they do over time. you might be on to something here since you already seem to have decent following
This is fantastic. Thanks for taking the time to write this up. 

If we drop below $7.8k, do you think there's any meaningful support near $7.5k? If not, is it because the BGD from 4/12 didn't allow any time to consolidate at that level there?
!short XBTUSD close 9600

Really annoyed I missed the flag breakup due to no hard stop buys set and my morning commute. But what can ya do.
I'm sorry chewy. It's like they're watching us now.
Why pick now as opposed to when it broke below the previous bull flag? Is it that the movement back up from 8600 which lost steam at 8680 was a confirmation to you?

Edit: so much for losing steam.
Do you ever feel like you're being watched by Bogdanov? I can't help but feel like the timing was too perfect.

To clarify I'm still keeping my short open, but damn. 

Why not at 8800+ after the bgd? 

I opened a short at 8700 just before the bgd, 5 hours of trading only to close at a $10 gain after fees. 
The daily closed undecided but as we're crawling back into the bbands we might be attracted to the middle here, which would roughly coincide with the 9.2 target I have in mind, good luck tho
Bot is working again. You can send the commands by PM or set them here in a comment. If you open a wrong position just send a delete command and PM the command again.
I'm pretty bullish but I think this a safe play.  What's your target to the downside?
does this formation of the last few days look like a bear flag with a false breakdown to 8400 to you? and now we are back in the flag pattern ignoring that breakdown? 
Why does anyone think this will pump BTC? I see 0 btc events

Wow, I'm glad I'm not going to Consensus this year.
Yeah as /u/L14dy mentioned before, this probably isn't the best entry for a short, probably want to wait for the top of the bear flag to open one. If anything a scalp long here is probably a better bet. 
I think chopping around 8.3k to 8.8k is most likely until the end of Consensus, there's too much uncertainty right now, people are just waiting to act on something.
Good question.  But one thing I think is that if it's going to rocket up, it'll be from 8200 or below to get a good round of accumulation, and if the shorts overload.
I think we made multiple attempts to break down through $8,200, whilst only one so far to break upwards through $8,900. 
Just smash that button. Took me about 25 tries to market open my long, which actually saved me about $40/coin. Thanks Arthur!
I’m on the short bus exchange. 

Sorry for your troubles though. :(
I somehow got in after 3 tries. Usually takes at least 20
mind if I ask which country you're in?
what will miners do if the price goes below 8k
So....open 50% long 5x and 50% short 5x and just be patient. Close both in profit over the next 10 days. 

/sarcasm

/sort of
This is what happens when large market moves are singular and performed by institutions that have huge amounts of money to move, and have trading logic that doesn't line up with TA.
Your TA and reasoning is very much appreciated, very much indeed.
It's at this juncture that traders need to decide whether cryptocurrency is a fraud, or the future of finance. Choose and act accordingly.

If you think it's a fraud, get out and stay out. It's only going to BART up and down--but mostly down--right? You'd be a fool to risk a single Shrutebuck on this ponzi. Whales are everywhere, and they're out to eat you!

If the latter, congratulations on your perspective--you're going to be rich if you aren't already. Hold what you've got and invest more during declines. Nothing you haven't heard before.

Stay safe and enjoy the bumpy ride up. 
I gave up looking. Now I just try to guess the price action based on what's going on in this sub. Much more fun that way for being on the sideline.

Edit: looks like another bear trap for another BGD /s /s
we're just plankton for the giant whale asses
the sentiment at these events is always a circle jerk, its a useless indicator for anything 
Trend lines, resistance/support, flags/triangles/wedges, BBands and RSI are my bread and butter. That's pretty much it. 
Personnaly I think Fib retracements are questionable. Draw 5 lines at random points between two values and you'll likely get some that fall on support/resitance areas.
elliot waves are useless, you can justify literally anything with them. That is the case for most TA but if you really look at things objectively, yes, simpler TA seems to help quite a bit
Or was it wave 5 now

[could be the perfect entry, actually](https://prnt.sc/jhlaza).

Someone with alot of cash woke up and startet to hunt bears, total fuckery atm imo
I can't imagine very many people had planned for the last 24 hours of market movement. 
If you're tired of losing, stop selling. Stop using leverage. Buy the dips and never sell. It works. I'm living proof.
Sometimes even a Chewtoy needs to know when to hang up the keyboard and mouse and leave that life behind him.

^^jk
Lol, that would be awful, but Your missteps are few and far between, so I doubt we see you short the bottom again any time soon. 
$8400 got me this morning too. 
why havent I reshorted at 8.8k this was such a nice entry :D

\(touching the res line after a long move is always low risk, because the short\-term RSIs are so oversold already that a retest of the line is likly if we would have gone trhough it\)
Day trading is gambling. Value investing actually has merit.

Still holding my first coin from $10
Well played sir!
yeah, on the short them at least. If you use low leverage and no stops  or trade a lot I guess it's still fine.
agreed, thats why I don't do margin any more

at least without margin you can avoid getting rekt 
you gamble when you take a premature position. this one gave a perfect opportunity to trade after the breakout.
I agree, every move in BTC seems to be artificial and can happen in any direction without any concern for market conditions. Just look at this, this weekend's forced decline, the weeks of barting, etc.

I think we have to complete the A&E and break out over 11.6k before we start to see more predictable trading conditions.
> Anyone who tells me otherwise is lying to themselves.

Right and wrong from my point of view.

When you gamble it's either you win or lose. In trading you can cut your loss 

but yeah I got your point and I'd say it's ok, I was long... :(


Well, to be fair we kind of called this a couple of hours ago...
jesus do you guys really need like every sign to point GO before you make decisions? your profit margins must absolutely be tiny. its like all the people that say, ill open shorts when we confirm the breakdown of 7.8k support or going long when we break 10k. always trying to scrape tiny profits on tail-ends of bull/bear markets.
If you want to know what can propel us down, its this right there. Longs going up as price decreases, meanwhile less volume on exchanges = fewer traders who are fighting over 5-10% moves. General public still expecting their owed riches right around the corner. I don't know why people can be so bullish right now - this market cycle still is not near completion.


Godlike
This was completely expected.

edit: suck on my salty chocolate longs.
This is an inverse marge.
I think these Bart formations _are_ the trading bots ;) Programmed to “fool” as much liquidity out of traders as possible.
I hope so.
While the inverse Barts are perfect for trade bots. 
I was sceptical of the first BGD after the fall, but this second one makes it more believable. This might have a slight pullback, but overall it seems we are going up for a bit. 
im semi bearish but close that dude. when there is no retracement on a pump just above ressitance is specifically when you shoudlnt be sceeptical
Declining volume is a characteristic of pennants/symmetrical triangles. 

This could potentially break out, at least to test the downtrend resistance line. 

What happens next is anyone's guess, if we even get to that point. 

Edit: This could potentially break out as long as there is an expansion of volume when doing so.  
out of curiosity what is your add and market stop set at?
The 30 min bbands should tighten again in about 4 hours so we might see a move then again as they preceded the BGD finalizing the bart formation. We might just meander sideways through to let support beef up first.

Shorts squeeze, followed by your regularly scheduled no volume, no followup, dump.
manipulation
I was just about to post this. A major use case for Bitcoin right now is online sports gambling.

If Americans are pushed more to gambling with cash wouldn't this be a negative? Really weird. 

Good observation and this makes a lot of sense to me.  I'd imagine states that wanted to allow sports gambling would follow the model that takes place in Vegas now.

Curious if this decision would have any long term ramifications to prediction markets like Augur and digital ID platforms like Civic.  
Well, all year long a bear case was argued for in big part due to price being unable to break the log trend line. Price broke above it nearly 4 weeks ago, right now it's still about 20% above that line.

Many bottom bears instantly forgot all about that line for some reason.
If BTC makes some gains soon, could it be considered a cup & handle? 


Edit: or was the BRD too heavy?

I rarely see you charting below the 1h chew, are you getting impatient? 

It looks like we're in a big bear flag with the flag pole beginning  all the way up at 9400.

The resistance is pretty clear but support is hard to draw. Although I feel we will visit that support soon enough.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/JKSxq1Zg/
It was on a rather steep incline, I'm thinking we'll dip below 8.7 here and begin to form a bigger \(broader range\) bull flag

*that, or bart back to 8.3*
What do you think of placing stop short orders around 8625 (and babysitting it), where we're looking for a BRD to bring us back down to 8300's?  Basically keeping the order a good amount away from the current price, looking to catch a big movement that you think is coming but aren't sure which direction?
I've been in and out of the market more than I like the last 3 days, but I'm going to give this one more go. Just entering with the wins from yesterday for now.

That was insane and fast and not followed up on many exchanges
Seems like it was too perfect after all..
What is a BGD?
Bigger than last night's BRD with half the volume. Not a good idea to short right now.
If that isn't some serious surprise buttsecks to all the shorters, I don't know what is.

Hey Chew, did you get out just in time before the BGD? The chart looks pretty stupid, but these things usually start a rally. Where do you think we are going from here?

I beg your pardon, Sir.

Edit: This is obviously good advice. One of the hardest things to do is resist the urge to attempt to swing trade surges like this. 
I'm thinking very similarly.

If you look at the 1D, 1W and 1M charts it looks like we're in a giant year-long falling wedge from the ATH.

The 10k rejection bounced perfectly off the top of the wedge, and a bottom at around 6-7k would also line up perfectly with the wedge bottom.

Could be totally wrong but at least its nice to see I'm not the only one getting these figures.
u should almost never open a long at a local high or a short at a local low in this market recently. Long $8200-8300 and short $9700-9900. Anything else is playing with fire. Unless you plan on adding later 

The trend is just so weak.. This market is a scalpers/trader's market 
Im going to give you the best tip you'll ever have if you want to trade btc. Don't look at anything below 4hr candles. Just watch 4hr, 1d and 1w. The rest is just noise and will make it impossible for you to have a "plan"
A strange game, Professor Falken.

It's to shit on the idea of TA and people who post it while watching it play out 5 minutes later

Lower. 7.5-8k range. Been in sights since friday
[deleted]
Personally, I'd wait for a breakdown of 8300 to add. But that should translate into another leg down. 
Yeah I'm thinking some tomfuckery is going on. Also the buy wall flashing and stuff. I think 8650 won't go down easy, definitely a hidden wall there. 
Yeah, we might be very old or even dead before it's 8.4.  Very true.  I'm feeling the "Bitcoin will never be under $x" vibes. At some point that function always returns true.  Not sure if x=8.4 or 7.8 but it's definitely > than 6.6.
Was like $60... that's no bgd
Sell when RSI is above 70 on all time frames greater than 5m, buy when RSI is below 20-30 on all time frames greater than 5m. Never sell at a loss is a pretty good strategy in this 8-10k range if you ask me

If you just hold a long from 6.6k, I would consider that investing not trading
Depends where and what instruments you trade and how leveraged you are. If I still had my long open from the 6's on BitMex perps, I'd have lost a ton in funding fees.
The only reason I didn't get rekt here is because I now place my stops *before* entering a position.

This pump occurred just as I was placing my stop. I didn't have time to open a short before it became an obviously horrible idea. Had I opened my position first, I'd be furious right now.

Lucky escape.
Over 10% of all shorts have been made in the past couple days - they are about to all be in the red.
The price dropped from close to 10,000 to 8700 in a week.  they doing better than me.

can someone explain what the UP and DOWN contracts do?
We'll see how textbook it is once it hits resistance at $8,900 or so. 

The target for the breakout is somewhere around $9,200ish. 

But there's a strong possibility it'll get smacked down at $8,900:

https://imgur.com/a/0GvM2jF


A bit premature, in my view....
/u/justanotherlogin the bot read this as a short opened at 9085 rather than 8830. I'm assuming I'm supposed to put the stop at the end?

Eth had some good news yesterday regarding some startup making a system for retailers to be able to accept Eth,

https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/05/13/startup-enables-users-pay-ethereum-11-million-locations-like-cash/

Though not directly good for BTC, any crypto adoption decreases barriers for others in the spectrum. 

I'm torn, as I agree with you that adoption has barely changed, though I do think public awareness and the ecosystem around it has grown. However, I don't know if any of these things necessarily have to translate into an increase in price. There's no real catalyst to "hoard" BTC in my opinion. It has a very good ad-hoc use case, int'l transactions etc, but is it enough to validate a 10k pricetag?
LN, Mimble Wimble, Bullet Proofs, Cross Chain Swaps, Schnorr Sigs
I will probably get downvoted for saying this but you are wrong. Adoption is gaining traction, just not for Bitcoin. Projects like iota, ven, icx, neo are getting partnerships left and right and are developing actual products with incredible value. Btc will sadly most likely only serve as a store of value and a house name to crypto, which means its value will derive from investors and speculators and that is not bad, it jusy  
Agreed. We need more users making more transactions and putting a greater share of their wealth into BTC rather than cash or gold or even equities. For that, we need more payment services supporting it, vendors accepting it, clearer laws and regulation, more accountants and tax lawyers who understand it, more brokers making it available as an option, etc. I don't have a reason to think the price will go down, but neither do I see a reason for a surge in demand in the near term. It wouldn't be surprising if it stays range\-bound for months while the speculators drift to altcoins, where there is lots of froth and potential for uptake of some tokens/coins that require less comprehensive infrastructure than BTC.
Sure.

The market should have cleared $8,900 no problem on that breakout. Instead, it bounced off the downtrend line:

https://imgur.com/a/skj4WuB

A failure to continue higher here would mark 3 points of contact for the line, and solidify it as "valid."

I'm not particularly bearish about this small stutter-step here, but if this bounces back down below $8,750 or so, I'd start considering a short again. 
It does reaffirm direction . . maybe buyers will add more to the BGD's efforts now.
Before I went to sleep, just after it pumped to 8700 and chewy closed his short I said I'm gonna regret not closing my long there.

Well, now I'm underwater on my long...
I've also been dicking around in the market making retarded trades. It's damn hard to read atm and entry/exit have to be really timely and tight to make a profit. 

We choppin' too hard for me, I'll just wait for either direction or buy some aggresive dips. 
I also closed a short at 8655, shorted again at 8710 though so it ended up working out. The one time a revenge trade actually worked. I might be addicted to shorting...
I closed my full stack 25x short at 8700 yesterday at the top. Got psyched out by past bgd's. Lesson learned: becareful if there's an instinct to trade 100% of stack on a big move. Dildos are designed to fuck two things, your wallet, and your mind. The latter is always worth more than the former. Didn't have the balls to stomach any more moves up but shouldn't have closed all of it so quickly. 

That said I'm scaling into a long here for a scalp trade. 
sorry to be offtopic but what does "chop" mean?
Well, consensus has not even started yet. This could be a last attempt to force out weak hands and assume better positions for the ride. I actually very much believe this is the scenario.
With the price at these sub 9k levels anything is likely just a good long entry.

8 days ago when we were at 9900 many folks would have killed for 8800 long entries.

Now people are shorting 8800 but longed 9900....

Brilliant minds huh? Just take a moment to absorb what BTC is.... Look at the funds paying attention to it. Don't people understand that any price dips will simply be bought up and put into cold storage? Are the timeframes here really THAT short-term?

Short-term bearish and long term bullish is just such a ridiculous way to think. Shorting bitcoin is honestly one of the riskiest ways to make money. Not that it won't work and I'm sure many folks do well by it but it just isn't a risk I want to take for a rare commodity.


Prepare for the downvotes. Permabears are angry right now.
Yeah the tribalism has gotten somewhat bad here and I feel like it's pushed away some decent traders. I and a few others left a previous trading sub only to find ourselves heading back due to the very reason I just mentioned. Still some pretty good people here though.
Why letting it ride? Upside is minimal with resistance levels right (literally right) above us.

Why bullish? Not saying you're wrong just, well, if I hadn't entered a position already I don't think I would right now. Could easily see it going quite strongly either way at this point. 

I think the action today has been very much indicative of a market that isn't sure what direction it wants to take.
I respectfully doubt it sir. most BGD props the price up or jump start an uptrend it seems.
I feel like too many people are expecting it to happen right now and almost everyone thinks that “all the other traders are bearish right now, so I’ll go against the crowd”. 

EDIT: I might be wrong, but for me it’s a no-no to go long 
I'm usually bullish but this seems a bit ambitious. Neither the daily nor the weekly inspires much confidence at the moment. However, it's not impossible that we crawl up to 8500 and that might be a good short entry. 
Yes, Wyckoff distro shows we would re-test the $8800-$8900 support-turned-resistance, potentially even a couple times before dropping further. With the consensus event ongoing, it’s hard to enter any trade on leverage though. Normies could still FOMO in and push this past resistance, causing all bets to be off at that point.

However, if we fail to push past resistance here over the next couple days, I personally expect a large dump incoming. We would likely run out of buyers after consensus (and the BCH fork), and the buyers during this period may get dumped on. Again, this part is just my opinion though.
Yes, but on a low volume rally.. It's now possible that $8200 was the mark down. unfortunately it's a relatively nebulous thing so we can't know for sure until we see more. Shorting here is not a bad idea though 
yes, although it was supposed to be a low volume rally. this is just barting, I kind of ignore it in terms of TA 
I think you have to factor the consensus conference into the equation.  TA by itself is insufficient. 
Good point.  I hadn't made that connection.

most sport betting right now is done in Bitcion for this exact reason.

which means if it becomes legal, they won't have to use Bitcoin any more. 
So from what I see/know/understand, very rarely \(if at all\) are bets actually placed in BTC. Instead, online sportsbooks offer BTC as a means of deposit \(instantly converted to fiat\) or withdrawal \(the book will convert your fiat to BTC and send it to a BTC address\). They do this as it cuts down on ACH banking fees or credit card fees \(cyrpto use case!\).

In terms of the &#37; of total deposits/withdrawals that are BTC denominated I would estimate it's very small, less than 10&#37;, likely more 3\-5&#37;. 
~~Little bit early there. I wouldn't say breakdown imminent until we hit 650~~

Actually solid trade. I won't do that but 8650 could certainly provide some support. Just don't expect this to be a longer term trade.

Which fork? It's scheduled for tomorrow and it's non-contentious (no new coin)
I feel like the easy answer to this is to impose an escrow, confirm proper funds via audit then release 5-10 business days after the fork? If there are coins improperly allocated, then simply reallocate them.
Right. And I see "reversal" in comments . . how many "reversals" have we had in last week? . . lol 
Had all weekend to break down below 8k and failed, why on earth would the previous bottom break all of a sudden. What time frame are you looking for this to happen in ? 
lol this is sarcasm, right?
So I now realize you called it a channel in your post, but I'm still posting this here for anyone that just looks at your chart without reading and thinks you have a descending wedge drawn since I spent a little while typing it up...

It's important to clarify the black channel isn't really a good wedge. A wedge is more valid the more "filled in" it is, and that one is hardly that. It touched bottom, then rode the top for a long time before quickly retouching the bottom, leaving a lot of empty space. I mean, if you pick and choose points that loosely for a wedge, you can make almost anything into one: https://imgur.com/a/la1oiW0

Not saying that image is a valid wedge, just pointing out that picking highs/lows for a wedge is slightly more complex than picking random highs/lows. Additionally, the volume trend within the wedge would be opposite what you'd expect - normally volume contracts as the wedge develops; in the picture (MidnightOcean's) it very much is expanding.
Always love your comments.
Thank you!

Is it gonna break up or down?
A sudden pump to $8.7k and not much follow-up by the market after. Next move up/down should be interesting and set the direction for the market over the coming weeks. 
Hmm idk, we might break down right now, but I feel like there's a lot of hidden walls in the order book. I think it's going to take a big move to break one way or the other.

Exactly the same happened to me on Saturday. Was in a similar position, could have taken profits but held on and eventually closed around break even... only to find it went right up again yesterday!! Difficult market to trade at the moment.. big moments in both directions from past 2 days so hard to time the trade entry/exit right. Good luck all...

Sell resistances, buy supports. R/R good, if you keep doing that you'll be profitable in the long run.
The bulls right now are relying on whale buyers.  The volume is absolute garbage at these levels.  There's really no momentum happening, and if the whales don't make large purchases for a couple hours, the prices are going to dive again tonight because they won't sustain this tiny amount of volume all night.

I'm longterm bullish, but I don't trust these movements yet, we're still in a general downtrend.
Heh "momentum", and an ominous doji.  I'm not optimistic if it's green.
what's that daily candle called?

Should've listened. 
Break out from that pennant was textbook but can't call it a win until we break that downtrend line. 

Pennant target should be around sub 9k, but there's some overhead resistance at that line. 

It's looking probable but we'll have to see where this takes us. 
Shit, I was just thinking the same thing. We're exactly at the same spot we were yesterday. The real BGD was 1K, this is not that. 

Stops in between the 0.5 fib line and downtrend line from 9900, so around 8950ish.

!short xbtusd 8748 10X 40%
Stops above 8925-8950 puts it above my possible patterns so i think its a good area for a stop.

Just need to lose my stubbornness and think about doing the same.
Good luck!
With you in this. Don't want to spam the thread, but I flipped short at 8750, then added a bit at 8775 (order only partially filled). Looking to close at ~8650 or 8675. Minor scalp.

Edit: I'll pm the bot for this one. I do plan on being long again very soon, in case anybody is following along.

ouch.... :\(
Here's what I posted yesterday morning:

If you believe we are still in a distribution phase, or believe that $7.8k is right around the corner, then shorting/moving to fiat makes sense to me.

However, to consider the alternative, if we are in an accumulation/reaccumulation phase, the sells/shorts are being used by accumulators to reduce slippage for their buys. (Price won’t rise as high, which is what you want if you're accumulating) I’ve been looking over the BFX data, and for transactions over 1 BTC, I see mostly buys (usually clusters totaling to 20-50 BTC) while for smaller transactions I see mostly sells. Perhaps this is indicative of retail investors selling while bigger players make sneaky buys. Or, maybe it’s just a coincidence and we are indeed headed much lower.

Just what I’m seeing, and full disclosure I’m in a long.

Edit: also, go call your mothers you filthy animals

https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8j1gi0/daily_discussion_sunday_may_13_2018/dywq4z3/
But I must say, the current patterns look an awful lot like accumulation with "forced liquidity moves" like fake-outs and fake-flags. That's exactly what someone would do to "create liquidity" when buying very large amounts.
I’m still cautiously in the distribution boat. However, the re-test of support-turned-resistance is generally a low volume rally that dies out before dumping further. This BGD makes things a bit confusing at the moment, so it’s hard to say until we see what happens right here at resistance. If we get rejected here, we will likely dump hard. However, if this continues to push up, its hard to say what will happen moving forward.
It's very possible this is re accumulation after mark down. I really don't know now. If we blow past $9k then I'm longing probably

Staying long. Don’t think we will bart back down until after conference 
Hmm, I'm not sure if we'll bart back down due to the explosive volume in this pump. I think 8650 will hold as resistance turned support, and I think we'll get another leg up in the next couple of hours (4-6?) to around 8.9-9k. 
I think everyone is probably moving up their stop losses to $8600 or so, which is why if it gets down there, this thing will bart back down to $8200 and will be used to try and push through the $8200 area for the move down

That report says a lot about the customer base of etoro, but nothing about crypto investors beyond that. Look at the coin popularity, XRP is well above BTC there....

Do the same questionnaire on Bitfinex, for example, and the answers will be very different.

So far it's nothing but a healthy retrace. Unless this goes to 8300-8400 it's not a BART.

I closed half and half at  8550, 8600. Interesting. 
It was a 300 usd candle. Not huge. But still nice.
damn, caught the absolute top of the wick to the letter!
don't you remember all the barts we had on the way down? 
It's consensus. That's the only news that's needed. Historical data is there to see and I don't get why folk have been ignoring it on here.

Don't trade against the trend.
You're very likely gonna get stopped out even if we do go up.

Your stops should give more breathing room. You're essentially longing 1000x. I'd move stops to breakeven once the move really starts upwards. Otherwise you risk getting chopped 
how do you draw the wedge ? 
Appreciate the analysis. What time frames do you usually trade using TD+Ichi? Just 1D and weekly?
are there reports of barts seen on alts charts? looks like only BTC has them.
I say we bart back down, but I aint got the balls to short... for now
\#waitforpanicorcreate
Underrated comment.
Additionally, consider for a moment that if you wanted to make a big buy without causing too much slippage, you might consider buying at what seems to be a precarious place like $8,350 where sell pressure as the price increases (8,500, 8,600, 8,700) is all but guaranteed. A buyer's ability to anticipate the amount of sell pressure as a result of their big buy (and hence, anticipate what the average buy price will be) is worth a lot of money, if that makes sense.
Everyone seems to be $1K off this morning. 
This comment is going to age well
One can also say where is the buyer follow-thru? 
You were saying?
> No way this sub can be always so horribly wrong?

You must be new here
You do realize it’s possible, right?
I opened a short at 8,845, but I'm thinking about closing it. These buy walls are just sitting there without anyone dumping into them whatsoever.

my thoughts exactly. I'm waiting for that wall at $8000-8200 to go down or for this to get above $9,150 again
Thats roughly my target, too, though the time estimate of their target is too soon.

Well, technically it shouldn't because PGP's main use case is encrypting text.

However, a PGP vulnerability *will* affect orders on Dark Net Markets. As some have suggested here in the past, there's a pretty noticeable correlation between the number of Dark Net orders and Bitcoin price.

[Composite man](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:market_analysis:the_wyckoff_method#wyckoff_s_composite_man) wants one and one thing only: He wants your coins, he wants your money.

He wants you out of the game, so he can even have larger influence on the market, with one less small participant to worry about.

Beware of the composite man, he would kick your dog and steal your candy while laughing about it.
One could argue that the easiest way to get rid of one's competition is to put them off.
seems par for the course to me. This is exactly what people mean when they talk about volatility.
Have to  perform smash and grab before the law prohibits it.  The nuanced theft happens when ya gotta be sneaky or go to jail.
I mean we all know crypto is just a giant decentralized ponzi scheme....right?

doesn't mean we can't make money on the way up/down. 
Haha, it's comments like this that make me expect we'll be at 8.3 in about 45 minutes, haha. 
the velocity of this bounce has me thinking you’re right.
So the price could either go up...or down 
and stopped. 
ya if anyone here is bullish or just in it for the r/r, now is probably a good time to buy. 
Was already violated just now?
Same, entered a 2x btcusd long from 9320 and an ethusd 1x from 690. Will bail at 9150 and ~670. Strong support below us and nothing above us makes it a risk I want to take.
if you were trying to distribute in this range, why would you market sell massive chunks knowingly causing the price to drop down considerably during moments of poor liquidity? 
I still think these barts are just someone getting their positions filled on bitmex. if all the volume happens on bitmex but bfx moves the market...you just Bart for free money

Why does it have no volume then? -_-
I helped a buddy set up his Coinbase account this past weekend. He bought $200 worth of BTC.  I showed him a list of places that accept Bitcoin and was pretty excited about the whole concept.
I agree. I bet we bart back down and this was the fakeout friends
BGD bearish, BRD bearish... this is why the majority of people aren't rich: they refuse to eliminate their bias and adjust to the reality that is smacking them upside the head.
You also seem to have no idea what you're doing.
Depends on how much responsibility you want to have for the security of those coins. 

Do you want to have to deal with explaining counter-party risk to them? Or the entire concept of cold storage? 

The easiest thing to do would be to just have them setup Coinbase accounts. Since their technical understanding is low, you could do more harm than good if you suggest they buy a physical wallet and they manage to lose the device and the seed. 

Also, be mindful of the tax implications of what you are doing. Depending on where you live, this could be considered a taxable event and you'd have to pay tax on the realized gains when you transfer the coins. 
What is bitcoin? This sounds interesting!
From what you’re saying I think you should inform yourself first...
Nope, they just need a bitcoin address which they can get from Coinbase or any other exchange or wallet service. Downloading a solid mobile wallet such as Bread might be their best bet. Make sure they write down their mnemonic phrase!
They don't need an account, just a wallet.
ATM + paper wallet
Yes sir. I graciously ask please give. Do the needful
Sketchy af.
you can have them download bread wallet too or make an account on coinbase. No the safest options, but maybe the easiest. 
This is a reasonable way to give coins to people who don't have a clue about blockchain.  Its Ethereum though, not Bitcoin.

It's going to about 8150 tonight, no TA here just taking 8350 at 0% gain on BTC on the day and taking .98% or -2% as it's low for tonight.  
If you're going equal sizes to lock in profits at the current level until a direction is decided, that can work. Risk of getting chopped, though. I've had it go well and I've had it go poorly. I'd probably move both of those out $40 on either side. Downtrend line from the 9900 peak last week is right on 8900 right now. 
!long XBTUSD 8350 25X 20%

(I know, I know, sorry guys - I swear it's real. Set up my long and hedge short like a minute before I passed out last night. Hedge short got stopped out and now I've re-opened another hedge short - see below) 
the million dollar question
Some people begging to get REKT hard apparently.

I'd open a short with 1000x leverage now.
Wait until resistance $8,900 breaks. There's pretty much 0 reason to hop in on this breakout right now. 
I think that the support line is too aribitrary to be useful right now.  It could be drawn also as a channel or as noeeel pointed out a broadening channel.

The resistance line is solid though and works for all of those.
> textbook fakeout/dead cat bounce

How? Just how textbook can it be? Did you see the future? 

It isn't textbook until it happened, close your short or stop trying to convince yourself with bullshit prophecy.
For once I agree with you
Lol. The cat is very much alive, and we may see a new ATH before 7K.
Blunt way to put it, but I tend to agree
A crashing market looks bad, I expect vested interest to keep price up now until consensus is over.
I think we will be range bound for the foreseeable future \(at least this week\). So shorting anything above 8700 and longing anything below 8400 is my strategy, but who knows. The bottom could fall out any time.

I think Consensus is a bit overblown, but it is not "here" yet. Starts at 10 EST, no?

I think shorting here is a bad idea. Shorting yesterday evening at 8700\+ was a good idea.
Sounds about right to me, I'm expecting Consensus to be a damp squib.

Very few people actually care about it, and I don't see why an expo with less than 3,000 people is going to cause an imminent mooning.

I've been to local fairs with more people than that.
a BGD from 7200 to 19k? if i ever witness this my life will be complete.
**He wasn't joking about his prediction. He's acknowledging the laughable nature of price predictions.**

Part of his point:

Still a low institutional presence in BTC. But custodial services are being ironed out. Upon which comes the big, safety-concerned $.

new era will be when we are back above 9.3 - 9.5 area. But we are getting there... maybe fast or with Patience.
It ain't over yet.
I wouldn't be so sure man, I'm going to go out on a limb and forecast we'll be back in the 7k range within 5 days. Based on what? Pure instinct built from the past 5 years of watching bitcoin (so basically take it with a grain of salt). I really don't feel like this is the breakout that so many people have been waiting for, but we'll just have to wait it out and see.
And in case you're wondering: Unlike the dumps, this will not be a short-term phenomenon. 

Do not short Bitcoin. Ever. But especially now.
We were at 8300 13 hours ago, and 8880 7 hours ago. What do you really want?
If that is the case, the best play is to slowly accumulate over the next couple years, but the market is fundamentally different so I don't think it will play out that way. Would be nice because it would give a lot of normal people a chance to get rich slowly and patiently. Don't see it happening though.
> Damn it, I think there is a case to be made for a 2014-16 sad time market;

Really?  Never heard that before on here.  What an original thought.

Of course there's a case for it.  People have been saying that since $19800...and actually well before.
Not so sure about that.
this is in no way like the December rally...December didn't bart
> This is my prediction based on the calculation of the probabilities

Is this the same "based" as "based on a true story"?

Cause same fam same; I also base many predictions off calculations and probability

Futures are bitcoin derivatives... Read about derivatives.
maybe that can be a Hugo formation.
No second thoughts about thinking this is a reversal?
So you're short or you sold at 8400, got it.
no info in the mtgox channels, I think this is just FUD here, coins were moved long ago...
Nope, last movement was couple days ago before the latest dump from 9000s.
44k moved in total?
or 44k moved today?
Have you ever owned any bitcoin? Just curious 
In what way is the market similar to 2014?  Has there been a Gox-scale event?  Are there 400,000 coins (out of a smaller number of total coins, I might add) out there being sold?  No? Then sorry but you really don't know what you're talking about.

As a guy who sold/spent a bunch of Bitcoin in 2014, I'll just tell you that even in that true bear market, I wish I had hedled.  This market is not a bear market.  If anything, it's bullish AF.  Let me repeat.  Bullish. A. F.  We were dumped on by the biggest bearwhale yet, and his minions were telling us about goblin town and capitulation and bag holding and what-have-you for months.  But here we are, higher than anyone would have expected a year ago and, by all rational indications, heading higher.

So in what way -- fundamentally -- do you see market conditions as being similar to 2014 and, not to be a dick, but were you even around back then?
In outside world people and media are comparing this year trend with year 2013 when it is supposed to be super bullish. Not sure why people in this thread are again and again comparing it with year 2014.
This is an inaccurate description of market position.

* 2014: https://www.tradingview.com/x/FGqLSOtq/
* 2018: https://www.tradingview.com/x/9D4DpxEJ/

You need to see a lot more bear momentum and more lower lows if you're going to say they look similar.
i'll cry if iwant to
well you have a few options imo.

$7800-7950 will very likely provide a bounce

you can sell here, hope to re-enter lower. possibly have to add higher

you can wait for it to go below $7950, but then you're losing a pretty solid 12.5% :/

or you can wait to see if it goes below $8.2k. But like I said, probably will bounce at low $8s or high $7s so you're not going to be saving much profit. At this point it's just about: do you care about closing at $7800-8200? Would that hurt you too much? If so, yes, close here. Screw r/r, you have to have some risk management. But if the position isn't large or you can stomach the extra loss, I say just wait

If it goes below, say $7750 though I would be hesitant to hold that thingy though
How much of stack invested?

Edit: You could sell a bit here and rebuy at lower price if you think it's going down, adjusting your DCA on your position, whilst still having some in case things do turn up (we're still in higher low/double bottom territory)
Target...?

You can't actually. The pump invalidated a pretty straightforward breakdown:

https://imgur.com/a/ufSPECb

The market still needs to clear resistance at $8,850 though in order to breakout to the upside. 

It's quite possible there could still be another breakdown at some point in the next few days. 

Utter craziness.
You can't, TA is becoming less and less useful in short timeframes. I suggest trading 12H / 1D charts and opening / closing positions gradually. Otherwise you get whipsawed, get stop hunted etc.

You're giving TA way too much credit.
You can't, so stop trying to use it to predict something you have no control over.  It's like gambling addicts that think they can change the outcome on slot machines using their "system."  It's a $400 15 minute candle!  The only way to predict it is if you could see inside the mind of the people that make that candle happen when they want it to.

news events should be represented in the TA.... but sometimes not
By looking at what happened during previous years consensus before/during/after. Which you should have been doing after looking at the bear timing/volume over the past week and questioning why it is so sketchy/forced.
Good news just came out from SEC so that would be a FA push upward 
I wouldn't really classify this as "great job." 

Price is currently closer to the start of the breakout than where it was rejected.
Yeah you're crazy, A&E would need much more time to develop, and the midsection is pretty low compared to the starting of the descent. 
Yeah definitely Loco, bro 
I think it’s best to only go against the grain when the time is right...
Seems like we had our low\-volume retest to the old support line of the distribution phase. A drop into the 7ks seems extremly likly from this point. Sloppys diagram is perfectly right so far. 
My sl is at 8164. I advise you to put your stop below 8200, but that’s just me
Pretty nice entry! target? 
I don't think BTC has ever been part of "most investors' long term strategy". "Most investors" buy safe indexes and check in quarterly. Btc is still too risky for most investors
3:2 longs:shorts

Was there a "reason" we dropped 1k in 24 hours last week?

Sounds like you just explained the BGD.
What? It's 10:05 in New York. They've already had the keynotes and remarks. in 15 minutes they're going into the first break.
my thoughts is a fake out stop hunter

just a quick short squeeze to get people to buy in thinking some news broke 
As I [wrote shortly before the BGD](https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8j9i8m/daily_discussion_monday_may_14_2018/dyydbfk/), I think the bear flag was not really relevant because of how BTC price had gone up the day before (i.e. on a short time frame, the trend is unclear). I am not an expert on TA, but I used BBands to check how far we are from the 20-day MA. It showed that the price is already at the lower BBand, so I saw no particular reason why we couldn't witness a bounce today, although a temporary one. I had no particular reason to think there would be a bounce, other than the fact that we have dropped very fast the last week (indicating that more time is needed in this price region), and that bitcoin has a tendency to surprise us. With the right stops in place it was reasonably safe to have a long open until we saw which way it went.
price has possibly been suppressed while smart money accumulates and retail moves to fiat/shorts/, this rise is just buyers taking advantage of liquidity (to reduce slippage) in the form of sell pressure. just a hunch.

That's a long way down.

Are you trying 1 satoshi/byte or something? I just sent some the other day. Confirmed in ten minutes, cost me like 12 cents (to send a fair amount of money)
Perhaps, cut a few lines here and there whilst you wait to make it quicker? lol.
This kind of shit makes me wonder about the actual long-term viability of BTC sometimes. Even 10 minutes is far too long in today's world (unless we are comparing to international bank transfers).
Reasonable price range according to who?
If you short something with leverage that goes up 1000% a year....

It's grinding against resistance, but I agree it seems to be losing some steam. Will probably pull back soon to 8.7k or 8.65k even. Unless of course, BTC doesn't give a rats ass what I (, we?) think and just pamps or dumps to oblivion. 
>Anyway, the market is looking pretty strong all of a sudden

Sweet summer child
> Anyway, the market is looking pretty strong all of a sudden

Oh boy...

It's $300 up. But almost a grand down over the last few days.
Nah, I do both and sports betting doesn’t come close. Different crowd too.
That will probably break down because bearflags break up and bullflags break down 
dildos?
This has been said 300 times today.  Doubtful.  Don't need crypto to make legitimate bets in cash. 
why would this be good for BTC tho 
from what i took out of that is "if it falls from here its going lower" well i guess that makes sense. Thanks for clearing that up
TL:DR; If it goes lower it goes lower. If it moves up it could move up.
I have really bad skills in TA and I admit it. But wow, I feel like a genius when I read your shit post.
Apart from the missing nuance about uncertainty what is wrong with this analysis to me is the use of "we". "We" don't determine direction, unless you are one of the large scale traders. Again and again we see the price movements determined by dumps and pumps in the 100s of btc. Sometimes these follow channels and other TA indicators, sometimes they don't. What is certain is that small time traders making a buy or sell won't determine direction, they are simply not coordinated enough for that. They can either follow (and amplify) or attempt to preempt the direction.
I don't see 12K or even 10K happening in the near future. Market hasn't been near 11.7K in over 2 months and in the meantime new buyer interest is in the crapper. Nothing has improved since the last rejection at 10K over a week ago. I want it to be different but reality is reality.

Thank you!!!  That made me laugh. Am about the opposite of what you've described. Still, that sort of personal connection is what makes this thread, and Redditt in general, such a great platform. 
You spelled Morgan Freeman wrong!
Very glad that I'm not the only one seeing what appears to be very clear trends in the order book. When evaluating Bitfinex the algos - if that's what they are - applied to the book make it rather clear where the trade range is targeted at any given point in time. Not that the range is always kept in check mind you.  

I also agree with the point that there is a need for more nuance in regards to the various groups in question. That being said, I still see a rather clear focus on price suppression over the past 4 to 6 weeks especially given all that we've seen in the alt space.  
I think back to the periods in March or maybe in April also where we have seen days spent between 7800-8200 or 8200-8600 and wondered then if those were levels were intentionally being made support/resistance for a bigger reason. As the news then was of institutions are getting into this etc.
Not entirely certain that other players are better with TA, for me it is more about the ability among these participants to marshal and deploy resources in a market where volume is so incredulously low that price can be effected.    
Probably the best compliment I've received in a long time. Thank you. 

In truth, I've been thoroughly frustrated with how the Bitfinex order book has been "managed" for a number of weeks now and wanted to vent somewhat.

Wherever possible, "don't hate the player, hate the game" meaning DCA to the best of your financial ability.  
I suspected that others would have picked up on and highlighted the same trend, and what is provided here in the link above is even better than mine. Far more succinct and to the freaking point. 
No....but suggestions open for the best opening line to the next person I see in that shirt.
It didn't forget at all, we got to 10k... I think just some people got uneasy and didn't want to leave it till right after the event before selling.
What rumor 
we went from $6,500 to $9,800

most alts are up 100% 

yes, plenty of people bought the shit out of the rumor 
I bought at 8k, but shitcoins fucked me really bad.
long term as in years? I think we all know where this is going over the next decade or so
Ya, wasn't so bad though. Bitmex server lockdown actually saved my ass. 

Spot was in the $8600s while June futures were lagging at $8,450. So I market closed for a small loss. 
Bot never picked up my position, but I closed it for a small loss at the beginning of that candle. 
Here's one [https://twitter.com/BTC\_Schmitcoin](https://twitter.com/BTC_Schmitcoin)
Just that if you squint and look at long term moving averages, the general structure looks the same \-\- but what happened next was different.
This is just a tracking bot so i don't think a time control to close should have interest. 
Every user starts with 100% stack, that value will be affected by each trade and after some time it should be able to tell if the user is successful or not. For now i'm populating the database and fixing the bot syntax, once that is stable i can start with the statistics part.

No wiki or faq, just a !help command on the bot that will be upgraded with time.
I would certainly expect some support there, as it was pretty significant resistance earlier and traders will remember that. At least, it'll be more support than 7.4 and maybe 7.6. I'd think if 7.8 falls we'd blow through 7.7, maybe halt a bit at 7.6, then down to test the 7.5s. I don't really think we'd bounce there as in over 9k but could definitely see a retrace to 8k+.

If 7.5 falls we'd probably blow through 7.4.

My feelings on the specifics of that scenario above are pretty much just that I wouldn't be surprised if it happened. Certainly going to be adaptable to what actually takes place. Definitely think some form of bounce at 7.5 would be likely though, just not a sustained one given the relatively small volume node compared to what we'd have just fallen from.

I mean it's easy picking if we all are following like lemmings, especially when there is only a few of us rather than an army.

Edit: also to be clear, I'm a huge fan. The guy is a good honest dude and sharing his experience out of good will.
I don't necessarily think this will pump BTC. Just want to consider the chance, since some hyped alts might drag btc up. Not really sure what to think about that.
Get ready for hourly pump & dumps on alts though 
Oh, thank you. Do you have a complete list or overview by any chance? 
I'm curious - short of Satoshi Nakamoto himself, who would you have cared about enough to attend?
Where would you put the top of the bearflag at?
> too much uncertainty right now

Uncertainty is only for day traders.   
Canada. 
Ontario canada. 
mining difficulty adjusts and less efficient miners quit, it's an equilibrium. 
The resistance line from the $9,950 and $9,400 highs is going to catch up to current price relatively soon. It's at around $8,950 at the moment. 

So unless that breaks, a long from down here is super risky. 

r/r for a short with stops above $9,000 isn't bad. But the r/r for a long right now isn't so hot.
There's definitely a correlation tho. When every bullish comment is rage downvoted I know a BGD is coming. Bottom shorters constantly get rekt in this market.
A double snark is like a double negative, right? Or were you serious? Because this is a bear trap. /s /s
I don’t take anyone in Crypto seriously unless they can answer a simple question:

What is the Byzantine Generals Problem and how does a PoW blockchain solve it

Pretty amazing that I have yet to get a proper answer by anyone who isn’t an OG. Like all the McKinsey, PWC, EY etc “strategy” fucktards all have their head so far up their own ass it’s insane
I think on larger time frames, they work pretty well for bounce reversal.
I find it super helpful to reference support/resistance easily. Specially on higher time frames. Same as pivot points. But you know, to each their own.
> Overly complicated way to do moving averages.

I disagree. There's a reason it's also called the "one glance cloud chart" because you could take one look at an Ichi chart and it'll tell you almost everything you need to know. It may be a very visual system, but it lets you discern and filter low probability trading setups from those of higher probability.

With that said, I respect that every trader has their own method that works for them, and as long as it's helping you turn a profit, then that's all that matters.
Traders hate him!
did you close your shorts due to risk management or because you think the r/r for shorts isnt high enough for you to be in a position?
He didnt choose the thug life, the thug life chose him
it’s only 150 bucks lower for now bro
well played. I sold mine im December.
Yes, but only if you were sitting at the charts right then and there
You can cut your loss when gambling too. Cutting your loss in trading can also be a mistake.




A couple of hours ago most people were predicting <8k.
yes, but I was honestly guessing :D
Smaller profit margins but likely even smaller losses.
It's less than 1% away from current price. I don't think it's that crazy to wait.
It's strategic to wait for confirmation in various formations before entering a trade... this can be done on both smaller and larger time frames... you may not maximize every trade but you avoid bigger losses which is critical.

If we don't get above the line, it's possible we turn around and march back down to the low 8's.  Above the line and we can expect further upside.
emotional, bull, doesn't understand trading...why here? go to r/bitcoin if you're just gonna get upset when people tell you to be wary of buying the top. 
They'll go long once we break $19900
I don't know how you can be bearish since we are essentially ranging between 6k and 11.7k with a range that's growing tighter and tighter. It's completely normal to see volume and volatility decrease the longer this pattern continues. 



Will keep your opinion in consideration
I agree with this. Esp considering first day of consensus. They ain't gon waste a news event
I'm on June futures so it's hard to directly translate it. Premium has been fluctuating $40-$80 today. Basically the add is just under my green resistance line and the stop is just over it, +/- 0.5%. 
15m are very tight, don't think we'll have to wait so long.
I have my strategy in place, and it should mitigate losses if this goes against me. I have no desire to try to re-open if I get stopped out and it's a fake. That will have exceeded my risk tolerance for the day. 

I'm going to be mobile the majority of tonight and the only thing I'll be looking to do is move stops to break-even if we break down. Should be interesting to see where this goes.
Told ya
crypto is not and has never been manipulated
yes I agree, possibly one of the bad news
Username checks out.. 

But yea, from what I'm seeing so far it looks like just current brick and mortar casinos/racetracks will be accepting sports gambling bets. However, I don't think it'll be long before a lot of this moves online and you're placing bets from your living room or wherever. Above anything else, I think this will bring a substantial increase of competition to the space. Augur and Civic are crypto examples of this \- but I think they will def face challenges from normal companies that now have the opportunity to *legally* create some variation of a competitor. If anything this would likely hurt them.
What worries me is that we never went back to retest the line after the breakout which is something Bitcoin does quite often. The longer we go without testing it (if we do end up testing it) the more painful it's going to be. 
The cup being at 6.4k? or the cup being at 8.8k on the way up? or the cup being 8.2k on the way down?
I mentioned a possible c&h on longer timeframes earlier. We could go down to maybe 7800ish levels before the handle becomes too deep, I think. Sideways chop around here makes it less likely the longer it goes on though.
Well, bull flags are never guaranteed to break to the upside. 

If they were, they'd never form in the first place. The market would just keep going up and skip the formalities of the consolidation portion of the pattern. 

I honestly think it might be the TA diehards who get boned here. Because the breakdown is a sell signal, but the market doesn't exactly look like it wants to drop here. The market could reverse and turn the pennant into a flag. Something like this:

https://imgur.com/a/qk0Jqix

I'm seriously thinking of adapting this strategy. For real. 
Potentially. [Here's my take on it](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8j9i8m/daily_discussion_monday_may_14_2018/dyyxbch/) from farther down.
I've been looking at that possibility as well, although I thought the case for a different consolidation formation (that faked out to the downside) was more compelling:

https://imgur.com/a/YA2xmk4

Either way, when there's large candles like the one we just saw from $8,400, I'll frequently zoom in to the 15m to try to get a jump on a potential breakout. 

At least for now it's not looking like the market cares very much about the formation I drew though.
I'm confused by what you're trying to accomplish here. 

Is your goal to long a 100% retrace or short here and take profit at the bottom of a significant retrace?
Well, you should know almost instantly if that was a good idea or a bad idea. 

Good luck!
Big green dildo.
I mean if they want to get caught in the impending short squeeze, then it would be a good idea. 
You mean 8400? haha
The bot is ignoring this command because it already has one in the top comment. Send the command by PM.
no clue, this is all very strange. 

But ya, Bitmex's hamster-powered servers saved me instead of fucking me for a change. 

Market-orders that close an open position take priority over everything else. So while spot was at $8,600 June futures were stuck in the mid $8,400s. I exited at around $8,481 for a small loss.
yeah at this point it seems like whales just play the market like a fiddle while the retail investors give them the liquidity to do so.
Haha thanks, I was scratching my head. I almost spit my coffee out when I opened the link 😂
Why is bart ?
[deleted]
First thought you typid the 9, but onv that’s your point
Bart's dildos screw you over all timeframes.
Thanks, fixed :)
https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/about/rules/
Rule 4 is rule 7 in the full list. The sidebar has a different order.
Oh yeah? I sold 8200 two days ago and that was the bottom, it pumped to 8600 as soon as I sold and I had to buy again.
*always*controversial.
Yeah re sold for teeeeeenie profit and waiting for lowers. 
True but it was big enough to close the day green had it been a few minutes sooner 
> Sell when RSI is above 70 on all time frames greater than 5m, buy when RSI is below 20-30 on all time frames greater than 5m.

Ohhh if it was just this easy. Not bad advice but lately this hasn't been the case at all.
That's fair. 
Do you mean the 15m-4h, or are you including 1d/1w, because that would not be very many signals. 
There are also the pigs

Well I meant these seems to be a small traders, and then big traders. And nothing in between. Maybe it's just the Bart thing... No idea
Patience, young grasshopper...
Sounds pretty good, sir. Where can I sub?
Fuck the user
My add just hit on 8940 on June. 8870 average. You can probably guess my stops. About to find out if this was a bad idea. 
Watching for 8.860 on finex (downtrend). Struggling there as we speak. Meh, I'm out of a position anyway after getting fucked by the schizo action in the last 48 hours. 
Bull flag break out stopped by long term resistance... That would be annoying.
Too late to the party, that week was good and this week is turning out to be good two. Lost your chance :D
I will test it. Should be a bug of the bot. I'll correct your entry after that 
Hehe. I made my first buy on October 25 at 5620 and continued to buy into December. Things were looking pretty grim for me for a while, but I've traded my cost average down to $5003 now.

If crypto is hundreds of use cases it will never take off. The world has never worked this way. People aren’t going to have many different coins for different things nor will they keep BTC to trade/turn into these when needed. Adoption is so far Away. Agree on BTC price being tied to investors but I think we may never be in a word where the price of BTC has anything to do with adoption or use. 
You are wrong. I work in this space and everyone is so clueless about how to develop meaningful software that they spend most of the time blabbering about gibberish they don’t understand while BTC devs do the real work.

Look at iota’s github. it’s a joke. Go look at githubs like Docker, Kubernetes, Tensorflow if you want to know what production grade distributed systems are supposed to be documented, commented and maintained like.

Iota, Ven and all the other crap has horrible documentation with terrible code that is “functional” at bet.

Just because pornhun added ven and bosch claims to working with iota does not make them in any way shape or form meaningful. Especially when you know that the people in those companies are largely managment and marketing people.

If any one of the technologies behind iota or the like were truly insightful, don’t you think Google would be all over it? They’re a massive software company with hardcore specialty in distributed systems.

Yeah... Just because you read it on the crypto news channels does not mean shit
Agree, but that's not going to happen with 1M blocks.
Depending on how this hourly closes in 5 mins, we will also have bearish divergence on that tf.

edit: bearish divergence confirmed
You did indeed. Why didn't you put a stop actually?
> I might be addicted to shorting...

dude you have no idea...
agreed, good move
it means to meander sideways/up and down listlessly with no meaningful direction to the market
as in rough up and down movement, think rough seas.
Have yet to see a big conference moving the price significantly in crypto (expect for a few hrs' spike). Normally what you hear in these conventions is rumored/discussed days/weeks before. TBH I would not expect revolutions following Consensus.
I wish I could upvote this a few more times. It breaks my heart to see people on this sub throwing their money away when "buy the dip and never sell" is soooo easy. It's the best chance normal people have had in all of human history to break free from serfdom, and you just see people pissing it away.

That said, I trade a bit, and I've been doing pretty well at it recently only longing with small leverage and never shorting.
> Just take a moment to absorb what BTC is

Very good piece of advise for all of us. :)

> With the price at these sub 9k levels anything is likely just a good long entry.

I made a slightly wrong entry yesterday at $8,652, luckily got stopped early during the dump we saw.


I actually wished all the best to all traders, I don't know who are permabears or permabulls, but I guess we are all here to make some extra bucks!
I could care less about their downvotes as long as they're giving me their money.
I'm pretty sure the reason it's here is *because* those people moved over here...lots of people came here in Feb and March and are super emotional 
(If the person who has been buying isn't finished buying, then that's exactly what he/they want you to think. If you keep selling and shorting, you're potentially doing exactly what they want you to do which is to provide liquidity for their buys)

Who knows though, they've already bought about 10,000 BTC this morning.
I think many of the traders are sitting with their bags on the side to have a clear direction. So for the resistance levels above us, I trust the price to take care of it as I haven't noticed any change in its behavior at all. 

We saw a drop of about $1,000, price took care of it, we saw another dump last night, price again took care of it. So long I keep seeing the same patterns, I think I am going to stick to my plan and let it ride. :) 

Are you still riding yours or closed?

Good idea!  It could be traded entirely on the sentiment of this sub by bots.  Manic 50% swings every 30 minutes would make for an interesting coin.

Protected candle. 8600 should hold, should. Will it? IDK, but I'll risk it.

PS. I'm loooooooooooooooong.
[removed]
If you can't predict a BGD, you also can't predict when a BRD will happen. Anything is possible here.
I've noticed that too. It makes it quite tempting to buy now or on the next modest pullback.
Nothing changed if it can't go above 8800. 
did you forget every single bart on the way down to $6.5k?
TA is almost useless in the Bitcoin market. One BR/GD and your doji ichimoku fractal tightening bbands theory gets shot to hell. Also, the fundamentals (basic supply and demand) say we're going up so shorting is almost always a bad idea.

I assume they are drawing a connection with the U.S. Supreme Court's decision today to strike down a federal law that effectively banned commercial sports gambling in most states
If you are a major sports gambling entity, using decentralized currency allows you to manipulate lines much better, crypto is a preferred currency in many gambling circles.
The US Supreme Court just struck down a federal sports betting ban, meaning states are now free to dictate whether they want to allow sports betting or not.  This breaks Neveda's monopoly on sports betting and perhaps opens the door for there to be A LOT more online, bitcoin-driven sports betting.
> most sport betting right now is done in Bitcion

any data to back up this claim?

Thank you. This always cheers me up. You always seem to comment below my trades and congratulate me if they are successful. I really appreciate that. Kinda makes my day after watching the charts the whole time :)
Also nice! Good scalp with good risk management. :)
Nah I think we're okay considering we can simply reshort if 8650 falls.
Yes I am if 8650 breaks down. As I said it could have turned support.
Yep, still happy about this trade considering how confusing the market is at the moment. Hope you're not underwater any longer, are you? 
Thanks   Yeah I’m being pretty cautious only trading small amount. Just having fun.  Stops are tight. At this point its probably gonna hit stops though so maybe not the best idea I’ve had all day. We’ll see. 
Hardly seems riskier than entering during sideways movement these days. v0v
So far I am happy with my long. Just hope we keep going up 
I dunno, going long worked out pretty well for me this morning when many here were shorting thinking we were headed to 8200 or worse 
Zaif 
I think he means the one from August last year.
They have a serious fuck up. It’s about damage control now
buy the rumor sell the news, so whenever consensus finishes + ~6 hours or so for the market to decide the direction 
did everyone here really forget that the term "barting" was made on the way down to $6.5k? 
You are 100% correct. Great catch. I actually modified the charts to extend from a channel to a wedge, but forgot to update the language. 

To clarify, this is my attempted prediction of where we might be going in the next ~10-12 days, but again, this is not very well filled in and Bitcoin's volatility makes it wildly improbable that it will be this range bound. That being said, while volume is growing, I am seeing support for this thesis with some of the MACD and Stoch RSI indicators that I use. 

Here's the [super zoomed in view with volume](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZQRAWxMr/).
Maybe you should. /u/MidnightOcean is an intelligent analyst and you're an epic douche. You could probably learn a thing or two.

This is actually good I always subtracted the two values. Guess good for math practice...but this is way nicer. 
Great, thanks. That's what I'm looking for. I want to be able to say something like, "the B bands on the 3D haven't been this tight since ______," with precision. 
was also leading the market yesterday for some reason
What's your cost average again? 8500?
Yes.
The longer it goes, the more I expect down, but could be position bias. Up would be pretty bullish short-term.
I doubt the next move has much effect on the future at all.
Isn't it a good sign that we are still holding the price in this range, we have hardly gone below $8,700 since that candle.
It's more a slowly build of despair since no BGD happened.

Edit: Bot fixed. Position updated
If you're underwater from $9k you won't be for long.
And you'd be "overwater" from 6.7k and 8.1k.
Yeah, stops are pretty tight for me. I don't want any part of this if we leg up again. 
it already bounced, crazy
They buys are ok for a staggered entry if they believe in a longer timeline.  That sell though.. yeah thats just a horrible idea imo.
good call.

Nice! I missed your post yesterday. I think I agree, it very much looks like accumulation right now.
How could a cluster buy that amounts 20-50 BTC could be considered as a sneaky buy?
This is what I believe it happening. 

Also, read this if you missed it:

I do my analysis on Bitcoin even if I buy/sell Eth, that's why I post it here.
What do you mean by long\-term here? I think everyone is atleast a little bit bullish for long\-term otherwise there wouldn't be much point trading.
Yeah I try to avoid being influenced by external sources when trading. It's a lot easier that way \- otherwise you start thinking into everyone viewpoints.

However if I find individual with similar trades like my own, it's often helpful to see what they are looking out for etc. 
please resist. I doubt we will go up sognificantly from here without a retrace
Just seems like this is all being orchestrated by a select few people. People who imo really dont care about the conference, and who are probably making a boatload of money playing us all like a fiddle
usually pumpers start their sell offs before the end of the conference 
I closed my long. Bart is just way too likely and 8750 is a fine place to close if you ask me

If I wouldnt open a long here, I always close

There is no trend.
I don't have actual stops, that's where I'll close manually though.

Possibly like this? 

Edit: This is 4H
go to the 6h chart and draw the res and support line, quite straight forward....

[http://thepatternsite.com/dbw.html](http://thepatternsite.com/dbw.html)
I found BBANDS useful for the weekly. Weekly was so insane that indicators were not very helpful. Daily I use the combo of TDI and Cloud. I may make a shortish trade on a 1 hour chart if I'm bored and see a setup. But I'm generally looking for a 4HR>6HR>12>D trades hopefully with cascades of bullish or bearish divergences if the trade fails me on the short time frame I'll cut it short. If it moves into the next time frame and shows signs of continuation i will let it ride until I hit a target (maybe a few % off) and leave 25% of your trade open because your never sure where it can go(maybe with a trailling stop). Higher time frames are great to trade as long as you can get a good entry. My hedge was at 9350 was premature but I saw a slight OBV div and bearish RSI and added a little to my hedge there that bring my base score above where we are now. Sometimes I'm willing to take a few $ less on less of my stack just to properly play the longer time frame. I need to build up my portfolio again after last years wreckege which is happening slowly....

When the market is in a state of confusion like it is atm I tend to hedge at safe points and look to short if I can see some strong signals. This will be my strategy until we're clearly in a bull market I think.
barts aren't powerful enough to cause alt panic

they only drop/pump the price down a few percentage points 
Don't worry, I shorted enough for both of us. Fully expecting to eat a loss on this one though.
Yeah I guess so... Still waiting on this dump to 7000.
Obviously but I'm just trying to understand the rationale. Looking at finex I'm seeing still even at 8765 relatively low sell volume. So I just want to know the rationale.

I guess I shall wait and see.
Lol, like now?
How did you get it back to normal
Watch out. She’s about to fakeout dump. 
You don't have to beat all the bots, just the slow ones and other people playing the same trade.
Well that's quite possible, what's not is trying to when system overloading
Not saying this is what's going to happen, but every BART pattern starts as a flag or pennant of some sort. 

And if received a nickel for every BART that completed and paid a DIME for every flag that completed in the last few months, I'd probably still be in the green.
Hey mate, slightly off topic, I followed your underwater short, you did a great job closing it. Cheers! 
I see a wrong-slanted flag which is usually the sign of an impeding B.A.R.T.
Anyone fucking with margin trading right now in the middle of a whale brawl deserves what's coming to them. 
Correct. Never sell your coins to composite man.
No. The traditional financial system is a gigantic Ponzi scheme where people like Buffett give themselves free shares, then bring in a bunch of suckers to what is basically a glorified mutual fund. The first ones in make a lot of money. Everybody else gets screwed, and most of them don't even know it.

Crypto is the antidote. See genesis block. Next time they crash the economy, there will be no handout.
He who laughs in 2020 laughs best. Haha
Not stopped my dear and my stops are alarms love. Wonderful is it not.
r/r  looks ok,  but not bullish.
that is entirely possible
Putting in some limit orders at $10 right now. #YOLO
I concur, bottom is looking to be 7200 - 7400 from the 5800, and 6300 bottoms we've had prior. 
I normally take the pole from the top of the flag as we're heading in the "thicker" support. This is more a personal preference because markets don't fully correct normally. From the breakdown point I get around 7.3k which would coincide with the log downtrend from ATH + the 0.786 retrace at 7.25k. This is probably the area in which to look for a reversal. 
We may bleed up a little, but wait till west coast US wakes up in 5 hours.
Lol, thanks edited
Are you the inventor of this lol?
Well general population will wait for the bubble run up to buy in, so they can catch top and celebrate a 5% gain 
because people download the app and make an account so thye can check the price ;)

Or to buy 20 bucks worth of BCH
Imagine when it becomes possible for the general population to passively invest in crypto like a 401k or something...
It's just that the price is served on a silver plate to bears, unlike a slow and steady push with plenty of time for everyone who wants to to sell. 
Looks like a bullflag. Considering how things’ve gone, bart confirmed.
The fakeout was before, when we broke down multiple critical lines and reverted in 48h
If you're half as knowledgeable about counter-party risk as you are about trading, I think you would be doing this sub a huge service by making a top level post at some point. I'm not saying you should or are obligated to in any way, just a thought.

You're right, I might wait to see if we get a little fake\-out from some news and try open at 8700. 

I guess theres not one specific point where we can see major price action this week, its anyones guess. If nothing interesting happens by the end of this though and we're still in this range, i'm expecting big downwards movements though. Do you agree? i've been away for a few weeks so i'm still figuring out the sentiment on here.

The moving averages on a long term scale being flat and parallel after a valley is new.

And people have been calling for 0 since the start of bitcoin, bears are to be distrusted until after few data points are in their favor. And no the 75% drop is not; that's just bitcoin.
we go up slowly on low volume and then come crashing down quickly

remove the 6000 BTC buy wall in the $8000-8200 range and this thing wouldn't have stopped at 8200, only a matter of time before the whales stair step the next leg down
And how you call sudden 1.5-2k drops in December? Fart?
Mate, have you ever made any contributions to the forum, or even prediction? Anyhow, I am not really interested in knowing. 

It's easy to criticize others when you do not have the balls to make bold statements. Thank you.
At the end of the day, I said that I will have another winning trade today. :) 

"anything can happen notion" is there obviously to keep the post neutral and people like you happy who likes criticizing a lot. 
gotcha thanks
I meant it more in the short-term sense (bear flag didn't break down) so for today we'll probably close in the green, contrary to what it looked like the last couple of hours. 


Actually I sold at 9.5 and have been in fiat this whole time. I guess you can say I'm short on mex but only 1x (so essentially fiat). 

Edit: People like you are funny. Just because I'm trying to give advice here and telling people not to fomo and be patient you think I'm on the losing side of a trade. I don't get it. If you do feel like I'm wrong then say why.
So many of them...

"This is ridiculous"
"Ok that doesn't make any sense now. $5k incoming anyway"

You can spot the shorters from quite some distance here.
If I am not mistaken than 44k were moved today
.A massive pump no one realistically thought would happen had occured at the end of the year prior and then a slow and steady downtrend occurred. It just feels the same to a lot of people is all.
Thank you for posting this. It's getting tiring watching the same posts over and over again about this bear market playing exactly like the one in 2014/15, even though they are very different, not only in the price fluctuations but also in the surrounding circumstances.
currently ~65% give or take. it's actual BTC holdings, so no leverage.

I'm aware i can add to this, but the question then becomes how much and at what price.  

This so much, BTC used to be so easy to trade on lower timeframes. Now there are so many bots going against each other. Have to adapt to market changes.
Thanks bud!
Why on earth would you think TA is **supposed** to predict that move?

TA identifies the state of the market, not the prediction. All predictions are exclusively on your head. TA just gives you statistical analysis over the **past** prices.

However, what you **can** do with TA is draw a descending channel from 8750 to 8450 and then say: "If it ever goes above this line I will buy". That is not a prediction, its just a conditional trading strategy. TA helps you to be consistent in your decisions by using objective measures.
Thanks :) That was a rhetorical question! But seeing some BGD like that when I'm waiting to buy is discouraging sometimes ;)
Yes, congratulations if you followed through (No sarcasm) but there are tons of other possible fractals. 
I feel like that's hindsight bias? If this thing tanked, people would be like "dude, the consensus is just a decoy / don't trust the media"

What do you mean by bear timing/volume being sketchy/forced?
chewy, please tell us when you hedge. I am almost certain this is a fakeout, but I feel battered by this last weekend
During the move up I anticipated that if we didn't exceed 9900 with volume that we would stall in the high 8800s and get rejected hard. When that didn't happen it seemed like either someone was supporting the price at 8850 or bears were asleep at the wheel and we would see more sideways. At this point I'm just setting a stop at 8750 for a small profit on my buy-in from 8650. That might be too tight a stop, but I think we'll be sub-8500 if we don't break through 8900 soon.
I see, I hadn't considered the relative height of the mid section.
The time is never right.
You're still on that drunk long?
Hey L14dy, your entry if you will?
Any particular reason behind that number? I think if it breaks 8300 it is most likely going to continue falling to 7.8k at least. 8200 is just some safety margin.
Hopefully just below the long term resistance around 10k. I'll add more if we can break 8.8k on high volume or close sooner if we don't.
I think I have about 20% investment in crypto now (up from 5% last year). The rest I put in safe indexes and 401k or other retirement funds as you say. The only issues with owning crypto is that it can be quite time consuming or all consuming to manage.  I wish I had bought when it was extremely low - sub 6k or below ATL of this year so I can just hold it indefinitely.
This isn’t necessarily true. I’ve been hearing more and more “safe” investors saying that it’s worth  allocating a small % of total investments towards Bitcoin or Ethereum. Purely anecdotal of course... but I have noticed a shift in attitude from these safe investors. 
Genuine question, was the Mt. Gox trustee selling? People were parroting that. 
sorry my mistake I thought it kicked off at 10am
This
Buyers or buyer?
Huh? Im not taling about log trend line, but linear. I agree on the idea of price using that as support potentially should things get really bearish down the line, but I'm talking about a bounce off a line that is right here, not 5k below us
No, not really, pretty much a perfect bounce so far.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/yq8fsmXP/

Edit: Not saying it will hold, but a BGD off of a trend line thats almost a year old may be worth watching. Dont see the R/R from a short perspective until that line is broken (which probably means 8k)
Gemini -> Bittrex

0 confirmations thus far ... 

Hmm, dev bait maybe?
No! There can only be one gypsy!

That’s what lightning network is for. Give it some time. Big technological changes do not happen overnight. 
That's what LN is for
Yea, it's software, it'll get better.

I mean, its still better than waiting days. I just want to pull the trigger on something so I'm antsy ... the delay is probably a good thing.

According to the halfwits willing to sell a revolution for mediocre short-term profits who still have coins to sell, but they want those profits to be somewhat greater than the profits of the 70IQ sellers of the 6000-10000 range.
Woke up after 8 hours of sleep and saw BTC at 8300. Went to adjust my stops and fell asleep with phone in hand. 

I woulda rather been sleep deprived 
Ohh that's why..that makes it very good long play..damnn I had switched all my miners to xmr..ugh
Cool, thanks.
You're like the 4th person to accidentally quote prices in the 9000s this morning lol
gently carressing
I feel like you guys think I am calling for a bull market here. I’m very much a bear still. It’s amazing that I can get downvotes a few days ago for saying we wouldn’t break $10k when everyone was bullish. Now I’m getting downvotes for saying it’s possible we may move up for a couple days before continuing to dump. Maybe my comment sounded a bit more optimistic than intended, but the market doesn’t only move in one direction at a time, retraces happen even on dumps.

The cash jams my DVD drive. 
Just off the top of my head, people could make smaller bets, plus quick deposits and withdrawals. So if say on Saturday you decide you want to place a bet on the Browns for the game that starts Sunday morning, you can.  After the game on sunday you could have access to withdraw those funds after the game ends. Also, probably money laundering haha. 
Whatever. What I meant to convey is that those are the levels you should start going long with stops right below them.
Basically, but if we don't bounce and bounce hard on one of these levels, we're all fucked.
Wow everybody gets so pissy in here when the price is dropping.
Thank you, but I think your post is much better than mine, I'm just glad someone else is seeing what I'm seeing!
Ask if he's heard about bitconnek
“ I’ll trade you your shirt for a limited edition picture of the amount in my profile in the end of December 2017”
That was clearly not related. The price fell way too hard "long" before the event start.
I mean...u think those 15k shorts closing were all a bunch of people simultaneously realizing Consensus would pump the price? lol 
Nothing to do with consensus 
You weren't ever here for the technology then.
Yeah, I know it will either go up or down
You do? Where is it going?
No one knows. It could be worth millions one day or nothing. You have experts on both sides. No one has a real clue 
I mashed market sell when finex broke 8600, and I was damn lucky June futures were still under 8500 somehow. Got 8490 exit.
[deleted]
Check your history page, should be good now
Kind of true. And position bot just makes it easier
Not saying you do, and I appreciate the post. Just curious why people think this will pump bitcoin. 
Unfortunately that's more than just a small possibility.  Scamcoin ho!
I'll set up buy orders based on the event schedule lmao
A google away.

Three words.

ROGER VER
In all seriousness, I glanced at the list again. I'd be interested in seeing Charlie Lee speak. Also, if some of these are panels then I'd be interested in those so long as the host is asking tough and pointed questions. But beyond that, I'm not familiar with most of these name but the projects each are associated with are complete trash for the most part. That's just like my opinion though, man.
pretty early to say as we might not fully develop it and already get another leg down. our channel would say about 8.5-8.6k, but I'd say 8.5k makes a better short entry here. 
Well we are in a \(day\) trading thread.
won't this concentrate mining power into the hands of the few in this scenario
There's a lot of people in here that I respect that I caught shorting 8400. I honestly don't know how to explain that. It seems Reckless given that they did not decide to wait for the bounce up to get a better entry. And they didn't have a short open after the three days of red we had back around 9100. The only explanation I can come up with after thinking about it is they're trigger happy and frustrated they didn't start earlier.
To be fair, we can only call bottom shorter in hindsight. I also sold 8350 FWIW.
Hahahaha, nice.
Good one. You can also simplify by asking them what the double spend problem is and what did Satoshi do to overcome it.
Proof of work solves the problem by allowing for consensus via a hash. Not an OG where am I wrong?
This is dropping like crazy.

!short XBTUSD add 8360 20% 
Learn this one easy trick to fool people into thinking bitcoin is going to goblintown so that your clients can buy cheap at the beginning of the 2018 bull run.
I love him
I will reshort if we bounce a bit here with stops above the res line. 
How? are there some high end fancy gambling places?

I was speaking of a stupid bet and a stupid trade.

I bet $100 that red team wins / red team lost: I lost $100

I "bet" that BTC will go up with my $100 but put a stop loss X% down / BTC goes down and my stop loss is hit.
Yeah true, based on the bear flag we were making it would've been the "normal" outcome. Yet I found it suspicious that the flag was too perfect. 

Either way BGD is good for morale. 
underrated comment
so if we touch 8950 you'll long and if we hit 8900 and go down from there you'll short?
lmao ive had an open long since 6500 and youre telling me im a bad trader? okay guy. 
yes, thats the safest entry point

for anyone who absolutely refuses to lose a dime, thats when they'll be back
I can agree with that, it could take some more time to fall out of this range. I would be more neutral but I just think the trend is down and am not fighting it. I've seen these cycles play out and I wish I would've listened to the bears in 2014 so I'm being maybe a little too vocal.
Good call.
I’m literally in the kitchen making food. I really have a knack for not being around during a move. Nice call though 😉
For one second I thought I was reading the buttcoin quotes bot
Yeah I was referencing the recent 8.2 as the bottom of the cup
This is getting confusing. If it's a sell signal will be a good measure of buy pressure here. 
I see, thanks for the explanation
I think he's trying to catch a break-down by placing a stop limit sell below "fakeout" territory. 
Suppose on the 1 min you get a drop to 8625, I would take that as a sign we're heading back to 8300's to complete a bart.  I'm supposing one could put a plan to enter a short position at $100 (for example) less than current market price by placing a short entry at that point.  Conversely, you could simultaneously plan a long at +$100 the current price.  Basically trying to catch momentum because it seems like large movements are what makes the market these days.

Edit:
>short here and take profit at the bottom of a significant retrace

Yes, but not short here, put a stop sell order on the books a bit lower than the current price, to avoid being on the wrong side of a major movement.

Stop short would mean he wants to catch the second half of a full retrace
I'm expecting so. I bailed manually on the last one very quickly just to re-enter the same place, so I'm going to let this one go until there's an actual clear break rather than a hint of one. 
I just did.

I'll stick to PMing the bot.
I've been getting rekt the last few days, but over all lost about 2% of my stack. I respect that you don't call out manipulations etc, but you gotta wonder if we have any influence at all considering the low volume and order book. I may have to sit out for a week or 2 and evaluate my life choices while spending my stack on hookers and coke.
It is the exchanges making wash trades.
Is Bart?
How about BFD.

Reasoning: Someone gets fracked no matter what the ? in B?D is.
Watch it drop past 8200. I sold at 9200 friday. Im waiting for the bottom. 
Lol whoops
Oh. Didn't see that stupid daily was red. I checked some minutes before closure and it was green :(
This past week that whole pamp it Bogdanoff video has been so close to reality again, its been seriously some rough irrational chop.  
I would include the 1d, but of course no big deal if the 1d is 35 resp. 55 and the others are more outside those ranges
yeah the ones who get slaugthered
Well, we've already determined it was a bad idea. We're just not sure how bad it was yet. 
Honestly, I'd be far more surprised if the market didn't fall flat on its face here than if it did.
Yeah...except we're still, what, $1,000 lower than when you posted that comment? Otherwise, everything's fantastic. :)

A part of me is still rooting for you and the other young permabulls...but I don't think BTC is done handing out beatings yet. We'll see.
Everytime someone makes this argument i feel like they are saying *Why would I have 3 different social media accounts? Yet most people do. Wby would i use different torrent websites? Why is there a need of anything more than one? There are like 1000 different meseenger apps all making tons of profit, yet they all do more or less the same. The answer is obvious..
i think you have your cryptos a bit mixed up...ven and pornhub?
[deleted]
Then why are they gaining partnerships with huge enterprises. Why does DNV GL and PwC partner and Invest in VEN. Its because they do something that BTC cant and thats OK. Btc is a cryptoCURRENCY, it does not compete with Iota or Ven or Neo which have a completely different goal and solve a different problem. Im not bashing BTC, im justs saying its not the thing that gets the most adoption lately, compared to protocol coins.
That makes no sense. There aren’t 1MB blocks anymore and, in any case, that’s a complete red herring. What do you think 1MB blocks has to do with any of this? Small blocks are about encouraging maximal decentralization of mining hash power. It’s a positive, not a negative.
Like where could I do that? We just bounced off support line I drew. It's around 8.3 now.

This is my second try on long term entry since we pumped through 7k range. I close it when this breaks down and gonna go back to scalping then.

But yeah, it's third time I thought that going with hedge shorting my position wouldn't be bad idea and it's the third time I didn't do it.
Do you short more than 1x \(in terms of trading and HODL stack combined\)?

I have never shorted more than the notional value of my trading stack, and I am morbidly afraid of doing so
thank you broo
Alts will rally, and they will drag bitcoin with them. We may have a sell the news event afterwards but I doubt it will become a major thing. Consensus could very well change the course of the market by adding the much needed fresh blood (money).
Agreed, I love for people to share their perspectives, as it makes it easier to understand the market. I hope both groups can make money both ways. People seem more inclined to upvote/downvote whatever opinions they agree with on here these days though.
Hahah you’re terrible.

I feel dumb after deleting a comment a few days ago saying we likely wouldn’t breach $10k after getting multiple downvotes. Thankfully, I got got enough upvotes last month for saying there was too much buying pressure at $6600 for it to drop below that as well. The thing is, daily trends are easy to track, but reversals are based on the smaller trends, and people tend to not pick up on those factors when trades are going their way.

The price has already dropped by almost $1900 this week. It’s okay for a retrace to happen, even if it continues to dump further after. I’m not saying we will breach resistance here, just saying it seems very possible right now after an inverted bart + higher lows + a bull flag trending up.
I still come by, still lots of good discussion, but I just know some people were getting frustrated for just sharing their ideas and getting down voted for no reason (by no reason I mean they weren't being mean or rude or what not)
That is exactly what I said to L14dy above, so long I continue to see the same price patterns (buying), I am going to stick to it. Plus, I do not think that after buying about 10,000 BTC, the buyer would let the price go down right?!
I closed mine
I think there are some exciting projects in the althoodie space, but I feel like they're overvalued as there are a lot of hopes and dreams baked into the current price.
You can get that without t-shirt
Exactly, that shit will get you laid.
as you probably know, it would be a HUGE deal if that happened so do let me know if you dig up a source ;)
That's what they want you to think.
I'm a gold fish. I stand corrected sir.
but....if it's legal why would you use bitcoin 
yes, go join any sport betting site, bitcoin is pretty much the only way to get money in and out of these sport betting sites
I'm happy you managed to close in profit! The chop is brutal so not getting rekt is an achievement :)
Solid plan, especially in hindsight now that we found some resistance.

Though you might slip to renter on bitmex, good call to lock those profits like that.

Currently in profit now. I think I’ll set my stops at break even and wait it out. 


Cheers, thanks!
Wow, I would have thought 9 months is enough time to split their BTC holdings in a correct manner
Its 3 days long so are saying sometime Wednesday or Thursday will be breaking previous low?
oh a bart is totally possible, but he's saying we're going to go right to $6,000 "plummet" which sounds unlikely to me, but who knows.
As do I
True, but in a way BTC movements always seem manufactured. in this case though I'm wary for a fakeout breakdown. 
Which two values? I use bitcoinwisdom. 
Yes
I think so too
Breaking the line from 9900 and staying above 8900 is where I change claws for horns.
Ask the previous barts that question
Remember many folks are on either side.

So interpretation is likely up to their bias (including us).

As mentioned earlier my guiding principle is that I would rather be caught with my pants down in a long vs. a short because buying more bitcoin as the price dips is in line with how I would invest in the long term anyways.

In this world of BART though there really isn't any way for anyone to know what will happen in the next days/weeks.

Only thing that seems useful is doing the opposite of the maniac sentiment (ie dips are bought up and pumps are sold) and that is for now...

EDIT: The not overthinking take though is that this is bullish if no1 is willing to sell it under 8700... But again who knows... Market is in who knows mode.
Didn't know if BGD stood for big green dildo, so I googled it, and one of the top hits was "Busty Thick Midget Versus Hulk Green Dildo Amateur on -- beam.to"
Repeated character assassination because I asked why BCH was only processing 80 Kb blocks and you couldn't answer. Shitcoin sub is that way ->
This is not okay. I'm giving you a 7 day ban. Cool off before you come back, please.
someone following gypsy around and harassing him. am i in an alternate universe
I never said it was inevitable.  And because there's more than one whale, with more than one opinion on where BTC is going/should go.  They're not all on the same page.  Some are going to want to push it higher right now to increase the worth of their accumulated coins, others are going to want to push the value lower to accumulate more coins.
I meant not optimistic that there will be buying pressure tomorrow.
Thank you!
it's almost like we've been ranging and anyone who just waited long enough is profitable 😎

Literally everyone who called a target between $6-12k has been right at some point in the past few months 
With this BGD actually FOMO'ing @9000 with full stack should be a good trade if very tight stops are used.

When these small rallies start most likely they will have another legs up and entering soon might be good.

I just saw. enjoy your sick rollercoaster. 
Yeah dude that really sucks :( that really unfortunate though to flip right before a BGD. I don't think you'll get that unlucky twice.
!short xbtm18 8600 close

damn...
Shit happens...
well, if you're watching the data in real time then it wasn't very sneaky, but if you're watching the market in general it didn't end up moving the market that much because of all of the sell pressure, hence sneaky. you're right though, sneaky probably isn't the best descriptor. 
!short XBTUSD 8650 1X 100%
Not a bad thing at all what you are doing; but nobody cares about your Eth/Usd position. It's irrelevant to the whole bot position idea.
Y'know what I regret pointing that out, sorry, that was bitchy wtf.

I actually did appreciate the post being about btc movements controlling the decisions of your whole portfolio.

/me downvotes self.
I think by the end of the year we will be over 17k.
That's a good advice
i mean it could take another leg up, but yeah the risk isn't worth the reward to be opening a long here
lol
Thanks for this comment. It brought me back to a happy place about 25 years ago.

meh consensus is a bull meme dawg. After LN moved the price 2% I am of the opinion  that the only news that moves btc lately is exchange hacks
yes and no. It was chop from 9.2 - 9.8 until a trend confirmed and 9k broke down to 8.2 . THen it was chop between 8.2 and 8.8 ...when 8.8 breaks up it will confirm new trend. If you avoided trading the chop zones you probably will  have cleaned up nicely here. 
Be smart like a Bart
Until it's no longer the trend.
cool then keep gambling on the chop.
Gotcha 
Closed a little late at 8730 for a good loss. Should've seen that one coming.
nope, I mean a descending BROADENING wedge. \(but the one you showed here is also interesting, have not noticed that one. \)
I've been using a combo of TD sequential, ichi, pivot points and basic chart patterns mostly on the 4H as base but moving to higher or lower for overall trend or good entry points. And obviously RSI and MACD. I think they work well as a reference point and for keeping an eye on possible swings or reversals.
That’s what I’m feeling too, but I aint got the balls to long either
I think there’s a stalemate here as everyone and their mother is asking whether we are reversing or not

Consensus is going

All eyes on BTC today.

It’s a game of chicken: Bulls vs Bears

If we don’t push to 9k, 8200 probably won’t hold again
You are welcome Reddit. My posts are the  ultimate contrarian indicators.
I did nothing. It just returned. I wouldn't know how to change it. All of the Chinesey exchanges make me a little nervous. They're all cranky in how they operate. 
Damn, had started to build a long down there but only one order had filled.
I know the market has been crazy last few days, but are you interested at all in shorting here, given that 8800 may prove to be strong resistance? 

Edit:  or are you more intersted in longing the breakout through 8800 if it happens? 
You noticed this line [I have in purple yet?](https://www.tradingview.com/x/x7QAJ1ra/) I'm short from here, will bail if it breaks through to that red box.
Thanks man. Was nervous. 
It's okay I got to laugh twice in one sentence in 2018. I'm content. 
those are not stops.
the r/r is pretty strong, if we do hold up $8.3 and it bounces above $8.7 then I can see it going pretty high
Could you clarify where 5800 and 6300 are? You mean 5400 on Nov, 2017 and 6000 on Feb, 2018?
I have that support line at 6800-7000

https://www.tradingview.com/x/jRgfCJmv/
Just my claim for fame I suppose
I wonder who really bought $200 to $1k in 2015-2016 then 
Because it's cheaper!
I bought $20 of BCH back in December because I was dumb and figured that “I should own at least a bit of everything on here” and I thought I would be a millionaire in a week or something crazy like that (basically textbook FOMO). 



I have gained a lot of wisdom from this bear market. Honestly this bear market was probably the best thing that could have happened to me in regards to crypto.
How about sudden drop in prices that the market painstakingly went through in a course of weeks exasperated by double FUD? If we can drop that hard we can rise just as fast. 
The fakeout was before that, when we broke up multiple critical lines and then reverted 
There's not a whole lot to it. 

The reality of BTC is that it's still the wild, wild, west out there. All of the following scenarios have played out in the BTC space within the last 5 years:

1. Exchanges hacked with total loss of investment - Gox

2. Exchanges hacked with temporary loss of investment and reimbursement in the form of a token - Bitfinex

3. Company closes down and simply takes ownership of unclaimed coins - Changetip

4. Socially Engineered "hack" where user's exchange account is compromised and account emptied - probably every exchange

5. Regulation changes and inability to trade on a platform. Coins returned to user, but I'm sure it was a pain in the ass. - Okcoin + US residents, Bitfinex + US Residents, etc. 

6. Loss of 2FA and total loss of coins - There are ways to identify you if you lose your 2fa device, but if you used an alias on Bitmex because you're a US resident, then good luck with that. 

And that's just off the top of my head. There are probably more than a dozen additional scenarios where you take on risk by leaving your coins in any location that isn't directly controlled by you. 

As the mantra goes, "if you don't own the keys, you don't own the coins."
It's a nice christmas/birthday present for someone that doesn't do crypto.  It would be stupid to put a ton of money on it but for smaller sums I'm not going to sweat it.

In theory the card manufacturer could know the private keys.  My guess is they are honest and the manufacturing process doesn't keep a record.
It's a necessary part of the joke
Well done 
Buying is never "safe" at any price point.

But it's certainly safer to buy BTC with stop losses below $8,800 once the market has spent a few hours comfortably above the resistance line, than it would be to buy btc now. 
yes, I agree. If we don’t make it above 9k by week’s end, it’s going down IMO
Disgusting!

Now take your upvote and get outta here
"People" have been calling for every number between 0 and 100,000 since the start of bitcoin.  It means absolutely nothing.
Maybe, but it currently seems to good to be true tbh. Time will tell
Volatility.

Our volatility now is lower.  But still not low enough for the bear cycle to complete.
Lol. But they didn't just go sideways after and then go right back up. I miss January/Feb

It was starting to get fun again and then...this morning happened -_- not looking forward to barts again 
so posting on reddit takes balls now? lol
Why ask if you don't want to know?

It would be one thing, if I didn't make out there predictions but I absolutely do; calling 9.6 at 8k or 11.6 a week ago were not popular opinions

Maybe. Short killer disguised as Consensus positive?
You based your entire initial post off literally nothing.  Your argument is that the move upward makes no sense and that people would sell from 8.4k at 8.7k?  For a 3% gainer when we've gone down more than 10% in the past few days?

At least technical indicators give us a better evaluation of what's going on in the market rather than what you think makes sense or not.
Fake news. The wallet belongs to K8 Casino, not Mt Gox

Where are you seeing this?

The only moves were from last week.

Show some proof that 44k were moved today, because what I am seeing is just over 24k have been moved in total. 

FUD at its best. 
They're pretty similar in price fluctuations, which is why most people compare. No idea why you think it's so different. it's surprising how similar it has been. 

edit: Really sad you guys STILL downvote this. just check out the charts for yourself.. It's really not very difficult to see its playing out more or less the same.. Sorry if it hurts your feelings

If your argument is "but this time it's different!" okay.. fine. Maybe fundamentally. Just keep in mind that's what everyone who participates in a bubble says.. But also realize that you're not arguing that the charts are different. You're speculating that the future will be different. So far we have not deviated very far from the price action in 2014. 
/u/SloppySynapses said it well, it kind of comes down to how much losses you'll be able to stomach. I can see BTC € 6.3 - 6.5k or possibly even a bit lower. You could decrease stack here with the hope of adding more lower like I suggested, or you could ride out the bumpiness as the direction isn't clear, and who knows, we might get another consensus pump. It's up to you. If you decide to add, I'd say wait for atleast sub 6.6k
did you mean to reply to the OP
Assuming consensus would have no effect when it clearly has every past year is based on what datapoints? Especially when this year there are a number of other big conferences going on at the time/continuing in to the weekend. Want some more easy predictions? There will be a decent sized pullback after the consensus bull run is way overbought followed by the continuation of the bull movement fueled by a new round of main stream media news and institutional investors. The news will be better for eth/alts.
it is, the guy you're responding to is very emotional.he has been underwater and is hoping for price to go up 

this thing barted up and down all the way down to $6.5k. did we all forget this? 
If $8,900 breaks with confidence, then this entire drop from $10,000 to $8,200 is most likely a bear trap.

It'll be awhile before I hedge if the market pulls a reversal out of its ass here.  
Same. 

But I just shorted the June futures from 8910.  I guess I just like to be hurt over and over again.  
No, fresh long. 8375 XBTM
8375.

Fully aware that we could go lower. Got a feeling we bart up though
maybe you’re right. I think it maybtest 8200 and bounce off tbh
What makes you think it's not extremely low right now? I'm sure earlier adopters at 1k wish they had bought in at less than 100
Not confirmed. But not relevant either as they sell off market.
smells like someone betraying btc with alts -> this delay is a built-in self defense feature in btc.
That sounds like a gemini problem. 
LN is fine and all, but I don't see it working without removing the decentralization aspect and moving the majority of transactions off-chain, which kind of defeats the entire point of Bitcoin.

~~Creating a LN channel with everyone you want to make transactions with is not practical at all, so we'll just end up with bitcoin "banks" who you depoait your BTC with, and they have LN channels with each other.~~

See my reply to The-physicist about why I don't think LN is the solution.

Interesting perspective. 
So you fell asleep again just after waking from 8 hours of sleep?
Just give it an hour, you'll see...

This really starts to seem like it's meme magic. Meaning 100x long right now.
Don't get burned
Crypto is also a great place to put sports bet winnings so you don’t immediately lose them.
Don't worry mate, i knew what you where trying to say. Wasn't trying to have a go at you.
When is the last time you have seen it bounce hard? Was it recently?
Let's just say, the manner in which the market is operating at this very minute goes along way to "proving" - whatever that even means - both of our points of view.

Enjoy the day my friend.  
Winner. Blockfolio screen-shares are always fun.
The price fell because of the Upbit drama, there's nothing to suggest the pre\-correction rise wasn't due to typical Q2 momentum and Consensus hype. Obviously we both have no idea what really runs this market, but we've had price increase the entire month leading up to this week, and it was only a week ago that stopped.

Just because you didn't 'buy the rumour' yourself, this doesn't mean the market didn't.
no thats just stop losses being triggered 
up

Few ways how it could be worth nothing:

1. BTC SHA-256 encryption is compromised, this is the case people are making when quantum computers will start appearing, but let's be honest, if SHA-256 encryption is broken we'll have bigger problems than BTC collapsing.

2. BTC protocol-breaking bug is found, which is incredibly unlikely as BTC has been around 9 years and one has been able to find such a bug.

3. Every country banning BTC. Even if such a thing were to happen BTC will still hold value.
Yup, I got out at $8481. 
If you do send the commands by PM to [/u/position_bot](/u/position_bot) so you won't spam the thread.
Thanks man
I think all the people spamming positions with actual size and entry listed in the trollbox are more likely fodder than a few traders posting positions on a subreddit.
This is why I said the position bot is a horrible idea for anyone of any meaningful trading size.
Because it's the main crypto that still runs the market (in a conference about blockchain) and has pumped during the last 3 consensus, so while it's not guaranteed people think it might do it again which is not that crazy.  No idea, to me the charts are telling me we just chop sideways and I don't think it has that big of impact but those are the reasons I'm hearing. 
Bitcoin can drag down alts. Alts (together) can lift btc up as well.
Thanks.
Bro, you omitted the first and most important word, 'FUCK'.
I would second your analysis from TA perspective but there is very low buying pressure at the moment. Let's see if the est coast moves something in the next hour.
The cost of mining constantly chases the price of Bitcoin. Centralization pressures exist in both directions.
The reason is one word, which binds us: "greed"
basically, yeah. Good enough for me
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.

You can cash out of bets during the event in many bookmakers. You can limit how much you are willing to lose in a casino. You can bet on different things with different risk/reward etc etc.

Having tight stops doesn't make trading any less of a gamble. You can get your long/short correct, but place your stops wrong and end up losing on an otherwise profitable trade for example.

The only difference is that with gambling, your exact expected ROI can often be calculated, so you at least know the odds. With margin trading, we can't even accurately quantify this when making a trade.
That's just low risk low reward gambling, it doesn't stop it being gambling.
> How? are there some high end fancy gambling places?

In poker you can fold instead of continuing to play your hand when the cards draw against you.

Also the phrase "cut your losses" is often applied to a gambler stopping playing after entering a losing streak.

Not quite that straightforward. 

The market needs to break $8,900 with conviction. 

Which means either pumping the shit out of the breakout up into the $9,000s, or at least maintaining above the resistance line for a few hours. 

It's possible I'll yolo into a breakout above $8,900, but the safer approach would be to get in once the breakout is confirmed. 
Don't know about OP but I will do that. Placed a stop limit buy order @8970
sure you have...you are clearly very emotional. I wouldn't be surprised if you close near breakeven 

I've had a long since $100.....Shorted $19.9 man but WTF u guys trading ur lines 😂😂

edit: ur post history is 100% refined cancer dear lord 
Doesn't really matter, can't break resistance...
that thing is seriously gold 
Yeah.  I guess that is similar to staring at the screen with your mouse hovering over a market sell button, but a little less eye fatigue...
Personal opinion, but using stops to *open* positions very often goes poorly. You're just as likely to catch an open on the bottom of a wick and end up instantly underwater as you are to accurate guess a good entry on a breakdown. If your lean is down, better to open a short here and cut it quickly on a pump (1.5% market stop, etc).
I was surprised you close so quickly. I still think there's good R/R here for a short.

I mean, has [this bear flag on the 4H](https://www.tradingview.com/x/O8Nax5Ya/) been invalidated yet even after that mini BGD?
I'll delete the 9400 one that was a mistake
I love those vids. They are an accurate visual representation of me when price moves only 10$ against me.
Could certainly pull one of these:

Then: https://www.tradingview.com/x/flKelsun/  
Now:https://www.tradingview.com/x/JeC6lEFd/  

That stop on resistance gives me enough pause to let this thing run its course. 
Well how about that, lol. Twice in two days. Unsustainable amount of luck.
Keep rooting for us young Padawans, fresh blood moves this market and maybe a fresh perspective is all that old bulls and bears need. 
oh yeah, that was verge, right?
Wouldnt rabbitMQ probably do just fine? Why would you need a tangle?
And I guarantee I can do your use case on Bitcoin. Im a cryptographer and I know what I’m doing
because PWC is a fucking loser company
> There aren’t 1MB blocks anymore

For non-segwit transactions, yes there are.

> red herring

No it's not. IF the blocks are full, then there's high fees as competition is the only way into a full block.

Large blocks are decentralized just fine. Dozens of pools contributed to by thousands of individual miners. And 1Gig blocks have already been tested globally. Works just fine.


Yes, I am 6x short right now actually. All of it is from above $8.9k and most above $9.3k though so I'm not too worried. It's kind of stupid but I like making btc 

My short from $11.5k was 55x (the original amount) after I added my final add at $9.8k lol
What sort of news are you expecting to come out of Consensus that will cause increase in alts/bitcoin price? 

To me its been largely priced in and I'm not expecting anything but a significant drop once Consensus is over, same thing happened last year if you look at the charts around this time. The only difference is it crashed and then went back up again last year, but that was before the hype\-fest of Q3 and Q4 2017, and after a very long period of pretty normal price movement. Instead, this year we're at post\-bubble pop, and I think we're still deep in the woods of a bear market. Who knows though, this is just my opinion.
> Alts will rally, and they will drag bitcoin with them.

Have no problems with strong statements when correctly motivated.
Care to name the Alts that *will* rally and explain why they will?

Edit: typo.
If you think there are a load of people new to crypto who are waiting on the sidelines for Consensus before ploughing their money in, then I think you'll be disappointed.

People going to Consensus in an individual capacity are largely already very far down the crypto rabbit hole, and I speak from experience having attended.
What I would love to see people adapting to price movements and changing their so called groups based upon the movements to make money, which I think is necessary in day-to-day winning trades. I do the same, sometimes I short, sometimes I long. 

I used to have a flair, sometimes bearish sometimes bullish, I removed it because of the above reason.


Yep that's my read, always have to include the "but who the fuck knows" disclaimer though ;)
Good, I am happy for the gains you've made, Cheers! :)
Sorry I don't get what you mean. By alt, I mean you may create a new account and then place the order if you are concerned about your privacy
😛
Hahahahah no worries. We are at the mercy of the whales. 

It's just that this happened all the way down. It could happen again though, who knows. 

We barted I think 4 times from $7.8k to $8.2k up and down one week 
Convenience.  Speed.  Save money on ACH fees.  Ease of movement between different books.
that's your data?
no, the sell off won't happen right away, there will be multiple legs to it...I'm just saying it'll probably start around then 
[deleted]
Oh you can see the upper and lower band value in tradingview Bbands. idk in btcwisdom.. 
I'd be surprised if you didn't get a chance to walk around 8600 in the next day or two, but I was surprised by this BGD, too.
Y’all are the best, thanks!
You and everyone else, man haha. If we break over 8900 I wouldn't be surprised by a FOMO pump to 9250.
You have a solid guiding principle and I think it will be good in the long run.

If no one is willing to sell under $8,700 then that might indicate that they are expecting the price to rise, so they would rather sell for a higher price. But then again, as you said, who knows..
And the answer has always been simple, it's still a baby. Wtf is wrong with you? 
Actually there are several. One (the author of the fantastic "prolific" hit piece) is recruiting others via viral marketing. 

I'm all for karma (the real shit) but I'm not sure this is a proportional response. Perhaps I'm running a strong deficit with the universe though. It's also a bit different with ~~arsonbunny~~ because he was faking everything, literally he was just a compulsive liar and manipulator, and really couldn't be trusted (those tensor charts and his claim to be a financial advisory or whatever -- BCH, please). Most people knew this and I was not the only one to call him out, just the only one to stay on top of him after he deleted his posts.

This is just blatant character assassination, all because I was a bit skeptical in rBTC. It doesn't even relate to the comments he's responding to.

It's whatever though. **All in the game.**

edit: you can't see that because I crossed it out, right?

Thank you for testing the changes in the bot and finding bugs :)

Let's see if the syntax is now stable before adding new features.
If the bitmex engine were at all reliable, I'd probably look to do something like this. But while you could set up the buy ahead of time (not usually a fan of stops to open positions), you couldn't set up the stop early. No thank you haha
Wanna bet? It wasn't the first time. I knew the move is coming in minutes just thought the flag will break down...
I agree with your opinion btw. I was just not sure about the actions being sneaky. Thanks for the clarification. :)
I mean I use the bot to represent when I'm in fiat vs when I'm in crypto since I don't like Kraken's liquidity/fees and can't use Bitmex/Bitfinex. Posting my position in eth is more representative of my actual holdings than posting it in BTC. If I enter when BTC is at 9000 and exit when it's at 9000 but actually lost $15 per ETH I'd rather more faithfully show my PnL in that way.

But I do trade almost completely off of what BTC is doing, rarely looking at ETH's horizontal levels.
Haha you're good man. Posting alt positions based on BTC analysis is definitely somewhat of a grey area; probably could have just replied to my earlier top level comment with that.
So ... you're medium term bullish.
You can always jump in if 8800 falls with conviction imo
You’re welcome. Judging by your reference to Kojima and your investments in crypto - I bet we’ve lived a very similar life. 

Fun story: I once peed in a urinal next to Hideo Kojima while at the Microsoft Press Conference at E3. Good thing I was peeing already or else I’d have peed a little in excitement. Not the best time to ask for a handshake, either. 
You’re in luck if you keep mayo in the fridge 
hence....stops.
There's just too many ways to draw a support line right now.  I'll pay closer attention to the resistance line which is more universal and has three points.
thats the reason i asked, since there are a lot of wedges, so it would be great if you could provide a chart here.
do you start the wedge in january ? 
Thats generally my goal. Have one main position that I massage it comfortable (preferable within 5-10 % of the tops/bottoms(maybe go in 3x and reduce to 2 x after a few % rinse repeat bu back cheaper) or close to major MA/trendlines and use high level to go long at critcal point on mex using play money without having to TP on my short). I dont wanna be catching 90% of the days movements and spending 20 hours in on my PC when I can catch 90% of the direction over a few weeks with less risk and worry. TD is simple enough and Ichi tends to keep you in the market for long enough that you should be able to get great trades if your patient. Just gotta kind of wait for the stats to align for a kumo breakout and TD. But when you get a gravestone doji with divergences and it cascades down starts a TDI sequential has a bullish cross and and a pullback to one of the T/K or cloud. That's a pretty high probability trade. RSI I have always fouund the divergences to be helpful in identifying even the short term swings that sometimes lead into massive moves in 5 min candles. Could be confirmation bias but it does happen.
thank you for your sacrifice
After being chopped around so violently this weekend, I don't really want to open up a position right this second in either direction.
You are welcome. Actually I myself got nervous for I don't know what reasons when you added to your short I think above $8,700. It paid off. :)

All in all, very good exit.
I've been laughing since $6k in February when all the Chicken Littles in here were calling for $3k. In fact, I've been laughing since 2016. But the big laugh comes in 2020. And you'd better believe I'll be chuckling until then.
Thanks i don't care what you think they are. Either way you're wrong. You don't know where I am trading. Even finex didn't reach above 8830. So sorry love still wrong.
Noway. The weekly looks horrible, i expect a big sell-off.
Feb 6, 2018 GDAX touched 5800, and first week of April, GDAX touched 6300. 
✋

Every day/week/month for a little over 2 years

100 bucks a day, 1k a week and whatever was left every month
I took out loans a few months before the halving (around $10K) that should be tunred into a fuckton last year if not for a few fuck ups. I also had 50 CS coins from 2011 that I had never really touched. I think the people claiming btc was dead where people not paying attention. Bitcoin works as well $1 as it does $1m but it only price flourishes during times when the system may be in actual demand for whatever reason(silk road was probably the leader in trying to implement a cryptocurrency with bitcoin - everywhere else would just be a 3rd party to dump on the exchanges becauseit's way to risky for a business.
Who do you think these whales are? 
And cash sounds more legit than coin.
Historically, we rise faster. You don't even have to go back that far. See last September's drop from $5k to $3k. I bought the bottom of that one too. :)
it's almost like we're ranging in a big ass triangle or something 
My god. I feel like a Nolan's movie.
It's a necessary part of the ban


ok thanks!
Yeah, that move hurt, I've flipped to short just before that spike :-\
I suspect you belong to [this group](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8j9i8m/daily_discussion_monday_may_14_2018/dyybdr3/) lol.
> Why ask if you don't want to know?

Because I later realized there is no benefit debating with you. lol.
The technical standpoint is that this move was just some a big market buy and then a bunch of stops got hit. Do you really think that is just going to change everyone's opinion on which direction we are going in? 

Sometimes I don't think you need TA to know that, as of right now, there is more supply than demand (or nearly equal since we've been in this 8-10k range for a month now). But if you want TA then the 1hr RSI is overbought and we are at a horizontal resistance so it's best to sell.
If markets are similar then we should see new lows. We haven't seen a new low from RSI or price in three months. You can't see the market act like this until 2015.

... unless you're pointing squarely at June 2014. That's a pretty specific expectation, though. If that's the case then we need to see the price trending down over a long period of time. We're not seeing that.
There ascending line through our most recent drops (6k in early Feb, 6.5 in early April) is at 6.85 now, with connection points in September and November as well.

What makes you so positive that it should break now?
soon as it goes lower all the exchanges will panic and take their golden parachutes and get 'hacked'
or the miners will abandon it for another coin

both
👌
I like the sound of that 
Theres a few points of resistance between here and 9500 (9-9100 being and 9400).  If we go higher ill be looking for volume divergences as they seem pretty good at indicating double tops. Above 9150 i'ĺl close my 8500 hedge and prob close my leverage short at 9100 close with 4+ hrs close tf(well ill cut it above 9100) to avoid liqui which is high 9s at the moment but i have adds up there if it looks weak.

EDIT: I rush on my phone and just got home and corrected. This is just bitmex gambling money though. Every now and then I'll chuck 100 bucks into bitmex and try 10-20x leverage and trade when I have a longer TF trade going on BFX.
Nice, I have mine on 8520. That premium dropped badly :/
Just noticed. All the best! :)
> Got a feeling we bart up though

Charts correlate nicely with what you said. We could be in an inverted bart right now.
In the short term (within a year), there is a small possibility that you can lose a significant % of your investment if you buy current price, though I sure hope not. I have a lot of friends buying last year and holding through it all only to stay breakeven or taking some losses.

I would compare it to new tech like smartphone adoption. After a certain point, the market becomes saturated, and manufacturers start seeing smaller returns. For Bitcoin, I wonder if most of whom that wanted to buy Bitcoin has already bought.
Lol. I HODL/buy the BTC, trade the ALTs.
> which kind of defeats the entire point of Bitcoin

What is the entire point of Bitcoin?

>Creating a LN channel with everyone you want to make transactions with is not practical at all,

And that's not how it works at all, let me guess you got your entire LN knowledge from 1 rBtc post?
Uh huh. And how much code did you write in the last two years? The entitlement is strong in this one.
Block size does not fix the problem. You still have to wait for each block.

Also, it's not called fucking "Bitcoin Core". As if trying to hijack the name "Bitcoin" isn't enough.
Just like the «Fellow ship of bagholders»
Tequila did me dirty 
the Storys in here, netflix would make a Show out of all of them 
I understand. I’m not advising anyone to open a leveraged long here. I’m just saying I’m fortunate to be holding ETH from below, and may let it ride out for a bit before closing to see where this goes.
Ok, people just get pissy on here during corrections especially when you are even slightly bullish.
No that's my point.
;) right back at you, amigo
It's not about what I did. It's about what I've witnessed with hype and crypto. This last pump was not hype at all; it wouldn't have stopped like this.
Exactly so I wouldn't say that's people buying the rumor :p 
not beyond ?
Maybe not nothing but very little to nothing could easily happen. Another coin is adopted and actually used so btc loses its purposes. Adoption never occurs, the fad ends and people just stop caring. Has happened many of times throughout history with many different products or investment items,
Can easily happen to btc 
There is 0 reason anyone here except maybe fuck Harvey and Mikexbt would be stop hunted. 

And even then it'd likely be fruitless since they both have incredibly strong hands. 

There's enough fodder on bitmex already, you don't need to stop hunt anyone unless it's for personal reasons instead of financial ones lol

Speaking about pure gambling not Poker.

Cut your loss yeah but I'm speaking about trading or betting with an amount. Of course you can bet with 1% of your stack; I wasn't implying that at all. I meant to trade with XXX USD or BET with the same amount.
In your opinion, how likely are the following scenarios? -

1) Bitcoin crosses 9300 and goes back to sub 8800 levels without touching 10,600

2) bitcoin crosses 9300 and goes back to sub 8800 levels without touching 9900


lol i dont need to prove anything to you. im not lying. yeah i guess im very emotional. you sound like a butthurt bear that got short stopped.
Good points, thanks.

We're very close to invalidating that, but we haven't yet. That's the case for a short with tight stops, and you're right on the money with it being a good R/R location. 

My hasty close was out of a desire to protect profits, but I should have trusted my stops and targets. Just a little 3% position loss learning/reminder opportunity haha. I'll be holding to my plan on this one. 
High five. 

I'll get it eventually!

For me it's the order of operations that throws me. Eventually it'll become second nature.
ah yes ofc, Verge has done that..

Well the confusion is understandable =P
Yeah hate on XVG as much as you want, that coin is a proper shitcoin and does not deserve a single dollar of value
[deleted]
Look in block explorer: 1MB blocks are gone. Also note that BTC fees have been lower than BCH fees lately. Finally, “just fine” isn’t sufficient. As I argued above, nothing short of “maximally distributed” is good enough. I was pretty clear. If you want to argue, argue about how much decentralization is “just fine”.
dude, do your balls fit in your underpants?!
Jesus Christ, We will all be poor while you roll in the dough
Keeping expectations low, the hype that this event is generating, even without any major announcements (coin specific or general) we will have a rally (see the alts right now, despite bitcoin's shenanigans they are retracing back). You can use this opportunity to open up a short if you believe we will continue a bear trend

But if this conference leads to some major breakthrough (regulatory,adoption, tech, partnerships and etc) we will be in a hell of ride with summer not far away, when most big alts have their major milestones planned, this is a more likely scenario IMO.
mostly the ones that have speaking panels. Such as XRP, AION, SNM, XLM. Someone made a list and I checked those coins were pumping already but I can't find the list.

https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2018/speakers/
Who the fuck knows is certainly accurate.

That said almost everyone here is "short term bearish but long term bullish"

Sounds like the consensus is BTC is going to go up but people also like to shoot themselves in the foot. Greed outweights reason I guess..
Haha I will save the quote. I really liked the pan & pot one the other day. ;)
👌 Tom Hanks (thanks) bro 
sorry thought you were making a joke about forking, disregard lol
Gotta ship somewhere though. 
fuckharvey has said similar stuff as well for what it's worth 
Haha, fair. Needless to say, I'm a confused individual. I'm keeping a close eye on ETH if it falls out, though I expect it to try the resistance again in the next couple of hours. 

I don't know, a breakdown here almost seems too obvious, but the whole contrarian thing is paradoxical either way. 
Haha, true. Maybe even higher with the Consensus meme at full force.
BCH is 9 years old, idiot. Enough with your lies. Go back to your shitcoin sub.
I figured someone would come back and harass you eventually, you love to pick fights in ethtrader and rbtc lol.

Do you have a group of haters in rbtc now?
I can't even read that garbage.  Paragraphs are what?  Italics is cool yo!

Report him, I'm guessing the mods will remove that.  It has no place here, he has no place here.
No problem, will let you know if I anything pops up. I'm using Pushed as well for notifications. Looking forward to that update.
I'll take that bet. Definitely, make sure to let me know next time so I can make a move in the opposite direction ;)
Yeah I got it, but it's still completely irrelevant. It's not about being in or out of a position only. It's related to BTC market. That just doesn't make any sense to me, but it's your life anyway ;)
nah not worth the risk

i.e. even if it goes up from $8800 to $9300

thats just a 5% gain and there'll probably be a pretty heavy resistance at $9K even if ti does get there.

for now I'm going to stay in fiat and wait for a 20-30% dump to reload
hahaha no but very interesting! Its a play off of "Hideo Nomo" former pitcher for the LA Dodgers, Red Sox, Mets, etc. First Japanese born player to win Rookie of the Year. 
Understandable 
Thanks, yes I added at 8725
Good :) laughing is healthy!
you literally posted  "stops above" that means stop order to anyone traded any market ever. But this is reddit feel free to do whatever you want, including lie.
I mean I agree but in terms of risk/reward shorting here is maybe not the best
and when will you start buying again :P
I just mean who bought in if not for the general population =
Apparently TA only works with resistances not supports! We fell through so called supports like they were made of water and a bounce back is surprising for some reason
*Triangles* 

:P
Jeez we are high stress in here today 
Damn :( Just annoying. Can't really blame you much. You can't really predict those 
But insinuating something I could easily disprove is of great benefit?
Well yea...eventually. Not yet. In 2014 they were as high as our $8700 on August 31st. 

They dropped off their equivalent of $10k like a stone down to $7900. Then bounced back up to $9k and slowly bled then dumped to $6.5, back to $7.8, down to $4.5. 

But really, in terms of where we're at in %ATH with respect to time elapsed after ATH, we're not far off. 

We could be at $11.8k on May 23rd and we still wouldn't be higher than 2014 was before it went down again 

I know fundamentally things are very different but the charts really don't look all that different...we could go up here, sure, but...we could go down, too
And we haven’t seen a new high for five months. In fact, we haven’t even seen a local high for about two to three months. We couldn’t break $10k. Now we can’t even break $9k during the holy month of consensus. Not to say we’re going to replicate 2014, but the dead cat bounce has been obvious since 11.8k and continues to play out. People will argue we’ve broken the log resistance line and so the bear is over. The bear may be over, but if we can’t break $12k with conviction and stay above it, we aren’t in a new bull market by any means.
He is speaking of € I think. 
I'm not sure I follow your TA advice.  The powers that be know you have a descending channel drawn there and can make a BGD right there any time they want and know that tons of TA users will buy.  I fail to see how that is really any safer in a market as inorganic as the current bitcoin market.
yeah, which is why I went long

I went 1x long at 8800 and ate some losses. Kinda sucks, but itll be alright

>What is the entire point of Bitcoin?

Decentralized, trustless, immutable, secure


>And that's not how it works at all, let me guess you got your entire LN knowledge from 1 rBtc post?

Well fuck me for relying on articles Ive read.

You're right, I had a shitty understanding of LN.

> Though if we do find support on any of these levels I think there will be considerable upside. Past 10k and retest 12k at least.

I was responding to this part of your statement.
A favourite quote “if it was easy then everyone would be doing it”. 
What news were they selling last week when it dropped 1k in 24 hrs? Hindsight attribution is stupid and almost always false. 
Lol, hence the /s in my post. I know we are joking in good humor. Just kinda funny to get too paranoid.
To be fair, we don't know chewys position size. Or anybody really.
As Satoshi showed us
why'd u buy $6500? cause price was low but couldn't make lower lows? So why would u buy here?

that's the only point he's making. 

if you're not adding here, why are u arguing with him? 
No problem.

If you had your position from yesterday still open, would you close it now like you did yesterday?
Completely agree!
 "Also note that BTC fees have been lower than BCH fees lately."

Completely false. Like that's literally never been true. 

https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactionfees-btc-bch.html#3m


> Look in block explorer: 1MB blocks are gone.

Look in the code. Nope. They are still there. They managed to EFFECTIVELY make them seem larger by moving witness data to a structure outside of the blockchain. Hence, the name SegShit.

> Also note that BTC fees have been lower than BCH fees lately

Straight up ignorance or lie. BCORE fees are averaging $1.44 right now. Bitcoin Cash fees are averaging $0.17 right now. I can create a BCH transaction right now for 1 sat/byte and have it included in the next block.

> “maximally distributed” is good enough

Oh I see, your arbitrary terms are good enough, but my "just fine" isn't. Go fuck yourself.
short answer: No

Long answer: It's complicated

Answering for my homie
Lol it's really only a 3x short in terms contracts vs the total amount of fiat I have dedicated to crypto. I don't have nearly as much as some other people here. 

If my trading account gets big enough I will probably start reducing leverage/position size by quite a bit though. I don't know if I could stomach colossal losses (even if it means colossal wins)
lol but it was a tiny amount of btc, remember? I think I told you about it. I had just taken huge losses. I basically said fuck this and revenge traded (as intelligently as I could) and it worked out. 

If we're talking about the entire amount of fiat I have potentially dedicated to crypto, it's like...a 3x short.

but I have had like 1/2 of my stack sitting on gdax doing nothing for months now.

and it wasn't ever 55x at any point. it was a max like 20x at the beginning I think. and I just kept adding because of the double top. And chew added like 10% below where I added so I was like fuck it, this is a good place to add, I'll add more. The move down was so swift that I was literally never underwater, and each of my adds was never underwater for more than 1-2% for more than like 4 hours. 

but because of the margin from adding while in profit, the leverage was technically moving down
Respectfully disagree :\) Although you may be keeping your expectations low, more often then not if there is price hype leading up to an event like we've seen, you can bet your bottom dollar you will see a drop once the news hits, unless, like you said, we have a major breakthrough. 

In fact i can't really think of a time when we've had hype leading up to a major event/news and kept rising once the news hits. I've only been in this space since June 2017 though so i'm probably wrong.
And what kind of announcement do you expect to build a new rally on those coins?
It's not like it's gonna be limited to good traders only. You can buy anonymously.

/u/l14dy I believe there was a site that allowed to create a t-shirt where you go with design and people just order it individually.
Yeah right, but then it wouldn't be linked to the username from this sub. 
We could do Amazon lock boxes? Or pick up at the Post Office

Otherwise we just design the logo, I guess. And everyone can print it themselves
The entire space is a cryptobro echo chamber this week, so that's certainly an x factor. 
See, all you can do is adhom BCH. 
> Do you have a group of haters in rbtc now?

Like you would not believe. These people make ETHTrader look like Yale. 

There are at least 10 that want me dead, 5 that message me to kill myself constantly and 3 or 4 that follow me around almost every day posting the same comment to the people I'm interacting with. A few have already been permabanned from here. 

I even got into it with the number 2 mod of there [yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8j0k6r/bits_is_the_historical_and_common_sense_unit_and/dyx6r55/?context=10000). I think he hates me now too. Now I just need to reach the final boss and get the finger from /u/memorydealers. That scumbag is locked  away way up in the castle though. I have more work to do. Unfortunately, I can only comment every 10 minutes. I need to improve my attack stats.

edit: It's also funny because one of these people was claiming that my comments were all downvoted and starts referencing one of those 'Bitcoin Legacy' posts I made here that got buried. I don't think they understood what was going on...
Yeah, I'll report it I guess, though it's already hidden. But yeah, this guy and /u/kokansei keep posting the same shit over and over. It's just blatant character assassination and has no bearing on conversation. I'm guessing that mods will end up banning these two, given that they've been doing this non-stop.
>Paragraphs are what?

Its a copy paste of HIS writing. 
Should have received a bunch of notifications today. I was testing an hour ago. Did you find the position bot channel? 
It's not like I make the wrong move every time. I sometimes see market wanting to move in short term, like in minutes. I've shorted just above 11k prior to break down ;-)
Well ain’t that some shit! There I go assuming! Either way, my friend, I wish you the very best of luck in everything you do. 
have a great day
No it only means that to you. And even so you are wrong with an o. Never did hit above 8830
that's not how a lot of people use them here. stops doesn't necessarily mean hard stops 
How that 8950 wick treating you lol
probably never :/
Fewer than 1% of population has bitcoin, what makes you think there is so much market penetration? 
with amount of scams in crypto, your approach is obvious scam af. jeez even carlos matos jokes about his wife calling his sneaky scam
You can stick to the plan, which was close when 8.2 breaks down...
Not interested, thank you for reading my post.
> we could go up here, sure, but...we could go down, too

Swinging back around to this finally. I think we agree about 99% This statement is what makes that clear.

People looking at 2014 as a road-map to the future is what I find problematic. It can easily go any direction. Personally, I think we're going to range through the rest of 2018 with a slight edge to long-term bulls. It could just as easily go the other way, though.
This is a point for my argument. June 2014 was a local high for price and RSI. We're not anywhere near a position like that.

My point is that this doesn't look like 2014. My point is not that we are in a bull market.
Oh now I see, thank you. I had overlooked the € sign, and was surprised to see /u/babies_eater, whose perspectives I enjoy reading, has turned into a prophet of doom... ;)
I knew this gonna drop, but still feel salty that I didn't hedge my long :/

At least 8.2 holds. Gonna be good entry if this doesn't drop further.
You’re making shit up. You can go use LN on mainnet now. She never made claims as to when it would be ready for mainstream. She was pretty transparent that that would take time and be a process.
>all because bitcoin core failed to update to bigger block sizes. 


Exactly....none of this has to do with Consensus. 
You can actually guess his position size from a few old comments of his. He's normally very private but he accidentally revealed it once. I think it's since been deleted. It wouldn't be worth hunting him.. Not saying he's not trading what would be considered a lot for most of us.. 

But the only reason someone would hunt him would be to ruin his reputation, not to get his stops to fill their order. It would be an incredibly expensive reputation attack 
i bought at what i perceived to be the bottom and it was a good decision. im actually in alts but i bought when BTC was at 6500. im up a lot more than if i were only in BTC. im not arguing im just stating my opinion on how so many people here are so risk averse. 
No actually. I'd close if this line breaks to the upside:

https://imgur.com/a/qERLiOG
Point taken. Some higher fees skew the average. Look at median fees.
Argue your case. I argued the other side in good faith. I have not told anyone to go fuck themselves, although I suppose you may feel OK about doing it.
The short answer somehow implies that I don't want to know the long answer
Long answer: nooooooo
Ok then, I just have to collect my jaw from the floor. You COULD give out a little more information before dropping such a tactical nuke! I scrape 100USD with my measly stack and the stress kills me. I still stand by the notion you have abnormally large testicles that allows you to channel that stress.
Well done homie. I remember now. Just checked conversation history.
It's ok man, if we all agreed to everything the world would be a boring place. You think the news was the consensus and sell the news was before that, I think we may yet to see that. 2018 is a very interesting year for Crypto, it's the first year that this space is under so much attention and hype, everywhere in the world. We just have to wait and see what is discussed and what will be its effects.
I don't expect anything significant, just trading according to the hype. I have my eyes on ripple and stellar though, if any big news comes it will be from them IMO
Yeah, let’s do that!
touche
Good, go cry somewhere else.

On behalf of the rBtc readers who do have a brain... I'm sorry. :(  There's bad people there too.
Excerpt his writing had formatting and paragraphs, so it seems you can't even get that right.

I have zero respect for you.  Following someone around posting a copy of them writing about the worst moment of their entire life is immoral, against Reddit's rules, and juvenile.  /u/gypsytoy may be wrong about bigger blocks and BCH, but he's clearly intelligent, he makes some good points, and he deserves to be treated with respect.  You deserve to get banned from reddit and ostracized from the big blocker community forever.
I did find the channel and I did get them. Seems to be working fine. 
Ah okay, Gotcha! well you should still give me a heads up cause then maybe we can both make some money. I'm normally the unlucky type that the moves happens just when I'm afk. 
Thank you very much! Likewise my friend. Again THANK YOU for that comment. Brought a smile to my face on an otherwise MEH day!
that not what stop means.. whats being described is setting an alert at a price point.
lol and the premium is decreasing...wish i shorted more
the BGDs are good for market penetration
I'm not sure if you get what I'm asking...I'm merely curious who was part of the bull run and why. What they're doing now? Buying? Waiting? Etc
Your whalecum
Yeah I can't really disagree with this anymore. We're ranging in a big ass triangle now. Once the support or resistance breaks for it I'll watch what the market does for a few days after and probably be bullish/bearish thereafter. 
Haha, I've definitely become more conservative in my predictions, but I'm not forecasting doom and gloom just yet ;). 

Thanks /u/skythe4.
I knew it too man. But I set alarms instead of going into a position, but then when the alarm hit, it bounce right back up, so I thought looking good after all. Woke up to the next alarm and it was dropping so quick it would have been stupid to touch it
[deleted]
nice trade. and yes I get you but I really don't believe avoiding buying a top is risk averse. It's just smart...

there's a reason you bought $6500 instead of here
Thanks. This is just messed up.
And?

https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/median_transaction_fee-btc-bch.html#3m
> Argue your case.

I did. Go back and read what I wrote.
lol
Entering is extremely stressful because of it and I tend to add only after I'm in profit and only if I think the move is going to be a large one. 

Part of my risk management requires that I close pretty early even if I get near the top. For example, I shorted June futures originally at $9680 (first time we hit $9750). I didn't close it until about $9800 the second time it came back around upwards. I re-shorted at $10060 and closed it at $10075. It went to like $10300 but later came back down. I re-opened at $9650 again on the way down and have been holding it since.

I then shorted $9150 on the $9050 dump (after $9900) and the premium blew up on me. I was underwater on that entry by about 4% for a day or so. But I waited because my other shorts were in profit (my swaps had generated about 10% on my entire stack in funding rates just from sitting there) 

I added at $8950 on september this morning (on accident tbh, I put a limit order and forgot to remove it, but it wicked perfectly to $8950 this morning due to low liquidity on the first pump to $8650) 

I will be hesitant to add after this because my short is pretty big now. 

But yes, those few days at $9600+...incredibly stressful and not fun at all. But it's worth it when we dump 20% in a day. I see it as putting in the work, you know? You gotta put in the work, be stressed out so you can be greedy at the beginning of the move. If I only shorted 2x up there I'd have added lower and fucked all of my profits up because I wanted to be greedy *after* the move instead of before. So I add as much as I can early on so that I can be comfortable later
Yea...and I could have quite literally 3x the btc I do right now if I had closed at $6.5k. :'(
Yep i will be looking closely. Goodluck!
So I think we just need to come up with a design.
I'm not crying, just trying to get some justifications for your claims. You don't seem to have any. 
Well in that specific case it's because Bitcoin *is* a brand and product, despite what they claim, and people should be aware of this whether or not they *choose* to believe it. 

I'm actually legitimately interested in what the other side has to say most of the time and I'm open minded enough to flip sides, for sure. Unfortunately, all I see there is a wild cult, chock full of nuts, conspiracy theories and denialism. If they had good arguments they could win me over, but all they do is throw temper tantrums, name-call and repeat the same tired propaganda lines over and over. There's virtually 0 critical thought, with a few exceptions. 

It's a fascinating experience and, like I said, makes ETHtrader look like a hyper-intellectualized utopia. Those ETH guys actually seem incredibly reasonable compared with loonies like /u/H0dl, who, if you get him upset, will literally shout the same "You a dumb BCH, BCH" comment at you repeatedly, comment after comment. 

I don't know if you're into masochism, but if you are...
Yeah for sure. You, capt_murdock, lubokkanev and a handful of others are tagged as such. The rest are tagged as morons/shills/tantrum-throwers or whatever's most applicable. It's too bad that so many in there can't just debate ideas, instead they have to turn everything personal and, if you call them out for fallacious arguments, they started throwing a complete fit. There are a handful of people that are stalking and harassing me all over reddit but these two are the worst. 
Thanks, man. Yeah /u/H0dl and his gang of minions are pretty much the worst crypto has to offer.

Also, I did format that with paragraphs too. Lol. /u/h0dl just doesn't know how to properly mark down a comment. 

Additionally, I'm not embarrassed by the post (I wrote it after all), so I'm not sure what exactly their goal is but I don't think it's having the desired effect.

Cheers!
Yep, my bad on the paragraph thing. But you have no idea how this clown actually behaves. He's been the one following me around reddit harassing me and DM'ing me about price memes. He's short BCH afaic and he has little technical or economic knowledge about how Bitcoin works. He's been the one heavily trolling r/btc if you care to look. I hardly venture outside that place except to post here once in a while. 
Great. I've removed my user from the list so no more false alarms. And as i was writing, chewy entered his position.

lots of people use stops as a shorthand for "mental stops" and not hard stops
A bunch of koreans?

Why are you so butthurt about this?

Nothing you just said is inconsistent with what I said. It’s ready to use, but not ready for mainstream. It won’t be ready for mainstream with the flick of a switch, either. More of a frog boiling in water. 

Your level of entitlement is off the charts. Clearly you have never worked on technology before, much less open source. Quit your tantruming and find something else to troll about.
Just think of what a shitshow it'll be if this reverses course again off that resistance line. 

I'm fine with this candle if it keeps going. But if we see a 100% retrace, I'm going to be completely spun around as to what comes next. 
I stand corrected. Thanks for doing the research and pointing out my error.
I read it. I didn’t find it compelling. I suppose we can let others decide which they like more. Thanks for taking the time to offer your input. Well reasoned, civil discourse is almost always enlightening and helpful.
Tell me about. I don't do margin trading (partly because I can't, as an Iranian exchanges can suspend your account at a moment's notice) but I do trade alts/btc/usd from time to time, when the market is volatile. I don't have the patience to trade more than half a day time frame, so I can't imagine sitting on a position for a month can be like. And the stress... the days I trade I'm off limits. Kodus to you, your iron nerves and balls of steel
I have no idea why you didn't close at 6.5k
good luck to you too!
started new thread:

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8jf6o0/bitcoinmarkets_merchandise_design/?st=JH6NM2ID&sh=eb215d7d

I say we design a visual for “Goblin Town” and put it on the back!!!
Sure you aren't. I suppose those tears are just from something being caught in your eye, right?

It's okay bud, we still care about you.
Don't forget. The only argument you've ever had against BCH is "muh big blocks cause centralization!"

that's it. 
> But you have no idea how this clown actually behaves.

Sure I do.  [I've gotten into it](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8f7g6r/wtf_nick_szabo_retweeted_if_you_are_new_to/dy3eo1z/?context=3) with him before, [and repeatedly.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8e0z4r/daily_discussion_sunday_april_22_2018/dxuyus8/).  If you can't tell, he and I don't agree.  And I wish he would call things by their actual names.

But I read his history briefly before I replied to you, looking for that quote.  "This clown" likes to argue, that's obvious.  So what, I like to argue.  Not all of his arguments are sound, but many of them are, and he's clearly not stupid.

Guess what, in order for crypto to move forward, we need the not stupid people to realize on-chain scaling isn't a joke and start taking it seriously.  They can be convinced, but they can't be convinced by insulting them or browbeating them or relying on stupid arguments.  You have to argue better.  He says BCH's blocks are small.  Guess what? He's right, and it's a problem.

Yes, debating him can be frustrating.  Yes, you won't get an agreement much of the time.  So what.  You attract more flies with honey than vinegar.  If BCH is the way to go, intelligent people need to be convinced.  Or else they will continue to subtract BCH's value in subtle ways just like BCH's smart supporters subtract value from BTC.

> He's been the one following me around reddit harassing me and DM'ing me about price memes.

I haven't seen that, but if it was happening, report that as a violation.  Two people breaking reddit rules is worse than one.

> He's short BCH afaic 

He said he's not and I'm inclined to believe him.  He likes arguing.  So do I.  Even if he is short BCH/BTC, he's a trader, so what?  In my opinion, both the BCH/BTC and ETH/BTC ratios have over extended themselves.  I like it, but from the perspective of a trader they are ripe for shorting.

> and he has little technical or economic knowledge about how Bitcoin works.

He has some things wrong, like believing Core will simply increase the blocksize when it is time, and/or that it isn't necessary now, and that LN's flaws can all be simply worked away.  But he DOES have a lot of the important knowledge.  Just try to read his history from a neutral perspective and it'll be obvious that he's making some good points.

/u/gypsytoy 
nah its basically just this thread tbh
[deleted]
For now it stopped on the rising channel i had here drawn. My liquidation is 10k2, i might just go for broke and don't set stops and see what the next days reserve. 
If i close i'll probably get chopped like hell and end up losing as much as just letting this one go and hope for the best...
Thanks for being reasonable. 

I encourage you to look into BCH more.

Sure, bigger blocks mean less people will be able to run nodes. I know you say “maximally distributed” is what you are looking for. But what is that to you? Literally every single person in the world run a node? That is not gonna happen. I've been in Bitcoin since 2013 and never ran a full node. SPV is more than good enough for me. My grandma will never ever even know what a node means.

At a certain point the amount of 'decentralization' doesn't matter. Say only big data centers can run nodes (which means Bitcoin has big enough blocks that it's already a world currency). There are 10s of thousands of data centers throughout the world in different countries under different jurisdictions. No single entity or conglomerate could possibly affect all of them at once. Plus, these data centers are directly connected to the broadband backbone, having fast access to entire web.

One could argue home nodes actually hurt the network, as their propagation is slow compared to these data centers. 
I have only lost money from overtrading, so I do my best to stick to positions that I can hold for at least a day of two. I prefer to hold for weeks, though. my swaps short has been open since mid April I think.. whenever we hit $9750 the first time. 


greed + complacency + euphoria. I even called it accumulation and said I would close it in a day if we didn't pop under $6.5 again. but I didn't. I'm terrible about closing. I'm kind of thinking of closing here but idk.. 
Just let me know when this gets real.
> I say we design a visual for “Goblin Town” and put it on the back!!!

Haha good idea. What goes on the front though?
I've made plenty of arguments, including ones related to design principles and efficiency. Not to mention fee structures and competition models. 

Go back to your shitcoin sub. This sub is for more critical discussion and you have nothing valuable to offer in that regard.
> He said he's not and I'm inclined to believe him.

Yeah I don't lie about my positions or trades. Hence the post I made that he repeatedly attacks me with.

I'm tempted to open up a short for tomorrow's fork though, which I have to imagine is going to drive the price down once the hype is over. Will I? I don't know, probably not a sizable one or probably not one at all. More interested in sticking with BTC at the moment. (not that any of this is relevant to his attacks on me based on completely false claims about my motivations).

>He has some things wrong, like believing Core will simply increase the blocksize when it is time, and/or that it isn't necessary now, and that LN's flaws can all be simply worked away. But he DOES have a lot of the important knowledge. Just try to read his history from a neutral perspective and it'll be obvious that he's making some good points.

I'm happy to debate with the likes of you or plenty of others who can stick to discussing specific ideas, instead of everything else under the sun, which so many, **on both sides**, cannot help themselves from doing. 

I'm also open minded as well. I'm not stuck on one project or the other. As soon as I hear a compelling argument regarding BCash (yes, I'm still going to call it that from time to time and I certainly don't believe the argument that it's somehow a "slur") then I'll switch sides or hedge or hold ETH or whatever. 

To paint me as some sort of closed minded shill who isn't interested in critical and detailed debate is just wrong. Sure, I may toss a few low blows in from time to time (like the BCash thing, though this is really not as malicious as people make it out to be), but my discussion is always pointed towards the topic at hand and I do my best to articulate my points clearly and respond in detail to the other side's points. I have admitted I've been wrong several times and have ceded ground to other side when it's logical to do so. 

/u/H0dl and the gang of /r/BTC folk. who are now following me around incessantly on reddit, paint a picture of a closed minded, shill, troll, retard, loser, etc. etc. But it's just unfounded nonsense. I do the best I can to engage thoughtfully, bottom line. Lately, because I've been highly critical of falsehoods and propaganda being spread in rBTC, I've acquired quite the following of haters. It doesn't bother me to any great deal but it's a bit annoying and I regret attracting these people to this sub, which is of much higher caliber than some other places.

I just wish everyone could focus on debating the ideas first and foremost and not resort to this character assassination trash. It doesn't have the desired effect, which I'm pretty sure is to get me to kill myself or something (certainly get plenty of PMs that state this explicitly), it just pollutes the sub with low-quality crap.

Anyway, thanks for being a voice of reason from the other side of the debate. Like I said, there are plenty of you but your voices seem drowned out a lot of the time, at least in my experience. 
no lol its a general issue with traders. They say they have stops but don't actually set them. Peter Brandt has tweeted about the issue before. And I'm fairly sure he has met traders outside of bitcoin markets...
You’re just parsing words to be a troll, not arguing.
I believe the only way to preserve trust is to commit to absolute, unwavering “maximal decentralization”. Yes, ideally every citizen would be a miner many times over. Any change to the technology which makes this possibility less likely must be off the table. The spacing of block confirmations was designed to support high-latency propagation for a reason: decentralization.
Yes, overtrading always results in a net loss for me. And over some stupid mistakes such as leaving my positions open when I'm not around to check on them. I hate stop losses for some reason, wicks always destroy my profits. Therefore I only trade when I'm fully committed and these days, when the market is so volatile are perfect for me. Strange that I'm a very patient man in day to day life, but somehow when it comes to trading, I spook out frequently.
Well, you know what I think. 7.5k is the fair price of Bitcoin, so closing 800 bucks above it is not stupid if you ask me.

Damn man, you must have really hated yourself at 10k
Nope, "muh big blocks cause centralization" is your FUD. I've asked for research backing up this claim and you've produced nothing. 
> I'm tempted to open up a short for tomorrow's fork though, which I have to imagine is going to drive the price down once the hype is over. 

If you do, I'd expect it to be open for at least 20 days.  I also wouldn't open it up until at least 24 hours after the fork - forks can unexpectedly drive prices through the roof.  I was majorly blindsided by ETH's response to segwit2x both before and after. :/

> I just wish everyone could focus on debating the ideas first and foremost and not resort to this character assassination trash.

Yep.  I've felt this way for years - obviously more about the pro-BTC side than mine.  But I'm well aware it is present on both sides.

> Like I said, there are plenty of you but your voices seem drowned out a lot of the time, at least in my experience.

Agreed.
Well, that just sounds like a crypto socialist utopia lmao - everyone being a miner and having the hardware to support it. 

I guess I'm failing to see your point. 

There's a tradeoff that needs to happen between the spectrum of decentralization and mass adoption. 

Me, I'd rather have a world currency that everyone uses where worldwide data centers propagate the blocks rather than a store of value coin where only few enthusiasts are users who all run nodes. 


btw found your fee claim: https://fork.lol/tx/fee

Looks like someone was paying high fees for some reason to bump up the average fee. Looking at it as the median it's still way lower. Either way, paying 1 sat/byte will get you included in the next BCH block every time. 
That's really funny you say that, because I am extremely impatient in real life. and with trading I am becoming very, very patient (relatively speaking in the crypto trading space at least). Holding positions open for 3-6 weeks at a time. 

I think it has a lot to do with being risk averse too. 
Haha wait what do you mean? At $10k? 
Yes I have. Go cry somewhere else please. This place is for serious discussion, not middle school drama.

Yeah my biggest concern is timing, which means I may just trade it. Alts are weird. BCH is especially weird. 

>Yep. I've felt this way for years - obviously more about the pro-BTC side than mine. But I'm well aware it is present on both sides.

Yeah, this obviously applies to everything outside of crypto too. The internet makes it so much worse. Everyone's an expert and everyone behaves like a psychopath. Anonymity is a hell of a drug. 
Well, at least we agree on the essence of the debate. People can make up there own minds. I am not suggesting a "crypto socialist utopia lmao" is possible or desirable (not sure exactly what you believe such a thing is, but that's not a big deal, I guess). My point remains: as an institution, Bitcoin's trustworthiness is dependent on it's commitment to, and realization of, decentralization. Any change to the system which could decrease decentralization should be viewed as a last-resort. All other potential solutions to problems should come first, even if those solutions are also imperfect, in different ways.
Interesting, may be the discipline comes by itself, like any profession. I'm new to this, compared to my beginning, I'm doing much better. In my life patience is a defense mechanism to deal with the hardships of living in a hellhole, maybe I'm an impulsive man after all.
Well a week ago when the price was 10k and you didnt close at 6.5k ;)
Well, repeat them here for all your buddies, since we're not in a shithole like you always like to accuse r/btc of being. 
and my main need in Bitcoin are secure, subcent transactions that can scale to the entire world
well I closed at $8k haha 
The people here already understand. Please take this BCash talk to the "Alt Discussion" thread. These alt conversations belong there or on /r/BTC.

Enough of your incessant whining, already. Go find someone else to troll. I'm sorry the price of BCH is once again falling. Like I said, it's going to dump after the fork hype is over.

Go away.
On-chain scaling cannot ever serve the needs of the ‘entire world’. Moreover, confirmation times for reliable (confirmed) transactions still take 20 minutes or so, hence a very significant percentage of real-world transactions can not be supported by BTC or BCH even if they were free. Off-chain transactions (and atomic swaps) are a necessary part of the final Bitcoin architecture. I believe that Bitcoin’s development isn’t complete yet - it’s still in ‘beta’. I believe the block size discussion is a distraction.
way to go
You mean this place is only for core folk? I wasn't aware of that. Could be I suppose although I often see BCH folk here. If so, maybe they should ban me for trying to flesh out some real technical and economic facts from trolls like you. 
Sure.

I forgot to mention that most BCHers are not against layer 2 technologies. Shit, we have the tippr bot which is technically off-chain (although yes, way different than LN and centralized)

We are against Layer 2 when the blockchain is constricted in order to push the layer two, like with the 1MB limit. There is no reason BTC could not have gone to 4MB, hell, even 2MB blocks without a problem. It would have alleviated the ridiculous fees that happened in December. That little stint made me not trust the BTC devs to look out for the users. 


Lol, okay buddy. This sub and thread are for **Bitcoin** discussion, not alts. Get a clue. The "Alt Discussion" thread is where you belong, now move along.
I’ve been looking at the blocks for BTC and BCH and I noticed 2 things. (1) BTC fees are higher even though the blocks aren’t full. I’m guessing that this is because of poor fee estimation by users. They could be much lower without changing the network. I’ve also noticed (2) that BCH blocks are really small, which begs the question: what is the benefit of larger blocks?
Ok, you claim BCH is an alt? Well, at least you give me something for discussion.

No, it's not. It's shares the genesis block and distributes a one for one share even to btc hodlers whether they like it or not. They have a vested interest in seeing BCH succeed, if merely as a hedge. 
1. Yes, poor fee estimation could be part of it. But if your fee is always low, a sudden spike in the mempool would cause your tx to get stuck.

2. Larger blocks are a benefit so you don't have ANY tx stuck in the mempool, so subcent fees will go through everytime. 
No, most hodlers dumped that very quickly and haven't looked back since. Even if they didn't, it's still an alt. Do you need clarification from the mods on this point? BCH discussion belongs in the other thread. Ask the mods if you don't believe me.
So your argument is that massively over-provisioning is insurance against the possibility that there could be a huge increase in demand that is sensitive to fee cost?  Do we have any data that shows the impact of fees on demand - what percentage of transactions require a fee below a certain cost? Do you think that transactions which require sub-cent fees still make sense if the confirmation times remain longer than ~20 minutes? Wouldn’t reducing the confirmation time be as important as the fee? For example, if I buy a cup of coffee I can live with a $.25 fee (I don’t care about the fee at all, TBH), but not a 20 minute confirmation time.

UPDATE: here’s a scenario: I do approximately 75 transactions per day, using a mix of payment systems: Debit card, direct payments from my bank accounts, small cash payments, automatic payments on my Spotify, Apple, Pandora, on-line gaming, transit pass, payments from customers of my on-line content, orders from Amazon, Paypal subscriptions and so forth. The majority of those are quite small and a low fee would be helpful, but they cannot be done at all if the confirmation time is linger than a few seconds. That’s why I don’t use BTC or BCH for any of those. I could already get my transactions through for a satoshi per byte on either network, but neither of them can do it fast enough.
Well I didn't dump. In fact, I've accumulated from that dump to my profit. I've seen figures that only 40% of BCH distribution addresses dumped. Which would be expected given cold storage.

Yes, I'd like clarification. Would be a shame if true since BCH is climbing and the fundamentals are solid. 
None of this is productive or even on topic for this thread. Take it to PM with /u/H0dl. 
BCH will always have their tx go through on the next block. This first confirmation happens at a random time, at an average of 10 minutes. This is how both the Bitcoin chain's blocks work. The difference is that on BTC you must estimate how much to pay for the next block. See this site: https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#1,24h 

0-confirmation is still viable on BCH for smaller transactions, like for coffee. BTC enabled Replace by Fee, which allows a user to resend their transaction with a higher fee, erasing the first. Peter Todd demonstrated this on BTC here: https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/peter-todd-explains-how-he-double-spent-coinbase?locale=en 
Lol, it's not climbing and the fundamentals are in the toilet. Remember, 80 Kb blocks. Ask a mod to clarify. 

/u/jenninsea /u/jarederaj 

Is BCH an alt? Does its discussion belong in the alt thread?
0-conf is “no confirmation”, and I can’t think of anyone who believes that it’s anything mire than a temporary workaround. Starbucks, for example, would never build a revenue stream on a system that allows unconfirmed transactions. Who would?

Don’t BCH transactions continue to get bumped until the miners run out of higher-fee transactions to process? If not, how does BCH protect itself from DOS spam attacks?
Dude, the cross is way up as is the average price since this guy's like Xapo and Bitfury George dumped.

Yes, I'd like clarification that BCH discussion is banned from this sub. That would tell alot of people something very important. 
Actually BCH is a fork / version of Bitcoin. 

You are on quite the anti BCH streak lately all over crypto reddit. Are you mad cause you sold all your BCH when the Core thought leaders told you to? It's not too late to buy back in ya know
Are you trying to get me banned again like you failed to do with the reddit admins when I got you backed into a corner?

LOL. Yet... nothing about the fundamentals, which win in the long run. Demand looks pretty high at the moment tbh

Fundamentals being what? 80 Kb blocks? Yeah those are certainly strong fundamentals. /s

A roadmap to centralization? Yeah another great fundamental! /s
[removed]
The point is to NEVER have full blocks so fees never rise.

What's centralization to you, exactly? Even if data centers were the only ones to run nodes those are all over the world in different countries and different jurisdictions. 

Not like any of my points matter, talking to a brick wall of BCH hate

Firstly, this is off topic. BCash discussion belongs in the alt thread. Plain and simple. This is my last response I'm going to make on the topic.

>The point is to NEVER have full blocks so fees never rise.

And how does that stay decentralized? Also, how do fees and spam work in this system? What prevents spam?

>What's centralization to you, exactly? Even if data centers were the only ones to run nodes those are all over the world in different countries and different jurisdictions.

Singular point of failure, whether geographic or otherwise, mining and nodes should be as dispersed as possible.

>Not like any of my points matter, talking to a brick wall of BCH hate

Nah, dawg. Assume what you want but I'm open minded. I've had plenty of reasonable conversations with many BCH proponents, whom themselves are much more open minded and reasonable than you appear to be.

The bottom line is this discussion does not belong in this thread. This thread is for Bitcoin discussion only. This is exactly why mods made the "alt discussion" thread. I regret making the initial joke because I should've known that BCash shills were waiting to jump on the opportunity to talk their same tired arguments. 

Take this discussion [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8j9i9o/altcoin_discussion_monday_may_14_2018/) if you wish to continue.

If you pay a fee it's not spam.

Did I ever say a singular point of failure? Data centers are hooked into the backbone of the internet. If you could shut down all of the data centers in the world we have much bigger problems than a faulty crypto.

Imo BCH fits in this sub anyways. Wether you think it's Bitcoin or not it directly affects the BTC price by sucking it's value out, because people like me think it's the same version of Bitcoin we've been using since we got into crypto many years ago
[removed]
>Imo BCH fits in this sub anyways.

It's not. Mods have addressed this several times. It belongs in the alt thread. Nobody cares if you think it's Bitcoin, it's not, it's a contentious fork and therefore it's an alt. It's nowhere close to the longest chain. Do you consider Bitcoin Gold, Diamond or Private to be Bitcoin? No, then neither is BCash. Take it to the appropriate sub or the alt thread FFS. 
Quoting one section of the above poster doesn't make your reasoning any sounder.

There's no reason to be so dismissive of open information, anyone can make the decisions they want of what is or what isn't Bitcoin.

I think we can all agree Bitcoin gold, Bitcoin diamond, Bitcoin private etc are definitely not the same as Bitcoin core or Bitcoin cash in terms of significance. 

Purely because Bitcoin cash is of significance it should be an open discussion. In terms of price, hashrate, community support, exchange volume, it is of huge significance. 
> I think we can all agree Bitcoin gold, Bitcoin diamond, Bitcoin private etc are definitely not the same as Bitcoin core or Bitcoin cash in terms of significance.

No, one category is Bitcoin, which is BTC itself. The rest fall into the category of "Bitcoin Forks", which are alts by definition. There's only one Bitcoin and its the one that kept the network and usebase. All others are wannabes, aka alts. 


>Purely because Bitcoin cash is of significance it should be an open discussion. 

It's discussed in the alt thread, what more do you want? It's not Bitcoin and shouldn't be discussed in Bitcoin Markets daily thread. This has already been established by the mods. I don't understand why you're arguing. They set up a specific thread for you people. 


>In terms of price, hashrate, community support, exchange volume, it is of huge significance.

Lol, no it's not. It's 1/6th the price. It's not even #2 or #3 coin. Plus, at the moment it's price is unreasonably high because of fork hype. For the most part it's more like 1/10th the value of Bitcoin (and that's based on significantly worse liquidity, so the number is inflated). It's hashrate is the same story. Far below that of BTC (and only exists because Jihan took advantage of the EDA and propped up the coin in the beginning). It's 'community' is largely uninformed and composed of trolls who downvote any decent. A quick glance at rBTC reveals that cancer. Exchange volume is extremely low and only pumps when exhanges give access to coins and people dump them. Other than that, volume is pretty weak, especially this recent pump. 

Also, the TXs are just absolutely terrible. BTC is doing like 15x the number of transaction BCH does. Segwit alone is doing far more than BCH. 

Your narrative doesn't add up, which is why this talk belongs in the Alt Discussion thread. Please move this discussion to there, as per the rules.
